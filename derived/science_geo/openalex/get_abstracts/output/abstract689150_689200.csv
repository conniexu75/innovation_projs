https://openalex.org/W4213415596,"Metformin, the most prescribed antidiabetic medicine, has shown other benefits such as anti-ageing and anticancer effects1-4. For clinical doses of metformin, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) has a major role in its mechanism of action4,5; however, the direct molecular target of metformin remains unknown. Here we show that clinically relevant concentrations of metformin inhibit the lysosomal proton pump v-ATPase, which is a central node for AMPK activation following glucose starvation6. We synthesize a photoactive metformin probe and identify PEN2, a subunit of γ-secretase7, as a binding partner of metformin with a dissociation constant at micromolar levels. Metformin-bound PEN2 forms a complex with ATP6AP1, a subunit of the v-ATPase8, which leads to the inhibition of v-ATPase and the activation of AMPK without effects on cellular AMP levels. Knockout of PEN2 or re-introduction of a PEN2 mutant that does not bind ATP6AP1 blunts AMPK activation. In vivo, liver-specific knockout of Pen2 abolishes metformin-mediated reduction of hepatic fat content, whereas intestine-specific knockout of Pen2 impairs its glucose-lowering effects. Furthermore, knockdown of pen-2 in Caenorhabditis elegans abrogates metformin-induced extension of lifespan. Together, these findings reveal that metformin binds PEN2 and initiates a signalling route that intersects, through ATP6AP1, the lysosomal glucose-sensing pathway for AMPK activation. This ensures that metformin exerts its therapeutic benefits in patients without substantial adverse effects."
https://openalex.org/W4213441627,"A hallmark pathological feature of the neurodegenerative diseases amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is the depletion of RNA-binding protein TDP-43 from the nucleus of neurons in the brain and spinal cord1. A major function of TDP-43 is as a repressor of cryptic exon inclusion during RNA splicing2-4. Single nucleotide polymorphisms in UNC13A are among the strongest hits associated with FTD and ALS in human genome-wide association studies5,6, but how those variants increase risk for disease is unknown. Here we show that TDP-43 represses a cryptic exon-splicing event in UNC13A. Loss of TDP-43 from the nucleus in human brain, neuronal cell lines and motor neurons derived from induced pluripotent stem cells resulted in the inclusion of a cryptic exon in UNC13A mRNA and reduced UNC13A protein expression. The top variants associated with FTD or ALS risk in humans are located in the intron harbouring the cryptic exon, and we show that they increase UNC13A cryptic exon splicing in the face of TDP-43 dysfunction. Together, our data provide a direct functional link between one of the strongest genetic risk factors for FTD and ALS (UNC13A genetic variants), and loss of TDP-43 function."
https://openalex.org/W4213435307,"Abstract Variants of UNC13A , a critical gene for synapse function, increase the risk of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia 1–3 , two related neurodegenerative diseases defined by mislocalization of the RNA-binding protein TDP-43 4,5 . Here we show that TDP-43 depletion induces robust inclusion of a cryptic exon in UNC13A , resulting in nonsense-mediated decay and loss of UNC13A protein. Two common intronic UNC13A polymorphisms strongly associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia risk overlap with TDP-43 binding sites. These polymorphisms potentiate cryptic exon inclusion, both in cultured cells and in brains and spinal cords from patients with these conditions. Our findings, which demonstrate a genetic link between loss of nuclear TDP-43 function and disease, reveal the mechanism by which UNC13A variants exacerbate the effects of decreased TDP-43 function. They further provide a promising therapeutic target for TDP-43 proteinopathies."
https://openalex.org/W4212966936,"Abstract Combinations of anti-cancer drugs can overcome resistance and provide new treatments 1,2 . The number of possible drug combinations vastly exceeds what could be tested clinically. Efforts to systematically identify active combinations and the tissues and molecular contexts in which they are most effective could accelerate the development of combination treatments. Here we evaluate the potency and efficacy of 2,025 clinically relevant two-drug combinations, generating a dataset encompassing 125 molecularly characterized breast, colorectal and pancreatic cancer cell lines. We show that synergy between drugs is rare and highly context-dependent, and that combinations of targeted agents are most likely to be synergistic. We incorporate multi-omic molecular features to identify combination biomarkers and specify synergistic drug combinations and their active contexts, including in basal-like breast cancer, and microsatellite-stable or KRAS -mutant colon cancer. Our results show that irinotecan and CHEK1 inhibition have synergistic effects in microsatellite-stable or KRAS – TP53 double-mutant colon cancer cells, leading to apoptosis and suppression of tumour xenograft growth. This study identifies clinically relevant effective drug combinations in distinct molecular subpopulations and is a resource to guide rational efforts to develop combinatorial drug treatments."
https://openalex.org/W4213452250,"Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are flashes of unknown physical origin1. The majority of FRBs have been seen only once, although some are known to generate multiple flashes2,3. Many models invoke magnetically powered neutron stars (magnetars) as the source of the emission4,5. Recently, the discovery6 of another repeater (FRB 20200120E) was announced, in the direction of the nearby galaxy M81, with four potential counterparts at other wavelengths6. Here we report observations that localized the FRB to a globular cluster associated with M81, where it is 2 parsecs away from the optical centre of the cluster. Globular clusters host old stellar populations, challenging FRB models that invoke young magnetars formed in a core-collapse supernova. We propose instead that FRB 20200120E originates from a highly magnetized neutron star formed either through the accretion-induced collapse of a white dwarf, or the merger of compact stars in a binary system7. Compact binaries are efficiently formed inside globular clusters, so a model invoking them could also be responsible for the observed bursts."
https://openalex.org/W4213420153,"Treatment of bacterial infections currently focuses on choosing an antibiotic that matches a pathogen's susceptibility, with less attention paid to the risk that even susceptibility-matched treatments can fail as a result of resistance emerging in response to treatment. Combining whole-genome sequencing of 1113 pre- and posttreatment bacterial isolates with machine-learning analysis of 140,349 urinary tract infections and 7365 wound infections, we found that treatment-induced emergence of resistance could be predicted and minimized at the individual-patient level. Emergence of resistance was common and driven not by de novo resistance evolution but by rapid reinfection with a different strain resistant to the prescribed antibiotic. As most infections are seeded from a patient's own microbiota, these resistance-gaining recurrences can be predicted using the patient's past infection history and minimized by machine learning-personalized antibiotic recommendations, offering a means to reduce the emergence and spread of resistant pathogens."

https://openalex.org/W4213413570,"Multiferroic materials have garnered wide interest for their exceptional static and dynamical magnetoelectric properties. In particular, type-II multiferroics exhibit an inversion-symmetry-breaking magnetic order which directly induces a ferroelectric polarization through various mechanisms, such as the spin-current or the inverse Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya effect. This intrinsic coupling between the magnetic and dipolar order parameters results in record-strength magnetoelectric effects. Two dimensional materials possessing such intrinsic multiferroic properties have been long sought for harnessing magnetoelectric coupling in nanoelectronic devices. Here, we report the discovery of type-II multiferroic order in a single atomic layer of the transition metal-based van der Waals material NiI2. The multiferroic state of NiI2 is characterized by a proper-screw spin helix with given handedness, which couples to the charge degrees of freedom to produce a chirality-controlled electrical polarization. We use circular dichroic Raman measurements to directly probe the magneto-chiral ground state and its electromagnon modes originating from dynamic magnetoelectric coupling. Using birefringence and second-harmonic generation measurements, we detect a highly anisotropic electronic state simultaneously breaking three-fold rotational and inversion symmetry, and supporting polar order. The evolution of the optical signatures as a function of temperature and layer number surprisingly reveals an ordered magnetic, polar state that persists down to the ultrathin limit of monolayer NiI2. These observations establish NiI2 and transition metal dihalides as a new platform for studying emergent multiferroic phenomena, chiral magnetic textures and ferroelectricity in the two-dimensional limit."
https://openalex.org/W4213451752,"The lattice symmetry of a crystal is one of the most important factors in determining its physical properties. Particularly, low-symmetry crystals offer powerful opportunities to control light propagation, polarization and phase1-4. Materials featuring extreme optical anisotropy can support a hyperbolic response, enabling coupled light-matter interactions, also known as polaritons, with highly directional propagation and compression of light to deeply sub-wavelength scales5. Here we show that monoclinic crystals can support hyperbolic shear polaritons, a new polariton class arising in the mid-infrared to far-infrared due to shear phenomena in the dielectric response. This feature emerges in materials in which the dielectric tensor cannot be diagonalized, that is, in low-symmetry monoclinic and triclinic crystals in which several oscillators with non-orthogonal relative orientations contribute to the optical response6,7. Hyperbolic shear polaritons complement previous observations of hyperbolic phonon polaritons in orthorhombic1,3,4 and hexagonal8,9 crystal systems, unveiling new features, such as the continuous evolution of their propagation direction with frequency, tilted wavefronts and asymmetric responses. The interplay between diagonal loss and off-diagonal shear phenomena in the dielectric response of these materials has implications for new forms of non-Hermitian and topological photonic states. We anticipate that our results will motivate new directions for polariton physics in low-symmetry materials, which include geological minerals10, many common oxides11 and organic crystals12, greatly expanding the material base and extending design opportunities for compact photonic devices."
https://openalex.org/W4213432262,"Abstract The sensing of gravity has emerged as a tool in geophysics applications such as engineering and climate research 1–3 , including the monitoring of temporal variations in aquifers 4 and geodesy 5 . However, it is impractical to use gravity cartography to resolve metre-scale underground features because of the long measurement times needed for the removal of vibrational noise 6 . Here we overcome this limitation by realizing a practical quantum gravity gradient sensor. Our design suppresses the effects of micro-seismic and laser noise, thermal and magnetic field variations, and instrument tilt. The instrument achieves a statistical uncertainty of 20 E (1 E = 10 −9 s −2 ) and is used to perform a 0.5-metre-spatial-resolution survey across an 8.5-metre-long line, detecting a 2-metre tunnel with a signal-to-noise ratio of 8. Using a Bayesian inference method, we determine the centre to ±0.19 metres horizontally and the centre depth as (1.89 −0.59/+2.3) metres. The removal of vibrational noise enables improvements in instrument performance to directly translate into reduced measurement time in mapping. The sensor parameters are compatible with applications in mapping aquifers and evaluating impacts on the water table 7 , archaeology 8–11 , determination of soil properties 12 and water content 13 , and reducing the risk of unforeseen ground conditions in the construction of critical energy, transport and utilities infrastructure 14 , providing a new window into the underground."

https://openalex.org/W4214658365,"Catalytic deracemization of α-branched aldehydes is a direct strategy to construct enantiopure α-tertiary carbonyls, which are essential to pharmaceutical applications. Here, we report a photochemical E/Z isomerization strategy for the deracemization of α-branched aldehydes by using simple aminocatalysts and readily available photosensitizers. A variety of racemic α-branched aldehydes could be directly transformed into either enantiomer with high selectivity. Rapid photodynamic E/Z isomerization and highly stereospecific iminium/enamine tautomerization are two key factors that underlie the enantioenrichment. This study presents a distinctive photochemical E/Z isomerization strategy for externally tuning enamine catalysis."
https://openalex.org/W4213447786,"Two-dimensional materials with monolayer thickness and extreme aspect ratios are sought for their high surface areas and unusual physicochemical properties1. Liquid exfoliation is a straightforward and scalable means of accessing such materials2, but has been restricted to sheets maintained by strong covalent, coordination or ionic interactions3-10. The exfoliation of molecular crystals, in which repeat units are held together by weak non-covalent bonding, could generate a greatly expanded range of two-dimensional crystalline materials with diverse surfaces and structural features. However, at first sight, these weak forces would seem incapable of supporting such intrinsically fragile morphologies. Against this expectation, we show here that crystals composed of discrete supramolecular coordination complexes can be exfoliated by sonication to give free-standing monolayers approximately 2.3 nanometres thick with aspect ratios up to approximately 2,500:1, sustained purely by apolar intermolecular interactions. These nanosheets are characterized by atomic force microscopy and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, confirming their crystallinity. The monolayers possess complex chiral surfaces derived partly from individual supramolecular coordination complex components but also from interactions with neighbours. In this respect, they represent a distinct type of material in which molecular components are all equally exposed to their environment, as if in solution, yet with properties arising from cooperation between molecules, because of crystallinity. This unusual nature is reflected in the molecular recognition properties of the materials, which bind carbohydrates with strongly enhanced enantiodiscrimination relative to individual molecules or bulk three-dimensional crystals."
https://openalex.org/W4213422795,"Bombardment of materials by high-energy particles often leads to light emission in a process known as scintillation. Scintillation has widespread applications in medical imaging, x-ray nondestructive inspection, electron microscopy, and high-energy particle detectors. Most research focuses on finding materials with brighter, faster, and more controlled scintillation. We developed a unified theory of nanophotonic scintillators that accounts for the key aspects of scintillation: energy loss by high-energy particles, and light emission by non-equilibrium electrons in nanostructured optical systems. We then devised an approach based on integrating nanophotonic structures into scintillators to enhance their emission, obtaining nearly an order-of-magnitude enhancement in both electron-induced and x-ray-induced scintillation. Our framework should enable the development of a new class of brighter, faster, and higher-resolution scintillators with tailored and optimized performance."
https://openalex.org/W4213435196,"Abstract Nonlinear, multiplication-like operations carried out by individual nerve cells greatly enhance the computational power of a neural system 1–3 , but our understanding of their biophysical implementation is scant. Here we pursue this problem in the Drosophila melanogaster ON motion vision circuit 4,5 , in which we record the membrane potentials of direction-selective T4 neurons and of their columnar input elements 6,7 in response to visual and pharmacological stimuli in vivo. Our electrophysiological measurements and conductance-based simulations provide evidence for a passive supralinear interaction between two distinct types of synapse on T4 dendrites. We show that this multiplication-like nonlinearity arises from the coincidence of cholinergic excitation and release from glutamatergic inhibition. The latter depends on the expression of the glutamate-gated chloride channel GluClα 8,9 in T4 neurons, which sharpens the directional tuning of the cells and shapes the optomotor behaviour of the animals. Interacting pairs of shunting inhibitory and excitatory synapses have long been postulated as an analogue approximation of a multiplication, which is integral to theories of motion detection 10,11 , sound localization 12 and sensorimotor control 13 ."
https://openalex.org/W4220920955,"Abstract Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified thousands of genetic variants linked to the risk of human disease. However, GWAS have so far remained largely underpowered in relation to identifying associations in the rare and low-frequency allelic spectrum and have lacked the resolution to trace causal mechanisms to underlying genes 1 . Here we combined whole-exome sequencing in 392,814 UK Biobank participants with imputed genotypes from 260,405 FinnGen participants (653,219 total individuals) to conduct association meta-analyses for 744 disease endpoints across the protein-coding allelic frequency spectrum, bridging the gap between common and rare variant studies. We identified 975 associations, with more than one-third being previously unreported. We demonstrate population-level relevance for mutations previously ascribed to causing single-gene disorders, map GWAS associations to likely causal genes, explain disease mechanisms, and systematically relate disease associations to levels of 117 biomarkers and clinical-stage drug targets. Combining sequencing and genotyping in two population biobanks enabled us to benefit from increased power to detect and explain disease associations, validate findings through replication and propose medical actionability for rare genetic variants. Our study provides a compendium of protein-coding variant associations for future insights into disease biology and drug discovery."
https://openalex.org/W4213096651,"Abstract Colibactin is a chemically unstable small-molecule genotoxin that is produced by several different bacteria, including members of the human gut microbiome 1,2 . Although the biological activity of colibactin has been extensively investigated in mammalian systems 3 , little is known about its effects on other microorganisms. Here we show that colibactin targets bacteria that contain prophages, and induces lytic development through the bacterial SOS response. DNA, added exogenously, protects bacteria from colibactin, as does expressing a colibactin resistance protein (ClbS) in non-colibactin-producing cells. The prophage-inducing effects that we observe apply broadly across different phage–bacteria systems and in complex communities. Finally, we identify bacteria that have colibactin resistance genes but lack colibactin biosynthetic genes. Many of these bacteria are infected with predicted prophages, and we show that the expression of their ClbS homologues provides immunity from colibactin-triggered induction. Our study reveals a mechanism by which colibactin production could affect microbiomes and highlights a role for microbial natural products in influencing population-level events such as phage outbreaks."
https://openalex.org/W4213437949,"The nascent polypeptide-associated complex (NAC) interacts with newly synthesized proteins at the ribosomal tunnel exit and competes with the signal recognition particle (SRP) to prevent mistargeting of cytosolic and mitochondrial polypeptides to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). How NAC antagonizes SRP and how this is overcome by ER targeting signals are unknown. Here, we found that NAC uses two domains with opposing effects to control SRP access. The core globular domain prevented SRP from binding to signal-less ribosomes, whereas a flexibly attached domain transiently captured SRP to permit scanning of nascent chains. The emergence of an ER-targeting signal destabilized NAC's globular domain and facilitated SRP access to the nascent chain. These findings elucidate how NAC hands over the signal sequence to SRP and imparts specificity of protein localization."
https://openalex.org/W4220963742,"In development, lineage segregation is coordinated in time and space. An important example is the mammalian inner cell mass, in which the primitive endoderm (PrE, founder of the yolk sac) physically segregates from the epiblast (EPI, founder of the fetus). While the molecular requirements have been well studied, the physical mechanisms determining spatial segregation between EPI and PrE remain elusive. Here, we investigate the mechanical basis of EPI and PrE sorting. We find that rather than the differences in static cell surface mechanical parameters as in classical sorting models, it is the differences in surface fluctuations that robustly ensure physical lineage sorting. These differential surface fluctuations systematically correlate with differential cellular fluidity, which we propose together constitute a non-equilibrium sorting mechanism for EPI and PrE lineages. By combining experiments and modeling, we identify cell surface dynamics as a key factor orchestrating the correct spatial segregation of the founder embryonic lineages."
https://openalex.org/W4213013325,"The Cretaceous-Palaeogene mass extinction around 66 million years ago was triggered by the Chicxulub asteroid impact on the present-day Yucatán Peninsula1,2. This event caused the highly selective extinction that eliminated about 76% of species3,4, including all non-avian dinosaurs, pterosaurs, ammonites, rudists and most marine reptiles. The timing of the impact and its aftermath have been studied mainly on millennial timescales, leaving the season of the impact unconstrained. Here, by studying fishes that died on the day the Mesozoic era ended, we demonstrate that the impact that caused the Cretaceous-Palaeogene mass extinction took place during boreal spring. Osteohistology together with stable isotope records of exceptionally preserved perichondral and dermal bones in acipenseriform fishes from the Tanis impact-induced seiche deposits5 reveal annual cyclicity across the final years of the Cretaceous period. Annual life cycles, including seasonal timing and duration of reproduction, feeding, hibernation and aestivation, vary strongly across latest Cretaceous biotic clades. We postulate that the timing of the Chicxulub impact in boreal spring and austral autumn was a major influence on selective biotic survival across the Cretaceous-Palaeogene boundary."
https://openalex.org/W4213422428,"The observational signatures of black holes in x-ray binary systems depend on their masses, spins, accretion rate, and the misalignment angle between the black hole spin and the orbital angular momentum. We present optical polarimetric observations of the black hole x-ray binary MAXI J1820+070, from which we constrain the position angle of the binary orbital. Combining this with previous determinations of the relativistic jet orientation, which traces the black hole spin, and the inclination of the orbit, we determine a lower limit of 40° on the spin-orbit misalignment angle. The misalignment must originate from either the binary evolution or black hole formation stages. If other x-ray binaries have similarly large misalignments, these would bias measurements of black hole masses and spins from x-ray observations."

Although the effectiveness of face masks to prevent the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is debated, no study has evaluated the virus-blocking efficacy of masks used by patients. We aimed to evaluate this efficacy of masks used by SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals. Data, masks used, and nasopharyngeal swab samples were obtained from these patients. Forty-five paired samples of nasopharyngeal swabs and masks were obtained and processed; the majority of masks were woven. Viral RNAs were amplified using quantitative reverse‐transcription polymerase chain reaction and detected only on the inner parts of masks. Median viral load (VL) values of swabs and masks were 1.954x10 6 and 2,51x10 3 , respectively. Statistically, there was a difference of approximately 1000 RNA copies/mL between swabs and masks and no significant difference in VL values among different types of masks. There were statistically significant differences in VL values between men and women and between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. Our findings suggest the blocking of virus transmission by different types of masks and reinforce the use of masks by both infected and non-infected individuals."

https://openalex.org/W4213427173,"Warming-induced global water cycle changes pose a significant challenge to global ecosystems and human society. However, quantifying historical water cycle change is difficult owing to a dearth of direct observations, particularly over the ocean, where 77% and 85% of global precipitation and evaporation occur, respectively1-3. Air-sea fluxes of freshwater imprint on ocean salinity such that mean salinity is lowest in the warmest and coldest parts of the ocean, and is highest at intermediate temperatures4. Here we track salinity trends in the warm, salty fraction of the ocean, and quantify the observed net poleward transport of freshwater in the Earth system from 1970 to 2014. Over this period, poleward freshwater transport from warm to cold ocean regions has occurred at a rate of 34-62 milli-sverdrups (mSv = 103 m3 s-1), a rate that is not replicated in the current generation of climate models (the Climate Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6)). In CMIP6 models, surface freshwater flux intensification in warm ocean regions leads to an approximately equivalent change in ocean freshwater content, with little impact from ocean mixing and circulation. Should this partition of processes hold for the real world, the implication is that the historical surface flux amplification is weaker (0.3-4.6%) in CMIP6 compared with observations (3.0-7.4%). These results establish a historical constraint on poleward freshwater transport that will assist in addressing biases in climate models."
https://openalex.org/W4214706521,"The transmembrane protease angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a protective regulator within the renin angiotensin system and additionally represents the cellular receptor for SARS-CoV. The release of soluble ACE2 (sACE2) from the cell surface is hence believed to be a crucial part of its (patho)physiological functions, as both, ACE2 protease activity and SARS-CoV binding ability, are transferred from the cell membrane to body fluids. Yet, the molecular sources of sACE2 are still not completely investigated. In this study, we show different sources and prerequisites for the release of sACE2 from the cell membrane. By using inhibitors as well as CRISPR/Cas9-derived cells, we demonstrated that, in addition to the metalloprotease ADAM17, also ADAM10 is an important novel shedding protease of ACE2. Moreover, we observed that ACE2 can also be released in extracellular vesicles. The degree of either ADAM10- or ADAM17-mediated ACE2 shedding is dependent on stimulatory conditions and on the expression level of the pro-inflammatory ADAM17 regulator iRhom2. Finally, by using structural analysis and in vitro verification, we determined for the first time that the susceptibility to ADAM10- and ADAM17-mediated shedding is mediated by the collectrin-like part of ACE2. Overall, our findings give novel insights into sACE2 release by several independent molecular mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W4213435310,"The radioresistance induced by hypoxia is the major obstacle in the successful treatment of cancer radiotherapy. p21 was initially identified as a widespread inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases, through which mediates the p53-dependent cell cycle G1 phase arrest in response to a variety of stress stimuli. In this study, we discovered a novel function of p21, which participated in the regulation of metabolic pathways under hypoxia. We found that p21 was upregulated in glioblastoma (GBM) cells under hypoxic conditions, which enhanced the radioresistance of GBM cells. In principle, HIF-1α is bound directly to the hypoxia response elements (HREs) of the p21 promoter to enhance its transcription activity, in turn, p21 also promoted the transcription of HIF-1α at the mRNA level and maintained HIF-1α function under oxygen deficiency. The positive correlation between p21 and HIF-1α augmented Glut1/LDHA-mediated glycolysis and aggravated the radioresistance of GBM cells. Thus, our results constructed a positive feedback circuit comprising p21/HIF-1α that might play a key role in enhancing the radioresistance of GBM under hypoxia."
https://openalex.org/W4212991432,"Bone abnormalities affect all individuals with Down syndrome (DS) and are linked to abnormal expression of DYRK1A, a gene found in three copies in people with DS and Ts65Dn DS model mice. Previous work in Ts65Dn male mice demonstrated that both genetic normalization of Dyrk1a and treatment with ~9 mg/kg/day Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), the main polyphenol found in green tea and putative DYRK1A inhibitor, improved some skeletal deficits. Because EGCG treatment improved mostly trabecular skeletal deficits, we hypothesized that increasing EGCG treatment dosage and length of administration would positively affect both trabecular and cortical bone in Ts65Dn mice. Treatment of individuals with DS with green tea extract (GTE) containing EGCG also showed some weight loss in individuals with DS, and we hypothesized that weights would be affected in Ts65Dn mice after EGCG treatment. Treatment with ~20 mg/kg/day EGCG for seven weeks showed no improvements in male Ts65Dn trabecular bone and only limited improvements in cortical measures. Comparing skeletal analyses after ~20mg/kg/day EGCG treatment with previously published treatments with ~9, 50, and 200 mg/kg/day EGCG showed that increased dosage and treatment time increased cortical structural deficits leading to weaker appendicular bones in male mice. Weight was not affected by treatment in mice, except for those given a high dose of EGCG by oral gavage. These data indicate that high doses of EGCG, similar to those reported in some treatment studies of DS and other disorders, may impair long bone structure and strength. Skeletal phenotypes should be monitored when high doses of EGCG are administered therapeutically."
https://openalex.org/W4225985689,"Hybrid species have more genetic diversity than their parents. However, the impact of the hybrid genome of reciprocal crosses on brain function remains largely unknown. We performed behavioral, molecular, and neuronal analyses on C57BL/6J mice (B6), CAST/EiJ mice (CAST), and hybrid mice resulting from reciprocal crosses of the two strains, B6/CAST F1i and B6/CAST F1r, respectively. Hybrid mice displayed greater motor strength and coordination, food grinding, social dominance, and less sociability compared to their parental strains. Parental origin influenced body weight, locomotor speed, and heat nociception of hybrid mice. Parental origin, cell type, and the interaction of both affected expression patterns of hybrid genomes including imprinted genes. There was a correlation between affected genes and corresponding behavioral phenotypes. Hybrid genomes mediated neuronal activity in the locus coeruleus, a brain region implicated in arousal, adaptive behaviors, and sleep-wake cycle due to its norepinephrine projections throughout the central nervous system. The comprehensive brain phenotypes in these hybrid mice reveal important functional readouts associated with interactions of hybrid genomes and impacts of parental genomes."
https://openalex.org/W4226127718,"The DNA damage response (DDR) pathway is critical for maintaining genomic integrity and sustaining organismal development. Viruses can either utilize or circumvent the DDR to facilitate their replication. Pseudorabies virus (PRV) infection was shown to induce apoptosis via stimulating DDR. However, the underlying mechanisms have not been fully explored to date. This study showed that PRV infection robustly activates the ATM and DNA-PK signaling pathways shortly after infection. However, inhibition of ATM, but not DNA-PK, could dampen PRV replication in cells. Importantly, we found that PRV-encoded serine/threonine kinase UL13 interacts with and subsequently phosphorylates H2AX. Furthermore, we found that UL13 deletion largely attenuates PRV neuroinvasiveness and virulence in vivo. In addtion, we showed that UL13 contributes to H2AX phosphorylation upon PRV infection both in vitro and in vivo, but does not affect ATM phosphorylation. Finally, we showed that knockdown of H2AX reduces PRV replication, while this reduction can be further enhanced by deletion of UL13. Taken together, we conclude that PRV-encoded kinase UL13 regulates DNA damage marker γH2AX and UL13-mediated H2AX phosphorylation plays a pivotal role in efficient PRV replication and progeny production."
https://openalex.org/W4213006661,"Brain-computer interfaces (BCI) can be designed with several feedback modalities. To promote appropriate brain plasticity in therapeutic applications, the feedback should guide the user to elicit the desired brain activity and preferably be similar to the imagined action. In this study, we employed magnetoencephalography (MEG) to measure neurophysiological changes in healthy subjects performing motor imagery (MI) -based BCI training with two different feedback modalities. The MI-BCI task used in this study lasted 40-60 min and involved imagery of right- or left-hand movements. 8 subjects performed the task with visual and 14 subjects with proprioceptive feedback. We analysed power changes across the session at multiple frequencies in the range of 4-40 Hz with a generalized linear model to find those frequencies at which the power increased significantly during training. In addition, the power increase was analysed for each gradiometer, separately for alpha (8-13 Hz), beta (14-30 Hz) and gamma (30-40 Hz) bands, to find channels showing significant linear power increase over the session. These analyses were applied during three different conditions: rest, preparation, and MI. Visual feedback enhanced the amplitude of mainly high beta and gamma bands (24-40 Hz) in all conditions in occipital and left temporal channels. During proprioceptive feedback, in contrast, power increased mainly in alpha and beta bands. The alpha-band enhancement was found in multiple parietal, occipital, and temporal channels in all conditions, whereas the beta-band increase occurred during rest and preparation mainly in the parieto-occipital region and during MI in the parietal channels above hand motor regions. Our results show that BCI training with proprioceptive feedback increases the power of sensorimotor rhythms in the motor cortex, whereas visual feedback causes mainly a gamma-band increase in the visual cortex. MI-BCIs should involve proprioceptive feedback to facilitate plasticity in the motor cortex."

Model results revealed that neighborhood structural characteristics like concentrated disadvantage and racial makeup, as well as proximity to drug markets and police activity were associated with higher shooting rates. Neighborhood drug market activity and police activity significantly predicted changes in shooting rates over time after the onset of COVID-19. This work demonstrates the importance of understanding whether there are unique factors that impact the susceptibility to exogenous shocks like the COVID-19 pandemic. The increasing risk of being in a neighborhood with an active drug market during the pandemic suggests efforts related to disrupting drug organizations, or otherwise curbing violence stemming from drug markets, may go a long way towards quelling citywide increases in gun violence."
https://openalex.org/W4213355693,"Recent studies have demonstrated the epigenetic regulation of immune responses. However, the potential role of N6-methyladenosine methylation (m6A) in the tumor microenvironment (TME) remains unknown.In this study, the m6A modification patterns of LUAD samples were comprehensively evaluated by combining TCGA and GEO data, while these modification patterns were systematically linked to the characteristics of immune infiltrating cells in TME. The m6A score was constructed using the principal component analysis algorithm to quantify the m6A modification mode of a single tumor.There were three distinct patterns of m6A modification identified. The characteristics of TME cell infiltration in these three patterns were highly consistent with these three immune phenotypes of the tumors, including immune rejection, immune-inflammatory, and immune inert phenotypes. Low m6A scores were characterized by immune activation and poor survival rate. Besides, m6A scores were associated with tumor mutational load (TMB) and were able to increase the ability of TMB to predict immunotherapy. Two immunotherapy cohorts confirmed that the patients with lower m6A scores demonstrated significant therapeutic advantages and clinical benefits. m6A modifications play an important role in the development of TME diversity. Assessing the m6A modification pattern of individual tumors can deepen the understanding as to the characteristics of TME infiltration and guide more effective immunotherapy strategies."

https://openalex.org/W4213123343,"At a time when vocational education is seen as critical for national development, concern grows regarding how weak organizational culture and occupational commitment may threaten the production of quality graduates and teachers within the field. The failure of vocational institutions to effectively create human capital likely threatens the connections between Chinese industry and its educational institutions. This study thus explores how these connections are influenced by organizational and occupational factors. A multi-layer linear model is employed on data collected from 406 teachers from 69 Chinese vocational colleges and universities. Results suggest that organizational cultural positively influences industry-university cooperative behavior through the construction of strong occupational commitment and job involvement. This study not only enriches and expands new knowledge and academic perspectives, but also provides feasible policy suggestions to help guide educational administrators toward the improvement of vocational education."
https://openalex.org/W4226254083,"Infertility is a social and medical problem around the world and the incidence continues to rise. Thin endometrium (TE) is a great challenge of infertility treatment, even by in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer. It is widely believed that TE impairs endometrium receptivity. However, only a few studies have explained the molecular mechanism. Herein, in order to reveal the possible mechanism, we sampled endometrium from a TE patient and a control volunteer and got a transcriptomic atlas of 18 775 individual cells which was constructed using single-cell RNA sequencing, and seven cell types have been identified. The cells were acquired during proliferative and secretory phases, respectively. The proportion of epithelial cells and stromal cells showed a significant difference between the TE group and the control group. In addition, differential expressed genes (DEGs) in diverse cell types were revealed, the enriched pathways of DEGs were found closely related to the protein synthesis in TE of both proliferative and secretory phases. Some DEGs can influence cell-type ratio and impaired endometrial receptivity in TE. Furthermore, divergent expression of estrogen receptors 1 and progesterone receptors in stromal and epithelial cells were compared in the TE sample from the control. The cellular and molecular heterogeneity found in this study provided valuable information for disclosing the mechanisms of impaired receptivity in TE."

https://openalex.org/W4221012193,"Previous work demonstrated that arginine is one of the strongest insulin secretagogues. However, knowledge of the mechanisms linking chronic arginine metabolism with β-cell function and insulin secretion is relatively limited. After preliminary selection of concentration according to the cell proliferation, the MIN6 pancreatic β-cells were randomly assigned to culture in 0.04 mM (low-arginine, LA), 0.4 mM (standard-arginine, SA), or 8 mM arginine (high-arginine, HA) for 24 h. Following the treatment, a combination of transcriptomics and metabolomics, together with a series of molecular biological tests were performed to investigate the responses of β-cells to varied arginine availability. Our results showed that HA treatment reduced the chronic insulin releases, and LA and HA treatments decreased the glucose-stimulated insulin secretions (GSIS) of β-cells relative to the SA group (p < .05). Transcriptomics analysis indicated that LA administration significantly inhibited oxidative phosphorylation and ATP metabolic process but promoted DNA repair and mRNA processing in β-cells, while HA administration affected ammonium ion metabolic process and mRNA export (p < .05). Both LA and HA regulated the expressions of genes involved in DNA replication, cell-cycle phase transition, and response to oxidative stress (p < .05). Protein-protein interaction and transcription factor analyses suggested that Trp53 and Nr4a2 genes may play key roles during arginine stimulation. On the contrary, metabolomics analysis demonstrated that the differentially expressed metabolites (DEM) of MIN6 β-cells induced by LA were mainly enriched in glycerophospholipid metabolism, linoleic acid metabolism, and purine metabolism, while most DEMs between LA vs. SA comparison belonged to amino acid metabolism. When combined the three groups, co-expression analysis suggested that insulin secretions had strong associations with L-pyroglutamic acid, L-glutamate, and creatine concentrations, while intracellular insulin contents were mainly correlated to L-arginine, argininosuccinic acid, and phosphorylcholine. At last, integrated analysis of transcriptomics and metabolomics showed that glycerophospholipid metabolism, biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids, and amino acid metabolism were the most relevant pathways in β-cells exposed to abnormal arginine supply. This descriptive bioinformatics analysis suggested that the disturbed carbohydrate, lipid, and amino acid metabolisms, as well as the increased apoptosis and elevated oxidative stress, contributed to the reduced insulin secretion and lower GSIS in β-cells induced by LA or HA treatments, while some underlying mechanisms need to be further explored."
https://openalex.org/W4213183421,"Increasing evidence highlights the role of bacteria in the physiopathology of cancer. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remains poorly understood. Several cancer-associated bacteria have been shown to produce toxins which interfere with the host defense against tumorigenesis. Here, we show that lipopolysaccharides from Klebsiella pneumoniae and other Enterobacteria strongly inhibit the host tumor suppressor p53 pathway through a novel mechanism of p53 regulation. We found that lipopolysaccharides destabilize TP53 mRNA through a TLR4-NF-κB-mediated inhibition of the RNA-binding factor Wig-1. Importantly, we show that K. pneumoniae disables two major tumor barriers, oncogene-induced DNA damage signaling and senescence, by impairing p53 transcriptional activity upon DNA damage and oncogenic stress. Furthermore, we found an inverse correlation between the levels of TLR4 and p53 mutation in colorectal tumors. Hence, our data suggest that the repression of p53 by Enterobacteria via TLR4 alleviates the selection pressure for p53 oncogenic mutations and shapes the genomic evolution of cancer."
https://openalex.org/W4213447383,"GroES/GroEL is the only bacterial chaperone essential under all conditions, making it a potential antibiotic target. Rationally targeting ESKAPE GroES/GroEL as an antibiotic strategy necessitates studying their structure and function. Herein, we outline the structural similarities between Escherichia coli and ESKAPE GroES/GroEL and identify significant differences in intra- and inter-ring cooperativity, required in the refolding cycle of client polypeptides. Previously, we observed that one-half of ESKAPE GroES/GroEL family members could not support cell viability when each was individually expressed in GroES/GroEL-deficient E. coli cells. Cell viability was found to be dependent on the allosteric compatibility between ESKAPE and E. coli subunits within mixed (E. coli and ESKAPE) tetradecameric GroEL complexes. Interestingly, differences in allostery did not necessarily result in differences in refolding rate for a given homotetradecameric chaperonin. Characterization of ESKAPE GroEL allostery, ATPase, and refolding rates in this study will serve to inform future studies focused on inhibitor design and mechanism of action studies."

https://openalex.org/W4214764589,"Matricellular proteins, a group of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, are key regulators of skin repair and their dysregulation impairs wound healing in diabetes. Tubulointerstitial nephritis antigen like 1 (TINAGL1) is a new member of matricellular protein family, and the understanding of its functional role is still relatively limited. In the current study, we detected the expression of TINAGL1 in diabetic skin wound tissues through RT-PCR, ELISA and Western blot analysis, investigated the contribution of TINAGL1 to wound healing through cutaneous administration of recombinant TINAGL1 protein, and characterized its regulation by hyperglycemia through RNA-seq and signal pathway inhibition assay. We showed that TINAGL1 expression has dynamic change and reaching a peak on day-9 after wound during the wound healing process in wild-type (WT) mice. Interestingly, decreased TINAGL1 expression is detected in skin tissues of diabetic patients and mice after wound. Then, we found that high glucose (HG), an important factor that impairs wound healing, reduces the expression of TINAGL1 in fibroblasts through JNK pathway. Notably, the histology analysis, Masson trichrome assay and IHC assay showed that exogenous TINAGL1 promotes wound healing in diabetic mice by accelerating the formation of granulation tissues. Our study provides evidence that TINAGL1 has an essential role in diabetic wound healing, and meanwhile, indicates that manipulation of TINAGL1 might be a possible therapeutic approach."
