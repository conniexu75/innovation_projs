https://openalex.org/W1797215313,"Extracts of aerobically grown Escherichia coli B exhibit both catalase and dianisidine peroxidase activities. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis demonstrates two distinct catalases which have been designated hydroperoxidases I and II (HP-I and HP-II) in order of increasing anodic mobility. HP-I has been purified to essential homogeneity and found to be composed of four subunits of equal size. Its molecular weight is 337,000, and it contains two molecules of protoheme IX per tetramer. Its amino acid composition is unusual, for so large a protein, in lacking half-cystine. HP-I is a very efficient catalase with an activity optimum at pH 7.5, a Km for H2O2 of 3.9 mM, and a turnover number of 9.8 x 10(5) per min. It is also a broad specificity peroxidase capable of acting upon dianisidine, guaiacol, p-phenylenediamine, and pyrogallol. Dianisidine acted as a powerful reversible inhibitor of the catalatic activity of HP-I and as a suicide substrate when HP-I functioned in its peroxidatic mode."

Likewise, GnRH analogs inhibited FSH-induced changes in ovarian function in hypophysectomized rats in vivo. These results indicate that GnRH, in addition to its well-known gonadotropin-releasing action in the pituitary, exerts a direct inhibition of ovarian steroidogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1583993235,"Nitrofurazone is shown to undergo an initial 1-electron (oxygen-sensitive) or 2- or more electron (oxygen-insensitive) reduction by partially purified nitroreductases from Escherichia coli. Nitrofurazone (50 micronM) is reduced by the oxygen-sensitive reductase to a nitro anion free radical as indicated by ESR and visible spectroscopy. The visible spectrum of the nitro anion free radical is characterized by an increase in absorption at 406 nm. In the presence of the oxygen-sensitive reductase, nitrofurazone stimulates superoxide formation and oxygen consumption. This enzyme gives a steady state radical concentration which is proportional to the square root of the enzyme concentration, suggesting that the nitrofurazone anion radical is an obligate intermediate in the reduction and that the radical decays by a nonenzymatic second order process. The oxygen-insensitive reductase does not form the nitro anion free radical nor in the presence of nitrofurazone does it stimulate oxygen consumption. Visible spectroscopy shows that nitrofurazone is reduced by the oxygen-sensitive reductase to a species with an absorption maximum at 335 nm, which has been previously identified as the amine. The oxygen-insensitive reductase reduces nitrofurazone to a previously identified cyano derivative with an absorption maximum at 280 nm. Rat hepatic microsomes appear to metabolize nitrofurazone in a manner similar to the oxygen-sensitive E. coli reductase."

https://openalex.org/W2080562049,"The two finest, most respirable coal fly ash fractions collected from the smokestack of a power plant were more mutagenic than two coarser fractions. Mutagenicity was evaluated in the histidine-requiring bacterial strains TA 1538, TA 98, and TA 100 of Salmonella typhimurium. Ash samples collected from the hoppers of an electrostatic precipitator in the plant were not mutagenic. The mutagens in coal fly ash were resistant to x-ray or ultraviolet irradiation, possibly as a result of stabilization by fly ash surfaces. All mutagenic activity is lost with heating to 350 degrees C."
https://openalex.org/W1553518074,"The guanine insertion enzyme isolated from Escherichia coli (tRNA transglycosylase) catalyzed the incorporation of bases of Q (queuosine) precursors into E. coli undermodified tRNAAsn and tRNATyr. These bases of Q precursors were inserted in the first position of the anticodon of tRNASn and tRNATyr, replacing guanine originally located in that position. This is a novel type of post-transcriptional modification, inserting a modified base into the polynucleotide chain by cleavage of the N–C glycoside bond without breakage of the phosphodiester bond. One of the bases of Q precursors, 7-(aminomethyl)-7-deazaguanine, was found in the acid-soluble fraction of E. coli cells, supporting the conclusion that formation of Q, 7-(3,4-trans-4,5-cis-dihydroxy-1-cyclopenten-3-ylaminomethyl)-7-deazaguanosine, in tRNA in vivo actually proceeds by the tRNA transglycosylase reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1497535423,"Glutamine 5-phosphoribosylamine:pyrophosphate phosphoribosyltransferase (amidophosphoribosyl-transferase) has been purified to homogeneity from Escherichia coli. The molecular weight of the native enzyme was 194,000 by sedimentation equilibrium centrifugation and 224,000 by gel filtration. A subunit Mr = 57,000 was estimated by gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate. Cross-linking experiments gave species of Mr = 57,000, 117,000, and 177,000. A trimer or tetramer of identical subunits is indicated for the native enzyme. Highly active E. coli amidophosphoribosyl-transferase lacks significant nonheme iron. Enzyme activity was not enhanced by addition of iron salts and sulfide. Amidophosphoribosyltransferase exhibited both NH3- and glutamine-dependent activities. Glutaminase activity was detected in the absence of other substrates. Both glutamine- and NH3-dependent activities were subject to end product inhibition by purine 5'-ribonucleotides. AMP and GMP, in combination, gave synergistic inhibition. AMP and GMP exhibited positive cooperativity. In addition, GMP promoted cooperativity for saturation by 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate. Glutamine utilization was inhibited by NH3, suggesting that the amide of glutamine is transferred to the NH3 site prior to amination of 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate. The glutamine-dependent activity was selectively inactivated by the glutamine analogs L-2-amino-4-oxo-5-chloropentanoic acid and 6-diazo-5-oxo L-norleucine (DON) and by iodoacetamide. Incorporation of 1 eq of DON/subunit (Mr = 57,000) caused complete inactivation of the glutamine-dependent activity, thus providing evidence for one glutamine site per monomer and for the functional identity of the subunits. Following alkylation with iodoacetamide, carboxymethylcysteine was the only modified amino acid isolated from an acid hydrolysate. The glutamine-dependent activity was sensitive to oxidation. Inactivation by exposure to air was reversed by incubation with high concentrations of dithiothreitol."
https://openalex.org/W8122375,"The transducing phages lambdadaroE and lambdadilv5, which carry the Escherichia coli ribosomal RNA operons rrnD and rrnX, respectively, have been mapped with the restriction endonucleases BamHI, EcoRI, HindIII, and Sma I. Using hybridization techniques, we have located the ribosomal RNA genes on these phage DNAs. The DNA sequence of the 437-base-pair 16 S-23 S ribosomal RNA intergenic spacer in the two rRNA operons rrnD and rrnX has been determined. The nucleotides examined exhibit only one base pair change between rrnD and rrnX. Both spacer regions contain the genes for tRNA1Ile and tRNA1BAla; the gene sequences are identical with the previously deduced tRNA sequences and are clustered within the first 60% of the spacer DNA. The most striking feature of the 16 S-23 S intergenic region in these two operons is the disparity in G-C content between the tRNA gene sequences (60% G-C) and the remaining spacer DNA (37% G-C). Spacer sequences are known to be involved in the processing of the ribosomal RNA transcript by RNase III and RNase P. In addition, we report the sequence of the first 108 base pairs of the 23 S rRNA gene."
https://openalex.org/W1495128066,"Abstract A cell-free protein-synthesizing system has been prepared from Saccharomyces cerevisiae by differential centrifugation of lysed spheroplasts. The preparation, a modified 100,000 x g supernatant fraction, contains ribosomes and monosomes, ribosomal subunits, translation factors, and aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, but no polysomes. After removal of small amounts of remaining mRNA with micrococcal nuclease, protein synthesis is stringently dependent on the addition of mRNA, as well as amino acids and an energy-generating system. The 5'-cap analogue, 7-methylguanosine 5'-phosphate, inhibits translation of several natural mRNAs, but has no effect on chain elongation. Incubation of the polysome-free extract with natural mRNA leads to the formation of protein-synthesizing polysomes and eventually, to the release of protein; the molecular weight of the protein synthesized in the presence of BMV (brome mosaic virus) RNA is consistent with that of BMV coat protein."
https://openalex.org/W1569080502,"Three DNA restriction fragments of established sequence containing the Escherichia coli lac genetic controlling regions were cloned. In each case a recombinant plasmid was constructed which was suitable for the subsequent large scale purification of the lac fragment. A 789-base pair HindII fragment, containing the lac operator, promoter, and cyclic AMP receptor protein binding site, was ligated into the single HindII site of the amplifiable plasmid minicolicin E1 DNA (pVH51). A 203-base pair Hae III fragment containing the same genetic sites was ligated into the single Eco RI site of pVH51 which had been filled in by the Micrococcus luteus DNA polymerase. Thus, the lac fragment was inserted between two Eco RI sites. Plasmids containing multiple copies of this Eco RI fragment were then constructed. A 95-base pair Alu I fragment containing the lac promoter and operator was cloned similarly. Also, the 203-base pair fragment was cloned into the Eco RI site of pVH51 using a 300-base pair linker fragment (isolated by RPC-5 column chromatography) which permitted retention of its Hae III ends. Mapping studies on pVH51 DNA with a number of DNA restriction endonucleases, including Alu I, Taq I, and Hpa II, are described."
https://openalex.org/W1606469152,"An endoproteolytic enzyme of Escherichia coli, designated protease III, has been purified about 9,600-fold to homogeneity with a 6% yield. The purified enzyme consists of a single polypeptide chain of Mr 110,000 and is most active at pH 7.4. Protease III is very sensitive to metal-chelating agents and reducing agents. The EDTA-inactivated enzyme can be reactivated by Zn2+, Co2+ or Mn2+. Protease III is devoid of activity toward aminopeptidase, carboxypeptidase, or esterase substrates but rapidly degrades small proteins. When fragments of beta-galactosidase are used as substrates for protease III, the enzyme preferentially degrades proteins with molecular weights of less than 7,000. Protease III cleaves the oxidized insulin B chain at two sites with an initial rapid cleavage at Tyr-Leu (16-17) and a second slower cut at Phe-Tyr (25-26)."
https://openalex.org/W1505900292,"The T4 bacteriophage gene 43 (T4 DNA polymerase), 32 (DNA helix-destabilizing protein), and 45 proteins and the complex of the gene 44 and 62 proteins are all required for DNA synthesis beginning at single-stranded breaks in duplex DNA. This synthesis occurs by strand displacement and is not dependent on ribonucleotides, the T4 gene 41 protein, or the T4 initiating protein, each of which is required to begin new chains on single-stranded templates. Electron microscopic analysis shows that duplex molecules with long single-stranded branches are the predominant products of this strand displacement synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1562164760,"The potential biological activity of benze(e)pyrene was investigated by a determination of the mutagenic activity of the polycyclic hydrocarbon and six of its derivatives in the absence and presence of a cytochrome P-450-dependent monooxygenase system. In the presence of hepatic microsomes from Aroclor 1254-pretreated rats or the cytochrome P-450-dependent monooxygenase system purified to near homogeneity from these microsomes, benzo(e)pyrene, and trans-9,10-dihydroxy-9,10,11,12-tetrahydrobenzo(e)pyrene were metabolized to products which had little or no mutagenic activity toward Salmonella typhimurium. Under the same assay conditions, the products formed from trans-4,5-dihydroxy-4,5-dihydrobenzo(e)pyrene had modest mutagenic activity. In contrast with these results, 9,10-dihydrobenzo(e)pyrene was metabolically activated to potent mutagenic products which were more active than the products formed from benzo(e)pyrene. The high intrinsic mutagenic activity of the chemically synthesized beings ring tetrahy-drospoxide of 9,10-dihydrobenzo(e)pyrene after metabolism was mediated by this bay region tetrahydroepoxide. Lack of formation of a benzo ring epoxide provides a rationale for the inability of 9,10-dihydroxy-9,10-dihydrobenzo(e)pyrene to be metabolically activated by rat liver enzymes to mutagenic products and may contribute to the low carcinogenic activity of benzo(e)pyrene in rodents."

https://openalex.org/W1540872215,"Abstract The proteins encoded by bacteriophage T4 genes 41, 45, 44, and 62 are known from the genetic studies of Epstein et al. ((1963) Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 28, 375--394) to be required for viral DNA synthesis. A convenient assay for each of these proteins is described which is based on the specific stimulation by each protein of DNA synthesis in extracts of Escherichia coli infected with mutants of bacteriophage T4 unable to make that protein. The T4 41 protein, 45 protein, and the complex of the 44 and 62 proteins have been highly purified. For each protein there is co-chromatography during the final purification step of (i) activity in the complementation assay, (ii) activity required for DNA synthesis with other purified T4 proteins, and (iii) a subunit of the size previously identified as that of the corresponding gene product."
https://openalex.org/W80227849,"The core protein produced by mild proteolytic digestion of lactose repressor protein has been purified from native repressor by chromatography on phosphocellulose. The core protein isolated in this manner binds to operator DNA with an apparent dissociation constant of 10(-7) M, and the observed binding is decreased by the presence of inducer. Competition studies with nonspecific DNA indicate that the binding species in the core protein preparations is neither intact lactose repressor nor mixed tetramers containing varying numbers of intact NH2-terminal regions. This conclusion is supported by experiments designed to measure the rate of dissociation of the core protein from the operator DNA. Calculations based on the assumption that the isolated core protein binds similarly to the corresponding region in intact repressor protein indicate that the core region contributes approximately 40 to 50% of the energy of binding to operator DNA. Furthermore, the change in operator affinity upon inducer binding to core accounts for a minimum of 60% of the free energy change in binding to operator observed for the native protein. The demonstration that core protein binds to operator DNA requires a re-evaluation of the various models for repressor binding to DNA. A possible model based on the available information is presented."
https://openalex.org/W1514925242,"Abstract We have prepared an affinity column for the purification of orotidine-5'-phosphate decarboxylase from yeast. The column effects a 3200-fold purification from yeast homogenate in one pass; simple additional steps produce enzyme that has been purified 6700-fold and is not contaminated by any other protein that can be detected by sodium dodecyl sulfate-acrylamide gel electrophoresis. Overall, 35% of the activity present in the yeast is recovered as pure enzyme. The resin for the column is synthesized by attaching the ethylenediamine amide of 5-(2-carboxyethyl)-6-azauridine 5'-phosphate to carboxymethyl-agarose."

Complementary DNA, synthesized from partially purified glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase messenger RNA, was used as a hybridization probe for cloning this gene. The isolated hybrid plasmid DNA has been mapped with restriction endonucleases and the location of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene within the cloned segment of yeast DNA has been established. There are approximately 4.5 kilobase pairs of DNA sequence flanking either side of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene in the cloned segment of yeast DNA. The isolated hybrid plasmid DNA has been used to selectively hybridize glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase messenger RNA from unfractionated yeast poly(adenylic acid)-containing messenger RNA. The nucleotide sequence of a portion of the isolated hybrid plasmid DNA has been determined. This nucleotide sequence encodes 29 amino acids which are at the COOH terminus of the known amino acid sequence of yeast glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase."
https://openalex.org/W1617529832,"Addition of divalent ion chelating agents picolinic acid, 1,10-phenanthroline, or quinoline-2-carboxylic acid to wild type, relA, or relX, but not spoT strains of Escherichia coli increases the levels of guanosine 5'-diphosphate 3'-diphosphate (ppGpp). Poorly chelating analogs of these agents and a larger and more highly charged chelating agent, ethylene glycol bis(beta-amino-ethyl ether) N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid are ineffective. Mn2+ reverses the increase in ppGpp. The increase in ppGpp in wild type cells can be explained by an inhibition of degradation. In spoT cells the response is more complex; ppGpp does not increase although degradation is completely inhibited. The lack of increase in spoT cells suggests a role for spoT in synthesis of ppGpp in addition to its known role in degradation. Growth of both spoT+ and spoT cells is inhibited following chelator addition. This suggests that growth inhibition is through a mechanism not directly involving ppGpp. The results of this study provide evidence in intact cells for a role for Mn2+ and the spoT gene product in ppGpp degradation, and provide further evidence for an involvement of spoT and possibly divalent ions in ppGpp synthesis."

https://openalex.org/W1568504683,"We describe a new method for quantitatively assaying the omega subunit of Escherichia coli RNA polymerase. The assay is based on the ability of RNA polymerase holoenzyme to catalyze the continuous synthesis of the dinucleotide pApU on a poly[d(A-T)] . poly[d(A-T)] template when supplied with AMP and UTP as substrates. Core enzyme, lacking omega subunit, catalyzed this reaction at a rate less than 1% that of holoenzyme. The omega subunit was not released from the enzyme/DNA complex during dinucleotide synthesis. Using this assay, a titration of a fixed concentration of core enzyme was observed with increasing concentrations of added omega subunit. Below a 1:1 omega:core ratio the measured activity increased linearly with omega concentration, whereas above a 1:1 ratio the activity remained constant. An immediate application of the assay is in determining the concentration of active omega, or equivalently of active holoenzyme, in any RNA polymerase preparation."

The results show that there are two transcription start sites for each rRNA operon in vivo, one initiating with ATP (or GTP), and the second initiating with CTP. Transcription from the first site was observed to be stronger than that from the second site. These two sites correspond to the two promoters identified in the previous in vitro studies, indicating that the two promoters are used in vivo. These results also demonstrate previously unrecognized transcription initiation with CTP in growing E. coli cells."
https://openalex.org/W1515666667,"Two fatty acyl amidases have been partially purified from the slime mold, Dictyostelium discoideum. Their action on lipopolysaccharide derivatives, especially Compound I, has been studied. Amidase I removes specifically the beta-hydroxymyristyl group, which is present on the amino group adjacent to the C-1 phosphate. The product, Compound V, is then a substrate for Amidase II, which removes the remaining beta-hydroxymyristyl group from the amino group in the distal glucosamine ring to give Compound VI. Compound I itself is resistant to Amidase II. Thus, the two enzymes show a high degree of structural specificity. The structure of lipopolysaccharide from the E. coli K-12 mutant is concluded in the light of studies reported in this and the accompanying papers, and this structure is discussed in relation to other bacterial lipopolysaccharides."
https://openalex.org/W1567384770,"The properties of the fractionated Hae III fragments of pRZ2 DNA (Patient, R.K., Hardies, S.C., and Wells, R.D. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 5542-5547) were studied in an effort to determine why several of the fragments bind more tightly to RPC-5 than expected on the basis of their length. The purified fragments were analyzed for their nucleotide composition by direct determination of their constituent mononucleotides and by analytical CsCl and Cs2SO4 density gradient analyses. A-T-rich fragments elute at higher salt concentrations than fragments of equivalent size which are not A-T-rich. In addition, denaturation mapping studies by electron microscopy indicate that an A-T-rich run within an otherwise G-C-rich fragment can give rise to delayed elution. At least one other factor influences the separation of DNA restriction fragments by RPC-5 chromatography. Some of the fragments in this digest which elute later than predicted from their size either contain known genetic regulatory sites or bind regulatory proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1503231586,"The uptake by rat yolk sacs of native invertase and invertase which was deglycosylated by treatment with endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase was compared. The initial rate of uptake of the deglycosylated enzyme was severalfold greater and its accumulation leveled off much earlier than that of the native enzyme. Uptake rates of the deglycosylated and native forms of the enzyme were proportional to their concentration in the medium in the range employed and were inhibited about 85% by 10(-6) M glucagon in both cases. After preloading of yolk sacs with native invertase, the tissue level of activity remained relatively constant over a subsequent 6-h time period, while with the deglycosylated form, activity declined substantially. Since this difference appears not to be attributable to differences in thermal stability, it is suggested that the deglycosylated form of the protein is more susceptible to intracellular proteolytic digestion. In vitro studies on the digestion of these two forms of invertase by trypsin are consistent with this suggestion."
https://openalex.org/W2007182676,"Explants of subcutaneous connective tissue from adult BALB/c mice into plastic petri dishes were serially subcultured and tested for tumorigenicity in two ways: by the subcutaneous implantation of cells attached to plastic plates (1 by 5 by 10 millimeters), and by the subcutaneous injection of cells suspended in saline. Cells grown in vitro for 18 or more days before being implanted attached to a plastic plate (2.4 x 104 to 3.4 × 105 cells per plate) formed tumors after 24 to 79 weeks. The latent period before tumor appearance correlated inversely with the time spent by the cells in tissue culture. Cells inoculated in saline suspension (10 to 100 times the above number per plate) did not form tumors until after 84 days in vitro; plates alone did not induce tumor formation within more than 1 1/2 years of implantation. The tumors arising from the plate-attached cells were transplantable without plates and histologically appeared to be undifferentiated sarcomas. It is well established that smooth-surfaced foreign bodies, regardless of their chemical composition, will produce sarcomas when transplanted subcutaneously in rodents. We interpret our data, particularly the decrease in tumor latent period with time spent in tissue culture, as indicating that a smooth surface was acting as a carcinogen first in vitro (the surface of the tissue culture dish) and then in vivo (the surface of the plastic plate)."

The reaction with repressor cysteine residues has been characterized. Approximately 2 of the 3 eq of cysteine/repressor monomer are reactive toward these reagents. Repressor cysteines are reactive toward these reagents in the order cysteine 140 greater than or equal to cysteine 107 greater than cysteine 281. The reaction is sulfhydryl-specific. Comparison of chemical modification data obtained in this laboratory using a variety of sulfhydryl-specific reagents has been used to assess chemical features of individual cysteine environments. Effects of the maleimide reagents on biological activity have been determined. Only the fluorophore N-(3-pyrene)maleimide has significant effect; this agent selectively perturbs repressor's ability to bind to operator DNA. This result suggests that regions of protein structure surrounding 1 or more of the cysteine residues possess determinants required for normal operator DNA binding."

https://openalex.org/W1593336110,"Abstract The purpose of these experiments was to determine whether insulin-related peptides, larger than proinsulin, could be detected in pancreatic islet cells. Catfish pancreatic islets were incubated with radiolabeled amino acids. After 15- to 60-min incubation, two acid-alcohol-extractable peptides, larger than proinsulin, were detected which were approximately of Mr = 12,000 and 11,000 (12 K and 11K, respectively). They migrated as single polypeptide chains by sodium dodecyl sulfate-urea polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions, and were therefore not aggregates of insulin or proinsulin. The 12 K protein had identical mobility with catfish preoproinsulin synthesized in a wheat germ cell-free system. On standard electrophoresis at pH 8.9, the 12 K protein migrated separately from proinsulin and was at least 65% one protein with two to three minor contaminants. The 12 K and 11 K proteins were chemically related to insulin and proinsulin as shown by tryptic peptide analysis, using cation exchange resin chromatography, and by two-dimensional tryptic peptide maps. Analysis of the tryptic digest of the 12 K protein, compared to proinsulin after leucine aminopeptidase treatment, suggested that the NH2 terminus of the larger protein was different from that of proinsulin. These peptides were specifically bound to anti-insulin antibody. The binding was only 5 to 8% of the protein added, but was specific for the 12 K and 11 K proteins when the immunoprecipitates were examined by electrophoresis and not from contaminating proinsulin. During the continuous incubation of the islets with [3H]leucine, 12 K and 11 K proteins were synthesized in the cell before proinsulin. When islets were first incubated with [3H]leucine for 30 min followed by incubation with excess unlabeled leucine, the 12 K and 11 K proteins appeared to show a precursor-product relationship to proinsulin and insulin. Even when total islet protein synthesis was inhibited by cycloheximide (100 microgram/ml), proinsulin continued to be synthesized for up to 2 h. This suggested that the conversion of the proinsulin precursors to proinsulin in the fish is a post-translational event."

https://openalex.org/W1514259279,"The effects of prior covalent cysteine modification or nonspecific DNA presence on the reaction of lac repressor protein with N-bromosuccinimide have been investigated. At low excesses, N-bromosuccinimide oxidation causes loss of operator DNA binding activity with simultaneous retention of inducer and nonspecific DNA binding activities. Cysteine and methionine are oxidized under the conditions utilized. Covalent modification of the cysteines of repressor prior to reaction decreased the observed loss of operator DNA binding capacity; the presence of nonspecific DNA partially prevented oxidation of the cysteines by N-bromosuccinimide, and concurrent protection of operator binding ability was observed. Methionine oxidation was observed in the cases where protection of the operator DNA binding capacity of repressor was seen. The region surrounding cysteine 107 was found to be influential in maintaining intact operator DNA binding function in repressor. This observation provides chemical evidence for the contribution of the core region of repressor in determining specificity of the protein in binding the lac operator. The protection from oxidation of cysteine residues in the core region by the presence of nonspecific DNA suggests that this binding influences the core region of the protein."
https://openalex.org/W139605929,"DNA restriction fragments generally elute from RPC-5 in order of their size. However, some fragments elute later than predicted. Chromatographic studies were performed on five different restriction digests (Hae III, Hha I, Alu I, Taq I, and Hae III + HindII) of pRZ2 DNA in an effort to localize the regions which have the delayed properties. Also, the magnitude of the delay was quantitated in each case. Most of the delayed fragments were localized in one major (931 bp) and one minor (approximately 210 bp) region of the genome. The fragments exhibiting a greater extent of delay were in the major region. The results described herein and in the following paper show that, in most cases, this effect can be explained by the base composition, or sequence of the fragments, or both."

Suppression of both bacterial (trpA, his, lacZ) and bacteriophage lambda amber mutations (Aam32, Bam1) has been demonstrated after transformation of E. coli with the recombinant DNA molecules carrying the synthetic suppressor tRNA gene. The cloned synthetic gene has been reisolated from the vector chromosomes after digestion of the latter with EcoRI restriction endonuclease and characterized in regard to its size and its ability to serve as a source of suppressor activity in further transformation experiments. This synthetic gene has also been shown to suppress bacterial amber mutations after it had been incorporated into the E. coli chromosome as part of a lambda prophage. Transcription, in vitro, of the cloned synthetic suppressor gene gave a product which, on treatment with a crude E. coli extract, afforded the tyrosine suppressor tRNA precursor. The latter was characterized by two-dimensional fingerprinting after digestion with T1-RNase. Exposure of the in vitro transcript to RNase P Selectively released the 41-nucleotide-long fragment characteristic of the 5'-end of the tRNA precursor.

The nona- and decanucleotide along with the previously synthesized deoxyribo-oligonucleotide segments 25 to 27 (Ramamoorthy, B., Lees, R.G., Kleid, D., and Khorana, H.G. (1976) J. Biol. Chem. 251, 676-694) together represent the DNA duplex corresponding to the natural nucleotide sequence 121 to 142 of the region adjoining the C-C-A end of the tyrosine tRNA gene and, in addition, a run of nine nucleotides which include the EcoRI restriction enzyme sequence at the 5'-end. The syntheses used protected mono- and oligonucleotides and stepwise condensation methods. A noteworthy feature of the present syntheses was the use of reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography for the rapid and efficient separation of synthetic reaction mixtures."

The following sequence in the joining reactions was used to obtain error-free and optimal yields of the products: 1) joining of Segment P-1 to P-3 in the presence of Segment P-2; 2) joining of Segments P-4 to P-7 to form Duplex [P4-7]; 3) joining of Segments P-8 to P-10 to Duplex [P4-7] to form Duplex [P4-10]; and finally, 4) joining of P-(1 + 3) and P-2 to Duplex [P4-10] to form the total promoter Duplex [P]."
https://openalex.org/W168935006,"Enoyl-coenzyme A hydratase activity in crude extracts of Escherichia coli was stabilized by treatment with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and found to contain multiple components. After 27,000 x g centrifugation, a portion of the hydratase activity was observed to be membrane-associated and could be solubilized by Nonidet P-40. In both the absence and presence of detergent, the membrane-bound hydratase activity was optimal with substrates containing 10 or 12 carbon atoms. “Hydrophobic” chromatography on aminohexylSepharose of soluble hydratase activity yielded three fractions. Two of these were different hydratases specific for either short (C4 to C6) or longer (C8 to C16) chain length substrates, while the third contained both activities and was found to be a high molecular weight aggregate of the two. The separate activities were significantly less stable than the associated species and could not be individually purified. Additional evidence for their separate existence was obtained by in vivo studies wherein the induction rate of short (C4 to C6) chain length hydratase activity was different from that of longer (03 to C16) chain length-dependent activity. The relatively stable, larger species was found to exist as a series of higher molecular weight aggregates which contain both hydratase activities as well as /3hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase and thiolase, two of the other three /3-oxidase enzymes. The wild type activities were found associated in -20 S aggregates which were eluted from Sepharose 4B columns as two main components, having estimated molecular weights of 0.75 to 1.5 x lo6 and 2 x lo6 or greater. In contrast, comparable samples from a decanoate-selected constitutive fad mutant yielded a smaller, 8 to 10 S complex of M, approximately 500,000 to 600,000. This chroma-"
