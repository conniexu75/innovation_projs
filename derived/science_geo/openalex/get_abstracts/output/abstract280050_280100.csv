In adulthood each group was split into halves with one-half of each group receiving electroconvulsive shock treatment. Assays of sugar concentration in the blood serum 24 hours after the convulsions indicated that subjects handled at 2 to 5 days of life exhibited no effect of the treatment, whereas all other groups showed marked increases in blood sugar concentration."
https://openalex.org/W2004498779,"Transient reversed bending follows an adequate step-up in light intensity given a bending cell from any direction around its axis, yet the plane of the response is specifically that in which prior phototropic bending occurred. The cell ""remembers"" what it was doing and reverses this in the ensuing light-growth response. Antecedent asymmetric growth itself built the pattern for reversal."

https://openalex.org/W2026888506,Single-fiber activity synchronous with breathing was recorded from the dorsal roots of thoracic segments in anesthetized cats. Activity of these fibers varied in frequency and in phase relationship to the respiratory cycle. It is concluded that large numbers of proprioceptors within the thoracic wall are activated during each inspiration and each expiration.

An inadvertent 15-hour exposure on day 15 (at 42 microg/m(3)) produced foliar fluorosis symptoms only on the nitrogen-deficient plants fumigated 20 days, although higher fluoride concentrations were present in the foliage of similar plants grown in the other nutrient-deficient solutions."

https://openalex.org/W2028386347,"ABSTRACT To the Editor: â€”In Dr. Slye's recent communication (The Incidence and Inheritability of Spontaneous Cancer in Mice. Jour. Med. Research, 1915, xxxii, 159) concerning the inheritance of cancer, reference is made by way of illustration to a type-color inheritance which, since it is quite contrary to the more generally accepted principles of mendelian inheritance, requires critical comment.On page 160 she says, Let me at this point recall some of the basic facts of heredity. She then proceeds, using the customary mendelian terms dominant and recessive, to describe a cross between gray and albino mice, and indicates results which are incompatible with those of other investigators. She furthermore furnishes no data in support of this more or less revolutionary hypothesis.As Castle, Allen, Bateson, Durham, Cuenot, Plate, Davenport, and many others have carried on investigations on this particular problem in genetics and have reached results contrary to those predicted by"

Our results differ from those of Firsoff and of Brandt, partly because of the inapplicability of the barometric equation to the case of an exosphere."
