https://openalex.org/W2077499130,"Lysosomes are organelles central to degradation and recycling processes in animal cells. Whether lysosomal activity is coordinated to respond to cellular needs remains unclear. We found that most lysosomal genes exhibit coordinated transcriptional behavior and are regulated by the transcription factor EB (TFEB). Under aberrant lysosomal storage conditions, TFEB translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, resulting in the activation of its target genes. TFEB overexpression in cultured cells induced lysosomal biogenesis and increased the degradation of complex molecules, such as glycosaminoglycans and the pathogenic protein that causes Huntington’s disease. Thus, a genetic program controls lysosomal biogenesis and function, providing a potential therapeutic target to enhance cellular clearing in lysosomal storage disorders and neurodegenerative diseases."

To uncover components involved in mitochondria/endoplasmic reticulum (ER) junctions, we screened for mutants that could be complemented by a synthetic protein designed to artificially tether the two organelles. We identified the Mmm1/Mdm10/Mdm12/Mdm34 complex as a molecular tether between ER and mitochondria. The tethering complex was composed of proteins resident of both ER and mitochondria. With the use of genome-wide mapping of genetic interactions, we showed that the components of the tethering complex were functionally connected to phospholipid biosynthesis and calcium-signaling genes. In mutant cells, phospholipid biosynthesis was impaired. The tethering complex localized to discrete foci, suggesting that discrete sites of close apposition between ER and mitochondria facilitate interorganelle calcium and phospholipid exchange."

(p. 1697 ) extend this approach to enable the protection of elemental white phosphorus (P 4 ), a substance that rapidly ignites on contact with oxygen. The tetrahedral cages self-assemble in aqueous solution through coordination of six ligands to four iron ions, and efficiently capture phosphorus from a suspension. The water-soluble host-guest constructs were stable in air for at least 4 months, but released intact P 4 rapidly on displacement by added benzene."
https://openalex.org/W2027253055,"Ras, STAT3, and Transformation The STAT (signal transducer and activator of transcription) proteins are activated in response to receptor stimulation and act in the nucleus to regulate gene expression. Gough et al. (p. 1713 ) found that STAT3 functioned in transformation of cells by the oncogene Ras. However, this activity was maintained in mutants of STAT that fail to activate transcription. Instead, the active STAT3 appeared to be associated with mitochondria. Furthermore, modified STAT3 targeted to the mitochondria promoted transformation by Ras, and mitochondrial function was disrupted in Ras-transformed cells lacking STAT3. Such transformation-specific effects of STAT3 could be a useful target in developing anticancer therapies."

https://openalex.org/W2126448704,"A central problem in quantum condensed matter physics is the critical theory governing the zero-temperature quantum phase transition between strongly renormalized Fermi liquids as found in heavy fermion intermetallics and possibly in high–critical temperature superconductors. We found that the mathematics of string theory is capable of describing such fermionic quantum critical states. Using the anti–de Sitter/conformal field theory correspondence to relate fermionic quantum critical fields to a gravitational problem, we computed the spectral functions of fermions in the field theory. By increasing the fermion density away from the relativistic quantum critical point, a state emerges with all the features of the Fermi liquid."

Moustafa et al. (p. 1724 ; see the Perspective by Dagan and Martin ) have discovered that the genomes of diatoms are highly chimeric, with about 10% of their nuclear genes being of foreign algal origin. Of this set of 1272 algal genes, 253 were, as expected, from a distant red algal secondary endosymbiont, but more than 1000 of the genes were derived from green algae and predated the red algal relationship. These protist taxa are important not only for genetic and genomic investigations but also for their potential in biofuel and nanotechnology applications and in global primary productivity in relation to climate change."

Wandzioch and Zaret (p. 1707 ) investigated how three signaling pathways converge on the earliest genes specifying these organs. Within hours, multiple changes were observed in the inductive network with different signals operating in parallel. The findings may help to explain the incomplete programming seen in various stem cell differentiation protocols."
https://openalex.org/W2014207594,"Maintenance of an intact mucosal barrier is critical to preventing damage to and infection of wet-surfaced epithelia. The mechanism of defense has been the subject of much investigation, and there is evidence now implicating O-glycosylated mucins on the epithelial cell surface. Here we investigate a new role for the carbohydrate-binding protein galectin-3 in stabilizing mucosal barriers through its interaction with mucins on the apical glycocalyx. Using the surface of the eye as a model system, we found that galectin-3 colocalized with two distinct membrane-associated mucins, MUC1 and MUC16, on the apical surface of epithelial cells and that both mucins bound to galectin-3 affinity columns in a galactose-dependent manner. Abrogation of the mucin-galectin interaction in four different mucosal epithelial cell types using competitive carbohydrate inhibitors of galectin binding, β-lactose and modified citrus pectin, resulted in decreased levels of galectin-3 on the cell surface with concomitant loss of barrier function, as indicated by increased permeability to rose bengal diagnostic dye. Similarly, down-regulation of mucin O-glycosylation using a stable tetracycline-inducible RNA interfering system to knockdown c1galt1 (T-synthase), a critical galactosyltransferase required for the synthesis of core 1 O-glycans, resulted in decreased cell surface O-glycosylation, reduced cell surface galectin-3, and increased epithelial permeability. Taken together, these results suggest that galectin-3 plays a key role in maintaining mucosal barrier function through carbohydrate-dependent interactions with cell surface mucins. Maintenance of an intact mucosal barrier is critical to preventing damage to and infection of wet-surfaced epithelia.

Taken together, these results suggest that galectin-3 plays a key role in maintaining mucosal barrier function through carbohydrate-dependent interactions with cell surface mucins. Mucosal surfaces comprise more than 400 m2 of the total surface area in humans (compared with 1.8 m2 for skin) and are, thus, by far the largest area of contact with the environment (1Childers N.K. Bruce M.G. McGhee J.R. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1989; 43: 503-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Epithelial cells in mucosal surfaces are continuously faced with the critical function of forming a protective apical barrier that prevents cellular damage and infection while allowing the exchange of molecules with the extracellular milieu. Loss of barrier function is ascribed to numerous mucosal pathologies, such as dry eye (a disease affecting more than 5 million people in the United States), severe asthma, and inflammatory bowel disease (2Gipson I.K.

Integral to the apical surface of mucosal epithelia are cell surface-associated mucins, a group of high molecular weight glycoproteins defined by the presence of long amino-terminal, extracellular domains containing extensive sites for O-glycan attachment. O-Glycosylation is the most abundant post-translational modification of mucins and constitutes up to 80% of mucin's mass. It is thought that specific cell surface mucins and their O-glycans provide protection to the mucosal surface (5Hollingsworth M.A. Swanson B.J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 45-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (1400) Google Scholar). Data from knock-out mice deficient in cell surface mucin MUC1 and core 3 β-1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase, an enzyme involved in the synthesis of mucin-type O-glycans in human colon, indicate the requirement for mucins and their O-glycans in maintaining barrier integrity in the gastrointestinal tract and the eye (6Kardon R.

However, the mechanism by which cell surface-associated mucins and their O-glycans contribute to forming the mucosal barrier on the epithelial glycocalyx remains poorly characterized. Galectins are a family of animal β-galactoside-binding lectins, defined by their evolutionarily conserved carbohydrate recognition domain (10Barondes S.H. Castronovo V. Cooper D.N. Cummings R.D.

Acta. 2006; 1760: 616-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). As many as 15 galectins have been identified in mammals, and they are widely distributed among different types of cells and tissues (12Rabinovich G.A. Toscano M.A. Jackson S.S. Vasta G.R. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2007; 17: 513-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Galectins have been implicated in numerous biological processes, including tumor cell adhesion and progression, immunity, inflammation, wound healing, and development (11Dumic J. Dabelic S. Flögel M.

Galectin-3 is a 35-kDa protein originally identified as Mac-2, a cell surface antigen expressed on murine thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal macrophages (15Ho M.K. Springer T.A. J. Immunol. 1982; 128: 1221-1228PubMed Google Scholar). It is now established that galectin-3, like other galectins, can interact in a multivalent fashion and cross-link glycan ligands on cell surface receptors, such as with epidermal growth factor receptors and α5β1 integrin, to generate molecular lattices (16Lagana A.

In this study we investigate whether galectin-3 participates in mucosal barrier function through its interaction with cell surface-associated mucins. We demonstrate here that two distinct cell surface mucins, MUC1 and MUC16, interact with galectin-3 on the apical surface of epithelial cells and that carbohydrate-mediated mucin-galectin-3 interactions play an important role in maintaining mucosal barrier function.

Tumor-derived human colorectal carcinoma (Caco-2), mammary gland carcinoma (BT-20), and endometrial (ECC-1) epithelial cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC; Manassas, VA). Cells were plated at a seeding density of 5 × 104 cells/cm2 and maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2. HCLE and HCjE cell cultures were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 supplemented with 10% calf serum and 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor for 7 days to promote stratification and differentiation, as previously reported (18Gipson I.K.

Caco-2, BT-20, and ECC-1 cells were grown as recommended by ATCC (Caco-2: ATCC-formulated Eagle's minimum essential medium with 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS), BT-20, ATCC-formulated Eagle's minimum essential medium with 10% FBS, ECC-1, RPMI 1640 medium with 2 mml-glutamine, 1.5 g/liter sodium bicarbonate, 4.5 g/liter glucose, 10 mm HEPES, 1.0 mm sodium pyruvate, 5% FBS) and analyzed 7 days after reaching confluence. human corneal epithelial cells human conjunctival epithelial cells colorectal carcinoma mammary gland carcinoma endometrial epithelial cells modified citrus pectin tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate phosphate-buffered saline short hairpin RNA. Galectin-3 was immunolocalized in frozen sections (6 μm) of human corneal donor rims and conjunctival biopsies and in cell cultures fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde using standard protocols. Briefly, sections and cultures were incubated with a rat monoclonal antibody against galectin-3 (1:10 diluted hybridoma fluid; antibody M3/38; ATCC) or a rabbit polyclonal, anti-human, galectin-3 antibody (1:50; H-160, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) overnight at 4 °C (15Ho M.K. Springer T.A. J. Immunol. 1982; 128: 1221-1228PubMed Google Scholar). The corresponding fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibodies were applied (1:50) for 1 h at room temperature, and after a PBS wash specimens were cover-slipped using Vectashield mounting medium with propidium iodide (Vector Laboratories; Burlingame, CA). Incubation with primary antibodies was routinely omitted in control experiments. The sections and cultures were viewed by confocal microscopy on a TCS SP2 confocal laser scanning microscope (Leica Inc., Heidelberg, Switzerland). To determine whether galectin-3 colocalized with MUC1 and MUC16, double-labeling studies were performed. For this, a mixture of galectin-3 rabbit antibody (1:100) and OC125 mouse antibody against MUC16 (1:50; Dako Corp., Carpinteria, CA) or the 214D4 mouse antibody against MUC1 (1:100; Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY) was applied to tissue sections followed by a mixture of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG and TRITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG. The integrity of tight junctions in cell cultures was analyzed by immunostaining with the rabbit polyclonal anti-ZO-1 (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA). Assay for galectin-3 and c1galt1 in cell culture lysates was performed by Western blot analysis using a monoclonal rat antibody against galectin-3 (hybridoma M3/38) and a monoclonal mouse anti-human c1galt1 (Abnova Corp., Taipei, Taiwan), respectively. Proteins were extracted from serum-starved cell cultures with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (150 μm NaCl, 50 μm Tris, pH 8.0, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) plus Halt protease inhibitor mixture (Pierce). Protein concentration was determined using the bicinchoninic acid protein assay reagent kit (Pierce). Samples were diluted in Laemmli buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). Protein blots were then incubated with anti-galectin-3 (undiluted hybridoma supernatant) or anti-c1galt1 (1:2,000) antibodies followed by peroxidase-conjugated anti-rat or anti-mouse IgG secondary antibodies, respectively. Housekeeping proteins were detected using antibodies to cytochrome c oxidase IV (1:2,000; Abcam Inc., Cambridge, MA) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (1:2,000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Positive binding was detected using the Pierce SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce). To determine the presence of galectin-3 in cell culture media, culture supernatants were dialyzed against distilled H20 at 4 °C using 12–14-kDa dialysis tubing (Spectra/Por®2; Spectrum Laboratories, Rancho Dominguez, CA), lyophilized, and analyzed by Western blot as described above. Mucin-type O-glycans on nitrocellulose membranes were detected by lectin blot analyses. For these, membranes were incubated with 1% polyvinylpyrrolidone in 0.1% Tween Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.5, for 1 h and then with biotin-labeled peanut agglutinin (25 μg/ml; Vector Laboratories) for 90 min at room temperature on a shaker. Membranes were developed using the Vectastain ABC kit (Vector Laboratories) followed by incubation with SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescence substrate. Binding of galectin-3 to MUC1 and MUC16 was determined using a galectin-3 affinity matrix. The matrix was prepared by coupling 5 mg of recombinant human galectin-3 to cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose 4B (Sigma Aldrich) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cell culture lysates in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer were applied to a galectin-3 affinity column. The unbound components were removed by washing the column with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 (PBST), and the bound proteins were eluted using PBST containing 0.1 m β-lactose. To confirm sugar binding specificity of the galectin-3 binding proteins, the column was eluted with a non-competing disaccharide, sucrose (0.1 m), in PBST before elution with β-lactose. Fractions eluted from the column with saccharides were dialyzed against water, lyophilized, and resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis (1%, w/v). Proteins were then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes by vacuum and probed with the 214D4 antibody (1:5,000) against MUC1 and the OC125 antibody (1:2,000) against MUC16 as described (18Gipson I.K. Spurr-Michaud S.J. Argueso P. Tisdale A. Ng T.F. Russo C.L. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2003; 44: 2496-2506Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). To determine the presence of galectin-3, MUC1, MUC16, and T-antigen on the epithelial cell surface glycocalyx, cell surface proteins on apical cell membranes of corneal epithelial cultures serum-starved for 2 h before analysis were biotinylated and isolated by chromatography on a neutravidin-agarose affinity column using the PinpointTM Cell Surface Protein Isolation kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Membrane extracts of the labeled cells were analyzed for the presence of galectin-3, MUC1, MUC16, and T-antigen by Western/lectin blot analyses as described above. To determine whether biotinylation was restricted to the apical cell surface, the membrane extracts were analyzed for the presence of integrin α5 subunit (ITGA5), a glycoprotein primarily restricted to the basolateral cell membrane in corneal epithelium (19Stepp M.A. Spurr-Michaud S. Gipson I.K. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1993; 34: 1829-1844PubMed Google Scholar) using a rabbit polyclonal antibody (1:1,000) directed against the integrin α5 subunit (Chemicon, Temecula, CA). Retroviruses encoding hairpin siRNA were constructed using the pSUPER.retro.puro vector system containing a tetracycline-inducible H1 promoter (OligoEngine, Seattle, WA). Three double-stranded hairpin oligonucleotides designed to target the human c1galt1 gene (shRNA target sequences 1, (CAAACACGTCAAAGCTACT), 2 (TAAGCAAAGAAGCCTTGAA), and 3, TACAGATATCAACCTACCT) were cloned into the BglII/HindIII sites of pSUPER.retro.puro. The shRNA target sequences were found by Blast homology searching to have minimal similarity with other human genes. A scrambled sequence (GCGCGCTTTGTAGGATTCG) was used as a negative control. The viruses were transformed into chemically competent Escherichia coli (DH5α cells), and the correct orientation of the oligonucleotides was confirmed by DNA sequencing. pSUPER viruses were transfected in 293GPG packaging cells using Polyfect reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Viral supernatants were concentrated by ultracentrifugation at 50,000 × (4 °C, 90 min). Virions were resuspended in a minimal volume of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 130 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, separated into aliquots, and stored at −80 °C. Infectivity titers in NIH3T3 cells were determined 16 h after infection with serial dilutions of concentrated viral supernatants. Viral titers of at least 6 × 106 colony-forming units/ml, based on the percentage of crystal violet-positive cells in NIH3T3 cells, were used for viral infections. The pcDNA/6TR plasmid (Invitrogen) was used in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions to generate clones expressing the Tet repressor. Briefly, the linearized plasmid was transfected into HCLE cells with Polyfect (Qiagen), and cells were selected in 3 μg/ml Blasticidin (Invitrogen) for 10 days. The resulting clones were then screened for Tet repressor protein expression by Western blotting. The clone expressing the highest level of Tet repressor was chosen for subsequent viral infections with retroviruses carrying inducible-specific c1galt1 shRNA. For viral infections, Tet-inducible HCLE cells were plated at 4 × 104 cells per well in 6-well plates and incubated with 300 μl of concentrated virus-containing supernatant and 6 μg/ml Polybrene in a final volume of 1 ml for 16 h. This procedure was repeated 2 times, allowing cells to recover for 24 h between infections. Infected clones were obtained using antibiotic selection (puromycin) and further expanded to confluence to obtain stably transfected cells. For functional assays, doxycycline, a synthetic derivative of tetracycline, was administered to HCLE cells for 4 days after reaching confluency to induce shRNA expression. Expression of c1galt1 was determined by reverse transcription-PCR (forward primer, 5′-GCCAACATAAAGATGAGAACA-3′; reverse primer, 5′-TCTCCCCAGTGCTAAGTCTTC-3′) using previously published conditions (20Qin W. Zhou Q. Yang L.C. Li Z. Su B.H. Luo H. Fan J.M. J. Intern. Med. 2005; 258: 467-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Barrier function in cell cultures was assayed as previously described using differentiated epithelial cells that express robust amounts of cell surface mucins (21Argüeso P. Tisdale A. Spurr-Michaud S. Sumiyoshi M. Gipson I.K. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2006; 47: 113-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Briefly, epithelial cell cultures grown on chamber slides (Lab-Tek, Naperville, IL) were serum-starved for 2 h, rinsed with PBS, and incubated for 5 min with 0.1% rose bengal (Aldrich) in PBS, Ca+2/Mg+2-free, pH 7.4. Rose bengal was then aspirated, and the cell layer was examined to assess the extent of dye penetrance using an inverted microscope (Nikon Eclipse TS100). Pictures were taken with a SPOT Insight Fire Wire Camera (Diagnostic Instruments, Inc.; Sterling Heights, MI). Images were processed further for dye penetrance quantification using ImageJ software (NIH, Bethesda, MD). In this assay rose bengal penetrance is dependent on the character of the cell surface glycocalyx; induction and abrogation of cell surface mucin biosynthesis result in reduced and increased rose bengal penetrance, respectively (21Argüeso P. Tisdale A. Spurr-Michaud S. Sumiyoshi M. Gipson I.K. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2006; 47: 113-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 22Blalock T.D. Spurr-Michaud S.J. Tisdale A.S. Heimer S.R. Gilmore M.S. Ramesh V. Gipson I.K. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2007; 48: 4509-4518Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Therefore, protection from rose bengal penetration into epithelial cells indicated the presence of a fully functional mucosal barrier. Likewise, penetration and positive staining of the epithelia by rose bengal indicated the presence of a compromised mucosal barrier. To assess the role of galectin-3 in maintaining the integrity of the mucosal barrier, the barrier function assays were performed as described above, except that before incubation with rose bengal, the epithelial cells were preincubated with galectin inhibitors (β-lactose, modified citrus pectin (MCP)) and control saccharides (sucrose, maltose) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 at room temperature under gentle agitation for 1 h (the medium was changed every 15 min). For these experiments, five different field images were captured per well and two-to-four cultures were used per experimental condition. MCP was prepared by increasing the pH of citrus pectin (Sigma Aldrich; 0.5% in distilled H20) to pH 10.0 with 3 n NaOH for 30 min and then decreasing it to 3.0 with 3 n HCl for 10 h (23Albersheim P. Neukom H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1960; 90: 46-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The pH was then equilibrated to 6.3, and the solution was dialyzed against distilled H2O and lyophilized. The presence of galectin-3 on apical membranes of human cornea and conjunctiva as well as in cultures of corneal epithelial cells was demonstrated by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy (Figs. 1, A and B). Galectin-3 was present throughout the entire epithelia in the tissue sections, being concentrated on the apical surface. In HCLE cells galectin-3 was observed primarily on apical membranes as seen in cell culture cross-sections (Fig. 1B, inset). To further confirm the apical location of galectin-3, cell surface proteins from HCLE cells were biotinylated and isolated by affinity chromatography on a neutravidin-agarose column. In these experiments galectin-3 was detected in the bound fraction eluted from the affinity column (Fig. 1C), confirming the apical localization of galectin-3. The biotinylation experiments also revealed the presence of the high molecular weight MUC1 and MUC16 mucins on apical cell membranes (Fig. 1C). The biotinylation was restricted to the apical surface proteins, as no labeling of ITGA5, a basolateral cell membrane glycoprotein in corneal epithelial cells, was detected in the bound fraction eluted from the affinity column (Fig. 1D, lanes 2 and 3). As shown in Fig. 1E, the HCLE cells express tight junction proteins in a pattern similar to that observed in normal corneal epithelium (24Ryeom S.W. Paul D. Goodenough D.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1687-1696Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). To assess whether cell surface-associated mucins directly associate with galectin-3, cell extracts were chromatographed on a galectin-3 affinity column. In these experiments both MUC1 and MUC16 bound to galectin-3 (Fig. 2A). The interaction between the cell surface mucins and galectin-3 was galactose-dependent, as MUC1 and MUC16 eluted from the galectin-3 affinity matrix with β-lactose but not sucrose. Also, in immunolocalization experiments, galectin-3 and the cell surface mucins MUC1 and MUC16 colocalized predominantly to the apical surface of human conjunctival epithelium (Fig. 2B). Pathological alteration of the mucosal barrier in human cornea and conjunctiva, such as keratoconjunctivitis sicca, allergy, and in patients with autoimmune disorders, is clinically evaluated by determining the extent of penetrance of the fluorescein-derivative rose bengal dye into the epithelium (25Feenstra R.P. Tseng S.C. Ophthalmology. 1992; 99: 605-617Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). As described earlier, in this assay, protection from rose bengal penetration into epithelial cells is indicative of the presence of a fully functional mucosal barrier, whereas penetration and positive staining of the epithelia by rose bengal is indicative of the presence of a compromised mucosal barrier. In in vitro assays, rose bengal penetrates undifferentiated epithelial cells that do not produce fully glycosylated cell surface mucins (21Argüeso P. Tisdale A. Spurr-Michaud S. Sumiyoshi M. Gipson I.K. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2006; 47: 113-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 22Blalock T.D. Spurr-Michaud S.J. Tisdale A.S. Heimer S.R. Gilmore M.S. Ramesh V. Gipson I.K. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2007; 48: 4509-4518Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3A, induction of epithelial cell differentiation, which is known to be associated with the robust expression of cell surface mucins (21Argüeso P. Tisdale A. Spurr-Michaud S. Sumiyoshi M. Gipson I.K. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2006; 47: 113-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), resulted in the appearance of islands of cells that excluded the rose bengal dye. These islands are not observed in non-mucin-producing cells such as corneal fibroblasts and brain astrocytes (Fig. 3A), which also express tight junction-specific proteins in vitro (26Bauer H. Stelzhammer W. Fuchs R. Weiger T.M. Danninger C. Probst G. Krizbai I.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 250: 434-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). To determine whether mucin-galectin interactions modulate epithelial barrier function, we evaluated dye penetrance in HCLE cells incubated with two well known competitive inhibitors of galectin binding, β-lactose and MCP. As shown in Fig. 3B, treatment of the epithelial cells with β-lactose and MCP resulted in an increase in rose bengal staining as compared with treatment with the non-inhibitory controls sucrose and maltose. In these experiments, increased rose bengal staining was associated with a marked decrease in levels of galectin-3 on the cell surface and an increase in lectin concentration in the culture media of HCLE cells treated with β-lactose (Fig. 3C), confirming that galectin-3 was released from the cell surface glycocalyx. Saccharide inhibitors used in the current study may also release other galectins. However, galectin-3 is the most abundant galectin present in the ocular surface epithelia (∼80% of the total galectin content (27Mantelli F. Schaffer L. Dana R. Head S.R. Argüeso P. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2009; 50: 2666-2672Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar)), and therefore, it is reasonable to expect that the effect of the inhibitors observed in the current study on rose bengal penetrance is likely to be in large part because of the release of galectin-3 itself. In addition to corneal epithelial cells, we evaluated the effect of β-lactose and MCP on rose bengal penetrance in other human mucin-producing epithelial cells, both normal and neoplastic. As shown in Fig. 4, dye penetrance increased in conjunctival (HCjE), colonic (Caco-2), and endometrial (ECC-1) epithelial cells (the latter two derived from adenocarcinomas) after treatment with both competitive inhibitors β-lactose and MCP but not with the control disaccharide sucrose. In each of the three cell types, there was an increase in the number of cells into which rose bengal penetrated after β-lactose and MCP treatment, and the staining appeared cytoplasmic. It is noteworthy that rose bengal penetrance in BT-20 mammary gland carcinoma epithelial cells did not significantly increase after the addition of galectin inhibitors as compared with control disaccharide, suggesting that the role of galactose-dependent interactions on barrier function is cell type-specific. A critical step in mucin biosynthesis involves the synthesis of the core 1 disaccharide (Galβ1–3GalNAcα1-Ser/Thr), also known as the T-antigen or Thomsen-Friedenreich antigen. Core 1 is the most common core structure found on mucins, and it serves as a key precursor for all core 1 and core 2 mucin-type O-glycans (Fig. 5A). Unlike other carbohydrate structures that can be synthesized by several members of the same glycosyltransferase family, core 1 is synthesized by the action of a single glycosyltransferase, c1galt1 (also known as T-synthase or core 1 β3 galactosyltransferase), located on chromosome 7p14-p13 (28Ju T. Brewer K. D'Souza A. Cummings R.D. Canfield W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 178-186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). This makes it possible to knock down the biosynthesis of T-antigen by inhibiting the expression of a single glycosyltransferase. T-antigen itself can serve as a natural ligand for galectin-3 in epithelial cells (29Yu L.G. Andrews N. Zhao Q. McKean D. Williams J.F. C"
https://openalex.org/W2114570000,"Measurement of food intake in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster is often necessary for studies of behaviour, nutrition and drug administration. There is no reliable and agreed method for measuring food intake of flies in undisturbed, steady state, and normal culture conditions. We report such a method, based on measurement of feeding frequency by proboscis-extension, validated by short-term measurements of food dye intake. We used the method to demonstrate that (a) female flies feed more frequently than males, (b) flies feed more often when housed in larger groups and (c) fly feeding varies at different times of the day. We also show that alterations in food intake are not induced by dietary restriction or by a null mutation of the fly insulin receptor substrate chico. In contrast, mutation of takeout increases food intake by increasing feeding frequency while mutation of ovoD increases food intake by increasing the volume of food consumed per proboscis-extension. This approach provides a practical and reliable method for quantification of food intake in Drosophila under normal, undisturbed culture conditions."

Van Horn et al. (p. 1726 ) determined the structure of the 40-kilodalton functional homotrimer of E. coli DAGK by solution nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Each monomer comprises three transmembrane helices. The third transmembrane helix from each subunit is domain-swapped to pack against the first and second transmembrane helices from an adjacent subunit. These three helices frame a portico-like membrane-submerged cavity that contains residues critical for activity in close proximity to residues critical for folding. The structure provides insight into the determinants of lipid substrate specificity and phosphotransferase activity.

https://openalex.org/W2012606436,"Transcription in eukaryotic genomes depends on enzymes that regulate the degree of histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) methylation. The mixed lineage leukemia protein-1 (MLL1) is a member of the SET1 family of H3K4 methyltransferases and is frequently rearranged in acute leukemias. Despite sequence comparisons that predict that SET1 family enzymes should only monomethylate their substrates, mono-, di-, and trimethylation of H3K4 has been attributed to SET1 family complexes in vivo and in vitro. To better understand this paradox, we have biochemically reconstituted and characterized a five-component 200-kDa MLL1 core complex containing human MLL1, WDR5, RbBP5, Ash2L, and DPY-30. We demonstrate that the isolated MLL1 SET domain is a slow monomethyltransferase and that tyrosine 3942 of MLL1 prevents di- and trimethylation of H3K4. In contrast, a complex containing the MLL1 SET domain, WDR5, RbBP5, Ash2L, and DPY-30, displays a marked ∼600-fold increase in enzymatic activity but only to the dimethyl form of H3K4. Single turnover kinetic experiments reveal that the reaction leading to H3K4 dimethylation involves the transient accumulation of a monomethylated species, suggesting that the MLL1 core complex uses a non-processive mechanism to catalyze multiple lysine methylation. We have also discovered that the non-SET domain components of the MLL1 core complex possess a previously unrecognized methyltransferase activity that catalyzes H3K4 dimethylation within the MLL1 core complex. Our results suggest that the mechanism of multiple lysine methylation by the MLL1 core complex involves the sequential addition of two methyl groups at two distinct active sites within the complex.

An understanding of this paradox has been limited by the absence of a well defined system to examine the product specificity of SET1 family enzymes in the presence and absence of interacting proteins. To better understand how product specificity is regulated in SET1 family enzymes, we have developed an in vitro system to identify the molecular mechanisms of H3K4 methylation by the human MLL1 core complex. We previously reported the identification of a minimal MLL1 SET domain fragment that is required for the interaction between the MLL1 and WDR5 components of the MLL1 core complex (44.Patel A. Dharmarajan V. Cosgrove M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 32158-32161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 45.Patel A. Vought V.E. Dharmarajan V. Cosgrove M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 32162-32175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In this investigation, we used this MLL1 SET domain fragment to reconstitute and characterize the hydrodynamic and kinetic properties of a five-component 200-kDa MLL1 core complex including MLL1, WDR5, RbBP5, Ash2L, and DPY-30. Our results confirm that the isolated MLL1 SET domain is an H3K4 monomethyltransferase, consistent with the predictions of the Phe/Tyr switch hypothesis. In contrast, when the MLL1 SET domain fragment is assembled with a complex containing WDR5, RbBP5, Ash2L, and DPY-30, the rate of lysine methylation is dramatically increased but only to the dimethyl form of H3K4, suggesting that the MLL1 core complex is predominantly a dimethyltransferase. Unexpectedly, we demonstrate that the H3K4 dimethylation activity of the MLL1 core complex is catalyzed by a previously unrecognized methyltransferase activity conferred by the non-SET domain components of the MLL1 core complex. These results suggest that SET1 family complexes have evolved a novel mechanism to precisely regulate the degree of H3K4 methylation in eukaryotes. A human MLL1 construct consisting of residues 3745–3969 (MLL3745) as well as full-length human WDR5, RbBP5, and ASH2L proteins were individually expressed in Escherichia coli (Rosetta II, Novagen) and purified as described previously (45.Patel A. Vought V.E. Dharmarajan V. Cosgrove M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 32162-32175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). A cDNA clone of the human dpy-30 gene was obtained from Open Biosystems (clone ID LIFESEQ1240436), PCR-subcloned into the pHis parallel vector (46.Sheffield P. Garrard S. Derewenda Z. Protein Expr. Purif. 1999; 15: 34-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar), and purified by nickel affinity and gel filtration chromatography as described previously (45.Patel A. Vought V.E. Dharmarajan V. Cosgrove M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 32162-32175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). As a final step of purification and for buffer exchange, all proteins were passed through a gel filtration column (Superdex 200, GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine, and 1 μm ZnCl2. Analytical ultracentrifugation experiments were carried out using a Beckman Coulter ProteomeLabTM XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge equipped with absorbance optics and an eight-hole An-50 Ti analytical rotor. Sedimentation velocity experiments were carried out at 10 °C and 50,000 rpm (200,000 × g) using 3-mm two-sector charcoal-filled Epon centerpieces with quartz windows. Each sample was scanned at 0-min time intervals for 300 scans. Protein samples were run at various concentrations and combinations as described under “Results.” Sedimentation boundaries were analyzed by the continuous sedimentation coefficient distribution (c(s)) method using the program SEDFIT (47.Schuck P. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1606-1619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3089) Google Scholar). Equilibrium dissociation constants for all binary complexes were obtained by globally fitting sedimentation velocity data using the single-site hetero-association model (A + B ↔ AB) of SEDPHAT (48.Schuck P.

Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, UK1992: 19-125Google Scholar) was used to correct the experimental s value to standard conditions at 20 °C in water (s20,w) and to calculate the partial specific volume of each protein. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry assays were carried out as described previously (45.Patel A. Vought V.E. Dharmarajan V. Cosgrove M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 32162-32175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Briefly, 6 or 30 μg of MLL3745 were mixed with 250 μm S-adenosyl methionine (AdoMet) and 10 μm histone H3 peptide consisting of residues 1–20 in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 9.0, 200 mm NaCl, 3 mm dithiothreitol, and 5% glycerol. The total reaction volume was 20 μl. To prevent enzyme inactivation over the duration of the experiment, the reactions were incubated at 15 °C for 24 h, and at various time points, aliquots were removed and quenched by the addition of trifluoroacetic acid to 0.5%. The quenched samples were diluted 1:5 with α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry was performed on a Bruker AutoFlex mass spectrometer (State University of New York, Oswego, NY) operated in reflectron mode. Final spectra were the average of 100 shots/position at 10 different positions chosen at random on each spot. Duplicate or triplicate measurements were taken at each time point. Unmodified histone H3 peptide (residues 1–20), or mono-, di-, and trimethylated H3K4 peptides (residues 1–21) were purchased from Global Peptide and Millipore, respectively. All peptides contained a Gly-Gly linker on the C terminus followed by lysine with biotin on the ϵ-amino group. H3K4 methyltransferase assays were conducted by combining 2 μg of MLL3745-WDR5-RbBP5-Ash2L complex with 250 μm histone H3 peptide and 1 μCi of [3H]methyl-S-adenosyl-methionine ([3H]AdoMet, GE Healthcare) in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.5, 200 mm NaCl, 3 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, and 5% glycerol. The reactions were incubated at 15 °C for 8 h, stopped by the addition of 1× SDS loading buffer, and separated by SDS-PAGE on a 4–12% gradient gel (Invitrogen). The gel then was soaked in an autoradiography enhancer solution (ENLIGHTNING, PerkinElmer Life Sciences), dried, and exposed to film at −80 °C for 24 or 48 h. Enzymatic reactions were initiated with substrate quantities of enzyme (12 or 60 μm) and were quenched manually at various time points by the addition of 0.5% trifluoroacetic acid. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry was used to determine the relative distribution of unmodified, mono-, di-, and trimethylated species in each reaction using a procedure similar to that described by Frey and colleagues (51.Gross J.W. Hegeman A.D. Vestling M.M. Frey P.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13633-13640Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). We note that although MALDI-TOF is generally believed to be a qualitative technique, it has been successfully used in several systems to quantitate reaction intermediates in rapid reaction kinetic experiments with results comparable with other rapid reaction techniques (51.Gross J.W. Hegeman A.D. Vestling M.M. Frey P.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13633-13640Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 52.Houston C.T. Taylor W.P. Widlanski T.S. Reilly J.P. Anal Chem. 2000; 72: 3311-3319Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In the present investigation, data were quantitated by determining the percentage of total integrated area for each species and using standard curves to estimate the concentration of each modified form at each time point. Standard curves were constructed by collecting MALDI-TOF spectra on peptide mixtures containing various ratios of synthetic histone H3 peptides that were either unmodified or previously mono- or dimethylated at H3K4. Amino acid analysis was used to determine peptide stock concentrations (Purdue Proteomics Facility). Relative intensity plots of each species in the presence of varying ratios of the other species are linear (supplemental Fig. 1), indicating that ionization and detection of each species is independent of the concentration of the other species. Control experiments indicated that the presence of enzyme did not significantly affect the ionization behavior of the peptides. Single turnover progress curves for the enzyme-catalyzed reactions were fitted to a kinetic model with one or two irreversible consecutive reactions (A→B→C) using (Eq. 1), (Eq. 2), (Eq. 3) as described by Fersht (53.Fersht A. Sturcture and Mechanism in Protein Science. W.H. Freeman and Company, New York1999: 143-146Google Scholar). A=A0exp−k1t(Eq. 1) B=A0k1k2−k1exp−k1t−exp−k2t(Eq. 2) C=A01+1k1−k2k2exp−k1t−k1exp−k2t(Eq. 3) where [A]0 is the concentration of the unmodified peptide at time (t) zero. [B] and [C] represent the concentrations of the monomethylated and dimethylated species in single turnover progress curves, respectively. k1 and k2 represent the pseudo-first-order rate constants for the conversion of A→B and B→C, respectively. For reactions with two irreversible consecutive steps, the program DynaFit (BioKin, Ltd.) (54.Kuzmic P. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 237: 260-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar) was used to globally fit (Eq. 1), (Eq. 2), (Eq. 3) to the data. Previous co-immunoprecipitation studies suggest that the minimal complex required for di- and trimethylation of H3K4 includes MLL1, WDR5, RbBP5, and Ash2L (28.Dou Y. Milne T.A. Ruthenburg A.J. Lee S. Lee J.W. Verdine G.L. Allis C.D. Roeder R.G. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 713-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). To begin to test this hypothesis, we individually overexpressed each component in E. coli and purified them to homogeneity (Fig. 1a). We also similarly purified the human DPY-30 protein, which was recently shown to interact with the Ash2L component of the MLL3 core complex and is conserved in SET1 family complexes ranging from yeast to humans (30.Cho Y.W. Hong T. Hong S. Guo H. Yu H. Kim D. Guszczynski T. Dressler G.R. Copeland T.D. Kalkum M. Ge K. J. Biol.

All proteins were full-length human proteins with the exception of human MLL1, for which we used a recombinant fragment containing residues 3745–3969 (MLL3745). This fragment from the extreme C terminus of MLL1 contains the conserved SET and post-SET domains as well as the conserved Win or WDR5 interaction motif in the N-SET region of MLL1 (Fig. 1b). The MLL1 Win motif was previously demonstrated to be required for the interaction between MLL1 and WDR5 (44.Patel A. Dharmarajan V. Cosgrove M.S. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2003355605,"Synthetic Centromere Every eukaryotic chromosome must have a centromere where the cell division machinery latches onto each chromosome pair to ensure an even apportioning of the genetic material between daughter cells. The characteristic (but not conserved) repeat sequences associated with most centromeres are thought to be required to induce an RNA interference (RNAi) response and thereby promote the formation of heterochromatin, needed for centromere function. Kagansky et al. (p. 1716 ) now show in fission yeast that these outer repeat sequences can be replaced in their entirety by very short sequences that recruit an enzyme, Clr4, which promotes the formation of heterochromatin in the absence of RNAi. Thus, flanking heterochromatin, regardless of its derivation, is all that is required for the formation of a functional centromere."

The extent to which Oseltamivir treatment may protect against a fatal outcome in severe influenza infections is not known. Thailand's National Avian Influenza Surveillance (NAIS) system affords a unique opportunity to describe the epidemiology of laboratory-confirmed severe and fatal human influenza infections.During January 2004 through December 2006, 11,641 notifications to the NAIS were investigated in 73 of 76 Thai provinces. Clinical and demographic data and respiratory swab specimens were collected and tested by PCR for influenza. Using the NAIS database, we identified all patients with laboratory confirmed human influenza (A/H3N2, A/H1N1 and Type B) infection. A retrospective medical record review was conducted on all fatal cases with laboratory confirmed influenza and from a sample of hospitalized cases in 28 provinces. The association of underlying risk factors, Oseltamivir treatment and risk of a fatal outcome were examined. Human influenza infections were identified in 2,075 (18%) cases. Twenty-two (1%) deaths occurred including seven deaths in children less than ten years of age. Thirty-five percent of hospitalized human influenza infections had chest X-ray confirmed pneumonia. Current or former smoking; advanced age, hypertension and underlying cardiovascular, pulmonary or endocrine disease were associated with a fatal outcome from human influenza infection. Treatment with Oseltamivir was statistically associated with survival with a crude OR of .11 (95% CI: 0.04-0.30) and .13 (95% CI: 0.04-0.40) after controlling for age.Severe and fatal human influenza infections were commonly identified in the NAIS designed to identify avian A/H5N1 cases. Treatment with Oseltamivir is associated with survival in hospitalized human influenza pneumonia patients."
https://openalex.org/W2140976344,"Background High-fat diets promote hepatic lipid accumulation. Paradoxically, these diets also induce lipogenic gene expression in rodent liver. Whether high expression of these genes actually results in an increased flux through the de novo lipogenic pathway in vivo has not been demonstrated. Methodology/Principal Findings To interrogate this apparent paradox, we have quantified de novo lipogenesis in C57Bl/6J mice fed either chow, a high-fat or a n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA)-enriched high-fat diet. A novel approach based on mass isotopomer distribution analysis (MIDA) following 1-13C acetate infusion was applied to simultaneously determine de novo lipogenesis, fatty acid elongation as well as cholesterol synthesis. Furthermore, we measured very low density lipoprotein-triglyceride (VLDL-TG) production rates. High-fat feeding promoted hepatic lipid accumulation and induced the expression of lipogenic and cholesterogenic genes compared to chow-fed mice: induction of gene expression was found to translate into increased oleate synthesis. Interestingly, this higher lipogenic flux (+74 µg/g/h for oleic acid) in mice fed the high-fat diet was mainly due to an increased hepatic elongation of unlabeled palmitate (+66 µg/g/h) rather than to elongation of de novo synthesized palmitate. In addition, fractional cholesterol synthesis was increased, i.e. 5.8±0.4% vs. 8.1±0.6% for control and high fat-fed animals, respectively. Hepatic VLDL-TG production was not affected by high-fat feeding. Partial replacement of saturated fat by fish oil completely reversed the lipogenic effects of high-fat feeding: hepatic lipogenic and cholesterogenic gene expression levels as well as fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis rates were normalized. Conclusions/Significance High-fat feeding induces hepatic fatty acid synthesis in mice, by chain elongation and subsequent desaturation rather than de novo synthesis, while VLDL-TG output remains unaffected. Suppression of lipogenic fluxes by fish oil prevents from high fat diet-induced hepatic steatosis in mice."

Here, we demonstrate that Arabidopsis cold shock domain protein 3 (AtCSP3), which shares a cold shock domain with bacterial CSPs, is involved in the acquisition of freezing tolerance in plants. AtCSP3 complemented a cold-sensitive phenotype of the E. coli CSP quadruple mutant and displayed nucleic acid duplex melting activity, suggesting that AtCSP3 also functions as an RNA chaperone. Promoter-GUS transgenic plants revealed tissue-specific expression of AtCSP3 in shoot and root apical regions. When exposed to low temperature, GUS activity was extensively induced in a broader region of the roots. In transgenic plants expressing an AtCSP3-GFP fusion, GFP signals were detected in both the nucleus and cytoplasm. An AtCSP3 knock-out mutant (atcsp3-2) was sensitive to freezing compared with wild-type plants under non-acclimated and cold-acclimated conditions, whereas expression of C-repeat-binding factors and their downstream genes during cold acclimation was not altered in the atcsp3-2 mutant.

Cold-regulated (COR) genes are highly expressed during cold acclimation and contribute substantially to acquiring freezing tolerance. The C-repeat-binding factors (CBF) or dehydration responsive element-binding protein 1 (DREB1) have been identified as transcription activators for COR gene expression (3.Liu Q. Kasuga M. Sakuma Y.

They play a key role in the signal transduction pathway for cold acclimation and ectopic expression of CBF genes in plants confers tolerance against freezing and other related stresses (3.Liu Q.

In addition to the major CBF-dependent pathway, CBF-independent pathways are also thought to be necessary for cold acclimation (5.Xin Z. Browse J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Elucidating the role of these non-CBF pathways is thus required to fully understand cold acclimation mechanisms in plants.Cold acclimation is also observed in diverse organisms including bacteria, where it is known as the cold shock response. The major cold shock protein (CSP) in Escherichia coli, CspA, is dramatically induced immediately following a temperature downshift and accumulates to represent up to 10% of total soluble protein (8.Phadtare S.

Nine members of the CSP gene family (cspA to cspI) have been identified in E. coli, and four of these have been shown to be induced by cold shock (10.Yamanaka K. Fang L. Inouye M. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 247-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of CSP proteins consists of a closed five-stranded anti-parallel β-barrel capped by a long flexible loop and contains two consensus RNA-binding motifs (RNP1 and RNP2) that contribute to bind nucleic acids (8.Phadtare S.

CSPs can destabilize the secondary structures in RNA and thus function as RNA chaperones to regulate transcription and translation in bacteria (11.Weber M.H. Fricke I. Doll N.

Bacterial CSPs are considered to be the most ancient form of the RNA binding protein, which is also found in eukaryote proteins as a RNA-binding domain called the cold shock domain (CSD) (13.Graumann P.L. Marahiel M.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 286-290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar).Among the most widely studied eukaryotic CSD proteins is the Y-Box protein family. All vertebrate Y-box proteins contain a variable N-terminal domain, cold shock domain, and a C-terminal auxiliary domain. Y-box protein was originally identified as a protein binding to the Y-box sequence (CTGATTGG) of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II gene promoter (14.Didier D.K. Schiffenbauer J.

Subsequent studies have shown that Y-box proteins are transcription factors that can negatively or positively regulate gene expression in several genes (15.Higashi K. Inagaki Y. Suzuki N. Mitsui S.

Plant Physiol. 2003; 131: 12-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In wheat, the wheat cold shock protein 1 (WCSP1) accumulates in crown tissue during cold acclimation (24.Karlson D.

WCSP1 displays activity to bind ssDNA, dsDNA, and RNA, and unwinds nucleic acid duplexes (24.Karlson D. Nakaminami K. Toyomasu T. Imai R. J. Biol.

Heterologous expression of WCSP1 in an E. coli cspA, cspB, cspE, cspG quadruple deletion mutant complemented its cold sensitive phenotype. WCSP1 was also demonstrated to have transcriptional anti-termination activity in E. coli (26.Nakaminami K. Karlson D.T. Imai R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 10122-10127Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). These studies indicated that WCSP1 functions as a RNA chaperone to destabilize RNA secondary structures. However, the detailed functions of WCSP1 in planta remain to be elucidated.Arabidopsis thaliana has four CSD proteins that displayed differential regulation in response to low temperature (23.Karlson D. Imai R. Plant Physiol. 2003; 131: 12-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Two of these proteins (AtGRP2/AtCSP2/At4g38680 and AtGRP2b/AtCSP4/At2g21060) contain two CCHC zinc fingers and the other two (AtCSP1/At4g36020 and AtCSP3/At2g17870) contain seven CCHC zinc fingers within the glycine-rich region (23.Karlson D. Imai R. Plant Physiol. 2003; 131: 12-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). AtCSP2 has been subject to further characterization (27.Sasaki K. Kim M.H. Imai R. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Commun. 2007; 364: 633-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) increased during cold acclimation, and localization of AtCSP2::GFP was shown to be in the nucleolus and cytoplasm (27.Sasaki K. Kim M.H. Imai R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 364: 633-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar).To elucidate the regulatory mechanism of Arabidopsis CSD proteins during cold acclimation, we have chosen the Arabidopsis AtCSP3 (At2g17870) protein for further characterization. AtCSP3 was shown to function as an RNA chaperone, sharing this biochemical function with bacterial CSPs and wheat WCSP1. In vivo functional analyses with overexpressors and a knock-out mutant as well as expression analyses indicate that AtCSP3 regulates freezing tolerance in Arabidopsis during cold acclimation independent of the CBF/DREB1 pathway.DiscussionCold shock domain proteins have been identified in a variety of organisms ranging from bacteria to mammals. In higher plants, cold shock domain proteins are involved in the cold response and share conserved functions with bacterial CSPs (26.Nakaminami K. Karlson D.T. Imai R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 10122-10127Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 27.Sasaki K. Kim M.H. Imai R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 364: 633-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In the current study, we have shown that the Arabidopsis AtCSP3 functions as a RNA chaperone and is involved in the acquisition of freezing tolerance.Expression analysis indicated that the level of AtCSP3 transcripts increased in response to cold in both shoots and roots (Fig. 2, A and B), with a maximum level of expression at around 12 h of cold treatment. The fact that AtCSP3 expression was not modulated by drought, NaCl, or ABA (data not shown), suggested that AtCSP3 function is mainly associated with cold stress. The spatial expression pattern of AtCSP3 was characterized using a reporter gene fusion construct (Fig. 2B and supplemental Fig. S2). AtCSP3 promoter-GUS expression was limited to shoot and root apical regions of vegetative plants, which are considered to be tissues that primarily sense environmental cues. The shoot apical meristem was reported to sense low temperature signals during vernalization (36.Schwabe W.W. J. Exp. Bot. 1954; 5: 389-400Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 37.Curtis O.F. Chang H.T. Amer. J. Bot. 1930; 17: 1047-1048Google Scholar), whereas root tips are also known to sense environmental signals such as gravity and water availability (38.Takahashi H. J. Plant Res. 1997; 110: 163-169Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In response to cold, GUS and GFP expression was extended to a broader region of root (Fig. 2B, and supplemental Fig. S2K). Because root growth was inhibited during cold treatment, this extension was not due to cell division of GUS-expressing cells. It is thus plausible that a signal from root tip is transduced toward the basal part of root to induce expression of AtCSP3.Transgenic expression of AtCSP3-GFP driven by the native AtCSP3 promoter revealed that AtCSP3 was localized to both the nucleus and cytoplasm (Fig. 2C and supplemental Fig. S2K). The nuclear and cytoplasmic localization is consistent with a role for AtCSP3 involving interaction with mRNA. Arabidopsis LOS4 encodes a DEAD-box RNA helicase and is required for efficient export of RNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (39.Gong Z. Lee H. Xiong L. Jagendorf A. Stevenson B. Zhu J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 11507-11512Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). LOS4 also localizes to the nucleus and cytoplasm, and might be important for nuclear pore remodeling under cold temperatures (39.Gong Z. Lee H. Xiong L. Jagendorf A. Stevenson B. Zhu J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 11507-11512Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 40.Gong Z. Dong C.H. Lee H. Zhu J. Xiong L. Gong D. Stevenson B. Zhu J.K. Plant Cell. 2005; 17: 256-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). RNA helicases and RNA chaperones are involved in various steps of RNA metabolism (41.Sommerville J. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 319-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In Bacillus subtilis, CspB physically interacts with cold-induced DEAD-box RNA helicases, CshA and CshB (42.Hunger K. Beckering C.L. Wiegeshoff F. Graumann P.L. Marahiel M.A. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 240-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). It will be interesting to determine if plant CSD proteins interact with RNA helicases.The atcsp3-2 mutant plant was more sensitive to freezing than wild type under both NA and CA conditions (Fig. 3, D–F). A change in freezing tolerance may reflect altered expression of cold-regulated genes, however, expression analysis of CBFs and CBF regulon genes indicated that the CBF pathway is functioning normally in atcsp3-2 (Fig. 4). On the other hand, several genes were identified that were down-regulated in atcsp3-2. Most of these down-regulated genes in atcsp3-2 have been linked to stress responses (supplemental Table S1 and Fig. 5); however, it is not yet clear how they are related or their potential mechanistic role in freezing tolerance. It is interesting to note that six of the down-regulated genes in atcsp3-2 are known to be up-regulated in the ada2b-1 mutant (43.Vlachonasios K.E. Thomashow M.F. Triezenberg S.J. Plant Cell. 2003; 15: 626-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). ADA2 is a histone acetyltransferase with a putative transcriptional adaptor function (43.Vlachonasios K.E. Thomashow M.F. Triezenberg S.J. Plant Cell. 2003; 15: 626-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 44.Stockinger E.J. Mao Y. Regier M.K. Triezenberg S.J. Thomashow M.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1524-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The ada2b-1 mutant is constitutively more freezing tolerant than wild-type plants without overexpressing COR genes (43.Vlachonasios K.E. Thomashow M.F. Triezenberg S.J. Plant Cell. 2003; 15: 626-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), suggesting there may be a cross-talk between the AtCSP3 and ADA2. Current information suggests that AtCSP3 controls the expression of genes that are necessary for freezing tolerance but are not CBF-regulated genes. Molecular genetic analyses of several mutants such as esk1 and hos9 have indicated a significant role for such CBF-independent pathways in freezing tolerance in Arabidopsis (5.Xin Z. Browse J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 7799-7804Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 6.Zhu J. Shi H. Lee B.H. Damsz B. Cheng S. Stirm V. Zhu J.K. Hasegawa P.M. Bressan R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 9873-9878Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 45.Xin Z. Mandaokar A. Chen J. Last R.L. Browse J. Plant J. 2007; 49: 786-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar).The biochemical activity of AtCSP3 is very similar to that of WCSP1, unwinding dsDNA, and binding RNA and DNA (supplemental Fig. S1). In addition, AtCSP3 complemented the E. coli csp mutant (Fig. 1B). These data suggested that AtCSP3 functions as RNA chaperone in vivo. AtCSP3 may thus act to enhance translation of bulk or specific mRNA important for freezing tolerance by destabilizing RNA duplex produced under low temperature conditions. Another possibility is that AtCSP3 regulates mRNA stability by mediating RNA duplex formation, which can stabilize mRNA from exonucleolytic degradation. In bacterial systems, RNA chaperones regulate gene expression at both the transcription and post-transcription levels. Our data, together with the recent finding that bacterial CSPs can confer stress tolerance in plants (46.Castiglioni P. Warner D. Bensen R.J. Anstrom D.C. Harrison J. Stoecker M. Abad M. Kumar G. Salvador S. D'Ordine R. Navarro S. Back S. Fernandes M. Targolli J. Dasgupta S. Bonin C. Luethy M.H. Heard J.E. Plant Physiol. 2008; 147: 446-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar), support a functional conservation of plant and bacterial CSD proteins in acquiring stress tolerance. Many plant species acquire substantial freezing tolerance after exposure to low but non-freezing temperatures, a process known as cold acclimation (1.Sakai A. Larcher W. Frost Survival of Plants: Responses and Adaptations to Freezing Stress. Springer-Verlag, New York1987Crossref Google Scholar).

Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1990; 41: 187-223Crossref Scopus (1139) Google Scholar). Cold-regulated (COR) genes are highly expressed during cold acclimation and contribute substantially to acquiring freezing tolerance. The C-repeat-binding factors (CBF) or dehydration responsive element-binding protein 1 (DREB1) have been identified as transcription activators for COR gene expression (3.Liu Q. Kasuga M. Sakuma Y. Abe H. Miura S. Yamaguchi-Shinozaki K. Shinozaki K. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 1391-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (2342) Google Scholar, 4.Jaglo-Ottosen K.R. Gilmour S.J. Zarka D.G. Schabenberger O. Thomashow M.F. Science. 1998; 280: 104-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (1355) Google Scholar). They play a key role in the signal transduction pathway for cold acclimation and ectopic expression of CBF genes in plants confers tolerance against freezing and other related stresses (3.Liu Q. Kasuga M. Sakuma Y. Abe H. Miura S. Yamaguchi-Shinozaki K. Shinozaki K. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 1391-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (2342) Google Scholar, 4.Jaglo-Ottosen K.R. Gilmour S.J. Zarka D.G. Schabenberger O. Thomashow M.F. Science. 1998; 280: 104-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (1355) Google Scholar). In addition to the major CBF-dependent pathway, CBF-independent pathways are also thought to be necessary for cold acclimation (5.Xin Z. Browse J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 7799-7804Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 6.Zhu J. Shi H. Lee B.H. Damsz B. Cheng S. Stirm V. Zhu J.K. Hasegawa P.M. Bressan R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 9966-9971Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Elucidating the role of these non-CBF pathways is thus required to fully understand cold acclimation mechanisms in plants. cold acclimation cold-regulated cold acclimation cold shock protein cold shock domain β-glucuronidase major histocompatibility complex messenger ribonucleoprotein complex non-acclimation wild type 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-glucuronide glutathione S-transferase green fluorescent protein. cold acclimation cold-regulated cold acclimation cold shock protein cold shock domain β-glucuronidase major histocompatibility complex messenger ribonucleoprotein complex non-acclimation wild type 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-glucuronide glutathione S-transferase green fluorescent protein. Cold acclimation is also observed in diverse organisms including bacteria, where it is known as the cold shock response. The major cold shock protein (CSP) in Escherichia coli, CspA, is dramatically induced immediately following a temperature downshift and accumulates to represent up to 10% of total soluble protein (8.Phadtare S. Tyagi S. Inouye M. Severinov K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46706-46711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 9.Phadtare S. Alsina J. Inouye M. Curr. Opin Microbiol. 1999; 2: 199-215Crossref Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Nine members of the CSP gene family (cspA to cspI) have been identified in E. coli, and four of these have been shown to be induced by cold shock (10.Yamanaka K. Fang L. Inouye M. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 247-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of CSP proteins consists of a closed five-stranded anti-parallel β-barrel capped by a long flexible loop and contains two consensus RNA-binding motifs (RNP1 and RNP2) that contribute to bind nucleic acids (8.Phadtare S.

Biol. 2002; 316: 317-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). CSPs can destabilize the secondary structures in RNA and thus function as RNA chaperones to regulate transcription and translation in bacteria (11.Weber M.H. Fricke I. Doll N. Marahiel M.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 375-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 13.Graumann P.L. Marahiel M.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 286-290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Bacterial CSPs are considered to be the most ancient form of the RNA binding protein, which is also found in eukaryote proteins as a RNA-binding domain called the cold shock domain (CSD) (13.Graumann P.L. Marahiel M.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 286-290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Among the most widely studied eukaryotic CSD proteins is the Y-Box protein family. All vertebrate Y-box proteins contain a variable N-terminal domain, cold shock domain, and a C-terminal auxiliary domain. Y-box protein was originally identified as a protein binding to the Y-box sequence (CTGATTGG) of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II gene promoter (14.Didier D.K. Schiffenbauer J. Woulfe S.L. Zacheis M. Schwartz B.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1988; 85: 7322-7326Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies have shown that Y-box proteins are transcription factors that can negatively or positively regulate gene expression in several genes (15.Higashi K. Inagaki Y. Suzuki N. Mitsui S.

Despite the function as a transcription factor, the majority of the human Y-box protein YB-1 is found in the cytosol as part of the messenger ribonucleoprotein complex (mRNP). YB-1 stimulates or inhibits translation depending on the YB-1/mRNA ratio (17.Nekrasov M.P. Ivshina M.P. Chernov K.G. Kovrigina E.A. Evdokimova V.M. Thomas A.A. Hershey J.W. Ovchinnikov L.P. J. Biol.

Initially identified as a heterochronic gene in Caenorhabditis elegans (19.Moss E.G. Lee R.C. Ambros V. Cell. 1997; 88: 637-646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar), LIN28 is now known to function in the enhancement of translation (20.Polesskaya A. Cuvellier S.

Highly conserved CSD is also found in a diverse genera of lower and higher plants (23.Karlson D. Imai R. Plant Physiol. 2003; 131: 12-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In wheat, the wheat cold shock protein 1 (WCSP1) accumulates in crown tissue during cold acclimation (24.Karlson D. Nakaminami K. Toyomasu T. Imai R. J. Biol.

WCSP1 displays activity to bind ssDNA, dsDNA, and RNA, and unwinds nucleic acid duplexes (24.Karlson D. Nakaminami K. Toyomasu T. Imai R. J. Biol.

Heterologous expression of WCSP1 in an E. coli cspA, cspB, cspE, cspG quadruple deletion mutant complemented its cold sensitive phenotype. WCSP1 was also demonstrated to have transcriptional anti-termination activity in E. coli (26.Nakaminami K. Karlson D.T. Imai R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 10122-10127Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). These studies indicated that WCSP1 functions as a RNA chaperone to destabilize RNA secondary structures. However, the detailed functions of WCSP1 in planta remain to be elucidated. Arabidopsis thaliana has four CSD proteins that displayed differential regulation in response to low temperature (23.Karlson D. Imai R.

Two of these proteins (AtGRP2/AtCSP2/At4g38680 and AtGRP2b/AtCSP4/At2g21060) contain two CCHC zinc fingers and the other two (AtCSP1/At4g36020 and AtCSP3/At2g17870) contain seven CCHC zinc fingers within the glycine-rich region (23.Karlson D.

Commun. 2007; 364: 633-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) increased during cold acclimation, and localization of AtCSP2::GFP was shown to be in the nucleolus and cytoplasm (27.Sasaki K. Kim M.H. Imai R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 364: 633-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). To elucidate the regulatory mechanism of Arabidopsis CSD proteins during cold acclimation, we have chosen the Arabidopsis AtCSP3 (At2g17870) protein for further characterization. AtCSP3 was shown to function as an RNA chaperone, sharing this biochemical function with bacterial CSPs and wheat WCSP1. In vivo functional analyses with overexpressors and a knock-out mutant as well as expression analyses indicate that AtCSP3 regulates freezing tolerance in Arabidopsis during cold acclimation independent of the CBF/DREB1 pathway. DiscussionCold shock domain proteins have been identified in a variety of organisms ranging from bacteria to mammals. In higher plants, cold shock domain proteins are involved in the cold response and share conserved functions with bacterial CSPs (26.Nakaminami K. Karlson D.T. Imai R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 10122-10127Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 27.Sasaki K. Kim M.H. Imai R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 364: 633-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In the current study, we have shown that the Arabidopsis AtCSP3 functions as a RNA chaperone and is involved in the acquisition of freezing tolerance.Expression analysis indicated that the level of AtCSP3 transcripts increased in response to cold in both shoots and roots (Fig. 2, A and B), with a maximum level of expression at around 12 h of cold treatment. The fact that AtCSP3 expression was not modulated by drought, NaCl, or ABA (data not shown), suggested that AtCSP3 function is mainly associated with cold stress. The spatial expression pattern of AtCSP3 was characterized using a reporter gene fusion construct (Fig. 2B and supplemental Fig. S2). AtCSP3 promoter-GUS expression was limited to shoot and root apical regions of vegetative plants, which are considered to be tissues that primarily sense environmental cues. The shoot apical meristem was reported to sense low temperature signals during vernalization (36.Schwabe W.W. J. Exp. Bot. 1954; 5: 389-400Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 37.Curtis O.F. Chang H.T. Amer. J. Bot. 1930; 17: 1047-1048Google Scholar), whereas root tips are also known to sense environmental signals such as gravity and water availability (38.Takahashi H. J. Plant Res. 1997; 110: 163-169Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In response to cold, GUS and GFP expression was extended to a broader region of root (Fig. 2B, and supplemental Fig. S2K). Because root growth was inhibited during cold treatment, this extension was not due to cell division of GUS-expressing cells. It is thus plausible that a signal from root tip is transduced toward the basal part of root to induce expression of AtCSP3.Transgenic expression of AtCSP3-GFP driven by the native AtCSP3 promoter revealed that AtCSP3 was localized to both the nucleus and cytoplasm (Fig. 2C and supplemental Fig. S2K). The nuclear and cytoplasmic localization is consistent with a role for AtCSP3 involving interaction with mRNA. Arabidopsis LOS4 encodes a DEAD-box RNA helicase and is required for efficient export of RNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (39.Gong Z. Lee H. Xiong L. Jagendorf A. Stevenson B. Zhu J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 11507-11512Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). LOS4 also localizes to the nucleus and cytoplasm, and might be important for nuclear pore remodeling under cold temperatures (39.Gong Z. Lee H. Xiong L. Jagendorf A. Stevenson B. Zhu J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 11507-11512Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 40.Gong Z. Dong C.H. Lee H. Zhu J. Xiong L. Gong D. Stevenson B. Zhu J.K. Plant Cell. 2005; 17: 256-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). RNA helicases and RNA chaperones are involved in various steps of RNA metabolism (41.Sommerville J. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 319-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In Bacillus subtilis, CspB physically interacts with cold-induced DEAD-box RNA helicases, CshA and CshB (42.Hunger K. Beckering C.L. Wiegeshoff F. Graumann P.L. Marahiel M.A. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 240-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). It will be interesting to determine if plant CSD proteins interact with RNA helicases.The atcsp3-2 mutant plant was more sensitive to freezing than wild type under both NA and CA conditions (Fig. 3, D–F). A change in freezing tolerance may reflect altered expression of cold-regulated genes, however, expression analysis of CBFs and CBF regulon genes indicated that the CBF pathway is functioning normally in atcsp3-2 (Fig. 4). On the other hand, several genes were identified that were down-regulated in atcsp3-2. Most of these down-regulated genes in atcsp3-2 have been linked to stress responses (supplemental Table S1 and Fig. 5); however, it is not yet clear how they are related or their potential mechanistic role in freezing tolerance. It is interesting to note that six of the down-regulated genes in atcsp3-2 are known to be up-regulated in the ada2b-1 mutant (43.Vlachonasios K.E. Thomashow M.F. Triezenberg S.J. Plant Cell. 2003; 15: 626-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). ADA2 is a histone acetyltransferase with a putative transcriptional adaptor function (43.Vlachonasios K.E. Thomashow M.F. Triezenberg S.J. Plant Cell. 2003; 15: 626-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 44.Stockinger E.J. Mao Y. Regier M.K. Triezenberg S.J. Thomashow M.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1524-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The ada2b-1 mutant is constitutively more freezing tolerant than wild-type plants without overexpressing COR genes (43.Vlachonasios K.E. Thomashow M.F. Triezenberg S.J. Plant Cell. 2003; 15: 626-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), suggesting there may be a cross-talk between the AtCSP3 and ADA2. Current information suggests that AtCSP3 controls the expression of genes that are necessary for freezing tolerance but are not CBF-regulated genes. Molecular genetic analyses of several mutants such as esk1 and hos9 have indicated a significant role for such CBF-independent pathways in freezing tolerance in Arabidopsis (5.Xin Z. Browse J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 7799-7804Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 6.Zhu J. Shi H. Lee B.H. Damsz B. Cheng S. Stirm V. Zhu J.K. Hasegawa P.M. Bressan R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Plant J. 2007; 49: 786-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar).The biochemical activity of AtCSP3 is very similar to that of WCSP1, unwinding dsDNA, and binding RNA and DNA (supplemental Fig. S1). In addition, AtCSP3 complemented the E. coli csp mutant (Fig. 1B). These data suggested that AtCSP3 functions as RNA chaperone in vivo. AtCSP3 may thus act to enhance translation of bulk or specific mRNA important for freezing tolerance by destabilizing RNA duplex produced under low temperature conditions. Another possibility is that AtCSP3 regulates mRNA stability by mediating RNA duplex formation, which can stabilize mRNA from exonucleolytic degradation. In bacterial systems, RNA chaperones regulate gene expression at both the transcription and post-transcription levels. Our data, together with the recent finding that bacterial CSPs can confer stress tolerance in plants (46.Castiglioni P. Warner D. Bensen R.J. Anstrom D.C. Harrison J. Stoecker M. Abad M. Kumar G.

https://openalex.org/W1973424072,"The role of Hedgehog (Hh) signaling as a developmental pathway is well established. Several recent studies have implicated a role for this pathway in multiple cancers. In this study we report that expression of GLI1 and osteopontin (OPN) increase progressively with the progression of melanoma from primary cutaneous cancer to metastatic melanoma in clinically derived specimens. We have further determined that OPN is a direct transcriptional target of GLI1. We have observed that OPN expression is stimulated in the presence of Hh ligands and inhibited in the presence of the Smoothened (SMO) inhibitor, cyclopamine. Transcriptional silencing of GLI1 negatively impacts OPN expression and compromises the ability of cancer cells to proliferate, migrate, and invade in vitro and interferes with their ability to grow as xenografts and spontaneously metastasize in nude mice. These altered attributes could be rescued by re-expressing OPN in the GLI1-silenced cells, suggesting that OPN is a critical downstream effector of active GLI1 signaling. Our observations lead us to conclude that the GLI1-mediated up-regulation of OPN promotes malignant behavior of cancer cells.

GLI1 is a strong transcriptional activator; GLI2 has both activator and repressor functions; and GLI3 is mostly a repressor (reviewed in Ref. 6Ruiz i Altaba A. Mas C. Stecca B.

In the Hh ligand-dependent pathway, in the absence of the ligand, Desert hedgehog, Indian hedgehog (IHH), or Sonic hedgehog (SHH), the Hh signaling pathway is inactive, GLI1 is sequestered in the cytoplasm and repressed for its transcription activity (7Ruiz i Altaba A.

Activation of Hh signaling results in transcriptional activation of the expression of several genes including insulin-like growth factor-binding protein, cyclin D2, and osteopontin (OPN) (11Yoon J.W.

In the present study, we report that the expression levels of GLI1 and OPN are significantly elevated in surgically excised metastatic melanoma specimens compared with surgically obtained basal and squamous cell carcinomas and primary melanoma samples. We further characterize the functional relevance of this association. Our observations from this study suggest that the Hh pathway acts via OPN to regulate malignant behavior of cancer cells.

However, to date, few universal target genes have been identified across different systems and much work still needs to be done to determine how Hh overexpression contributes to tumorigenesis.Our studies indicate that signaling via the Hh pathway can transcriptionally up-regulate OPN, an oncogene that has been widely reported to promote tumorigenesis, tumor progression, and metastasis in several cancer types. The regulation of OPN by the transcription factor GLI1 is integral to the malignant behavior of cancer cells as evidenced by the impaired ability of tumor cells to migrate, invade, and grow in vivo as xenografts when endogenous GLI1 expression is silenced. OPN is a secreted protein that influences multiple downstream signaling events that allows cancer cells to resist apoptosis, invade through extracellular matrix, evade host immunity (31Bellahcène A.

Clinically, OPN expression is up-regulated in several malignancies including breast cancer, melanoma, prostate cancer, colorectal cancer, and head and neck cancer (47Coppola D. Szabo M. Boulware D.

We reported that OPN constitutes a component of the secretome of several melanoma-derived cell lines (14Riker A.I. Enkemann S.A. Fodstad O. Liu S. Ren S. Morris C. Xi Y. Howell P. Metge B. Samant R.S. Shevde L.A. Li W. Eschrich S. Daud A. Ju J. Matta J. BMC Med. Genomics. 2008; 1: 13Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and is expressed in metastatic breast cancer cell lines (18Shevde L.A.

Independent studies have also reported an increase in levels of OPN in melanoma-derived cell lines (48Nemoto H. Rittling S.R. Yoshitake H. Furuya K. Amagasa T. Tsuji K. Nifuji A. Denhardt D.T. Noda M. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2001; 16: 652-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 49Rangaswami H. Kundu G.C. Oncol. Rep. 2007; 18: 909-915PubMed Google Scholar). Recent findings from our laboratory have revealed that expression of OPN is 13-fold higher when comparing thin melanomas to metastatic melanomas. 3B. J. Metge, S. Liu, A. I. Riker, O. Fodstad, R. S. Samant, and L. A. Shevde, manuscript in preparation. Our studies have revealed that the expression of GLI1 increases notably as cutaneous cancer progresses from a stage of melanoma in situ to intermediate and thick melanoma to metastatic melanoma. The increase in GLI1 expression is paralleled by an increase in OPN levels. Overall, our observations underscore the role of enhanced Hh signaling via increased GLI1 transcriptional activity in potentiating the malignant behavior of melanoma cells and contributing to disease progression. Our findings are in contrast to those reported by Stecca et al. (13Stecca B. Mas C. Clement V. Zbinden M. Correa R. Piguet V. Beermann F. Ruiz I. Altaba A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 5895-5900Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar) who did not find changes in expression levels of GLI1 in a limited set of sporadic human melanomas versus nevi. Nonetheless, they found that melanomas showed characteristically activated Hh signaling. The active Hh signaling may be due to ligand-dependent mechanisms, cell-intrinsic ligand-independent mechanisms, or cross-talk between the oncogenic Ras/Akt pathway and Hh/GLI signaling resulting in enhancements of GLI1 transcriptional activity (13Stecca B. Mas C. Clement V. Zbinden M. Correa R. Piguet V. Beermann F. Ruiz I. Altaba A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 5895-5900Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar).The Hh pathway has been reported to be aberrantly active in several cancer types, including breast cancer (50Xuan Y. Lin Z. J.

Hh pathway components were detected in nevi, melanoma, and lymph node metastases of melanoma (13Stecca B. Mas C. Clement V. Zbinden M. Correa R. Piguet V. Beermann F. Ruiz I. Altaba A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 5895-5900Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Enforced expression of GLI1 induced the expression of Snail (54Li X. Deng W. Lobo-Ruppert S.M. Ruppert J.M. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 4489-4498Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), whereas blockade of Hh signaling by the inhibitor cyclopamine suppressed pancreatic cancer invasion and metastasis by inhibiting EMT (55Wu Y. Evers B.M. Zhou B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 640-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Our study is in agreement with these reports because we have documented a loss of mesenchymal markers by abrogating GLI1 expression. EMT-related genes (N-cadherin, OPN, and osteonectin) have been reported to contribute to the promotion of the metastatic phenotype in primary cutaneous malignant melanomas by supporting specific adhesive, invasive, and migratory properties (56Alonso S.R. Tracey L. Ortiz P. Pérez-Gómez B. Palacios J. Pollán M. Linares J. Serrano S. Sáez-Castillo A.I. Sánchez L. Pajares R. Sánchez-Aguilera A. Artiga M.J. Piris M.A. Rodríguez-Peralto J.L. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 3450-3460Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Moreover, these findings support our observations showing that GLI1 silencing attenuates malignancy-associated attributes, such as invasion, migration, and motility.Interestingly, our results show that GLI1 silencing retards the tumor (xenograft) rate only in the early phase. After day 11 post-injection, the growth of GLI1-silenced tumors proceeded at the same rate as that of controls. This data can have multiple implications. First, it is likely that over time, a revertant population outgrew the GLI1-silenced cells. These revertants may have either lost the effects of RNA interference or may have by-passed the requirement for GLI1 signaling. In this case, the cells may have utilized other signaling pathways to up-regulate OPN. Second, trace levels of OPN secreted by GLI1-silenced cells (Fig. 3A) can accumulate in the local microenvironment from the growing tumor and may have stimulated cell growth. Overall, GLI1 silencing had a pronounced effect on tumor malignancy in vivo by reducing metastasis.We have used the MDA-MB-435 cell line as a model to address and investigate our hypothesis because it has been reported to produce abundant levels of OPN (16Samant R.S.

This cell line has been at the center of controversy, which has called its origin into question, with the common consensus that it is of melanocytic origin (60Ellison G. Klinowska T. Westwood R.F.

Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 3479-3485Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), and is the most reliable and widely used cell line model to study spontaneous metastasis following xenograft establishment in the mammary fat pads. Our study in this model system, which endogenously expresses high levels of OPN, supports a role for the Hh pathway in regulating malignant cell behavior. Moreover, our findings can have implications on multiple cancer histotypes that overexpress OPN (65Brown L.F. Papadopoulos-Sergiou A. Berse B. Manseau E.J. Tognazzi K. Perruzzi C.A. Dvorak H.F. Senger D.R. Am. J. Pathol. 1994; 145: 610-623PubMed Google Scholar).Our findings can have two implications. First, it is interesting that the Hh ligands and OPN, the signaling intermediate of the active Hh pathway, are secreted molecules. This allows them to influence the behavior of cells in the tumor microenvironment. OPN has been documented to influence the behavior of cells in a paracrine manner. Although serum OPN influences the migratory behavior of melanoma cells (66Hayashi C. Rittling S. Hayata T. Amagasa T. Denhardt D. Ezura Y. Nakashima K. Noda M. J. Cell. Biochem. 2007; 101: 979-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and tumor-derived OPN inhibits nitric-oxide synthase activity of macrophages (67Wai P.Y. Guo L. Gao C. Mi Z. Guo H. Kuo P.C. Surgery. 2006; 140: 132-140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), OPN produced by fibroblasts is able to influence growth of pre-neoplastic cells (68Pazolli E. Luo X. Brehm S. Carbery K. Chung J.J. Prior J.L. Doherty J. Demehri S. Salavaggione L. Piwnica-Worms D. Stewart S.A. Cancer Res. 2009; 69: 1230-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that active Hh signaling in a subset of cancer cells can potentially be amplified by secretion of OPN into the tumor microenvironment. The secreted OPN, in turn, can promote malignant behavior in neighboring cancer cells, regardless of the status of the Hh pathway. Second, whereas OPN is capable of long-range signaling, the secreted Hh ligand proteins participate in short-range signaling and can move many cell diameters from their source of production and often control developmental outcomes in a concentration-dependent manner (10Ingham P.W. McMahon A.P. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3059-3087Crossref PubMed Scopus (2441) Google Scholar). For example, during ventral spinal cord patterning, SHH forms a ventral-to-dorsal gradient with different concentrations specifying distinct pools of neural progenitors (69Stamataki D. Ulloa F. Tsoni S.V. Mynett A. Briscoe J. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 626-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). It is likely that such a situation also prevails in a tumor; in which case, the Hh ligands produced by a subpopulation of cells within a tumor can trigger activation of the pathway in the recipient cell.Metastatic melanoma continues to be a devastating disease with grim prognosis and a very limited availability of FDA approved agents for its treatment. The Hh pathway has been the subject of intense investigation as a therapeutic target with inhibitors in clinical trials. Our study draws attention for these Hh inhibitors to be explored for treating metastatic melanoma with the prospect that OPN may serve as a surrogate marker of monitoring the effectivity of Hh inhibitors.

Hh signaling in mammalian cells is mediated by the GLI family of zinc finger transcription factors comprising GLI1, GLI2, and GLI3. GLI1 is a strong transcriptional activator; GLI2 has both activator and repressor functions; and GLI3 is mostly a repressor (reviewed in Ref. 6Ruiz i Altaba A. Mas C. Stecca B. Trends Cell Biol. 2007; 17: 438-447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). In the Hh ligand-dependent pathway, in the absence of the ligand, Desert hedgehog, Indian hedgehog (IHH), or Sonic hedgehog (SHH), the Hh signaling pathway is inactive, GLI1 is sequestered in the cytoplasm and repressed for its transcription activity (7Ruiz i Altaba A.

https://openalex.org/W2055064679,"A central question in Wnt signaling is the regulation of beta-catenin phosphorylation and degradation. Multiple kinases, including CKI alpha and GSK3, are involved in beta-catenin phosphorylation. Protein phosphatases such as PP2A and PP1 have been implicated in the regulation of beta-catenin. However, which phosphatase dephosphorylates beta-catenin in vivo and how the specificity of beta-catenin dephosphorylation is regulated are not clear. In this study, we show that PP2A regulates beta-catenin phosphorylation and degradation in vivo. We demonstrate that PP2A is required for Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in Drosophila. Moreover, we have identified PR55 alpha as the regulatory subunit of PP2A that controls beta-catenin phosphorylation and degradation. PR55 alpha, but not the catalytic subunit, PP2Ac, directly interacts with beta-catenin. RNA interference knockdown of PR55 alpha elevates beta-catenin phosphorylation and decreases Wnt signaling, whereas overexpressing PR55 alpha enhances Wnt signaling. Taken together, our results suggest that PR55 alpha specifically regulates PP2A-mediated beta-catenin dephosphorylation and plays an essential role in Wnt signaling."

When it comes to more fundamental dynamics studies, though, which involve probing gas-phase molecules in specific quantum mechanical states, the experiments still tend to require much larger interaction areas. Meek et al. (p. 1699 ) take a step toward miniaturization in this latter regime by demonstrating the isolation of a cold gas-phase beam of CO molecules just above a microelectrode-decorated chip. The technique relies on rapidly modulated electric fields that trap and then slow down the incoming molecules through dipole interactions. Once brought to a stop, the molecules can be held on the chip for a discrete period and then released to a detector."
https://openalex.org/W2022570758,"Sequential proliferation, hypertrophy and maturation of chondrocytes are required for proper endochondral bone development and tightly regulated by cell signaling. The canonical Wnt signaling pathway acts through β-catenin to promote chondrocyte hypertrophy whereas PTHrP signaling inhibits it by holding chondrocytes in proliferating states. Here we show by genetic approaches that chondrocyte hypertrophy and final maturation are two distinct developmental processes that are differentially regulated by Wnt/β-catenin and PTHrP signaling. Wnt/β-catenin signaling regulates initiation of chondrocyte hypertrophy by inhibiting PTHrP signaling activity, but it does not regulate PTHrP expression. In addition, Wnt/β-catenin signaling regulates chondrocyte hypertrophy in a non-cell autonomous manner and Gdf5/Bmp signaling may be one of the downstream pathways. Furthermore, Wnt/β-catenin signaling also controls final maturation of hypertrophic chondrocytes, but such regulation is PTHrP signaling-independent."

Here, we propose a mechanism whereby TAK1 is activated by TGF-β1 in primary mouse mesangial cells. Under unstimulated conditions, endogenous TAK1 is stably associated with TβRI. TGF-β1 stimulation causes rapid dissociation from the receptor and induces TAK1 phosphorylation. Deletion mutant analysis indicates that the juxtamembrane region including the GS domain of TβRI is crucial for its interaction with TAK1. Both TβRI-mediated TAK1 phosphorylation and TGF-β1-induced TAK1 phosphorylation do not require kinase activity of TβRI. Moreover, TβRI-mediated TAK1 phosphorylation correlates with the degree of its association with TβRI and requires kinase activity of TAK1. TAB1 does not interact with TGF-β receptors, but TAB1 is indispensable for TGF-β1-induced TAK1 activation. We also show that TRAF6 and TAB2 are required for the interaction of TAK1 with TβRI and TGF-β1-induced TAK1 activation in mouse mesangial cells. Taken together, our data indicate that TGF-β1-induced interaction of TβRI and TβRII triggers dissociation of TAK1 from TβRI, and subsequently TAK1 is phosphorylated through TAB1-mediated autophosphorylation and not by the receptor kinase activity of TβRI.

TGF-β1, the prototype of TGF-β family, is a potent inducer of extracellular matrix synthesis and is well established as a central mediator in the final common pathway of fibrosis associated with progressive kidney diseases (3Border W.A.

Upon ligand stimulation, TGF-β type I (TβRI) and type II (TβRII) receptors form heterotetrameric complexes, by which TβRI is phosphorylated in the GS domain and activated. Smad signaling pathway is well established as a canonical pathway induced by TGF-β1 (5Massagué J. Blain S.W. Lo R.S.

After phosphorylation, receptor-regulated Smads are rapidly dissociated from TβRI and interact with common Smad (Smad4) followed by nuclear translocation.

For TAK1 activation, phosphorylation at Thr-187 and Ser-192 in the activation loop of TAK1 is essentially required (29Sakurai H. Miyoshi H. Mizukami J. Sugita T.

TAK1 can transduce signals to several downstream signaling cascades, including the MAPK kinase (MKK) 4/7-JNK cascade, MKK3/6-p38 MAPK cascade, and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB)-inducing kinase-IκB kinase cascade (26Ninomiya-Tsuji J.

FEBS Lett. 2000; 467: 160-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). A recent report has shown that TAK1 is also activated by agonists of AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) and ischemia, which in turn activates the LKB1/AMPK pathway, a pivotal energy-sensor pathway (32Xie M. Zhang D. Dyck J.R. Li Y. Zhang H. Morishima M. Mann D.L. Taffet G.E. Baldini A. Khoury D.S. Schneider M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

We and others have previously demonstrated that TAK1 is a major mediator of TGF-β1-induced type I collagen and fibronectin expression through activation of the MKK3-p38 MAPK and MKK4-JNK signaling cascades, respectively (34Ono K.

Furthermore, increased expression and activation of TAK1 enhance p38 phosphorylation and promote interstitial fibrosis in the myocardium from 9-day-old TAK1 transgenic mice (37Zhang D. Gaussin V.

These data implicate a crucial role of TAK1 in extracellular matrix production and tissue fibrosis. TAK1 is also implicated in regulation of cell cycle (38Terada Y. Nakashima O. Inoshita S.

Thus, TAK1 may function as an important regulator and mediator of TGF-β1-induced Smad-dependent and Smad-independent signaling pathways. It has been demonstrated that TAK1 can be activated by the interaction with TAK1-binding protein 1 (TAB1) by in vitro binding assays and in overexpression studies (29Sakurai H. Miyoshi H. Mizukami J. Sugita T. FEBS Lett. 2000; 474: 141-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 30Kishimoto K. Matsumoto K. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. J. Biol.

In embryonic fibroblasts from TAB1 null mice, IL-1 and TNF-α could induce TAK1-mediated NF-κB and JNK activation (45Shim J.H. Xiao C. Paschal A.E. Bailey S.T. Rao P. Hayden M.S. Lee K.Y. Bussey C.

Ligand binding of IL-1 receptor (IL-1R) results in recruitment of MyD88, which serves as an adaptor for IL-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK) 1 and 4. Subsequently IRAK1 is hyperphosphorylated and induces interaction with TNF-α receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), resulting in TRAF6 oligomerization. After oligomerization of TRAF6, IRAK1-TRAF6 complex is dissociated from the receptor and associated with TAK1, which is mediated by TAB2 (or TAB3). In this process polyubiquitination of TRAF6 by Ubc13/Uev1A is thought to be critical for the association with TAB2 (or TAB3), which links TAK1 activation (46Takaesu G. Kishida S. Hiyama A. Yamaguchi K. Shibuya H. Irie K. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Matsumoto K. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 649-658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar, 54Wang C. Deng L. Hong M. Akkaraju G.R.

Cell. 2004; 15: 535-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar). In the case of TNF-α stimulation, TNF-α receptors form trimers and recruit adaptor proteins, TRAF2/5, and receptor-interacting protein 1 on the membrane. Ubc13/Uev1A- and TRAF2-dependent polyubiquitination of receptor-interacting protein 1 induce association of TAB2 (or TAB3), which then activates TAK1. Thus, TAB2 is required for ubiquitin-dependent activation of TAK1 by TRAFs. On the other hand, it has been demonstrated that hematopoietic progenitor kinase 1 plays a role as an upstream mediator of TGF-β-induced TAK1 activation, which in turn activates the MKK4-JNK signaling cascade in 293T cells (56Wang W. Zhou G. Hu M.C. Yao Z. Tan T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22771-22775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 57Zhou G. Lee S.C. Yao Z. Tan T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13133-13138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Besides hematopoietic progenitor kinase 1, it has been also suggested that X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP) might link TAK1 to TGF-β/BMP receptors through the capability of XIAP to interact with TGF-β/BMP receptors and TAB1 (58Yamaguchi K. Nagai S. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Nishita M. Tamai K. Irie K. Ueno N. Nishida E. Shibuya H. Matsumoto K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Thus, although various molecules participate in the activation of TAK1, the precise mechanism by which TGF-β1 induces TAK1 activation is incompletely understood. Here, we provide evidence that the association of TAK1 with TGF-β receptors is important for TGF-β1-induced activation of TAK1 in mouse mesangial cells. TGF-β1 stimulation induces interaction of TβRI and TβRII, triggering dissociation of TAK1 from TβRI, and subsequently TAK1 is phosphorylated through TAB1-mediated autophosphorylation, independent of receptor kinase activity of TβRI. Recombinant human TGF-β1 was obtained from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Antibodies against HA (Y-11), His6, TAK1, TβRI, TβRII, and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Polyclonal antibodies against MKK3, p-MKK3/6, p-Thr-187-TAK1 (p187-TAK1), p-Thr-184-TAK1, TAB1, and p-Smad3 were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA).

Primary mouse mesangial cells (MMC) established in culture were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 15% FBS, 100 units/ml of penicillin, and 100 μg/ml of streptomycin.

In brief, cells grown to ∼60% confluence on either 100- or 60-mm dishes were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and transfected with 1 μg (for 100-mm dish) or 0.3 μg (for 60-mm dish) of the respective plasmids for 4 h under serum-free conditions.

TAK1 cDNAs for wild type and kinase-deficient mutant were amplified by using PCR with TAK1 primer set (forward primer, 5′-GGATCCGGGATCATGTCGACAGCCTCCGC-3′; reverse primer, 5′-CGCGGTACCTGAAGTGCCTTGTCGTTTCTG-3′) and re-cloned using pcDNA3.1/V5-His TOPO TA expression kit, and V5/His-TAK1 and V5/His-TAK1-KD were obtained. The phosphorylation site mutant of TAK1 (V5/His-TAK1-TA (T187A)) and polyubiquitination site mutant of TAK1 (V5/His-TAK1-K34R) were produced by PCR-based mutagenesis with mutagenic primer sets (TAK1-T187A forward primer, 5′-CAAACACACATGGCCAATAATAAAG-3′; TAK1-T187A reverse primer, 5′-CTTTATTATTGGTCATGTGTGTTTG-3′; TAK1-K34R forward primer, 5′-CCTGAACTTCGAGGAGATCGACTACAGGGAGATCGAGGTGGAA-3′; TAK1-K34R-reverse primer, 5′-CCACCTCGATCTCCCTGTAGTCGATCTCTCGAAGTTCAGGACC-3′) and the TAK1 primer set. The resulting construct was confirmed by sequencing. HA-tagged wild type TβRI (pCMV5B-HA-TβRI-WT), kinase-deficient mutant TβRI (pCMV5B-HA-TβRI-KD (K232R)), His-tagged TβRII (pCMV5B-His-TβRII-WT), and kinase-deficient TβRII (pCMV5B-His-TβRII-KD (K227R)) were obtained from J. Wrana (62Choi M.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: F88-F95Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) through Addgene (Cambridge, MA). V5/His-tagged wild type TβRI (V5/His-ΤβRΙ) was re-cloned in pcDNA3.1/V5-His TOPO TA expression vector after PCR using rat TβRI cDNA as a template (62Choi M.E. Am. J.

Various point mutations were introduced into V5/His-tagged TβRI by PCR-based mutagenesis with the RI primer set and respective mutagenic primer set. The constitutively active mutant of rat TβRI (V5/His-TβRI-CA (T198D)) was obtained with the mutagenic primer set (RI-T198D forward primer, 5′-GATATCGTGCTACAAGAAAGC-3′; RI-T198D reverse primer, 5′-GCTTTCTTGTAGCACGATATC-3′). The kinase-deficient mutant of rat TβRI (V5/His-TβRI-KD (K226R)) was produced with the primer set RI-K226R forward primer (5′-GGAATATTCTCTTCTAGAGAAGAA-3′) and RI-K226R reverse primer (5′-TTCTTCTCTAGAAGAGAATATTCC-3′). The GS domain mutant of rat TβRI (V5/His-TβRI-GS) bearing mutations of five phosphorylation sites in the GS domain (T185V, T186V, S187A, S189A, S191A) was produced with the RI-GS mutagenic primer set (RI-GS forward primer, 5′-GTAGTTGCAGGGGCAGGAGCCGGCTTACCACTGCTTGTTCAA-3′; RI-GS reverse primer, 5′-TTGAACAAGCAGTGGTAAGCCGGCTCCTGCCCCTGCAACTAC-3′). Each of the PCR products was re-cloned in pcDNA3.1/V5-His TOPO TA expression vector, and correct clones were confirmed by sequencing. Deletion mutant versions of rat TβRI (V5/His-ΤβRI-LC and V5/His-ΤβRI-SC) were generated by PCR with the RI forward primer and respective reverse primers (RI-LC reverse primer, 5′-CCCAAGCTTTTCATGGCGTAACATTACAGTCTG-3′ or RI-SC reverse primer, 5′-CCCAAGCTTCACGCGGTGGTGAATGACAGTG-3′). V5/His-TβRI-SC (amino acids 1–151) contains only nine amino acids with the partial TRAF6 binding motif after the transmembrane domain, whereas V5/His-TβRI-LC (amino acids 1–255) harbors the juxtamembrane region, GS domain, and a portion of the kinase domain excluding the L45 loop. The construction of rat HA-tagged TβRII and C-terminal-truncated mutant TβRII (HA-TβRII and HA-TβRIIΔC) was previously described (63Chin B.Y. Mohsenin A Li S.X. Choi A.M. Choi M.E. Am. J. Physiol.

Transfection of siRNA using DharmaFECTTM4 reagent was carried out according to the manufacturer舗s instructions. Briefly, cells were grown to 50% confluence on 60-mm dishes in 3 ml of media supplemented with 15% FBS. Twenty microliters of respective siRNA (total 400 μmol) were added to 380 μl of serum-free media and mixed with 400 μl of serum-free media containing 8 μl of DharmaFECTTM4. After 20 min, 3.2 ml of media containing 15% serum were added to prepare siRNA transfection media. For transfection, culture media were replaced with the siRNA transfection media. The final concentration of respective siRNA was 100 nm for each transfection. After transfection, cells were incubated in medium containing 15% FBS for 48 h, then rendered quiescent in medium supplemented with 0.5% FBS for 16 h before each experiment. Cells were washed once with ice-cold PBS and lysed in buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 12.5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm NaF, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 20 μm aprotinin. Cells were disrupted by using sonication and then centrifuged for 15 min at 14,000 × g at 4 °C to remove cellular debris. The protein concentration of cell lysates was determined by BCA protein assay reagent kit (Pierce). For Western blotting, protein samples (50–100 μg) were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE and then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were blocked with either 5% nonfat milk or 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 1 h and then incubated with primary antibodies overnight on a rocker at 4 °C. The membranes were washed 3 times (15 min each) with TTBS buffer (10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20) and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies for 30 min at room temperature. The target proteins were detected with LumiGLO (Cell Signaling Technologies). In the case of immunoprecipitation experiments, 200–500 μg of cell lysates were pre-cleaned with either normal mouse or rabbit IgG with protein A/G-agarose for 2 h at 4 °C. Cell lysates were transferred to fresh tube and reacted with 2 μg of primary antibodies for 30 min at 4 °C followed by precipitation with 20 μl of protein A/G-agarose for 2 h for proteins overexpressed or overnight for endogenous proteins at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were then washed three times with the lysis buffer and subjected to Western blotting. MMC grown to 70% confluence were rendered quiescent in medium supplemented with 0.5% FBS for 16 h, then stimulated with TGF-β1 (2 ng/ml) for the indicated times.

https://openalex.org/W2034215779,"Formulation of DNA/cationic lipid complexes (lipoplexes) designed for nucleic acid delivery mostly results in positively charged particles which are thought to enter cells by endocytosis. We recently developed a lipoplex formulation called Neutraplex that allows preparation of both cationic and anionic stable complexes with similar lipid content and ultrastructure.To assess whether the global net charge could influence cell uptake and activity of the transported oligonucleotides (on), we prepared lipoplexes with positive and negative charges and compared: (i) their physicochemical properties by zeta potential analysis and dynamic light scattering, (ii) their cell uptake by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry, and (iii) the biological activity of the transported ON using a splicing correction assay. We show that positively or negatively charged lipoplexes enter cells cells using both temperature-dependent and -independent uptake mechanisms. Specifically, positively charged lipoplexes predominantly use a temperature-dependent transport when cells are incubated OptiMEM medium. Anionic lipoplexes favour an energy-independent transport and show higher ON activity than cationic lipoplexes in presence of serum. However, lipoplexes with high positive global net charge and OptiMEM medium give the highest uptake and ON activity levels.These findings suggest that, in addition to endocytosis, lipoplexes may enter cell via a temperature-independent mechanism, which could be mediated by lipid mixing. Such characteristics might arise from the specific lipoplex ultrastructure and should be taken into consideration when developing lipoplexes designed for in vivo or ex vivo nucleic acid transfer."
https://openalex.org/W2062386611,"NMR Under Stormy Conditions Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy is immensely useful for molecular characterization. However, the resolution necessary for making fine structural distinctions relies on sample isolation in a surrounding magnetic field that exhibits minimal variation in space and time over the course of the measurement; this requirement limits the range of materials that can be easily probed. Pelupessy et al. (p. 1693 ) present an approach that circumvents the need for spatiotemporal field homogeneity by detecting coherence transfer among coupled spins. Whereas prior methods have compensated for heterogeneity by applying corrective magnetic fields, this technique relies on the inherent insensitivity of the measured coherences to changes in the local magnetic environment and thus can be applied without prior knowledge of the field variation profile."
https://openalex.org/W1982581071,"Genes essential for bacterial growth are of particular scientific interest. Many putative essential genes have been identified or predicted in several species, however, little is known about gene expression requirement stringency, which may be an important aspect of bacterial physiology and likely a determining factor in drug target development.Working from the premise that essential genes differ in absolute requirement for growth, we describe silencing of putative essential genes in E. coli to obtain a titration of declining growth rates and transcript levels by using antisense peptide nucleic acids (PNA) and expressed antisense RNA. The relationship between mRNA decline and growth rate decline reflects the degree of essentiality, or stringency, of an essential gene, which is here defined by the minimum transcript level for a 50% reduction in growth rate (MTL(50)). When applied to four growth essential genes, both RNA silencing methods resulted in MTL(50) values that reveal acpP as the most stringently required of the four genes examined, with ftsZ the next most stringently required. The established antibacterial targets murA and fabI were less stringently required.RNA silencing can reveal stringent requirements for gene expression with respect to growth. This method may be used to validate existing essential genes and to quantify drug target requirement."
https://openalex.org/W1973010322,"Oseltamivir (Tamiflu) is the most important antiviral drug available and a cornerstone in the defence against a future influenza pandemic. Recent publications have shown that the active metabolite, oseltamivir carboxylate (OC), is not degraded in sewage treatment plants and is also persistent in aquatic environments. This implies that OC will be present in aquatic environments in areas where oseltamivir is prescribed to patients for therapeutic use. The country where oseltamivir is used most is Japan, where it is used to treat seasonal flu. We measured the levels of OC in water samples from the Yodo River system in the Kyoto and Osaka prefectures, Japan, taken before and during the flu-season 2007/8. No OC was detected before the flu-season but 2-58 ng L(-1) was detected in the samples taken during the flu season. This study shows, for the first time, that low levels of oseltamivir can be found in the aquatic environment. Therefore the natural reservoir of influenza virus, dabbling ducks, is exposed to oseltamivir, which could promote the evolution of viral resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2077111041,"The Group VIA-2 Ca(2+)-independent phospholipase A(2) (GVIA-2 iPLA(2)) is composed of seven consecutive N-terminal ankyrin repeats, a linker region, and a C-terminal phospholipase catalytic domain. No structural information exists for this enzyme, and no information is known about the membrane binding surface. We carried out deuterium exchange experiments with the GVIA-2 iPLA(2) in the presence of both phospholipid substrate and the covalent inhibitor methyl arachidonoyl fluorophosphonate and located regions in the protein that change upon lipid binding. No changes were seen in the presence of only methyl arachidonoyl fluorophosphonate. The region with the greatest change upon lipid binding was region 708-730, which showed a >70% decrease in deuteration levels at numerous time points. No decreases in exchange due to phospholipid binding were seen in the ankyrin repeat domain of the protein. To locate regions with changes in exchange on the enzyme, we constructed a computational homology model based on homologous structures. This model was validated by comparing the deuterium exchange results with the predicted structure. Our model combined with the deuterium exchange results in the presence of lipid substrate have allowed us to propose the first structural model of GVIA-2 iPLA(2) as well as the interfacial lipid binding region."

https://openalex.org/W2008921252,"AGGF1 is an angiogenic factor, and its deregulation is associated with a vascular malformation consistent with Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome (KTS). This study defines the molecular mechanism for transcriptional regulation of AGGF1 expression. Transcription of AGGF1 starts at two nearby sites, -367 and -364 bp upstream of the translation start site. Analyses of 5'- and 3'-serial promoter deletions defined the core promoter/regulatory elements, including two repressor sites (from -1971 to -3990 and from -7521 to -8391, respectively) and two activator sites (a GATA1 consensus binding site from -295 to -300 and a second activator site from -129 to -159). Both the GATA1 site and the second activator site are essential for AGGF1 expression. A similar expression profile was found for GATA1 and AGGF1 in cells (including various endothelial cells) and tissues. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that GATA1 was able to bind to the AGGF1 DNA in vitro and in vivo. Overexpression of GATA1 increased expression of AGGF1. We identified one rare polymorphism -294C>T in a sporadic KTS patient, which is located in the GATA1 site, disrupts binding of GATA1 to DNA, and abolishes the GATA1 stimulatory effect on transcription of AGGF1. Knockdown of GATA1 expression by siRNA reduced expression of AGGF1, and resulted in endothelial cell apoptosis and inhibition of endothelial capillary vessel formation and cell migration, which was rescued by purified recombinant human AGGF1 protein. These results demonstrate that GATA1 regulates expression of AGGF1 and reveal a novel role for GATA1 in endothelial cell biology and angiogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1972527632,"Two's a Crowd The process by which males and females compete to maximize their individual fitness also affects the fitness of their offspring. Sexual selection largely results from polyandry (multiple mating by females), and several competing hypotheses attempt to explain the evolution of polyandry. Bilde et al. (p. 1705 ) staged double mating experiments in seed beetles to distinguish between the theories underlying cryptic female choice and sexual antagonism. Contrary to expectation, males of high genetic quality, as measured on the basis of the number of offspring sired when singly mated to a female, consistently produced fewer offspring when females were doubly mated to males of both high and low genetic quality. Thus, postmating sexual selection can favor male genotypes with low fitness, and females risk genetic costs when mating with multiple males."
https://openalex.org/W2006681997,"Pak1 (p21 activated kinase 1) is a serine/threonine kinase implicated in regulation of cell motility and survival and in malignant transformation of mammary epithelial cells. In addition, the dynein light chain, LC8, has been described to cooperate with Pak1 in malignant transformation of breast cancer cells. Pak1 itself may aid breast cancer development by phosphorylating nuclear proteins, including estrogen receptor alpha. Recently, we showed that the LC8 binding site on Pak1 is adjacent to the nuclear localization sequence (NLS) required for Pak1 nuclear import. Here, we demonstrate that the LC8-Pak1 interaction is necessary for epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced nuclear import of Pak1 in MCF-7 cells, and that this event is contingent upon LC8-mediated Pak1 dimerization. In contrast, Pak2, which lacks an LC8 binding site but contains a nuclear localization sequence identical to that in Pak1, remains cytoplasmic upon EGF stimulation of MCF-7 cells. Furthermore, we show that severe developmental defects in zebrafish embryos caused by morpholino injections targeting Pak are partially rescued by co-injection of wild-type human Pak1, but not by co-injection of mutant Pak1 mRNA disrupting either the LC8 binding or the NLS site. Collectively, these results suggest that LC8 facilitates nuclear import of Pak1 and that this function is indispensable during vertebrate development."
https://openalex.org/W1998757373,"We previously reported no benefit of early weaning for HIV-free survival of children born to HIV-infected mothers in intent-to-treat analyses. Since early weaning was poorly accepted, we conducted a secondary analysis to investigate whether beneficial effects may have been hidden.958 HIV-infected women in Lusaka, Zambia, were randomized to abrupt weaning at 4 months (intervention) or to continued breastfeeding (control). Children were followed to 24 months with regular HIV PCR tests and examinations to determine HIV infection or death. Detailed behavioral data were collected on when all breastfeeding ended. Most participants were recruited before antiretroviral treatment (ART) became available. We compared outcomes among mother-child pairs who weaned earlier or later than intended by study design adjusting for potential confounders.Of infants alive, uninfected and still breastfeeding at 4 months in the intervention group, 16.1% who weaned as instructed acquired HIV or died by 24 months compared to 16.0% who did not comply (p = 0.98). Children of women with less severe disease during pregnancy (not eligible for ART) had worse outcomes if their mothers weaned as instructed (RH = 2.60 95% CI: 1.06-6.36) compared to those who continued breastfeeding. Conversely, children of mothers with more severe disease (eligible for ART but did not receive it) who weaned early had better outcomes (p-value interaction = 0.002). In the control group, weaning before 15 months was associated with 3.94-fold (95% CI: 1.65-9.39) increase in HIV infection or death among infants of mothers with less severe disease.Incomplete adherence did not mask a benefit of early weaning. On the contrary, for women with less severe disease, early weaning was harmful and continued breastfeeding resulted in better outcomes. For women with more advanced disease, ART should be given during pregnancy for maternal health and to reduce transmission, including through breastfeeding.(ClinicalTrials.gov) NCT00310726."
https://openalex.org/W2103547092,"Much attention has recently been given to the statistical significance of topological features observed in biological networks. Here, we consider residue interaction graphs (RIGs) as network representations of protein structures with residues as nodes and inter-residue interactions as edges. Degree-preserving randomized models have been widely used for this purpose in biomolecular networks. However, such a single summary statistic of a network may not be detailed enough to capture the complex topological characteristics of protein structures and their network counterparts. Here, we investigate a variety of topological properties of RIGs to find a well fitting network null model for them. The RIGs are derived from a structurally diverse protein data set at various distance cut-offs and for different groups of interacting atoms. We compare the network structure of RIGs to several random graph models. We show that 3-dimensional geometric random graphs, that model spatial relationships between objects, provide the best fit to RIGs. We investigate the relationship between the strength of the fit and various protein structural features. We show that the fit depends on protein size, structural class, and thermostability, but not on quaternary structure. We apply our model to the identification of significantly over-represented structural building blocks, i.e., network motifs, in protein structure networks. As expected, choosing geometric graphs as a null model results in the most specific identification of motifs. Our geometric random graph model may facilitate further graph-based studies of protein conformation space and have important implications for protein structure comparison and prediction. The choice of a well-fitting null model is crucial for finding structural motifs that play an important role in protein folding, stability and function. To our knowledge, this is the first study that addresses the challenge of finding an optimized null model for RIGs, by comparing various RIG definitions against a series of network models."

https://openalex.org/W2053346629,"Phagocytosis has been extensively examined in 'professional' phagocytic cells using pH sensitive dyes. However, in many of the previous studies, a separation between the end of internalization, beginning of acidification and completion of phagosomal-endosomal/lysosomal fusion was not clearly established. In addition, very little work has been done to systematically examine phagosomal maturation in 'non-professional' phagocytic cells. Therefore, in this study, we developed a simple method to measure and decouple particle internalization, phagosomal acidification and phagosomal-endosomal/lysosomal fusion in Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) and Caco-2 epithelial cells.Our method was developed using a pathogen mimetic system consisting of polystyrene beads coated with Internalin A (InlA), a membrane surface protein from Listeria monocytogenes known to trigger receptor-mediated phagocytosis. We were able to independently measure the rates of internalization, phagosomal acidification and phagosomal-endosomal/lysosomal fusion in epithelial cells by combining the InlA-coated beads (InlA-beads) with antibody quenching, a pH sensitive dye and an endosomal/lysosomal dye. By performing these independent measurements under identical experimental conditions, we were able to decouple the three processes and establish time scales for each. In a separate set of experiments, we exploited the phagosomal acidification process to demonstrate an additional, real-time method for tracking bead binding, internalization and phagosomal acidification.Using this method, we found that the time scales for internalization, phagosomal acidification and phagosomal-endosomal/lysosomal fusion ranged from 23-32 min, 3-4 min and 74-120 min, respectively, for MDCK and Caco-2 epithelial cells. Both the static and real-time methods developed here are expected to be readily and broadly applicable, as they simply require fluorophore conjugation to a particle of interest, such as a pathogen or mimetic, in combination with common cell labeling dyes. As such, these methods hold promise for future measurements of receptor-mediated internalization in other cell systems, e.g. pathogen-host systems."
https://openalex.org/W2135383500,"Traditionally, immunology has considered a meaningful antibody response to be marked by large amounts of high-affinity antibodies reactive with the specific inciting antigen; the detection of small amounts of low-affinity antibodies binding to seemingly unrelated antigens has been considered to be beneath the threshold of immunological meaning. A systems-biology approach to immunology, however, suggests that large-scale patterns in the antibody repertoire might also reflect the functional state of the immune system. To investigate such global patterns of antibodies, we have used an antigen-microarray device combined with informatic analysis. Here we asked whether antibody-repertoire patterns might reflect the state of an implanted tumor. We studied the serum antibodies of inbred C57BL/6 mice before and after implantation of syngeneic 3LL tumor cells of either metastatic or non-metastatic clones. We analyzed patterns of IgG and IgM autoantibodies binding to over 300 self-antigens arrayed on slides using support vector machines and genetic algorithm techniques. We now report that antibody patterns, but not single antibodies, were informative: 1) mice, even before tumor implantation, manifest both individual and common patterns of low-titer natural autoantibodies; 2) the patterns of these autoantibodies respond to the growth of the tumor cells, and can distinguish between metastatic and non-metastatic tumor clones; and 3) curative tumor resection induces dynamic changes in these low-titer autoantibody patterns. The informative patterns included autoantibodies binding to self-molecules not known to be tumor-associated antigens (including insulin, DNA, myosin, fibrinogen) as well as to known tumor-associated antigens (including p53, cytokeratin, carbonic anhydrases, tyrosinase). Thus, low-titer autoantibodies that are not the direct products of tumor-specific immunization can still generate an immune biomarker of the body-tumor interaction. System-wide profiling of autoantibody repertoires can be informative."
https://openalex.org/W2068517086,"Murine natural killer (NK) cells express inhibitory Ly49 receptors for MHC class I molecules, which allows for “missing self” recognition of cells that downregulate MHC class I expression. During murine NK cell development, host MHC class I molecules impose an “educating impact” on the NK cell pool. As a result, mice with different MHC class I expression display different frequency distributions of Ly49 receptor combinations on NK cells. Two models have been put forward to explain this impact. The two-step selection model proposes a stochastic Ly49 receptor expression followed by selection for NK cells expressing appropriate receptor combinations. The sequential model, on the other hand, proposes that each NK cell sequentially expresses Ly49 receptors until an interaction of sufficient magnitude with self-class I MHC is reached for the NK cell to mature. With the aim to clarify which one of these models is most likely to reflect the actual biological process, we simulated the two educational schemes by mathematical modelling, and fitted the results to Ly49 expression patterns, which were analyzed in mice expressing single MHC class I molecules. Our results favour the two-step selection model over the sequential model. Furthermore, the MHC class I environment favoured maturation of NK cells expressing one or a few self receptors, suggesting a possible step of positive selection in NK cell education. Based on the predicted Ly49 binding preferences revealed by the model, we also propose, that Ly49 receptors are more promiscuous than previously thought in their interactions with MHC class I molecules, which was supported by functional studies of NK cell subsets expressing individual Ly49 receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1986552037,"Technologies based on DNA microarrays have the potential to provide detailed information on genomic aberrations in tumor cells. In practice a major obstacle for quantitative detection of aberrations is the heterogeneity of clinical tumor tissue. Since tumor tissue invariably contains genetically normal stromal cells, this may lead to a failure to detect aberrations in the tumor cells.Using SNP array data from 44 non-small cell lung cancer samples we have developed a bioinformatic algorithm that accurately models the fractions of normal and tumor cells in clinical tumor samples. The proportion of normal cells in combination with SNP array data can be used to detect and quantify copy number neutral loss-of-heterozygosity (CNNLOH) in the tumor cells both in crude tumor tissue and in samples enriched for tumor cells by laser capture microdissection.Genome-wide quantitative analysis of CNNLOH using the CNNLOH Quantifier method can help to identify recurrent aberrations contributing to tumor development in clinical tumor samples. In addition, SNP-array based analysis of CNNLOH may become important for detection of aberrations that can be used for diagnostic and prognostic purposes."
https://openalex.org/W2060195097,"The transition metal cadmium is an environmental teratogen. In addition, cadmium and retinoic acid can act synergistically to induce forelimb malformations. The molecular mechanism underlying the teratogenicity of cadmium and the synergistic effect with retinoic acid has not been addressed. An evolutionarily conserved gene, beta,beta-carotene 15,15'-monooxygenase (BCMO), which is involved in retinoic acid biosynthesis, was studied in both Caenorhabditis elegans and murine Hepa 1-6 cells. In C. elegans, bcmo-1 was expressed in the intestine and was cadmium inducible. Similarly, in Hepa 1-6 cells, Bcmo1 was induced by cadmium. Retinoic acid-mediated signaling increased after 24-h exposures to 5 and 10 microm cadmium in Hepa 1-6 cells. Examination of gene expression demonstrated that the induction of retinoic acid signaling by cadmium may be mediated by overexpression of Bcmo1. Furthermore, cadmium inhibited the expression of Cyp26a1 and Cyp26b1, which are involved in retinoic acid degradation. These results indicate that cadmium-induced teratogenicity may be due to the ability of the metal to increase the levels of retinoic acid by disrupting the expression of retinoic acid-metabolizing genes."
https://openalex.org/W2038424641,"Transcription of genes coding for the small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) is dependent upon a unique transcription factor known as the small nuclear RNA-activating protein complex (SNAPc). SNAPc binds to an essential proximal sequence element located about 40-65 base pairs upstream of the snRNA transcription start site. In the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, DmSNAPc contains three distinct polypeptides (DmSNAP190, DmSNAP50, and DmSNAP43) that are stably associated with each other and bind to the DNA as a complex. We have used mutational analysis to identify domains within each subunit that are involved in complex formation with the other two subunits in vivo. We have also identified domains in each subunit required for sequence-specific DNA binding. With one exception, domains required for subunit-subunit interactions lie in the most evolutionarily conserved regions of the proteins. However, DNA binding by DmSNAPc is dependent not only upon the conserved regions but is also highly dependent upon domains outside the conserved regions. Comparison with functional domains identified in human SNAPc indicates many parallels but also reveals significant differences in this ancient yet rapidly evolving system."
https://openalex.org/W1975002920,"Stresses like dietary restriction or various toxins increase lifespan in taxa as diverse as yeast, Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila and rats, by triggering physiological responses that also tend to delay reproduction. Food odors can reverse the effects of dietary restriction, showing that key mechanisms respond to information, not just resources. Such environmental cues can predict population trends, not just individual prospects for survival and reproduction. When population size is increasing, each offspring produced earlier makes a larger proportional contribution to the gene pool, but the reverse is true when population size is declining.We show mathematically that natural selection can favor facultative delay in reproduction when environmental cues predict a decrease in total population size, even if lifetime fecundity decreases with delay. We also show that increased reproduction from waiting for better conditions does not increase fitness (proportional representation) when the whole population benefits similarly.We conclude that the beneficial effects of stress on longevity (hormesis) in diverse taxa are a side-effect of delaying reproduction in response to environmental cues that population size is likely to decrease. The reversal by food odors of the effects of dietary restriction can be explained as a response to information that population size is less likely to decrease, reducing the chance that delaying reproduction will increase fitness."
https://openalex.org/W2033860148,"Background The use of Salmonella to deliver heterologous antigens from DNA vaccines is a well-accepted extension of the success of oral Salmonella vaccines in animal models. Attenuated S. typhimurium and S. typhi strains are safe and efficacious, and their use to deliver DNA vaccines combines the advantages of both vaccine approaches, while complementing the limitations of each technology. An important aspect of the basic biology of the Salmonella/DNA vaccine platform is the relative contributions of prokaryotic and eukaryotic expression in production of the vaccine antigen. Gene expression in DNA vaccines is commonly under the control of the eukaryotic cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter. The aim of this study was to identify and disable putative bacterial promoters within the CMV promoter and evaluate the immunogenicity of the resulting DNA vaccine delivered orally by S. typhimurium. Methodology/Principal Findings The results reported here clearly demonstrate the presence of bacterial promoters within the CMV promoter. These promoters have homology to the bacterial consensus sequence and functional activity. To disable prokaryotic expression from the CMV promoter a series of genetic manipulations were performed to remove the two major bacterial promoters and add a bacteria transcription terminator downstream of the CMV promoter. S. typhimurium was used to immunise BALB/c mice orally with a DNA vaccine encoding the C-fragment of tetanus toxin (TT) under control of the original or the modified CMV promoter. Although both promoters functioned equally well in eukaryotic cells, as indicated by equivalent immune responses following intramuscular delivery, only the original CMV promoter was able to induce an anti-TT specific response following oral delivery by S. typhimurium. Conclusions These findings suggest that prokaryotic expression of the antigen and co-delivery of this protein by Salmonella are at least partially responsible for the successful oral delivery of C-fragment DNA vaccines containing the CMV promoter by S. typhimurium."
https://openalex.org/W2014899787,"Competition between species plays a central role in the activity and structure of communities. Stable co-existence of diverse organisms in communities is thought to be fostered by individual tradeoffs and optimization of competitive strategies along resource gradients. Outside the laboratory, microbes exist as multispecies consortia, continuously interacting with one another and the environment. Survival and proliferation of a particular species is governed by its competitive fitness. Therefore, bacteria must be able to continuously sense their immediate environs for presence of competitors and prevailing conditions. Here we present results of our investigations on a novel competition sensing mechanism in the rhizosphere-inhabiting Pseudomonas putida KT2440, harbouring gfpmut3b-modified KanR TOL plasmid. We monitored benzyl alcohol (BA) degradation rate, along with GFP expression profiling in mono species and dual species cultures. Interestingly, enhanced plasmid expression (monitored using GFP expression) and consequent BA degradation were observed in dual species consortia, irrespective of whether the competitor was a BA degrader (Pseudomonas aeruginosa) or a non-degrader (E. coli). Attempts at elucidation of the mechanistic aspects of induction indicated the role of physical interaction, but not of any diffusible compounds emanating from the competitors. This contention is supported by the observation that greater induction took place in presence of increasing number of competitors. Inert microspheres mimicking competitor cell size and concentration did not elicit any significant induction, further suggesting the role of physical cell-cell interaction. Furthermore, it was also established that cell wall compromised competitor had minimal induction capability. We conclude that P. putida harbouring pWW0 experience a competitive stress when grown as dual-species consortium, irrespective of the counterpart being BA degrader or not. The immediate effect of this stress is a marked increase in expression of TOL, leading to rapid utilization of the available carbon source and massive increase in its population density. The plausible mechanisms behind the phenomenon are hypothesised and practical implications are indicated and discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2095559149,"It is well known that excessive non-esterified fatty acids in diabetes contribute to the pathogenesis of renal complications although the mechanism remains elusive. Enhanced oxidative stress has been hypothesized as a unified factor contributing to diabetic complications and increased protein nitrotyrosylation has been reported in the kidneys of diabetic patients. In the current manuscript we described that linoleic acid (LA) caused mitochondrial Ca(2+) efflux and peroxynitrite production, along with increased nitrotyrosine levels of cellular proteins in primary human mesangial cells. The peroxynitrite production by LA was found to depend on mitochondrial Ca(2+) efflux. Downregulation of hsp90beta1, which has been previously shown to be essential for polyunsaturated fatty acid-induced mitochondrial Ca(2+) efflux, significantly diminished LA-responsive mitochondrial Ca(2+) efflux and the coupled peroxynitrite generation, implicating a critical role of hsp90beta1 in the LA responses. Our results further demonstrated that mitochondrial complexes I and III were directly involved in the LA-induced peroxynitrite generation. Using the well established type 2 diabetic animal model db/db mice, we observed a dramatically enhanced LA responsive mitochondrial Ca(2+) efflux and protein nitrotyrosylation in the kidney. Our study thus demonstrates a cause-effect relationship between LA and peroxynitrite or protein nitrotyrosylation and provides a novel mechanism for lipid-induced nephropathy in diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2092312800,"Recent studies indicate that the balance between cell survival and proapoptotic signals determines which cells commit to life or death. We have shown that the balance between follicle-stimulating hormone and prolactin determines differentiation or apoptosis in 7th generation spermatogonia during newt spermatogenesis; however, the molecular mechanisms specifying their fate are poorly understood. Here we show that the newt RNA-binding protein (nRBP) plays a critical role in determining their fate. nRBP was identified as a clone whose mRNA is decreased by prolactin, resulting in the reduction of the protein, which is otherwise expressed predominantly in the spermatogonia. nRBP protein associated with the mRNA for newt programmed cell death protein 4 (nPdcd4) at the 3′-untranslated region. nRBP reduction increased nPdcd4 mRNA but decreased its protein. In a cell-free system, cytoplasmic extracts containing reduced amounts of nRBP and nPdcd4 protein induced apoptosis, whereas adding nRBP protein to the extracts blocked apoptosis. Furthermore, overexpression of nRBP protected cells from apoptosis, stabilized the chimeric transcript containing the nPdcd4 3′-untranslated region, and accelerated its translation. These data suggest that, in the absence of nRBP, nPdcd4 mRNA is not stabilized and its translation is suppressed, leading to apoptosis in the spermatogonia.

Multicellular organisms maintain tissue homeostasis through response of their cells to extracellular signals that either promote their proliferation and differentiation or induce their death. Evidence is accumulating that extracellular stimuli, such as growth factors and cytokines, operate via complex signal transduction networks that ultimately control cellular fates (1.Janes K.A. Albeck J.G. Gaudet S. Sorger P.K. Lauffenburger D.A. Yaffe M.B. Science. 2005; 310: 1646-1653Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar); however, the complete molecular mechanisms need to be elucidated. One convenient system for studying the molecular mechanisms governing cell survival and death is spermatogenesis. It is mediated not only by cell proliferation and differentiation but also by programmed cell death or apoptosis, culminating in the production of spermatozoa. Apoptosis is necessary for eliminating unwanted cells and adjusting cell numbers in multicellular organisms to ensure tissue homeostasis. In the testis of the Japanese red-bellied newt, Cynops pyrrhogaster, primary spermatogonia proliferate through seven mitotic divisions, and then in the 8th generation the spermatogonia differentiate into primary spermatocytes and initiate meiosis in the spring when the ambient temperature is high; in contrast, in the autumn when the ambient temperature is low, the spermatogonia often undergo apoptosis in the 7th generation, resulting in the cessation of spermatogenesis (2.Abé S.I. Zool. Sci. 2004; 21: 691-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). These findings suggest the existence of molecular mechanisms regulating the fate of 7th generation spermatogonia. We have shown in vitro and in vivo that the cellular fate in the spermatogonia is mainly regulated by changes in the endogenous levels of two peptide hormones secreted from the pituitary gland as follows: follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) 2The abbreviations used are: FSHfollicle-stimulating hormonePRLprolactinnRBPnewt RNA-binding proteinCIRPcold-inducible RNA-binding protein3′UTR3′-untranslated region3′RACE3′-rapid amplification of cDNA endsRNPribonucleoproteinPARPpoly(ADP-ribose) polymeraseRTreverse transcriptionGFPgreen fluorescent proteinWBWestern blottingIPimmunoprecipitationTUNELterminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labelingDAPI4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindoleGSTglutathione S-transferaseHAhemagglutininPMSFphenylmethylsulfonyl fluorideDTTdithiothreitolrnRBPrecombinant newt RBPntnucleotidePIPES1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acidhGAPDHhuman glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenaseFLfull length. that stimulates spermatogonial proliferation and differentiation into primary spermatocytes, and prolactin that induces apoptosis. When the relative concentration ratio of prolactin to FSH is high, the spermatogonia undergo apoptosis, but when the ratio is low, they survive (3.Yazawa T. Yamamoto K. Kikuyama S. Abé S.I. Gen.

Newt spermatogonia are an ideal model for analyzing the mechanisms controlling cellular life or death. The germ cells are in close contact with somatic Sertoli cells in a spermatogenic cyst, the smallest unit of the testis. The testis consists of lobules in successive zones arranged along a cephalocaudal axis, in which spermatogenesis proceeds synchronously (2.Abé S.I. Zool. Sci. 2004; 21: 691-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 6.Callard G.V. Pang P.K.T. Schreibman M.T. Vertebrate Endocrinology: Fundamentals and Biomedical Implications. Academic Press, New York1991: 303-341Google Scholar). Therefore, we can dissect zones containing particular spermatogenic stages and identify the generation of spermatogonia by counting their numbers in a cyst. Such a simple structure of the testis allows us to isolate and characterize the molecules influencing the fate of spermatogonia. This study demonstrated the following: 1) a putative glycine-rich RNA-binding protein (nRBP) disappears in the cytoplasm of 7th generation spermatogonia after prolactin exposure; 2) this loss is implicated in the induction of apoptosis and in the suppression of translation for the newt orthologue of programmed cell death protein 4 (nPdcd4) mRNA, the 3′-untranslated region (UTR) that interacts with nRBP protein; and 3) overexpression of nRBP protects intact cells from apoptosis and accelerates the translation of the chimeric green fluorescent protein (GFP)-nPdcd4 3′UTR mRNA by increasing its stability. These results suggest that the RNA-binding protein functions as an antiapoptotic factor by stabilizing nPdcd4 mRNA and promoting its translation, thereby determining spermatogonial survival. The antigen peptide (FVSEGDGGRLKPESY) for an antibody to human Pdcd4 (Rockland) and the PCR primers were produced in TORAY Research Center Co., Ltd., and Hokkaido System Science Co., Ltd., Japan, respectively. Adult male newts and adult female mice were purchased from Hamamatsu Seibutsu Kyozai Ltd. and Kyudo Co., Ltd., Japan, respectively. All other chemicals were from standard commercial sources, unless otherwise stated. Newts were kept at 7 °C in the dark and then transferred to 22 °C and fed frozen Tubifex. Their testes containing late spermatogonial and early spermatocyte stages were used. Induction of apoptosis in 7th generation spermatogonia was performed by injecting into each newt 25 IU prolactin (Sigma) or the vehicle (saline) as the control. After 48 h, their testes were removed (3.Yazawa T. Yamamoto K. Kikuyama S. Abé S.I. Gen. Comp. Endocrinol. 1999; 113: 302-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 4.Yazawa T. Yamamoto T. Abé S.I. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 2027-2032Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Except for changes in the expression of mRNA and protein for nRBP and nPdcd4, newts were exposed for various periods from 6 to 48 h after prolactin injection. In some experiments, FSH (0.1 IU; Sigma) was injected into each newt (5.Yazawa T. Yamamoto T. Jin Y. Abé S.I. Biol. Reprod. 2002; 66: 14-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and then analyzed at 12, 24, and 48 h. Total RNA was extracted from the testes by homogenization in ISOGEN (Nippon Gene) and treated with RNase-free DNase I (Takara). Then cDNA was synthesized using oligo(dT) primers and random hexamers with a reverse transcriptase Superscript III (Invitrogen) according to the respective manufacturer's instructions (7.Eto K. Eda K. Kanemoto S. Abe S.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 350: 263-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). For microarray analyses, we made microarrays carrying 5321 independent cDNA clones and hybridized them with Cy3- or Cy5-labeled cDNA probes prepared from total RNA (CyScribe First Strand cDNA labeling kit; GE Healthcare), which had been extracted from the testes of newts that were injected with prolactin or the vehicle. Fluorescent signals were quantified by ScanArray 4000 (GE Healthcare), and the data were analyzed using QuantArray software (GE Healthcare). The full-length clone encoding the open reading frame of nRBP and the partial clone encoding that of nPdcd4 were isolated from the cDNA library used in microarray analyses, and their nucleotide sequences were determined using an Applied Biosystems model 310 automated DNA sequencer. For RT-PCR analyses, 5 μg of total RNA or all of the coimmunoprecipitated RNA was treated with DNase I and reverse-transcribed using random hexamers, as described previously (7.Eto K. Eda K. Kanemoto S. Abe S.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 350: 263-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). 10% of the respective reverse transcription reaction was subjected to PCR as the template with Ex Taq polymerase (Takara). The PCR conditions were as follows: for 30 cycles at 95 °C for 30 s, at 55 °C for 30 s, and at 72 °C for 30 s for nRBP, GFP, and human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (hGAPDH); for 28, 42, or 45 cycles at 95 °C for 30 s, at 55 or 57 °C for 30 s, and at 72 °C for 40 s for nPdcd4; and for 25 cycles at 95 °C for 30 s, at 55 °C for 30 s, and at 72 °C for 30 s for newt elongation factor-1α (nEF-1α). The forward and reverse primers used were as follows: 5′-gat ggt aaa ctc ttc gtg gg-3′ and 5′-gct gtc gta gct gtc tct gta g-3′ for nRBP; 5′-atg ata gtg aag ctg ctg aa-3′ and 5′-aca gaa gct ttc tca aga tg-3′ for nPdcd4; 5′-agc cct aga ctc aat cat cc-3′ and 5′-atc caa cac agg agc gta tc-3′ for nEF-1α; 5′-atg gtg agc aag ggc gag gag ctg-3′ and 5′-tta ctt gta cag ctc gtc cat gcc-3′ for GFP; and 5′-gtc agt ggt gga cct gac ct-3′ and 5′-tga gct tga caa agt ggt cg-3′ for hGAPDH. Each of the amplified DNA fragments (nRBP, 400 bp; nPdcd4, 386 bp; nEF-1α, 550 bp; hGAPDH, 212 bp; and GFP, 719 bp) was analyzed by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis and cloned into pT7Blue vector (Merck). The nucleotide sequence was verified. The RT-PCR reaction mixture without reverse transcriptase was used as the negative control. To express in mammalian cells nRBP protein tagged in the carboxyl terminus with hemagglutinin (HA), the coding region of nRBP cDNA was amplified by PCR for 30 cycles at 95 °C for 30 s, at 55 °C for 30 s, and at 72 °C for 45 s using primers 5′-gtg aat tca tgt cgt ctg atg atg gt-3′ and 5′-cag cgg ccg ctc agg cat agt cag gga cgt cat aag gat agc tgt cgt agc tgt ctc t-3′. The PCR product was digested with EcoRI and NotI and ligated into a mammalian expression vector pME18s (DNAX Institute) (pME18s-nRBP). For construction of the plasmid expressing recombinant nRBP protein (rnRBP) fused at the amino terminus to GST and at the carboxyl terminus to HA (GST-nRBP), the cDNA portion encoding amino acid residues 2–159 was amplified by PCR for 30 cycles at 95 °C for 30 s, at 55 °C for 30 s, and at 72 °C for 45 s using primers 5′-gtg aat ctc gtc tga tga tgg taa ac-3′ and 5′-cag cgg ccg ctc agg cat agt cag gga cgt cat aag gat agc tgt cgt agc tgt ctc t-3′. The PCR products were digested with EcoRI and NotI and ligated into pGEX4T-1 (GE Healthcare), a bacterial expression vector for GST fusion protein. Bacterial cells (Escherichia coli, DH5α strain) were transformed with the expression plasmid for GST-nRBP or GST protein. These proteins were separately expressed in the bacterial cells grown to 0.6 of A600 nm by addition of 0.1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, cultured for a further 3 h, and purified by glutathione-Sepharose (0.5 ml; GE Healthcare) column chromatography according to the manufacturer's instructions. The recombinant proteins, eluted with a buffer containing 10 mm glutathione, 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, and 0.2 mm PMSF, were dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline. To raise a polyclonal antibody against nRBP, GST-nRBP (∼0.2 mg) was injected into each mouse (C57BL/6 strain). The mice received four booster injections at 5-day intervals. The blood was harvested and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C and then overnight at 4 °C. After centrifugation at 1000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was applied to a glutathione-Sepharose column bound with GST protein to remove its antibodies. The flow-through fraction was used as an anti-nRBP antiserum for Western blotting, immunohistochemistry, and immunoprecipitation. Normal mouse serum was prepared by the same method. For construction of chimeric genes connecting the full-length and mutant 3′UTR of nPdcd4 mRNA with the GFP coding region at the carboxyl terminus, the 3′UTR was cloned by 3′RACE (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, 5 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed at 42 °C for 50 min using oligo(dT)-containing adapter primer, which was provided by the manufacturer. The 3′UTR cDNA was cloned by sequential PCR with Ex Taq polymerase using the abridged universal amplification primer, which was provided by the manufacturer, and three distinct gene-specific primers, which we designed on the basis of the nucleotide sequence of the putative nPdcd4 open reading frame as follows: 5′-aag ttc tcc atg atg ttg tg-3′ for 35 cycles at 94 °C for 1 min, at 55 °C for 1 min, and at 72 °C for 2 min; and 5′-aca tcc aga ttg atg tcg gg-3′ and 5′-tgg aag ccc cgg ttc atc tg-3′for 35 cycles at 94 °C for 0.5 min, at 55 °C for 0.5 min, and at 72 °C for 1 min, ligated into pT7 blue vector, and thoroughly sequenced. The cDNA portions encoding the full-length 3′UTR (nucleotide (nt) 1–1527, FL) and its 3′-terminal truncated mutants (nt 1–1208, nt 1–814, and nt 1–380), shown schematically in Fig. 6A, were amplified with the original 3′UTR as the template by PCR for 35 cycles at 94 °C for 0.5 min, at 55 °C for 0.5 min, and at 72 °C for 1 min to introduce restriction sites EcoRI and SalI. The forward primer used was 5′-ccg aat tct aac ccg aat ctc gaa cac ac-3′ and the reverse primer: 5′-tgg att gcc acg gtc gac tag tac-3′ for the full-length region; 5′-aag tcg acg caa tcg aga cca gtt ata ac-3′ for nt 1–1208; 5′-aag tcg acc agt gag acc tgc tag gtt ac-3′ for nt 1–814; or 5′-aag tcg aca ctg agc cat tcg tat caa ca-3′ for nt 1–380. Each of the products was subcloned into pEGFP-C2 (Takara), a mammalian expression vector for GFP fusion protein, 3′-terminally after the stop codon following the GFP coding region to generate chimeric gene constructs pEGFP-nPdcd4-3′UTR-FL, -1208, -814, and -380 for expressing the respective GFP/nPdcd4–3′UTR mRNA. Human cervical carcinoma (HeLa) cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C under an atmosphere of 5% CO2. Cells were plated at ∼40% confluency onto 30-mm-diameter dishes, and 1 day later cells were transfected with 1 μg of the expression construct pME18s-nRBP or the empty vector (mock) using 6 μg of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The cells were treated for 2.5 h with 1 μm staurosporine or the vehicle (0.05% DMSO) 40 h after transfection. Nuclei were visualized using a fluorescent microscope (BX60; Olympus) by DAPI staining and TUNEL assay. The latter was performed with an in situ apoptosis detection kit (Takara) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For quantification of apoptotic cells, a minimum of 100 cells, each from at least three microscopic fields, was examined for TUNEL-positive nuclei among DAPI-positive ones. The frequency of apoptosis was expressed as a percentage (means ± S.E.) of apoptotic cells obtained from three independent experiments. To test the binding of nRBP protein with the 3′UTR of nPdcd4 mRNA and analyze its effect on the stability and translation of mRNA for the chimeric genes, HeLa cells grown on 30-mm dishes to 60% confluency were transiently transfected with a combination of pME18s-nRBP (1 μg) and either pEGFP-nPdcd4-3′UTR-FL, -1208, -814, -380, or pEGFP-C2 (1 μg, each) using 5 μl of FuGENE (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were harvested 3, 6, 9, and 12 h after transfection, and subjected to immunoprecipitation, RT-PCR, and Western blotting. For inhibition of transcription, 12 h after transfection the cells were treated with actinomycin D (5 μg/ml; Merck) for 1, 2, 4, and 8 h. Testes were fixed in Bouin's fixative, embedded in paraffin wax, and sectioned at 5 μm. Sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin to examine the apoptotic cells and the spermatogenic stages. For immunohistochemistry of nRBP, testes were fixed in carnoy fixative (ethanol:chloroform:acetic acid = 6:3:1) at room temperature for 1 h, embedded in paraffin wax, and sectioned at 5 μm. Sections were immunostained with a mouse anti-nRBP antiserum (1:100), and developed with the activity of alkaline phosphatase conjugated with a secondary antibody. Testes were homogenized in cell extract buffer (CEB: 50 mm PIPES, pH 7.4, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm PMSF, protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)) and lysis buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.2 mm PMSF, protease inhibitor mixture) at 5-fold volume to weight. HeLa cells were lysed in SDS-PAGE sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris/HCl, pH 6.8, 25% glycerol, 2% SDS, 0.01% bromphenol blue, 5% β-mercaptoethanol) at 150 μl to ∼2 × 105 cells. The extracts (testes, 20 μg of protein; HeLa cells, 10% (v/v) of the total) were subjected to SDS-15% PAGE and Western blotting with antibodies against nRBP (1:200 or 500), Pdcd4 (1:1000), HA tag (1:250 or 500; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), PARP (1:1000; Enzo Life Sciences), GFP (1:1000; BD Biosciences), and β-actin (1:2000; Millipore). Cytoplasmic extracts were prepared from the testes of newts injected with prolactin or the vehicle by the method of Martin et al. (8.Martin S.J. Newmeyer D.D. Mathias S. Farschon D.M. Wang H.G. Reed J.C. Kolesnick R.N. Green D.R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5191-5200Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Testes were homogenized in an equal volume of CEB to weight that contained RNase inhibitor (Promega). After centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was collected as the cytoplasmic extracts. Protein concentrations were determined and adjusted to 10 mg/ml with extraction buffer containing the ATP-regenerating system (EDB: 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 2 mm ATP, 10 mm phosphocreatine, 50 μg/ml creatine kinase, 1 mm PMSF, protease inhibitor mixture, RNase inhibitor). Dissociated cells from testes were prepared as described (9.Saribek B. Jin Y. Saigo M. Eto K. Abe S.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 349: 1190-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Healthy nuclei were isolated from the dissociated germ cells by solubilization for 5 min on ice with 40 ng/ml digitonin in nuclear isolation buffer (NB: 10 mm PIPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2,1 mm DTT, 1 mm PMSF, protease inhibitor mixture, RNase inhibitor). Nuclei were precipitated by centrifugation at 200 × g for 5 min at 4 °C and washed with NB. The nuclear number was determined and adjusted to 105/μl with NB. For cell-free reactions, 10 μl of cytoplasmic extracts (100 μg) were mixed with 1 μl of germ cell nuclei (105) and 2 μl of EDB containing RNase inhibitor, and then incubated for 9 h at 22 °C. To investigate the effect of nRBP protein on prolactin-dependent cell-free apoptosis, cytoplasmic extracts were preincubated for 4 h at 22 °C with 1 μl of GST-nRBP or GST as the control (2 μg, each) and then mixed with nuclei. The optimal temperature and times for incubation of cytoplasmic extracts and nuclei and for that of cytoplasmic extracts and recombinant proteins were determined by examining the effects of varying temperatures and times on the frequency of apoptosis in nuclei. Nuclei were visualized with a fluorescent microscope after DAPI staining and TUNEL assay. For quantification of apoptotic nuclei, a minimum of 100 nuclei, each from at least three microscopic fields, was examined for TUNEL-positive nuclei among DAPI-positive ones. The frequency of apoptosis was expressed as a percentage (means ± S.E.) of the apoptotic nuclei obtained from three independent experiments. For coimmunoprecipitation of endogenous nPdcd4 mRNA with endogenous nRBP protein, testes were dissected from normal newts and homogenized in CEB containing RNase inhibitor but lacking DTT. Cytoplasmic extracts (1 mg of protein) were separated by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C and precleared for 12 h at 4 °C on protein G-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) with constant rotation. After centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 1 min at 4 °C, the supernatants were collected and divided into two tubes (0.5 mg of protein each). They were then incubated with the new beads and 10 μl of either anti-nRBP antiserum or normal mouse serum as the control for 6 h at 4 °C under constant rotation. For immunodepletion of endogenous nRBP protein, GST-nRBP (100 μg) was preincubated for 12 h on ice with 10 μl of anti-nRBP antiserum, and the immunocomplexes were used for immunoprecipitation. Beads were washed three times with CEB containing RNase inhibitor and lacking DTT and three times with RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 m NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm PMSF, protease inhibitor mixture, RNase inhibitor) and then resuspended in 300 μl of RIPA buffer. Coimmunoprecipitated RNA was extracted from ⅔ of the beads with ISOGEN by the standard procedure and subjected to RT-PCR using primers of some genes involved in apoptosis, including nPdcd4 as described. The remaining beads were eluted in SDS-PAGE sample buffer for Western blotting with the anti-nRBP antiserum. For coimmunoprecipitation of endogenous nPdcd4 mRNA with exogenous nRBP protein, either GST-nRBP or GST protein (5 μg, each) was incubated for 4 h at 22 °C with cytoplasmic extracts (0.25 mg of protein) prepared from normal testes, and subjected to immunoprecipitation with either an antibody to HA tag of the recombinant protein (1 μg) or normal rabbit IgGs (1 μg) followed by RT-PCR using nPdcd4 primers and Western blotting with the anti-HA antibody. Coimmunoprecipitation of the chimeric gene mRNA with nRBP protein was performed essentially as described above with an antibody to HA tag of the recombinant protein (2 μg) using cytoplasmic extracts (0.5 mg of protein) prepared by CEB containing RNase inhibitor and 0.1% Nonidet P-40 and lacking DTT from the transfectants with a combination of pME18s-nRBP and either pEGFP-nPdcd4–3′UTR-FL, -1208, -814, -380, or the GFP vector. Before immunoprecipitations, total RNA extracted from the cells 12 h after transfection was reverse-transcribed, and PCR was performed for 35 cycles at 95 °C for 30 s, at 55 °C for 30 s, and at 72 °C for 2 min for the chimeric gene mRNA, GFP/nPdcd4–3′UTR-FL (2.2 kbp), -1208 (1.9 kbp), -814 (1.5 kbp), and -380 (1.1 kbp), with the GFP forward primer and each reverse primer of the nPdcd4 full-length and mutant 3′UTR. Two-thirds of the immunoprecipitates were subjected to RT-PCR for the chimeric gene transcripts and the remaining to Western blotting for nRBP with the anti-HA antibody. For immunodepletion of an antibody to human Pdcd4, the antibody solution diluted at 4000-fold (134 μg of protein) was mixed with the antigen peptide (500 μg) dissolved in water. After incubating overnight at 4 °C with rotation, the mixture was used for Western blotting of the extracts prepared from the testes and HeLa cells as a positive control. Data were obtained as the means ± S.E. For statistical comparison, Student's t test was used. p values less than 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. Protein concentrations were estimated by Coomassie dye binding (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. For some experiments, signals detected in the Western blotting and RT-PCR were quantified by densitometry using ImageJ software. When apoptosis was induced following injection of prolactin into newts, DNA fragmentation, cellular shrinkage, and chromatin condensation were observed at 48 h in 7th generation spermatogonia by TUNEL assay and hematoxylin/eosin staining (3.Yazawa T. Yamamoto K. Kikuyama S. Abé S.I. Gen. Comp. Endocrinol. 1999; 113: 302-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 4.Yazawa T. Yamamoto T. Abé S.I. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 2027-2032Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). To screen for genes in the spermatogonia whose expressions might be altered after prolactin treatment, we performed cDNA microarray analyses. Microarrays carrying 5321 independent clones isolated from testes were prepared and hybridized with cDNA synthesized using total RNA extracted from the testes 48 h after newts were injected with prolactin or the vehicle. Expressions of many genes changed in response to prolactin. Among the genes screened, several were down-regulated, and we investigated one clone. Decreased expression of the clone was confirmed by RT-PCR analysis (Fig. 1A, left panels). But after FSH injection the mRNA expression remained almost unchanged compared with the control (Fig. 1A, right panels). Nucleotide sequencing revealed that the clone contained an ∼1.5-kbp cDNA with an open reading frame (477 bp) potentially encoding 159 amino acid residues. The deduced amino acid sequence indicated that the amino-terminal region contained two consensus RNA-binding motifs (ribonucleoprotein (RNP)-1 and RNP-2); the carboxyl-terminal region contained a glycine-rich domain that includes an RG4 domain consisting of four tandems of the arginine-glycine-glycine (RGG) motif. There was 47–76% identity with members of the glycine-rich RNA-binding protein family isolated so far as follows: mammalian RBM3 (RNA-binding motif protein 3) (10.Derry J.M. Kerns J.A. Francke U.

Our clone showed the highest homology to Xenopus CIRP1 and CIRP2, and we named it newt RNA-binding protein (nRBP). As microarray and RT-PCR analyses demonstrated a significant reduction of nRBP mRNA following prolactin treatment (Fig. 1A), we next examined the expression of its protein. Testes were collected at 6, 12, 24, and 48 h following injection of prolactin into newts, and extracts were prepared for Western blot analyses. An antibody that we raised against the whole recombinant protein of nRBP recognized a 19-kDa protein, which had almost the same mobility on SDS-PAGE as the HA-tagged protein (20 kDa) overexpressed in HeLa cells transfected with an expression construct of the isolated cDNA (Fig. 2A, t"
https://openalex.org/W1989443049,"With new draft guidelines to govern federal funding of human stem cell research, including human embryonic stem cell (hESC) research, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) have again taken on one of the most contentious endeavors of the day ( 1 ). There are positive aspects of the guidelines ( 2 ), but concern is growing that prior approvals of many widely used cell lines may not be in accord with specific wording requirements in the draft guidelines; such cell lines would need to be “grandfathered in” if research is to continue unimpeded ( 3 ). There are also several surprising omissions, surprising because they come in areas that are thoroughly addressed in the guidelines of the U.S. National Academies of Sciences (NAS) ( 4 – 6 ), which have become the gold standard for the conduct of stem cell research in the United States. Further, there has been little comment on the kind of initiative that would support future policy development."
https://openalex.org/W1984401882,"To make Croatian science and education the most competitive in Eastern Europe by 2010, the Croatian Ministry of Science, Education, and Sports (the Ministry) has undertaken major reforms in the past 4 years (1) to develop information technology (IT) as the essential infrastructure for a knowledge-based society (2). Since 1993, IT projects have improved the quality of learning and teaching (2–4) and have created equal learning opportunities for all students (3). As a result, primary and secondary school students can access educational content from their homes or dormitories. The infrastructure for implementing new technologies in the education system has been developed and maintained by the Croatian Academic and Research Network—CARNet (www.carnet.hr). CARNet connects all universities and research institutions in Croatia with access speed ranging from 2 Mbp/s to 10 Gbp/s. It also connects to academic institutions in Bosnia and Herzegovina through cooperation with BIHARNET, the Academic and Research Network of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and throughout Europe via GÉANT, the pan-European data communication network (4). CARNet is free for all authorized users and provides each with a unique, electronic identifier."
