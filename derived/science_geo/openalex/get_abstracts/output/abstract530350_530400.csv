https://openalex.org/W1905038928,"Water-driven fracture propagation beneath supraglacial lakes rapidly transports large volumes of surface meltwater to the base of the Greenland Ice Sheet. These drainage events drive transient ice-sheet acceleration and establish conduits for additional surface-to-bed meltwater transport for the remainder of the melt season. Although it is well established that cracks must remain water-filled to propagate to the bed, the precise mechanisms that initiate hydro-fracture events beneath lakes are unknown. Here we show that, for a lake on the western Greenland Ice Sheet, drainage events are preceded by a 6-12 hour period of ice-sheet uplift and/or enhanced basal slip. Our observations from a dense Global Positioning System (GPS) network allow us to determine the distribution of meltwater at the ice-sheet bed before, during, and after three rapid drainages in 2011-2013, each of which generates tensile stresses that promote hydro-fracture beneath the lake. We hypothesize that these precursors are associated with the introduction of meltwater to the bed through neighbouring moulin systems (vertical conduits connecting the surface and base of the ice sheet). Our results imply that as lakes form in less crevassed, interior regions of the ice sheet, where water at the bed is currently less pervasive, the creation of new surface-to-bed conduits caused by lake-draining hydro-fractures may be limited."

https://openalex.org/W1484617378,"1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3) plays an integral role in calcium homeostasis in higher organisms through its actions in the intestine, kidney, and skeleton. Interestingly, although several intestinal genes are known to play a contributory role in calcium homeostasis, the entire caste of key components remains to be identified. To examine this issue, Cyp27b1 null mice on either a normal or a high calcium/phosphate-containing rescue diet were treated with vehicle or 1,25(OH)2D3 and evaluated 6 h later. RNA samples from the duodena were then subjected to RNA sequence analysis, and the data were analyzed bioinformatically. 1,25(OH)2D3 altered expression of large collections of genes in animals under either dietary condition. 45 genes were found common to both 1,25(OH)2D3-treated groups and were composed of genes previously linked to intestinal calcium uptake, including S100g, Trpv6, Atp2b1, and Cldn2 as well as others. An additional distinct network of 56 genes was regulated exclusively by diet. We then conducted a ChIP sequence analysis of binding sites for the vitamin D receptor (VDR) across the proximal intestine in vitamin D-sufficient normal mice treated with vehicle or 1,25(OH)2D3. The residual VDR cistrome was composed of 4617 sites, which was increased almost 4-fold following hormone treatment. Interestingly, the majority of the genes regulated by 1,25(OH)2D3 in each diet group as well as those found in common in both groups contained frequent VDR sites that likely regulated their expression. This study revealed a global network of genes in the intestine that both represent direct targets of vitamin D action in mice and are involved in calcium absorption."

This study evaluated the effects of pesticides exposure on hematological and neurological indicators over 3 years and 10 days respectively. A cohort of 246 farmers was randomly selected from 3 provinces (Guangdong, Jiangxi, and Hebei) in China. Two rounds of health investigations, including blood tests and neurological examinations, were conducted by medical doctors before and after the crop season in 2012. The data on pesticide use in 2009-2011 were collected retrospectively via face-to-face interviews and the 2012 data were collected from personal records maintained by participants prospectively. Ordinary least square (OLS), Probit, and fixed effect models were used to evaluate the relationship between pesticides exposure frequency and the health indicators. Long-term pesticide exposure was found to be associated with increased abnormality of nerve conductions, especially in sensory nerves. It also affected a wide spectrum of health indicators based on blood tests and decreased the tibial nerve compound muscle action potential amplitudes. Short-term health effects included alterations in complete blood count, hepatic and renal functions, and nerve conduction velocities and amplitudes. However, these effects could not be detected after 3 days following pesticide exposure. Overall, our results demonstrate that pesticide exposure adversely affects blood cells, the liver, and the peripheral nervous system. Future studies are needed to elucidate the specific effects of each pesticide and the mechanisms of these effects."
https://openalex.org/W2099673974,"Background & Aim MicroRNAs (miRs) regulate hepatic steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis. Fibrosis is the consequence of chronic tissue damage and inflammation. We hypothesized that deficiency of miR-155, a master regulator of inflammation, attenuates steatohepatitis and fibrosis. Methods Wild type (WT) and miR-155-deficient (KO) mice were fed methionine-choline-deficient (MCD) or -supplemented (MCS) control diet for 5 weeks. Liver injury, inflammation, steatosis and fibrosis were assessed. Results MCD diet resulted in steatohepatitis and increased miR-155 expression in total liver, hepatocytes and Kupffer cells. Steatosis and expression of genes involved in fatty acid metabolism were attenuated in miR-155 KO mice after MCD feeding. In contrast, miR-155 deficiency failed to attenuate inflammatory cell infiltration, nuclear factor κ beta (NF-κB) activation and enhanced the expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP1) in MCD diet-fed mice. We found a significant attenuation of apoptosis (cleaved caspase-3) and reduction in collagen and α smooth muscle actin (αSMA) levels in miR-155 KO mice compared to WTs on MCD diet. In addition, we found attenuation of platelet derived growth factor (PDGF), a pro-fibrotic cytokine; SMAD family member 3 (Smad3), a protein involved in transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) signal transduction and vimentin, a mesenchymal marker and indirect indicator of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in miR-155 KO mice. Nuclear binding of CCAAT enhancer binding protein β (C/EBPβ) a miR-155 target involved in EMT was significantly increased in miR-155 KO compared to WT mice. Conclusions Our novel data demonstrate that miR-155 deficiency can reduce steatosis and fibrosis without decreasing inflammation in steatohepatitis."
https://openalex.org/W633042482,"Intramuscular fat (IMF) content is related to insulin resistance, which is an important prediction factor for disorders, such as cardiovascular disease, obesity and type 2 diabetes in human. At the same time, it is an economically important trait, which influences the sensorial and nutritional value of meat. The deposition of IMF is influenced by many factors such as sex, age, nutrition, and genetics. In this study Nellore steers (Bos taurus indicus subspecies) were used to better understand the molecular mechanisms involved in IMF content. This was accomplished by identifying differentially expressed genes (DEG), biological pathways and putative regulatory factors. Animals included in this study had extreme genomic estimated breeding value (GEBV) for IMF. RNA-seq analysis, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and co-expression network methods, such as partial correlation coefficient with information theory (PCIT), regulatory impact factor (RIF) and phenotypic impact factor (PIF) were utilized to better understand intramuscular adipogenesis. A total of 16,101 genes were analyzed in both groups (high (H) and low (L) GEBV) and 77 DEG (FDR 10%) were identified between the two groups. Pathway Studio software identified 13 significantly over-represented pathways, functional classes and small molecule signaling pathways within the DEG list. PCIT analyses identified genes with a difference in the number of gene-gene correlations between H and L group and detected putative regulatory factors involved in IMF content. Candidate genes identified by PCIT include: ANKRD26, HOXC5 and PPAPDC2. RIF and PIF analyses identified several candidate genes: GLI2 and IGF2 (RIF1), MPC1 and UBL5 (RIF2) and a host of small RNAs, including miR-1281 (PIF). These findings contribute to a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms that underlie fat content and energy balance in muscle and provide important information for the production of healthier beef for human consumption."
https://openalex.org/W571529032,"The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship of phthalates exposure with thyroid function in pregnant women and their newborns.One hundred and forty-eight Taiwanese maternal and infant pairs were recruited from E-Da hospital in southern Taiwan between 2009 and 2010 for analysis. One-spot urine samples and blood samples in the third trimester of pregnant women and their cord blood samples at delivery were collected. Nine phthalate metabolites in urine were determined by triple quadrupole liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, whereas serum from pregnant women and their cord blood were used to measure thyroid profiles (thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH], thyroxine, free thyroxine, and triiodothyronine) by radioimmunoassay.Median levels of urinary mono-n-butyl phthalate, mono-ethyl phthalate, and mono-(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phthalate (μg/g creatinine) were the three highest phthalate metabolites, which were 37.81, 34.51, and 21.73, respectively. Using Bonferroni correction at a significance of < 0.006, we found that urinary mono-benzyl phthalate (MBzP) levels were significantly and negatively associated with serum TSH in cord blood (β = -2.644, p = 0.003).Maternal urinary MBzP, of which the parental compound is butylbenzyl phthalate, may affect TSH activity in newborns. The alteration of thyroid homeostasis by certain phthalates in the early life, a critical period for neurodevelopment, is an urgent concern."
https://openalex.org/W1521574455,"Valve interstitial cells (VICs) are fibroblastic in nature however in culture it is widely accepted that they differentiate into a myofibroblastic phenotype. This study assessed a fibroblast culture media formulation for its ability to maintain the phenotype and function of VICs as in the intact healthy valve. Normal human VICs were cultured separately in standard DMEM and in fibroblast media consisting of FGF2 (10 ng/ml), insulin (50 ng/ml) and 2% FCS for at least a week. Cell morphology, aspect ratio, size, levels and distribution of protein expression, proliferation, cell cycle, contraction and migration were assessed. Some VICs and some valve endothelial cells expressed FGF2 in valve tissue and this expression was increased in calcified valves. VICs in DMEM exhibited large, spread cells whereas VICs in fibroblast media were smaller, elongated and spindly. Aspect ratio and size were both significantly higher in DMEM (p<0.01). The level of expression of α-SMA was significantly reduced in fibroblast media at day 2 after isolation (p<0.01) and the expression of α-SMA, SM22 and EDA-fibronectin was significantly reduced in fibroblast media at days 7 and 12 post-isolation (p<0.01). Expression of cytoskeletal proteins, bone marker proteins and extracellular matrix proteins was reduced in fibroblast media. Proliferation of VICs in fibroblast media was significantly reduced at weeks 1 (p<0.05) and 2 (p<0.01). Collagen gel contraction was significantly reduced in fibroblast media (p<0.05). VICs were found to have significantly fewer and smaller focal adhesions in fibroblast media (p<0.01) with significantly fewer supermature focal adhesions in fibroblast media (p<0.001). Ultrastructurally, VICs in fibroblast media resembled native VICs from intact valves. VICs in fibroblast media demonstrated a slower migratory ability after wounding at 72 hours (p<0.01). Treatment of human VICs with this fibroblast media formulation has the ability to maintain and to dedifferentiate the VICs back to a fibroblastic phenotype with phenotypic and functional characteristics ascribed to cells in the intact valve. This methodology is fundamental in the study of normal valve biology, pathology and in the field of tissue engineering."
https://openalex.org/W1877039014,"Aberrant Zn2+ homeostasis is a hallmark of certain cardiomyopathies associated with altered contractile force. In this study, we addressed whether Zn2+ modulates cardiac ryanodine receptor gating and Ca2+ dynamics in isolated cardiomyocytes. We reveal that Zn2+ is a high affinity regulator of RyR2 displaying three modes of operation. Picomolar free Zn2+ concentrations potentiate RyR2 responses, but channel activation is still dependent on the presence of cytosolic Ca2+. At concentrations of free Zn2+ >1 nm, Zn2+ is the main activating ligand, and the dependence on Ca2+ is removed. Zn2+ is therefore a higher affinity activator of RyR2 than Ca2+. Millimolar levels of free Zn2+ were found to inhibit channel openings. In cardiomyocytes, consistent with our single channel results, we show that Zn2+ modulates both the frequency and amplitude of Ca2+ waves in a concentration-dependent manner and that physiological levels of Zn2+ elicit Ca2+ release in the absence of activating levels of cytosolic Ca2+.

Significance: This highlights a new role for Zn2+ in cardiac excitation-contraction coupling. In cardiac muscle, the intracellular signal that triggers muscle contraction is thought to be a transient rise in intracellular Ca2+ that leads to the opening of Ca2+ release channels called type 2 ryanodine receptors (RyR2) 2The abbreviations used are: RyR2type 2 ryanodine receptorSRsarcoplasmic reticulumBAPTA2,2′-(ethylenedioxy)dianiline-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acidTPENN,N,N′,N′-tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl)ethylenediamineZnPyzinc pyrithioneANOVAanalysis of variance. on the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). The resulting release of Ca2+ into the cytosol causes movement of contractile myofibrils leading to cell contraction. Damaging changes in Ca2+ homeostasis are associated with heart failure, conduction abnormalities, and contractile dysfunction.

Recently, there has been much interest in the role of Zn2+ as an intracellular signaling molecule (4Maret W. Crosstalk of the group IIa and IIb metals calcium and zinc in cellular signaling.Proc.

Like Ca2+, intracellular Zn2+ is heavily buffered (7Colvin R.A. Holmes W.R. Fontaine C.P. Maret W. Cytosolic zinc buffering and muffling: their role in intracellular zinc homeostasis.Metallomics. 2010; 2: 306-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar), and cellular Zn2+ homeostasis requires mechanisms that tightly control the uptake, storage, and distribution of Zn2+. This is achieved through the coordinated actions of metallothionein proteins and Zn2+ transporters (8Krezel A. Maret W. Zinc-buffering capacity of a eukaryotic cell at physiological pZn.J. Biol.

During cardiac excitation-contraction coupling, intracellular Zn2+ concentrations are altered, and spatiotemporal fluctuations in free Zn2+ levels, including both Zn2+ transients and Zn2+ sparks, are suggested to be remarkably similar to those previously shown for Ca2+ (13Tuncay E.

Other groups suggest that Zn2+ can permeate through the L-type channel with a greater affinity than Ca2+ but with a much lower permeability leading to a reduction in the inward current (14Alvarez-Collazo J.

The potential role of Zn2+ in shaping intracellular Ca2+ release and regulating intracellular Ca2+ dynamics in heart however, is poorly characterized. Here we show that Zn2+ is a potent regulator of SR Ca2+ release through modulation of RyR2 channel function and that Zn2+ plays a key role in shaping intracellular Ca2+ dynamics important in cardiac excitation-contraction coupling. Chemicals were AnalaR or the best equivalent grade from BDH Chemicals (Poole, UK) or Sigma-Aldrich. All solutions were made in deionized water, and those for use in bilayer experiments were filtered through a Millipore membrane filter (0.45-μm pore). 2,2′-(Ethylenedioxy)dianiline-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA) (Dorset, UK) and N,N,N′,N′-tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl)ethylenediamine (TPEN) were from Sigma-Aldrich. Sheep hearts were obtained from a local abattoir, and heavy SR membrane vesicles were prepared and fused with planar phosphatidylethanolamine lipid bilayers, as described previously (20Sitsapesan R. Montgomery R.A. MacLeod K.T. Williams A.J. Sheep cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium release channels: modification of conductance and gating by temperature.J. Physiol. 1991; 434: 469-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Briefly, heavy SR vesicles were prepared as follows. Homogenized ventricular cardiac tissue from sheep was subjected to centrifugation at 6,500 × g followed by ultracentrifugation of the supernatant at 100,000 × g. The heavy SR membrane fraction was obtained from loading mixed membranes onto a discontinuous sucrose density gradient. Heavy SR was collected, snap frozen in liquid N2, and stored at −80 °C. As reported previously, SR vesicles fused in a fixed orientation such that the cis-chamber corresponded to the cytosolic face of the channel and the trans-chamber to the SR lumen (21Carter S. Pitt S.J. Colyer J. Sitsapesan R. Ca2+-dependent phosphorylation of RyR2 can uncouple channel gating from direct cytosolic Ca2+ regulation.J. Membr.

The trans-chamber was held at ground and the cis-chamber at potentials relative to ground. After fusion, the cis-chamber was perfused with 250 mm HEPES, 80 mm Tris, and 10 μm free Ca2+ (pH 7.2). The trans-chamber was perfused with 250 mm glutamic acid and 10 mm HEPES (pH to 7.2) with Ca(OH)2 (concentration of free Ca2+ ∼50 mm). The identity of RyR2 was confirmed by the single-channel conductance, and the number of channels gating in the bilayer was assessed by the application of caffeine at the end of the experiment. Zn2+ was added as ZnCl2 to the cis-chamber at the required concentration from an appropriate stock solution. 100 mm stock solution of ZnCl2 was prepared in 0.029 m HCl, and serial ZnCl2 dilutions were made in a Tris/HEPES buffer which contained, 250 mm HEPES, 80 mm Tris, and 10 μm free Ca2+ (pH 7.2) to make appropriate stock solutions. The concentration of each Zn2+ stock was further assessed using a pZn meter (Neurobiotex.com, Galveston, TX) as previously described (23Bozym R. Hurst T.K. Westerberg N. Stoddard A. Fierke C.A. Frederickson C.J. Thompson R.B. Determination of zinc using carbonic anhydrase-based fluorescence biosensors.Methods Enzymol. 2008; 450: 287-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) to confirm the accuracy of our serial dilutions. The lowest concentration Zn2+ stock made was 10 nm. The addition of 100 μm ZnCl2 to our Tris/HEPES buffer had no significant effect on the pH (pH was 7.22 ± 0.014 before and 7.21 ± 0.016 after the addition of 100 μm ZnCl2; n = 3). Special care was taken when preparing Zn2+ stock solutions. All glassware was prewashed with 100 nm TPEN and then rinsed carefully with MilliQ water passed through a Chelex Resin (Bio-Rad). The use of colored pipette tips was also avoided. Experiments were carried out at room temperature (22 ± 2 °C). The concentration of free Ca2+ and pH of all of our solutions were determined using a Ca2+ electrode and a pH electrode (Hanna Instruments, Bedfordshire, UK) as previously described (20Sitsapesan R. Montgomery R.A. MacLeod K.T. Williams A.J. Sheep cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium release channels: modification of conductance and gating by temperature.J. Physiol. 1991; 434: 469-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Our measurements showed that the addition of Zn2+ ≤ 100 μm had no significant effect on the concentration of free Ca2+ ([Ca2+] was 10 ± 3.8 μm in the absence of Zn2+ and 10 ± 3.2 μm in the presence of 100 μm Zn2+ (n = 3). The addition of 1 mm BAPTA reduced the free Ca2+ concentration from 10 ± 2 μm to 10 ± 3.8 nm (n = 3). Subsequent addition of ZnCl2 (≤100 μm) had no significant effect on the measured free Ca2+ concentration (10 ± 3.2 nm; n = 3) under these conditions. The total concentration of Zn2+ in all of our recording solutions was assessed using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) (University of Edinburgh, Grant Institute, commercial facility) and shown to be below the detectable limit (1 ppb). Free Zn2+ was also assessed using a pZn meter and calculated to be ∼9 pm. The addition of concentrations of Ca2+ ≤ 100 μm had no significant effect on the concentration of free Zn2+ ([Zn2+] was 9 ± 7 pm in the presence of 10 μm Ca2+ and 10 ± 6 pm when Ca2+ was raised to 100 μm; n = 3). The calculated free Zn2+ concentration following addition of 1 mm cytosolic BAPTA was first estimated using the MaxChelator program and then assessed by actual measurements of free Zn2+ using a pZn meter. When the starting free Ca2+ concentration was 10 μm, the addition of 1 mm BAPTA had no significant effect on free Zn2+ levels. Single-channel currents were monitored under voltage-clamp conditions using a BC-525C amplifier (Warner Instruments, Harvard Instruments). Channel recordings were low pass filtered at 10 kHz with a 4-pole Bessel filter, digitized at 100 kHz using a National Instruments acquisition interface (NIDAQ-MX; National Instruments, Austin, TX), and recorded on a computer hard drive using WinEDR 3.05 software (John Dempster, University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, UK). The recordings were subsequently filtered at 800 Hz (−3 dB) using a low pass digital filter implemented in WinEDR 3.05. Channel events were detected by the 50% threshold method (24Colquhoun D. Sigworth F.J. Fitting and statistical analysis of single-channel recording.in: Sakmann B. Neher E. Single-channel Recording. Plenum, New York1983: 191-263Crossref Google Scholar) using TAC 4.2.0 software (Bruxton Corporation, Seattle, WA). Open probability (Po) and lifetime distributions were calculated from 3 min of continuous recording using TACfit 4.2.0 software (Bruxton Corporation). Lifetime analysis was carried out only when a single channel was incorporated into the bilayer. Individual lifetimes were fitted to a probability density function using the method of maximum likelihood (24Colquhoun D. Sigworth F.J. Fitting and statistical analysis of single-channel recording.in: Sakmann B. Neher E. Single-channel Recording. Plenum, New York1983: 191-263Crossref Google Scholar). Lifetimes of <1 ms were not fully resolved under the conditions of data acquisition described here and were therefore excluded from the fitting procedure. A missed events correction was applied as previously described (25Sigworth F.J. Sine S.M. Data transformations for improved display and fitting of single-channel dwell time histograms.Biophys.

The care and sacrifice of the animals conformed to the requirements of Directive 2010/63/EU of the European Parliament. All extracellular solutions were based on a modified Tyrode's solution. The basic solution contained, 135 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 330 μm NaH2PO4, 5 mm glucose, 5 mm sodium pyruvate, 10 mm HEPES, 1 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm CaCl2 (pH 7.4). Nominally Ca2+-free Tyrode's solution used during cardiomyocyte isolation was as outlined above with no added Ca2+. The protocol for isolation of cardiomyocytes was as described previously (26Sims M.W. Winter J. Brennan S. Norman R.I. Ng G.A. Squire I.B. Rainbow R.D. PKC-mediated toxicity of elevated glucose concentration on cardiomyocyte function.Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2014; 307: H587-H597Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Briefly, the whole heart was rapidly excised and placed into cold, nominally Ca2+-free Tyrode's solution (NT). The heart was then cannulated via the aorta on a Langendorff type apparatus and warmed NT buffer at 37 °C was perfused through the heart in a retrograde fashion for 6 min to clear residual blood. The solution was then exchanged for a Ca2+-free NT buffer with enzyme mix (containing 15 mg of collagenase type II (Worthington), with 50 mg of bovine serum albumin prepared from Cohn fraction V albumin and 18 mg of protease (type XIV 15% Ca2+) in 30 ml) for 8–15 min. Identification of rod-shaped cardiomyocytes in the perfusate was used as an indication of digestion being complete. The solution was then exchanged for a 2 mm Ca2+ NT solution, the heart was cut down, and cardiomyocytes were mechanically dispersed from the tissue in a shaking water bath. Typically this method yielded 70–90% rod-shaped cardiomyocytes, which were stored in NT solution at room temperature and used within 18 h of isolating. In intact myocytes, cells were exposed to ZnCl2 in the presence of the zinc ionophore, zinc pyrithione (ZnPy) to enable the entry of Zn2+ into the cell because ZnCl2 is cell-impermeable. Isolated cardiomyocytes were permeabilized using saponin. Briefly, cardiomyocytes were perfused with 0.5 mm Ca2+ Tyrode's solution for 2 min prior to perfusion with a solution containing 100 μm EGTA, 5 mm ATP, 10 mm HEPES, 150 mm potassium gluconate, 25 μm MgCl2 at 20 °C. The sarcolemmal membrane was permeabilized with saponin (50 μg/ml) for 30 s. After permeabilization, cardiomyocytes were maintained in recording solution containing 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES, 120 mm potassium gluconate, 5 mm ATP, 1 mm pyruvate, 1 mm free MgCl2, and 100 nm free Ca2+ (calculated using the MaxChelator program), and 30 μm Fluo-4, pH 7.2. 1 mm BAPTA was added as indicated in the text, and additional Zn2+ was added to maintain as required. Images from permeabilized cardiomyoyctes were recorded using an Olympus 1X81 confocal microscope system using Olympus Fluoview software (version 4.0). Line scans were recorded using a 60× oil immersion lens using 2 × 2 pixel binning where each pixel was 0.43 μm in diameter. Fluo-4 indicator was excited using a 488-nm laser, and line scans were acquired at a rate of 333 Hz. The data were analyzed offline using ImageJ software. In our Tyrode's solution alone, in the presence of 100 nm Ca2+, there was no significant change in Fluo-4 fluorescence with increasing concentrations of Zn2+ (ΔFluo-4 F/F0 0.026 ± 0.01 units in 10 nm Zn2+ compared with control Tyrode's solution with no ZnCl2 added). For the cardiomyocyte experiments, ZnCl2 stocks were made directly in Tyrode's solution because the maximum concentration of Zn2+ used was 100 nm. For measurements of Ca2+ or Zn2+ in intact cardiomyocytes using Fluo-4-AM or Zinpyr-1, cells were illuminated with 488 nm using a monochromator (Photon Technology International, Birmingham, NJ) with fluorescence emissions captured above 520 nm using a Cascade 512B CCD camera (Photometrics, Tuscan, AZ) and continuously perfused at 32 ± 2 °C. The data were acquired using EasyRatioPro software (Photon Technology International, Birmingham, NJ) and analyzed using Winfluor v3.6.8 software (John Dempster, University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, UK). Spontaneous contractions were measured from cardiomyocytes perfused with Tyrode's solution at 32 ± 1 °C where videos were recorded to DVD. Analysis of contractions was carried out using edge detection measurements in Winfluor version 3.6.8 software. The data were expressed as means ± S.E. Where appropriate, a Student's t test was used to assess the difference between mean values. A p value of 0.05 was taken as significant. Where multiple treatments were compared, ANOVA followed by a Bonferroni post hoc test was used to assess the difference between treatments. A p value of 0.05 was taken as significant. To determine whether Zn2+ can alter RyR2 gating, single RyR2 channels were incorporated into phospholipid bilayers enabling the membrane environment to be carefully controlled, and the direct action of Zn2+ at the cytosolic face of the channel was studied. Using Ca2+ as a permeant ion and holding at a command potential of 0 mV, which is considered to be the resting membrane potential of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (27Somlyo A.V. Gonzalez-Serratos H.G. Shuman H. McClellan G. Somlyo A.P. Calcium release and ionic changes in the sarcoplasmic reticulum of tetanized muscle: an electron probe study.J. Cell Biol. 1981; 90: 577-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), the addition of 100 pm Zn2+ to the cytosolic face of RyR2 channels significantly increased channel Po from 0.10 ± 0.03 to 0.45 ± 0.04 (Fig. 1), indicating that RyR2 has high affinity for Zn2+. The potentiation of RyR2 gating by physiological concentrations of free Zn2+ suggests that the amount of Ca2+ released through a single RyR2 channel following activation by cytosolic Ca2+ is significantly greater than previously thought. When Zn2+ levels were incremented in a cumulative fashion, channel activation plateaued at 1 nm Zn2+, and higher concentrations of Zn2+ (>10 nm) had no further significant effect on channel Po (Fig. 1B). Physiological concentrations of Zn2+ will therefore play a key role in regulating graded Ca2+ release events via RyR2 channels, enabling flexibility in the force of cardiac contraction, permitting the heart to adjust to altered diastolic filling (28Bers D.M. Cardiac excitation-contraction coupling.Nature. 2002; 415: 198-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (3345) Google Scholar). The addition of 1 mm Zn2+ to the cytosolic face of RyR2 completely abolished all channel openings (Fig. 1, A and B), possibly a consequence of Zn2+ binding to the low affinity divalent inhibitory site of RyR2 (29Laver D.R. Baynes T.M. Dulhunty A.F. Magnesium inhibition of ryanodine-receptor calcium channels: evidence for two independent mechanisms.J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 156: 213-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Control HCl buffer solution containing no Zn2+ had no significant effect on RyR2 gating (Fig. 2A). To confirm that the level of free Zn2+ in our recording solutions, which was measured at ∼9 pm, was insufficient to influence channel gating, we exposed RyR2 channels to the potent Zn2+ chelator TPEN. In the absence of exogenously added Zn2+, the addition of 100 nm TPEN to the cis-chamber caused no significant change in channel Po (Fig. 2B).FIGURE 2.HCl buffer and TPEN have no effect on RyR2 gating. The top traces in A and B show representative single RyR2 channel current fluctuations using 10 μm Ca2+ as the sole activating ligand. The bilayer was voltage-clamped at 0 mV. The lower traces in A and B show that addition of the HCl buffer (A) or the addition of 100 nm TPEN (B) to the cis-chamber had no significant effect on channel Po. The open and closed channel levels are denoted by O and C, respectively. The bar charts in A and B show both the average Po and the individual data points following the addition of the HCl buffer (A, n = 6) or 100 nm TPEN (B, n = 7). The data are expressed as means ± S.E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To investigate the mechanisms underlying RyR2 activation by Zn2+, we performed lifetime analysis on experiments where only a single RyR2 channel was gating in the bilayer. Dwell time histograms of the apparent open and apparent closed states uncovered three modes of Zn2+ operation at the cytosolic face of RyR2 (Fig. 1C). Control channel-gating was best characterized by short openings and long closing as described previously (30Ashley R.H. Williams A.J.

Physiol. 1990; 95: 981-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 31Stewart R. Song L. Carter S.M. Sigalas C. Zaccai N.R. Kanamarlapudi V. Bhat M.B. Takeshima H. Sitsapesan R. Single-channel characterization of the rabbit recombinant RyR2 reveals a novel inactivation property of physiological concentrations of ATP.J. Membr. Biol. 2008; 222: 65-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The addition of Zn2+ in the concentration range 100 pm to 10 nm appeared to sensitize RyR2 to cytosolic Ca2+, revealed by a reduction in the duration of all the closed states with little effect on the duration of channel openings (32Sitsapesan R. Williams A.J. Mechanisms of caffeine activation of single calcium-release channels of sheep cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum.J. Physiol. 1990; 423: 425-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). When the free Zn2+ concentration was elevated to >1 nm, RyR2 dwelled for longer sojourns in the open state and displayed briefer sojourns in the closed state (see Table 1 for average lifetime data). This type of gating is characteristic of Ca2+-independent channel openings (21Carter S. Pitt S.J. Colyer J. Sitsapesan R.

To assess whether Zn2+ binds to the same cytosolic activation sites on RyR2 as Ca2+, we first exposed RyR2 to a concentration of cytosolic Ca2+ known to elevate Po to peak levels (100 μm) (30Ashley R.H.

https://openalex.org/W1483455462,"The fusion of monocyte/macrophage lineage cells into fully active, multinucleated, bone resorbing osteoclasts is a complex cell biological phenomenon that utilizes specialized proteins. OC-STAMP, a multi-pass transmembrane protein, has been shown to be required for pre-osteoclast fusion and for optimal bone resorption activity. A previously reported knockout mouse model had only mononuclear osteoclasts with markedly reduced resorption activity in vitro, but with paradoxically normal skeletal micro-CT parameters. To further explore this and related questions, we used mouse ES cells carrying a gene trap allele to generate a second OC-STAMP null mouse strain. Bone histology showed overall normal bone form with large numbers of TRAP-positive, mononuclear osteoclasts. Micro-CT parameters were not significantly different between knockout and wild type mice at 2 or 6 weeks old. At 6 weeks, metaphyseal TRAP-positive areas were lower and mean size of the areas were smaller in knockout femora, but bone turnover markers in serum were normal. Bone marrow mononuclear cells became TRAP-positive when cultured with CSF-1 and RANKL, but they did not fuse. Expression levels of other osteoclast markers, such as cathepsin K, carbonic anhydrase II, and NFATc1, were not significantly different compared to wild type. Actin rings were present, but small, and pit assays showed a 3.5-fold decrease in area resorbed. Restoring OC-STAMP in knockout cells by lentiviral transduction rescued fusion and resorption. N- and C-termini of OC-STAMP were intracellular, and a predicted glycosylation site was shown to be utilized and to lie on an extracellular loop. The site is conserved in all terrestrial vertebrates and appears to be required for protein stability, but not for fusion. Based on this and other results, we present a topological model of OC-STAMP as a 6-transmembrane domain protein. We also contrast the osteoclast-specific roles of OC- and DC-STAMP with more generalized cell fusion mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W658752870,"Cold atmospheric plasma (plasma) has emerged as a novel tool for a cancer treatment option, having been successfully applied to a few types of cancer cells, as well as tissues. However, to date, no studies have been performed to examine the effect of plasma on epigenetic alterations, including CpG methylation. In this study, the effects of plasma on DNA methylation changes in breast cancer cells were examined by treating cultured MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells, representing estrogen-positive and estrogen-negative cancer cells, respectively, with plasma. A pyrosequencing analysis of Alu indicated that a specific CpG site was induced to be hypomethylated from 23.4 to 20.3% (p < 0.05) by plasma treatment in the estrogen-negative MDA-MB-231 cells only. A genome-wide methylation analysis identified ""cellular movement, connective tissue development and function, tissue development"" and ""cell-to-cell signaling and interaction, cell death and survival, cellular development"" as the top networks. Of the two cell types, the MDA-MB-231 cells underwent a higher rate of apoptosis and a decreased proliferation rate upon plasma treatment. Taken together, these results indicate that plasma induces epigenetic and cellular changes in a cell type-specific manner, suggesting that a careful screening of target cells and tissues is necessary for the potential application of plasma as a cancer treatment option."

https://openalex.org/W1538599062,"The response of the brain to irradiation is complex, involving a multitude of stress inducible pathways that regulate neurotransmission within a dynamic microenvironment. While significant past work has detailed the consequences of CNS radiotherapy following relatively high doses (≥ 45 Gy), few studies have been conducted at much lower doses (≤ 2 Gy), where the response of the CNS (like many other tissues) may differ substantially from that expected from linear extrapolations of high dose data. Low dose exposure could elicit radioadaptive modulation of critical CNS processes such as neurogenesis, that provide cellular input into hippocampal circuits known to impact learning and memory. Here we show that mice deficient for chemokine signaling through genetic disruption of the CCR2 receptor exhibit a neuroprotective phenotype. Compared to wild type (WT) animals, CCR2 deficiency spared reductions in hippocampal neural progenitor cell survival and stabilized neurogenesis following exposure to low dose irradiation. While radiation-induced changes in microglia levels were not found in WT or CCR2 deficient animals, the number of Iba1+ cells did differ between each genotype at the higher dosing paradigms, suggesting that blockade of this signaling axis could moderate the neuroinflammatory response. Interestingly, changes in proinflammatory gene expression were limited in WT animals, while irradiation caused significant elevations in these markers that were attenuated significantly after radioadaptive dosing paradigms in CCR2 deficient mice. These data point to the importance of chemokine signaling under low dose paradigms, findings of potential significance to those exposed to ionizing radiation under a variety of occupational and/or medical scenarios."
https://openalex.org/W1533778536,"It has been well established that the architecture of chromatin in cell nuclei is not random but functionally correlated. Chromatin damage caused by ionizing radiation raises complex repair machineries. This is accompanied by local chromatin rearrangements and structural changes which may for instance improve the accessibility of damaged sites for repair protein complexes. Using stably transfected HeLa cells expressing either green fluorescent protein (GFP) labelled histone H2B or yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) labelled histone H2A, we investigated the positioning of individual histone proteins in cell nuclei by means of high resolution localization microscopy (Spectral Position Determination Microscopy = SPDM). The cells were exposed to ionizing radiation of different doses and aliquots were fixed after different repair times for SPDM imaging. In addition to the repair dependent histone protein pattern, the positioning of antibodies specific for heterochromatin and euchromatin was separately recorded by SPDM. The present paper aims to provide a quantitative description of structural changes of chromatin after irradiation and during repair. It introduces a novel approach to analyse SPDM images by means of statistical physics and graph theory. The method is based on the calculation of the radial distribution functions as well as edge length distributions for graphs defined by a triangulation of the marker positions. The obtained results show that through the cell nucleus the different chromatin re-arrangements as detected by the fluorescent nucleosomal pattern average themselves. In contrast heterochromatic regions alone indicate a relaxation after radiation exposure and re-condensation during repair whereas euchromatin seemed to be unaffected or behave contrarily. SPDM in combination with the analysis techniques applied allows the systematic elucidation of chromatin re-arrangements after irradiation and during repair, if selected sub-regions of nuclei are investigated."

Hepper] is an important legume crop extensively grown in south and south-east Asia, where it is a major source of dietary protein for its predominantly vegetarian population. However, lack of genomic information and markers has become a limitation for genetic improvement of this crop. Here, we report the transcriptome sequencing of the immature seeds of black gram cv. TU94-2, by Illumina paired end sequencing technology to generate transcriptome sequences for gene discovery and genic-SSR marker development. A total of 17.2 million paired-end reads were generated and 48,291 transcript contigs (TCS) were assembled with an average length of 443 bp. Based on sequence similarity search, 33,766 TCS showed significant similarity to known proteins. Among these, only 29,564 TCS were annotated with gene ontology (GO) functional categories. A total number of 138 unique KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) pathways were identified, of which majority of TCS are grouped into purine metabolism (678) followed by pyrimidine metabolism (263). A total of 48,291 TCS were searched for SSRs and 1,840 SSRs were identified in 1,572 TCS with an average frequency of one SSR per 11.9 kb. The tri-nucleotide repeats were most abundant (35%) followed by di-nucleotide repeats (32%). PCR primer pairs were successfully designed for 933 SSR loci. Sequences analyses indicate that about 64.4% and 35.6% of the SSR motifs were present in the coding sequences (CDS) and untranslated regions (UTRs) respectively. Tri-nucleotide repeats (57.3%) were preferentially present in the CDS. The rate of successful amplification and polymorphism were investigated using selected primers among 18 black gram accessions. Genic-SSR markers developed from the Illumina paired end sequencing of black gram immature seed transcriptome will provide a valuable resource for genetic diversity, evolution, linkage mapping, comparative genomics and marker-assisted selection in black gram."

The editorial boards of: The Spine Journal; Spine; European Spine Journal; Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine; and Journal of Spinal Disorders & Techniques were extracted on January 2013 from the journals' websites. Disclosure statements were retrieved from the 2013 disclosure index of the North American Spine Society; the program of the 20th International Meeting on Advanced Spine Techniques; the program of the 48th Annual Meeting of the Scoliosis Research Society; the program of the AOSpine global spine congress; the presentations of the 2013 Annual Eurospine meeting; and the disclosure index of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Names of the editorial board members were compared with the individuals who completed a disclosure for one of these indexes. Disclosures were extracted when full names matched. Two hundred and ten (29%) of the 716 identified editorial board members reported a potential conflict of interest and 154 (22%) reported nothing to disclose. The remaining 352 (49%) editorial board members had no disclosure statement listed for one of the indexes. Eighty-nine (42%) of the 210 editorial board members with a potential conflict of interest reported a financial relationship of more than $10,000 during the prior year. This finding confirms that potential conflicts of interest exist in editorial boards which might influence the peer review process and can result in bias.

Serum containing medium supplemented with higher serum, glucose, an omega-3 lipid cocktail, eicosapentaenoic acid or sebomed medium were investigated for lipid accumulation and ultrastructural morphology.Lipid droplet accumulation in HMGEC was induced by serum containing media after 1 day, but decreased over time. Cultivation in serum induced desmosome and cytokeratin filament formation. Desmoplakin 1/2 gene levels were significantly upregulated after 1d of serum treatment. Furthermore, the normalized impedance increased significantly. Lipidome analysis revealed high levels of phospholipids (over 50%), but very low levels of wax ester and cholesteryl esters (under 1%). Stimulation with eicosapentaenoic acid increased lipid accumulation after one day.Serum treatment of HMGEC caused lipid droplet formation to some extent but also induced keratinization. The cells did not produce typical meibum lipids under these growth conditions. HMGEC are well suited to study (hyper)keratinization processes of meibomian gland epithelial cells in vitro."

However, little is understood about the molecular mechanism underlying leaf-color variations. In this study, we found the content of photosynthetic pigments, especially chlorophyll degradation metabolite in the leaf-color mutants is distinguished significantly from that in the wild type of Cymbidium sinense 'Dharma'. To further determine the candidate genes controlling leaf-color variations, we first sequenced the global transcriptome using 454 pyrosequencing. More than 0.7 million expressed sequence tags (ESTs) with an average read length of 445.9 bp were generated and assembled into 103,295 isotigs representing 68,460 genes. Of these isotigs, 43,433 were significantly aligned to known proteins in the public database, of which 29,299 could be categorized into 42 functional groups in the gene ontology system, 10,079 classified into 23 functional classifications in the clusters of orthologous groups system, and 23,092 assigned to 139 clusters of specific metabolic pathways in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes. Among these annotations, 95 isotigs were designated as involved in chlorophyll metabolism. On this basis, we identified 16 key enzyme-encoding genes in the chlorophyll metabolism pathway, the full length cDNAs and expressions of which were further confirmed. Expression pattern indicated that the key enzyme-encoding genes for chlorophyll degradation were more highly expressed in the leaf color mutants, as was consistent with their lower chlorophyll contents. This study is the first to supply an informative 454 EST dataset for Cymbidium sinense 'Dharma' and to identify original leaf color-associated genes, which provide important resources to facilitate gene discovery for molecular breeding, marketable trait discovery, and investigating various biological process in this species."

The present study investigated time course and neural basis of emotional interference in SAD using event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Patients with SAD and healthy controls performed an emotional stroop task which allowed examining interference effects on the current and the succeeding trial. Reaction time data showed an emotional interference effect in the current trial, but not the succeeding trial, specifically in SAD. FMRI data showed greater activation in the left amygdala, bilateral insula, medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and left opercular part of the inferior frontal gyrus during emotional interference of the current trial in SAD patients. Furthermore, we found a positive correlation between patients’ interference scores and activation in the mPFC, dorsal ACC and left angular/supramarginal gyrus. Taken together, results indicate a network of brain regions comprising amygdala, insula, mPFC, ACC, and areas strongly involved in language processing during the processing of task-unrelated threat in SAD. However, specifically the activation in mPFC, dorsal ACC, and left angular/supramarginal gyrus is associated with the strength of the interference effect, suggesting a cognitive network model of attentional bias in SAD. This probably comprises exceeded allocation of attentional resources to disorder-related information of the presented stimuli and increased self-referential and semantic processing of threat words in SAD."

The mean diameter of arterioles decreased during 100% oxygen breathing compared to baseline (9.7±1.4 pixels vs. 10.3±1.3 pixels, p<0.0001) and the same applies to the mean venular diameter (11.4±1.2 pixels vs. 13.3±1.5 pixels, p<0.0001).Breathing 100% oxygen increases oxygen saturation in retinal arterioles and more so in venules and constricts them compared to baseline levels. The dramatic increase in oxygen saturation in venules reflects oxygen flow from the choroid and the unusual vascular anatomy and oxygen physiology of the eye."
https://openalex.org/W637411693,"Inhibitors of VEGF receptor (VEGFR) signaling such as sorafenib and sunitinib that are currently used in the treatment of malignant diseases have been shown to affect immunological responses by inhibition of the function of antigen presenting cells and T lymphocytes. The VEGFR-inhibitor axitinib has recently been approved for second line therapy of metastatic renal cell carcinoma. While there is some evidence that axitinib might interfere with the activation of T cells, not much is known about the effects of axitinib on dendritic cell (DC) phenotype and function. We here show that the addition of axitinib during the final Toll-like receptor-4-induced maturation step of monocyte-derived human DCs results in a reduced DC activation characterized by impaired expression of activation markers and co-stimulatory molecules such as CD80, CD83 and CD86. We further found a decreased secretion of interleukin-12 which was accompanied by reduced nuclear expression of the transcription factor cRel. In addition, we found a dose-dependent reduced activation of p38 and STAT3 in axitinib-exposed DCs, whereas the expression was not affected. The dysfunction of axitinib-exposed DCs was further underlined by their impaired induction of allogeneic T cell proliferation in a mixed lymphocyte reaction assay and inhibition of DC migration. Our results demonstrate that axitinib significantly affects DC differentiation and function primarily via the inhibition of the nuclear factor kappa B signaling pathway leading to impaired T cell activation. This will be of importance for the design of future vaccination protocols and therapeutic approaches aiming at combining different treatment strategies, eg such as programmed death-1 inhibitors with axitinib."
https://openalex.org/W642753331,"Salinity is one of the main factors that explain the distribution of species in the Baltic Sea. Increased precipitation and consequent increase in freshwater inflow is predicted to decrease salinity in some areas of the Baltic Sea. Clearly such changes may have profound effects on the organisms living there. Here we investigate the response of the commonly occurring cyanobacterium Dolichospermum spp. to three salinities, 0, 3 and 6. For the three strains tested we recorded growth, intracellular toxicity (microcystin) and allelopathic properties. We show that Dolichospermum can grow in all the three salinities tested with highest growth rates in the lowest salinity. All strains showed allelopathic potential and it differed significantly between strains and salinities, but was highest in the intermediate salinity and lowest in freshwater. Intracellular toxin concentration was highest in salinity 6. In addition, based on monitoring data from the northern Baltic Proper and the Gulf of Finland, we show that salinity has decreased, while Dolichospermum spp. biomass has increased between 1979 and 2013. Thus, based on our experimental findings it is evident that salinity plays a large role in Dolichospermum growth, allelopathic properties and toxicity. In combination with our long-term data analyses, we conclude that decreasing salinity is likely to result in a more favourable environment for Dolichospermum spp. in some areas of the Baltic Sea."
https://openalex.org/W1523278280,"Background Intra-amniotic infection has long been recognized as the leading cause of preterm delivery. Microbial culture is the gold standard for the detection of intra-amniotic infection, but several days are required, and many bacterial species in the amniotic fluid are difficult to cultivate. Methods We developed a novel nested-PCR-based assay for detecting Mycoplasma, Ureaplasma, other bacteria and fungi in amniotic fluid samples within three hours of sample collection. To detect prokaryotes, eukaryote-made thermostable DNA polymerase, which is free from bacterial DNA contamination, is used in combination with bacterial universal primers. In contrast, to detect eukaryotes, conventional bacterially-made thermostable DNA polymerase is used in combination with fungal universal primers. To assess the validity of the PCR assay, we compared the PCR and conventional culture results using 300 amniotic fluid samples. Results Based on the detection level (positive and negative), 93.3% (280/300) of Mycoplasma, 94.3% (283/300) of Ureaplasma, 89.3% (268/300) of other bacteria and 99.7% (299/300) of fungi matched the culture results. Meanwhile, concerning the detection of bacteria other than Mycoplasma and Ureaplasma, 228 samples were negative according to the PCR method, 98.2% (224/228) of which were also negative based on the culture method. Employing the devised primer sets, mixed amniotic fluid infections of Mycoplasma, Ureaplasma and/or other bacteria could be clearly distinguished. In addition, we also attempted to compare the relative abundance in 28 amniotic fluid samples with mixed infection, and judged dominance by comparing the Ct values of quantitative real-time PCR. Conclusions We developed a novel PCR assay for the rapid detection of Mycoplasma, Ureaplasma, other bacteria and fungi in amniotic fluid samples. This assay can also be applied to accurately diagnose the absence of bacteria in samples. We believe that this assay will positively contribute to the treatment of intra-amniotic infection and the prevention of preterm delivery."

https://openalex.org/W578359658,"Scincine lizards in Madagascar form an endemic clade of about 60 species exhibiting a variety of ecomorphological adaptations. Several subclades have adapted to burrowing and convergently regressed their limbs and eyes, resulting in a variety of partial and completely limbless morphologies among extant taxa. However, patterns of limb regression in these taxa have not been studied in detail. Here we fill this gap in knowledge by providing a phylogenetic analysis of DNA sequences of three mitochondrial and four nuclear gene fragments in an extended sampling of Malagasy skinks, and microtomographic analyses of osteology of various burrowing taxa adapted to sand substrate. Based on our data we propose to (i) consider Sirenoscincus Sakata & Hikida, 2003, as junior synonym of Voeltzkowia Boettger, 1893; (ii) resurrect the genus name Grandidierina Mocquard, 1894, for four species previously included in Voeltzkowia; and (iii) consider Androngo Brygoo, 1982, as junior synonym of Pygomeles Grandidier, 1867. By supporting the clade consisting of the limbless Voeltzkowia mira and the forelimb-only taxa V. mobydick and V. yamagishii, our data indicate that full regression of limbs and eyes occurred in parallel twice in the genus Voeltzkowia (as hitherto defined) that we consider as a sand-swimming ecomorph: in the Voeltzkowia clade sensu stricto the regression first affected the hindlimbs and subsequently the forelimbs, whereas the Grandidierina clade first regressed the forelimbs and subsequently the hindlimbs following the pattern prevalent in squamates. Timetree reconstructions for the Malagasy Scincidae contain a substantial amount of uncertainty due to the absence of suitable primary fossil calibrations. However, our preliminary reconstructions suggest rapid limb regression in Malagasy scincids with an estimated maximal duration of 6 MYr for a complete regression in Paracontias, and 4 and 8 MYr respectively for complete regression of forelimbs in Grandidierina and hindlimbs in Voeltzkowia."
https://openalex.org/W612448770,"Background Inflammation has a crucial role in renal interstitial fibrosis, which is the common pathway of chronic kidney diseases. Mefunidone (MFD) is a new compound which could effectively inhibit the proliferation of renal fibroblasts in vitro. However, the overall effect of Mefunidone in renal fibrosis remains unknown. Methods Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided intro 6 groups: sham operation, unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO), UUO/Mefunidone (25, 50, 100mg/kg/day) and UUO/PFD (500mg/kg/day). The rats were sacrificed respectively on days 3, 7, and 14 after the operation. Tubulointerstitial injury index, interstitial collagen deposition, expression of fibronectin (FN), α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), type I and III collagen and the number of CD3+ and CD68+ cells were determined. The expressions of proinflammatory cytokines, p-ERK, p-IκB, and p-STAT3 were measured in human renal proximal tubular epithelial cells of HK-2 or macrophages. Results Mefunidone treatment significantly attenuated tubulointerstitial injury, interstitial collagen deposition, expression of FN, α-SMA, type I and III collagen in the obstructive kidneys, which correlated with significantly reduced the number of T cells and macrophages in the obstructive kidneys. Mechanistically, Mefunidone significantly inhibited tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α-) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced production of proinflammatory cytokines. This effect is possibly due to the inhibition of phosphorylation of ERK, IκB, and STAT3. Conclusion Mefunidone treatment attenuated tubulointerstitial fibrosis in a rat model of UUO, at least in part, through inhibition of inflammation."

A primary product of the oxidative and hydrolytic cellulose degradation system is cellobionic acid (CbA), the aldonic acid form of cellobiose. We previously demonstrated that the intracellular enzyme belonging to glycoside hydrolase family 94 from cellulolytic fungus and bacterium is cellobionic acid phosphorylase (CBAP), which catalyzes reversible phosphorolysis of CbA into glucose 1-phosphate and gluconic acid (GlcA). In this report, we describe the biochemical characterization and the three-dimensional structure of CBAP from the marine cellulolytic bacterium Saccharophagus degradans. Structures of ligand-free and complex forms with CbA, GlcA, and a synthetic disaccharide product from glucuronic acid were determined at resolutions of up to 1.6 Å. The active site is located near the dimer interface. At subsite +1, the carboxylate group of GlcA and CbA is recognized by Arg-609 and Lys-613. Additionally, one residue from the neighboring protomer (Gln-190) is involved in the carboxylate recognition of GlcA. A mutational analysis indicated that these residues are critical for the binding and catalysis of the aldonic and uronic acid acceptors GlcA and glucuronic acid. Structural and sequence comparisons with other glycoside hydrolase family 94 phosphorylases revealed that CBAPs have a unique subsite +1 with a distinct amino acid residue conservation pattern at this site. This study provides molecular insight into the energetically efficient metabolic pathway of oxidized sugars that links the oxidative cellulolytic pathway to the glycolytic and pentose phosphate pathways in cellulolytic microbes.

https://openalex.org/W560453847,"Impulsivity, i.e. irresistibility in the execution of actions, may be prominent in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients who are treated with dopamine precursors or dopamine receptor agonists. In this study, we combine clinical investigations with computational modeling to explore whether impulsivity in PD patients on medication may arise as a result of abnormalities in risk, reward and punishment learning. In order to empirically assess learning outcomes involving risk, reward and punishment, four subject groups were examined: healthy controls, ON medication PD patients with impulse control disorder (PD-ON ICD) or without ICD (PD-ON non-ICD), and OFF medication PD patients (PD-OFF). A neural network model of the Basal Ganglia (BG) that has the capacity to predict the dysfunction of both the dopaminergic (DA) and the serotonergic (5HT) neuromodulator systems was developed and used to facilitate the interpretation of experimental results. In the model, the BG action selection dynamics were mimicked using a utility function based decision making framework, with DA controlling reward prediction and 5HT controlling punishment and risk predictions. The striatal model included three pools of Medium Spiny Neurons (MSNs), with D1 receptor (R) alone, D2R alone and co-expressing D1R-D2R. Empirical studies showed that reward optimality was increased in PD-ON ICD patients while punishment optimality was increased in PD-OFF patients. Empirical studies also revealed that PD-ON ICD subjects had lower reaction times (RT) compared to that of the PD-ON non-ICD patients. Computational modeling suggested that PD-OFF patients have higher punishment sensitivity, while healthy controls showed comparatively higher risk sensitivity. A significant decrease in sensitivity to punishment and risk was crucial for explaining behavioral changes observed in PD-ON ICD patients. Our results highlight the power of computational modelling for identifying neuronal circuitry implicated in learning, and its impairment in PD. The results presented here not only show that computational modelling can be used as a valuable tool for understanding and interpreting clinical data, but they also show that computational modeling has the potential to become an invaluable tool to predict the onset of behavioral changes during disease progression."
https://openalex.org/W1433757129,"The prevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in Malaysia has been estimated at 2.5% of the adult population. Our objective, satisfying one of the directives of the WHO Framework for Global Action on Viral Hepatitis, was to forecast the HCV disease burden in Malaysia using modelling methods.An age-structured multi-state Markov model was developed to simulate the natural history of HCV infection. We tested three historical incidence scenarios that would give rise to the estimated prevalence in 2009, and calculated the incidence of cirrhosis, end-stage liver disease, and death, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) under each scenario, to the year 2039. In the baseline scenario, current antiviral treatment levels were extended from 2014 to the end of the simulation period. To estimate the disease burden averted under current sustained virological response rates and treatment levels, the baseline scenario was compared to a counterfactual scenario in which no past or future treatment is assumed.In the baseline scenario, the projected disease burden for the year 2039 is 94,900 DALYs/year (95% credible interval (CrI): 77,100 to 124,500), with 2,002 (95% CrI: 1340 to 3040) and 540 (95% CrI: 251 to 1,030) individuals predicted to develop decompensated cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, respectively, in that year. Although current treatment practice is estimated to avert a cumulative total of 2,200 deaths from DC or HCC, a cumulative total of 63,900 HCV-related deaths is projected by 2039.The HCV-related disease burden is already high and is forecast to rise steeply over the coming decades under current levels of antiviral treatment. Increased governmental resources to improve HCV screening and treatment rates and to reduce transmission are essential to address the high projected HCV disease burden in Malaysia."

In this study we investigated the frequency of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of several candidate genes associated with NAFLD in Taiwanese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) and NAFLD and in those with DM but without fatty liver disease.We enrolled 350 patients with type 2 DM and NAFLD and 209 patients with DM but without NAFLD. Body mass index (BMI), % body fat (% BF), glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), high molecular weight (HMW) isoform of adiponectin, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and triglyceride (TG) levels were measured. Thirteen SNPs in 5 genes (adiponectin, leptin, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha, adiponutrin/patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing protein 3 and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ co-activator 1α ) were measured.Only adiponectin rs266729 polymorphism was associated with susceptibility to NAFLD (p = 0.001). Subgroup analysis revealed that the proportion of subjects with homozygous genotype GG was higher in patients with NAFLD (31%) than in controls (11%) and that the proportions of heterozygous CG and homozygous CC were higher in controls (37% and 52%, respectively) than in patients with NAFLD (33% and 36%, respectively). Patients with NAFLD carrying the GG genotype of rs266729 showed significantly lower serum HMW adiponectin levels than patients carrying the GC or CC genotype (3.75±0.37 vs. 3.99±0.66 vs. 4.79±0.58 μg/ml, p< 0.001). Body fat and serum HMW adiponectin levels were the strongest predictors of developing NAFLD (p < 0.001 and 0.004, respectively).In patients with type 2 diabetes gene polymorphism of adiponectin rs266729 is associated with risk of NAFLD. G allele of rs266729 is associated with hypoadiponectinemia. Low serum adiponectin level may precipitate liver steatosis in patients with type 2 diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W1482908698,"Electron transfer reactions among three prominent colored proteins in intact cells of Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans were monitored using an integrating cavity absorption meter that permitted the acquisition of accurate absorbance data in suspensions of cells that scattered light. The concentrations of proteins in the periplasmic space were estimated to be 350 and 25 mg/ml for rusticyanin and cytochrome c, respectively; cytochrome a was present as one molecule for every 91 nm2 in the cytoplasmic membrane. All three proteins were rapidly reduced to the same relative extent when suspensions of live bacteria were mixed with different concentrations of ferrous ions at pH 1.5. The subsequent molecular oxygen-dependent oxidation of the multicenter respiratory chain occurred with a single macroscopic rate constant, regardless of the proteins' in vitro redox potentials or their putative positions in the aerobic iron respiratory chain. The crowded electron transport proteins in the periplasm of the organism constituted an electron conductive medium where the network of protein interactions functioned in a concerted fashion as a single ensemble with a standard reduction potential of 650 mV. The appearance of product ferric ions was correlated with the reduction levels of the periplasmic electron transfer proteins; the limiting first-order catalytic rate constant for aerobic respiration on iron was 7,400 s−1. The ability to conduct direct spectrophotometric studies under noninvasive physiological conditions represents a new and powerful approach to examine the extent and rates of biological events in situ without disrupting the complexity of the live cellular environment."

The immediate response to this stress includes the induction of expression of the neutral amino acid transporter SNAT2. Increased SNAT2-mediated uptake of neutral amino acids is an essential adaptive mechanism for restoring cell volume. In contrast, stress-induced phosphorylation of the α subunit of the translation initiation factor eIF2 (eIF2α) can promote apoptosis. Here we show that the response to mild hyperosmotic stress involves regulation of the phosphorylation of eIF2α by increased levels of GADD34, a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1). The induction of GADD34 was dependent on transcriptional control by the c-Jun-binding cAMP response element in the GADD34 gene promoter and posttranscriptional stabilization of its mRNA. This mechanism differs from the regulation of GADD34 expression by other stresses that involve activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4). ATF4 was not translated during hyperosmotic stress despite an increase in eIF2α phosphorylation. The SNAT2-mediated increase in amino acid uptake was enhanced by increased GADD34 levels in a manner involving decreased eIF2α phosphorylation.

https://openalex.org/W604518522,"Background Faith-based organizations (FBOs) have been active in the health sector for decades. Recently, the role of FBOs in global health has been of increased interest. However, little is known about the magnitude and trends in development assistance for health (DAH) channeled through these organizations. Material and Methods Data were collected from the 21 most recent editions of the Report of Voluntary Agencies. These reports provide information on the revenue and expenditure of organizations. Project-level data were also collected and reviewed from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. More than 1,900 non-governmental organizations received funds from at least one of these three organizations. Background information on these organizations was examined by two independent reviewers to identify the amount of funding channeled through FBOs. Results In 2013, total spending by the FBOs identified in the VolAg amounted to US$1.53 billion. In 1990, FB0s spent 34.1% of total DAH provided by private voluntary organizations reported in the VolAg. In 2013, FBOs expended 31.0%. Funds provided by the Global Fund to FBOs have grown since 2002, amounting to $80.9 million in 2011, or 16.7% of the Global Fund’s contributions to NGOs. In 2011, the Gates Foundation’s contributions to FBOs amounted to $7.1 million, or 1.1% of the total provided to NGOs. Conclusion Development assistance partners exhibit a range of preferences with respect to the amount of funds provided to FBOs. Overall, estimates show that FBOS have maintained a substantial and consistent share over time, in line with overall spending in global health on NGOs. These estimates provide the foundation for further research on the spending trends and effectiveness of FBOs in global health."

https://openalex.org/W575483703,"Na+/H+ exchanger-3 (NHE3) plays an essential role in maintaining sodium and fluid homeostasis in the intestine and kidney epithelium. Thus, NHE3 is highly regulated and its function depends on binding to multiple regulatory proteins. Ezrin complexed with NHE3 affects its activity via not well-defined mechanisms. This study investigates mechanisms by which ezrin regulates NHE3 activity in epithelial Opossum Kidney cells. Ezrin is activated sequentially by phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) binding and phosphorylation of threonine 567. Expression of ezrin lacking PIP2 binding sites inhibited NHE3 activity (-40%) indicating that ezrin binding to PIP2 is required for preserving NHE3 activity. Expression of a phosphomimetic ezrin mutated at the PIP2 binding region was sufficient not only to reverse NHE3 activity to control levels but also to increase its activity (+80%) similar to that of the expression of ezrin carrying the phosphomimetic mutation alone. Calcineurin Homologous Protein-1 (CHP1) is part, with ezrin, of the NHE3 regulatory complex. CHP1-mediated activation of NHE3 activity was blocked by expression of an ezrin variant that could not be phosphorylated but not by an ezrin variant unable to bind PIP2. Thus, for NHE3 activity under baseline conditions not only ezrin phosphorylation, but also ezrin spatial-temporal targeting on the plasma membrane via PIP2 binding is required; however, phosphorylation of ezrin appears to overcome the control of NHE3 transport. CHP1 action on NHE3 activity is not contingent on ezrin binding to PIP2 but rather on ezrin phosphorylation. These findings are important in understanding the interrelation and dynamics of a CHP1-ezrin-NHE3 regulatory complex."

Here we report on extensive seismites in the Late Quaternary-Recent (≤ ~ 28,000 years BP) alluvial and lacustrine strata of the Rukwa Rift Basin, a segment of the Western Branch of the East African Rift System. We document examples of the most highly deformed sediments in shallow, subsurface strata close to the regional capital of Mbeya, Tanzania. This includes a remarkable, clastic ‘megablock complex’ that preserves remobilized sediment below vertically displaced blocks of intact strata (megablocks), some in excess of 20 m-wide.

There was significant difference between hemodialysis patients and controls in autonomic function parameters in 24h-Holter and exercise treadmill test. Probability of having autonomic dysfunction in hemodialysis patients compared to controls was 29.7 at the exercise treadmill test and 13.0 in the 24-hour Holter. Chronotropic index, heart rate recovery at the 1st min, and SDNN at exercise were used to develop an autonomic dysfunction score to grade autonomic dysfunction, in which, 83% of hemodialysis patients reached a scoring ≥2 in contrast to 20% of controls. Hemodialysis was independently associated with either altered chronotropic index or autonomic dysfunction scoring ≥2 in every tested model (OR=50.1, P=0.003; and OR=270.9, P=0.002, respectively, model 5).The exercise treadmill test was feasible and useful to diagnose of the autonomic dysfunction in hemodialysis patients. Chronotropic index and autonomic dysfunction scoring ≥2 were the most effective parameters to differentiate between hemodialysis patients and controls suggesting that these variables portrays the best ability to detect autonomic dysfunction in this setting."

Linkage analysis was performed using Merlin. EMMAX was used to carry out a genome-wide association analysis comparing the familial AAD cases to 2706 UK WTCCC controls. To explore some of the linkage findings further, a replication study was performed by genotyping 64 SNPs in two of the four linked regions (chromosomes 7 and 18), on the Sequenom iPlex platform in three European AAD case-control cohorts (1097 cases, 1117 controls). The data were analysed using a meta-analysis approach.In a parametric analysis, applying a rare dominant model, loci on chromosomes 7, 9 and 18 had LOD scores >2.8. In a non-parametric analysis, a locus corresponding to the HLA region on chromosome 6, known to be associated with AAD, had a LOD score >3.0. In the genome-wide association analysis, a SNP cluster on chromosome 2 and a pair of SNPs on chromosome 6 were associated with AAD (P <5x10-7). A meta-analysis of the replication study data demonstrated that three chromosome 18 SNPs were associated with AAD, including a non-synonymous variant in the NFATC1 gene.This linkage study has implicated a number of novel chromosomal regions in the pathogenesis of AAD in multiplex AAD families and adds further support to the role of HLA in AAD. The genome-wide association analysis has also identified a region of interest on chromosome 2. A replication study has demonstrated that the NFATC1 gene is worthy of future investigation, however each of the regions identified require further, systematic analysis."

SP-C is a small α-helical hydrophobic protein with an unusually high content of valine residues. SP-C is prone to convert into β-sheet aggregates, forming amyloid fibrils. Nature's way of solving this folding problem is to include a BRICHOS domain in pro-SP-C, which functions as a chaperone for SP-C during biosynthesis.

SP-C together with phospholipids lowers alveolar surface tension and prevents the lung from collapsing at the end of expiration (1Casals C. Cañadas O.

Hydrophobic surfactant proteins in lung function and disease.N. Engl. J. Med. 2002; 347: 2141-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Pro-SP-C is synthesized as a type II membrane protein, with its N-terminal segment facing the cytosol and the single TM segment inserted into the ER membrane in a co-translational manner (3Keller A.

Recognition of transmembrane helices by the endoplasmic reticulum translocon.Nature. 2005; 433: 377-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, the insertion process is mediated by a proteinaceous channel, the translocon Sec61, composed of Sec61α, -β, and -γ (5Nyathi Y. Wilkinson B.M. Pool M.R.

Membrane protein insertion at the endoplasmic reticulum.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2011; 27: 25-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Both the hydrophobicity of the TM segments and the charged residues flanking the TM segments play important roles in this process. N-Linked glycosylation is one of the most common types of eukaryotic protein modifications. The attachment of carbohydrates to asparagine in secretory and membrane proteins takes place during co-translational translocation across the ER membrane. The transfer of high mannose oligosaccharides from a dolichol carrier to Asn-X-Thr/Ser acceptor sites is catalyzed by the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) (8Kelleher D.J. Gilmore R. An evolving view of the eukaryotic oligosaccharyltransferase.Glycobiology. 2006; 16: 47R-62RCrossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). The OST catalytic site is located on the luminal side of the ER membrane, and the enzyme is located near the translocon, the site of protein translocation and integration in the ER membrane (8Kelleher D.J. Gilmore R. An evolving view of the eukaryotic oligosaccharyltransferase.Glycobiology. 2006; 16: 47R-62RCrossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). The C-terminal part of pro-SP-C is localized in the ER lumen and harbors a BRICHOS domain and an ∼30-residue linker region that separates the BRICHOS domain from the ER membrane. The BRICHOS domain consists of ∼100 amino acid residues and was initially identified in Bri2, chondromodulin and pro-SP-C, but later found to be present in more than 1000 different proteins, divided into families. The overall amino acid sequence conservation of the BRICHOS domain is low, but it shows a well conserved secondary structure pattern (9Hedlund J. Johansson J. Persson B. BRICHOS-a superfamily of multidomain proteins with diverse functions.BMC Res. Notes. 2009; 2: 180Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 10Sánchez-Pulido L. Devos D. Valencia A.

Amyloid-forming proteins give rise to around 30 amyloid diseases, among them Alzheimer disease, prion diseases, and type II diabetes mellitus. Recently SP-C was added to the list of amyloid-forming proteins (11Sipe J.D. Benson M.D. Buxbaum J.N. Ikeda S. Merlini G. Saraiva M.J. Westermark P.

The TM α-helix of SP-C is discordant, i.e. it is predicted to form β-sheets, because it mainly consists of valine residues, which are strongly overrepresented in β-sheets. SP-C can convert into β-strand conformation and form amyloid-like fibrils (12Dluhy R.A. Shanmukh S. Leapard J.B. Krüger P. Baatz J.E.

It has been shown that patients with interstitial lung disease (ILD) due to mutations in the pro-SP-C gene have amyloid deposits of SP-C in the lung parenchyma (16Willander H. Askarieh G. Landreh M. Westermark P. Nordling K. Keränen H. Hermansson E. Hamvas A. Nogee L.M. Bergman T. Saenz A. Casals C. Åqvistg J. Jörnvall H. Berglund H. Presto J. Knight S.D. Johansson J.

U.S.A. 2012; 109: 2325-2329Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). There are about 50 such mutations, and the majority are located in the linker region (such as I73T mutation) and the BRICHOS domain (such as L188Q mutation). It was suggested that mutations that abrogate a chaperone-like function of the BRICHOS domain in pro-SP-C lead to misfolding of the SP-C TM segment (16Willander H. Askarieh G. Landreh M. Westermark P. Nordling K. Keränen H. Hermansson E. Hamvas A. Nogee L.M. Bergman T. Saenz A. Casals C. Åqvistg J. Jörnvall H. Berglund H. Presto J. Knight S.D. Johansson J.

U.S.A. 2012; 109: 2325-2329Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The first step in the folding of any TM protein, such as pro-SP-C, begins with the coordinated action of the ribosome-translocon complex. It has previously been shown that a model poly-Val segment is less efficient in forming an α-helix in the ribosome and ER translocon than a poly-Leu segment, which folds into an α-helix already in the ribosome (17Mingarro I. Nilsson I. Whitley P. von Heijne G. Different conformations of nascent polypeptides during translocation across the ER membrane.BMC Cell Biol. 2000; 1: 3Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Poly-Leu substitution for poly-Val in a synthetic analog of SP-C resulted in a dramatic increase in spontaneous formation of a stable α helix (14Kallberg Y. Gustafsson M. Persson B. Thyberg J. Johansson J. Prediction of amyloid fibril-forming proteins.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12945-12950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 18Johansson J. Some M. Linderholm B.M. Almlén A. Curstedt T. Robertson B.

Physiol. 2003; 95: 2055-2063Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In addition, expression in a cell line of pro-SP-C with a poly-Leu TM segment instead of the native poly-Val counterpart results in strong reduction of aggregation even in the presence of a non-functional BRICHOS domain carrying an ILD associated mutation (19Nerelius C. Martin E. Peng S. Gustafsson M. Nordling K. Weaver T. Johansson J. Mutations linked to interstitial lung disease can abrogate anti-amyloid function of prosurfactant protein C.Biochem. J. 2008; 416: 201-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The folding of the pro-SP-C TM segments is thus not only of interest in relationship to ILD associated with BRICHOS mutations and amyloid, but also in relationship to general determinants for folding of TM segments. We have previously proposed that folding of the pro-SP-C TM segment needs to be assisted by a BRICHOS domain, and that this involves capturing the unfolded TM segment in the ER membrane. In this model, binding of the BRICHOS domain to the unstructured poly-Val TM segment inhibits misfolding into a β-sheet, and promotes folding into an α-helix. Helix formation leads to release from the BRICHOS domain, and eventually the correctly folded helical TM region is inserted into the ER membrane (16Willander H. Askarieh G. Landreh M. Westermark P.

U.S.A. 2012; 109: 2325-2329Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Recent results suggest that the BRICHOS domain recognizes motif(s) common to amyloid formation of different peptides, thereby inhibiting formation of amyloid fibrils (20Johansson H. Nerelius C. Nordling K. Johansson J. Preventing amyloid formation by catching unfolded transmembrane segments.J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 389: 227-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Moreover, pro-SP-C BRICHOS has also proved to be very effective as a molecular chaperone against the Alzheimer disease-associated peptide Aβ, both in vitro (20Johansson H. Nerelius C. Nordling K.

Recently, pro-SP-C BRICHOS was found to specifically block the secondary nucleation step in Aβ fibril formation, with important implications for its ability to block amyloid toxicity (24Cohen S.I.

The amyloid deposits found in patients with ILD consist of SP-C peptide, but it has not been shown where or at what stage of SP-C biosynthesis these deposits are formed. Misfolding and aggregation may start already in the translocon and/or the ER membrane, and recent results support that the latter is the case for some, but not all, pro-SP-C mutations associated with ILD (25Stewart G.A. Ridsdale R. Martin E.P. Na C.L. Xu Y. Mandapaka K. Weaver T.E. 4-Phenylbutyric acid treatment rescues trafficking and processing of a mutant surfactant protein-C.Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2012; 47: 324-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Moreover, how the water-soluble BRICHOS domain manages to interact with the hydrophobic pro-SP-C TM segment in the membrane is not understood. We have previously reported that pro-SP-C BRICHOS binds to phospholipids and that the binding induces increased disorder in the BRICHOS structure (26Casals C. Johansson H. Saenz A. Gustafsson M. Alfonso C. Nordling K. Johansson J. C-terminal, endoplasmic reticulum-lumenal domain of prosurfactant protein C: structural features and membrane interactions.FEBS J. 2008; 275: 536-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Here we have used translocon-mediated in vitro translation and a minimal glycosylation distance assay to study folding of the pro-SP-C TM segment in the ER membrane, by measuring how efficiently native poly-Val and designed poly-Leu segments fold into compact, helical conformation. Moreover, we have also studied if the pro-SP-C BRICHOS domain inserts into the ER membrane. To this end we investigated the recombinant human WT pro-SP-C BRICHOS domain and two ILD-associated mutants thereof, pro-SP-C L188Q (mutation in the BRICHOS domain) and pro-SP-C I73T (mutation in the linker region), hereafter referred to as WT BRICHOS, L188Q, and I73T, respectively. We studied protein binding and insertion into biological membranes with different compositions (either in the absence or presence of poly-Val peptides) and how binding and/or insertion affects membrane and protein structural properties. Results show that the co-translational folding of the pro-SP-C poly-Val TM segment is inefficient, suggesting that the presence of the BRICHOS domain is necessary to promote the correct folding of SP-C, and that the BRICHOS domain inserts into superficial parts of the ER membrane. WT pro-SP-C BRICHOS (residues 59–197), L188Q, and I73T were expressed and purified as described previously (19Nerelius C. Martin E. Peng S. Gustafsson M. Nordling K. Weaver T. Johansson J.

Translation products were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and proteins were visualized in a Fuji FLA-3000 phosphorimager (Fujifilm, Tokyo) using the Image Reader V1.8J/Image Gauge version 3.45 software (Fujifilm). The MultiGauge (Fujifilm) software was used to generate a profile of each gel lane, and the multi-Gaussian fit program from the Qtiplot software package was used to calculate the peak areas of the non-glycosylated and glycosylated protein bands. The glycosylation efficiency of a given glycosylation site was calculated by dividing the area of the single glycosylated band by the summed areas of the glycosylated and non-glycosylated bands. The glycosylation efficiency of the double glycosylation was calculated by dividing the areas of the doubly glycosylated bands by the summed areas of the singly and doubly glycosylated bands. On average, the glycosylation levels vary by no more than ±5% between repeated experiments. Lung tissue from rat was excised and carefully washed with ice-cold 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.15 m KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithioerythritol, and 5% glycerol. A 20% homogenate was prepared in the same buffer and the microsomal fraction was obtained as previously described (32Casals C. Herrera L. Garcia-Barreno P. Municio A.M. Association of changes in lysophosphatidylcholine metabolism and in microsomal membrane lipid composition to the pulmonary injury induced by oleic acid.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1023: 290-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Microsomal pellets were resuspended in the same buffer and resedimented at 150,000 × g for 45 min. Microsomal membranes were used for lipid extraction and microsomal phospholipids were quantitated by phosphate analysis (32Casals C. Herrera L. Garcia-Barreno P. Municio A.M. Association of changes in lysophosphatidylcholine metabolism and in microsomal membrane lipid composition to the pulmonary injury induced by oleic acid.Biochim. Biophys.

Monolayer experiments were performed at 25 °C using a thermostated Langmuir-Blodgett trough (102 m micro Film Balance, NIMA Technologies, Coventry, United Kingdom) equipped with an injection port and magnetically stirred (33Sáenz A. López-Sánchez A. Mojica-Lázaro J. Martínez-Caro L. Nin N. Bagatolli L.A. Casals C. Fluidizing effects of C-reactive protein on lung surfactant membranes: protective role of surfactant protein A.FASEB J. 2010; 24: 3662-3673Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The trough is equipped with two symmetrical movable barriers controlled by an electronic device. The subphase employed was 5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) buffer containing 150 mm NaCl. For penetration studies, monolayers were formed by spreading 10 μl of a concentrated solution of lung microsomal lipids, synthetic phospholipids, or phospholipid/hydrophobic peptide mixtures (50:1, w/w) dissolved in chloroform/methanol (2:1) (v/v) at the air-water interface to give the indicated initial surface pressures (from 5 to 50 mN/m). After organic solvent evaporation, the monolayer was allowed to stabilize for a few minutes before 100 μl of a stock solution of WT BRICHOS, L188Q, or I73T was injected into the subphase without disturbing the lipid monolayer. Then, protein-induced changes in the monolayer surface pressure at constant surface area were measured. The final protein concentration in the subphase was 18.2 ng/ml (1 nm). Multilamellar vesicles (MLVs) and large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) were prepared as previously described (34Sáenz A. Cañadas O. Bagatolli L.A. Johnson M.E. Casals C. Physical"

The mortality rate and leading causes of death for children under 5 years of age were analyzed. The trend in the mortality rate for children under five and cause-specific mortality rates were analyzed by chi-square with SPSS 13.0 software.In Zhejiang Province, during 1997-2012, mortality rates in neonates, postneonatal infants, and children under 5 years were reduced by 64.2% (from 7.85 to 2.81 per 1000 livebirths), 66.7% (from 12.73 to 4.24 per 1000 livebirths), and 63% (from 15.76 to 5.85 per 1000 livebirths), respectively. The mortality rates in children under 5 years of age decreased by 59.5% (from 11.09 to 4.49 per 1000 livebirths) and 65.8% (from 19.30 to 6.61 per 1000 livebirths) in urban and rural areas, respectively. Prematurity/low birth weight and congenital heart disease were in the top five causes of death in children under 5 years of age during 1997-2012.Zhejiang province has achieved great progress in the reduction of mortality rates in children under five-years-old during the past two decades. The future tasks on reduction of mortality rate still rely on how to improve the management of premature birth/low birth weight, reduce birth defects and prevent accidental deaths in Zhejiang Province."
https://openalex.org/W646224082,"Global competition for high standard feed-food resources between man and livestock, such as industrial broilers, is a concerning problem. In addition, the low productivity of scavenger chickens in developing countries leaves much to be desired. Changing the ingredients, and therefore, the nutrient composition of feed intake by commercial fed as well as scavenger chickens seems like an obvious solution. In this study, the ability of four broiler chicken breeds to perform on a commercial versus a scavenger diet was tested. The four broiler breeds differed genetically in growth potential. A significant (P < 0.01) negative effect of the scavenger diet on the bodyweight of the fast growing breeds was found and this effect decreased with decreasing growth rate in the other breeds. These differences in bodyweight gain could not be explained by differences in nutrient digestibility but were caused by the lack of ability of the fast growing breeds to increase their feed intake sufficiently."
https://openalex.org/W1524740964,"Macrophage proliferation and migration are important for many facets of immune response. Here we showed that stimulation of macrophages with type B CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG-B ODNs) such as CpG-ODN 1668 increased the production of anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin 1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) in a TLR9- and MyD88-dependent manner. The CpG-B ODNs-induced IL-1Ra increased macrophage migration and promoted macrophage proliferation by down-regulating the expression of a cell cycle negative regulator, p27 to increase cell population in the S phase. The induction of IL-1Ra by CpG-B ODNs was F-spondin dependent. Knockdown of F-spondin and IL-1Ra decreased CpG-B ODNs-induced macrophage migration whereas overexpression of IL-1Ra increased migration of those cells. These findings demonstrated novel roles for F-spondin and IL-1Ra in CpG-B ODNs-mediated cell proliferation and migration of macrophages."
https://openalex.org/W2138401399,"Occupational hearing loss is an increasingly prevalent occupational condition worldwide, and has been reported to occur in a wide range of workplaces; however, its prevalence among workers from municipal solid waste landfills (MSWLs) remains less clear. This study aimed to investigate the occupational hearing loss among Chinese MSWL workers.A cross-sectional study of 247 workers from 4 Chinese MSWLs was conducted. Noise and total volatile organic compounds (TVOCs) levels at worksites were determined. We conducted hearing examinations to determine hearing thresholds. A worker was identified as having hearing loss if the mean threshold at 2000, 3000 and 4000 Hz in either ear was equal to or greater than 25 dB. Prevalence of occupational hearing loss was then evaluated. Using unconditional Logistic regression models, we estimated the odds ratios (ORs) of MSWL work associated with hearing loss.According to the job title for each worker, the study subjects were divided into 3 groups, including group 1 of 63 workers without MSWL occupational hazards exposure (control group), group 2 of 84 workers with a few or short-period MSWL occupational hazards exposure, and group 3 of 100 workers with continuous MSWL occupational hazards exposure. Both noise and TVOCs levels were significantly higher at worksites for group 3. Significantly poorer hearing thresholds at frequencies of 2000, 3000 and 4000 Hz were found in group 3, compared with that in group 1 and group 2. The overall prevalence rate of hearing loss was 23.5%, with the highest in group 3 (36.0%). The OR of MSWL work associated with hearing loss was 3.39 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.28-8.96).The results of this study suggest significantly higher prevalence of hearing loss among MSWL workers. Further studies are needed to explore possible exposure-response relationship between MSWL occupational hazards exposure and hearing loss."
https://openalex.org/W1562072174,"We describe a novel insulin-degrading enzyme, SidC, that contributes to the proliferation of the human bacterial pathogen Vibrio vulnificus in a mouse model. SidC is phylogenetically distinct from other known insulin-degrading enzymes and is expressed and secreted specifically during host infection. Purified SidC causes a significant decrease in serum insulin levels and an increase in blood glucose levels in mice. A comparison of mice infected with wild type V. vulnificus or an isogenic sidC-deletion strain showed that wild type bacteria proliferated to higher levels. Additionally, hyperglycemia leads to increased proliferation of V. vulnificus in diabetic mice. Consistent with these observations, the sid operon was up-regulated in response to low glucose levels through binding of the cAMP-receptor protein (CRP) complex to a region upstream of the operon. We conclude that glucose levels are important for the survival of V. vulnificus in the host, and that this pathogen uses SidC to actively manipulate host endocrine signals, making the host environment more favorable for bacterial survival and growth.

Pathogens have evolved elaborate ways to survive and thrive within their hosts to improve their own chance for survival. Elucidation of the mechanisms behind such strategies can be an important step in defining targets for the development of novel antibacterial drugs. Little is known about the ways in which pathogens are able to utilize host catabolic substrates, and although there is a plethora of information about how pathogens modify host proteins, to our knowledge, little is known about bacterial modification of endocrine signals, including insulin. Vibrio vulnificus causes infection when contaminated seafood is consumed or when it invades an open wound, and this infection can often lead to fatal septicemia in people who are immunocompromised or have an underlying condition such as liver disease, alcoholism, or diabetes mellitus (1Horseman M.A. Surani S.

However, it is clear that the disease elicited by this pathogen requires the complex interaction of numerous factors, including many yet to be identified. The existence of an insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) 2The abbreviations used are: IDEinsulin-degrading enzymeCRPcAMP-receptor proteinIPGTTintraperitoneal glucose tolerance testOGTToral glucose tolerance testTPENN,N,N′,N′-tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl)ethylenediamine. in human that plays a role in insulin turnover in tissues was suggested as early as the 1940s (4Mirsky I.A. Broh-Kahn R.H. The inactivation of insulin by tissue extracts; the distribution and properties of insulin inactivating extracts.Arch. Biochem. 1949; 20: 1-9PubMed Google Scholar). However, attempts to identify and characterize IDEs were not successful because of its low concentration and poor stability (5Duckworth W.C. Bennett R.G. Hamel F.G. Insulin degradation: progress and potential.Endocr. Rev. 1998; 19: 608-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). In addition to insulin, glucagon, β-endorphin, insulin-like growth factors I and II, and amyloid-β have also been reported as substrates for IDEs (5Duckworth W.C. Bennett R.G. Hamel F.G. Insulin degradation: progress and potential.Endocr. Rev. 1998; 19: 608-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar, 6Haque R. Nazir A. Insulin-degrading enzyme: a link between Alzheimer's and type 2 diabetes mellitus.CNS Neurol. Disord. Drug Targets. 2014; 13: 259-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Recently, IDE has attracted attention for its role in type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer disease, but additional studies are needed (6Haque R. Nazir A. Insulin-degrading enzyme: a link between Alzheimer's and type 2 diabetes mellitus.CNS Neurol. Disord. Drug Targets. 2014; 13: 259-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). A homologous bacterial protein was discovered in Escherichia coli, and the enzyme, called pitrilysin (or protease III), has a specificity for small substrates and is able to degrade both insulin and peptides smaller than 7 kDa (7Cheng Y.S. Zipser D. Purification and characterization of protease III from Escherichia coli.J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 4698-4706Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Pitrilysin is localized within the periplasmic space (8Swamy K.H. Goldberg A.L. Subcellular distribution of various proteases in Escherichia coli.J. Bacteriol. 1982; 149: 1027-1033Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This enzyme, like other IDEs, has an unusual metal-binding motif (HXXEH) characteristic of the inverzincin family of zinc metalloproteases (9Becker A.B. Roth R.A.

Families of zinc metalloproteases.FEBS Lett. 1994; 354: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). Biochemical properties such as substrate specificity, enzyme kinetics, and metal stoichiometry have been studied (12Anastasi A. Knight C.G. Barrett A.J. Characterization of the bacterial metalloendopeptidase pitrilysin by use of a continuous fluorescence assay.Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 601-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar); however, no obvious phenotypic deficiencies were observed in pitrilysin-deficient E. coli mutants (13Dykstra C.C. Kushner S.R. Physical characterization of the cloned protease III gene from Escherichia coli K-12.J. Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 1055-1059Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and not much is known about the physiological functions of this enzyme in bacteria. IDE homologs are highly conserved between bacteria and mammals and, in bacteria, they are localized to the cytosol, the plasma membrane, or the periplasm (5Duckworth W.C. Bennett R.G. Hamel F.G. Insulin degradation: progress and potential.Endocr. Rev. 1998; 19: 608-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar).

Open table in a new tab A DNA fragment encoding 938 amino acids of SidC without an amino-terminal signal peptide region was amplified by PCR using the primers sid-OEF and sid-OEB (Table 2) and the product was subcloned into the pASK-IBA3 vector (IBA BioTAGnology, Göttingen, Germany). The resulting vector pASK-SidC was transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3). Expression of SidC with a Strep-tag at the carboxyl terminus was induced with 0.2 μg/ml of anhydrotetracycline. After centrifugation, the bacterial pellets were suspended in buffer W (100 mm Tris-Cl, 150 mm NaCl), sonicated, and centrifuged at 7,000 rpm for 10 min. The resulting supernatant was passed through Strep-Tactin® affinity resin (IBA BioTAGnology, Göttingen, Germany) and bound protein was eluted using buffer E (100 mm Tris-Cl, 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm desthiobiotin) according to the manufacturer's protocol. CRP was purified using a similar strategy. A DNA fragment encoding 310 amino acids of CRP was amplified by PCR using the primers crp-OEF and crp-OEB (Table 2). The amplified PCR product was cloned into pASK-IBA3. The resulting plasmid pASK-CRP, which encodes CRP fused to a Strep-tag at the C terminus, was expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) as described above. The purified SidC and CRP proteins were dialyzed and concentrated with buffer S (50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol) and with buffer WG (buffer W with 30% glycerol) using an Ultracell®-30K centricon (Millipore, MA), respectively. To construct a V. vulnificus strain overexpressing SidC, a 3,076-bp DNA fragment of sidC was amplified by PCR using primers sid-comp-F1 and sid-comp-R1 (Table 2) and the resulting product was cloned behind the lac promoter in the vector pRK415 using HindIII and XbaI sites to generated pRK-sidC. The resulting construct was introduced into V. vulnificus strains.TABLE 2Primers used in this studyPurpose/nameNucleotide sequence (5′ to 3′)aNucleotides modified for the generation of restriction sites or for site-directed mutagenesis are underlined.Cloning of sidC and crp sid-OEFGACCGCGGTCCCGAATTCATGGGTTGTTCTTCCGTAAAATCG sid-OEBACCATGGTCCCCCTGCAGTCGGATGATTTCAAGCTCTTC crp-OEFATCCCTCGAGGTCGACATGGTTCTAGGTAAACCTC crp-OEBCCCCCTGCAGGTCGACACGAGTACGTAAACAACG sid-comp-F1AAGCTTGCTTATCGCACTGGG sid-comp-R1TCTAGACAGAAGCTTGCAGCGTC crp-FGGGCTGCAGGAATTCAAAACTCAGCACGGAGAGCG crp-BCTTGATATCGAATTCTTAATGGAAATTAACGAGTACConstruction of a luxAB fusion sid-pro-F1GGTACCGCGGCGCGTGTGGTGAATAA sid-pro-B1GGATCCCAGGGCCACCAAATTCTGTAConstruction of a sidC in-frame deletion mutant sid-KO-F1GTGAAGGGCCCAAACTTCTCGGGTTTG sid-KO-B1AGAGGTACCCCTTCTGGTAATGAAG sid-KO-F2GGTGGTACCCGAATGACTATCAGAT sid-KO-B2TTGGAGCTCATCTTCTGTTTGCTCACSite-directed mutagenesis sid-mtF1GCGGCCGCGGGAATTCGTGCTGATGGCGAAGCTACTC sid-mtB1TGGCCACAATGATGTGGCCTGACTGACAATTCACAG CG sid-mtF2GGCCACATCATTGTGGCCAACTTCGGTTAACAAAATG sid-mtB2AGGCGGCCGCGAATTCCGCGTTCTCACCACAACTGElectrophoresis mobility shift assay sid-FTGGTGAATAAAGTGGGCTTAG sid-BCACGCGTTTTAACATCGATAGa Nucleotides modified for the generation of restriction sites or for site-directed mutagenesis are underlined. Open table in a new tab Overnight cultures of the V. vulnificus strains were subcultured into fresh brain heart infusion broth (Difco, BD Biosciences, NJ) and cells and supernatants were separated by centrifugation when the A600 value of the culture reached ∼2.2. The supernatant was filtered by passing the culture through a 0.22-μm syringe filter (Millipore, MA), and was concentrated using Ultracell®-30K centricon (Millipore, MA). Fractionation of different cell compartments of V. vulnificus was carried out as described previously (16Sikora A.E. Lybarger S.R. Sandkvist M. Compromised outer membrane integrity in Vibrio cholerae Type II secretion mutants.J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 8484-8495Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). After obtaining each fraction, the same volume of each subcellular fraction was separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a Hybond-P membrane (GE Healthcare). The membrane was incubated with polyclonal rat antiserum against purified SidC (1:1,000 dilution in blocking solution), and subsequently incubated with goat anti-rat immunoglobulin-G-AP (1:2000) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). SidC was visualized using the 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium color development substrate (Promega, WI). Alkaline phosphatase activity was measured quantitatively as described previously (16Sikora A.E. Lybarger S.R. Sandkvist M. Compromised outer membrane integrity in Vibrio cholerae Type II secretion mutants.J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 8484-8495Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Purified SidC (0.05–1 μm) was incubated with 20 μg of recombinant human insulin or other substrates (glucagon, TGF-α, IGF1, and IGF2, Sigma) in reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5) for 2 h at 37 ºC and then separated by 20% SDS-PAGE. To test the effectiveness of protease inhibitors, either EDTA or TPEN at a final concentration of 5 mm was added. The reaction was terminated by boiling the mixture in 1× SDS-PAGE loading buffer containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol. The reaction mixtures were loaded onto a 20% SDS-PAGE gel and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. To identify cleavage sites of insulin digested by SidC, 300 μg of recombinant human insulin was incubated with 30 μm SidC in reaction buffer for 6 h at 37 ºC and then analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) using an UltiMate 3000 HPLC system (Dionex) and a MicroQ-TOF III mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics, 255748, Germany) at PROTEINWORKS Inc. (Daejeon, Korea). The chromatography was performed with solvent A (0.2% fluoroacetic acid in water) and solvent B (0.2% fluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile) on an Acclaim RSLC 120 C18 column (2.1 × 100 mm, 2.2 μm, Dionex) at a flow rate 200 μl/min. The capillary temperature of mass spectrometer was 180 °C. The upstream region (−257 to +43, with respect to the translational start site) of the sid operon was amplified by PCR using primers sid-pro-F1 and sid-pro-B1 (Table 2), and cloned into the pGEM-T easy vector (Promega). The resulting plasmid was digested with KpnI and BamHI and cloned into pHK0011 (Table 1) to generate pPsid-lux, in which the promoter region of the sid operon is fused to luxAB. To construct an in-frame sidC deletion mutant, a 771-bp DNA fragment comprising the upstream region, and a 773-bp DNA fragment comprising the downstream region of the sidC were amplified using primers sid-KO-F1 and sid-KO-B1 and primers sid-KO-F2 and sid-KO-B2 (Table 2), respectively. Each fragment was digested with the restriction enzyme KpnI, and ligated with pGEM-T Easy vector. The resulting plasmids were digested by ApaI and SacI, and cloned into the pDM4 vector (Table 1) to generate pDM4-sidKO, which was then introduced into V. vulnificus MO6–24/O by conjugation. Double crossover selection to construct a deletion of sidC in the chromosome was performed as described previously (17Kim I.H. Wen Y. Son J.S. Lee K.H. Kim K.S. The Fur-iron complex modulates expression of the quorum-sensing master regulator, SmcR, to control expression of virulence factors in Vibrio vulnificus.Infect. Immun. 2013; 81: 2888-2898Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The resulting strain was named ΔsidC. The amount of insulin secreted by INS-1 cells was measured. Cells were preincubated in KRBB buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 115 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 25 mm NaHCO3) containing 0.5% BSA for 3 h and stimulated with either 3 (LG) or 15 mm glucose (HG), with or without SidC, for an additional hour as described (18Ryu D. Seo W.Y. Yoon Y.S. Kim Y.N. Kim S.S. Kim H.J. Park T.S. Choi C.S. Koo S.H. Endoplasmic reticulum stress promotes LIPIN2-dependent hepatic insulin resistance.Diabetes. 2011; 60: 1072-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Cytotoxicity assays were performed using the CytoTox96® Non-radioactive Cytotoxicity assay kit (Promega). Briefly, HepG2 was seeded at 2 × 105 cells per well into 24-well culture plates and grown overnight in DMEM at 37 °C in the presence 5% CO2. Zero, 1, and 2 μm SidC were added to HepG2, incubated for 1–2 h, then cytotoxicity was determined by measuring the level of released lactic dehydrogenase according to the manufacturer's protocol. C57BLKS and db/db mice were purchased from DBL (Korea), and ICR (CD-1) mice were purchased from Orient Bio Inc. (Korea). All mice used to assess the effects of SidC were fasted for 16 h before the experiment and only water was provided. For the intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (IPGTT), db/db mice were injected intraperitoneally with glucose (1 g/kg of body weight) along with 100 μl of either the concentration buffer alone or 1.6 μm SidC per mouse. Blood was drawn from the tail vein at the designated times and was used to detect glucose and insulin levels as described previously (18Ryu D. Seo W.Y. Yoon Y.S. Kim Y.N. Kim S.S. Kim H.J. Park T.S. Choi C.S. Koo S.H. Endoplasmic reticulum stress promotes LIPIN2-dependent hepatic insulin resistance.Diabetes. 2011; 60: 1072-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). To determine the effect on insulin and glucose levels in the host after infection of vibrio strains, wild type V. vulnificus MO6–24/O, ΔsidC, MO6–24/O (pRK-sidC), and Δcrr (pRK-sidC) cells were cultured overnight in LB medium and subcultured into fresh LB broth. When the culture reached a cell density (A600) of ∼0.7, the cells were harvested, washed twice, and then diluted to the same cell density using phosphate-buffered saline (PBS: 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, and 2 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4). V. vulnificus cells (about 107 colony forming units) were subcutaneously injected into mice. At 2-h time points after injection of V. vulnificus strains, the mice were administered filter-sterilized glucose (1.5 g/kg body weight) orally. Blood samples were collected from the heart at time points after the V. vulnificus injection. The blood glucose level was measured immediately using Accu-check® Performa (Roche Diagnostics). To determine the level of proliferation of the strains within the host, the number of viable cells present in the blood was measured as follows. A blood sample was diluted in PBS and the diluted samples were then spread onto LBS agar (LB agar with 2% NaCl) in duplicate. The rest of the blood sample was incubated at 4 ºC for coagulation and centrifuged for serum separation. Insulin levels were determined in serum using an Ultrasensitive EIA kit (Alpco Diagnostics, NH) as per the manufacturer's instructions. The results were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 5. The 886-bp DNA fragment comprising the promoter region and the coding region of the crp was amplified by PCR using the primers crp-F and crp-B (Table 2). The resulting product was cloned into pBBR1-MCS2 (Table 1) to construct pBBR1-crp. Plasmids pBBR1-MCS2 and pBBR1-crp were conjugated into wild type V. vulnificus MO6–24/O and the Δcrp strain (19Jeong H.S. Jeong K.C. Choi H.K. Park K.J. Lee K.H. Rhee J.H. Choi S.H. Differential expression of Vibrio vulnificus elastase gene in a growth phase-dependent manner by two different types of promoters.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13875-13880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Overnight cultures of V. vulnificus strains were inoculated into appropriate medium. Samples were diluted 125-fold with PBS. After adding 0.006% (v/v) n-decylaldehyde, luminescence was measured using a luminometer (Lumat LB 9507, Berthold Technologies, Bad Wildbad, Germany). Specific transcriptional levels were expressed as light units normalized to cell density (relative light units), as described previously (20Lee H.J. Lee K.H. Identification of the fur-binding site in regulatory region of the vulnibactin-receptor gene in Vibrio vulnificus.J. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2012; 22: 46-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). A 395-bp DNA fragment of the upstream region of the sid operon (−247 to +148, with respect to the translation start site) was amplified by PCR using primers sid-F and 32P-labeled sid-B (Table 2). For the gel shift assay, 5 ng of the labeled probe was incubated with increasing amounts of purified CRP protein (0 to 400 nm) in a 20-μl reaction in the binding buffer containing 10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 75 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), and 1 mm cyclic AMP (cAMP) for 30 min at 37 °C. The binding mixtures were resolved on a 5% neutral polyacrylamide gel after addition of 5% glycerol. Gels were exposed to a BAS-MP 2040s IP plate (Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan) and scanned by BAS-1500 (Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan). For site-directed mutagenesis of the CRP binding site, the 266-bp DNA fragment (−344 to −78, with respect to the translation start site) and 343-bp DNA fragment (−97 to +246, with respect to the translation start site) of the sid upstream region were amplified by PCR using primers sid-mtF1 and sid-mtB1 and primers sid-mtF2 and sid-mtB2 (Table 2). The resulting products were cloned into the pGEM-T easy vector (Promega) to generate pGEM-sidA-crpmt using the In-fusion® HD cloning kit (Clontech Laboratories, Takara Bio Inc., Shiga, Japan). The region upstream to sidA (−257 to +43, with respect to the translation start site) containing the mutagenized CRP binding site was amplified by PCR from pGEM-sidA-crpmt using primers sid-pro-F1 and sid-pro-B1, and then cloned into pHK0011 as described above. The resulting plasmid was named pPsidmt-lux, in which the region upstream to the sid operon with a mutation at the CRP-binding site is transcriptionally fused to luxAB, and was conjugated into V. vulnificus strains. Serum was obtained from ICR mice infected with wild type V. vulnificus MO6–24/O and the ΔsidC strain. Levels of cytokines were semi-quantitatively determined using a mouse cytokine antibody array C3 kit (RayBiotech, Inc.) following the manufacturer's instructions. The results were analyzed using a GelQuant Pro v13 (DNR/Bio-Imaging Systems Ltd., Israel). To adapt and survive within the host, V. vulnificus generates factors to manipulate the physiological status of the host, making the host environment favorable for its own survival. We took two approaches to identify novel virulence factors in V. vulnificus: transcriptomic comparisons of V. vulnificus isolates with different pathogenic potencies (21Kim I.H. Kim B.S. Lee K.S. Kim I.J. Son J.S. Kim K.S. Identification of virulence factors in Vibrio vulnificus by comparative transcriptomic analyses between clinical and environmental isolates using cDNA microarray.J. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2011; 21: 1228-1235Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) and in vivo expression technology (22Mahan M.J. Slauch J.M. Mekalanos J.J.

Kim K.S. lacZ-and aph-based reporter vectors for in vivo expression technology.J. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2003; 13: 872-880Google Scholar) to identify genes that were expressed at higher levels in a mouse model than in vitro (24Lee K.E. Bang J.S. Baek C.H. Park D.K. Hwang W. Choi S.H. Kim K.S. IVET-based identification of virulence factors in Vibrio vulnificus MO6–24/O.J. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2007; 17: 234-243PubMed Google Scholar). From these two independent methods, a putative insulin-degrading enzyme with the conventional N-terminal secretory signal peptide was identified (annotated as: VVMO6_00510 for strain MO6–24/O (accession number YP_004187735)). Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence of this gene using the Blastx database in NCBI showed that there is a conventional signal leader sequence at the amino terminus. This protein also contains the inverted zinc-binding motif that is typical to IDEs (data not shown). Because both of these methods identified a specific protease with putative insulin-degrading activity, we hypothesized that this enzyme would be expressed preferentially within the host and therefore, may be important for survival and pathogenicity of V. vulnificus. VVMO6_00510 is encoded by the third gene in an operon that also includes genes encoding VVMO6_00508 (a putative NADPH:quinone reductase) and VVMO6_00509 (a hypothetical protein). We named the three genes in this operon sidABC for secreted-insulin degrading enzyme. The sidA and sidB genes have no detectable effect on the expression or function of SidC (data not shown). To gain insight into the role of SidC in the host and its role in the survival of V. vulnificus, we compared the survival of wild type V. vulnificus (MO6–24/O), a sidC knock-out strain (ΔsidC)"

https://openalex.org/W1561584269,"For the development of ""medical foods"" and/or botanical drugs as defined USA FDA, clear and systemic characterizations of the taxonomy, index phytochemical components, and the functional or medicinal bioactivities of the reputed or candidate medicinal plant are needed. In this study, we used an integrative approach, including macroscopic and microscopic examination, marker gene analysis, and chemical fingerprinting, to authenticate and validate various species/varieties of Wedelia, a reputed medicinal plant that grows naturally and commonly used in Asian countries. The anti-inflammatory bioactivities of Wedelia extracts were then evaluated in a DSS-induced murine colitis model. Different species/varieties of Wedelia exhibited distinguishable morphology and histological structures. Analysis of the ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region revealed significant differences among these plants. Chemical profiling of test Wedelia species demonstrated candidate index compounds and distinguishable secondary metabolites, such as caffeic acid derivatives, which may serve as phytochemical markers or index for quality control and identification of specific Wedelia species. In assessing their effect on treating DSS induced-murine colitis, we observed that only the phytoextract from W. chinensis species exhibited significant anti-inflammatory bioactivity on DSS-induced murine colitis among the various Wedelia species commonly found in Taiwan. Our results provide a translational research approach that may serve as a useful reference platform for biotechnological applications of traditional phytomedicines. Our findings indicate that specific Wedelia species warrant further investigation for potential treatment of human inflammatory bowel disease."
https://openalex.org/W631993669,"Libraries of randomised peptides displayed on phages or viral particles are essential tools in a wide spectrum of applications. However, there is only limited understanding of a library's fundamental dynamics and the influences of encoding schemes and sizes on their quality. Numeric properties of libraries, such as the expected number of different peptides and the library's coverage, have long been in use as measures of a library's quality. Here, we present a graphical framework of these measures together with a library's relative efficiency to help to describe libraries in enough detail for researchers to plan new experiments in a more informed manner. In particular, these values allow us to answer-in a probabilistic fashion-the question of whether a specific library does indeed contain one of the ""best"" possible peptides. The framework is implemented in a web-interface based on two packages, discreteRV and peptider, to the statistical software environment R. We further provide a user-friendly web-interface called PeLiCa (Peptide Library Calculator, http://www.pelica.org), allowing scientists to plan and analyse their peptide libraries."
https://openalex.org/W2123985147,"The activated transcription factor NF-κB shuttles between the cytoplasm and the nucleus resulting in the oscillation of nuclear NF-κB (NF-κBn). The oscillation pattern of NF-κBn is implicated in the regulation of gene expression profiles. Using computational models, we previously reported that spatial parameters, such as the diffusion coefficient, nuclear to cytoplasmic volume ratio, transport through the nuclear envelope, and the loci of translation of IκB protein, modified the oscillation pattern of NF-κBn. In a subsequent report, we elucidated the importance of the “reset” of NF-κBn (returning of NF-κB to the original level) and of a “reservoir” of IκB in the cytoplasm. When the diffusion coefficient of IκB was large, IκB stored at a distant location from the nucleus diffused back to the nucleus and “reset” NF-κBn. Herein, we report mechanisms that regulate the persistency and frequency of NF-κBn oscillation by nuclear transport. Among the four parameters of nuclear transport tested in our spatio-temporal computational model, the export of IκB mRNA from the nucleus regulated the persistency of oscillation. The import of IκB to the nucleus regulated the frequency of oscillation. The remaining two parameters, import and export of NF-κB to and from the nucleus, had virtually no effect on the persistency or frequency. Our analyses revealed that lesser export of IκB mRNA allowed NF-κBn to transcript greater amounts of IκB mRNA, which was retained in the nucleus, and was subsequently exported to the cytoplasm, where large amounts of IκB were synthesized to “reset” NF-κBn and drove the persistent oscillation. On the other hand, import of greater amounts of IκB led to an increase in the influx and the efflux of NF-κB to and from the nucleus, resulting in an increase in the oscillation frequency. Our study revealed the importance of nuclear transport in regulating the oscillation pattern of NF-κBn."
