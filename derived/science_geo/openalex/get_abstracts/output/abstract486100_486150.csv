https://openalex.org/W2070491781,"Bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) has a band structure that is well-suited for potential use as a photoanode in solar water splitting, but it suffers from poor electron-hole separation. Here, we demonstrate that a nanoporous morphology (specific surface area of 31.8 square meters per gram) effectively suppresses bulk carrier recombination without additional doping, manifesting an electron-hole separation yield of 0.90 at 1.23 volts (V) versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). We enhanced the propensity for surface-reaching holes to instigate water-splitting chemistry by serially applying two different oxygen evolution catalyst (OEC) layers, FeOOH and NiOOH, which reduces interface recombination at the BiVO4/OEC junction while creating a more favorable Helmholtz layer potential drop at the OEC/electrolyte junction. The resulting BiVO4/FeOOH/NiOOH photoanode achieves a photocurrent density of 2.73 milliamps per square centimenter at a potential as low as 0.6 V versus RHE."
https://openalex.org/W2060607801,"mTORC1 promotes cell growth in response to nutrients and growth factors. Insulin activates mTORC1 through the PI3K-Akt pathway, which inhibits the TSC1-TSC2-TBC1D7 complex (the TSC complex) to turn on Rheb, an essential activator of mTORC1. However, the mechanistic basis of how this pathway integrates with nutrient-sensing pathways is unknown. We demonstrate that insulin stimulates acute dissociation of the TSC complex from the lysosomal surface, where subpopulations of Rheb and mTORC1 reside. The TSC complex associates with the lysosome in a Rheb-dependent manner, and its dissociation in response to insulin requires Akt-mediated TSC2 phosphorylation. Loss of the PTEN tumor suppressor results in constitutive activation of mTORC1 through the Akt-dependent dissociation of the TSC complex from the lysosome. These findings provide a unifying mechanism by which independent pathways affecting the spatial recruitment of mTORC1 and the TSC complex to Rheb at the lysosomal surface serve to integrate diverse growth signals."
https://openalex.org/W2093478636,"Environmental DNA (eDNA) monitoring is a novel molecular technique to detect species in natural habitats. Many eDNA studies in aquatic systems have focused on lake or ponds, and/or on large vertebrate species, but applications to invertebrates in river systems are emerging. A challenge in applying eDNA monitoring in flowing waters is that a species' DNA can be transported downstream. Whether and how far eDNA can be detected due to downstream transport remains largely unknown. In this study we tested for downstream detection of eDNA for two invertebrate species, Daphnia longispina and Unio tumidus, which are lake dwelling species in our study area. The goal was to determine how far away from the source population in a lake their eDNA could be detected in an outflowing river. We sampled water from eleven river sites in regular intervals up to 12.3 km downstream of the lake, developed new eDNA probes for both species, and used a standard PCR and Sanger sequencing detection method to confirm presence of each species' eDNA in the river. We detected D. longispina at all locations and across two time points (July and October); whereas with U. tumidus, we observed a decreased detection rate and did not detect its eDNA after 9.1 km. We also observed a difference in detection for this species at different times of year. The observed movement of eDNA from the source amounting to nearly 10 km for these species indicates that the resolution of an eDNA sample can be large in river systems. Our results indicate that there may be species' specific transport distances for eDNA and demonstrate for the first time that invertebrate eDNA can persist over relatively large distances in a natural river system."
https://openalex.org/W2134443544,"The clinical benefit conferred by vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGF)-targeted therapies is variable, and tumors from treated patients eventually reinitiate growth. Here, we identify a glycosylation-dependent pathway that compensates for the absence of cognate ligand and preserves angiogenesis in response to VEGF blockade. Remodeling of the endothelial cell (EC) surface glycome selectively regulated binding of galectin-1 (Gal1), which upon recognition of complex N-glycans on VEGFR2, activated VEGF-like signaling. Vessels within anti-VEGF-sensitive tumors exhibited high levels of α2-6-linked sialic acid, which prevented Gal1 binding. In contrast, anti-VEGF refractory tumors secreted increased Gal1 and their associated vasculature displayed glycosylation patterns that facilitated Gal1-EC interactions. Interruption of β1-6GlcNAc branching in ECs or silencing of tumor-derived Gal1 converted refractory into anti-VEGF-sensitive tumors, whereas elimination of α2-6-linked sialic acid conferred resistance to anti-VEGF. Disruption of the Gal1-N-glycan axis promoted vascular remodeling, immune cell influx and tumor growth inhibition. Thus, targeting glycosylation-dependent lectin-receptor interactions may increase the efficacy of anti-VEGF treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2130789889,"Cancer is believed to arise primarily through accumulation of genetic mutations. Although induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) generation does not require changes in genomic sequence, iPSCs acquire unlimited growth potential, a characteristic shared with cancer cells. Here, we describe a murine system in which reprogramming factor expression in vivo can be controlled temporally with doxycycline (Dox). Notably, transient expression of reprogramming factors in vivo results in tumor development in various tissues consisting of undifferentiated dysplastic cells exhibiting global changes in DNA methylation patterns. The Dox-withdrawn tumors arising in the kidney share a number of characteristics with Wilms tumor, a common pediatric kidney cancer. We also demonstrate that iPSCs derived from Dox-withdrawn kidney tumor cells give rise to nonneoplastic kidney cells in mice, proving that they have not undergone irreversible genetic transformation. These findings suggest that epigenetic regulation associated with iPSC derivation may drive development of particular types of cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2086292277,"TOR complex 1 (TORC1) is a potent anabolic regulator of cellular growth and metabolism. When cells have sufficient amino acids, TORC1 is active due to its lysosomal localization mediated via the Rag GTPases. Upon amino acid removal, the Rag GTPases release TORC1, causing it to become cytoplasmic and inactive. We show here that, upon amino acid removal, the Rag GTPases also recruit TSC2 to the lysosome, where it can act on Rheb. Only when both the Rag GTPases and Rheb are inactive is TORC1 fully released from the lysosome. Upon amino acid withdrawal, cells lacking TSC2 fail to completely release TORC1 from the lysosome, fail to completely inactivate TORC1, and fail to adjust physiologically to amino acid starvation. These data suggest that regulation of TSC2 subcellular localization may be a general mechanism to control its activity and place TSC2 in the amino-acid-sensing pathway to TORC1."

Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common of all arthropathies and is a leading cause of disability with a large socioeconomic cost. To date, however, no effective disease-modifying therapies for OA have been developed. OA is primarily characterized by cartilage destruction but also involves other pathological changes, including synovial inflammation, osteophyte formation, and subchondral bone sclerosis, in all tissues of joints (Bian et al., 2012Bian Q.

Post-traumatic osteoarthritis: from mouse models to clinical trials.Nat. Rev. Rheumatol. 2013; 9: 485-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). OA pathogenesis is caused by an imbalance between anabolic and catabolic factors. A variety of etiologic risk factors and pathophysiological processes contribute to the progressive nature of the disease. Important among potential OA-causing mechanisms are mechanical stresses, including joint instability and injury, and factors that predispose toward OA, such as aging. These factors lead to the activation of biochemical pathways in chondrocytes that result in degradation of the extracellular matrix by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and aggrecanases (ADAMTSs). Among matrix-degrading enzymes, MMP3, MMP13, and ADAMTS5 are known to play crucial roles in OA cartilage destruction (Blom et al., 2007Blom A.B. van Lent P.L. Libregts S.

Matrix-degrading enzymes require zinc (Zn2+) as a structural component (Page-McCaw et al., 2007Page-McCaw A. Ewald A.J. Werb Z. Matrix metalloproteinases and the regulation of tissue remodelling.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 221-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (2185) Google Scholar). Indeed, Zn2+ acts as an activator or coactivator of a variety of proteins by providing a structural scaffold, for example in the form of zinc fingers and zinc clusters (Prasad, 1995Prasad A.S. Zinc: an overview.Nutrition. 1995; 11: 93-99PubMed Google Scholar). Zn2+ is also found in the cytoplasm and intracellular compartments in a labile form, and changes in these Zn2+ levels affect various cellular functions. In fact, an imbalance in Zn2+ homeostasis is linked to abnormal embryonic development, immune dysfunction, neurological problems, and increased mortality and disease (Fukada et al., 2011Fukada T. Yamasaki S. Nishida K. Murakami M. Hirano T. Zinc homeostasis and signaling in health and diseases: Zinc signaling.J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2011; 16: 1123-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Zn2+ may also be overtly toxic when accumulated in excess in cells. Therefore, normal cell functioning requires tight regulation of Zn2+ homeostasis. Zn2+ homeostasis is primarily regulated by membrane Zn2+ transporters of the Slc30a family (ZNT) of exporters and Slc39a family (ZIP) of importers (Cousins et al., 2006Cousins R.J. Liuzzi J.P. Lichten L.A. Mammalian zinc transport, trafficking, and signals.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 24085-24089Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). The ZNT family, consisting of ten members in mammals (ZNT1–ZNT10), mediates Zn2+ efflux from cells or influx into intracellular vesicles from the cytosol. There are 14 members of the ZIP family of Zn2+ importers in mammals (ZIP1–ZIP14) that promote Zn2+ influx from the extracellular fluid or intracellular vesicles into the cytoplasm. Zn2+ transporters exhibit tissue-specific functions (Liuzzi et al., 2005Liuzzi J.P. Lichten L.A. Rivera S. Blanchard R.K. Aydemir T.B. Knutson M.D. Ganz T. Cousins R.J. Interleukin-6 regulates the zinc transporter Zip14 in liver and contributes to the hypozincemia of the acute-phase response.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Hirano T. Toll-like receptor-mediated regulation of zinc homeostasis influences dendritic cell function.Nat. Immunol. 2006; 7: 971-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), and abnormalities in the function of certain Zn2+ transporters are associated with human diseases, such as acrodermatitis enteropathica (Küry et al., 2002Küry S. Dréno B. Bézieau S. Giraudet S. Kharfi M. Kamoun R. Moisan J.P. Identification of SLC39A4, a gene involved in acrodermatitis enteropathica.Nat. Genet. 2002; 31: 239-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Zn2+ influx modulates a number of transcription factors in various cell types. Among them, metal-regulatory transcription factor-1 (MTF1) regulates expression of a variety of target genes and thereby regulates cellular adaptation to various stress conditions, primarily exposure to heavy metals, but also hypoxia and oxidative stress (Laity and Andrews, 2007Laity J.H. Andrews G.K. Understanding the mechanisms of zinc-sensing by metal-response element binding transcription factor-1 (MTF-1).Arch. Biochem.

Acta. 2012; 1823: 1416-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Zn2+ homeostasis is additionally regulated by metal-dependent transcriptional control of storage proteins. For instance, metallothioneins (MTs), whose genes are well-known targets of MTF1, act as Zn2+-storage proteins and thereby regulate cellular Zn2+ homeostasis. MTs also act as antioxidants and protect cells from oxidative stress (Laity and Andrews, 2007Laity J.H. Andrews G.K.

There has been a growing interest in the potential role of Zn2+ in the pathogenesis of OA. Clinical studies indicate highly elevated serum Zn2+ levels in OA patients (Ovesen et al., 2009Ovesen J. Møller-Madsen B. Nielsen P.T. Christensen P.H. Simonsen O. Hoeck H.C. Laursen M.B. Thomsen J.S. Differences in zinc status between patients with osteoarthritis and osteoporosis.J. Trace Elem. Med. Biol. 2009; 23: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and specific accumulation of Zn2+ in the tidemark region of articular cartilage in aged populations (Roschger et al., 2013Roschger A. Hofstaetter J.G. Pemmer B. Zoeger N. Wobrauschek P. Falkenberg G. Simon R. Berzlanovich A. Thaler H.W. Roschger P. et al.Differential accumulation of lead and zinc in double-tidemarks of articular cartilage.Osteoarthritis Cartilage. 2013; 21: 1707-1715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The association of Zn2+ with OA pathogenesis is broadly appreciated in the context of its role as a structural component of matrix-degrading enzymes required for the maturation and activation of these enzymes. However, how Zn2+ homeostasis is regulated during the onset and progression of OA and how it contributes to the pathological transition of articular chondrocytes remain unknown. Here, we investigated the roles of Zn2+ homeostasis, homeostasis-regulating Zn2+ transporters, and downstream transcription factors and their target genes in OA pathogenesis. We report here that the zinc-ZIP8-MTF1 axis regulates OA pathogenesis. To elucidate the role of Zn2+ homeostasis and associated regulatory genes in OA pathogenesis, we initially examined expression levels of metal ion transporters—the Slc30a family (ZNT) of exporters and Slc39a family (ZIP) of importers—in primary cultures of mouse articular chondrocytes. Among the examined transporters, ZNT9 and ZIP7 mRNAs were expressed at relatively high levels in chondrocytes, whereas many of the remaining transporters were barely detectable (Figure 1A). However, following treatment with interleukin (IL)1β, a proinflammatory cytokine that promotes catabolism in arthritic cartilage (Kapoor et al., 2011Kapoor M. Martel-Pelletier J. Lajeunesse D. Pelletier J.P. Fahmi H. Role of proinflammatory cytokines in the pathophysiology of osteoarthritis.Nat. Rev. Rheumatol. 2011; 7: 33-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (1659) Google Scholar), ZIP8 expression levels were markedly increased, making it the most dominantly expressed transporter among the ZNT and ZIP family members (Figure 1A). This led us to investigate the role of ZIP8 in OA pathogenesis. ZIP8 is known to transport Zn2+, nontransferrin-bound Fe2+, Mn2+, and Cd2+ (Dalton et al., 2005Dalton T.P. He L. Wang B. Miller M.L. Jin L. Stringer K.F. Chang X. Baxter C.S. Nebert D.W. Identification of mouse SLC39A8 as the transporter responsible for cadmium-induced toxicity in the testis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102: 3401-3406Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, Wang et al., 2012Wang C.Y. Jenkitkasemwong S. Duarte S. Sparkman B.K. Shawki A. Mackenzie B. Knutson M.D. ZIP8 is an iron and zinc transporter whose cell-surface expression is up-regulated by cellular iron loading.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 34032-34043Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). We therefore examined whether ZIP8 transports these metal ions in mouse articular chondrocytes. Overexpression of ZIP8 in chondrocytes caused significant Zn2+ influx (Figures 1B and 1C), whereas cellular levels of Fe2+, Mn2+, and Cd2+ were not affected by ZIP8 overexpression alone (Figure 1B). However, in a certain range of each metal ion supplementation, ZIP8 effectively drove influx of these metal ions (Figure 1B), suggesting that the transport efficiency of each metal ion by ZIP8 is determined by the cellular microenvironmental context, with Zn2+ evidently being the most efficiently transported by ZIP8 under our experiment conditions. Thus, we further characterized the regulation of Zn2+ influx by ZIP8. The ZIP8-mediated increase in Zn2+ influx was abolished by the cell-impermeable metal ion chelator, calcium-saturated EDTA (CaEDTA), or the cell-permeable chelator, N,N,N’,N’-tetrakis (2-pyridylmethyl) ethylenediamine (TPEN) (Figure 1C). IL1β, which increased both transcript and protein levels of ZIP8 (Figure 1A, inset), caused an influx of Zn2+ in chondrocytes that was blocked by downregulating Zip8 with small interfering RNA (siRNA) or the metal ion chelators CaEDTA or TPEN (Figure 1C). The upregulation of ZIP8 and Zn2+ influx in chondrocytes under pathological conditions (i.e., exposure to IL1β) suggests the possible association of ZIP8-mediated Zn2+ influx with OA pathogenesis. This was evaluated by examining expression of ZIP8 and Zn2+ levels in OA cartilage of human and mouse models. Damage of OA-affected human cartilage was established based on Alcian blue staining (Figure 1D). Zn2+ and ZIP8 protein and mRNA levels were markedly elevated in OA-affected human cartilage but were barely detectable in undamaged regions of arthritic cartilage (Figure 1D). We also used destabilization of the medial meniscus (DMM) surgery as a mouse model of OA and compared it with normal cartilage in a sham-operated joint (Glasson et al., 2007Glasson S.S. Blanchet T.J. Morris E.A. The surgical destabilization of the medial meniscus (DMM) model of osteoarthritis in the 129/SvEv mouse.Osteoarthritis Cartilage. 2007; 15: 1061-1069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar). Similar to human OA cartilage, mouse OA cartilage showed a marked increase in Zn2+ and ZIP8 protein and mRNA levels (Figure 1E). The increased expression of ZIP8 and elevated Zn2+ levels in OA cartilage suggests their possible involvement in OA pathogenesis. A hallmark of OA chondrocytes is their increased production of Zn2+-bound matrix-degrading enzymes such as MMPs and ADAMTSs. We therefore asked whether cellular Zn2+ influx driven by ZIP8 is sufficient to cause expression of matrix-degrading enzymes. Among the examined enzymes, MMP3, MMP9, MMP12, MMP13, and ADAMTS5 were significantly upregulated by infection of chondrocytes with an adenoviral Zip8 expression construct (Ad-Zip8); this effect was blocked by metal ion chelation with CaEDTA or TPEN (Figure 2A). Consistent with this, treatment of chondrocytes with ZnCl2 upregulated MMP3, MMP9, MMP12, and MMP13, whereas treatment with CdCl2 or MnCl2 did not cause a marked expression of matrix-degrading enzymes (Figure 2B). FeCl2 treatment caused moderate expression of matrix-degrading enzymes. However, chelation of ferric or ferrous with Zn/DFO or 2,2-bipyridyl, respectively, did not affect Ad-Zip8-induced expression of matrix-degrading enzymes (Figure 2C), consistent with the fact that ZIP8 did not cause Fe2+ influx without exogenous FeCl2 supplementation. Furthermore, preincubation of TPEN with ZnCl2 effectively abolished the inhibitory effects of TPEN on the ZIP8-mediated expression of matrix-degrading enzymes, whereas FeCl2, CdCl2, and MnCl2 showed no significant effects on TPEN inhibition of the ZIP8-mediated upregulation of matrix-degrading enzymes (Figure 2D). These results collectively suggest that Zn2+, among the metal ions transported by ZIP8, plays a major role in ZIP8 regulation of the expression of matrix-degrading enzymes. Among the ZIP8-regulated matrix-degrading enzymes, MMP3, MMP13, and ADAMTS5 are crucial effectors of OA cartilage destruction (Blom et al., 2007Blom A.B. van Lent P.L. Libregts S.

Indeed, upregulation of these enzymes by IL1β was abolished by knockdown of Zip8 with specific siRNA or by metal ion chelation with CaEDTA or TPEN (Figures 2E and 2F). Collectively, these results suggest ZIP8-mediated Zn2+ influx exerts a catabolic function in chondrocytes by virtue of its role in upregulating matrix-degrading enzymes. The role of ZIP8-mediated Zn2+ influx in OA pathogenesis was directly examined by intra-articular (IA) injection of Ad-Zip8 into mouse knee joints. We have previously shown that the adenoviral system effectively delivers genes into mouse joint tissues (Yang et al., 2010Yang S. Kim J. Ryu J.H. Oh H. Chun C.H. Kim B.J. Min B.H. Chun J.S.

Ad-Zip8 injection caused ZIP8 overexpression in cartilage, meniscus, ligament, and synovium (Figures 3A and S1A). Three weeks after Ad-Zip8 injection, chondrocytes of cartilage tissue exhibited markedly increased levels of Zn2+, MMP3, and MMP13 (Figure 3A) with concomitant cartilage destruction (Figures 3B and 3C). IA injection of Ad-Zip8 also caused synovitis (Figure S1C). Consistent with this, overexpression of ZIP8 in primary cultured mouse fibroblast-like synoviocytes caused upregulation of various catabolic factors, including matrix-degrading enzymes, cytokines, and chemokines (Figure S1D). Additionally, Ad-Zip8-induced MMP expression, cartilage destruction, and synovitis were significantly blocked by coinjection of TPEN (Figures 3A, 3B, and S1C). Other OA manifestations, such as osteophyte development and subchondral bone sclerosis, were not observed at 3 weeks after Ad-Zip8 injection. However, 8 weeks after IA injection, joint tissues exhibited osteophyte development and subchondral bone sclerosis with more severe cartilage destruction (Figure S1E). Collectively, these results demonstrate that ZIP8-mediated Zn2+ influx acts as a catabolic regulator of OA pathogenesis.Figure 3ZIP8 Overexpression in Cartilage Tissue Causes OA Pathogenesis in MiceShow full caption(A–C) Mice were IA injected with Ad-C or Ad-Zip8 with or without TPEN.

The in vivo role of ZIP8-mediated Zn2+ influx in OA pathogenesis was further validated using chondrocyte-specific Zip8-overexpressing transgenic (TG) mice (Col2a1-Zip8), in which Zip8 expression is driven by the promoter and enhancer region of mouse Col2a1 (Yang et al., 2010Yang S. Kim J. Ryu J.H. Oh H. Chun C.H. Kim B.J. Min B.H. Chun J.S. Hypoxia-inducible factor-2α is a catabolic regulator of osteoarthritic cartilage destruction.Nat. Med. 2010; 16: 687-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, Oh et al., 2012Oh H. Chun C.H. Chun J.S. Dkk-1 expression in chondrocytes inhibits experimental osteoarthritic cartilage destruction in mice.Arthritis Rheum. 2012; 64: 2568-2578Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Col2a1-Zip8 TG mice expressed markedly enhanced levels of ZIP8 in cartilage and meniscus, but not in the synovium or ligaments, of joint tissues (Figures 3D and S2A). Zip8 TG mice also showed increased levels of Zn2+, MMP3, and MMP13 in cartilage tissue (Figure 3D). Consistent with this, aged (12-month-old) Zip8 TG mice exhibited spontaneous cartilage destruction (Figure 3E), with Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI) grades ranging from 1 to 6 (Figure S2D) and subchondral bone sclerosis (Figure 3F) compared with age-matched wild-type (WT) mice; synovitis was not observed in Zip8 TG mice (Figure 3G). Additionally, DMM surgery in young (10–12 weeks old) Zip8 TG mice showed significantly enhanced OA cartilage destruction (Figure 3H) and subchondral bone sclerosis, whereas synovitis and osteophyte development were not affected (Figures S2E and S2F). These features of Zip8 TG mice clearly support the notion that ZIP overexpression in cartilage tissue is sufficient to cause OA pathogenesis. We next confirmed the catabolic role of ZIP8 in OA pathogenesis using Zip8-knockout (KO) mice. Because homozygous deletion of Zip8 in mice (Zip8−/−) is embryonic lethal (Gálvez-Peralta et al., 2012Gálvez-Peralta M. He L. Jorge-Nebert L.F. Wang B. Miller M.L. Eppert B.L. Afton S. Nebert D.W. ZIP8 zinc transporter: indispensable role for both multiple-organ organogenesis and hematopoiesis in utero.PLoS ONE. 2012; 7: e36055Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), we evaluated the effect of Zip8 knockout on OA pathogenesis using chondrocyte-specific conditional KO (CKO) mice (Zip8fl/fl;Col2a1-Cre). Zip8-CKO mice showed a significant reduction in OA cartilage destruction following DMM surgery (Figure 4A), with concomitant inhibition of ZIP8 expression, Zn2+ influx, and expression of MMP3 and MMP13 in cartilage tissue (Figure 4B). Consistent with this, IL1β-induced Zn2+ influx and expression of MMP3, MMP13, and ADAMTS5 were reduced in primary cultured chondrocytes isolated from Zip8-CKO mice (Figures 4C and 4D). In addition to cartilage destruction, DMM-operated Zip8-CKO mice exhibited significant inhibition of subchondral bone sclerosis, whereas synovitis and osteophyte formation were not affected (Figures 4E and 4F). The results collectively suggest that genetic deletion of Zip8 inhibits experimental OA pathogenesis in mice. Similar to Zip8 CKO mice, Zip8+/− mice also exhibited reduced OA cartilage destruction and subchondral bone sclerosis following DMM surgery (data not shown). Next, we elucidated the regulatory mechanisms by which ZIP8-mediated Zn2+ influx mediates catabolic factor expression and OA pathogenesis. To do this, we first identified transcription factors activated by ZIP8-mediated Zn2+ influx in chondrocytes using a transcription factor array kit. Among the 37 transcription factors examined, MTF1, NRF1 and NRF2, NF-κB, SP1, p53, C/EBP, and AP1 showed more than a 3-fold increase in transcriptional activity following Ad-Zip8 infection (Figure S3A). Pharmacological inhibition of p53, AP1, or NF-κB or siRNA-mediated knockdown of Nrf or Cebpb had no significant effect on Ad-Zip8-induced upregulation of matrix-degrading enzymes (Figures S3C and S3D). However, knockdown of Mtf1 with siRNA or inhibition of SP1 with mithramycin-A significantly attenuated ZIP8-induced upregulation of matrix-degrading enzymes (Figures S3E and S3G). Based on these observations and the fact that MTF1 is a master transcriptional regulator of cellular adaptation under conditions of exposure to heavy metals (Laity and Andrews, 2007Laity J.H. Andrews G.K. Understanding the mechanisms of zinc-sensing by metal-response element binding transcription factor-1 (MTF-1).Arch. Biochem.

Acta. 2012; 1823: 1416-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), we selected MTF1 for functional characterization in ZIP8-induced OA pathogenesis. Ad-Zip8 infection promoted the nuclear localization of MTF1 (Figure 5A) and significantly increased its transcriptional activity (Figure 5B) without modulating its expression (Figure S4A). Notably, adenoviruses expressing mouse Mtf1 (Ad-Mtf1) infection significantly upregulated expression of matrix-degrading enzymes (MMP3, MMP9, MMP12, MMP13, and ADAMTS5), an effect that was abolished by CaEDTA or TPEN (Figures 5C and 5D). Additionally, ZIP8 or Zn2+-induced upregulation of matrix-degrading enzymes was significantly reduced by siRNA-mediated knockdown of Mtf1 (Figures S3E and S3F). Among the ZIP8-regulated metal ions, Zn2+ was the most effective in regulating nuclear localization and transcriptional activation of MTF1 and Fe2+ and Mn2+ had no effect on MTF1 activity (Figures S4B and S4C). Although Cd2+ caused a moderate activation of MTF1 (Figure S4C), it had no significant effect on the expression of matrix-degrading enzymes, except for a modest induction of MMP12 expression (Figure 2B). This suggests that, unlike the effects of Zn2+-dependent activation of MTF1, Cd2+-induced MTF1 activation does not cause expression of matrix-degrading enzymes. This discrepancy may reflect the fact that MTF1 regulates target-gene expression in a metal-specific manner (Günther et al., 2012Günther V. Lindert U. Schaffner W. The taste of heavy metals: gene regulation by MTF-1.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2012; 1823: 1416-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Additionally, preincubation of TPEN with ZnCl2, but not FeCl2, CdCl2, or MnCl2, abolished the inhibitory effects of TPEN on MTF1 transcriptional activity (Figure S4D). These results collectively suggest that ZIP8-mediated Zn2+ influx promotes MTF1 transcriptional activity, which in turn upregulates expression of matrix-degrading enzymes in chondrocytes.Fi"

Real-time functional MRI neurofeedback (rtfMRI-nf) offers a non-invasive method to modulate this regional activity. We examined whether depressed participants can use rtfMRI-nf to enhance amygdala responses to positive autobiographical memories, and whether this ability alters symptom severity.Unmedicated MDD subjects were assigned to receive rtfMRI-nf from either left amygdala (LA; experimental group, n = 14) or the horizontal segment of the intraparietal sulcus (HIPS; control group, n = 7) and instructed to contemplate happy autobiographical memories (AMs) to raise the level of a bar representing the hemodynamic signal from the target region to a target level. This 40s Happy condition alternated with 40s blocks of rest and counting backwards. A final Transfer run without neurofeedback information was included.Participants in the experimental group upregulated their amygdala responses during positive AM recall. Significant pre-post scan decreases in anxiety ratings and increases in happiness ratings were evident in the experimental versus control group. A whole brain analysis showed that during the transfer run, participants in the experimental group had increased activity compared to the control group in left superior temporal gyrus and temporal polar cortex, and right thalamus.Using rtfMRI-nf from the left amygdala during recall of positive AMs, depressed subjects were able to self-regulate their amygdala response, resulting in improved mood. Results from this proof-of-concept study suggest that rtfMRI-nf training with positive AM recall holds potential as a novel therapeutic approach in the treatment of depression."

In plants, clathrin-mediated endocytosis is essential for physiology and development, but the identification and organization of the machinery operating this process remains largely obscure. Here, we identified an eight-core-component protein complex, the TPLATE complex, essential for plant growth via its role as major adaptor module for clathrin-mediated endocytosis. This complex consists of evolutionarily unique proteins that associate closely with core endocytic elements. The TPLATE complex is recruited as dynamic foci at the plasma membrane preceding recruitment of adaptor protein complex 2, clathrin, and dynamin-related proteins. Reduced function of different complex components severely impaired internalization of assorted endocytic cargoes, demonstrating its pivotal role in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Taken together, the TPLATE complex is an early endocytic module representing a unique evolutionary plant adaptation of the canonical eukaryotic pathway for clathrin-mediated endocytosis."
https://openalex.org/W2033152634,"We measured half-lives of 21,248 mRNA 3' isoforms in yeast by rapidly depleting RNA polymerase II from the nucleus and performing direct RNA sequencing throughout the decay process. Interestingly, half-lives of mRNA isoforms from the same gene, including nearly identical isoforms, often vary widely. Based on clusters of isoforms with different half-lives, we identify hundreds of sequences conferring stabilization or destabilization upon mRNAs terminating downstream. One class of stabilizing element is a polyU sequence that can interact with poly(A) tails, inhibit the association of poly(A)-binding protein, and confer increased stability upon introduction into ectopic transcripts. More generally, destabilizing and stabilizing elements are linked to the propensity of the poly(A) tail to engage in double-stranded structures. Isoforms engineered to fold into 3' stem-loop structures not involving the poly(A) tail exhibit even longer half-lives. We suggest that double-stranded structures at 3' ends are a major determinant of mRNA stability."

At some point in their existence, all proteins must move within mammalian cells. Some movement is biosynthetic, in that the protein must be transported from its site of synthesis on the ribosome to its site of action. Another type of movement is signal dependent, meaning that the protein will move from one location to another in response to some cellular stimulus. Classic cell biological studies identified the cis-acting sequences that direct these types of protein movement within cells, for example, Blobel and Dobberstein, 1975aBlobel G. Dobberstein B.

In addition to these examples, a more complex type of protein movement exists, where proteins can be found in multiple locations under resting conditions or can be recruited to multiple locations in response to a stimulus. In this latter instance, it is not obvious how a single localization signal would allow a protein to be targeted to (and function from) multiple organelles. An example of this can be found from the studies of the Toll-like receptors (TLRs) of the innate immune system. TLRs are transmembrane receptors that are expressed by a variety of mammalian cell types but are best studied in professional phagocytes such as macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) (Akira et al., 2006Akira S. Uematsu S. Takeuchi O. Pathogen recognition and innate immunity.Cell. 2006; 124: 783-801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8722) Google Scholar). TLRs detect a wide range of microbial products and may be divided into different groups based on their subcellular site of ligand recognition (Barton and Kagan, 2009Barton G.M. Kagan J.C. A cell biological view of Toll-like receptor function: regulation through compartmentalization.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2009; 9: 535-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). TLRs 1, 2, and 4–6 reside at the plasma membrane, where they detect molecules displayed on the surface of various pathogens. TLRs 3, 7–9, and 11–13 are localized to various endosomal compartments, where most detect microbial nucleic acids. Despite residing in distinct subcellular compartments, most TLRs activate a common signal transduction pathway to induce innate and adaptive immunity. TLR signaling usually initiates with the activation of an adaptor protein called MyD88, which is recruited to the conserved TIR domain present in the cytosolic tail of all receptors of this family (Gay et al., 2011Gay N.J.

MyD88 forms a protein complex with kinases of the IRAK family called the myddosome (Lin et al., 2010Lin S.C. Lo Y.C. Wu H.

This complex is thought to induce a cascade of signaling events that activates the NF-κB-dependent expression of cytokines, chemokines, and other immunomodulatory factors (Gay et al., 2011Gay N.J.

Immunol. 2009; 9: 692-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar). Because TLRs reside on distinct organelles, the myddosome must have the capacity to be assembled in multiple subcellular locations. How myddosome assembly can be promoted from multiple locations is unknown. Answering this question will fill a fundamental gap in our understanding of how immune signaling pathways are integrated into the cellular infrastructure within which they operate. A simple explanation for how MyD88 can be recruited to diverse organelles would be through interactions with the TIR domains of activated TLRs. However, two-hybrid analyses performed in yeast and mammalian cells indicated that MyD88 has limited ability to interact with TLRs directly (Brown et al., 2006Brown V. Brown R.A. Ozinsky A. Hesselberth J.R. Fields S. Binding specificity of Toll-like receptor cytoplasmic domains.Eur. J. Immunol. 2006; 36: 742-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, Ulrichts et al., 2007Ulrichts P. Peelman F. Beyaert R. Tavernier J. MAPPIT analysis of TLR adaptor complexes.FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 629-636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). For this reason, an intermediate protein is likely required to link activated TLRs to the recruitment of MyD88. Consistent with this model, the cell-surface TLRs utilize “sorting adaptors” to accomplish this task. Sorting adaptors are the only regulators of TLR signaling that are located at the subcellular site of signal transduction, prior to any microbial encounter (Kagan, 2012aKagan J.C. Defining the subcellular sites of innate immune signal transduction.Trends Immunol. 2012; 33: 442-448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Their placement at the eventual site of signaling allows sorting adaptors to function as sensors of activated TLRs and recruit downstream signaling adaptors (e.g., MyD88) to induce inflammatory cytokine expression. Most plasma membrane-localized TLRs use the sorting adaptor TIRAP (also known as Mal) to recruit MyD88 to the cell surface (Fitzgerald et al., 2001Fitzgerald K.A. Palsson-McDermott E.M. Bowie A.G.

The ability of TIRAP to function as a sorting adaptor is dependent on its amino-terminal localization domain, which interacts with plasma membrane-localized phosphatidylinositol-4,5 bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) and other lipids (Kagan and Medzhitov, 2006Kagan J.C. Medzhitov R. Phosphoinositide-mediated adaptor recruitment controls Toll-like receptor signaling.Cell. 2006; 125: 943-955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). The use of sorting adaptors extends beyond the MyD88-dependent pathways because analogous systems exist in other immune signaling pathways in mammals and Drosophila melanogaster (Kagan, 2012aKagan J.C.

Phosphoinositide binding by the Toll adaptor dMyD88 controls antibacterial responses in Drosophila.Immunity. 2012; 36: 612-622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Despite the apparent importance of sorting/signaling adaptor pairs for controlling TLR signaling from the cell surface, a sorting adaptor for the exclusively endosomal TLRs has not been described. As such, it is unclear how MyD88-dependent innate immune responses are activated by endosomal TLRs. TIRAP was initially excluded as a sorting adaptor for endosomal TLRs because TIRAP-deficient cells retain the ability to respond to synthetic TLR7 and TLR9 ligands (Horng et al., 2002Horng T. Barton G.M. Flavell R.A. Medzhitov R. The adaptor molecule TIRAP provides signalling specificity for Toll-like receptors.Nature. 2002; 420: 329-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar, Yamamoto et al., 2002Yamamoto M. Sato S.

Fujita T. et al.Essential role for TIRAP in activation of the signalling cascade shared by TLR2 and TLR4.Nature. 2002; 420: 324-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar). However, these studies also demonstrated that the requirement of TIRAP for signaling from cell-surface-localized TLRs can be bypassed when high concentrations of ligand are used. Primary macrophages and DCs are highly endocytic. This property, combined with the common use of phosphorothioate-linked (nuclease-resistant) nucleic acids to activate endosomal TLRs, led us to hypothesize that these ligands could accumulate to high concentrations within endosomes, masking a requirement for TIRAP. In light of this hypothesis, we decided to reassess the role of TIRAP in endosomal TLR signaling. Herein, we report that TIRAP is required for signaling downstream of endosomal TLRs in response to natural ligands, such as viral nucleic acids. We show that TIRAP is present in myddosomes induced by both cell-surface and endosomal TLRs and is required for myddosome formation. Furthermore, we show that the ability of TIRAP to bind to multiple lipid species is critical for its ability to function from multiple subcellular compartments. These findings provide a molecular explanation for the ability of MyD88 to be recruited to more than one organelle and highlight how a promiscuous lipid-binding domain can be used to diversify the subcellular sites of innate immune signal transduction. To determine whether TIRAP would function as a sorting adaptor for endosomal TLRs, we readdressed the genetic requirement for this protein in the signaling pathway activated by TLR9. TLR9 is an excellent model for these studies for two reasons. First, it is the best-characterized endosome-localized TLR (Barbalat et al., 2011Barbalat R. Ewald S.E. Mouchess M.L. Barton G.M. Nucleic acid recognition by the innate immune system.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2011; 29: 185-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar), and its ligand (unmethylated CpG-containing DNA) is easy to produce (Hemmi et al., 2000Hemmi H. Takeuchi O. Kawai T. Kaisho T. Sato S. Sanjo H. Matsumoto M. Hoshino K. Wagner H. Takeda K. Akira S. A Toll-like receptor recognizes bacterial DNA.Nature. 2000; 408: 740-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (5360) Google Scholar). Second, whereas several viruses activate TLRs at the cell surface and endosomes (Barbalat et al., 2009Barbalat R. Lau L. Locksley R.M. Barton G.M.

USA. 2004; 101: 1315-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar), substrains of herpes simplex virus (HSV) exist that only activate TLR9 (Sato et al., 2006Sato A. Linehan M.M. Iwasaki A. Dual recognition of herpes simplex viruses by TLR2 and TLR9 in dendritic cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 17343-17348Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Thus, TLR9 provides a useful model for the study of both synthetic (CpG DNA) and natural (HSV) activators of endosomal TLRs. Wild-type (WT) and TIRAP knockout (KO) primary bone-marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) were stimulated with CpG DNA or three substrains of HSV-1 (Sato et al., 2006Sato A. Linehan M.M. Iwasaki A.

The cell populations were then assessed for the expression of the cytokines interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and IL-6. As expected (Horng et al., 2002Horng T. Barton G.M. Flavell R.A. Medzhitov R. The adaptor molecule TIRAP provides signalling specificity for Toll-like receptors.Nature. 2002; 420: 329-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar, Yamamoto et al., 2002Yamamoto M. Sato S.

Fujita T. et al.Essential role for TIRAP in activation of the signalling cascade shared by TLR2 and TLR4.Nature. 2002; 420: 324-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar), TIRAP KO BMDMs had no defect in responding to CpG DNA, whereas their response to bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a ligand for the cell-surface TLR4, was impaired (Figure 1A). Interestingly, whereas all three substrains of HSV induced the expression of IL-1β and IL-6 in WT BMDMs, TIRAP KO BMDMs were defective for these responses (Figure 1B). Among the HSV substrains tested, Kos A and Kos CE only engage TLR9, whereas Kos K engages both cell-surface TLR2 and endosomal TLR9 (Sato et al., 2006Sato A. Linehan M.M. Iwasaki A. Dual recognition of herpes simplex viruses by TLR2 and TLR9 in dendritic cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 17343-17348Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Our finding that TIRAP is required for cytokine expression in response to HSV substrains that only engage TLR9 suggests that this adaptor plays a role in signaling from endosomal receptors. Interestingly, as was observed for ligands that activate cell-surface-localized TLRs (Horng et al., 2002Horng T. Barton G.M. Flavell R.A. Medzhitov R. The adaptor molecule TIRAP provides signalling specificity for Toll-like receptors.Nature. 2002; 420: 329-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar), the requirement for TIRAP in TLR9 signaling can be bypassed by increasing the dose of a subset of HSV substrains (Figure S1A available online, multiplicity of infection [moi] = 10). The requirement of TIRAP for antiviral responses was unique to the TLR pathway because WT and TIRAP KO BMDMs expressed the interferon (IFN)-inducible gene viperin comparably when infected with mammalian reovirus (Figure S1B), a known activator of the cytosolic RIG-I-like receptors (Dixit et al., 2010Dixit E. Boulant S. Zhang Y. Lee A.S. Odendall C. Shum B. Hacohen N. Chen Z.J. Whelan S.P. Fransen M. et al.Peroxisomes are signaling platforms for antiviral innate immunity.Cell. 2010; 141: 668-681Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). Collectively, these data suggest an important role of TIRAP in the response to natural (viral) activators of endosomal TLR9.Figure S1Further Analysis of TLR Signaling in Primary and iBMDMs, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) WT or TIRAP KO primary BMDM were infected with two strains of HSV at multiple MOIs.

(D) iBMDM were infected with an IPC0 null (7134) or revertant (7134R) strain of HSV and transcriptional responses were assessed by qPCR. Error bars represent SD. To corroborate these findings, we sought an alternative cell type to study the role of TIRAP. Plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) are an intriguing option because they exclusively utilize endosomal TLRs to detect infections (Gilliet et al., 2008Gilliet M. Cao W. Liu Y.J. Plasmacytoid dendritic cells: sensing nucleic acids in viral infection and autoimmune diseases.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2008; 8: 594-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar). As such, all of the plasma membrane-localized TLRs that are established to require TIRAP are nonfunctional in these cells (Sato et al., 2006Sato A. Linehan M.M. Iwasaki A. Dual recognition of herpes simplex viruses by TLR2 and TLR9 in dendritic cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 17343-17348Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Moreover, in pDCs, endosomal TLRs exhibit an intriguing behavior in that they can induce cytokine and IFN production from different populations of endosomes, with IFN production occurring from endosomes rich in 3′ phosphoinositides (PIs) (Sasai et al., 2010Sasai M. Linehan M.M. Iwasaki A. Bifurcation of Toll-like receptor 9 signaling by adaptor protein 3.Science. 2010; 329: 1530-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). We reasoned that if TIRAP was not required for endosomal TLR signaling, as previously reported by Horng et al., 2002Horng T. Barton G.M. Flavell R.A. Medzhitov R. The adaptor molecule TIRAP provides signalling specificity for Toll-like receptors.Nature. 2002; 420: 329-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar and Yamamoto et al., 2002Yamamoto M. Sato S. Hemmi H. Sanjo H. Uematsu S. Kaisho T. Hoshino K. Takeuchi O. Kobayashi M. Fujita T. et al.Essential role for TIRAP in activation of the signalling cascade shared by TLR2 and TLR4.Nature. 2002; 420: 324-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar, then pDCs would have no need to express the gene encoding this adaptor. To address this possibility, a comparison of gene expression was performed between highly purified pDCs and conventional DCs (cDCs). This analysis revealed that pDCs express much lower levels of the cell-surface TLRs 1, 2, 4, and 6 than cDCs (Figure 1C). This observation may (in part) explain the inability of pDCs to respond to ligands for plasma membrane-localized TLRs (Sato et al., 2006Sato A. Linehan M.M. Iwasaki A. Dual recognition of herpes simplex viruses by TLR2 and TLR9 in dendritic cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 17343-17348Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). pDCs expressed higher levels of some endosomal TLRs (TLR7 and TLR12) than their cDC counterparts. Interestingly, both cell types expressed comparable levels of TLR9, TIRAP, and MyD88 (Figure 1C), suggesting that TIRAP may indeed have a function downstream of endosomal TLRs in pDCs. To address this possibility, pDCs were infected with either HSV or influenza virus, natural activators of endosomal TLR9 and TLR7, respectively (Diebold et al., 2004Diebold S.S. Kaisho T. Hemmi H. Akira S. Reis e Sousa C. Innate antiviral responses by means of TLR7-mediated recognition of single-stranded RNA.Science. 2004; 303: 1529-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (2725) Google Scholar, Lund et al., 2004Lund J.M. Alexopoulou L. Sato A. Karow M. Adams N.C. Gale N.W. Iwasaki A. Flavell R.A. Recognition of single-stranded RNA viruses by Toll-like receptor 7.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 5598-5603Crossref PubMed Scopus (1489) Google Scholar). Infected cells were then assessed for their ability to induce the expression of IFNα or the cytokine IL-12p40. Because the expression of these cytokines is initiated from different populations of endosomes (Sasai et al., 2010Sasai M. Linehan M.M. Iwasaki A. Bifurcation of Toll-like receptor 9 signaling by adaptor protein 3.Science. 2010; 329: 1530-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), this experiment allows us to determine if a population of endosomes exists that selectively requires TIRAP function. In comparison to WT pDCs, TIRAP KO pDCs were impaired in the ability to produce IFNα in response to HSV or influenza virus (Figure 1D). In contrast, the production of IL-12p40 was not impaired in TIRAP KO pDCs, suggesting that TIRAP regulates signaling from endosomes that were previously defined as being rich for 3′ PIs (Sasai et al., 2010Sasai M. Linehan M.M. Iwasaki A. Bifurcation of Toll-like receptor 9 signaling by adaptor protein 3.Science. 2010; 329: 1530-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Another sorting adaptor may exist to control TLR signaling to induce IL-12p40. Overall, these data establish that, in response to natural activators of innate immunity, TIRAP is required for signaling by endosomal TLRs in multiple cell types. Furthermore, the use of HSV strains that only activate TLR9, and the use of pDCs that only permit signaling by endosomal TLRs, eliminates the possibility of contaminating bacterial products (e.g., LPS) explaining these observations. To define the means by which TIRAP regulates TLR signaling from multiple organelles, we sought a cell type that would be easy to propagate and amenable to genetic manipulation. Immortalized BMDMs (iBMDMs) have emerged as a useful tool in this regard because they retain the signaling properties of their primary cell counterparts (Dixit et al., 2010Dixit E. Boulant S. Zhang Y. Lee A.S. Odendall C. Shum B. Hacohen N. Chen Z.J. Whelan S.P. Fransen M. et al.Peroxisomes are signaling platforms for antiviral innate immunity.Cell. 2010; 141: 668-681Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar, Halle et al., 2008Halle A.

Immunol. 2008; 9: 857-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (1756) Google Scholar), and TIRAP KO iBMDMs have been used to dissect the functions of this adaptor (Nagpal et al., 2009Nagpal K. Plantinga T.S. Wong J. Monks B.G. Gay N.J. Netea M.G. Fitzgerald K.A. Golenbock D.T. A TIR domain variant of MyD88 adapter-like (Mal)/TIRAP results in loss of MyD88 binding and reduced TLR2/TLR4 signaling.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 25742-25748Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Similar to our observations made in primary BMDMs, TIRAP was required for iBMDMs to respond to several substrains of HSV, including two that engage only TLR9 (Kos A and Kos CE) (Figure 2A) (Sato et al., 2006Sato A. Linehan M.M. Iwasaki A. Dual recognition of herpes simplex viruses by TLR2 and TLR9 in dendritic cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 17343-17348Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). We found that iBMDMs are less phagocytic than primary BMDMs (Figure 2B). This was expected because endocytosis and phagocytosis rates are higher in nonmitotic macrophages (e.g., primary BMDMs) than in dividing macrophages (Berlin et al., 1978Berlin R.D. Oliver J.M. Walter R.J. Surface functions during Mitosis I: phagocytosis, pinocytosis and mobility of surface-bound Con A.Cell. 1978; 15: 327-341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that this lower phagocytic activity would prevent CpG DNA from building to high concentrations within endosomes, perhaps revealing a requirement for TIRAP in responses to synthetic TLR9 ligands. Indeed, whereas WT iBMDMs responded to CpG DNA comparably to primary WT BMDMs, TIRAP KO iBMDMs were completely unresponsive (Figure 2C). However, high doses of CpG DNA partially overcame the requirement for TIRAP in these cells (Figure S1C). To determine whether TIRAP deficiency was responsible for the unresponsiveness of these cells to TLR9 ligands, this adaptor was stably reintroduced into TIRAP KO iBMDMs via retroviral transduction. The retroviral vector used also encodes an internal ribosomal entry site upstream of EGFP, which allowed for the use of fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to isolate a population of cells with uniform levels of expression (data not shown). Rescuing TIRAP expression in TIRAP KO iBMDMs restored responsiveness to plasma membrane and endosomal-localized TLR ligands (Figure 2D). Furthermore, rescuing TIRAP expression enabled an enhanced response to all substrains of HSV examined (Figures 2A and S1D). Among the substrains examined is HSV-7134 (Figure S1D), which lacks the expression of ICP0 (van Lint et al., 2010van Lint A.L. Murawski M.R. Goodbody R.E. Severa M. Fitzgerald K.A. Finberg R.W. Knipe D.M. Kurt-Jones E.A. Herpes simplex virus immediate-early ICP0 protein inhibits Toll-like receptor 2-dependent inflammatory responses and NF-kappaB signaling.J. Virol. 2010; 84: 10802-10811Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). ICP0 is an immune evasion protein that may interfere with TLR signaling by causing the degradation of TIRAP and/or MyD88 (van Lint et al., 2010van Lint A.L. Murawski M.R. Goodbody R.E. Severa"

https://openalex.org/W2037690972,"Introduction We related composition of cerebral thrombi to stroke subtype and attenuation on non-contrast CT (NCCT) to gain more insight in etiopathogenesis and to validate thrombus attenuation as a new imaging biomarker for acute stroke. Methods We histopathologically investigated 22 thrombi retrieved after mechanical thrombectomy in acute stroke patients. First, thrombi were classified as fresh, lytic or organized. Second, percentages of red blood cells (RBCs), platelets and fibrin and number of red, white (respectively RBCs or platelets outnumbering other components with ≥15%) or mixed thrombi were compared between large artery atherosclerosis (LAA), cardioembolism, dissection and unknown subtype. Third, correlation between attenuation and RBCs, platelets and fibrin was calculated using Pearson's correlation coefficients (r). Results Thrombi were fresh in 73% (n = 16), lytic in 18% (n = 4) and organized in 9% (n = 2). The stroke cause was LAA in eight (36%), cardioembolism in six (27%), dissection in three (14%), and unknown in five (23%) patients. LAA thrombi showed the highest percentage RBCs (median 50 (range 35–90)), followed by dissection (35 (20–40), p = 0.05), cardioembolism (35 (5–45), p = 0.013) and unknown subtype (25 (2–40), p = 0.006). No differences in platelets (p = 0.16) and fibrin (p = 0.52) between subtypes were found. LAA thrombi were classified as red or mixed (both n = 4), cardioembolisms as mixed (n = 5) or white (n = 1) and dissection as mixed (n = 3). There was a moderate positive correlation between attenuation and RBCs (r = 0.401, p = 0.049), and weak negative correlations with platelets (r = −0.368, p = 0.09) and fibrin (r = −0.073, p = 0.75). Conclusions The majority of cerebral thrombi is fresh. There are no differences in age of thrombi between subtypes. LAA thrombi have highest percentages RBCs, cardioembolism and unknown subtype lowest. No relationship exists between subtype and platelets or fibrin percentages. We found a correlation between the RBC-component and thrombus attenuation, which improves validation of thrombus attenuation on NCCT as an imaging biomarker for stroke management."
https://openalex.org/W2058890095,"Erk1/2 activation contributes to mouse ES cell pluripotency. We found a direct role of Erk1/2 in modulating chromatin features required for regulated developmental gene expression. Erk2 binds to specific DNA sequence motifs typically accessed by Jarid2 and PRC2. Negating Erk1/2 activation leads to increased nucleosome occupancy and decreased occupancy of PRC2 and poised RNAPII at Erk2-PRC2-targeted developmental genes. Surprisingly, Erk2-PRC2-targeted genes are specifically devoid of TFIIH, known to phosphorylate RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) at serine-5, giving rise to its initiated form. Erk2 interacts with and phosphorylates RNAPII at its serine 5 residue, which is consistent with the presence of poised RNAPII as a function of Erk1/2 activation. These findings underscore a key role for Erk1/2 activation in promoting the primed status of developmental genes in mouse ES cells and suggest that the transcription complex at developmental genes is different than the complexes formed at other genes, offering alternative pathways of regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2119708131,"Bacterial and viral mRNAs are often polycistronic. Akin to alternative splicing, alternative translation of polycistronic messages is a mechanism to generate protein diversity and regulate gene function. Although a few examples exist, the use of polycistronic messages in mammalian cells is not widely appreciated. Here we report an example of alternative translation as a means of regulating innate immune signaling. MAVS, a regulator of antiviral innate immunity, is expressed from a bicistronic mRNA encoding a second protein, miniMAVS. This truncated variant interferes with interferon production induced by full-length MAVS, whereas both proteins positively regulate cell death. To identify other polycistronic messages, we carried out genome-wide ribosomal profiling and identified a class of antiviral truncated variants. This study therefore reveals the existence of a functionally important bicistronic antiviral mRNA and suggests a widespread role for polycistronic mRNAs in the innate immune system."

https://openalex.org/W2091604056,"Post-translational modifications of histone proteins produce dynamic signals that regulate the structure and function of chromatin. Mono-ubiquitination of H2B in the histone tail (at Lys-123 in yeast or Lys-120 in humans) is a conserved modification that has been implicated in the regulation of transcription, replication, and DNA repair processes. In a search for direct effectors of ubH2B, we identified a deubiquitinating enzyme, Usp15, through affinity purification with a nonhydrolyzable ubH2B mimic. In the nucleus, Usp15 indirectly associates with the ubH2B E3 ligase, RNF20/RNF40, and directly associates with a component of the splicing machinery, SART3 (also known as TIP110 or p110). These physical interactions place Usp15 in the vicinity of actively transcribed DNA. Importantly we found that SART3 has previously unrecognized histone chaperone activities. SART3, but not the well-characterized histone chaperone Nap1, enhances Usp15 binding to ubH2B and facilitates deubiquitination of ubH2B in free histones but not in nucleosomes. These results suggest that SART3 recruits ubH2B, which may be evicted from DNA during transcription, for deubiquitination by Usp15. In light of the function played by SART3 in U4/U6 di-snRNP formation, our discovery points to a direct link between eviction-coupled erasure of the ubiquitin mark from ubH2B and co-transcriptional pre-mRNA splicing.

https://openalex.org/W2023500328,"Background and Aim Recent studies in patients with anorexia nervosa suggest that oxytocin may be involved in the pathophysiology of anorexia nervosa. We examined whether there was evidence of variation in methylation status of the oxytocin receptor (OXTR) gene in patients with anorexia nervosa that might account for these findings. Methods We analyzed the methylation status of the CpG sites in a region from the exon 1 to the MT2 regions of the OXTR gene in buccal cells from 15 patients and 36 healthy women using bisulfite sequencing. We further examined whether methylation status was associated with markers of illness severity or form. Results We identified six CpG sites with significant differences in average methylation levels between the patient and control groups. Among the six differentially methylated CpG sites, five showed higher than average methylation levels in patients than those in the control group (64.9–88.8% vs. 6.6–45.0%). The methylation levels of these five CpG sites were negatively associated with body mass index (BMI). BMI, eating disorders psychopathology, and anxiety were identified in a regression analysis as factors affecting the methylation levels of these CpG sites with more variation accounted for by BMI. Conclusions Epigenetic misregulation of the OXTR gene may be implicated in anorexia nervosa, which may either be a mechanism linking environmental adversity to risk or may be a secondary consequence of the illness."
https://openalex.org/W2067134900,"What proportion of genes with intense and selective expression in specific tissues, cells, or systems are still almost completely uncharacterized with respect to biological function? In what ways do these functionally enigmatic genes differ from well-studied genes? To address these two questions, we devised a computational approach that defines so-called ignoromes. As proof of principle, we extracted and analyzed a large subset of genes with intense and selective expression in brain. We find that publications associated with this set are highly skewed--the top 5% of genes absorb 70% of the relevant literature. In contrast, approximately 20% of genes have essentially no neuroscience literature. Analysis of the ignorome over the past decade demonstrates that it is stubbornly persistent, and the rapid expansion of the neuroscience literature has not had the expected effect on numbers of these genes. Surprisingly, ignorome genes do not differ from well-studied genes in terms of connectivity in coexpression networks. Nor do they differ with respect to numbers of orthologs, paralogs, or protein domains. The major distinguishing characteristic between these sets of genes is date of discovery, early discovery being associated with greater research momentum--a genomic bandwagon effect. Finally we ask to what extent massive genomic, imaging, and phenotype data sets can be used to provide high-throughput functional annotation for an entire ignorome. In a majority of cases we have been able to extract and add significant information for these neglected genes. In several cases--ELMOD1, TMEM88B, and DZANK1--we have exploited sequence polymorphisms, large phenome data sets, and reverse genetic methods to evaluate the function of ignorome genes."
https://openalex.org/W2068725790,"Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in the blood of patients with epithelial malignancies provide a promising and minimally invasive source for early detection of metastasis, monitoring of therapeutic effects and basic research addressing the mechanism of metastasis. In this study, we developed a new filtration-based, sensitive CTC isolation device. This device consists of a 3-dimensional (3D) palladium (Pd) filter with an 8 µm-sized pore in the lower layer and a 30 µm-sized pocket in the upper layer to trap CTCs on a filter micro-fabricated by precise lithography plus electroforming process. This is a simple pump-less device driven by gravity flow and can enrich CTCs from whole blood within 20 min. After on-device staining of CTCs for 30 min, the filter cassette was removed from the device, fixed in a cassette holder and set up on the upright fluorescence microscope. Enumeration and isolation of CTCs for subsequent genetic analysis from the beginning were completed within 1.5 hr and 2 hr, respectively. Cell spike experiments demonstrated that the recovery rate of tumor cells from blood by this Pd filter device was more than 85%. Single living tumor cells were efficiently isolated from these spiked tumor cells by a micromanipulator, and KRAS mutation, HER2 gene amplification and overexpression, for example, were successfully detected from such isolated single tumor cells. Sequential analysis of blood from mice bearing metastasis revealed that CTC increased with progression of metastasis. Furthermore, a significant increase in the number of CTCs from the blood of patients with metastatic breast cancer was observed compared with patients without metastasis and healthy volunteers. These results suggest that this new 3D Pd filter-based device would be a useful tool for the rapid, cost effective and sensitive detection, enumeration, isolation and genetic analysis of CTCs from peripheral blood in both preclinical and clinical settings."
https://openalex.org/W2083450037,"The ability to obtain accurate and reproducible data using quantitative real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR) is limited by the process of data normalization. The use of 'housekeeping' or 'reference' genes is the most common technique used to normalize RT-qPCR data. However, commonly used reference genes are often poorly validated and may change as a result of genetic background, environment and experimental intervention. Here we present an analysis of 10 reference genes in mouse skeletal muscle (Actb, Aldoa, Gapdh, Hprt1, Ppia, Rer1, Rn18s, Rpl27, Rpl41 and Rpl7L1), which were identified as stable either by microarray or in the literature. Using the MIQE guidelines we compared wild-type (WT) mice across three genetic backgrounds (R129, C57BL/6j and C57BL/10) as well as analyzing the α-actinin-3 knockout (Actn3 KO) mouse, which is a model of the common null polymorphism (R577X) in human ACTN3. Comparing WT mice across three genetic backgrounds, we found that different genes were more tightly regulated in each strain. We have developed a ranked profile of the top performing reference genes in skeletal muscle across these common mouse strains. Interestingly the commonly used reference genes; Gapdh, Rn18s, Hprt1 and Actb were not the most stable. Analysis of our experimental variant (Actn3 KO) also resulted in an altered ranking of reference gene suitability. Furthermore we demonstrate that a poor reference gene results in increased variability in the normalized expression of a gene of interest, and can result in loss of significance. Our data demonstrate that reference genes need to be validated prior to use. For the most accurate normalization, it is important to test several genes and use the geometric mean of at least three of the most stably expressed genes. In the analysis of mouse skeletal muscle, strain and intervention played an important role in selecting the most stable reference genes."
https://openalex.org/W2058675599,"To what degree does being male or female influence the development of manual skills in pre-pubescent children? This question is important because of the emphasis placed on developing important new manual skills during this period of a child's education (e.g. writing, drawing, using computers). We investigated age and sex-differences in the ability of 422 children to control a handheld stylus. A task battery deployed using tablet PC technology presented interactive visual targets on a computer screen whilst simultaneously recording participant's objective kinematic responses, via their interactions with the on-screen stimuli using the handheld stylus. The battery required children use the stylus to: (i) make a series of aiming movements, (ii) trace a series of abstract shapes and (iii) track a moving object. The tasks were not familiar to the children, allowing measurement of a general ability that might be meaningfully labelled ‘manual control’, whilst minimising culturally determined differences in experience (as much as possible). A reliable interaction between sex and age was found on the aiming task, with girls' movement times being faster than boys in younger age groups (e.g. 4–5 years) but with this pattern reversing in older children (10–11 years). The improved performance in older boys on the aiming task is consistent with prior evidence of a male advantage for gross-motor aiming tasks, which begins to emerge during adolescence. A small but reliable sex difference was found in tracing skill, with girls showing a slightly higher level of performance than boys irrespective of age. There were no reliable sex differences between boys and girls on the tracking task. Overall, the findings suggest that prepubescent girls are more likely to have superior manual control abilities for performing novel tasks. However, these small population differences do not suggest that the sexes require different educational support whilst developing their manual skills."

In this study, sequential infection of RSV in the internal organs of SBPH after ingestion of virus indicated that RSV initially infected the midgut epithelium, and then progressed to the visceral muscle tissues, through which RSV spread to the entire alimentary canal. Finally, RSV spread into the salivary glands and reproductive system. During viral infection, the nonstructural protein NS4 of RSV formed cytoplasmic inclusions in various tissues of viruliferous SBPH. We demonstrated that the ribonucleoprotein particles of RSV were closely associated with NS4-specific inclusions in the body of viruliferous SBPH through a direct interaction between NS4 and nucleoprotein of RSV. Moreover, the knockdown of NS4 expression due to RNA interference induced by dsRNA from NS4 gene significantly prevented the spread of RSV in the bodies of SBPHs without a significant effect on viral replication in continuous cell culture derived from SBPH. All these results suggest that the nonstructural protein NS4 of RSV plays a critical role in viral spread by the vector insects."
https://openalex.org/W2056292494,"Investigate the patterns of mammographically detected calcifications before and after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) to determine their value for efficacy evaluation and surgical decision making.187 patients with malignant mammographic calcifications were followed to record the appearances and changes in the calcifications and to analyze their responses to NACT.Patients with calcifications had higher rates of hormonal receptor (HR) positive tumors (74.3% versus 64.6%) and HER2 positive tumors (51.3% versus 33.4%, p = 0.004) and a similar pathologic complete response (pCR) rate compared to patients without calcifications (35.4% versus 29.8%). After NACT, the range of calcification decreased in 40% of patients, increased in 7.5% and remained stable in 52.5%; the calcification density decreased in 15% of patients, increased in 7.5% and remained stable in 77.5%; none of these change patterns were related to tumor response rate. No significant correlation was observed between the calcification appearance (morphology, distribution, range, diameter or density) and tumor subtypes or pCR rates. Among patients with malignant calcifications, 54 showed calcifications alone, 40 occurred with an architectural distortion (AD) and 93 with a mass. Calcifications were observed inside the tumor in 44% of patients and outside in 56%, with similar pCR rates and patterns of change.Calcification appearance did not clearly change after NACT, and calcification patterns were not related to pCR rate, suggesting that mammogram may not accurate to evaluate tumor response changes. Microcalcifications visible after NACT is essential for determining the extent of excision, patients with calcifications that occurred outside of the mass still had the opportunity for breast conservation."
https://openalex.org/W2069288666,"This study aimed to compare fat oxidation, hormonal and plasma metabolite kinetics during exercise in lean (L) and obese (O) men. Sixteen L and 16 O men [Body Mass Index (BMI): 22.9 ± 0.3 and 39.0 ± 1.4 kg · m(-2)] performed a submaximal incremental test (Incr) on a cycle-ergometer. Fat oxidation rates (FORs) were determined using indirect calorimetry. A sinusoidal model, including 3 independent variables (dilatation, symmetry, translation), was used to describe fat oxidation kinetics and determine the intensity (Fat(max)) eliciting maximal fat oxidation. Blood samples were drawn for the hormonal and plasma metabolite determination at each step of Incr. FORs (mg · FFM(-1) · min(-1)) were significantly higher from 20 to 30% of peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak) in O than in L and from 65 to 85% VO2peak in L than in O (p ≤ 0.05). FORs were similar in O and in L from 35 to 60% VO2peak. Fat max was 17% significantly lower in O than in L (p<0.01). Fat oxidation kinetics were characterized by similar translation, significantly lower dilatation and left-shift symmetry in O compared with L (p<0.05). During whole exercise, a blunted lipolysis was found in O [lower glycerol/fat mass (FM) in O than in L (p ≤ 0.001)], likely associated with higher insulin concentrations in O than in L (p<0.01). Non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) were significantly higher in O compared with L (p<0.05). Despite the blunted lipolysis, O presented higher NEFA availability, likely due to larger amounts of FM. Therefore, a lower Fat(max), a left-shifted and less dilated curve and a lower reliance on fat oxidation at high exercise intensities suggest that the difference in the fat oxidation kinetics is likely linked to impaired muscular capacity to oxidize NEFA in O. These results may have important implications for the appropriate exercise intensity prescription in training programs designed to optimize fat oxidation in O."
https://openalex.org/W2008958414,"Leaves of various ages and positions in a plant's canopy can present distinct physiological, morphological and anatomical characteristics, leading to complexities in selecting a single leaf for spectral representation of an entire plant. A fortiori, as growth rates between canopies differ, spectral-based comparisons across multiple plants – often based on leaves' position but not age – becomes an even more challenging mission. This study explores the effect of differential growth rates on the reflectance variability between leaves of different canopies, and its implication on physiological predictions made by widely-used spectral indices. Two distinct irrigation treatments were applied for one month, in order to trigger the formation of different growth rates between two groups of grapevines. Throughout the experiment, the plants were physiologically and morphologically monitored, while leaves from every part of their canopies were spectrally and histologically sampled. As the control vines were constantly developing new leaves, the water deficit plants were experiencing growth inhibition, resulting in leaves of different age at similar nodal position across the treatments. This modification of the age-position correlation was characterized by a near infrared reflectance difference between younger and older leaves, which was found to be exponentially correlated (R2 = 0.98) to the age-dependent area of intercellular air spaces within the spongy parenchyma. Overall, the foliage of the control plant became more spectrally variable, creating complications for intra- and inter-treatment leaf-based comparisons. Of the derived indices, the Structure-Insensitive Pigment Index (SIPI) was found indifferent to the age-position effect, allowing the treatments to be compared at any nodal position, while a Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)-based stomatal conductance prediction was substantially affected by differential growth rates. As various biotic and abiotic factors may form distinctions in growth, future precision agriculture studies should consider its spectral effect on physiological predictions."
https://openalex.org/W2069374565,"Sleep disordered breathing (SDB), characterized by nightly intermittent hypoxia, is associated with multiple pathophysiologic alterations that may adversely affect patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). This prospective study investigated whether the metabolic perturbations associated with SDB are present when these patients develop AMI and if they affect clinical outcomes.We prospectively enrolled 180 AMI patients. SDB was defined as oxygen desaturation index (ODI) >5 events/hour based on a Watch Pat-100 sleep study. Blood samples were obtained for high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and markers of oxidative stress (lipid peroxides [PD] and serum paraoxonase-1 [PON-1] (arylesterase activity). Echocardiography was performed to evaluate cardiac dimensions and pulmonary artery systolic pressure.SDB was present in 116 (64%) patients. Hs-CRP levels, PD and PON-1 were similar in patients with and without SDB. Echocardiography revealed higher left atrial dimension (4.1 ± 0.5 vs 3.8 ± 0.5 cm; P = 0.003) and a significant positive correlation between ODI and pulmonary artery systolic pressure (r = 0.41, P<0.0001). After a median follow up of 68 months, no significant differences were observed between the study groups with regard to clinical outcomes, including death, heart failure, myocardial infarction and unstable angina.There is a high prevalence of previously undiagnosed SDB among patients with AMI. SDB in the setting of AMI is associated with higher pulmonary artery systolic pressure. SDB was not associated with adverse clinical outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2007676352,"Non-generic feedback refers to a specific event and implies that performance is malleable, while generic feedback implies that task performance reflects an inherent ability. The present study examined the influences of generic versus non-generic feedback on motor performance and learning in 10-year-old children. In the first experiment, using soccer ball kicking at a target as a task, providing participants with generic feedback resulted in worse performance than providing non-generic feedback, after both groups received negative feedback. The second experiment measured more permanent effects. Results of a retention test, performed one day after practicing a throwing task, showed that participants who received non-generic feedback during practice outperformed the generic feedback group, after receiving a negative feedback statement. The findings demonstrate the importance of the wording of feedback. Even though different positive feedback statements may not have an immediate influence on performance, they can affect performance, and presumably individuals' motivation, when performance is (purportedly) poor. Feedback implying that performance is malleable, rather than due to an inherent ability, seems to have the potential to inoculate learners against setbacks – a situation frequently encountered in the context of motor performance and learning."
https://openalex.org/W2007744660,"Anti-glycan/ganglioside antibodies are the most common immune effectors found in patients with Guillain-Barré Syndrome, which is a peripheral autoimmune neuropathy. We previously reported that disease-relevant anti-glycan autoantibodies inhibited axon regeneration, which echo the clinical association of these antibodies and poor recovery in Guillain-Barré Syndrome. However, the specific molecular and cellular elements involved in this antibody-mediated inhibition of axon regeneration are not previously defined. This study examined the role of Fcγ receptors and macrophages in the antibody-mediated inhibition of axon regeneration. A well characterized antibody passive transfer sciatic nerve crush and transplant models were used to study the anti-ganglioside antibody-mediated inhibition of axon regeneration in wild type and various mutant and transgenic mice with altered expression of specific Fcγ receptors and macrophage/microglia populations. Outcome measures included behavior, electrophysiology, morphometry, immunocytochemistry, quantitative real-time PCR, and western blotting. We demonstrate that the presence of autoantibodies, directed against neuronal/axonal cell surface gangliosides, in the injured mammalian peripheral nerves switch the proregenerative inflammatory environment to growth inhibitory milieu by engaging specific activating Fcγ receptors on recruited monocyte-derived macrophages to cause severe inhibition of axon regeneration. Our data demonstrate that the antibody orchestrated Fcγ receptor-mediated switch in inflammation is one mechanism underlying inhibition of axon regeneration. These findings have clinical implications for nerve repair and recovery in antibody-mediated immune neuropathies. Our results add to the complexity of axon regeneration in injured peripheral and central nervous systems as adverse effects of B cells and autoantibodies on neural injury and repair are increasingly recognized."
https://openalex.org/W1972349872,"By genetic inactivation of key microRNA biogenesis enzymes, we and others have previously demonstrated the critical requirement of the microRNA pathway for the differentiation and function of Foxp3+ regulatory T cells. In this study, we identified members of the miR-17∼92a cluster of microRNAs to be enriched in regulatory T cells. To investigate the function of this microRNA cluster, we deleted the gene specifically in Foxp3+ cells in mice. We found that miR-17∼92a is required for the fitness of regulatory T cells, and deficiency impacted at the level of apoptosis and proliferation of these cells. This led to a loss of Foxp3+ cells over time, particularly in competitive settings, and culminated in a range of immunologic perturbations. Thus, miR-17∼92a-target interactions are part of the essential microRNA networks that safeguard the regulatory T cell lineage."
https://openalex.org/W2056136674,"Background Endothelin-1 participates in the pathophysiology of heart failure. The reasons for the lack of beneficial effect of endothelin antagonists in heart failure patients remain however speculative. The anti-apoptotic properties of ET-1 on cardiomyocytes could be a reasonable explanation. We therefore hypothesized that blocking the pro-apoptotic TNF-α pathway using pentoxifylline could prevent the deleterious effect of the lack of ET-1 in a model for heart failure. Methods We performed transaortic constriction (TAC) in vascular endothelial cells specific ET-1 deficient (VEETKO) and wild type (WT) mice (n = 5–9) and treated them with pentoxifylline for twelve weeks. Results TAC induced a cardiac hypertrophy in VEETKO and WT mice but a reduction of fractional shortening could be detected by echocardiography in VEETKO mice only. Cardiomyocyte diameter was significantly increased by TAC in VEETKO mice only. Pentoxifylline treatment prevented cardiac hypertrophy and reduction of fractional shortening in VEETKO mice but decreased fractional shortening in WT mice. Collagen deposition and number of apoptotic cells remained stable between the groups as did TNF-α, caspase-3 and caspase-8 messenger RNA expression levels. TAC surgery enhanced ANP, BNP and bcl2 expression. Pentoxifylline treatment reduced expression levels of BNP, bcl2 and bax. Conclusions Lack of endothelial ET-1 worsened the impact of TAC-induced pressure overload on cardiac function, indicating the crucial role of ET-1 for normal cardiac function under stress. Moreover, we put in light a TNF-α-independent beneficial effect of pentoxifylline in the VEETKO mice suggesting a therapeutic potential for pentoxifylline in a subpopulation of heart failure patients at higher risk."
https://openalex.org/W2044259614,"The furosemide-sensitive Na(+)-K(+)-2Cl(-) cotransporter (NKCC2) is responsible for urine concentration and helps maintain systemic salt homeostasis. Its activity depends on trafficking to, and insertion into, the apical membrane, as well as on phosphorylation of conserved N-terminal serine and threonine residues. Vasopressin (AVP) signaling via PKA and other kinases activates NKCC2. Association of NKCC2 with lipid rafts facilitates its AVP-induced apical translocation and activation at the surface. Lipid raft microdomains typically serve as platforms for membrane proteins to facilitate their interactions with other proteins, but little is known about partners that interact with NKCC2. Yeast two-hybrid screening identified an interaction between NKCC2 and the cytosolic protein, annexin A2 (AnxA2). Annexins mediate lipid raft-dependent trafficking of transmembrane proteins, including the AVP-regulated water channel, aquaporin 2. Here, we demonstrate that AnxA2, which binds to phospholipids in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner and may organize microdomains, is codistributed with NKCC2 to promote its apical translocation in response to AVP stimulation and low chloride hypotonic stress. NKCC2 and AnxA2 interact in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. Phosphomimetic AnxA2 carrying a mutant phosphoacceptor (AnxA2-Y24D-GFP) enhanced surface expression and raft association of NKCC2 by 5-fold upon low chloride hypotonic stimulation, whereas AnxA2-Y24A-GFP and PKC-dependent AnxA2-S26D-GFP did not. As the AnxA2 effect involved only nonphosphorylated NKCC2, it appears to affect NKCC2 trafficking. Overexpression or knockdown experiments further supported the role of AnxA2 in the apical translocation and surface expression of NKCC2. In summary, this study identifies AnxA2 as a lipid raft-associated trafficking factor for NKCC2 and provides mechanistic insight into the regulation of this essential cotransporter."
https://openalex.org/W2054601124,"The small GTP-binding protein Arf6 reorganizes the actin cytoskeleton through the regulation of Rac activity. We identified FilGAP, a Rac-specific Rho GTPase-activating protein that is recruited to plasma membranes by binding to activated Arf6. FilGAP binds to Arf6 through its pleckstrin homology domain. Activated Arf6 stimulated RacGAP activity of FilGAP, and knockdown of endogenous Arf6 by siRNA suppresses FilGAP-mediated bleb formation. Mutant FilGAP lacking phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) binding (FilGAP R39C) binds to activated Arf6 and induces bleb formation. Moreover, bleb formation induced by wild-type FilGAP occurs in the presence of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitors, suggesting a PIP3-independent interaction between FilGAP and Arf6. We propose that FilGAP may function as a mediator of the regulation of Rac by Arf6."
https://openalex.org/W2029135576,"Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) induces phosphorylation of Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) at tyrosine 759 and subsequently triggers signaling pathways to promote interferon-β (IFN-β) production. In this study, we found that dsRNA stimulation induces biphasic TLR3 Tyr-759 phosphorylation in macrophages. In addition to the immediate TLR3 Tyr-759 phosphorylation, we identified a second wave of Tyr-759 phosphorylation accompanied by an increase of both Src and ifn-β transcription in the later phase of dsRNA stimulation. Interestingly, Src phosphorylated TLR3 Tyr-759 in vitro and in vivo. However, knockdown of Src abolished the late phase of TLR3 Tyr-759 phosphorylation and decreased the nuclear accumulation of interferon regulatory factors 3 and 7 (IRF3 and -7) and IFN-β production. Reintroduction of Src restored all of these molecular changes. Notably, via down-regulation of Src, dsRNA-elicited TLR3 Tyr-759 phosphorylation, the nuclear accumulation of IRF3/IRF7, and IFN-β generation were inhibited in inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS)-null macrophages. TLR3 knockdown destabilized Src and reduced the nuclear level of IRF3/IRF7 and IFN-β production in macrophages exposed to LPS (a TLR4 ligand known to induce Src and IFN-β expression). Ectopic expression of wild type TLR3, but not its 759-phenylalanine mutant, restored Src activity and ifn-β transcription.

IFN-I comprises the interferon (IFN)-α family and IFN-β and exerts a vast spectrum of biological functions. One of the well characterized functions of IFN-I is its inhibitory effect on the replication of viruses (6.Borden E.C. Sen G.C. Uze G. Silverman R.H. Ransohoff R.M. Foster G.R. Stark G.R.

Phosphorylation of five tyrosine residues on TLR3 (i.e. Tyr-733, Tyr-756, Tyr-759, Tyr-764, and Tyr-858) had been shown to participate in dsRNA-induced gene expression (26.Sarkar S.N. Smith H.L.

However, whether Src is involved in TLR3 Tyr-759 phosphorylation and antiviral response in dsRNA-stimulated macrophages is still unclear. In this study, we found that dsRNA induced a biphasic (early versus late) TLR3 Tyr-759 phosphorylation in macrophages. Src could directly phosphorylate TLR3 Tyr-759 in vitro. Src-mediated late TLR3 Tyr-759 phosphorylation led to the nuclear accumulation of IRF3/IRF7 and the increment of IFN-β production. Studies conducted with wild-type (WT) and iNOS knock-out (iNOS−/−) macrophages provided further evidence regarding the concomitant induction of Src and IFN-β as well as the increased TLR3 Tyr-759 phosphorylation by a NO-mediated pathway. Remarkably, the Src-mediated TLR3 Tyr-759 phosphorylation and IFN-β generation also occurred in TLR4-engaged macrophages. Moreover, knockdown or knockout of TLR3 reduced the stability of Src- and TLR4-dependent IFN-β production. Thus, the significance of iNOS/Src/TLR3 axis in IFN-β production in macrophages is established.

Briefly, they were collected by peritoneal lavage from rats (Sprague-Dawley) or mice given an intraperitoneal injection of 8 ml and 1 ml of thioglycollate broth, respectively, 4 days before harvest. The PEMs were washed with Ca2+- and Mg2+-free phosphate-buffered saline and plated in fetal calf serum-containing RPMI medium for 6 h. Then the cells were washed with medium to remove non-adherent cells. The resultant macrophage monolayer with greater than 98% purity, evaluated by morphology and phagocytosis property, was used for experiments. Bone marrow-derived macrophages were collected and differentiated as described previously (24.Maa M.C. Chang M.Y. Li J. Li Y.Y. Hsieh M.Y. Yang C.J. Chen Y.J. Li Y. Chen H.C. Cheng W.E. Hsieh C.Y.

To generate siTLR3-2 cells transiently expressing human TLR3 and 759F-TLR3, plasmid DNA of pCMV/hTLR3 and pCMV/hTLR3–759F were transfected into siTLR3-2 cells, respectively, by the Lipofectamine Plus method (Invitrogen). Cell lysis was carried out with modified radioimmune precipitation assay buffers as described previously (24.Maa M.C. Chang M.Y. Li J. Li Y.Y. Hsieh M.Y. Yang C.J. Chen Y.J. Li Y. Chen H.C.

Protein concentration was determined by a BCA protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). Western immunoblots were performed with the respective antibody and detected by the enhanced chemiluminescence method (Millipore). For immunoprecipitation, lysates were immunoprecipitated with Src or other relevant antibody with the method described before (24.Maa M.C. Chang M.Y. Li J. Li Y.Y. Hsieh M.Y. Yang C.J. Chen Y.J.

Cells were seeded onto 96-well plates at 2 × 105 cells/ml and stimulated with or without poly(I:C) (20 μg/ml), SNAP (100 μm) or 8-Br-cGMP (100 μm) for various times, as indicated. IFN-β concentration in the supernatants was measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The ELISA kit for murine IFN-β was purchased from PBL Biomedical Laboratories. The in vitro Src kinase reaction was performed as described previously (33.Maa M.C. Lai J.R. Lin R.W. Leu T.H. Enhancement of tyrosyl phosphorylation and protein expression of eps8 by v-Src.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1450: 341-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Briefly, TLR3 was immunoprecipitated from lysates (1.5 mg) of RAW264.7 cells. The immunoprecipitates were equally divided into three parts, which were either left alone or incubated with purified baculovirus-expressed human c-Src (UBI) for 10 or 30 min in the kinase buffer, as suggested by the manufacturer. The amount of ifn-β, nos2, src, tlr3, and gapdh transcript was semiquantitated by RT-PCR. Sequences of primer pairs used were as follows: ifn-β, 5′-CATCAACTATAAGCAGCTCCA-3′ (forward) and 5′-TTCAAGTGGAGAGCAGTTGAG-3′ (reverse); nos2, 5′-GCCTTCAACACCAAGGTTGTCTGCA-3′ (forward) and 5′-TCATTGTACTCTGAGGGCTGACACA-3′ (reverse); src, 5′-CTGCTGGACTTTCTCAAGGG-3′ (forward) and 5′-GTACAGAGCAGCTTCAGGGG-3′ (reverse); tlr3, 5′-CTCTTGAACAACGCCCAACT-3′ (forward) and 5′-GTCCACTTCAGCCCAGAGAA-3′ (reverse); gapdh, 5′-CCATCAC-CATCTTCCAGGAG-3′ (forward) and 5′-CCTGCTTCACCACCTTCTTG-3′ (reverse). PCR products were resolved in 2% agarose gel and detected by ethidium bromide staining. Each experiment was performed at least three times. Unless indicated, the results were presented as means + S.D. from a representative triplicate experiment. The significance of difference was assessed by Student's t test. Bonferroni correction was used for controlling type I error in multiple comparisons. Previously, TLR3 Tyr-759 phosphorylation was demonstrated to be essential in dsRNA-elicited activation of PI3K and full activation of IRF3 (18.Sarkar S.N. Peters K.L. Elco C.P. Sakamoto S. Pal S. Sen G.C. Novel roles of TLR3 tyrosine phosphorylation and PI3 kinase in double-stranded RNA signaling.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 1060-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Here, a time course study with Western immunoblotting revealed two phases of TLR3 Tyr-759 phosphorylation occurring in poly(I:C)-treated macrophages. Whereas the first phase (early) appeared within 10 min (∼0.17 h) and then declined, the second phase (late) gradually appeared at the 6-h time point and was sustained in PEMs exposed to dsRNA (Fig. 1A, left). Similar results were observed in RAW264.7 cells exposed to dsRNA (Fig. 1A, right). The biphasic Tyr-759 phosphorylation of TLR3 was also detected in the immunoprecipitated TLR3 prepared from RAW264.7 cells exposed to dsRNA (Fig. 1B). Because the late TLR3 Tyr-759 phosphorylation occurred together with the enhanced Src protein expression and kinase activity (as reflected by FAK Tyr(P)-861) (23.Maa M.C. Chang M.Y. Chen Y.J.

To test this hypothesis, we examined the level of TLR3 Tyr-759 phosphorylation at different time points (i.e. 0.17, 1, and 24 h) in dsRNA-stimulated RAW264.7-based control cells (Ctrl), Src-deficient cells (siSrc-1), and Src-deficient cells expressing avian Src (siSrc-1/Src15) (avian c-src mRNA contains sequences that were not recognized by the applied small interfering RNA) (23.Maa M.C.

Chem. 2008; 283: 31408-31416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1C, the late but not the early TLR3 Tyr-759 phosphorylation was affected by Src silencing, and this effect was reversed by the ectopic expression of Src. Of note, TLR3 could associate with Src in RAW264.7 cells overexpressing Src (siSrc-1/Src6) (Fig. 2A) or fibroblasts with (IV5) or without (Neo) v-Src (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, an in vitro kinase reaction was performed with immunoprecipitated TLR3 incubated with or without baculovirus-expressed active Src for 10 and 30 min. As shown in Fig. 2C, tyrosyl phosphorylation of TLR3 was undetected in the absence of Src. In contrast, the level of tyrosyl-phosphorylated TLR3 and TLR3 Tyr-759 phosphorylation was elevated in the presence of Src in a time-dependent manner, suggesting that Src might"
https://openalex.org/W2073948776,"The RNA synthesis machinery of non-segmented negative-sense RNA viruses comprises a ribonucleoprotein complex of the genomic RNA coated by a nucleocapsid protein (N) and associated with polymerase. Work with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), a prototype, supports a model of RNA synthesis whereby N is displaced from the template to allow the catalytic subunit of the polymerase, the large protein (L) to gain access to the RNA. Consistent with that model, purified L can copy synthetic RNA that contains requisite promoter sequences. Full processivity of L requires its phosphoprotein cofactor and the template-associated N. Here we demonstrate the importance of the 2' position of the RNA template and the substrate nucleotide triphosphates during initiation and elongation by L. The VSV polymerase can initiate on both DNA and RNA and can incorporate dNTPs. During elongation, the polymerase is sensitive to 2' modifications, although dNTPs can be incorporated, and mixed DNA-RNA templates can function. Modifications to the 2' position of the NTP, including 2',3'-ddCTP, arabinose-CTP, and 2'-O-methyl-CTP, inhibit polymerase, whereas 2'-amino-CTP is incorporated. The inhibitory effects of the NTPs were more pronounced on authentic N-RNA with the exception of dGTP, which is incorporated. This work underscores the sensitivity of the VSV polymerase to nucleotide modifications during initiation and elongation and highlights the importance of the 2'-hydroxyl of both template and substrate NTP. Moreover, this study demonstrates a critical role of the template-associated N protein in the architecture of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase domain of L."

The aim of the present study was to investigate the tumoral chromogranin A (CgA)-derived peptide WE-14 and the potential advantage to combine plasma WE-14 detection with the EM66 assay and the existing current CgA assay for the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma. Compared to healthy volunteers, plasma WE-14 levels were 5.4-fold higher in patients with pheochromocytoma, but returned to normal values after surgical resection of the tumor. Determination of plasma CgA and EM66 concentrations in the same group of patients revealed that the test assays for these markers had an overall 84% diagnostic sensitivity, which is identical to that determined for WE-14. However, we found that WE-14 measurement improved the diagnostic sensitivity when combined with the results of CgA or EM66 assays. By combining the results of the three assays, the sensitivity for the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma was increased to 95%. In fact, the combination of WE-14 with either CgA or EM66 test assays achieved 100% sensitivity for the diagnosis of paragangliomas and sporadic or malignant pheochromocytomas if taken separately to account for the heterogeneity of the tumor. These data indicate that WE-14 is produced in pheochromocytoma and secreted into the general circulation, and that elevated plasma WE-14 levels are correlated with the occurrence of this chromaffin cell tumor. In addition, in association with other biological markers, such as CgA and/or EM66, WE-14 measurement systematically improves the diagnostic sensitivity for pheochromocytoma. These findings support the notion that granin-processing products may represent complementary tools for the diagnosis of neuroendocrine tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2003164186,"The complex MalFGK2 hydrolyzes ATP and alternates between inward- and outward-facing conformations during maltose transport. It has been shown that ATP promotes closure of MalK2 and opening of MalFG toward the periplasm. Yet, why the transporter rests in a conformation facing the cytosol in the absence of nucleotide and how it returns to this state after hydrolysis of ATP is unknown. The membrane domain MalFG may be naturally stable in the inward-facing conformation, or the ABC domain may catalyze the transition. We address this question by analyzing the conformation of MalFG in nanodiscs and in proteoliposomes. We find that MalFG alone exists in an intermediate state until MalK binds and converts the membrane domain to the inward-facing state. We also find that MalK, if overly-bound to MalFG, blocks the transition of the transporter, whereas suppressor mutations that weaken this association restore transport. MalK therefore exploits hydrolysis of ATP to reverse the conformation of MalFG to the inward-facing conformation, a step essential for release of maltose in the cytosol."

Spanning all species of bacteria, there are thousands of HK/RR systems in which HK identifies varied specific signal molecules that triggers its autophosphorylation, and RR receives the phosphoryl group transferred from HK to activate or repress target gene transcription (1.Heermann R.

The typical histidine kinase is a transmembrane protein comprising an N-terminal sensor domain that identifies and senses signals and a conserved C-terminal cytoplasmic kinase transmitter domain. Based on the architecture of the N-terminal sensor domain, HKs are classified into three major groups (2.Mascher T. Helmann J.D. Unden G.

Now thousands of HKs have been identified in bacteria, fungi, archaea, yeast, and some plants, however, because many HKs have complicated membrane-spanning domains that have made structural analyses particularly difficult, and only a handful of ligands have been defined for HKs, analyses of ligand-receptor interactions are still limited to a few HKs with well defined periplasmic sensing domains and known ligands (3.Cheung J.

Depending on structural analysis, histidine kinase periplasmic sensor domains may be mixed α-β-folds, all α-folds, or sensor domains similar to HK29s (13.Cheung J. Hendrickson W.A. Sensor domains of two-component regulatory systems.Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2010; 13: 116-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Group 2 HKs that contain multiple transmembrane segments often lack obvious extracellular sensory domains and show little conservation, thus, little is known about how the ligand-sensor interacts with each other and ligand binding affects signaling activity in this important class of histidine kinases. Lantibiotics are usually lactic acid bacteria or actinobacteria produced and ribosomally synthesized antimicrobial peptides containing unusual amino acids, such as dehydrated and lanthionine residues that are post-translationally modified (14.McAuliffe O. Ross R.P. Hill C. Lantibiotics: structure, biosynthesis and mode of action.FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2001; 25: 285-308Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The biosynthesis of some lantibiotics including nisin, subtilin, salivaricin, SA-FF22, mersacidine, bovicin HJ50 and so on are regulated by a two-component system LanK/R. LanKs are involved in identifying extracellular signals to initiate phosphate transfer cascade to activate correlated downstream gene expression, such as the lantibiotic biosynthesis structural gene lanA, the immunity gene lanIFEG, or the regulatory gene lanRK. Some lantibiotics were also reported to function as the inducer of their own biosynthesis through the LanK/R system (15.Wescombe P.A. Upton M. Dierksen K.P. Ragland N.L. Sivabalan S. Wirawan R.E.

Bovicin HJ50 is a type AII lantibiotic consisting of 33 amino acids produced by Streptococcus bovis (S. bovis) HJ50. It shows a typical linear N terminus and globular C terminus structure of lantibiotics in lacticin group 481, which is the largest group and contains a specific disulfide bridge rarely seen in other lantibiotics (22.Xiao H. Chen X. Chen M. Tang S. Zhao X. Huan L. Bovicin HJ50, a novel lantibiotic produced by Streptococcus bovis HJ50.Microbiology. 2004; 150: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Bovicin HJ50 was initially synthesized as BovA, which consists of an N-terminal leader peptide and a C-terminal propeptide. The propeptide moiety was then post-translationally modified by BovM, and two threonine residues were dehydrated to be (Z)-2,3-didehydrobutyrines and cyclized with cysteine thiols resulting in two 3-methyllanthionines (Abu-S-Ala, in which Abu is an aminobutyric acid) to form thioether rings A and B. Ring C, which is a disulfide ring, is also formed. The mature bovicin HJ50 is produced by the removal of leader peptide from modified prepeptide by the specific protease BovT and translocated across the cytoplasmic membranes. Our previous study (20.Ni J. Teng K. Liu G. Qiao C. Huan L. Zhong J. Autoregulation of lantibiotic bovicin HJ50 biosynthesis by the BovK-BovR two-component signal transduction system in Streptococcus bovis HJ50.Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2011; 77: 407-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) revealed that bovicin HJ50 acts as the extracellular inducer to autoregulate the transcription of its own structural gene bovA through a unique BovK/R two-component system. However, it remains unclear how bovicin HJ50 binds to BovK and activates BovK/R to start the signal transduction. BovK is a group 2 histidine kinase with eight transmembrane segments in its N terminus and no apparent extracytoplasmic sensory domain. Here we labeled bovicin HJ50 with biotin and observed that bovicin HJ50 could interact with BovK N-terminal sensor domain. We performed a saturated alanine scanning mutagenesis of bovicin HJ50 by a semi-in vitro biosynthesis (23.Lin Y. Teng K. Huan L. Zhong J. Dissection of the bridging pattern of bovicin HJ50, a lantibiotic containing a characteristic disulfide bridge.Microbiol. Res. 2011; 166: 146-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), as well as different substitutions of key amino acids, and examined their inducing abilities. Meanwhile, several charged amino acids and a conserved hydrophobic region in the sixth membrane segment of BovK were observed and found to be involved in identifying bovicin HJ50 to carry on the lantibiotic signal transduction. We proposed a model for the interaction of bovicin HJ50 and BovK. Strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in supplemental Table S1. S. bovis HJ50 and derivatives were routinely cultured in M17 medium supplemented with 0.5% (w/v) glucose (GM17 medium) at 37 °C. Escherichia coli DH5α, BL21, and MC1061 used as hosts for cloning procedures were maintained in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth at 37 °C. Micrococcus flavus NCIB8166 was maintained in SI medium (0.8% tryptone (w/v), 0.5% yeast extract (w/v), 0.5% glucose (w/v), 0.2% disodium hydrogen phosphate (w/v), 0.5% sodium chloride (w/v), 0.1% Tween 20 (v/v)) at 30 °C. Where appropriate, antibiotics were added as follows: kanamycin, 50 μg/ml (E. coli); chloramphenicol, 10 (E. coli) and 5 μg/ml (S. bovis); or erythromycin, 100 (E. coli) and 5 μg/ml (S. bovis). The main plasmids and primers used in this study are listed in supplemental Tables S1 and S2, respectively. pET-bovAM co-expression plasmid and site-directed mutagenesis were constructed as described (23.Lin Y. Teng K. Huan L. Zhong J. Dissection of the bridging pattern of bovicin HJ50, a lantibiotic containing a characteristic disulfide bridge.Microbiol. Res. 2011; 166: 146-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). To disrupt bovKR, two fragments flanking bovKR genes were amplified with primers KR-LF/KR-LR and KR-RF/KR-RR and then subcloned into pSET5s to yield pDKR. An erythromycin resistance cassette digested by BamHI from the temperature-sensitive plasmid pDX (24.Liu G. Zhong J. Ni J. Chen M. Xiao H. Huan L. Characteristics of the bovicin HJ50 gene cluster in Streptococcus bovis HJ50.Microbiology. 2009; 155: 584-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) was isolated and cloned into pDKR to create plasmid pDEKR. BovKR disruption mutant DKR strain was produced by transformation of pDEKR to S. bovis HJ50 and obtained as described (20.Ni J. Teng K. Liu G. Qiao C. Huan L. Zhong J. Autoregulation of lantibiotic bovicin HJ50 biosynthesis by the BovK-BovR two-component signal transduction system in Streptococcus bovis HJ50.Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2011; 77: 407-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). To complement bovKR expression in the DKR strain, the 205-bp P32 promoter and the downstream bovKR DNA fragments were amplified and cloned into pSET1 to construct the pSET1-bovKR plasmid. Site-directed mutagenesis of bovK was performed according to the protocols reported (25.Chiu J. Tillett D. Dawes I.W. March P.E. Site-directed, ligase-independent mutagenesis (SLIM) for highly efficient mutagenesis of plasmids greater than 8 kb.J. Microbiol. Methods. 2008; 73: 195-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), generating a series of pSET1-bovKR derivatives. Bovicin HJ50 and its mutants were produced by semi-in vitro biosynthesis as described (23.Lin Y. Teng K. Huan L. Zhong J. Dissection of the bridging pattern of bovicin HJ50, a lantibiotic containing a characteristic disulfide bridge.Microbiol. Res. 2011; 166: 146-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Briefly, E. coli BL21(DE3) cells containing pET-bovAM were incubated at 37 °C and protein expressions were induced by 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside when A600 reached 0.6. The culture was grown at 18 °C for 20 h. The cells were sonicated and the His6-tagged modified prepeptide BovAm was purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid chelating resin. Using immobilized metal affinity chromatography, BovAm was enriched and purified. The protease BovT150 was expressed and purified by the similar procedures. Purified His6-BovAm and BovT150 were co-incubated at 25 °C overnight to remove the leader peptide of BovAm. The mature peptide bovicin HJ50 was separated by HPLC and the molecular weight was identified using MALDI-TOF MS. Overnight cultures of the S. bovis HJ50 DM strain were diluted 1:30 in fresh GM17. When A600 of the cells reached ∼0.4, bovicin HJ50 and the mutants purified as described previously were added to the culture (100 ng/ml), if required. The cells were further incubated for about 4 h and harvested by centrifugation. Total RNAs were isolated and quantitated as described (26.Sambrook J. Fritsch E. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: a Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). For quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR), each RNA sample was treated by DNase I (ThermoFisher) for 30 min at 37 °C to exclude contamination by DNA. Primers specific for bovA and 16 S rRNA of S. bovis HJ50 were designed. qRT-PCR was performed with SYBR Premix ExTag (TaKaRa) by Rotor-Gene Q (Qiagen) and all samples were analyzed in triplicate. Data were collected using Rotor-Gene Q Pure Detection software, normalized against endogenous 16 S rRNA gene levels, and calculated using the comparative cycle threshold method as described (27.Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Analysis of relative gene expression data using real-time quantitative PCR and the 2(−ΔΔ CT) method.Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (123336) Google Scholar). Analyzed data were presented as fold-changes over WT levels. Student's unpaired t test was used to determine statistical significance. A p value of ≤0.05 was considered significant. 2 mg of bovicin HJ50 was produced by semi-in vitro biosynthesis and labeled with biotin (Beijing Biosynthesis Biotechnology Co., Ltd.), the product that bovicin HJ50 labeled with one biotin molecule was purified by HPLC and identified by MALDI-TOF MS and named b-bovicin HJ50. 500 ml of S. bovis HJ50 cells with late-exponential phase were harvested and resuspended in ice-cold PBS buffer (NaCl, 137 mm; KCl, 2.7 mm; Na2HPO4, 10 mm; KH2PO4, 2 mm, pH 7.5) with 1 mm PMSF. After lysing by sonication, cells were centrifuged at 6,000 × g for 1 h to remove intact cells. The supernatant was ultracentrifuged at 120,000 × g for 2 h to separate soluble (cytoplasmic fraction) and insoluble (cell membrane fraction) proteins. The cytoplasmic portion of the BovK protein (cBovK, negative control) was purified as described (20.Ni J. Teng K. Liu G. Qiao C. Huan L. Zhong J. Autoregulation of lantibiotic bovicin HJ50 biosynthesis by the BovK-BovR two-component signal transduction system in Streptococcus bovis HJ50.Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2011; 77: 407-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Far Western blot assays were performed using a modified protocol as described by Wu et al. (28.Wu Y. Li Q. Chen X.Z. Detecting protein-protein interactions by far Western blotting.Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2: 3278-3284Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Briefly, the purified proteins were separated on a 12% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to a PVDF membrane on which the proteins were denatured and renatured. The membrane was blocked with 5% (w/v) milk in PBS and probed with b-bovicin HJ50, and then incubated with an antibody conjugated to streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (HRP). For Western blotting, a replicate membrane was probed with anti-cBovK primary antibodies (20.Ni J. Teng K. Liu G. Qiao C. Huan L. Zhong J. Autoregulation of lantibiotic bovicin HJ50 biosynthesis by the BovK-BovR two-component signal transduction system in Streptococcus bovis HJ50.Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2011; 77: 407-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) and then incubated with secondary antibodies conjugated to HRP. Interacting proteins or control proteins were detected by adding enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagents and visualized by x-ray film exposure. S. bovis HJ50 DKR and the complementary strains were cultured at 37 °C for 12 h, diluted by 1:30 in fresh GM17. When A600 of the cells reached ∼1.0, the culture supernatants were used to measure the bacteriocin activity against the indicator strain M. flavus NCIB8166 as described (29.Cintas L.M. Rodriguez J.M. Fernandez M.F. Sletten K. Nes I.F. Hernandez P.E. Holo H. Isolation and characterization of pediocin L50, a new bacteriocin from Pediococcus acidilactici with a broad inhibitory spectrum.Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1995; 61: 2643-2648Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The plate in which each well was filled with 20 μl of culture supernatant was incubated at 30 °C overnight, and the inhibition zones were examined. 500 ml of S. bovis HJ50 cells with late-exponential phase were harvested, washed with PBS buffer (pH 7.4), and resuspended in 20 ml of PBS buffer prior to cross-linking. A CuPhen (copper(II)-1,10-phenanthroline) stock solution was prepared by dissolving Cu(II)-SO4 and 1,10-phenanthroline (Acros Organics) in a 4:1 water/ethanol solution to concentrations of 150 and 500 mm, respectively. 20 μl (1:1000) of CuPhen stock was added to the cells and incubated with agitation at 20 °C for 20 min. Cells were harvested and lysed by sonication. Membrane proteins were isolated as described above, separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel, and transferred to a PVDF membrane. The proteins were treated with anti-cBovK primary antibodies and the secondary antibodies were conjugated to HRP. Proteins were detected by adding enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagents and visualized by x-ray film exposure. The mean residue molar ellipticities of bovicin HJ50 and mutants were determined in H2O and a helix-inducing 3% SDS solvent, respectively, at 25 °C by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy with a Chirascan plus circular dichroism detector (Applied Photophysics). 200 μl of peptide analogs (100 μg/ml) were loaded into a 1-mm Quartz SUPPASIL precision cell, and ellipticities were scanned from 200 to 260 nm. Analysis of the secondary structure was performed with CDNN software (version 2.1). Bovicin HJ50 contains a linear N terminus and a globular C terminus formed by two thioether rings (ring A and ring B) and a disulfide bridge (forming ring C), which is uncommon in lantibiotics (Fig. 1A). To clarify the importance of these rings for its inducing activity, bovicin HJ50 ring A, ring B, and ring C disruption mutants C13A, C21A, and C32A/T10A (Fig. 1B) were produced by a semi-in vitro biosynthesis. BovA mutants tagged by His6 at its N terminus and BovM were co-expressed in E. coli, and the modified prepeptide was purified by a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid chelating resin. After removing the leader peptide by the protease BovT150 in vitro, bovicin HJ50 mutants were separated by HPLC and their molecular weights were identified using MALDI-TOF MS (Table 1). The ring formation in bovicin HJ50 mutants were identified by their molecular mass compared with bovicin HJ50 wild type (molecular mass was 3428 Da). For example, the molecular mass of C13A was 3396 Da, 32 Da increased compared with bovicin HJ50 wild type, corresponding to the cysteine (121 Da) substitution of alanine (89 Da), and Abu (101 Da) positioned at 8 changing to (Z)-2,3-didehydrobutyrines (101 Da). Similarly, the molecular weight of C21A was 3398, corresponding to the broken disulfide bridge (two hydrogens were added to Cys-21 and Cys-29) and residue substitution at position 21 in ring B. The molecular weight of C32A/T10A was 3398, corresponding to residue substitutions and one molecular H2O (18 Da) was added at position 10 in ring C.TABLE 1The molecular mass of bovicin HJ50 and its mutantsNameMolecular massNameMolecular massDaDaBovicin HJ503428N15A3385C13A3396V16A3400C21A3398I17A3386C21S3414S18A3412C32A/T10A3384S19A3412D2A3384I20A3386R3A3343G23A3442G4A3442δG233371W5A3313T24A3398I6A3386I25A3386K7A3371I26A3386L9A3386T27A3398K11A3371K30A3371K11D3415K30D3415K11E3429K30E3429K11H3437K30H3437D12A3384K30R3456D12K3441N31A3385D12E3442δADRGW2843P14A3402 Open table in a new tab Our previous study (20.Ni J. Teng K. Liu G. Qiao C. Huan L. Zhong J. Autoregulation of lantibiotic bovicin HJ50 biosynthesis by the BovK-BovR two-component signal transduction system in Streptococcus bovis HJ50.Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2011; 77: 407-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) demonstrated that there is no bovA (structural gene encoding bovicin HJ50) mRNA transcript detected in the S. bovis DM strain (bovM encoding the bovicin HJ50 post-translational modification enzyme was knocked out from S. bovis HJ50), because the lack of modification enzyme BovM resulted in disruption of mature bovicin HJ50 production. When induced by bovicin HJ50, which is an autoinducer of its own structural gene bovA expression, the BovK protein expressed in the DM strain could identify and transduce the lantibiotic signal, and then activate bovA transcription. To examine the critical structure of bovicin HJ50 in activating BovK protein, bovicin HJ50 and its structural mutants were added to DM strain cells, and their inducing abilities were compared by monitoring the level of the bovA transcript. As shown in Fig. 1C, the abilities of bovicin HJ50 C21A and C32A/T10A to activate the expression of bovA were attenuated obviously, whereas C13A shows a similar inducing ability with bovicin HJ50 either extracted from S. bovis HJ50 or biosynthesized with semi-in vitro biosynthesis. The mutant C21S, another ring B disruption mutant (Fig. 1B), was also constructed and showed no inducing activity. These results demonstrated that ring A in bovicin HJ50 is not necessary to activate BovK to induce bovA expression, whereas both ring B and ring C are important for its inducing activity. A truncated mutant ΔADRGW in which five amino acids on the N terminus of bovicin HJ50 were deleted was further constructed and its inducing ability was also attenuated vigorously (Fig. 2B). These results indicated that the N terminus of bovicin HJ50 was also necessary and only ring BC was not enough to carry on its inducing activity. So the linear N terminus of at least the first five amino acids and the integrity of ring BC were necessary for bovicin HJ50 to interact with BovK to start the signal transduction. Meanwhile, the antimicrobial activities of all the ring disruption mutants were lost (Fig. 1D). To further identify the critical sites of bovicin HJ50 on activating BovK, we performed a saturated alanine scanning mutagenesis on bovicin HJ50. The analogs of bovicin HJ50 were biosynthesized by semi-in vitro biosynthesis and their inducing abilities were tested according to bovA expression in the S. bovis DM strain after induction. The abilities of several bovicin HJ50 analogs including G4A, K11A, D12A, I17A, I20A, G23A, and K30A to activate the expression of bovA were attenuated vigorously (Fig. 2, A and B). We next determined whether these seven analogs could competitively inhibit wild type bovicin HJ50, and found that all these analogs failed to inhibit bovicin HJ50-induced bovA expression (Fig. 2D). This result demonstrated that each substitution disrupted the binding of bovicin HJ50 to the receptor BovK. The substitution of each glycine residue at positions 4 and 23 in bovicin HJ50 could not induce its own biosynthesis, indicating that they were important to activate BovK to start the bovA expression. As glycine is the most flexible amino acid, we supposed that these two residues might contribute to conformation changing of bovicin HJ50 when interacted with the BovK protein. To make sure whether these two mutations affected bovicin HJ50 structural changes, circular dichroism (CD) spectra of G4A and G23A under H2O solvent and membrane conditions were recorded to assess their secondary structures. The results showed that in membrane conditions (3% SDS), the helical propensities of both mutants were increased (72.7–93.8 and 72.7–93.6%, respectively), whereas the anti-parallel, parallel, and random coils are obviously decreased (Table 2). Meanwhile there was no big difference between bovicin HJ50 and mutants in the H2O solvent (data not shown). These results indicated that Gly-4 and Gly-23 were important for bovicin HJ50 to change its conformation in the membrane to produce a matched structure for interacting with BovK.TABLE 2Relative contents of secondary structures in bovicin HJ50 analogsBovicin HJ50G4AG23AI17AI20AK11AD12AK30AHelix (%)72.793.893.683.382.667.574.578.4Antiparallel (%)2.60.70.71.71.73.12.62.0Parallel (%)20.50.51.21.22.51.81.6β-Turn (%)11.987.6"
https://openalex.org/W1999660896,"Following current recommendations for preventing retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) involves screening a large number of patients. We performed a prospective study to establish a useful screening system for ROP prediction and we have determined that measuring serum levels of IGF1 at week three and the presence of sepsis have a high predictive value for the subsequent development of ROP. A total of 145 premature newborn, with birthweight <1500 g and/or <32 weeks gestational age, were enrolled. 26.9% of them showed some form of retinopathy. A significant association was found between the development of retinopathy and each of the following variables: early gestational age, low birthweight, requiring mechanical ventilation, oxygen treatment, intracranial haemorrhage, sepsis during the first three weeks, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, the need for erythrocyte transfusion, erythropoietin treatment, and low levels of serum IGF1 in the third week. A multiple logistic regression analysis was used to obtain curves for the probability of developing ROP, based on the main factors linked with ROP, namely serum levels of IGF1 and presence of sepsis. Such preclinical screening has the ability to identify patients with high-risk of developing retinopathy and should lead to better prediction for ROP, while at the same time optimising the use of clinical resources, both human and material."
https://openalex.org/W2025170275,"Influenza A virus (IAV) can infect avian and mammalian species, including humans. The genome nature of IAVs may contribute to viral adaptation in different animal hosts, resulting in gene reassortment and the reproduction of variants with optimal fitness. As seen again in the 2009 swine-origin influenza A H1N1 pandemic, pigs are known to be susceptible to swine, avian, and human IAVs and can serve as a 'mixing vessel' for the generation of novel IAV variants. To this end, the emergence of swine influenza viruses must be kept under close surveillance. Herein, we report the isolation and phylogenetic study of a swine IAV, A/swine/Korea/PL01/2012 (swPL01, H3N2 subtype). After screening nasopharyngeal samples from pigs in the Gyeongsangnam-do region of Korea from December 2011 to May 2012, we isolated the swPL01 virus and sequenced its all of 8 genome segments (polymerase basic 2, PB2; polymerase basic 1, PB1; polymerase acidic, PA; hemagglutinin, HA; nucleocapsid protein, NP; neuraminidase, NA; matrix protein, M; and nonstructural protein, NS). The phylogenetic study, analyzed with reference strains registered in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database, indicated that the swPL01 virus was similar to the North American triple-reassortant swine strains and that the HA gene of the swPL01 virus was categorized into swine H3 cluster IV. The swPL01 virus had the M gene of the triple-reassortant swine H3N2 viruses, whereas that of other contemporary strains in Korea was transferred from the 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus. These data suggest the possibility that various swine H3N2 viruses may co-circulate in Korea, which underlines the importance of a sustained surveillance system against swine IAVs."
https://openalex.org/W2318414485,"Empirical studies of decision making have typically assumed that value learning is governed by time, such that a reward prediction error arising at a specific time triggers temporally-discounted learning for all preceding actions. However, in natural behavior, goals must be acquired through multiple actions, and each action can have different significance for the final outcome. As is recognized in computational research, carrying out multi-step actions requires the use of credit assignment mechanisms that focus learning on specific steps, but little is known about the neural correlates of these mechanisms. To investigate this question we recorded neurons in the monkey lateral intraparietal area (LIP) during a serial decision task where two consecutive eye movement decisions led to a final reward. The underlying decision trees were structured such that the two decisions had different relationships with the final reward, and the optimal strategy was to learn based on the final reward at one of the steps (the “F” step) but ignore changes in this reward at the remaining step (the “I” step). In two distinct contexts, the F step was either the first or the second in the sequence, controlling for effects of temporal discounting. We show that LIP neurons had the strongest value learning and strongest post-decision responses during the transition after the F step regardless of the serial position of this step. Thus, the neurons encode correlates of temporal credit assignment mechanisms that allocate learning to specific steps independently of temporal discounting."

Factors affecting [Ca2+]i include Ca2+-release from intracellular stores (CRIS), store-operated Ca2+-entry (SOCE) through STIM1/STIM2-regulated Orai1, K+-dependent Na+/Ca2+-exchangers (NCKX), K+-independent Na+/Ca2+-exchangers (NCX) and calbindin-D28k. The present study explored whether PKB/SGK-dependent GSK3α, β-activity impacts on CRIS, SOCE, NCKX, NCX or calbindin. DCs were isolated from gsk3KI mice and respective wild-type mice (gsk3WT), [Ca2+]i estimated from Fura2 fluorescence, Orai1, STIM1, STIM2 as well as calbindin-D28k protein abundance determined by Western blotting and mRNA levels quantified by real time PCR. As a result, thapsigargin-induced CRIS and SOCE were significantly blunted by GSK3-inhibitors SB216763 (1–10 µM, 30 min) or GSK-XIII (10 µM, 30 min) but were significantly lower in gsk3WT than in gsk3KIDCs. Orai1, STIM1 and STIM2 protein abundance was significantly lower and calbindin-D28k abundance significantly higher in gsk3KI than in gsk3WTDCs. Activity of NCKX and NCX was significantly higher in gsk3KI than in gsk3WTDCs and was significantly increased by SB216763 (1 µM, 30 min) or GSK-XIII (10 µM, 30 min). Treatment of gsk3WT DCs with SB216763 (1 µM, 4–24 h) or GSK-XIII (10 µM, 4–24 h) did not significantly modify the protein abundance of Orai1, STIM1 and STIM2. The present observations point to a dual role of GSK3 in the regulation of Ca2+ in DCs. Acute inhibition of GSK3 blunted the increase of [Ca2+]i following CRIS and SOCE and stimulated NCKX/NCX activity. However, expression of PKB/SGK-resistant GSK3α, β downregulated the increase of [Ca2+]i following CRIS and SOCE, an effect at least partially due to downregulation of Orai1, STIM1 and STIM2 expression as well as upregulation of Na+/Ca2+-exchanger activity and calbindin D28k expression."
https://openalex.org/W1979362833,"The detailed study of immune effector mechanisms in primate models of infectious disease has been limited by the inability to adoptively transfer lymphocytes from vaccinated animals into naïve immunocompetent recipients. Recent advances in our understanding of the Major Histocompatibility Complex diversity of Mauritian cynomolgus macaques enabled the establishment of a breeding program to generate Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC)-identical animals. The current study utilised this resource to achieve an improved model of adoptive transfer of lymphocytes in macaques. The effect of route of transfusion on persistence kinetics of adoptively transferred lymphocytes was evaluated in an autologous transfer system. Results indicated that peripheral persistence kinetics were comparable following infusion by different routes, and that cells were detectable at equivalent levels in lymphoid tissues six weeks post-infusion. In a pilot-scale experiment, the persistence of adoptively transferred lymphocytes was compared in MHC-identical siblings and MHC-identical unrelated recipients. Lymphocytes transferred intra-peritoneally were detectable in the periphery within one hour of transfer and circulated at detectable levels in the periphery and lymph nodes for 10 days. Donor lymphocytes were detectable at higher levels in MHC-identical siblings compared with unrelated animals, however the total time of persistence did not differ. These results demonstrate a further refinement of the lymphocyte adoptive transfer system in Mauritian cynomolgus macaques and provide a foundation for hitherto impractical experiments to investigate mechanisms of cellular immunity in primate models of infectious disease."
https://openalex.org/W2036485110,"We previously identified a high prevalence of Hepatitis C (HCV) amongst solvent-using injection drug users (S-IDU) relative to other injection drug users within the same locality. Here we incorporated social network variables to better characterize some of the behavioural characteristics that may be putting this specific subgroup of IDU at elevated disease risk.A cross-sectional survey of at-risk populations was carried out in Winnipeg, Canada in 2009. Individuals reporting any history of injection drug and/or solvent use were included in the study. Associations between subgroup membership, infection with HCV and HIV and individual and social network variables were examined.In relation to other IDU, S-IDU were more likely to be infected with HCV, to report ever having shared a syringe, and to associate with other IDU. They were further differentiated in terms of their self-reported sexual orientation, ethnicity and in the injection drugs typically used.Solvent use stands as a proxy measure of numerous other characteristics that put this group of IDU at higher risk of infection. Provision of adequate services to ostracized subpopulations may result in wider population-level benefits."
https://openalex.org/W2038925972,"The fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP4) plays an important role in the regulation of lipid metabolism in mammals. In this study, two regions of ovine FABP4 spanning exon 2-intron 2 and exon 3-intron 3 were investigated in four hundred and twenty lambs derived from seven sires that were previously typed as having heterozygous genotypes in both these regions of the gene. These regions have been shown to be variable, with three SNPs plus one indel and four SNPs respectively constituting five and four allele variants in the two regions. Across these regions, fourteen haplotypes have been identified. The lambs were typed using a Polymerase Chain Reaction Single-Stranded Conformational Polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) method to identify the haplotypes inherited from the sires. Between three and four paternally-derived haplotypes were identified in the progeny of six of the seven sires, suggesting that meiotic recombination occurs within ovine FABP4. A number of sequence motifs associated with recombination ""hotspots"" were detected in the two regions of the gene that were analyzed and these may facilitate the recombination."
https://openalex.org/W2045886054,"Sensory alterations, a common feature of such movement disorders as Parkinson's disease (PD) and dystonia, could emerge as epiphenomena of basal ganglia dysfunction. Recently, we found a selective reduction of tactile perception (Aristotle's illusion, the illusory doubling sensation of one object when touched with crossed fingers) in the affected hand of patients with focal hand dystonia. This suggests that reduced tactile illusion might be a specific feature of this type of dystonia and could be due to abnormal somatosensory cortical activation. The aim of the current study was to investigate whether Aristotle's illusion is reduced in the affected hand of patients with PD. We tested 15 PD patients, in whom motor symptoms were mainly localised to one side of the body, and 15 healthy controls. Three pairs of fingers were tested in crossed (evoking the illusion) or parallel position (not evoking the illusion). A sphere was placed in the contact point between the two fingers and the blindfolded participants had to say whether they felt one or two stimuli. Stimuli were applied on the affected and less or unaffected side of the PD patients. We found no difference in illusory perception between the PD patients and the controls, nor between the more affected and less/unaffected side, suggesting that Aristotle's illusion is preserved in PD. The retained tactile illusion in PD and its reduction in focal hand dystonia suggest that the basal ganglia, which are dysfunctional in both PD and dystonia, may not be causally involved in this function. Instead, the level of activation between digits in the somatosensory cortex may be more directly involved. Finally, the similar percentage of illusion in the more affected and less or unaffected body sides indicates that the illusory perception is not influenced by the presence or amount of motor symptoms."
