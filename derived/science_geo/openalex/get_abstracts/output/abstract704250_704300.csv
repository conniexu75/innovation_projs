https://openalex.org/W4309158972,"The open-circuit voltage (VOC) deficit in perovskite solar cells is greater in wide-bandgap (over 1.7 eV) cells than in perovskites of roughly 1.5 eV (refs. 1,2). Quasi-Fermi-level-splitting measurements show VOC-limiting recombination at the electron-transport-layer contact3–5. This, we find, stems from inhomogeneous surface potential and poor perovskite–electron transport layer energetic alignment. Common monoammonium surface treatments fail to address this; as an alternative, we introduce diammonium molecules to modify perovskite surface states and achieve a more uniform spatial distribution of surface potential. Using 1,3-propane diammonium, quasi-Fermi-level splitting increases by 90 meV, enabling 1.79 eV perovskite solar cells with a certified 1.33 V VOC and over 19% power conversion efficiency (PCE). Incorporating this layer into a monolithic all-perovskite tandem, we report a record VOC of 2.19 V (89% of the detailed balance VOC limit) and over 27% PCE (26.3% certified quasi-steady state). These tandems retained more than 86% of their initial PCE after 500 h of operation. Because open-circuit voltage deficit is greater in wide-bandgap perovskite solar cells, the authors introduce diammonium molecules to modify perovskite surface states and achieve a more uniform spatial distribution of surface potential, enabling record voltage all-perovskite tandem solar cells."
https://openalex.org/W4309047210,"Pharmacological inhibition of the Nod-like receptor family protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome contributes to the treatment of numerous inflammation-related diseases, making it a desirable drug target. Spirodalesol, derived from the ascomycete fungus Daldinia eschscholzii, has been reported to inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Based on the structure of spirodalesol, we synthesized and screened a series of analogs to find a more potent inhibitor. Analog compound 8A was identified as the most potent selective inhibitor for NLRP3 inflammasome assembly, but 8A did not inhibit the priming phase of the inflammasome. Specifically, while 8A did not reduce NLRP3 oligomerization, we found that it inhibited the oligomerization of adaptor protein apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase activation and recruitment domain (ASC), as ASC speck formation was significantly reduced. Also, 8A interrupted the assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome complex and inhibited the activation of caspase-1. Subsequently, we used a cellular thermal shift assay and microscale thermophoresis assay to demonstrate that 8A interacts directly with ASC, both in vitro and ex vivo. Further, 8A alleviated lipopolysaccharide-induced endotoxemia, as well as monosodium urate-induced peritonitis and gouty arthritis in mice by suppressing NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Thus, 8A was identified as a promising ASC inhibitor to treat inflammasome-driven diseases."
https://openalex.org/W4308998323,"Schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar disorder (BP) are highly heritable major psychiatric disorders that share a substantial portion of genetic risk as well as their clinical manifestations. This raises a fundamental question of whether, and how, common neurobiological pathways translate their shared polygenic risks into shared clinical manifestations. This study shows the miR-124-3p-AMPAR pathway as a key common neurobiological mediator that connects polygenic risks with behavioral changes shared between these two psychotic disorders. We discovered the upregulation of miR-124-3p in neuronal cells and the postmortem prefrontal cortex from both SZ and BP patients. Intriguingly, the upregulation is associated with the polygenic risks shared between these two disorders. Seeking mechanistic dissection, we generated a mouse model that upregulates miR-124-3p in the medial prefrontal cortex. We demonstrated that the upregulation of miR-124-3p increases GRIA2-lacking calcium-permeable AMPARs and perturbs AMPAR-mediated excitatory synaptic transmission, leading to deficits in the behavioral dimensions shared between SZ and BP."
https://openalex.org/W4309047401,"The autophagic clearance of mitochondria has been defined as mitophagy, which is triggered by mitochondrial damage and serves as a major pathway for mitochondrial homeostasis and cellular quality control. PINK1 and Parkin-mediated mitophagy is the most extensively studied form of mitophagy, which has been linked to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The current paradigm of this particular mitophagy pathway is that the ubiquitination of the outer mitochondrial membrane is the key step to enable the recognition of damaged mitochondria by the core autophagic component autophagosome. However, whether the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) is ubiquitinated by Parkin and its contribution to sufficient mitophagy remain unclear. Here, using molecular, cellular, and biochemical approaches, we report that prohibitin 2 (PHB2), an essential IMM receptor for mitophagy, is ubiquitinated by Parkin and thereby gains higher affinity to the autophagosome during mitophagy. Our findings suggest that Parkin directly binds to PHB2 through its RING1 domain and promotes K11- and K33-linked ubiquitination on K142/K200 sites of PHB2, thereby enhancing the interaction between PHB2 and MAP1LC3B/LC3B. Interestingly and importantly, our study allows us to propose a novel model in which IMM protein PHB2 serves as both a receptor and a ubiquitin-mediated base for autophagosome recruitment to ensure efficient mitophagy."
https://openalex.org/W4309047649,"Organisms must either synthesize or assimilate essential organic compounds to survive. The homocysteine synthase Met15 has been considered essential for inorganic sulfur assimilation in yeast since its discovery in the 1970s. As a result, MET15 has served as a genetic marker for hundreds of experiments that play a foundational role in eukaryote genetics and systems biology. Nevertheless, we demonstrate here through structural and evolutionary modeling, in vitro kinetic assays, and genetic complementation, that an alternative homocysteine synthase encoded by the previously uncharacterized gene YLL058W enables cells lacking Met15 to assimilate enough inorganic sulfur for survival and proliferation. These cells however fail to grow in patches or liquid cultures unless provided with exogenous methionine or other organosulfurs. We show that this growth failure, which has historically justified the status of MET15 as a classic auxotrophic marker, is largely explained by toxic accumulation of the gas hydrogen sulfide because of a metabolic bottleneck. When patched or cultured with a hydrogen sulfide chelator, and when propagated as colony grids, cells without Met15 assimilate inorganic sulfur and grow, and cells with Met15 achieve even higher yields. Thus, Met15 is not essential for inorganic sulfur assimilation in yeast. Instead, MET15 is the first example of a yeast gene whose loss conditionally prevents growth in a manner that depends on local gas exchange. Our results have broad implications for investigations of sulfur metabolism, including studies of stress response, methionine restriction, and aging. More generally, our findings illustrate how unappreciated experimental variables can obfuscate biological discovery."
https://openalex.org/W4309135072,"The US population faced stressors associated with suicide brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. Understanding the relationship between stressors and suicidal ideation in the context of the pandemic may inform policies and programs to prevent suicidality and suicide. We compared suicidal ideation between two cross-sectional, nationally representative surveys of adults in the United States: the 2017–2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) and the 2020 COVID-19 and Life Stressors Impact on Mental Health and Well-being (CLIMB) study (conducted March 31 to April 13). We estimated the association between stressors and suicidal ideation in bivariable and multivariable Poisson regression models with robust variance to generate unadjusted and adjusted prevalence ratios (PR and aPR). Suicidal ideation increased from 3.4% in the 2017–2018 NHANES to 16.3% in the 2020 CLIMB survey, and from 5.8% to 26.4% among participants in low-income households. In the multivariable model, difficulty paying rent (aPR: 1.5, 95% CI: 1.2–2.1) and feeling alone (aPR: 1.9, 95% CI: 1.5–2.4) were associated with suicidal ideation but job loss was not (aPR: 0.9, 95% CI: 0.6 to 1.2). Suicidal ideation increased by 12.9 percentage points and was almost 4.8 times higher during the COVID-19 pandemic. Suicidal ideation was more prevalent among people facing difficulty paying rent (31.5%), job loss (24.1%), and loneliness (25.1%), with each stressor associated with suicidal ideation in bivariable models. Difficulty paying rent and loneliness were most associated with suicidal ideation. Policies and programs to support people experiencing economic precarity and loneliness may contribute to suicide prevention."
https://openalex.org/W4309138955,"The essential oil from Rosmarinus officinalis L., a composite mixture of plant-derived secondary metabolites, exhibits antifungal activity against virulent candidal species. Here we report the impact of rosemary oil and two of its components, the monoterpene α-pinene and the monoterpenoid 1,8-cineole, against Candida albicans, which induce ROS-dependent cell death at high concentrations and inhibit hyphal morphogenesis and biofilm formation at lower concentrations. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (100% inhibition) for both rosemary oil and 1,8-cineole were 4500 μg/ml and 3125 μg/ml for α-pinene, with the two components exhibiting partial synergy (FICI = 0.55 ± 0.07). At MIC and 1/2 MIC, rosemary oil and its components induced a generalized cell wall stress response, causing damage to cellular and organelle membranes, along with elevated chitin production and increased cell surface adhesion and elasticity, leading to complete vacuolar segregation, mitochondrial depolarization, elevated reactive oxygen species, microtubule dysfunction, and cell cycle arrest mainly at the G1/S phase, consequently triggering cell death. Interestingly, the same oils at lower fractional MIC (1/8-1/4) inhibited virulence traits, including reduction of mycelium (up to 2-fold) and biofilm (up to 4-fold) formation, through a ROS-independent mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W4309135073,"ddPCR is becoming one of the most widely used tool in the field of eDNA-based aquatic monitoring. Although emulsion PCR used in ddPCR confers a partial mitigation to inhibition due to the high number of reactions for a single sample (between 10K and 20K), it is not impervious to it. Our results showed that inhibition impacts the amplitude of fluorescence in positive droplets with a different intensity among rivers. This signal fluctuation could jeopardize the use of a shared threshold among samples from different origin, and thus the accurate assignment of the positive droplets which is particularly important for low concentration samples such as eDNA ones: amplification events are scarce, thus their objective discrimination as positive is crucial. Another issue, related to target low concentration, is the artifactual generation of high fluorescence droplets (‘stars’). Indeed, these could be counted as positive with a single threshold solution, which in turn could produce false positive and incorrect target concentration assessments. Approximating the positive and negative droplets distribution as normal, we proposed here a double threshold method accounting for both high fluorescence droplets (‘stars’) and PCR inhibition impact in delineating positive droplets clouds. In the context of low concentration template recovered from environmental samples, the application of this method of double threshold establishment could allow for a consistent sorting of the positive and negative droplets throughout ddPCR data generated from samples with varying levels of inhibitor contents. Due to low concentrations template and inhibition effects, Quantasoft software produced an important number of false negatives and positive comparatively to the double threshold method developed here. This case study allowed the detection of the invasive crayfish P . leniusculus in 32 out of 34 sampled sites from two main rivers (Alzette and Sûre) and five of their tributaries (Eisch, Attert, Mamer, Wiltz and Clerve)."
https://openalex.org/W4309138810,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative condition that progresses over decades. Early detection of individuals at high risk of future progression toward AD is likely to be of critical significance for the successful treatment and/or prevention of this devastating disease. In this paper, we present an empirical study to characterize how predictable an individual subjects’ future AD trajectory is, several years in advance, based on rich multi-modal data, and using modern deep learning methods. Crucially, the machine learning strategy we propose can handle different future time horizons and can be trained with heterogeneous data that exhibit missingness and non-uniform follow-up visit times. Our experiments demonstrate that our strategy yields predictions that are more accurate than a model trained on a single time horizon (e.g. 3 years), which is common practice in prior literature. We also provide a comparison between linear and nonlinear models, verifying the well-established insight that the latter can offer a boost in performance. Our results also confirm that predicting future decline for cognitively normal (CN) individuals is more challenging than for individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Intriguingly, however, we discover that prediction accuracy decreases with increasing time horizon for CN subjects, but the trend is in the opposite direction for MCI subjects. Additionally, we quantify the contribution of different data types in prediction, which yields novel insights into the utility of different biomarkers. We find that molecular biomarkers are not as helpful for CN individuals as they are for MCI individuals, whereas magnetic resonance imaging biomarkers (hippocampus volume, specifically) offer a significant boost in prediction accuracy for CN individuals. Finally, we show how our model’s prediction reveals the evolution of individual-level progression risk over a five-year time horizon.

https://openalex.org/W4309138832,"Soil microbiome disruption methods are regularly used to reduce populations of microbial pathogens, often resulting in increased crop growth. However, little is known about the effect of soil microbiome disruption on non-pathogenic members of the soil microbiome. Here, we applied soil microbiome disruption in the form of moist-heat sterilization (autoclaving) to reduce populations of naturally occurring soil microbiota. The disruption was applied to analyze bacterial community rearrangement mediated by four crops (corn, beet, lettuce, and tomato) grown in three historically distinct agroecosystem soils (conventional, organic, and diseased). Applying the soil disruption enhanced plant influence on rhizosphere bacterial colonization, and significantly different bacterial communities were detected between the tested crops. Furthermore, bacterial genera showed significant abundance increases in ways both unique-to and shared-by each tested crop. As an example, corn uniquely promoted abundances of Pseudomonas and Sporocytophaga , regardless of the disrupted soil in which it was grown. Whereas the promotion of Bosea , Dyadobacter and Luteoliobacter was shared by all four crops when grown in disrupted soils. In summary, soil disruption followed by crop introduction amplified the plant colonization of potential beneficial bacterial genera in the rhizosphere."
https://openalex.org/W4309138931,"University students are known to have risky sexual behaviours (RSBs). The severity of the RSB is influenced by many factors, including the family environment, exposure to adverse childhood events (ACEs), and the use of addictive substances. However, there is limited information about the influence of ACEs and the family environment of these students in low-and medium-income countries (LMICs). Therefore, a pilot study was conducted among university students from a LMIC, Uganda.The present study comprised a cross-sectional online survey among Ugandan students at a public university (N = 316; 75% male; 52.2% aged between 18-22 years). The survey included questions relating to socio-demographic information, family environmental information, the Sexual Risk Survey (SRS), and the Adverse Childhood Experiences-International Questionnaire (ACE-IQ).Over half (53.8%) reported having had sexual intercourse. Males reported over two times higher mean total SRS score compared to females (χ2 = 4.06, p = 0.044). Approximately one-sixth of the sample had drunk alcohol or used illicit psychoactive substances in the past six months (16.1%). Among four regression analysis models, sociodemographic variables predicted the highest variance (13%), followed by family environment variables (10%), and both psychoactive substance use history (past six months) and ACEs individually explained approximately 5% variance in total SRS score, with the final model predicting 33% of the variance in RSB.The present study demonstrated a gender disparity with males involved in more RSB than females, as has been reported in most previous RSB studies. Family environment, sociodemographic factors, substance use, and ACEs all appear to contribute to RSB among university students. These findings will benefit other researchers exploring factors associated with RSB among university students and will help develop interventions to reduce RSB to protect students from unwanted pregnancies, sexually transmitted diseases, and HIV/AIDS."

We aimed to identify the important correlates and their effects on the predicted likelihood of wanting to seek help among 2SLGBTQI+ young adults for mental health or substance use concerns during the pandemic. A cross-sectional survey was conducted in 2020-2021 among 2SLGBTQI+ young adults aged 16-29 living in two Canadian provinces (Ontario and Quebec). Among 1414 participants, 77% (n = 1089) wanted to seek help for their mental health or substance use concerns during the pandemic, out of these, 69.8% (n = 760) reported delay in accessing care. We built a random forest (RF) model to predict the status of wanting to seek help, which achieved moderately high performance with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.85. The top 10 correlates of wanting to seek help were worsening mental health, age, stigma and discrimination, and adverse childhood experiences. The interactions of adequate housing with certain sexual orientations, gender identities and mental health challenges were found to increase the likelihood of wanting to seek help. We built another RF model for predicting risk of delay in accessing care among participants who wanted to seek help (n = 1089). The model identified a similar set of top 10 correlates of delay in accessing care but lacked adequate performance (AUC 0.61). These findings can direct future research and targeted prevention measures to reduce health disparities for 2SLGBTQI+ young adults."
https://openalex.org/W4309138828,"Aging can be defined as the progressive loss of physiological homeostasis that leads to a decline in cellular and organismal function. In recent years, it has become clear that small RNA pathways play a role in aging and aging related phenotypes. Small RNA pathways regulate many important processes including development, cellular physiology, and innate immunity. The pathways illicit a form of posttranscriptional gene regulation that relies on small RNAs bound by the protein components of the RNA-induced silencing complexes (RISCs), which inhibit the expression of complementary RNAs. In Drosophila melanogaster , Argonaute 1 (Ago1) is the core RISC component in microRNA (miRNA) silencing, while Argonaute 2 (Ago2) is the core RISC component in small interfering RNA (siRNA) silencing. The expression of Ago1 and Ago2 is regulated by stress response transcription factor Forkhead box O (dFOXO) increasing siRNA silencing efficiency. dFOXO plays a role in multiple stress responses and regulates pathways important for longevity. Here we use a next-generation sequencing approach to determine the effects of aging on small RNA abundance and RISC loading in male and female Drosophila . In addition, we examine the impact of the loss of dFOXO on these processes. We find that the relative abundance of the majority of small RNAs does not change with age. Additionally, under normal growth conditions, the loss of dFOXO has little effect on the small RNA landscape. However, we observed that age affects loading into RISC for a small number of miRNAs."
https://openalex.org/W4309139063,"Some studies suggest a bi-directional association between low relationship quality and depression. However, the social impact of depression and the potential preventative effects of healthy relationships are not yet sufficiently understood, as studies have shown heterogenous results for effects in both directions. Therefore, the main aim of this study was to differentiate the actor and partner effects of this association more comprehensively using two measures to capture characteristics of relationship quality-firstly regarding general aspects of social system quality and secondly considering specific aspects of the romantic relationship. 110 different-sex couples were included, being separated in partners with highly pronounced depressive symptoms in women (Cw/DW) versus partners with low depressive symptoms (LDCs). We investigated effects cross-sectionally using multi-group analyses to predict relationship (couple specific questionnaire: PFB) versus system quality (general system quality questionnaire: EVOS) in a step-by-step approach, modelling actor and partner effects with variation within and across both groups and then comparing the results to models with equal actor and partner effects. Depression was measured with the PHQ-9. With regard to the relationship between depressive symptoms and system quality, the model that constrained actor and partner effects to be equal across both groups was preferred and showed negative significant actor effects across gender and groups. Concerning the association between depressive symptoms and relationship quality, the model constraining actor and partner effects to be equal within groups had the best fit to the data and revealed a negative partner effect in LDCs. Conclusions Controlling for the moderating variable of clinically relevant depressive symptoms, we found evidence for actor and partner effects, which differed between the two relationship measures. This underlines the importance to reflect how relationship quality is operationalized. The negative partner effect on relationship quality in LDCs emphasizes that even in a non-clinical context, depressive symptoms negatively impact the perceived relationship quality of both women and men. This suggests that addressing the relationship is important in non-clinical preventive contexts and calls for integrating the partner into counselling or trainings."
https://openalex.org/W4309139241,"Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a fatal prion disease affecting cervids (deer, elk, moose). Current methods to monitor individual disease state include highly invasive antemortem rectal biopsy or postmortem brain biopsy. Efficient, sensitive, and selective antemortem and postmortem testing of populations would increase knowledge of the dynamics of CWD epizootics as well as provide a means to track CWD progression into previously unaffected areas. Here, we analyzed the presence of CWD prions in skin samples from two easily accessed locations (ear and belly) from 30 deceased white-tailed deer ( Odocoileus viginianus ). The skin samples were enzymatically digested and analyzed by real-time quaking-induced conversion (RT-QuIC). The diagnostic sensitivity of the ear and belly skin samples were both 95%, and the diagnostic specificity of the ear and belly skin were both 100%. Additionally, the location of the skin biopsy on the ear does not affect specificity or sensitivity. These results demonstrate the efficacy of CWD diagnosis with skin biopsies using RT-QuIC. This method could be useful for large scale antemortem population testing."

In the field of veterinary medicine, tele-triage services have been employed since the early 2000s, but there has been little examination of how these services are used by callers. The objectives of this study were to explore how the use of an animal poison control center (APCC) tele-triage service varied between veterinarians and the public in terms of toxicant type, animal demographics, availability of veterinary services, as well as seasonal and secular trends. Data regarding dog poisoning events were obtained from the APCC of the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals’ (ASPCA). We fitted a mixed logistic regression model with random intercepts for county and state and identified associations between caller type and the following: animal characteristics (i.e., age, weight, breed-class), type of toxicant, season, year, and access to veterinary services (i.e., veterinarians per capita in the county of the caller). The model included interaction effects between season and both plant and pesticide toxicants. There was also an interaction between year and access to veterinary care. Further investigations are needed to understand how the novelty of a toxicant and the severity of clinical signs associated with a toxicant predict the type of caller, if pet demographics are associated with the caller based on medical issues or owner attitudes, and how access to veterinary care influences the use of this tele-triage service."
https://openalex.org/W4309139314,"We test in how far women’s economic participation can be associated with physical and/or sexual domestic violence against women in Turkey, by mobilizing the Survey “National Research on Domestic Violence against Women in Turkey” (wave 2014). Several studies found that economically active women have a similar, if not a higher risk of experiencing domestic violence than inactive women in Turkey, as well as in other emerging countries. We challenge these findings for Turkey by distinguishing between formal and informal labor market activities as well as between women who do not work because their partner does not allow them to and women who are inactive for other reasons. To increase the control for endogeneity in this cross-sectional setting, we apply an IV-approach based on cluster averages. We find that, while overall employment for women cannot be associated with a lower risk of experiencing domestic violence for women in Turkey, those women who participate in the formal labor market and those women who contribute at least the same as their partner to household income are less exposed to physical and/or sexual domestic violence than their counterparts. Distinguishing between formal and informal employment is thus important when it comes to investigate the association between women’s economic activity and domestic violence. This is especially the case in a country like Turkey, which currently undergoes important socio-economic changes and where women in formal and informal employment have therefore very different socioeconomic backgrounds."
https://openalex.org/W4309135096,"Purpose Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, wearing a face mask has become an essential measure to reduce the rate of virus spreading. The aim of the study was to assess the effect of wearing a surgical face mask for a short period on the tear film parameters in subjects with a high body mass index (BMI). Methods Twenty-five females with a high BMI (31.4 ± 5.5 kg/m 2 ) aged 18–35 years (22.7 ± 4.6 years) participated in the study. In addition, a control group consisting of 25 females (23.0 ± 6.7 years) with a high BMI (29.9 ± 4.1 kg/m 2 ) participated in the study in which no mask was worn. The standardized patient evaluation of eye dryness (SPEED) questionnaire was completed first, followed by the phenol red thread (PRT) and tear ferning (TF) tests, before wearing the face mask. The subjects wore the face mask for 1 hour, and the measurements were performed again immediately after its removal. For the control group, the measurements were performed twice with one hour gap. Results Significant (Wilcoxon test, p &lt; 0.05) differences were found between the SPEED scores (p = 0.035) and the PRT measurement (p = 0.042), before and after wearing the surgical face mask. The PRT scores have improved after wearing the surgical face mask, while the dry eye symptoms detected by the SPEED questionnaire have increased. On the other hand, no significant (Wilcoxon test, p = 0.201) differences were found between the TF grades before and after wearing a surgical face mask. For the control group, no significant (Wilcoxon test, p &gt; 0.05) differences were found between the two scores from the SPEED questionnaire and the PRT, and TF tests. Conclusions Wearing a surgical face mask for a short duration leads to a change in volume and quality of tears as well as dry eye symptoms in women with a high BMI."
https://openalex.org/W4309138762,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) morphogenesis is characterized by a large over-production of subviral particles and recently described new forms in parallel of complete viral particles (VP). This study was designed to depict circulating viral forms in HBV infected patient plasmas, using velocity gradients and most sensitive viral markers. Plasmas from chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients, HBeAg positive or negative, genotype D or E, were fractionated on velocity and equilibrium gradients with or without detergent treatment. Antigenic and molecular markers were measured in plasma and in each collected fraction. Fast Nycodenz velocity gradients revealed good reproducibility and provided additional information to standard equilibrium sucrose gradients. HBV-RNAs circulated as enveloped particles in all plasmas, except one, and at lesser concentrations than VP. Calculations based on standardized measurements and relative virion and subviral particle molecular stoichiometry allowed to refine the experimental approach. For the HBeAg-positive plasma, VP were accompanied by an overproduction of enveloped capsids, either containing HBs, likely corresponding to empty virions, or for the main part, devoid of this viral envelope protein. Similarly, in the HBeAg-negative sample, HBs enveloped capsids, likely corresponding to empty virions, were detected and the presence of enveloped capsids devoid of HBs protein was suspected but not clearly evidenced due to the presence of contaminating high-density subviral particles. While HBeAg largely influences HBcrAg measurement and accounts for two-thirds of HBcrAg reactivity in HBeAg-positive patients, it remains a 10 times more sensitive marker than HBsAg to characterize VP containing fractions. Using Nycodenz velocity gradients and standardized biomarkers, our study proposes a detailed characterization of circulating viral forms in chronically HBV infected patients. We provide evidence for an excess of capsids in fractions enriched in Dane particles, likely due to the presence of empty virions but also by capsids enveloped by an HBs free lipid layer. Identification of this new circulating viral particle sets the basis for studies around the potential role of these entities in hepatitis B pathogeny and their physiological regulation."

There persists, however, a paucity of growth data for most reef-building regions, especially for coral species whose skeletal architecture prevents the use of traditional methods such as coring and Alizarin staining. We used structure-from-motion photogrammetry to quantify a range of colony-scale growth metrics for six coral species in the Mexican Caribbean and present a newly developed workflow to measure colony volume change over time. Our results provide the first growth metrics for two species that are now major space occupiers on Caribbean reefs, Agaricia agaricites and Agaricia tenuifolia . We also document higher linear extension, volume increase and calcification rates within back reef compared to fore reef environments for four other common species: Orbicella faveolata , Porites astreoides , Siderastrea siderea and Pseudodiploria strigosa . Linear extension rates in our study were lower than those obtained via computed tomography (CT) scans of coral cores from the same sites, as the photogrammetry method averages growth in all dimensions, while the CT method depicts growth only along the main growth axis (upwards). The comparison of direct volume change versus potential volume increase calculated from linear extension emphasizes the importance of assessing whole colony growth to improve calcification estimates. The method presented here provides an approach that can generate accurate calcification estimates alongside a range of other whole-colony growth metrics in a non-invasive way."
https://openalex.org/W4309138817,"Treatments often come with thresholds, e.g. we are given statins if our cholesterol is above a certain threshold. But which statin administration threshold maximizes our quality of life adjusted years? More generally, which threshold would optimize the average expected outcome? Regression discontinuity approaches are used to measure the local average treatment effect (LATE) and more recently also the Marginal Threshold Treatment Effect (MTTE), which shows how marginal changes in the threshold can affect the LATE. We extend this idea to define the problem of optimizing a policy threshold, i.e. selecting a threshold that optimizes the cumulative effect of the treatment on the treated. We present an estimator of the optimal threshold based on a constrained optimization framework. We show how to use machine learning (Gaussian process regression) for non-linear estimation. We also extend the estimation to a conservative threshold that is unlikely to produce harm, and we show how to include policy cost constraints. We apply these results to estimate an optimal tip-maximizing threshold for tip suggestions in taxi cabs Haggag (2014)."
https://openalex.org/W4309138925,"Adequate social functioning during childhood requires context-appropriate social decision-making. To make such decisions, children rely on their social norms, conceptualized as cognitive models of shared expectations. Since social norms are dynamic, children must adapt their models of shared expectations and modify their behavior in line with their social environment. This study aimed to investigate children’s abilities to use social information to adapt their fairness norm and to identify the computational mechanism governing this process. Thirty children (7–11 years, M = 7.9 SD = 0.85, 11 girls) played the role of Responder in a modified version of the Ultimatum Game–a two-player game based on the fairness norm–in which they had to choose to accept or reject offers from different Proposers. Norm adaptation was assessed by comparing rejection rates before and after a conditioning block in which children received several low offers. Computational models were compared to test which best explains children’s behavior during the game. Mean rejection rate decreased significantly after receiving several low offers suggesting that children have the ability to dynamically update their fairness norm and adapt to changing social environments. Model-based analyses suggest that this process involves the computation of norm-prediction errors. This is the first study on norm adaptation capacities in school-aged children that uses a computational approach. Children use implicit social information to adapt their fairness norm to changing environments and this process appears to be supported by a computational mechanism in which norm-prediction errors are used to update norms."

The Danish Fabry cohort consisted of 26 families, 18 index patients (9 males and 9 females, no available data for 8 index-patients) and 97 family members with a pathogenic GLA variant identified by cascade genetic testing (30 males and 67 females). Fourteen patients (5 males and 9 females; mean age of death 47.0 and 64.8 years respectively) died during follow-up. The completeness of the Fabry patient identification in the country has resulted in a cohort of balanced genotypes according to gender (twice number of females compared to males), indicating that the cohort was not biased by referral, and further resulted in earlier diagnosis of the disease by a lower age at diagnosis in family members compared to index-patients (mean age at diagnosis: index-patients 42.2 vs. family members 26.0 years). Six previously unreported disease-causing variants in the GLA gene were discovered. The nationwide screening and registration of Fabry disease families provide a unique possibility to establish a complete cohort of Fabry patients and to advance current knowledge of this inherited rare lysosomal storage disorder."
https://openalex.org/W4309139071,"Tephritid fruit flies, such as the melon fly, Zeugodacus cucurbitae, are major horticultural pests worldwide and pose invasion risks due primarily to international trade. Determining movement parameters for fruit flies is critical to effective surveillance and control strategies, from setting quarantine boundaries after incursions to development of agent-based models for management. While mark-release-recapture, flight mills, and visual observations have been used to study tephritid movement, none of these techniques give a full picture of fruit fly movement in nature. Tracking tagged flies offers an alternative method which has the potential to observe individual fly movements in the field, mirroring studies conducted by ecologists on larger animals. In this study, harmonic radar (HR) tags were fabricated using superelastic nitinol wire which is light (tags weighed less than 1 mg), flexible, and does not tangle. Flight tests with wild melon flies showed no obvious adverse effects of HR tag attachment. Subsequent experiments successfully tracked HR tagged flies in large field cages, a papaya field, and open parkland. Unexpectedly, a majority of tagged flies showed strong flight directional biases with these biases varying between flies, similar to what has been observed in the migratory butterfly Pieris brassicae. In field cage experiments, 30 of the 36 flies observed (83%) showed directionally biased flights while similar biases were observed in roughly half the flies tracked in a papaya field. Turning angles from both cage and field experiments were non-random and indicate a strong bias toward continued ""forward"" movement. At least some of the observed direction bias can be explained by wind direction with a correlation observed between collective melon fly flight directions in field cage, papaya field, and open field experiments. However, individual mean flight directions coincided with the observed wind direction for only 9 out of the 25 flies in the cage experiment and half of the flies in the papaya field, suggesting wind is unlikely to be the only factor affecting flight direction. Individual flight distances (meters per flight) differed between the field cage, papaya field, and open field experiments with longer mean step-distances observed in the open field. Data on flight directionality and step-distances determined in this study might assist in the development of more effective control and better parametrize models of pest tephritid fruit fly movement."
https://openalex.org/W4309139092,"International humanitarian aid workers (iHAWs) are motivated strongly to travel abroad to help communities affected by war, famine, disaster and disease. They expose themselves to dangers and hardships during their field assignments. Despite working under such challenging circumstances, most workers remain healthy. The objective of the present study was to unravel the mechanism that enables workers to remain healthy under the same circumstances that affect these communities. We hypothesised that the different components of the Sense of Coherence (SOC) health mechanism mediate the relationship between field stressors and post-assignment health.The stress-health model was tested among 465 international aid workers using a longitudinal pre-post assignment study design and structural equation modelling for path analyses. The (health) outcome variables were PTSD, anxiety, depression, emotional exhaustion, and work engagement. Our findings highlight the importance of being healthy before aid assignment and the negative health impact of field stressors that were not potentially traumatic. The SOC components mediated the relationship between field stress and post-assignment health, with males and females using different SOC components to alleviate stress. Males are more likely trying to understand the nature of the stressor, whereas females mobilise their resources to manage stressors. In both groups, a high level of meaningfulness of the work was an important component in maintaining health. Regarding using the SOC concept for understanding the process of maintaining health, our findings indicated that SOC is best considered context-specific and multidimensional.In addition to good pre-mission health, the SOC components help prevent field assignment-related negative health effects in iHAWs. Our findings support the idea to compose gender-balanced teams of iHAWs to maintain and promote health. The findings can be used to develop or refine health conversation tools and SOC based health interventions to promote health and wellbeing and prevent ill-health among aid workers and other stress-exposed populations."

In this sample, data about erectile dysfunction, physical activity levels, clinical profile and laboratory exams were obtained. Logistic regression models were performed.Individuals with erectile dysfunction were older (49.1 ±6.9 vs. 54.8±8.8 years old, p<0.001), had a higher body mass index (27.6 ±3.9 vs. 28.5 ± 4.3 kg/m2, p<0,001), and presented with a higher prevalence of physical inactivity (25 vs. 19%, p<0.001) than individuals without erectile dysfunction. The multivariate model revealed that age (p<0.001), hypertension (p = 0.001), diabetes mellitus (p<0.001), high body mass index (p<0.001), lower urinary tract symptoms and depressive symptoms (p<0.001) were independent risk factors for erectile dysfunction. Low or high physical activity levels (OR = 0.77; CI95%: 0.68-0.87, p<0.001 and OR = 0.85; CI95%: 0.72-0.99, p = 0.04 respectively) were protective factors against erectile dysfunction.Low and high physical activity levels were associated with more than 20% reduction in the risk of erectile dysfunction in men aged 40 years or older."
https://openalex.org/W4309139254,"International migration patterns, at the global level, can to a large extent be explained through economic factors in origin and destination countries. On the other hand, it has been shown that global climate change is likely to affect economic development over the coming decades. Here, we demonstrate how these future climate impacts on national income levels could alter the global migration landscape. Using an empirically calibrated global migration model, we investigate two separate mechanisms. The first is through destination-country income, which has been shown consistently to have a positive effect on immigration. As countries' income levels relative to each other are projected to change in the future both due to different rates of economic growth and due to different levels of climate change impacts, the relative distribution of immigration across destination countries also changes as a result, all else being equal. Second, emigration rates have been found to have a complex, inverted U-shaped dependence on origin-country income. Given the available migration flow data, it is unclear whether this dependence-found in spatio-temporal panel data-also pertains to changes in a given migration flow over time. If it does, then climate change will additionally affect migration patterns through origin countries' emigration rates, as the relative and absolute positions of countries on the migration ""hump"" change. We illustrate these different possibilities, and the corresponding effects of 3°C global warming (above pre-industrial) on global migration patterns, using climate model projections and two different methods for estimating climate change effects on macroeconomic development."
https://openalex.org/W4309139258,"Surgery for intertrochanteric fractures using intramedullary hip nails (IHNs) is among the most common surgical procedures in the orthopedic field. Although IHNs provide good overall outcomes, they sometimes cause complications, such as loss of reduction and cut-out. Here, we investigated the usefulness of IHNs with an anterior offset (Best Fit Nail® [BFN]) in maintaining fragment reduction and ensuring proper lag screw position compared with conventional non-offset nails (Proximal Femoral Nail Antirotation® [PFNA]), using postoperative computed tomography (CT).Fifty consecutive patients with intertrochanteric fractures who underwent surgery with BFNs (BFN group) and 50 patients who underwent surgery with PFNAs (PFNA group) were retrospectively analyzed. Indices evaluated by postoperative CT were displacement distance of proximal fragment relative to distal fragment, reduction status (intramedullary, anatomical, and extramedullary types), lag screw direction, and angle between lag screw and femoral neck axis (deviation angle).Median [interquartile range] displacement distance was significantly smaller in the BFN group (0 [0, 0] mm) compared with the PFNA group (5.2 [3.6, 7.1] mm) (p<0.001). Reduction status was significantly better in the BFN group (anatomical type, 40 cases; intramedullary type, in 9 cases, and extramedullary type in 1 case) than in the PFNA group (anatomical type, 6 cases; intramedullary type, 43 cases; extramedullary type, 1 case) (p<0.001). Deviation of lag screw direction was observed in significantly fewer cases in the BFN group (20 cases; 40%) compared with the PFNA group (36 cases; 72%). Lag screw deviation angle was significantly smaller in the BFN group (-0.71°±4.0°) compared with the PFNA group (6.9°±7.1°). No adverse events related to surgery were observed in either group.Intertrochanteric fracture surgery using offset BFNs exhibited significantly smaller displacement distance, better reduction status, and higher frequency of no deviation with central lag screw position, compared with surgery using non-offset PFNAs."
https://openalex.org/W4309139309,"The autonomic nervous system plays a crucial role in the maintenance of homeostasis. Neurogenic inflammation due to decreased stability of tear film may induce changes in autonomic nerve activity, which could be associated with symptom expression.This study aimed to measure biological parameters that represent autonomic nerve activity in dry eye (DE)s caused by tear film dysfunction and investigate their relationship with symptom intensity. This prospective, cross-sectional, comparative study evaluated 34 eyes of 34 participants (mean age: 52.5 ± 13.4 years; range: 20–81 years) without keratoconjunctival damage. Nineteen eyes in the DE group showed DE symptoms and tear break-up time (TBUT) of ≤5 seconds (short TBUT DE); the 15 eyes in the non-DE group showed no DE symptoms. Autonomic nerve activity was measured for 10 minutes—starting and ending 5 minutes before and after instilling ophthalmic solution—and evaluated using the low-frequency component (LF) to the high-frequency component (HF) ratio of heart rate variability (autonomic balance). The pre-ophthalmic solution administration LF/HF ratio was not significantly different ( P = 0.59) between the two groups, however, the standard deviation of the LF/HF ratio (LF/HF-SD) tended to be higher in the DE group than that in the non-DE group ( P = 0.086). The DE symptom intensity was significantly related to LF/HF-SD ( P = 0.005), which significantly decreased after ophthalmic solution administration in the DE group ( P = 0.04). The large fluctuations in autonomic balance may be key for the understanding of the mechanism underlying DE symptoms."
https://openalex.org/W4309151192,"Transfusion-associated necrotising enterocolitis (TANEC) is a life-threatening disease with a poor prognosis in preterm infants. This study explored whether and how heme induces ferroptosis in TANEC gut injury. A TANEC mouse model and a cell culture system for heme and Caco-2 cells were established. Ferroptosis was assessed by measuring iron and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels and mitochondrial morphology in intestinal tissues and Caco-2 cells. Mitochondrial dysfunction was evaluated by measuring mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and membrane potential using JC-1. The intestinal injury grade was higher in the anemia-transfusion group than in the control group (p < .0001). Higher intestinal iron concentration (p < .0001), elevated levels of lipid peroxidation MDA (p = .0021), and ferroptotic mitochondrial morphological changes were found in mice of the anemia-transfusion group; specific ferroptosis inhibitor could alleviate anemia-transfusion gut injury, suggesting that ferroptosis play a role in the TANEC gut injury. Next, we explored whether heme released by hemolysis of erythrocytes induces ferroptosis in intestinal epithelial cells in vitro. The viability of Caco-2 cells significantly decreased after heme treatment (p < .0001). Iron accumulation, MDA elevated levels, and mitochondrial dysfunction also existed in the co-culture system, which ferroptosis inhibitors could reduce. In summary, ferroptosis was discovered in TANEC, and heme could induce ferroptosis in intestinal epithelial cells via mitochondrial dysfunction. Heme-inducing ferroptosis may be a possible mechanism and therapeutic target for TANEC."
https://openalex.org/W4309046993,"Unlike most flaviviruses transmitted by arthropods, Tembusu virus (TMUV) is still active during winter and causes outbreaks in some areas, indicating vector-independent spread of the virus. Gastrointestinal transmission might be one of the possible routes of vector-free transmission, which also means that the virus has to interact with more intestinal bacteria. Here, we found evidence that TMUV indeed can transmit through the digestive tract. Interestingly, using an established TMUV disease model by oral gavage combined with an antibiotic treatment, we revealed that a decrease in intestinal bacteria significantly reduced local TMUV proliferation in the intestine, revealing that the bacterial microbiome is important in TMUV infection. We found that lipopolysaccharide (LPS) present in the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria enhanced TMUV proliferation by promoting its attachment. Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), a cell surface receptor, can transmit signal from LPS. We confirmed colocalization of TLR4 with TMUV envelope (E) protein as well as their interaction in infected cells. Coherently, TMUV infection of susceptible cells was inhibited by an anti-TLR4 antibody, purified soluble TLR4 protein, and knockdown of TLR4 expression. LPS-enhanced TMUV proliferation could also be blocked by a TLR4 inhibitor. Meanwhile, pretreatment of duck primary cells with TMUV significantly impaired LPS-induced interleukin 6 production. Collectively, our study provides first insights into vector-free transmission mechanisms of flaviviruses."

Following infection, IFN-λ, a ligand crucial for the resolution of viral infections, is known to bind to its cognate receptor, IFNLR1, in lung epithelia. However, little is known regarding the molecular expression and regulation of IFNLR1. Here, we show that IFNLR1 is a labile protein in human airway epithelia that is rapidly degraded after influenza infection. Using an unbiased proximal ligation biotin screen, we first identified that the Skp-Cullin-F box E3 ligase subunit, FBXO45, binds to IFNLR1. We demonstrate that FBXO45, induced in response to influenza infection, mediates IFNLR1 protein polyubiquitination and degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome system by docking with its intracellular receptor domain. Furthermore, we found ectopically expressed FBXO45 and its silencing in cells differentially regulated both IFNLR1 protein stability and interferon-stimulated gene expression. Mutagenesis studies also indicated that expression of a K319R/K320R IFNLR1 variant in cells exhibited reduced polyubiquitination, yet greater stability and proteolytic resistance to FBXO45 and influenza-mediated receptor degradation. These results indicate that the IFN-λ–IFNLR1 receptor axis is tightly regulated by the Skp-Cullin-F box ubiquitin machinery, a pathway that may be exploited by influenza infection as a means to limit antiviral responses.

The RNA virus influenza robustly activates the immune system through molecular sensing of the viral RNA by host cells via pattern recognition receptors (Toll-like receptor, retinoic acid-inducible gene (RIG-I)), sequential activation of the mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein signaling cascade, transcriptional activation of the DNA-binding component interferon (IFN) regulatory factors and NF-κB, and then type I (e.g., IFN-α) and type III interferon (IFN-λ) production (1Weis S. Te Velthuis A.J.W. Influenza virus RNA synthesis and the innate immune response.Viruses. 2021; 13: 780Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). IFN-λ is critical in the resolution of viral, bacterial, and fungal infections and acts through engagement of its cognate receptor complex, comprised of interferon lambda receptor 1 (IFNLR1) and interleukin (IL)-10R2 (2Ye L.

Four IFN-λ ligands (type III IFN) have been described with IFNλ1–3 sharing high amino acid sequence homologies, whereas IFNλ4 is more divergent with only 40.8% amino acid similarity to IFNλ3 (4Lazear H.M.

IFNLR1 (also known as IL-28R) is a single pass 520 AA type I membrane receptor. Upon ligand activation, STAT1 and STAT2 are recruited by IFNLR1 and IL-10rb, respectively, which are then phosphorylated and transported to the nucleus to mediate transcriptional activation of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) (4Lazear H.M. Nice T.J. Diamond M.S. Interferon-lambda: immune functions at barrier surfaces and beyond.Immunity. 2015; 43: 15-28Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar).

Several studies have shown that mice treated with IFN-λ after influenza infection exhibited significantly lower mortality, decreased viral burden, with reduced inflammatory cytokines compared to control underscoring the indispensability of the IFN-λ–IFNLR1 axis (6Galani I.E.

Further, the requirement of the IFNλ-IFNLR1 pathway for antiviral protection is underscored given that targeted disruption of IFNLR1 results in widespread viral dissemination and lethality (7Klinkhammer J.

In human tissues, IFNLR1 has a more diverse expression profile, but notably, the expression, signaling, and molecular regulation of IFNLR1 in the human lung has not been fully elucidated. In humans, IFN-λ is the earliest and most profuse interferon produced during influenza infection, triggering its engagement with IFNLR1 in providing host innate immunity (6Galani I.E.

Like rodents, IFN-λ may partake in antiviral defense at barrier surfaces, such as within the human lung and gastrointestinal epithelial lining. Remarkably, although both IFN-λ and IFN-α confer antiviral protection, IFN-α leads to the upregulation of proinflammatory genes (6Galani I.E. Triantafyllia V. Eleminiadou E.E. Koltsida O.

Viral pathogenesis has been shown to exploit host cellular pathways for numerous steps of the infection cycle including molecular hijacking of the host protein degradation apparatus (13Rudnicka A. Yamauchi Y. Ubiquitin in influenza virus entry and innate immunity.Viruses. 2016; 8: 293Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), executed via actions of E1-activating, E2-conjugating enzymes, and E3-ubiquitin ligases, are central to intracellular protein degradation. The UPS is fundamental to control of numerous cell functions involving protein turnover, cellular sorting and cell cycle progression, stress responses, transcriptional control, and surface receptor turnover (14Hochstrasser M. Biochemistry. All in the ubiquitin family.Science. 2000; 289: 563-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 15Hershko A. Ciechanover A. The ubiquitin system.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (7027) Google Scholar). Of the many E3 ligases, the understanding of Skp-Cullin1-F- box (SCF) superfamily is growing, comprised of a catalytic core consisting of Skp1, Cullin1, and Rbx1 (16Cardozo T. Pagano M. The SCF ubiquitin ligase: insights into a molecular machine.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 739-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar, 17Deshaies R.J. Joazeiro C.A. RING domain E3 ubiquitin ligases.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2009; 78: 399-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (1944) Google Scholar). The SCF complex also contains an adaptor receptor subunit, termed F-box protein, that engages numerous substrates to the E3 catalytic core (18Skowyra D. Craig K.L. Tyers M. Elledge S.J. Harper J.W.

Willems A.R. One ring to rule a superfamily of E3 ubiquitin ligases.Science. 1999; 284: 603-604Crossref Scopus (142) Google Scholar). F-box proteins are categorized within three families (FBXW, FBXO, FBXL) according to their substrate-binding motifs with the FBXO family containing a variety of yet unknown substrate-binding motifs (20Skaar J.R. Pagan J.K. Pagano M. Mechanisms and function of substrate recruitment by F-box proteins.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2013; 14: 369-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). In particular, F-box proteins have been shown to partake in host defense in the pathogenesis of influenza infection, as FBXW7 antagonizes viral replication perhaps via RIG-I stabilization (21Yan H.Y. Wang H.Q. Zhong M. Wu S. Yang L. Li K. et al.PML suppresses influenza virus replication by promoting FBXW7 expression.Virol.

Xue Y. et al.E3 ligase FBXW7 is critical for RIG-I stabilization during antiviral responses.Nat. Commun. 2017; 814654Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The FBXO family F-box protein, FBXO45, has been previously recognized to play a role in neoplasia, nervous system and psychiatric disorders, and inflammatory disorders (23Lin M. Wang Z.W. Zhu X. FBXO45 is a potential therapeutic target for cancer therapy.Cell Death Discov. 2020; 6: 55Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). However, a biological role of this F-box protein remains largely unknown especially with respect to viral pathogenesis. In this study, we have observed that influenza infection triggers IFNLR1 degradation mediated by FBXO45 that targets IFNLR1 for ubiquitination and degradation in epithelia to impair IFN-λ signaling. The results suggest a potential mechanism whereby the virus subverts host immune responses essential for tissue repair. We examined the short-term (<12 h) effect of influenza infection on IFNLR1 protein levels in THP-1 macrophages and BEAS-2B lung epithelial cells. Influenza infection significantly decreased IFNLR1 protein at 8 h post infection in both cell types (Fig. 1, A and B) without decreased receptor mRNA (Fig. 1C). We next examined the role of IFNLR1 signaling in BEAS-2B cells in transient knockdown studies using various amounts of siRNA to induce a modest reduction in IFNLR1 mRNA and protein. Here, despite modest knockdown of IFNLR1, we observed that levels of several antiviral genes were reduced in a trend toward a dose-dependent manner after PR8 infection (Fig. 1, D–F). Thus, the results demonstrate that epithelial cells are sensitive to availability of the IFNLR1 receptor that impact vital antiviral responses. To understand the upstream effect of influenza infection on IFNLR1 levels, we infected HBEC3KT cells, which are human telomerase reverse transcriptase-immortalized human bronchial lung epithelial cells. With increasing MOI of PR8 influenza infection of these cells over 6 h, we observed a significant decrease in IFNLR1 with PR8 infection via flow cytometry. (Fig. 1G). Next, we applied recombinant IFN-λ (IL-29) to HBEC3KT cells for 6 h at different concentrations. IFNLR1 signals via flow cytometry decreased with inclusion of IFN-λ (Fig. 1H) in the culture medium, suggesting that downregulation of IFNLR1 occurs due to autocrine signaling. To understand the degradation process further, we next ectopically expressed V5- and histine (HIS)-tagged IFNLR1 and HA-tagged–ubiquitin in HEK-293T cells. This was followed by treatment with the proteasomal inhibitor MG-132 or autophagosome/lysosomal inhibitor Bafilomycin A1 (BafA1) to preserve the ubiquitinated proteins. MLN7243, an inhibitor of ubiquitin activating enzyme, was added as a control to confirm that the detected bands were due to ubiquitination. Cell lysates were harvested, and samples were processed for HIS-tagged pull-down assays to compare the differences in polyubiquitination. BafA1 did not significantly increase ubiquitination above basal levels, whereas MG-132 led to a robust increase in IFNLR1 polyubiquitination (Fig. 2A). Next, in cells treated with the protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide (CHX), IFNLR1 protein was largely degraded by 8 h, an effect significantly blocked by inclusion of MG-132 and MLN7243 in the culture medium but not BafA1 (Fig. 2, B and C). To map the region of IFNLR1 protein necessary for degradation, we constructed plasmids expressing IFNLR1 with truncated C-terminal domains and after transfection into BEAS-2B cells, we measured stabilization of each variant by MG-132 (Fig. 2D). When truncations expressed in cells do not accumulate in the presence of MG-132, this suggests the loss of regions necessary for degradation. Although these constructs expressed to variable degrees in cells, our data showed that both the WT full-length protein and a construct harboring the first 460 AA of the IFNLR1 protein showed accumulation after MG-132 unlike other truncations (Fig. 2D). These data suggest the presence of molecular signatures spanning residues AA 360-460 that may be required for receptor degradation. To examine this region more closely, we constructed a series of 30 AA deletions between the AA 370-460 domain. When AA 430-460 was excised and the plasmid expressed in cells, the resulting protein was both less responsive to MG-132 and more stable in the presence of CHX (Fig. 2E). Using protein motif prediction software (http://emboss.bioinformatics.nl/cgi-bin/emboss/epestfind), we identified that this region corresponds to a PEST domain (AA 432–486), a canonical destabilizing element (24Rechsteiner M. Rogers S.W. PEST sequences and regulation by proteolysis.Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 267-271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1419) Google Scholar). Together, the data suggest that IFNLR1 is (i) ubiquitinated and proteasomally degraded and (ii) that there might reside a specific destabilizing motif necessary for degradation within the cytoplasmic domain. We used BioID2 and miniTurbo proximity ligation assays as unbiased screens to determine molecular binding partners that might mediate IFNLR1 degradation. The BioID2 biotin ligase was conjugated to the carboxyl-terminus of IFNLR1. As specificity controls, we overexpressed the IFN-γ receptor IFNGR1-BioID2 and the transmembrane receptor SIRPA-BioID2. HEK-293T cells were transiently transfected with these constructs for 48 h followed by overnight biotin treatment and isolation of biotinylated proteins. We identified 169 unique IFNLR1 proteins, 7 of which were E3 ligases, including FBXO45 (Fig. 3A). In separate experiments, we also conjugated the biotin ligase miniTurbo to the carboxyl-terminus of IFNLR1, transiently transfected into cells, and treated cells with biotin for 1 h prior to harvest. Compared to miniTurbo alone, we identified 100 unique interactions with the IFNLR1-miniTurbo biotin ligase. Six of these proteins were E3 ligases. FBXO45 was again identified as a unique IFNLR1-interacting partner (Fig. S1). Due to our identification of an IFNLR1–FBXO45 interaction in multiple experiments using different biotin ligase constructs, we further examined FBXO45-mediated changes in IFNLR1 signaling. We examined several ubiquitin-related proteins uniquely associated with IFNLR1, including FBXO45, TRIM25, and USP7, as well as the diphosphate DUSP9 as a potential regulator of IFNLR1 function. Cellular depletion of all four genes using two different DsiRNA was executed in BEAS-2B cells that were transfected with these corresponding DsiRNA (Fig. 3B) and treated with IFN-λ. Here, we observed an increase in IFNLR1-mediated STAT1 phosphorylation and downstream IFIT3 gene induction with both DsiRNA’s targeting FBXO45 (Fig. 3C). Thus, we focused on FBXO45. To also map the location of FBXO45 and IFNLR1 protein interaction, we utilized a series of truncated IFNLR1 C-terminal domain proteins and performed coimmunoprecipitation experiments using the truncation mutants of V5-tagged IFNLR1 and FLAG-tagged FBXO45 to locate the receptor region that binds FBXO45. We found that the IFNLR1 constructs lacking the region between AA360 and 410 exhibited substantially reduced ability to bind to FBXO45, suggesting that there might exist a motif in this region necessary for FBXO45 docking (Fig. 3, D and E). Additional studies were conducted to assess viral responses of FBXO45 in cells and effects of the F-box protein on interferon signaling. In BEAS-2B cells, increasing MOI’s of PR8 influenza increased FBXO45 levels coupled with a reduction in levels of IFNLR1 (Fig. 4A). Interestingly, FBXO45 silencing and subsequent PR8 infection reduced matrix 1/matrix 2 (M1/M2) proteins (Fig. 4B). Further, FBXO45 overexpression in BEAS-2B cells selectively decreased IFN-λ signaling (Fig. 4C). When FBXO45 was depleted in cells and subsequently treated with IFN-λ, IFN-α, or IFN-γ, only IFN-λ induced IFIT3 after FBXO45 knockdown (Fig. 4D). Infection of BEAS-2B cells with various MOI of PR8 and FBXO45 silencing also led to a substantial increase in ISG expression, an effect not observed after IFNLR1 cellular depletion (Fig. 4E). Specifically, the proteins STAT1 and IFIT3 were notably increased in a dose-dependent manner compared to the control with FBXO45 silenced. Last, the antiviral genes ISG15 and IFIT3 mRNAs were also increased with knockdown of FBXO45 but reduced with IFNLR1 silencing. Together, these data suggest that FBXO45 plays a key role in attenuating antiviral host defense to facilitate influenza virulence. Given the molecular interaction of FBXO45 with IFNLR1 and its ability to antagonize interferon signaling, we next assessed the F-box protein on its ability to modulate receptor protein degradation. We transfected BEAS-2B cells with FLAG-tagged FBXO45 plasmid or empty vector at 0.5 or 1.0 μg for 48 h and observed a reduction of endogenous IFNLR1 by ∼35% versus empty vector (Fig. 5A). We also transfected BEAS-2B cells with V5-tagged IFNLR1 plasmid and either V5-tagged FBXO45 or an empty vector at 0.5, 1, or 2 μg for 24 h and observed a dose-dependent reduction in steady-state IFNLR1 mass (Fig. 5B). When BEAS-2B cells were transfected as above with an empty vector or with a FBXO45-mutant plasmid (lacking E3 ligase catalytic activity) followed by a CHX chase, we found that WT FBXO45 overexpression accelerated IFNLR1 protein decay and tended to reduce its half-life (Fig. 5C), whereas there was no change in half-life with expression of a FBXO45-mutant versus an empty construct (Fig. S2). Conversely, when we silenced FBXO45 in BEAS-2B cells, we found increased endogenous IFNLR1 lifespan (Fig. 5D). Similar findings were observed when we transfected BEAS-2B cells with V5-tagged IFNLR1 and two separate DsiRNA’s targeting FBXO45 (Figs. 5E and S3). These results strongly implicate FBXO45 as an E3 ligase component that specifically regulates IFNLR1 protein turnover. To further assess the molecular signatures involved in IFNLR1 protein destabilization, we constructed IFNLR1 point mutants at candidate lysines within the cytoplasmic region: K319/320 (double site) and K410. After cellular expression, we analyzed IFNLR1-WT, IFNLR1-K319R/K320R, and IFNLR1-K410R t1/2 using CHX over 6 h (Fig. 6A). Notably, IFNLR1-K319R/K320R remained stable with a longer t1/2, whereas IFNLR1-WT and IFNLR1-K410R degraded rapidly over time. We then evaluated levels of polyubiquitination of these mutants by cotransfecting V5-tagged constructs and HA-tagged ubiquitin in HEK-293T cells followed by treatment with MG-132. Cell lysates were harvested with DUB inhibitors, 1,10-phenanthroline, PR-619, and N-ethylmaleimide (NEM). Polyubiquitination was evaluated by immunoprecipitation, which revealed greater signal intensity in IFNLR1-WT and IFNLR1-K410R in comparison to the IFNLR1-K319R/K320R variant (Fig. 6B). To inspect whether the IFNLR1 double mutant could resist degradation with the presence of FBXO45, HEK-293T cells were cotransfected with either V5-tagged IFNLR1-WT or IFNLR1-K319R/K320R and FLAG-tagged FBXO45 or GFP-tagged empty vector. Here, the IFNLR1-K319R/K320R was stable despite ectopic expression of FBXO45 (Fig. 6C). Finally, because influenza infection increased IFNLR1 degradation, we evaluated the stability of the IFNLR1-K319R/K320R variant after PR8 infection for 3 h. The data show that IFNLR1-K319R/K320R was more resistant to viral-induced degradation than IFNLR1-WT (Fig. 6D). Thus, the results suggest that degradation of IFNLR1 occurs via polyubiquitination via the SCFFBXO45 E3 ligase, possibly at the K319/K320 molecular site(s) during influenza infection.Figure 6Ectopically expressed IFNLR1 variant displays proteolytic resistance to influenza infection and FBXO45.

IFN-λ, acting via IFNLR1, has been shown to be important in the resolution of viral, bacterial, and fungal infections (2Ye L. Schnepf D. Staeheli P.

IFNLR1 is predominately found on epithelial cells, which can provide localized antiviral protection along barrier surfaces. Studies have shown that early IFN-λ treatment in mice during influenza virus infection offers significant antiviral protection without the proinflammatory responses associated with Type 1 interferons (6Galani I.E.

Although we have previously demonstrated the presence of the IFN-λ–IFNLR1 signaling axis in human lung macrophages and its role in combating influenza infection, the expression, signaling, and molecular regulation of IFNLR1 in human bronchial epithelial cells has not been fully elucidated (26Mallampalli R.K.

The new contributions in this study provide associations between influenza infection of epithelia, FBXO45, and its interaction with IFNLR1 triggering its degradation. The F-box protein is induced after viral infection and in an unbiased screen, FBXO45 binds IFNLR1 that appears to be localized to a region spanning 50 AA within the cytoplasmic domain. This region (AA 360–410) appears downstream of previously identified binding sites for human Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) that also binds the intracellular domain of IFNLR1 (27Zhang D. Wlodawer A. Lubkowski J. Crystal structure of a complex of the intracellular domain of interferon λ receptor 1 (IFNLR1) and the FERM/SH2 domains of human JAK1.J. Mol.

https://openalex.org/W4309135105,"Despite the need, adolescents and young adults (AYAs) in resource-limited settings have limited access to sexual and reproductive health (SRH) care services for improved health outcomes. This is worse for AYAs living with HIV in resource-limited settings where much is unknown about contexts and issues inhibiting access to SRHs. We explored adolescents’, healthcare workers, and caregivers’ preferences for access to sexual and reproductive health services for adolescents and young adults living with HIV. We conducted 30 in-depth interviews and 8 focus group discussions among a subset of AYA aged 14–24 living with HIV, healthcare workers, and caregivers/parents. We recruited participants from Lumumba Sub-County Hospital (KLM) and Kisumu County Referral Hospitals in Kisumu County (KCH). Trained and experienced qualitative research assistants 5–10 years older than the adolescents conducted interviews and facilitated discussions using guides designed to elicit detailed views and perspectives on sex and sexuality, access to SRH services, challenges of AYA living with HIV, and potential interventions to improve access to SRH services. Audio files were transcribed verbatim and translated to English where necessary before coding and analysis. We applied constant comparative analysis for theme and content to arrive at our conclusions. Our analysis yielded two main themes: preferences for a venue for SRH services and choices for qualities of an SRH counsellor. We found that AYAs generally preferred receiving SRH services to be co-situated within clinical facilities. We also observed gender differences in the qualities of SRH providers, with male AYAs preferring older male service providers compared to females who preferred younger female providers close to their age. The study highlighted the preferences of AYAs for accessing SRH, which need to be considered when designing their health programs. Further, AYAs seem to endite health systems to individualize access to SRH for AYAs living with HIV by providing a combination of attributes that meet individual preferences."

https://openalex.org/W4309135141,"To promote health awareness and improve life expectancy in Hirosaki, a Japanese rural area, the Center of Healthy Aging Program (CHAP) was founded in 2013. The most important characteristic of CHAP is a personalized interview just after the checkup to discuss individual results. We evaluated the clinical and economic effects of CHAP by analyzing the cohort data of voluntary participants from annual health checkups since 2005 in the Iwaki district of Hirosaki. We calculated 10-year incidence risk scores for coronary heart diseases (CHDs) and stroke, and compared the risk-score trend before and after the start of CHAP by adjusting other risk factors using multivariate generalized linear regression analyses. We also predicted the 10-year incidences of CHDs and stroke based on the risk scores, for future scenarios of the two conditions, with and without CHAP, and compared them to their treatment costs between scenarios. The number of participants ranged between 808 and 1,167, from 2008 to 2016. The mean age (55 years) and proportion of women (60%) did not significantly change throughout the period. After adjusting for sex, age, outside temperature on the checkup date, the preparation effect of CHAP in 2012, and risk scores in the previous year, the annual increases in risk scores of CHDs and stroke were significant even after CHAP (+0.413, p &lt;0.001; +0.169, p &lt;0.001, respectively), but slightly less compared to before CHAP (+2.638, p &lt;0.001; +1.155, p &lt;0.001, respectively). Assuming the trend continued until 2021, the 10-year incidences of CHDs and stroke have decreases by 22,486 and 9,603, respectively, and treatment costs decreased by JPY 21,973 and 16,056 million, respectively. CHAP contributes to a significant decrease in the incidences of CHDs and stroke, and reduces economic burden on the local government."

This research was designed to develop carrot-supplemented tomato sauce to overcome vit-A deficiency and its related disorders. The carrot sauce was formulated with the addition of 50, 60, and 70% carrot pulp in tomato paste. The prepared sauce samples were tested for physical and biochemical changes in beta carotene (BC), lycopene, viscosity, pH, total soluble solids, titratable acidity, total plate count, and sensory parameters for 12 weeks. A non-significant effect of storage on BC, lycopene, and total soluble solids was observed. The total plate count, acidity, pH, and viscosity were influenced significantly. Sauce containing 60% of the carrot paste showed good sensory characteristics and 42.39 μg/g BC for the whole period of storage. It is concluded that carrot sauce can be used as tomato ketchup replacers to boost the overall quality of life by fighting against vit-A deficiency disorders."

Mice received subcutaneous injection of capsaicin (50 mg/kg; CAP group) for desensitization of TRPV1 channels or vehicle (control [CON] group). In Experiment 1, heat-escape/cold-seeking behavior was assessed using a newly developed system comprising five temperature-controlled boards placed in a cross-shape. Each mouse completed three 90-min trials. In the trials, the four boards, including the center board, were set at either 36˚C, 38˚C, or 40˚C, while one corner board was set at 32˚C, which was rotated every 5 min. In Experiment 2, mice were exposed to an ambient temperature of 37˚C for 30 min. cFos expression in the preoptic area of the hypothalamus (POA) was assessed. In Experiment 1, the CON group stayed on the 32˚C board for the longest duration relative to that on other boards, and intra-abdominal temperature (T abd ) was maintained. In the CAP group, no preference for the 32˚C board was observed, and T abd increased. In Experiment 2, cFos expression in the POA decreased in the CAP group. Capsaicin-induced desensitization of TRPV1 channels suppressed heat-escape/cold-seeking behavior in mice during heat exposure, resulting in hyperthermia. In conclusion, our findings suggest that heat sensation from the body surface may be a key inducer of thermoregulatory behaviors in mice."

https://openalex.org/W4309138822,"Introduction This study aims to investigate the health-related quality of life and coping strategies among COVID-19 survivors in Bangladesh. Methods This is a cross-sectional study of 2198 adult, COVID-19 survivors living in Bangladesh. Data were collected from previously diagnosed COVID-19 participants (confirmed by an RT-PCR test) via door-to-door interviews in the eight different divisions in Bangladesh. For data collection, Bengali-translated Brief COPE inventory and WHO Brief Quality of Life (WHO-QoLBREF) questionnaires were used. The data collection period was from October 2020 to March 2021. Results Males 72.38% (1591) were more affected by COVID-19 than females 27.62% (607). Age showed significant correlations (p&lt;0.005) with physical, psychological and social relationships, whereas gender showed only a significant correlation with physical health (p&lt;0.001). Marital status, occupation, living area, and co-morbidities showed significant co-relation with all four domains of QoL (p&lt;0.001). Education and affected family members showed significant correlation with physical and social relationship (p&lt;0.001). However, smoking habit showed a significant correlation with both social relationship and environment (p&lt;0.001). Age and marital status showed a significant correlation with avoidant coping strategies (p&lt;0.001); whereas gender and co-morbidities showed a significant correlation with problem-focused coping strategies (p&lt;0.001). Educational qualification, occupation and living area showed significant correlation with all three coping strategies(p&lt;0.001). Conclusion Survivors of COVID-19 showed mixed types of coping strategies; however, the predominant coping strategy was avoidant coping, followed by problem-focused coping, with emotion-focused coping reported as the least prevalent. Marital status, occupation, living area and co-morbidities showed a greater effect on QoL in all participants. This study represents the real scenario of nationwide health-associated quality of life and coping strategies during and beyond the Delta pandemic."

As a breakthrough of artificial intelligence (AI), deep learning has been applied to perform COVID-19 infection region segmentation and disease classification by analyzing CXR and CT data. However, prediction uncertainty of deep learning models for these tasks, which is very important to safety-critical applications like medical image processing, has not been comprehensively investigated. In this work, we propose a novel ensemble deep learning model through integrating bagging deep learning and model calibration to not only enhance segmentation performance, but also reduce prediction uncertainty. The proposed method has been validated on a large dataset that is associated with CXR image segmentation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can improve the segmentation performance, as well as decrease prediction uncertainty."
https://openalex.org/W4309138833,"The aims of this research are: to investigate and develop a multilevel analysis of unsafe actions or risky behaviors; to study the influence of road safety policy factors on risky behaviors; and to analyze personal characteristics that influence risky behaviors. Data were collected using 1,474 samples from locations countrywide at the district level, including 76 clusters, via the Driver Behavior Questionnaire (DBQ) and road safety policy. The results indicate that, for the district-level model, the participation factor directly and negatively influenced risky behaviors, and government support indirectly had a negative impact through participation. Thus, people’s participation in the area caused a decrease in unsafe behaviors. Meanwhile, safety policy support in the area partially caused people to participate at a significant level. At the personal level, income, having a driver’s license, past violations, and past accidents significantly affected risky behaviors, especially having a driver’s license, which had a negative influence. This meant that people who had a driver’s license facilitated a positive effect in terms of decreasing risky behaviors, while people with past violations and past accidents influenced this situation positively. The more traffic law violations and accidents the participants had, the more they engaged in unsafe actions. Based on the findings, acknowledging and solving the problem of unsafe driving at a spatial level can address the issue by supporting different measures to help people in the area improve the situation. In addition, we should assist people who have a driver’s license by offering them useful training to decrease traffic law violations and inform them about accidents."
https://openalex.org/W4309138957,"Variation of the bark depends on tree age, origin, geographic location, or site conditions like temperature and water availability. Most of these variables are characterized by very high variability but above of all are also affected by climate changes. This requires the construction of improved bark thickness models that take this complexity into account. We propose a new approach based on time series. We used a recurrent neural network (ANN) to build the bark thickness model and compare it with stem taper curves adjusted to predict double bark thickness. The data includes 750 felled trees from common oak and 144 Scots pine—trees representing dominant forest-forming tree species in Europe. The trees were selected across stands varied in terms of age and site conditions. Based on the data, we built recurrent ANN and calculated bark thickness along the stem. We tested different network structures with one- and two-time window delay and three learning algorithms—Bayesian Regularization, Levenberg-Marquardt, and Scaled Conjugate Gradient. The evaluation criteria of the models were: coefficient of determination, root mean square error, mean absolute error as well as graphical analysis of observed and estimated values. The results show that recurrent ANN is a universal approach that offers the most precise estimation of bark thickness at a particular stem height. The ANN recursive model had an advantage in estimating trees that were atypical for height, as well as upper and lower parts on the stem."

We investigated the prevalence of depression and anxiety symptoms among the participants of the United Arab Emirates Healthy Future Study (UAEHFS); a national cohort study. We further explored the change in the prevalence of depression symptoms among those with comparable pre-pandemic data. Methods A sample of UAEHFS participants were invited to complete a COVID-19 online questionnaire during the first wave of the pandemic. Depression and anxiety symptoms were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire Depression Scale (PHQ-8) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 Scale (GAD-7) respectively. Unpaired analyses were done to examine the effect of COVID-19 on depression and anxiety symptoms during the pandemic. Paired analysis was conducted to examine the change in depression symptoms. Results During the pandemic, we reported a prevalence of 32.8% (95% CI: 27.0, 39.1) for depression and 26.4% (95% CI: 21.0, 32.6) for anxiety symptoms. Younger people reported higher levels of depression (40.4%) and anxiety (34.5%) symptoms. Females reported higher levels of depression (36.5%) and anxiety (32.7%) symptoms. In paired analysis, the prevalence of depression symptoms during the pandemic was 34% (95% CI: 26.5, 42.4) compared to 29.9% (95% CI: 22.7, 38.1) before the pandemic. No statistically significant difference was observed, p-value = 0.440. Adjusted multivariate logistic regression models for PHQ-8 and GAD-7 during the pandemic showed that participants, who were experiencing flu-like symptoms, had higher odds of reporting depression symptoms compared to those without symptoms. Additionally, age was significantly negatively associated with anxiety symptoms. Conclusions Overall, we found that depression and anxiety symptoms were more prevalent among young people and females. However, we did not find a significant change in the prevalence of depression symptoms among those with comparable pre-pandemic data. Identifying vulnerable groups and understanding trajectories through longitudinal studies would help with planning for effective mental health interventions for the current and future pandemics."

Based on the 2010-2019 financial disclosures of 1,231 publicly traded health care companies in the U.S. that reported positive assets and equity, we estimated the industry-specific fixed effects on ROE and its three components-profit margin, asset utilization, and financial leverage-for ten industries in the health care sector, classified by the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS). For each industry, we also estimated its fixed effects on ROE volatility. We found that the pharmaceuticals industry and biotechnology industry have lower ROE-mainly driven by their relatively low profit margin and low assets utilization-and higher ROE volatility than other health care industries. We also found that the health care facilities industry relies most on debt financing. This study demonstrates a holistic approach for profitability comparison across industries."
https://openalex.org/W4309139253,"One of the main problems currently facing the delivery of safe and effective emergency care is excess demand, which causes congestion at different time points in a patient's journey. The modern case-mix of prehospital patients is broad and complex, diverging from the traditional 'time critical accident and emergency' patients. It now includes many low-acuity patients and those with social care and mental health needs. In the ambulance service, transport decisions are the hardest to make and paramedics decide to take more patients to the ED than would have a clinical benefit. As such, this study asked the following research questions: In adult patients attending the ED by ambulance, can prehospital information predict an avoidable attendance? What is the simulated transportability of the model derived from the primary outcome? A linked dataset of 101,522 ambulance service and ED ambulance incidents linked to their respective ED care record from the whole of Yorkshire between 1st July 2019 and 29th February 2020 was used as the sample for this study. A machine learning method known as XGBoost was applied to the data in a novel way called Internal-External Cross Validation (IECV) to build the model. The results showed great discrimination with a C-statistic of 0.81 (95%CI 0.79-0.83) and excellent calibration with an O:E ratio was 0.995 (95% CI 0.97-1.03), with the most important variables being a patient's mobility, their physiological observations and clinical impression with psychiatric problems, allergic reactions, cardiac chest pain, head injury, non-traumatic back pain, and minor cuts and bruising being the most important. This study has successfully developed a decision-support model that can be transformed into a tool that could help paramedics make better transport decisions on scene, known as the SINEPOST model. It is accurate, and spatially validated across multiple geographies including rural, urban, and coastal. It is a fair algorithm that does not discriminate new patients based on their age, gender, ethnicity, or decile of deprivation. It can be embedded into an electronic Patient Care Record system and automatically calculate the probability that a patient will have an avoidable attendance at the ED, if they were transported. This manuscript complies with the Transparent Reporting of a multivariable prediction model for Individual Prognosis Or Diagnosis (TRIPOD) statement (Moons KGM, 2015)."
https://openalex.org/W4309150758,"Growth-associated protein 43 (GAP-43) has long been used as a marker for nerve regeneration following nerve injury, with numerous in vitro and animal studies showing its upregulation in regenerating neurons. In humans, expression of GAP-43 has predominantly been examined in skin biopsies from patients with peripheral neuropathies; with several studies showing a reduction in GAP-43 immunoreactive cutaneous nerve fibres. However, it remains elusive whether cutaneous GAP-43 is a valid marker for human nerve regeneration. Here, we present a cohort of 22 patients with electrodiagnostically confirmed carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS), used as a model system for focal nerve injury and neural regeneration after decompression surgery. We evaluate GAP-43 immunoreactivity and RNA expression levels in finger skin biopsies taken before and 6 months after surgery, relative to healthy controls. We further classify patients as 'regenerators' or 'non-regenerators' based on post-surgical epidermal re-innervation. We demonstrate that patients with CTS have lower GAP-43 positive intra-epidermal nerve fibre density (IENFD) before surgery than healthy controls. However, this difference disappears when normalising for total IENFD. Of note, we found surgery did not change GAP-43 expression in IENF, with no differences both in patients who were classified as regenerators and non-regenerators. We also did not identify pre-post surgical differences in cutaneous GAP-43 gene expression or associations with regeneration. These findings suggest cutaneous GAP-43 may not be a compelling marker for nerve regeneration in humans."
https://openalex.org/W4309166714,"Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) signaling pathway plays important roles in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression. Long intergenic non-protein coding RNAs (lincRNAs) are important components of TGF-β signaling pathway and perform their functions through different mechanisms. Here, we found that LINC02551 was activated by TGF-β transcriptionally and identified a 174-amino-acid peptide, Jun binding micropeptide (JunBP), encoded by LINC02551 in HCC tissues and HCC cell lines. Functional study showed that JunBP promotes HCC metastasis through binding to c-Jun and subsequent promotion of its phosphorylated activation. Activated c-Jun has higher binding affinity to SMAD3, which in turn leads to more SMAD3 recruited to the promoter region of LINC02551. We find a positive feedback among them, and this mechanism provides a novel potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target in HCC."
