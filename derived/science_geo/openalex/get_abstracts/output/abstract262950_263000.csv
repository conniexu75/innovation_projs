https://openalex.org/W2002900187,"The exploration of microarray data and data from other high-throughput projects for hypothesis generation has become a vital aspect of post-genomic research. For the non-bioinformatics specialist, however, many of the currently available tools provide overwhelming amounts of data that are presented in a non-intuitive way.In order to facilitate the interpretation and analysis of microarray data and data from other large-scale data sets, we have developed a tool, which we have dubbed the electronic Fluorescent Pictograph - or eFP - Browser, available at http://www.bar.utoronto.ca/, for exploring microarray and other data for hypothesis generation. This eFP Browser engine paints data from large-scale data sets onto pictographic representations of the experimental samples used to generate the data sets. We give examples of using the tool to present Arabidopsis gene expression data from the AtGenExpress Consortium (Arabidopsis eFP Browser), data for subcellular localization of Arabidopsis proteins (Cell eFP Browser), and mouse tissue atlas microarray data (Mouse eFP Browser).The eFP Browser software is easily adaptable to microarray or other large-scale data sets from any organism and thus should prove useful to a wide community for visualizing and interpreting these data sets for hypothesis generation."

The establishment of patterns of DNA methylation during gametogenesis depends in part on DNMT3L, an enzymatically inactive regulatory factor that is related in sequence to the DNA methyltransferases DNMT3A and DNMT3B. The main proteins that interact in vivo with the product of an epitope-tagged allele of the endogenous Dnmt3L gene were identified by mass spectrometry as DNMT3A2, DNMT3B and the four core histones. Peptide interaction assays showed that DNMT3L specifically interacts with the extreme amino terminus of histone H3; this interaction was strongly inhibited by methylation at lysine 4 of histone H3 but was insensitive to modifications at other positions. Crystallographic studies of human DNMT3L showed that the protein has a carboxy-terminal methyltransferase-like domain and an N-terminal cysteine-rich domain. Cocrystallization of DNMT3L with the tail of histone H3 revealed that the tail bound to the cysteine-rich domain of DNMT3L, and substitution of key residues in the binding site eliminated the H3 tail-DNMT3L interaction. These data indicate that DNMT3L recognizes histone H3 tails that are unmethylated at lysine 4 and induces de novo DNA methylation by recruitment or activation of DNMT3A2."
https://openalex.org/W2068226428,"A number of factors have recently caused mass coral mortality events in all of the world's tropical oceans. However, little is known about the timing, rate or spatial variability of the loss of reef-building corals, especially in the Indo-Pacific, which contains 75% of the world's coral reefs.We compiled and analyzed a coral cover database of 6001 quantitative surveys of 2667 Indo-Pacific coral reefs performed between 1968 and 2004. Surveys conducted during 2003 indicated that coral cover averaged only 22.1% (95% CI: 20.7, 23.4) and just 7 of 390 reefs surveyed that year had coral cover >60%. Estimated yearly coral cover loss based on annually pooled survey data was approximately 1% over the last twenty years and 2% between 1997 and 2003 (or 3,168 km(2) per year). The annual loss based on repeated measures regression analysis of a subset of reefs that were monitored for multiple years from 1997 to 2004 was 0.72 % (n = 476 reefs, 95% CI: 0.36, 1.08).The rate and extent of coral loss in the Indo-Pacific are greater than expected. Coral cover was also surprisingly uniform among subregions and declined decades earlier than previously assumed, even on some of the Pacific's most intensely managed reefs. These results have significant implications for policy makers and resource managers as they search for successful models to reverse coral loss."

https://openalex.org/W2011214216,"Symmetry-breaking interactions have a crucial role in many areas of physics, ranging from classical ferrofluids to superfluid (3)He and d-wave superconductivity. For superfluid quantum gases, a variety of new physical phenomena arising from the symmetry-breaking interaction between electric or magnetic dipoles are expected. Novel quantum phases in optical lattices, such as chequerboard or supersolid phases, are predicted for dipolar bosons. Dipolar interactions can also enrich considerably the physics of quantum gases with internal degrees of freedom. Arrays of dipolar particles could be used for efficient quantum information processing. Here we report the realization of a chromium Bose-Einstein condensate with strong dipolar interactions. By using a Feshbach resonance, we reduce the usual isotropic contact interaction, such that the anisotropic magnetic dipole-dipole interaction between 52Cr atoms becomes comparable in strength. This induces a change of the aspect ratio of the atom cloud; for strong dipolar interactions, the inversion of ellipticity during expansion (the usual 'smoking gun' evidence for a Bose-Einstein condensate) can be suppressed. These effects are accounted for by taking into account the dipolar interaction in the superfluid hydrodynamic equations governing the dynamics of the gas, in the same way as classical ferrofluids can be described by including dipolar terms in the classical hydrodynamic equations. Our results are a first step in the exploration of the unique properties of quantum ferrofluids."

https://openalex.org/W2066305078,"Histone methylation is crucial for regulating chromatin structure, gene transcription and the epigenetic state of the cell. LSD1 is a lysine-specific histone demethylase that represses transcription by demethylating histone H3 on lysine 4 (ref. 1). The LSD1 complex contains a number of proteins, all of which have been assigned roles in events upstream of LSD1-mediated demethylation apart from BHC80 (also known as PHF21A), a plant homeodomain (PHD) finger-containing protein. Here we report that, in contrast to the PHD fingers of the bromodomain PHD finger transcription factor (BPTF) and inhibitor of growth family 2 (ING2), which bind methylated H3K4 (H3K4me3), the PHD finger of BHC80 binds unmethylated H3K4 (H3K4me0), and this interaction is specifically abrogated by methylation of H3K4. The crystal structure of the PHD finger of BHC80 bound to an unmodified H3 peptide has revealed the structural basis of the recognition of H3K4me0. Knockdown of BHC80 by RNA inhibition results in the de-repression of LSD1 target genes, and this repression is restored by the reintroduction of wild-type BHC80 but not by a PHD-finger mutant that cannot bind H3. Chromatin immunoprecipitation showed that BHC80 and LSD1 depend reciprocally on one another to associate with chromatin. These findings couple the function of BHC80 to that of LSD1, and indicate that unmodified H3K4 is part of the 'histone code'. They further raise the possibility that the generation and recognition of the unmodified state on histone tails in general might be just as crucial as post-translational modifications of histone for chromatin and transcriptional regulation."

https://openalex.org/W2028705646,"Substantial quantities of terrigenous sediments are known to enter the mantle at subduction zones, but little is known about their fate in the mantle. Subducted sediment may be entrained in buoyantly upwelling plumes and returned to the Earth's surface at hotspots, but the proportion of recycled sediment in the mantle is small, and clear examples of recycled sediment in hotspot lavas are rare. Here we report remarkably enriched 87Sr/86Sr and 143Nd/144Nd isotope signatures in Samoan lavas from three dredge locations on the underwater flanks of Savai'i island, Western Samoa. The submarine Savai'i lavas represent the most extreme 87Sr/86Sr isotope compositions reported for ocean island basalts to date. The data are consistent with the presence of a recycled sediment component (with a composition similar to the upper continental crust) in the Samoan mantle. Trace-element data show affinities similar to those of the upper continental crust--including exceptionally low Ce/Pb and Nb/U ratios--that complement the enriched 87Sr/86Sr and 143Nd/144Nd isotope signatures. The geochemical evidence from these Samoan lavas significantly redefines the composition of the EM2 (enriched mantle 2; ref. 9) mantle endmember, and points to the presence of an ancient recycled upper continental crust component in the Samoan mantle plume."

https://openalex.org/W2076575551,"Extremely intense and ultrafast X-ray pulses from free-electron lasers offer unique opportunities to study fundamental aspects of complex transient phenomena in materials. Ultrafast time-resolved methods usually require highly synchronized pulses to initiate a transition and then probe it after a precisely defined time delay. In the X-ray regime, these methods are challenging because they require complex optical systems and diagnostics. Here we propose and apply a simple holographic measurement scheme, inspired by Newton's 'dusty mirror' experiment, to monitor the X-ray-induced explosion of microscopic objects. The sample is placed near an X-ray mirror; after the pulse traverses the sample, triggering the reaction, it is reflected back onto the sample by the mirror to probe this reaction. The delay is encoded in the resulting diffraction pattern to an accuracy of one femtosecond, and the structural change is holographically recorded with high resolution. We apply the technique to monitor the dynamics of polystyrene spheres in intense free-electron-laser pulses, and observe an explosion occurring well after the initial pulse. Our results support the notion that X-ray flash imaging can be used to achieve high resolution, beyond radiation damage limits for biological samples. With upcoming ultrafast X-ray sources we will be able to explore the three-dimensional dynamics of materials at the timescale of atomic motion."
https://openalex.org/W2061488342,"Background Cannabinoids have deleterious effects on prefrontal cortex (PFC)-mediated functions and multiple evidences link the endogenous cannabinoid (endocannabinoid) system, cannabis use and schizophrenia, a disease in which PFC functions are altered. Nonetheless, the molecular composition and the physiological functions of the endocannabinoid system in the PFC are unknown. Methodology/Principal Findings Here, using electron microscopy we found that key proteins involved in endocannabinoid signaling are expressed in layers V/VI of the mouse prelimbic area of the PFC: presynaptic cannabinoid CB1 receptors (CB1R) faced postsynaptic mGluR5 while diacylglycerol lipase α (DGL-α), the enzyme generating the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoyl-glycerol (2-AG) was expressed in the same dendritic processes as mGluR5. Activation of presynaptic CB1R strongly inhibited evoked excitatory post-synaptic currents. Prolonged synaptic stimulation at 10Hz induced a profound long-term depression (LTD) of layers V/VI excitatory inputs. The endocannabinoid -LTD was presynaptically expressed and depended on the activation of postsynaptic mGluR5, phospholipase C and a rise in postsynaptic Ca2+ as predicted from the localization of the different components of the endocannabinoid system. Blocking the degradation of 2-AG (with URB 602) but not of anandamide (with URB 597) converted subthreshold tetanus to LTD-inducing ones. Moreover, inhibiting the synthesis of 2-AG with Tetrahydrolipstatin, blocked endocannabinoid-mediated LTD. All together, our data show that 2-AG mediates LTD at these synapses. Conclusions/Significance Our data show that the endocannabinoid -retrograde signaling plays a prominent role in long-term synaptic plasticity at the excitatory synapses of the PFC. Alterations of endocannabinoid -mediated synaptic plasticity may participate to the etiology of PFC-related pathologies."
https://openalex.org/W2121208056,"Knowledge of how mosquitoes respond to insecticides is of paramount importance in understanding how an insecticide functions to prevent disease transmission. A suite of laboratory assays was used to quantitatively characterize mosquito responses to toxic, contact irritant, and non-contact spatial repellent actions of standard insecticides. Highly replicated tests of these compounds over a range of concentrations proved that all were toxic, some were contact irritants, and even fewer were non-contact repellents. Of many chemicals tested, three were selected for testing in experimental huts to confirm that chemical actions documented in laboratory tests are also expressed in the field. The laboratory tests showed the primary action of DDT is repellent, alphacypermethrin is irritant, and dieldrin is only toxic. These tests were followed with hut studies in Thailand against marked-released populations. DDT exhibited a highly protective level of repellency that kept mosquitoes outside of huts. Alphacypermethrin did not keep mosquitoes out, but its strong irritant action caused them to prematurely exit the treated house. Dieldrin was highly toxic but showed no irritant or repellent action. Based on the combination of laboratory and confirmatory field data, we propose a new paradigm for classifying chemicals used for vector control according to how the chemicals actually function to prevent disease transmission inside houses. The new classification scheme will characterize chemicals on the basis of spatial repellent, contact irritant and toxic actions."
https://openalex.org/W2030444202,"We consider sex differences in human facial morphology in the context of developmental change. We show that at puberty, the height of the upper face, between the lip and the brow, develops differently in males and females, and that these differences are not explicable in terms of sex differences in body size. We find the same dimorphism in the faces of human ancestors. We propose that the relative shortening in men and lengthening in women of the anterior upper face at puberty is the mechanistic consequence of extreme maxillary rotation during ontogeny. A link between this developmental model and sexual dimorphism is made for the first time, and provides a new set of morphological criteria to sex human crania. This finding has important implications for the role of sexual selection in the evolution of anthropoid faces and for theories of human facial attractiveness."

https://openalex.org/W2070273307,"Acoel flatworms are small marine worms traditionally considered to belong to the phylum Platyhelminthes. However, molecular phylogenetic analyses suggest that acoels are not members of Platyhelminthes, but are rather extant members of the earliest diverging Bilateria. This result has been called into question, under suspicions of a long branch attraction (LBA) artefact. Here we re-examine this problem through a phylogenomic approach using 68 different protein-coding genes from the acoel Convoluta pulchra and 51 metazoan species belonging to 15 different phyla. We employ a mixture model, named CAT, previously found to overcome LBA artefacts where classical models fail. Our results unequivocally show that acoels are not part of the classically defined Platyhelminthes, making the latter polyphyletic. Moreover, they indicate a deuterostome affinity for acoels, potentially as a sister group to all deuterostomes, to Xenoturbellida, to Ambulacraria, or even to chordates. However, the weak support found for most deuterostome nodes, together with the very fast evolutionary rate of the acoel Convoluta pulchra, call for more data from slowly evolving acoels (or from its sister-group, the Nemertodermatida) to solve this challenging phylogenetic problem."
https://openalex.org/W1992295760,"Oxidative stress is linked to many pathological conditions, including ischemia, atherosclerosis and neurodegenerative disorders. The molecular mechanisms of oxidative stress induced pathophysiology and cell death are currently poorly understood. Our present work demonstrates that oxidative stress induced by reactive oxygen species and cigarette smoke extract depolarize the cell membrane and open connexin hemichannels. Under oxidative stress, connexin expression and connexin silencing resulted in increased and reduced cell deaths, respectively. Morphological and live/dead assays indicate that cell death is likely through apoptosis. Our studies provide new insights into the mechanistic role of hemichannels in oxidative stress induced cell injury."
https://openalex.org/W1967588679,"The recently characterized enzyme NEIL2 (Nei-like-2), one of the four oxidized base-specific DNA glycosylases (OGG1, NTH1, NEIL1, and NEIL2) in mammalian cells, has poor base excision activity from duplex DNA. To test the possibility that one or more proteins modulate its activity in vivo, we performed mass spectrometric analysis of the NEIL2 immunocomplex and identified Y box-binding (YB-1) protein as a stably interacting partner of NEIL2. We show here that YB-1 not only interacts physically with NEIL2, but it also cooperates functionally by stimulating its base excision activity by 7-fold. Moreover, YB-1 interacts with the other NEIL2-associated BER proteins, namely, DNA ligase IIIα and DNA polymerase β and thus could form a large multiprotein complex. YB-1, normally present in the cytoplasm, translocates to the nucleus during UVA-induced oxidative stress, concomitant with its increased association with and activation of NEIL2. NEIL2-initiated base excision activity is significantly reduced in YB-1-depleted cells. YB-1 thus appears to have a novel regulatory role in NEIL2-mediated repair under oxidative stress.

ROS are formed endogenously as a byproduct of respiration and oxidative metabolism and exogenously by a variety of environmental agents including ultraviolet (UV) radiation (3Kasai H. Crain P.F.

Of the total ultraviolet light spectrum (100–400 nm) present in the natural sunlight, only UVA (320–400 nm) and a small fraction of UVB (280–320 nm) reach the surface of the earth, as UVB is mostly absorbed by the atmosphere. Although UVA is the predominant genotoxic radiation in the natural environment, it does not react directly with DNA, but interacts with cellular chromophores like riboflavin, porphyrins, quinones, and reduced nicotinamide cofactors to produce singlet oxygen (6Kvam E. Tyrrell R.M. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1999; 113: 209-213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar).

Although cellular antioxidant defenses (e.g. catalase, peroxidase, and superoxide dismutase) effectively combat the effects of ROS, but oxidative DNA damage still occurs.

Cell Culture and Chemicals—Human colon carcinoma HCT116 cells (with wild-type p53), a gift of B.

This treatment did not affect cell viability, as judged by trypan blue staining and the rate of cell growth. Before UVA treatment, cells were incubated with riboflavin, a photosensitizer at a concentration of 0.25 mg/ml for 1 h. N-Acetyl l-cysteine (NAC) (from Sigma) was used as scavenger of ROS at an optimized concentration of 10 mm for 5 h prior to UVA or glucose oxidase treatment. Purification of NEIL2—For biochemical studies, full-length C-terminal His6-tagged NEIL2 (residues 1–331) was expressed and purified from Sf9 insect cells (19Das A. Wiederhold L. Leppard J.B. Kedar P. Prasad R. Wang H. Boldogh I. Karimi-Busheri F. Weinfeld M. Tomkinson A.E. Wilson S.H. Mitra S. Hazra T.K. DNA Repair. 2006; 5: 1439-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Two major non-overlapping domains of NEIL2 consisted of N-terminal (residues 1–198) and C-terminal (residues 199–331) fragments, both His tag at the C terminus, were purified on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-NTA-agarose, followed by SP-Sepharose chromatography (19Das A. Wiederhold L. Leppard J.B. Kedar P. Prasad R. Wang H. Boldogh I. Karimi-Busheri F. Weinfeld M. Tomkinson A.E. Wilson S.H. Mitra S. Hazra T.K.

Construction, Expression, and Purification of WT and Deletion Mutants of YB-1—The baculovirus containing N-terminal His-tagged YB-1 was a kind gift from Dr. G. W. Teebor (New York University School of Medicine). Wild type (WT) YB-1 was purified according to the protocol described earlier (24Marenstein D.R. Ocampo M.T. Chan M.K. Altamirano A. Basu A.K. Boorstein R.J. Cunningham R.P. Teebor G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21242-21249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The generation of plasmids containing full-length GST-YB-1 and five GST-YB-1 deletion mutants (GST-YB-1Δ1, -Δ2, -Δ3, -Δ4, and Δ5) have been described previously (25Ise T. Nagatani G. Imamura T. Kato K. Takano H. Nomoto M. Izumi H. Ohmori H. Okamoto T. Ohga T. Uchiumi T. Kuwano M. Kohno K. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 342-346PubMed Google Scholar). Further deletion constructs Δ6, Δ7, Δ8, and Δ9 were generated by PCR amplification with appropriate primers, digested with BamHI/XhoI restriction sites, and cloned in corresponding BamHI/XhoI restriction sites into pGEX-4T. After transformation, bacterial clones producing fusion proteins were tested by Western blot using GST antibodies. For purification of WT and mutant YB-1, colonies of freshly transformed E. coli BL21(DE3) RIPL (Stratagene) with expression plasmids for WT or different mutants were grown into Luria broth containing 150 μg/ml ampicillin and 100 μg/ml chloramphenicol at 37 °C. Isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (0.3 mm) was added when A590 reached ∼0.4–0.5 and the incubation was continued overnight at 16 °C. Bacterial cell lysate was prepared after sonication with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40. Lysate was centrifuged and cleared supernatant was used in the equilibrated EZView™ red glutathione-agarose affinity beads (Sigma). After incubation at 4 °C for 2 h, the beads were washed three times with lysis buffer. GST-tagged (N terminus) proteins were eluted with 10 mm reduced glutathione in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Purity of each deletion mutant was checked in SDS-PAGE and the protein concentration was measured using Bradford reagent. Generation of Stable Transfectant of NEIL2—HCT116 cells were transfected with 1 μg each of NEIL2-FLAG (C terminus) or with the corresponding vector as described previously (26Bhakat K.K. Mokkapati S.K. Boldogh I. Hazra T.K. Mitra S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 1654-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). After 24 h, the cells were trypsinized and plated onto fresh medium in the presence of zeocin to select for clones carrying stably integrated plasmid DNA. Zeocin sensitivity of HCT116 cells were determined to be ∼200 μg/ml. Media was replaced each alternate day with 250, 500, and 1000 μg/ml zeocin. After 3 weeks, individual zeocin-resistant clones were transferred into 6-well plates. Surviving clones were expanded and the expressions of NEIL2-FLAG, as well as NEIL2, were tested. To maintain the stable cells, the zeocin concentration at 200 μg/ml was maintained throughout. The clone with stably expressing NEIL2-FLAG was named HCT116N. Identification of NEIL2-associated Proteins—To identify NEIL2-associated proteins, HCT116N and its corresponding vector control cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then with Tris-buffered saline (TBS, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA). Cells were then lysed with cold lysis buffer (TBS containing 1% Triton X-100 and a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche)). Cell lysates were precleared by centrifugation, and the supernatants were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma). Immunoprecipitates (IP) of both control and HCT116N cells were washed with TBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100, and complexes were eluted stepwise with 1 ml each of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 250 mm, 500 mm, or 1 m NaCl. Each fraction was precipitated with acetone, separated by SDS-PAGE, and stained with Coomassie Blue. Bands appearing in the NEIL2-FLAG IP but not in the control IP were excised for in-gel trypsin digestion followed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Generation of Anti-YB-1 Antibody—A synthetic peptide, CDGKETKAADPPAENS (27Ohga T. Koike K. Ono M. Makino Y. Itagaki Y. Tanimoto M. Kuwano M. Kohno K. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4224-4228PubMed Google Scholar), corresponding to the deduced amino acid residues 299–313 of the human YB-1 was chemically coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin and used to raise polyclonal antibody in rabbits (Biomolecular Resource Facility Core, University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB)). The antibody was affinity purified from crude antiserum by adsorption to and elution from the above synthetic peptide immobilized on CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) and was used for Western blot analysis. Co-immunoprecipitation—HCT116N cells were lysed in cold lysis buffer as described earlier (26Bhakat K.K. Mokkapati S.K. Boldogh I. Hazra T.K. Mitra S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 1654-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The IP from the lysates with anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma) were washed extensively with cold TBS and tested for the presence of YB-1. Anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma) was used to detect NEIL2-FLAG after stripping the membrane using Restore™ Western blot stripping buffer (Pierce). Subcellular Fractionation and Nuclear Extract Preparation—After UVA treatment, the cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and nuclear extract was prepared as described previously (28Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3903) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were harvested by scraping from the culture dishes into ice-cold equilibration buffer (EB: 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm DTT, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, and protease inhibitors) and collected by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm (18,000 × g) for 1 min at 4 °C. Cell pellets were resuspended in EB containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40 and incubated on ice for 15 min. The cytosolic fraction was then isolated by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm (25,000 × g) for 1 min, and the resulting pellet was washed once with EB, resuspended in nuclear extraction buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 0.42 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 2 mm DTT, 20% glycerol and protease inhibitors) and incubated on ice for 1 h with occasional vortexing. The extracted nuclear proteins were isolated by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm (25,000 × g) for 30 min. Incision Assay of DNA Glycosylases—Two 51-mer oligonucleotides containing either 5-OHU or 8-oxoG at position 26 from the 5′-end were purchased from Midland Certified Reagent. The complementary oligonucleotides that contained G or C opposite 5-OHU or 8-oxoG, respectively, or with sequences to generate bubble structures of 11 unpaired bases, and named B11 (Table 1) (20Dou H. Mitra S. Hazra T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49679-49684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar), were purchased from Invitrogen. The single-stranded oligonucleotides containing lesions were labeled at the 5′ terminus with [γ-32P]ATP and polynucleotide kinase before annealing to the complementary strand (20Dou H. Mitra S. Hazra T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49679-49684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). These oligonucleotide substrates (5OHU·G, 5OHU·B11, or 8-oxoG·B11) were incubated with NEIL2 (50–100 fmol) alone or with different amounts of YB-1 (50–400 fmol) in a buffer containing 40 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 5% glycerol, and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin for 10 min. The reactions were stopped by adding 70% formamide and 30 mm NaOH, and the cleaved oligo products were then separated by denaturing gel electrophoresis in 20% polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea, 90 mm Tris borate, pH 8.3, and 2 mm EDTA. The rate of product formation was linear under these reaction conditions. The radioactivity in the DNA bands was quantified by analysis in PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences) using Image Quant software. The Km and kcat values of NEIL2 were determined after incubating 5-OHU·B11 oligonucleotide substrates (2.5–80 nm) with NEIL2 (100 fmol) and YB-1 (200 fmol) for 3 min at 37 °C in the same reaction buffer as described above.TABLE 1Sequences of lesion-containing (L) and complementary (C) oligonucleotides C, complementary strand for generating duplex (G opposite 5-OHU) or bubbles of 11-nucleotide (B11) unpaired regions.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 462-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). After incubation in a denaturation buffer (6 m guanidine HCl in PBS) twice for 5 min at 4 °C, the membranes were incubated for 10 min each in serial dilutions of guanidine-HCl in PBS containing 1 mm DTT. The membranes were blocked with PBS containing 0.5% Tween 20 and 5% nonfat dry milk for 45 min at 20 °C. After two washes in PBS/Tween 20 (0.5%), nonfat dry milk, the blots were incubated with NEIL2 or with other proteins (10 pmol/ml) for 3 h at 4 °C in PBS/Tween 20 (0.5%), nonfat dry milk containing 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The filters were washed (4 × 10 min) in PBS/Tween 20 (0.25%), nonfat dry milk and then incubated with affinity-purified anti-NEIL2 antibody (or with other antibodies as mentioned) prior to secondary goat anti-rabbit antibody incubation, followed by ECL (Amersham Biosciences). GST Pull-down Assay—Wild type YB-1 and its various deletion mutants with GST tag were coupled to glutathione-agarose affinity beads (EZView red glutathione-agarose affinity gel from Sigma). Purified NEIL2 (∼400 ng) was allowed to interact with YB-1 and its different deletion mutants separately in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 1 mm DTT for 2 h. Beads were washed four times with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 250 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 1 mm DTT. The beads were then boiled with the sample buffer for Western analysis using anti-NEIL2 antibody. Down-regulation of YB-1 by siRNA—For down-regulation of YB-1 in HCT116N cells, ON-Target Plus SMART pool (L-010213–00-0005 Human YBX1, NM_004559) was purchased from Dharmacon and the supplied protocol was followed. Briefly, 40 and 80 nm YB-1 siRNA was transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. RNA and cell extract was prepared periodically to monitor the level of YB-1 expression by Western blot analysis and Real Time Quantitative RT-PCR. UVA Treatment—For UVA treatment, cells were irradiated at 365 nm wavelength by a UV lamp (5 watt model UVLMS-38; Ultra-Violet Product, Ltd., Upland, CA). For NEIL2-YB-1 interaction, 40 J/m2 was used with an exposure time of 20 s. The dose was optimized in this study to avoid cell killing. The dosage was measured with the help of a UV dosimeter (UVX-36 from UVP Inc.). The UVX-36 sensor is designed and calibrated to accurately measure 365 nm radiation. Measurements of Intracellular ROS Generation—The intracellular ROS level was determined by using 5-(and -6)-carboxy-2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (carboxy-H2DCFDA; Molecular Probes) as reported (30Wang H. Joseph J.A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 612-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (1938) Google Scholar). When carboxy-H2DCFDA is oxidized by ROS it is irreversibly converted to the fluorescent form, DCF. Level of ROS was then measured after UVA treatment as a function of time. HCT116N cells were cultured in a 24-well plate and loaded with 50 μm carboxy-H2DCF-DA for 30 min at 37 °C. Fluorescence intensities of cells were determined with a FLx800 microplate reader (Bio-Tek Instruments, Winooski, VT) at 488 nm excitation and 530 nm emission (31Boldogh I. Bacsi A. Choudhury B.K. Dharajiya N. Alam R. Hazra T.K. Mitra S. Goldblum R.M. Sur S. J. Clin. Investig. 2005; 115: 2169-2179Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). The -fold change in DCF fluorescence of UVA-treated cells compared with untreated cells was plotted. Identification of YB-1 as a NEIL2-interacting Protein—All cellular processes are regulated and coordinated via various macromolecular interactions. To elucidate the NEIL2-initiated base excision repair pathway, we generated HCT116 cells stably expressing FLAG-tagged NEIL2 (HCT116N) for immunoaffinity purification to identify NEIL2-associated proteins. The NEIL2 immunocomplexes (IC) were isolated from extracts of HCT116N and corresponding vector control HCT116 cells using anti-FLAG antibody beads (Sigma). NEIL2-FLAG-associated proteins in the IC were eluted with increasing salt concentrations, and resolved on SDS-PAGE, followed by in-gel trypsin digestion and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Among several NEIL2-interacting proteins eluted with 500 mm NaCl, we identified YB-1 (Fig. 1A, lane 2) and characterized its role in NEIL2-inititated BER. NEIL2 Stably Interacts with YB-1—Association of NEIL2 with YB-1 was further investigated by co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) analysis. The presence of YB-1 in the NEIL2-FLAG IP (Fig. 1B, lane 3), but not in the control IP (Fig. 1B, lane 2), confirmed the association of YB-1 with NEIL2. We used equal amounts of lysates for IP (Fig. 1B, lanes 4 and 5). To examine whether YB-1 interacts with NEIL2 directly or via association with other proteins, we examined in vitro association between NEIL2 and YB-1 by Far Western analysis. Fig. 1C shows that YB-1 (lane 5) interacted stably with NEIL2, but not with bovine serum albumin (lane 4). We have shown previously that NEIL2 has two major domains: namely the N-terminal (residue 1–198) and the C-terminal (residue 199–331) domains (19Das A. Wiederhold L. Leppard J.B. Kedar P. Prasad R. Wang H. Boldogh I. Karimi-Busheri F. Weinfeld M. Tomkinson A.E. Wilson S.H. Mitra S. Hazra T.K. DNA Repair. 2006; 5: 1439-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). These domains were tested individually for their interaction with immobilized YB-1 by Far Western analysis. Fig. 1C shows that the N-terminal domain (lane 7) but not the C-terminal domain (lane 9) stably interacted with YB-1. To identify its interacting region for NEIL2, we used various deletion mutants of YB-1 (Fig. 2A) (25Ise T. Nagatani G. Imamura T. Kato K. Takano H. Nomoto M. Izumi H. Ohmori H. Okamoto T. Ohga T. Uchiumi T. Kuwano M. Kohno K. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 342-346PubMed Google Scholar). YB-1 has three major domains. Its N terminus is involved in transcriptional regulation, the middle (cold shock domain) is involved in nucleic acid binding, and the C-terminal region is involved in protein-protein interaction (32Graumann P.L.

In KMCH cholangiocarcinoma cells stably expressing Mcl-1 small interference RNA (siRNA), treatment with TRAIL induced a redistribution of the cathepsin B from lysosomes to the cytosol. Pharmacological and small hairpin RNA-targeted inhibition of cathepsin B attenuated TRAIL-mediated apoptosis as assessed by morphological, biochemical, and clonogenic assays. Neither Bid siRNA nor Bak siRNA prevented cathepsin B release. In contrast, treatment of the cells with Bim siRNA or the JNK inhibitor SP600125 attenuated lysosomal permeabilization and cell death. Moreover, Bim and active Bax co-localized to lysosomes in TRAIL-treated cells in a JNK-dependent manner, and Bax siRNA reduced TRAIL-induced lysosomal permeabilization and cell death. Finally, BH3 domain peptides permeabilized isolated lysosomes in the presence of Bax. Collectively, these data suggest that TRAIL can trigger an apoptotic pathway that involves JNK-dependent activation of Bim, which in turn induces Bax-mediated permeabilization of lysosomes.

TRAIL induces apoptosis by binding to death receptors 4 and 5 (DR4/TRAIL-R1 and DR5/TRAIL-R2), type I transmembrane proteins that contain death domains in their cytosolic tails. TRAIL binding results in receptor oligomerization (4Wang S. El-Deiry W.S. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 8628-8633Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar) followed by recruitment of Fas-associated protein with death domain. This polypeptide in turn recruits procaspases-8 and -10 to the receptor complex through homotypic interactions involving death effecter domains in Fas-associated protein with death domain and these two apical caspases (4Wang S. El-Deiry W.S. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 8628-8633Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). The resulting activation of the bound caspases is essential for TRAIL-induced apoptosis (5Kischkel F.C.

The cytotoxicity of TRAIL is also regulated by members of the Bcl-2 family of polypeptides (6LeBlanc H.N. Ashkenazi A. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 66-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). In particular, the multidomain proapoptotic Bcl-2 family member Bax is essential for TRAIL-induced killing of a colon cancer cell line that has low level expression of Bak (7Deng Y. Lin Y. Wu X. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 33-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Other Bcl-2 family members also affect TRAIL action. We and others have demonstrated that the multidomain antiapoptotic protein Mcl-1 blocks TRAIL-mediated apoptosis in various cell lines (8Taniai M. Grambihler A. Higuchi H. Werneburg N. Bronk S.F.

The related proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL have also been reported to inhibit TRAIL-induced killing (11Burns T.F. El-Deiry W.S. J. Biol.

Conversely, certain proapoptotic BH3-only family members, which function as sensors of various cellular stresses (13Willis S.N. Adams J.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2005; 17: 617-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar), participate in TRAIL-induced killing. Specifically, Bid and Bim have both been implicated in TRAIL cytotoxicity (10Han J. Goldstein L.A. Gastman B.R. Rabinowich H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 10153-10163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 14Yamada H. Tada-Oikawa S. Uchida A. Kawanishi S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 265: 130-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). How these Bcl-2 family members integrate into a composite signaling pathway involving apical caspases and subsequent cellular killing remains incompletely understood. To add further complexity, ligation of TRAIL receptors is also associated with activation of various mitogen-associated protein kinases, including p38, extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK 1/2), and c-Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK) (15Varfolomeev E.

Of these, JNK has been most strongly associated with apoptosis induction (16Karin M. Gallagher E. IUBMB Life. 2005; 57: 283-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). JNK may induce apoptosis by catalyzing an activating phosphorylation of Bim (17Lei K. Davis R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2432-2437Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar, 18Putcha G.V. Le S. Frank S. Besirli C.G. Clark K. Chu B. Alix S. Youle R.J. LaMarche A. Maroney A.C. Johnson Jr., E.M. Neuron. 2003; 38: 899-914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar), which in turn may activate Bax, inactivate antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members, or both (19Kuwana T.

Thus, analysis of TRAIL signaling must also take into account kinase-activation events. TRAIL has extensive homology with TNF-α, which can also trigger apoptosis, in part, by inducing lysosomal permeabilization (20Guicciardi M.E. Deussing J. Miyoshi H. Bronk S.F. Svingen P.A. Peters C.

The release of lysosomal cathepsins, especially cathepsin B, into the cytosol is associated with apoptosis (20Guicciardi M.E. Deussing J. Miyoshi H. Bronk S.F. Svingen P.A. Peters C. Kaufmann S.H.

Cytosolic cathepsin B triggers mitochondrial dysfunction, thereby inducing cytochrome c release followed by caspase 9 activation (20Guicciardi M.E. Deussing J. Miyoshi H. Bronk S.F. Svingen P.A. Peters C. Kaufmann S.H. Gores G.J. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 1127-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). The one or more mechanisms by which lysosomal permeabilization occurs remains incompletely understood. Although sphingosine, ceramide, and reactive oxygen species have all been implicated in this phenomenon (25Guicciardi M.E. Leist M. Gores G.J. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2881-2890Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar), it is also possible that Bcl-2 proteins participate in the permeabilization of this organelle. Consistent with this possibility, Bax translocation to lysosomes and lysosomal permeabilization has recently been reported in fatty liver (26Feldstein A.E. Werneburg N.W. Li Z. Bronk S.F. Gores G.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 290: G1339-G1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 27Feldstein A.E. Werneburg N.W. Canbay A. Guicciardi M.E. Bronk S.F. Rydzewski R. Burgart L.J. Gores G.J. Hepatology. 2004; 40: 185-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). Despite the structural homology between TRAIL and TNF-α, the role of the lysosomal pathway in TRAIL-mediated cytotoxicity has remained unclear. In studies designed to address this question, we now identify a pathway that involves caspase-8-dependent JNK activation followed by a Bim- and Bax-dependent lysosomal permeabilization step that participates in TRAIL-induced cytotoxicity upstream of mitochondrial events. Cell Lines and Culture—KMCH and MZ-CHA-1 human cholangiocarcinoma cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 μg/ml gentamycin. KMCH cells stably transfected with an Mcl-1 small hairpin RNA (shMcl-1 KMCH cells) (8Taniai M. Grambihler A. Higuchi H. Werneburg N. Bronk S.F. Farrugia D.J. Kaufmann S.H. Gores G.J. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 3517-3524Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 10% calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin G, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 100 μg/ml gentamycin, and 200 μg/ml G418. Huh-7 human hepatocellular carcinoma cells were also cultured in DMEM containing the supplements described above, whereas Huh-7 cells stably transfected with a commercially available shRNA (CtsB shRNA-Huh-7) (28Guicciardi M.E. Bronk S.F. Werneburg N.W. Gores G.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2007; 292: G1337-G1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) were cultured in DMEM containing 200 μg/ml G418. Quantification of Apoptosis—Apoptosis was quantified by assessing the characteristic nuclear changes of apoptosis (i.e. chromatin condensation and nuclear fragmentation) after staining with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI, Sigma) and fluorescence microscopy using excitation and emission wavelengths of 380 and 430 nm, respectively. Caspase-3/7 activity in cell cultures was assessed by measuring rhodamine release from the caspase-3/7 substrate rhodamine 110, bis(N-CBZ-l-aspartyl-l-glutamyl-l-valyl-l-aspartic acid amide), using the Apo-ONE™ homogeneous caspase-3/7 kit (Promega, Madison, WI) following the supplier's instructions. Image Acquisition—Cellular images were obtained using an inverted confocal microscope (LSM510, Carl Zeiss Microimaging, Inc., Thornwood, NJ) equipped with a 63× numerical aperture (NA) 1.4 or a 100× NA 1.4 lens using LSM510 imaging software (Carl Zeiss Microimaging, Inc.). Immunocytochemistry—Cells for Bax and cytochrome c immunocytochemistry were grown on glass coverslips and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.1 m PIPES, 1 mm EGTA, and 3 mm MgSO4. For cathepsin B immunocytochemistry, cells were fixed in PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.19% picric acid. Cells were permeabilized with 0.0125% (w/v) CHAPS in PBS at 37 °C for 10 min and blocked for 1 h at room temperature with PBS containing 5% goat serum albumin, 5% glycerol, and 0.04% sodium azide. After incubation with primary antibody in blocking buffer at 4 °C overnight, cells were washed three times with PBS, incubated with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), or Cy3-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) at a dilution of 1:500 in blocking buffer for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were then washed three times in PBS and three times in H2O, mounted onto slides using a ProLong Antifade Kit (Molecular Probes), and imaged by confocal microscopy, with excitation and emission wavelengths of 488 nm and 507 nm (Alexa Fluor 488), and 577 nm and 590 nm (Cy3), respectively. The following primary antibodies were used: monoclonal mouse anti-cathepsin B from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA), monoclonal mouse anti-Bax (Clone 6A7) from Exalpha Biologicals (Watertown, MA), monoclonal mouse anti-Bax (B-9) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), monoclonal mouse anti-protein disulfide-isomerase (PDI, Affinity BioReagents, Golden, CO) and monoclonal mouse anti-cytochrome c (#556432) from BD Pharmingen (San Jose, CA). siRNA-targeted Protein Knockdown and Generation of the Mz-CHA-1-Bim shRNA Cell Line—A specific double-stranded 21-nucleotide RNA sequence homologous to the target message was used to silence human Bim, Bid, Bax, or Bak expression. siRNAs were designed and synthesized using a Silencer siRNA Construction kit from Ambion Inc. (Austin, TX) and software provided by the company. The sequences targeted in the current experiments were as follows: for Bim, 5′-AAC CTC CTT GCA TAG TAA GCG CCT GTC TC-3′ (T7-promoter in bold); for Bid, 5′-AAG AAG ACA TCA TCC GGA ATA CCT GTC TC-3′; for Bak, 5′-AAG TAC GAA GAT TCT TCA AAT CCT GTC TC-3′; and for Bax, 5′-AAG ACG AAC TGG ACA GTA ACA CCT GTC TC-3′. As a control, cells were also transfected with a scrambled RNA duplex with the following sequence: 5′-AAC GTG ATT TAT GTC ACC AGA-3′. Inhibition of protein expression was assessed by immunoblot analysis after transfection with the siRNAs. Briefly, cells grown in 12-well dishes were transiently transfected with 20 nm siRNA using 6 μl/ml siPORT Lipid (Ambion Inc.) in a total transfection volume of 0.5 ml of DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum. After incubation at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 4 h, 1.5 ml of normal growth medium was added. Cells were then incubated in medium for 40 h before being subjected to further studies. The Mz-CHA-1-Bim siRNA cell line was generated as follows. pSilencer 4.1-CMV neo (Ambion) plasmid containing the Bim targeting sequence (above) was transfected into Mz-CHA-1 cells using a standard Lipofectamine plus method. Stably transfected Mz-CHA-1 cells were selected in DMEM containing 1200 μg/ml neomycin. Individual colonies were subcloned and screened for Bim protein expression by immunoblot analysis. BimL-Green Fluorescent Protein (Bim-GFP)—Using primers designed to produce full-length BimL (forward primer, 5′-GTC CAT GAA TTC ACC ATG GCA AAG CAA CCT-3′; reverse primer, 5′-ACC TCA TCC TAG GTC ATT GCA TTC TCC A-3′), the 417-bp product was amplified by PCR, separated on a 1% agarose gel, and further purified by using the QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). The purified PCR product and pEGFP-N1 vector (Clontech, Mountain View, CA) were digested with EcoR1 and BamH1 (Invitrogen), ligated using standard techniques, and transformed into One Shot TOP10 competent cells (Invitrogen), which were plated on agar plates containing 30 μg/ml kanamycin. DNA for transfection was subsequently purified using a Quantum PrepR Plasmid Midiprep Kit from Bio-Rad (Hercules, CA). Splice junctions and insert were sequenced to confirm fidelity of the PCR reaction and the orientation of the Bim insert. Immunoblot Analysis—Whole cell lysates or lysosomal fractions were subjected to immunoblot analysis. Lysosomes were isolated from cell cultures using a commercially available Lysosome Isolation Kit (Sigma). Whole cell lysates were obtained by incubating cells for 30 min on ice with lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4; 1% Nonidet P-40; 0.25% sodium deoxycholate; 150 mm NaCl; 1 mm EDTA; 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; 1 μg/ml aprotinin, leupeptin, pepstatin; 1 mm Na3VO4; 1 mm NaF) followed by sedimentation at 14,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Samples were resolved by 15% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitro-cellulose membrane, and blotted with the indicated primary antibodies at a dilution of 1:1,000. Peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (BIOSOURCE International, Camarillo, CA) were incubated at a dilution of 1:5,000. Bound antibodies were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (ECL, Amersham Biosciences) and Kodak X-OMAT film. Primary antibodies used were the following: monoclonal mouse anti-lysosomal associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1) (BD Pharmingen); monoclonal mouse anti-PDI (Affinity BioReagents); monoclonal rat anti-Bim (Chemicon, Victoria, Australia); polyclonal rabbit anti-caspase 9, polyclonal rabbit anti-Bak, anti-JNK, and anti-phospho-JNK (Upstate Cell Signaling, Charlottesville, VA); and monoclonal mouse anti-Bax (B-9), polyclonal goat anti-cytochrome c oxidase II (K-20), polyclonal goat anti-cathepsin B (C-19), polyclonal goat anti-actin (C-11), and polyclonal goat anti-Bid (C-20) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Assessment and Quantitation of GFP-coupled Protein Compartmentalization by Confocal Microscopy—The Bax-GFP plasmid was described previously (29Pan Z. Bhat M.B. Nieminen A.L. Ma J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32257-32263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). MZ-CHA-1 cells were transfected with Bax-GFP or Bim-GFP (described above) using Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen). Briefly, transfections were performed using 1 ml of Opti-MEM-1 containing 6 μl of Plus reagent, 1 μg/ml plasmid DNA, and 6 μl/ml Lipofectamine reagent following the supplier's instructions. LysoTracker Red DND-99 or MitoTracker Red CMXRos (Molecular Probes) was loaded into cells by incubation in probe-containing medium at a final concentration of 50 nm for 15 min 37 °C. Cells were imaged by confocal microscopy using excitation and emission wavelengths of 488 and 507 nm for GFP and 577 and 590 nm for red fluorescence, respectively. Quantitation of co-localization was accomplished using the LSM510 imaging software. Briefly, random lines one pixel in width were drawn through the cells, and fluorescence intensity for both the green and red channels was quantified. A ratio of the green to red fluorescence was calculated yielding a percent pixel overlap. The data are expressed as percent pixel overlay for each experimental condition. Determination of Organelle-associated Cathepsin B and Cytochrome c Release into the Cytosol—Cells were either transfected with cathepsin B-RFP, or immunofluorescence for cathepsin B or cytochrome c was performed as described previously (22Werneburg N. Guicciardi M.E. Yin X.M. Gores G.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: G436-G443Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 28Guicciardi M.E. Bronk S.F. Werneburg N.W. Gores G.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2007; 292: G1337-G1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Cells were imaged by confocal microscope and scored as either displaying diffuse versus punctuate fluorescent pattern. Measurement of Lysosomal Permeabilization in Cell-free Systems—Highly purified lysosomes free of mitochondria were isolated from mouse liver as described (30Yamada H. Hayashi H. Natori Y. J. Biochem. 1984; 95: 1155-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). To examine lysosomal permeabilization by Bcl-2 family members, 20-μg aliquots of isolated lysosomes were treated with increasing concentrations (5-25 μm) of synthetic 25-mer peptides corresponding to the BH3 region of Bad, Bim, or Noxa (19Kuwana T. Bouchier-Hayes L. Chipuk J.E. Bonzon C. Sullivan B.A. Green D.R. Newmeyer D.D. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 525-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (997) Google Scholar) or with commercially available human truncated Bid (tBid, 25-50 ng/ml), in the presence or absence of mouse recombinant Bax (10 μg/ml), in a final volume of 50 μl of lysosomal buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.3 m sucrose). After incubation at 30 °C for 30 min, the reaction mixture was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C to pellet the lysosomes. A 20-μl aliquot of each supernatant was subjected to SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblot for cathepsin B (C-19, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and cathepsin D (C-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as described above. The pellet was also subjected to immunoblot analysis for cathepsin B. Clonogenic Assay—Cells were split at 100 cells per 35-mm dish in 1 ml of medium. 24 h later the cells were treated with TRAIL as indicated in the figure legend. After removal of TRAIL, cells were then allowed to grow until isolated colonies were visible (∼7 days). The colonies were then washed once with PBS, stained with Coomassie Blue, and counted. Materials—Reagents were obtained from the following suppliers: Recombinant human TRAIL from R&D Systems (Min-neapolis, MN); shRNA cat B plasmid and staurosporine from Sigma; the cathepsin B inhibitor CA-074, calpain inhibitor III and p38 inhibitor SB203580 from Calbiochem; R3032 from Celera Genomics (South San Francisco, CA); LEHD-fmk from Enzyme Systems (Livermore, CA); SP600125 and 3-O-methyl-sphingomyelin from BIOMOL (Plymouth Meeting, PA); z-IETD-fmk from MP Biomedicals (Aurora, OH); human recombinant tBid from Alexis Biochemicals (San Diego, CA); mouse recombinant Bax from ProteinX Lab (San Diego, CA); monoclonal mouse anti-Fas (CH11) from Upstate (Charlottesville, VA); and pepstatin from Chemicon. Plasmid encoding CrmA was a kind gift from Charles Young (Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN). Statistical Analysis—All data represent at least three independent experiments using cells from a minimum of three separate isolations and are expressed as mean ± S.E. Differences between groups were compared using two-tailed Student's t-tests. Involvement of Cathepsin B in TRAIL-induced Cytochrome c Release, Caspase 9 Activation, and Cell Death—The present studies were initially performed in cholangiocarcinoma cells, a human epithelial malignancy that has been previously used for examining TRAIL signaling and resistance (8Taniai M. Grambihler A. Higuchi H. Werneburg N. Bronk S.F. Farrugia D.J. Kaufmann S.H. Gores G.J. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 3517-3524Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 9Kobayashi S. Werneburg N.W.

Physiol. 2006; 290: G129-G136Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Because cholangiocarcinoma cells are relatively resistant to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis unless they are depleted of Mcl-1 (shMcl-1 KMCH cells) or abundantly express Bim (Mz-CHA-1 cells) (8Taniai M. Grambihler A. Higuchi H. Werneburg N. Bronk S.F. Farrugia D.J. Kaufmann S.H. Gores G.J. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 3517-3524Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), we have previously established a cholangiocarcinoma cell line with a knockdown of Mcl-1 by stable transfection with a shRNA targeting Mcl-1 (shMcl-1 KMCH cells) (8Taniai M. Grambihler A. Higuchi H. Werneburg N. Bronk S.F. Farrugia D.J. Kaufmann S.H. Gores G.J. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 3517-3524Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). When these were incubated with recombinant human TRAIL (5 ng/ml) for 4-5 h, morphological evidence of apoptosis was present in ≥60% of the shMcl-1 KMCH cells but was minimal in the parental KMCH cells (Fig. 1A). Examination of caspase-3/7 activity yielded similar results (Fig. 1B). In further experiments, cathepsin B localization was examined during the course of TRAIL-induced cell death (Fig. 1C). Under basal conditions, both cell lines displayed punctate fluorescence consistent with lysosomal localization of cathepsin B. However, after treatment with TRAIL, shMcl-1 KMCH cells showed diffuse fluorescence, suggesting a redistribution of cathepsin B from lysosomes to the cytosol (Fig. 1C). In contrast, parental KMCH cells continued to display punctate fluorescence after TRAIL treatment. To assess the importance of cathepsin B release, the effect of two cathepsin B inhibitors, CA-074 and R3032, as well as the cathepsin D inhibitor pepstatin and calpain inhibitor III on TRAIL-induced killing was examined. Inhibition of cathepsin B, but not cathepsin D nor calpain, significantly reduced TRAIL-induced apoptosis and effector caspase activity in shMcl-1 KMCH cells (Fig. 2A, caspase-3/7 data not shown). Furthermore, the cathepsin B inhibitors also prevented mitochondrial cytochrome c release (Fig. 2B). shRNA-targeted knockdown of cathepsin B also reduced TRAIL-mediated apoptosis as assessed morphologically and by quantitation of effector caspases-3/-7 activity (Fig. 2C, caspase-3/7 data not shown). We further confirmed the role of lysosomal permeabilization in TRAIL-mediated apoptosis using the lysosomal stabilizing agent 3-O-methyl sphingomyelin (32Caruso J.A. Mathieu P.A. Joiakim A. Zhang H. Reiners Jr., J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 10954-10967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This agent attenuated cathepsin B release as anticipated, and more, importantly reduced apoptosis (Fig. 3). Taken together, these data suggest lysosomal release of cathepsin B is upstream of mitochondria dysfunction during TRAIL-mediated apoptosis.FIGURE 33-O-Methylsphingomyelin a neutral sphingomyelinase inhibitor stabilized lysosomes and prevented TRAIL-induced cathepsin B release and cytotoxicity. shMcl-1 KMCH cells were pretreated with 3-O-methylsphingomyelin (3-0-MeSM, 50 μm for 90 min) then treated with TRAIL (5 ng/ml) or staurosporine (1 μg/ml).

LEHD-fmk did not attenuate cathepsin B release from lysosomes (Fig. 4A), although, as anticipated, it reduced the post-mitochondrial events of apoptosis, including the nuclear morphological features of apoptosis and caspase-3/7 activation (Fig. 4B, caspase-3/7 data not shown) as well as blocking TRAIL induced autocleavage of ca"
https://openalex.org/W2091409509,"Human expeditions to Mars will require adaptation to the 24.65-h Martian solar day-night cycle (sol), which is outside the range of entrainment of the human circadian pacemaker under lighting intensities to which astronauts are typically exposed. Failure to entrain the circadian time-keeping system to the desired rest-activity cycle disturbs sleep and impairs cognitive function. Furthermore, differences between the intrinsic circadian period and Earth's 24-h light-dark cycle underlie human circadian rhythm sleep disorders, such as advanced sleep phase disorder and non-24-hour sleep-wake disorders. Therefore, first, we tested whether exposure to a model-based lighting regimen would entrain the human circadian pacemaker at a normal phase angle to the 24.65-h Martian sol and to the 23.5-h day length often required of astronauts during short duration space exploration. Second, we tested here whether such prior entrainment to non-24-h light-dark cycles would lead to subsequent modification of the intrinsic period of the human circadian timing system. Here we show that exposure to moderately bright light (∼450 lux; ∼1.2 W/m2) for the second or first half of the scheduled wake episode is effective for entraining individuals to the 24.65-h Martian sol and a 23.5-h day length, respectively. Estimations of the circadian periods of plasma melatonin, plasma cortisol, and core body temperature rhythms collected under forced desynchrony protocols revealed that the intrinsic circadian period of the human circadian pacemaker was significantly longer following entrainment to the Martian sol as compared to following entrainment to the 23.5-h day. The latter finding of after-effects of entrainment reveals for the first time plasticity of the period of the human circadian timing system. Both findings have important implications for the treatment of circadian rhythm sleep disorders and human space exploration."
https://openalex.org/W2125007780,"N-glycosylation plays a key role in the quality of many therapeutic glycoprotein biologics. The biosynthesis reactions of these oligosaccharides are a type of network in which a relatively small number of enzymes give rise to a large number of N-glycans as the reaction intermediates and terminal products. Multiple glycans appear on the glycoprotein molecules and give rise to a heterogeneous product. Controlling the glycan distribution is critical to the quality control of the product. Understanding N-glycan biosynthesis and the etiology of microheterogeneity would provide physiological insights, and facilitate cellular engineering to enhance glycoprotein quality. We developed a mathematical model of glycan biosynthesis in the Golgi and analyzed the various reaction variables on the resulting glycan distribution. The Golgi model was modeled as four compartments in series. The mechanism of protein transport across the Golgi is still controversial. From the viewpoint of their holding time distribution characteristics, the two main hypothesized mechanisms, vesicular transport and Golgi maturation models, resemble four continuous mixing-tanks (4CSTR) and four plug-flow reactors (4PFR) in series, respectively. The two hypotheses were modeled accordingly and compared. The intrinsic reaction kinetics were first evaluated using a batch (or single PFR) reactor. A sufficient holding time is needed to produce terminally-processed glycans. Altering enzyme concentrations has a complex effect on the final glycan distribution, as the changes often affect many reaction steps in the network. Comparison of the glycan profiles predicted by the 4CSTR and 4PFR models points to the 4PFR system as more likely to be the true mechanism. To assess whether glycan heterogeneity can be eliminated in the biosynthesis of biotherapeutics the 4PFR model was further used to assess whether a homogeneous glycan profile can be created through metabolic engineering. We demonstrate by the spatial localization of enzymes to specific compartments all terminally processed N-glycans can be synthesized as homogeneous products with a sufficient holding time in the Golgi compartments. The model developed may serve as a guide to future engineering of glycoproteins."
https://openalex.org/W2107930325,"Temporally precise sequences of neuronal spikes that span hundreds of milliseconds are observed in many brain areas, including songbird premotor nucleus, cat visual cortex, and primary motor cortex. Synfire chains—networks in which groups of neurons are connected via excitatory synapses into a unidirectional chain—are thought to underlie the generation of such sequences. It is unknown, however, how synfire chains can form in local neural circuits, especially for long chains. Here, we show through computer simulation that long synfire chains can develop through spike-time dependent synaptic plasticity and axon remodeling—the pruning of prolific weak connections that follows the emergence of a finite number of strong connections. The formation process begins with a random network. A subset of neurons, called training neurons, intermittently receive superthreshold external input. Gradually, a synfire chain emerges through a recruiting process, in which neurons within the network connect to the tail of the chain started by the training neurons. The model is robust to varying parameters, as well as natural events like neuronal turnover and massive lesions. Our model suggests that long synfire chain can form during the development through self-organization, and axon remodeling, ubiquitous in developing neural circuits, is essential in the process."
https://openalex.org/W2034426081,"Human ABCG2 belongs to the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family and plays an important role in various biological reactions, such as xenobiotic elimination and homeostasis of protoporphyrin. We previously reported that ABCG2 exists in the plasma membrane as a homodimer bound via a disulfide bond at Cys-603. In the present study, we examined the importance of an intramolecular disulfide bond for stability of the ABCG2 protein. Substitution of either Cys-592 or Cys-608 located in the extracellular loop to glycine resulted in a significant decrease in protein levels of ABCG2 when expressed in Flp-In-293 cells. Interestingly, the protein levels of those ABCG2 variants were remarkably enhanced by treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG132. Concomitantly, increases in ubiquitinated forms of those variant proteins were detected by immunoprecipitation. In contrast, neither the protein level nor the ubiquitinated state of the ABCG2 wild-type (WT) was affected by MG132 treatment. Ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation is suggested to be involved in degradation of misfolded ABCG2 proteins lacking the intramolecular disulfide bond. On the other hand, the protein level of ABCG2 WT increased more than 4-fold when cells were treated with bafilomycin A1, which inhibits lysosomal degradation, whereas the C592G or C608G variant was little affected by the same treatment. These results strongly suggest that two distinct pathways exist for protein degradation of ABCG2 WT and mutants lacking the intramolecular disulfide bond. Namely, the WT ABCG2 is degraded in lysosomes, and the misfolded ABCG2 lacking intramolecular disulfide bond undergoes ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation in proteasomes.

Furthermore, a potential role of ABCG2 in the regulation of hematopoietic development is suggested (1Zhou S. Schuetz J.D. Bunting K.D. Colapietro A.M. Sampath J. Morris J.J. Lagutina I. Grosveld G.C. Osawa M. Nakauchi H. Sorrentino B.P. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1028-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (1971) Google Scholar). In fact, loss of the Abcg2 gene led to a reduction in the number of side population cells in the bone marrow and skeletal muscle (2Zhou S. Morris J.J. Barnes Y. Lan L. Schuetz J.D. Sorrentino B.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12339-12344Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Mice lacking Abcg2 displayed a previously unknown type of protoporphyria, where erythrocyte levels of protoporphyrin IX were increased 10-fold (3Jonker J.W. Buitelaar M. Wagenaar E. Valk Van Der Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15649-15654Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). We have recently provided direct evidence that human ABCG2 does transport porphyrins across the plasma membrane in an ATP-dependent manner, suggesting a physiological role of ABCG2 in intracellular porphyrin homeostasis (4Tamura A. Watanabe M. Saito H. Nakagawa H. Kamachi T. Okura I. Ishikawa T. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 70: 287-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 5Wakabayashi K. Tamura A. Saito H. Onishi Y. Ishikawa T. Drug Metab. Rev. 2006; 38: 371-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar).The ABCG2 gene is located on chromosome 4q22, spans over 66 kb, and consists of 16 exons ranging from 60 to 532 bp (6Bailey-Dell K.J. Hassel B. Doyle L.A. Ross D.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1520: 234-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). As compared with the molecular structures of the ABCB1 and ABCC1 transporters, ABCG2 is a so-called “half-transporter” bearing six transmembrane domains and one ATP-binding cassette. Thus, it has been suspected that ABCG2 functions as a homodimer (7Kage K. Tsukahara S. Sugiyama T. Asada S. Ishikawa E. Tsuruo T. Sugimoto Y. Int. J. Cancer. 2002; 97: 626-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 8Litman T. Jensen U. Hansen A. Covitz K.M. Zhan Z. Fetsch P. Abati A. Hansen P.R. Horn T. Skovsgaard T. Bates S.E. Biochim.

J. 2003; 373: 767-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). We previously demonstrated that human ABCG2 existed in the plasma membrane as a homodimer bound through disulfide-bonded cysteine residues. Treatment with mercaptoethanol reduced the apparent molecular weight of ABCG2 from 140,000 to 70,000 (9Mitomo H. Kato R. Ito A. Kasamatsu S. Ikegami Y. Kii I. Kudo A. Kobatake E. Sumino Y. Ishikawa T. Biochem. J. 2003; 373: 767-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Based on the cDNA sequence, a total of 12 cysteine residues exist in the ABCG2 protein (see Fig. 1). Although the cytosolic space is reductive due to the protection by antioxidants such as glutathione, the extracellular space is oxidative. Among those cysteine residues, Cys-592, Cys-603, and Cys-608 are predicted to reside in the extracellular loop between TM5 and TM6. Since 3 cysteine residues in the extracellular loop are conserved among the ABCG2 orthologues of the different species hitherto reported (10Wakabayashi K. Nakagawa H. Adachi T. Kii I. Kobatake E. Kudo A. Ishikawa T. J. Exp. Ther. Oncol. 2006; 5: 205-222PubMed Google Scholar), it was strongly suggested that these 3 cysteine residues play a critical role in inter- or intramolecular disulfide bond formation.Recently, our group and others independently provided direct evidence that Cys-603 is important for dimer formation of human ABCG2 (10Wakabayashi K. Nakagawa H. Adachi T. Kii I. Kobatake E. Kudo A. Ishikawa T. J. Exp. Ther. Oncol. 2006; 5: 205-222PubMed Google Scholar, 11Henriksen U. Fog J.U. Litman T. Gether U. J. Biol.

Cancer Sci. 2005; 96: 866-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the other 2 cysteine residues, i.e. Cys-592 and Cys-608, in the extracellular loop appear to be even more important for the protein stability as well as for the plasma membrane-targeting of the ABCG2 protein (10Wakabayashi K. Nakagawa H. Adachi T. Kii I. Kobatake E. Kudo A. Ishikawa T. J. Exp. Ther. Oncol. 2006; 5: 205-222PubMed Google Scholar, 11Henriksen U. Fog J.U. Litman T. Gether U. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 36926-36934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). When both Cys-592 and Cys-608 were substituted to Gly, the resulting C592G/C608G variant could form a homodimer, but its expression level was remarkably reduced. Furthermore, the C592G/C608G variant was mainly localized in intracellular compartments, and its plasma membrane localization was not detectable (10Wakabayashi K. Nakagawa H. Adachi T. Kii I. Kobatake E. Kudo A. Ishikawa T. J. Exp. Ther. Oncol. 2006; 5: 205-222PubMed Google Scholar). In this context, it is strongly suggested that the ABCG2 variant lacking the intramolecular disulfide bond is unstable, and its intracellular sorting to the plasma membrane domain is also impaired.In the present study, we investigated the biochemical importance of the intramolecular disulfide bond formation in the protein stability of ABCG2 by using Flp-In-293 cells in which one single copy of ABCG2 cDNA was incorporated into the designated site of genomic DNA. In this study, we demonstrate that the WT ABCG2 is degraded in lysosomes, whereas misfolded ABCG2 proteins lacking intramolecular disulfide bond undergo ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation in proteasomes. The present study is the first report providing evidence that there are two distinct pathways for protein degradation of ABCG2 WT and mutants lacking the intramolecular disulfide bond.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture-Flp-In-293 cells expressing ABCG2 WT or Cys-to-Gly variants (C592G and C608G) were established and cultured as described previously (10Wakabayashi K. Nakagawa H. Adachi T. Kii I. Kobatake E. Kudo A. Ishikawa T. J. Exp. Ther. Oncol. 2006; 5: 205-222PubMed Google Scholar).Immunoblot Analysis-ABCG2-expressing Flp-In-293 cells were placed onto 35-mm dishes and incubated under the above mentioned culture conditions for 24 h. After preincubation, cells were cultured in the presence or absence of compounds at different concentrations for designated incubation periods. After incubation, cells were harvested with their culture medium by centrifugation and washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Thereafter, the cells were treated with lysis buffer A containing 50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.4), 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitor mixture (Complete™, Mini, Nacalai Tesque, Inc., Kyoto Japan). The cell suspension sample was homogenized by passage through a 27-gauge needle and then centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant fraction (cell lysate) was subjected to immunoblotting as described previously (10Wakabayashi K. Nakagawa H. Adachi T. Kii I. Kobatake E. Kudo A. Ishikawa T. J. Exp. Ther. Oncol. 2006; 5: 205-222PubMed Google Scholar). To enzymatically remove N-linked glycans, when needed, the cell lysate was incubated with PNGase F (New England Biosciences, Ipswich, MA) at 37 °C for 10 min before the immunoblot analysis.Immunoprecipitation-Following cultivation in the presence or absence of 2 μm MG132 for 24 h, ABCG2-expressing Flp-In-293 cells were harvested by centrifugation and rinsed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Thereafter, the cells were treated with IP buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 10 μm MG132, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Complete™, Mini). The samples were homogenized by passage through a 27-gauge needle and then centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Equal amounts of the resulting cell lysate were incubated with preclearing matrix E (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) for 1 h at 4 °C with gentle shaking. After centrifugation (17,800 × g, 1 min), the resulting supernatant was used for immunoprecipitation as described below.The ABCG2 specific monoclonal antibody BXP-21 (Alexis Biochemicals, Lausen, Switzerland) or the anti-ubiquitin monoclonal antibody (Millipore Corp., Billerica, MA) was incubated with preclearing matrix E in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin at 4 °C for 1 h with gentle shaking to form the antibody-IP matrix complex. Thereafter, the resulting antibody-IP matrix complex and the preincubated cell lysates incubated were mixed and then further incubated at 4 °C overnight with gentle shaking. Immune complexes thus formed were washed with Tween-Tris-buffered saline, and the subsequently immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted with SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 2-mercaptoethanol. The resulting elution was subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis.Immunofluorescence Microscopy-ABCG2-expressing Flp-In-293 cells (2×104 cells) were placed on collagen type I-coated coverslips (Asahi Techno Glass Corp., Chiba, Japan) and incubated under the above mentioned culture conditions for 24 h. After preincubation, cells were cultured in the presence or absence of 2 μm MG132 for 24 h. Immunocytochemical staining was performed according to Ref. 13Tamura A. Wakabayashi K. Onishi Y. Takeda M. Ikegami Y. Sawada S. Tsuji M. Matsuda Y. Ishikawa T. Cancer Sci. 2007; 98: 231-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar.Profiling the Drug Resistance of ABCG2-expressing Flp-In-293 Cells-A growth inhibition (IC50) assay was performed by seeding Flp-In-293 cells at a density of 2000 cells/well in 96-well plates containing the culture medium. After 24 h, a test drug (SN-38) was added to the culture medium at different concentrations, and 2 μm MG132 was also added to the culture medium. The cells were then further incubated with the drug in a humidified tissue culture chamber (37 °C, 5% CO2) for 24 h. Surviving cells were detected by the bromo-3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazoyl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium assay described previously (10Wakabayashi K. Nakagawa H. Adachi T. Kii I. Kobatake E. Kudo A. Ishikawa T. J. Exp. Ther. Oncol. 2006; 5: 205-222PubMed Google Scholar).RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONProtein Expression Levels of ABCG2 WT, C592G, and C608G in Flp-In-293 Cells-We investigated the role of disulfide bond formation in the protein stability and cellular localization of ABCG2. For this purpose, the Flp-In method was used to integrate cDNA of ABCG2 variants into Flp recombination target-tagged genomic DNA. The expression of endogenous ABCG2 in Flp-In-293 cells was under detection levels in terms of its mRNA and protein, as described previously (10Wakabayashi K. Nakagawa H. Adachi T. Kii I. Kobatake E. Kudo A. Ishikawa T. J. Exp. Ther. Oncol. 2006; 5: 205-222PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we prepared two ABCG2 variants, C592G and C608G, in which Cys-592 and Cys-608 in the extracellular loop were substituted to Gly, respectively (Fig. 1A). Both fluorescence in situ hybridization mapping and multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis revealed that ABCG2 cDNA was incorporated into the telomeric region of the short arm on one of chromosomes 12 in Flp-In-293 cells (13Tamura A. Wakabayashi K. Onishi Y. Takeda M. Ikegami Y. Sawada S. Tsuji M. Matsuda Y. Ishikawa T. Cancer Sci. 2007; 98: 231-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Accordingly, as demonstrated in Fig. 1B, ABCG2 mRNA levels detected by reverse transcription-PCR were almost equal among ABCG2 WT, C592G, and C608G. However, substitution of either Cys-592 or Cys-608 to glycine resulted in a significant decrease in protein levels of ABCG2 in Flp-In-293 cells (Fig. 1B). Both C592G and C608G variants formed homodimers (data not shown; see Fig. 8 in Ref. 10Wakabayashi K. Nakagawa H. Adachi T. Kii I. Kobatake E. Kudo A. Ishikawa T. J. Exp. Ther. Oncol. 2006; 5: 205-222PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoblotting without PNGase F treatment revealed two faint bands for each of the C592G and C608G variants, and these bands corresponded to glycosylated (MW = 81,000) and non-glycosylated (MW = 63,000) forms (Fig. 1B). In the case of ABCG2 WT, on the other hand, its glycosylated form (MW = 81,000) appeared to be predominant. After PNGase F treatment, one single band (MW = 63,000) was detected not only for ABCG2 WT but also for the C592G and C608G variants (Fig. 1B). It is suggested that N-linked glycosylation was formed in the C592G and C608G variants as well as the WT in Flp-In-293 cells.Effect of MG132 or Bafilomycin A1 on the Protein Levels of ABCG2 WT, C592G, and C608G-As shown in Fig. 1C, the protein levels of those ABCG2 variants were remarkably enhanced by the treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG132. In contrast, the protein level of the ABCG2 WT was not significantly affected by MG132 treatment. The increases in protein levels of the ABCG2 C592G and C608G variants occurred in a time-dependent manner during the MG132 treatment. The treatment with MG132 for 48 h increased the protein level of those variants by 4–5-fold. Importantly, upon the immunoblot analysis with BXP-21 (Fig. 1C, upper panel), aggregated forms (indicated by II) of those variants were detected in the high molecular weight range of over 210,000. On the other hand, as depicted in Fig. 1D, the protein level of ABCG2 WT increased more than 5-fold when cells were treated with bafilomycin A1, which inhibits lysosomal degradation, whereas the C592G or C608G variants were little affected by the same treatment. No aggregated forms were detected in ABCG2 WT after the 24-h incubation with bafilomycin A1.Effect of MG132 on the Cellular Localization and Function of ABCG2 WT, C592G, and C608G-It was of great interest to know how the inhibition of proteasomal protein degradation by MG132 affects the cellular localization and functional activity of the ABCG2 C592G and C608G variants. Fig. 2A depicts the immunofluorescence images of Flp-In-293 cells expressing ABCG2 WT, C592G, or C608G that were incubated with or without 2 μm MG132 for 24 h. ABCG2 proteins were probed with the BXP-21 antibody and then labeled with green fluorescence dye (Alexa Fluor 488), whereas DNA in the nuclei was stained with propidium iodide (red fluorescence). Strong green fluorescence was observed at the plasma membrane and intracellular compartments in Flp-In-293 cells expressing ABCG2 WT, which was not affected by MG132 treatment. A remarkable difference was observed after the MG132 treatment, however, in terms of the cellular localization of the C592G or C608G variant proteins. Without MG132 treatment, immunofluorescence of the C592G or C608G variants was extremely weak at the plasma membrane of Flp-In-293 cells (Fig. 2A). Rather, those variant proteins were detected in intracellular compartments, suggesting that the sorting of C592G or C608G variants to the plasma membrane domain was impaired. It is noteworthy, however, that the plasma membrane localizations of the C592G and C608G variants were clearly detected after the MG132 treatment (Fig. 2A).FIGURE 2MG132 treatment affects expression and function of ABCG2 Cys-to-Gly variants but not WT. A, immunocytochemical staining of Flp-In-293 cells expressing ABCG2 WT, C592G, or C608G. Cells were incubated with or without 2 μm MG132 for 24 h. ABCG2 proteins were immunologically linked with Alexa Fluor 488 (green), and nuclei were stained by propidium iodide (red). Horizontal bars correspond to 20 μm. B, effect of MG132 on ubiquitination of ABCG2 proteins. After incubation with or without 2 μm MG132 for 24 h, cell lysate samples were prepared from Flp-In-293 cells expressing ABCG2 WT, C592G, or C608G. They were then immunoprecipitated with the ABCG2-specific monoclonal antibody (BXP-21) followed by immunoblotting with anti-ubiquitin monoclonalantibody (upper panel). On the other hand, the same cell lysate samples were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-ubiquitin monoclonal antibody, being followed by immunoblotting with the ABCG2-specific monoclonal antibody (BXP-21) (lower panel). C, drug resistance profiles of Flp-In-293 cells expressing ABCG2 WT, C592G, or C608G. Cells were incubated with SN-38 at different concentrations for 24 h in the presence or absence of 2 μm MG132. Cell viability was determined by bromo-3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazoyl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium assay. Data are expressed as mean values ± S.D. in multireplicated experiments (n = 8). Statistical significance (*, p < 0.01) was evaluated by Student's t test. D, schematic illustration for plausible pathways for protein processing and degradation of ABCG2 WT and Cys-to-Gly mutated variants (C592G and C608G). In the present study, we provide evidence that ABCG2 WT and the mutated variants undergo different degradation pathways. ABCG2 WT is degraded by the endosome-lysosome pathway after remaining in the plasma membrane domain for a certain period, whereas the mutated variants are regarded as misfolded proteins by putative check point system and readily undergo ubiquitination and protein degradation in proteasomes (described in details under “Results and Discussion”).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To investigate the effect of MG132 on the ubiquitinated state of ABCG2 proteins, the Flp-In-293 cells expressing ABCG2 WT, C592G, or C608G were incubated in the presence or absence of 2 μm MG132 for 24 h. As demonstrated in Fig. 2B, significant increases in the ubiquitinated forms of the C592G and C608G variant proteins were detected by immunoblotting with the anti-ubiquitin antibody after immunoprecipitation with the anti-ABCG2 antibody BXP-21 (upper panel). In contrast, the ubiquitinated state of the ABCG2 WT protein was little affected by the same MG132 treatment. Similar results were obtained by immunoblotting with BXP-21 after immunoprecipitation with the anti-ubiquitin antibody (lower panel).As shown Fig. 2C, the MG132 treatment also enhanced cellular resistance to SN-38 in Flp-In-293 cells expressing those variants, whereas little was changed in cells expressing ABCG2 WT even after the MG132 treatment. Based on these results, it is suggested that both C592G and C608G variants that were sorted to the plasma membrane domain after the MG132 treatment were functionally active to extrude SN-38 out of the cells.Role of Intramolecular Disulfide Bond Formation in Protein Stability-The present study provides evidence that intramolecular disulfide bond formation between Cys-592 and Cys-608 is critically important for stability of the ABCG2 protein. As schematically illustrated in Fig. 2D, this disulfide bond formation is regarded as a key “check point” step that determines the fate of de novo synthesized ABCG2 proteins, namely, either ubiquitination/proteasomal degradation or targeting to the plasma membrane and subsequential lysosomal degradation.Many proteins of the secretory pathway contain disulfide bonds that are essential for protein folding and function. In the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), rather than relying on small molecule antioxidants such as glutathione (14Molteni S.N. Fassio A. Ciriolo M.R. Filomeni G. Pasqualetto E. Fagioli C. Sitia R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 32667-32673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), it has recently been shown that the disulfide formation is driven by a protein relay involving endoplasmic reticulum oxidoreductase 1 (Ero1), a novel FAD-dependent enzyme, and protein disulfide isomerase (15Hwang C. Sinskey A.J. Lodish H.F. Science. 1992; 257: 1496-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1574) Google Scholar, 16Tu B.P. Weissman J.S. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 341-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar). It has not yet been elucidated whether these enzymes are actually involved in the formation of intra- and/or intermolecular disulfide bond in the ABCG2 protein. A significant amount of the ABCG2 protein was detected in intracellular compartments proximal to the nucleus (10Wakabayashi K. Nakagawa H. Adachi T. Kii I. Kobatake E. Kudo A. Ishikawa T. J. Exp. Ther. Oncol. 2006; 5: 205-222PubMed Google Scholar). In those compartments, de novo synthesized ABCG2 protein may undergo disulfide bond formation and glycosylation to become the mature protein.There are two main routes of protein clearance in eukaryotic cells, namely the ubiquitin-proteasome and endosome-lysosome pathways (Fig. 2D). In the present study, we provide evidence that these two distinct pathways play a pivotal role in the protein degradation of ABCG2 WT and mutants lacking the intramolecular disulfide bond. As demonstrated in Fig. 1, C and D, the WT ABCG2 is degraded by the endosome-lysosome pathway, whereas misfolded ABCG2 lacking intramolecular disulfide bond undergoes ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation in proteasomes.Protein Quality Control and Protein Degradation Pathways-The ER is the site where newly synthesized secretory and membrane proteins are folded and assembled under a stringent quality control system, named Check Point in Fig. 2D. Efficient quality control systems have evolved to prevent incompletely folded molecules from moving along the secretory pathway. Accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER would detrimentally affect cellular functions. Protein folding in the ER is associated with or facilitated by a number of molecular chaperones, including binding protein/GRP78, GRP94, and calreticulin, as well as by folding enzymes such as protein disulfide isomerase and peptidylprolyl cis-trans isomerase (17Ma Y. Hendershot L.M. J. Chem. Neuroanat. 2004; 28: 51-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 18Mori K. Cell. 2000; 101: 451-454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar, 19Schroder M. Kaufman R.J. Mutat. Res. 2005; 569: 29-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar). In response to the accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER, cells activate an intracellular signaling pathway from the ER to the nucleus known as the unfolded protein response, resulting in transcriptional up-regulation of ER-resident proteins as well as ER chaperones (20Breckenridge D.G. Germain M. Mathai J.P. Nguyen M. Shore G.C. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 8608-8618Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar, 21Rao R.V. Ellerby H.M. Bredesen D.E. Cell Death Differ. 2004; 11: 372-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar, 22Shen X. Zhang K. Kaufman R.J. J. Chem. Neuroanat. 2004; 28: 79-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 23Xu C. Bailly-Maitre B. Reed J.C. J. Clin. Investig. 2005; 115: 2656-2664Crossref PubMed Scopus (1867) Google Scholar).Misfolded proteins (e.g. ABCG2 C592G and C608G variants) may be removed from the ER by retrotranslocation to the cytosol and degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (24Muchowski P.J. Wacker J.L. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 6: 11-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar). This process is known as endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation. If these misfolded proteins are not degraded in proteasomes (e.g. MG132 inhibition), they are transported in a microtubule-organizing center together with ubiquitin and ER chaperones to form cytoplasmic aggregates called “aggresomes” (25Garcia-Mata R. Gao Y.S. Sztul E. Traffic. 2002; 3: 388-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). In fact, ABCG2 appeared to form aggresomes (Fig. 1C, indicated by II) when proteasomal degradation was inhibited by the MG132 treatment in Flp-In-293 cells (Fig. 1C). Aggresome formation was reported for misfolded CFTR proteins as well. Overexpression of CFTR or inhibition of proteasome activity in transfected mammalian cells led to the accumulation of stable, high molecular weight, detergent-insoluble, multiubiquitinated forms of CFTR (26Johnston J.A. Ward C.L. Kopito R.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1883-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (1764) Google Scholar).In addition, we anticipate that some part of ubiquitinated ABCG2 C592G and C608G variants can undergo deubiquitination and subsequently be sorted to the plasma membrane domain (Fig. 2D) since these variants were markedly localized at the plasma membrane domain after MG132 treatments (Fig. 2A). The deubiquitination may be catalyzed by ubiquitin-specific processing protease Y (UBPY)/USP8, a deubiquinating enzyme (27Mizuno E. Iura T. Mukai A. Yoshimori T. Kitamura N. Komada M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 5163-5174Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 28Mizuno E. Kobayashi K. Yamamoto A. Kitamura N. Komada M. Traffic. 2006; 7: 1017-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Recently, Mizuno et al. (27Mizuno E. Iura T. Mukai A. Yoshimori T. Kitamura N. Komada M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 5163-5174Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) reported that overexpression of UBPY/USP8 reduced the ubiquitination level of epidermal growth factor receptor and delayed its degradation by proteasomes in epidermal growth factor-stimulated cells. Therefore, the fate of ubiquitinated proteins seems to be dynamic, and multiple pathways may exist.

https://openalex.org/W1992259548,"The medium subunit of neurofilament (NF-M) is extensively modified by phosphate and O-linked beta-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc). Phosphorylation of NF-M plays a critical role in regulating its translocation, filament formation, and function. However, the regulation of NF-M phosphorylation and the role of NF-M O-GlcNAcylation (a modification by which GlcNAc is attached to the serine/threonine residues of a protein via an O-linked glycosidic bond) are largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that O-GlcNAcylation and phosphorylation of NF-M regulate each other reciprocally in cultured neuroblastoma cells and in metabolically active rat brain slices. In animal models of fasting rats, which mimicked the decreased glucose uptake/metabolism observed in brains of individuals with Alzheimer disease (AD), we found a decrease in O-GlcNAcylation and increase in phosphorylation of NF-M. We also observed decreased O-GlcNAcylation and an increased phosphorylation of NF-M in AD brain. These results suggest that O-GlcNAcylation and phosphorylation of NF-M are regulated reciprocally and that the hyperphosphorylation and accumulation of NF-M in AD brain might be caused by impaired brain glucose uptake/metabolism via down-regulation of NF-M O-GlcNAcylation."

Here, we identified nucleobindin 1 (NUCB1) as a novel repressor of the S1P-mediated ATF6 activation. NUCB1 is an ER stress-inducible gene with the promoter region having functional cis-elements for transcriptional activation by ATF6. Overexpression of NUCB1 inhibits S1P-mediated ATF6 cleavage without affecting ER-to-Golgi transport of ATF6, whereas knock-down of NUCB1 by siRNA accelerates ATF6 cleavage during ER stress. NUCB1 protein localizes in the Golgi apparatus, and disruption of the Golgi localization results in loss of the ATF6-inhibitiory activity. Consistent with these observations, NUCB1 can suppress physical interaction of S1P-ATF6 during ER stress. Together, our results demonstrate that NUCB1 is the first-identified, Golgi-localized negative feedback regulator in the ATF6-mediated branch of the UPR.

The ER functions are often affected by such stress conditions as nutrient starvation, decrease in folding efficiency, and overload of protein synthesis that lead to the accumulation of misfolded or unfolded proteins in the ER (1Schroder M. Kaufman R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 739-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (2417) Google Scholar). To cope with ER stress, cells activate a signal transduction pathway, which is called the unfolded protein response (UPR). The UPR consists of three major components: 1) transcriptional induction of ER-resident molecular chaperones and folding enzymes, such as glucose-regulated protein 78, 94 (GRP78, GRP94) and protein-disulfide isomerase (PDI), 2) translational attenuation to prevent further loading of proteins into the ER, and 3) ER-associated degradation (ERAD) to clear misfolded proteins. These adaptive responses are sensed and initiated by ER transmembrane proteins, ATF6, PKR-like ER kinase (PERK) and inositol-requiring 1 (IRE1) (1Schroder M. Kaufman R.J. Annu. Rev.

ATF6 is a bZIP transcription factor that plays a major role in UPR transcriptional induction via binding to the ER stress response elements (ERSE: CCAAT-N9-CCACG, ERSE-II: ATTGG-N-CCACG, UPRE: TGACGTGG/A) in the promoter of target genes (2Li M.

Cell. 2003; 4: 265-271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). During ER stress, ATF6 is activated by regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP), which is also known for its activation mechanism of sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) (7Brown M.S. Ye J. Rawson R.B. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 2000; 100: 391-398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1145) Google Scholar). RIP is defined as the process by which transmembrane proteins are cleaved to release cytosolic domains that function as the transcription factor (7Brown M.S. Ye J. Rawson R.B. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 2000; 100: 391-398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1145) Google Scholar). ATF6 is, in fact, a type-II ER transmembrane protein with the N-terminal domain facing the cytosol and its C terminus in the ER lumen, and the cytosolic N-terminal domain contains DNA-binding and a transcription-activating domain (8Haze K. Yoshida H. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3787-3799Crossref PubMed Scopus (1525) Google Scholar). Under normal conditions, ATF6 is kept inactive by binding with GRP78 in the ER lumen. When unfolded or misfolded proteins accumulate in the ER, GRP78 dissociates from ATF6 to repair these unfolded or misfolded proteins (9Shen J. Chen X. Hendershot L. Prywes R. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 99-111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar). Consequently, ATF6 is able to translocate from the ER to the Golgi apparatus. Then, it is converted to the active form (p50ATF6) via cleavage by site-1 protease (S1P) and subsequently by site-2 protease (S2P). The active p50ATF6 is released into the cytosol and translocates to the nucleus, resulting in transcriptional activation (10Chen X. Shen J. Prywes R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13045-13052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 11Ye J. Rawson R.B. Komuro R. Chen X. Dave U.P. Prywes R. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1355-1364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1345) Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that some ER stress-inducible genes are involved in regulation of the UPR. For example, GRP78 binds to the luminal domain of UPR sensor proteins, PERK and IRE1 in addition to ATF6 and keeps them inactive in the ER (9Shen J. Chen X. Hendershot L. Prywes R. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 99-111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar, 12Bertolotti A. Zhang Y. Hendershot L.M. Harding H.P. Ron D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 326-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (2080) Google Scholar). Also, p58ipk, a HSP40 family protein, binds to the kinase domain of PERK and is capable of attenuating PERK-mediated translational repression (13Yan W. Frank C.L. Korth M.J. Sopher B.L. Novoa I. Ron D. Katze M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15920-15925Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Likewise, GADD34, a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 1, functions as negative feedback loop of the PERK pathway by facilitating dephosphorylation of phospho-Ser51 on the translational initiation factor eIF2-α (14Novoa I. Zeng H. Harding H.P. Ron D. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1011-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar). During the late phase of the UPR, unspliced X-box-binding protein 1 (XBP1) is induced and forms a complex with active XBP1, a strong UPR transcription factor that is produced by IRE1-mediated unconventional splicing of XBP-1 mRNA (15Yoshida H. Matsui T. Yamamoto A. Okada T. Mori K. Cell. 2001; 107: 881-891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2935) Google Scholar). The complex formation leads to rapid degradation of both XBP-1 proteins (16Yoshida H. Oku M. Suzuki M. Mori K. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 565-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). These findings raise the possibility that there are some genes that have the ability to modulate the UPR among uncharacterized ER stress-inducible genes. Herein we focus on NUCB1, one of ER stress-inducible genes that we identified using a cDNA microarray system. NUCB1, also known as nucleobindin or calnuc, was first found as a secretory protein that possessed a signal sequence, a leucine zipper structure, two EF-hand motifs and a basic amino acidrich region (17Miura K. Titani K. Kurosawa Y. Kanai Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 187: 375-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 18Wendel M. Sommarin Y. Bergman T. Heinegard D. J. Biol.

Farquhar M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1515-1527Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Indeed, NUCB1 has been shown to be secreted in culture supernatant of a murine B cell line established from mice prone to the autoimmune disorder systemic lupus erythematosus (17Miura K. Titani K. Kurosawa Y. Kanai Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 187: 375-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 20Kanai Y. Tanuma S. Immunol. Lett. 1992; 32: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 21Lavoie C. Meerloo T. Lin P. Farquhar M.G. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 2462-2474Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Interestingly, further studies have also demonstrated that NUCB1 is expressed ubiquitously and localizes in the Golgi apparatus of intact cells (19Lin P. Le-Niculescu H. Hofmeister R. McCaffery J.M. Jin M. Hennemann H. McQuistan T. De Vries L. Farquhar M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1515-1527Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 22Miura K. Hirai M. Kanai Y. Kurosawa Y. Genomics. 1996; 34: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Although Golgi-localized NUCB1 has been suggested to be involved in Ca2+ homeostasis (23Lin P. Yao Y. Hofmeister R. Tsien R.Y. Farquhar M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 279-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), the function of NUCB1 is largely unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that Golgi-localized NUCB1 suppresses ATF6 activation by inhibiting S1P-mediated cleavage during ER stress. Chemicals and Antibodies—2-Deoxyglucose (Sigma) and DTT (Nacalai Tesque; Kyoto, Japan) were dissolved in distilled, sterilized water. Tunicamycin (Nacalai Tesque), thapsigargin (Wako Pure Chemical Industries; Osaka, Japan), and MG132 (Peptide Institute, Inc.; Osaka, Japan) were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide. These compounds were added to culture medium with the solvent being less than 0.5% of the volume of the culture medium. Rabbit polyclonal anti-NUCB1 antibody was raised against synthetic peptide corresponding to C-terminal CEKKLLERLPEVEVPQHL of the human NUCB1 protein. Rabbit polyclonal anti-ATF6 was prepared, as previously described (8Haze K. Yoshida H. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3787-3799Crossref PubMed Scopus (1525) Google Scholar). The following commercially available antibodies were used: mouse monoclonal anti-KDEL (StressGen; Victoria, BC, Canada), anti-calnexin, anti-ERp72 (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA), anti-golgin97 (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA), anti-FLAG M2, anti-β-actin (Sigma), and HRP- or FITC-conjugated anti-V5 (Invitrogen), HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit or mouse IgG (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences Corp, Piscataway, NJ). Cell Culture and Treatments—Cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (for HT1080) or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (for 293T and HeLa) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and 100 μg/ml of kanamycin and were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Glucose-free RPMI 1640 medium was obtained from Invitrogen and supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum for experimental use, as described (24Park H.R. Tomida A. Sato S. Tsukumo Y. Yun J. Yamori T. Hayakawa Y. Tsuruo T. Shin-ya K. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2004; 96: 1300-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). To induce UPR, cells underwent glucose deprivation for varying times. This was achieved by replacing the medium with the glucose-free medium, or chemical stressors 2DG, tunicamycin, thapsigardin, or DTT-containing medium (24Park H.R. Tomida A. Sato S. Tsukumo Y. Yun J. Yamori T. Hayakawa Y. Tsuruo T. Shin-ya K. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2004; 96: 1300-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). In some experiments, we treated cells with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 at 10 μm during exposure to the UPR inducers. cDNA Microarray Analysis—cDNA microarray analysis was performed as described previously (25Matsushima-Nishiu M. Unoki M. Ono K. Tsunoda T. Minaguchi T. Kuramoto H. Nishida M. Satoh T. Tanaka T. Nakamura Y. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 3741-3749PubMed Google Scholar, 26Rokudai S. Fujita N. Kitahara O. Nakamura Y. Tsuruo T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 8695-8708Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). RT-PCR Analysis—RT-PCR was performed as previously described (24Park H.R. Tomida A. Sato S. Tsukumo Y. Yun J. Yamori T. Hayakawa Y. Tsuruo T. Shin-ya K. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2004; 96: 1300-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Briefly, total RNA was isolated from cells using the RNeasy Mini Kit with DNase digestion (Qiagen, Tokyo, Japan) and converted to cDNA with SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). The cDNAs for NUCB1, GRP78, and G3PDH were then amplified by PCR with PfuTurbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene). PCR products were separated by electrophoresis on 1.2% agarose gels and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Immunoblot Analysis—Cells were lysed in 1× SDS sample buffer, and protein concentrations of the lysates were measured with a Bio-Rad protein assay kit. For analysis of secreted proteins, culture medium (serum-free) was concentrated with Microcon YM-30 (Millipore; Billerica, MA) and then boiled in 1× SDS buffer. Equal amounts of proteins were resolved on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred by electroblotting to a nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were probed with antibodies, as indicated, and the specific signals were detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences Corp) (24Park H.R. Tomida A. Sato S. Tsukumo Y. Yun J. Yamori T. Hayakawa Y. Tsuruo T. Shin-ya K. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2004; 96: 1300-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation—Cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and lysed in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA for NUCB1 or 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 0.5% (w/v) deoxycholic acid, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2 for S1P (27Espenshade P.J. Cheng D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22795-22804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) supplemented with a protease inhibitors mixture (Sigma). The lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and immunoprecipitated by anti-NUCB1 or anti-V5-conjugated beads (Sigma) in lysis buffer. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer and eluted by boiling in SDS sample buffer for immunoblot analysis. Immunofluorescence—Cells on a poly-lysine-coated coverslip were fixed and permeabilized for 10 min in PBS-containing 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.1% Triton X-100. After blocking for 1 h in PBS with 10% bovine serum albumin, the cells were incubated with primary (mouse anti-FLAG M2, 1:1000; rabbit anti-NUCB1, 1:3000; or mouse anti-golgin 97, 1:1000) and subsequent secondary antibodies (Alexa-fluor 488 conjugated anti-mouse Ig (1:1000), or Alexa-fluor 568-conjugated anti-rabbit Ig (1:1000); Invitrogen) in PBS with 1.5% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature. The coverslips were mounted on microscope slides and observed under a Nikon Diaphot 300 microscope at 400× magnification with appropriate filters to detect fluorescence. Plasmids—pcFLAG vector, pATF6wt, pATF6act, pXBP1sp, pGRP78pro160-Luc have been described previously (24Park H.R. Tomida A. Sato S. Tsukumo Y. Yun J. Yamori T. Hayakawa Y. Tsuruo T. Shin-ya K. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2004; 96: 1300-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The plasmid of 7× FLAG-tagged ATF6 was produced by tandem ligation of an oligonucleotide DNA sequence encoding 3× FLAG epitope to the HindIII site of pATF6wt. Expression vectors for non-tagged, V5-tagged and FLAG-tagged NUCB1 proteins were constructed by inserting each cDNA amplified by RT-PCR into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen), pcDNA3.1 TOPO V5/His (Invitrogen) and pFLAG-CMV-5c (Sigma), respectively. Expression vectors for IRE1 and S1P were constructed by inserting each cDNA amplified by RT-PCR (for IRE1) or by PCR using a KIAA0091 clone (kindly provided from Kazusa DNA Research Institute (28Nagase T. Miyajima N. Tanaka A. Sazuka T. Seki N. Sato S. Tabata S. Ishikawa K. Kawarabayasi Y. Kotani H. Nomura N. DNA Res. 1995; 2: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar)) as a template (for S1P) into the pcDNA3.1 TOPO V5/His vector (Invitrogen). Reporter plasmids containing a promoter region of NUCB1 were generated by ligating products amplified by PCR, using genomic DNA from HT1080 cells as a template, into pGL3-basic vector (Promega). Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out using a QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) for the NUCB1 mutant, P28A plasmid, which was exchanged Pro to Ala at position 28. The proper construction of plasmids was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Transfection—Transient transfections were performed using either FuGENE6 Transfection Reagent (Roche Applied Sciences, Indianapolis, IN) for HT1080 cells or Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) for 293T, according to each manufacturer's protocol. Reporter Assay—HT1080 cells (2 × 105 in each well of 12-well plates) were cultured overnight under normal growth conditions. After changing the medium to antibiotic-free RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, we incubated the cells for 6 h at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator with transfection mixtures containing the indicated amounts of NUCB1 plasmids and 375 ng of the firefly luciferase-containing reporter plasmids pGRP78pro160-Luc with 125 ng of plasmid pRL-TK (Promega) (in which Renilla luciferase expression is under the control of the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter) as an internal control. The medium was then replaced with fresh medium lacking plasmids, and the cells were incubated under the same conditions for another 6 h. The cells were then treated for 12 h with UPR inducers. Relative firefly-to-Renilla luciferase activity (means with S.D. values of triplicate determinations) was determined using the dual luciferase kit (Promega). For NUCB1 promoter analysis, HT1080 cells (1 × 105 in each well of 24-well plates) were transiently transfected with 500 ng of pNUCB1-Luc (firefly) plasmids, which contained different lengths (–584 to +112, –184 to +16, –134 to +16, –24 to +112) or point mutants of the NUCB1 promoter region (see Fig. 2) together with 1 ng of pRL-hCMV plasmid (Renilla) (Promega) as an internal control and then assayed as described above. RNA Interference—Double-stranded RNA duplexes corresponding to human NUCB1 (1: 5′-AAGAGTTCAAGCGCTACGAGA-3′ and 2: 5′-CTCAGTGATCGGCTTAACTTA-3′), as well as Control siRNA were purchased from Qiagen. For transient transfection of siRNA, cells were seeded at a density of 0.5 × 105/well in a 12-well plate and were cultured overnight. The cells were transfected for 6 h with siRNA (80 nm), using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol. Two days after transfection, the cells were used for experimentation. Sialidase Treatment—NUCB1 proteins prepared from cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-NUCB1. After elution using synthetic peptide, each sample was digested with sialidase II (Clostridium perfringens) at 37 °C for 3 h. NUCB1, an ER Stress-responsive Gene—We conducted a microarray analysis of gene expression to identify novel genes induced by glucose starvation, one of the physiological ER stress conditions. For this purpose, we used mRNAs from human ovarian cancer A2780 and colon cancer HT29 cells that had been cultured for 18 h under normal or glucose starvation conditions. As a result, NUCB1 was identified as a glucose starvation-inducible gene. To validate the finding, we analyzed mRNA expression of NUCB1 by RT-PCR in human fibrosarcoma HT1080 cells (Fig. 1A). Enhanced NUCB1 expression, as well as GRP78 expression, was seen in cells starved of glucose for 18 h. NUCB1 was also induced by treatment with 2-deoxyglucose (2DG) and tunicamycin, representative chemical ER stressors. Immunoblot analysis revealed that NUCB1 protein was also up-regulated by glucose withdrawal or 2DG treatment in HT1080 and HeLa cells (Fig. 1B). As previously reported (19Lin P. Le-Niculescu H. Hofmeister R. McCaffery J.M. Jin M. Hennemann H. McQuistan T. De Vries L. Farquhar M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1515-1527Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), immunostaining demonstrated that NUCB1 localized at the Golgi apparatus (see Fig. 5C). However, NUCB1 was also reported as a secretory protein in mouse pituitary AtT20 and normal rat kidney cells (21Lavoie C. Meerloo T. Lin P. Farquhar M.G. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 2462-2474Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). To verify secretion of NUCB1, we cultured HT1080 cells in serum-free medium in the presence of 2DG or tunicamycin and then recovered the culture medium for immunoblot analysis. NUCB1 was detected in the culture medium under both normal and stress conditions, and the secretion was increased by the chemical stressors within 3 h (Fig. 1C). At that time point, GRP78 induction was marginal, suggesting that the increased NUCB1 secretion occurred at a relatively early phase of the UPR. These results indicate that NUCB1 can be Golgi-resident inside the cells and can be secreted outside the cells. NUCB1 has been shown to be modified with sialylated O-linked oligosaccharides (21Lavoie C. Meerloo T. Lin P. Farquhar M.G. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 2462-2474Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). To determine sialylated status of NUCB1, we immunopurified NUCB1 proteins and digested them with sialidase (Fig. 1D). The sialidase treatment resulted in an approximate 1–2-kDa shift in extracellular pool mobility of NUCB1 proteins, indicating that secreted NUCB1 proteins were indeed sialylated. A similar mobility shift was seen in intracellular pools of NUCB1 proteins in both unstressed and 2DG-stressed cells, which had been detected as two bands and resulted in the disappearance of the upper band (Fig. 1D). Together, these results suggested that sialylation might be an essential modification for secretion of NUCB1. ER Stress-responsive Elements in NUCB1 Promoter—We cloned an approximate 700-bp putative promoter region of the human NUCB1 gene, including the transcriptional initiation site (–584 to +112), into a luciferase reporter vector (pNUCB1-Luc). The pNUCB1-Luc or the SV40 promoter-driven pGL3 (control) was transfected into HT1080 cells. Treating the cells with tunicamycin for 18 h led to activation of the NUCB1 promoter, but not the SV40 promoter, in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2A). We also found that co-transfection of pATF6act or pXBP1sp, the active forms of UPR transcription factors ATF6 and XBP1, respectively (8Haze K. Yoshida H. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3787-3799Crossref PubMed Scopus (1525) Google Scholar, 15Yoshida H. Matsui T. Yamamoto A. Okada T. Mori K. Cell. 2001; 107: 881-891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2935) Google Scholar), resulted in a strong activation of NUCB1 promoter activity (Fig. 2A). Examination of the NUCB1 promoter region revealed one ERSE II (–124∼–114, inverted) and one unfolded protein response element (UPRE)-like sequence (–152∼–144) as potential ER stress-responsive cis-elements (Fig. 2B). We tested the role of the regions in promoter activity using pNUCB1-Luc1 (–184∼+16), a deletion version of pNUCB1-Luc that still contains both the UPRE-like and the ERSE II regions. The pNUCB1-Luc1 was strongly activated by tunicamycin treatment (18 h) and by co-transfection with pATF6act or pXBP1sp (Fig. 2C). Deletion of the UPRE-like region (pNUCB1-Luc2: –134∼+16) decreased the promoter activation without affecting the basal promoter activity under normal conditions. Further bulky deletion (pNUCB1-Luc3: –24∼+112) led to promoter activation loss and remarkable decrease in the basal promoter activity. Consistently, each mutation of UPRE-like (Mut1) and ERSE II (Mut2 and 3) in pNUCB1-Luc1 decreased promoter activation by tunicamycin treatment and by pATF6act or pXBP1sp co-transfection (Fig. 2D). Some variations were seen in the inhibitory effect of each mutation, depending on the promoter activation conditions. Combined mutation of both elements resulted in further promoter activation decrease. Interestingly, the point mutations had a marginal effect on the basal promoter activity. These results demonstrated that both ERSE II and UPRE-like regions mediate NUCB1 promoter activation during ER stress. NUCB1 Represses UPR with Inhibiting ATF6 Activation—To examine the role of NUCB1 in the UPR, we used pGRP78-Luc, which contained a GRP78 promoter region (–160∼+7) immediately upstream of the firefly luciferase. As previously reported (3Yoshida H. Haze K. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33741-33749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar), the GRP78 promoter reporter was activated by treating the transfected cells with 2DG or tunicamycin in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3A). We found that co-transfection of NUCB1 significantly attenuated the GRP78 promoter activity induced by each stressor (Fig. 3A). Consistently, immunoblot analysis of lysates from 293T cells revealed that NUCB1 overexpression significantly attenuated induction of endogenous UPR target proteins under stress conditions (Fig. 3B). GRP78 promoter activity was also enhanced in proportion to the transfected amount of pATF6wt (Fig. 4A, left). Under the experimental conditions, the ATF6wt-induced GRP78 promoter activation was decreased remarkably by co-transfection of NUCB1. In contrast, NUCB1 had little effect on the promoter activity induced by the active form of ATF6 (Fig. 4A, middle). As to the IRE1-XBP1 pathway, NUCB1 did not affect IRE1- or XBP1sp-mediated activation of the GRP78 promoter (Fig. 4A, right). We next examined the effects of NUCB1 on the activation process of ATF6. For this purpose, we used a construct of 7× FLAG-tagged ATF6 to increase the detection sensitivity to the small amount of ATF6 because extremely overexpressed ATF6 can be readily activated by proteolytic cleavage independently of ER stress (11Ye J. Rawson R.B. Komuro R. Chen X. Dave U.P. Prywes R. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1355-1364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1345) Google Scholar). When the plasmid of 7× FLAG-tagged ATF6 was transfected into HT1080 cells, the ATF6 activation process was detected in an ER stress-dependent manner (Fig. 4B). Indeed, in addition to p90ATF6, an intermediate product (S1P cleavage product) and p50ATF6/active form (sequential S2P cleavage product) emerged after thapsigargin treatment. We found that the production of processed ATF6 was decreased by co-transfection of NUCB1 (Fig. 4B, left). Conversely, siRNA-mediated NUCB1 knockdown enhanced the processed form production during tunicamycin or thapsigargin treatment (Fig. 4B, right). We also examined the effects of NUCB1 overexpression on endogenous ATF6 processing (Fig. 4C, left). When 293T cells were treated with tunicamycin for 8–12 h, p50ATF6 as well as the underglycosylated form of p90ATF6 were produced. The production of p50ATF6 was attenuated by overexpression of NUCB1. In agreement with this finding, silencing of NUCB1 in HT1080 cells enhanced the production of endogenous p50ATF6 during tunicamycin treatment for 8 h or 12 h, as compared with non-silencing cells (Fig. 4C, right and supplemental Fig. S5). These results indicate that NUCB1 can negatively regulate ATF6 processing for its activation during ER stress. NUCB1 Represses ATF6 Activation in the Golgi Apparatus—We examined whether or not NUCB1 overexpression influenced the subcellular localization of ATF6 (7× FLAG tag) (Fig. 5A). At 20 min after DTT addition, ATF6 was concentrated in Golgi-like structures either with or without NUCB1 overexpression (Fig. 5A, arrow). At 40 min, some populations of the cells transfected with pATF6 alone took up nucleus staining (Fig. 5A, arrowhead) while cells co-transfected with ATF6 and NUCB1 remained Golgi staining (Fig. 5A, arrow), indicating that the nucleus translocation of ATF6 was repressed by NUCB1 at the Golgi apparatus. Quantifying more than 100 transfected cells after 30 min of DTT treatment revealed that the nuclear translocation of ATF6 was decreased by half when NUCB1 was co-expressed (Fig. 5B). In contrast, the NUCB1 co-expression had no effect on ATF6 translocation from the ER to the Golgi apparatus (Fig. 5B). We have screened several NUCB1 mutants at the N terminus and found that P28A mutant localized in the ER (Fig. 5C). Although the mechanism of ER localization of this mutant is not known at present, we used it to confirm the finding that NUCB1 suppresses ATF6 processing in the Golgi apparatus. We compared the effects of P28A and WT on ATF6 processing. HT1080 cells were co-transfected with pATF6wt (7× FLAG-tag) and WT or P28A and then treated with thapsigargin (Fig. 5D). We found that P28A was scarcely able to repress thapsigargin-induced ATF6 processing (Fig. 5D). Consistently, P28A did not suppress nuclear translocation of ATF6, while, for unknown reasons, P28A stimulated it (Fig. 5E). Together, the Golgi localization of NUCB1 is likely required for inhibition of ATF6 processing. Impairment of Interaction between ATF6 and S1P by NUCB1—We found that interaction between ATF6 and S1P was detected during ER stress by a co-immunoprecipitation assay. Indeed, co-transfection of pS1P (V5 tag) and pATF6wt (7× FLAG tag) made it possible to detect the interaction between ATF6 and S1P under conditions of 2DG, tunicamycin, and thapsigargin (Fig. 6A). We then examined the effects of NUCB1 on the stress-induced interaction between ATF6 and S1P. As shown in Fig. 6B, thapsigargin-induced interaction between ATF6 and S1P was clearly diminished by NUCB1 overexpression. At the same time, NUCB1 overexpression inhibited production of the active form of ATF6. Thus, NUCB1 prevented the interaction between ATF6 and S1P leading to ATF6 cleavage during ER stress. In agreement with these findings, we also found that overexpression of S1P dose-dependently suppressed the inhibitory activity of NUCB1 against ATF6-mediated GRP78 promoter activation (Fig. 6C). Together, these results support the notion that the interaction between ATF6 and S1P is an important target for inhibition of ATF6 activation by NUCB1. The ATF6 activation system must contain a negative feedback regulation mechanism because ATF6 processing was temporarily increased and then gradually attenuated during ER stress (3Yoshida H. Haze K. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33741-33749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar, 29Okada T. Haze K. Nadanaka S. Yoshida H. Seidah N.G. Hirano Y. Sato R. Negishi M. Mori K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31024-31032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). However, regulatory proteins for the process are largely unknown. We present evidence that NUCB1 can function as an ER stress-responsive negative regulator of ATF6 activation. Indeed, both mRNA and protein of NUCB1 are induced during ER stress. The promoter region of the NUCB1 gene contains ERSE II and UPRE-like regions, which can be functional as cis-elements for transcriptional activation by ATF6 and by UPR-inducing stressors. NUCB1 protein localizes in the Golgi apparatus, the intracellular site where ATF6 is cleaved by S1P/S2P for nuclear translocation. In agreement with intracellular localization, NUCB1 suppresses physical interaction of S1P-ATF6 and subsequent S1P-mediated cleavage of ATF6 during ER stress. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that NUCB1 can be involved in a negative feedback loop of the ATF6-mediated branch of the UPR. We showed herein that ATF6 activation is suppressed by overexpression of NUCB1, whereas it is enhanced by knock-down of NUCB1. Thus, the increased expression of NUCB1 during ER stress can be an important mechanism to suppress ATF6 activation. As observed for NUCB1, certain UPR-inducible genes have also been reported to exhibit UPR-modulating activity (9Shen J. Chen X. Hendershot L. Prywes R. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 99-111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar, 13Yan W. Frank C.L. Korth M.J. Sopher B.L. Novoa I. Ron D. Katze M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1011-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar, 16Yoshida H. Oku M. Suzuki M. Mori K. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 565-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). As to ATF6 regulation, GRP78, a major UPR target chaper-one protein, has been shown to down-regulate the ATF6 activation process by preventing transport of newly synthesized ATF6 from the ER to the Golgi apparatus (9Shen J. Chen X. Hendershot L. Prywes R. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 99-111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar). Thus, the ATF6 activation process can be regulated by GPR78 in the ER and by NUCB1 in the Golgi. In addition to expression levels, subcellular localization of NUCB1 may contribute to ATF6 regulation during ER stress. Indeed, we observed a tendency that increased secretion of NUCB1 occurred sooner than increased intracellular expression of NUCB1 during ER stress (Fig. 1C). As secreted NUCB1 is incapable of preventing ATF6 activation in the Golgi apparatus, increased secretion of NUCB1, seen at the early phase of the UPR, may play a role in facilitating the ATF6 activation process by weakening the NUCB1-mediated negative regulation. On the other hand, at the UPR late phase, the ATF6 activation process may be fine-tuned through the increased intracellular expression levels of NUCB1 together with GRP78. While previous studies demonstrated that extracellular NUCB1 can stimulate B cell growth (20Kanai Y. Tanuma S. Immunol. Lett. 1992; 32: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), we observed no effect of silencing NUCB1 on HT1080 fibrosarcoma cell growth (data not shown), which suggests that the growth-promoting activity of NUCB1 may be cell type-dependent. Alternatively, the secreted form may contribute to modulating the stressed cell microenvironment. Actually, extracellular NUCB1 has been suggested to serve as a modulator of matrix maturation in bone, based on the observations that NUCB1 is secreted by osteoblasts and osteocytes and can indeed be detected in the osteoid extracellular matrix (18Wendel M. Sommarin Y. Bergman T. Heinegard D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6125-6133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 30Petersson U. Somogyi E. Reinholt F.P. Karlsson T. Sugars R.V. Wendel M. Bone. 2004; 34: 949-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Thus, NUCB1 secretion might have a role not only in facilitating ATF6 activation inside stressed cells but also in modulating stressful microenvironment outside the cells. We showed that as an inhibition mechanism of ATF6 activation, NUCB1 prevented S1P-ATF6 interaction during ER stress. However, we were unable to detect a binding between NUCB1 and either ATF6 or S1P under the same experimental conditions that the S1P-ATF6 interaction was easily seen. This may have been the result of technical problems because we could detect an interaction between NUCB1 and ATF6 when both proteins were extremely overexpressed by transfection (data not shown). Thus, a complex between NUCB1 and ATF6 or S1P may be too sensitive to detergents or too transient to be detected under our experimental conditions. We speculate that NUCB1 requires cooperating protein(s) to bind to ATF6 or S1P and to prevent S1P-ATF6 interaction. In other words, the S1P-ATF6 interaction during ER stress may be an event regulated by several factors containing NUCB1 but not be a mere consequence of ATF6 translocation from ER to the Golgi apparatus. In this context, it may be worth noting that NUCB1 has been reported to be able to interact physically with other proteins, such as cyclooxygenase I and a G protein, Giα3 (31Ballif B.A. Mincek N.V. Barratt J.T. Wilson M.L. Simmons D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5544-5549Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 32Lin P. Fischer T. Weiss T. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 674-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). It would be interesting to examine whether such proteins are involved in regulation of the UPR, especially the ATF6-mediated branch. In conclusion, our studies identified NUCB1 as a novel UPR negative regulatory protein that suppresses the S1P-mediated cleavage activation of ATF6 in the Golgi apparatus. In addition to ATF6, there are several members of ER-anchored transcriptional factors that are structurally similar to ATF6 (33Sakai J. Duncan E.A. Rawson R.B. Hua X. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1996; 85: 1037-1046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar, 34Kondo S. Murakami T. Tatsumi K. Ogata M. Kanemoto S. Otori K. Iseki K. Wanaka A. Imaizumi K. Nat.

Cell. 2006; 124: 587-599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). These members, including SREBP2, OASIS and CREBH, all have been shown to be activated by S1P/S2P-mediated cleavage, the so-called, RIP. However, it is unlikely that RIP is generally regulated by NUCB1 because overexpression or siRNA-mediated knockdown of NUCB1 had little effect on SREBP2 processing (data not shown). Thus, these findings provide a clue to elucidating regulation mechanisms of RIP for each transcriptional factor at the Golgi apparatus. Besides, the finding of enhanced NUCB1 secretion during ER stress may also be intriguing, as increased NUCB1 secretion has reportedly been associated with induction or enhancement of autoimmunity in murine models of lupus (20Kanai Y. Tanuma S. Immunol. Lett. 1992; 32: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Thus, our findings could offer information for studying the relationship between the UPR and autoimmune response, as well as other UPR-associated patho-physiological states, such as tumor development, neurodegenerative disorders, and diabetes.

https://openalex.org/W2071052812,"Background Cardiovascular disease is the most common cause of mortality among post-menopausal women. Our objective was to determine whether or not lateral spine images obtained on a bone densitometer to detect prevalent vertebral fracture can also accurately detect radiographic abdominal aortic calcification (AAC), an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease independent of clinical risk factors. Methodology/Principal Findings One hundred seventy four postmenopausal women had bone densitometry, lateral spine densitometry imaging (called vertebral fracture assessment, or VFA), and lateral spine digital radiographs. Radiographs and VFA images were scored for AAC using a previously validated 24 point scale and a simplified, new 8 point scale (AAC-8). One hundred fifty six (90%) of the VFA images were evaluable for AAC. The non-parametric intraclass correlation coefficient between VFA and radiographic 24 point and AAC-8 readings, respectively, were 0.80 (95% C.I. 0.68–0.87) and 0.76 (95% C.I. 0.65–0.84). Areas under receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves for VFA to detect those with a radiographic 24-point AAC score ≥5 were 0.86 (95% C.I. 0.77–0.94) using the 24 point scale and 0.84 (95% C.I. 0.76–0.92) using the AAC-8 scale. Conclusion/Significance VFA imaging intended to detect prevalent vertebral fracture can also detect radiographic AAC, an important cardiovascular disease risk factor. Since bone densitometry is recommended for all women age 65 and older, VFA imaging at the time of bone densitometry offers an opportunity to assess this risk factor in the post-menopausal female population at very little incremental time and expense."
https://openalex.org/W2094436173,"There are four genes for acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) in the genome of mammalian species. Whereas ASIC1 to ASIC3 form functional H+-gated Na+ channels, ASIC4 is not gated by H+, and its function is unknown. Zebrafish has two ASIC4 paralogs: zASIC4.1 and zASIC4.2. Whereas zASIC4.1 is gated by extracellular H+, zASIC4.2 is not. This differential response to H+ makes zASIC4 paralogs a good model to study the properties of this ion channel. In this study, we found that surface expression of homomeric zASIC4.2 is higher than that of zASIC4.1. Surface expression of zASIC4.1 was much increased by formation of heteromeric channels, suggesting that zASIC4.1 contributes to heteromeric ASICs in zebrafish neurons. Robust surface expression of H+-insensitive zASIC4.2 suggests that zASIC4.2 functions as a homomer and is gated by an as yet unknown stimulus, different from H+. Moreover, we identified a small region just distal to the first transmembrane domain that is crucial for the differential H+ response of the two paralogs. This post-TM1 domain may have a general role in gating of members of this gene family."

The mechanism for Rem-mediated channel inhibition remains controversial, although it has been proposed that CaVβ association is required. Previous work has shown that a C-terminal truncation of Rem (Rem-(1–265)) displays reduced in vivo binding to membrane-localized β2a and lacks channel regulatory function. In this paper, we describe a role for the Rem C terminus in plasma membrane localization through association with phosphatidylinositol lipids. Moreover, Rem-(1–265) can associate with β2a in vitro and β1b in vivo, suggesting that the C terminus does not directly participate in CaVβ association. Despite demonstrated β1b binding, Rem-(1–265) was not capable of regulating a CaV1.2-β1b channel complex, indicating that β subunit binding is not sufficient for channel regulation. However, fusion of the CAAX domain from K-Ras4B or H-Ras to the Rem-(1–265) C terminus restored membrane localization and Ca2+ channel regulation, suggesting that β binding and membrane localization are independent events required for channel inhibition.

High voltage-activated Ca2+ channels (CaV1 and CaV2 families) transduce electrical activity into increased intracellular calcium that mediates a diverse array of essential cellular processes, including hormone secretion, neurotransmitter release, and excitation-contraction coupling in muscle systems (1Catterall W.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 521-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (1952) Google Scholar). The cardiac L-type Ca2+ channel is a multiprotein complex consisting of the pore-forming CaV1.2 α subunit and auxiliary subunits, including CaVβ and α2-δ subunits (1Catterall W.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 521-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (1952) Google Scholar). The CaVα subunit determines the ion selectivity and single channel conductance of the mature channel, whereas co-expression of CaVβ or α2δ facilitates cell surface trafficking of the α1 subunit, increases Ca2+ current amplitude, and alters channel gating properties (1Catterall W.A.

Mutations that prevent 14-3-3 and CaM binding in Rad result in the redistribution of Rad and CaVβ3 to the nucleus (14Beguin P. Mahalakshmi R.N. Nagashima K. Cher D.H. Ikeda H. Yamada Y. Seino Y. Hunziker W. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 355: 34-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). A corresponding loss of Rad-mediated Ca2+ channel regulation for these mutants has led to the suggestion that RGK-mediated channel inhibition involves nuclear targeting of CaVβ subunits (14Beguin P. Mahalakshmi R.N. Nagashima K. Cher D.H. Ikeda H. Yamada Y. Seino Y. Hunziker W. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 355: 34-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Thus, although it is clear that the conserved RGK C terminus plays a role in channel regulation, the exact mechanism of action remains to be determined. Here, we analyze the contribution of the Rem C terminus to Ca2+ channel regulation. We find that Rem is trafficked to the plasma membrane and associates with phosphatidylinositol lipids and that truncation of the C terminus results in redistribution to the cytosol, accompanied by a loss of calmodulin binding and Ca2+ channel inhibition. These truncation mutants display a reduction in CaVβ2a but not CaVβ1b association in vivo, and loss of the C terminus does not affect in vitro β2a subunit binding, indicating that β subunit interaction does not require the Rem C terminus. In addition, the Rem-(1–265) truncation mutant that binds CaVβ1b does not inhibit current expression from the heterologously expressed CaV1.2-CaVβ1b channel, indicating that Rem does not inhibit channel function solely through β subunit sequestration. Anchoring of Rem-(1–265) to the plasma membrane using the CAAX motif from H-Ras or K-Ras4B restores Ca2+ channel inhibition, suggesting that plasma membrane localization is critical for Rem-mediated Ca2+ channel regulation. Plasmids—Mammalian expression vectors for CaV1.2 α subunit, FLAG epitope-tagged β2a subunit, FLAG epitope-tagged β1b subunit, and HA epitope-tagged Rem have been described previously (9Finlin B.S.

Rem truncation mutants were generated by PCR using HA-tagged Rem as the template and fully sequenced. RFP-Rem-(266–297) was generated by PCR and inserted behind RFP in pDsRed vector (Clontech). Chimeric Rem proteins were generated by ligation of oligonucleotides corresponding to the C terminus of human K-Ras4B (residues 171–188) or mouse H-Ras (residues 171–189) to the C terminus of pcDNA3.1 + zeo 3×HA-Rem-(1–265) utilizing XbaI/ApaI sites. Confocal Imaging—Confocal imaging of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged Rem truncations, chimeric Rem proteins, RFP-Rem-(266–297) and RemWT was performed as previously described (18Crump S.M.

Images displayed are representative of the cells observed. Quantification was performed using Leica LCS software. Plasma membrane localization was quantified by four line scan intensity measurements through each cell beginning in the central cytoplasm, avoiding the nucleus, and ending at the cell periphery. GFP intensity at the cell periphery in each scan was divided by the mean intensity over the entirety of the scanned line to monitor GFP cell periphery intensity over that of the GFP-tagged protein in the cytosol. Line scans were averaged for each cell, and the mean values of the averaged cell measurements are reported as mean ± S.E. Significance was determined using Student's t test with a p value of <0.05. To examine the localization of GFP-Rem-(1–276) at the cell periphery, a double-blind study was performed. From the line scan analysis above, 32 cells expressing Rem-(1–276) and 33 cells expressing Rem-(1–265) were randomized and examined by three individuals, who were asked to score each cell for the presence of increased punctate GFP fluorescence at the cell periphery. Scored cells were then matched to their appropriate treatment, and the percentage of cells from each treatment displaying localized increases of GFP fluorescence at the cell boundary was determined. Values are reported as mean ± S.D., and significance was determined using Student's t test with a p value of <0.05. PIP Binding Assay—3× FLAG-tagged Rem truncations or empty 3× FLAG vector was expressed in tsA201 cells using the calcium phosphate transfection method as described previously (21Andres D.A.

PIP strips (Molecular Probes) were blocked in TBS-T + 3% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin for 1 h and incubated with total cell lysate from the appropriate treatment in TBS-T + 3% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin at 4 °C overnight with gentle rocking. Membranes were then washed with TBS-T supplemented with 3% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin and probed with biotinylated FLAG antibody and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin.

Calmodulin-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) were washed twice with immunoprecipitation buffer and incubated with 1 mg of total lysate in the presence of 2 mm CaCl2 or 2.5 mm EGTA. Beads were washed three times in immunoprecipitation buffer containing 2 mm CaCl2 or 2.5 mm EGTA as appropriate, and proteins were released from the beads by boiling for 5 min in 20 μl of 2× SDS-PAGE loading buffer.

Science. 2006; 314: 1458-1461Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). Since Rem has been shown to directly interact with CaVβ subunits, and this association appears to be required for Rem-mediated blockade of surface-localized Ca2+ channels, we used confocal microscopy to examine whether CaVβ2a subunit expression modulates Rem trafficking to the plasma membrane. As seen in Fig. 1B, GFP-RemWT displayed a border-enriched fluorescence pattern, consistent with localization to the plasma membrane. Fluorescence was also observed in the cytosol but was excluded from the nucleus. The distribution of GFP-RemWT co-expressed with pCMVT7/F2 (control vector) was statistically indistinguishable from GFP-RemWT co-expressed with either FLAG-CaVβ2a, CaV1.2, or FLAG-CaVβ2a + CaV1.2 (Fig. 1B). Thus, plasma membrane localization of Rem probably involves an intrinsic membrane targeting domain and is not greatly influenced by interactions with Ca2+ channel subunits. To identify the structural domain in Rem responsible for plasma membrane trafficking, we generated a series of Rem C-terminal truncation mutants fused to GFP and examined their subcellular distribution using confocal microscopy in the presence of co-expressed empty FLAG vector control, FLAG-CaVβ2a, CaV1.2, or FLAG-CaVβ2a + CaV1.2 (Fig. 1C). Once again, co-expression of CaV subunits had no measurable effect on Rem mutant localization (Fig. 1C). Intensity profiling analysis (Fig. 1D) revealed that both GFP-Rem-(1–282) (5.05 ± 0.36, n = 40) and GFP-RemWT (2.89 ± 0.30, n = 28) were prominently localized to the cell periphery in a manner consistent with plasma membrane localization and, surprisingly, that Rem-(1–282) displayed significantly stronger targeting than RemWT (p < 0.001), perhaps suggesting that the distal C terminus plays a regulatory role in Rem localization. GFP-Rem-(1–276) (1.22 ± 0.02, n = 43) displayed only a slight enrichment at the cell periphery using this analysis; however, this truncation did show a statistically significant increase in membrane localization when compared with Rem-(1–270) (1.03 ± 0.01, n = 58) or Rem-(1–265) (0.99 ± 0.02, n = 55), which were expressed exclusively in the cytosol (p < 0.001) (Fig. 1, C and D). To understand this difference, we more closely examined the distribution of the GFP-Rem truncations by double-blind trial and noted that rather than a uniform membrane pattern of fluorescence, 73.96 ± 12.63% of cells expressing GFP-Rem-(1–276) displayed a punctate pattern of fluorescence at the cell boundary (Fig. 1E), as compared with 15.15 ± 13.21% of cells expressing GFP-Rem-(1–265) (p < 0.01). Taken together, these data suggest that residues 270–282 within the Rem C terminus play a critical role in targeting Rem to the plasma membrane. Truncation of the Rem C Terminus Disrupts Phosphatidylinositol (PI) Lipid Binding—Recent data suggest that many small GTPases bearing polybasic C termini are plasma membrane-localized and bind PI lipids, including the Gem and Rad GTPases (23Heo W.D. Inoue T. Park W.S. Kim M.L. Park B.O. Wandless T.J. Meyer T. Science. 2006; 314: 1458-1461Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). To examine whether the Rem C terminus also directs selective PI lipid binding, we performed an overlay assay utilizing 3× FLAG-tagged RemWT and Rem C-terminal truncations or empty 3× FLAG vector control, overexpressed in tsA201 cells, and PIP strips (Molecular Probes, Hybond membranes spotted with 15 different biologically active lipids). As shown in Fig. 2, RemWT and Rem-(1–282) displayed strong association with PtdIns(3)P, PtdIns(4)P, PtdIns(5)P, PtdIns(3,4)P2, PtdIns(3,5)P2, PtdIns(4,5)P2, PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, and phosphatidic acid, whereas greater C-terminal truncations resulted in substantially diminished lipid binding. These data correlate with the observed reduction in plasma membrane association (Fig. 1, C and D) and suggest that membrane localization is mediated in part by association of the Rem C terminus with phosphatidylinositol lipids. Contribution of the C Terminus to Rem-mediated Ca2+ Channel Regulation—The Rem truncation mutant Rem-(1–282) retains the ability to bind β2a and regulate Ca2+ channel activity, whereas Rem-(1–265) is incapable of HVA Ca2+ channel regulation and displays reduced β2a binding (9Finlin B.S. Crump S.M. Satin J. Andres D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 14469-14474Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). However, since Rem-(1–265) is not plasma membrane-localized (Fig. 1, C and D), we next asked whether the intermediate Rem truncations were capable of binding β2a and regulating Ca2+ channel function. To this end, 3× HA-tagged versions of Rem-(1–265), Rem-(1–270), Rem-(1–276), and RemWT were analyzed for β2a binding (Fig. 3A). As reported previously, Rem-(1–265) displayed an almost complete loss of association with FLAG-β2a (9Finlin B.S. Crump S.M. Satin J. Andres D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sc"

Both NAD(P) and NAD(P)H are essential cofactors for a large number of enzymes involved in various metabolic pathways such as oxidoreductases. This activity of NADKs has been well known for decades, but their genes were cloned only recently (9Kawai S. Mori S. Mukai T. Suzuki S. Yamada T. Hashimoto W. Murata K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 57-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), subsequently leading to rapid identification of NADK orthologs in many organisms from bacteria, Archaea, plants, and human (Pfam PF01513). Bacterial and human enzymes show significant functional and sequence divergences, and the NADK activity in human cells is low (10Lerner F. Niere M. Ludwig A. Ziegler M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 288: 69-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). However, despite recent advances in the characterization of NADKs, the reaction mechanism is not well understood, and some original features of NADKs remain unexplained. First, during catalysis the phosphorylation occurs specifically on 2′-hydroxyl of the adenosine moiety of NAD and not on the neighboring 3′-hydroxyl. Second, the specificity for the catalytic di-cation is low (Mn2+, Ca2+, Zn2+, Co2+, and Fe2+ appear equivalent to Mg2+) (11Schomburg I. Chang A. Ebeling C. Gremse M. Heldt C. Huhn G. Schomburg D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 431-433Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas it is generally high in other well characterized kinases. Furthermore, the di-cation binding motif is yet unknown. Finally, most NADKs use as a phospho-donor various nucleoside triphosphates (9Kawai S. Mori S. Mukai T. Suzuki S. Yamada T. Hashimoto W. Murata K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 57-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 12Garavaglia S. Galizzi A. Rizzi M. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 4844-4850Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 13Kawai S. Mori S. Mukai T. Hashimoto W. Murata K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 4359-4365Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Polyphosphates can also act as a donor but only for NADKs from Gram(+) bacteria and from mycobacteria (9Kawai S. Mori S. Mukai T. Suzuki S. Yamada T. Hashimoto W. Murata K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 57-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). On the contrary, the human NADK counterpart preferentially uses ATP (7% activity with GTP) (10Lerner F. Niere M. Ludwig A. Ziegler M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 288: 69-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The recent determination of the crystal structures of NADKs from M. tuberculosis and Archaeoglobus fulgidus unbound or in the presence of NAD or NADP allowed to more clearly locate the active site (14Garavaglia S. Raffaelli N. Finaurini L. Magni G. Rizzi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40980-40986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 15Liu J. Lou Y. Yokota H. Adams P.D. Kim R.

Commun. 2005; 327: 500-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), but the precise reaction mechanism remained speculative (15Liu J. Lou Y. Yokota H. Adams P.D. Kim R. Kim S.H. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 354: 289-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We now report crystal structures of NADK from the human pathogen Listeria monocytogenes (LmNADK1) as a first representative of the enzymes from Gram(+) bacilli. The crystal structures of LmNADK1 ligand-free or in complex with its natural substrate or its product were solved at 2.3, 2.1, and 2.1 Å, respectively. Furthermore, we designed and synthesized two molecules mimicking NAD: di-adenosine diphosphate and di-5′-thioadenosine. Additionally, we characterized two mutants whose function, but not their structure, was affected. Our analysis highlights important and previously unnoticed features of the NAD reaction mechanism. (i) We reveal the molecular basis for the 2′-hydroxyl specificity of NAD, (ii) we show that NADKs and the structurally related phosphofructokinases (PFKs) use the same catalytic GGDGT motif in a different manner, and (iii) we suggest that the diphosphate group of the substrate plays the role of a di-cation chelator, revealing a mechanism involving substrate-assisted catalysis. Chemicals, Bacterial Strains, Plasmids—The oligonucleotides were synthesized by MWG-Biotech. The restriction enzymes were purchased from Biolabs and Roche Applied Science. Vent DNA polymerase and Tfu DNA polymerase were from Qbiogene, and T4 DNA ligase was purchased from Biolabs. Isopropyl-β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside was from ICN Biomedical Inc. Isocitrate dehydrogenase from porcine heart, sodium isocitrate, NAD, and nucleosides triphosphates were from Sigma or Roche Applied Science. The kits used for plasmid preparation were from either Sigma or Macherey-Nagel. Genomic DNA of L. monocytogenes strain EGD-e was a gift of P. Cossart (Institut Pasteur). The Escherichia coli strains NM554 and BL21(DE3)/pDIA17 were purchased from Stratagene and Novagen. Cloning, Site-directed Mutagenesis, and Expression in E. coli—The NAD kinase 1 (EC 2.7.1.23) coding sequence was amplified by PCR from the genomic DNA isolated from L. monocytogenes strain EGD-e by using the Vent DNA polymerase, dNTPs, and the following primers: 5′-Lm, 5′-GGAATTCCATATGAAATATATGATTACTTCCAAAGGA-3′, and 3′-Lm, 5′-CGGCGCTCGAGTTAATCTTCAATAAACGAATCGTGTAC-3′. The amplified DNA was cloned into the expression vector pET22b (Novagen) at the NdeI and XhoI restriction sites (underlined) giving the following plasmid pLA15.3.3. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the double PCR method by using the Tfu DNA polymerase the two above primers and the following mutagenic primers: D45N, 5′-AGACAGAAATGTTCCATTGCCACCAATAGAAAT-3′, and H223E, 5′-ATGCAAAATGCTCAGCTCGTCTACAGAAATTTG-3′. The final PCR products were purified and cloned into the pET22b vector at the NdeI and XhoI restriction sites. The mutated genes were sequenced, and the corresponding plasmids were then used for transforming the E. coli strain BL21(DE3)/pDIA17 for protein expression. The transformants were grown at 37 °C in 2YT medium (Difco) in the presence of chloramphenicol and ampicillin at 30 μg/ml. When the absorbance reached 1.5 at 600 nm, the expression of the both recombinant proteins was then induced by the addition of 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside, and growth was continued for three more hours at 37 °C. The cells were then pelleted by centrifugation and served as source for protein purification. For production of the selenomethionine derivative, selenomethionine was incorporated in place of methionine, whereas the cells were grown in M9 minimum media supplemented with 20 mm glucose, 2 mm magnesium sulfate, ampicillin (30 μg/ml), and chloramphenicol (30 μg/ml) at 37 °C. When the absorbance at 600 nm reached 0.5, the medium was supplemented with the amino acids lysine, threonine, and phenylalanine at 100 mg/ml and leucine, isoleucine, valine, and selenomethionine at 50 mg/ml. After 30 min the expression was induced by the addition of 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside for 16 h at 37 °C. Soluble protein was purified using cobalt-agarose affinity chromatography followed by size exclusion chromatography. The protein was concentrated to 6–7 mg/ml in 25 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.2. The mutants were produced as described above for the wild-type enzyme and showed similar characteristics as monitored by SDS/PAGE, dynamic light scattering, and circular dichroism (data not shown). Enzymatic Assay—The NAD kinase activity was determined by measuring the NADP produced by using isocitrate dehydrogenase as a coupling enzyme. Kinetic parameters for ATP were obtained by fitting data to the Michaelis-Menten equation. Kinetics parameters for NAD were obtained by fitting data to the Hill equation. For determination of ADP produced, enzyme was incubated in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2 with substrates or inhibitors at various concentrations for 30 min at 30 °C. Cobalt resin was added to the sample for removal of the protein and centrifuged. The supernatant was tested for ADP production in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 0.2 mm NADH, and 2 units each of lactate dehydrogenase and pyruvate kinase, and the decrease of absorbance was measured at 340 nm at 30 °C using a spectrophotometer Eppendorf ECOM 6122. Phosphorylation of di-5′-thioadenosine (DTA) was tested at rather high concentrations of substrate (3 mm) due to the low overall activity (no activity detected at 1 mm) of the wild-type and mutant enzymes. Crystallization—Initial crystallization conditions of LmNADK1 were found by using a hanging-drop-based sparse-matrix screening strategy. The best crystals were obtained by mixing 1 μl of the protein solution (concentration 11–15 mg/ml) with an equal volume of crystallization buffer (0.3 m potassium chloride, 50 mm trisodium citrate dihydrate, pH 5.6, 15–20% w/v polyethylene glycol 400) equilibrated over 0.5 ml of the same buffer. Two independent crystal forms were grown in nearly identical conditions in the presence of 10 mm iodine (apo structure, space group P21) or in the presence (holo structure, space group I222) of 10 mm 5′-thioacetyladenosine (TAA, Fig. 1C). The complexes with bound NAD, NADP, and NAD mimics were solved using crystals in the orthorhombic form. After growing them in presence of TAA, crystals were washed in the mother liquor and soaked with millimolar concentration of the desired ligand in a preequilibrated hanging drop. Crystallographic Studies—X-ray diffraction data sets were collected from frozen single crystals at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Grenoble, France, beamlines BM30A, ID14, and ID23) and processed with the programs MOSFLM, SCALA, and TRUNCATE from the CCP4 program suites (18Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar) (Tables 1 and 2). The structure was solved by using a multiple wavelength anomalous diffraction experiment from a highly redundant 4-Å data set of the selenomethionine-labeled protein. Twenty-two of 24 selenium sites were found by direct methods with the program SHAKE’N′BAKE (19Weeks C.M. Miller R. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 492-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) and refined with the program SHARP (20Bricogne G. Vonrhein C. Flensburg C. Schiltz M. Paciorek W. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 2023-2030Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). Electron density modification was performed with SOLOMON (20Bricogne G. Vonrhein C. Flensburg C. Schiltz M. Paciorek W. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 2023-2030Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). A molecular replacement solution was obtained using the program PHASER (21Cowtan K. Newsletter on Protein Crystallography. 1994; 31: 34-38Google Scholar) and the crystal structure PDB code 1U0R (14Garavaglia S. Raffaelli N. Finaurini L. Magni G. Rizzi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40980-40986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Phases derived from multiwavelength anomalous diffraction data and from molecular replacement were then combined using the program DMMULTI (22McCoy A.J. Storoni L.C. Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 1220-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). 4-Fold NCS was applied in DMMULTI (22McCoy A.J. Storoni L.C. Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 1220-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and during the first steps of refinement in REFMAC5 as implemented in CCP4 (18Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). Iterative model rebuilding and refinement was performed first by using the program O (23Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar) and then the program COOT (24Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23628) Google Scholar) and the program REFMAC5 using a translation/libration/screw model (25Winn M.D. Isupov M.N. Murshudov G.N. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 122-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1654) Google Scholar) against the native data set at 2.4-Å resolution. In the final model short segments of the protein (loops 69-TGHL-72, 110-GIGKK-114, and 129-SGGP-132) are not clearly visible in the electron density map. Similarly, the last residue and/or the affinity tag (monomers A, C, and D) or the last five histidines (monomer B) could not be modeled.TABLE 1Data collection, phasing, and refinement statistics for apo LmNADK1NativeSeMet peakSeMet inflectionSeMet remoteData collection Space groupP21P21 Cell dimension a, b, c (Å)66.6, 119.0, 67.967.2, 119.3, 67.5 β (°)102.0102.0 No. molecules (in a.u.)44 Wavelength (Å)0.97980.97970.98010.9778 Resolution (Å)aValues in parentheses refer to the outermost resolution shell.34.5-2.34 (2.47-2.34)57.5-4.00 (4.20-4.00) Rmerge (%)aValues in parentheses refer to the outermost resolution shell.,bRmerge = ∑hkl∑i_|Ihk,i — Iaverage,hkl|/|∑hkl∑i_|Ihkl,i| × 100.6.6 (43.1)5.0 (8.4)4.6 (9.2)4.5 (7.2) I/σIaValues in parentheses refer to the outermost resolution shell.13.9 (2.9)18.9 (8.0)18 (6.0)20.1 (7.9) Completeness (%)aValues in parentheses refer to the outermost resolution shell.97.5 (99.3)96.6 (77.7)94.1 (68.4)97.7 (85.2) RedundancyaValues in parentheses refer to the outermost resolution shell.3.6 (3.6)3.4 (1.6)2.9 (1.5)3.4 (1.6) B-wilson49.931.644.939.7Refinement Resolution (Å)34.5-2.34 No. Reflections42,472 Rwork/Rfree (%)cRwork = ∑hkl|Fobs — Fcalc|/∑hkl|Fobs| × 100.

Open table in a new tab Molecular replacement was performed to solve the first structure in orthorhombic form. Subsequent determinations were performed on isomorphous crystals. Refinement was performed using REFMAC5 using the same translation/libration/screw model. As in the case of the monoclinic form, some side chains and several short segments of the protein (mainly loops 69-TGHL-72, 110-GIGKK-114, and less frequently 129-SGGP-132) are not clearly visible in the electron density map. Similarly, the last residue and/or the affinity tag could not be modeled in most protein-ligand complexes. Figures of ligands and corresponding electronic density were generated using PyMOL (DeLano Scientific). Chemical Synthesis—Solvents were spectroscopic or HPLC grade. 1H and 31P NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance 400 spectrometer operating at 400.13 MHz and 161.97 MHz, respectively. Preparative and analytical HPLC were carried out on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences system (200 Pump) using a C18 reverse phase column (Kromasil, particle size 5; pore size 100) at a flow rate of 5.5 or 1 ml/min and a linear gradient of CH3CN in 20 mm triethylammonium acetate buffer at pH 7.5 over 20 min. Mass spectra were recorded at the mass spectroscopy laboratory (CNRS-ICSN, Gif-sur-Yvette). TAA was synthesized from commercially available 2′,3′-isopropylidene-adenosine and thioacetic acid under Mitsunobu conditions as previously described (17Pignot M. Pljevaljcic G. Weinhold E. Eur. J. Org. Chem. 2000; 3: 549-555Crossref Google Scholar). The acetonide group was then removed in aqueous formic acid to yield after purification by silica gel chromatography TAA in a total yield of 60%. 5′-thioadenosine (Fig. 1C) was obtained from TAA by hydrolysis using a mixture of MeOH/H2O saturated with ammonia under oxygen free conditions. The chemical structure of 5′-thioadenosine was confirmed by NMR and mass analysis, and its purity (absence of disulfide formation) was checked by reverse phase HPLC analysis and compared with DTA as control. Di-adenosine diphosphate (Ap2A, Fig. 1B) was prepared by condensation of 5′-phosphomorpholidate of adenosine (26Moffatt J.G.A. Can. J. Chem. 1964; 42: 599-604Crossref Google Scholar) and adenosine 5′-monophosphate as the tributylammonium salt in anhydrous N,N-dimethylformamide. After purification by reverse phase HPLC, Ap2A was isolated as sodium salt in 50% yield. Overall Structure and Topology—Two independent crystal forms were grown in nearly identical conditions in the absence (apo structure, space group P21) or in the presence of an adenosine analogue (holo structure, space group I222) named 5′-thioacetyladenosine (hereafter TAA, Fig. 1C). First, we determined the apo structure of LmNADK1 in the P21 crystal form. Initial molecular replacement trials using 2.4-Å resolution data from native P21 crystals and the structure of the mycobacterial NADK (14Garavaglia S. Raffaelli N. Finaurini L. Magni G. Rizzi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40980-40986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), which is only 24% identical in sequence to LmNADK1, yielded a solution with plausible crystal packing and a score above noise level. However, this model could not be easily refined. Structure determination was only successful once this molecular replacement solution were combined with low resolution (4 Å) multiple-wavelength anomalous diffraction data from a selenomethionine derivative and subjected to 4-fold averaging. The resulting electron density allowed rebuilding and refinement of the LmNADK1 tetramer using native data to 2.4 Å of resolution (Table 1). Then the structure of the second crystal form (space group I222) was solved by molecular replacement using the native structure (Table 2). LmNADK1 is a homotetramer of approximate dimensions 100 × 60 × 50 Å (Fig. 2). In the monoclinic crystal, one tetramer was observed in the asymmetric unit and corresponds to the biological tetramer. Only one monomer is present in the orthorhombic form, and the biological tetramer was deduced from the crystallographic symmetries. The tetrameric arrangement is very similar to that described for the other NADKs and corresponds to a dimer of dimers, stabilized by large interfaces (∼3500 A2) between the C-terminal domains. The monomer structure of LmNADK1 is very similar to one of homologues from M. tuberculosis and A. fulgidus, showing root mean square deviations of 2.2 and 2.4 Å, respectively. Nevertheless, some structural features in the C-terminal domain appeared specific to the NADKs from Gram(+) bacilli, in particular a sequence motif 188-NnrvfR-193 in the vicinity of the bound nucleobases, corresponding to a small loop absent in other NADKs (supplemental Fig. S1). Within each monomer the polypeptide chain is organized into an N-terminal and a C-terminal domain (Fig. 2). The C-terminal domain adopts an original topology composed of two β-sheets arranged in an antiparallel 12-stranded β-sandwich. It comprises most of the motifs strictly conserved among NADKs, including the motif 150-DG///sTPsGsTAY-163 involved in NAD recognition (27Raffaeli N. Finaurini L. Mazzola F. Pucci L. Sorci L. Amici A. Magni G. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 7610-7617Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) (where/stands for any hydrophobic residue, and lowercase/capital letters are partially/strictly conserved residues, respectively) (see supplemental Fig. S1). The N-terminal domain is composed of five β-strands and three α-helices. In LmNADK1 and in its orthologs from other Gram(+) bacteria, the N-terminal domain is shorter than in other NADKs due to the loss of the second α-helix. This domain harbors the well conserved motif GGDGT. Besides this motif, little conservation is observed, in agreement with the low level of specificity for the phosphate donor (which can be polyphosphate or any nucleoside triphosphate). Binding of Natural Substrates to LmNADK1—To investigate the catalytic mechanism, we next tried to obtain crystal forms of LmNADK1 bound to NAD or NADP. Despite several attempts of soaking and co-crystallization with NAD or NADP, monoclinic P21 apo crystals failed to reveal electron density corresponding to these ligands. Soaking of NAD or NADP was finally successful with the second crystal form, I222. The ligand TAA was washed out and successfully replaced by NAD or NADP. Because apo as well as NAD and NADP-bound crystals yielded near 2-Å data sets (Table 2), the catalytic mechanism can be analyzed in more detail (supplemental Figs. S2 and S3). Despite the change in crystal forms, the overall structures of the apoenzyme and the bound states were highly similar, with only small re-orientation of the two domains (Fig. 2) as well as of a few side chains in the substrate binding site (root mean square deviation of 0.15–0.53 Å for isolated N-terminal and C-terminal domains versus 0.47–0.75 Å for full-length chains). As in other NADKs, the dinucleoside diphosphate binding site of LmNADK1 was formed at the interface between the two domains. The conserved motif from the N-terminal domain faces those from the C-terminal domain at the edges of the interfacial groove. Two distinct binding pockets, named sites A and N, accommodate the adenosine and the nicotinamide ribose, respectively (supplemental Figs. S2 and S3). Although the site A is composed of residues from only one monomer, the site N includes an aspartate (Asp-150′ in LmNADK1) and an alanine (Ala-185′) from a second monomer. In the site A (supplemental Figs. S2 and S3), the adenine ring is sandwiched between the side chain and the carboxylate of Ala-162 and part of the side chains of Asp-45 and Phe-74. Specific recognition of the adenine moiety involves mainly two residues: Asn-122 and Thr-161. Their side chains are hydrogen-bonded to the N6 amino group and the N7 and N3 nitrogens of the adenine. These two residues are well conserved in most NADKs and participate in an intricate hydrogen-bond network involving the neighboring side chain of Tyr-75 and the Ser-158 carboxylate. In turn, the hydroxyl of Ser-158 is also hydrogen-bonded to the hydroxyl of Tyr-75. On the contrary, few interactions are observed with the ribose moiety of adenosine beside the hydrogen bond"
https://openalex.org/W2079181465,"The molybdenum cofactor (Moco) exists in different variants in the cell and can be directly inserted into molybdoenzymes utilizing the molybdopterin (MPT) form of Moco. In bacteria such as Rhodobacter capsulatus and Escherichia coli, MPT is further modified by attachment of a GMP nucleotide, forming MPT guanine dinucleotide (MGD). In this work, we analyzed the distribution and targeting of different forms of Moco to their respective user enzymes by proteins that bind Moco and are involved in its further modification. The R. capsulatus proteins MogA, MoeA, MobA, and XdhC were purified, and their specific interactions were analyzed. Interactions between the protein pairs MogA-MoeA, MoeA-XdhC, MoeA-MobA, and XdhC-MobA were identified by surface plasmon resonance measurements. In addition, the transfer of Moco produced by the MogA-MoeA complex to XdhC was investigated. A direct competition of MobA and XdhC for Moco binding was determined. In vitro analyses showed that XdhC bound to MobA, prevented the binding of Moco to MobA, and thereby inhibited MGD biosynthesis. The data were confirmed by in vivo studies in R. capsulatus cells showing that overproduction of XdhC resulted in a 50% decrease in the activity of bis-MGD-containing Me2SO reductase. We propose that, in bacteria, the distribution of Moco in the cell and targeting to the respective user enzymes are accomplished by specific proteins involved in Moco binding and modification.

Moco consists of a molybdenum atom coordinated to the dithiolene group of a tricyclic pyranopterin referred to as molybdopterin (MPT) (1Rajagopalan K.V. Johnson J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10199-10202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The biosynthesis of Moco is highly conserved in eukaryotes and prokaryotes (1Rajagopalan K.V. Johnson J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10199-10202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and can be divided into three general steps. In the first step, GTP is converted to the meta-stable intermediate Precursor Z (2Wuebbens M.M. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1082-1087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 3Hänzelmann P. Schindelin H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 12870-12875Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). In the second step, Precursor Z is further transformed by MPT synthase into MPT by generation of its characteristic dithiolene group (4Pitterle D.M. Johnson J.L. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13506-13509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Gutzke G. Fischer B. Mendel R. Schwarz G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36268-36274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In the third step, molybdate is inserted to the MPT dithiolene sulfurs, a reaction catalyzed by MogA and MoeA in Escherichia coli (6Joshi M.S. Johnson J.L. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4310-4312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Nichols J. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol.

MoeA mediates molybdenum ligation, whereas MogA helps to facilitate this step in an ATP-dependent manner (8Nichols J. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 7817-7822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Recently, studies with the homologous Arabidopsis thaliana CNX1 protein G and E domains identified the formation of an MPT-AMP intermediate before the ligation of molybdate to the MPT moiety (9Llamas A. Mendel R.R. Schwarz G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 55241-55246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 10Llamas A. Otte T. Multhaup G. Mendel R.R. Schwarz G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 18343-18350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). An unexpected observation in the crystal structure of the A. thaliana CNX1 protein G domain was the identification of copper bound to the MPT-AMP dithiolene sulfurs (11Kuper J. Llamas A. Hecht H.J. Mendel R.R. Schwarz G. Nature. 2004; 430: 803-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Up to now, the function of this novel MPT ligand has been unknown, but it was speculated that copper might play a role in sulfur transfer to Precursor Z, in protection of the MPT dithiolene from oxidation, and/or in presentation of a suitable leaving group for molybdenum insertion (12Schwarz G. CMLS Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2005; 62: 2792-2810Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). To date, copper-MPT-AMP has not been identified as an intermediate in the biosynthesis of Moco in E. coli (8Nichols J. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol.

After the insertion of molybdenum into MPT in E. coli, Moco either can be directly inserted into molybdoenzymes (such as YedY) binding the MPT form of Moco (13Loschi L. Brokx S.J. Hills T.L. Zhang G.

Chem. 1991; 266: 12140-12145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), forming the bis-MPT guanine dinucleotide (bis-MGD) form of Moco found in enzymes of the Me2SO reductase family (16Kisker C. Schindelin H. Rees D.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 233-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). In E. coli, the GMP attachment to Moco is catalyzed by the MobA and MobB proteins (17Palmer T. Vasishta A. Whitty P.W. Boxer D.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 687-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Whereas MobA was shown to be essential for this reaction (18Palmer T. Santini C.L. Iobbi-Nivol C. Eaves D.J. Boxer D.H. Giordano G. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 875-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), the role of MobB still remains uncertain. From the crystal structure, it was postulated that MobB is an adapter protein that acts in concert with MobA to achieve the efficient biosynthesis and utilization of MGD (19McLuskey K. Harrison J.A. Schüttelkopf A.W. Boxer D.H. Hunter W.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23706-23713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Enzymes containing the MPT form of Moco belong to either the sulfite oxidase or xanthine oxidase family, whereas enzymes binding the bis-MGD form of Moco belong to the Me2SO reductase family of molybdoenzymes. In Rhodobacter capsulatus, xanthine dehydrogenase (XDH; EC 1.17.1.4) is the only identified enzyme harboring the MPT form of the cofactor, whereas all other known molybdoenzymes bind the bis-MGD form of the cofactor (20Leimkühler S. Kern M. Solomon P.S. McEwan A.G. Schwarz G. Mendel R.R. Klipp W. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 853-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). An essential role for the XdhC protein in the maturation of R. capsulatus XDH has been described, which entails binding of Moco and its insertion into the XdhB subunit of XDH (21Neumann M. Schulte M. Jünemann N. Stöcklein W. Leimkühler S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 15701-15708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). For all members of the xanthine oxidase family, the sulfurated form of Moco is essential for catalysis, where the equatorial of the two oxygen ligands of nascent Moco is replaced by sulfur (22Hille R. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2757-2816Crossref PubMed Scopus (1470) Google Scholar). Previous work showed that XdhC specifically promotes the exchange of this ligand by interaction with the l-cysteine desulfurase NifS4, which transfers the sulfur to Moco bound to XdhC (23Neumann M. Stöcklein W. Walburger A. Magalon A. Leimkühler S. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 9586-9595Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). It has remained so far unclear which protein of the Moco biosynthesis pathway acts as the direct Moco donor for XdhC. So far, R. capsulatus XdhC is the only protein identified in bacteria shown to be involved in the modification of Moco by exchange of an oxo ligand of Moco with sulfur. To investigate the question of targeting, distribution, and insertion of different forms of Moco into the specific molybdoenzymes in R. capsulatus, we cloned and purified the MogA, MoeA, and MobA proteins from R. capsulatus for the investigation of protein-protein interactions in the homologous system. A MobB homolog seems not to be present in R. capsulatus (24Leimkühler S. Klipp W. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1999; 174: 239-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In this study, we show for the first time that the amounts of sulfurated Moco and bis-MGD produced in the cell are regulated at the protein level by protein-protein interactions. We show that both MobA and XdhC receive Moco from MoeA; however, by binding to MobA, XdhC prevents the Moco transfer to MobA, thus inhibiting MGD formation. This regulation ensures that enough Moco is abstracted from the major route of bis-MGD biosynthesis for further modification to the sulfurated form of Moco and thus ensures that enough of the MPT form of Moco is provided to produce an active XDH, an enzyme involved in the purine degradation pathway. Bacterial Strains, Plasmids, Media, and Growth Conditions—E. coli BL21(DE3) cells were used for heterologous expression of the R. capsulatus proteins MobA, MoeA, and MogA. R. capsulatus XdhC was expressed in E. coli ER2566(DE3) cells and purified as described previously (21Neumann M. Schulte M. Jünemann N. Stöcklein W. Leimkühler S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 15701-15708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The human sulfite oxidase Moco domain (hSO-MD) was expressed from plasmid pTG818 (25Temple C.A. Graf T.N. Rajagopalan K.V. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 383: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) in E. coli TP1000(ΔmobAB) cells (18Palmer T. Santini C.L. Iobbi-Nivol C. Eaves D.J. Boxer D.H. Giordano G. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 875-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) to obtain Moco-containing hSO-MD or in E. coli RK5202(modC-) cells (26Miller J.B. Scott D.J. Amy N.K. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 1853-1860Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to obtain MPT-containing hSO-MD. The hSO-MD variants were purified as described previously by Temple et al. (25Temple C.A. Graf T.N. Rajagopalan K.V. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 383: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). E. coli cultures were grown in LB medium under aerobic conditions at 30 °C. The E. coli S17-1 strain was used for conjugation of R. capsulatus KS36 (B10S(ΔnifHDK::Spc)) (27Wang G. Angermüller S. Klipp W. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 3031-3042Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with plasmid pSL160, expressing xdhC under the control of the nifH promotor from plasmid pPHU231 (28Reyes F. Roldan M.D. Klipp W.

Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 5930-5939Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For control experiments, pSL143 harboring only the nifH promotor cloned into plasmid pPHU231 and pMN80 expressing mobA under the control of the nifH promotor were introduced into KS36 cells. R. capsulatus cells were grown in RCV minimal medium supplemented with (NH4)2SO4 as described previously (31Klipp W. Masepohl B. Pühler A. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 693-699Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For expression of Me2SO reductase, Me2SO was added to a final concentration of 30 mm, and for induction of XdhC or MobA expression from the plasmids, (NH4)2SO4 was replaced with 1 g/liter serine as the nitrogen source. R. capsulatus cells were grown under anaerobic, phototrophic conditions and harvested at late log phase after 48 h of growth at 30 °C. When required, 1 mm Na2MoO4, 150 μg/ml ampicillin, 25 μg/ml kanamycin, and 5 μg/ml tetracycline (for E. coli) or 1 μg/ml tetracycline (for R. capsulatus) were added to the medium. Cloning, Expression, and Purification of R. capsulatus MobA, MoeA, and MogA—DNA fragments containing the coding regions for R. capsulatus mobA, moeA, and mogA were amplified by PCR, and flanking restriction sites were introduced. The moeA and mogA genes were cloned into the NdeI-XhoI sites and mobA into the NdeI-SalI sites of pET28a (Novagen), resulting in plasmids pMN32, pMN53, and pMN56, respectively. For expression of MoeA, MogA, and MobA, E. coli BL21(DE3) cells were transformed with plasmids pMN32, pMN53, and pMN56, respectively, and cell growth was started with 10 ml of overnight culture/liter of LB medium. The cells were grown at 30 °C, and expression of MogA and MobA was induced at A600 = 0.3–0.5 with 100 μm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Cell growth was continued for 5 h, and cells were harvested and resuspended in 50 mm NaH2PO4 and 300 mm NaCl (pH 8.0). After cell lysis, the soluble fraction was transferred onto a column with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA; Qiagen Inc.). The resin was washed with 20 column volumes of phosphate buffer first containing 10 mm and then 20 mm imidazole. The proteins were eluted with phosphate buffer containing 250 mm imidazole and dialyzed against 100 mm Tris (pH 7.2). For MoeA, expression was induced with 300 μm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside; the shaking rate was increased to 210 rpm; and cells were harvested 3 h after induction of gene expression. After cell lysis, the soluble fraction was transferred onto nickel-triscarboxymethylethylenediamine (Macherey-Nagel). The column was washed with 40 column volumes of phosphate buffer containing 10 mm imidazole, and MoeA was eluted with the same buffer containing 250 mm imidazole and dialyzed against 100 mm Tris (pH 7.2). MGD Formation by MobA—Moco was obtained after heat treatment of purified hSO-MD expressed in TP1000 cells, and MPT was obtained after heat treatment of purified hSO-MD expressed in RK5202 cells as described previously by Temple et al. (25Temple C.A. Graf T.N. Rajagopalan K.V. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 383: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and Neumann et al. (21Neumann M. Schulte M. Jünemann N. Stöcklein W. Leimkühler S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 15701-15708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). 100 μm MobA was incubated with 160 μm Moco or MPT before excess Moco/MPT was removed by gel filtration. 1 mm Na2MoO4 was included in incubation mixtures containing Moco. 1 mm MgCl2 and 1 mm GTP were added, and the mixtures were incubated for 60 min at room temperature in a total volume of 400 μl of 100 mm Tris (pH 7.2) before the protein was denatured and analyzed for the presence of Moco or MGD by conversion to Form A (as described below). MPT and Moco Binding by MogA, MoeA, and MobA—KD values were determined by ultrafiltration as described previously (21Neumann M. Schulte M. Jünemann N. Stöcklein W. Leimkühler S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 15701-15708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Samples contained 6 μm MogA, MoeA, or MobA and 0–24 μm Moco or MPT. Moco, MPT, and MGD Analysis—The Moco/MPT content of the purified proteins was quantified after conversion to Form A as described previously (21Neumann M. Schulte M. Jünemann N. Stöcklein W. Leimkühler S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 15701-15708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). To separate Form A obtained from Moco/MPT and Form A-GMP obtained from MGD, the protocol originally described by Joshi and Rajagopalan (32Joshi M.S. Rajagopalan K.V. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 308: 331-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) was used with some modifications. MGD was converted to Form A-GMP and Moco/MPT to Form A by overnight treatment with acidic iodine at room temperature (33Johnson J.L. Hainline B.E. Rajagopalan K.V. Arison B.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5414-5422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Form A was separated from Form A-GMP by chromatography on Q-Sepharose (GE Healthcare). 400 μl of Q-Sepharose was equilibrated with H2O; the oxidized samples were loaded; and Form A was eluted with 10 mm acetic acid. Form A-GMP was eluted with 50 mm HCl and converted to Form A by the addition of MgCl2, nucleotide pyrophosphatase, and alkaline phosphatase at pH 8.0. The pH of the samples was adjusted to pH 5.3 by the addition of 10 μl of 50% acetic acid before application to a C18 reversed-phase high pressure liquid chromatography column (4.6 × 250-mm Hypersil ODS, 5-μm particle size) equilibrated in 5 mm ammonium acetate and 15% methanol. In-line fluorescence was monitored by an Agilent 1100 series detector with excitation at 383 nm and emission at 450 nm. Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) Measurements—All binding experiments were performed with the SPR-based instrument Biacore™ 2000 on CM5 sensor chips at 25 °C and a flow rate of 10 μl/min using BiaControl 2.1 and BiaEvaluation 3.0 software (Biacore AB) as described previously (23Neumann M. Stöcklein W. Walburger A. Magalon A. Leimkühler S. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 9586-9595Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The proteins were immobilized after dilution in 10 mm acetate buffer at pH 4 (bovine serum albumin, MoeA, and MogA) or pH 5 (XdhC, XDH, and MobA). For control experiments, the N-terminal His6 tags of MoeA, MogA, and MobA were cleaved using the thrombin CleanCleave kit (Sigma). Cleavage was controlled by SDS-PAGE. In Vitro Transfer of Moco from MoeA to XdhC—For production of Moco, 15 μm MPT obtained from hSO-MD was incubated with 30 μm MogA, 30 μm MoeA, 37.5 μm Na2MoO4, 1 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm ATP in a volume of 200 μl of 100 mm Tris (pH 7.2). After 15 min of incubation at room temperature, 8 μm XdhC was added, and the mixture was further incubated for 20 min before MoeA and MogA were removed by Ni-NTA chromatography. Single components were left out for control experiments. Free Moco in the XdhC fraction was removed by an additional gel filtration step using NICK columns (GE Healthcare). 400 μl of the XdhC fraction was treated with acidic iodine, and bound Moco was quantified as Form A fluorescence as described above. The same setup as described above was used to analyze the competition of Moco transfer from MoeA to XdhC in the presence of MobA. To avoid free Moco in the assay, these mixtures contained 15 μm XdhC and either 15 μm or 150 μm MobA in addition to 1 mm GTP. In Vitro Transfer of Moco from MobA to XdhC—25 μm MobA was incubated with 100 μm Moco and 1 mm Na2MoO4 for 10 min at room temperature, and excess Moco was removed by gel filtration. Moco bound to MobA was quantified after conversion to Form A. 10 μm XdhC was added to the Moco-loaded MobA fraction before MobA and XdhC were separated by Ni-NTA chromatography. Free Moco in the XdhC fraction was further removed by gel filtration. 400 μl of the XdhC fraction was treated with acidic iodine, and released Moco was converted to Form A and quantified as described above. Formation of MGD by MobA in the Presence of XdhC—To analyze the influence of XdhC on Moco binding to MobA, 10 μm MobA was incubated with 0, 1, 10, and 100 μm XdhC for 10 min at room temperature before the addition of 1 mm GTP, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm Na2MoO4, and 80 μm Moco. In another set of experiments, XdhC was added after incubation of 115 μm MobA with 190 μm Moco and 1 mm Na2MoO4 for 10 min at room temperature. Unbound Moco was removed by gel filtration, and 50 μl of the Moco-loaded MobA fraction was incubated with 1 mm Na2MoO4, 1 mm GTP, and increasing amounts of XdhC (0, 1.16, 11.6, and 116 μm) in a total volume of 400 μl in 100 mm Tris (pH 7.2). The incubation mixtures were incubated for 90 min under anaerobic conditions, and the MGD content of all samples was quantified as described above. Analysis of XDH and Me2SO Reductase Activities in R. capsulatus Crude Extracts—Plasmids were mobilized from E. coli S17-1 into R. capsulatus KS36 by filter mating as described previously (31Klipp W. Masepohl B. Pühler A. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 693-699Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Crude extracts were obtained after cell lysis by sonification and subsequent removal of cell debris by centrifugation. Protein concentrations were determined following the method of Bradford (34Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214455) Google Scholar). XDH activity was measured as described previously (24Leimkühler S. Klipp W. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1999; 174: 239-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The specific XDH activity (units/mg) is defined as the reduction of 1 μmol of NAD+/min/mg of enzyme. Me2SO reductase activity was measured as described by McEwan et al. (35McEwan A.G. Wetzstein H.G. Ferguson S.J. Jackson J.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 806: 410-417Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar) with dithionite-reduced benzyl viologen as the electron donor. Me2SO reductase activity (units/mg) is defined as the reduction of 1 μmol of Me2SO/min/mg of protein. Purification and Analysis of the Functional Activities of R. capsulatus MobA, MoeA, and MogA—For purification of R. capsulatus MobA, MoeA, and MogA, fusion proteins were generated each containing an N-terminal His6 tag (see “Experimental Procedures”). After heterologous expression in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells, the soluble fractions of MobA, MoeA, and MogA were purified by affinity chromatography (see “Experimental Procedures”). After elution, one major band was displayed for MobA, MoeA, and MogA on Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels, corresponding to molecular masses of 22.1, 44.6, and 20.3 kDa, respectively (Fig. 1A). This procedure yielded ∼6.5 mg of MobA/liter of E. coli culture, 1.5 mg of MoeA/liter of E. coli culture, and 13.3 mg of MogA/liter of E. coli culture. To show the functionality of R. capsulatus MoeA and MogA, Moco was produced from MPT in vitro and inserted into human aposulfite oxidase following the procedure described by Nichols and Rajagopalan (8Nichols J. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 7817-7822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) for E. coli MoeA and MogA. In contrast to the E. coli proteins, for which maximum human sulfite oxidase reconstitution was observed using a MogA/MoeA ratio of 1:10, the best human sulfite oxidase reconstitution was obtained when R. capsulatus MogA and MoeA where used in a ratio of at least 1:1.4 (data not shown). Thus, for all further assays, R. capsulatus MogA and MoeA were mixed in a 1:1 ratio. To test the functionality of R. capsulatus MobA, its ability to produce MGD from either MPT or Moco in the presence of MgGTP was analyzed. Moco was extracted from hSO-MD expressed in E. coli TP1000 cells (25Temple C.A. Graf T.N. Rajagopalan K.V. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 383: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), whereas MPT was obtained from hSO-MD expressed in RK5202(modC-) cells (26Miller J.B. Scott D.J. Amy N.K. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 1853-1860Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After the addition of MgGTP to the incubation mixture, MGD was formed only from Moco (Fig. 1B, bars II and IV). Bound MPT and the remaining Moco eluted in the Moco/MPT fraction (bars I and III). These results show that molybdenum insertion into MPT has to precede MGD formation. Thus, for all further experiments, Moco was used as a precursor for the formation of MGD. Analysis of Protein-Protein Interactions by SPR Measurements—To identify possible protein-protein interactions between XdhC, MogA, MoeA, and MobA, SPR measurements were employed for real-time detection of specific interactions using the purified proteins. XdhC, MoeA, MogA, and MobA were immobilized via amine coupling to a CM5 chip, and interactions were analyzed with each protein partner. The results obtained by SPR measurements for the protein pairs listed in Table 1 showed the tightest interaction between MoeA and XdhC, with KD values of 1.45 and 1.15 μm depending on the immobilized protein. In contrast, no significant interaction between XdhC and MogA was obtained with either immobilized protein partner, whereas in another set of experiments, MoeA bound to MogA with KD values of 6.2 and 6.0 μm (Table 1). However, this also shows that XdhC preferentially interacts with MoeA and not with MogA. The interaction between MoeA and MobA was also investigated. When MoeA was immobilized, MobA interacted with a KD of 3.5 μm, whereas when MobA was immobilized, the KD was significantly higher (27 μm) (Table 1). The second value for immobilized MobA shows that the dissociation constant between both proteins was negatively influenced by the immobilization of MobA. Because both XdhC and MobA interacted with MoeA and might compete for the same binding site, a possible interaction between XdhC and MobA was also investigated. As shown in Table 1, an interaction between both proteins was identified with KD values of 1.75 and 1.04 μm for immobilized XdhC and MobA, respectively. In contrast to the MoeA-MobA interaction, the dissociation constant for this protein pair was not influenced by the immobilization of MobA, showing that MobA was immobilized in a functional form, partly impairing the binding site for MoeA.TABLE 1Analysis of protein-protein interactions between MobA, MoeA, MogA, and XdhC by SPR measurementsImmobilized proteinaProteins were immobilized via amine coupling (see “Experimental Procedures”)RUbRU, resonance units; ND, none detectableProtein partnercProteins were injected using the KINJECT protocol, injecting samples in a concentration range of 0.1–6.4 μm.

Additional control experiments were performed to exclude a possible influence of the N-terminal His6 tags fused to MoeA, MogA, and MobA on the dissociation constants. For this purpose, the His6 tags of MogA, MoeA, and MobA were cleaved by thrombin treatment, and the interaction of these proteins with immobilized XdhC was compared with the sensograms obtained for the His6-tagged proteins.

The post-transcriptional regulation occurs at the trans-Golgi network (TGN). We identified two tripeptides in human RS1 (Gln-Cys-Pro (QCP) and Gln-Ser-Pro (QSP)) that induce posttranscriptional down-regulation of SGLT1 at the TGN leading to 40–50% reduction of SGLT1 in plasma membrane. For effective intracellular concentrations IC50 values of 2.0 nm (QCP) and 0.16 nm (QSP) were estimated. Down-regulation of SGLT1 by tripeptides was attenuated by intracellular monosaccharides including non-metabolized methyl-α-d-glucopyranoside and 2-deoxyglucose. In small intestine post-transcriptional regulation of SGLT1 may contribute to glucose-dependent regulation of liver metabolism and intestinal mobility. QCP and QSP are transported by the H+-peptide cotransporter PepT1 that is colocated with SGLT1 in small intestinal enterocytes. Using coexpression of SGLT1 and PepT1 in Xenopus oocytes or polarized Caco-2 cells that contain both transporters we demonstrated that the tripeptides were effective when applied to the extracellular compartment. After a 1-h perfusion of intact rat small intestine with QSP, glucose absorption was reduced by 30%. The data indicate that orally applied tripeptides can be used to down-regulate small intestinal glucose absorption, e.g. in diabetes mellitus.

RSC1A1 is an intronless single copy gene that was only detected in mammals and codes for 67–68-kDa proteins in human, pig, rabbit, and mouse that exhibit about 70% amino acid identity.

Neurochem. 1997; 69: 84-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In LLC-PK1 cells RS1 was located to the intracellular side of the plasma membrane, at the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and within the nucleus (30Kroiss M. Leyerer M. Gorboulev V. Kühlkamp T. Kipp H. Koepsell H. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 291: F1201-F1212Google Scholar). Importantly, the amount and distribution of RS1 were dependent on the state of confluence (30Kroiss M. Leyerer M. Gorboulev V. Kühlkamp T. Kipp H. Koepsell H. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 291: F1201-F1212Google Scholar). Whereas subconfluent LLC-PK1 cells contained large amounts of RS1 protein and exhibited pronounced nuclear location of RS1, the amount of RS1 was decreased in confluent LLC-PK1 cells and RS1 did not distribute into nuclei (30Kroiss M. Leyerer M. Gorboulev V. Kühlkamp T. Kipp H. Koepsell H. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 291: F1201-F1212Google Scholar). The observed changes in distribution correlated with functional data showing that RS1 down-regulates the transcription of SGLT1 in subconfluent LLC-PK1 cells (25Korn T. Kühlkamp T. Track C.

In Xenopus oocytes, expression of SGLT1 was inhibited when human RS1 was coexpressed (23Veyhl M. Spangenberg J. Püschel B. Poppe R. Dekel C. Fritzsch G. Haase W. Koepsell H. J. Biol.

Gorboulev V. Vernaleken A. Koepsell H. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 291: F1213-F1223Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). This indicated that hSGLT1 was inhibited by hRS1 on the posttranscriptional level. We showed that this posttranscriptional inhibition occurred within 30 min and was due to blockage of the release of SGLT1 containing vesicles from the TGN (21Veyhl M. Keller T. Gorboulev V. Vernaleken A. Koepsell H. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 291: F1213-F1223Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 30Kroiss M. Leyerer M. Gorboulev V. Kühlkamp T. Kipp H. Koepsell H. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 291: F1201-F1212Google Scholar). This posttranscriptional down-regulation of SGLT1 by RS1 was increased by PKC and modulated by intracellular methyl-α-d-glucopyranoside (AMG) (21Veyhl M. Keller T. Gorboulev V. Vernaleken A. Koepsell H. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 291: F1213-F1223Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Interestingly RS1 was found to be associated with a 28-kDa protein called the IRIP protein that is up-regulated in kidneys after ischemia and reperfusion (31Jiang W. Prokopenko O. Wong L. Inouye M. Mirochnitchenko O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 6496-6508Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The physiological and potential biomedical importance of RS1 was demonstrated by targeted disruption of the Rsc1A1 gene in mice (26Osswald C. Baumgarten K. Stümpel F. Gorboulev V. Akimjanova M. Knobeloch K.-P. Horak I. Kluge R. Joost H.-G. Koepsell H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 78-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Mice without RS1 showed an increased amount of SGLT1 protein in small intestinal brush-border membranes that was correlated with an increased capacity for small intestinal glucose absorption. Furthermore, mice without RS1 developed an obese phenotype. In the present study we tried to identify the domain of human RS1 (hRS1) that is responsible for inhibition of the release of SGLT1 containing vesicles from TGN. Two tripeptides of hRS1 were identified that are high affinity inhibitors of hSGLT1 at the TGN. Down-regulation of hSGLT1 by the tripeptides was modulated by intracellular monosaccharides including AMG that is not metabolized, and 2-deoxyglucose, which does not interact with hSGLT1. We showed that the tripeptides are substrates of the small intestinal peptide transporters PepT1 (32Daniel H. Kottra G. Pflügers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2004; 447: 610-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar) and that they were capable to down-regulate SGLT1 in rat small intestine after application to the intestinal lumen. Male rats (Wistar, Crl:WI) purchased from Charles River (Sulzfeld, Germany) were housed in groups of 3–4 animals in makrolon cages with free access to Standard Diet 3433 (Provimi Kliba, Kaiseraugst, Switzerland) and drinking water. The animals were kept under 12-h light/dark cycle at room temperature of 22 ± 2 °C and a relative humidity of 45–75%. Body weight at the day of surgery was 473 ± 17 g (n = 7). Xenopus laevis frogs were obtained from Nasco (Ft. Atkinson, WI). Animals were handled in compliance with institutional guidelines and German laws. Methyl-α-d-[14C]glucopyranoside ([14C]AMG, 11.7 GBq/mmol) was obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Botulinum toxin B (BTXB) and Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) were supplied by Sigma. Brefeldin A (BFA) was obtained from Calbiochem (Schwalbach, Germany), protein G conjugated with horseradish peroxidase from Bio-Rad, and prestained molecular weight markers from MBI Fermentas (St. Leon-Rot, Germany).

The peptide with the C-terminal cysteine was coupled to ovalbumin with m-maleimidobenzoyl-N-hydroxysuccimide ester. Affinity purification of the antisera was performed on the antigenic peptide coupled to polyacrylamide beads by using the Sulfolink kit from Pierce. The specificity of the antibody was verified by Western blots on cells that were transfected with hSGLT1 and by immunohistochemistry on human small intestine. Variants of hRS1 were made on the basis of wild type hRS1 cloned into ApaI and XhoI sites of the oocyte expression vector pRSSP (21Veyhl M. Keller T. Gorboulev V. Vernaleken A. Koepsell H. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 291: F1213-F1223Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Variant 1–251—PCR was performed using pRSSP plasmid-specific forward primer and a reverse primer at the corresponding position of hRS1 containing stop codon and the XhoI restriction site. The amplificate was digested with ApaI and XhoI and inserted into pRSSP vector. Variants 326–617, 407–617, and 534–617—PCR was performed using pRSSP plasmid-specific reverse primer and forward primers at corresponding positions of hRS1. Forward primers were provided with initiation codon and ApaI site. After ApaI/XhoI digestion isolated fragments were inserted into the pRSSP vector. Variants 350–425 and 396–425—PCR was performed using primers to the corresponding positions of hRS1. Forward primers contained initiation codon and ApaI site, whereas reverse primers contained stop codon and the XhoI site. PCR amplified fragments were cloned into ApaI/XhoI-digested pRSSP vector. Variant 251–617—Plasmid pRSSP/hRS1 was cut with ApaI, the adaptor ApaI/ClaI containing the initiation codon was added, and digestion with ClaI was performed to remove excess ligated adaptor and to cut hRS1 at the ClaI site of the coding region. The 5′ terminal fragment of hRS1 was removed and the plasmid was self-ligated resulting in construct 251–617. Variant 251–488—Variant 251–617 was cut with Eco81I and XhoI, the 5′ overhangs were filled in using Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I, and the adaptor SpeI provided with the stop codon was added. After ligation the mixture was digested with SpeI to remove excess ligated adaptor, the 3′ terminal fragment of hRS1 was removed, and the plasmid was self-ligated resulting in construct 251–488. Variant 407–415—Two complementary phosphorylated oligonucleotides were designed to cover the desired region of hRS1: 5′-pCATGCAGAATGAACAGTGTCCACAAGTCTCATGAC-3′ and 5′-pTCGAGTCATGAGACTTGTGGACACTGTTCATTCTGCATGGGCC-3′. The oligonucleotides contained the initiation and stop codon (bold letters) and were provided with ApaI and XhoI cohesive ends (underlined). The oligonucleotides were annealed and ligated into ApaI/XhoI-digested pRSSP vector. All PCR-derived parts of the truncated variants were sequenced to rule out PCR errors. For solid phase synthesis of N-acetylated and nonacetylated peptides we employed the Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) strategy in a fully automated synthesizer (ABI 433, Applied Biosystems, Weiterstadt Germany) (35Merrifield R.B.

Peptide chain assembly was performed using in situ activation of amino acid building blocks by 2-(1H-benzotriazole-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate. Peptides were purified by preparative HPLC on Kromasil 100-10-C18 reverse phase columns using linear gradients of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water and 80% acetonitrile in water as eluents. The purified material was lyophilized and characterized with analytical HPLC and laser desorption mass spectrometry (Reflex II, Bruker, Bremen Germany). For injection into X. laevis oocytes m7G(5′)G-capped cRNA was prepared, purified, and stored as described earlier (23Veyhl M. Spangenberg J. Püschel B. Poppe R. Dekel C. Fritzsch G. Haase W.

Chem. 1995; 270: 6456-6463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar), the respective purified plasmids were linearized with EcoRI (hSGLT1), NotI (hPepT1), or MluI (hRS1 and hRS1 fragments). cRNA was synthesized using T3 polymerase (hSGLT1), SP6 polymerase (hRS1, fragments of hRS1), or T7 polymerase (hPepT1) as described earlier (27Veyhl M. Wagner C.A. Gorboulev V. Schmitt B.M. Lang F. Koepsell H. J. Membr. Biol. 2003; 196: 71-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). cRNAs were prepared employing the “mMESSAGE mMACHINE” kit (Ambion) using sodium acetate precipitation. cRNA concentrations were estimated from ethidium bromide-stained agarose gels using polynucleotide marker as standards. Mature female X. laevis were anesthetized by immersion in fresh water containing 0.1% 3-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester. Oocytes at the stages V and VI were obtained by partial ovariectomy and treated overnight with 1 mg ml-1 collagenase I in Ori buffer (5 mm HEPES-Tris, pH 7.6, 110 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm CaCl2). The oocytes were washed twice with Ca2+-free Ori buffer and kept at 16 °C in modified Barth's solution (15 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 88 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 0.3 mm Ca(NO3)2, 0.4 mm CaCl2, 0.8 mm MgSO4) containing 12.5 μg ml-1 gentamycin. Selected oocytes were injected with 25 nl of water containing cRNAs (2.5 ng of hSGLT1, 10 ng of hPepT1, 7.5 ng of hRS1 or fragments of hRS1). For expression, injected oocytes were kept for 3 days at 16 °C in modified Barth's solution with gentamycin. Non-injected oocytes served as controls. In some experiments PKC was stimulated by incubation of the oocytes for 2 min with 1 μm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). Three days after cRNA injections into oocytes before flux experiments were started, 25 nl of K-Ori buffer (5 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 100 mm KCl, 3 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2) containing peptides, 0.5 pmol of sn-1,2-dioctanoylglycerol (stimulation of PKC), 2 ng of BTXB (inhibition of exocytosis), and/or 0.5 pmol of BFA (inhibition of vesicle budding from the TGN) were injected. Oocytes were incubated for 1 h at room temperature in Ori buffer and tracer uptake measurements were performed. To investigate the influence of intracellular monosaccachride on tripeptide-dependent down-regulation of hSGLT1, different concentrations of sugars or polyacohols with or without 75 pmol tripeptides were injected into hSGLT1 expressing oocytes 1 h before uptake measurements were started. Intracellular concentrations of injected compounds were estimated by assuming an internal distribution volume of 0.4 μl (38Zeuthen T. Zeuthen E. Klaerke D.A. J. Physiol. 2002; 542: 71-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). For AMG uptake measurements, hSGLT1 expressing oocytes or non-cRNA-injected control oocytes were incubated for 15 min at room temperature in Ori buffer containing 1.75 or 50 μm [14C]AMG. Oocytes were washed four times in ice-cold Ori buffer containing 1 mm phlorizin, and single oocytes were solubilized in 5% (w/v) SDS and analyzed for radioactivity by scintillation counting. Uptake of [14C]AMG was corrected for uptake measured in non-cRNA-injected control oocytes. Parallel measurements of membrane current (Im) and membrane capacitance (Cm) were performed using an EPC-05 amplifier controlled by PULSE and X-Chart software provided by HEKA Electronics (Lambrecht, Germany). Im measurements were performed using the two-electrode voltage clamp method and Cm was measured using a previously described paired ramps approach (39Schmitt B.M. Koepsell H. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 1345-1357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). For Im and Cm measurements in oocytes expressing hSGLT1, oocytes were superfused at room temperature with Ori buffer and clamped to -50 mV. For Im measurements in oocytes expressing hPepT1, oocytes were superfused with modified Barth's solution adjusted to pH 6.5, and clamped to -60 mV. The cell line Caco-2 was acquired from the German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures (Braunschweig, Germany). Cells were grown on Petri dishes (37 °C, 5% CO2) in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 25 mm d-glucose. Nine days after reaching confluence cells were detached by incubation with DPBS containing 0.5 mm EDTA and 20 mm d-glucose, collected by 10-min centrifugation at 1000 × g, and washed with DPBS containing 20 mm d-glucose (DPBS-G). To test effects of tripeptides, cells were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in DPBS-G that was adjusted to pH 6.5. Incubation at pH 6.5 was performed in the absence and presence of tripeptides. Before transport measurements were started cells were washed two times with DPBS. For uptake measurements cells were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C in DPBS containing 50 μm [14C]AMG or 50 μm [14C]AMG plus 0.5 mm phlorizin. Uptake was terminated by the addition of ice-cold DPBS containing 1 mm phlorizin (stop solution). Cells were washed 3 times with stop solution, solubilized, and analyzed for radioactivity. For each experiment, five measurements were performed per experimental condition. A modified version of a previously described perfusion model was used (40Wang Y. Aun R. Tse F.L.S. Pharm. Res. 1997; 14: 1563-1567Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Fasted male rats were anesthetized with pentobarbital (Narcoren, Merial GmbH, Halbergmoos, Germany, 60 mg/kg intraperitoneal). Their body temperature was maintained with a heated pad. Following a laparotomy, a 25-cm long segment of the small intestine starting 1 cm distally of the stomach was isolated and cannulated at both ends. For pretreatment with tripeptide, the small intestinal segments were perfused for 1 h (recirculating system, 4 ml/min, 38 °C) with DPBS, pH 6.5. The perfusion was performed in the absence and presence of 15 mm QSP. Thereafter, perfusion was switched to single pass perfusion with DPBS (pH 7.4, 38 °C) containing 10 μm d-glucose, and after 20 min to DPBS containing 50 μm d-glucose. Intestinal efflux samples were collected at 2.5-min intervals. d-Glucose determination in the efflux samples was performed using the Amplex® Red Glucose GO assay kit (Invitrogen) adapted for measurements of low d-glucose concentrations. Non-injected oocytes and oocytes injected with hSGLT1 cRNA were incubated for 3 days and oocytes without follicular epithelial cells were selected. hSGLT1 expressing oocytes were injected with 25 nl of K-Ori buffer without and with 75 pmol of acetylated QCP (QCPac) and kept for 1 h at room temperature in modified Barth's solution. Thereafter oocytes were incubated for 15 min at room temperature in Ori buffer containing 50 μm AMG, and washed twice with Ori buffer. Isolation of plasma membranes from oocytes was performed as described (41Kamsteeg E.-J. Deen P.M.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 282: 683-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). For each experimental condition experiments were performed with 10 oocytes. Defolliculated oocytes were rotated for 30 min at 4 °C in MES buffer (20 mm MES, pH 6.0, 80 mm NaCl) containing 1% (w/v) colloidal silica (Ludox Cl from Sigma). Then oocytes were washed two times with MES buffer, rotated 30 min at 4 °C in MES buffer containing 0.1% polyacrylic acid (Sigma), and washed two times with Ori buffer. Oocytes were homogenized in 1.5 ml of homogenization buffer (HbA) (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm NaH2PO4, 1 mm EDTA, 80 mm sucrose) and centrifuged at 10 × g for 1 min at 4 °C. 1.3 ml of the top of the sample was removed, 1 ml of HbA buffer was added, and the sample was mixed. Centrifugation, removal of 1 ml from the top, addition of 1 ml of HbA buffer, and mixing were repeated 4 times but the centrifugation was performed twice at 10 × g, once at 20 × g, and once at 40 × g. After the last step, plasma membranes were spun down by a 30-min centrifugation at 16,000 × g (4 °C). The resulting pellet was resuspended in 4 μl/oocyte of sample buffer for SDS-PAGE (SDS-PAGE sample buffer: 60 mm Tris HCl, pH 6.8, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 2% (w/v) SDS, and 7% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1% (w/v) bromphenol blue). Protein concentration was determined according to Bradford (42Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217548) Google Scholar). For SDS-PAGE, membrane protein samples were pretreated for 45 min at 37 °C in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Electrophoresis and Western blotting were performed as described (33Valentin M. Kühlkamp T.

However, little is known of the metabolism and disposition of chlorotyrosine in vivo. Following infusion of deuterium-labeled [D4]chlorotyrosine into Sprague-Dawley rats, the major urinary metabolites were identified by mass spectrometry. 3-Chloro-4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid was identified as the major chlorinated metabolite of chlorotyrosine and accounted for 3.6 ± 0.3% of infused [D4]chlorotyrosine. The striking observation was that ∼40% (39 ± 1%) of infused [D4]chlorotyrosine was dechlorinated and excreted in the urine as deuterated 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid, a major metabolite of tyrosine. 1.1 ± 0.1% of infused [D4]chlorotyrosine was excreted as [D4]tyrosine. To determine whether protein-bound chlorotyrosine could undergo dechlorination, chlorinated albumin was incubated with liver homogenate from mutant rats, which did not synthesize albumin.

Myeloperoxidase catalyzes the formation of hypochlorous acid, a potent chlorinating reagent, from hydrogen peroxide and chloride anion. In turn, hypochlorous acid can react with nitrite to form nitryl chloride (3Eiserich J.P. Hristova M. Cross C.E. Jones A.D. Freeman B.A. Halliwell B. van der Vliet A.

Hypochlorous acid and nitryl chloride can react with tyrosyl residues in proteins to form chlorotyrosine and nitrotyrosine, respectively (3Eiserich J.P. Hristova M. Cross C.E. Jones A.D.

Thus, the measurement of chlorotyrosine has been extensively used to assess the formation of MPO-derived hypochlorous acid in vivo (5Hazen S.L. Heinecke J.W. J. Clin.

However, one of the major disadvantages of measuring chlorotyrosine or nitrotyrosine is that modified proteins may undergo rapid catabolism (10Souza J.M. Choi I. Chen Q. Weisse M. Daikhin E.

Biophys. 2000; 380: 360-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), and the resulting free chlorotyrosine or nitrotyrosine are taken up by cells, metabolized, and excreted. Thus, it is well established that nitrotyrosine is metabolized to 3-nitro-4-hydroxy-phenylacetic acid (nitro-HPA), which is the major urinary metabolite (11Ohshima H. Friesen M. Brouet I. Bartsch H.

It is well recognized that pathways exist for the dehalogenation of iodotyrosine to form tyrosine in vivo (13Roche J. Michel R. Michel O. Lissitzky S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1952; 9: 161-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), and historically this pathway has been assumed to exist for the conservation of iodine. Iodotyrosine dehalogenase, which catalyzes the deiodination of iodotyrosine to tyrosine and iodide, was characterized over 50 years ago (13Roche J. Michel R. Michel O. Lissitzky S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1952; 9: 161-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This enzyme has recently been cloned (DEHAL1) and is expressed in the thyroid gland and other organs including the liver and kidney (14Moreno J.C. van der Hout C. Klootwijk W. Visser T.J. Horm. Res. (Basel). 2006; 65: 31PubMed Google Scholar). It is well known that DEHAL1 has a nitroreductase domain and can catalyze the deiodination of both mono- and di-iodotyrosine (15Moreno J.C. Horm. Res.

We postulated that chlorotyrosine released during proteolysis may undergo dechlorination to form tyrosine, either in a reaction catalyzed by DEHAL1 or through an alternative pathway. The aim of this study was to identify the major urinary metabolites of chlorotyrosine and to determine whether chlorotyrosine undergoes dechlorination in vivo. Chemicals—All chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich unless stated otherwise. [13C9]Tyrosine, [D4]tyrosine, [D4]acetic acid, D2O, and deuterium chloride (2HCl) were purchased from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories (Andover, MA). Animals—Male Sprague-Dawley rats (270–300 g) were obtained from the Comparative Biology Unit at University College, London. Snap frozen liver tissues from male Nagase ananlbuminemic rats (NAR) were used to study the dechlorination of chlorinated albumin. Systemic inflammation was induced by intraperitoneal injection of lipopolysaccharide (Salmonella typhimurium, 1 mg/kg) and animals sacrificed at 24 h under pentobarbital anesthesia. Animal procedures were in accordance with the Home Office, UK guidelines. Synthesis of Deuterium-labeled Compounds—[D4]Chlorotyrosine, [D5]chloro-HPA, and [D6]HPA were synthesized by deuterium exchange as described (12Mani A.R. Pannala A.S. Orie N.N. Ollosson R. Harry D.

Acta. 1978; 83: 259-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) using 50 mg of either chlorotyrosine, chloro-HPA, or HPA as starting material. The resulting products were dissolved in 0.1% (v/v) TFA/water (adjusted to pH 5.0 with ammonia solution) and extracted on an LC18 reverse-phase column, pre-washed with 2 ml of methanol and 5 ml of 0.1% (v/v) TFA/water (pH 5.0). The products were washed with water, and the deuterated products eluted with 4 ml of 30% (v/v) methanol in water. The products were purified further by thin-layer chromatography (12Mani A.R. Pannala A.S. Orie N.N. Ollosson R. Harry D. Rice-Evans C.A. Moore K.P. Biochem. J. 2003; 374: 521-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and their concentrations determined against known amounts of unlabeled standards by GC/MS (see below). Synthesis of 13C-labeled Internal Standard for Measurement of Chlorotyrosine, HPA, and Chloro-HPA—[13C8]3-chlorotyrosine was synthesized by reaction of [13C9]tyrosine with sodium hypochlorite (4% solution) at room temperature for 1 h followed by solid phase extraction. The products were purified using high pressure liquid chromatography as described (12Mani A.R. Pannala A.S. Orie N.N. Ollosson R. Harry D. Rice-Evans C.A. Moore K.P. Biochem. J. 2003; 374: 521-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). [13C8]HPA was synthesized following the deamination and decarboxylation of [13C9]tyrosine using Taiwan cobra venom as described previously (12Mani A.R. Pannala A.S. Orie N.N. Ollosson R. Harry D. Rice-Evans C.A. Moore K.P. Biochem. J. 2003; 374: 521-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). [13C8]Chloro-HPA was synthesized in the same way as chlorotyrosine, and the concentrations of 13C-labeled standards determined against known amounts of unlabeled standards by GC/MS. Synthesis of Chlorinated Albumin—Human serum albumin was dissolved in 0.1 m phosphate buffered saline (PBS) to give a final concentration of 10 mg/ml, and sodium hypochlorite solution was added to give a final concentration of 0.4% and left for 1 h at room temperature. Chlorinated albumin was dialyzed against PBS for 48 h. Measurement of Chlorotyrosine and Tyrosine by GC/MS— 13C-Labeled internal standard (5 ng) was added to 20 μlofrat urine and diluted to 1 ml of total volume with 0.1% (v/v) TFA/water (pH 5.0). The samples were extracted using LC18 reversephase column as described above. Chlorotyrosine and tyrosine were derivatized with ethyl heptafluorobutyrate and silylated with tert-butyldimethylsilyl as described (18Frost M.T. Halliwell B. Moore K.P. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 453-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 19Gaut J.P. Byun J. Tran H.D. Heinecke J.W. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 300: 252-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Derivatized samples were dried under nitrogen and redissolved in 20 μlof n-undecane. Samples were applied to a GC equipped with a 15-m DB-1701 (J&W Scientific, Folsom, CA) capillary column (0.25-mm internal diameter, 0.25-mm film thickness) interfaced with a mass spectrometer (Trio 1000; Fisons Instruments, Beverly, MA). The ion source and interface temperatures were set at 200 and 320 °C, respectively. Samples were analyzed in negative-ion chemical ionization mode with ammonia as the reagent gas, using 1 μl of each sample for injection. The initial column temperature was maintained at 150 °C for 1 min increasing to 300 °C at 20 °C/min. Ions were monitored at 489, 493, and 498 mass units for authentic, [D4] and [13C9]chlorotyrosine, respectively. For measurement of tyrosine, samples were monitored at 407, 411, and 339 m/z for authentic, [D4] and [13C9]tyrosine, respectively. Concentrations were calculated by ratio to known 13C9-labeled internal standards. Measurement of Chloro-HPA and HPA by GC/MS—13C-Labeled internal standard (5 ng) was added to 20 μl of rat urine and diluted to 1 ml with 0.1% (v/v) TFA/water (pH 5.0). The samples were extracted using LC18 reverse-phase column as described above. The samples were derivatized to the pentafluorobenzyl ester by the addition of 20 μl of di-isopropyl ethylamine in acetonitrile and 40 ml of 10% (v/v) pentafluorobenzyl bromide in acetonitrile for 1 h at room temperature (21–23 °C), dried under nitrogen, and redissolved in 20 ml of n-undecane for GC/MS analysis (12Mani A.R.

The GC/MS set up was as described above, and ions were monitored at 365, 369, and 373 mass units for authentic, [D] and [13 4 C8]chloro-HPA, respectively, with single-ion monitoring. For measuring HPA samples were monitored at 331, 335, and 339 mass units for authentic, [D4] and [13C8]HPA, respectively. The concentrations were calculated from the known 13C8-labeled internal standards. Metabolism of Chlorotyrosine in Vivo Studies—A similar method used by Ohshima et al. (11Ohshima H. Friesen M. Brouet I. Bartsch H. Food Chem. Toxicol. 1990; 28: 647-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) was used for identification of urinary metabolites of chlorotyrosine. To obtain enough material for GC/MS analysis, male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 3 in each group) were given drinking water containing either chlorotyrosine or tyrosine at a concentration of 1 mg/ml for 24 h, and urine was collected in metabolic cages for this period. Urine samples were acidified to pH 1.0 with HCl and extracted with an equivalent volume of ethyl acetate. The concentrated extracts were derivatized to the pentafluorobenzyl ester by the addition of 20 μl of di-isopropyl ethylamine in acetonitrile and 40 ml of 10% (v/v) pentafluorobenzyl bromide in acetonitrile for 1 h at room temperature (21–23 °C), dried under nitrogen, and redissolved in 20 ml of n-undecane for full scan GC/MS analysis. Dechlorination of Chlorotyrosine in Vivo Studies—Male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into four groups (n = 4 in each group), which were given a single intraperitoneal injection of [D4]chlorotyrosine, [D4]tyrosine, or [D5]chloro-HPA or [D6]HPA (0.50 μmol). The animals then were transferred to standard metabolic cages, and urine samples were collected for 24 h. The levels of deuterated chlorotyrosine, tyrosine, chloro-HPA, and HPA were measured in the collected urine samples as described above. To determine whether the observed dechlorination of chlorotyrosine was dependent on a cytochrome P450, one group of rats (n = 3) were pre-treated with 1-aminobenzotriazole (50 mg/kg) to block cytochrome P450 activity at 24 and 4 h before the intraperitoneal injection of 0.50 μmol [D4]chlorotyrosine (20Garner C.E. Sumner S.C. Davis J.G. Burgess J.P. Yueh Y. Remeter J. Zhan Q. Valentine J. Jeffcoat A.R. Burka L.T. Mathews J.M. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 2006; 215: 23-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Urine was collected over 24 h and analyzed as above. Dechlorination of Chlorotyrosine in Cultured Hepatoblastoma (HepG2) Cells—HepG2 cells (ECACC, Wiltshire, UK) were maintained in α-minimum Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum as described previously (21Mavri-Damelin D. Eaton S. Damelin L.H. Rees M. Hodgson H.J. Selden C. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2007; 39: 555-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Mono-layer HepG2 cells were plated in 175 cm3 vented tissue culture flasks plates until ∼70% confluent when they were incubated with either [D4]chlorotyrosine or [D4]tyrosine (final concentration 10 μm in α-minimum Eagle's medium). 24 h after incubation with either [D4]chlorotyrosine or [D4]tyrosine, cells were washed two times with PBS and were detached from the flask using a cell scraper. Detached cells were washed and resuspended in 2 ml of PBS. Cell suspensions were divided into two parts. The first part was sonicated, and the supernatant was used for measuring [D4]chlorotyrosine and [D4]tyrosine as described above. The second part was subjected to protein precipitation by addition of 1 ml of ice-cold chloroformmethanol (2:1, v/v) solution. After centrifugation (1000 × g for 20 min), protein precipitates were washed with methanol and lyophilized under vacuum for assessment of protein-bound [D4]chlorotyrosine and [D4]tyrosine as described (18Frost M.T. Halliwell B. Moore K.P. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 453-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 19Gaut J.P. Byun J. Tran H.D. Heinecke J.W. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 300: 252-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Each experiment was repeated four times (n = 4). Dechlorination of Chlorinated Albumin by Liver Homogenate in Vitro—To determine whether protein-bound chlorotyrosine was a substrate for dechlorination on an intact protein, chlorinated albumin was incubated with liver homogenates obtained from mutant rats, which lacked albumin (NAR rats) (22Nagase S. Shimamune K. Shumiya S. Science. 1979; 205: 590-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). This allows us to quantitate chlorinated and dechlorinated albumin without contamination from endogenously synthesized albumin. Added albumin was separated from other proteins in liver homogenates by electrophoresis. In brief, snap-frozen liver from analbuminemic rats was homogenized in PBS (1:10, w/v) containing protease inhibitors (anti-protease mixture; Roche Diagnostics) and a mixture of cofactors including NADH, NADPH, FAD, and FMN (200 μm final concentration). 50 μlof liver homogenate was incubated with 50 μl of chlorinated albumin (10 mg/ml) in a circulating water bath (37 °C). After 1-h incubation, the reaction was stopped by adding 100 μl of lysis buffer containing SDS (20%), 2-mercaptoethanol (25 μl/ml), and bromphenol blue (10 μl/ml) in Tris buffer (pH 7.4). 10 μlof the mixture was fractionated by SDS-PAGE. The gel was then stained with Coomassie Blue, and the albumin band (64 KDa) was cut out and subjected to hydrolysis using 1 ml of NaOH (4 m) for 15 h. To quantify the level of chlorotyrosine and tyrosine, isotopic internal standards, [13C9]chlorotyrosine (100 ng), and [13C9]tyrosine (1 μg) were added to the samples prior to alkaline hydrolysis. Following two steps of solid phase extraction, chlorotyrosine and tyrosine were quantitated as described (18Frost M.T. Halliwell B. Moore K.P. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 453-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 19Gaut J.P. Byun J. Tran H.D. Heinecke J.W. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 300: 252-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Data are expressed as chlorotyrosine/tyrosine ratio. Each experiment was repeated four times (n = 4). Interaction of Chlorotyrosine and DEHAL1 in Vitro— DEHAL1 was obtained form HEK293 cells transfected with DEHAL1 cDNA (14Moreno J.C. van der Hout C. Klootwijk W. Visser T.J. Horm. Res. (Basel). 2006; 65: 31PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether chlorotyrosine inhibited or activated DEHAL1, deiodinase activity was measured by radioimmunoassay based on radioiodide formation from [125I]iodotyrosine. Incubation mixtures contained [125I]iodotyrosine (∼100,000 cpm mixed with 0.1 μm unlabeled iodotyrosine), DEHAL1 enzyme, and varying amounts of chlorotyrosine (0.01–100 μm final concentration) in 100 μlofPBS containing NADPH (100 μm), EDTA (2 mm), and dithiothreitol (10 mm). Mixtures were incubated in duplicate for 60 min at 37 °C, and the reactions were stopped by addition of 0.9 ml of 10% acetic acid on ice. The radioiodide in the mixture was separated from remaining [125I]iodotyrosine with ion exchange chromatography on Dowex columns. The columns were washed with 10% acetic acid and eluted with 8 ml of 1 mm ammonia solution. Blank incubations without enzyme were used to correct for non-enzymatic deiodination. To determine whether chlorotyrosine could act as a substrate of DEHAL1, varying amounts of chlorotyrosine (0.01–100 μm) were incubated with DEHAL1 in 100 μl of PBS containing NADPH (100 μm), EDTA (2 mm), and dithiothreitol (10 mm). Mixtures were then incubated in triplicate for 60 min at 37 °C, and the reaction was stopped by addition of 1 ml of 10% acetic acid on ice. The level of chlorotyrosine was then measured using GC/MS as described above. Statistical Analysis—The data are expressed as mean ± S.E. Student's t test was applied to compare the means, and p values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Where appropriate, a non-parametric test was used for statistical analysis. Structural Confirmation of Chlorotyrosine by GC/MS—For GC/MS analysis of chlorotyrosine and tyrosine the amine group was derivatized with ethyl heptafluorobutyrate, and the hydroxyl and carboxylic groups were silylated with tert-butyldimethylsilyl and the products analyzed by negative-ion chemical ionization mass spectrometry. Full scan mass spectra obtained for these molecules are shown in Fig. 1 (A and B). The major fragment ion for chlorotyrosine has a m/z of 489, which corresponds to loss of tert-butyldimethylsilyl and chloride. The major fragment ion of tyrosine is consistent with previously published data and corresponds to loss of O and tert-butyldimethylsilyl, which results in a dominant ion at m/z 407 (18Frost M.T. Halliwell B. Moore K.P. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 453-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Fig. 1C shows the mass spectrum of derivatized deuterium-labeled chlorotyrosine. Full scan analysis of derivatized deuterated chlorotyrosine showed that the synthesized compound had a dominant ion at m/z 493, which was 4 mass units heavier than the authentic chlorotyrosine and corresponded to [D4]chlorotyrosine. Structural Confirmation of Chloro-HPA and HPA by GC/MS— The structures of the pentafluorobenzyl ester derivatives of chloro-HPA and HPA are shown in Fig. 1 (D and E). Analysis of the pentafluorobenzyl ester derivatives of chloro-HPA and HPA by full scan mode showed that chloro-HPA had a dominant ion at m/z 365 (M-181, loss of one pentafluorobenzyl ester group). HPA has a dominant ion at m/z 331 M-181, which is also because of the loss of a pentafluorobenzyl ester group. On the basis of these results, all further work was focused on developing a method to quantitate both chloro-HPA and HPA using the pentafluorobenzyl ester derivative with selective ion monitoring at 365 and 331 mass units for chloro-HPA and HPA, respectively. Fig. 1F shows the mass spectrum of derivatized deuterium-labeled chloro-HPA. Analysis of the pentafluorobenzyl ester derivative of deuterated chloro-HPA by full scan mode showed that the synthesized compound had a dominant ion at m/z 370, which was 5 mass units heavier than the authentic chloro-HPA and corresponded to [D5]chloro-HPA. Metabolism of Chlorotyrosine—Analysis of urine extracts from rats drinking water containing chlorotyrosine showed one main additional peak on the GC compared with urine obtained from rats given tyrosine alone (Fig. 2). GC/MS analysis identified this peak as chloro-HPA (Figs. 1E and 2C). Following injection of 0.5 μmol [D4]chlorotyrosine, 3.6 ± 0.3% of the dose was excreted as [D4]chloro-HPA, and 0.9 ± 0.5% of infused chlorotyrosine was excreted in the urine unchanged (Fig. 3).FIGURE 3A, urinary excretion of deuterated chloro-HPA, HPA, chlorotyrosine, and tyrosine after intraperitoneal injection of [D4]chlorotyrosine or [D4]tyrosine in rats. B, urinary excretion of deuterated chloro-HPA, HPA, chlorotyrosine, and tyrosine after intraperitoneal injection of [D5]chloro-HPA or [D6]HPA in rats. C, chromatogram of a representative urine sample obtained from a rat injected with [D4]chlorotyrosine. In Vivo formation of dechlorinated end product [D4]HPA, represented as a distinguished peak, was detected with m/z 335. The values of m/z 331 and m/z 339 represent authentic HPA and 13C8-labeled internal standard, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Although chloro-HPA was observed as the major chlorinated metabolite present in urine of rats ingesting chlorotyrosine, compared with tyrosine-ingesting controls, when we followed the pathways of deuterated chlorotyrosine metabolism, we found that the major urinary metabolite observed was deuterated HPA. Because HPA is also a major metabolite of tyrosine metabolism (17Fell V. Hoskins J.A. Pollitt R.J. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1978; 83: 259-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), this peak was not evident when urinary samples in the drinking water of rats containing chlorotyrosine or tyrosine were compared. Thus, urinary HPA may be formed by metabolism of either chlorotyrosine or tyrosine. Almost 40% (39 ± 1%) of infused [D4] chlorotyrosine was excreted in the urine as [D4]HPA, and 1.1 ± 0.1% excreted as [D4]tyrosine (Fig. 3). When 0.5 μmol [D4]tyrosine was injected into rats, 41.5 ± 1% of the dose was excreted as [D4]HPA, and 0.9 ± 0.7% was excreted in the urine unchanged (i.e. similar to that obtained by injection of deuterated chlorotyrosine). To determine whether HPA undergoes further metabolism, we also injected 0.5 μmol [D6]HPA, and 94.3 ± 2.1% was recovered unchanged in urine within 24 h, indicative of little, if any, metabolism (Fig. 3B). However, 8.3 ± 0.6% of injected [D5]chloro-HPA was excreted as its dechlorinated metabolite ([D5]HPA), and 88.2 ± 1.4% was detected in 24-h urine samples unchanged (Fig. 3B). These data show that chloro-HPA can also serve as a substrate for dechlorination but is a poor substrate compared with chlorotyrosine. Rats pre-treated with 1-aminobenzotriazole, a potent inhibitor of cytochrome P450, showed the same quantitative pattern of [D4]HPA and [D4]chloro-HPA excretion compared with saline pre-treated rats following [D4]chlorotyrosine injection (data not shown), suggesting that metabolism by a cytochrome P450 enzyme is unlikely to be responsible for the dechlorination pathway. Dechlorination of Chlorotyrosine by HepG2 Cells—Because the liver is the most likely site of metabolism we incubated chlorotyrosine with cultured HepG2 cells, which contained most of the normal enzymes present in hepatocytes. Detectable amounts of [D4]tyrosine were observed in the cell fraction obtained form HepG2 cells following incubation with [D4]chlorotyrosine (Fig. 4). As shown in Table 1, ∼4% (4.3 ± 0.3) of incubated [D4]chlorotyrosine was incorporated into proteins as protein-bound [D4]tyrosine. Free [D4]tyrosine was also detectable in cell extracts (Fig. 4) but not the culture media following incubation with [D4]chlorotyrosine. Incubation of HepG2 cells with equimolar concentration (10 μm) of [D4]tyrosine was associated with incorporation of ∼24% of [D4]tyrosine into cellular proteins. A small fraction (∼0.5%) of incubated tyrosine was detected as free [D4]tyrosine in cell extracts (Table 1).TABLE 1The levels of free and protein-bound deuterated tyrosine and chlorotyrosine in cell lysates and media of HepG2 cells after 24-h incubation with [D4]chlorotyrosine or [D4]tyrosine (10 μm)Incubated amino acidMediumFree amino acid in cell fractionProtein-bound amino acid in cell fraction[D4]Cl-tyrosine[D4]tyrosine[D4]Cl-tyrosine[D4]tyrosine[D4]Cl-tyrosine[D4]tyrosineμmnmolnmol[D4]Chlorotyrosine8.2 ± 0.4 (82.5 ± 4.5%)0 ± 0 (0 ± 0%)0.9 ± 0.4 (0.3 ± 0.1%)1.1 ± 0.1 (0.4 ± 0.1%)0 ± 0 (0 ± 0%)13 ± 4 (4.3 ± 0.4%)[D4]Tyrosine0 ± 0 (0 ± 0%)7.1 ± 0.8 (71.4 ± 8.4%)0 ± 0 (0 ± 0%)2.2 ± 0.7 (0.5 ± 0.2%)0 ± 0 (0 ± 0%)111 ± 12 (23.6 ± 2.5%) Open table in a new tab Dechlorination of Chlorinated Albumin—GC/MS analysis of the hydrolysate of albumin following its reaction with hypochlorous acid showed that 6.2 ± 0.2% of tyrosine residues of albumin were chlorinated. To determine whether protein-bound chlorotyrosine could be dechlorinated, chlorinated albumin was incubated with liver tissue homogenates obtained from mutant rats, which lacked albumin (NAR) (22Nagase S. Shimamune K. Shumiya S. Science. 1979; 205: 590-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The liver from these rats was used to avoid interference from albumin formed by “normal liver”. Murad and colleagues (23Kamisaki Y. Wada K. Bian K. Balabanli B. Davis K. Martin E. Behbod F. Lee Y.C. Murad F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11584-11589Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 24Irie Y. Saeki M. Kamisaki Y. Martin E. Murad F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5634-5639Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) have observed that denitration of nitrotyrosine is up-regulated following induction of a systemic inflammatory response by injection of endotoxin; therefore we used both liver from analbuminemic rats as well as liver obtained 24 h after injection of endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide, 1 mg/kg). Thus, chlorinated albumin was incubated with either buffer alone, liver homogenate from analbuminemic rats, or liver homogenate from NAR rats injected with endotoxin. Fig. 5 shows the levels of protein-bound tyrosine, chlorotyrosine, and the chlorotyrosine to tyrosine ratio after GC/MS analysis of the hydrolyzed albumin band. Following incubation of chlorinated albumin with liver homogenate for 1 h there was a significant decrease in the chlorotyrosine/tyrosine ratio in both control and endotoxemic groups. The reduction in both chlorotyrosine content and the chlorotyrosine/tyrosine ratio was more prominent in the liver homogenate obtained from endotoxemic rats (Fig. 5). There was no statistical difference in tyrosine levels of the hydrolyzed albumin among the groups. Inhibition of DEHAL1-induced Deiodination by Chlorotyrosine— Chlorotyrosine inhibits iodotyrosine deiodinationinvitro in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6A). None of the other tested phenolic compounds (chloro-HPA and tyrosine) showed the ability to inhibit deiodination induced by DEHAL1. The Michaelis-Menten plot of the velocity of deiodination reaction in presence of chlorotyrosine is shown in Fig. 6B. At any given chlorotyrosine concentration (1 and 10 μm), enzyme inhibition could be overcome by increasing the substrate (iodotyrosine) concentration, consistent with reversible inhibition of DEHAL1 dehalogenase. We then tested the hypothesis that chlorotyrosine might serve as a substrate for DEHAL1 dehalogenase; however, DEHAL1 was unable to catalyze the dechlorination of chlorotyrosine. Indeed almost 100% of added chlorotyrosine could be recovered following incubation with DEHAL1 in the presence of its cofactors (Fig. 6C). During inflammation, neutrophil and monocyte-derived myeloperoxidase catalyze the formation of hypochlorous acid, which can chlorinate tyrosine residues in proteins to form chlorotyrosine. Chlorination of tyrosine decreases the pKa of the phenolic group from 10.1 to 8.3 (25Faleev N.G. Axenova O.V. Demidkina T.V. Phillips R.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1647: 260-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). This can lead to altered protein conformation and function in the same way that nitration of tyrosine can alter enzymatic activity or protein function (26Zheng L. Nukuna B. Brennan M.L. Sun M. Goormastic M. Settle M. Schmitt D. Fu X. Thomson L. Fox P.L. Ischiropoulos H. Smith J.D. Kinter M. Hazen S.L. J. Clin.

Our understanding on the fate of chlorinated proteins is limited to the assumption that chlorinated proteins undergo proteolysis to release free chlorotyrosine, which undergoes metabolism. Thus, it was attractive for us to identify the urinary metabolite(s) of chlorotyrosine to develop assays for the noninvasive assessment of chlorotyrosine formation in vivo. We and others have previously shown that the major urinary metabolite of nitrotyrosine is 3-nitro-4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (11Ohshima H. Friesen M. Brouet I. Bartsch H. Food Chem. Toxicol. 1990; 28: 647-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 12Mani A.R. Pannala A.S. Orie N.N. Ollosson R. Harry D. Rice-Evans C.A. Moore K.P. Biochem. J. 2003; 374: 521-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and it seemed likely that chloro-HPA would be the corresponding major urinary metabolite of chlorotyrosine. Indeed when we first screened the urine for differences in the metabolite profile of rats ingesting chlorotyrosine compared with tyrosine ingesting controls, one peak was markedly prominent and corresponded to chloro-HPA. Subsequent studies confirmed that this was the major chlorinated metabolite of chlorotyrosine, accounting for nearly 4% of infused chlorotyrosine, but this simple screening approach failed to identify the dominant non-chlorinated metabolites which hid behind those formed endogenously from tyrosine metabolism. Further studies using infused deuterated chlorotyrosine enabled us to follow the deuterium, knowing that it could only have been derived from infused chlorotyrosine. We observed that almost 40% of infused [D4]chlorotyrosine was excreted in the urine as the dechlorinated derivative, [D4]HPA, which was comparable with the metabolism of injected [D4]tyrosine in rats (Fig. 3). These data demonstrate that either chlorotyrosine or chloro-HPA undergoes dechlorination in vivo. However, whereas chloro-HPA can be dechlorinated in vivo, less than 10% of infused [D5]chloro-HPA is excreted in the urine as the dechlorinated derivative. This data suggests that the major substrate for dechlorination is chlorotyrosine. We further showed that human hepatoblastoma cells (HepG2) in culture could catalyze dechlorination of chlorotyrosine in vitro (Table 1). To date, various microbial and protistal (e.g. Dictyostelium) dechlorinases have been isolated and characterized (29Sun B. Griffin B.M. Ayala-del-Rio H.L. Hashsham S.A. Tiedje J.M.

However, this is the first report to demonstrate that chlorotyrosine undergoes a dehalogenation reaction in mammals (Fig. 7). Most of the tyrosine present in a cell is protein-bound, and chlorination of tyrosine residues site specifically affects the functions of the proteins (27Shao B. Bergt C. Fu X. Green P. Voss J.C. Oda M.N. Oram J.F. Heinecke J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 5983-5993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated whether protein-bound chlorotyrosine could undergo dechlorination in vitro. Chlorinated albumin was incubated with liver homogenates obtained from analbuminemic rats. The main advantage of using these rats is that incubated albumin could then be separated from other proteins by SDS-PAGE because analbuminemic rats do not express albumin. Incubation of chlorinated albumin with liver homogenates led to a decrease of chlorotyrosine levels as well as the chlorotyrosine/tyrosine ratio in both control and endotoxemic rats. The decrease in chlorotyrosine levels or ratio was highest when chlorinated albumin was incubated with liver tissue obtained from endotoxemic rats suggesting that this process was inducible. These data are in line with the existence of a mechanism responsible for either dechlorination or proteolysis of chlorinated albumin in our model system. We excluded simple proteolysis by co-incubation with a mixture of protease inhibitors to the lysis buffer before tissue homogenization. Furthermore there was no statistical difference in tyrosine content of the hydrolyzed albumin among the groups, whereas chlorotyrosine content showed a significant reduction following incubation with tissue homogenate (Fig. 5). These data suggest that intact proteins can undergo dechlorination in vivo, whereas current thinking views protein chlorination as an irreversible event. A similar mechanism has been suggested for nitration reaction by Murad and colleagues (23Kamisaki Y. Wada K. Bian K. Balabanli B. Davis K. Martin E. Behbod F. Lee Y.C. Murad F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11584-11589Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 24Irie Y. Saeki M. Kamisaki Y. Martin E. Murad F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5634-5639Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) who reported an activity in rat tissues that denitrates nitrotyrosine-containing proteins. Although the responsible mechanisms for dehalogenation of chlorotyrosine have not yet been identified, we tested two important enzymatic pathways which might be involved. We initially tested the effect of a nonspecific cytochrome P450 inhibitor, 1-aminobenzotriazole, on metabolism of intraperitoneally injected [D4]chlorotyrosine in rats. Rats pre-treated with 1-aminobenzotriazole showed the same pattern of [D4]HPA and [D4]chloro-HPA excretion compared with saline-treated rats. Furthermore, HepG2 monolayers, which do not adequately express cytochrome P450 isoforms (35Wilkening S. Stahl F. Bader A. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2003; 31: 1035-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar), also catalyze the dechlorination of [D4]chlorotyrosine in vitro. In mammals, iodotyrosines account for two-thirds of the iodine in thyroglobulin and serve as precursors in the formation of the thyroid hormones. Secretion of thyroid hormones requires the proteolysis of thyroglobulin, in the course of which, the free amino acids iodotyrosine and di-iodotyrosine are released from peptide linkages. The free iodotyrosine and di-iodotyrosine cannot be reutilized as such for thyroglobulin synthesis but are enzymatically deiodinated. This enzymatic deiodination is a reductive process that leads to the formation of iodide and tyrosine, both of which can then be reused for thyroglobulin synthesis (16Gnidehou S. Caillou B. Talbot M. Ohayon R. Kaniewski J. NoelHudson M.S. Morand S. Agnangji D. Sezan A. Courtin F. Virion A. Dupuy C. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 1574-1576Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). One of the first mammalian dehalogenase (DEHAL1) activity was characterized 50 years ago, which catalyzes the deiodination of iodotyrosine to tyrosine and iodide (13Roche J. Michel R. Michel O. Lissitzky S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1952; 9: 161-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Thus, we postulated that chlorotyrosine might undergo dechlorination to form tyrosine in a reaction catalyzed by DEHAL1. Our data showed that although chlorotyrosine reversibly inhibits DEHAL1 deiodinase activity, it is not a substrate for this enzyme. This is the first description of a dechlorination pathway for chlorotyrosine in mammals and demonstrates that this is the major metabolic route to eliminate this modified amino acid formed during inflammation. Although the mechanism of this reaction is not identified in the present study, it is likely that a specific enzyme is responsible for this newly identified metabolic pathway.

Analysis of the bioactive surface of the scorpion β-toxin Css4 (from Centruroides suffusus suffusus) toward rat brain (rNav1.2a) and skeletal muscle (rNav1.4) channels using binding studies revealed commonality but also substantial differences, which were used to design a specific activator, Css4F14A/E15A/E28R, of rNav1.4 expressed in Xenopus oocytes. The therapeutic potential of Css4F14A/E15A/E28R was tested using an rNav1.4 mutant carrying the same mutation present in the genetic disorder hypokalemic periodic paralysis. The activator restored the impaired gating properties of the mutant channel expressed in oocytes, thus offering a tentative new means for treatment of neuromuscular disorders with reduced muscle excitability. Mutant double cycle analysis employing toxin residues involved in the construction of Css4F14A/E15A/E28R and residues whose equivalents in the rat brain channel rNav1.2a were shown to affect Css4 binding revealed significant coupling energy (>1.3 kcal/mol) between F14A and E592A at Domain-2/voltage sensor segments 1–2 (D2/S1-S2), R27Q and E1251N at D3/SS2-S6, and E28R with both E650A at D2/S3-S4 and E1251N at D3/SS2-S6. These results show that despite the differences in interactions with the rat brain and skeletal muscle Navs, Css4 recognizes a similar region on both channel subtypes. Moreover, our data indicate that the S3-S4 loop of the voltage sensor module in Domain-2 is in very close proximity to the SS2-S6 segment of the pore module of Domain-3 in rNav1.4. This is the first experimental evidence that the inter-domain spatial organization of mammalian Navs resembles that of voltage-gated potassium channels.

Among the superfamily of voltage-gated ion channels, sodium channels (Navs) 3The abbreviations used are:Navvoltage-gated sodium channelCss4Centruroides suffusus suffusus β-toxin 4hypoPPhypokalemic periodic paralysis. play a central role in the generation of action potentials in excitable cells and are the target of a large variety of neurotoxins, drugs, and insecticides (1Catterall W.A.

Eukaryotic Navs are constituted from one large protein that forms four homologous, non-identical domains. As for Kvs, each domain of the Nav comprises two functional modules. The pore module consists of transmembrane segments S5 and S6 connected by a membrane-associated re-entrant loop (SS1-SS2). The voltage-sensing module, which consists of segments S1-S4, undergoes a conformational alteration in response to changes in the membrane potential, enabling channel activation (1Catterall W.A. Neuron. 2000; 26: 13-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1705) Google Scholar, 5Bezanilla F. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 555-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). Estimation of the distances between transmembrane segments of the homo-tetrameric bacterial Nav, NaChBac, suggested an intra-subunit organization similar to that of Kvs in a lipid bilayer (6Richardson J. Blunck R. Ge P. Selvin P.R. Bezanilla F. Papazian D.M. Correa A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A variety of mammalian Navs, encoded by at least nine genes, have been described (1Catterall W.A.

Expression of these channels varies greatly across tissues and developmental stages (1Catterall W.A. Neuron. 2000; 26: 13-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1705) Google Scholar). Nav1.1–1.3 and Nav1.6 are expressed in the central nervous system, Nav1.6 and Nav1.7 are expressed in the peripheral nervous system, Nav1.8 and Nav1.9 are expressed in sensory neurons, and Nav1.4 and Nav1.5 are expressed in skeletal and cardiac muscle, respectively. Many genetic disorders leading to abnormal function of these channels have been described in humans (e.g. Refs. 8Vicart S. Sternberg D. Fontaine B. Meola G. Neurol.

Gating modifiers that facilitate channel activation could potentially restore the properties of defective Navs, but to be therapeutically applicable they have to be highly specific for hNav1.4. Scorpion β-toxins (e.g. the anti-mammalian Css2 and Css4 from Centruroides suffusus suffusus) are short polypeptides reticulated by four disulfide bonds that target Navs and modulate their gating properties (17Martin-Eauclaire M.F. Couraud F. Chang L.W. Dyer R.S. Handbook of Neurotoxicology. Marcel Dekker, New York1995: 683-716Google Scholar). They are typified by the shift they induce in the voltage dependence of channel activation to more negative membrane potentials upon binding to receptor site 4 (17Martin-Eauclaire M.F. Couraud F. Chang L.W. Dyer R.S. Handbook of Neurotoxicology. Marcel Dekker, New York1995: 683-716Google Scholar), shown to be associated with Domain 2 of the Nav (18Marcotte P. Chen L.Q. Kallen R.G. Chahine M.

Four conserved residues in D2/S1-S2 and S3-S4 have been implicated in the interaction of the β-toxin Css4 with mammalian Navs (19Cestèle S. Qu Y. Rogers J.C. Rochat H. Catterall W.A.

Chem. 2006; 281: 21332-21344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), and two residues in D3/SS2-S6 have recently been linked to the preference of the β-toxin Tz1, from the scorpion Tityus zulianus, for the muscle channel rNav1.4 over the brain channel rNav1.2a (22Leipold E. Hansel A. Borges A. Heinemann S.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 70: 340-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). These data, and the fact that Css4 is more potent at hNav1.2a than hNav1.4 (23Schiavon E. Sacco T. Cassulini R.R. Gurrola G. Tempia F. Possani L.D. Wanke E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 20326-20337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), have suggested that the set of residues comprising receptor site 4 on both channels are not identical. As the binding of β-toxins is independent of membrane potential and because a depolarizing prepulse is required to observe their effect, it was suggested that prebound β-toxins trap the D2/S4 segment in its outward activated position, leading to enhanced channel activation upon subsequent depolarizations (19Cestèle S. Qu Y. Rogers J.C. Rochat H. Catterall W.A. Neuron. 1998; 21: 919-931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Despite the accumulated knowledge about their mode of interaction with the Nav, complete elucidation of neurotoxin receptor site 4 and the extent of its conservation in various channel subtypes remained to be described. Toxins with high preference for Nav subtypes are useful for identifying distinct channels and studying their mechanism of action and may also be instrumental in development of new drugs for treating neurological and muscular disorders. Moreover, as the receptor binding sites for toxins incorporate residues of different, not necessarily adjacent, extracellular loops (1Catterall W.A. Neuron. 2000; 26: 13-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1705) Google Scholar, 20Cestèle S. Yarov-Yarovoy V. Qu F.H. Sampieri F. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. J. Biol.

Pharmacol. 2006; 70: 340-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), by identifying interacting residues of toxins and channels and by relying on the known toxin structures we may elucidate the spatial organization of the channel extracellular face. Mutagenic dissection of scorpion β-toxins that affect both mammalian (Css4) and insect (the excitatory toxin Bj-xtrIT from Buthotus judaicus and the depressant toxin LqhIT2 from Leiurus quinquestriatus hebraeus) Navs revealed a spatially similar cluster of bioactive residues (24Cohen L. Karbat I. Gilles N. Froy O. Angelovici R. Gordon D. Gurevitz M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8206-8211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 25Cohen L. Karbat I. Gilles N.

Frolow F. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 366: 586-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Moreover, we have suggested that a spatially conserved Glu residue in β-toxins (position 28 in Css4) forms a “hot spot” for interaction with receptor site 4 (25Cohen L. Karbat I. Gilles N. Ilan N. Gordon D. Gurevitz M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 5045-5053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Here we show profound variations in the bioactive surface of Css4 toward the rat muscle and brain Navs, which we used to construct a Css4 triple mutant that exclusively binds and affects rNav1.4. This mutant toxin can restore most of the gating properties of a rNav1.4 mutant designed according to a mutation found in hypoPP patients. We also identified Css4-rNav1.4 residue pairs that exhibit coupling energies indicating close proximity of specific extracellular channel loops. These data enabled the first estimation of the distance between extracellular loops of the gating and pore modules of two adjacent Nav domains and provide evidence that the inter-domain architecture of Navs resembles that of Kvs. Mutagenesis of Css4—PCR-driven mutagenesis, expression in Escherichia coli, in vitro folding, and purification of Css4 derivatives have been described in detail elsewhere (25Cohen L.

Expression of Sodium Channels in Oocytes—The pNa200 vectors bearing the genes encoding rNav1.2a, rNav1.3, and rNav1.6 were a gift from Dr. A. Goldin (University of California, Irvine). The pAlter vectors bearing the genes encoding rNav1.4 and hNav1.5 were a gift from Dr. R. G. Kallen (University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA). These genes and the auxiliary hβ1 were transcribed in vitro using T7 RNA polymerase and the mMESSAGE mMACHINE™ system (Ambion, Austin, TX) (27Gershon E. Weigl L. Lotan I. Schreibmayer W. Dascal N. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 3743-3752Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Wallner M. Weigl L. Meera P. Lotan I.

Gordon D. Lotan I. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 4364-4371Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Site-directed Mutagenesis of rNav1.4—pAlter containing the entire rat skeletal muscle sodium channel α-subunit was used for oligonucleotide-based mutagenesis. The PCR-amplified fragment containing the mutations E592A, H599Q/D601S/N602S, E650A, L653A, Q657E, G658N, and R666G was cleaved by BsiwI and BssHII and inserted into the corresponding sites of the vector. E1251N and H1257K were cleaved by EcoNI and inserted into the corresponding sites of the vector, which was further used for transcription after DNA sequence verification. Two Electrode Voltage Clamp Recording and Data Analysis— Currents were measured 1–2 days after injection using a two electrode voltage clamp and a Gene Clamp 500 amplifier (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA). Data were sampled at 10 kHz and filtered at 5 kHz. Toxins were diluted with bath solution and applied directly to the bath to achieve the desired final concentration. Data acquisition was controlled by a Macintosh PPC 7100/80 computer equipped with an ITC-16 analog/digital converter (Instrutech Corp., Port Washington, NY), using Synapse (Synergistic Systems). The bath solution contained 96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, and 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.85. Oocytes were washed with bath solution flowing from a BPS-8 perfusion system (ALA Scientific Instruments, Westbury, NY) with a positive pressure of 4 psi. Capacitance transients and leak currents were removed by subtracting a scaled control trace using a P/6 protocol (29Armstrong C.M. Bezanilla F. J. Gen. Physiol. 1974; 63: 533-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). For the GV analysis, mean conductance (G) was calculated from the peak current/voltage relationship using the equation G = I/(V - Vrev), where I is the peak current, V is the membrane potential, and Vrev is the reversal potential. The normalized conductance/voltage relationship was fit with either a one- or two-component Boltzmann distribution according to Equation 1 G/Gmax = (1−A)/(1+exp[(V11/2−V)/k1]) + A/(1 +exp[(V21/2−V)/k2]) where V1½ and V2½ are the respective membrane potentials for two populations of channels for which the mean conductance is half maximal, k1 and k2 are their respective slopes, and A defines the proportion of the second population (amplitude) with respect to the total. For fits in which only one population of channels was apparent, A was set to zero. The voltage dependence of steady-state fast inactivation was described using a single Boltzmann distribution as shown in Equation 2 I/Imax =α0+α1/(1+exp[(V−V1/2)/k]) where I is the peak current measured during the test depolarization step, Imax is the current without a preceding conditioning step, V is the membrane potential of the conditioning step, V½ is the membrane potential at which half-maximal inactivation is achieved, k is the slope factor, α0 is the remaining normalized peak current at highly depolarizing conditioning potentials, and α1 is the normalized amplitude (30Chen H. Heinemann S.H. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 117: 505-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). For mutant double cycle analysis, the dose response for Css4 effects on rNav1.4 was determined based on the current induced by the toxin following a test pulse to a voltage of -35 mV from the V0.5 of activation determined for each channel mutant (Table 1). The free energy change in toxin binding to the wild-type/mutant channel pair (ΔG) was calculated as the difference of the average -RTln (EC50) for the wild type and mutant, where R is the gas constant and T stands for temperature in 0K. ΔΔG was taken as the difference of the ΔGs for Css4 and the toxin mutant: ΔΔG = (GWT, native - Gmutant, native) - (GWT, mutant - Gmutant, mutant), where the first and second subscript positions refer to the channel and the toxin, respectively. RT = 0.59 kcal/mol.TABLE 1Effects of Css4 mutants on the activation of various Navs and rNav1.4 mutants The G/V relations in the presence of Css4 mutants exhibit two components: a minor negative shift in the V0.5 of activation of the entire channel population (upper number), and a stronger shift in the V0.5 (lower number) of a fraction (in parentheses) of the channel population. Data represent the mean ± S.E. of at least six independent experiments. The EC50 of Css4E15A was 0.46 and 0.88 μm for rNav1.2a and rNav 1.4, respectively.

Radio-iodination of Css4, purification of monoiodotoxin, and binding assays were performed as previously described (25Cohen L. Karbat I. Gilles N. Ilan N. Gordon D. Gurevitz M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 5045-5053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Nonspecific toxin binding was determined in the presence of 1 μm unlabeled toxin and consisted typically of 15–30% of total binding. Each experiment was performed in duplicate and repeated at least three times as indicated (n). Data are presented as the mean ± S.D. for independent experiments. Comparison of Css4 Interactions with Rat Skeletal Muscle and Brain Navs and Construction of a Specific Modifier for Nav1.4—To clarify the difference in Css4 potency at Nav1.2a versus Nav1.4 we sought for the toxin bioactive surface toward the skeletal muscle Nav and compared it with the reported surface toward brain Navs (25Cohen L. Karbat I. Gilles N. Ilan N. Gordon D. Gurevitz M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 5045-5053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that substitution of Tyr-4, Thr-10, Phe-14, Leu-19, Tyr-24, Arg-27, Glu-28, Gln-32, Tyr-40, Tyr-42, Phe-44, Trp-47, Trp-58, and Lys-63 for Ala considerably affected Css4 binding affinity for rat brain synaptosomes (supplemental Table S1 and Ref. 25). Most of these substitutions also decreased the binding affinity for rat muscle membranes, except for those at Thr-10, Phe-14, Glu-28, Gln-32, and Lys-63 (supplemental Table S1 and Fig. 1). These results raised a subset of residues that are involved in the surface of interaction of the toxin with both rat brain and skeletal muscle Navs and highlighted a few residues whose roles differ. This difference is notable in light of the CD alteration rendered by T10A, F14A, and K63A and the fact that Glu-28 and Gln-32 have been assigned to the “hot spot” in the surface of interaction of Css4 with the rat brain channel (25Cohen L. Karbat I. Gilles N. Ilan N. Gordon D. Gurevitz M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 5045-5053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Thus, receptor site-4, which pertains to the interface between Css4 and the Nav, differs in mammalian brain versus muscle Navs, especially in respect to Phe-14 and Glu-28 (supplemental Table S1), which laid the groundwork for construction of a mutant toxin specific for Nav1.4. Because the affinity of mutant E15A for both channel types exceeded 10-fold that of the unmodified toxin (supplemental Table 1 and Fig. 1), we constructed Css4 mutants bearing various combinations of substitutions F14A and E28R in the background of E15A. The most significant among these constructs was the triple mutant Css4F14A/E15A/E28R, whose affinity for the brain channel dropped 254-fold whereas its affinity for the skeletal muscle channel was similar to that of Css4E15A (supplemental Table S1), thus providing a highly selective ligand for muscle channels. We then analyzed the effects of these mutants on a variety of mammalian Navs co-expressed in Xenopus oocytes with the β1 subunit, using Css4E15A as the first point of reference. Css4E15A was active at rNav1.2a and rNav1.4 but had no effect at rNav1.3, hNav1.5, and rNav1.6 even at a concentration of 5 μm (Table 1 and supplemental Fig. S1). Hence, the preference of Css4E15A for the mammalian Nav subtypes was similar to that of Css4 (19Cestèle S. Qu Y. Rogers J.C. Rochat H. Catterall W.A.

Karbat I. Gilles N. Ilan N. Gordon D. Gurevitz M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 5045-5053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Css4E15A induced a -25-mV shift in the threshold of activation for both rNav1.2a and rNav1.4 (at 0.5 and 1 μm, respectively) (Fig. 2 and supplemental Fig. S1). The conductance-voltage relation (G/V) curves for rNav1.2a and rNav1.4 in the presence of Css4E15A exhibit two components with a minor negative shift in the voltage for half activation (V0.5) of the entire channel population and a stronger shift in the V0.5 of a fraction of the channel population (Fig. 2 and Table 1, values in parentheses). The effects of Css4E15A on channel activation resembled those of Css4 in the requirement for a depolarizing prepulse of similar duration and the rates of association and dissociation at rNav1.2a and rNav1.4 (supplemental Fig. S1) (19Cestèle S.

Css4F14A/E15A, Css4E15A/E28R, and Css4F14A/E15A/E28R had no effect on the voltage dependence of activation of the neuronal channels rNav1.2a, rNav1.3, and rNav1.6 and the cardiac channel hNav1.5. However, they shifted the voltage dependence of rNav1.4 activation equally as well as Css4E15A, demonstrating complete specificity for the skeletal muscle channel (Table 1 and Fig. 2).

https://openalex.org/W2085896337,"Dialysis related amyloidosis is a serious complication of long-term hemodialysis in which beta(2)-microglobulin (beta(2)m) forms amyloid fibrils that deposit predominantly in cartilaginous tissues. How these fibrils form in vivo, however, is poorly understood. Here we perform a systematic investigation into the role of macrophages in the formation and degradation of beta(2)m amyloid fibrils, building on observations that macrophages are found in association with beta(2)m amyloid deposits in vivo and that these cells contain intra-lysosomal beta(2)m amyloid. In live cell imaging experiments we demonstrate that macrophages internalize monomeric beta(2)m, whereupon it is sorted to lysosomes. At lysosomal pH beta(2)m self-associates in vitro to form amyloid-like fibrils with an array of morphologies as visualized by atomic force microscopy. Cleavage of the monomeric protein by both macrophages and lysosomal proteases isolated from these cells results in the rapid degradation of the monomeric protein, preventing amyloid formation. Incubation of macrophages with preformed fibrils revealed that macrophages internalize amyloid-like fibrils formed extracellularly, but in marked contrast with the monomeric protein, the fibrils were not degraded within macrophage lysosomes. Correspondingly beta(2)m fibrils were highly resistant to degradation by high concentrations of lysosomal proteases isolated from macrophages. Despite their enormous degradative capacity, therefore, macrophage lysosomes cannot ameliorate dialysis-related amyloidosis by degrading pre-existing amyloid fibrils, but lysosomal proteases may play a protective role by eliminating amyloid precursors before beta(2)m fibrils can accumulate in what may represent an otherwise fibrillogenic environment."
https://openalex.org/W1980485144,"The three species in the Allonemobius socius complex of crickets have recently diverged and radiated across North America. Interestingly, the only barriers to gene flow between these species in zones of secondary contact appear to be associated with fertilization traits - e.g., conspecific sperm precedence and the ability of males to induce females to lay eggs. Other traits, such as the length of female's reproductive tract, may also influence fertilization success and be associated with species boundaries. However, the underlying variation in this duct has not been assessed across populations and species. Moreover, the effects of reproductive parasites like Wolbachia on these morphological features have yet to be addressed, even though its infections are concentrated in reproductive tissues. I evaluated both the natural variation in and the effects of Wolbachia infection on spermathecal duct length among several populations of two species in the Allonemobius socius complex. My results suggest the following: (1) spermathecal duct length varies between species and is associated with species boundaries, (2) there is considerable variation among populations within species, (3) there is a Wolbachia infection-by-population interaction effect on the length of the spermathecal duct, and (4) experimental curing of Wolbachia recovers the uninfected morphology. These findings suggest the following hypotheses: (1) spermathecal duct length, like other fertilization traits in Allonemobius, is evolving rapidly and influences reproductive isolation and (2) Wolbachia-induced modifications of this duct could influence the dynamics of male-female coevolution. Further experiments are needed, however, to explicitly test these latter two hypotheses."

Perhaps the best studied are its roles in chylomicron assembly and secretion. ApoA-IV is secreted from enterocytes as part of triglyceride-rich chylomicrons (1Green P.H. Glickman R.M. Riley J.W. Quinet E. J. Clin. Invest. 1980; 65: 911-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), and its synthesis is increased dramatically upon consumption of a lipid-rich meal (1Green P.H. Glickman R.M.

However, when apoA-IV release from the endoplasmic reticulum is genetically disrupted, apoB and lipoprotein secretion is inhibited (4Gallagher J.W. Weinberg R.B. Shelness G.S. J.

On the other hand, overexpression of human apoA-IV in porcine intestinal cells enhances basolateral lipid secretion via production of larger chylomicron-like particles (5Lu S. Yao Y. Cheng X.

Given its likely role in triglyceride-rich lipoprotein metabolism, it is perhaps not surprising that genetic manipulation of apoA-IV results in interesting phenotypes with respect to plasma lipids and atherosclerosis.

Taken together, the evidence suggests that apoA-IV can be protective against atherosclerosis, and its mechanism of action warrants further study. Human apoA-IV consists of 376 amino acids, making it the largest of the exchangeable apolipoproteins. Like other apolipoproteins in this class, apoA-IV has several 22-mer amino acid repeats predicted to form amphipathic α-helices. These helices are widely considered to be operational for lipid binding and, therefore, for the functionality of these proteins. In the closely related protein apoA-I, amphipathic helix 1 and, particularly, helix 10 have been identified as the initial lipid binding regions (14Palgunachari M.N. Mishra V.K. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. Adeyeye S.O. Alluri S. Anantharamaiah G.M. Segrest J.P. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1996; 16: 328-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). It is believed that the two ends of apoA-I bind first to a lipid surface, followed by a cooperative binding of the rest of the helical segments. Furthermore, disruption of apoA-I helix 10 markedly reduces its ability to promote cholesterol efflux from cells via the ATP binding cassette transporter A1, a critical process for the maintenance of plasma high density lipoprotein levels (15Panagotopulos S.E. Witting S.R. Horace E.M. Hui D.Y. Maiorano J.N. Davidson W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39477-39484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). During chylomicron lipolysis, apoA-IV rapidly leaves the particle surface and circulates either lipid-free or bound to high density lipoprotein lipid particles (1Green P.H. Glickman R.M. Riley J.W. Quinet E. J. Clin. Invest. 1980; 65: 911-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). There is much debate about the ratio of lipid-free versus lipid-bound apoA-IV in plasma; different groups have come to drastically different conclusions, probably due to differences in separation techniques (11Ezeh B. Haiman M. Alber H.F. Kunz B. Paulweber B. Lingenhel A. Kraft H.G. Weidinger F. Pachinger O. Dieplinger H. Kronenberg F. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 1523-1529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Still, many studies show that a significant fraction of apoA-IV circulates lipid-free in plasma (∼30–77%) (1Green P.H. Glickman R.M. Riley J.W. Quinet E. J. Clin. Invest. 1980; 65: 911-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 16Lagrost L. Gambert P. Boquillon M. Lallemant C. J.

Invest. 1992; 22: 166-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). It is therefore possible that different functions are carried out by apoA-IV depending on its lipidation state. It follows that a detailed understanding of the apoA-IV lipid binding mechanism will be a key piece of information for understanding apoA-IV function. Given the apparent evolutionary relationship between apoA-I and apoA-IV, we hypothesized that, like apoA-I, the apoA-IV C terminus should contain helical regions that are crucial for lipid binding. What we discovered was the exact opposite; when the C-terminal 44 amino acids were removed from apoA-IV, the protein actually increased its lipid binding efficiency (18Pearson K. Saito H. Woods S.C. Lund-Katz S. Tso P. Phillips M.C. Davidson W.S. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 10719-10729Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). We then undertook studies to locate particular regions within the protein that may interact to modulate lipid association. We found that the mutation of either phenylalanine 334 or 335 to alanine drastically increased the rate at which apoA-IV is able to reorganize 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine (DMPC) liposomes. However, if amino acids 11–20 were deleted, the mutant reversed to the slow lipid binding of wild type apoA-IV (19Pearson K. Tubb M.R. Tanaka M. Zhang X.Q. Tso P. Weinberg R.B. Davidson W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 38576-38582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In the current work, we have determined the exact residues present in the N terminus that are responsible for reversion to the slow lipid-binding phenotype. In addition, we have gathered evidence that indicates that these residues participate in an intramolecular interaction with a C-terminal domain of apoA-IV and that this interaction modulates its lipid interaction.

Woods S.C. Lund-Katz S. Tso P. Phillips M.C. Davidson W.S. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 10719-10729Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In general, 600 ml of LB culture yielded 30–40 mg of uncut protein (>95% pure). Adequate expression was verified by SDS-PAGGE comparing cell lysate from induced and non-induced cultures. Cell pellets were solubilized in the presence of a protease inhibitor mixture (phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, leupeptin, pepstatin), disrupted by probe sonication, and protein was purified by affinity chromatography utilizing the vector's His tag and Ni2+ resin columns. The His tag was cleaved using the endoprotease, IgA protease, which cleaves the sequence PRPPTP, leaving an additional threonine and proline on the protein's N terminus. The cleaved tag was separated from cut protein using the nickel affinity column and collecting the flow-through containing >98% pure cut protein. Proteins were dialyzed into 10 mm ammonium bicarbonate, lyophilized, and stored at -20 °C in several-mg aliquots. Lyophilized proteins were reconstituted in standard Tris buffer (STB; 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 0.02% sodium azide) plus 3 m guanidine and dialyzed into STB before use. Protein degradation was monitored by SDS-PAGGE, and proteins were not used if significant degradation was observed. Before each experiment, protein concentration was determined in a single Markwell-Lowry protein assay (22Markwell M.A. Haas S.M. Bieber L.L. Tolbert N.E. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 87: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (5308) Google Scholar). For the cysteine mutants, serine 16 and/or 336 were replaced with a cysteine by site-directed mutagenesis as described above. Cysteine mutants were purified using the standard nickel column method. Purification by ammonium sulfate precipitation to avoid cysteine exposure to nickel did not affect labeling efficiency of the cysteine. For the disulfide linkage experiments (Fig. 7), 2Cys F334A protein was refolded by dialysis from 3 m guanidine into STB in the presence of 5 mm DTT. Only after the protein was in its native conformation in STB + 5 mm DTT was the DTT dialyzed out to allow for disulfide bond formation. Monomeric 2Cys F334A protein was isolated by tandem size exclusion chromatography with no DTT present, and isolated monomeric protein was identified by nonreducing SDS-PAGGE. Lipid Binding Assays—The rate of lipid association was determined using the DMPC liposome clearance assay (23Pownall H.J. Massey J.B. Kusserow S.K. Gotto Jr., A.M. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 1183-1188Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 24Segall M.L. Dhanasekaran P. Baldwin F. Anantharamaiah G.M. Weisgraber K.H. Phillips M.C. Lund-Katz S. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 1688-1700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Briefly, DPMC multilamellar vesicles (MLVs) at 5 mg/ml were prepared in STB by brief probe sonication. MLVs and STB were mixed, so that once protein was added, the final DMPC concentration was 0.425 mg/ml. Protein was quickly added to the above mixture to a final 0.17 mg/ml protein concentration (2.5:1 DMPC/protein, w/w). Proteins for all experiments were in STB except for the experiment presented in Fig. 7, which was in STB with and without 5 mm DTT. Absorbance at 325 nm was measured in an Amersham Biosciences Ultraspec 4000 UV-visible spectrophotometer at 24.5 °C at 30-s intervals for 20 min. Samples were run in triplicate, and plots were normalized to the initial absorbance of the sample (OD0). The clearance of the reaction is due to apoprotein binding to, and solubilization of, the MLVs to small discoidal lipoproteins that do not scatter light at 325 nm. The assay was carried out at 24.5 °C, the gel/liquid crystal transition temperature of DMPC, where an optimal number of lattice defects exist on the MLV surface. Each result was verified by at least one additional DMPC experiment on a separate day from an independent protein expression. The DMPC liposome clearance assay is a multistep reaction that involves binding to the lipid surface followed by an unknown reorganization step. Thus, this assay is not strictly a measure of lipid binding. However, it has been proposed that the initial binding steps are rate-limiting and that once a critical number of apoproteins bind to the lattice defects on the MLV surface, the rate of reorganization is similar for all proteins (24Segall M.L. Dhanasekaran P. Baldwin F. Anantharamaiah G.M. Weisgraber K.H. Phillips M.C. Lund-Katz S. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 1688-1700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). To more specifically focus on the lipid binding step in isolation, we studied select mutants and WT apoA-IV using the biotin capture lipid affinity assay (25Davidson W.S. Ghering A.B. Beish L. Tubb M.R. Hui D.Y. Pearson K. J. Lipid Res. 2006; 47: 440-449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Briefly, a constant mass of small unilamellar POPC vesicles (SUVs) containing small amounts of biotinylated lipid and fluorescently labeled lipid were mixed with increasing amounts of apolipoprotein in a microplate setup. After binding reached equilibrium, vesicle-bound protein was separated from unbound protein in a 96-well streptavidin column plate. Kd values and n values were calculated based on bound versus total loaded protein and total phospholipid content using a fluorescent protein assay and the fluorescent lipid. Unlike DMPC, POPC SUVs do not reorganize, allowing us to observe the binding event in isolation. Spectroscopy—ANS, a probe that fluoresces only when in contact with hydrophobic surfaces (26Slavik J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 694: 1-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar), was reacted with WT, F334A or W12A/F15A/F334A and with WT human apoA-I for comparison at room temperature in STB. Briefly, proteins were diluted to 50 μg/ml (1.15 μm), and ANS was added in excess at 250 μm. ANS was excited at 395 nm in a Photon Technology International Quantamaster fluorescent spectrophotometer, and emission was scanned from 400 to 600 nm. Samples were run in triplicate, and curves were corrected for buffer emission. For circular dichroism studies, proteins were freshly dialyzed against 20 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), and relative concentration was determined by the Markwell-Lowry method. Proteins were then diluted to 100 μg/ml, and spectra were collected on a Jasco J-715 spectropolarimeter in a 1-mm cell as an average of three scans. The scans were from 260 to 190 nm at 50 nm/min with a 0.5-nm step size and 0.5-s response. Bandwidth was set to 1 mm, and slit width was 500 μm. To confirm the accuracy of dilution, protein concentration was verified by A280 on the diluted wild type apoA-IV sample, and mean residual ellipticity was calculated based on this value for all three protein samples. Mean residual ellipticity was calculated as described by Woody (27Woody R.W. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 246: 34-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar) using 115.3 as the mean residual weight for apoA-IV. Fractional helical content was calculated using the formula of Chen et al. (28Chen Y.H. Yang J.T. Martinez H.M. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 4120-4131Crossref PubMed Scopus (1900) Google Scholar) and the mean residual ellipticity at 222 nm. Each experiment was repeated three times with a similar pattern observed consistently. Protein Labeling and Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) Analysis—S336C was reduced in excess tris-(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride and freshly dialyzed against three changes of STB overnight. Results shown are from uncut protein still containing the His tag; however, similar experiments were conducted on cut protein, yielding comparable results. The pH was set to 6.5–7 in 1 ml of protein at 10 mg/ml for optimal cysteine specificity of the probe. While protected from light, CPM probe was reconstituted in Me2SO and added dropwise to the protein to a final mol/mol ratio of 2:1 (probe/protein). The reaction was carried out in the dark, overnight on a shaker at room temperature. WT apoA-IV was also labeled to monitor for nonspecific labeling. An equal volume of Me2SO was added to an additional set of proteins for the unlabeled (no acceptor) samples. Labeled and mock-labeled samples were dialyzed against three changes of STB to remove excess unreacted probe. Size exclusion chromatography was used for other sample preparations with negligible difference in results. Labeled or mock-labeled proteins were diluted in STB to a final concentration of 100 μg/ml for fluorescent measurements in order to reduce intermolecular interactions. FRET to the CPM acceptor probe was monitored by exciting the single tryptophan donor at 295 nm to minimize tyrosine excitation, and emission was scanned from 300 to 550 nm. Data were collected using a quartz cuvette in a Photon Technology International Quantamaster fluorescent spectrometer in photon counting mode at room temperature. Excitation and emission band passes were 3.0 nm. Buffer blanks were subtracted from each of the sample curves. Distance between donor and acceptor was calculated using the formula, E×1/fA=Ro6/(Ro6+R6)(Eq. 1) where E = 1 - IDA/ID, and fA is the fractional labeling efficiency of the protein with the acceptor probe. IDA is the donor emission intensity in the presence of the acceptor, and ID is the intensity in the absence of the acceptor. Ro is the Forster radius for the donor-acceptor pair used, Trp-CPM, and was set to 29 Å, which has been reported (29Alley S.C. Shier V.K. Abel-Santos E. Sexton D.J. Soumillion P. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7696-7709Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 30Trakselis M.A. Alley S.C. Abel-Santos E. Benkovic S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8368-8375Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Cross-linking Analysis—Lipid-free WT apoA-IV was prepared for structural analysis in much the same way as by Silva et al. (31Silva R.A. Hilliard G.M. Fang J. Macha S. Davidson W.S. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 2759-2769Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Briefly, WT apoA-IV (∼5 mg/ml) was dialyzed into phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.8) and cross-linked with the homobifunctional cross-linker BS3 at a final BS3/protein molar ratio of 10:1 and final protein concentration of 1–3 mg/ml. BS3 has the ability to react with δ-amino groups of lysine residues and the N-terminal primary amino group of a protein. During this reaction, BS3 bridges two such nearby reactive groups within its spacer arm length of 11.4 Å. BS3 was handled with minimal exposure to air to minimize hydrolysis. The cross-linker was suspended in phosphate-buffered saline and added to the protein within 1 min. The reaction was carried out for 18 h at 4 °C with gentle vortexing every 15 min for the first 1 h. At this point, the reaction was quenched with 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and the cross-linked protein was concentrated to a final volume of 300 μl. The sample was then applied to a tandem size exclusion column setup (Superose 6/Superdex 200) equilibrated in STB with 3 m guanidine, and monomer was separated from cross-linked dimer. Monomeric apoA-IV was exhaustively digested with sequencing grade trypsin (5% (w/w)) overnight, and 75–100-μg aliquots of trypsinized cross-linked monomeric apoA-IV were lyophilized and stored at -20 °C until use. Digested protein samples were analyzed on an Applied Biosystems Q-Star XL mass spectrometer equipped with an online Agilent 1100 capillary high performance liquid chromatograph as described previously (31Silva R.A. Hilliard G.M. Fang J. Macha S. Davidson W.S. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 2759-2769Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 32Silva R.A. Schneeweis L.A. Krishnan S.C. Zhang X. Axelsen P.H. Davidson W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 9713-9721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The cross-linked peptide pair described in this paper (1–25 × 333–343) was identified by mass and by tandem mass spectrometry. Its identity was confirmed in three of three mass spectrometer runs for which MS/MS data were available. Statistics—Mean and sample S.D. were determined for all applicable sample sets performed in triplicate. Any difference between two sample population means was determined using Student's t test, and p values were calculated from the t value and degrees of freedom. p values less than or equal to 0.05 were considered statistically significant. All lipid binding experiments were performed at least two times independently, yielding similar results. The figures show one such experiment. Absolute k values depend highly on exact experimental temperature and can therefore vary from experiment to experiment. Therefore, every experiment includes a wild type control and a fast mutant control so that the rate constant comparisons can be made within that experiment. Identification of N-terminal Residues That Modulate ApoA-IV Lipid Binding—Fig. 1 shows that WT apoA-IV was relatively ineffective at clearing DMPC liposomes compared with the Δ333–343 mutant, as shown previously (19Pearson K. Tubb M.R. Tanaka M. Zhang X.Q. Tso P. Weinberg R.B. Davidson W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005;"

We show here that TNF also induces caspase-8-dependent C-terminal cleavage of the retinoblastoma protein (Rb). Interestingly, fibroblasts from RbMI/MI mice, in which the C-terminal caspase cleavage site is mutated, exhibit a defect in Bid cleavage despite caspase-8 activation. Recent results suggest that TNF receptor endocytosis is required for the activation of caspase-8. Consistent with this notion, inhibition of V-ATPase, which plays an essential role in acidification and degradation of endosomes, specifically restores Bid cleavage in RbMI/MI cells. Inhibition of V-ATPase sensitizes RbMI/MI but not wild-type fibroblasts to TNF-induced apoptosis and stimulates inflammation-associated colonic apoptosis in RbMI/MI but not wild-type mice. These results suggest that Rb cleavage is required for Bid cleavage in TNF-induced type-2 apoptosis, and this requirement can be supplanted by the inhibition of V-ATPase.

Discovered as an inducer of tumor necrosis, TNF also promotes tumor development, particularly under conditions of chronic inflammation (1Karin M. Greten F.R. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 5: 749-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (2546) Google Scholar, 2Pikarsky E. Porat R.M. Stein I. Abramovitch R. Amit S. Kasem S. Gutkovich-Pyest E. Urieli-Shoval S. Galun E. Ben-Neriah Y.

The tumor-promoting activity of TNF is mediated through its activation of the NF-κB pathway, which stimulates the production of cytokines, chemokines, and apoptotic inhibitors (4Chen G. Goeddel D.V. Science. 2002; 296: 1634-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (1505) Google Scholar, 5Locksley R.M. Killeen N. Lenardo M.J. Cell. 2001; 104: 487-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3038) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, the type-1 TNF receptor (TNFR1) contains a death domain (DD) that can induce the assembly of death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) to activate the initiator caspase-8, leading to the induction of apoptosis (6Ashkenazi A. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 420-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (1111) Google Scholar, 7Park S.-M. Schickel R. Peter M.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2005; 17: 610-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). TNFR1 also activates programmed necrosis that is independent of caspase activity but mediated by reactive oxygen species (8Garg A.K. Aggarwal B.B. Mol. Immunol. 2002; 39: 509-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 9Festjens N. Vanden Berghe T. Vandenabeele P. Biochim. Biophys.

Cell. 2007; 26: 675-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). The prodeath function of TNF is observed when the NF-κB pathway is inactivated. In ex vivo experiments, cycloheximide (CHX) is routinely used to divert TNF signal toward death by blocking the expression of NF-κB-induced genes, such as FLIP and mitochondrial superoxide dismutase, that prevent the activation of caspase-8 and the generation of reactive oxygen species, respectively (11Kamata H. Honda S. Maeda S. Chang L. Hirata H. Karin M. Cell. 2005; 120: 649-661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1517) Google Scholar, 12Kreuz S. Siegmund D. Scheurich P. Wajant H. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 3964-3973Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). In cells defective in the NF-κB pathway, TNF alone (without CHX) is sufficient to induce cell death (13Beg A.A.

An important clue to how TNF differentially activates NF-κB or caspase-8 has come from recent studies showing that TNFR1 endocytosis is a prerequisite for DISC assembly (16Schneider-Brachert W. Tchikov V. Neumeyer J. Jakob M. Winoto-Morbach S. Held-Feindt J. Heinrich M. Merkel O. Ehrenschwender M. Adam D.

In the plasma membrane, activated TNFR1 is capable of stimulating the NF-κB pathway, but it does not associate with FADD or caspase-8 (18Micheau O. Tschopp J.

By contrast, two other DD receptors (i.e. FAS/CD95 and DR5) do assemble DISC at the plasma membrane when activated by FAS ligand or TRAIL, respectively (19Harper N. Hughes M. MacFarlane M. Cohen G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25534-25541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). In experiments conducted with a human fibrosarcoma cell line (HT1080) that expresses a degradation-resistant IκB-α to divert TNF signal toward caspase-8, Micheau and Tschopp (18Micheau O. Tschopp J. Cell. 2003; 114: 181-190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2026) Google Scholar) detected a cytosolic DISC complex containing TRADD, FADD, and caspase-8 but free of TNFR1. Subsequent studies conducted with human U937 and mouse 3T3 cells detected TNFR1-associated TRADD-FADD-caspase-8 complex in the endosomal fraction (16Schneider-Brachert W. Tchikov V. Neumeyer J.

Together, these results suggest that TNFR1 endocytosis and the release of DISC from the receptor-endosome may play a role in determining the cellular response to TNF. The retinoblastoma susceptibility gene product, Rb, is a nuclear scaffolding protein with multiple protein-binding pockets (20Welch P.J. Wang J.Y. Cell. 1993; 75: 779-790Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 21Welch P.J. Wang J.Y. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 31-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 22Lee J.O. Russo A.A.

Cell. 2005; 123: 1093-1106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Rb inhibits the transcription of E2F-regulated genes to block cell cycle progression. Because E2F also stimulates the expression of apoptotic factors, such as caspases and Apaf-1, inhibition of E2F by Rb confers apoptotic resistance in growth-arrested cells (24Heinen C.D. Goss K.H. Cornelius J.R. Babcock G.F. Knudsen E.S. Kowalik T. Groden J. Gastroenterology. 2002; 123: 751-763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Upon stimulation with mitogenic factors, Rb is inactivated through phosphorylation by cyclin-dependent kinases to promote cell cycle entry and S-phase progression (25Knudsen E.S. Wang J.Y.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8313-8320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Upon exposure to death stimuli, Rb is cleaved by caspase at a predominant site, DEAD886G887, near the C terminus of the protein (26Janicke R.U. Walker P.A. Lin X.Y. Porter A.G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6969-6978Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 27Natoli G. Costanzo A. Ianni A. Templeton D.J. Woodgett J.R. Balsano C. Levrero M.

Cleavage at this site generates a large fragment of Rb (RbΔI) that retains E2F-binding and transcription repression functions (26Janicke R.U. Walker P.A. Lin X.Y. Porter A.G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6969-6978Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 27Natoli G. Costanzo A. Ianni A. Templeton D.J. Woodgett J.R. Balsano C. Levrero M.

Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 177-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Thus, the C-terminal cleavage does not interfere with the antiproliferative activity of Rb. We have mutated this C-terminal caspase cleavage site to DEAA886E887 in the mouse Rb gene to create the Rb-MI allele (30Chau B.N. Borges H.L. Chen T.T. Masselli A. Hunton I.C. Wang J.Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 757-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The Rb-MI allele confers resistance to inflammation-induced apoptosis in the mouse intestine, which is dependent on TNF (30Chau B.N. Borges H.L. Chen T.T. Masselli A. Hunton I.C. Wang J.Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 757-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The Rb-MI allele also confers resistance to TNF-induced apoptosis in explanted thymocytes and in fibroblasts derived from the mouse embryos (30Chau B.N. Borges H.L. Chen T.T. Masselli A. Hunton I.C.

Death receptors, such as FAS and TNFR1, stimulate apoptosis through two pathways, both activated by caspase-8 (4Chen G. Goeddel D.V. Science. 2002; 296: 1634-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (1505) Google Scholar, 32Wajant H. Science. 2002; 296: 1635-1636Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar). In the type-1 pathway, initiator caspase-8 directly cleaves and activates effector caspases to induce apoptosis (33Scaffidi C. Fulda S. Srinivasan A. Friesen C. Li F. Tomaselli K.J. Debatin K.M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1675-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (2633) Google Scholar). In the type-2 pathway, initiator caspase-8 cleaves Bid, and the resulting tBid induces mitochondria outer membrane permeability to cause the release of proapoptotic factors, leading to the activation of apoptosome and caspase-9 (33Scaffidi C.

Cell. 1998; 94: 491-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3798) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that TNFR1-induced cytochrome c release is defective in Rb-MI fibroblasts (30Chau B.N. Borges H.L. Chen T.T. Masselli A. Hunton I.C. Wang J.Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 757-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In pursuing the mechanism underlying this defect, we have discovered that inhibition of vacuolar ATPase can restore the TNFR1-induced type-2 apoptotic pathway in Rb-MI cells. The vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase) is a proton pump that is conserved in eukaryotic cells (35Beyenbach K.W. Wieczorek H. J. Exp. Biol. 2006; 209: 577-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar, 36Inoue T. Wang Y. Jefferies K. Qi J. Hinton A. Forgac M. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2005; 37: 393-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Composed of a soluble V1 complex that hydrolyzes ATP and an integral membrane V0 complex that forms the proton channel, V-ATPase couples ATP hydrolysis to the translocation of protons from the cytosol to the lumen of late endosomes, multivesicular bodies, and lysosomes (35Beyenbach K.W. Wieczorek H. J. Exp. Biol. 2006; 209: 577-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar, 37Sun-Wada G.-H. Wada Y. Futai M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1658: 106-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). V-ATPase-dependent luminal acidification provides the necessary condition for lysosomal degradative enzymes to perform their functions. Moreover, acidification is also required for endosomal trafficking (37Sun-Wada G.-H. Wada Y. Futai M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1658: 106-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 38Johnson L.S. Dunn K.W. Pytowski B. McGraw T.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 1251-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), best demonstrated by a recent report that V-ATPase allows the recruitment of Arf6 and ARNO to the endosomal membrane for sorting to the multivesicular body and lysosome (39Hurtado-Lorenzo A. Skinner M. El Annan J. Futai M. Sun-Wada G.H. Bourgoin S. Casanova J. Wildeman A. Bechoua S. Ausiello D.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 124-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). We show here that TNFR1 activates the 43-kDa endosomal caspase-8 in Rb-MI cells, but Bid is not cleaved. However, Bid cleavage is rescued either by the knockdown of Rb-MI or by the inhibition of V-ATPase. Cell Culture—Fibroblasts derived from Rb+/+ (Rb-wt) and RbMI/MI (Rb-MI) mouse embryos were immortalized through the 3T3 passage protocol. The Caspase-8-/- and Caspase-8+/+ MEFs (40Varfolomeev E.E.

MEFs were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin/streptomycin, and 0.05% β-mercaptoethanol. Cells were routinely treated with 10 ng/ml recombinant human TNF (hTNF) plus 2.5 μg/ml CHX for 5 h at 37 °C unless noted otherwise. Antibodies and Chemicals—Rb antibodies used are rabbit anti-Rb (851) raised against the C-terminal fragment (residues 768–928) of Rb (20Welch P.J. Wang J.Y. Cell. 1993; 75: 779-790Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar) and anti-Rb from Pharmingen (554136); rat anti-caspase-8 (1G12) and rat anti-FADD (12E7) were from Alexis Biochemicals; rabbit anti-Smac was from Chemicon; goat anti-Bid and rabbit anti-Cox-IV were from Biovision; goat-anti-ATP6V1B1 (N-20), rabbit-anti-Mcl-1 (S-19), and rabbit anti-TRADD (H-278) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA); rabbit anti-phospho-c-Jun, mouse anti-cleaved caspase-3 (5A1), and rabbit anti-PARP1 were from Cell Signaling Technology; mouse anti-cytochrome c antibody was from BD Biosciences; biotin-VAD-fmk was from Kamiya; the caspase-8 fluorometric assay kit was from Biovision; the caspase-3 fluorometric assay kit was from Molecular Probes; the TUNEL staining kit was obtained from BD Biosciences; recombinant human and mouse TNF were from R & D Systems; MG-132 and cathepsin inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-YY-fmk were from Calbiochem; and bafilomycin A1, concanamycin A, and carbonyl cyanide 4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone (FCCP) were from Sigma. Western Blot—Whole cell lysates were prepared in radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol) plus protease inhibitor (from Sigma); 50–100 μg of total protein were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk/TBST (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20), and incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. Membranes were washed three times for 10 min each in TBST and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1–3 h at room temperature. After three 10-min washings, membranes were incubated with enhanced ECL reagent (from Pierce) for 1 min and exposed to x-ray films. To detect Rb protein in MEFs, 5 μg of anti-Rb (851) was mixed with 1 mg of whole cell lysate, and the immune complex was collected on protein A-Sepharose, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and then immunoblotted with anti-Rb antibody from Pharmingen. Propidium Iodide Uptake—Cells were trypsinized and resuspended in 500 μl of phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 μg/ml propidium iodide, incubated for 10 min at room temperature, and immediately analyzed by flow cytometry, counting at least 10,000 events/sample. For each treatment condition, triplicate samples were analyzed, from which the average percentage of propidium iodide-positive cells was calculated. DEVDase and IETDase Assay—Cells were lysed in PIPES/CHAPS buffer (10 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5), 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA) and clarified by centrifugation. 100 μg of total protein was incubated with 50 μm Ac-DEVD-AMC or Ac-IETD-AFC for 60 min at 37 °C. Fluorometric detection of AMC and AFC was performed in triplicates by excitation at 360 nm/emission at 460 nm (AMC) or excitation at 400 nm/emission at 505 nm (AFC). Cell Fractionation—Cells were trypsinized, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in mannitol/sucrose buffer (210 mm mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 0.5 mm EDTA) plus protease inhibitor and broken up by passage through a 22.5-gauge needle. Heavy membrane fractions (containing mitochondria) were pelleted by centrifugation. 100 μg of the supernatant was resolved on a 14% SDS-polyacrylamide gel followed by immunoblotting with anti-cytochrome c or anti-Samc. In Vitro Cytochrome c Release Assay—Freshly isolated liver mitochondria were combined with cytosolic extracts from untreated or TNF-treated Rb-wt or Rb-MI cells diluted in KCl buffer (125 mm KCl (pH 7.4), 10 mm HEPES-KOH, 5 mm Na2HPO4, 4 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA) and incubated for 45 min at 37 °C under gentle agitation. Mitochondria were pelleted by centrifugation. The supernatants and the pellets were separately analyzed for cytochrome c and Cox-IV by immunoblotting. In Vivo Affinity Labeling of Caspase-8—We adopted the method described by Tu et al. (41Tu S. McStay G.P. Boucher L.M. Mak T. Beere H.M. Green D.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 72-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) to label activated caspase-8 in cells. Briefly, 1 × 107 cells were trypsinized, centrifuged, and resuspended in 4 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum with 50 μm biotin-VAD-fmk. After 1 h of incubation at 37 °C, 10 ng/ml hTNF plus CHX (2.5 μg/ml) were added. Cells were harvested at the indicated time and lysed in 0.5 ml of radioimmune precipitation buffer, and 1 mg of total proteins were incubated with 50 μl of streptavidin/Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C overnight. The beads were washed with radioimmune precipitation buffer and boiled in 25 μl of 3× SDS sample buffer, the supernatant was resolved by SDS-PAGE, and caspase-8 was detected by immunoblotting. Synchronization of Endocytosis—Rb-wt or Rb-MI cells were first incubated with different doses of hTNF/CHX at 4 °C for 90 min and then shifted to 37 °C for different amounts of time. Cells were subjected to either cell death assay by propidium iodide uptake or DEVDase and IETDase assay. Dextran Sulfate Sodium (DSS)-induced Colonic Apoptosis in Mice—Rb+/+, Rb+/MI, or RbMI/MI mice were fed water containing 3% DSS (Mr 36,000–50,000 from Sigma). At 56 h into DSS feeding, they were injected intraperitoneally with either bafilomycin A1 at a concentration of 25 ng/g body weight or vehicle. Mice were sacrificed 16 h later, and colonic tissues were collected in a roll, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 2 days, embedded into paraffin blocks, cut into 5-μm sections, deparaffined, and TUNEL-labeled. Fluorescent images of labeled sections were captured by CCD camera; TUNEL-positive nuclei were counted in at least 25 crypts per tissue samples. All animal studies were approved by the University of California San Diego institutional animal care and use committee. Lysosomal pH Measurement—We adopted the method described by Trombetta et al. (42Trombetta E.S. Ebersold M. Garrett W. Pypaert M. Mellman I. Science. 2003; 299: 1400-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar) to measure the luminal pH of endosomes and lysosomes. Briefly, 10,000 Rb-wt or Rb-MI mouse fibroblasts were plated per well in a 96-well plate. After overnight culture, cells were loaded with the pH-sensitive FITC-dextran (Sigma) for 1 h at 37 °C, followed by treatment with hTNF/CHX or bafilomycin A1 (200 nm) for 5 h. At the end of the experiment, excess FITC-dextran was removed by extensive washing with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and the wells were replaced with phosphate-buffered saline. The fluorescence emitted at 520 nm was recorded at two excitation wavelengths, 450 and 490 nm, using a SpectraMax Gemini fluorescence plate reader. The pH values were determined by comparing the fluorescence signals with a standard curve constructed for FITC-dextran in phosphate/citrate buffers of different pH values between 4.0 and 8.0. DNA Microarray—Rb-MI or Rb-wt cells were subjected to different treatments, and then the total RNA was extracted, and the cRNA probes were synthesized and labeled with biotin (for Affymetrix GeneChip® (MGU74A)) or Cy5 or Cy3 (for Agilent mouse whole genome array (G4112A)). Array hybridization, data collection, and analysis were conducted using protocols and programs supplied by the manufacturers and indicated in the figures and tables. siRNA Experiments—Sense and antisense RNA oligonucleotides corresponding to the target sequence for mouse Rb (GUUGAUAAUGCUAUGUCAA), mouse ATP6V1B1 (TCCACCTCAGTCCTATATA), and LacZ (AACGTACGCGGAATACTTCGA) were synthesized and annealed by Ambion. Uniqueness of individual target sequences was confirmed by a BLAST search of the mouse genomic plus transcript data base. Transfection of synthetic siRNA was performed using Lipofectamine reagent with standard procedures. 48 h after transfection, cells were collected, and target protein levels were analyzed. Cotransfection of Cy3-labeled siRNA duplexes was performed to determine transfection efficiency when necessary. TNFR1-induced Type-2 Apoptotic Pathway Is Blocked in Rb-MI Cells—We have previously shown that Rb-MI mouse fibroblasts are resistant to apoptosis induced by the type-1 TNF receptor (TNFR1), which is activated by human TNF or an anti-TNFR1 agonist antibody (30Chau B.N. Borges H.L. Chen T.T. Masselli A. Hunton I.C. Wang J.Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 757-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Consistent with previous results, hTNF (activates only the mouse TNFR1) or mouse TNF/CHX (mTNF; activates TNFR1 and R2) led to caspase activation measured by the cleavage of DEVD-AMC or IETD-AFC in Rb-wt cells (Fig. 1, A and B). In Rb-MI fibroblasts, mTNF/CHX but not hTNF/CHX caused caspase activation (Fig. 1, A and B). We also measured the IETDase activity, which is mostly mediated by caspase-8 (43Martin D.A. Siegel R.M. Zheng L. Lenardo M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4345-4349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar), at several concentrations of mTNF and hTNF. With the Rb-wt cells, the half-maximum IETDase measured at 5 h after stimulation was observed at a ∼10 ng/ml concentration of either hTNF or mTNF, although the maximal levels of IETDase were higher in mTNF/CHX-treated Rb-wt cells. With the Rb-MI cells, the IETDase activity stimulated by mTNF/CHX was about 2-fold lower than that found in Rb-wt cells at every mTNF concentration tested (Fig. 1C). With hTNF, however, Rb-MI cells appeared nonresponsive, with no detectable stimulation of IETDase at hTNF concentrations up to 80 ng/ml (Fig. 1C). We have previously shown that hTNF/CHX-induced cytochrome c release is defective in Rb-MI cells (30Chau B.N. Borges H.L. Chen T.T. Masselli A. Hunton I.C. Wang J.Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 757-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1D, cytosolic Smac and cytochrome c were detected in Rb-wt cells treated with hTNF/CHX or mTNF/CHX, but their release only occurred in mTNF/CHX-treated Rb-MI cells. Consistent with the role of Bid cleavage in TNF-induced cytochrome c release (34Li H. Zhu H. Xu C.J. Yuan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 491-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3798) Google Scholar, 44Luo X. Budihardjo I. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1998; 94: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3085) Google Scholar), we observed Bid cleavage in Rb-wt cells treated with hTNF/CHX or mTNF/CHX, but Bid was only cleaved in mTNF/CHX-treated Rb-MI cells (Fig. 1E). To further examine the cytochrome c release defect in Rb-MI cells, we prepared lysates from hTNF/CHX-treated Rb-wt and Rb-MI cells and incubated them with liver mitochondria. Cytochrome c release activity was detected in lysates from hTNF/CHX-treated Rb-wt cells but not those from Rb-MI cells (Fig. 1F). The lysates of Rb-MI cells, either before or after hTNF/CHX treatment, did not interfere with cytochrome c release induced by a recombinant NC-Bid (45Kuwana T. Mackey M.R. Perkins G. Ellisman M.H. Latterich M. Schneiter R. Green D.R. Newmeyer D.D. Cell. 2002; 111: 331-342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1237) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1G), suggesting that the defect is not caused by an inhibitor of tBid in Rb-MI lysates. In keeping with this conclusion, we found that hTNF/CHX induced similar modifications of Mcl-1, an inhibitor of cytochrome c release, in Rb-wt and Rb-MI cells (supplemental Fig. 1B). We also prepared liver mitochondria from Rb-MI mice and found them to be competent in releasing cytochrome c in response to lysates from hTNF/CHX-treated Rb-wt fibroblasts (Fig. 1H). Taken together, these results show that TNFR1-induced Bid cleavage is defective in Rb-MI cells and that the lack of tBid rather than the accumulation of inhibitors accounted for the cytochrome c release defect in hTNF/CHX-treated Rb-MI cells. TNFR1-induced Cleavage of Rb Requires Caspase-8—TNF-induced Bid cleavage is dependent on caspase-8 (34Li H. Zhu H. Xu C.J. Yuan J.

Treatment with hTNF/CHX did not cause the cleavage of Rb, PARP1, or caspase-3 in"
https://openalex.org/W2092686644,"Background During S. pombe S-phase, initiation of DNA replication occurs at multiple sites (origins) that are enriched with AT-rich sequences, at various times. Current studies of genome-wide DNA replication profiles have focused on the DNA replication timing and origin location. However, the replication and/or firing efficiency of the individual origins on the genomic scale remain unclear. Methodology/Principal Findings Using the genome-wide ORF-specific DNA microarray analysis, we show that in S. pombe, individual origins fire with varying efficiencies and at different times during S-phase. The increase in DNA copy number plotted as a function of time is approximated to the near-sigmoidal model, when considering the replication start and end timings at individual loci in cells released from HU-arrest. Replication efficiencies differ from origin to origin, depending on the origin's firing efficiency. We have found that DNA replication is inefficient early in S-phase, due to inefficient firing at origins. Efficient replication occurs later, attributed to efficient but late-firing origins. Furthermore, profiles of replication timing in cds1Δ cells are abnormal, due to the failure in resuming replication at the collapsed forks. The majority of the inefficient origins, but not the efficient ones, are found to fire in cds1Δ cells after HU removal, owing to the firing at the remaining unused (inefficient) origins during HU treatment. Conclusions/Significance Taken together, our results indicate that efficient DNA replication/firing occurs late in S-phase progression in cells after HU removal, due to efficient late-firing origins. Additionally, checkpoint kinase Cds1p is required for maintaining the efficient replication/firing late in S-phase. We further propose that efficient late-firing origins are essential for ensuring completion of DNA duplication by the end of S-phase."

In that way, its inhibitory function on the transcription factor AP-1, indispensable to maintain human papillomavirus (HPV) gene expression is relieved. Using HPV-18 positive HeLa cells as a model system, we show that ectopic expression of RARβ2 is able to down-regulate HPV-18 transcription by selectively abrogating the binding of AP-1 to the viral regulatory region in a ligand-independent manner. This resulted in down-regulation of the viral mRNAs at the level of initiation of transcription. Decreased oncogene expression was accompanied by a re-induction of cell cycle inhibitory proteins such as p53, p21CIP1, and p27KIP as well as by a cessation of cellular growth. Reduced transcriptional activity as a consequence of AP-1 reduction by selective c-Jun degradation apparently targets the HPV-18 regulatory region for epigenetic modification such as de novo methylation and nucleosomal condensation. This mechanism is otherwise counterbalanced by active and abundant viral transcription in malignant cells, because RARβ2 itself becomes inactivated during cervical carcinogenesis. Hence, our study shows that the temporal co-existence of a potential repressor and viral oncoproteins is mutually exclusive and provides evidence of a cross-talk between a nuclear receptor, AP-1, and the epigenetic machinery.

The transcription of the viral oncogenes E6 and E7 is controlled by the viral upstream regulatory region (URR), harboring the tissue-specific enhancer and promoter elements (4Butz K. Hoppe-Seyler F.

As shown for many malignant cells, including HPV-positive cervical cancer cells, the retinoic acid receptor (RAR) β2 gene (RARβ2), the most potent RAR involved in suppression of tumor-related phenotypes (6Lin F.

In other words, the absence of RARβ provides a selective advantage during multistep progression to cervical cancer, because the gene is obviously not compatible with unscheduled cell proliferation (9Ivanova T.

Schwarz E. Int. J. Cancer. 2000; 85: 289-295PubMed Google Scholar). Together with other isotypes of retinoid acid receptors (α and γ) or retinoid X receptors (RXR), which are encoded by different genes (13Altucci L. Gronemeyer H. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2001; 1: 181-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar), the biological and therapeutic outcome of retinoids (e.g. all-trans-retinoic acid or 9-cis-retinoic acid) is either dependent on RAR homodimers or heterodimer formation with RXRs, which in turn bind to retinoic acid response elements or retinoid X response elements within their respective target promoters (14Lefebvre P. Martin P.J. Flajollet S. Dedieu S. Billaut X. Lefebvre B. Vitam. Horm. 2005; 70: 199-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Both RARs and RXRs possess trans-repressive function on the AP-1 in a ligand-dependent manner. AP-1 is a key element in a regulatory network, playing not only a fundamental role in transcriptional regulation of various HPVs (15Hoppe-Seyler F. Butz K. Mol. Carcinog. 1994; 10: 134-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 16Bernard H.U. Apt D. Arch. Dermatol. 1994; 130: 210-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), but also in cell proliferation and tumor induction (5Soto U. Das B.C. Lengert M. Finzer P. zur Hausen H. Rösl F. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3187-3198Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 17Shaulian E. Karin M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: E131-E136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2173) Google Scholar). In the presence of ligands, RARs or RAR/RXR can negatively affect AP-1 either by a direct interaction with Jun/Fos family members (18Suzukawa K. Colburn N.H. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 2181-2190Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) or by disrupting Jun-Fos dimerization (19Zhou X.F. Shen X.Q. Shemshedini L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 276-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Retinoic receptors can also compete with the recruitment of transcriptional co-activators (20Kamei Y. Xu L. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Kurokawa R. Gloss B. Lin S.C. Heyman R.A. Rose D.W. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 1996; 85: 403-414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1917) Google Scholar) or inhibit the c-JUN N-terminal kinase (JNK), in turn preventing phosphorylation-dependent activation of c-JUN (21Dedieu S. Lefebvre P. Cell. Signal. 2006; 18: 889-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Moreover, as previously reported, we have unraveled a mechanism that explains how RARβ can also diminish AP-1 activity even in the absence of any ligand. Ectopic re-expression of RARβ abrogates AP-1 binding by a post-transcriptional mechanism where c-JUN is selectively degraded and not substituted in the AP-1 complex by other Jun family members. This uncovers a cross-talk between AP-1 and non-liganded RARβ and explains how AP-1 is turned off in the absence of an exogenous stimulus, but can be activated by the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway upon stimulation (22De-Castro Arce J. Soto U. van Riggelen J. Schwarz E. zur Hausen H.Z. Rösl F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45408-45416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). To follow up this functional interplay, the present study was aimed to investigate further consequences of ectopic RARβ expression in cervical carcinoma cells. Evidence is provided that AP-1 is the only factor involved in the transcriptional regulation of the HPV-18 URR that is quantitatively affected. Re-expression of RARβ was accompanied by a strong transcriptional down-regulation of the viral E6/E7 oncogenes and by an induction of cell cycle inhibitory proteins. Continuous availability of transcription factors can protect CpG islands from DNA methyltransferase activity (23Han L. Lin I.G. Hsieh C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3416-3424Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Conversely, deficiency of activating proteins (e.g. AP-1), followed by a reduced transcriptional activity, enhances the probability that regulatory regions become targets for de novo DNA methylation. Such a scenario seems to be the case after ectopic RARβ expression and subsequent AP-1 reduction, where HPV-18 E6/E7 transcription becomes down-regulated. Monitoring epigenetic modifications of the viral URR, our results establish a link between RARβ-mediated AP-1 trans-repression, de novo DNA methylation, and transcriptional silencing of integrated copies of HPV-18 in cervical cancer cells. Cell Lines and Treatments—The parental cervical carcinoma cell line HeLa and the stably transfected HeLa RARβ clones (12Geisen C. Denk C. Kupper J.H. Schwarz E. Int. J. Cancer. 2000; 85: 289-295PubMed Google Scholar) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma), supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Sigma). To keep the selection pressure, the clones were grown in a media containing 750 μg/ml G-418 (Invitrogen). For retinoic acid treatment, cells were incubated with 10 μm all-trans-retinoic acid (Sigma) as previously described (22De-Castro Arce J. Soto U. van Riggelen J. Schwarz E. zur Hausen H.Z. Rösl F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45408-45416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Decitabine (5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine, Calbiochem) treatment was carried out for 4 days, adding 1 μm final concentration to the medium. Decitabine was diluted in 0.005% (v/v) of acetic acid. Culture medium was replaced daily. Control cells received medium containing 0.005% (v/v) acetic acid. Transient Transfections—2.5 × 106 cells were plated on 60-cm2 dishes and transfected with 2 μg of a cytomegalovirus-driven MEKK1Δ cDNA. MEKK1Δ is a constitutive active truncated form of the MEK kinase-1 (mitogen-activated/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase, MEKK1), which lacks parts of the N-terminal regulatory domain (24Lin A. Minden A. Martinetto H. Claret F.X. Lange-Carter C. Mercurio F. Johnson G.L. Karin M. Science. 1995; 268: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). Transfection was performed using “Effectene Transfection Reagent” (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection. SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting—Protein extracts were prepared as described previously (22De-Castro Arce J. Soto U. van Riggelen J. Schwarz E. zur Hausen H.Z. Rösl F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45408-45416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Twenty-five μg of nuclear proteins were separated in 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, electrotransferred to Immobilon-P membranes (polyvinylidene difluoride, Millipore) and probed with the following antibodies: HPV-18 E7 (sc-1590, lot D228), RARβ (sc-552, lot F081), p21CIP1 (sc-397, lot I080), CDK-2 (sc-6248, lot L239), cyclin D1 (sc-246, Lot D129), p53 (sc-126, lot B261), and c-Jun (sc-1694, lot I3004) all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. p27KIP (catalog number k25020-050, lot 610241) was purchased from Transduction Laboratories. Bands were visualized with anti-rabbit, anti-goat, or anti-mouse IgG antibody, conjugated with horseradish peroxidase using ECL detection system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Equal protein transfer and loading was routinely monitored by re-incubating the blots with an actin-specific monoclonal antibody (69100, lot 7979E, ICN). DNA Analysis and Southern Blotting—Total DNA was extracted according to standard methods. 5 μg was digested with HindIII (5 units/μg for 3 h), electrophoresed in a 1% agarose gel, blotted overnight on nylon membranes (Gene Screen, PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and hybridized with a radioactive labeled HPV-18 DNA probe (see below). RNA Analysis, Northern Blotting, and RT-PCR—RNA was isolated with the “Absolutely RNA RT-PCR miniprep kit” (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA was separated on 1% agarose gels in the presence of ethidium bromide under non-denaturating conditions (5Soto U. Das B.C. Lengert M. Finzer P. zur Hausen H. Rösl F. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3187-3198Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), blotted on nylon membranes (GeneScreen, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and hybridized with radioactive labeled probes (25Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16645) Google Scholar). Bands were quantified with a GE Healthcare PhosphorImager using the ImageQuant program as software. cDNA was obtained from 1 μg of RNA using random primers (Roche) and SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) in a volume of 20 μl, following the manufacturer′s recommendations. One μl of the RT was amplified for 35 cycles consisting of 30 s at 94 °C, 45 s at the corresponding annealing temperature, and 30 s at 72 °C, with a final extension of 10 min. The following primers were used: for matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1), 5′-TGCTGAAACCCTGAAGGTG-3′ and 5′-CTGCTTGACCCTCAGAGACC-3′ (annealing temperature 55 °C); for GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) 5′-TGGATATTGTTGCCATCAATGACC-3′ and 5′-GATGGCATGGACTGTGGTCATG-3′ (26Griffiths D.J. Venables P.J. Weiss R.A. Boyd M.T. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 2866-2872Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (annealing temperature 65 °C). PCR products were analyzed in 2% agarose gels. Hybridization Probes—Plasmid pHPV18 represents the unit-length genome of HPV-18, cloned in pBR322. pHF-βA1 harbors an approximately full-length cDNA insert of the human fibroblast β-actin gene (5Soto U. Das B.C. Lengert M. Finzer P. zur Hausen H. Rösl F. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3187-3198Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Oligonucleotides were generated in an Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA) synthesizer using phosphoramitide chemistry and further purified by high performance liquid chromatography. For electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) the following oligonucleotides were used: AP-1 consensus, 5′-CGCTTGATGACTCAGCCGGAA-3′ (27Lee W. Mitchell P. Tjian R. Cell. 1987; 49: 741-752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1362) Google Scholar); AP-1 (HPV-18 enhancer, position 7596–7620), 5′-CGCACCTGGTATTAGTCATTTTCC-3′; AP-1 (HPV-18 promoter, position 7781–7805), 5′-GAACTATAATATGACTAAGCTGTGC-3′; keratinocyte-specific transcription factor-1 (KRF-1, HPV-18 enhancer, position 7643–7672), 5′-TGCTTGCATAACTATATCCACTCCCTATGT-3′; Sp-1 (HPV-18 promoter, position 20–46), 5′-GTAGTATATAAAAAAGGGAGTGACCGA-3′ (4Butz K. Hoppe-Seyler F. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 6476-6486Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and Oct-1 consensus, 5′-TGTCGAATGCAAATCACTAGAA-3′ (28Scheidereit C. Cromlish J.A. Gerster T. Kawakami K. Balmaceda C.G. Currie R.A. Roeder R.G. Nature. 1988; 336: 551-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Annealed oligonucleotides were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences, 3000 Ci/mmol) and T4 polynucleotide kinase. Binding reaction was performed as described (22De-Castro Arce J. Soto U. van Riggelen J. Schwarz E. zur Hausen H.Z. Rösl F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45408-45416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In the case of AP-1 HPV-18 promoter, only 0.2 μg of poly(dI-dC) per reaction was employed. For monitoring AP-1 composition in supershift assays, 2 μg of the following antibodies were used: the phosphorylated form of c-JUN (sc-822X, lot H199), c-FOS (sc-52X, lot E286), and FRA-1 (sc-605X, lot F229, all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The nuclear extracts were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. DNA-protein complexes were resolved on 5.5% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels (29:1 cross-linking ration), dried, and exposed overnight to Fuji medical x-ray films. Retarded bands were quantified with a GE Healthcare PhosphorImager using ImageQuant. For EMSAs of methylated AP-1, 3 different HPV-18 enhancer oligos harboring the AP-1 binding site including the HhaI recognition site(s) (gcgc) were applied: oligo 1 (position 7591–7620), 5′-TAAGgcgcACCTGGTATTAGTCATTTTCC-3′; oligo 2 (position 7580–7620), 5′-TTTGgcgcATATAAGgcgcACCTGGTATTAGTCATTTTCC-3′; and oligo 3 (position 7602–7637), 5′-TGGTATTAGTCATTTTCCTGTCCAGGTgcgcTACA-3′. Annealed oligos were in vitro methylated using HhaI-methylase (New England Biolabs). Methylation Assay—Analysis of CpG sites for methylation within the HPV-18 URR and Ha-ras 3′-VTR were performed by methylation sensitive restriction digestion of genomic DNA followed by PCR. Two restriction digestions per genomic DNA sample were prepared, one for HhaI (New England Biolabs) and one for HpaII (New England Biolabs) (see overview in Fig. 4, A and B). Samples were incubated 16 h at 37 °C. The digested DNA was purified and PCR was performed to analyze the methylation status. The following primers were used: 5′-CAATTGGCGCTCTTTGGCGCA-3′ and 5′-GCATAAACTATGTATGCACAGC-3′ (HPV-18 enhancer); 5′-GGAACTTACAGAGGTATTTG-3′ and 5′-CTGGCCTCTATAGTGCCC-3′ (intragenic E6-primer); 5′-GGGAGCAAGTCAGGAAAGGTG-3′ and 5′-GCCCTGGGCTCTCCATAGCCTTTGGG-3′ (Ha-ras 3′-VTR), 5′-GCTGCCAACCTCGTCCACTCC-3′ and 5′-GCCAAGAATGGCAGACATAGGGACC-3′ (DNA loading control). Restriction Enzyme Accessibility Assay on Cross-linked and Native Chromatin—1 × 107 cells were fixed with 1% formaldehyde and cross-linking was stopped by adding 0.125 m glycine as described below (see “ChIP assays”). After centrifugation, 1 × 106 nuclei were resuspended in 1× MfeI restriction enzyme buffer (New England Biolabs) supplemented with 0.3% SDS and incubated 1 h at 37 °C to remove uncross-linked proteins. 1.8% Triton X-100 was added for 10 min to sequester SDS. Finally, 1× bovine serum albumin and 200 units of restriction enzyme (MfeI) were added and the digestion was incubated overnight at 37 °C. Next day, proteins were digested by 100 μg/ml proteinase K at 37 °C and the DNA was uncross-linked by 0.3 m NaCl at 65 °C. Digested DNA was purified by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. For native nuclei isolation, 1 × 107 cells were seeded. Next day, cells were washed in phosphate-buffered serum supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (5Soto U. Das B.C. Lengert M. Finzer P. zur Hausen H. Rösl F. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3187-3198Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 29Soto U. Denk C. Finzer P. Hutter K.J. zur Hausen H. Rösl F. Int. J. Cancer. 2000; 86: 811-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), scrapped, and resuspended in 500 μl of TBS buffer (150 mm NaCl, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 3 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2) supplemented with proteases and phosphatases inhibitor (5Soto U. Das B.C. Lengert M. Finzer P. zur Hausen H. Rösl F. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3187-3198Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 29Soto U. Denk C. Finzer P. Hutter K.J. zur Hausen H. Rösl F. Int. J. Cancer. 2000; 86: 811-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Cell lysis was done by adding 1% Tween 20 for 1 h at 4 °C. Nuclei were collected by centrifugation for 15 min at 5000 × g at 4 °C. Subsequently, 1 × 106 nuclei were resuspended in 1× restriction enzyme buffer, 1× bovine serum albumin, and 200 units of the restriction enzyme. The digestion was incubated at 37 °C overnight, the DNA was isolated as described above and PCR amplified (30O'Neill L.P. Turner B.M. Methods. 2003; 31: 76-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) (see below “PCR Analysis of Immunoprecipitated Chromatin”). As control for MfeI functionality, 10 μg of genomic DNA was digested (5 units/μg of DNA) for 2 h at 37 °C. ChIP Assays—1 × 107 cells were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde, stopped by 0.125 m glycine and briefly washed with phosphate-buffered serum, trypsinized 20 min at 37 °C, and scrapped off. Cell pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of cell lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 10 mm NaCl, 0.2% Nonidet P-40) supplemented with proteases and phosphatases inhibitors (5Soto U. Das B.C. Lengert M. Finzer P. zur Hausen H. Rösl F. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3187-3198Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 29Soto U. Denk C. Finzer P. Hutter K.J. zur Hausen H. Rösl F. Int. J. Cancer. 2000; 86: 811-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). 1.5 × 106 nuclei per ChIP were enzymatic sheared (Active Motif enzymatic shearing kit) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After shearing, an aliquot of chromatin (equivalent to 25 μg of DNA) was removed and stored at -20 °C. Chromatin fractions were pre-cleared adding 40 μl of protein A-agarose blocked with 40 μg of salmon sperm during 2 h at 4 °Con a rotating plate. The suspensions were then centrifuged to discard nonspecifically bound chromatin fragments. Supernatants (equivalent to 25 μg of DNA) were incubated with 1.5 μg of RNA polymerase II antibody (Abcam, ab-5131-50, lot 37712) or 2 μg of rabbit IgG antibody (Santa Cruz, sc-2027, lot C1605). Volumes were adjusted to 500 μl using ChIP buffer (16.7 mm Tris, pH 8, 167 mm NaCl, 1.2 mm EDTA, pH 8, 1.1% Triton X-100, and 0.01% SDS) supplemented with proteases and phosphatases inhibitors. Next day, ChIPs were incubated with 40 μl of blocked protein A-agarose beads for an additional period of 3 h. The immunocomplex containing chromatin fragments/α-RNA pol II/protein A-agarose was recovered by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 2 min and washed once with buffer 1 (500 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8, 5 mm EDTA, pH 8 and 0.5% Nonidet P-40), twice with buffer 2 (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 8, 1% Triton X-100, and 0.1% SDS), twice with buffer 3 (250 mm LiCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate), and finally twice with TE (10 mm Tris, pH 8, and 5 mm EDTA, pH 8). The immunoselected chromatin was eluted from protein A-agarose by adding 250 μl of elution buffer (1% SDS, 100 mm NaHCO3). The eluted chromatin was diluted 1:1 in a uncross-linking buffer (320 mm NaCl, 80 mm Tris, pH 8, 20 mm EDTA, pH 8, and 100 μg/ml proteinase K) and incubated overnight at 65 °C. DNA samples were purified and used for semiquantitative PCR. We routinely tested the specificity and linearity of chromatin immunoprecipitation by semiquantitative PCR. Utilizing RNA polymerase II antibodies for ChIP analyses of the GAPDH promoter (euchromatin) in comparison with the MYO D coding region (facultative heterochromatin), the following primers were used: GAPDH promoter, 5′-CCCAACTTTCCCGCCTCTC-3′ and 5′-CAGCCGCCTGGTTCAACTG-3′ (31Jiang G. Yang F. Sanchez C. Ehrlich M. J. Cell. Biochem. 2004; 93: 286-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar); MYO D coding region, 5′-CCGCTTTCCTTAACCACAAA-3′ and 5′-CGGGTCGTCATAGAAGTCGT-3′. For double ChIP experiments, chromatin immunoprecipitation was first carried out with RNA pol II antibodies and the trapped protein-DNA complexes were eluted in 50 μl of buffer (1% SDS, 100 mm NaHCO3). The eluted chromatin was diluted 1:10 in ChIP buffer and 20 μg of P-c-Jun antibodies (sc-822X, lot E0704, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were added. The second precipitation was carried out overnight at 4 °C and immunocomplexes were pulled down and washed as described above. PCR Analysis of Immunoprecipitated Chromatin—Input, IgG, and RNA pol II fractions were analyzed by PCR with the appropriate pair of primers to amplify products of 200–300 bp in length, corresponding to the coding region of the HPV-18 E6, E7, or E6/E7 oncogenes (see scheme Fig. 1C). The following primer sequences were used: E6 coding region, 5′-GGAACTTACAGAGGTATTTG-3′ and 5′-CTGGCCTCTATAGTGCCC-3′ (300 bp product); E7 coding region, 5′-ATGCATGGACCTAAGGCAAC-3′ and 5′-AGGTCGTCTGCTGAGCTTTC-3′ (248 bp product); and E6/E7 coding region, 5′-CGACAGGAACGACTCCAACGAC-3′ and 5′-CGTCGGGCTGGTAAATGTTGATG-3′ (207 bp product). PCR fragments were size-fractionated in 2% agarose gels. Constitutive Expression of Non-liganded RARβ in HeLa Cells—Reconstitution of RARβ expression under the control of the β-actin promoter in cervical carcinoma cells (Fig. 1A, right) resulted in a selective reduction of viral transcription (Fig. 1A, left) and a strong cessation of cellular growth (data not shown). Consistent with the decrease of HPV-18 on the RNA level, there was also a decline of the corresponding viral oncoprotein E7 (Fig. 1A, right). Viral down-regulation in the absence of any ligand occurred to the same extent as detected in non-transfected HeLa cells, incubated with pharmacological doses of all-trans-retinoic acid for 3 days. Note that viral transcription was not completely suppressed, because at least a certain threshold amount of oncogene expression is required to maintain cell proliferation (32von Knebel Doeberitz M. Oltersdorf T. Schwarz E. Gissmann L. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 3780-3786PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, RARβ restoration was also not altering the HPV-18 copy number due to the inherent karyotype instability of many cancer cells (33Duesberg P. Rasnick D. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2000; 47: 81-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), because Southern blotting revealed no rearrangement or loss of viral genomes of the clones when compared with parental HeLa cells (see supplementary Fig. S1). To examine the consequence of constitutive RARβ expression on cell cycle regulatory proteins, Western blot analyses were performed. The results depicted in Fig. 1B show not only an increase of p53 and the cyclin-dependent inhibitors p21CIP1 and p27KIP, but also down-regulation of the mid-G1 cyclin D1. In contrast, no quantitative changes of the cyclin-dependent kinase-2 (CDK-2) could be discerned. Decline of HPV-18-specific mRNA can be either due to labilization and shortening of the cytoplasmic half-life or by direct suppression of viral URR-directed transcriptional activity (34Nafz J. De-Castro Arce J. Fleig V. Patzelt A. Mazurek S. Rösl F. Biochem. J. 2007; 403: 501-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). To discriminate between these possibilities and to quantify the actual transcription rate at the HPV-18 integration locus, chromatin immunoprecipitation against transcriptional"
https://openalex.org/W1974360325,"Axial elongation is a key morphogenetic process that serves to shape developing organisms. Tail extension in the ascidian larva represents a striking example of this process, wherein paraxially positioned muscle cells undergo elongation and differentiation independent of the segmentation process that characterizes the formation of paraxial mesoderm in vertebrates. Investigating the cell behaviors underlying the morphogenesis of muscle in ascidians may therefore reveal the evolutionarily conserved mechanisms operating during this process.A live cell imaging approach utilizing subcellularly-localized fluorescent proteins was employed to investigate muscle cell behaviors during tail extension in the ascidian Ciona intestinalis. Changes in the position and morphology of individual muscle cells were analyzed in vivo in wild type embryos undergoing tail extension and in embryos in which muscle development was perturbed. Muscle cells were observed to undergo elongation in the absence of positional reorganization. Furthermore, high-speed high-resolution live imaging revealed that the onset and progression of tail extension were characterized by the presence of dynamic and polarized actin-based protrusive activity at the plasma membrane of individual muscle cells.Our results demonstrate that in the Ciona muscle, tissue elongation resulted from gradual and coordinated changes in cell geometry and not from changes in cell topology. Proper formation of muscle cells was found to be necessary not only for muscle tissue elongation, but also more generally for completion of tail extension. Based upon the characterized dynamic changes in cell morphology and plasma membrane protrusive activity, a three-phase model is proposed to describe the cell behavior operating during muscle morphogenesis in the ascidian embryo."
https://openalex.org/W1994343905,"N-linked glycosylation begins in the endoplasmic reticulum with the synthesis of a highly conserved dolichol-linked oligosaccharide precursor. The UDP-GlcNAc glycosyltransferase catalyzing the second sugar addition of this precursor consists in most eukaryotes of at least two subunits, Alg14 and Alg13. Alg14 is a membrane protein that recruits the soluble Alg13 catalytic subunit from the cytosol to the face of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane where this reaction occurs. Here, we investigated the membrane topology of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Alg14 and its requirements for ER membrane association. Alg14 is predicted by most algorithms to contain one or more transmembrane spanning helices (transmembrane domains (TMDs)). We provide evidence that Alg14 contains a C-terminal cytosolic tail and an N terminus that resides within the ER lumen. However, we also demonstrate that Alg14 lacking this TMD is functional and remains peripherally associated with ER membranes, suggesting that additional domains can mediate ER association. These conclusions are based on the functional analysis of Alg13/Alg14 chimeras containing Alg13 fused at either end of Alg14 or truncated Alg14 variants lacking the predicted TMD; protease protection assays of Alg14 in intact ER membranes; and extraction of Alg14-containing ER membranes with high pH. These yeast Alg13-Alg14 chimeras recapitulate the phylogenetic diversity of Alg13-Alg14 domain arrangements that evolved in some protozoa. They encode single polypeptides containing an Alg13 domain fused to Alg14 domain in either orientation, including those lacking the Alg14 TMD. Thus, this Alg13-Alg14 UDP-GlcNAc transferase represents an unprecedented example of a bipartite glycosyltransferase that evolved by both fission and fusion.

Biochem. 2004; 73: 1019-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (1620) Google Scholar). The synthesis of this lipid-linked oligosaccharide (LLO) proceeds in two stages. In the first stage, seven sugars are added sequentially to dolichol pyrophosphate on the cytosolic face of the ER using cytosolic nucleotide sugar substrates. This dollinked intermediate then flips into the lumen of the ER where the next stage occurs, in which the next seven sugars are added from dol-linked sugar substrates (6Snider M.D. Rogers O.C. Cell. 1984; 36: 753-761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Once assembled, the Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 oligosaccharide core is transferred from the lipid to the protein by oligosaccharyltransferase. The protein-linked core oligosaccharide is further modified by ER enzymes and then extended by those that are encountered by nascent glycoproteins as they pass through the Golgi complex. Although mature N-linked glycans vary tremendously among eukaryotes, they all share this common core oligosaccharide whose conserved structure reflects the high degree of conservation of the twelve different Alg (asparagine-linked glycosylation) glycosyltransferases that catalyze LLO assembly. endoplasmic reticulum lipid-linked oligosaccharide dolichol transmembrane domain tobacco etch virus hemagglutinin carboxypeptidase Y The second step of LLO synthesis involves the addition of N-acetyl glucosamine (GlcNAc) from UDP-GlcNAc to Glc-NAc-PP-dol to produce GlcNAc2-PP-dol on the cytoplasmic surface of the ER membrane (7Sharma C.B.

Chem. 2001; 9: 1133-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The UDP-GlcNAc transferase that catalyzes this reaction is a very unusual glycosyltransferase. It is composed of at least two distinct polypeptides, Alg13 and Alg14, which were discovered by their distant homology to the bacterial MurG UDP-GlcNAc transferase (9Chantret I. Dancourt J. Barbat A. Moore S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9236-9242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 10Bickel T. Lehle L. Schwarz M. Aebi M. Jakob C.A. J. Biol.

MurG is involved in the cytoplasmic phase of bacterial peptidoglycan biosynthesis, catalyzing the transfer of GlcNAc from UDP-GlcNAc to lipid-linked N-acetylmuramoyl pentapeptide prior to its translocation to the periplasmic face of the bacterial membrane (12Ikeda M. Wachi M. Jung H.K. Ishino F. Matsuhashi M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 4014Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 13Bugg T.D. Walsh C.T. Nat. Reports. 1992; 9: 199-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). The C-terminal catalytic domain of MurG is homologous to Alg13 as well as other UDP-GlcNAc transferases, whereas the N-terminal lipid-acceptor domain is related to Alg14 (9Chantret I. Dancourt J. Barbat A. Moore S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9236-9242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Although Alg13 contains the highly conserved UDP-GlcNAc transferase catalytic domain, it lacks any hydrophobic membrane-spanning regions. Alg14 lacks any sequences predicted to play a direct role in sugar transfer but unlike MurG, is predicted to be an integral membrane protein containing one or more transmembrane-spanning domains (TMDs). Characterization of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae UDP-GlcNAc transferase has led to the model that Alg14 functions as a membrane anchor that recruits Alg13 to the cytosolic face of the ER, where catalysis of GlcNAc2-PP-dol occurs (10Bickel T.

Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 36254-36262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Although it is unknown if there are additional or accessory subunits of the yeast UDP-GlcNAc transferase, Alg14 is both necessary and sufficient for the ER localization of Alg13 (11Gao X.D. Tachikawa H. Sato T. Jigami Y. Dean N. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 36254-36262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Alg13 and Alg14 physically interact and, under normal conditions, are associated with the ER membrane. This physical interaction appears to be essential for catalysis of sugar transfer, because Alg13 that is not bound to Alg14 is inactive for sugar transfer (10Bickel T. Lehle L. Schwarz M. Aebi M. Jakob C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34500-34506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). ALG13 and ALG14 genes are highly conserved among eukaryotes. However, some protozoa encode a single polypeptide that contains an Alg13 and Alg14 domain instead of two separate polypeptides. Surprisingly, as described in this study, we found that these Alg13/Alg14 domains have fused in both orientations. Trypanosomes encode a single polypeptide containing an Alg13 domain at the C terminus of an Alg14 domain, while other organisms, for instance Entameoba histolytica (10Bickel T. Lehle L. Schwarz M. Aebi M. Jakob C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34500-34506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and Dictyostelium discoideum, encode a polypeptide that contains an Alg13 domain at the N terminus of an Alg14 domain. In these latter cases, however, the Alg14 domain lacks the predicted N-terminal TMD. The identification of these different Alg13/Alg14 proteins and their unusual domain structure raised the question of how these proteins can maintain their association with the ER membrane and motivated us to examine the membrane topology of Alg14. Here we describe the analysis of chimeric S. cerevisiae Alg13-Alg14 fusion proteins that mimic the proteins that naturally evolved in protozoa. Like their protozoa counterparts, we find that these S. cerevisiae chimeras are functional and associate with the ER membrane even when they lack the first strongly predicted Alg14 TMD. Protease protection assays allowed us to construct a tentative topological map of Alg14 that places the C terminus in the cytoplasm and the N terminus in the ER lumen. On the basis of results from membrane extraction experiments, our data also suggest that additional domains are required for the peripheral association of Alg14 with the ER. These findings and how they relate to proposed models of the ER topology of the UDP-GlcNAc transferase in eukaryotes are discussed. Yeast Strains and Media—Standard yeast media and genetic techniques were used for the growth and construction of yeast strains (14Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (2543) Google Scholar). Yeast strains were grown in yeast extract/peptone/adenine sulfate (YPA) or a minimal medium lacking uracil (-URA) or leucine (-LEU) containing either 2% glucose (D) or galactose (Gal). Yeast strains used in this study are listed in Table 1. W303-1A or W303-1B was used as the parental strain for the construction of all strains. SKY20 contains a replacement of the normal chromosomal ALG14 locus with a GAL1/10 promoter-driven ALG14 gene (PGAL1-ALG14) and in addition, contains sequences encoding the tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease recognition sequence (SENLYFQG) followed by a 10-amino acid linker (CQFRSDLYFI) between the TEV recognition sequence at the junction of an N-terminal triple HA epitope tag and the first methionine of Alg14. Epitope tagging of chromosomal loci used one-step PCR-mediated recombination (15Baudin A. Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Denouel A. Lacroute F. Cullin C.

Roos J. Dean N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3132-3140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). For immunoblot analyses, proteins (from equal cell equivalents) were separated on 8% (carboxypeptidase Y (CPY)) or 12% (Alg14 and Vrg4) SDS-PAGE gels, blotted on Immobilon-P polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore) and processed as described (18Gao X.D. Dean N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17718-17727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Proteins were detected using the following antibodies: 12CA5 to detect HA-tagged Alg14 protein; mouse anti-V-ATPase to detect the 60-kDa fragment of ATPase (Molecular Probes, 1:2000); rabbit anti-CPY (1:1500) (19Dean N. Pelham H.R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar); mouse anti-FLAG (Sigma) to detect FLAG-tagged Alg14 or -Alg13-Alg14 fusion proteins. Primary antibodies were visualized with secondary anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences) followed by chemiluminescence detection (ECL, GE Healthcare). Isolation of ER or Golgi-enriched Membrane Fractions—For preparation of whole cell lysates used for membrane isolation, 15–20 A600 units of cells (harvested at an A600 of 1–2) were washed three times in 0.5 ml of cold JR lysis buffer (0.1 m sorbitol, 50 mm potassium acetate, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and lysed by vortexing with glass beads in 200 μl of the same buffer by five repeated cycles of vortexing (30 s) and incubating on ice (30 s). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation for 5 min at 3000 × g. ER and vacuolar membranes were pelleted by centrifugation of the resulting lysate at 18,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Golgi membranes were enriched by centrifugation of the resulting supernatant at 100,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C in a Beckman Optima TL ultracentrifuge as described previously (18Gao X.D. Dean N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17718-17727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The resulting supernatant contained soluble proteins. For protease protection assays (see below), the membrane pellet was resuspended in 200 μl of JR lysis buffer. For membrane extraction experiments (see below), the pellet was resuspended in 200 μl of TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 1 mm EDTA) supplemented with 1 mm phenylmethyl-sulfonyl fluoride. TEV Protease Protection Assay—ER- or Golgi-enriched membrane fractions were prepared as described above, and 10–20 μl (representing the yield from ∼1.5–2 A600 units of cells) were mixed with 10 units of TEV protease (TEVac, Invitrogen) in a reaction containing 0.1 m sorbitol, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.5 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol, in a final volume of 40 μl. Control reactions contained 0.5% Triton X-100 or 0.1 m ZnS04. Reactions were incubated for 1 h at 25 °C, stopped by the addition of Laemmli SDS loading buffer, and heated for 3 min at 55 °C. Proteins (loading equal cell equivalents) were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and further analyzed by immunoblotting with 12CA5 for the detection of the HA epitope. Fractionation and Extraction of Membranes—Whole cell lysates from ∼20 A600 units of cells were fractionated to separate soluble proteins (200 μl) and ER membranes as described above. ER membranes were resuspended in 200 μl of TE(pH 7.2). 50-μl aliquots were washed with TE (pH 7.2) and resuspended in 200 μl of TE (pH 7.2), or TE (pH 7.2) containing 0.1% SDS, or 100 mm Na2CO3 (pH 11). Samples were incubated for 30 min on ice, and then centrifuged for 15 min at 100,000 × g at 4 °C. The supernatants were removed from the pellets, which were brought up to 200 μl with Laemmli sample buffer. Equivalent amounts of each sample were heated for 3 min at 55 °C, separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-HA, anti-FLAG or anti-vATPase60 antibodies as described above. Diverse Strategies for the Organization of Alg13/Alg14 Proteins—With several notable exceptions, data base searches identified a pair of Alg13 and Alg14 orthologues in almost all eukaryotes. An exception is Encephalitozoon cuniculi, which does not appear to encode any glycosyltransferase involved in N-linked glycosylation (including any of the ALG, oligosaccharyltransferase OST, or calnexin/calreticulin CNE/CRT genes that encode the chaperones that recognize N-glycans in the ER). This result suggested that this single cell fungal-related parasite apparently lacks the N-glycosylation pathway. The other exceptions were some protozoa, including those of the Entamoeba (as noted previously by Bickel et al. (10Bickel T. Lehle L. Schwarz M. Aebi M. Jakob C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34500-34506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar)), Trypanosoma, and Dictyostelium genera, which encode a single Alg13/Alg14 polypeptide instead of a pair of separate proteins (Fig. 1A). Remarkably, sequence alignments demonstrated that these fusions are found in either orientation (see Fig. 1 and supplemental data for sequence alignments). Trypanosomes encode a single protein containing an Alg14 domain at the N terminus and an Alg13 domain at the C terminus, reminiscent of the organization found in the bacterial MurG protein. In contrast, D. discoideum and E. histolytica encode a protein containing an Alg13 domain at the N terminus and a domain at the C terminus that is homologous to most of Alg14 (Fig. 1A). Notably, these D. discoideum and E. histolytica Alg13/Alg14 proteins lack a region that is homologous to the first N-terminal 33 amino acids of Alg14. This latter finding was puzzling because this N-terminal domain of Alg14 is strongly predicted by all algorithms to contain a transmembrane spanning helix (TMD), composed of amino acids 5–24 (probability p = 1) (Fig. 1B). Secondary structure algorithms are not in agreement about whether or not there are additional transmembrane helices found in Alg14. Most programs predict only this one TMD (i.e. TMHMM; SOSUI), but there are several additional short hydrophobic domains, centered at amino acids ∼130 and ∼160 that are considered by some algorithms (i.e. TMpred and HMMTOP) as possible low probability membrane-spanning helices (p ∼ 0.4 and p ∼ 0.6, respectively) (Fig. 1B). Because the Alg13 domain catalyzes a reaction on the cytosolic face of the ER, the absence of the first TMD in the Alg13-Alg14 polypeptide of D. discoideum and E. histolytica implies that their Alg14 domain may contain additional TMDs that mediate association with the ER membrane. Alternatively, the Alg14 domain may associate with the ER membrane by additional mechanisms that are independent of this N-terminal TMD, which could explain its absence in the D. discoideum and E. histolytica Alg13-Alg14 proteins. Alg14 Contains a Luminal N Terminus and a Cytosolic C Terminus— As a first step to determine the membrane topology of Alg14, we analyzed chimeric yeast proteins in which S. cerevisiae Alg13 is fused to the C terminus or N terminus of S. cerevisiae Alg14 (see Fig. 2A, schematic diagram). Because Alg13 catalyzes an essential cytosolic reaction, we reasoned that complementation of a yeast strain lacking ALG13 by either of these fusions would yield information about which end of Alg14 faces the cytosol. To provide support for this experimental rationale, we first tested whether or not simply targeting Alg13 to the ER cytosolic face could complement the loss of ALG13 (Ost4-Alg13, Fig. 2B). The topology of Ost4, which contains a single TMD, a cytosolic C terminus, and a luminal N terminus, was determined previously (20Kim H. Yan Q. Von Heijne G. Caputo G.A. Lennarz W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 7460-7464Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), so we used this protein as a control membrane protein to anchor Alg13 to the cytosolic ER face. A plasmid-borne OST4-ALG13 fusion gene was constructed, which encodes Alg13 fused to the cytosolic C-terminal tail of Ost4. This plasmid (pOST4-ALG13-FLAG) was introduced into a yeast strain (NAY13) containing ALG13 under control of the glucose-repressible GAL1 promoter (PGAL1). Because ALG13 is an essential gene, the functionality of the OST4-ALG13 chimera was analyzed by its ability to complement the lethality of this PGAL1-ALG13 strain when grown on glucose-containing medium. The results of this experiment demonstrated that the Ost4-Alg13 chimeric protein complemented the loss of ALG13 and supported growth of the PGAL1-ALG13 strain on glucose media as a well as the wildtype ALG13 (Fig. 2B). These results suggested a correlation between Alg13 functionality and its cytosolic localization and provided support for the feasibility of our experimental rationale. The Ost4-Alg13 chimera was also tested for complementation of the lethality associated with loss of ALG14 in a strain containing a GAL1 promoter-driven ALG14 allele (XGY151). However, OST4-ALG13 failed to complement PGAL1-ALG14 when this strain was grown on glucose (Fig. 2B), demonstrating that Alg14 has an additional role that is distinct from its Alg13 recruiting activity. As a test for the topological orientation of the Alg14 termini, we examined the functionality of Alg13-Alg14 chimeras that contained Alg13 fused to the N terminus (Alg13-Alg14) or C terminus (Alg14-Alg13) of Alg14 (Fig. 2A). As described above, each of these plasmid-borne fusion genes were introduced into the PGAL1-ALG13 (NAY13) strain and tested for complementation of lethality on glucose-containing medium. The results of this experiment demonstrated that the Alg14-Alg13 fusion protein complemented the loss of ALG13 and supported growth of the PGAL1-ALG13 strain on glucose medium (Fig. 2B). In contrast, the Alg13-Alg14 chimera, containing Alg13 at the N terminus of Alg14, could not. This failure of Alg13-Alg14 to complement the loss of ALG13 was not due to the lack of ALG13-ALG14 expression, because this same plasmid-borne ALG13-ALG14 gene complemented the lethality associated with loss of ALG14 in a PGAL1-ALG14 strain (XGY151) grown in glucose, although not as well as ALG14-ALG13 (Fig. 2C). Further, Western blot analyses of epitope-tagged versions of these Alg13-Alg14 and Alg14-Alg13 chimeric proteins demonstrated that they accumulated in cells at comparable levels (data not shown). To confirm that these chimeric proteins were functional during LLO assembly, we examined their glycosylation phenotype by monitoring the gel mobility of CPY, a reporter for glycosylation and LLO assembly in the ER. The four N-linked glycans of CPY are inefficiently transferred from lipid to protein when truncated, resulting in a ladder-like mobility pattern of CPY containing 4, 3, 2, 1, or 0 glycans. We examined CPY mobility by Western blot analyses of extracts from PGAL1-ALG13 strains that expressed the Ost4-Alg13 or Alg13-Alg14 fusion protein while they were grown in glucose to repress expression of the endogenous ALG13. The result of this experiment demonstrated that CPY, which accumulated in all of the growth-complemented strains, was the mature form (Fig. 2C, lanes 2–4). Taken together, these results demonstrated that the C terminus of Alg14 faces the cytosol and suggested that the N terminus faces the lumen. To provide further evidence for a luminal orientation of the Alg14 N terminus, a protease protection assay was used to determine whether the N terminus of Alg14 in intact ER vesicles is resistant to added protease. To perform this experiment, a yeast strain was constructed in which the chromosomal allele of ALG14 was replaced by one encoding an N-terminally HA-tagged Alg14 protein that contained the TEV protease recognition site and a 10-amino acid linker at the junction between the TEV site and the first methionine of Alg14. This strain (SKY20), whose sole source of Alg14 is this HA-TEV-10-ALG14 allele, displayed no growth or glycosylation defect (data not shown), suggesting that the tag does not affect normal Alg14 function. If the N terminus of Alg14 faces the ER lumen, then the TEV site should be insensitive to TEV protease added to intact membranes. ER membrane fractions were prepared from this HA-TEV-10-tagged ALG14-expressing yeast strain and subjected to incubation with or without TEV protease, in the presence or absence of 1% Triton X-100 that solubilizes membranes. After digestion, proteins were solubilized, separated by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by immunoanalysis with anti-HA antibodies (Fig. 3). The result of this experiment demonstrated that the N-terminal HA-TEV-10 tag on Alg14 was resistant to digestion by added TEV protease in the absence of Triton X-100 (Fig. 3, lanes 1 and 2). A control membrane protein with an N-terminal HA-TEV tag (TEV-HA-Vrg4) that faces the cytosol (18Gao X.D. Dean N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17718-17727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), however, was sensitive to TEV digestion (Fig. 3, compare lanes 5 and 6). HA-TEV-10-Alg14 was digested by TEV protease when membranes were incubated in the presence of 1% Triton X-100 (Fig. 3, lane 3) demonstrating that intact membranes are required to protect HA-TEV-10-Alg14 from TEV proteolysis. Neither Alg14 nor Vrg4 were digested in the presence of ZnSO4, an inhibitor of TEV protease, demonstrating the specificity of TEV cleavage (Fig. 3, lanes 4 and 8). The specificity of TEV for the TEV tag was further demonstrated by the resistance of an anti-HA cross-reacting protein (indicated by the asterisk in Fig. 3) whose constant level also served as a useful loading control that is present in all membranes (Fig. 3). Taken together with the genetic data described above, these results demonstrated that the N terminus of Alg14 faces the lumen of the ER while the C terminus faces the cytosol. These results also demonstrated that Alg14 contains either a single, or an odd number of membrane-spanning domains. ALG14 Lacking Its"
https://openalex.org/W2107303999,"Sphingoid long-chain base 1-phosphates act as bioactive lipid molecules in eukaryotic cells. In budding yeast, long-chain base 1-phosphates are synthesized mainly by the long-chain base kinase Lcb4. We recently reported that, soon after yeast cells enter into the stationary phase, Lcb4 is rapidly degraded by being delivered to the vacuole in a palmitoylation- and phosphorylation-dependent manner. In this study, we investigated the complete trafficking pathway of Lcb4, from its synthesis to its degradation. After membrane anchoring by palmitoylation at the Golgi apparatus, Lcb4 is delivered to the plasma membrane (PM) through the late Sec pathway and then to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The yeast ER consists of a cortical network juxtaposed to the PM (cortical ER) with tubular connections to the nuclear envelope (nuclear ER). Remarkably, the localization of Lcb4 is restricted to the cortical ER. As the cells reach the stationary phase, G1 cell cycle arrest initiates Lcb4 degradation and its delivery to the vacuole via the Golgi apparatus. The protein transport pathway from the PM to the ER found in this study has not been previously reported. We speculate that this novel pathway is mediated by the PM-ER contact. Sphingoid long-chain base 1-phosphates act as bioactive lipid molecules in eukaryotic cells. In budding yeast, long-chain base 1-phosphates are synthesized mainly by the long-chain base kinase Lcb4. We recently reported that, soon after yeast cells enter into the stationary phase, Lcb4 is rapidly degraded by being delivered to the vacuole in a palmitoylation- and phosphorylation-dependent manner. In this study, we investigated the complete trafficking pathway of Lcb4, from its synthesis to its degradation. After membrane anchoring by palmitoylation at the Golgi apparatus, Lcb4 is delivered to the plasma membrane (PM) through the late Sec pathway and then to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The yeast ER consists of a cortical network juxtaposed to the PM (cortical ER) with tubular connections to the nuclear envelope (nuclear ER). Remarkably, the localization of Lcb4 is restricted to the cortical ER. As the cells reach the stationary phase, G1 cell cycle arrest initiates Lcb4 degradation and its delivery to the vacuole via the Golgi apparatus. The protein transport pathway from the PM to the ER found in this study has not been previously reported. We speculate that this novel pathway is mediated by the PM-ER contact. Sphingolipids are major constituents of eukaryotic plasma membranes. Ceramide, the structural backbone of sphingolipids, is generated from long-chain base (LCB) 3The abbreviations used are: LCBlong-chain baseLCBPlong-chain base 1-phosphateS1Psphingosine 1-phosphateMVBmultivesicular bodyERendoplasmic reticulumPMplasma membraneSCsynthetic completeEGFPenhanced green fluorescent proteinPAMplasma membrane-associated membrane. 3The abbreviations used are: LCBlong-chain baseLCBPlong-chain base 1-phosphateS1Psphingosine 1-phosphateMVBmultivesicular bodyERendoplasmic reticulumPMplasma membraneSCsynthetic completeEGFPenhanced green fluorescent proteinPAMplasma membrane-associated membrane. and an amide-linked fatty acid. In addition, phosphorylation of the major mammalian LCB, sphingosine, by sphingosine kinase yields sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P). By binding to receptors in the S1P/Edg family of G-protein-coupled receptors, S1P regulates various cellular processes including proliferation, differentiation, motility, and adherens junction assembly (1Pyne S.

In addition to its extracellular effects, S1P is thought to function as a second messenger of various stimuli, such as growth factors and cytokines, and to elicit cellular responses including Ca2+ mobilization and apoptosis inhibition (1Pyne S.

The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae does not contain S1P but instead has two other long-chain base 1-phosphates (LCBPs), dihydrosphingosine 1-phosphate and phytosphingosine 1-phosphate. The synthesis and metabolic pathways of LCBPs are highly conserved between mammalian and yeast cells, and yeast LCBPs are produced by LCB kinases that correspond to mammalian sphingosine kinases. Yeast have two LCB kinases, Lcb4 and Lcb5, although Lcb4 is responsible for most cellular activity. Yeast cells, however, do not have cell surface receptors for LCBPs, so these compounds function only intracellularly. Similar to the intracellular functions of S1P in mammals, LCBPs in yeast are involved in diverse cellular processes including heat stress resistance and Ca2+ mobilization (5Mandala S.M. Thornton R.

Recently, we found that the stability and localization of Lcb4 were regulated by its post-translational modifications, including palmitoylation, phosphorylation, and ubiquitination (9Iwaki S. Kihara A. Sano T. Igarashi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6520-6527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 10Kihara A. Kurotsu F. Sano T. Iwaki S. Igarashi Y. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 9189-9197Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Palmitoylation of Lcb4 is catalyzed by the palmitoyltransferase Akr1, whereas Pho85 cyclin-dependent kinase is responsible for its phosphorylation. Interestingly, the phosphorylation of Lcb4 is greatly reduced in Δakr1 cells (10Kihara A. Kurotsu F. Sano T. Iwaki S. Igarashi Y. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 9189-9197Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), suggesting that the palmitoylation is a prerequisite for the phosphorylation. Palmitoylation is also involved in the membrane anchoring of Lcb4, which otherwise would be a soluble protein. Although Lcb4 is relatively stable in the log phase of cell growth, it is destabilized upon the cell reaching the stationary phase. Both palmitoylation and phosphorylation are required during the stationary phase for the degradation of Lcb4, which is delivered to the vacuole via the multivesicular body (MVB), then degraded (9Iwaki S. Kihara A. Sano T. Igarashi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6520-6527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 10Kihara A. Kurotsu F. Sano T. Iwaki S. Igarashi Y. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 9189-9197Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In a previous report, we demonstrated that in log phase, Lcb4 is localized primarily in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), although it is also found in the plasma membrane (PM) (11Sano T. Kihara A. Kurotsu F. Iwaki S. Igarashi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 36674-36682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). However, it was unclear how Lcb4 reaches the ER or PM. In the present study, we investigated the complete trafficking pathway of Lcb4, from its synthesis to its degradation. We found that localization of Lcb4 in the ER was unusually restricted to the cortical ER. In addition, our results strongly support the existence of a novel PM-to-ER transport pathway. Transport of Lcb4 via the PM-ER contact site is an intriguing possibility that would also explain its unique, cortical ER-specific localization.

Briefly, ∼5 × 108 cells were converted to spheroplasts and lysed in a 12.5% sucrose solution in buffer I (20 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.5), 10 mm EDTA, 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Complete™; Roche Diagnostics), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). After removal of cell debris by centrifugation, total lysates (0.425 ml) were overlaid onto a discontinuous sucrose gradient (0.319 ml of 26%, 0.319 ml of 34%, 0.638 ml of 42%, 1.275 ml of 46%, 0.85 ml of 50%, 0.638 ml of 54%, and 0.425 ml of 60% sucrose (w/v) in buffer I), and the samples were centrifuged at 235,000 × g for 4 h.

Cells were pulse-labeled for 15 min with [35S]methionine/[35S]cysteine (EXPRESS™ protein labeling mix; 1,000 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at 25 μCi/107 cells and then chased with cold methionine (final concentration 0.5 mg/ml) and cysteine (final concentration 0.1 mg/ml) for the indicated time periods. Cell lysates were prepared as described previously (14Kihara A. Igarashi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30048-30054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), and Lcb4 was then immunoprecipitated using anti-Lcb4 antiserum (9Iwaki S. Kihara A. Sano T. Igarashi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6520-6527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and protein A-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare). Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE, and the gels were fixed, treated with the Amplify fluorographic reagent™ (GE Healthcare), dried, and exposed to x-ray film at -80 °C. Lcb4 Is Localized in the Cortical ER—We first examined the localization of Lcb4 by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy using anti-Lcb4 antibodies. A weak signal was detected near the cell surface in wild-type cells but was not observed in Δlcb4 cells (Fig. 1A). In cells in which Lcb4 was produced from a2 μ plasmid, cell surface staining became more prominent (Fig. 1A), agreeing with our previous result (10Kihara A. Kurotsu F. Sano T. Iwaki S. Igarashi Y. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 9189-9197Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). We also investigated the localization of Lcb4 by sucrose density gradient. As reported previously (11Sano T. Kihara A. Kurotsu F. Iwaki S. Igarashi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 36674-36682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), endogenous Lcb4 was localized mainly in the ER fractions but partly in the PM fractions (Fig. 1B). When Lcb4 was expressed from a CEN plasmid, its subcellular localization was almost the same as that observed in wild-type cells (Fig. 1C). In fluorescence microscopy, yeast ERs typically appear as two ring structures, the nuclear ER and the cortical ER, as demonstrated by the staining patterns of the ER protein Kar2 (Fig. 1A). However, the cortical ER is closely adjacent to the PM, identified by its marker Pma1 (Fig. 1A), so immunofluorescence cannot distinguish between the two. Sucrose density gradient separation revealed that most of the endogenous Lcb4 was localized in the ER (Fig. 1B), although no nuclear ER staining was observed (Fig. 1A). These results suggest that the ER localization of Lcb4 is restricted to the cortical ER and that the cell surface staining observed corresponds to both the PM and the cortical ER. To confirm the cortical ER localization of Lcb4, we investigated endogenous and overproduced Lcb4 by immunoelectron microscopy. As presented in Fig. 2A, the ER structures were distinguishable as characteristic transparent structures (19Preuss D. Mulholland J. Kaiser C.A. Orlean P. Albright C. Rose M.D. Robbins P.W. Botstein D. Yeast. 1991; 7: 891-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) that included the cortical ER (closed arrows) and the nuclear ER (open arrows). Overproduced Lcb4 was indeed detected in the cortical ER (closed arrowheads) but not in the nuclear ER (Fig. 2B). Plasma membrane localization was also observed in some cells (data not shown). Similarly, endogenous Lcb4 was observed in the cortical ER (Fig. 2C) but not in the nuclear ER. These results indicate that Lcb4 is indeed localized specifically in the cortical ER. Lcb4 Is Transported to the PM via the Golgi Apparatus—Recently, we demonstrated that Lcb4 is anchored to the membrane through its palmitoylation by the palmitoyltransferase Akr1 (10Kihara A. Kurotsu F. Sano T. Iwaki S. Igarashi Y. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 9189-9197Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Considering that Akr1 is predominantly localized in the Golgi apparatus (20Roth A.F. Feng Y. Chen L. Davis N.G. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar), we speculated that Lcb4 is transported to the PM/ER after being palmitoylated at the Golgi apparatus. To test this theory, we prepared an EGFP-Lcb4 construct under the control of the inducible MET15 promoter, which enabled us to monitor only the newly synthesized EGFP-Lcb4. We introduced this construct into wild-type or sec1-1 temperature-sensitive mutants, in which the late Sec pathway involved in vesicular transport from the Golgi apparatus to the PM is abolished at restrictive temperatures (37 °C). In wild-type cells grown at either 23 or 37 °C, EGFP-Lcb4 was observed at the cell periphery. In contrast, in the sec1-1 mutants, EGFP-Lcb4 was distributed in punctate structures characteristic of the Golgi apparatus, at the restrictive temperature (37 °C) but not at the permissive temperature (23 °C) (Fig. 3A). This result indicates that Golgi-to-PM transport via the late Sec pathway is essential not only for the PM localization but also for the cortical ER localization of Lcb4. Thus, it is highly likely that Lcb4 is transported to the ER after reaching the PM. To determine the site of Lcb4 phosphorylation, we next examined the phosphorylation in sec1-1 mutants over time using a pulse-chase experiment. Lcb4 was gradually converted to its phosphorylated form in wild-type cells at either temperature and in the sec1-1 mutants at the permissive temperature (Fig. 3B). On the other hand, almost no phosphorylation was observed in sec1-1 mutants at the restrictive temperature. These results indicate that Lcb4 is phosphorylated after reaching the PM. Lcb4 Is Transported from the ER to the Vacuole via the Golgi/MVB in the Stationary Phase—Previously, we demonstrated that upon reaching the stationary phase, Lcb4 is rapidly delivered via the MVB to the vacuole for degradation (9Iwaki S. Kihara A. Sano T. Igarashi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6520-6527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). However, it is unclear how the Lcb4, localized in the ER during the log phase, is transported to the MVB/vacuole. One possibility is that Lcb4 is transported from the ER to the Golgi apparatus via vesicular transport (early Sec pathway) and then to the MVB/vacuole, or perhaps, Lcb4 returns to the PM and is transported to the MVB/vacuole via endocytosis. To distinguish between these possibilities, we investigated the degradation of Lcb4 in early sec and endocytosis mutants. The temperature-sensitive mutants sec12-1 and sec23-1 carry mutations in the component of the coat protein complex II (COPII) complex that is involved in the transport from the ER to the Golgi apparatus. Cells were cultured until just before entering the stationary phase, and then they were shifted to the restrictive temperature. Although it was degraded in a time-dependent manner in wild-type cells, Lcb4 was not degraded in either the sec12-1 or the sec23-1 mutants (Fig. 4A), indicating that Lcb4 is indeed transported from the ER to the Golgi via the early Sec pathway. On the other hand, mutations affecting endocytosis (Δsla1, Δchc1, and Δclc1) did not affect the stability of Lcb4, confirming that it is not transported to the vacuole via the endocytosis pathway (Fig. 4B). These results also support the existence of a PM-to-ER transport pathway since the PM-localized Lcb4 must be delivered to the ER prior to its degradation. Next, we examined the stability of Lcb4 using deletion mutants with defective post-Golgi transport. As shown in Fig. 4C, the stability of Lcb4 during the stationary phase was increased in mutants carrying deletions (Δvps45 and Δpep12) that affect the soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors (SNARE) complex, which is involved in transport between the Golgi apparatus and the MVB. We also examined the localization of EGFP-Lcb4 in log and stationary phases in these mutants. In wild-type cells, EGFP-Lcb4 was observed near the cell surface in the log phase, whereas vacuolar staining was evident in the stationary phase, reflecting the accumulation of the stable EGFP moiety (Fig. 4D). On the other hand, EGFP-Lcb4 was observed in intracellular organelles in both Δvps45 and Δpep12 cells at the stationary phase (Fig. 4D). These results indicate that Lcb4 is transported from the ER to the vacuole via the Golgi/MVB at the stationary phase. G1 Cell Cycle Arrest Accelerates the Degradation of Lcb4—Yeast cells in glucose-containing medium proliferate by fermenting glucose, but the exhaustion of glucose causes a conversion in metabolism from fermentation to respiration, which utilizes ethanol. This conversion is called the diauxic shift. After yeast cells reach the diauxic shift, they undergo G1 cell cycle arrest and enter into the stationary phase. To test whether the degradation of Lcb4 at the stationary phase is related to the G1 cell cycle arrest, we examined the stability of Lcb4 in cultures treated with drugs that synchronize the cells at the G1 phase. Rapamycin inhibits Tor kinase and arrests the cell cycle at the G1 phase (21Heitman J. Movva N.R. Hall M.N. Science. 1991; 253: 905-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (1528) Google Scholar, 22Kunz J.

Treatment with 200 ng/ml rapamycin resulted in the stimulation of Lcb4 degradation (Fig. 5A). The mating pheromone α-factor similarly arrests the cell cycle in the late G1 phase. Since exogenous α-factor is degraded rapidly by the secreted protease Bar1 (23MacKay V.L. Welch S.K. Insley M.Y. Manney T.R. Holly J. Saari G.C. Parker M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Glutamine-PRPP amidotransferase (E.C. 2.4.2.14), the product of the purF gene in Salmonella enterica (and Escherichia coli), catalyzes the synthesis of PRA from PRPP and glutamine. Strains lacking PurF have the expected nutritional requirement for purines; however, under some growth conditions S. enterica strains lacking PurF are able to grow in the absence of thiamine (5Downs D.M.

Genetic and biochemical studies have demonstrated this growth reflects the existence of a PurF-independent mechanism(s) to generate PRA that is utilized by subsequent purine and thiamine enzymes to generate the hydroxymethyl pyrimidine moiety of thiamine (7Enos-Berlage J.L.

An inability to obtain mutants devoid of PRA formation suggests multiple activities that can generate this metabolite. PRA could be generated by a side reaction(s) of enzyme(s) involved in other metabolic pathways, redistribution of metabolic flux, or a combination of the two. Results implicating the anthranilate synthase-phosphoribosyltransferase complex (TrpDE, EC 4.1.3.27, EC 2.4.2.18), required in tryptophan biosynthesis in the synthesis of PRA (9Ramos I. Downs D.M. J.

Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 6786-6792Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), are consistent with this scenario. Genetic studies have shown that a functional oxidative pentose phosphate pathway is required for at least one route of PRA biosynthesis independent of PurF and distinct from the Trp enzymes (6Petersen L.

Nutritional studies were consistent with a role of the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway in contributing ribose 5-phosphate (R5P) for PRA synthesis (Fig. 1) (6Petersen L. Enos-Berlage J. Downs D.M.

The study described here was initiated to test the hypothesis that a PRA-forming activity utilizing R5P as a substrate is present in bacterial cells. Here we describe the identification and purification of a PRA-forming activity present in E. coli and S. enterica which converts R5P and asparagine or glutamine to PRA. Purification of this activity from crude extract determined that it required two proteins encoded by aphA and ansB. Medium and Chemicals—Culture media supplies were obtained from Difco. Glutamine, asparagine, glycine, ribose 5-phosphate, PRPP, magnesium acetate, ammonium chloride, ATP, EDTA, β-mercaptoethanol, phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, protamine sulfate, DNase I (EC 3.1.21.1), and lysozyme (EC 3.2.1.17) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. KCl, sucrose, MgCl2, Tris base, methanol, and pyridine were from Fisher. K2HPO4, KH2PO4, and ammonium sulfate were obtained from Mallinckrodt Baker (Phillipsburg, NJ). [1-14C]Glycine was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow and all chromatography resins were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Cellulose-polyethyleneimine plates were from Selecto Scientific (Suwanee, GA). Ultrafiltration YM membranes were from Amicon (Beverly, MA). All restriction enzymes used were from Promega (Madison, WI). AnsB (EC 3.5.1.1) from E. coli (catalog number A4887) was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Strains, Cell Growth, Extract Preparation—Strain DM1293 (E. coli, purF::Tn10) was grown in Luria-Bertani broth in a 16-liter batch fermentor. Strain DM1936 (S. enterica, purF2085) was grown in nutrient broth in a 16-liter batch fermentor. The medium was inoculated with 1 liter of an overnight culture and incubated at 37 °C with aeration for 12 h. Cells (∼88 g) were harvested by centrifugation at 4 °C, washed twice with buffer A (0.05 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol and 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride), and resuspended in 200 ml of the same buffer. The cells were disrupted using a French pressure cell at 104 kPa. Clarified cell-free extract was obtained by centrifugation at 23,700 × g for 45 min at 4 °C. When grown on a smaller scale, media were inoculated with a nutrient broth overnight culture and incubated at 37 °C with agitation until full cell density was achieved. Cell-free extracts were then generated as described above. Assay for PRA Formation—A PRA-forming activity assay described for glutamine-PRPP amidotransferase (4Schendel F.J. Cheng Y.S. Otvos J.D.

Commun. 1967; 27: 618-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) was modified to optimize sensitivity. PRA synthesis was assayed in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, in the presence of 6 mm magnesium acetate, 2.5 mm ATP, 2 mm [14C]glycine (26 nCi), a pool of amino acids containing equal concentrations (6 mm) of glutamine, asparagine, and 2 μg of glycinamide ribonucleotide (GAR) synthetase. Reactions were started by the addition of R5P (13 mm final concentration) and incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. Radiolabeled GAR and glycine were separated by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) on polyethyleneimine-cellulose using a methanol:pyridine:water system (20:1:5). The position of radioactive spots was detected using a Cyclone Storage Phosphor System (Packard Instrument Co.), and their identity was confirmed with standards. GAR Synthetase (PurD)—GAR synthetase was purified to 95% homogeneity from E. coli strain DM1295 (purF::Tn10/pJS187). Plasmid pJS187 provides for the overexpression of GAR synthetase (14Cheng Y.S. Shen Y. Rudolph J. Stern M. Stubbe J. Flannigan K.A. Smith J.M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 218-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). PurD protein was purified as described using ammonium sulfate fractionation, ion exchange chromatography (DEAE resin), and size exclusion chromatography (14Cheng Y.S. Shen Y. Rudolph J. Stern M. Stubbe J. Flannigan K.A. Smith J.M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 218-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The activity of the purified protein was assayed by monitoring [14C]GAR production from [14C]glycine and chemically synthesized PRA (4Schendel F.J. Cheng Y.S. Otvos J.D. Wehrli S. Stubbe J. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 2614-2623Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 13LeGal M.L. LeGal Y. Roche J. Hedegaard J. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Alternatively, PurD was purified by affinity chromatography using the IMPACT CN Kit (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA). A C-terminal intein tag was created by amplifying the open reading frame of purD from S. enterica LT2 chromosomal DNA by PCR using Platinum Pfx DNA polymerase (Invitrogen). This construct was cloned into the NdeI and SmaI sites of the plasmid pTYB2. Overexpression and purification of the protein were performed as recommended by the manufacturer and resulted in a native protein containing a single additional glycine at the N-terminal end. Preparations of PurD purified by either method were used interchangeably with no affect on the ability to detect PRA-forming activity. PRA-forming Activity—Nucleic acids were precipitated by the addition of protamine sulfate to the clarified cell-free extract at a final concentration of 0.1% with constant stirring over 10 min. The solution was then stirred for an 30 additional min and centrifuged at 23,700 × g for 20 min. A two-step salt precipitation was performed. The clarified cell-free extract was brought to 35% saturation by the addition of solid ammonium sulfate with constant stirring for 30 min. The solution was then stirred for 30 additional min and centrifuged at 23,700 × g for 30 min. The same procedure was used in a second precipitation step performed at 70% saturation. The supernatant at 70% saturation was discarded, and the precipitate was resuspended in buffer A (0.05 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride) and dialyzed against the same buffer. The dialyzed fraction was applied at a flow rate of 2 ml/min to a DEAE ion exchange column (200-ml column volume) equilibrated with buffer A. The column was washed with two column volumes (CV) of buffer A, and all PRA-forming activity was found to be in the flow-through and wash fractions. These fractions were pooled and concentrated using a 30-kDa cut-off Amicon ultrafiltration membrane. The concentrated fraction was applied at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min to a HiLoad Superdex 75 size exclusion column (24-ml CV) equilibrated with buffer A containing 100 mm KCl; 1-ml fractions were collected and assayed for PRA-forming activity. The active fractions were applied at a flow rate of 2 ml/min to a Mono Q (strong ion exchange) column (8 ml of CV) equilibrated with buffer A. After a 2-CV wash with buffer A, a linear gradient from 0 to 1 m KCl was used to elute the proteins bound to the column; 1-ml fractions were collected throughout the wash and elution. After dialyzing against buffer A, the fractions were tested for PRA-forming activity and stored at 4 °C. An alternative step was used interchangeably with the DEAE column chromatographic step. In this alternative 100 cubic centimeters of unpacked DEAE resin equilibrated with buffer A was mixed with the dialyzed fractions, and the suspension was placed on ice for 10 min. Trial experiments determined that this batch elution protocol resulted in purification of the PRA-forming activity with the same efficiency as collecting the flow-through from standard column chromatography. The supernatant was removed by filtration. The resin was washed with an additional 200 ml of buffer A, which was then pooled with the 200-ml supernatant and concentrated using a using a 30-kDa cut-off Amicon ultrafiltration membrane and applied to a Superdex 75 size exclusion column (see above). AphA—Strain DM10089 (purF2085 ansB1::Kan pSU-aphA) was grown in nutrient broth with chloramphenicol (20 μg/ml) in a 16-liter batch fermentor, and the cells were collected by centrifugation. Proteins from the periplasmic space were isolated using a modified spheroplasting technique (16Thaller M.C. Schippa S. Bonci A. Cresti S. Rossolini G.M. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1997; 146: 191-198Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting protein preparation was subjected to the purification scheme described for the PRA-forming activity. SDS-PAGE protein bands were visualized by staining with a Silver Stain Plus kit from Bio-Rad, and the protein prep was determined to be >95% pure after passage through a Superdex 75 size exclusion column (data not shown). The protein prep was then stored at 4 °C for two months or frozen and stored at -80 °C for future use. Protein was quantified by the method of Bradford (17Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) or by using a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Ultrapure bovine serum albumin was used to generate a standard curve. After SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), protein bands were visualized by staining with either (a) 40:55:5:0.05 ethanol: water:acetic acid:Coomassie G-250 and distained in 40:55:5 ethanol:water:acetic acid or (b) silver using a Silver Stain Plus kit from Bio-Rad. Candidate genes were amplified from S. enterica LT2 chromosomal DNA by PCR using Platinum Pfx DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) with the primers shown in Table 1. The resulting PCR products were purified and cloned into the multicloning site of pSU19 (18Bartolomé B. Jubete Y. Martinez E. de la Cruz F. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 102: 75-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Plasmids were electroporated into E. coli strain DH5α and screened for vectors containing inserts. Constructs containing the cloned genes under the control of the lac promoter were confirmed by sequence analysis and introduced into S. enterica strain DM1936.TABLE 1Primers used in this studyPlasmidaFor all plasmids, pSU19 (Cmr) was usedPrimers used to amplify insertpIR-mdh5′–GCCTGTGTCACGCCTCGCAAATAA–3′5′–GCGACCTGCATGTGCCTGTTGG–3′pIR-mdoG5′–CACGTATTCTCAGATTTTTCACCT–3′5′–CGCGAGTAAGTCCGATGCT–3′pIR-ydcG5′–CTGAAGAATGCTGCGTGAGG–3′5′–GAGCAGCACTTAATAAACCCAGAG–3′pSU-aphA5′–GTCGACCCGTTACTGGCGTTATGGTC–3′5′–GGATCCGTGCAGCAAGTCTGGAAAAG–3′pSU-cpdB5′–CTGCAGGGAACGATATCGGGTTTCAC–3′5′–GGATCCCGGGAACGTTTATCAGATGG–3′pSU-ansB5′–CTGCAGTAAACAATGGCGCAGATCG–3′5′–GGATCCGTGCGAGAGGTCTTCCAAAG–3′pSU-yghA5′–GAGAGTCGACGAATACGGGCGAAGCATAAG–3′5′–CAGAGGATCCAAGTGGCGCCTTGCTTAAC–3′pSU-talA5′–GAGACTGCAGGCCTGTCTGCTATGCTTTTTG–3′5′–GAGAGGATCCCATTGGCAAGGTCTTTACGG–3′a For all plasmids, pSU19 (Cmr) was used Open table in a new tab Candidate proteins were partially purified from cell-free extracts of strains overexpressing them. Cells (∼3 g) were resuspended in buffer A (6 ml) with 2 mg/ml lysozyme and 1 mg/ml DNase before disruption with a French pressure cell at 104 kilopascals. Clarified cell-free extract was obtained by centrifugation at 39,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The clarified cell-free extract was at 65 °C for 5 min, centrifuged at 39,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C, and run by gravity feed over two DEAE columns (6-ml CV) equilibrated with buffer A running in tandem at 4 °C. A 6-ml wash was combined with the flow-through fraction and concentrated with a 30-kDa cut-off Amicon ultrafiltration membrane. Optimization of in Vitro Assay for PRA Formation—Past protocols for PRA-formation have utilized a coupled reaction with glycinamide ribotide synthetase (PurD) in which the substrate ([14C]glycine) is separated from the product ([14C]GAR) by ion exchange chromatography based on the charge conferred by the phosphate group in GAR (4Schendel F.J. Cheng Y.S. Otvos J.D. Wehrli S. Stubbe J. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 2614-2623Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Use of this assay in crude cell-free extracts was hampered by nonspecific phosphatases that partially converted GAR to GARs and, thus, decreased the sensitivity of the assay. Because the activity of interest was expected to be weak, a TLC system using a mobile phase of methanol/pyridine/water (20:1:5) on polyethyleneimine-cellulose plates was used to separate unincorporated [14C]glycine from the [14C]GAR/[14C]GARs. Initial screens for PRA-forming activity were preformed in S. enterica and E. coli cell-free extracts lacking glutamine-PRPP amidotransferase. Either PRPP or R5P was provided as the carbon backbone donor and a pool of amino acids containing glutamine, asparagine, alanine, and valine (each at 6 mm) as the potential source of the amino group. Subsequent experiments determined that glutamine and asparagine were equally proficient as amino donors, and no other amino acid allowed PRA formation. Control experiments determined PRA was formed in the absence of extract (data not shown) if R5P was provided to the Tris-HCl buffer used in previous work (pH 8.0, 100 mm) (4Schendel F.J. Cheng Y.S. Otvos J.D. Wehrli S. Stubbe J. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 2614-2623Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Because PRA can be chemically synthesized from R5P and ammonia, this nonenzymatic formation was attributed to small amounts of ammonia in the buffer (15Nierlich D.P. Magasanik B. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 366-374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Nierlich D.P. Magasanik B. J. Biol. Chem. 1961; 236: 32-33Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Additional buffers (HEPES-NaOH, Clark and Lubs KH2PO4-NaOH, pH. 8, 50 mm) were discarded for a similar reason or because the (PurD) activity was negatively affected. Potassium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, was found to produce negligible background PRA formation and was used in subsequent experiments. Initial Characterization of a PRA-forming Activity in Cell-free Extracts Lacking PurF—Dialyzed cell-free extracts from S. enterica and E. coli strains lacking glutamine-PRPP amidotransferase failed to support synthesis of PRA from either R5P or PRPP, glutamine, and asparagine. It was subsequently found that synthesis of PRA from R5P, glutamine, and asparagine was detectable after the cell-free extract had interacted with an anion exchange resin (DEAE, pH 7.5) and/or was subjected to 65 °C for 5 min. Detection of this activity is shown in Fig. 2. Data in Fig. 2A show that in the presence of fractionated extract, formation of GAR was detectable when R5P (lane 2), but not PRPP (data not shown), was provided with amino acids. The PRA-forming activity was decreased when heated at 98 °C for 5 min (lane 3) and retained after dialysis (lane 4). Furthermore, the activity was unaffected by treatment with either RNase or DNase (data not shown). Accumulation of GAR was proportional to the time of assay incubation up to 4 h, as shown by data from a representative experiment in Fig. 2B. Data in Fig. 2C show that GAR synthesis was proportional to protein up to 15 μg, after which a plateau was reached. The data in Figs. 2, B and C, are from a representative experiment, and GAR concentration was determined from a linear curve of radiolabeled glycine generated under visualization conditions. Inability to detect PRA-forming activity in crude cell-free extracts before fractionation suggested the presence of an inhibitory compound. Subsequent experiments determined the target of inhibition was the PurD reaction, and it was not further characterized. Purification of PRA-forming Activity—PRA-forming activity was followed during fractionation of an E. coli strain lacking glutamine-PRPP amidotransferase (DM1293 (E. coli purF77:: Tn10)). A purification protocol was implemented and is summarized in Table 2. A typical purification used 250 ml of cell-free extract (8 mg/ml) fractionated by precipitation with ammonium sulfate as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The proteins precipitated at 70% saturation were resuspended in buffer A and dialyzed against the same buffer. Ion exchange chromatography was performed on the dialyzed fractions (200 ml). PRA-forming activity was detectable at this stage in the flow-through fraction, and this activity was set to be 100% for subsequent yield determination.TABLE 2Purification of PRA-forming activity PRA synthesis from R5P, glutamine, and asparagine was determined to be a function of radiolabeled [14C]GAR production.Purification stepSpecific activityPurificationYieldUnitsbArbitrary units detected by the Cyclone Storage Phosphor System/mg of protein%Cell-free extractNDaND, none detected(NH4)2SO4 precipitationNDDEAE ion exchange chromatography (flow-through)5061Superdex 75 size exclusion chromatography10,8482268Mono Q ion exchange chromatography316,49262589a ND, none detectedb Arbitrary units detected by the Cyclone Storage Phosphor System Open table in a new tab After interaction with the DEAE resin, the PRA-forming activity was further purified and concentrated by passage through a 30-kDa cut-off Amicon ultrafiltration membrane followed by size exclusion chromatography and ion exchange chromatography as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data in Table 2 indicates a 625-fold final purification was achieved. Proteins in the active fractions from the purification were visualized after separation on SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The fraction from the Mono Q column contained multiple protein bands (data not shown). Final active fractions from three independent purifications and an inactive fraction from the final column were sent to Midwest Bio Services (Overland Park, KS) for in-gel extraction and mass spectrometry analysis. Table 3 summarizes the proteins identified in all active fractions and not present in the inactive fraction.TABLE 3Identification of potential PRA-forming enzymes by mass spectrometry analysisGeneStrainapurF2085 strain with gene cloned into pSU19Gene productbAt least two different peptides matching the identified protein were detected by mass spectrometrySizeFunctionkDamdoGDM9380Putative periplasmic glycoprotein57Periplasmic glucans biosynthesis, addition of branches to linear glucan backboneydcGDM9831Putative periplasmic glycoprotein61Periplasmic glucans biosynthesismdhDM9379Malate dehydrogenase32Interconversion of l-malate and oxaloacetatetalADM9652Transaldolase A35Reversible 3-carbon ketol unit transfer from sedoheptulose 7-phosphate (P) to glyceraldehyde 3-P to form erythrose 4-P and fructose 6-PyghADM9615Hypothetical oxidoreductase NAD(P) binding31Belongs to the short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases (SDR) familycpdBDM95202′,3′-Cyclic nucleotide 2′-phosphodiesterase70Salvage of nucleosides and nucleotides (interconversion)ansBDM9584Periplasmic l-asparaginase II35Hydrolysis of asparagine to aspartic acid and ammoniaaphADM9518Periplasmic class B phosphatase/phosphotransferase25Non-specific acid phosphatase/phosphotranserasea purF2085 strain with gene cloned into pSU19b At least two different peptides matching the identified protein were detected by mass spectrometry Open table in a new tab Partially Purified AphA Has PRA-forming Activity—Genes encoding each of the eight proteins described in Table 3 were amplified from S. enterica and cloned into a pSU19 multicopy plasmid. The resulting constructs were introduced into the S. enterica strain DM1936 (purF2085). Cell free extracts from the resulting strains were subjected to partial purification and assayed for PRA-forming activity. Of the eight strains, two had more PRA synthesis than the parental strain (Fig. 3). The strain overexpressing AphA (lane 1) and the strain overexpressing AnsB (lane 2) were found to have increased PRA formation relative to the control strain DM1936 (lane 4). Purified AnsB was purchased (Sigma) and tested for its ability to make PRA. Although AnsB allowed PRA formation (lane 3), two points were noted. First, 10 μg of AnsB allowed less PRA formation than crude extract of the AphA-overproducing strain. Second, as an asparaginase, AnsB produces NH3 and, thus, PRA formation is expected to be at least partially due to the nonenzymatic combination of ammonia and R5P (15Nierlich D.P. Magasanik B. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 366-374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). AphA and AnsB Are Required for PRA-forming Activity—AphA was purified from strain DM9518 (purF2085 pSU-aphA) to >95% homogenicity and tested for PRA-forming activity. Ten micrograms of this protein preparation generated more PRA than the partially purified extract from DM9518 (data not shown), although there was a noticeable contaminating protein band of approximately the size of the AnsB protein (∼35 kDa). To address the possible contribution of AnsB to the detected PRA-forming activity, a strain lacking AnsB and PurF activities was generated. Plasmid pSU-aphA was moved into this strain to create DM10089 (purF2085 ansB1::Kan pSU-aphA). AphA was then purified after overexpression in the ansB mutant background and found to have no PRA-forming activity. Additional protein preparations confirmed that AphA is not sufficient to catalyze PRA formation. Data in Fig. 4 showed that although neither 10 μg of AphA (lane 1) or AnsB (lane 2) allowed significant PRA formation, a mixture of the two proteins did. In the presence of less than molar amounts of AnsB, AphA was able to generate significant amounts of PRA. From these data it was concluded that the PRA-forming activity purified from crude extracts was due to a complex involving the periplasmic proteins AphA and AnsB. Physiological Role of AphA and AnsB in Thiamin Biosynthesis—Results described here showed that AphA and AnsB have the ability to produce PRA in vitro. Strain DM10259 (purF2085 ansB1::Kan aphA15::Cm) was constructed and analyzed for growth under various conditions known to allow PurF-independent PRA formation. In all growth conditions tested, the strain lacking ansB and aphA grew as well as the parental purF mutant, indicating this PRA-forming activity was not essential for growth. When aphA or ansB was placed in multicopy, neither allowed a purF mutant strain to grow in the absence of thiamine under non-permissive conditions (data not shown). This study describes the identification and purification of a cellular activity from both E. coli and S. enterica that synthesizes PRA. Data herein showed that AphA, a periplasmic class B nonspecific acid phosphatase/phosphotransferase (EC 3.1.3.2), in combination with submolar ratios of the periplasmic l-asparaginase II, AnsB (EC 3.5.1.1), can produce PRA from R5P and either asparagine or glutamine in vitro. Titration experiments determined that (at pH 7.5) optimal PRA-formation occurred when AphA and AnsB were provided at a 13:1 molar ratio. We suggest that AphA binds R5P and catalyzes the formation of PRA when presented with the ammonia released by hydrolysis of asparagine or glutamine by AnsB. Based on the enzymes involved, a scenario in which either one could produce PRA is feasible. Although AphA has been characterized primarily for its ability to dephosphorylate mononucleotides and various other phosphomonoesters, the enzyme has been shown to catalyze dephosphorylation of R5P. This finding indicates that the enzyme can bind R5P, although it is acted on with a relatively low catalytic efficiency (Kcat/Km = 5.0 × 103 m-1 s-1, pH 6) (20Passariello C. Forleo C. Micheli V. Schippa S. Leone R. Mangani S. Thaller M.C. Rossolini G.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1764: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). At physiological pH the protein exhibits suboptimal activity, potentially decreasing this catalytic efficiency further, raising the possibility that R5P could bind in the active site without dephosphorylation occurring. In this scenario, AphA could serve to concentrate R5P, allowing PRA formation to occur when ammonia is present. Because AnsB hydrolyzes both asparagine and glutamine optimally at pH 7.5 (21Miller H.K. Balis M.E. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1969; 18: 2225-2232Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), a simple scenario suggests that AnsB produces ammonia that allows nonenzymatic formation of PRA in the presence of R5P (15Nierlich D.P. Magasanik B. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 366-374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although more complex scenarios for the generation of PRA by the individual enzymes could be imagined, several observations suggested AphA and AnsB together were responsible for the PRA production detected herein. First, AphA and AnsB co-purified through several chromatographic steps, consistent with at least a loose association of the two proteins. The fact that both enzymes are located in the periplasm is consistent with this interpretation. Second, the amount of PRA formed with the addition of both proteins was noticeably more than that generated by AphA even with excess ammonia. We suggest a model in which PRA is formed in the active site of AphA. By this scenario R5P would occasionally bind the AphA enzyme, blocking the active site due to the poor catalytic activity of the enzyme with this substrate. This association would remain until the glutaminase/asparaginase releases ammonia in close proximity, perhaps allowing the interaction of R5P and ammonia, resulting in PRA formation. The inability of PRPP to allow PRA formation could be due to the binding specificity of AphA. Alternatively, the inability of PRPP to participate in the reaction could support the nonenzymatic mechanism proposed. If PRA is easily released from the enzyme, this could benefit the organism by restoring the availability of the active site for mononucleotide dephosphorylation. Testing this model will require additional kinetic analyses in vitro. Although AphA/AnsB could synthesize PRA in vitro, a condition where these proteins were essential for thiamine biosynthesis in vivo was not identified. Localization studies showed that AphA is present in the cytoplasm in addition to its predominant location in the periplasm (22Reshetnyak E. d'Alencon E. Kern R. Taghbalout A. Guillaud P. Kohiyama M. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 167-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar); thus, is it rational to suggest some PRA is generated by the mechanism described herein. Previous work in our laboratory has emphasized the multiple inputs to PRA formation (9Ramos I. Downs D.M. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 5125-5132Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 10Browne B.A. Ramos A.I. Downs D.M. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 6786-6792Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 23Downs D.M. Ann. Rev. Microbiol. 2006; 60: 533-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In all cases separate from that described here, these inputs have been identified using sensitive in vivo genetic analyses. The work described here emphasizes that the cell has additional capacity to generate metabolites that may not be apparent by only addressing activities essential for growth. Furthermore, there is not a good way of determining that the appropriate condition to detect essentiality has been tested. The robustness of cellular metabolism predicts that multiple inputs to many (if not all) metabolites will exist. Such overlap can be considered to occur by evolutionary pressure or simply be the natural result of biochemical reactions that involve compounds of similar structure. Regardless of the evolutionary questions, from the perspective of understanding the metabolic network in the cell it is important to define not only reactions that are easily recognized as essential for growth but the potential for robustness provided by minor reactions. Based on the work herein, AphA is component of the cell that can be probed with in vitro biochemical approaches to generate a better understanding of metabolic robustness with respect to PRA formation.

https://openalex.org/W2013038139,"Background The CC-chemokines CCL3, CCL4 and CCL5 have been found to block the entry of CCR5-tropic HIV into host cells and to suppress the viral replication in vitro, but the in vivo role of endogenous CC-chemokines in HIV-1 infection is still incompletely understood. Methodology/Principle Findings In this study, the primate host CCL3, CCL4 and CCL5 gene expression was evaluated in response to simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) infection in rhesus macaque model. Five rhesus macaques were inoculated with CCR5-tropic SHIVSF162P4. The mRNA levels of CCL3, CCL4 and CCL5 were measured by real-time PCR at post inoculation day (PID) 0, 7, 14, 21, 35, 56 and 180 in peripheral blood. In addition, a selected subset of samples from CXCR4-tropic SHIVKu1-infected macaques was included with objective to compare the differences in CC-chemokine down-regulation caused by the two SHIVs. Gut-associated lymphoid tissues (GALT) collected from SHIVSF162P4-infected animals were also tested by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy to corroborate the gene expression results. Predictably, higher viral loads and CD4+ T cell losses were observed at PID 14 in macaques infected with SHIVKu1 than with SHIVSF162P4. A decline in CC-chemokine gene expression was also found during primary (PID 7-21), but not chronic (PID 180) stage of infection. Conclusions It was determined that A) SHIVSF162P4 down-regulated the CC-chemokine gene expression during acute stage of infection to a greater extent (p<0.05) than SHIVKu1, and B) such down-regulation was not paralleled with the CD4+ T cell depletion. Evaluation of CC-chemokine enhancing immunomodulators such as synthetic CpG-oligonucleotides could be explored in future HIV vaccine studies."
https://openalex.org/W2021394111,"Dictyostelium discoideum amoebae are haploid and, as they share many features with animal cells, should be an ideal creature for studying basic processes such as cell locomotion. Isolation of mutants in this amoeba has largely been limited to non-essential genes: nsfA-the gene for NEM-sensitive factor-remains the only essential gene for which conditional (ts) mutants exist. These ts mutants were generated by gene replacement using a library of mutagenised nsfA containing a selectable marker: transformants were then screened for temperature sensitivity. The success of this approach depended on the high level of homologous recombination prevailing at this locus: approximately 95% of selected clones were homologous recombinants. This is unusually high for Dictyostelium: homologous recombination at other loci is usually much less, usually between 0-30%, making the isolation of ts mutants much more tedious.In trying to make ts mutants in sec1A, homologous recombination was found to be only approximately 25%. A new approach, involving single loxP sites, was investigated. LoxP sites are 34 bp sequences recognised by Cre recombinase and between which this enzyme catalyses recombination. A Dictyostelium line containing a single loxP site adjacent to the 3' end of the sec1A gene was engineered. A sec1A replacement DNA also containing a single loxP site in a homologous position was then introduced into this cell line. In the presence of CRE recombinase, homologous recombination increased to approximately 80% at this locus, presumably largely driven by intermolecular recombination between the two single loxP sites.A route to increase the rate of homologous recombination at a specific locus, sec1A, is described which enabled the isolation of 30 ts mutants in sec1A. One of these, sec1Ats1,has been studied and found to cease moving at the restrictive temperature. The approach described here may be valuable for enhancing homologous recombination at specified loci and thus for introducing mutations into specific genes in Dictyostelium and other creatures."
