https://openalex.org/W1980752431,"Malaria parasites are haploid for most of their life cycle, with zygote formation and meiosis occurring during the mosquito phase of development. The parasites can be analyzed genetically by transmitting mixtures of cloned parasites through mosquitoes to permit cross-fertilization of gametes to occur. A cross was made between two clones of Plasmodium falciparum differing in enzymes, drug sensitivity, antigens, and chromosome patterns. Parasites showing recombination between the parent clone markers were detected at a high frequency. Novel forms of certain chromosomes, detected by pulsed-field gradient gel electrophoresis, were produced readily, showing that extensive rearrangements occur in the parasite genome after cross-fertilization. Since patients are frequently infected with mixtures of genetically distinct parasites, mosquito transmission is likely to provide the principal mechanisms for generating parasites with novel genotypes."
https://openalex.org/W1482533589,"Escherichia coli verotoxin (also known as Shiga-like toxin) has been implicated in the aetiology of the hemolytic uremic syndrome and hemorrhagic colitis. The glycolipid binding specificity of verotoxin purified from E. coli H30 and verotoxin cloned from bacteriophage H19B has been examined. Verotoxin from both sources binds specifically to globotriosyl ceramide containing the carbohydrate sequence galactose alpha 1-4galactose beta 1-4glucose-ceramide. Removal of the terminal galactose or substitution with N-acetylgalactosamine in beta 1-3 linkage deletes toxin binding activity. A ceramide trihexoside species, consistent with a globotriosyl ceramide structure was shown to be the major verotoxin-binding glycolipid of cultured vero cells which are routinely used to measure the cytotoxicity of toxin samples."
https://openalex.org/W2070610372,"Adipsin is a serine protease homolog whose primary structure was predicted from the nucleotide sequence of a differentiation-dependent adipocyte messenger RNA. Immunoblots probed with antisera to synthetic peptides identify two forms of adipsin that are synthesized and secreted by 3T3 adipocytes. These proteins of 44 and 37 kilodaltons are converted to 25.5 kilodaltons by enzymatic deglycosylation. Although adipsin is principally synthesized in adipose tissue, it is also produced by sciatic nerve and is found in the bloodstream. Because of the apparent restriction of adipsin synthesis to tissues highly active in lipid metabolism, its presence in serum, and its modulation in altered metabolic states, this molecule may play a previously unrecognized role in systemic lipid metabolism or energy balance."
https://openalex.org/W2031129820,"The distribution of cells containing messenger RNA that encodes amyloid beta protein was determined in hippocampi and in various cortical regions from cynomolgus monkeys, normal humans, and patients with Alzheimer's disease by in situ hybridization. Both 35S-labeled RNA antisense and sense probes to amyloid beta protein messenger RNA were used to ensure specific hybridization. Messenger RNA for amyloid beta protein was expressed in a subset of neurons in the prefrontal cortex from monkeys, normal humans, and patients with Alzheimer's disease. This messenger RNA was also present in the neurons of all the hippocampal fields from monkeys, normal humans and, although to a lesser extent in cornu ammonis 1, patients with Alzheimer's disease. The distribution of amyloid beta protein messenger RNA was similar to that of the neurofibrillary tangles of Alzheimer's disease in some regions, but the messenger RNA was also expressed in other neurons that are not usually involved in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease."
https://openalex.org/W2010886780,"Adipsin, a serine protease homolog, is synthesized and secreted by adipose cells and is found in the bloodstream. The expression of adipsin messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein was analyzed in rodents during metabolic perturbations and in several experimental models of obesity. Adipsin mRNA abundance is increased in adipose tissue during fasting in normal rats and in diabetes due to streptozotocin-induced insulin deficiency. Adipsin mRNA abundance decreased during the continuous infusion of glucose, which induces a hyperglycemic, hyperinsulinemic state that is accompanied by an increased adipose mass; it is suppressed (> 100-fold) in two strains of genetically obese mice (db/db and ob/ob), compared to their congenic counterparts, and is also reduced when obesity is induced chemically by injection of monosodium glutamate into newborn mice. Circulating adipsin protein is decreased in these animal models of obesity, as determined by immunoblotting with antisera to adipsin. Little change in adipsin expression is observed in a model of obesity obtained by pure overfeeding of normal rats (cafeteria model). These data suggest a possible role for adipsin in the above-mentioned disordered metabolic states, and raise the possibility that adipsin expression may be used to distinguish obesities that arise from certain genetic or metabolic defects from those that result from pure overfeeding."
https://openalex.org/W1988501895,"Inhibin is a gonadal glycoprotein hormone that regulates the production of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) by the anterior pituitary gland and exhibits intragonadal actions as well. The present study shows that inhibin-like immunoreactivity (inhibin-LI) is present in cells of the cytotrophoblast layer of human placenta at term and in primary cultures of human trophoblasts. Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) stimulated secretion of inhibin-LI from these cultured placental cells. This effect was mimicked by 8-bromo-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (8-bromo-cAMP), forskolin, and cholera toxin, suggesting that the mechanism of hCG induction of placental inhibin-LI secretion is cAMP-dependent. Incubation with an antiserum that binds the alpha-subunit of human inhibin increased the secretion of hCG and gonadotropin-releasing hormone-like immunoreactivity (GnRH-LI) from trophoblast cells in culture, suggesting a local tonic inhibitory action of endogenous inhibin on hCG and GnRH-LI release. The action of inhibin on hCG secretion may partially require the presence of placental GnRH, as suggested by evidence that a synthetic GnRH antagonist partially reverses the hCG increase induced by inhibin immunoneutralization. Results suggest paracrine roles for both inhibin and GnRH in the regulation of placental hCG production."
https://openalex.org/W1984541502,"A novel approach to engineering enzyme specificity is presented in which a catalytic group from an enzyme is first removed by site-directed mutagenesis causing inactivation. Activity is then partially restored by substrates containing the missing catalytic functional group. Replacement of the catalytic His with Ala in the Bacillus amyloliquefaciens subtilisin gene (the mutant is designated His64Ala) by site-directed mutagenesis reduces the catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) by a factor of a million when assayed with N-succinyl-L-Phe-L-Ala-L-Ala-L-Phe-p-nitroanilide (sFAAF-pNA). Model building studies showed that a His side chain at the P2 position of a substrate bound at the active site of subtilisin could be virtually superimposed on the catalytic His side chain of this serine protease. Accordingly, the His64Ala mutant hydrolyzes a His P2 substrate (sFAHF-pNA) up to 400 times faster than a homologous Ala P2 or Gln P2 substrate (sFAAF-pNA or sFAQF-pNA) at pH 8.0. In contrast, the wild-type enzyme hydrolyzes these three substrates with similar catalytic efficiencies. Additional data from substrate-dependent pH profiles and hydrolysis of large polypeptides indicate that the His64Ala mutant enzyme can recover partially the function of the lost catalytic histidine from a His P2 side chain on the substrate. Such ""substrate-assisted catalysis"" provides a new basis for engineering enzymes with very narrow and potentially useful substrate specificities. These studies also suggest a possible functional intermediate in the evolution of the catalytic triad of serine proteases."
https://openalex.org/W2062032776,"The first human vaccines against the malaria parasite have been designed to elicit antibodies to the circumsporozoite protein of Plasmodium falciparum. However, it is not known whether any level of naturally acquired antibodies to the circumsporozoite protein can predict resistance to Plasmodium falciparum malaria. In this study, 83 adults in a malaria-endemic region of Kenya were tested for circumsporozoite antibodies and then treated for malaria. They were monitored for the development of new malaria infections for 98 days. Antibody levels, as determined by four assays in vitro, were indistinguishable between the 60 individuals who did and the 23 who did not develop parasitemia during follow-up, and there was no apparent relation between day of onset of parasitemia and level of antibodies to circumsporozoite protein. Unless immunization with sporozoite vaccines induces antibodies that are quantitatively or qualitatively superior to the circumsporozoite antibodies in these adults, it is unlikely that such antibodies will prevent infection in areas with as intense malaria transmission as western Kenya."
https://openalex.org/W1600944257,"In the course of 50 S ribosome assembly in vitro, the L-proteins associate consecutively with the rRNA in two main groups. The first assembly group is found on the reconstitution intermediate particle RI50(1), the second group being added to form the RI50(2) particle. The analysis presented here allows for the first time all the ribosomal proteins to be assigned to one or the other of these groups. The following 22 proteins are found in the RI50(1) particle: L1, (L2), L3, L4, (L5), L7/12, L9, L10, L11, (L13), L15, L17, (L18), L20, L21, L22, L23, L24, (L26), L29, (L33), (L34). The assembly map has been arranged accordingly. The assembly interdependences of six proteins (L28, L30, L31, L32, L33, and L34) were assessed and that of L14 revised by means of a large number of assembly mapping experiments, the final decisive steps of which are documented here. The interactions of these latter seven proteins and the incorporation of five additional assembly interdependences are integrated into the 50 S assembly map, which now contains all the components of the 50 S subunit, with the exception of protein L26; this protein is known to be the same as protein S20 and is predominantly associated with the 30 S subunit."
https://openalex.org/W2054823031,"The product of the BAR1 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is synthesized only in the a cell type and inactivates alpha-factor, the mating pheromone made by alpha cells. The MAT alpha 2 protein represses the transcription of a-cell-specific genes, including BAR1, in alpha and a/alpha diploid cells. Transcription of BAR1 in a cells in stimulated upon exposure to alpha-factor. Deletion analysis of the 5' noncoding region of the BAR1 gene revealed that the major upstream activation site (UAS) overlaps the 31 bp operator sequence required for MAT alpha 2 repression. This result has implications for the negative control of transcription in yeast. The deletion analysis also indicated that the sequence TGAAACA mediates alpha-factor stimulation."
https://openalex.org/W1482458531,"Incubation of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with insulin at 37 degrees C resulted in a 2-fold increase in specific binding of transferrin to cell-surface receptors, as measured by a subsequent incubation of cells at 4 degrees C with 125I-transferrin. The insulin concentration required for half-maximal effect was 10 nM, and the half-time for insulin action was 40 s. By comparison, insulin stimulated hexose transport in 3T3-L1 adipocytes with a half-maximal effect at 8 nM and a half-time of 105 s. Scatchard analysis of 125I-transferrin binding to cells at 4 degrees C showed that the insulin-induced increase in transferrin receptor binding was due to an increase in the number of surface transferrin receptors. When cells were incubated for 2 h at 37 degrees C with 125I-transferrin to achieve steady-state binding and then exposed to insulin, there was a 1.7-fold increase in surface-bound transferrin (acid-sensitive) and a corresponding decrease in intracellularly bound transferrin (acid-insensitive). Thus, insulin elicits translocation of intracellular transferrin receptors to the plasma membrane. Concomitant with the 2-fold increase in surface receptors in response to insulin, there was a 2-fold increase in the rate of 59Fe3+ uptake from 59Fe3+-loaded transferrin. The rate of externalization of the intracellular 125I-transferrin-receptor complex at 37 degrees C was determined for basal and insulin-treated cells. Insulin increased the first-order rate constant for this process 1.7-fold. The effect of insulin on the rate of externalization is sufficient to account for the increase in surface transferrin receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2002599138,"The avian acute leukemia virus E26 induces a mixed erythroid-myeloid leukemia in chickens and carries two distinct oncogenes, v-myb and v-ets. Recently, a novel gene named erg, closely related to the v-ets oncogene, was identified in human COLO 320 cells and the nucleotide sequence of its approximately 5.0-kilobase transcript, erg 1 was determined. In the present study, the nucleotide sequence of the alternatively spliced transcript, erg 2, was found to differ from erg 1 by a splicing event that causes a coding frameshift near the amino terminus, resulting in an additional 99-amino acid insertion at the amino-terminus. Expression of complementary DNAs for the two transcripts in vitro resulted in synthesis of polypeptides of approximately 41 and 52 kilodaltons, suggesting the use of alternative translation initiation codons in the case of erg proteins. The erg gene was localized by somatic cell genetic analysis to human chromosome 21. It is proposed that alternative sites of splicing and polyadenylation, together with alternative sites of translation initiation, allow the synthesis of two related polypeptides from a single erg gene transcriptional unit."

https://openalex.org/W2063333523,"We have investigated the mechanism of regulation of the bgl operon in Escherichia coli K-12. A regulatory region has been located downstream of the bgl promoter, revealing a 130 base leader containing a sequence from +64 to +112 characteristic of a rho-independent terminator. In vitro, over 90% of the transcripts initiated at the bgl promoter terminate within the leader, at the 3' end of the terminator. Transcriptional fusions containing the terminator require the bglC gene in trans for expression; fusions deleted for the sequence show bglC-independent expression. A mutation resulting in partially constitutive expression of the fusion maps within the terminator. We propose that the bglC gene product mediates positive regulation of the bgl operon by functioning as an antiterminator at the rho-independent terminator located within the leader."
https://openalex.org/W1579264578,"Expression of the bacterio-opsin gene in Escherichia coli has been described in the accompanying papers. We now describe rapid and efficient methods for the purification of the E. coli-expressed bacterio-opsin. Bacterio-opsin can be extracted from E. coli membranes in a denatured form by using an organic solvent containing chloroform, methanol, water, and triethylamine. The bacterio-opsin, enriched to 30-50% in the extract, can be further purified to 90% by ion-exchange chromatography on DEAE-Trisacryl or hydroxylapatite chromatography in organic solvents or by preparative sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis. In appropriate aqueous phospholipid/detergent mixtures, up to 80% of purified protein refolds and binds retinal covalently to regenerate the bacteriorhodopsin chromophore. When reconstituted into phospholipid vesicles, bacteriorhodopsin from E. coli shows the expected proton pumping activity in response to illumination."

https://openalex.org/W1585525831,"p21 isolated under nondenaturing conditions is obtained as a complex with guanosine nucleotides and magnesium ions. We have developed a high performance liquid chromatography method which removes greater than 95% of bound nucleotide and the metal ion very rapidly under mild conditions. At the same time, p21 is purified from minor protein impurities. The protein thus prepared is thermally much less stable than the complexed p21, but can be used for studying its interaction with nucleotides and metal ions at low temperatures. The association rate constant for p21 and GDP is 1.47 X 10(6) M-1 s-1 and for GTP is 2.9 X 10(6) M-1 s-1 at 0 degree C. By using appropriately determined dissociation rate constants we have determined the binding constant for p21.GDP and p21.GTP in the presence of excess Mg2+ to be 5.7 X 10(10) M-1 and 6.0 X 10(10) M-1, respectively, at 0 degree C."
https://openalex.org/W2136065964,"The enzyme (EC 2.1.1.24) from Salmonella typhimurium that catalyzes the S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methyl esterification of glutamyl residues in membrane chemoreceptor proteins has been purified to homogeneity, and the nucleotide sequence of the gene coding for this protein, cheR, has been determined. The molecular weight, amino acid composition, and N-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified protein correspond to the values predicted from the sequence of the gene. The pure protein is a 33-kDa monomer. Kinetic studies indicate that, at levels of receptor and S-adenosylmethionine present in wild type cells, the transferase is nearly saturated. The enzyme has a relatively low turnover number, approximately 10 mol of methylester formed per mol of enzyme per min; and there appear to be only approximately 200 methyltransferase monomers per wild type cell."

https://openalex.org/W1795759720,"We have reported previously that phenylarsine oxide (PAO) blocks insulin-stimulated glucose transport in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (Frost, S. C., and Lane, M. D. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 2646-2652). As shown in the present study, the locus of inhibition is post-receptor. Insulin stimulated the extent of receptor autophosphorylation in solution and in the intact cell by approximately 4-fold. PAO had no effect on this activity. Using reduced and carboxamidomethylated lysozyme as a substrate for the tyrosine-specific receptor, insulin stimulated the rate of receptor kinase-catalyzed substrate phosphorylation by 2-fold; PAO had no effect on this stimulation. However, the insulin-stimulated, serine-specific phosphorylation of two endogenous phosphoproteins (pp24 and pp240) in the intact cell was blocked by 25 microM PAO. These complementary in situ and in vitro studies demonstrate that the inhibition by PAO must be distal to the insulin receptor's protein tyrosine kinase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1543517941,"To express the bacterio-opsin (bop) gene in Escherichia coli, we have employed the inducible expression vectors pIN-II-A, -B, and -C (Nakamura, K., and Inouye, M. (1982) EMBO J. 1, 771-775). The vectors contain three cloning sites early in the E. coli lipoprotein gene (lpp) which is transcribed from tandem lpp and lac promoters. The bop gene was modified so as to delete the N-terminal leader sequence and then cloned into each of the three cloning sites to encode three different lipoprotein/bacterio-opsin fusions. Expression of the fusions was demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo. The fusion protein was estimated to be about 0.05% of the total cell protein. The cause for the low level of expression apparently was neither an inadequate level of mRNA nor degradation of the protein. However, expression of the fusions caused inhibition of the growth of the host to varying extents. One fusion protein was purified from E. coli membranes to homogeneity by immunoaffinity chromatography followed by preparative gel electrophoresis. The purified fusion protein generated a bacteriorhodopsin-like chromophore on treatment with defined lipid/detergent mixtures and retinal. When reconstituted into vesicles, the protein pumped protons on illumination comparably to the reconstituted native bacterio-opsin."

https://openalex.org/W1543001104,"Yeast secretory mutant sec53 cells accumulate inactive secretory glycoprotein precursors that remain associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) at the restrictive temperature (37 degrees C). The possibility that precursor polypeptides fail to penetrate completely into the ER lumen was tested by examining the protease accessibility of accumulated invertase, mating pheromone precursor prepro-alpha-factor and the vacuolar protein precursor procarboxypeptidase Y in cell lysates. In all three cases, the secretory protein precursors are protected from the action of exogenous protease unless the membrane is permeabilized by including Triton X-100 or saponin in the incubation. These results suggest that the sec53 defect allows complete polypeptide translocation. Consistent with this interpretation, the precursor of invertase accumulates in a signal peptide-processed form. In addition, invertase and prepro-alpha-factor precursors contain a small amount of possibly aberrant carbohydrate. In mutant cells or in wild type cells treated with tunicamycin, a 10-kDa fragment of the N terminus of mature invertase assumes a conformation that is resistant to trypsin with or without detergent. This domain may be associated with an ER protein or may simply assume an unusual conformation as a consequence of deficient glycosyl modification."
https://openalex.org/W1568061161,"A C-terminally truncated form of protein B2, the homodimeric small subunit of ribonucleotide reductase from Escherichia coli, was found as the result of an apparently specific proteolysis. Truncated homodimers contain an intact binuclear iron center and a normal tyrosyl radical but have no binding capacity for the other ribonucleotide reductase subunit, protein B1, and are consequently enzymatically inactive. Heterodimers, consisting of one full-length and one truncated polypeptide, formed spontaneously during a chelation-reconstitution cycle and were easily separated from the two homodimeric variants. The heterodimeric form of B2 shows a weak interaction with the B1 subunit resulting in low enzyme activity. Using heterodimers containing deuterated tyrosine on the full-length side and protonated tyrosine on the truncated side, we could demonstrate that the tyrosyl radical was randomly generated in one or the other of the two polypeptide chains of the heterodimeric B2 subunit. The small subunit of ribonucleotide reductase thus conforms to a half-site reactivity."
https://openalex.org/W1482562661,"The tRNA(5-methylaminomethyl-2-thiouridine)-methyltransferase, which is involved in the biosynthesis of the modified nucleoside 5-methylaminomethyl-2-thiouridine (mnm5s2U) present in the wobble position of some tRNAs, was purified close to homogeneity (95% purity). The molecular mass of the enzyme is 79,000 daltons. The enzyme activity has a pH optimum of 8.0-8.5, is inhibited by magnesium ions, and stimulated by ammonium ions. Two different intermediates in the biosynthesis of mnm5s2U34 are present in tRNA from the mutants trmC1 and trmC2. Unexpectedly, the product present in tRNA from trmC1 cells was identified by mass spectrometric and chromatographic analyses as 5-carboxymethylaminomethyl-2-thiouridine (cmnm5s2U), i.e. a more complex derivative than the final product mnm5s2U. The product present in tRNA from trmC2 cells was identified as 5-aminomethyl-2-thiouridine (nm5s2U). In the presence of S-adenosylmethionine the most purified enzyme fraction converts both cmnm5s2U34 and nm5s2U34 into mnm5s2U34. In the absence of S-adenosylmethionine, however, cmnm5s2U34 is converted into nm5s2U by this enzyme fraction. We conclude that the purified polypeptide has two enzymatic activities; one actually demodifies cmnm5s2U to nm5s2U and the other catalyzes the transfer of a methyl group from S-adenosylmethionine to nm5s2U, thus forming mnm5s2U. The sequential order of the biosynthesis of mnm5s2U34 is suggested to be: (Formula: see text). The molecular activity of the methyltransferase activity (nm5s2U34----mnm5s2U34) is 74 min-1, and the steady state concentration of the enzyme is only 78 molecules/genome equivalent in cells growing at a specific growth rate of 1.0/h."
https://openalex.org/W1580198172,"The amino acid sequence was determined for equine lutropin beta (eLH beta). Large fragments were derived from reduced, carboxymethylated eLH beta by digestion with Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease, by cyanogen bromide cleavage, and by cleavage of acid-labile Asp-Pro bonds. The fragments were purified by gel filtration and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The fragments were sequenced by automated Edman degradation to establish the primary structure of eLH beta. Some peptides were further digested with chymotrypsin and the resulting peptides purified by HPLC. In addition to sequencing by automated Edman degradation, these were also sequenced by the complementary 5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl-Edman procedure which enabled us to directly identify glycosylated amino acids. The eLH beta subunit is a glycoprotein of 149 amino acids containing both N- and O-linked oligosaccharides. It possesses a COOH-terminal extension similar to that seen in human chorionic gonadotropin. Carboxypeptidase Y digestions suggest that the COOH terminus is blocked by glycosylation. Interestingly, the amino acid sequence of eLH beta is identical to that of equine chorionic gonadotropin beta (Sugino, H., Bousfield, G. R., Moore, W. T., and Ward, D. N. (1987)J. Biol. Chem. 262, 8603-8609)."
https://openalex.org/W1519754933,"The cytoplasmic concentration of ionized Ca2+ [( Ca2+]i) was determined in 3T3-L1 cells during their differentiation from fibroblasts to adipocytes, suspended and loaded with the fluorescent Ca2+ indicators quin2 or indo-1. In undifferentiated fibroblasts, as well as in differentiated adipocytes up to day 9, [Ca2+]i was steady around 170 nM, and it increased significantly only in old adipocytes (day 12). During differentiation, stimulation of glucose uptake by insulin increased from a few percent to severalfold. Stimulation of uptake was already apparent after 10 min of addition of the hormone, and 10 nM insulin produced maximal stimulation in 30 min. Insulin (10(-6) M) added to quin2- or indo-1-loaded, suspended adipocytes had no detectable effect on [Ca2+]i for at least 10 min. In contrast, addition of the general anesthetic halothane increased [Ca2+]i from 172 to 251 nM in 3 min. In EGTA solution, the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin elicited release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores that resulted in a transient increase in [Ca2+]i. A smaller but measurable Ca2+ release from intracellular stores (increasing [Ca2+]i by 20 nM) resulted upon addition of 20 micrograms/ml phosphatidic acid. In contrast, insulin did not produce any detectable release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores. Incubation of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with insulin in the presence of EGTA (the latter in excess over the Ca2+ concentration of the medium) did not prevent the stimulation of hexose uptake by the hormone, indicating that extracellular Ca2+ does not play a role in the insulin response. Furthermore, incubation of cells with quin2/AM in EGTA medium during exposure to insulin did not prevent stimulation of hexose uptake. Under these conditions it is demonstrated that intracellular quin2 suffices to chelate cytoplasmic Ca2+ even if releasable Ca2+ from intracellular stores were to pour into the cytoplasm. Thus, quin2 effectively lowers [Ca2+]i without impairing insulin action. It is concluded that insulin does not produce changes in [Ca2+]i and that chelating intracellular Ca2+ does not prevent stimulation of hexose uptake by insulin. These results suggest that it is unlikely that changes in [Ca2+]i may play a role in the transduction of information in insulin stimulation of glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes."

https://openalex.org/W2140751618,"Duplex DNA with a contiguous single-stranded tail was nearly as effective as single-stranded DNA in acting as a cofactor for the ATPase activity of recA protein at neutral pH and concentrations of MgCl2 that support homologous pairing. The ATP hydrolysis reached a steady state rate that was proportional to the length of the duplex DNA attached to a short 5' single-stranded tail after a lag. Separation of the single-stranded tail from most of the duplex portion of the molecule by restriction enzyme cleavage led to a gradual decline in ATP hydrolysis. Measurement of the rate of hydrolysis as a function of DNA concentration for both tailed duplex DNA and single-stranded DNA cofactors indicated that the binding site size of recA protein on a duplex DNA lattice, about 4 base pairs, is similar to that on a single-stranded DNA lattice, about four nucleotides. The length of the lag phase preceding steady state hydrolysis depended on the DNA concentration, length of the duplex region, and the polarity of the single-stranded tail, but was comparatively independent of tail length for tails over 70 nucleotides in length. The lag was 5-10 times longer for 3' than for 5' single-stranded tailed duplex DNA molecules, whereas the steady state rates of hydrolysis were lower. These observations show that, after nucleation of a recA protein complex on the single-stranded tail, the protein samples the entire duplex region via an interaction that is labile and not strongly polarized."

The labeling was specific for ATP binding sites by the following criteria. Saturation occurs at high 8-azido-ATP concentrations with dissociation constants of 30 and 120 microM for the recD and recB subunits, respectively; ATP strongly inhibits the photolabeling; 8-azido-ATP is hydrolyzed by the recBCD enzyme and supports its double-stranded DNA exonuclease activity; and the label is largely confined to two peptides obtained by tryptic digestion of the photolabeled holoenzyme; one is derived from the recB subunit and the other from the recD subunit."
https://openalex.org/W1792936902,"Indirect immunofluorescence studies with polyclonal antibodies show that caltrin binds to the plasma membrane over the acrosome and principal tail regions of bovine spermatozoa but not to the postacrosomal area or the midpiece. Calcium influx into bovine epididymal spermatozoa maintained in a simple salt medium containing dl-β-hydroxybutyrate is prevented by caltrin freshly prepared from bovine seminal plasma through a procedure employing only gel permeation columns. Older preparations, on the other hand, enhance calcium uptake into these cells. Caltrin freshly prepared through a purification scheme that includes a cation exchanger only induces enhancement of calcium uptake into bovine epididymal spermatozoa maintained under identical conditions. It is postulated that early during sperm transit through the female reproductive tract, caltrin bound to the sperm plasma membrane protects the sperm cells from calcium influx. As the cells enter the oviduct where meeting with the egg could take place, factors present in the surrounding milieu may cause caltrin to change from an inhibitor to an enhancer of calcium uptake. The acrosome reaction and possibly hyperactivation, two components of capacitation that require calcium influx as an initial event, then take place.—San Agustin, J. T; Hughes, R; Lardy, H. A.

https://openalex.org/W1526405478,"Escherichia coli cells grown anaerobically in the presence of nitrate reduce the nitrate as a terminal electron acceptor in place of molecular oxygen by an induced respiratory-type electron transferring system residing in the inner membrane structure. When oxygen is introduced to a suspension of nitrate-respiring cells, the oxygen is immediately reduced preferentially and the cellular uptake of nitrate ceases abruptly. In contrast, we found that the cells exhibited no oxygen control on uptake of chlorate, a competitive substrate analogue, indicating operation of an oxygen-sensitive transport system specific to nitrate. This was further evidenced by the fact that chlorate inhibition of reduction of nitrate was brought about only when the transport of both chlorate and nitrate was facilitated by the aid of carrier-type chlorate (or nitrate) ionophore. We demonstrated that oxygen inhibition on reduction of nitrate was abolished within the cells treated by octyl glucoside resulting in a removal of permeability barrier specific to nitrate. We conclude that the transient control by molecular oxygen is primarily due to the inhibition of nitrate transport into the cytoplasmic side. Since nitrate induces the nitrate-respiring system, the repression of the nitrate reductase operon by molecular oxygen is consistently interpreted on the basis of the inducer exclusion mechanism."

The amino acid residues which were proposed from crystallographic studies on the vertebrate enzymes to be essential for the enzymic action are well conserved in the E. coli enzyme. The E. coli enzyme shows a similar degree of sequence homology to both the mitochondrial and cytosolic isoenzymes (close to 40%). The finding that the positions of deletions introduced into the sequence of E. coli enzyme to give the maximum homology agree well with those of the mitochondrial enzymes supports the endosymbiotic hypothesis of mitochondrial origin."
https://openalex.org/W1508530628,"The distal part of the long tail fibers of the Escherichia coli phage T4 consists of a dimer of protein 37. A fragment of the corresponding gene, encoding 253 amino acids, was inserted into several different sites within the cloned gene for the 325-residue outer membrane protein OmpA. In plasmid pTU T4-5 the fragment was inserted once and in pTU T4-10 tandemly twice between the codons for residues 153 and 154 of the OmpA protein. In pTU T4-22 two fragments were present, in tandem, between the codons for residues 45 and 46 of this protein. In pIN T4-6 one fragment was inserted into the ompA gene immediately following the part encoding the signal sequence. The corresponding mature proteins consist, in this order, of 605, 860, 835, and 279 amino acid residues. All precursor proteins were processed and translocated across the plasma membrane. Hence, not only can the OmpA protein serve as a vehicle for export of a nonsecretory protein, but the signal sequence alone can also mediate export of such a protein. Export of the pro-OmpA protein depends on the SecA protein. Export of the tail fiber fragment expressed from pIN T4-6 remained SecA dependent. Thus, the secA pathway in this case is chosen by the signal peptide. It is proposed that a signal peptide can mediate translocation of nonsecretory proteins as long as they are export-compatible. The inability of a signal sequence to mediate export of some proteins appears to be due to export incompatibility of the protein rather than to the absence of information, within the mature part of the polypeptide, which would be required for translocation."

Interaction of the fluorines at the 5-position of the acyl chain with protons on methyl groups of isoleucine 54 and alanine 59 is clearly indicated. The covalent attachment of the acyl chain via a prosthetic group to serine 36 and the known alpha-helix which exists from residues 36 to 51 greatly restrict the structural models which would allow acyl chain contact with residues 54 and 59."
https://openalex.org/W1545815281,"The T7 chromosome is a double-stranded linear DNA molecule flanked by direct terminal repeats or so-called terminal redundancies. Late in infection bacteriophage T7 DNA accumulates in the form of concatemers, molecules that are comprised of T7 chromosomes joined in a head to tail arrangement through shared terminal redundancies. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms of concatemer processing, we have developed extracts that process concatemeric DNA. The in vitro system consists of an extract of phage T7-infected cells that provides all T7 gene products and minimal levels of endogenous concatemeric DNA. Processing is analyzed using a linear 32P-labeled substrate containing the concatemeric joint. T7 gene products required for in vitro processing can be divided into two groups; one group is essential for concatemer processing, and the other is required for the production of full length left-hand ends. The products of genes 8 (prohead protein), 9 (scaffolding protein), and 19 (DNA maturation) along with gene 18 protein are essential, indicating that capsids are required for processing. In extracts lacking one or more of the products of genes 2 (Escherichia coli RNA polymerase inhibitor), 5 (DNA polymerase), and 6 (exonuclease), full length right-hand ends are produced. However, the left-hand ends produced are truncated, lacking at least 160 base pairs, the length of the terminal redundancy. Gene 3 endonuclease, required for concatemer processing in vivo, is not required in this system. Both the full length left- and right-hand ends produced by the processing reaction are protected from DNase I digestion, suggesting that processing of the concatemeric joint substrate is accompanied by packaging."

The resulting oxidation of the γ-crystallin led to more acidic species of this protein. These alterations were similar to the changes seen with aging in the human lens. The results suggest that oxidation of lens crystallins may be responsible for the changes seen on aging and cataract development and that ascorbate may contribute to these alterations.— Russell, P.; Garland, D; Zigler, J.

https://openalex.org/W1577383820,"8-Azido-ATP has been found to serve as a photoaffinity label for two distinct ATP sites on rat liver carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I and to allow preliminary localization of these sites. In the dark, 8-azido-ATP acted as a competitive inhibitor with respect to ATP. Ultraviolet irradiation of carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I in the presence of 8-azido-ATP led to an irreversible loss of activity. ATP specifically protected against this inactivation. The incorporation of 2 mol of 8-azido-ATP per mol of enzyme was required for complete inactivation. To localize the 8-azido-ATP-binding sites to discrete regions of carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I which appear to be structural domains, the enzyme was photolabeled with [gamma-32P]8-azido-ATP and subjected to limited proteolytic digestion. The resulting model for the functional roles of the domains is that there is one ATP site on each of the two large internal structural domains of the enzyme. Each of these domains was found to contain the consensus sequences A and B common to many other nucleotide-binding proteins (Walker, J.E., Saraste, M., Runswick, M. J., and Gay, N. J. (1982) EMBO J. 1, 945-951). In addition, there is extensive structural and possibly functional interaction of the smaller N-terminal domain with one of the internal ATP-binding domains, analogous to a subunit interaction observed with the evolutionarily related Escherichia coli carbamoyl phosphate synthetase."
https://openalex.org/W1499038514,"Treatment of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase-I with potassium ferrate (K2FeO4), a site-specific oxidizing agent for the phosphate group-binding sites of proteins, results in the irreversible inactivation of enzyme activity as judged by the loss of polymerization as well as 3'-5' exonuclease activity. A significant protection from ferrate-mediated inactivation is observed in the presence of DNA but not by substrate deoxynucleoside triphosphates. Furthermore, ferrate-treated enzyme also exhibits loss of template-primer binding activity, whereas its ability to bind substrate triphosphates is unaffected. In addition, comparative high pressure liquid chromatography tryptic peptide maps obtained before and after ferrate oxidation demonstrated that only five peptides of the more than 60 peptide peaks present in the tryptic digest underwent a major change in either peak position or intensity as a result of ferrate treatment. Amino acid analyses and/or sequencing identified four of these affected peaks as corresponding to peptides that span residues 324-340, 437-455, 456-464, and 512-518, respectively. However, only the last peptide, which has the sequence: Met-Trp-Pro-Asp-Leu-Gln-Lys, was significantly protected in the presence of DNA. This latter peptide was also the only peptide whose degree of oxidation correlated directly with the extent of inactivation of the enzyme. Amino acid analysis indicated that methionine 512 is the target site in this peptide for ferrate oxidation. Methionine 512, therefore, appears to be essential for the DNA-binding function of DNA polymerase-I from E. coli."
https://openalex.org/W1503065495,"Adeninylethylcobalamin (AdeEtCbl) underwent cleavage of the C-Co bond by interaction with apoprotein of diol dehydrase from Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 8724, although this analog was quite inactive as coenzyme. Spectroscopic observation indicates that AdeEtCbl was converted to the enzyme-bound hydroxocobalamin without intermediates. The conversion was stoichiometric (1:1) and obeyed the second-order reaction kinetics (k = 0.027 min-1 microM-1 at 37 degrees C) depending upon concentrations of apoprotein and AdeEtCbl. This suggests that the complex formation is the rate-determining step and that AdeEtCbl undergoes rapid C-Co bond cleavage once it binds to the apoenzyme. Substrates and oxygen did apparently not affect the rate of the C-Co bond cleavage. The experiments using [adenine-U-14C]AdeEtCbl and [1(3)-3H]glycerol demonstrated that 9-ethyladenine was the only product formed from the adeninylethyl group of AdeEtCbl during the conversion and that an additional hydrogen atom in the 9-ethyladenine is not derived from the substrate. 1H NMR measurement of the 9-ethyladenine formed enzymatically from AdeEtCbl and DL-1,2-[1,1,2-2H3]propanediol also led to the same conclusion. All of these results indicate that the C-Co bond of AdeEtCbl is activated by diol dehydrase and undergoes heterolysis forming Co(III) and a carbanion or a carbanion-like species, in clear contrast to the homolysis of the C-Co bond of adenosylcobalamin in the normal catalytic process. 9-Ethyladenine formed remained tightly associated with the enzyme. Longer chain homologs, i.e. adeninylpropylcobalamin, adeninylbutylcobalamin, and adeninylpentylcobalamin did not undergo such cleavage of the C-Co bond by diol dehydrase."
https://openalex.org/W1481260212,"Optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) spectroscopy has been applied to several single-stranded DNA-binding (SSB) proteins encoded by conjugative plasmids of enteric bacteria. Fluorimetric equilibrium binding isotherms confirm their preferential binding to single-stranded DNA and polynucleotides and reveal a limited protein solubility at low ionic strength. The plasmid SSB-like proteins show the highest affinity for polydeoxythymidylic acid; these complexes are the least sensitive to disruption by salt. ODMR data on these complexes suggest the existence of stacking interactions between tryptophan residue(s) and thymine bases, as evidenced by spectral red shifts of the tryptophan phosphorescence 0,0 band, reduction of the magnitude of D zero field splitting parameter, and a dramatic reversal of the polarity of the ODMR signals. Wavelength-selected ODMR results point to the existence of two distinct tryptophan sites in these complexes. The triplet state properties of the red-shifted site are drastically altered by its interaction with the thymine bases. The chromosomal Escherichia coli SSB protein-poly(dT) complex shows an additional tryptophan site with zero field splitting parameters similar to those of the free protein. This site can be attributed to Trp-135, which is missing in each of the other plasmid SSB proteins, suggesting that this particular residue is not involved in the interaction with polynucleotides."
https://openalex.org/W1536814679,"Abstract We have isolated from the high salt wash of rabbit reticulocyte ribosomes two forms of the polypeptide chain initiation factor 2 (eIF-2) which differ with respect to their beta-subunit, GDP content, and sensitivity to Mg2+ in ternary (eIF-2 X GTP X Met-tRNAf) and binary (eIF-2 X GDP) complex formation. The form of eIF-2 eluting first from a cation exchange (Mono S, Pharmacia) column has a beta-subunit of lower molecular weight (eIF-2(beta L] and a more acidic pI value than the form eluting at a higher salt concentration (eIF-2(beta H]. These two forms of eIF-2 beta-polypeptides are also detected in reticulocyte lysates when the proteins are resolved by two-dimensional isoelectric focusing-dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by immunoblotting. The peptide mapping of the isolated beta-subunits after limited proteolysis by papain, pancreatic protease, alpha-chymotrypsin, or Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease further demonstrates that the two forms of beta-subunits are not the product of a non-specific proteolytic action that occurred during the purification procedure, but rather reflects the existence in vivo of both forms of eIF-2. The GDP content of eIF-2(beta L) and eIF-2(beta H) is approximately 0.85 and 0.22 mol of GDP/mol of eIF-2, respectively. The KD for GDP of eIF-2(beta L) was lower (2.2 X 10(-9) M) than that of eIF-2(beta H) (6.0 X 10(-8) M). In the presence of 1 mM Mg2+, the activities of eIF-2(beta L) and eIF-2(beta H) in forming a binary and a ternary complex are inhibited 90 and 25%, respectively. The extent of Mg2+ inhibition and its reversal by the guanine nucleotide exchange factor is directly proportional to the amount of GDP bound to eIF-2. No inhibition by Mg2+ is observed when eIF-2-bound GDP is removed by alkaline phosphatase. In the presence of the guanine nucleotide exchange factor, both forms of eIF-2 are equally active in ternary complex formation, and the complex formed is quantitatively transferred to 40 S ribosomal subunits."
https://openalex.org/W1547252253,"In most cases the apparent target size obtained by radiation inactivation analysis corresponds to the subunit size or to the size of a multimeric complex. In this report, we examined whether the larger than expected target sizes of some enzymes could be due to secondary effects of free radicals. To test this proposal we carried out radiation inactivation analysis on Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I, Torula yeast glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, Chlorella vulgaris nitrate reductase, and chicken liver sulfite oxidase in the presence and absence of free radical scavengers (benzoic acid and mannitol). In the presence of free radical scavengers, inactivation curves are shifted toward higher radiation doses. Plots of scavenger concentration versus enzyme activity showed that the protective effect of benzoic acid reached a maximum at 25 mM then declined. Mannitol alone had little effect, but appeared to broaden the maximum protective range of benzoic acid relative to concentration. The apparent target size of the polymerase activity of DNA polymerase I in the presence of free radical scavengers was about 40% of that observed in the absence of these agents. This is considerably less than the minimum polypeptide size and may reflect the actual size of the polymerase functional domain. Similar effects, but of lesser magnitude, were observed for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, nitrate reductase, and sulfite oxidase. These results suggest that secondary damage due to free radicals generated in the local environment as a result of ionizing radiation can influence the apparent target size obtained by this method."
https://openalex.org/W1570226003,"Cyanase is an inducible enzyme in Escherichia coli that catalyzes bicarbonate-dependent decomposition of cyanate to give ammonia and bicarbonate. The enzyme is composed of 8-10 identical subunits (Mr = 17,008). The objective of this study was to clarify some of the structural properties of cyanase for the purpose of understanding the relationship between oligomeric structure and catalytic activity. Circular dichroism studies showed that cyanase has a significant amount of alpha-helix and beta-sheet structure. The one sulfhydryl group per subunit does not react with 5,5'-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) unless cyanase is denatured. Denaturation is apparently complete in 10 M urea or 6 M guanidine hydrochloride, but is significantly reduced in 10 M urea by the presence of azide (analog of cyanate) and is incomplete in 8 M urea. Denatured cyanase could be renatured and reactivated (greater than 85%) by removal of denaturants. Reactivation was greatly facilitated by the presence of certain anions, particularly bicarbonate, and by high ionic strength and protein concentration. The catalytic activity of renatured cyanase was associated only with oligomer. Cyanase that had been denatured in the presence of DTNB to give a cyanase-DTNB derivative could also be renatured at 26 degrees C to give active cyanase-DTNB oligomer. The active oligomeric form of the cyanase-DTNB derivative could be converted reversibly to inactive dimer by lowering the temperature to 4 degrees C or by reduction of the ionic strength and removal of monoanions. These results provide evidence that free sulfhydryl groups are not required for catalytic activity and that catalytic activity may be dependent upon oligomeric structure."
https://openalex.org/W1653835417,"The expression of selected nitrogen fixation (nif) genes from Klebsiella pneumoniae in foreign hosts provides an approach to determine the pathway, minimal genetic requirements, and host dependence of nitrogenase assembly. In this study, we investigated the assembly of the alpha 2 beta 2 MoFe protein, responsible for substrate binding and reduction, by introducing nifD and nifK (encoding respectively, the alpha and beta subunits) into Escherichia coli and the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In E. coli, both genes were expressed from the nifHDKY operon; in yeast, the genes, separately fused to the yeast ADH1 promoter, were introduced on two different plasmids. Denaturing immunoblot analyses demonstrated the presence of significant amounts of NifD and NifK in both hosts. In E. coli, the level or perhaps modification of NifD depended on the growth medium of the bacteria. Nondenaturing, anaerobic immunoblot assays revealed in E. coli, nif-specific antigens of lower electrophoretic mobility than Kp1, which may represent assembly intermediates. In yeast, no putative assembled products were evident, and the predominant antigens corresponded to the monomeric forms of the polypeptides. These results indicate that, unlike NifH, the Fe protein subunit (Berman, J., Gershoni, J. M., and Zamir, A. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 5240-5243), NifD and NifK are insufficient for the assembly of an electrophoretically Kp1-like structure. Homodimerization of nifK and probably of nifD primary gene products does not appear to occur spontaneously and hence is unlikely to represent the initial step in the assembly. The difference between the two hosts suggests that the cellular environment or mode of expression could affect the interaction between the two subunits."
https://openalex.org/W1510685538,"Abstract A monoclonal antibody specific for Escherichia coli ribosomal protein L5 was isolated from a cell line obtained from Dr. David Schlessinger. Its unique specificity for L5 was confirmed by one- and two-dimensional electrophoresis and immunoblotting. The antibody recognized L5 both in 50 S subunits and 70 S ribosomes. Both antibody and Fab fragments had similar effects on the ribosome functions tested. Antibody bound to 50 S subunits inhibited their reassociation with 30 S subunits at 10 mM Mg2+ but not 15 mM, the concentration present for in vitro protein synthesis. The 70 S couples were not dissociated by the antibody. The antibody caused inhibition of polyphenylalanine synthesis at molar ratios to 50 S or 70 S particles of 4:1. The major inhibitory effect was on the peptidyltransferase reaction. There was no effect on either elongation factor binding or the associated GTPase activities. The site of antibody binding to 50 S was determined by electron microscopy. Antibody was seen to bind beside the central protuberance or head of the particle, on the side away from the L7/L12 stalk, and on or near the region at which the 50 S subunit interacts with the 30 S subunit. This site of antibody binding is fully consistent with its biochemical effects."
https://openalex.org/W1544060795,"Microvilli isolated from 13762 mammary ascites tumor cells contain a major calcium-sensitive protein (AMV-p35) that can be isolated with microvillar microfilament cores prepared by Triton X-100 extraction in the presence but not absence of calcium. AMV-p35 can be readily purified from ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid extracts of the microfilament cores by chromatography on an anion exchange column, to which it does not bind. Immunoblot analysis indicates that AMV-p35 is related to calpactin I, the pp60src tyrosine kinase substrate. In the presence of calcium, AMV-p35 binds approximately 4 mol of chlorpromazine per mole of protein in a binding process showing apparent positive cooperativity, similar to calmodulin; however, in contrast to calmodulin, AMV-p35 also binds phenothiazine in the absence of calcium."
https://openalex.org/W1564724784,"The mechanism of enhancement of DNA polymerase activity by the murine DNA-binding protein factor D was investigated. Extension by Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I and calf thymus DNA polymerase-alpha of 5'-32P-labeled oligodeoxynucleotide primers that are complementary to poly(dT) or to bacteriophage M13 DNA was measured in the absence or presence of factor D. With 5'-[32P](dA)9.poly(dT), factor D enables E. coli polymerase I to fill approximately 15-nucleotide gaps between adjacent primers; whereas in the absence of the stimulatory protein, poly(dT) is not copied significantly. In order to study the nucleotide specificity of synthesis enhancement, we used M13mp10 DNA containing 4 consecutive thymidine residues downstream from the 3-hydroxyl terminus of an oligonucleotide primer. Upon addition of factor D, both polymerase I and polymerase-alpha can traverse this sequence more efficiently and thus generate longer DNA products. Densitometric analysis of nonextended and elongated 5'-32P-labeled M13 primer indicates that, without changing the frequency of primer utilization, factor D enhances the activity of these DNA polymerases by increasing their apparent processivity. By positioning oligonucleotide primers 4, 8, and 12 bases upstream from the (dT)4 template sequence, we show that the enhancement of synthesis by factor D is independent of the position of the oligothymidine cluster. We hypothesize that factor D interacts with oligo(dT).oligo(dA) domains in DNA to alter their conformation, which may normally obstruct the progression of DNA polymerases."
https://openalex.org/W1531523913,"We have used the method of heavy isotope labeling to study the metabolic turnover of adenylate cyclase in a nonfusing muscle cell line, the BC3H1 cells. These cells contains an adenylate cyclase coupled to beta-adrenergic receptors and highly stimulated by forskolin, a potent activator of the enzyme. After transfer of the cells from normal medium to heavy medium (a medium containing heavy labeled amino acids, 2H, 13C, 15N), heavy isotope-labeled adenylate cyclase molecules progressively replace pre-existing light molecules. In sucrose gradient differential sedimentation, after a 5-day switch in heavy medium, the enzyme exhibited a higher mass (s = 8.40 +/- 0.03 S, n = 13) compared to the control enzyme (s = 7.40 +/- 0.04 S, n = 36). Indeed, the increase in the sedimentation coefficient of the heavy molecules was due to the synthesis of new molecules of adenylate cyclase labeled with heavy isotope amino acids since in the presence of cycloheximide, an inhibitor of protein synthesis, no change in the sedimentation pattern of the forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase occurred. After incorporation of heavy isotope amino acids in the adenylate cyclase molecules, the kinetics parameters of the enzyme (i.e. Km for ATP and EC50 for Mn2+ or Mg2+) did not change. However, adenylate cyclase from cells incubated with heavy medium exhibits an activity about 2-fold lower than control (cells in light medium). After switching the cells to the heavy medium, the decrease of the activity of the enzyme occurred during the first 24 h and thereafter remained at a steady state for at least 4 days. In contrast, 24 h after the switch, the sedimentation coefficient of forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase was progressively shifted to a higher value indicating that the heavy isotope-labeled enzyme replaced the pre-existing light form of the molecule. These observations show that the rapid decrease in adenylate cyclase activity and the synthesis of heavy adenylate cyclase molecules are two separate events. The relative amounts of heavy and light components of forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase obtained in sucrose gradient differential sedimentation were determined as a function of time beginning 24 h after the transfer into the heavy medium. The decrease of the pre-existing light form could be represented by simple first order kinetics with a half-time of 40 h. This result suggests that the metabolic renewal of forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase is comparable to that of most plasma membrane proteins."
