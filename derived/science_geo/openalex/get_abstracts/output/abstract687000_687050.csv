https://openalex.org/W4225691034,"The SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in southern Africa has been characterized by three distinct waves. The first was associated with a mix of SARS-CoV-2 lineages, while the second and third waves were driven by the Beta (B.1.351) and Delta (B.1.617.2) variants, respectively1-3. In November 2021, genomic surveillance teams in South Africa and Botswana detected a new SARS-CoV-2 variant associated with a rapid resurgence of infections in Gauteng province, South Africa. Within three days of the first genome being uploaded, it was designated a variant of concern (Omicron, B.1.1.529) by the World Health Organization and, within three weeks, had been identified in 87 countries. The Omicron variant is exceptional for carrying over 30 mutations in the spike glycoprotein, which are predicted to influence antibody neutralization and spike function4. Here we describe the genomic profile and early transmission dynamics of Omicron, highlighting the rapid spread in regions with high levels of population immunity."
https://openalex.org/W4207048578,"The emergence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant of concern (VOC) has destabilized global efforts to control the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Recent data have suggested that B.1.1.529 can readily infect people with naturally acquired or vaccine-induced immunity, facilitated in some cases by viral escape from antibodies that neutralize ancestral SARS-CoV-2. However, severe disease appears to be relatively uncommon in such individuals, highlighting a potential role for other components of the adaptive immune system. We report here that SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells induced by prior infection or BNT162b2 vaccination provide extensive immune coverage against B.1.1.529. The median relative frequencies of SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific CD4+ T cells that cross-recognized B.1.1.529 in previously infected or BNT162b2-vaccinated individuals were 84% and 91%, respectively, and the corresponding median relative frequencies for SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific CD8+ T cells were 70% and 92%, respectively. Pairwise comparisons across groups further revealed that SARS-CoV-2 spike-reactive CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were functionally and phenotypically similar in response to the ancestral strain or B.1.1.529. Collectively, our data indicate that established SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses, especially after BNT162b2 vaccination, remain largely intact against B.1.1.529."

https://openalex.org/W4205638247,"In the tumor microenvironment, Cancer Associated Fibroblasts (CAFs) become activated by cancer cells and increase their secretory activity to produce soluble factors that contribute to tumor cells proliferation, invasion and dissemination to distant organs. The pro-tumorigenic transcription factor STAT3 and its canonical inducer, the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6, act conjunctly in a positive feedback loop that maintains high levels of IL-6 secretion and STAT3 activation in both tumor and stromal cells. Here, we demonstrate that STAT3 is essential for the pro-tumorigenic functions of murine breast cancer CAFs both in vitro and in vivo, and identify a STAT3 signature significantly enriched for genes encoding for secreted proteins. Among these, ANGPTL4, MMP13 and STC-1 were functionally validated as STAT3-dependent mediators of CAF pro-tumorigenic functions by different approaches. Both in vitro and in vivo CAFs activities were moreover impaired by MMP13 inhibition, supporting the feasibility of a therapeutic approach based on inhibiting STAT3-induced CAF-secreted proteins. The clinical potential of such an approach is supported by the observation that an equivalent CAF-STAT3 signature in humans is expressed at high levels in breast cancer stromal cells and characterizes patients with a shorter disease specific survival, including those with basal-like disease."
https://openalex.org/W4206353619,"Breast cancer (BC) is one of the most common malignant tumors found in females. Previous studies have demonstrated that curcumin, which is a type of polyphenol compound extracted from Curcuma longa underground rhizome, is able to inhibit the survival of cancer cells. However, the functional role and mechanism of curcumin in BC are still unclear. The Cell Counting Kit-8 assay was performed to examine the effects of curcumin on cell viability in the BC cell lines MDA-MB-453 and MCF-7. The levels of lipid reactive oxygen species (ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA) production, and intracellular Fe2+ were determined to assess the effects of curcumin on cell ferroptosis. Western blot analysis was also carried out to detect the protein levels. Finally, the antitumorigenic effect of curcumin on BC was identified in a xenograft tumor model. In the present study, the results indicated that curcumin could dose-dependently suppress the viability of both MDA-MB-453 and MCF-7 cells. Further studies revealed that curcumin facilitated solute carrier family 1 member 5 (SLC1A5)-mediated ferroptosis in both MDA-MB-453 and MCF-7 cells by enhancing lipid ROS levels, lipid peroxidation end-product MDA accumulation, and intracellular Fe2+ levels. In vivo experiments demonstrated that curcumin could significantly hamper tumor growth. Collectively, the results demonstrated that curcumin exhibited antitumorigenic activity in BC by promoting SLC1A5-mediated ferroptosis, which suggests its use as a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of BC."
https://openalex.org/W4206451029,"The hippocampus plays a critical role in memory consolidation, mediated by coordinated network activity during sharp-wave ripple (SWR) events. Despite the link between SWRs and hippocampal plasticity, little is known about how network state affects information processing in dendrites, the primary sites of synaptic input integration and plasticity. Here, we monitored somatic and basal dendritic activity in CA1 pyramidal cells in behaving mice using longitudinal two-photon calcium imaging integrated with simultaneous local field potential recordings. We found immobility was associated with an increase in dendritic activity concentrated during SWRs. Coincident dendritic and somatic activity during SWRs predicted increased coupling during subsequent exploration of a novel environment. In contrast, somatic-dendritic coupling and SWR recruitment varied with cells' tuning distance to reward location during a goal-learning task. Our results connect SWRs with the stabilization of information processing within CA1 neurons and suggest that these mechanisms may be dynamically biased by behavioral demands."

This study aims to determine the lifestyle behaviours and their associations with body weight changes among Malaysian adults during the Movement Control Order (MCO) due to COVID-19 pandemic.A total of 1319 Malaysian adults participated in this cross-sectional online survey. Information on anthropometric data including body weight and height, and lifestyle behaviours including eating pattern, physical activity, and sleep pattern were self-reported by the respondents. A multivariable generalised linear mixed model was used to assess the associations between lifestyle behaviours and body weight changes with adjustment of confounding factors; namely, age, sex, ethnicity, and body weight status before MCO.During MCO, 41.2% of the respondents perceived that their eating patterns were healthier, but 36.3% reduced their physical activities, and 25.7% had a poorer sleep quality. Further, the proportion of adults who reported having lose weight (32.2%) was almost similar to those who reported having gained weight (30.7%). Lifestyle behaviours including less frequent practice of healthy cooking methods and lunch skipping were associated with weight gain, while less frequent consumption of high fat foods, more frequent physical activity, and good sleep latency were associated with lower risk of weight gain. In contrast, practicing healthy eating concept, skipped lunch, and more frequent physical activity were significantly associated with weight loss.Lifestyle behaviours were associated with body weight changes during MCO. While the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown is necessary to prevent further spread of the disease, promoting healthy lifestyle practices during lockdown should be implemented for a healthy weight and better health."
https://openalex.org/W4206932600,"Analysis of population genetic data often includes a search for genomic regions with signs of recent positive selection. One of such approaches involves the concept of extended haplotype homozygosity (EHH) and its associated statistics. These statistics typically require phased haplotypes, and some of them necessitate polarized variants. Here, we unify and extend previously proposed modifications to loosen these requirements. We compare the modified versions with the original ones by measuring the false discovery rate in simulated whole-genome scans and by quantifying the overlap of inferred candidate regions in empirical data. We find that phasing information is indispensable for accurate estimation of within-population statistics (for all but very large samples) and of cross-population statistics for small samples. Ancestry information, in contrast, is of lesser importance for both types of statistic. Our publicly available R package rehh incorporates the modified statistics presented here."
https://openalex.org/W4225668599,"Disease, storms, ocean warming, and pollution have caused the mass mortality of reef-building corals across the Caribbean over the last four decades. Subsequently, stony corals have been replaced by macroalgae, bacterial mats, and invertebrates including soft corals and sponges, causing changes to the functioning of Caribbean reef ecosystems. Here we describe changes in the absolute cover of benthic reef taxa, including corals, gorgonians, sponges, and algae, at 15 fore-reef sites (12-15m depth) across the Belizean Barrier Reef (BBR) from 1997 to 2016. We also tested whether Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), in which fishing was prohibited but likely still occurred, mitigated these changes. Additionally, we determined whether ocean-temperature anomalies (measured via satellite) or local human impacts (estimated using the Human Influence Index, HII) were related to changes in benthic community structure. We observed a reduction in the cover of reef-building corals, including the long-lived, massive corals Orbicella spp. (from 13 to 2%), and an increase in fleshy and corticated macroalgae across most sites. These and other changes to the benthic communities were unaffected by local protection. The covers of hard-coral taxa, including Acropora spp., Montastraea cavernosa, Orbicella spp., and Porites spp., were negatively related to the frequency of ocean-temperature anomalies. Only gorgonian cover was related, negatively, to our metric of the magnitude of local impacts (HII). Our results suggest that benthic communities along the BBR have experienced disturbances that are beyond the capacity of the current management structure to mitigate. We recommend that managers devote greater resources and capacity to enforcing and expanding existing marine protected areas and to mitigating local stressors, and most importantly, that government, industry, and the public act immediately to reduce global carbon emissions."
https://openalex.org/W4206625358,"Objectives Platelet activation underpins thrombus formation in ischemic stroke. The active, dimeric form of platelet receptor glycoprotein (GP) VI plays key roles by binding platelet ligands collagen and fibrin, leading to platelet activation. We investigated whether patients presenting with stroke expressed more GPVI on their platelet surface and had more active circulating platelets as measured by platelet P-selectin exposure. Methods 129 ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke patients were recruited within 8h of symptom onset. Whole blood was analyzed for platelet-surface expression of total GPVI, GPVI-dimer, and P-selectin by flow cytometry at admission and day-90 post-stroke. Results were compared against a healthy control population (n = 301). Results The platelets of stroke patients expressed significantly higher total GPVI and GPVI-dimer ( P &lt;0.0001) as well as demonstrating higher resting P-selectin exposure ( P &lt;0.0001), a measure of platelet activity, compared to the control group, suggesting increased circulating platelet activation. GPVI-dimer expression was strongly correlated circulating platelet activation [r 2 = 0.88, P &lt;0.0001] in stroke patients. Furthermore, higher platelet surface GPVI expression was associated with increased stroke severity at admission. At day-90 post-stroke, GPVI-dimer expression and was further raised compared to the level at admission ( P &lt;0.0001) despite anti-thrombotic therapy. All ischemic stroke subtypes and hemorrhagic strokes expressed significantly higher GPVI-dimer compared to controls ( P &lt;0.0001). Conclusions Stroke patients express more GPVI-dimer on their platelet surface at presentation, lasting at least until day-90 post-stroke. Small molecule GPVI-dimer inhibitors are currently in development and the results of this study validate that GPVI-dimer as an anti-thrombotic target in ischemic stroke."
https://openalex.org/W4206233316,"Previous models that assess quality-of-Life (QoL) in patients with rheumatic diseases have a strong biomedical focus. We evaluated the impact of COVID-19 related-health care interruption (HCI) on the physical, psychological, social relationships and environment QoL-dimensions, and explored factors associated with QoL when patients were reincorporated to the outpatient clinic, and after six-month follow-up.Study phase-1 consisted of a COVID-19 survey administered from June 24th-October 31st 2020, to outpatients with rheumatic diseases who had face-to-face consultation at outpatient clinic reopening. Study phase-2 consisted of 3 consecutive assessments of patient´s QoL (WHOQOL-BREF), disease activity/severity (RAPID-3), and psychological comorbidity/trauma (DASS-21 and IES-R) to patients from phase-1 randomly selected. Sociodemographic, disease and treatment-related information, and comorbidities were obtained. Multiple linear regression analysis identified factors associated with the score assigned to each WHOQOL-BREF dimension.Patients included (670 for phase-1 and 276 for phase-2), had primarily SLE and RA (44.2% and 34.1%, respectively), and all the dimensions of their WHOQOL-BREF were affected. There were 145 patients (52.5%) who referred HCI, and they had significantly lower dimensions scores (but the environment dimension score). Psycho-emotional factors (primarily feeling confused, depression and anxiety), sociodemographic factors (age, COVID-19 negative economic impact, years of scholarship, HCI and having a job), and biomedical factors (RAPID-3 score and corticosteroid use) were associated with baseline QoL dimensions scores. Psycho-emotional factors showed the strongest magnitude on dimensions scores. Most consistent predictor of six-month follow-up QoL dimensions scores was each corresponding baseline dimension score, while social determinants (years of scholarship and having a job), emotional factors (feeling bored), and biomedical aspects (RAPID 3) had an additional impact.HCI impacted the majority of patient´s QoL dimensions. Psycho-emotional, sociodemographic and biomedical factors were consistently associated with QoL dimensions scores, and these consistently predicted the QoL trajectory."
https://openalex.org/W4206469034,"Locally advanced rectal cancer is typically treated with chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery. Most patients do not display a complete response to chemoradiotherapy, but resistance mechanisms are poorly understood. ST6GAL-1 is a sialyltransferase that adds the negatively charged sugar, sialic acid (Sia), to cell surface proteins in the Golgi, altering their function. We therefore hypothesized that ST6GAL-1 could mediate resistance to chemoradiation in rectal cancer by inhibiting apoptosis. Patient-derived xenograft and organoid models of rectal cancer and rectal cancer cell lines were assessed for ST6GAL-1 protein with and without chemoradiation treatment. ST6GAL-1 mRNA was assessed in untreated human rectal adenocarcinoma by PCR assays. Samples were further assessed by Western blotting, Caspase-Glo apoptosis assays, and colony formation assays. The presence of functional ST6GAL-1 was assessed via flow cytometry using the Sambucus nigra lectin, which specifically binds cell surface α2,6-linked Sia, and via lectin precipitation. In patient-derived xenograft models of rectal cancer, we found that ST6GAL-1 protein was increased after chemoradiation in a subset of samples. Rectal cancer cell lines demonstrated increased ST6GAL-1 protein and cell surface Sia after chemoradiation. ST6GAL-1 was also increased in rectal cancer organoids after treatment. ST6GAL-1 knockdown in rectal cancer cell lines resulted in increased apoptosis and decreased survival after treatment. We concluded that ST6GAL-1 promotes resistance to chemoradiotherapy by inhibiting apoptosis in rectal cancer cell lines. More research will be needed to further elucidate the importance and mechanism of ST6GAL-1-mediated resistance."
https://openalex.org/W4205358861,"The study aimed to investigate changes in the role of speech-language pathologists (SLPs) during the COVID-19 pandemic in Saudi Arabia. It also assessed the SLPs' perceptions of delivering services using telehealth as a part of their everyday clinical practice before and during the COVID-19 pandemic.SLPs in Saudi Arabia were invited to complete a web-based survey covering questions related to changes to the role of SLPs during the COVID-19 pandemic, changes in the ways speech services are delivered; and the benefits and barriers of using telehealth in clinical practice as identified by SLPs.Ninety-one SLPs completed the survey. About 94% of the respondents experienced changes in their role as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The nature of changes they had experienced including decreased work time, providing support and counseling to patients or caregivers using the telephone, providing assessment and therapy using telehealth, and working with a limited number of cases. Ninety-three percent of the respondents who have used telehealth started to use it only during the pandemic. Mostly seen caseloads were pediatric speech and language disorders. Further, 96% of respondents used telehealth for counseling, 69% for rehabilitation or treatment, 63% for screening, 56% for evaluation or assessment, 48% for a referral to other professional services, and 46% for differential diagnosis. About 70% of the SLPs showed interest to continue using telehealth in the future. Several benefits were identified to using telehealth, including accessibility, cost efficiency, and the ability to engage patients with their families in therapy sessions. On the other hand, barriers to using telehealth included internet and technical issues, lack of direct communication, and difficulty controlling the therapy setting.The study has shown that SLPs in Saudi Arabia have experienced changes during the COVID-19 outbreak. The survey responses also indicate that the SLPs are adopting telehealth applications at an accelerated pace as a result of the pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W4205855138,"Lycium barbarum, a traditional Chinese medicine, has been shown to have antioxidant properties and has a protective effect in many diseases related to oxidative stress, such as neurodegenerative diseases, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer. Although the neuroprotective effects of L. barbarum extract (LBE) have been reported in several studies, the underlying molecular mechanisms are still unclear. In this study, the transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans strain CL2006 was used to investigate the function and molecular mechanism of an LBE in Alzheimer's disease (AD). LBE had high antioxidant potential and effectively delayed Aβ-induced paralysis in the CL2006 strain. LBE inhibited the production of excessive reactive oxygen species by inducing the SKN-1-mediated antioxidant system, thereby inhibiting the generation of Aβ and inhibiting mitochondrial damage. Importantly, LBE reduced Aβ levels by inducing FSHR-1-mediated activation of the mtUPR. Therefore, our study not only reveals a new mechanism of LBE in the treatment of AD but also identifies a novel strategy for the treatment of AD by enhancing the mtUPR."

https://openalex.org/W4225831305,"Tests for SARS-CoV-2 immunity are needed to help assess responses to vaccination, which can be heterogeneous and may wane over time. The plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) is considered the gold standard for measuring serum neutralizing antibodies but requires high level biosafety, live viral cultures and days to complete. We hypothesized that competitive enzyme linked immunoassays (ELISAs) based on SARS-CoV-2 spike protein's receptor binding domain (RBD) attachment to its host receptor, the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 receptor (ACE2r), would correlate with PRNT, given the central role of RBD-ACE2r interactions in infection and published studies to date, and enable evaluation of vaccine responses.Configuration and development of a competitive ELISA with plate-bound RBD and soluble biotinylated ACE2r was accomplished using pairs of pre/post vaccine serum. When the competitive ELISA was used to evaluate N = 32 samples from COVID-19 patients previously tested by PRNT, excellent correlation in IC50 results were observed (rs = .83, p < 0.0001). When the competitive ELISA was used to evaluate N = 42 vaccinated individuals and an additional N = 13 unvaccinated recovered COVID-19 patients, significant differences in RBD-ACE2r inhibitory activity were associated with prior history of COVID-19 and type of vaccine received. In longitudinal analyses pre and up to 200 days post vaccine, surrogate neutralizing activity increased markedly after primary and booster vaccine doses, but fell substantially, up to <12% maximal levels within 6 months.A competitive ELISA based on inhibition of RBD-ACE2r attachment correlates well with PRNT, quantifies significantly higher activity among vaccine recipients with prior COVID (vs. those without), and highlights marked declines in surrogate neutralizing activity over a 6 month period post vaccination. The findings raise concern about the duration of vaccine responses and potential need for booster shots."
https://openalex.org/W4205957863,"Cocoa is a plant with origins in northwestern South America with high relevance in the global economy. Evidence indicates that cocoa is sensitive to a dry climate, under which crop production is reduced. Projections for future climate change scenarios suggest a warmer and drier climate in the Amazon basin. In this paper, we quantify the potential effects in cocoa production due to its edaphoclimatic suitability changes to the Brazilian Amazon biome and account for regional differences in planning occupation territories. We modeled the suitability of cocoa's geographical distribution using an ensemble of 10 correlative models that were run in the ""biomod2"" library and projected to two future climate scenarios (RCPs 4.5 and 8.5) by 2050. Combining information on climate and soil suitability and installed infrastructure in the macro-regions of the Brazilian Amazon. We defined a zoning system to indicate how cocoa production may respond to climate change according to the current and future suitability model. Our results suggest that a reduction in precipitation and an increase in temperature may promote a reduction in the suitability of cocoa production in the Brazilian Amazon biome. In addition of the areas suitable for cocoa plantation, we found a 37.05% and 73.15% decrease in the areas suitable for intensification and expansion zones under RCP 4.5 and 8.5, respectively, compared with the current scenario. We conclude that there may be a need to expand land to cocoa production in the future, or else it will be necessary to plant a cocoa variety resistant to new climatic conditions. Besides, we recommend procedures to combat illegal deforestation to prevent the most critical climate change scenarios from occurring."
https://openalex.org/W4206252535,"Human T-cell Leukemia Virus type-1 (HTLV-1) is an oncovirus that may cause two main life-threatening diseases including a cancer type named Adult T-cell Leukemia/Lymphoma (ATLL) and a neurological and immune disturbance known as HTLV-1 Associated Myelopathy/Tropical Spastic Paraparesis (HAM/TSP). However, a large number of the infected subjects remain as asymptomatic carriers (ACs). There is no comprehensive study that determines which dysregulated genes differentiate the pathogenesis routes toward ATLL or HAM/TSP. Therefore, two main algorithms including weighted gene co-expression analysis (WGCNA) and multi-class support vector machines (SVM) were utilized to find major gene players in each condition. WGCNA was used to find the highly co-regulated genes and multi-class SVM was employed to identify the most important classifier genes. The identified modules from WGCNA were validated in the external datasets. Furthermore, to find specific modules for ATLL and HAM/TSP, the non-preserved modules in another condition were found. In the next step, a model was constructed by multi-class SVM. The results revealed 467, 3249, and 716 classifiers for ACs, ATLL, and HAM/TSP, respectively. Eventually, the common genes between the WGCNA results and classifier genes resulted from multi-class SVM that also determined as differentially expressed genes, were identified. Through these step-wise analyses, PAIP1, BCAS2, COPS2, CTNNB1, FASLG, GTPBP1, HNRNPA1, RBBP6, TOP1, SLC9A1, JMY, PABPC3, and PBX1 were found as the possible critical genes involved in the progression of ATLL. Moreover, FBXO9, ZNF526, ERCC8, WDR5, and XRCC3 were identified as the conceivable major involved genes in the development of HAM/TSP. These genes can be proposed as specific biomarker candidates and therapeutic targets for each disease."
https://openalex.org/W4206318103,"Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling is crucial for a large variety of cellular processes, not only related to angiogenesis but also in nonvascular cell types. We have previously shown that controlling angiogenesis by reducing VEGF-A signaling positively affects tendon healing. We now hypothesize that VEGF signaling in non-endothelial cells may contribute to tendon pathologies. By immunohistochemistry we show that VEGFR1, VEGFR2, and VEGFR3 are expressed in murine and human tendon cells in vivo. In a rat Achilles tendon defect model we show that VEGFR1, VEGFR3, and VEGF-D expression are increased after injury. On cultured rat tendon cells we show that VEGF-D stimulates cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner; the specific VEGFR3 inhibitor SAR131675 reduces cell proliferation and cell migration. Furthermore, activation of VEGFR2 and -3 in tendon-derived cells affects the expression of mRNAs encoding extracellular matrix and matrix remodeling proteins. Using explant model systems, we provide evidence, that VEGFR3 inhibition prevents biomechanical deterioration in rat tail tendon fascicles cultured without load and attenuates matrix damage if exposed to dynamic overload in a bioreactor system. Together, these results suggest a strong role of tendon cell VEGF signaling in mediation of degenerative processes. These findings give novel insight into tendon cell biology and may pave the way for novel treatment options for degenerative tendon diseases."
https://openalex.org/W4207075716,"Type 2 diabetes is a metabolic disorder associated with abnormal glucose homeostasis and is characterized by intrinsic defects in β-cell function and mass. Trimethylguanosine synthase 1 (TGS1) is an evolutionarily conserved enzyme that methylates small nuclear and nucleolar RNAs and that is involved in pre-mRNA splicing, transcription, and ribosome production. However, the role of TGS1 in β-cells and glucose homeostasis had not been explored. Here, we show that TGS1 is upregulated by insulin and upregulated in islets of Langerhans from mice exposed to a high-fat diet and in human β-cells from type 2 diabetes donors. Using mice with conditional (βTGS1KO) and inducible (MIP-CreERT-TGS1KO) TGS1 deletion, we determined that TGS1 regulates β-cell mass and function. Using unbiased approaches, we identified a link between TGS1 and endoplasmic reticulum stress and cell cycle arrest, as well as and how TGS1 regulates β-cell apoptosis. We also found that deletion of TGS1 results in an increase in the unfolded protein response by increasing XBP-1, ATF-4, and the phosphorylation of eIF2α, in addition to promoting several changes in cell cycle inhibitors and activators such as p27 and Cyclin D2. This study establishes TGS1 as a key player regulating β-cell mass and function. We propose that these observations can be used as a stepping-stone for the design of novel strategies focused on TGS1 as a therapeutic target for the treatment of diabetes."

Compared to physicians and nurses, they are underpaid and potentially undervalued, yet play a critical role in health systems. This study examined the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic from the perspective of Black and Latinx health care workers in support roles (referred to here as HCWs). From December 2020 to February 2021, we conducted 2 group interviews (n = 9, 1 group in English and 1 group in Spanish language) and 8 individual interviews (1 in Spanish and 7 in English) with HCWs. Participants were members of a high-risk workforce as well as of communities that suffered disproportionately during the pandemic. Overall, they described disruptive changes in responsibilities and roles at work. These disruptions were intensified by the constant fear of contracting COVID-19 themselves and infecting their family members. HCWs with direct patient care responsibilities reported reduced opportunities for personal connection with patients. Perspectives on vaccines reportedly changed over time, and were influenced by peers' vaccination and information from trusted sources. The pandemic has exposed the stress endured by an essential workforce that plays a critical role in healthcare. As such, healthcare systems need to dedicate resources to improve the work conditions for this marginalized workforce including offering resources that support resilience. Overall working conditions and, wages must be largely improved to ensure their wellbeing and retain them in their roles to manage the next public health emergency. The role of HCWs serving as ambassadors to provide accurate information on COVID-19 and vaccination among their coworkers and communities also warrants further study."
https://openalex.org/W4205529402,"This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the value of thyroid imaging report and data system (TI-RADS) combined with superb micro-vascular imagine technique(SMI) in distinguishing benign and malignant thyroid nodules. We searched PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Chinese biomedical databases from inception through February 31, 2021. Meta-analysis was conducted using STATA version 14.0 and Meta-Disc version 1.4 softwares. We calculated the summary statistics for sensitivity(Sen), specificity(Spe), and receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curve. Six studies that met all inclusion criteria were included in this meta-analysis. A total of 408 thyroid malignant nodules and 496 thyroid benign nodules were assessed. All thyroid nodules were histologically confirmed after SMI. The pooled Sen and Spe of TI-RADS were 0.80(95%CI = 0.71-0.87) and 0.82(95%CI = 0.75-0.87); The pooled Sen and Spe of TI-RADS combined with SMI were 0.88 (95%CI = 0.80-0.91) and 0.89 (95%CI = 0.85-0.92). The areas under the SROC curve of TI-RADS and TI-RADS combined with SMI were 0.8874(SE = 0.0165) and 0.9415(SE = 0.0102), between which there was significant difference(Z = 2.789; SE = 0.0194; p = 0.0053). Our meta-analysis indicates that TI-RADS combined with SMI may have high diagnostic accuracy, and is more effective than single TI-RADS in distinguishing benign and malignant thyroid nodules."

The number of visits, physical examination procedures, guidelines and request for laboratory tests were investigated. There was a positive evolution for tests-HIV, syphilis, blood glucose and ultrasound, and for all tests, guidance on feeding and weight gain of the baby and examination of the oral cavity. The indicators that performed the worst were: performance of tetanus vaccine, six or more visits, receiving guidance on exclusive breastfeeding and care for the newborn, and the procedures-all, measurement of uterine height, gynecological exam and cervix cancer prevention. These changes had a varied behavior between the regions of the country."
https://openalex.org/W4206525659,"The rapid evolution of HIV is constrained by interactions between mutations which affect viral fitness. In this work, we explore the role of epistasis in determining the mutational fitness landscape of HIV for multiple drug target proteins, including Protease, Reverse Transcriptase, and Integrase. Epistatic interactions between residues modulate the mutation patterns involved in drug resistance, with unambiguous signatures of epistasis best seen in the comparison of the Potts model predicted and experimental HIV sequence ""prevalences"" expressed as higher-order marginals (beyond triplets) of the sequence probability distribution. In contrast, experimental measures of fitness such as viral replicative capacities generally probe fitness effects of point mutations in a single background, providing weak evidence for epistasis in viral systems. The detectable effects of epistasis are obscured by higher evolutionary conservation at sites. While double mutant cycles in principle, provide one of the best ways to probe epistatic interactions experimentally without reference to a particular background, we show that the analysis is complicated by the small dynamic range of measurements. Overall, we show that global pairwise interaction Potts models are necessary for predicting the mutational landscape of viral proteins."
https://openalex.org/W4206759372,"Reconfigurable antennas have received much attention in RF energy harvesting models owing to their selectivity for operating frequency and polarization. The characteristic of having frequency selectivity and polarization selectivity can be termed as frequency diversity and polarization diversity, respectively. This paper investigates a rectenna device with a new proposed topology in order to eliminate coupling between input and output lines and increase the rectification efficiency with the use of single feed hybrid reconfigurable antenna, switch between 28GHz and 38GHz frequency. Moreover, it is designed to charge a rechargeable battery of 1watt(W). The Reconfiguration mechanism is realized by electronically controlling different states of Switches. PIN Diode (as RLC Equivalent circuit) is used as a switch for ON/OFF states. This antenna mainly comprises rectangular shaped patches (28GHz and 38GHz) with Triango-Truncated edge at the corners. Eighteen PIN Diodes are placed symmetrically throughout the antenna presenting as, S1 & S2 for frequency reconfiguration, S3 to S6 & S7 to S10 connects Triango Truncated edge at the corners for polarization reconfiguration, and for radiation pattern reconfiguration at S11 to S14 & S15 to S18 has been used. The proposed antenna model is capable of simultaneously changing, the radiation patterns as clock and anti-clockwise directions at ±90-degree shift in E and H planes, circularly polarized (CP) states among, Linear Polarization (LP), Right Hand Circularly Polarization (RHCP), and Left Hand Circularly Polarization (LHCP). The current design describes using single antenna for energy harvesting and 5G mobile communication application. This would lead to higher output currents, leading to the ability to efficiently charge a wide variety of batteries. A fully functional prototype has been designed, fabricated and its compound reconfiguration characteristics have been validated for simulated and measured results. For validation of results, the experimental results and the simulation results from the proposed mathematical model were made into comparison, and excellent correlation between the measured and simulated results was obtained."
https://openalex.org/W4206981803,"The global health emergency posed by the outbreak of Zika virus (ZIKV), an arthropod-borne flavivirus causing severe neonatal neurological conditions, has subsided, but there continues to be transmission of ZIKV in endemic regions. As such, there is still a medical need for discovering and developing therapeutical interventions against ZIKV. To identify small-molecule compounds that inhibit ZIKV disease and transmission, we screened multiple small-molecule collections, mostly derived from natural products, for their ability to inhibit wild-type ZIKV. As a primary high-throughput screen, we used a viral cytopathic effect (CPE) inhibition assay conducted in Vero cells that was optimized and miniaturized to a 1536-well format. Suitably active compounds identified from the primary screen were tested in a panel of orthogonal assays using recombinant Zika viruses, including a ZIKV Renilla luciferase reporter assay and a ZIKV mCherry reporter system. Compounds that were active in the wild-type ZIKV inhibition and ZIKV reporter assays were further evaluated for their inhibitory effects against other flaviviruses. Lastly, we demonstrated that wild-type ZIKV is able to infect a 3D-bioprinted outer-blood-retina barrier tissue model and disrupt its barrier function, as measured by electrical resistance. One of the identified compounds (3-Acetyl-13-deoxyphomenone, NCGC00380955) was able to prevent the pathological effects of the viral infection on this clinically relevant ZIKV infection model."
https://openalex.org/W4206679309,"Renal clinical chemistry only detects kidney dysfunction after considerable damage has occurred and is imperfect in predicting long term outcomes. Consequently, more sensitive markers of early damage and better predictors of progression are being urgently sought, to better support clinical decisions and support shorter clinical trials. Transglutaminase 2 (TG2) is strongly implicated in the fibrotic remodeling that drives chronic kidney disease (CKD). We hypothesized that urinary TG2 and its ε-(γ-glutamyl)-lysine crosslink product could be useful biomarkers of kidney fibrosis and progression. Animal models: a rat 4-month 5/6th subtotal nephrectomy model of CKD and a rat 8-month streptozotocin model of diabetic kidney disease had 24-hour collection of urine, made using a metabolic cage, at regular periods throughout disease development. Patients: Urine samples from patients with CKD (n = 290) and healthy volunteers (n = 33) were collected prospectively, and progression tracked for 3 years. An estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) loss of 2-5 mL/min/year was considered progressive, with rapid progression defined as > 5 mL/min/year. Assays: TG2 was measured in human and rat urine samples by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and ε-(γ-glutamyl)-lysine by exhaustive proteolytic digestion and amino acid analysis. Urinary TG2 and ε-(γ-glutamyl)-lysine increased with the development of fibrosis in both animal model systems. Urinary TG2 was 41-fold higher in patients with CKD than HVs, with levels elevated 17-fold by CKD stage 2. The urinary TG2:creatinine ratio (UTCR) was 9 ng/mmol in HV compared with 114 ng/mmol in non-progressive CKD, 1244 ng/mmol in progressive CKD and 1898 ng/mmol in rapidly progressive CKD. Both urinary TG2 and ε-(γ-glutamyl)-lysine were significantly associated with speed of progression in univariate logistic regression models. In a multivariate model adjusted for urinary TG2, ε-(γ-glutamyl)-lysine, age, sex, urinary albumin:creatinine ratio (UACR), urinary protein:creatinine ratio (UPCR), and CKD stage, only TG2 remained statistically significant. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis determined an 86.4% accuracy of prediction of progression for UTCR compared with 73.5% for UACR. Urinary TG2 and ε-(γ-glutamyl)-lysine are increased in CKD. In this pilot investigation, UTCR was a better predictor of progression in patients with CKD than UACR. Larger studies are now warranted to fully evaluate UTCR value in predicting patient outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W4205709633,"The purpose of this article is to illustrate the application of an evidence-based, structured performance measurement methodology to identify, prioritize, and (when appropriate) generate new measures of health care quality, using primary care as a case example. Primary health care is central to the health care system and health of the American public; thus, ensuring high quality is essential. Due to its complexity, ensuring high-quality primary care requires measurement frameworks that can assess the quality of the infrastructure, workforce configurations, and processes available. This paper describes the use of the Productivity Measurement and Enhancement System (ProMES) to compile a targeted set of such measures, prioritized according to their contribution and value to primary care.We adapted ProMES to select and rank existing primary care measures according to value to the primary care clinic. Nine subject matter experts (SMEs) consisting of clinicians, hospital leaders and national policymakers participated in facilitated expert elicitation sessions to identify objectives of performance, corresponding measures, and priority rankings.The SMEs identified three fundamental objectives: access, patient-health care team partnerships, and technical quality. The SMEs also selected sixteen performance indicators from the 44 pre-vetted, currently existing measures from three different data sources for primary care. One indicator, Team 2-Day Post Discharge Contact Ratio, was selected as an indicator of both team partnerships and technical quality. Indicators were prioritized according to value using the contingency functions developed by the SMEs.Our article provides an actionable guide to applying ProMES, which can be adapted to the needs of various industries, including measure selection and modification from existing data sources, and proposing new measures. Future work should address both logistical considerations (e.g., data capture, common data/programming language) and lingering measurement challenges, such as operationalizating measures to be meaningful and interpretable across health care settings."

This study aimed to evaluate the performance of a prediction model for Cis-AKI.Japanese patients, who received cisplatin as the first-line chemotherapy at Fujita Health University Hospital, were enrolled in the study. The main metrics for evaluating the machine learning model were the area under the curve (AUC), accuracy, precision, recall, and F-measure. In addition, the rank of contribution as a predictive factor of Cis-AKI was determined by machine learning.A total of 1,014 and 226 patients were assigned to the development and validation data groups, respectively. The current prediction model showed the highest performance in patients 65 years old and above (AUC: 0.78, accuracy: 0.77, precision: 0.38, recall: 0.70, F-measure: 0.49). The maximum daily cisplatin dose and serum albumin levels contributed the most to the prediction of Cis-AKI.Our prediction model for Cis-AKI performed effectively in older patients."
https://openalex.org/W4205964308,"Background There is a substantial gap in our knowledge about family correlates of child emotional and behavioral problems in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). The present study contributes to filling this gap by examining such correlates in a larger population study in Nepal. Methods Our study is a cross-sectional, observational study among 3840 Nepali children aged 6–18 years from 64 schools and 16 districts in the three main geographical regions in the country. We used the Nepali version of the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL)/6-18 to assess children’s internalizing and externalizing problems and an additional background information questionnaire to assess possible family correlates which included parental education, family structure, migrant worker parents, parental mental and physical illness, family conflicts, and child-rearing. The associations between family variables and child internalizing and externalizing problems were analyzed using bivariate correlations and multiple regression. Results Using bivariate analysis, we found that mental and physical illness in parents, conflict in the family, parental disagreement in child-rearing, and physical punishment of child correlated positively with both Internalizing Problems and Externalizing Problems. The same associations were found by using multiple regression analysis. In addition, parental education, family structure, and migrant worker mothers were associated with Externalizing Problems. However, the effect sizes were small. Conclusion The results suggest that in Nepal, child mental problems were associated with several family risk factors. Further, the study points to the need of strengthening prevention- and intervention measures to minimize family risk factors of child mental health disorders."

This study aimed to estimate the prevalence and identify the factors associated with suboptimal glycemic control among patients with type 2 DM during the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.A hospital-based cross-sectional study was used to elicit information from DM patients attending six hospitals located in Chiang Rai Province, northern Thailand, between February and May 2021. A validated questionnaire and 5 mL blood specimens were used as the research tools. Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) greater than 7.0% among DM patients at least two years after diagnosis was defined as suboptimal glycemic control. Chi-square tests and logistic regression were used to identify the associations between variables at the significance level α = 0.05.A total of 967 patients were recruited for this study; 54.8% 530 had suboptimal glycemic control, 58.8% were female, 66.5% were aged 50-69 years, and 78.5% were married (78.5%). Six variables were found to be associated with suboptimal glycemic control in multivariable logistic regression. Participants aged <49, 50-59, and 60-69 years had 3.32 times (95% CI = 1.99-5.53), 2.61 times (95% CI = 1.67-4.08), and 1.93 times (95% CI = 1.26-2.95) greater odds of having suboptimal glycemic control, respectively, than those aged ≥70 years. Married individuals had 1.64 times (95% CI = 1.11-2.41) greater odds of having suboptimal glycemic control than those ever married. Participants who consumed sticky rice had 1.61 times (95% CI = 1.19-2.61) greater odds of having suboptimal glycemic control than those who did not consume sticky rice in daily life. Participants who had been diagnosed with DM for 11-20 years and ≥21 years had 1.98 times (95% CI = 1.37-2.86) and 2.46 times (1.50-4.04) greater odds of having suboptimal glycemic control, respectively, than those who had been diagnosed ≤ 10 years. Participants who had experienced forgetting to take their medication had 2.10 times (95% CI = 1.43-3.09) greater odds of having suboptimal glycemic control than those who did not, and those who had their medical expenses covered by the national scheme had 2.67 times (95% CI = 1.00-7.08) greater odds of suboptimal glycemic control than those who self-paid.Effective health interventions to control blood glucose among DM patients during ongoing treatment are urgently required. The interventions should focus on patients aged less than 69 years, marital status, forgetting to take their medication, and a longer time since diagnosis, including reducing their sticky rice consumption. The effects of copayments should also be considered."
https://openalex.org/W4206061671,"A Social Story (SS) is a highly acceptable and widely used intervention by the autism community. Yet, inconsistent implementation of the intervention is reported to be one of the causes of variability in terms of outcome research, particularly in a naturalistic context. This study aimed to (1) investigate whether digitally-mediated social stories (SSs) can improve competence in developing and delivering a SS and thus contribute towards improved implementation, and (2) investigate the impact of the digitally-mediated SS on attitudes towards the SS intervention. Ninety-three participants took an initial pre-engagement survey. Forty-eight of these participants also complete a post-engagement survey. A pre-post design was utilised with the participants who completed both surveys. These 48 participants were invited to develop a digitally-mediated SS with the aim of exploring how digitally-mediated SSs impacted perceived competence and attitudes. Post-engagement data was collected two weeks after the pre-engagement data. Outcomes of this study indicate that both perceived competence and attitudes improved after engaging with digitally-mediated SSs. It is concluded that digitally-mediated SS not only impacted the integrity of how the intervention was delivered but also the beliefs in the participants' capabilities to develop and deliver a SS. Digitally-mediated SS, thus, has the potential to effectively support development and delivery whilst also addressing challenges related to intervention implementation in a naturalistic context."
https://openalex.org/W4206150656,"The NBA player Stephen Curry has a habit of turning away from the basket right after taking three-point shots even before the ball reaches the basket, suggesting that he can reliably predict whether the just released shot will hit or not. In order to use this ""knowledge"" to deliberately decide which action to take next, Stephen Curry needs conscious access to the results of internal processes of outcome prediction and valuation. In general, computational simulations and empirical data suggest that the quality of such internal predictions is related to motor skill level. Whether the results of internal predictions can reliably be consciously accessed, however, is less clear. In the current study, 30 participants each practiced a virtual goal-oriented throwing task for 1000 trials. Every second trial, they were required to verbally predict the success of the current throw. Results showed that on average, verbal prediction accuracy was above an individually computed chance level, taking into account individual success rates and response strategies. Furthermore, prediction accuracy was related to task skill level. Participants with better performances predicted the success of their throws more accurately than participants with poorer performances. For the poorer performing individuals, movement execution was negatively affected when the verbalized predictions were required. They also showed no noticeable modulation of speech characteristics (response latency) for correct and incorrect predictions as observed in the high performers."
https://openalex.org/W4206295921,"This study investigates ""hypothetical bias,"" defined as the difference in the willingness to pay for a product attribute between hypothetical and non-hypothetical conditions in a choice experiment, for the carbon footprint of mandarin oranges in Japan. We conducted the following four treatments: a non-hypothetical lab economic experiment, a hypothetical lab survey, a hypothetical online survey, and a hypothetical online survey with cheap-talk. Each treatment asked participants to choose one of three oranges based on price and carbon emissions level. Next, participants were asked to answer questions on demographics and the following three kinds of environmental factors: environmental consciousness, purchasing behavior for goods with eco-labels, and daily environmental behavior. Using the random parameter logit model, the willingness to pay per 1g of carbon emission reduction were 0.53 JPY, 0.52 JPY, 0.54 JPY, and 0.58 JPY in the non-hypothetical lab economic experiment, hypothetical lab survey, hypothetical online survey and hypothetical online survey with cheap-talk, respectively. The complete combinatorial test of the willingness to pay for carbon emission reductions indicates no hypothetical bias between any treatment combinations. Our findings reveal that environmental attributes for food are less likely to show hypothetical bias than other goods. The results of the main effect with an interaction term show that environmental consciousness reduces the coefficients of carbon emissions in all treatments. Therefore, a psychological scale is useful for showing whether hypothetical bias emerges with treatment or participants' personal backgrounds."
https://openalex.org/W4206794433,"In eukaryotic cells, uptake of cytosolic ATP into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen is critical for the proper functioning of chaperone proteins. The human transport protein SLC35B1 was recently postulated to mediate ATP/ADP exchange in the ER; however, the underlying molecular mechanisms mediating ATP uptake are not completely understood. Here, we extensively characterized the transport kinetics of human SLC35B1 expressed in yeast that was purified and reconstituted into liposomes. Using [α32P]ATP uptake assays, we tested the nucleotide concentration dependence of ATP/ADP exchange activity on both sides of the membrane. We found that the apparent affinities of SLC35B1 for ATP/ADP on the internal face were approximately 13 times higher than those on the external side. Because SLC35B1-containing liposomes were preferentially inside-out oriented, these results suggest a low-affinity external site and a high-affinity internal site in the ER. Three different experimental approaches indicated that ATP/ADP exchange by SLC35B1 was not strict, and that other di- and tri-nucleotides could act as suitable counter-substrates for ATP, although mononucleotides and nucleotide sugars were not transported. Finally, bioinformatic analysis and site-directed mutagenesis identified that conserved residues K117 and K120 from transmembrane helix 4 and K277 from transmembrane helix 9 play critical roles in transport. The fact that SLC35B1 can promote ATP transport in exchange for ADP or UDP suggest a more direct coupling between ATP import requirements and the need for eliminating ADP and UDP, which are generated as side products of reactions taking place in the ER-lumen."
https://openalex.org/W3115694600,"The growth and popularization of platforms on scientific production has been the subject of several studies, producing relevant analyses of co-authorship behavior among groups of researchers. Researchers and their scientific productions can be analysed as co-authorship social networks, so researchers are linked through common publications. In this context, co-authoring networks can be analysed to find patterns that can describe or characterize them. This work presents the analysis and characterization of co-authorship networks of academic Brazilian graduate programs in computer science. Data from Brazilian researchers were collected and modeled as co-authoring networks among the graduate programs that researchers take part in. Each network topology was analysed with complex network measurements and three proposed qualitative indices that evaluate the publication's quality. In addition, the co-authorship networks of the computer science graduate programs were characterized in relation to the assessment received by CAPES, which attributes a qualitative grade to the graduate programs in Brazil. The results show the most relevant topological measurements for the program's characterization and the evaluations received by the programs in different qualitative degrees, relating the main topological patterns of the co-authorship networks and the CAPES grades of the Brazilian graduate programs in computer science."

We also assessed the relationship between the rate of change in body composition after lenvatinib treatment and prognosis.Eighty-one patients with advanced HCC who were treated with lenvatinib were enrolled. We assessed prognosis, various clinical data, body composition parameters obtained by bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), and handgrip strength.Multivariate analysis showed that an extracellular water to total body water ratio (ECW/TBW) ≤ 0.400 at treatment initiation was associated with longer overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and post-progression survival (PPS) (OS: hazard ratio [H0R], 4.72; 95% CI, 12.03-11.00; P < 0.001; PFS: HR, 2.66; 95% CI, 1.33-5.34; P = 0.0057; PPS: HR, 3.08; 95% CI, 1.32-7.18; P = 0.0093). Multivariate analysis also showed that the skeletal muscle mass index (SMI) of the arm at treatment initiation was associated with a longer PFS (HR, 2.12; 95% CI, 1.23-3.64; P = 0.0069). In the group with an ECW/TBW ≤ 0.400 before lenvatinib treatment, univariate analysis showed that the rate of change in only the arm SMI was associated with a longer OS and PFS.Body composition assessment by BIA before and after lenvatinib treatment is useful in predicting prognosis in lenvatinib-treated patients with HCC."

https://openalex.org/W4225308526,"Multiple advances have been made to increase the efficiency of CRISPR/Cas9 editing using the model genetic organism Caenorhabditis elegans ( C . elegans ). Here we report on the use of co-CRISPR ‘marker’ genes: worms in which co-CRISPR events have occurred have overt, visible phenotypes which facilitates the selection of worms that harbour CRISPR events in the target gene. Mutation in the co-CRISPR gene is then removed by outcrossing to wild type but this can be challenging if the CRISPR and co-CRISPR gene are hard to segregate. However, segregating away the co-CRISPR modified gene can be less challenging if the worms selected appear wild type and are selected from a jackpot brood. These are broods in which a high proportion of the progeny of a single injected worm display the co-CRISPR phenotype suggesting high CRISPR efficiency. This can deliver worms that harbour the desired mutation in the target gene locus without the co-CRISPR mutation. We have successfully generated a discrete mutation in the C . elegans nlg-1 gene using this method. However, in the process of sequencing to authenticate editing in the nlg-1 gene we discovered genomic rearrangements that arise at the co-CRISPR gene unc-58 that by visual observation were phenotypically silent but nonetheless resulted in a significant reduction in motility scored by thrashing behaviour. This highlights that careful consideration of the hidden consequences of co-CRISPR mediated genetic changes should be taken before downstream analysis of gene function. Given this, we suggest sequencing of co-CRISPR genes following CRISPR procedures that utilise phenotypic selection as part of the pipeline."
https://openalex.org/W4205190837,"This study aimed to evaluate the effects of two types of provisional resin cements on the color and retentive strength of two different all-ceramic restorations cemented onto customized zirconia abutments. Forty-two crowns were made of monolithic zirconia and lithium disilicate ceramics (n = 21 per group) and cemented on customized zirconia abutments by using two provisional resin cements of TempBond Clear and Implantlink Semi, and TempBond serving as the control (n = 7 per cement subgroup). The specimens' color was measured before and after cementation and after thermocycling. The color difference was calculated by using CIEDE2000 formula (ΔE00). The tensile force was applied to assess the retentive strength. Kruskal-Wallis, Dunn's post-hoc, and Mann-Whitney non-parametric tests were used to compare ΔE00(1) and ΔE00(2) and two-way ANOVA followed by one-way ANOVA and Tukey's HSD post hoc test and T-test were used to compare retentive strength between subgroups. In the lithium disilicate group, ΔE00 of the control subgroup (TempBond) was significantly higher than that of Implantlink Semi cements subgroup (P = 0.001). But, in the monolithic zirconia group, ΔE00 of the control subgroup (TempBond) was significantly higher than that of Implantlink Semi (P = 0.020) and TempBond Clear cements (P = 0.007). In the monolithic zirconia group, the control subgroup (TempBond) was significantly more retentive than TempBond Clear (P = 0.003) and Implantlink Semi cement (P = 0.001). However, in the lithium disilicate group, Implantlink Semi cement was significantly more retentive than TempBond Clear (P = 0.019) and TempBond (control) (P = 0.001). The final color of both restorations was significantly affected by the provisional resin cement type. The retentive strength was influenced by both the type of cement and ceramic."
https://openalex.org/W4205240354,"Economic globalization has swept the whole world. To focus on their main business, enterprises that are referred to as original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) outsource non-core production activities to contract manufacturers (CMs). By constructing a two-level supply chain consisting of two competing OEMs and one upstream CM, the strategic interaction of the OEMs between outsourcing and purchasing is studied. Specifically, the CM can offer custom- and predefined modes of original equipment manufacturing (namely, CO mode and PO mode, respectively). The former mode enables OEMs to determine product quality, while the latter only allows them to purchase from several quality configurations. The results show that, first, since the CO mode allows the adopter to lead the product design, whether to choose this mode depends on the required R&amp;D cost. Interestingly, however, a lower R&amp;D cost does not necessarily result in the adoption of the CO mode if the product quality difference is small under the PO mode. Second, the optimal purchasing strategy of an OEM is indifferent to the outsourcing mode (CO and PO) of its rival but significantly affected by the quality cost. However, compared to the PO mode, choosing the CO mode would cause the competitor to suffer more profit losses. Third, differing from the prior literature, this paper finds that when the downstream OEM can make quality decisions, although this may lead to profit loss of the contract manufacturer in some channels, it could benefit the CM overall."

Although young adults demonstrate high PM abilities in laboratory settings, their abilities to complete intended actions in naturalistic settings are surprisingly low. The present study tested the effectiveness of various encoding techniques in improving young adults’ performance in everyday life. Ninety-two participants were asked to remember to take photographs of receipts for a duration of seven days. The task instructions were either given alone or followed by: (a) the if-then statement, (b) visualising the task, or (c) the combination of the if-then statement plus visualisation. The if-then statement alone significantly speeded up responses to the prospective memory targets, i.e., less time elapsed between getting a receipt and taking a photograph of it. With no effect of the if-then statement on the proportion of correct PM responses, the results may suggest that the if-then statement strengthened the PM cue-intention association but did not influence the PM cue saliency."

The set of variables combines hospitals' characteristics which may determine their level of costs, such as the form of ownership, bed turnover rate, number of patient-days and share of beds in emergency department with environment characteristics which may influence both outsourcing costs and patients' health. In 2017 the system of basic hospital service provision (hospital network) was introduced in Poland. Dummy variables included in the model represent the category of hospital in the system. The results show that the costs may be described using fixed effect panel model. Positive impact of percentage of emergency department patients transferred to other departments and of wages is found. Higher ratio of residents and interns to doctors is found to decrease costs. Dummy variable for the period after the introduction of hospital network assumed a negative sign with costs, but the parameter remained insignificant."
https://openalex.org/W4205276978,"Prorenin is viewed as an ideal target molecule in the prevention of diabetic retinopathy. However, no drugs are available for inhibiting activation of prorenin. Here, we tested the effect of a prorenin peptide vaccine (VP) in the retina of a murine model of type 2 diabetes (T2D). To choose the optimal vaccine, we selected three different epitopes of the prorenin prosegment (E1, E2, and E3) and conjugated them to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH). We injected C57BL/6J mice twice with KLH only (as a control vaccine), E1 conjugated with KLH (E1-KLH), E2-KLH, or E3-KLH and compared antibody titers. E2-KLH showed the highest antibody titer and specific immunoreactivity of anti-sera against prorenin, so we used E2-KLH as VP. Then, we administered injections to the non-diabetic db/m and diabetic db/db mice, as follows: db/m + KLH, db/db + KLH, and db/db + VP. Retinal blood flow measurement with laser speckle flowgraphy showed that the impaired retinal circulation response to both flicker light and systemic hyperoxia in db/db mice improved with VP. Furthermore, the prolonged implicit time of b-wave and oscillatory potentials in electroretinography was prevented, and immunohistochemical analysis showed reduced microglial activation, gliosis, and vascular leakage. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot assay confirmed vaccinated mice had no auto-immune response against prorenin itself. The present data suggest that vaccination against prorenin is an effective and safe measure against the early pathological changes of diabetic retinopathy in T2D."

Total exposure, T3 (T0+180 mins) ranged from 250 minutes to 370 minutes. All samples (FF and OCT) were stored at -80°C before RNA isolation. The RNA quality assessment based on RNA Integrity Number (RIN) showed RINs for both FF and OCT samples were within the generally acceptable range (mean 7.88±0.90 to 8.52±0.66). No significant difference was observed when RIN at T0 was compared to RIN at T1, T2 and T3 (FF samples, p = 0.43, 0.56, 0.44; OCT samples, p = 0.25, 0.82, 1.0), or when RIN was compared between T1, T2 and T3. RNA quality assessed by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis of beta-actin (ACTB), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), cyclophilin A (CYPA), and porphobilinogen deaminase (PBGD) transcripts showed threshold values (Ct) that indicate abundant and intact target nucleic acid in all samples (mean ranging from 14.1 to 25.3). The study shows that higher RIN values were obtained for non-diseased breast tissue up to 190 minutes after resection and prior to stabilization. Further experimental exposure up to 180 minutes had no significant effect on RIN values. This study strengthens the rationale for assessing RIN and specific gene transcript levels as an objective method for determining how suitable RNA will be for a specific research purpose (""fit-for purpose"")."
https://openalex.org/W4206328486,"In order to investigate the compaction and re-crushing characteristics of crushed coal gangue with different gradation, the compaction fractal test was carried out for crushed coal gangue with different Talbol power index n. The compaction deformation parameters such as displacement, stress-strain were analyzed according to the test results. And according to the test results, the compaction deformation relationship of the lateral limit crushed coal rock body considering the gradation is obtained. The test results show that: the crushing of coal rock particles exists in almost the whole compaction process of the crushed coal rock body, and the crushing of coal rock particles has a non-negligible influence on the deformation of the whole crushed rock body; the structural stability of large-size coal rock particles is not as good as that of small-size coal rock particles, and the large-size coal rock is more likely to be crushed under the same stress conditions; the distribution coefficient r of the crushed coal rock body decreases with the increase of axial stress; and before the Before the axial stress reaches 8 MPa, the distribution coefficient r of crushed rock samples tends to increase with n in general, and after reaching 8 MPa and later, the distribution coefficient r of crushed rock samples tends to decrease with n in general; the difference value of particle crushing increases with the increase of axial stress, and the weight value of particle crushing decreases with the increase of axial stress, and the changes of both are non-linear; according to the stress recovery in the compaction process of crushed coal rock body The compaction deformation model of the crushed coal rock body is constructed according to the crushing characteristics of coal rock particles in the stage of compaction, which effectively combines its fine action mechanism with macroscopic physical phenomena in a simple form and has certain practical engineering significance."
https://openalex.org/W4206826085,"Taxes are increasingly used as a policy tool aimed at reducing consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs), given their association with adverse health outcomes including type 2 diabetes, obesity and cardiovascular disease. However, a potential unintended consequence of such a policy could be that the tax induces substitution to alcoholic beverages. The purpose of this study is to examine the impact of the $0.0175 per ounce Seattle, Washington, Sweetened Beverage Tax (SBT) on volume sold of alcoholic beverages.A difference-in-differences estimation approach was used drawing on universal product code-level food store scanner data on beer (N = 1059) and wine (N = 2655) products one-year pre-tax (February-November, 2017) and one and two-years post-tax (February-November, 2018 and 2019) with Portland, Oregon, as the comparison site.At two-years post-tax implementation, volume sold of beer in Seattle relative to Portland increased by 7% (ratio of incidence rate ratios [RIRR] = 1.07, 95% CI:1.00,1.15), whereas volume sold of wine decreased by 3% (RIRR = 0.97, 95% CI:0.95,1.00). Overall alcohol (both beer and wine) volume sold increased in Seattle compared to Portland by 4% (RIRR = 1.04, 95% CI:1.01,1.07) at one-year post-tax and by 5% (RIRR = 1.05, 95% CI:1.00,1.10) at two-years post-tax. The implied SSB cross-price elasticities of demand for beer and wine, respectively, were calculated to be 0.35 and -0.15.There was evidence of substitution to beer following the implementation of the Seattle SSB tax. Continued monitoring of potential unintended outcomes related to the implementation of SSB taxes is needed in future tax evaluations."
https://openalex.org/W4225464502,"Sialyltransferase, an enzyme responsible for attaching sialic acid to the cell surface, is reported to play a key role in cancer, making sialyltransferase a potential therapeutic target in drug development. Several methods have been developed to quantify sialic acids in biological samples however limitations exists and quantification in complex cell matrices lack investigation. Hence, this paper outlines a simple method to detect and quantify sialic acids in cancer cells for evaluating sialyltransferase activity of potential therapeutic compounds. An efficient method was developed using a reverse-phase ion-pairing HPLC-UV using triisopropanolamine as the ion-pairing agent with a C18 column. Neu5Ac was successfully eluted with the retention time 6.344 min with a flow rate of 0.4 mL/min. The proposed method was validated appropriately according to the AOAC guidelines (2013). This work demonstrates that the proposed method is not only relatively simple but also cost and time effective compared to pre-existing methods to successfully determine both free and protein-bound Neu5Ac in a complex cancer cell matrix. Furthermore, by applying the proposed method, a statistically significant decrease was observed for both HeLa and HuCCT1 cell lines with the application of deoxycholic acid–a known sialyltransferase inhibitor. Hence, the proposed method seems promisingly applicable to evaluate the effectiveness of potential sialyltransferase inhibitors."
