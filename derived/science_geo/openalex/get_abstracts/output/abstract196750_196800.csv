However, studies with a multi-enzyme system (isolated from digitonin extracts of mitochondria5) capable of performing oxidative phosphorylation have indicated6 that thyroxine and its analogues have no direct effect on this process. Concurrently7, it has been observed that these compounds alter the morphology of rat liver mitochondria in vitro. In concentrations as low as 10−6 M, both thyroxine and triiodothyronine produce a prompt and marked swelling of the mitochondria. In contrast, 2,4-dinitrophenol, in concentrations which completely ‘uncouple’ oxidative phosphorylation, provides protection against swelling. It has therefore been postulated6 that the uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation produced by thyroxine in intact mitochondria is secondary to an alteration in the morphology of the mitochondria and not the result of a direct interaction of the hormone with the enzymes of oxidative phosphorylation."

https://openalex.org/W1981720876,"THE reduction of hydroxypyruvate to glycerate is brought about by crystalline L-lactic dehydrogenase of muscle1 with the production of L-glyceric acid2. A substrate-specific D-glycerate dehydrogenase, which may or may not be accompanied by lactic dehydrogenase, occurs in extracts of higher plants2. Hydroxypyruvic acid phosphate is not able to replace pyruvic acid as a substrate for lactic dehydrogenase3. These enzymes require diphosphopyridine nucleotide, and their equilibrium, being far towards the reduced metabolite, is unfavourable for the study of the oxidative production of hydroxypyruvate. The importance of this substance as a substrate for transketolase4 and transaminase5 led us to study the action on glyceric acid of preparations containing lactic dehydrogenase from yeast, which is not so inhibited by pyruvate and requires no coenzyme6–8."

Thus Kon and Mawson1 reported that the concentration of riboflavin in human milk is very low, and found that the method of Emmerie2, in which riboflavin is extracted by methanol was inapplicable to it. Davis et al. 3 found the methanol method unsuitable for sow's milk, and at the same time suggested that riboflavin might be present in sow's milk in a form different from that occurring in cow's milk. In view of the foregoing observations, the partition of riboflavin between free riboflavin, flavin mononucleotide and flavin adenine dinucleotide in the milk of several species has been studied."

Multiple injuries were made. The eyes were then left to heal in the animal for varying periods after injury and, after removal, fixation and staining with haematoxylin, cross-sections were made and examined in series."
