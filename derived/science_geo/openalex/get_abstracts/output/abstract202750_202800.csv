https://openalex.org/W1968692605,"An inherited factor causes a predominance of males in certain strains and in progeny of single pairs of Aedes aegypti L. This factor appears to be transmitted only by males and is not due to differential mortality, at least in postgametic stages. Mass release of male-producing males might be used in control operations."

https://openalex.org/W2075294586,"Transmission of nerve impulses in superior cervical sympathetic ganglia of cats and rabbits is markedly enhanced after reserpine-induced depletion of ganglionic norepinephrine. Transmission is also enhanced by administration of adrenergic blocking agents. In contrast, reserpine-induced release of ganglionic norepinephrine in animals pretreated with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor results in a pronounced depression of ganglionic transmission, which lasts until the ganglionic norepinephrine disappears. These results support the concept that norepinephrine in ganglia modulates the action of acetylcholine."

https://openalex.org/W1976092147,"A mathematical theory is developed to explain the observed enhancement of oxygen transport through solutions by hemoglobin. At high partial pressures of oxygen, ordinary diffusion through the solvent accounts for all transport of oxygen, but at low partial pressures the transport may be increased many fold by the presence of hemoglobin. This phenomenon is explained and the possible role of this phenomenon in living organisms is discussed. The theory also indicates a new method of determining dissociation curves from diffusion experiments."

Since this publication, considerably more data have been collected on the grey seal colony on the Fame Islands, Northumberland, by members of the Natural History Society of Northumberland, Durham and Newcastle upon Tyne. Of 1,433 calves which were tagged, sexed and aged between 1952 and 1959 inclusive, 731 were males and the remaining 702 females ; a result which does not differ significantly from a 1 : 1 sex-ratio and which confirms Hewer's findings."

https://openalex.org/W2035851723,"The causes and effects of high concentrations of shorterlived fission products in fall-out in New York City during 1958 and 1959 are discussed. Data previously reported are supplemented with data on concentrations of Sr/sup 90/, Cs/sup 137/, Ru/sup 106/, Ce/sup 144/, Sr/sup 89/, Zr/sup 95/, and W/sup 18/ s/ sup 5/ measured in monthly fallout collections during 1959. Examination shows that the shorter-lived fission products predominated over Sr/sup 90/ and Cs/sup 137/ from the beginning of 1958 through the middle of 1959. Through analysis of isotope ratios, W/sup 185/ concentrations, and monthly rainfall volumes, it was established that more fallout arrived in New York City from the Soviet series in October 1958 than from earlier series, and that the Soviet debris was richer in short-lived nuclides because it was deposited sooner after its production. Methods, age and origin of debris, air activity concentrations, and gamma dose are all discussed. The calculated contributions of the fall-out that accumulated on the ground in New York City during 1958 and 1959 to external gamma radiation dose rates and to long term doses are both illustrated and tabulated.

https://openalex.org/W2037129927,"Jones and de Wardener1 have reported that normal subjects, when hydropenic, excrete a urine osmotically more concentrated than when given large quantities of vasopressin while hydrated. During dehydration, one element coming normally into play, besides antidiuretic hormone, is a hypersecretion of aldosterone by the adrenal cortex, as a response to the shrinkage of the liquid compartments of the body2,3. The possible influence of aldosterone on the concentrating capacities of the human kidney was therefore evaluated by comparing the urinary osmotic pressure after administration to hydrated subjects of vasopressin alone and of vasopressin associated with aldosterone."

https://openalex.org/W2026902252,"Chlorobium thiosulphatophilum was grown under conditions similar to those described by Larsen1. ‘Chlorobium chlorophyll’ (bacterioviridin) was extracted from the cells with 80 per cent methanol, transferred to ether, washed with water and dried over anhydrous sodium sulphate. The volume of the solution was reduced by evaporation under nitrogen, and the bulk of the chlorophyll precipitated by the addition of petroleum ether (b.p. 60–90). The chlorophyll was collected on talcum and washed with petroleum ether (b.p. 30–60) until the washings were colourless. The chlorophyll was removed from the talcum with acetone, transferred to ether, and washed with water. After drying, the solution was concentrated under vacuum, an equal volume of petroleum ether (b.p. 60–90) containing 4 per cent tetrahydrofuran added, and the solution adsorbed on to a sucrose column. The tetrahydrofuran was employed as a means of preventing precipitation of the chlorophyll in the column2. The column was developed by stepwise elution with isopropyl alcohol (0.75–2.0 per cent) in petroleum ether (b.p. 60–90 °) containing 2 per cent tetrahydrofuran. The chlorophyll zone was cut out, dissolved in ether, and chromatographed as before. The absorption spectrum of the chlorophyll in ether was obtained on a Cary recording spectrophotometer. Peaks at 650, 575, 530, 425, and 406 mµ, indicated that this chlorophyll was the ‘650’ type described by Stanier and Smith3, and that the organism studied was similar to or identical with Chlorobium thiosulphatophilum, strain L."

https://openalex.org/W4255816255,"As protein chemistry becomes more complex and large units become molecularly subdivided, new terms are required for adequate description. Prefixes such as α-, β-, pseudo- are well known. In collagen research, terms have been invented to cover new concepts, such as Orekhovich's procollagen1, Banga and Balo's metacollagen2 and the tropocollagen units of Schmidt, Gross and Highberger3."

https://openalex.org/W2028732364,"WHEN a relaxant is used in conjunction with a general anæsthetic, a new problem arises in assessment of the depth of anæsthesia: the reflexes which normally indicate returning consciousness and awareness of pain cannot appear if the patient is under the influence of a relaxant. Thus, if only reflexes involving voluntary muscle are used, it is possible, in the presence of a relaxant, for anæsthesia to lighten so that surgery is performed on a conscious paralysed patient without surgeon or anæsthetist being aware of the situation. This has been recorded more than once in human medicine, the patient having described the situation after the operation1. The same situation can occur in operations on animals when an anæsthetic is used in conjunction with a relaxant; but in this case the patient cannot afterwards direct attention to the mistake. Such circumstances produce problems with humanitarian and legal aspects for the veterinarian, as Finn2 has pointed out; they also complicate the interpretation of the pain clause for research workers holding a vivisection licence."
https://openalex.org/W2064651159,"WE have examined recently blood containing fibrinolysins in high titre. The blood was taken from a man who was later diagnosed as suffering from prostatic malignancy. The presence of high-titre fibrinolysins, raised formal acid phosphatase, and greatly reduced fibrinogen content, were all carried out by routine, accepted biochemical methods, and were fully diagnostic. It was then considered that there could be present a circulating auto-immunological factor which we might be able to demonstrate."
