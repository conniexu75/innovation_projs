https://openalex.org/W2063920469,"The lysosomal–autophagic pathway is activated by starvation and plays an important role in both cellular clearance and lipid catabolism. However, the transcriptional regulation of this pathway in response to metabolic cues is uncharacterized. Here we show that the transcription factor EB (TFEB), a master regulator of lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy, is induced by starvation through an autoregulatory feedback loop and exerts a global transcriptional control on lipid catabolism via Ppargc1α and Ppar1α. Thus, during starvation a transcriptional mechanism links the autophagic pathway to cellular energy metabolism. The conservation of this mechanism in Caenorhabditis elegans suggests a fundamental role for TFEB in the evolution of the adaptive response to food deprivation. Viral delivery of TFEB to the liver prevented weight gain and metabolic syndrome in both diet-induced and genetic mouse models of obesity, suggesting a new therapeutic strategy for disorders of lipid metabolism. Ballabio and colleagues report that the transcription factor TFEB, which has a known role in autophagy, is induced by starvation and promotes transcription of PGC1α and PPARα. Intriguingly, targeted expression of TFEB in the liver blocks the development of metabolic syndrome in mouse models of obesity."
https://openalex.org/W2006273251,"Receptor interacting protein 3 (RIP3) is a protein kinase essential for TNF-induced necroptosis. Phosphorylation on Ser-227 in human RIP3 (hRIP3) is required for its interaction with human mixed lineage kinase domain-like (MLKL) in the necrosome, a signaling complex induced by TNF stimulation. RIP1 and RIP3 mediate necrosome aggregation leading to the formation of amyloid-like signaling complexes. We found that TNF induces Thr-231 and Ser-232 phosphorylation in mouse RIP3 (mRIP3) and this phosphorylation is required for mRIP3 to interact with mMLKL. Ser-232 in mRIP3 corresponds to Ser-227 in hRIP3, whereas Thr-231 is not conserved in hRIP3. Although the RIP3-MLKL interaction is required for necroptosis in both human and mouse cells, hRIP3 does not interact with mMLKL and mRIP3 cannot bind to hMLKL. The species specificity of the RIP3-MLKL interaction is primarily determined by the sequence differences in the phosphorylation sites and the flanking sequence around the phosphorylation sites in hRIP3 and mRIP3. It appears that the RIP3-MLKL interaction has been selected as an evolutionarily conserved mechanism in mediating necroptosis signaling despite that differing structural and mechanistic bases for this interaction emerged simultaneously in different organisms. In addition, we further revealed that the interaction of RIP3 with MLKL prevented massive abnormal RIP3 aggregation, and therefore should be crucial for formation of the amyloid signaling complex of necrosomes. We also found that the interaction between RIP3 and MLKL is required for the translocation of necrosomes to mitochondria-associated membranes. Our data demonstrate the importance of the RIP3-MLKL interaction in the formation of functional necrosomes and suggest that translocation of necrosomes to mitochondria-associated membranes is essential for necroptosis signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2143810570,"Organisms are constantly challenged by stresses and privations and require adaptive responses for their survival. The forkhead box O (FOXO) transcription factor DAF-16 (hereafter referred to as DAF-16/FOXO) is a central nexus in these responses, but despite its importance little is known about how it regulates its target genes. Proteomic identification of DAF-16/FOXO-binding partners in Caenorhabditis elegans and their subsequent functional evaluation by RNA interference revealed several candidate DAF-16/FOXO cofactors, most notably the chromatin remodeller SWI/SNF. DAF-16/FOXO and SWI/SNF form a complex and globally co-localize at DAF-16/FOXO target promoters. We show that specifically for gene activation, DAF-16/FOXO depends on SWI/SNF, facilitating SWI/SNF recruitment to target promoters, to activate transcription by presumed remodelling of local chromatin. For the animal, this translates into an essential role for SWI/SNF in DAF-16/FOXO-mediated processes, in particular dauer formation, stress resistance and the promotion of longevity. Thus, we give insight into the mechanisms of DAF-16/FOXO-mediated transcriptional regulation and establish a critical link between ATP-dependent chromatin remodelling and lifespan regulation. FOXO transcription factors confer stress resistance and longevity in several organisms. Ruvkun and colleagues demonstrate in Caenorhabditis elegans that DAF-16 (FOXO homologue) recruits the chromatin remodeller SWI/SNF to target genes. They show that SWI/SNF is required for DAF-16-mediated functions such as dauer formation, stress resistance and increasing longevity."

Isoprene has significant effects on atmospheric chemistry, whereas other isoprenoids have diverse roles ranging from various biological processes to applications in commercial uses. Understanding the metabolic regulation of the MEP pathway is important considering the numerous applications of this pathway. The 1-deoxy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase (DXS) enzyme was cloned from Populus trichocarpa, and the recombinant protein (PtDXS) was purified from Escherichia coli. The steady-state kinetic parameters were measured by a coupled enzyme assay. An LC-MS/MS-based assay involving the direct quantification of the end product of the enzymatic reaction, 1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate (DXP), was developed. The effect of different metabolites of the MEP pathway on PtDXS activity was tested. PtDXS was inhibited by IDP and DMADP. Both of these metabolites compete with thiamine pyrophosphate for binding with the enzyme. An atomic structural model of PtDXS in complex with thiamine pyrophosphate and Mg2+ was built by homology modeling and refined by molecular dynamics simulations. The refined structure was used to model the binding of IDP and DMADP and indicated that IDP and DMADP might bind with the enzyme in a manner very similar to the binding of thiamine pyrophosphate. The feedback inhibition of PtDXS by IDP and DMADP constitutes an important mechanism of metabolic regulation of the MEP pathway and indicates that thiamine pyrophosphate-dependent enzymes may often be affected by IDP and DMADP.Background: The methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway is required for the biosynthesis of plastid-derived isoprenoids from plants.Results: Deoxyxylulose-5-phosphate synthase (DXS) was cloned from Populus trichocarpa, and metabolic regulation was tested.Conclusion: Both isopentenyl diphosphate and dimethylallyl diphosphate inhibit DXS by competing with thiamine pyrophosphate.Significance: Prediction of isoprene emission from trees and bioengineering of MEP pathway will be aided by these results.

https://openalex.org/W1985975570,"Although it is well recognized that haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) develop from a specialized population of endothelial cells known as haemogenic endothelium, the regulatory pathways that control this transition are not well defined. Here we identify Sox17 as a key regulator of haemogenic endothelial development. Analysis of Sox17-GFP reporter mice revealed that Sox17 is expressed in haemogenic endothelium and emerging HSCs and that it is required for HSC development. Using the mouse embryonic stem cell differentiation model, we show that Sox17 is also expressed in haemogenic endothelium generated in vitro and that it plays a pivotal role in the development and/or expansion of haemogenic endothelium through the Notch signalling pathway. Taken together, these findings position Sox17 as a key regulator of haemogenic endothelial and haematopoietic development."
https://openalex.org/W2141097048,"The plasma membranes of mammalian cells are widely expected to contain domains that are enriched with cholesterol and sphingolipids. In this work, we have used high-resolution secondary ion mass spectrometry to directly map the distributions of isotope-labeled cholesterol and sphingolipids in the plasma membranes of intact fibroblast cells. Although acute cholesterol depletion reduced sphingolipid domain abundance, cholesterol was evenly distributed throughout the plasma membrane and was not enriched within the sphingolipid domains. Thus, we rule out favorable cholesterol-sphingolipid interactions as dictating plasma membrane organization in fibroblast cells. Because the sphingolipid domains are disrupted by drugs that depolymerize the cells actin cytoskeleton, cholesterol must instead affect the sphingolipid organization via an indirect mechanism that involves the cytoskeleton."
https://openalex.org/W2158534684,"Fragments of proteins containing an expanded polyglutamine (polyQ) tract are thought to initiate aggregation and toxicity in at least nine neurodegenerative diseases, including Huntington's disease. Because proteasomes appear unable to digest the polyQ tract, which can initiate intracellular protein aggregation, preventing polyQ peptide aggregation by chaperones should greatly improve polyQ clearance and prevent aggregate formation. Here we expressed polyQ peptides in cells and show that their intracellular aggregation is prevented by DNAJB6 and DNAJB8, members of the DNAJ (Hsp40) chaperone family. In contrast, HSPA/Hsp70 and DNAJB1, also members of the DNAJ chaperone family, did not prevent peptide-initiated aggregation. Intriguingly, DNAJB6 and DNAJB8 also affected the soluble levels of polyQ peptides, indicating that DNAJB6 and DNAJB8 inhibit polyQ peptide aggregation directly. Together with recent data showing that purified DNAJB6 can suppress fibrillation of polyQ peptides far more efficiently than polyQ expanded protein fragments in vitro, we conclude that the mechanism of DNAJB6 and DNAJB8 is suppression of polyQ protein aggregation by directly binding the polyQ tract."
https://openalex.org/W1970523098,"The intermediate conductance calcium-activated potassium channel KCa3.1 contributes to a variety of cell activation processes in pathologies such as inflammation, carcinogenesis, and vascular remodeling. We examined the electrophysiological and transcriptional mechanisms by which KCa3.1 regulates vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation. Platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF)-induced proliferation of human coronary artery VSMCs was attenuated by lowering intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)]i) and was enhanced by elevating [Ca(2+)]i. KCa3.1 blockade or knockdown inhibited proliferation by suppressing the rise in [Ca(2+)]i and attenuating the expression of phosphorylated cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB), c-Fos, and neuron-derived orphan receptor-1 (NOR-1). This antiproliferative effect was abolished by elevating [Ca(2+)]i. KCa3.1 overexpression induced VSMC proliferation, and potentiated PDGF-induced proliferation, by inducing CREB phosphorylation, c-Fos, and NOR-1. Pharmacological stimulation of KCa3.1 unexpectedly suppressed proliferation by abolishing the expression and activity of KCa3.1 and PDGF β-receptors and inhibiting the rise in [Ca(2+)]i. The stimulation also attenuated the levels of phosphorylated CREB, c-Fos, and cyclin expression. After KCa3.1 blockade, the characteristic round shape of VSMCs expressing high l-caldesmon and low calponin-1 (dedifferentiation state) was maintained, whereas KCa3.1 stimulation induced a spindle-shaped cellular appearance, with low l-caldesmon and high calponin-1. In conclusion, KCa3.1 plays an important role in VSMC proliferation via controlling Ca(2+)-dependent signaling pathways, and its modulation may therefore constitute a new therapeutic target for cell proliferative diseases such as atherosclerosis."

The role of Dectin-1, a β-1,3-glucan receptor, critical for fungal recognition and triggering of Th17 responses, to phagosomal maturation has not been defined. We show that GFP-Dectin-1 translocates to the fungal phagosome, but its signal decays after 2 h. Inhibition of acidification results in retention of GFP-Dectin-1 to phagosome membranes highlighting the requirement for an acidic pH. Following β-1,3-glucan recognition, GFP-Dectin-1 undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation by Src kinases with subsequent Syk activation. Our results demonstrate that Syk is activated independently of intraphagosomal pH. Inhibition of Src or Syk results in prolonged retention of GFP-Dectin-1 to the phagosome signifying a link between Syk and intraphagosomal pH. β-1,3-glucan phagosomes expressing a signaling incompetent Dectin-1 failed to mature as demonstrated by prolonged Dectin-1 retention, presence of Rab5B, failure to acquire LAMP-1 and inability to acidify. Phagosomes containing Candida albicans also require Dectin-1-dependent Syk activation for phagosomal maturation. Taken together, these results support a model where Dectin-1 not only controls internalization of β-1,3-glucan containing cargo and triggers proinflammatory cytokines, but also acts as a master regulator for subsequent phagolysosomal maturation through Syk activation.Background: Dectin-1 is able to recognize and phagocytose the fungal carbohydrate, β-1,3-glucan, but its contribution to phagosomal maturation has not been explored.Results: Dectin-1-dependent Syk activation promotes phagolysosomal fusion and acidification.Conclusion: Dectin-1-dependent Syk-activation permits egress of early phagosomes to mature phagolysosomes.Significance: The surface recognition receptor, Dectin-1 shapes anti-fungal responses by controlling fungal phagosome maturation.

Dectin-1 also triggers phagocytosis, and in innate immune cells places cargo in membrane-delineated compartments termed phagosomes.

To date, it is not known whether Dectin-1 plays a role in β-1,3-glucan or fungal phagosome maturation. In this study, we explore the contribution of Dectin-1 and subsequent Syk signaling to phagosomal maturation. To reduce the complexity of fungal cell wall ligands, we used a fungal-like platform that displays monodispersed, purified β-1,3-glucan on a polystyrene platform (β-1,3-glucan beads) (27Tam J.M. Mansour M.K. Khan N.S. Yoder N.C. Vyas J.M. Use of fungal derived polysaccharide-conjugated particles to probe Dectin-1 responses in innate immunity.Integr. Biol. 2012; 4: 220-227Crossref Google Scholar). Our results show that Dectin-1 translocates to β-1,3-glucan-containing phagosomes and is retained to the phagosomal membrane in a pH-dependent process. Through the use of chemical inhibitors or a signaling incompetent mutant of Dectin-1 incapable of activating Syk, we demonstrate that Dectin-1-dependent Syk activation is critical for acidification of β-1,3-glucan-containing phagosomes. Furthermore, we show that Dectin-1-dependent Syk signaling is required not only for phagosomal pH control but also for egress of phagosomes from an early phagosomal stage into mature phagolysosomes. These data indicate that in addition to triggering phagocytosis and the elaboration of pro-inflammatory cytokines, Dectin-1 controls the transition of nascent phagosomes to mature phagolysosomes through a Syk-dependent mechanism.

RAW cells grown in 6-well plates were stimulated with ligand, washed (PBS), and lysed in 0.5 ml 1% nonidet P40 (American Bioanalytical, Natick, MA) containing protease inhibitors (Roche, Indianapolis, IN) for 1 h nutating at 4 °C. Following microcentrifugation, samples were prepared for SDS-PAGE. For anti-phospho-SYK Western blots, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) was added to cell lysis solution for phosphatase inhibition. Using wild-type Dectin-1 gene as a template, a tyrosine to phenylalanine substitution at amino acid position 15 within the intracytoplasmic domain (GFP-Dectin-1ΔY15) in pMAX vector with GFP fused at the N terminus (gift from Dr. David Underhill). The intracytoplasmic substitution was performed using QuikChangeXL site-directed mutagenesis (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) with the following primers: 5′-GAG AAT CTG GAT GAA GAT GGA TTT ACT CAA TTA GAC TTC AGC AC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GTG CTG AAG TCT AAT TGA GTA AAT CCA TCT TCA TCC AGA TTC TC-3′ (reverse). The final construct was confirmed by sequencing. HEK293T cells were used to generate lentivirus as described (28Artavanis-Tsakonas K. Love J.C. Ploegh H.L. Vyas J.M.

GFP-Dectin-1 or GFP-Dectin-1ΔY15 was subcloned into pHAGE II, a fourth-generation lentiviral self-inactivating nonreplicative vector (28Artavanis-Tsakonas K. Love J.C. Ploegh H.L. Vyas J.M.

Transduced cells were selected using 5 μg/ml puromycin. Expression of both receptor fusions, GFP-Dectin-1 and GFP-Dectin-1ΔY15, were comparable as measured by flow cytometry (data not shown). β-1,3-Glucan beads were produced as described (27Tam J.M. Mansour M.K. Khan N.S. Yoder N.C. Vyas J.M. Use of fungal derived polysaccharide-conjugated particles to probe Dectin-1 responses in innate immunity.Integr. Biol. 2012; 4: 220-227Crossref Google Scholar). Briefly, 3 μm amine-terminated polystyrene beads (Polysciences, Warrington, PA) were washed in DMSO (Sigma) using centrifugal 0.45 μm PTFE membrane filters (Ultrafree brand, Millipore, Billerica, MA). Amino groups were activated with 0.5 m 1,1′-carbonyldiimidazole (CDI, Sigma) at room temperature for 1 h. After rinsing, beads were resuspended in 10 mm β-1,3-glucan (Wellmune, Biothera, Eagan, MN) dissolved in DMSO for 1 h. Beads were stored at 4 °C in PBS. All batches were tested for conjugation β-1,3-glucan as described (27Tam J.M. Mansour M.K. Khan N.S. Yoder N.C. Vyas J.M. Use of fungal derived polysaccharide-conjugated particles to probe Dectin-1 responses in innate immunity.Integr. Biol. 2012; 4: 220-227Crossref Google Scholar). 5 × 106 β-1,3-glucan beads were fluorescently labeled for imaging by mixing with 30 μg of N-hydroxysuccinimidyl AF dye (Invitrogen) in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. For the described experiments, AF647 (ex: 650/em: 655) was used. For phagoFACS of purified phagosomes, 1 × 105 phagosomes were immunostained for 30 min at room temperature using 0.1 μg anti-LAMP-1 antibody or isotype control and 0.4 μg adsorbed anti-rabbit IgG AF647 antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA). After washing, phagosomes were assessed using FACS Calibur (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). Flow analysis performed using FlowJo software (Tree Star Inc., Ashland, OR). Phagosome index was calculated by determining the percent positive phagosome compared with beads alone multiplied by the geometric mean fluorescence. For visualization of subcellular compartments, RAW cells were plated onto 8-chambered slides (LabTek, ThermoScientific, Rochester, NY). Cells were incubated with AF647-β-1,3-glucan beads for 30 min at 37 °C. For visualizing acidic compartments, cells were pre-loaded with lysotracker red (Invitrogen) at 100 nm for 20 min. After washing, cells were mounted on a Nikon Ti-E inverted microscope equipped with a CSU-X1 confocal spinning-disk head (Yokogawa, Sugar Land, TX). A Coherent, 4 Watt laser (Coherent, Santa Clara, CA) was used as an excitation light source to produce wavelengths of 488, 568, and 647 nm. To acquire high-quality fluorescence images, a high-magnification, high-numerical aperture objective was used (Nikon, 1003, 1.49 numerical aperture, oil immersion). A piezo stage (Prior Instruments, Rockland, MA) capable of X, Y, Z movement was used for z-stack acquisition. A halogen light source and an air condenser (0.52 numerical aperture) were used for bright field illumination. A polarizer (Nikon, MEN51941) and Wollaston prisms (Nikon, MBH76190) were used to acquire differential interference contrast (DIC) images. Emission light from the sample was collected after passage through the appropriate emission filters (Semrock, Rochester, NY). Images were acquired using an EM-CCD camera (Hamamatsu C9100-13, Bridgewater, NJ). Image acquisition was performed using MetaMorph software (Molecular Devices, Downingtown, PA). Images were then cropped using Adobe Photoshop CS5 (Adobe Systems, San Jose, CA). Phagosome isolation was adopted from previous protocols (30Stuart L.M. Boulais J. Charriere G.M. Hennessy E.J.

A systems biology analysis of the Drosophila phagosome.Nature. 2007; 445: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). RAW cells were incubated with 1–4 × 106 β-1,3-glucan beads for the indicated time, and 0.5 ml of hypotonic lysis buffer (2 mm MgCl2, 6 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm HEPES) with protease inhibitor mixture (Roche) added. Cells were mechanically sheared by aspirating and ejecting cells through a 1cc syringe with ½ inch 26G needle (Fisher, Agawam, MA) for 15 cycles. Hypotonic buffer was adjusted to isotonicity with 62% (w/v) sucrose solution to 40%. A discontinuous gradient was then constructed in ultracentrifugation tubes (Beckman Polyallomer, Brea, CA) overlayering 2 ml of 62%, 40% (sample), 30%, 25%, and 10%. Sucrose gradients centrifuged at 24,000 rpm (80,000 × g) for 1 h at 4 °C (Beckman, SW-28 rotor, L8-M ultracentrifuge, Brea, CA). Following centrifugation, phagosomes were isolated at the interface of the 25%/10% sucrose layers. Phagosomes were counted using a hemacytometer in preparation for phagoFACS, Western blot analysis or sorting (BD FACSAria, BD Biosciences). 0.5–1 × 106 phagosomes or cell lysate in 1X loading buffer/reducing agent (Invitrogen) were heated to 95 °C for 5 min and resolved using 12% SDS-PAGE. Following electrophoresis, gels were removed and methanol-activated PVDF membrane (PerkinElmer, Waltham MA) applied to the gel in transfer buffer (0.025 m Tris, 0.192 m glycine, 20% methanol). All buffer components from National Diagnostics (Atlanta, GA) or Sigma. The gel and PVDF membrane were sandwiched between transfer sponge/blotting paper and subjected to electrophoretic transfer at 100 volts for 1 h at 4 °C. For detection of specific proteins, PVDF-immobilized gel transfers were blocked with 5% milk in PBS-0.02% Tween-20 (PBS-T, Sigma). Blots were incubated with primary antibody in 1% milk in PBS-T for 1 h at room temperature unless noted otherwise. Following washes in PBS-T, rat anti-mouse HRP secondary (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA) was added at 1:20,000 in 1% milk in PBS-T for 1 h at room temperature. Following washes in PBS, the blot was visualized using Western Lighting Plus ECL chemiluminescent substrate (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA) on Kodak BioMax XAR Film (Sigma). Films were then scanned, cropped and contrast adjusted evenly to entire image using Adobe Photoshop CS5 (Adobe Systems, San Jose, CA). Student's t test with a value of p < 0.05 was used as a measure of statistical significance. Representative data are expressed as means + S.E. We first explored the kinetics of normal Dectin-1 translocation following capture and phagocytosis of β-1,3-glucan beads. RAW macrophage cells expressing GFP-Dectin-1 (RAW GFP-Dectin-1) cells show a loss of phagosomal-associated GFP-Dectin-1 within 90 min (Fig. 1, panel A). Occasionally, a phagocytic cup was visualized marking the onset of capture and initiation of phagocytosis (Fig. 1, panel A, asterisk). Since most macrophage phagosomes acidify within this time, we hypothesized that loss of Dectin-1 from the phagosome was related to intraphagosomal pH. To explore pH effects, RAW GFP-Dectin-1 were treated with the vacuolar-type H+-ATPase inhibitor, bafilomycin A1 (BafA1). BafA1 treatment had no effect on phagocytosis (data not shown). BafA1 treated RAW GFP-Dectin-1 had intense and prolonged retention of GFP-Dectin-1 to β-1,3-glucan-containing phagosomes (Fig. 1, panel A, arrowheads). To quantify GFP-Dectin-1 to the phagosomal membrane, RAW GFP-Dectin-1 cells were incubated with β-1,3-glucan beads followed by phagosome isolation. Cytospin and flow analysis of purified phagosomes revealed minimal debris to suggest isolation of highly purified phagosomes (data not shown). Phagosomes from BafA1 treated RAW GFP-Dectin-1 cells had intense retention of GFP-Dectin-1 for up to 3 h by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1, panel B). Similarly, surface GFP-Dectin-1 recruited to the phagosomal membrane assessed by flow cytometry (phagoFACS, Fig. 1, panel C) demonstrates acidification-dependent loss of GFP-Dectin-1 signal. The calculated phagosomal indices from compiled phagoFACS data revealed a significantly impaired decay rate of GFP-Dectin-1 from BafA1 treated RAW GFP-Dectin-1 cells (Fig. 1, panel D). Having confirmed a direct correlation between GFP-Dectin-1 phagosomal retention and pH, we next sought to understand the contribution of Dectin-1 signaling to intraphagosomal acidification. Since the dominant intracellular signaling pathway resulting from Dectin-1 ligation is through Src/Syk activation, we sought to determine the potential contribution of Syk to Dectin-1 phagosomal retention. RAW GFP-Dectin-1 cells were pre-treated with PP2 (Src inhibitor), or vehicle and exposed to β-1,3-glucan beads. Phagocytosis occurred with normal kinetics in both conditions when examined by light and confocal microscopy (data not shown). More intense GFP-Dectin-1 retention was visualized to the β-1,3-glucan-containing phagosomal surface in the PP2 treated cells as compared with vehicle (Fig. 2, panel A). To quantify GFP-Dectin-1 retention to the β-1,3-glucan-containing phagosomes, RAW GFP-Dectin-1 cells were pre-treated with PP2, piceatannol (Syk inhibitor), or vehicle. Purified β-1,3-glucan-containing phagosomes were isolated from treated cells and GFP-Dectin-1 assessed by phagoFACS (Fig. 2, panel B). As compared with vehicle, the phagosome index shows a significant increase in surface recruitment of GFP-Dectin-1 in the PP2 and piceatannol group (Fig. 2, panel C). These data suggest a direct role for Syk in the control of intraphagosomal pH and subsequent Dectin-1 retention. Given the potential for off-target effects of chemical kinase inhibitors, we sought to validate the effect of Syk activation to retention using a molecular approach. A tyrosine to phenylalanine substitution at amino acid position 15 within the intracellular domain of GFP-Dectin-1 (ΔY15) was introduced disrupting Dectin-1-dependent Syk activation (15Underhill D.M. Rossnagle E. Lowell C.A. Simmons R.M. Dectin-1 activates Syk tyrosine kinase in a dynamic subset of macrophages for reactive oxygen production.Blood. 2005; 106: 2543-2550Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). RAW GFP-Dectin-1ΔY15 cells were capable of capturing and completing phagocytosis of β-1,3-glucan beads and heat-killed C. albicans though the rate of phagocytosis was marginally slower as compared with wild-type RAW GFP-Dectin-1 (data not shown). Moreover, non-phagocytic HEK 293 cells transduced with GFP-Dectin-1ΔY15 became phagocytic for β-1,3-glucan beads (data not shown). Using purified phagosomes, the kinetics of GFP-Dectin-1ΔY15 at the phagosomal surface revealed retention of up to 19 h as compared with 2 h with wild-type GFP-Dectin-1 by Western (Fig. 3, panel A). Interestingly, Western analysis shows a “step-down” pattern of GFP-Dectin-1 content from 0.5 to 2 h and another from 4 to 8 h (Fig. 3, panel A). When examined by phagoFACS, the distribution of GFP-Dectin-1ΔY15 positive phagosomes was not uniform but exhibited a bimodal distribution with a composition of 30% GFP-Dectin-1ΔY15high and 70% GFP-Dectin-1ΔY15low population (Fig. 3, panel B). This ratio was unchanged even when lower β-1,3-glucan bead to cell ratios were used (data not shown) suggesting a receptor “sink” effect is unlikely. Phagosome index analysis illustrates a marginal decay rate of the GFP-Dectin-1ΔY15high decorated phagosomes as compared with a similar decay rate with GFP-Dectin-1 wild type or GFP-Dectin-1ΔY15low (Fig. 3, panel C). After confirming that Dectin-1-dependent Syk-activation is critical for GFP-Dectin-1 loss from β-1,3-glucan-containing phagosomes, we next sought to explore the role of pH on Syk activation. Given the dependence of Syk activity for Dectin-1 retention to β-1,3-glucan-containing phagosomes, we next investigated the role of phagosomal acidification on Syk phosphorylation. RAW GFP-Dectin-1 and RAW GFP-Dectin-1ΔY15 cells were incubated with β-1,3-glucan beads for various time"
https://openalex.org/W1998292611,"Notch signalling is implicated in stem and progenitor cell fate control in numerous organs. Using conditional in vivo genetic labelling we traced the fate of cells expressing the Notch2 receptor paralogue and uncovered the existence of two previously unrecognized mammary epithelial cell lineages that we term S (Small) and L (Large). S cells appear in a bead-on-a-string formation and are embedded between the luminal and basal/myoepithelial layers in a unique reiterative pattern, whereas single or paired L cells appear among ductal and alveolar cells. Long-term lineage tracing and functional studies indicate that S and L cells regulate ipsi- and contralateral spatial placement of tertiary branches and formation of alveolar clusters. Our findings revise present models of mammary epithelial cell hierarchy, reveal a hitherto undescribed mechanism regulating branching morphogenesis and may have important implications for identification of the cell-of-origin of distinct breast cancer subtypes."
https://openalex.org/W2036248917,"α-Synuclein (αS) is a membrane-binding protein with sequence similarity to apolipoproteins and other lipid-carrying proteins, which are capable of forming lipid-containing nanoparticles, sometimes referred to as ""discs."" Previously, it has been unclear whether αS also possesses this property. Using cryo-electron microscopy and light scattering, we found that αS can remodel phosphatidylglycerol vesicles into nanoparticles whose shape (ellipsoidal) and dimensions (in the 7-10-nm range) resemble those formed by apolipoproteins. The molar ratio of αS to lipid in nanoparticles is ∼1:20, and αS is oligomeric (including trimers and tetramers). Similar nanoparticles form when αS is added to vesicles of mitochondrial lipids. This observation suggests a mechanism for the previously reported disruption of mitochondrial membranes by αS. Circular dichroism and four-pulse double electron electron resonance experiments revealed that in nanoparticles αS assumes a broken helical conformation distinct from the extended helical conformation adopted when αS is bound to intact vesicles or membrane tubules. We also observed αS-dependent tubule and nanoparticle formation in the presence of oleic acid, implying that αS can interact with fatty acids and lipids in a similar manner. αS-related nanoparticles might play a role in lipid and fatty acid transport functions previously attributed to this protein."
https://openalex.org/W2044963474,"TRPV6 channels function as epithelial Ca(2+) entry pathways in the epididymis, prostate, and placenta. However, the identity of the endogenous TRPV6 protein relies on predicted gene coding regions and is only known to a certain level of approximation. We show that in vivo the TRPV6 protein has an extended N terminus. Translation initiates at a non-AUG codon, at ACG, which is decoded by methionine and which is upstream of the annotated AUG, which is not used for initiation. The in vitro properties of channels formed by the extended full-length TRPV6 proteins and the so-far annotated and smaller TRPV6 are similar, but the extended N terminus increases trafficking to the plasma membrane and represents an additional scaffold for channel assembly. The increased translation of the smaller TRPV6 cDNA version may overestimate the in vivo situation where translation efficiency may represent an additional mechanism to tightly control the TRPV6-mediated Ca(2+) entry to prevent deleterious Ca(2+) overload."
https://openalex.org/W2097580689,"The dopamine transporter (DAT) clears the extracellular dopamine released during neurotransmission and is a major target for both therapeutic and addictive psychostimulant amphetamines. Amphetamine exposure or activation of protein kinase C (PKC) by the phorbol ester PMA has been shown to down-regulate cell surface DAT. However, in dopamine neurons, the trafficking itinerary and fate of internalized DAT has not been elucidated. By monitoring surface-labeled DAT in transfected dopamine neurons from embryonic rat mesencephalic cultures, we find distinct sorting and fates of internalized DAT after amphetamine or PMA treatment. Although both drugs promote DAT internalization above constitutive endocytosis in dopamine neurons, PMA induces ubiquitination of DAT and leads to accumulation of DAT on LAMP1-positive endosomes. In contrast, after amphetamine exposure DAT is sorted to recycling endosomes positive for Rab11 and the transferrin receptor. Furthermore, quantitative assessment of DAT recycling using an antibody-feeding assay reveals that significantly less DAT returns to the surface of dopamine neurons after internalization by PMA, compared with vehicle or amphetamine treatment. These results demonstrate that, in neurons, the DAT is sorted differentially to recycling and degradative pathways after psychostimulant exposure or PKC activation, which may allow for either the transient or sustained inhibition of DAT during dopamine neurotransmission.—Hong, W.

https://openalex.org/W1986245350,"Chaperonins are a family of chaperones that encapsulate their substrates and assist their folding in an ATP-dependent manner. The ubiquitous eukaryotic chaperonin, TCP-1 ring complex (TRiC), is a hetero-oligomeric complex composed of two rings, each formed from eight different CCT (chaperonin containing TCP-1) subunits. Each CCT subunit may have distinct substrate recognition and ATP hydrolysis properties. We have expressed each human CCT subunit individually in Escherichia coli to investigate whether they form chaperonin-like double ring complexes. CCT4 and CCT5, but not the other six CCT subunits, formed high molecular weight complexes within the E. coli cells that sedimented about 20S in sucrose gradients. When CCT4 and CCT5 were purified, they were both organized as two back-to-back rings of eight subunits each, as seen by negative stain and cryo-electron microscopy. This morphology is consistent with that of the hetero-oligomeric double-ring TRiC purified from bovine testes and HeLa cells. Both CCT4 and CCT5 homo-oligomers hydrolyzed ATP at a rate similar to human TRiC and were active as assayed by luciferase refolding and human γD-crystallin aggregation suppression and refolding. Thus, both CCT4 and CCT5 homo-oligomers have the property of forming 8-fold double rings absent the other subunits, and these complexes carry out chaperonin reactions without other partner subunits.Background: The subunit-specific roles of the CCT subunits in the chaperonin, TRiC, have not been elucidated.Results: When expressed in E. coli, CCT4 and CCT5 form TRiC-like homo-oligomeric rings.Conclusion: TRiC does not require all eight CCT subunits to form functional rings.Significance: The unexpected formation of homo-oligomeric CCT rings provides clues into the assembly of TRiC as a complex.

https://openalex.org/W2110418441,"Prostate cancer (PCa) stem/progenitor cells are known to have higher chemoresistance than non-stem/progenitor cells, but the underlying molecular mechanism remains unclear. We found the expression of testicular nuclear receptor 4 (TR4) is significantly higher in PCa CD133(+) stem/progenitor cells compared with CD133(-) non-stem/progenitor cells. Knockdown of TR4 levels in the established PCa stem/progenitor cells and the CD133(+) population of the C4-2 PCa cell line with lentiviral TR4 siRNA led to increased drug sensitivity to the two commonly used chemotherapeutic drugs, docetaxel and etoposide, judging from significantly reduced IC50 values and increased apoptosis in the TR4 knockdown cells. Mechanism dissection studies found that suppression of TR4 in these stem/progenitor cells led to down-regulation of Oct4 expression, which, in turn, down-regulated the IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL1Ra) expression. Neutralization experiments via adding these molecules into the TR4 knockdown PCa stem/progenitor cells reversed the chemoresistance, suggesting that the TR4-Oct4-IL1Ra axis may play a critical role in the development of chemoresistance in the PCa stem/progenitor cells. Together, these studies suggest that targeting TR4 may alter chemoresistance of PCa stem/progenitor cells, and this finding provides the possibility of targeting TR4 as a new and better approach to overcome the chemoresistance problem in PCa therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W2049949004,"A critical step in the influenza virus replication cycle is the cleavage activation of the HA precursor. Cleavage activation of influenza HA enables fusion with the host endosome, allowing for release of the viral genome into the host cell. To date, studies have determined that HA activation is driven by trypsin-like host cell proteases, as well as yet to be identified bacterial proteases. Although the number of host proteases that can activate HA is growing, there is still uncertainty regarding which secreted proteases are able to support multicycle replication of influenza. In this study, we have determined that the kallikrein-related peptidases 5 and 12 are secreted from the human respiratory tract and have the ability to cleave and activate HA from the H1, H2, and H3 subtypes. Each peptidase appears to have a preference for particular influenza subtypes, with kallikrein 5 cleaving the H1 and H3 subtypes most efficiently and kallikrein 12 cleaving the H1 and H2 subtypes most efficiently. Cleavage analysis using HA cleavage site peptide mimics revealed that the amino acids neighboring the arginine cleavage site affect cleavage efficiency. Additionally, the thrombolytic zymogens plasminogen, urokinase, and plasma kallikrein have all been shown to cleave and activate influenza but are found circulating mainly as inactive precursors. Kallikrein 5 and kallikrein 12 were examined for their ability to activate the thrombolytic zymogens, and both resulted in activation of each zymogen, with kallikrein 12 being a more potent activator. Activation of the thrombolytic zymogens may therefore allow for both direct and indirect activation of the HA of human-adapted influenza viruses by kallikrein 5 and kallikrein 12."
https://openalex.org/W2061138037,"Nox4-derived ROS is increased in response to hyperglycemia and is required for IGF-I-stimulated Src activation. This study was undertaken to determine the mechanism by which Nox4 mediates sustained Src activation. IGF-I stimulated sustained Src activation, which occurred primarily on the SHPS-1 scaffold protein. In vitro oxidation experiments indicated that Nox4-derived ROS was able to oxidize Src when they are in close proximity, and Src oxidation leads to its activation. Therefore we hypothesized that Nox4 recruitment to the plasma membrane scaffold SHPS-1 allowed localized ROS generation to mediate sustained Src oxidation and activation. To determine the mechanism of Nox4 recruitment, we analyzed the role of Grb2, a component of the SHPS-1 signaling complex. We determined that Nox4 Tyr-491 was phosphorylated after IGF-I stimulation and was responsible for Nox4 binding to the SH2 domain of Grb2. Overexpression of a Nox4 mutant, Y491F, prevented Nox4/Grb2 association. Importantly, it also prevented Nox4 recruitment to SHPS-1. The role of Grb2 was confirmed using a Pyk2 Y881F mutant, which blocked Grb2 recruitment to SHPS-1. Cells expressing this mutant had impaired Nox4 recruitment to SHPS-1.

Two recent studies have suggested that localization of ROS generation in a specific subcellular compartment can regulate cellular signaling and biological functions. Inactivation of membrane-associated peroxiredoxin I led to local accumulation of H2O2, which was required for healing cutaneous wounds (4Woo H.A. Yim S.H. Shin D.H. Kang D. Yu D.Y. Rhee S.G.

In another study, NADPH oxidase 2 (Nox2) was found to localize in the leading edge of lamellipodial focal complex, and this was shown to play a role in endothelial cell migration (5Ikeda S.

Differential subcellular localization of Nox4 has been correlated with alteration in specific cellular functions. For instance, endoplasmic reticulum localization of Nox4 has been shown to regulate protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B-mediated alterations in EGF signaling (10Chen K. Kirber M.T. Xiao H. Yang Y. Keaney Jr., J.F. Regulation of ROS signal transduction by NADPH oxidase 4 localization.J. Cell Biol. 2008; 181: 1129-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial localized Nox4 has been shown to mediate high glucose-induced ROS generation (11Block K. Gorin Y. Abboud H.E. Subcellular localization of Nox4 and regulation in diabetes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 14385-14390Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar), and vinculin-colocalized Nox4 was shown to play an important role in mediating focal adhesion formation (12Hilenski L.L.

Our previous studies have shown that SHPS-1, a plasma membrane protein, functions as a localized scaffold for the formation of a signaling complex, which is required for mediating IGF-I signaling and biological functions in VSMC in response to hyperglycemia (13Ling Y.

Using unbiased mRNA display, we showed that Nox4 associated with SHPS-1 in response to IGF-I stimulation (14Shen X. Xi G. Radhakrishnan Y. Clemmons D.R.

However, the biological consequences and underlying mechanism of Nox4 recruitment to SHPS-1 have not been investigated. Because Nox4-derived ROS mediates IGF-I-stimulated Src oxidation and activation (9Xi G. Shen X. Maile L.A. Wai C. Gollahon K. Clemmons D.R.

Furthermore, we determined how Nox4 is recruited to SHPS-1 in response to IGF-I stimulation in VSMC and the consequences of disruption Nox4 recruitment for IGF-I signaling and biological actions in vivo. Human IGF-I was a gift from Genentech (South San Francisco, CA). Immobilon-P membranes, anti-2,4-dinitrophenyl, and Src antibodies were purchased from Millipore Corp. (Billerica, MA).

The horseradish peroxidase-conjugated mouse anti-rabbit, goat anti-mouse, and mouse anti-rabbit light chain-specific antibodies were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA). All other reagents were obtained from Sigma unless otherwise stated. A synthetic peptide was prepared that contained the TAT sequence that confers cell permeability followed by a YVNI-containing sequence (underlining indicates residues 486–496 in Nox4 except that Tyr was substituted with Asp) YARAAARQARAENRPDDVNIQL. A peptide containing a scrambled sequence (YARAAARQARAEDNPRFNQLVI) was synthesized to serve as a control peptide. In this peptide, the Tyr was substituted with Phe. The peptides were synthesized by the Protein Chemistry Core Facility at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The sequences were verified by mass spectrometry. VSMC were isolated from porcine aortas using a method described previously (17Gockerman A. Clemmons D.R. Porcine aortic smooth muscle cells secrete a serine protease for insulin-like growth factor binding protein-2.Circ. Res. 1995; 76: 514-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The cells were maintained in DMEM containing high glucose (25 mm glucose) and supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and penicillin (100 units/ml). The cells were used between passages 5 and 15. Wild type human Nox4 cDNA contained in the pCMV-SPORT6 vector was purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific (Huntsville, AL). PCR with the forward and reverse primers 5′-caccatggctgtgtcctggaggagctg-3′ and 5′-ttaAGCGTAATCTGGAACATCGTATGGGTAgctgaaagactctttattg-3′ was used to prepare the full-length cDNA. The PCR product contained a Kozak sequence (CACC) at the 5′ end and a HA sequence (capitalized) at the 3′ end. Wild type Nox4 cDNA was used as a template to generate a cDNA encoding Nox4 Y491F. The forward and reverse primers that were used were: 5′-gaacagacctgactTtgtcaacatccagctg-3′ and 5′-cagctggatgttgacaAagtcaggtctgttc-3′. The underlined bases indicate the substitutions that changed tyrosine 491 to phenylalanine. Point mutations were introduced using a standard protocol (QuikChange; Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Mitochondria-localized catalase cDNA was obtained from pCAGGS (a gift from Dr. Robinovitch, University of Washington). PCR was used to add the HA tag and a Kozak sequence with the following forward and reverse primers: 5′-caccatgctgtttaatctgaggatcctg-3′ and 5′-ttaAGCGTAATCTGGAACATCGTATGGGTAatccggactgcacaaaggtg-3′. That the constructs contained the correct sequences was verified by DNA sequencing. 293FT cells (Invitrogen) were prepared for generation of virus stocks, and VSMC expressing Nox4, Nox4 Y491F, and mitochondria-localized catalase were established using procedures that were described previously (18Xi G.

After IGF-I stimulation for the indicated times, membrane and cytoplasmic fractions proteins were isolated following a procedure described previously (18Xi G. Shen X.

Immunoprecipitation was performed by incubating 0.5 mg of cell lysate protein with 1 μg of each of the following antibodies: anti-Src, SHPS-1, Nox4, and HA at 4 °C overnight. Double immunoprecipitation was performed using a procedure described previously (19Shen X. Xi G. Radhakrishnan Y. Clemmons D.R.

Life Sci. 2010; 67: 3893-3903Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Briefly, the first round immunoprecipitation was performed with an anti-Nox4 antibody or a nonimmune IgG (control). The beads were resuspended in 30 μl of SDS buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 2% SDS) containing 1 mm DTT. The resuspended supernatant was added to cold radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (final concentration, 0.1% SDS), incubated overnight, and then used for a second immunoprecipitation with an anti-Src antibody (1: 500 dilution). The second immunoprecipitation was followed by immunoblotting that was performed as described previously (18Xi G. Shen X.

The proteins were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Total cellular protein in the lysates was determined using BCA (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The in vitro [35S]methionine (MP Biomedical, Solon, OH) labeled wild type Nox4 was generated by a transcription/translation (TnT) reaction (Promega, Madison, WI). An aliquot of the TnT mixture (0.4 μm total protein) was incubated with 200 ng of purified active Src (Millipore, Billerica, MA) in binding buffer (HEPES, pH 7.6, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm PMSF, 0.2% Triton X-100, and 10% glycerol), using a 100-μl final volume for 2 h at 4 °C. 0.5 μg of anti-Src antibody and 30 μl (50% slurry) of protein A/G-agarose beads were added and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. After extensive washing with the binding buffer, the precipitated proteins were eluted in 30 μl of 2× Laemmli sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and separated using 10% SDS-PAGE. The images were developed and analyzed using a Storm860 phosphorus imager (GE Healthcare). For Nox4/Grb2 or SHP-2 binding assays, TnT expressed Nox4 WT or Nox4 Y491F (100 ng each) was enriched by immunoprecipitating with an anti-Nox4 antibody and phosphorylated by active Src (150 unit) in a buffer containing 50 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.6), 3 mm MnCl2, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm Na3O4, and 0.2 mm ATP and incubating at 30 °C for 30 min. After extensive washing with the above buffer, purified SHP2 (Millipore, Billerica, MA; 500 ng) or Grb2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA; 500 ng) was added and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C in the binding buffer (500 μl). After extensive washing with the binding buffer, the precipitated proteins were separated using 10% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with an anti-Grb2 or SHP2 antibody, respectively. Nonoxidized Src was prepared from quiescent VSMC cultured in DMEM containing normal glucose (5 mm) by immunoprecipitating with an anti-Src antibody (1:500 dilution). The activated Nox4/p22phox enzymatic complex was prepared from VSMC cultured in DMEM containing high glucose (25 mm) followed by IGF-I (100 ng/ml) stimulation for 10 min. This has been shown to activate Nox4 enzymatic activity (9Xi G. Shen X. Maile L.A. Wai C. Gollahon K. Clemmons D.R. Hyperglycemia enhances IGF-I-stimulated Src activation via increasing Nox4-derived reactive oxygen species in a PKCζ-dependent manner in vascular smooth muscle cells.Diabetes. 2012; 61: 104-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The complexes were immunoprecipitated from cell lysates using an anti-Nox4 antibody (1:500 dilution). Control immune complexes were precipitated using lysates prepared from the cells cultured using the same conditions and precipitated with a nonimmune IgG. The immune complex was released using 50 μl of SDS buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 2% SDS) and a 3-h incubation at room temperature. To detect Src oxidation, nonoxidized Src (10 μg of IP) was incubated with Nox4 complex (10 μg of IP) in 500 μl of 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.0, 1 mm EGTA, 150 mm sucrose, and 100 μm NADPH) for 1 h at 30 °C. After extensive washing with radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer, Src was released from the immune complexes using 12% SDS. The above procedures were completed using anaerobic conditions. Src oxidation was measured using a modified OxyBlotTM protein detection kit (Millipore, Billerica, MA) as described previously (9Xi G. Shen X. Maile L.A. Wai C. Gollahon K. Clemmons D.R. Hyperglycemia enhances IGF-I-stimulated Src activation via increasing Nox4-derived reactive oxygen species in a PKCζ-dependent manner in vascular smooth muscle cells.Diabetes. 2012; 61: 104-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). After immunoprecipitating with an anti-SHPS-1 antibody, the immune complex was released using 50 μl of SDS buffer and a 3-h incubation at room temperature. 500 μl of the above-mentioned phosphate buffer was added, and hydrogen peroxide was measured using an Amplex red hydrogen peroxide assay kit (Invitrogen) by following the manufacturer's instructions. Animal maintenance conformed to the U.S. National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Hyperglycemia was induced in C57/B6 mice (Taconic, Hudson, NY) using the low dose streptozotocin protocol previously described (20Maile L.A. Capps B.E. Miller E.C. Aday A.W. Clemmons D.R. Integrin-associated protein association with SRC homology 2 domain containing tyrosine phosphatase substrate 1 regulates igf-I signaling in vivo.Diabetes. 2008; 57: 2637-2643Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Briefly, after withdrawal of food for 4 h, the mice were injected intraperitoneally with streptozotocin (50 mg/kg) (n = 72) daily for 5 days. Blood glucose levels were checked, and mice that had serum glucose concentrations >250 mg/dl were considered diabetic. They were maintained for 2 weeks before any treatment. During that time, they maintained normal activity and food intake, and no insulin injections were required. The DVNI-containing peptide (n = 24) (10 mg/kg) or the control peptide (n = 24) (10 mg/kg) was administered intraperitoneally daily for 2 days (24 h and 30 min before sacrifice). IGF-I (1 mg/kg) was administered intraperitoneally 15 min (n = 24) before sacrifice when signal transduction was being assessed and 24 h (n = 12) before sacrifice when measuring Ki67 staining. The mice were euthanized by injecting Nembutal (100 mg/kg intraperitoneally). The thoracic aortas were harvested and placed into ice-cold PBS. Connective tissue and endothelium were removed prior to protein extraction. The aortas were homogenized in ice-cold buffer (20 mm Tris, 150 mm sodium chloride, 2 mm EDTA, and 0.05% Triton X-100, pH 7.4) using a glass tissue grinder, and the lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 15 min. Protein concentrations in the supernatant were measured using a BCA assay (Thermo Scientific). Equal amounts of protein were used in each analysis. The aortas from mice were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde overnight, and paraffin-embedded sections were prepared by the University of North Carolina histology core facility. An immunohistochemistry paraffin protocol described previously (9Xi G. Shen X. Maile L.A. Wai C. Gollahon K. Clemmons D.R.

A DAPI-containing mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) was used to stain the total nuclei. The Ki67-positive nuclei and the total nuclei were counted in the aortic ring and expressed as the percentage of positive nuclei. Assessment of VSMC proliferation was performed as described previously (21Nam T.J. Busby Jr., W.H. Rees C. Clemmons D.R. Thrombospondin and osteopontin bind to insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-binding protein-5 leading to an alteration in IGF-I-stimulated cell growth.Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 1100-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were incubated with or without IGF-I (50 ng/ml) in serum-free DMEM containing high glucose (25 mm) and 0.2% platelet-poor plasma for 48 h, and the cell number in each well was counted. The results that are shown in all of the experiments are the representative of three separate experiments and expressed as the means ± S.E. The Student's t test was used to compare differences between control and one treatment or control cells and one mutant for some in vitro experiments. One- or two-way analysis of variance was applied for all data obtained from in vivo studies or when multiple treatments or multiple cell types were compared using data from in vitro studies. p ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Although Src activation is required for mediating the IGF-I signaling response during hyperglycemia (15Lieskovska J. Ling Y. Badley-Clarke J. Clemmons D.R.

Chem. 2006; 281: 25041-25053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), it is unknown whether IGF-I stimulates sustained Src activation. This is important because sustained Src activation has been linked to sustained MAP kinase activation and cell proliferation (22Sorenson C.M. Sheibani N. Sustained activation of MAPK/ERKs signaling pathway in cystic kidneys from bcl-2 −/− mice.Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2002; 283: F1085-F1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Analysis of whole cell lysates obtained at several time points showed that peak IGF-I-stimulated Src activation was sustained for 3 h and had not declined to base line after 6 h (Fig. 1A). Because our previous studies showed that hyperglycemia induced the formation of a signaling complex on the cytoplasmic domain (CD) of the scaffolding protein SHPS-1 and that IGF-I stimulated Src recruitment to that complex (13Ling Y.

The results showed that SHPS-1-associated Src activation was also sustained for at least 6 h (Fig. 1B). In contrast, non-SHPS-1-associated Src activation was transient and declined after 1 min of IGF-I stimulation (Fig. 1B)."
https://openalex.org/W2055309276,"Many factors, including duration and intensity of the unfolded protein response (UPR), dictate whether cells will adapt to endoplasmic reticulum stress or undergo apoptosis. In tuberous sclerosis (TSC), elevation of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) activity has been proposed to compound the induction of UPR transcription factors ATF4 and CHOP, suggesting that the UPR could be targeted to eradicate TSC1/2-null cells during patient therapy. Here we report that control of c-MYC translation by mTORC1 plays a key role in determining whether TSC2-null Elt3 rat leiomyoma cells apoptose in response to UPR induction by the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib. Although bortezomib induces eukaryotic initiating factor 2α phosphorylation, mTORC1 activity was also required for downstream induction of the UPR transcription factors ATF4 and CHOP by a mechanism involving increased expression of c-MYC. Although bortezomib-induced c-MYC transcription was resistant to rapamycin treatment, mTORC1 activity was required for efficient c-MYC translation. c-MYC subsequently bound to the ATF4 promoter, suggesting direct involvement of an mTORC1/c-MYC-driven signaling pathway in the activation of the UPR. Consistent with this notion, exogenously expressed c-MYC reversed the ability of rapamycin to prevent bortezomib-induced CHOP and ATF4 expression as well as apoptosis. These findings indicate that the induction of ATF4/CHOP expression occurs via mTORC1 regulation of c-MYC and that this signaling pathway is a major determinant in the ability of bortezomib to induce apoptosis."

Saccharomyces cerevisiae vps9Δ mutants have trafficking defects considerably less severe than multiple deletions of the three cognate Rab5 paralogs (Vps21, Ypt52, and Ypt53). Here, we show that Muk1, which also contains a VPS9 domain, acts as a second GEF against Vps21, Ypt52, and Ypt53. Muk1 is partially redundant with Vps9 in vivo, with vps9Δ muk1Δ double mutant cells displaying hypersensitivity to temperature and ionic stress, as well as profound impairments in endocytic and Golgi endosome trafficking, including defects in sorting through the multivesicular body. Cells lacking both Vps9 and Muk1 closely phenocopy double and triple knock-out strains lacking Rab5 paralogs. Microscopy and overexpression experiments demonstrate that Vps9 and Muk1 have distinct localization determinants. These experiments establish Muk1 as the second Rab5 GEF in budding yeast."
https://openalex.org/W2068289427,"Batroxobin is a thrombin-like serine protease from the venom of Bothrops atrox moojeni that clots fibrinogen. In contrast to thrombin, which releases fibrinopeptide A and B from the NH2-terminal domains of the Aα- and Bβ-chains of fibrinogen, respectively, batroxobin only releases fibrinopeptide A. Because the mechanism responsible for these differences is unknown, we compared the interactions of batroxobin and thrombin with the predominant γA/γA isoform of fibrin(ogen) and the γA/γ′ variant with an extended γ-chain. Thrombin binds to the γ′-chain and forms a higher affinity interaction with γA/γ′-fibrin(ogen) than γA/γA-fibrin(ogen). In contrast, batroxobin binds both fibrin(ogen) isoforms with similar high affinity (Kd values of about 0.5 μm) even though it does not interact with the γ′-chain. The batroxobin-binding sites on fibrin(ogen) only partially overlap with those of thrombin because thrombin attenuates, but does not abrogate, the interaction of γA/γA-fibrinogen with batroxobin. Furthermore, although both thrombin and batroxobin bind to the central E-region of fibrinogen with a Kd value of 2–5 μm, the α(17–51) and Bβ(1–42) regions bind thrombin but not batroxobin. Once bound to fibrin, the capacity of batroxobin to promote fibrin accretion is 18-fold greater than that of thrombin, a finding that may explain the microvascular thrombosis that complicates envenomation by B. atrox moojeni. Therefore, batroxobin binds fibrin(ogen) in a manner distinct from thrombin, which may contribute to its higher affinity interaction, selective fibrinopeptide A release, and prothrombotic properties.Background: Snake venom protease batroxobin clots fibrinogen in a manner distinct from thrombin.Results: Batroxobin binds fibrin(ogen) with higher affinity than thrombin and promotes greater clot expansion.Conclusion: Batroxobin's distinctive interaction with fibrin(ogen) may contribute to its unique pattern of fibrinopeptide release.Significance: Clinically, batroxobin is used as a defibrinogenating agent, but its capacity to promote clot expansion may promote microvascular thrombosis.

https://openalex.org/W1971094557,"GlgE is a maltosyltransferase involved in the biosynthesis of α-glucans that has been genetically validated as a potential therapeutic target against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Despite also making α-glucan, the GlgC/GlgA glycogen pathway is distinct and allosterically regulated. We have used a combination of genetics and biochemistry to establish how the GlgE pathway is regulated. M. tuberculosis GlgE was phosphorylated specifically by the Ser/Thr protein kinase PknB in vitro on one serine and six threonine residues.

The GlgE orthologues from Mycobacterium smegmatis and Streptomyces coelicolor were phosphorylated by the corresponding PknB orthologues in vitro, implying that the phosphorylation of GlgE is widespread among actinomycetes. PknB-dependent phosphorylation of GlgE led to a 2 orders of magnitude reduction in catalytic efficiency in vitro.

Significance: This study provides new opportunities to target the GlgE pathway therapeutically. Tuberculosis is caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis and remains a major threat to global health, claiming the life of 2 million individuals annually (1Dye C. Williams B.G. The population dynamics and control of tuberculosis.Science. 2010; 328: 856-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). The ability to control the tuberculosis pandemic is limited by a lack of new therapeutic agents and the rapid emergence of multi-resistant and extensively drug-resistant M. tuberculosis strains, which are essentially untreatable at this time. The development of new drugs targeting resistant strains is clearly now a priority. In searching for new vulnerable processes in M. tuberculosis to enable the development of more efficient antituberculosis chemotherapies, a novel antimycobacterial drug target has recently been discovered. GlgE is an essential maltosyltransferase that elongates α-glucans. Kalscheuer et al. (2Kalscheuer R. Syson K. Veeraraghavan U. Weinrick B. Biermann K.E. Liu Z. Sacchettini J.C. Besra G. Bornemann S. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Self-poisoning of Mycobacterium tuberculosis by targeting GlgE in an α-glucan pathway.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2010; 6: 376-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) characterized this novel carbohydrate-active enzyme and defined its role within a new nonclassical primary metabolic pathway for α-glucan biosynthesis. This four-step pathway comprises the TreS, Pep2, GlgE, and GlgB enzymes for the conversion of trehalose into a branched α-glucan that resembles glycogen (3Chandra G. Chater K.F. Bornemann S. Unexpected and widespread connections between bacterial glycogen and trehalose metabolism.Microbiology. 2011; 157: 1565-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). A key enzyme in this pathway is the essential GlgE maltosyltransferase that uses maltose 1-phosphate (M1P) 4The abbreviations used are: M1P, maltose 1-phosphate; STPK, Ser/Thr protein kinase; Bis-Tris, 2-(bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino)-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; BCG, bacillus Calmette–Guérin. as a donor substrate to generate the linear glucan backbone that is further branched by the GlgB enzyme. Moreover, the GlgE pathway is of particular interest because it is feasible that it is associated with virulence and persistence of M. tuberculosis as it might participate in the formation of capsular α-glucan, an extracellular pericellular wall component potentially involved in immune evasion (4Dinadayala P.

Microbiol. 2008; 70: 762-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the lethality associated with targeting GlgE is not due to the absence of product formation but is correlated with the hyper-accumulation to a toxic level of the GlgE donor substrate, M1P, which leads directly or indirectly to pleiotropic effects, toxicity, DNA damage, and cell death (2Kalscheuer R. Syson K. Veeraraghavan U. Weinrick B. Biermann K.E. Liu Z. Sacchettini J.C. Besra G. Bornemann S. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Self-poisoning of Mycobacterium tuberculosis by targeting GlgE in an α-glucan pathway.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2010; 6: 376-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). This novel mode of killing by self-poisoning, together with the lack of GlgE in humans, makes it an attractive candidate for future antitubercular drugs (8Kalscheuer R. Jacobs Jr., W.R. The significance of GlgE as a new target for tuberculosis.Drug News Perspect. 2010; 23: 619-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The primary metabolic GlgE pathway combines gene essentiality with a synthetic lethal interaction with another α-glucan pathway defined by the glycosyl transferase Rv3032 (2Kalscheuer R. Syson K. Veeraraghavan U. Weinrick B. Biermann K.E. Liu Z. Sacchettini J.C. Besra G. Bornemann S. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Self-poisoning of Mycobacterium tuberculosis by targeting GlgE in an α-glucan pathway.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2010; 6: 376-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In addition, there is a complex interplay between the GlgE and Rv3032 pathways with the classical GlgA-GlgC glycogen pathway in mycobacteria such that they appear collectively to produce three types of α-glucans: cytosolic glycogen, capsular α-glucan, and methylglucose lipopolysaccharide (3Chandra G. Chater K.F. Bornemann S. Unexpected and widespread connections between bacterial glycogen and trehalose metabolism.Microbiology. 2011; 157: 1565-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 7Sambou T. Dinadayala P.

Rep. 2012; 29: 834-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Therefore, each pathway is likely to be tightly regulated. To date, only the allosteric regulation of GlgC by metabolites has been reported (10Ballicora M.A. Iglesias A.A. Preiss J. ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase, a regulatory enzyme for bacterial glycogen synthesis.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2003; 67: 213-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). To overcome the stressful conditions imposed by a host, pathogens have evolved various protective and offensive responses generally achieved through cascades of phosphorylation reactions. Many of the stimuli encountered by M. tuberculosis are transduced via sensor kinases in the membrane, allowing the pathogen to adapt for survival in hostile environments. In addition to the classical two-component systems, M. tuberculosis contains 11 eukaryotic-like serine/threonine protein kinases (STPKs) (11Cole S.T. Brosch R. Parkhill J. Garnier T. Churcher C.

There is now an increasing body of evidence suggesting that many STPKs in M. tuberculosis are involved in regulating metabolic processes, transport of metabolites, cell division, and virulence (13Wehenkel A.

Signaling through Ser/Thr phosphorylation has recently emerged as a key regulatory mechanism in pathogenic mycobacteria (13Wehenkel A. Bellinzoni M. Graña M. Duran R. Villarino A. Fernandez P.

This study was undertaken to establish whether GlgE is regulated by phosphorylation in M. tuberculosis, with the potential to provide new approaches to target it therapeutically. To this end, we have identified GlgE as a new substrate of M. tuberculosis STPKs and identified its phosphorylation sites. This allowed us to address the role and contribution of phosphorylation in regulating the maltosyltransferase activity of GlgE. Importantly, with both in vitro and in vivo approaches, we provide for the first time evidence that phosphorylation will negatively regulate flux through the GlgE pathway. Strains used for cloning and expression of recombinant proteins were Escherichia coli 10G (Lucigen) and E. coli BL21(DE3)Star (Novagen) as detailed in supplemental Table S1. They were grown in LB medium at 37 °C. Media were supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/ml), hygromycin (200 μg/ml), kanamycin (25 μg/ml), or spectinomycin (100 μg/ml) when required. Mycobacteria strains were grown aerobically on Middlebrook 7H10 agar plates with oleic acid/albumin/dextrose/catalase enrichment (Difco) or in Middlebrook 7H9 medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) oleic acid/albumin/dextrose/catalase enrichment, 0.5% (v/v) glycerol and 0.05% (v/v) tyloxapol. Hygromycin (50 μg/ml) and kanamycin (25 μg/ml) were added for the selection of appropriate strains. Validamycin A (Research Products International Corp., Mount Prospect, IL) was used at 10 mm for inhibiting TreS activity when required. The glgE gene was amplified by PCR using M. tuberculosis H37Rv chromosomal DNA as the template and the forward and reverse primers listed in supplemental Table S2 containing NdeI and BamHI restriction sites, respectively. The amplified product was digested with NdeI and BamHI and ligated into the pETPhos plasmid (21Canova M.J. Kremer L. Molle V. pETPhos: a customized expression vector designed for further characterization of Ser/Thr/Tyr protein kinases and their substrates.Plasmid. 2008; 60: 149-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), a variant of pET15b (Novagen) that includes a tobacco etch virus protease site instead of the thrombin site and an N-terminal His tag free of Ser/Thr/Tyr residues, thus generating pETPhos_glgE. The glgE genes containing either the seven mutations T10A, T59A, S85A, T148A, T191A, T193A, and T370A or the mutations T10D, T59D, S85D, T191D, T193D, and T370D were both synthesized by GenScript with 5′-NdeI and 3′-BamHI restriction sites. These two glgE mutants were cloned into the pETPhos vector, generating pETPhos_glgE_T10A/T59A/S85A/T148A/T191A/T193A/T370A and pETPhos_ glgE_T10D/T59D/S85D/T148D/T191D/T193D/T370D named pEThos_glgE_Ala and pETPhos_glgE_Asp, respectively. A duet strategy was used to generate hyper-phosphorylated GlgE protein as described previously (22Molle V. Leiba J. Zanella-Cléon I. Becchi M. Kremer L. An improved method to unravel phosphoacceptors in Ser/Thr protein kinase-phosphorylated substrates.Proteomics. 2010; 10: 3910-3915Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The glgE gene was cloned into the pCDFDuet-1 vector already carrying the sequence encoding the PknB kinase domain using primers listed in supplemental Table S2, thus generating plasmid pDuet_glgE, which was used to transform E. coli BL21(DE3)Star cells to overexpress His-tagged GlgE. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Recombinant strains harboring the different constructs were used to inoculate 200 ml of LB medium supplemented with ampicillin or spectinomycin, and the resulting cultures were incubated at 37 °C with shaking until the optical density of the culture reached an A600 of 0.5. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (1 mm final) was added to induce the overexpression, and growth was continued for 3 h at 37 °C. Purification of the His-tagged recombinant proteins was performed as described by the manufacturer (Qiagen). The glgE gene from M. smegmatis was amplified by PCR using M. smegmatis mc2155 chromosomal DNA as the template and the forward and reverse primers containing NdeI and BamHI restriction sites (supplemental Table S2), respectively. The amplified product was digested with NdeI and BamHI and ligated into the pETPhos plasmid, yielding pETPhos_glgEMs, which was used as a source of His-tagged GlgEMs. The pknB kinase domain open reading frame from M. smegmatis was amplified in the same way except that the reverse primer contained a BglII restriction site (supplemental Table S2). The amplified product was digested with NdeI and BglII and ligated into the pETPhos plasmid that was previously digested with NdeI and BamHI, resulting in pETPhos_pknBMs, which was used to prepare His-tagged PknBMs. The glgE isoform I gene from S. coelicolor (Sco5443) was amplified using S. coelicolor M145 chromosomal DNA as the template with the forward and reverse primers containing NdeI and BamHI restriction sites (supplemental Table S2), respectively. The amplified product was digested with NdeI and BamHI and ligated into pETPhos, thus generating pETPhos_glgESc, which was used to prepare His-tagged GlgESc. The afsK kinase domain open reading frame from S. coelicolor was similarly amplified with the forward and reverse primers (supplemental Table S2) containing BamHI and HindIII restriction sites, respectively. The amplified product was digested with BamHI and HindIII, and ligated into the pGEX(M) vector, yielding pGEX_afsK, which was used for the production of GST-tagged AfsK, as described previously (23Molle V. Kremer L. Girard-Blanc C. Besra G.S. Cozzone A.J. Prost J.F.

In vitro phosphorylation was performed with 4 μg of wild-type GlgE or GlgE derivatives in 20 μl of buffer P (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, containing 1 mm DTT, 5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm EDTA) with 200 μCi/ml [γ-33P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, 3000 Ci/mmol) and 2–4 μg of kinase to obtain the optimal autophosphorylation activity for each mycobacterial kinase for 30 min at 37 °C. For in vitro phosphorylation with PknBMs or AfsK, 3 μg of kinase were used. Each reaction mixture was stopped by the addition of an equal volume of 5× Laemmli buffer, and the mixture was heated at 100 °C for 5 min. After electrophoresis, gels were soaked in 16% TCA for 10 min at 90 °C and dried. Radioactive proteins were visualized by autoradiography using direct exposure to films. Purified His-tagged hyper-phosphorylated GlgE (GlgE-P) from the E. coli strain carrying pDuet_glgE and co-expressing the PknB kinase domain was subjected to mass spectrometry without further treatment. Subsequent mass spectrometric analyses were performed as reported previously (16Slama N. Leiba J. Eynard N. Daffé M. Kremer L. Quémard A. Molle V.

The purified recombinant proteins were used for immunoblotting using anti-phosphothreonine, anti-phosphoserine, and anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen) and revealed with secondary antibodies labeled with IRDye infrared dyes (Odyssey Classic) to increase the detection sensitivity of phosphorylated proteins. Before assaying for enzyme activity, proteins were further purified using size exclusion chromatography using an Superdex S200 16/60 column (Amersham Biosciences) with 20 mm Tris buffer, pH 8.5, containing 100 mm NaCl at 1 ml/min. Fractions containing GlgE were pooled, dialyzed against 20 mm Tris, pH 8.5, concentrated to ∼2.3 mg/ml, and stored in aliquots at −80 °C. GlgE specific activity was monitored at 21 °C using an end-point assay involving inorganic phosphate release detection with malachite green (2Kalscheuer R. Syson K. Veeraraghavan U. Weinrick B.

Enzyme concentrations were such to allow reactions to progress linearly for 30 min with total donor consumption being <40%. Reactions were quenched with 175 μl of malachite green and incubated for 20 min at 21 °C, and the absorbance at 630 nm was measured on a SpectraMax Plus microplate spectrophotometer using SoftMax Pro 3.1.1 software. The affinity for maltohexaose was determined using this method with a 0–10 mm maltohexaose concentration range and 0.25 mm M1P. The affinity for M1P was determined at 37 °C with a 0.25–5 mm M1P concentration range and 1 mm maltohexaose using a modified method allowing the monitoring of initial rates as described previously (2Kalscheuer R.

Spectra were recorded with a sensitivity of 100 millidegrees, 0.2-nm data pitch, 4-s response time, and a 1.0-nm bandwidth at a scan speed of 20 nm/min. Triplicate spectra were averaged followed by the subtraction of buffer-only control spectra. Far-ultraviolet spectra were analyzed with Dichroweb (25Whitmore L.

It promotes apoptosis through multiple pathways, complex mechanisms of which are still elusive. The existing model of activation that emphasizes relative intramolecular movements between C-terminal PDZ and protease domains (PDZ-protease collapse in inactive and resting states) has not been able to unambiguously demonstrate dynamics of its actions. Using structure-guided design, molecular biology and protein biochemistry, we obtained various combinations of HtrA2 domains and mutants. Conformational changes and stability were characterized using molecular dynamics simulation and spectroscopic tools while functional enzymology delineated their roles in regulating enzyme catalysis. Quantitative Förster resonance energy transfer showed lesser intramolecular PDZ-protease distance in trimeric HtrA2 compared to its inactive monomeric counterpart (~21 and ~22.3 Å, respectively, at 37°C). Our findings highlight importance of N-terminal region, oligomerization, and intricate intermolecular PDZ-protease interaction in proper active-site formation, enzyme-substrate complex stabilization, and hence HtrA2 functions. These observations redefine the existing activation model and showcase a unique example of how precise interdomain coordination, plasticity, and intermolecular contacts lead to distinct functional properties and hence provide new insights into HtrA2 structure, function, and dynamics.—Chaganti, L.

Our previous studies show that PKC phosphorylation of mGluR7 on Ser-862 is a key mechanism controlling constitutive and activity-dependent surface expression of mGluR7 by regulating a competitive interaction of calmodulin and protein interacting with C kinase (PICK1). As receptor phosphorylation and dephosphorylation are tightly coordinated through the precise action of protein kinases and phosphatases, dephosphorylation by phosphatases is likely to play an active role in governing the activity-dependent or agonist-induced changes in mGluR7 receptor surface expression.

The metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) 3The abbreviations used are: mGluR, metabotropic glutamate receptor; PP1, serine/threonine protein phosphatase 1; l-AP4, l-(+)-2-amino-4-phosphonobutyric acid; PICK1, protein interacting with C kinase 1; NFAT, nuclear factor of activated T cells. are seven-transmembrane domain receptors that are linked via G proteins to intracellular signaling cascades. Eight different family members are subdivided into three groups based on sequence homology, pharmacological properties, and second messenger coupling (1Conn P.J. Pin J.P. Pharmacology and functions of metabotropic glutamate receptors.Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 205-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (2727) Google Scholar). Among the mGluR family, mGluR7 belongs to the group III mGluRs, which are coupled to inhibitory G proteins. Group III mGluRs are often presynaptic (2Shigemoto R. Kulik A. Roberts J.D. Ohishi H. Nusser Z. Kaneko T. Somogyi P. Target-cell-specific concentration of a metabotropic glutamate receptor in the presynaptic active zone.Nature. 1996; 381: 523-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 3Shigemoto R.

Neurosci. 1997; 17: 7503-7522Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and mGluR7 is highly expressed at the presynaptic active zone throughout the CNS and acts as an auto-regulatory receptor. Because of its low affinity for glutamate, mGluR7 has been proposed to be only activated under conditions of sustained synaptic activity and play a role in feedback inhibition to limit further release of glutamate at excitatory synapses (4El Far O. Betz H. G-protein-coupled receptors for neurotransmitter amino acids: C-terminal tails, crowded signalosomes.Biochem. J. 2002; 365: 329-336Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Fagni L. Ango F. Perroy J. Bockaert J. Identification and functional roles of metabotropic glutamate receptor-interacting proteins.Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 15: 289-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Like many GPCRs, mGluR7 undergoes constitutive and agonist-dependent endocytosis. The agonist-induced rapid endocytosis of mGluR7 underlies a presynaptic form of long term depression and a rapid switch to long term potentiation at naïve mossy fiber-interneuron synapses (6Pelkey K.A.

The tight regulation of mGluR7 endocytosis is thought to be regulated by several molecules interacting with the region surrounding amino acid Ser-862 as well as the PDZ binding domain of the short mGluR7 cytoplasmic tail (8Bockaert J. Perroy J. Bécamel C. Marin P. Fagni L. GPCR interacting proteins (GIPs) in the nervous system: Roles in physiology and pathologies.Annu. Rev. Pharmacol.

PICK1 interacts with and regulates PKC phosphorylation of mGLUR7.J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7252-7257Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Previously, we showed that both phosphorylation of Ser-862 and binding of PICK1 to the PDZ ligand located in the mGluR7 cytoplasmic tail are critical for regulating constitutive and agonist-induced mGluR7 trafficking. PICK1 recruits PKCα and facilitates PKCα-induced mGluR7 Ser-862 phosphorylation, which promotes stabilization of mGluR7 surface expression. By contrast, dephosphorylation destabilizes surface expression and induces internalization of mGluR7. In addition, phosphorylation of Ser-862 disrupts calmodulin binding, which normally competes with PICK1-PKCα for binding to mGluR7. The dephosphorylation triggered by neuronal activation or agonist treatment induces internalization of mGluR7. Thus, an interplay between PKC phosphorylation and CaM/PICK1 binding regulates receptor trafficking (10Suh Y.H. Pelkey K.A. Lavezzari G. Roche P.A. Huganir R.L. McBain C.J. Roche K.W. Corequirement of PICK1 binding and PKC phosphorylation for stable surface expression of the metabotropic glutamate receptor mGluR7.Neuron. 2008; 58: 736-748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Receptor phosphorylation and dephosphorylation are tightly regulated processes mediated by the precise action of protein kinases and phosphatases. Similar to protein kinases, protein phosphatases actively participate in regulating synaptic changes and the activity-dependent alterations of synaptic transmission (11Herzig S. Neumann J. Effects of serine/threonine protein phosphatases on ion channels in excitable membranes.Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 173-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 12Winder D.G. Sweatt J.D. Roles of serine/threonine phosphatases in hippocampal synaptic plasticity.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 461-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). It is clear that PKC dramatically regulates mGluR7 trafficking, but the phosphatase(s) that target mGluR7 remain unknown. Therefore, we have focused on the role of serine/threonine protein phosphatases in the regulation of Ser-862 phosphorylation of mGluR7 and subsequent surface expression of mGluR7 at synapses. In this study, we show that the serine/threonine protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) has a crucial role in the constitutive and agonist-induced dephosphorylation of Ser-862 on mGluR7. Treatment of primary neurons with okadaic acid or calyculin A led to a dramatic increase of Ser-862 phosphorylation, indicating that PP1 has a specific effect on dephosphorylation of mGluR7. Treatment of mGluR7 with an agonist, l-AP4 or NMDA, induced a profound decrease in Ser-862 phosphorylation of mGluR7. Agonist-induced dephosphorylation of mGluR7 was blocked by okadaic acid, whereas NMDA-mediated activity-induced dephosphorylation was not, suggesting a specific role of PP1 in agonist-induced acute changes in mGluR7 surface expression. Interestingly, Ser-862 phosphorylation of both mGluR7a and mGluR7b was markedly enhanced by the inhibition of PP1. In addition, surface expression of mGluR7 was enhanced and internalization of mGluR7 was inhibited by okadaic acid or co-expression of a dominant negative form of PP1γ1. Taken together, these data show that PP1 has a dynamic role in the regulation of Ser-862 phosphorylation and surface expression of mGluR7. HEK cells were maintained in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% l-glutamine. Primary hippocampal or cortical neurons were harvested from embryonic day 18 Sprague-Dawley rat embryos and maintained in Neurobasal medium (Invitrogen) with l-glutamine and B-27 supplement (Invitrogen).

For immunoprecipitation, precleared supernatants were incubated with antibody-bound protein A or G beads (Sigma) for 4 h at 4 °C and washed four times with lysis buffer. Immunoprecipitates were subjected to Western blotting. Cell surface biotinylation was performed as described previously (14Shi Y. Suh Y.H. Milstein A.D. Isozaki K. Schmid S.M. Roche K.W. Nicoll R.A.

Briefly, primary cultured cortical neurons (days in vitro 14) were treated with 50 nm okadaic acid or dimethyl sulfoxide for 45 min at 37 °C, and washed three times with ice-cold PBS containing 1 mm MgCl2 and 0.1 mm CaCl2 (PBS++). Neurons were incubated with 1 mg/ml EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin (Thermo) in PBS++ for 20 min at 4 °C with gentle shaking.

The insoluble pellet was removed by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The remaining supernatant was then incubated with 30 μl of streptavidin-agarose beads (Pierce) for 3 h at 4 °C. After washing the beads four times with lysis buffer, the bound proteins were analyzed by Western blotting. The receptor internalization assay has been described elsewhere in detail (16Lavezzari G.

Briefly, primary hippocampal neurons (days in vitro 12–14) grown on glass coverslips were transfected with mGluR7 tagged with an N-terminal c-Myc epitope. Neurons were incubated with anti-Myc antibody for 10 min at room temperature to label surface-expressed receptors, rinsed, and returned to conditioned medium for 45 min at 37 °C in the absence or presence of 50 nm okadaic acid. The neurons were then washed, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde/4% sucrose in PBS for 20 min, and blocked with 10% normal goat serum for 30 min. Surface receptors were visualized by staining with Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated secondary antibody (red). The neurons were then washed, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min, and blocked with 10% normal goat serum for 1 h, and internalized receptors were visualized by staining with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibody (green). To detect FLAG expression in Fig. 5, rabbit anti-FLAG antibody (1:500) was incubated after blocking with normal goat serum, followed by co-staining with Alexa Fluor 648-conjugated secondary antibody. The neurons were mounted with ProLong Antifade kit (Invitrogen) and imaged with a 40× objective using a Zeiss LSM 510 or 710 confocal microscope. Maximum projection images were obtained from serial optical sections at 0.36-μm intervals. The amount of internalization was quantified by measuring the integrated intensity of green and red signals using MetaMorph software (version 7.0, Universal Imaging Corp.). To evaluate the effect of protein phosphatase activity on Ser-862 phosphorylation of mGluR7, we first utilized several inhibitors of serine/threonine PP activity. Primary rat cortical neurons were treated with okadaic acid for 45 min, and Ser-862 phosphorylation of mGluR7 was detected by Western blot using a Ser-862 phosphorylation state-specific antibody that was previously characterized (10Suh Y.H. Pelkey K.A. Lavezzari G. Roche P.A. Huganir R.L. McBain C.J. Roche K.W. Corequirement of PICK1 binding and PKC phosphorylation for stable surface expression of the metabotropic glutamate receptor mGluR7.Neuron. 2008; 58: 736-748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Ser-862 phosphorylation of mGluR7 was dramatically increased by the treatment of neurons with 10–500 nm okadaic acid, whereas treatment with a lower concentration of okadaic acid (<5 nm) did not lead to any changes of Ser-862 phosphorylation (Fig. 1, A–C). Okadaic acid is a potent inhibitor of both PP1 and PP2A, but 100-fold more potent for PP2A than for PP1 (IC50 value is 10–270 and 0.2–2 nm for PP1 and PP2A, respectively) (11Herzig S. Neumann J.

Therefore, the inability of low dose okadaic acid to enhance mGluR7 phosphorylation suggests that Ser-862 of mGluR7 is a target of PP1 rather than PP2A. To confirm that PP1 regulates Ser-862 phosphorylation, we utilized several other PP inhibitors, including FK506, calyculin A, and fostriecin. FK506 is a protein phosphatase 2B-specific inhibitor (20Liu J. Farmer Jr., J.D. Lane W.S. Friedman J. Weissman I. Schreiber S.L.

Both FK506 and fostriecin did not alter mGluR7 Ser-862 phosphorylation; however, there was a dramatic increase in mGluR7 phosphorylation with the treatment of calyculin A (Fig. 1, D and E). In addition, we observed increased phosphorylation of NFAT, which is a target molecule of calcineurin (protein phosphatase 2B) (23Schwartz N. Schohl A. Ruthazer E.S.

Therefore, PP2A and protein phosphatase 2B are not involved in regulating the phosphorylation of mGluR7. Time course experiments revealed that phosphorylation of Ser-862 begins to increase after a 15-min treatment with 50 nm okadaic acid (Fig. 1G). For this reason, neurons were treated with 50 nm okadaic acid for 45 min throughout this study. Together, these data demonstrate that Ser-862 of mGluR7 is dephosphorylated specifically by PP1. We recently found that mGluR7 undergoes endocytosis following treatment with an agonist l-AP4 (6Pelkey K.A. Lavezzari G. Racca C. Roche K.W.

However, the direct effect of agonist treatment on Ser-862 phosphorylation has not been determined. To examine agonist-induced alterations in Ser-862 phosphorylation, l-AP4 (400 μm) was applied to primary rat cortical neurons for 15 min. To control the extracellular environment, conditioned culture medium was replaced with artificial cerebrospinal fluid without Mg2+ 30 min prior to l-AP4 treatment. We observed a 40% reduction of Ser-862 phosphorylation following treatment of primary neurons with l-AP4 (Fig. 2A). Treatment of neurons with high concentration of l-glutamate (1 mm) or NMDA (50 μm) also led to a dramatic reduction of Ser-862 phosphorylation (∼50%), whereas addition of AMPA (100 μm) had no effect on mGluR7 phosphorylation (Fig. 2B). To examine the PP1 dependence in agonist-induced mGluR7 dephosphorylation, okadaic acid was applied for 45 min prior to and during l-AP4 treatment (15 min). Okadaic acid completely blocked the decrease of Ser-862 phosphorylation by l-AP4, whereas dephosphorylation induced by NMDA was not completely blocked by okadaic acid (Fig. 2C). These data indicate that NMDA-mediated dephosphorylation mGluR7 is regulated by a mechanism that is distinct from that of l-AP4 and that NMDA-mediated dephosphorylation mGluR7 is not mediated by PP1. To determine whether Ser-862 on mGluR7a and/or mGluR7b is a target of PP1 in primary neurons, we examined isoform-specific mGluR7 Ser-862 dephosphorylation. An mGluR7a-specific antibody is commercially available, and we successfully generated an mGluR7b-specific antibody using a peptide corresponding to mGluR7b amino acids 901–922 (3Shigemoto R. Kinoshita A. Wada E. Nomura S. Ohishi H. Takada M. Flor P.J. Neki A. Abe T. Nakanishi S. Mizuno N. Differential presynaptic localization of metabotropic glutamate receptor subtypes in the rat hippocampus.J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 7503-7522Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This antibody specifically recognized mGluR7b as confirmed in immunoblots of mGluR7a- or mGluR7b-expressing HEK cells (Fig. 3A). Primary cortical neurons were treated with okadaic acid, and the lysates were immunoprecipitated using mGluR7a- or mGluR7b-specific antibodies and probed using the phospho-Ser-862-specific antibody. Surprisingly, we found that okadaic acid treatment dramatically enhanced phosphorylation of Ser-862 on both mGluR7a and mGluR7b (Fig. 3B), indicating that both mGluR7a Ser-862 and mGluR7b Ser-862 are dephosphorylated by PP1. We have previously reported that PKCα increases Ser-862 phosphorylation of mGluR7 and stabilizes the receptor on the neuronal surface (10Suh Y.H. Pelkey K.A. Lavezzari G. Roche P.A. Huganir R.L. McBain C.J. Roche K.W. Corequirement of PICK1 binding and PKC phosphorylation for stable surface expression of the metabotropic glutamate receptor mGluR7.Neuron. 2008; 58: 736-748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). As Ser-862 phosphorylation is markedly enhanced by the inhibition of PP1, we examined whether PP1 regulates mGluR7 expression by altering mGluR7 internalization. To analyze surface-expressed endogenous mGluR7a and mGluR7b, primary rat cortical neurons were subjected to cell surface biotinylation. Primary neurons were treated with okadaic acid or vehicle for 45 min and membrane-impermeable sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin was added to the cells for 20 min at 4 °C. Surface-expressed receptors were isolated using streptavidin-agarose beads. Treatment with okadaic acid increased surface expression of both mGluR7a and mGluR7b by ∼40% as compared with the cells treated with dimethyl sulfoxide (Fig. 4, A and B). We next examined whether the stabilization of mGluR7 on the neuronal surface is caused by the reduced internalization. To monitor the internalization of mGluR7 by okadaic acid, we transfected N-terminal Myc-tagged mGluR7a in primary hippocampal neurons, labeled surface-expressed mGluR7a with c-Myc antibody, and then allowed internalization of receptors at 37 °C for 45 min. Surface receptors were visualized with Alexa Fluor 568-labeled secondary antibodies (red) before permeabilization, whereas the internalized receptors were visualized using Alexa Fluor 488-labeled secondary antibodies (green) after permeabilization. We observed a 20% decrease in mGluR7 internalization in cells treated with okadaic acid (Fig. 4, C and D). Taken together, our data demonstrate that increased Ser-862 phosphorylation by inhibition of PP1 reduces the internalization of mGluR7 and stabilizes mGluR7 on neuronal surface. We extended our study to include overexpression of the D95N mutant of PP1γ1, in which the catalytic domain is inactive (28Zhang J. Zhang Z. Brew K. Lee E.Y. Mutational analysis of the catalytic subunit of muscle protein phosphatase-1.Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6276-6282Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) in primary neurons to address the different role of l-AP4 and NMDA in the internalization of mGluR7. We co-transfected PP1γ1 D95N with mGluR7a in primary hippocampal neurons and examined the internalization of mGluR7a. The internalization of mGluR7a was reduced by ∼20% in PP1γ1 D95N-transfected neurons, and the agonist l-AP4 did not have a significant effect on the internalization of mGluR7a in PP1γ1 D95N-transfected neurons, whereas NMDA partially rescued the internalization of mGluR7 (Fig. 5). Therefore, PP1γ1 D95N stabilizes mGluR7 on the neuronal surface by regulating mGluR7 Ser-862 phosphorylation. The regulation of protein phosphorylation is a reversible process maintained by the balanced action of protein kinases and phosphatases that are crucial in directly modulating synaptic plasticity (29Lee H.K. Synaptic plasticity and phosphorylation.Pharmacol. Ther. 2006; 112: 810-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). As PKC-induced Ser-862 phosphorylation of mGluR7 is critical for a rapid change of mGluR7 trafficking and presynaptic plasticity, we have sought to identify the serine/threonine PP that dephosphorylates mGluR7 Ser-862 and opposes the role of PKCα. In the present study, among several serine/threonine PPs examined, we have identified PP1 as the key protein phosphatase regulating phosphorylation of Ser-862 on mGluR7. PP1 is involved in agonist-induced dephosphorylation of Ser-862 phosphorylation of mGluR7. Furthermore, PP1 regulates mGluR7 trafficking by modulating Ser-862 phosphorylation. Therefore, our data suggest PP1 is involved in reversing PKC-induced changes of mGluR7 trafficking and surface expression. The time course of the okadaic acid effects on Ser-862 seems be slow compared with phosphorylation induced by kinases, which usually starts to increase within a few minutes. We have no clear explanation for this; however, one explanation might be the slow penetration of okadaic acid into the neurons, which has been reported in case of neutrophils (30Kreienbühl P. Keller H. Niggli V. Protein phosphatase inhibitors okadaic acid and calyculin A alter cell shape and F-actin distribution and inhibit stimulus-dependent increases in cytoskeletal actin of human neutrophils.Blood. 1992; 80: 2911-2919Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A second possibility is that the kinase activity on Ser-862 may be constitutively robust, such that the inhibitory effect of phosphatase activity may be reflected slowly. We found that treatment with the mGluR7 agonists l-AP4 or glutamate lead to the dephosphorylation of mGluR7 in primary neurons. As l-AP4 induces mGluR7 internalization in neurons, this finding suggests that the surface expression of mGluR7 is tightly regulated by the Ser-862 phosphorylation status. To determine whether agonist-induced dephosphorylation and internalization of mGluR7 is dependent on the action of protein phosphatases, okadaic acid or the PP1γ1 D95N catalytic inactive mutant was utilized along with l-AP4 on primary cortical neurons. We found that l-AP4 did not induce dephosphorylation of Ser-862 and internalization of mGluR7 following the inhibition of PP1, demonstrating that l-AP4-induced dephosphorylation of Ser-862 is mediated by PP1. In sharp contrast, NMDA-induced dephosphorylation and internalization was not affected by inhibition of PP1. The NMDA-induced changes in Ser-862 phosphorylation status may be due to the activity of a distinct unidentified phosphatase, NMDA may directly inactivate kinases other than PKCα, or NMDA-induced changes may regulate different intracellular stores of mGluR7. The effects of okadaic acid on the surface expression of mGluR7 are modest and the increase in mGluR7 Ser-862 phosphorylation by okadaic acid is not proportional to the amount of mGluR7 internalization. We believe that a mGluR7-interacting molecule such as calmodulin or PICK1 is also an important determinant for mGluR7 internalization. For example, PICK1 binding to phosphorylated mGluR7 is primarily modulated by calmodulin binding to mGluR7 and not by Ser-862 phosphorylation per se (10Suh Y.H. Pelkey K.A. Lavezzari G. Roche P.A. Huganir R.L. McBain C.J. Roche K.W.

There is an out-of-frame insertion before the last exon of the mGluR7 gene, resulting in alternative spliced isoforms, mGluR7a and mGluR7b. Therefore, 16 amino acids of mGluR7a and 23 amino acids of mGluR7b differ in their extreme C-terminal tails (31Corti C. Restituito S. Rimland J.M. Brabet I. Corsi M. Pin J.P. Ferraguti F.

Previous studies showed that PP1γ1 directly interacts with mGluR7b, but not mGluR7a, as determined using GST pulldown assays or yeast two-hybrid system interactions (33Croci C. Sticht H.

This binding is mediated primarily by the N-terminal domain of PP1γ1 and the C-terminal region of mGluR7b (KSVTW; amino acids 911–915). Trp-915 of mGluR7b is critical for this binding. The conserved docking motif interacting with the PP1 catalytic subunit is (R/K)-x(0,1)-(V/I)-x-F, which is found in many, but not all, proteins that bind to PP1γ1 (36Egloff M.P. Johnson D.F.

Serine/threonine phosphatases: mechanism through structure.Cell. 2009; 139: 468-484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1063) Google Scholar). The proposed PP1γ1-binding motif is similar but not identical to this consensus motif in mGluR7b but is not conserved in the mGluR7a C-terminal region. Instead, the KSVT motif without Trp is conserved in the secondary intracellular loop both in mGluR7a and -b. Although PP1γ1, a catalytic subunit of PP, seems to bind to both mGluR7a and mGluR7b in co-immunoprecipitation experiments using HEK cells (data not shown), we were not able to identify a consensus interacting motif on mGluR7a. However, our findings that inhibition of PP1 increased phosphorylation of Ser-862 and surface expression of mGluR7a suggest that Ser-862 of mGluR7a as well as mGluR7b is a target of PP1. It is unlikely that mGluR7a and mGluR7b form a heterodimer and that PP1γ1 dephosphorylates mGluR7a in the heterodimer without directly binding to mGluR7a. Data against the heterodimer model comes from a previous report showing that mGluR7b displays are more restricted distribution in the brain than mGluR7a (39Kinoshita A. Shigemoto R. Ohishi H. van der Putten H. Mizuno N. Immunohistochemical localization of metabotropic glutamate receptors, mGluR7a and mGluR7b, in the central nervous system of the adult rat and mouse: a light and electron microscopic study.J. Comp. Neurol. 1998; 393: 332-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). In addition, mGluR7a co-immunoprecipitates with PP1γ1 in cells that do not express mGluR7b (data not shown). Rather than this heterodimeric model, we hypothesize that the binding of PP1γ1 to mGluR7a may be contributed by multiple domains, including both cytoplasmic and intracellular loops, or may be mediated indirectly by unidentified mGluR7-interacting molecules via transmembrane domains. The serine/threonine PP family includes PP1, PP2A, protein phosphatase 2B (calcineurin), and PP4–7 in eukaryotic cells (11Herzig S. Neumann J. Effects of serine/threonine protein phosphatases on ion channels in excitable membranes.Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 173-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 38Shi Y. Serine/threonine phosphatases: mechanism through structure.Cell. 2009; 139: 468-484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1063) Google Scholar). Among these phosphatases, the PP1 catalytic subunit is classified into PP1α, PP1β (also termed PP1δ), and PP1γ that are all present on distinct genes. PP1γ has two splice variants, PP1γ1 and PP1γ2. Although these subunits possess distinct tissue distribution, all of these are expressed in brain (11Herzig S. Neumann J. Effects of serine/threonine protein phosphatases on ion channels in excitable membranes.Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 173-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), and PP1γ1 is enriched in presynaptic boutons and dendrites (40Strack S. Kini S. Ebner F.F. Wadzinski B.E. Colbran R.J. Differential cellular and subcellular localization of protein phosphatase 1 isoforms in brain.J. Comp. Neurol. 1999; 413: 373-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The catalytic subunit of PP1 is highly conserved and interacts with >50 regulatory subunits, which play inhibitory roles on PP1 activity (37Munton R.P. Vizi S. Mansuy I.M. The role of protein phosphatase-1 in the modulation of synaptic and structural plasticity.FEBS Lett. 2004; 567: 121-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and anchor the phosphatase directly to a membrane receptor (12Winder D.G. Sweatt J.D. Roles of serine/threonine phosphatases in hippocampal synaptic plasticity.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 461-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 41Cohen P.T. Protein phosphatase 1–targeted in many directions.J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 241-256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For instance, yotiao targets the catalytic subunit of PP1 or the regulatory subunit of protein kinase A to the NMDA receptor NR1, and PP1 inhibition by okadaic acid enhances peak NMDA-evoked currents (42Westphal R.S. Tavalin S.J. Lin J.W. Alto N.M. Fraser I.D. Langeberg L.K. Sheng M. Scott J.D. Regulation of NMDA receptors by an associated phosphatase-kinase signaling complex.Science. 1999; 285: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Thus, it is quite possible that an unidentified regulatory component may affect anchoring of phosphatases near mGluR7 at the presynaptic active zone. Further study of the spatiotemporal control of phosphatase interactions with mGluR7 in vivo will certainly be an important goal. We thank J. D. Badger II for preparing primary neuron cultures, Dr. C.

https://openalex.org/W2073104538,"Rhomboids represent an evolutionarily ancient protease family. Unlike most other proteases, they are polytopic membrane proteins and specialize in cleaving transmembrane protein substrates. The polar active site of rhomboid protease is embedded in the membrane and normally closed. For the bacterial rhomboid GlpG, it has been proposed that one of the transmembrane helices (S5) of the protease can rotate to open a lateral gate, enabling substrate to enter the protease from inside the membrane. Here, we studied the conformational change in GlpG by solving the cocrystal structure of the protease with a mechanism-based inhibitor. We also examined the lateral gating model by cross-linking S5 to a neighboring helix (S2). The crystal structure shows that inhibitor binding displaces a capping loop (L5) from the active site but causes only minor shifts in the transmembrane helices. Cross-linking S5 and S2, which not only restricts the lateral movement of S5 but also prevents substrate from passing between the two helices, does not hinder the ability of the protease to cleave a membrane protein substrate in detergent solution and in reconstituted membrane vesicles. Taken together, these data suggest that a large lateral movement of the S5 helix is not required for substrate access to the active site of rhomboid protease."

We found that expression of wild-type p53-induced phosphatase 1 (Wip1) is markedly down-regulated during persistent DNA damage and after drug release during the acquisition of the senescent phenotype in carcinoma cells. We demonstrate that down-regulation of Wip1 is required for maintenance of permanent G2 arrest. In fact, we show that forced expression of Wip1 in premature senescent tumor cells induces inappropriate re-initiation of mitosis, uncontrolled polyploid progression, and cell death by mitotic failure. Most of the effects of Wip1 may be attributed to its ability to dephosphorylate p53 at Ser(15) and to inhibit DNA damage response. However, we also uncover a regulatory pathway whereby suppression of p53 Ser(15) phosphorylation is associated with enhanced phosphorylation at Ser(46), increased p53 protein levels, and induction of Noxa expression. On the whole, our data indicate that down-regulation of Wip1 expression during premature senescence plays a pivotal role in regulating several p53-dependent aspects of the senescent phenotype."

The enzyme alters DNA topology through protein-operated DNA gate, switching between open and closed conformations during its reaction. We describe the mechanism of inhibition of Mycobacterium smegmatis and Mycobacterium tuberculosis topoI by monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that bind with high affinity and inhibit at 10–50 nM concentration. Unlike other inhibitors of topoisomerases, the mAbs inhibited several steps of relaxation reaction, namely DNA binding, cleavage, strand passage, and enzyme-DNA dissociation. The enhanced religation of the cleaved DNA in presence of the mAb indicated closing of the enzyme DNA gate. The formation of enzyme-DNA heterocatenane in the presence of the mAbs as a result of closing the gate could be inferred by the salt resistance of the complex, visualized by atomic force microscopy and confirmed by fluorescence measurements. Locking the enzyme-DNA complex as a closed clamp restricted the movements of the DNA gate, affecting all of the major steps of the relaxation reaction. Enzyme trapped on DNA in closed clamp conformation formed roadblock for the elongating DNA polymerase. The unusual multistep inhibition of mycobacterial topoisomerases may facilitate lead molecule development, and the mAbs would also serve as valuable tools to probe the enzyme mechanism.—Leelaram, M.

Herein, different lentivirus infections in conjunction with neural cell viability were investigated, concentrating on type 1 interferon-regulated pathways. Transcriptomic network analyses showed a preponderance of genes involved in type 1 interferon signaling, which was verified by increased expression of the type 1 interferon-associated genes, Mx1 and CD317, in brains from HIV-infected persons (P<0.05). Leukocytes infected with different strains of FIV or HIV-1 showed differential Mx1 and CD317 expression (P<0.05). In vivo studies of animals infected with the FIV strains, FIVch or FIVncsu, revealed that FIVch-infected animals displayed deficits in memory and motor speed compared with the FIVncsu- and mock-infected groups (P<0.05). TNF-α, IL-1β, and CD40 expression was increased in the brains of FIVch-infected animals; conversely, Mx1 and CD317 transcript levels were increased in the brains of FIVncsu-infected animals, principally in microglia (P<0.05). Gliosis and neuronal loss were evident among FIVch-infected animals compared with mock- and FIVncsu-infected animals (P<0.05).

Besides HIF-α, pVHL also interacts with other proteins and has multiple functions. Here, we report that pVHL inhibits ribosome biogenesis and protein synthesis. We find that pVHL associates with the 40S ribosomal protein S3 (RPS3) but does not target it for destruction. Rather, the pVHL-RPS3 association interferes with the interaction between RPS3 and RPS2. Expression of pVHL also leads to nuclear retention of pre-40S ribosomal subunits, diminishing polysomes and 18S rRNA levels. We also demonstrate that pVHL suppresses both cap-dependent and cap-independent protein synthesis. Our findings unravel a novel function of pVHL and provide insight into the regulation of ribosome biogenesis by the tumor suppressor pVHL."

Here we report that ThPOK binds directly to the promoter region of the Eomes gene to repress its expression in CD4(+) T cells. We identified the histone acetyltransferase TIP60 as a co-repressor of ThPOK-target genes, where ectopically expressed TIP60 increased ThPOK protein stability by promoting its acetylation at its Lys(360) residue to then augment the transcriptional repression of Eomes. Moreover, knockdown of endogenous TIP60 abolished the stabilization of ThPOK in CD4(+) T cells, which led to the transcriptional activation of Eomes and increased production of IFNγ. Our results reveal a novel pathway by which TIP60 and ThPOK synergistically suppresses Eomes function and IFNγ production, which could contribute to the regulation of inflammation."

A recent comparative analysis of REGγ expression in mouse and human tissues reveals a unique pattern of REGγ in specific cell types, suggesting undisclosed functions and biological importance of this molecule. Despite the emerging progress made in REGγ-related studies, how REGγ function is regulated remains to be explored. In this study, we report for the first time that REGγ can be acetylated mostly on its lysine 195 (Lys-195) residue by CREB binding protein (CBP), which can be reversed by sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) in mammalian cells. Site-directed mutagenesis abrogated acetylation at Lys-195 and significantly attenuated the capability of REGγ to degrade its target substrates, p21 and hepatitis C virus core protein. Mechanistically, acetylation at Lys-195 is important for the interactions between REGγ monomers and ultimately influences REGγ heptamerization. Biological analysis of cells containing REGγ-WT or REGγ-K195R mutant indicates an impact of acetylation on REGγ-mediated regulation of cell proliferation and cell cycle progression. These findings reveal a previously unknown mechanism in the regulation of REGγ assembly and activity, suggesting a potential venue for the intervention of the ubiquitin-independent REGγ proteasome activity."

Rare A→T TP53 mutations were recently discovered in AA-associated urothelial cancers. The near absence of these mutations among all other sequenced human tumors suggests that they could be biologically silent. There are no cell banks with established lines derived from human tumors with which to explore the influence of the novel mutants on p53 function and cellular behavior. To investigate their impact, we generated isogenic mutant clones by integrase-mediated cassette exchange at the p53 locus of platform (null) murine embryonic fibroblasts and kidney epithelial cells. Common tumor mutants (R248W, R273C) were compared with the AA-associated mutants N131Y, R249W, and Q104L. Assays of cell proliferation, migration, growth in soft agar, apoptosis, senescence, and gene expression revealed contrasting outcomes on cellular behavior following introduction of N131Y or Q104L. The N131Y mutant demonstrated a phenotype akin to common tumor mutants, whereas Q104L clone behavior resembled that of cells with wild-type p53. Wild-type p53 responses were restored in double-mutant cells harboring N131Y and N239Y, a second-site rescue mutation, suggesting that pharmaceutical reactivation of p53 function in tumors expressing N131Y could have therapeutic benefit. N131Y is likely to contribute directly to tumor phenotype and is a promising candidate biomarker of AA exposure and disease. Rare mutations thus do not necessarily point to sites where amino acid exchanges are phenotypically neutral.

As described above, erythropoiesis is predominantly regulated by Epo stimulation and by transcriptional control with the development-specific transcription factor GATA-1. Friend leukemia integration 1 (FLI-1) is one of the well known regulators of erythropoiesis. FLI-1, a member of the ETS family of transcription factors that was originally identified in MEL cells, has a role in erythroleukemia induction (17Ben-David Y. Giddens E.B. Bernstein A.

However, FLI-1 activates megakaryocytic differentiation (19Athanasiou M. Clausen P.A. Mavrothalassitis G.J. Zhang X.K. Watson D.K. Blair D.G. Increased expression of the ETS-related transcription factor FLI-1/ERGB correlates with and can induce the megakaryocytic phenotype.Cell Growth & Differ. 1996; 7: 1525-1534PubMed Google Scholar). Both FLI-1 and EKLF/KLF1 bind to GATA-1 and are functionally antagonistic to the activation of megakaryocytic and erythrocytic gene promoters (20Starck J. Cohet N. Gonnet C. Sarrazin S.

Expression of Myc and Myb genes are down-regulated during MEL cell differentiation, and overexpression of these genes blocks differentiation (26Kaneko-Ishino T. Kume T.U. Sasaki H. Obinata. M.

K562 cells were isolated from the blood of patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia. Sodium butyrate and hemin also induce erythroid differentiation of K562 cells (30Lozzio C.B. Lozzio B.B.

In a phenotypic analysis of K562 cells, the rate of formation of transferrin receptor (CD71)/glycophorin A-positive cells was increased by hemin-mediated induction of differentiation (33Di Pietro R. di Giacomo V Caravatta L. Sancilio S. Rana R.A. Cataldi A. Cyclic nucleotide response element binding (CREB) protein activation is involved in K562 erythroleukemia cells differentiation.J. Cell. Biochem. 2007; 100: 1070-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). During erythroid differentiation, CD71 is highly expressed in the pre-proerythroblast and the erythroblasts that follow, whereas glycophorin A expression is delayed relative to CD71 and correlates with the transition from the pro-erythroblast to the basophilic normoblast (34Wojda U. Noel P. Miller J.L. Fetal and adult hemoglobin production during adult erythropoiesis: coordinate expression correlates with cell proliferation.Blood. 2002; 99: 3005-3013Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Although MEL and K562 cells are erythroleukemia cells, these cells are useful models for the study of erythroid differentiation because they can be induced to differentiate like normal erythroid cells. We here used DNA microarrays to screen for erythroid differentiation-related genes to identify novel regulators of hemoglobin production and erythroid differentiation. We compared the expression profile of high differentiation-inducible (HD) and low differentiation-inducible (LD) MEL cells during differentiation induced by three different chemicals. We selected the consistently down-regulated genes in HD MEL cells as candidate differentiation suppressors and then overexpressed these genes in HD MEL cells to analyze for inhibition of hemoglobin production. We found that overexpression of α-1,6-fucosyltransferase (Fut8) inhibited hemoglobin production in the MEL cell. We then performed functional analysis of FUT8 to understand the mechanism of suppression of hemoglobin production and erythroid differentiation, as observed in MEL and K562 cells. MEL cells (T-3-Cl-2–0.fl) (35Ikawa Y. Aida M. Inoue Y. Isolation and characterization of high and low differentiation-inducible Friend leukemia lines.Gann. 1976; 67: 767-770PubMed Google Scholar) and K562 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Nissui Pharmaceutical) with 10% fetal calf serum (Sigma-Aldrich) at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Both cell lines were provided by RIKEN BioResource Center (Ibaraki, Japan). HD and LD MEL cells were obtained by recloning the original MEL cells. Erythroid differentiation was determined by benzidine staining. PLAT-E cells (36Morita S. Kojima T. Kitamura T.

These cDNA clone sets were provided by Riken BioResource Center. Microarray preparation, RNA labeling, and hybridization procedures are described in the supplemental material. For comparison of HD and LD MEL cell expression profiles, HD and LD MEL cells were cultured for 6, 12, 24, and 36 h with 1.0% DMSO, 3.0 mm HMBA, or 15 nm TSA, respectively. For expression analysis of HD MEL cells during differentiation, HD MEL cells were cultured for 1, 6, 12, 24, and 36 h with 1.5% DMSO, 5.0 mm HMBA, or 30 nm TSA, respectively. Total RNA from MEL cells was extracted using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). Hybridization images were scanned using a ScanArray 5000 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The fluorescence intensity of the cDNA microarray was quantified using QuantArray 3.0 software (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The cDNA microarray data were analyzed using GeneSpring 6.0 (Silicon Genetics). Intensity differences between Cy3 and Cy5 were normalized by the LOWESS method. The expression ratio for each time experiment is expressed as the average of quadruplicate experiments, including two dye swaps. The complete microarray data were archived at the National Center for Biotechnology Information Gene Expression Omnibus (accession numbers GSE40754 and GSE43849) (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). Total RNA of MEL and K562 cells was extracted using the RNeasy mini kit. cDNA was synthesized from the total RNA using SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). The targeted genes were amplified by PCR using KOD Plus (Toyobo); the primers are described in the supplemental material. The PCR products were purified by isopropyl alcohol precipitation and restricted using restriction enzymes as described in the supplemental material. The DNA fragments were purified using the Wizard SV Gel and PCR Clean-Up System (Promega). The purified DNA fragments of the targeted genes were cloned into the vector pMXs-CMVp-IRES-EGFP that contains an enhancer of the cytomegalovirus promoter in the 5′-long terminal repeat sequence. This vector is a modification of the vector pMXs-IRES-EGFP (40Nosaka T Kawashima T. Misawa K. Ikuta K. Mui A.L. Kitamura T. STAT5 as a molecular regulator of proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis in hematopoietic cells.EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4754-4765Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar) that was kindly provided by Dr. Kitamura. The cloned vectors were introduced into PLAT-E or PLAT-A cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), and culture supernatants containing virus were collected 48 h after transfection. MEL and K562 cells were grown in the culture supernatant supplemented with 0.08–4 μg/ml Polybrene to aid infection. The infected cells were cloned using the limiting dilution method, and targeted gene overexpression was verified by measuring of the expression of enhanced green fluorescent protein using FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences). Site-directed mutagenesis of mouse Fut8 and human FUT8 was performed with Splicing by Overlap Extension PCR. The primer sequences are listed in the supplemental material. Additional procedures are the same as described above. FUT8 was detected in Western blotting using goat anti-FucT-VIII antibody (S-17; catalog no. sc-34629, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and HRP-conjugated rabbit anti-goat antibody (catalog no. 61-1620, Zymed Laboratories Inc.). GAPDH was detected with mouse anti-GAPDH antibody (clone 6C5; catalog no. AM4300, Ambion) and HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (catalog no. 62-6520, Zymed Laboratories Inc.). The experimental conditions were different between overexpression and knockdown studies. The experimental details are described in the supplemental material. Total RNA from MEL and K562 cells was extracted using the RNeasy mini kit. cDNA was synthesized from the total RNA using SuperScript III reverse transcriptase. PCR was performed using GoTaq Flexi DNA polymerase (Promega). The primers for RT-PCR analysis are described in the supplemental material. shRNAs for FUT8 were designed by siDirect. shRNA sequences are described in the supplemental material. Forward and reverse oligonucleotides were denatured for 5 min at 95 °C and annealed for 1 h at 37 °C. The annealed, double-stranded oligonucleotide was ligated into the piGENE hU6 puro vector (iGENE Therapeutics) that had been restricted with BspMI. The plasmids containing the shRNA constructs were then restricted with EcoRI and BamHI, and the DNA containing both the shRNA and hU6 promoter sequence was introduced into the EcoRI and BamHI-digested piGENE U6 Rep vector (iGENE Therapeutics) that included EBNA1 genes and OriP sequence. The piGENE U6 Rep T7STOP vector (iGENE Therapeutics) was used as a negative control vector. These vectors were transfected into K562 cells by electroporation using Bio-Rad Gene Pulser II (Bio-Rad). The transfected cells were cultured with 2 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma-Aldrich) for 2 weeks. Flow cytometric analysis was performed using FACSCalibur. The cells were stained with anti-human CD235a (glycophorin A) FITC (catalog no. 11-9987; eBioscience) and anti-human CD71 (transferrin receptor) PE (catalog no. 12-0719; eBioscience). We screened for differentiation-related genes in MEL cells using cDNA microarray analysis. Prior to microarray analysis, we selected clones of HD and LD MEL cells by recloning from the original cells. HD MEL cells were more highly differentiated than LD MEL cells by treatment with 1.0% DMSO, 3.0 mm HMBA, or 15 nm TSA (Fig. 1A). The concentrations of each chemical were reduced for comparable microarray analysis, because general concentrations, 1.5% DMSO, 5.0 mm HMBA, or 30 nm TSA, were affecting the growth of LD MEL cells (data not shown). The rate of cell differentiation was determined by benzidine staining of hemoglobin. There were no differences in cell growth between HD and LD cells in chemical treatment (Fig. 1B). Next, we compared the expression profiles of HD and LD MEL cells during differentiation induced by 1.0% DMSO, 3.0 mm HMBA, or 15 nm TSA using a cDNA microarray that was prepared from NIA mouse 15k and 7.4k cDNA clone sets. We compared gene expression profiles at 6, 12, 24, and 36 h after chemical treatment. In this microarray study, we defined up-regulated and down-regulated genes of expression ratio as >1.5 and <0.66, respectively. Table 1 lists the genes from HD MEL cells that are consistently and significantly (p < 0.05) up-regulated or down-regulated at more than one time point by treatment with each of the three chemicals. These genes were considered as candidates of differentiation-related genes. We considered that not all of differentiation-related genes were continuously up-regulated or down-regulated during differentiation. In MEL cells differentiation, c-Myc mRNA decreases at 2–12 h after DMSO treatment, but it increases to pretreatment levels at 18 h (41Lachman H.M. Skoultchi A.I. Expression of c-myc changes during differentiation of mouse erythroleukaemia cells.Nature. 1984; 310: 592-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar).TABLE 1Difference in gene expression between HD and LD MEL cells after drug treatmentExpression ratio (HD MEL cells/LD MEL cells)DMSOHMBATSAClone nameGene symbol6 h12 h24 h36 h6 h12 h24 h36 h6 h12 h24 h36 hH3038C06Zfp9510.480.380.390.240.420.530.420.250.620.640.480.45H3078E08unknown0.490.390.430.260.470.530.440.260.600.640.500.43H3049A07G430049J08Rik0.530.480.470.330.460.500.410.260.640.630.380.35H4070E06Unknown0.500.440.360.220.480.540.430.210.580.640.520.59H3062A11Clip20.590.460.510.330.450.510.470.290.760.690.460.41H4016D11Unknown0.590.550.460.340.550.610.490.270.600.590.460.49H3061H10Tmem1230.660.620.730.480.470.610.450.270.670.610.440.36H3104H09Spc240.600.500.510.480.490.560.550.350.640.700.540.50H3073G11Rtp30.620.580.630.390.490.660.480.280.770.630.480.51H3078A01G430049J08Rik0.620.560.680.380.560.580.530.280.660.650.530.56H3046C10Idi10.680.560.950.610.500.570.800.610.500.490.530.56H4046D12Plek0.590.580.840.630.520.460.760.440.530.570.680.86H3037D02G430049J08Rik0.740.900.620.620.750.600.550.450.660.660.490.51H3078G11Drd30.760.850.940.580.630.660.590.320.750.680.490.54H4019B10Fut80.780.650.810.370.630.580.620.310.600.660.870.95H3078G10Rtp30.780.790.810.590.680.750.720.310.690.720.570.56H4073E05Rnpc20.720.770.890.660.460.710.850.570.720.930.550.48H3033F11Cst30.650.830.800.600.630.650.660.650.650.730.750.78H4040B02Gstt30.760.901.180.470.800.700.670.480.980.660.590.59H3138C09Rnf1280.910.690.780.620.840.661.020.750.961.030.740.62H3032F06Hbb-y/Hbb-b10.610.690.790.920.570.681.141.540.620.600.690.96H4003H10Spn0.800.821.140.620.880.901.000.660.650.640.840.98H3113C01Hbb-y/Hbb-b10.690.590.871.070.680.751.391.590.600.680.860.96H3119H11Wdfy30.830.842.030.831.030.940.770.640.590.740.690.81H4020E10Il4ra0.950.890.900.601.061.001.000.540.881.171.331.66H3028F05Odc11.061.131.511.170.921.301.091.590.991.011.241.76H4062C02Mcm40.921.091.571.131.041.081.441.501.041.151.501.67H3024H12Hspa80.931.061.591.190.871.081.671.370.951.091.482.02H4006F09Hat11.120.941.681.271.081.121.691.381.011.551.301.61H3006C07Unknown1.231.241.501.161.241.651.371.570.961.061.391.80H4003E09Car21.051.151.631.341.011.081.821.650.870.901.792.19H3130A05Psmd21.261.201.671.441.191.171.851.501.271.111.482.10H3018A08Cct81.401.301.751.401.241.521.891.491.371.421.341.69"
https://openalex.org/W2048294710,"We study a simple traffic model with a non-signalized road intersection. In this model the car arriving from the right has precedence. The vehicle dynamics far from the crossing are governed by the rules introduced by Nagel and Paczuski, which define how drivers behave when braking or accelerating. We measure the average velocity of the ensemble of cars and its flow as a function of the density of cars on the roadway. An additional set of rules is defined to describe the dynamics at the intersection assuming a fraction of drivers that do not obey the rule of precedence. This problem is treated within a game-theory framework, where the drivers that obey the rule are cooperators and those who ignore it are defectors. We study the consequences of these behaviors as a function of the fraction of cooperators and defectors. The results show that cooperation is the best strategy because it maximizes the flow of vehicles and minimizes the number of accidents. A rather paradoxical effect is observed: for any percentage of defectors the number of accidents is larger when the density of cars is low because of the higher average velocity."
https://openalex.org/W2114960754,"Cellular cytotoxicity is the hallmark of NK cells mediating both elimination of virus-infected or malignant cells, and modulation of immune responses. NK cytotoxicity is triggered upon ligation of various activating NK cell receptors. Among these is the C-type lectin-like receptor NKp80 which is encoded in the human Natural Killer Gene Complex (NKC) adjacent to its ligand, activation-induced C-type lectin (AICL). NKp80-AICL interaction promotes cytolysis of malignant myeloid cells, but also stimulates the mutual crosstalk between NK cells and monocytes. While many activating NK cell receptors pair with ITAM-bearing adaptors, we recently reported that NKp80 signals via a hemITAM-like sequence in its cytoplasmic domain. Here we molecularly dissect the NKp80 hemITAM and demonstrate that two non-consensus amino acids, in particular arginine 6, critically impair both hemITAM phosphorylation and Syk recruitment. Impaired Syk recruitment results in a substantial attenuation of cytotoxic responses upon NKp80 ligation. Reconstituting the hemITAM consensus or Syk overexpression resulted in robust NKp80-mediated responsiveness. Collectively, our data provide a molecular rationale for the restrained activation potential of NKp80 and illustrate how subtle alterations in signaling motifs determine subsequent cellular responses. They also suggest that non-consensus alterations in the NKp80 hemITAM, as commonly present among mammalian NKp80 sequences, may have evolved to dampen NKp80-mediated cytotoxic responses toward AICL-expressing cells."

The strategy involves selected probes targeted to the filter gate of the channel aiming to modulate the probability of the channel being open assayed by single channel recordings from the sensorless pore module reconstituted in lipid bilayers. Here we show that the premature closing of the pore is bypassed by association of the filter gate with two novel open conformation stabilizers: an antidepressant and a peptide toxin known to act selectively on Kv channels.

The voltage sensor in voltage-dependent ion channels.Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 555-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). But how does the sensor achieve this? Pores of Kv channels have two gates: an “activation gate” facing the cytoplasm (8Liu Y. Holmgren M. Jurman M.E. Yellen G. Gated access to the pore of a voltage-dependent K+ channel.Neuron. 1997; 19: 175-184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar) and a filter gate facing the extracellular milieu (9Hoshi T.

For the onset of K+ current, both gates must be in a conductive conformation (12Hodgkin A.L. Huxley A.F. A quantitative description of membrane current and its application to conduction and excitation in nerve.J. Physiol. 1952; 117: 500-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (14327) Google Scholar). Functional and structural evidence has shown that opening of the activation gate in Kv channels is strongly coupled to sensor movement: in response to a change in potential, each of the sensors pries open the activation gate in the pore subunit to which it is covalently attached (6Long S.B.

Isacoff E. The cooperative voltage sensor motion that gates a potassium channel.J. Gen. Physiol. 2005; 125: 57-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In comparison, the mechanism by which the sensor controls the conformation of the filter gate remains less clear (15Loots E. Isacoff E.Y.

Banerjee A. MacKinnon R. Two separate interfaces between the voltage sensor and pore are required for the function of voltage-dependent K+ channels.PLoS Biol. 2009; 7: e47Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). An evolutionarily conserved interaction between an activated sensor in one subunit and the filter gate component in an adjacent subunit has been shown to stabilize the filter gate of Shaker, an archetype Kv channel, in a conductive conformation (18Lainé M. Lin M.C. Bannister J.P. Silverman W.R. Mock A.F. Roux B. Papazian D.M. Atomic proximity between S4 segment and pore domain in Shaker potassium channels.Neuron. 2003; 39: 467-481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). But despite the tugging and massaging by the sensor, the pores of many Kv channels still manage to close while the membrane potential is commanding the channels to be open. So, if the switch is on, why isn't the machine working? Clearly one or both of the gates of the channel have closed. Decades of investigation into the cause of this decay to a nonconductive conformation has shown that two mechanisms are at hand: a fast “N-type inactivation” resulting from a block of the channel from the cytoplasmic end (19Hoshi T. Zagotta W.N. Aldrich R.W. Biophysical and molecular mechanisms of Shaker potassium channel inactivation.Science. 1990; 250: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (1277) Google Scholar, 20Zagotta W.N. Hoshi T. Aldrich R. Restoration of inactivation in mutants of Shaker potassium channels by a peptide derived from ShB.Science. 1990; 250: 568-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar) and a slower “C-type inactivation” arising from a closing of the filter gate (9Hoshi T. Zagotta W.N. Aldrich R.W.

A gate in the selectivity filter of potassium channels.Structure. 2005; 13: 591-600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Based on this evidence, the filter gate was dubbed the “inactivation gate.” One salient early clue that the conductive conformation of the filter gate was unstable was the observation that some Kv channels resisted closing when the concentration of a permeant ion at the filter was increased (25Swenson Jr., R.P.

A currently held view on the universal nature of Kv channel C-type inactivation is that the propensity to inactivate is related to the stability of the inactivation gate and that this property is dependent on 1) a strong connectivity network underpinning the filter gate that serves to hold the K+ binding sites stable even when K+ is scarce and 2) prolonged permeant ion residence in the filter. Accordingly, gate and permeant ion assume a symbiotic relation that determines the stability of the conductive conformation of the pore (33Noskov S.Y. Bernèche S. Roux B. Control of ion selectivity in potassium channels by electrostatic and dynamic properties of carbonyl ligands.Nature. 2004; 431: 830-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Using KvLm (34Santos J.S. Lundby A. Zazueta C. Montal M. Molecular template for a voltage sensor in a novel K+ channel. I.

Conservation of a eukaryotic sensor fold in a prokaryotic K+ channel.J. Gen. Physiol. 2006; 128: 293-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), a bacterial Kv channel, as a test case, here we show three novel means by which the premature closure of the inactivation gate can be practically overridden. The three open gate stabilizers identified compensate the low open probability observed in the full-length Kv channel as well as in the KvLm pore only (5Santos J.S. Asmar-Rovira G.A. Han G.W. Liu W. Syeda R. Cherezov V. Baker K.A. Stevens R.C. Montal M. Crystal structure of a voltage-gated K+ channel pore module in a closed state in lipid membranes.J. Biol.

III. Functional reconstitution of a sensorless pore module from a prokaryotic Kv channel.J. Gen. Physiol. 2008; 132: 651-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The implication is that in KvLm low open probability is mostly a result of an unstable filter gate. Collectively, we demonstrate that a “rudimentary” sensor containing only three of eight conserved charges previously implicated in the maintenance of voltage sensor fold and voltage-dependent gating is sufficient to produce channel open probabilities higher than its fully endowed Kv channel relatives. KvLm pore module (PM), WT, and mutants as well as KvLm full length (FL) were expressed in Escherichia coli XL1-Blue with a C-terminal His tag and purified by Ni2+ affinity chromatography as described previously (36Santos J.S. Grigoriev S.M. Montal M. Molecular template for a voltage sensor in a novel K+ channel. III. Functional reconstitution of a sensorless pore module from a prokaryotic Kv channel.J. Gen. Physiol. 2008; 132: 651-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) except that all constructs were further purified by size exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 200 10/300 GL (GE Healthcare) column equilibrated with 200 mm KCl, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm n-dodecyl β-d-maltopyranoside. Single channel mutations were introduced using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To covalently attach fluorescein 5-maleimide to the E40C PM mutant, a 10-fold molar excess of fluorescein 5-maleimide (AnaSpec) was added to the protein immediately after elution from the Ni2+ affinity column and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C in the dark. The coupling reaction was stopped by the addition of a 100-fold molar excess of l-cysteine. The labeled protein was then passed twice through a PD-10 desalting column (GE Healthcare) to remove any uncoupled fluorescein 5-maleimide from the reaction. The fluorescein-labeled mutant was reconstituted immediately thereafter. Analysis by size exclusion chromatography of the PM E40C-fluorescein maleimide complex showed that the labeled PM eluted from size exclusion chromatography at the same elution volume (±0.1 ml) as the unlabeled protein, suggesting that the labeling did not change the oligomeric state of the protein. In addition, the labeled protein migrates on an SDS-PAGE gel as a tetramer as does the WT (36Santos J.S. Grigoriev S.M. Montal M. Molecular template for a voltage sensor in a novel K+ channel. III. Functional reconstitution of a sensorless pore module from a prokaryotic Kv channel.J. Gen. Physiol. 2008; 132: 651-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Calculation of the protein (A280, ϵ = 16,960 m−1 cm−1) and fluorescein dye (A500, ϵ = 68,000 m−1 cm−1) concentrations suggests that on average only one subunit in the tetrameric channel was labeled. Liposomes were composed of 90% (mol %) 1,2-diphytanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPhPC) and 10% negatively charged lipid 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidic acid (DOPA) (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL). Liposomes were prepared as described previously (37Syeda R. Santos J.S. Montal M. Bayley H. Tetrameric assembly of KvLm K+ channels with defined numbers of voltage sensors.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2012; 109: 16917-16922Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). For reconstitution, the protein was diluted ∼100–300-fold into preformed liposomes to give a final protein concentration of 2–5 μg/ml. The proteoliposomes were incubated on ice for 15 min prior to bilayer recording experiments. Fresh aliquots of liposomes and protein were used for every experiment. Single channel currents were recorded from droplet interface bilayers as described (5Santos J.S. Asmar-Rovira G.A. Han G.W. Liu W. Syeda R. Cherezov V. Baker K.A. Stevens R.C. Montal M.

Briefly, a 10 × 10 × 4-mm plexiglass chamber was filled with hexadecane (Sigma-Aldrich) containing 1% DPhPC. A 0.2-mm-diameter Ag/AgCl wire electrode (30–40 mm in length) was attached to each of two micromanipulators (NMN-21, Narishige, London, UK). Droplets (∼200 nl) were placed with a pipette on each of the electrodes, which had been coated with 3% (w/v) low melt agarose (65 °C). The electrode carrying the droplet with the proteoliposomes in 0.5 m KCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4 was connected to the grounded end (cis side) of the amplifier headstage. The second electrode in a droplet containing liposomes in the same buffer was connected to the working end of the headstage (trans side). The chamber, electrodes, and amplifier headstage were enclosed in a Faraday cage. The droplets were incubated in hexadecane containing 1% DPhPC until a monolayer of lipid had formed around them (∼5 min). A bilayer spontaneously formed when the two droplets were brought into contact. All the electrical measurements were performed at 22 ± 2 °C in 0.5 m KCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4 at +150 mV unless otherwise indicated. Tetrabutylammonium (TBA) ion (5 mm) and imipramine (100 μm) stocks were made in droplet solution (0.5 m KCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) and injected according to the requirement of experiments to final concentrations of 50 and 5 μm, respectively, using a Nano injector (VWR International). Charybdotoxin stock (50 μm) was made in 50 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4 and injected to a final concentration of 1 μm. Alternatively, charybdotoxin (CTX) and imipramine were preincubated with proteoliposomes (∼15 min) to final concentrations of 1 and 5 μm, respectively, extruded nine times through a 0.1-mm filter (Mini Extruder) prior to droplet formation to ensure homogenous mixing and accessibility of CTX and imipramine to the reconstituted protein. Both methods of introducing CTX and imipramine produced the same results. Iminodibenzyl (in chloroform) was mixed with 10% DOPA, 90% DPhPC (in chloroform). The mixture was dried under a stream of nitrogen and rehydrated in 0.5 m KCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. Liposomes containing iminodibenzyl (5 μm) were extruded prior to protein reconstitution. Single channel currents were sampled at 20 kHz using an Axon 200B patch clamp amplifier, filtered by using a low pass Bessel filter (80 db/decade) with a corner frequency of 2 kHz, and then digitized with a DigiData 1320 A/D converter (Axon Instruments). All preprocessing and analysis of the single channel records was performed with QuB software. Records of PM and FL in the presence of imipramine or CTX were further filtered to 200–500 Hz. Event detection was performed by time course fitting with the segmental k-means algorithm (38Qin F. Restoration of single-channel currents using the segmental k-means method based on hidden Markov modeling.Biophys. J. 2004; 86: 1488-1501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). To avoid the detection of erroneous events, the receiver dead time (td) was set at 300 μs for all records except for PM and FL in the presence of imipramine or CTX; in the indicated cases, td was set to 1000–2000 μs. Therefore, transitions shorter than td were ignored; transitions longer than td were accepted as “events.” Single channel conductance was calculated from Gaussian fits to current histograms. Statistical values represent means ± S.E. n and N denote the number of experiments and number of events, respectively. Docking of the ligands imipramine and iminodibenzyl onto the receptor KvLm PM (Protein Data Bank codes 4H33 and 4H37) was performed by AutoDock 4.2 (39Morris G.M. Huey R. Lindstrom W. Sanner M.F. Belew R.K. Goodsell D.S. Olson A.J. AutoDock4 and AutoDockTools4: automated docking with selective receptor flexibility.J. Comput. Chem. 2009; 30: 2785-2791Crossref PubMed Scopus (13691) Google Scholar) using the default docking parameters supplied with AutoDock in the “examples” subdirectory, and point charges were assigned according to the AMBER03 force field (40Duan Y. Wu C. Chowdhury S. Lee M.C. Xiong G. Zhang W. Yang R. Cieplak P. Luo R. Lee T. Caldwell J. Wang J. Kollman P. A point-charge force field for molecular mechanics simulations of proteins based on condensed-phase quantum mechanical calculations.J. Comput. Chem. 2003; 24: 1999-2012Crossref PubMed Scopus (3737) Google Scholar) in YASARA (Yasara Biosciences GmbH, Austria). Receptor flexibility is considered by creating a receptor ensemble with five receptor conformations with alternative high scoring solutions of the side-chain rotamer network. Conservation of 4-fold (Protein Data Bank code 4H33) or 2-fold (Protein Data Bank code 4H37) symmetry was not imposed for the ensemble receptor structures. Ligand is allowed full flexibility. Each docking experiment consisted of 500 ligand to receptor docking runs (100 runs per receptor conformation). Docking results usually cluster around certain hot spot conformations, and the complex with the lowest free energy of binding (strongest interaction) in each cluster is saved. The more negative the free energy of binding, the stronger the interaction between ligand and receptor. Importantly, these energies are potential force field energies, and therefore the results cannot be quantitatively compared with experimentally measured free energies of binding. Therefore, these potential force energy values can only be used for comparative evaluation of binding energies calculated under the same force field. Two complexes belong to different clusters if the ligand heavy atom root mean square deviation is larger than 5 Å. All docking experiments were performed at 298 K. Scoring of each receptor-ligand ensemble was performed by AutoDock. The docking surface on the receptor was limited to the extracellularly facing side of the PM. To test the dependence of the docking interaction on the occupancy of the filter gate by K+, replica docking was tested with three K+ ions at ion binding positions S2, S3, and S4 in the filter as seen in Protein Data Bank code 4H33, four K+ ions at positions S1, S2, S3, and S4 as seen in Protein Data Bank code 4H37, and five K+ ions at positions S0, S1, S2, S3, and S4 in the selectivity filter. To generate the five-K+ structure, the structure of KcsA (Protein Data Bank code 1K4C (41Zhou Y. Morais-Cabral J.H. Kaufman A. MacKinnon R. Chemistry of ion coordination and hydration revealed by a K+ channel-Fab complex at 2.0 Å resolution.Nature. 2001; 414: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (1733) Google Scholar)) was aligned with that of KvLm PM with four K+ ions at the filter, and the ion at S0 in Protein Data Bank code 1K4C was transferred to the KvLm structure.

The starting complex was generated by aligning the KvLm PM structure with that of a KcsA mutant in a complex with CTX (Protein Data Bank code 2A9H (42Yu L. Sun C. Song D. Shen J. Xu N. Nuclear magnetic resonance structural studies of a potassium channel-charybdotoxin complex.Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 15834-15841Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar)) and transferring the CTX protein to the KvLm PM. The RosettaDock server performs a local docking search starting with the initial complex in which both ligand and receptor are allowed some flexibility. In detail, the local perturbation of RosettaDock includes ∼±3 Å in the direction between the two proteins, ∼8 Å in the directions sliding the proteins relative to each other along their surfaces, ∼8° of tilt of the proteins, and a complete 360° spin around the axis between the centers of the two proteins. The server performs 1000 independent simulations from this range of random positions and returns the 10 best scoring complex structures ordered by energy. The two complex structural models shown (see Fig. 3, D and E) correspond to the highest scoring (Fig. 3D) and the fifth highest scoring (Fig. 3E) complex models. Noticeably in nine of 10 top scoring models, Glu-40 came within 4 Å of a lysine residue in CTX. These nine models fall into two distinct groups: one in which the lysine of CTX inserts into the filter (similar to Fig. 3E) and another where the lysine hovering over the filter bends to contact the Glu-40 side chain (similar to Fig. 3D). As a control experiment, the docking experiment was repeated using the KvLm PM mutant E4"
https://openalex.org/W2091445783,"FoxD4L1 is a forkhead transcription factor that expands the neural ectoderm by down-regulating genes that promote the onset of neural differentiation and up-regulating genes that maintain proliferative neural precursors in an immature state. We previously demonstrated that binding of Grg4 to an Eh-1 motif enhances the ability of FoxD4L1 to down-regulate target neural genes but does not account for all of its repressive activity. Herein we analyzed the protein sequence for additional interaction motifs and secondary structure. Eight conserved motifs were identified in the C-terminal region of fish and frog proteins. Extending the analysis to mammals identified a high scoring motif downstream of the Eh-1 domain that contains a tryptophan residue implicated in protein-protein interactions. In addition, secondary structure prediction programs predicted an α-helical structure overlapping with amphibian-specific Motif 6 in Xenopus, and similarly located α-helical structures in other vertebrate FoxD proteins. We tested functionality of this site by inducing a glutamine-to-proline substitution expected to break the predicted α-helical structure; this significantly reduced FoxD4L1's ability to repress zic3 and irx1. Because this mutation does not interfere with Grg4 binding, these results demonstrate that at least two regions, the Eh-1 motif and a more C-terminal predicted α-helical/Motif 6 site, additively contribute to repression. In the N-terminal region we previously identified a 14 amino acid motif that is required for the up-regulation of target genes. Secondary structure prediction programs predicted a short β-strand separating two acidic domains. Mutant constructs show that the β-strand itself is not required for transcriptional activation. Instead, activation depends upon a glycine residue that is predicted to provide sufficient flexibility to bring the two acidic domains into close proximity. These results identify conserved predicted motifs with secondary structures that enable FoxD4L1 to carry out its essential functions as both a transcriptional repressor and activator of neural genes."
https://openalex.org/W1987549181,"Intra-uterine growth restriction (IUGR) has been associated with increased predisposition to age-related complications. We tested the hypothesis that rat offspring models of IUGR would exhibit exacerbated, age-related retinal dysfunction.Female Sprague-Dawley rats (maintained at 11.5% O2 from gestational day 15 to 21 to induce IUGR) and control offspring (maintained at 21% O2 throughout pregnancy) had retinal function assessed at 2 months (young) and 14 months of age (aged) with electroretinogram (ERG) recordings. Retinal anatomy was assessed by immunofluorescence.Deficits in rod-driven retina function were observed in aged IUGR offspring, as evidenced by reduced amplitudes of dark-adapted mixed a-wave V(max) (by 49.3%, P < 0.01), b-wave V(max) (by 42.1%, P < 0.001) and dark-adapted peak oscillatory potentials (by 42.3%, P < 0.01). In contrast to the rod-driven defects specific to aged IUGR offspring, light adapted ERG recordings revealed cone defects in young animals, that were stationary until old age. At 2 months, IUGR offspring had amplitude reductions for both b-wave (V(max) by 46%, P < 0.01) and peak oscillatory potential (V(max) by 38%, P < 0.05). Finally, defects in cone-driven responses were further confirmed by reduced maximal photopic flicker amplitudes at 2 (by 42%, P < 0.001) and 14 months (by 34%, P = 0.06) and critical flicker fusion frequencies at 14 months (42 ± 1 Hz, IUGR: 35 ± 2 Hz, P < 0.05). These functional changes were not paralleled by anatomical losses in IUGR offspring retinas.These data support that the developing retina is sensitive to stressors, and that pathways governing cone- and rod-driven function differ in their susceptibilities. In the case of prenatal hypoxia, cone- and rod-driven dysfunction manifest at young and old ages, respectively. We must, therefore, take into account the specific impact that fetal programming might exert on age-related retinal dystrophies when considering related diagnoses and therapeutic applications."
https://openalex.org/W1965352336,"Activating mutations in the αC-β4 loop of the ERBB2 kinase domain, such as ERBB2(YVMA) and ERBB2(G776VC), have been identified in human lung cancers and found to drive tumor formation. Here we observe that the docking protein GAB1 is hyper-phosphorylated in carcinomas from transgenic mice and in cell lines expressing these ERBB2 cancer mutants. Using dominant negative GAB1 mutants lacking canonical tyrosine residues for SHP2 and PI3K interactions or lentiviral shRNA that targets GAB1, we demonstrate that GAB1 phosphorylation is required for ERBB2 mutant-induced cell signaling, cell transformation, and tumorigenesis. An enzyme kinetic analysis comparing ERBB2(YVMA) to wild type using physiologically relevant peptide substrates reveals that ERBB2(YVMA) kinase adopts a striking preference for GAB1 phosphorylation sites as evidenced by ∼150-fold increases in the specificity constants (kcat/Km) for several GAB1 peptides, and this change in substrate selectivity was predominantly attributed to the peptide binding affinities as reflected by the apparent Km values. Furthermore, we demonstrate that ERBB2(YVMA) phosphorylates GAB1 protein ∼70-fold faster than wild type ERBB2 in vitro. Notably, the mutation does not significantly alter the Km for ATP or sensitivity to lapatinib, suggesting that, unlike EGFR lung cancer mutants, the ATP binding cleft of the kinase is not significantly changed. Taken together, our results indicate that the acquired substrate preference for GAB1 is critical for the ERBB2 mutant-induced oncogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2145107804,"Human ether-á-gogo-related gene (HERG) encodes a potassium channel that is highly susceptible to deleterious mutations resulting in susceptibility to fatal cardiac arrhythmias. Most mutations adversely affect HERG channel assembly and trafficking. Why the channel is so vulnerable to missense mutations is not well understood. Since nothing is known of how mRNA structural elements factor in channel processing, we synthesized a codon-modified HERG cDNA (HERG-CM) where the codons were synonymously changed to reduce GC content, secondary structure, and rare codon usage. HERG-CM produced typical IKr-like currents; however, channel synthesis and processing were markedly different. Translation efficiency was reduced for HERG-CM, as determined by heterologous expression, in vitro translation, and polysomal profiling. Trafficking efficiency to the cell surface was greatly enhanced, as assayed by immunofluorescence, subcellular fractionation, and surface labeling. Chimeras of HERG-NT/CM indicated that trafficking efficiency was largely dependent on 5' sequences, while translation efficiency involved multiple areas. These results suggest that HERG translation and trafficking rates are independently governed by noncoding information in various regions of the mRNA molecule. Noncoding information embedded within the mRNA may play a role in the pathogenesis of hereditary arrhythmia syndromes and could provide an avenue for targeted therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W2031478639,"Background Mothers delivering as private patients in Australia have a high rate of assisted deliveries, which could lead to adverse infant outcomes in this group of patients. We investigated whether the risk of adverse infant outcomes after assisted deliveries was different for mothers admitted as public or private patients for delivery, when compared with unassisted deliveries. Methods and findings We included 158,241 vaginal, singleton, term birth admissions in our study where the infant was live born and without birth defects. The study population was identified from statutory birth and hospital data collections held by the Western Australian (WA) Department of Health. We estimated odds ratios and confidence intervals using logistic regression models adjusted for a range of maternal demographic, pregnancy and birth characteristics. Interaction was assessed by including interaction terms in the models. Outcomes included low Apgar scores at five minutes (<7), neonatal resuscitation and special care admission. Mothers delivering as private patients had an increased risk of assisted vaginal delivery compared with public patients (adjusted OR 1.74, 95% CI = 1.68–1.80). Compared with unassisted vaginal deliveries, assisted deliveries were associated with increased risk of Apgar scores at five minutes below 7 (OR 1.25, 1.08–1.45), neonatal resuscitation (OR = 1.69, 1.42–2.00) and admission to special care nursery (OR = 1.64, 1.53–1.76). The increased risk of neonatal resuscitation was higher for mothers admitted as private patients for delivery (OR = 2.13) than public patients (OR = 1.55, pinteraction = 0.03). Conclusions Our results suggested that the high risk of neonatal resuscitation following assisted vaginal deliveries compared to unassisted is higher in private patients than public patients. Whether this phenomenon is due to the twofold higher rate of assisted vaginal deliveries in this group of patients or a higher rate of fetal indications for assisted vaginal delivery remains to be answered."
