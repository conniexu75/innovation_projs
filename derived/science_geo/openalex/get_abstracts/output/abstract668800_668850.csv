https://openalex.org/W3132841322,"Ipilimumab improves clinical outcomes when combined with nivolumab in metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), but its efficacy and impact on the immune microenvironment in operable NSCLC remain unclear. We report the results of the phase 2 randomized NEOSTAR trial (NCT03158129) of neoadjuvant nivolumab or nivolumab + ipilimumab followed by surgery in 44 patients with operable NSCLC, using major pathologic response (MPR) as the primary endpoint. The MPR rate for each treatment arm was tested against historical controls of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The nivolumab + ipilimumab arm met the prespecified primary endpoint threshold of 6 MPRs in 21 patients, achieving a 38% MPR rate (8/21). We observed a 22% MPR rate (5/23) in the nivolumab arm. In 37 patients resected on trial, nivolumab and nivolumab + ipilimumab produced MPR rates of 24% (5/21) and 50% (8/16), respectively. Compared with nivolumab, nivolumab + ipilimumab resulted in higher pathologic complete response rates (10% versus 38%), less viable tumor (median 50% versus 9%), and greater frequencies of effector, tissue-resident memory and effector memory T cells. Increased abundance of gut Ruminococcus and Akkermansia spp. was associated with MPR to dual therapy. Our data indicate that neoadjuvant nivolumab + ipilimumab-based therapy enhances pathologic responses, tumor immune infiltrates and immunologic memory, and merits further investigation in operable NSCLC. Neoadjuvant treatment with nivolumab plus ipilimumab is well tolerated and demonstrates clinical efficacy in patients with early stage lung cancer."
https://openalex.org/W3130819465,"The arrangement (syntax) of transcription factor (TF) binding motifs is an important part of the cis-regulatory code, yet remains elusive. We introduce a deep learning model, BPNet, that uses DNA sequence to predict base-resolution chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)–nexus binding profiles of pluripotency TFs. We develop interpretation tools to learn predictive motif representations and identify soft syntax rules for cooperative TF binding interactions. Strikingly, Nanog preferentially binds with helical periodicity, and TFs often cooperate in a directional manner, which we validate using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-induced point mutations. Our model represents a powerful general approach to uncover the motifs and syntax of cis-regulatory sequences in genomics data. BPNet is an interpretable deep learning tool that predicts transcription-factor binding profiles from DNA sequence at base-pair resolution, enabling the identification of motifs and the regulatory syntax underlying transcription-factor binding."
https://openalex.org/W3130987271,"The majority of the brain's vasculature is composed of intricate capillary networks lined by capillary pericytes. However, it remains unclear whether capillary pericytes influence blood flow. Using two-photon microscopy to observe and manipulate brain capillary pericytes in vivo, we find that their optogenetic stimulation decreases lumen diameter and blood flow, but with slower kinetics than similar stimulation of mural cells on upstream pial and precapillary arterioles. This slow vasoconstriction was inhibited by the clinically used vasodilator fasudil, a Rho-kinase inhibitor that blocks contractile machinery. Capillary pericytes were also slower to constrict back to baseline following hypercapnia-induced dilation, and slower to dilate towards baseline following optogenetically induced vasoconstriction. Optical ablation of single capillary pericytes led to sustained local dilation and a doubling of blood cell flux selectively in capillaries lacking pericyte contact. These data indicate that capillary pericytes contribute to basal blood flow resistance and slow modulation of blood flow throughout the brain."

https://openalex.org/W3131308100,"The genus Orthonairovirus, which is part of the family Nairoviridae, includes the important tick-transmitted pathogens Crimean–Congo hemorrhagic fever virus and Nairobi sheep disease virus, as well as many other poorly characterized viruses found in ticks, birds and mammals1,2. In this study, we identified a new orthonairovirus, Songling virus (SGLV), from patients who reported being bitten by ticks in Heilongjiang Province in northeastern China. SGLV shared similar genomic and morphological features with orthonairoviruses and phylogenetically formed a unique clade in Tamdy orthonairovirus of the Nairoviridae family. The isolated SGLV induced cytopathic effects in human hepatoma cells in vitro. SGLV infection was confirmed in 42 hospitalized patients analyzed between 2017 and 2018, with the main clinical manifestations being headache, fever, depression, fatigue and dizziness. More than two-thirds (69%) of patients generated virus-specific antibody responses in the acute phase. Taken together, these results suggest that this newly discovered orthonairovirus is associated with human febrile illness in China. Songling virus is a newly discovered orthonairovirus found in the blood of patients hospitalized with febrile illness and having a history of tick bites."
https://openalex.org/W3131822672,"Pancreatic islet β-cell dysfunction is characterized by defective glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) and is a predominant component of the pathophysiology of diabetes. Imeglimin, a novel first-in-class small molecule tetrahydrotriazine drug candidate, improves glycemia and GSIS in preclinical models and clinical trials in patients with Type 2 diabetes; however, the mechanism by which it restores β-cell function is unknown. Here, we show that imeglimin acutely and directly amplifies GSIS in islets isolated from rodents with Type 2 diabetes via a mode of action that is distinct from other known therapeutic approaches. The underlying mechanism involves increases in the cellular nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD + ) pool—potentially via the salvage pathway and induction of nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) along with augmentation of glucose-induced ATP levels. Further, additional results suggest that NAD + conversion to a second messenger, cyclic ADP ribose (cADPR), via ADP ribosyl cyclase/cADPR hydrolase (CD38) is required for imeglimin’s effects in islets, thus representing a potential link between increased NAD + and enhanced glucose-induced Ca 2+ mobilization which—in turn—is known to drive insulin granule exocytosis. Collectively, these findings implicate a novel mode of action for imeglimin that explains its ability to effectively restore—β-cell function and provides for a new approach to treat patients suffering from Type 2 diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W3131280372,"The transmission dynamics of the coronavirus—COVID-19—have challenged humankind at almost every level. Currently, research groups around the globe are trying to figure out such transmission dynamics under special conditions such as separation policies enforced by governments. Mathematical and computational models, like the compartmental model or the agent-based model, are being used for this purpose. This paper proposes an agent-based model, called INFEKTA, for simulating the transmission of infectious diseases, not only the COVID-19, under social distancing policies. INFEKTA combines the transmission dynamic of a specific disease, (according to parameters found in the literature) with demographic information (population density, age, and genre of individuals) of geopolitical regions of the real town or city under study. Agents (virtual persons) can move, according to its mobility routines and the enforced social distancing policy, on a complex network of accessible places defined over an Euclidean space representing the town or city. The transmission dynamics of the COVID-19 under different social distancing policies in Bogotá city, the capital of Colombia, is simulated using INFEKTA with one million virtual persons. A sensitivity analysis of the impact of social distancing policies indicates that it is possible to establish a ‘medium’ (i.e., close 40% of the places) social distancing policy to achieve a significant reduction in the disease transmission."
https://openalex.org/W3131670761,"By investigating the topology of neuronal co-activity, we found that mnemonic information spans multiple operational axes in the mouse hippocampus network. High-activity principal cells form the core of each memory along a first axis, segregating spatial contexts and novelty. Low-activity cells join co-activity motifs across behavioral events and enable their crosstalk along two other axes. This reveals an organizational principle for continuous integration and interaction of hippocampal memories. Gava et al. explore the organization of neuronal co-activity in hippocampus from a graph theoretical perspective to report how new associative memories integrate into the network and restructure the neural patterns representing prior memories."
https://openalex.org/W3132014097,"Low statistical power reduces the reliability of animal research; yet, increasing sample sizes to increase statistical power is problematic for both ethical and practical reasons. We present an alternative solution using Bayesian priors based on historical control data, which capitalizes on the observation that control groups in general are expected to be similar to each other. In a simulation study, we show that including data from control groups of previous studies could halve the minimum sample size required to reach the canonical 80% power or increase power when using the same number of animals. We validated the approach on a dataset based on seven independent rodent studies on the cognitive effects of early-life adversity. We present an open-source tool, RePAIR, that can be widely used to apply this approach and increase statistical power, thereby improving the reliability of animal experiments."
https://openalex.org/W3129215771,"We suggest a novel mathematical framework for the in-homogeneous spatial spreading of an infectious disease in human population, with particular attention to COVID-19. Common epidemiological models, e.g., the well-known susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) model, implicitly assume uniform (random) encounters between the infectious and susceptible sub-populations, resulting in homogeneous spatial distributions. However, in human population, especially under different levels of mobility restrictions, this assumption is likely to fail. Splitting the geographic region under study into areal nodes, and assuming infection kinetics within nodes and between nearest-neighbor nodes, we arrive into a continuous, “reaction-diffusion”, spatial model. To account for COVID-19, the model includes five different sub-populations, in which the infectious sub-population is split into pre-symptomatic and symptomatic. Our model accounts for the spreading evolution of infectious population domains from initial epicenters, leading to different regimes of sub-exponential (e.g., power-law) growth. Importantly, we also account for the variable geographic density of the population, that can strongly enhance or suppress infection spreading. For instance, we show how weakly infected regions surrounding a densely populated area can cause rapid migration of the infection towards the populated area. Predicted infection “heat-maps” show remarkable similarity to publicly available heat-maps, e.g., from South Carolina. We further demonstrate how localized lockdown/quarantine conditions can slow down the spreading of disease from epicenters. Application of our model in different countries can provide a useful predictive tool for the authorities, in particular, for planning strong lockdown measures in localized areas—such as those underway in a few countries."
https://openalex.org/W3132119234,"Around 30% of global food is produced by smallholder farmers, yet they constitute the most food-insecure group. In Mexico, food self-sufficiency is declining. Rural policies in the country have stimulated the production of cash crops to the detriment of the traditional intercropping system, the milpa . Such a decline may have negative consequences for the food security of subsistence farmers. This study aimed to assess changes in nutritional self-sufficiency over the last 30 years and the role of milpa systems in food security for two communities in the highlands of Oaxaca, Mexico. The study used satellite images, censuses, and field data to estimate food production. Three cropping systems, monoculture of maize, monoculture of common bean, and the milpa were compared in terms of nutrients and vitamins produced. Furthermore, a household typology was developed for each community to contrast nutritional self-sufficiency levels between the different household types. Results showed that the milpa produced more volume of food per area compared to the other systems. The milpa also produced all the nutrients and vitamins (except for B12) required to feed at least 2 persons ha -1 . Monocultures of maize lacked vitamins A, B9, B12, and C, and the common bean lacked vitamins A, B12, and C. While farmers recognized the importance of the milpa , they preferred monocultures due to the reduced labor demands of this system. Households that obtained most of their income from off-farm activities had the lowest nutritional self-sufficiency. Enhancing nutritional self-sufficiency through crop diversification has the potential to not only improve the nutrition of subsistence farmers, but also to enhance ecosystem service provision, promote biodiversity conservation and restoration, and improve resilience to climate change."
https://openalex.org/W3133251527,"This study evaluated the effects of treatment with meloxicam (a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug), parity, and blood progesterone concentration on the dynamics of the uterine microbiota of 16 clinically healthy postpartum dairy cows. Seven primiparous and 9 multiparous postpartum Holstein cows either received meloxicam (0.5 mg/kg SC, n = 7 cows) once daily for 4 days (10 to 13 days in milk (DIM)) or were untreated (n = 9 cows). Endometrial cytology samples were collected by cytobrush at 10, 21, and 35 DIM, from which the microbiota analysis was conducted using 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. A radioimmunoassay was used to measure progesterone concentration in blood serum samples at 35 DIM and cows were classified as ˃ 1 ng/mL (n = 10) or ≤ 1 ng/mL (n = 6). Alpha diversity for bacterial genera (Chao1, Shannon-Weiner, and Camargo’s evenness indices) were not affected by DIM, meloxicam treatment, parity, or progesterone category. For beta diversity (genera level), principal coordinate analysis (Bray-Curtis) showed differences in microbiota between parity groups. At the phylum level, the relative abundance of Actinobacteria was greater in primiparous than multiparous cows. At the genus level, there was lesser relative abundance of Bifidobacterium , Lactobacillus , Neisseriaceae , Paracoccus , Staphylococcus , and Streptococcus and greater relative abundance of Bacillus and Fusobacterium in primiparous than multiparous cows. Bray-Curtis dissimilarity did not differ by DIM at sampling, meloxicam treatment, or progesterone category at 35 DIM. In conclusion, uterine bacterial composition was not different at 10, 21, or 35 DIM, and meloxicam treatment or progesterone category did not affect the uterine microbiota in clinically healthy postpartum dairy cows. Primiparous cows presented a different composition of uterine bacteria than multiparous cows. The differences in microbiota associated with parity might be attributable to changes that occur consequent to the first calving, but this hypothesis should be investigated further."
https://openalex.org/W3130566847,"Background Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is currently a global health threat and public health emergency of international concern. Africa is the last continent to be hit by this pandemic and the population is still prone to misconceptions and may not take it seriously. In developing countries including Ethiopia, where trained human resources and equipment for the treatment of COVID-19 are scarce, working on prevention of the viral spread should be a priority as a feasible intervention strategy. The aim of this study was to determine the level of knowledge, attitude, practice (KAP) towards COVID-19 and its prevalence among hospital visitors. Methods Health institution based cross sectional study was conducted among 513 hospital visitors who are recruited by using simple random sampling technique at Ataye district hospital, Northeast Ethiopia from June 3, 2020 to August 10, 2020. A pre-tested structured questionnaire was used to obtain information related to socio-demographic characteristics, knowledge (11 questions), attitude (9 questions) and practice (9 questions). Oro-pharyngeal specimen was collected by trained healthcare provider and processed in a molecular laboratory. After extraction of viral nucleic acid, the Real-time fluorescent polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) kit was used for detecting novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Data was analyzed using bi-variable and multivariable logistic regression model with 95% CI (confidence interval). From the bi-variable analysis, variables having a P -value &lt;0.25 were retained into multivariable analysis. From the multivariable analysis, variables with a P-value &lt;0.05 was declared as associated factors. Results Majority (72.9%) of the study participants were male; and most were urban dwellers. From the total study participants, 17 (3.3%) were found to be infected with the virus. The magnitude of low-level of knowledge was 4.9%; and of the analyzed risk factors, female gender, age (category less than 16 years and category between 16 and 65 years), and usual alcohol drinking habit had statistically significant association with low level knowledge. The proportion of study participants who had low level of practice was 75/513 (14.62%). Family size, age category between 16 and 65 years, and low-level knowledge were associated with low-level practice. Conclusion Limited number of study participants had high-level knowledge and practice towards COVID-19; while majority of the study candidates demonstrated moderate level of knowledge and practice. Good knowledge, positive attitude and good practice can be a guarantee for the prevention and control of COVID-19. Hence, various measurements to combat the pandemic should be taken by different stakeholders including the community members, religious leader, health professionals and others."
https://openalex.org/W3130798668,"The degree that maternal glycemia affects placental metabolism of trophoblast cell types [cytotrophoblast (CTB) and syncytiotrophoblast (SCT)] in pregnant persons with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is unknown. We tested the hypotheses that (a) hyperglycemia suppresses the metabolic rates of CTB and SCT; and (b) low placental metabolic activity from GDM placentas is due to decreased oxygen consumption of CTB. Trophoblast cells isolated from GDM and non-GDM term placentas were cultured for 8-hour (CTB) and following syncytialization at 72-hour (SCT) in 5 mM of glucose or 25 mM of glucose. Oxygen consumption rates, glycolysis, ATP levels, and lipid droplet morphometries were determined in CTB and SCT. In CTB from GDM placentas compared to control CTB: (a) oxidative phosphorylation was decreased by 44% (41.8 vs 74.2 pmol O2/min/100 ng DNA, P = .002); (b) ATP content was 39% lower (1.1 × 10−7 vs 1.8 × 10−7 nM/ng DNA, P = .046); and (c) lipid droplets were two times larger (31.0 vs 14.4 µm2/cell, P < .001) and 1.7 times more numerous (13.5 vs 7.9 lipid droplets/cell, P < .001). Hyperglycemia suppressed CTB glycolysis by 55%-60% (mean difference 20.4 [GDM, P = .008] and 15.4 [non-GDM, P = .029] mpH/min/100 ng DNA). GDM SCT was not metabolically different from non-GDM SCT. However, GDM SCT had significantly decreased expression of genes associated with differentiation including hCG, GCM1, and syncytin-1. We conclude that suppressed metabolic activity by the GDM placenta is attributable to metabolic dysfunction of CTB, not SCT. Critical placental hormone expression and secretion are decreased in GDM trophoblasts."

https://openalex.org/W3130187639,"The rate of climate change (CC) has accelerated to the point where it now affects the mid- to long-term sustainability of fishing strategies. Therefore, it is important to consider practical and effective ways to incorporate CC into fisheries advice so that the advice can be considered conditioned to CC. We developed a model to characterise the empirical relationship between a variable affected by climate and fish production. We then used model projections as a foundation for a risk analysis of CC effects on harvesting of Greenland halibut Reinhardtius hippoglossoides in the Gulf of St Lawrence, Canada. The risk-based approach quantified a) the relative change in risk of a status quo fishing strategy under various CC scenarios, and b) the change in fishery exploitation rates required to achieve a management objective over a specified time period at a level of risk considered acceptable (risk equivalent fishery exploitation advice). This empirical approach can be used to develop risk-based advice for any other external variable that affects stock production in addition to climate-related variables and it can be applied in most situations where there is an index of stock biomass and fisheries catch. Shifting the focus from process-based understanding of the responses of fish stocks to CC to quantification of how CC-contributed uncertainty can alter the risks associated with different fishing strategies and/or management options, can ensure timely delivery of robust scientific advice for fisheries under non-stationary environmental conditions."
https://openalex.org/W3132688716,"Emphysema, a component of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), is characterized by irreversible alveolar destruction that results in a progressive decline in lung function. This alveolar destruction is caused by cigarette smoke, the most important risk factor for COPD. Only 15%-20% of smokers develop COPD, suggesting that unknown factors contribute to disease pathogenesis. We postulate that the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), a receptor/transcription factor highly expressed in the lungs, may be a new susceptibility factor whose expression protects against COPD. Here, we report that Ahr-deficient mice chronically exposed to cigarette smoke develop airspace enlargement concomitant with a decline in lung function. Chronic cigarette smoke exposure also increased cleaved caspase-3, lowered SOD2 expression, and altered MMP9 and TIMP-1 levels in Ahr-deficient mice. We also show that people with COPD have reduced expression of pulmonary and systemic AHR, with systemic AHR mRNA levels positively correlating with lung function. Systemic AHR was also lower in never-smokers with COPD. Thus, AHR expression protects against the development of COPD by controlling interrelated mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of this disease. This study identifies the AHR as a new, central player in the homeostatic maintenance of lung health, providing a foundation for the AHR as a novel therapeutic target and/or predictive biomarker in chronic lung disease."
https://openalex.org/W3130195972,"Rapid cellular responses to environmental stimuli are fundamental for development and maturation. Immediate early genes can be transcriptionally induced within minutes in response to a variety of signals. How their induction levels are regulated and their untimely activation by spurious signals prevented during development is poorly understood. We found that in developing sensory neurons, before perinatal sensory-activity-dependent induction, immediate early genes are embedded into a unique bipartite Polycomb chromatin signature, carrying active H3K27ac on promoters but repressive Ezh2-dependent H3K27me3 on gene bodies. This bipartite signature is widely present in developing cell types, including embryonic stem cells. Polycomb marking of gene bodies inhibits mRNA elongation, dampening productive transcription, while still allowing for fast stimulus-dependent mark removal and bipartite gene induction. We reveal a developmental epigenetic mechanism regulating the rapidity and amplitude of the transcriptional response to relevant stimuli, while preventing inappropriate activation of stimulus-response genes. Immediate early genes in developing sensory neurons have a unique bipartite chromatin signature: H3K27ac on promoters and enhancers, and H3K27me3 on gene bodies. Polycomb marking of gene bodies inhibits productive mRNA elongation."
https://openalex.org/W3129922896,"Amino acids are delivered into developing wheat grains to support the accumulation of storage proteins in the starchy endosperm, and transporters play important roles in regulating this process. RNA-seq, RT-qPCR, and promoter-GUS assays showed that three amino acid transporters are differentially expressed in the endosperm transfer cells ( TaAAP2 ), starchy endosperm cells ( TaAAP13 ), and aleurone cells and embryo of the developing grain ( TaAAP21 ), respectively. Yeast complementation revealed that all three transporters can transport a broad spectrum of amino acids. RNAi-mediated suppression of TaAAP13 expression in the starchy endosperm did not reduce the total nitrogen content of the whole grain, but significantly altered the composition and distribution of metabolites in the starchy endosperm, with increasing concentrations of some amino acids (notably glutamine and glycine) from the outer to inner starchy endosperm cells compared with wild type. Overexpression of TaAAP13 under the endosperm-specific HMW-GS (high molecular weight glutenin subunit) promoter significantly increased grain size, grain nitrogen concentration, and thousand grain weight, indicating that the sink strength for nitrogen transport was increased by manipulation of amino acid transporters. However, the total grain number was reduced, suggesting that source nitrogen remobilized from leaves is a limiting factor for productivity. Therefore, simultaneously increasing loading of amino acids into the phloem and delivery to the spike would be required to increase protein content while maintaining grain yield."

https://openalex.org/W3130941258,"Intertidal systems are complex and dynamic environments with many interacting factors influencing biochemical characteristics and microbial communities. One key factor are the actions of resident fauna, many of which are regarded as ecosystem engineers because of their bioturbation, bioirrigation and sediment stabilising activities. The purpose of this investigation was to elucidate the evolutionary implications of the ecosystem engineering process by identifying, if any, aspects that act as selection pressures upon microbial communities. A mesocosm study was performed using the well characterised intertidal ecosystem engineers Corophium volutator , Hediste diversicolor , and microphytobenthos, in addition to manual turbation of sediments to compare effects of bioturbation, bioirrigation and stabilisation. A range of sediment functions and biogeochemical gradients were measured in conjunction with 16S rRNA sequencing and diatom taxonomy, with downstream bacterial metagenome function prediction, to identify selection pressures that incited change to microbial community composition and function. Bacterial communities were predominantly Proteobacteria, with the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes, Alphaproteobacteria and Verrucomicrobia being partially displaced by Deltaproteobacteria, Acidobacteria and Chloroflexi as dissolved oxygen concentration and redox potential decreased. Bacterial community composition was driven strongly by biogeochemistry; surface communities were affected by a combination of sediment functions and overlying water turbidity, and subsurface communities by biogeochemical gradients driven by sediment reworking. Diatom communities were dominated by Nitzschia laevis and Achnanthes sp., and assemblage composition was influenced by overlying water turbidity (manual or biogenic) rather than direct infaunal influences such as grazing."
https://openalex.org/W3129363081,"Background Mobile devices provide new opportunities for the prevention of overweight and obesity in children. We aimed to co-create and test an app that offered comprehensible feedback to parents on their child’s growth and delivered a suite of age-specific information about nutrition and activity. Methods A two-phased approach was used to co-create the digital growth tool—See How They Grow—and test its feasibility. Phase one used focus groups (parents and professionals such as paediatricians and midwives) and a national on-line survey to gather requirements and build the app. Phase two involved testing the app over 12-weeks, with parents or carers of children aged ≤ 2-years. All research activities were undertaken exclusively through the app, and participants were recruited using social media and hard copy materials given to patents at a child health visit. Findings Four focus groups and 101 responses to the national survey informed the features and functions to include in the final app. Two hundred and twenty-five participants downloaded the app, resulting in 208 eligible participants. Non-Māori/Non-Pacific (78%) and Māori (14%) had the highest downloads. Fifty-four per cent of participants were parents of children under 6-months. These participants were more likely to regularly use the app than those with children older than 6-months (64% vs 36%, P = 0 . 011) . Over half of the participants entered three measures (n = 101, 48%). Of those that completed the follow-up survey (n = 101, 48%), 72 reported that the app helped them better understand how to interpret growth charts. Conclusion The app was acceptable and with minor modifications, has the potential to be an effective tool to support parents understanding of growth trajectories for their children. A larger trial is needed to evaluate if the app can have a measurable impact on increasing knowledge and behaviour, and therefore on preventing childhood overweight and obesity."
https://openalex.org/W3130385509,"Conservation and management of large carnivores requires knowledge of female and male dispersal. Such information is crucial to evaluate the population’s status and thus management actions. This knowledge is challenging to obtain, often incomplete and contradictory at times. The size of the target population and the methods applied can bias the results. Also, population history and biological or environmental influences can affect dispersal on different scales within a study area. We have genotyped Eurasian lynx (180 males and 102 females, collected 2003–2017) continuously distributed in southern Finland (~23,000 km 2 ) using 21 short tandem repeats (STR) loci and compared statistical genetic tests to infer local and sex-specific dispersal patterns within and across genetic clusters as well as geographic regions. We tested for sex-specific substructure with individual-based Bayesian assignment tests and spatial autocorrelation analyses. Differences between the sexes in genetic differentiation, relatedness, inbreeding, and diversity were analysed using population-based AMOVA, F-statistics, and assignment indices. Our results showed two different genetic clusters that were spatially structured for females but admixed for males. Similarly, spatial autocorrelation and relatedness was significantly higher in females than males. However, we found weaker sex-specific patterns for the Eurasian lynx when the data were separated in three geographical regions than when divided in the two genetic clusters. Overall, our results suggest male-biased dispersal and female philopatry for the Eurasian lynx in Southern Finland. The female genetic structuring increased from west to east within our study area. In addition, detection of male-biased dispersal was dependent on analytical methods utilized, on whether subtle underlying genetic structuring was considered or not, and the choice of population delineation. Conclusively, we suggest using multiple genetic approaches to study sex-biased dispersal in a continuously distributed species in which population delineation is difficult."

Consequently, health planners should prioritize different interventions and design appropriate programs to enhance maternal health services utilization. Results of prior studies are conflicting. Furthermore, only few studies were done from antenatal to postnatal continuum of care in Ethiopia.This study aimed to assess prevalence and predictors of skilled maternal health services utilization at Dale-Wonsho health and demographic surveillance site of the Hawassa University, South Ethiopia, in 2019.A community based cross sectional study was conducted from January 1-30; 2019. A total of 682 women who gave birth in the last twelve months were selected by using a two stage sampling technique. Data were collected through face to face interview. Data were entered into Epidata version 3.1. Then, they were exported and analyzed by SPSS version 22. Bi-variable logistic regression analysis was done and variables with p-value less than 0.05 were considered as candidate for multivariable logistic regression analysis. Adjusted Odds Ratios (AOR) with 95% CI were computed, and p-value less than 0.01 was computed to determine the level of significance.Prevalence of antenatal care, institutional delivery and postnatal care utilizations were 69.1%, 52.1% and 32.7% respectively. Educated women (AOR = 4.72, 95%CI,2.82,7.9), household training (AOR = 8.52,95%CI = 5.5,13.1), middle wealth quantile(AOR = 0.8,95%CI,0.4-0.7), being richest wealth quantile (AOR = 0.16;95%CI = 0.06,0.41) and pregnancy plan (AOR = 3.65,95%CI,1.67-8.0) were factors positively associated with antenatal care utilization. Husband education (AOR = 4.96,95CI,3.08-8.0), and antenatal care (AOR = 5.9; 95%CI,3.87,9.1) were factors associated with institutional delivery. Maternal education (AOR = 2.5,95CI,1.4-4.4), information about postnatal care service utilization (AOR = 3.6,95CI,2.1,6.2) and women autonomy(AOR = 6.1,95CI,3.8,9.7) were positively associated with postnatal care service.Prevalence of antenatal care, institutional delivery and postnatal care services were lower than the targeted plan. Policy makers should focus on capacity building of women both economically and academically. So, women should be more autonomous to utilize health services effectively. Moreover, awareness creation among women should be enhanced about maternal health service."

This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02185196. Findings We enrolled 100 children in placebo group and 97 in vitamin D group. On admission, 50 (52%) and 49 (49%) of children in vitamin D and placebo groups, respectively were vitamin D deficient. Among children with a sufficient serum vitamin D level on admission, a lower trend for duration of resolution of severe pneumonia in hours [72(IQR:44–96)vs. 88(IQR:48–132);p = 0.07] and duration of hospital stay in days [4(IQR:3–5)vs.5(IQR:4–7);P = 0.09] was observed in vitamin D group compared to placebo. No beneficial effect was observed in vitamin D deficient group or irrespective of vitamin D status. Conclusion Age-specific mega dose of vitamin D followed by a maintenance dose shown to have no statistical difference between the two intervention groups, however there was a trend of reduction of time to recovery from pneumonia and overall duration of hospital stay in under-five children with a sufficient serum vitamin D level on hospital admission."

Over the past few years, at the Department of Otolaryngology, Cheng Hsin General Hospital (Taipei, Taiwan), cochlear implant devices have been switched on within 24 hours of their implantation. Differences in impedance evolution after early switch-on for different devices have not been previously discussed. The present study aimed to investigate the impedance evolution of one device and the factors influencing this after early activation. Results are compared to published results of other devices. A total of 16 patients who received Advanced Bionics TM devices and had early activation within 24 hours of implantation, were included in the study. Impedance telemetry was recorded intraoperatively and postoperatively at 1 day, 1 week, 2 weeks, 4 weeks and 8 weeks. A stepwise increase was observed in the impedance evolution. To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first to investigate the impedance evolution of the different devices after early switch-on within 24 hours of implantation and its influencing factors. Further research with a longitudinal design to compare the differences in electrode impedances between patients activated early versus those activated after a few weeks will be necessary for the disclosure of the underlying mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W3131968699,"Lifetime distributions are an important statistical tools to model the different characteristics of lifetime data sets. The statistical literature contains very sophisticated distributions to analyze these kind of data sets. However, these distributions have many parameters which cause a problem in estimation step. To open a new opportunity in modeling these kind of data sets, we propose a new extension of half-logistic distribution by using the odd Lindley-G family of distributions. The proposed distribution has only one parameter and simple mathematical forms. The statistical properties of the proposed distributions, including complete and incomplete moments, quantile function and Rényi entropy, are studied in detail. The unknown model parameter is estimated by using the different estimation methods, namely, maximum likelihood, least square, weighted least square and Cramer-von Mises. The extensive simulation study is given to compare the finite sample performance of parameter estimation methods based on the complete and progressive Type-II censored samples. Additionally, a new log-location-scale regression model is introduced based on a new distribution. The residual analysis of a new regression model is given comprehensively. To convince the readers in favour of the proposed distribution, three real data sets are analyzed and compared with competitive models. Empirical findings show that the proposed one-parameter lifetime distribution produces better results than the other extensions of half-logistic distribution."
https://openalex.org/W3130355137,"Many apple cultivars are subject to biennial fluctuations in flowering and fruiting. It is believed that this phenomenon is caused by a repressive effect of developing fruit on the initiation of flowers in the apex of proximal bourse shoots. However, the genetic pathways of floral initiation are incompletely described in apple, and the biological nature of floral repression by fruit is currently unknown. In this study, we characterized the transcriptional landscape of bourse shoot apices in the biennial cultivar, ’Honeycrisp’, during the period of floral initiation, in trees bearing a high fruit load and in trees without fruit. Trees with high fruit load produced almost exclusively vegetative growth in the subsequent year, whereas the trees without fruit produced flowers on the majority of the potential flowering nodes. Using RNA-based sequence data, we documented gene expression at high resolution, identifying &gt;11,000 transcripts that had not been previously annotated, and characterized expression profiles associated with vegetative growth and flowering. We also conducted a census of genes related to known flowering genes, organized the phylogenetic and syntenic relationships of these genes, and compared expression among homeologs. Several genes closely related to AP1 , FT , FUL , LFY , and SPLs were more strongly expressed in apices from non-bearing, floral-determined trees, consistent with their presumed floral-promotive roles. In contrast, a homolog of TFL1 exhibited strong and persistent up-regulation only in apices from bearing, vegetative-determined trees, suggesting a role in floral repression. Additionally, we identified four GIBBERELLIC ACID (GA) 2 OXIDASE genes that were expressed to relatively high levels in apices from bearing trees. These results define the flowering-related transcriptional landscape in apple, and strongly support previous studies implicating both gibberellins and TFL1 as key components in repression of flowering by fruit."

The EPF were trapped from soil samples taken from an apricot orchard. The traps, which were baited in the laboratory, used susceptible host insects, including the last-instar larvae of Galleria mellonella (wax moth larvae) and Tenebrio molitor (mealworm larvae). The potential pathogenicity of the local Metarhizium majus isolate was tested and verified using susceptible laboratory-reared last-instar T . molitor larvae.

https://openalex.org/W3129494401,"Purpose This study was conducted to evaluate the role of liver sonography in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and elevated liver enzymes. Materials and methods In this retrospective study, patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in our emergency ward between January 01 and April 24, 2020 and elevated liver enzymes were included (Cohort 1). Additionally, the local radiology information system was screened for sonographies in COVID-19 patients at the intensive care unit in the same period (Cohort 2). Liver sonographies and histologic specimen were reviewed and suspicious findings recorded. Medical records were reviewed for clinical data. Ultrasound findings and clinical data were correlated with severity of liver enzyme elevation. Results Cohort 1: 126 patients were evaluated, of which 47 (37.3%) had elevated liver enzymes. Severity of liver enzyme elevation was associated with death (p&lt;0.001). 8 patients (6.3%) had suspicious ultrasound findings, including signs of acute hepatitis (n = 5, e.g. thickening of gall bladder wall, hepatomegaly, decreased echogenicity of liver parenchyma) and vascular complications (n = 4). Cohort 2: 39 patients were evaluated, of which 14 are also included in Cohort 1. 19 patients (48.7%) had suspicious ultrasound findings, of which 13 patients had signs of acute hepatitis and 6 had vascular complications. Pathology was performed in 6 patients. Predominant findings were severe cholestasis and macrophage activation. Conclusion For most hospitalized COVID-19 patients, elevated liver enzymes cause little concern as they are only mild to moderate. However, in severely ill patients bedside sonography is a powerful tool to reveal different patterns of vascular, cholestatic or inflammatory complications in the liver, which are associated with high mortality. In addition, macrophage activation as histopathologic correlate for a hyperinflammatory syndrome seems to be a frequent complication in COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W3130678924,"Linguistic communication requires understanding of words in relation to their context. Among various aspects of context, one that has received relatively little attention until recently is the speakers themselves. We asked whether comprehenders’ online language comprehension is affected by the perceived reliability with which a speaker formulates pragmatically well-formed utterances. In two eye-tracking experiments, we conceptually replicated and extended a seminal work by Grodner and Sedivy (2011). A between-participant manipulation was used to control reliability with which a speaker follows implicit pragmatic conventions (e.g., using a scalar adjective in accordance with contextual contrast). Experiment 1 replicated Grodner and Sedivy’s finding that contrastive inference in response to scalar adjectives was suspended when both the spoken input and the instructions provided evidence of the speaker’s (un)reliability: For speech from the reliable speaker, comprehenders exhibited the early fixations attributable to a contextually-situated, contrastive interpretation of a scalar adjective. In contrast, for speech from the unreliable speaker, comprehenders did not exhibit such early fixations. Experiment 2 provided novel evidence of the reliability effect in the absence of explicit instructions. In both experiments, the effects emerged in the earliest expected time window given the stimuli sentence structure. The results suggest that real-time interpretations of spoken language are optimized in the context of a speaker identity, characteristics of which are extrapolated across utterances."
https://openalex.org/W3130912664,"Water is vital for the survival of any species because of its key role in most physiological processes. However, little is known about the non-food-related water sources exploited by arboreal mammals, the seasonality of their drinking behavior and its potential drivers, including diet composition, temperature, and rainfall. We investigated this subject in 14 wild groups of brown howler monkeys ( Alouatta guariba clamitans ) inhabiting small, medium, and large Atlantic Forest fragments in southern Brazil. We found a wide variation in the mean rate of drinking among groups (range = 0–16 records/day). Streams (44% of 1,258 records) and treeholes (26%) were the major types of water sources, followed by bromeliads in the canopy (16%), pools (11%), and rivers (3%). The type of source influenced whether howlers used a hand to access the water or not. Drinking tended to be evenly distributed throughout the year, except for a slightly lower number of records in the spring than in the other seasons, but it was unevenly distributed during the day. It increased in the afternoon in all groups, particularly during temperature peaks around 15:00 and 17:00. We found via generalized linear mixed modelling that the daily frequency of drinking was mainly influenced negatively by flower consumption and positively by weekly rainfall and ambient temperature, whereas fragment size and the consumption of fruit and leaves played negligible roles. Overall, we confirm the importance of preformed water in flowers to satisfy the howler’s water needs, whereas the influence of the climatic variables is compatible with the ‘thermoregulation/dehydration-avoiding hypothesis’. In sum, we found that irrespective of habitat characteristics, brown howlers seem to seek a positive water balance by complementing the water present in the diet with drinking water, even when it is associated with a high predation risk in terrestrial sources."
https://openalex.org/W3129834900,"Based on a new trade accounting method—the trade in value-added accounting method—this paper constructs the international manufacturing trade in value-added networks and preferential trade agreement (PTA) networks and uses the complex network analysis method to explore the relations between PTA and international manufacturing trade in value-added from the perspective of the global value chain. The results are as follows: (1) Over the years, the international manufacturing trade in value-added networks and PTA networks has shown a significant clustering effect, and the size of networks has grown rapidly. (2) The TEX, DVA and FVA networks of the international manufacturing value added trade over the years can be divided into two societies in the Asia-Pacific region and the European region. This division just reflects the different modes of division of labor in the manufacturing value chain of the two major economic regions in the world. (3) QAP analysis shows that the influencing factors of the traditional gravity model can still explain the manufacturing trade network and its value-added trade network, while the influence of economic globalization, the enlargement of the EU and the internationalization strategy of enterprises, the PTA network and manufacturing value-added the relationship between trade networks changed from positive to negative in 2004."
https://openalex.org/W3130611421,"Introduction Estimation of hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transfusion risk in blood donors is essential for monitoring the safety of the blood supply and the impact of new screening tests. Due to improvements in donor selection and continuing progress in screening assays, residual risk of virus transmission has significantly decreased over the past years. It is not practical and sometimes even not possible to measure residual risk in blood donors directly and mathematical models are used. The aim of this study was to calculate the prevalence, incidence rates of HBV, HCV and HIV infections and analyse evolution of their transmission residual risk from 2004 to 2018 at the National Blood Center of Lithuania. Materials and methods Data from the archives of the National Blood Center of Lithuania from 2004 to 2018 was retrospectively analysed. The residual risk was calculated for each virus and year by applying the incidence/window-period model suggested by World Health Organization. For the analysis of the residual risk yearly trends a linear regression was used. Results A total of 754,755 blood donors and 1,245,568 donations were included in the analysis and represented a 2.06 donations per donor over 15 years. Average residual risk for HBV, HCV and HIV respectively was 570.04, 807.14 and 35.72 per 1,00,000 donations. During the study period, there was statistically significant downward trend in the residual risk for every analysed virus. Discussion Residual risk of virus transmission has been steadily decreasing over past 15 years in Lithuanian donors, but the current risk remains quite high. It is difficult to establish how much the risk is affected by statistical assumptions or virus prevalence in general population. However, results of this study indicate the need of the population screening program of transfusion transmitted viruses."
https://openalex.org/W3131285422,"The importance of research ethics (RE) training has led academic and funding institutions to require that students, trainees, and faculty obtain such training at various stages of their careers. Despite the increasing awareness of the value RE education offers, this training requirement is absent in Jordan. We aimed to assess RE education offerings of pharmacy master programs in Jordan and compare with the top-ranked pharmacy graduate programs globally. Therefore, a list of universities that offer research-based pharmacy master programs was created. Each program was evaluated for the inclusion of RE education. A qualitative content analysis approach based on inductive reasoning and latent analysis was followed to analyze the data. Results of the study showed a lack of appropriate RE education for graduate-level pharmacy programs in Jordan with only 40% of the programs partially discuss selected topics related to RE. Regarding pharmacy graduate programs globally, 10% offer a standalone RE course, 40% offer some discussions related to RE, another 10% do not offer RE education in any form, and the remaining 40% of the programs were difficult to assess due to lack of sufficient information available online. Based on the findings of this study, training in RE is tends to be lacking in pharmacy graduate programs in Jordan and globally, with a greater lack in Jordan than globally. There is a need to incorporate formal RE education into programs that do not offer this type of instruction. Programs that formally touch on some aspects of RE need to expand the scope of topics to include more RE-related themes. Integrating a standalone RE course into pharmacy graduate programs is highly encouraged."
https://openalex.org/W3131389559,"Background Although tramadol is an effective weak opioid analgesic, careful monitoring of potential central nervous system adverse reactions in older adults is needed, especially when used with concomitant medications which may trigger the adverse effects. We aimed to characterize tramadol users with potentially inappropriate co-medications in older adults using a latent class analysis (LCA). Method Patients aged 65 years or older using tramadol and receiving potentially inappropriate co-medications were included from a nationwide healthcare claims database. We defined antidepressants, first-generation antihistamines, and anxiolytics as potentially inappropriate co-medications. We applied an LCA for grouping tramadol users based on the common characteristics of medication use and healthcare utilization, and each patient was probabilistically assigned to a class. Patients’ characteristics in different latent classes were compared. Potential adverse drug reactions (ADRs) was defined as the any visits for emergency department after the occurrence of potentially inappropriate co-medications. Logistic regression analysis was used to examine the association between latent classes and potential ADRs. Results We identified four distinct latent classes of tramadol users representing different patterns of co-medications: multiple potential drug-drug interaction (pDDI) combination users, antihistamines-tramadol users, antidepressants-tramadol users, and anxiolytics-tramadol users. Multiple pDDI combination users showed high proportion of regular tramadol use, tended to visit more medical institutions, and had a high Charlson comorbidity score. The duration of use of potentially inappropriate co-medications with tramadol was the longest in multiple pDDI combination users and the shortest in antihistamines-tramadol users. When compared with antihistamines-tramadol users, increased potential ADR risk was observed in multiple pDDI combination users (adjusted odds ratio (OR), 1.81; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.75–1.88), antidepressants-tramadol users (1.24; 1.19–1.29), and anxiolytics-tramadol users (1.04; 1.00–1.08). Conclusions Four distinct classes were identified among older adults using tramadol and potentially inappropriate co-medications. Differences in potential ADR risk were observed between these classes. These findings may help to identify patients at a high risk for ADRs owing to potentially inappropriate co-medications with tramadol."

In contrast to childhood, learning a new language can be highly challenging for adults. The present study aims at investigating neural mechanisms supporting very initial foreign language learning in adulthood. For this reason, subjects underwent an implicit semantic associative training in which they had to learn new pseudoword-picture pairings. Learning success was measured via a recognition experiment presenting learned versus new pseudoword-picture pairings. Neural correlates were assessed by an innovative multi-methodological approach simultaneously applying electroencephalography (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Results indicate memory-related processes based on familiarity and mechanisms of cognitive control to be present during initial vocabulary learning. Findings underline the fascinating plasticity of the adult brain during foreign language learning, even after a short semantic training of only 18 minutes as well as the importance of comparing evidence from different neuroscientific methods and behavioral data."
https://openalex.org/W3133206425,"Aiming at the situation that the existing visible and infrared images fusion algorithms only focus on highlighting infrared targets and neglect the performance of image details, and cannot take into account the characteristics of infrared and visible images, this paper proposes an image enhancement fusion algorithm combining Karhunen-Loeve transform and Laplacian pyramid fusion. The detail layer of the source image is obtained by anisotropic diffusion to get more abundant texture information. The infrared images adopt adaptive histogram partition and brightness correction enhancement algorithm to highlight thermal radiation targets. A novel power function enhancement algorithm that simulates illumination is proposed for visible images to improve the contrast of visible images and facilitate human observation. In order to improve the fusion quality of images, the source image and the enhanced images are transformed by Karhunen-Loeve to form new visible and infrared images. Laplacian pyramid fusion is performed on the new visible and infrared images, and superimposed with the detail layer images to obtain the fusion result. Experimental results show that the method in this paper is superior to several representative image fusion algorithms in subjective visual effects on public data sets. In terms of objective evaluation, the fusion result performed well on the 8 evaluation indicators, and its own quality was high."

Methods The sample included 220 pregnant WLWH in Cameroon. Multivariable modified Poisson regression was conducted to assess the relationship between IPV, hunger, and CMD on ART adherence. Results Almost half (44%) of participants recently missed/mistimed an ART dose. Probable CMD was associated with greater risk of missed/mistimed ART dose (aRR 1.5 [95% CI 1.1, 1.9]). Hunger was associated with greater risk of missed/mistimed ART dose among those who reported IPV (aRR 1.9 [95% CI 1.2, 2.8]), but not among those who did not (aRR 0.8 [95% CI 0.2, 2.3]). Conclusion Suboptimal ART adherence, CMD, and IPV were common among pregnant WLWH in Cameroon. Pregnant WLWH experiencing IPV and hunger may be especially vulnerable to suboptimal ART adherence."
https://openalex.org/W3131119530,"Cyp33 is an essential human cyclophilin prolyl isomerase that plays myriad roles in splicing and chromatin remodeling. In addition to a canonical cyclophilin (Cyp) domain, Cyp33 contains an RNA-recognition motif (RRM) domain, and RNA-binding triggers proline isomerase activity. One prominent role for Cyp33 is through a direct interaction with the mixed lineage leukemia protein 1 (MLL1, also known as KMT2A) complex, which is a histone methyltransferase that serves as a global regulator of human transcription. MLL activity is regulated by Cyp33, which isomerizes a key proline in the linker between the PHD3 and Bromo domains of MLL1, acting as a switch between gene activation and repression. The direct interaction between MLL1 and Cyp33 is critical, as deletion of the MLL1-PHD3 domain responsible for this interaction results in oncogenesis. The Cyp33 RRM is central to these activities, as it binds both the PHD3 domain and RNA. To better understand how RNA binding drives the action of Cyp33, we performed RNA-SELEX against full-length Cyp33 accompanied by deep sequencing. We have identified an enriched Cyp33 binding motif ( AAUAAUAA ) broadly represented in the cellular RNA pool as well as tightly binding RNA aptamers with affinities comparable and competitive with the Cyp33 MLL1-PHD3 interaction. RNA binding extends beyond the canonical RRM domain, but not to the Cyp domain, suggesting an indirect mechanism of interaction. NMR chemical shift mapping confirms an overlapping, but not identical, interface on Cyp33 for RNA and PHD3 binding. This finding suggests RNA can disrupt the gene repressive Cyp33-MLL1 complex providing another layer of regulation for chromatin remodeling by MLL1."
https://openalex.org/W3132793427,"The strong association between self-reported sleep difficulties and depressive symptoms is well documented. However, individuals who suffer from depressive symptoms could potentially interpret the values attached to a subjective scale differently from others, making comparisons of sleep difficulties across individuals with different depressive symptoms problematic. The objective of this study is to determine the existence and magnitude of reporting heterogeneity in subjective assessment of sleep difficulties by those who have depressive symptoms. We implement an online survey using Visual Analogue Scales and anchoring vignettes to study the comparability of subjective assessments of sleep difficulties among college students in Switzerland ( N = 1, 813). Using multivariate linear regressions and double-index models, our analysis shows that reporting heterogeneity plays only a marginal role in moderating the association between sleep difficulties and depression, irrespective of the severity of the depressive symptoms of the individuals. This suggests that unadjusted comparisons of self-reported sleep difficulties between college students are meaningful, even among individuals with depressive symptoms."
https://openalex.org/W3132002992,"Despite expanded antiretroviral therapy (ART) eligibility in South Africa, many people diagnosed with HIV do not initiate ART promptly, yet understanding of the reasons is limited. Using data from an 8-month prospective cohort interview study of women and men newly-diagnosed with HIV in three public-sector primary care clinics in the eThekwini (Durban) region, South Africa, 2010–2014, we examined if theoretically-relevant social-structural, social-cognitive, psychosocial, and health status indicators were associated with time to ART initiation. Of 459 diagnosed, 350 returned to the clinic for their CD4+ test results (linkage); 153 (33.3%) were ART-eligible according to treatment criteria at the time; 115 (75.2% of those eligible) initiated ART (median = 12.86 weeks [95% CI: 9.75, 15.97] after linkage). In adjusted Cox proportional hazard models, internalized stigma was associated with a 65% decrease in the rate of ART initiation (Adjusted hazard ratio [AHR] 0.35, 95% CI: 0.19–0.80) during the period less than four weeks after linkage to care, but not four or more weeks after linkage to care, suggesting that stigma-reduction interventions implemented shortly after diagnosis may accelerate ART uptake. As reported by others, older age was associated with more rapid ART initiation (AHR for 1-year age increase: 1.04, 95% CI: 1.01–1.07) and higher CD4+ cell count (≥300μL vs. &lt;150μL) was associated with a lower rate of initiation (AHR 0.38, 95% CI: 0.19–0.80). Several other factors that were assessed prior to diagnosis, including stronger belief in traditional medicine, higher endorsement of stigma toward people living with HIV, food insecurity, and higher psychological distress, were found to be in the expected direction of association with ART initiation, but confidence intervals were wide and could not exclude a null finding."

https://openalex.org/W3132342203,"Drug-induced allergy (DIA), an unexpectedly triggered side effect of drugs used for therapeutic purposes, is a serious clinical issue that needs to be resolved because it interrupts the treatment of the primary disease. Since conventional allergy testing is insufficient to accurately predict the occurrence of DIA or to determine the drugs causing it, the development of diagnostic and predictive tools for allergic reactions is important. We demonstrated a novel method, termed high-sensitive allergy test (HiSAT), for the rapid diagnosis of allergy (within 1 hr; with true-positive diagnosis rates of 89% and 9% for patients with and without allergy-like symptoms, respectively). HiSAT analyzes the cell kinetics as an index against chemotactic factors in a patient’s serum, as different from the diagnosis using conventional methods. Once allergy has occurred, HiSAT can be used to determine the causative medicine using culture supernatants incubated with the subject’s lymphocytes and the test allergen. This test is more efficient (60%) than the lymphocyte transformation test (20%). Furthermore, in HiSAT, cell mobility significantly increases in a dose-dependent manner against supernatant incubated with lymphocytes from a subject with pollinosis collected at a time when the subject is without allergic symptoms and the antigen. The result demonstraed that HiSAT might be a promising method to rapidly diagnose DIA or to determine with high accuracy the antigen causing allergy."

https://openalex.org/W3133173377,"Peroxisomes are metabolically active organelles which are known to exert anti-inflammatory effects especially associated with the synthesis of mediators of inflammation resolution. However, the role of catalase and effects of peroxisome derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) caused by lipid peroxidation through 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4-HNE) on lipopolysaccharide (LPS) mediated inflammatory pathway are largely unknown. Here, we show that inhibition of catalase by 3-aminotriazole (3-AT) results in the generation of peroxisomal ROS, which contribute to leaky peroxisomes in RAW264.7 cells. Leaky peroxisomes cause the release of matrix proteins to the cytosol, which are degraded by ubiquitin proteasome system. Furthermore, 3-AT promotes the formation of 4HNE-IκBα adduct which directly interferes with LPS induced NF-κB activation. Even though, a selective degradation of peroxisome matrix proteins and formation of 4HNE- IκBα adduct are not directly related with each other, both of them are could be the consequences of lipid peroxidation occurring at the peroxisome membrane."
https://openalex.org/W3129356729,"Glypican-5 (GPC5) is a heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) localized to the plasma membrane. We previously reported that in the human mesenchymal stem cell line UE6E7T-3, GPC5 is overexpressed in association with transformation and promotes cell proliferation by acting as a co-receptor for Sonic hedgehog signaling. In this study, we found using immunofluorescence microscopy that in transformed cells (U3DT), GPC5 localized not only at primary cilia on the cell surface, but also at the leading edge of migrating cells, at the intercellular bridge and blebs during cytokinesis, and in extracellular vesicles. In each subcellular region, GPC5 colocalized with fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) and the small GTPases Rab11 and ARF6, indicating that GPC5 is delivered to these regions by Rab11-associated recycling endosomes. These colocalizations suggest that GPC5 plays an important role in FGF2 stimulation of cell migration, which was abrogated by knockdown of GPC5. Our findings indicate that GPC5 plays a role in regulation of U3DT cell migration and provides several insights into the functions of GPC5 that could be elucidated by future studies."
https://openalex.org/W3131165902,"Background The female condom is the only female-initiated form of protection against unintended pregnancy and sexually transmissible infections (STIs). However, use of this method in Australia is low. To better understand women’s views and experiences of the female condom, we conducted an interventional cross-sectional study. Methods Cisgender women ≥16 years, heterosexually active and living in New South Wales were recruited through social media advertisements and email invitations to clients of a family planning service. Eligible participants were provided with three female condoms and invited to complete a follow-up survey. Survey responses for women who attempted to use at least one female condom were summarised using counts and proportions. Results We recruited 556 women; few (30/556) had used the female condom before the study. There were 284 women who used, or attempted to use, a female condom during the study and completed the follow-up survey. Fifty-one percent (104/205) reported experiencing some difficulty in insertion, although only 46% (130/284) had seen an instructional demonstration. Approximately half (105/204) of women rated the sensation and comfort of the female condom as the same or better than the male condom, and 66% (137/204) reported that it provided the same or better lubrication. Approximately half of women said they would consider using the female condom again for STI prevention (51% (133/260)) or contraception (40% (103/260)), or would recommend to others (43% (112/260)). Conclusion Findings highlight the need for increased health promotion and education regarding use of the female condom. To increase access it will be important to address method cost and availability in Australia. Future research should explore other perspectives of this method, including among the LGBTIQ+ community."

Materials and methods The CNT was developed based on semantic category, imageability, and psycholinguistic factors such as word frequency and word length. The test materials included two main semantic categories (living objects and artificial objects) comprising 60 items. We standardized the CNT on 221 healthy adults and administered the CNT to 112 stroke patients. Results Internal consistency and concurrent validity of the test were high. The mean total CNT scores varied significantly according to participants’ age, sex, and education. Among healthy controls, the scores for naming living objects were significantly higher than those for artificial objects. The analysis of stroke patients showed that the total CNT score revealed a statistically significant difference based on the patients’ lesion laterality and presence of aphasia, after controlling for age, sex, and education. However, the categorical scores achieved by comparing the naming scores for living and artificial objects showed no significant differences according to lesion laterality, stroke type, and presence of aphasia. Conclusion The CNT is a newly developed version of an overt naming task with high internal consistency validity for stroke patients in Korea. The newly developed CNT can prove useful in evaluating naming ability in stroke patients."

We selected the key elements on sugarcane industry convergence and on the benefit derived from industry convergence and development. We selected six secondary indexes and 18 tertiary indexes and used them to construct an overarching index system for measuring the convergence degree of sugarcane in the primary, secondary, and tertiary industries. We calculated the index’s system weight using the AHP and entropy method, and then the integrated development indicator of the sugarcane industry. Finally, we analyzed the convergence the development stage, achievements, and benefits of the sugarcane industry, as well as the shortage of convergence development. Our findings can provide guidance for the future development of the sugarcane industry in China from the perspective of industry convergence."
