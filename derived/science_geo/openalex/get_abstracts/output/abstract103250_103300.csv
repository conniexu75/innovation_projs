https://openalex.org/W2017214714,"The role of glyoxal and glycolaldehyde in protein cross-linking and <i>N</i><sub>∊</sub>-(carboxymethyl)lysine (CML) formation during Maillard reaction under physiological conditions was investigated. Incubation of bovine serum albumin with these reagents lead to rapid formation of C-2-imine cross-links and CML. Initial CML formation rate from glyoxal was not dependent on oxidation, suggesting an intramolecular Cannizzaro reaction. CML formation from glucose/lysine or Amadori product of both was strongly dependent on oxidation. Blocking of Amadori product by boric acid totally suppressed CML formation from Amadori product, but only by 37% in the glucose/lysine system. Trapping of glyoxal with aminoguanidine hardly suppressed CML formation from Amadori product, whereas it blocked 50% of CML production in the glucose/lysine system. While these results would support a significant role for glucose autoxidation in CML formation, the addition of lysine to a glucose/aminoguanidine incubation system catalyzed glyoxal-triazine formation 7-fold, thereby strongly suggesting that glucose autoxidation is not a factor for glyoxal-mediated CML formation. Based on these results, it can be estimated that approximately 50% of the CML forming in a glucose/lysine system originates from oxidation of Amadori product, and 40-50% originates from a pre-Amadori stage largely independent from glucose autoxidation. This step may be related to the so-called Namiki pathway of the Maillard reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1967365012,"Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a potent angiogenic factor and endothelial cell-specific mitogen that stimulates urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) activity in vascular endothelial cells. Here, we report that VEGF increases the high affinity binding of uPA to the same cells and that this binding is prevented by a peptide corresponding to the uPA receptor (uPAR) binding growth factor-like domain of uPA. Ligand cross-linking, ligand blotting, and uPA-Sepharose affinity chromatography revealed an increase in a cell surface uPA binding protein that corresponds to the uPAR on the basis of its affinity for uPA, Mrof 50,000-55,000, and phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C sensitivity. By Scatchard analysis, VEGF increased the number of uPAR molecules by 2.8-3.5-fold and concomitantly decreased their affinity for uPA. By northern blotting uPAR mRNA was increased in a dose- and time-dependent manner in response to VEGF. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that VEGF-induced angiogenesis is accompanied by increased uPAR expression and uPA activity on the endothelial cell surface. These observations are consistent with the notion that the uPA-uPAR interaction facilitates cellular invasion.

These observations are consistent with the notion that the uPA-uPAR interaction facilitates cellular invasion. During angiogenesis, quiescent endothelial cells are induced to locally degrade their basement membrane and to form new capillary blood vessels by sprouting into the surrounding stroma (Ausprunk and Folkman, 1977Ausprunk D.H. Folkman J. Microvasc. Res. 1977; 14: 53-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar). This phenomenon, which in the adult organism occurs in a number of physiological and pathological settings (Folkman and Klagsbrun, 1987Folkman J. Klagsbrun M. Science. 1987; 235: 442-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (4007) Google Scholar), requires tightly regulated extracellular proteolytic activity (Pepper and Montesano, 1990Pepper M.S. Montesano R. Cell Differ. Dev. 1990; 32: 319-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). A similar process of sprouting occurs in the formation of lymphatic capillaries during lymphangiogenesis (Clark and Clark, 1932Clark E.R. Clark L.C. Am. J. Anat. 1932; 51: 49-87Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Angiogenesis is regulated by a number of cytokines including basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF)1 1The abbreviations used are: bFGFbasic fibroblast growth factorVEGFvascular endothelial growth factorECMextracellular matrixBMEbovine microvascular endothelialBAEbovine aortic endothelialuPAurokinase-type plasminogen activatoruPARuPA receptortPAtissue-type plasminogen activatorscuPAsingle-chain uPAtcuPAtwo-chain uPAPAIPA inhibitorsHUVEhuman umbilical vein endothelialBLEbovine lymphatic endothelialPI-PLCphosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase CDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF, also known as vascular permeability factor). Unlike bFGF that is not exported via the classical secretory pathway, which acts on a broad spectrum of cell types and whose receptor expression by endothelial cells in vivo is still controversial, VEGF is likely to be a major regulator of physiological and pathological angiogenesis, since it is a secreted endothelial cell-specific mitogen whose receptors are expressed almost exclusively on vascular endothelial cells (Klagsbrun and D'Amore, 1991Klagsbrun M.

Urokinase- and tissue-type plasminogen activators (uPA, tPA) are serine proteinases involved in extracellular proteolytic processes. PAs convert plasminogen, a zymogen present in body fluids, to plasmin, a serine proteinase capable of degrading directly or indirectly (through the activation of other zymogens including latent metalloproteinases) most of the major protein components of the extracellular matrix (ECM). Because of its strong affinity for fibrin, tPA is primarily implicated in thrombolysis, while uPA is associated with tissue remodeling and cell invasion (Vassalli et al., 1991Vassalli J.D. Sappino A.P. Belin D. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 1067-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar). Although the proteolytic cascade of zymogen activation triggered by plasminogen activation appears to be a fundamental component in many situations of cellular invasion including angiogenesis (Mignatti and Rifkin, 1993Mignatti P. Rifkin D.B. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 161-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (1174) Google Scholar), Carmeliet et al., 1994Carmeliet P. Schoonjans L. Kieckens L. Ream B. Degen J. Bronson R.

Nature. 1994; 368: 419-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar have recently reported that transgenic mice lacking uPA and/or tPA develop and reproduce normally. However, the observation that tumor growth and metastasis are blocked by anti-uPA antibodies in vivo (Ossowski and Reich, 1983Ossowski L. Reich E. Cell. 1983; 35: 611-619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar; Ossowski et al., 1991bOssowski L. Russo-Payne H. Wilson E.L. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 274-281PubMed Google Scholar), may indicate differences in the requirement for PA activity in physiological versus pathological settings. uPA expression is regulated by hormones and growth factors (Vassalli et al., 1991Vassalli J.D. Sappino A.P. Belin D. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 1067-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar), and in the extracellular microenvironement, uPA activity is modulated by several mechanisms. It is secreted as an inactive zymogen (pro-uPA) that can be activated by a single proteolytic cleavage (Petersen et al., 1988Petersen L.C. Lund L.R. Nielsen L.S. Dan⊘ K. Skriver L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11189-11195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmin has been proposed as a physiologic activator of pro-uPA, although other enzymes, including cathepsin B, have also been implicated (Kobayashi et al., 1991Kobayashi H. Schmitt M. Goretzki L. Chucholowski N. Calvete J. Kramer M. Gunzler W.A. Janicke F. Graeff H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5147-5152Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Specific PA inhibitors (PAIs), often synthesized by the same cells that produce uPA, are of importance in the maintenance of ECM integrity, which is an essential requirement for cell invasion and tissue remodeling processes (Pepper and Montesano, 1990Pepper M.S. Montesano R. Cell Differ. Dev. 1990; 32: 319-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). An important step in the regulation of uPA activity involves binding to a high affinity cell surface receptor (uPAR) (Vassalli et al., 1985Vassalli J.-D. Baccino D. Belin D.B. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 86-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar; Stoppelli et al., 1985Stoppelli M.P. Corti A. Soffientini A. Cassani G. Blasi F. Assoian R.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Fibrinolysis. 1994; 8: 172-181Crossref Scopus (98) Google Scholar). uPAR is a highly glycosylated, 55-60-kDa protein (Estreicher et al., 1989Estreicher A. Wohlwend A. Belin D. Schleuning W.-D. Vassalli J.-D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1180-1189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; Roldan et al., 1990Roldan A.L. Cubellis M.V. Masucci M.T. Behrendt N. Lund L.R. Dan⊘ K. Appella E. Blasi F. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 467-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar) linked to the plasma membrane by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor (Ploug et al., 1991Ploug M.R.E. Behrendt N. Jensen A.L. Blasi F. Dan⊘ K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1926-1933Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Pro-uPA binds to uPAR via its non-catalytic amino-terminal region (Vassalli et al., 1985Vassalli J.-D. Baccino D. Belin D.B. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 86-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar; Appella et al., 1987Appella E. Robinson E.A. Ullrich S.J. Stoppelli M.P. Corti A. Cassani G. Blasi F. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4437-4440Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The bound zymogen is activated and remains active on the cell surface for several hours; binding of PAI-1 or PAI-2 to uPAR-bound uPA results in rapid internalization and degradation of the PAI+uPA complex (Cubellis et al., 1990Cubellis M.V. Wun T.C. Blasi F. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1079-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar; Estreicher et al., 1990Estreicher A. Muhlhauser J. Carpentier J.-L. Orci L. Vassalli J.-D. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 783-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). uPAR expression is associated with cell migration (Pepper et al., 1993Pepper M.S. Sappino A.-P. Stocklin R. Montesano R. Orci L. Vassalli J.-D. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 673-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) and is localized to the leading front of migrating monocytes and invading tumor cells (Estreicher et al., 1990Estreicher A.

Grondahl-Hansen J. Eriksen J. Blasi F. Dan⊘ K. Am. J. Pathol. 1991; 138: 1059-1067PubMed Google Scholar). Binding of uPA to uPAR has at least two major consequences: (i) localization of uPA activity on the cell surface; (ii) an increase in the rate of plasminogen activation (Ellis et al., 1989Ellis V. Scully M.F. Kakkar V.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2185-2188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Binding of uPA to uPAR greatly enhances ECM degradation and cell invasion in vitro and in vivo (Hollas et al., 1991Hollas W. Blasi F. Boyd D. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 3690-3695PubMed Google Scholar; Ossowski et al., 1991aOssowski L. Clunie G. Masucci M.T. Blasi F. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1107-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar; Quax et al., 1991Quax P.H.A. Pedersen N. Masucci M.T. Weening-Verhoeff E.J.D. Dan⊘ K. Verheijen J.H. Blasi F.

A. 1993; 90: 5021-5025Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Binding of uPA to uPAR could therefore be a critical event in cell invasion. Elevated levels of uPA expression are typical of migrating endothelial cells in vitro (Pepper et al., 1987Pepper M.S. Vassalli J.-D. Montesano R. Orci L. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2535-2541Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). While quiescent endothelial cells in vivo do not produce uPA (Larsson et al., 1984Larsson L.-I. Skriver L. Nielsen L.S. Gr-Hansen J. Kristensen P. Dan⊘ K. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 894-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar; Kristensen et al., 1984Kristensen P. Larsson L.-I. Nielsen L.S. Gr-Hansen J. Andreasen P.A. Dan⊘ K. FEBS Lett. 1984; 168: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), uPA is transiently induced in these cells at the time of capillary growth (Bacharach et al., 1992Bacharach E. Itin A. Keshet E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10686-10690Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In vitro, uPA activity is increased in blood and lymphatic vascular endothelial cells in response to bFGF and VEGF (Saksela et al., 1987Saksela O. Moscatelli D. Rifkin D.B. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 957-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar; Pepper et al., 1990Pepper M.S. Belin D. Montesano R. Orci L. Vassalli J.-D. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 743-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 1991, 1994). Both cytokines also stimulate the concomitant production of PAI-1, which is consistent with the hypothesis that balanced proteolytic activity is required for normal capillary morphogenesis (Pepper and Montesano, 1990Pepper M.S. Montesano R. Cell Differ. Dev. 1990; 32: 319-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The objective of the present studies was to determine whether VEGF increases uPAR expression in vascular endothelial cells in a manner similar to that previously described for bFGF (Mignatti et al., 1991Mignatti P. Mazzieri R. Rifkin D.B. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 1193-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Adrenal cortex-derived bovine microvascular endothelial (BME) cells, kindly provided by Drs. M. B. Furie and S. C. Silverstein (Columbia University, NY) (Furie et al., 1984Furie M.B. Cramer E.B. Naprstek B.L. Silverstein S.C. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 1033-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), were grown in α-modified minimum essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 15% heat-inactivated donor calf serum (Flow Laboratories, Baar, Switzerland). The cells were used between passages 17 and 24. Bovine aortic endothelial (BAE) cells (Pepper et al., 1993Pepper M.S. Sappino A.-P. Stocklin R. Montesano R. Orci L. Vassalli J.-D. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 673-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% donor calf serum and were used between passages 8 and 13. Human umbilical vein endothelial (HUVE) cells were grown in medium 199 (Life Technologies, Inc.), supplemented with 20% donor calf serum, 10 μg/ml heparin, and 30 μg/ml endothelial cell growth supplement (Becton Dickinson Labware, Bedford, MA), and were used between passages 6 and 13. Bovine lymphatic endothelial (BLE) cells isolated from mesenteric lymphatic vessels (clone A9, Pepper et al., 1994Pepper M.S. Wasi S. Ferrara N. Orci L. Montesano R. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 210: 298-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) were grown in DMEM containing 20% fetal calf serum (Hyclone Laboratories Inc., Logan, UT) and 1 mM sodium pyruvate and used between passages 21 and 23. Confluent cultures of all cell types were routinely split 1:4 and grown in gelatin-coated culture dishes or flasks (Falcon Labware, Becton Dickinson Co., Lincoln Park, NJ) in the presence of streptomycin (100 μg/ml) and penicillin (500 units/ml). Recombinant human VEGF (165-amino acid species) was purified from transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells as previously described (Ferrara et al=., 1991Ferrara N. Leung D.W. Cachianes G. Winer J. Henzel W.J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 198: 391-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The purity of the material was assessed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and by the presence of a single NH2-terminal amino acid sequence. Confluent BAE or BME cell monolayers in 15-mm culture wells (Nunc Intermed, Roskilde, Denmark) were incubated at 37°C for 15 h with the indicated concentrations of VEGF or bFGF as described below. The cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated for 1 h at 37°C in the presence of 1 ml/well of DMEM containing 0.25 units/ml of phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC; Boehringer Mannheim). 10 μl of culture supernatant was tested for PA activity by the 125I-fibrin plate assay (Gross et al., 1982Gross J.L. Moscatelli D. Jaffe E.A. Rifkin D.B. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 95: 974-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Human single-chain and two-chain uPA (scuPA, tcuPA) obtained from Serono (Serono Laboratories, Aubonne, Switzerland) and from Dr. Jack Henkin (Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL) were radiolabeled using Na-125I as described (Vassalli et al., 1984Vassalli J.-D. Dayer J.M. Wohlwend A. Belin D. J. Exp. Med. 1984; 159: 1653-1668Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar; Mignatti et al., 1991Mignatti P. Mazzieri R. Rifkin D.B. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 1193-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). 125I-uPA had a specific activity of 4.5-8.0 × 106cpm/μg. VEGF and/or bFGF were added to the culture medium of confluent endothelial cell cultures in 23-mm wells 36 h after the last medium change. After 15 h of incubation, the cells were acid treated and assayed for 125I-tcuPA binding capacity as described (Mignatti et al., 1991Mignatti P. Mazzieri R. Rifkin D.B. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 1193-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), except that 100 pM (or 70 pM in the case of BME cells) diisopropylfluorophosphate-treated 125I-tcuPA was used. Where mentioned, the indicated amounts of the mouse uPA 13-33 peptide, which corresponds to the uPAR binding region of mouse uPA (Appella et al., 1987Appella E. Robinson E.A. Ullrich S.J. Stoppelli M.P. Corti A. Cassani G. Blasi F. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4437-4440Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), were added to the binding medium (DMEM containing 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.2, 200 Kunitz-inhibitory units/ml of Trasylol, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). The peptide was synthesized according to the sequence of mouse uPA as described by Belin et al., 1985Belin D. Vassalli J.-D. Combepine C. Godeau F. Nagamine Y. Reich E. Kocher H.P. Duvoisin R.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 148: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar. Binding to cell-free gelatin-coated wells was measured in parallel and subtracted from all samples. Cells were washed four times with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin to remove unbound ligand, lysed in 0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, containing 0.2% Triton X-100, and centrifuged at 500 × g for 15 min at 4°C. The radioactivity present in the supernatants was measured in a γ-counter. For Scatchard analysis, BAE or HUVE cells were grown to confluence in 23-mm culture wells. HUVE cells were further grown for 4 days in the absence of heparin and endothelial cell growth supplement. VEGF (30 or 100 ng/ml in the case of HUVE and BAE cells, respectively) was added for 15 h as described above. The cells were acid treated and incubated with 250 μl/well of binding medium containing increasing concentrations of 125I-tcuPA (from 160 pM to 20 nM or from 26 pM to 80 nM in the case of BAE or HUVE cells, respectively). In parallel cultures, nonspecific binding was determined by adding a 100-fold molar excess of diisopropylfluorophosphate-treated unlabeled uPA to each concentration of 125I-tcuPA. Confluent BAE cell monolayers in 35-mm culture dishes were exposed to VEGF or bFGF and processed as described for the binding assay, except that 1 nM125I-tcuPA was added in 500 μl of binding medium/dish. After 1 h at 4°C, 10 μl of 100 mM disuccinimidyl suberate (Pierce) in Me2SO was added, and the cells were incubated at room temperature for 20 min. The cross-linking reaction was blocked by adding 0.7 μl of 7.5 M ammonium acetate. The cells were washed four times with phosphate-buffered saline, lysed in 0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, containing 0.2% Triton X-100, 200 Kunitz-inhibitory units/ml of Trasylol, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride, and sonicated. Protein concentration in the cell lysates was determined by the BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. 25 μg of cell extract protein were run in a SDS/6% polyacrylamide gel under non-reducing conditions. The gel was dried and exposed to Kodak XAR-5 films (Eastman Kodak Co.) at −80°C. Confluent BAE cell monolayers in 10-cm culture dishes were incubated at 37°C for 15 h with the indicated concentrations of VEGF or bFGF and treated with PI-PLC as described above. The PI-PLC washings were concentrated to 40 μl in 10-kDa cut-off Centricon tubes (Amicon GmbH, Witten, Germany), electrophoresed in a SDS/10% polyacrylamide gel under non-reducing conditions, and electroblotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond C-Extra, Amersham). The membrane was saturated for 1 h at room temperature with 10 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, pH 8.0 (TBS/Tween), containing 5% (w/v) skimmed milk and hybridized for 1 h at room temperature to 2.5 nM125I-scuPA in the same buffer. The membrane was repeatedly washed in TBS/Tween and exposed to Kodak XAR-5 films at −80°C. Confluent BAE cell monolayers in 10-cm culture dishes were incubated with the indicated concentrations of VEGF or bFGF as described above. The cells were incubated at 37°C for 2.5 h in methionine- and cysteine-free DMEM (Life Technologies, Inc.). The medium was replaced with medium containing 300 μCi/ml [35S]Met/Cys (specific activity, 1173 Ci/mmol, ICN ImmunoBiologicals, Costa Mesa, CA). After 3 h at 37°C, the cells were acid treated and incubated with PI-PLC as described above. The PI-PLC washings were loaded onto a uPA-Sepharose column equilibrated with 0.1 M Tris-HCl, 0.5 M NaCl, pH 8.0. After several washings with the same buffer, bound protein was eluted with 50 mM glycine, 0.1 M NaCl, pH 3.0, and harvested in tubes containing 0.5 M Hepes, 0.1 M NaCl, pH 7.5. The eluates were concentrated to a final volume of 40 μl in 10-kDa cut-off Centricon tubes and electrophoresed in a SDS/10% polyacrylamide gel. The gel was fixed in 30% ethanol, 10% acetic acid for 1 h at room temperature, washed with H2O, and incubated in autoradiography enhancer buffer (DuPont NEN) for 1 h. The dried gel was exposed to Kodak XAR-5 films at −80°C. VEGF and/or bFGF were added to the culture medium of confluent endothelial cell monolayers 36 h after the last medium change. After the indicated times, total cellular RNA was purified as described (Chomczynski and Sacchi, 1987Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62909) Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis was performed as described (Pepper et al. 1990). A 585-base pair BamHI fragment of human uPAR cDNA (clone p-uPAR-1, position 501-1086) (Roldan et al., 1990Roldan A.L. Cubellis M.V. Masucci M.T. Behrendt N. Lund L.R. Dan⊘ K. Appella E. Blasi F.

The plasmid was linearized with EcoRI and transcribed with bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase as described (Busso et al., 1986Busso N. Belin D. Failly-Crépin C. Vassalli J.-D. J. Biol.

Orci L. Vassalli J.-D. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 743-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar) cDNAs as described (Pepper et al., 1990Pepper M.S. Belin D. Montesano R. Orci L. Vassalli J.-D. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 743-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 1993). Autoradiograms were scanned with a GenoScan laser scanner (Genofit, Geneva, Switzerland). We have previously reported that VEGF increases uPA activity in BME cells (Pepper et al., 1991Pepper M.S. Ferrara N. Orci L. Montesano R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 181: 902-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). Here, we show that treatment with PI-PLC releases PA activity from cultured endothelial cells (Fig. 1). When cultured in the presence of 100 ng/ml VEGF, PI-PLC-releasable PA activity was increased 5.7- and 2.0-fold in BAE and BME cells, respectively. Enzyme activity released from VEGF-treated cells in the presence of PI-PLC was inhibited by amiloride, which inhibits uPA but not tPA (Vassalli and Belin, 1987Vassalli J.-D. Belin D. FEBS Lett. 1987; 214: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). The increase in uPA activity in VEGF-treated endothelial cells is unlikely to be due to a decrease in PAI expression, since VEGF also increases PAI-1 expression by these cells (Pepper et al., 1991Pepper M.S. Ferrara N. Orci L. Montesano R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 181: 902-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). In addition, pro-uPA is rapidly converted to active uPA in the fibrin plate assay; this rules out the possibility that pro-uPA activation could account for the increase in response to VEGF. These data demonstrate that the VEGF-induced uPA activity in vascular endothelial cells is PI-PLC-releasable, a characteristic feature of uPAR-bound enzyme. To further explore the possibility that the VEGF-mediated increase of cell-bound uPA activity was due to an increase in uPAR, we studied the uPA binding capacity of both human and bovine endothelial cells treated with VEGF. For this purpose, we used 125I-labeled human uPA, which binds to the bovine uPAR with high affinity (Mignatti et al., 1991Mignatti P. Mazzieri R. Rifkin D.B. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 1193-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In addition, cells were exposed to mild acidic conditions to remove cell-bound endogenous uPA before assessing binding capacity (data not shown). VEGF increased the uPA binding capacity of BME, BAE, BLE, and HUVE cells in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2). The most prominent effect was seen with BAE cells, where 100 ng/ml VEGF increased uPA binding capacity by 2.6-fold, and the smallest increase was seen with BME and HUVE cells, where the same concentration of VEGF increased uPA binding capacity by approximately 30%. Binding of human uPA to BAE, BME, and BLE cells was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by the mouse uPA 13-33 peptide (Appella et al., 1987Appella E. Robinson E.A. Ullrich S.J. Stoppelli M.P. Corti A. Cassani G. Blasi F. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4437-4440Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 2), which inhibits human uPA binding to bovine uPAR (Mignatti et al., 1991Mignatti P. Mazzieri R. Rifkin D.B. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 1193-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar; Pepper et al., 1993Pepper M.S. Sappino A.-P. Stocklin R. Montesano R. Orci L. Vassalli J.-D. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 673-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The peptide was not used with HUVE cells because it has been previously demonstrated that the mouse peptide is a poor inhibitor of human uPA binding to human cells (Estreicher et al., 1989Estreicher A. Wohlwend A. Belin D. Schleuning W.-D. Vassalli J.-D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1180-1189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These findings further indicate that uPA binding to endothelial cells is mediated by uPAR. Basic FGF and VEGF have a synergistic effect on in vitro angiogenesis, and when tested separately at equimolar concentrations, bFGF is a stronger angiogenesis inducer than VEGF (Pepper et al., 1992Pepper M.S. Ferrara N. Orci L. Montesano R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 824-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar). To compare the effect of bFGF and VEGF, alone or in combination, on uPA binding by endothelial cells, confluent BAE cells were treated with equimolar concentrations (50 or 500 pM) of bFGF or VEGF or with both cytokines together. Under these conditions, uPA binding was greater in bFGF- than in VEGF-treated cells; when the two cytokines were co-added, the resulting increase in uPA binding was additive (Fig. 3). Similar results were obtained with BME and BLE cells (data not shown). These findings demonstrate that the synergistic effect on in vitro angiogenesis is not mediated by synergism at the level of uPAR. To determine the number and affinity of uPA binding sites on endothelial cells, we performed a Scatchard analysis on cells incubated overnight with a saturating concentration of VEGF (100 or 30 ng/ml for BAE or HUVE cells, respectively) or with culture medium alone (Fig. 4). A single class of high affinity uPA binding sites was revealed in both cell types, with features that are characteristic of uPAR (Barnathan et al., 1990Barnathan E.S. Kuo A. Rosenfeld L. Kariko K.

We have used a targeted differential display method to identify FGF-1-inducible genes in murine NIH 3T3 fibroblasts. Here we report that one of these genes is predicted to encode a novel serine/threonine-specific protein kinase. This putative kinase has been named Fnk, for FGF-inducible kinase. The deduced Fnk amino acid sequence has 49, 36, 33, 32, and 22% overall identity to mouse serum-inducible kinase (Snk), mouse polo-like kinase (Plk), Drosophila polo, Saccharomyces Cdc5, and mouse Snk/Plk-akin kinase (Sak), respectively. These proteins are all members of the polo subfamily of structurally related serine/threonine kinases. The Plk, polo, Cdc5, and Sak kinases are required for cell division. FGF-1 induction of Fnk mRNA expression is first detected at 30 min after mitogen addition, reflects transcriptional activation, and does not require de novo protein synthesis. FGF-2, platelet-derived growth factor-BB, calf serum, or phorbol myristate acetate treatment of quiescent cells also induces fnk gene expression. Fnk mRNA is expressed in vivo in a tissue-specific manner, with relatively high levels detected in newborn and adult mouse skin.

Winkles J.A. Pusztai L. Lewis C.E. Yap E. Regulation of the Proliferation of Neoplastic Cells. Oxford University Press, Oxford1995Google Scholar). Both proteins are potent vascular cell mitogens and angiogenic factors; thus, they may play an important role in the pathogenesis of various diseases including atherosclerosis, diabetic retinopathy, rheumatoid arthritis, and cancer. The biological effects of FGF-1 and FGF-2 are mediated via binding to a family of receptor tyrosine kinases (2Johnson D.E. Williams L.T. Adv. Cancer Res. 1993; 60: 1-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (1178) Google Scholar) and to heparan sulfate proteoglycans (3Gallagher J.T. Eur. J. Clin. Chem. Clin. Biochem. 1994; 32: 239-247PubMed Google Scholar) present on the surface of most cell types. Although it is known that ligand binding stimulates FGF receptor tyrosine autophosphorylation and dimerization (4Bellot F. Crumley G. Kaplow J.M. Schlessinger J. Jaye M. Dionne C.A.

We are presently identifying and characterizing novel FGF-1-inducible genes in NIH 3T3 cells in order to gain further insight into the FGF-1 intracellular signal transduction pathway. The NIH 3T3 fibroblast cell line is particularly well suited for studies on FGF-1 signaling since these cells (i) are relatively easy to maintain and amplify, (ii) will enter a quiescent growth state when placed in medium containing a low serum concentration, (iii) express ∼105high affinity FGF receptors per cell (11Bottaro D.P.

We have identified numerous FGF-1-regulated genes using a PCR-based differential display technique. Four of these genes (phosphofructokinase, fatty acid synthase, Ca2+-ATPase, and FR-1) have been described to date (12Hsu D.K.W. Donohue P.J. Alberts G.F. Winkles J.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Chem. 1994; 269: 8604-8609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Here we report that FGF-1 stimulation of NIH 3T3 cells induces the expression of an immediate early gene encoding a novel putative serine/threonine kinase, which we have named Fnk, for FGF-inducible kinase. The deduced Fnk sequence is most closely related to members of the polo subfamily of serine/threonine protein kinases. fnk represents the third immediate early gene described to date that is predicted to encode a protein kinase likely to function primarily during the early G1stage of the mammalian cell cycle. Murine NIH 3T3 cells (American Type Culture Collection) were grown at 37°C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Mediatech) supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated bovine calf serum (Hyclone Laboratories) and a 1:100 dilution of a penicillin-streptomycin-fungizone solution (JRH Biosciences). The cells were expanded by trypsin-EDTA (JRH Biosciences) treatment and subculturing at a split ratio of 1:7 every 2-3 days. Subconfluent cells were incubated for ∼72 h in the above medium containing a reduced serum concentration (0.5%) to induce a relatively quiescent cell population. Cells were then either left untreated or treated for various times with either 10% calf serum or 0.5% calf serum supplemented with 10 ng/ml recombinant human FGF-1 (gift of W. Burgess, American Red Cross) and 5 units/ml heparin (Upjohn), 10% calf serum, 10 ng/ml PDGF-BB (Genzyme Corp.), 20 ng/ml EGF (Genzyme Corp.), 2 ng/ml TGF-β1 (R & D Systems), 20 ng/ml IGF-1 (Bachem), or 30 ng/ml PMA (Sigma). In some experiments, cells were treated with 10 μg/ml cycloheximide (Sigma) or 2 μg/ml actinomycin D (Calbiochem). Cells were harvested by trypsin-EDTA treatment, and total RNA was isolated using RNazol B (Tel-Test) or RNA Stat-60 (Tel-Test) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Tissues from newborn (1-5 days old) or adult FVB/N mice (Taconic Farms) were homogenized in RNA Stat-60 (3 ml of reagent/500 μg of tissue) using a Tissumizer (Tekmar). RNA concentrations were calculated from the absorbance at 260 nM. Total RNA (1 μg) isolated from serum-starved or FGF-1-stimulated cells was converted to cDNA using random hexamer primers (Boehringer Mannheim) as described (13Donohue P.J. Alberts G.F. Hampton B.S. Winkles J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8604-8609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The PCR conditions were identical to those we described previously (13Donohue P.J. Alberts G.F. Hampton B.S. Winkles J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8604-8609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The degenerate sense protein kinase domain primer was described previously by Wilks (14Wilks A.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1603-1607Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar) and is 5′-CGGATCCAC MG NGA YYT-3′, where M denotes A or C, N denotes all four bases, and Y denotes C or T. The degenerate antisense zinc finger domain primer has been described (12Hsu D.K.W. Donohue P.J. Alberts G.F. Winkles J.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 197: 1483-1491Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). An aliquot of each amplification mixture was subjected to electrophoresis in a 1.8% agarose gel, and DNA was visualized by ethidium bromide staining. / HaeIII restriction fragments (Clontech Laboratories) were used as size standards. The appropriate DNA fragment was excised, recovered using the freeze-squeeze method (15Tautz D. Renz M. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 14-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar), reamplified, and ligated into the cloning vector pCR1000 (Invitrogen Corp.). A mouse Balb/c 3T3 cell λgt10 cDNA library (gift of L. Lau, University of Illinois College of Medicine) was screened with the subcloned PCR-derived DNA fragment to obtain a larger cDNA clone. Briefly, the DNA fragment was labeled with [32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol, DuPont NEN) using a random primer labeling kit (Boehringer Mannheim). Approximately 1.8 × 105phage were plated at a density of 2 × 104plaque-forming units/150-mm dish using Escherichia coli C600 Hfl as host. Duplicate plaque lifts (Colony/Plaque Screen, DuPont) were hybridized and washed as described (13Donohue P.J. Alberts G.F. Hampton B.S. Winkles J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8604-8609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Five positive phage were purified by two additional rounds of screening. Purified λ clones were amplified on E. coli C600 Hfl and λ DNA isolated by polyethylene glycol/NaCl precipitation. The cDNA inserts were released from the λgt10 vector by EcoRI digestion and subcloned into the plasmid pGEM3Zf+ (Promega Corp.). A mouse BALB/c liver λ Fix II genomic library (gift of T. Lanahan, Johns Hopkins University) was screened with a 461-bp fragment derived from the 5′ end of the ∼2.2-kb cDNA to obtain additional 5′ sequence not present in the cDNA clones. Approximately 5 × 105phage were plated at a density of 2.5 × 104plaque-forming units/150-mm dish using E. coli C600 Hfl as host. Filter hybridization and washing was performed as described above, and two positive phage were plaque-purified. DNA was isolated, and a ∼1.2-kb fragment released by BglII digestion of one genomic clone was subcloned into the BamHI site of pGEM3Zf+. Plasmid DNA was purified using a Magic Miniprep Kit (Promega Corp.), and both strands of the entire ∼2.2-kb cDNA insert and the 5′ 329 bp of the BglII genomic DNA restriction fragment were sequenced by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method. Sequencing was either done automatically using an Applied Biosystems model 373A DNA sequencer or manually using a Sequenase 2.0 kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). The nucleic acid and deduced protein sequences were compared with sequences in the data base server at the National Center for Biotechnology using the tBlastn and B10-357 programs. Protein sequences were aligned using a Genetics Computer Group software package. Ten μg of each RNA sample was denatured and subjected to electrophoresis in 1.2% agarose gels containing 2.2 M formaldehyde. The gels were routinely stained with ethidium bromide to verify that each lane contained similar amounts of undegraded rRNA. RNA was electroblotted onto Zetabind nylon membranes (Cuno, Inc.) and cross-linked by UV irradiation using a Stratalinker (Stratagene). Radiolabeling of the cDNA insert as well as membrane hybridization and washing were performed as described above for library screening. In some experiments, we verified that similar amounts of RNA were applied to each lane by rehybridizing the membranes with a human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA insert. This insert was an 800-bp PstI/ XbaI fragment of pHcGAP (American Type Culture Collection). RNA isolated from serum-starved or FGF-1-stimulated NIH 3T3 cells was converted to cDNA using reverse transcriptase and random primers. PCR was then performed using a degenerate sense protein kinase domain primer and a degenerate antisense zinc finger domain primer. Amplification products were displayed using agarose gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining. The pattern of amplified cDNAs obtained from quiescent and FGF-1-stimulated cellular RNA were, for the most part, similar (Fig. 1 A). However, two DNA fragments, ∼200 bp and ∼800 bp in size, were amplified to a greater degree when cDNA representing the RNA isolated from cells treated with FGF-1 was used as template. Characterization of the larger DNA fragment will be the subject of another report.2 2P. J. Donohue and J. A. Winkles, manuscript in preparation. The ∼200-bp fragment was excised from the gel, reamplified, and subcloned. Initial RNA gel blot hybridization experiments indicated that this DNA fragment hybridized to an FGF-1- and serum-inducible ∼2.4-kb transcript. Therefore, to isolate larger cDNA clones, the DNA fragment was radiolabeled and used to screen a λgt10 cDNA library prepared by Lau and Nathans (16Lau L.F. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1182-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar) using RNA isolated from serum-treated Balb/c 3T3 cells. Five positive phage were isolated, and their cDNA inserts were subcloned. All inserts were ∼2.2 kb in size; one of these inserts was sequenced in its entirety and also used as a probe for RNA gel blot hybridization experiments. Based on these results, described in detail below, the gene and the corresponding protein represented by the cloned cDNA have been named fnk and Fnk, for FGF-inducible kinase. RNA gel blot hybridization analysis using RNA isolated from serum-starved or FGF-1-treated NIH 3T3 cells was then performed to confirm the differential display results indicating that fnk was an FGF-1-inducible gene. A single Fnk transcript of ∼2.4 kb was rapidly and transiently expressed following FGF-1 stimulation; maximum levels were detected at 1 h, and expression returned to basal levels by 8 h (Fig. 1 B). The structurally and functionally related mitogen FGF-2 increased Fnk mRNA levels to the same degree with identical kinetics (data not shown). It should be noted that in this time course experiment, as well as in others (e.g. Fig. 3, A and B), a slight decrease in the apparent size of Fnk mRNA is detected between 0.5 and 1 h after cellular stimulation. The mechanism responsible for this decrease is unknown. However, Fnk mRNA is only transiently expressed, and its 3′-untranslated region contains AU-rich motifs (see below); consequently, it may have a relatively short half-life (17Lagnado C.A. Brown C.Y. Goodall G.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7984-7995Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). It is possible that the decrease in Fnk mRNA size reflects deadenylation prior to transcript degradation (17Lagnado C.A. Brown C.Y. Goodall G.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7984-7995Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). The effect of the RNA synthesis inhibitor actinomycin D on FGF-1 induction of Fnk mRNA levels was then examined. Serum-starved NIH 3T3 cells were left untreated or treated with FGF-1 alone, both FGF-1 and actinomycin D, or actinomycin D alone for 0.5, 1, 2, or 4 h. Cells were collected, RNA was isolated, and Fnk mRNA levels were analyzed by RNA gel blot hybridization. Actinomycin D treatment prevented the FGF-1 induction of Fnk mRNA (Fig. 2 A); thus, the increase in Fnk mRNA expression after FGF-1 addition is due, at least in part, to transcriptional activation of the fnk gene. We next used the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide to determine whether FGF-1 induction of Fnk mRNA levels was dependent on de novo protein synthesis. Serum-starved cells were either left untreated or treated with FGF-1 alone, both FGF-1 and cycloheximide, or cycloheximide alone for 0.5, 1, 2, or 4 h. RNA was isolated, and RNA gel blot hybridization analysis was performed. The addition of cycloheximide to FGF-1-stimulated cells did not prevent fnk gene induction but instead “superinduced” Fnk mRNA levels (Fig. 2 B). This indicates that the fnk gene does not require protein synthesis for transcriptional activation; thus, by this criterion, it can be classified as a growth factor-regulated immediate early gene. The effect of whole calf serum, individual serum growth factors, or phorbol ester treatment on Fnk mRNA levels was then studied. Serum-starved NIH 3T3 cells were either left untreated or treated for various lengths of time with calf serum, PMA, or various purified growth factors. Cells were collected, RNA was isolated, and Fnk mRNA levels were analyzed by RNA gel blot hybridization. Both serum and the phorbol ester PMA, a potent activator of protein kinase C (18Castagna M. Takai Y. Kaibuchi K. Sano K. Kikkawa U. Nishizuka Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7847-7851Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), increased Fnk mRNA levels with kinetics similar to those observed after FGF-1 treatment (Fig. 3, A and B). PDGF-BB treatment also increased Fnk mRNA levels to the same extent as FGF-1; in contrast, TGF-β1, EGF, or IGF-1 treatment increased Fnk mRNA expression only slightly above basal levels (Fig. 3 C). Both strands of the ∼2.2-kb Fnk cDNA insert were sequenced by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method. The nucleotide sequence contained a long open reading frame encoding a protein of 609 amino acids, but an initiating ATG methionine codon was not present. Partial DNA sequence analysis of the other four Fnk cDNA clones isolated in the original library screen indicated that they did not contain additional 5′ coding sequence. Furthermore, full-length Fnk cDNA clones could not be obtained by screening additional murine cDNA libraries. Therefore, a mouse liver genomic DNA library was screened using a 461-bp 5′ restriction fragment of the Fnk cDNA. Positive phage were plaque-purified, and DNA was isolated. Southern blot hybridization analysis identified a ∼1.2-kb BglII fragment that was likely to encode additional amino-terminal protein sequence. DNA sequence analysis indicated that 302-bp of this fragment represented new 5′ sequence not present in the cDNA. The composite nucleotide and deduced protein sequences of Fnk are shown in Fig. 4. The nucleotide sequence contains a long open reading frame that encodes a protein of 631 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 69,995 daltons. The presumed initiating ATG is flanked by a favorable sequence for translation initiation (19Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 887-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar, 20Grunert S.

The cDNA clone contained a 335-nucleotide 3′-untranslated region with a consensus polyadenylation signal and three copies of a TTATTTAT sequence motif. AU-rich sequence elements are found in the 3′-untranslated regions of many immediate early mRNAs and may be responsible for their rapid decay rate (17Lagnado C.A. Brown C.Y. Goodall G.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7984-7995Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Comparison of the PCR primer sequences with the ∼2.2-kb Fnk cDNA sequence identified the two regions that flanked the original PCR-derived ∼200-bp cDNA clone. The sense protein kinase and antisense zinc finger oligonucleotides had ∼76 and ∼65% nucleotide sequence identity, respectively, to sequences within the Fnk coding region. Analysis of the Fnk predicted amino acid sequence indicates that this protein does in fact have a protein kinase catalytic domain but not a zinc finger motif (see below). A search of the sequence data bases revealed that the deduced amino acid sequence of Fnk was most similar to members of the polo subfamily of serine/threonine protein kinases. Specifically, there is 49, 36, 33, 32, and 22% overall sequence identity to mouse Snk (21Simmons D.L. Neel B.G. Stevens R. Evett G. Erikson R.L. Mol. Cell.

An alignment of the deduced Fnk amino acid sequence and the three most structurally similar polo subfamily members is shown in Fig. 5. Two regions of relatively high amino acid sequence identity are apparent, the protein kinase catalytic domain located in the amino-terminal half of the proteins and a region in the carboxyl-terminal half termed the polo homology 2 domain by Hamanaka et al. (23Hamanaka R. Maloid S. Smith M.R. O'Connell C.D. Longo D.L. Ferris D.K. Cell Growth & Differ. 1994; 5: 249-257PubMed Google Scholar). This latter domain is present in all members of the polo subfamily except for Sak. The catalytic domain of Fnk consists of 253 amino acids and includes features characteristic of protein kinases in general and serine/threonine-specific kinases in particular (28Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Hunter T. Science. 1988; 241: 42-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (3826) Google Scholar, 29Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 38-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar). Within this domain, the amino acid sequence identity between Fnk and Snk, Plk, polo, Cdc5, or Sak-a is 67, 52, 50, 45, and 41%, respectively. Fnk contains the amino acid residues that are most highly conserved in all known protein kinases; for example, a K residue in subdomain II (amino acid 92), an E residue in subdomain III (amino acid 111), and the DFG sequence in subdomain VII (amino acids 204 to 206). However, the consensus G XG XXG XV sequence present in many nucleotide-binding proteins is present as G XG XXA XC (amino acids 69-76) in Fnk. The G → A and V → C substitutions are found in all polo subfamily members except for Sak as well as in several other protein kinases (28Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Hunter T. Science. 1988; 241: 42-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (3826) Google Scholar, 29Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 38-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar). Finally, Fnk contains two sequence motifs that structurally distinguish serine/threonine-specific kinases from tyrosine-specific kinases (28Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Hunter T. Science. 1988; 241: 42-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (3826) Google Scholar, 29Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 38-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar). The DLKLGN sequence present in subdomain VIb and the GTPNYVAPE sequence present in subdomain VIII are similar to the DLKP XN and GTP XYL XPE consensus sequences commonly found in serine/threonine kinases. We next used RNA gel blot hybridization analysis to examine the tissue distribution of Fnk mRNA. Six different tissues were obtained from newborn animals, and 12 different tissues were obtained from adult animals. In the newborn animals, Fnk transcripts were expressed at a low level in the heart but at moderate or high levels in intestine, kidney, liver, lung, and skin (Fig. 6 A). In the adult animals, Fnk mRNA was expressed at a high level in skin but was undetectable or expressed at a low level in all of the other tissues examined (Fig. 6 B). These results indicate that fnk gene expression is regulated in vivo in both an age- and tissue-specific manner. One of the cellular responses that occurs following mitogenic stimulation of quiescent cells is the transcriptional activation of the immediate early and delayed early gene families (30Herschman H.R.

Here we show that dynamin is one of three synaptic terminal proteins that bind with specificity to the appendage domain of α-adaptin. Binding is sensitive to both salt and pH levels but is not affected by nucleotides. Using recombinant dynamin expressed in SF9 cells, we estimate that the binding affinity is ∼200 nM.

These results suggest that the COOH terminus of α-adaptin may be a domain within AP2 that mediates the initial interactions between dynamin and surface-coated pits.

It is a single chain glycoprotein with an apparent molecular weight of 33,000 and an isoelectric point of pH 5.2. It specifically activates plasminogen through an enzymatic reaction. The activation of human native Glu-plasminogen by TSV-PA is due to a single cleavage of the molecule at the peptide bond Arg561-Val562.

On the other hand, TSV-PA shows only 21-23% sequence similarity with the catalytic domains of u-PA and t-PA.

The native form of human plasminogen present in blood and in many tissue fluids is a single-chain glycoprotein with a molecular weight of 93,000, characterized by a N-terminal glutamic acid (Glu-plasminogen).1( 1The abbreviations used are: Glu-plasminogennative Glu1-plasminogenLys-plasminogenplasmin-derived Lys78-plasminogenu-PAurokinase-type plasminogen activatort-PAtissue-type plasminogen activatorTSV-PATrimeresurus stejnegeri venom plasminogen activatorFPLCfast performance liquid chromatographyPMSFphenylmethanesulfonyl fluorideNPGBp-nitrophenyl- p-guanidinobenzoatePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisPCRpolymerase chain reactionRACE-RT-PCRrapid amplification of cDNA ends-reverse transcription polymerase chain reactionRVV-VVipera russelli venom factor V activatorACC-CAgkistrodon contortrix contortrix venom protein C activatorPAI-1plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1pNAp-nitroanilideBzbenozyl.) A modified form, Lys-plasminogen, is generated by plasmin by cleavage of the Lys77-Lys78 or Lys78-Val79 bond of Glu-plasminogen (Robbins et al., 1967Robbins K.C. Summaria L. Hsieh B. Shah R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 2333-2342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The main physiological function of plasmin is fibrinolysis. Conversion of plasminogen to plasmin, however, also plays a role in various other processes, such as ovulation, spermatogenesis, embryonic development, involution of mammary glands, prohormone processing, and tumor cell invasion (Dano et al., 1985Dano K.

In all mammalian species so far investigated, two distinct plasminogen activators have been identified, urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA, Mr 55,000) and tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA, Mr 65,000). They are both serine proteases with similar structural and catalytic properties. Both enzymes cleave plasminogen, either Glu-plasminogen or Lys-plasminogen, at the Arg561-Val562 bond and generate plasmin, a serine protease with broad proteolytic activity. However, important functional differences exist between the two plasminogen activators. Whereas t-PA binds to fibrin, an interaction that dramatically increases its catalytic activity for clot-bound plasminogen (Hoylaerts et al., 1982Hoylaerts M. Rijken D.C. Lijnen H.R. Collen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2912-2919Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), u-PA binds to specific membrane receptors of a variety of normal and transformed cell types (Blasi et al., 1987Blasi F. Vassali J.D. Dano K. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 801-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar; Del Rosso et al., 1985Del Rosso M. Dini G. Fibbi G.

The activity of u-PA is thus localized at the cell surface, while that of t-PA is mainly directed against fibrin. Accordingly, the two plasminogen activators have distinct physiological roles. Envenomations of mammals, including humans, by snakes, especially by those belonging to the Crotalidae and Viperidae families, are characterized by an inhibition of blood coagulation due to the action of fibrino(geno)lytic enzymes. This might be also caused by the activation of plasminogen into plasmin by venom components; however, none of the proteases from snake venoms that have been purified and studied until now are able to activate plasminogen in vitro (Stocker, 1990Stocker K. Stocker K. Medical Use of Snake Venom Proteins. CRC Press, Boston1990: 97-160Google Scholar). In a previous study, it was observed that Trimeresurus stejnegeri venom significantly activates human plasminogen in vitro (Zhang et al., 1993Zhang Y. Xiong Y.L. Bon C. Asiatic Herpetological Res. 1993; 5: 117-126Google Scholar). This report precisely describes the purification of a plasminogen activator (TSV-PA) which is responsible for this activity from T. stejnegeri venom. The major molecular and physiological properties of TSV-PA were characterized. The cDNA sequence encoding TSV-PA and the deduced amino acid sequence were also obtained and are reported here. This plasminogen activator is the first snake venom protease which specifically activates plasminogen. Materials T. stejnegeri venom was from the stock of the Kunming Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences. The products for gel filtration and FPLC, Sephadex G-75 (Superfine), and Mono-Q 16/10 column were from LKB Pharmacia. p-Nitroanilide chromogenic substrates, H-DPhe-Pip-Arg- pNA (S-2238), H-DVal-Leu-Lys- pNA (S-2251), H-DPro-Phe-Arg- pNA (S-2302), Bz-Ile-Glu-Gly-Arg- pNA (S-2222), and H-DVal-Leu-Arg- pNA (S-2266), were obtained from Kabi Vitrum (Stockholm, Sweden); H-DLys(Cbo)-Pro-Arg- pNA (CBS-6525) was from Diagnostica Stago (Asnières, France). Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), PMSF, p-nitrophenyl- p-guanidinobenzoate (NPGB), iodoacetamide, benzamidine, p-aminobenzamidine, aprotinin, soybean trypsin inhibitor (type I-S), and bovine serum albumin (fatty-acid free) were purchased from Sigma. PAGE gels and reagents for Phastsystem (fast PAGE system) were obtained from LKB Pharmacia. All other reagents were of the highest purity available from Merck or Prolabo (Paris, France). Proteins were from human origin except when indicated. Prothrombin, Lys-plasminogen, urokinase (two-chain form, Mr 33,000), plasmin, anti-thrombin III, factor X (bovine), and streptokinase (Streptococcus) were obtained from Sigma. Purified Glu-plasminogen was a gift from Dr. Eduardo Angles-Cano (INSERM U.143, le Kremlin Bictre, France). Protein C, t-PA, and fibrin CNBr fragments (t-PA stimulator) were obtained from Diagnostica Stago. Fibrinogen (grade L) from Kabi Vitrum was pretreated with diisopropyl fluorophosphate according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The absence of plasminogen was confirmed by incubating the fibrinogen for 6 h at 37°C with streptokinase (1000 units+mg-1 fibrinogen): no evidence of degradation was found by SDS-PAGE. The concentration of plasminogen was determined by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm, using E1% = 16.8 (Wallén and Wiman, 1972Wallén P. Wiman B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 257: 122-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Methods The amidolytic activity of the enzymes was measured with a Kontron spectrophotometer in 1-cm path length plastic cuvettes. Assays were performed in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 0.01% Tween 80 in a total volume of 500 μl. The reactions were initiated by the addition of the enzyme at a final concentration of 18 nM and the formation of p-nitroaniline was monitored continuously at 405 nm. The amount of substrate hydrolyzed was calculated from the absorbance at 405 nm by using a molar extinction coefficient of 10,000 M-1+cm-1 for free p-nitroaniline. The kinetic parameters Kmand kcat were determined by analysis of double-reciprocal plots of the initial velocity as a function of substrate concentration. SDS-PAGE, native-PAGE, and isoelectric focusing were performed in a Phastsystem apparatus (LKB Pharmacia) following the manufacturer's directions and recommended separation methods. For SDS-PAGE, samples were pretreated in 2.5% SDS alone (nonreducing conditions) or in 2.5% SDS and 5%β-mercaptoethanol (reducing conditions) at 100°C for 10 min. Gels were stained with 0.1% Coomassie Brilliant Blue R in methanol/acetic acid/water (3/1/6) and destained in the same solution. The molecular weights were estimated by interpolation from a linear semilogarithmic plot of relative molecular mass versus distance of migration, using the following proteins as standards: phosphorylase b (94, 0), bovine serum albumin (67, 0), ovalbumin (43, 0), carbonic anhydrase (Paoni et al., 1993Paoni N.F. Chow A.M. Pena L.C. Keyt M.A. Zoller M.J. Bennett W.F. Protein Eng. 1993; 6: 529-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 0), soybean trypsin inhibitor (Keijer et al., 1991Keijer J. Linders M. van Zonneveld A.J. Ehrlich H.J. de Boer J.P. Pannekoek H. Blood. 1991; 78: 401-409Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 100), and α-lactalbumin (Hofmann and Bon, 1987aHofmann H. Bon C. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 772-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 400). For isoelectric focusing, protein markers were used for calibration of the gel (isoelectric focusing calibration kit, Pharmacia). Gels were fixed with 20% trichloroacetic acid, stained in methanol/acetic acid/water (3/1/6) containing 0.02% Coomassie Brilliant Blue R and 0.1% CuSO4, and destained as described above. The initial rate of plasminogen activation was measured with a Kontron spectrophotometer. Glu-plasminogen or Lys-plasminogen was incubated at a final concentration of 1.3 μM in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 0.01% Tween 80. The reaction was initiated by the addition of TSV-PA at a final concentration of 15-120 nM, in a total reaction volume of 250 μl. Aliquots (50 μl) were taken at various time intervals and assayed for plasmin activity. They were introduced into plastic cuvettes which contained 450 μl of S-2251 (0.3 mM) in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 0.01% Tween 80 and the formation of p-nitroaniline was monitored at 405 nm. One unit of activity was defined as the amount of TSV-PA which, activating plasminogen during 1 min under the conditions above, produced a plasmin amidolytic activity of 1 milliabsorbance unit per min. Fibrinogen was incubated in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, at a final concentration of 5 mg+ml-1 with TSV-PA (final concentration 6-120 nM), in the presence or absence of Lys-plasminogen (final concentration 1.3 μM), at 37°C for different time intervals. Thrombin (final concentration 2.5 NIH units+ml-1) was then added and incubation was continued at room temperature for 15 min to allow the formation of the fibrin clot. The clot was centrifuged at 3,200 × g for 20 min and the protein content of the supernatant was determined by the method of Folin (Lowry et al., 1951Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Glu-plasminogen (11 μM) was incubated with TSV-PA (1.2 μM) or urokinase (2.4 μM) in 50 mM Tris-HCI, pH 7.8, in the presence of soybean trypsin inhibitor (7.1 μM, in the case of TSV-PA) or aprotinin (10 TIU+ml-1, in the case of u-PA) at 37°C for various times. Aliquots (5 μl) were taken to determine the amidolytic activity on S-2251 in 500 μl (final volume) of 50 mM Tris-HCI, pH 7.8, containing 0.01% Tween 80. Samples were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The effects of various protease inhibitors specific for different classes of proteases were examined. Stock solutions of inhibitors were freshly prepared as follows: NPGB and PMSF were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide, hirudin, antithrombin III, soybean trypsin inhibitor, aprotinin, p-aminobenzamidine, iodoacetamide, benzamidine, and EDTA were dissolved in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 0.1 M NaCl. TSV-PA (18 nM) was incubated 30 min at room temperature in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, in the absence or presence of the inhibitors at the indicated concentrations. The initial rate of amidolysis was measured after addition of 50 μl of 2 mM S-2238. In the case of NPGB, PMSF, L-cysteine, and iodoacetamide, mixtures containing 0.6 μM TSV-PA in the absence or presence of the indicated concentrations of the inhibitors were incubated for 30 min at 37°C, then 15-μl aliquots were taken to determine amidolytic activity on S-2238. Assays for activation of prothrombin and factor X were performed according to the methods described by Hofmann and Bon, 1987bHofmann H. Bon C. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 780-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 1987b). Purified prothrombin (0.7 μM) was incubated at 37°C in 50 mM Tris-HCI, pH 7.8, 0.1 M NaCl with TSV-PA (60 nM). Aliquots (50 μl) were taken at various times and their amidolytic activity was assayed in 500 μl (final volume) of the same buffer containing 0.2 mM S-2238. Purified factor X (bovine) (0.43 μM) was incubated at 37°C in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 0.1 M NaCl, containing 5 mM CaCl2 with TSV-PA (60 nM). Aliquots (50 μl) were taken at various times and their amidolytic activity was immediately assayed in 500 μl of 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 0.1 M NaCl, containing 0.2 mM S-2222. After incubating prothrombin or factor X (bovine) with TSV-PA for 3 h at 37°C and at a molar ratio of 50/1, samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE both under reducing and nonreducing conditions. In these experiments, Bothrops atrox venom was used as a positive control for activation and cleavage (Hofmann and Bon, 1987aHofmann H. Bon C. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 772-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 1987b). Protein C activation was assayed by the method described by Orthner et al., 1988Orthner C.L. Bhattacharya P. Strickland D.K. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 2558-2564Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar: protein C (80 nM) was incubated with TSV-PA (60 nM) in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, containing 1 mg+ml-1 polyethylene glycol and 5 mM EDTA at 37°C. At various times, aliquots (50 μl) were taken to determine the amidolytic activity on CBS65-25 (final concentration 0.3 mM). In parallel, A. contortrix contortrix venom was used as a positive activation control (Kisiel et al., 1987Kisiel W. Kondo S. Smith K.J. McMullen B.A. Smith L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12607-12613Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sequence determinations of proteins and peptides were performed by Edman degradation with a 470A gas-phase sequencer. Phenylthiohydantoin-derivatives were separated and identified by on-line reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography in an RP18 column, with an Applied Biosystem 120-A analyzer. For internal amino acid sequence of TSV-PA, the purified protein was digested with trypsin, and the resultant digested fragments were separated by high pressure liquid chromatography in a C8 column. For determination of the cleavage site of plasminogen by TSV-PA, plasmin chains generated by TSV-PA were first submitted to SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred to an Immobilon membrane. The protein bands were analyzed with the protein sequencer. On the basis of the determined N-terminal and internal peptide sequences of TSV-PA, and the analysis of genetic code usage for the published venom protease cDNA sequences, corresponding to batroxobin (Itoh et al., 1987Itoh N. Tanaka N. Mihashi S. Yamashina I. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3132-3135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and ancrod (Au et al., 1993Au L.C. Lin S.B. Chou J.S. Teh G.W. Chang K.J. Shih C.M. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 387-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), two oligonucleotide primers, P1 and P4R, were designed for the amplification of a cDNA internal fragment by PCR. Primer P1 (5′-CTTGTAGTCTTGTTCAA(CT)TCTAACGG-3′) is oriented in the sense direction and corresponds to the N-terminal residues 15-23 of TSV-PA. Primer P4R (5′-ACAGATGAGGGGTCCCCCAGAGTC-3′) is oriented in the antisense direction and corresponds to TSV-PA residues 179-186. Total RNA was prepared from T. stejnegeri venom glands according to the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi, 1987Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62787) Google Scholar. Single-stranded cDNAs were prepared from the mRNAs contained in total RNA (5 μg) by reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.), using an oligo-d(T)18 primer. A first amplification by PCR with the primers P1 and P4R was carried out using Taq polymerase (Promega), under the following conditions: a first step of 5 min at 94°C was followed by 30 cycles of 1 min at 94°C, 1 min at 60°C, and 1 min at 72°C. From the cDNA fragment sequence obtained from the first PCR amplification, two TSV-PA specific primers, P2 (5′-CAGTTGCTGTTTGGTGTG-3′) and P2R (5′-CACACCAAACAGCAACTG-3′), oriented in the sense (P2) or the antisense (P2R) direction and corresponding to TSV-PA residues 48-53, were defined. They were used in 5′ and 3′ RACE-RT-PCR to obtain the full-length cDNA sequence encoding TSV-PA, as essentially described by Frohman, 1990Frohman M.A. Amplifications. 1990; 5: 11-15Google Scholar with the following modifications. In the case of 5′ RACE-RT-PCR amplification, the reverse transcription was performed by using primer P4R, and an oligonucleotide T (5′-GATCCCCTATAGTGAGTCG-3′) was ligated to the 3′ end of the first cDNA strand. Then a first PCR amplification was carried out by using primers Ro (5′-AAGGATCCGTCGACATC-3′) and P4R in the presence of an adaptor primer E (5′-AAGGATCCGTCGACATCGATAATACGACTCACTATAGGG-3′) which contains the sequences of primers Ro, R1 (5′-GACATCGATAATACGAC-3′), and the reverse complementary sequence of oligonucleotide T. This PCR amplification was followed by a second one carried out using primers R1 and P2R. For amplification of the 3′-end, the reverse transcription was performed by using oligonucleotide primer E with an additional 3′ poly(T)18 tail. Two consecutive PCR amplifications were then carried out using primers Ro and P1, and primers R1 and P2. All oligonucleotide primers were synthetized by Genset Laboratory (Paris, France). PCR products were subcloned by the dideoxythymidine-tailed vector method into a pGEM vector (Promega). DNA sequencing was performed by the dideoxy termination method using a T7 sequencing kit (LKB Pharmacia). mRNAs were prepared from the total RNA of T. stejnegeri venom glands by oligo(dT) cellulose chromatography. A directional cDNA library was constructed with a plasmid cloning kit (SuperScript plasmid system, Life Technologies, Inc.) with some modifications. Size-selected cDNAs were ligated to pT7T3D EcoRI/ NotI/BAP Phagemid vector arms (LKB Pharmacia) and used to transform MAX efficiency DH10B competent cells, producing a library of about 4 × 104 independent colonies. A PCR-based method for high stringency screening of DNA libraries (Israel, 1993Israel D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2627-2631Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) was used for screening and isolating TSV-PA clones. Two TSV-PA specific primers, P2 as described previously and P3R (5′-GCCACCTGCCGCCATGAATAAGC-3′) corresponding to TSV-PA residues 153-160 in the antisense orientation, and a vector T7 promoter primer located 5′ of the cloned insert, were used in PCR reactions. The presence of an insert encoding TSV-PA and its size were examined by PCR analysis between P2-P3R and T7-P3R, under the following conditions: 5 min at 94°C, followed by 30 cycles of 1 min at 94°C, 1 min at 55°C, 1 min at 72°C. The bacterium library was titered. The culture was diluted with LB broth/100 μg+ml-1 ampicilline, plated in an 8 × 8 matrix (64 wells total, 100 μl/well) in a 96-well multiwell plate (Costar), and amplified at 37°C overnight. Titers of approximately 500 and 30 bacteria/well were used for the first round screening and the second round screening, respectively. Aliquots of amplified bacteria from 8 wells across a row or 8 wells down a column were pooled. The matrix of 64 wells was thus reduced to 16 pools which were used as templates for PCR analysis, as described above. Bacteria from positive wells in the second round screening were plated out. Single colonies were picked out and analyzed by PCR to obtain individual positive clones. Computer analysis of protein sequences and nucleotide acid sequences were performed with the Clustal V sequence software package. The progress of the purification was followed by determining the following for each fraction: activation of Lys-plasminogen, amidolytic activities on S-2238 and S-2251, fibrinogen clotting activity, fibrinogenolytic activity, procoagulant and anti-coagulant activities, activation and inhibition of platelet aggregation, and finally phospholipase A2 activity. The methods used to assay platelet aggregation and phospholipase A2 were those as described by Born, 1962Born G.V.R. Nature. 1962; 194: 927-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (3733) Google Scholar and Lôbo de Araujo and Radvanyi, 1987Lôbo de Araujo A. Radvanyi F. Toxicon. 1987; 25: 1181-1188Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, respectively. Gel filtration of T. stejnegeri venom in Sephadex G-75 resulted in the separation of seven protein peaks (Fig. 1 A). The plasminogen activation activity was predominantly associated with fraction IV and was separated from procoagulant and phospholipase A2 activities. Furthermore, no plasminogen activation activity was found in other fractions. Phospholipase A2 activity and inhibition of the platelet aggregation induced by thrombin were concentrated in fractions V to VII; fibrinogen clotting activity was found in fraction II, and fraction III showed a strong fibrinogenolytic activity (not shown in Fig. 1A for clarity). Fraction IV, containing the activity for plasminogen activation, was dialyzed against 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, for 24 h and applied on a FPLC Mono-Q preparative column (HR 16/10) equilibrated with the same buffer. Elution was achieved with a linear NaCl gradient, yielding 12 protein peaks (Fig. 1 B). The plasminogen activation activity was concentrated in peak 7, associated with amidolytic activities on S-2238 and S-2251. SDS-PAGE revealed that fraction 7 contained a major polypeptide of Mr 30,000 ± 3000, in both reducing and nonreducing conditions. PAGE carried out in native conditions revealed, however, the presence of other small protein components. Peak 7, obtained from the Mono-Q column run at pH 7.8, was pooled, lyophilized, dissolved in water, and dialyzed for 24 h against 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.8. The sample was again applied to a Mono-Q preparative column (HR 16/10), eluted with a shallow linear NaCl gradient. Four peaks were thus obtained. The plasminogen activation activity was only found in the largest one, peak 4 (Fig. 1 C), associated again with amidolytic activities on S-2238 and S-2251. This protein fraction is referred to as TSV-PA. On the other hand, peak 1 had no proteolytic activity, while peaks 2 and 3 possessed amidolytic activity on S-2238, but not on S-2251. The purification procedure of TSV-PA is summarized in Table I. TSV-PA was purified 200-fold from crude venom, with a yield higher than 40%. It represents a minor component of the venom, about 0.5% of total venom proteins. Fig. 2A shows the SDS-PAGE analysis of the samples from the various steps of the purification. The purified TSV-PA appeared as a single band and therefore consisted of a single polypeptide chain of 33,000. Purified TSV-PA was also analyzed by PAGE in native conditions (Fig. 2 B) and by isoelectric focusing (Fig. 2 C). It appeared as a homogeneous protein in both conditions, with an apparent isoelectric point of 5.2. PAGE, combined with Schiff's reagent staining (Van-Seuningen and Davril, 1992Van-Seuningen I. Davril M. Electrophoresis. 1992; 13: 97-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), showed that TSV-PA is a glycoprotein. Purified TSV-PA possesses amidolytic activity toward several synthetic substrates. A detailed investigation was carried out by measuring the reaction velocities at different substrate concentrations and determining the Kmand kcat parameters of TSV-PA by Lineweaver-Burk plots for the following synthetic substrates: S-2238, S-2251, and S-2302. Among the compounds tested, S-2238 was the best substrate for TSV-PA (Table II). It can be seen from these studies that TSV-PA has a preference for arginine over lysine at the position that is cleaved. But TSV-PA also differentiates among substrates possessing an arginine at the cleavage site, since its activity was 30-fold lower with S-2302 than with S-2238, whereas its amidolytic activity on S-2222, which is very sensitive to trypsin, was 250-fold lower than on S-2238 (data not shown). In general, the amidolytic activities of u-PA and t-PA are much lower than that of TSV-PA on different chromogenic substrates (data not shown). For example, whereas TSV-PA hydrolyzed S-2251 significantly, u-PA had undetectable activity on this substrate in our assay system. The activation of human Glu- and Lys-plasminogen by TSV-PA was determined by measuring the amidolytic activity of activated plasminogen on S-2251. Fig. 3A shows that the initial rate of activation of human Glu- and Lys-plasminogen by TSV-PA was proportional to the concentration of the venom activator. In addition, the activation of Lys-plasminogen was 2-3-fold higher than that of Glu-plasminogen at the same concentration of TSV-PA. This difference was also observed in the case of plasminogen activation by t-PA (Fig. 3 B). The addition of CNBr fibrin fragments to the assay medium increased the rate of plasminogen activation of t-PA about 5-fold, as reported by Hoylaerts et al. (1982), but did not significantly modify the activation catalyzed by TSV-PA (Fig. 3 A). While the amidolytic activity of TSV-PA toward small peptide substrates is higher than that of t-PA, activation of plasminogen by TSV-PA was about 50-fold lower than that observed with t-PA stimulated by fibrin fragments. The catalytic cleavage of the human Glu-plasminogen polypeptide by TSV-PA was further investigated by SDS-PAGE. In these experiments, soybean trypsin inhibitor was added to the activation medium in order to prevent the proteolytic action of the plasmin generated, since the inhibitor blocks plasmin but not TSV-PA activity (Table III).

https://openalex.org/W1988885303,"Sphingosine 1-phosphate, a sphingolipid metabolite, was previously reported to increase DNA synthesis in quiescent Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts and to induce transient increases in intracellular free calcium (Zhang, H., Desai, N. N., Olivera, A., Seki, T., Brooker, G., and Spiegel, S. (1991) J. Cell Biol. 114, 155-167). In the present study, pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with pertussis toxin reduced sphingosine 1-phosphate-induced DNA synthesis. Sphingosine 1-phosphate decreased cellular cAMP levels and also caused a drastic decrease in isoproterenol- and forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation. Pertussis toxin treatment prevented the inhibitory effect of sphingosine 1-phosphate on cAMP accumulation, suggesting that a pertussis toxin-sensitive Gior Gi-like protein may be involved in sphingosine 1-phosphate-mediated inhibition of cAMP accumulation. Mitogenic concentrations of sphingosine 1-phosphate stimulated production of inositol phosphates which was inhibited by pertussis toxin, while the response to bradykinin was not affected. Furthermore, calcium release induced by sphingosine 1-phosphate, but not by bradykinin, was also attenuated by pertussis toxin treatment. However, sphingosine 1-phosphate-induced phosphatidic acid accumulation was unaffected by pertussis toxin. The increase in specific DNA binding activity of activator protein-1, which was induced by treatment of quiescent Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with sphingosine 1-phosphate, was also inhibited by pertussis toxin. These results suggest that some of the sphingosine 1-phosphate-induced signaling pathways are mediated by G proteins that are substrates for pertussis toxin."
https://openalex.org/W1999882817,"Alternate splicing of a single exon encoding an NH2-terminal immunoglobulin (Ig) disulfide loop in the ectodomain of the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) types 1 and 2 results in α and β isoforms that exhibit 3- and 2-Ig loops, respectively. Previously we demonstrated that alternately spliced Loop I has no independent ligand binding activity but is sufficiently interactive with the ligand- and heparin-binding site formed by Loops II and III to lower affinity for the same fibroblast growth factor (FGF) ligand. Here we show that a lower affinity of FGFR1α for heparin parallels the lower affinity for FGF-1. A mutant of FGFR1α in which the sequence between Loops I and II was deleted exhibits high affinity for both FGF-1 and heparin and other properties of the FGFR1β isoform, which include resistance to degradation by trypsin and display of specific antibody epitopes. This suggests that the interloop sequence facilitates the interaction of Loop I with Loops II and III. Lack of expression of both exons coding for Loop I and the sequence between Loops I and II in the FGFR2 gene characterizes rat prostate tumor cells, which exhibit a loss of the low affinity class of FGF receptors.

Loop II, the interloop sequence, and the NH2terminus of Loop III appear to comprise the minimal structure required for the binding of members of the FGF ligand family in general, while both the invariant core and COOH-terminal domains encoded in alternately spliced exons of Loop III determine specificity for particular FGF ligands (1Wang F. Kan M. Xu J. Yan G. McKeehan W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10222-10230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The NH2terminus of Loop II contributes a conserved heparan sulfate binding domain that is obligatory for ligand binding (2Kan M. Wang F. Xu J. Crabb J.W. Hou J. McKeehan W.L. Science. 1993; 259: 1918-1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Alternate splicing of a single exon in the FGFR1 and FGFR2 genes results in an isoform, FGFRα, which exhibits an additional Ig-like loop (Loop I) NH2-terminal to Loops II and III of the FGFRβ isoform (3Jaye M. Schlessinger J. Dionne C.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1135: 185-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). Only the 3-loop products of the FGFR3 and FGFR4 genes have been reported (3Jaye M. Schlessinger J. Dionne C.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1135: 185-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). The NH2-terminal Loop I is the least conserved domain among the FGFRα isoforms (21-38% relative to the 63-82% conservation between Loops II and III) (3Jaye M. Schlessinger J. Dionne C.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1135: 185-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). In the FGFRα isoform, Loops I and II are separated by an interloop sequence encoded by a single exon that exhibits a characteristic cluster of acidic residues called the “acidic box” (3Jaye M. Schlessinger J. Dionne C.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1135: 185-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). The sequence composes the NH2terminus of the FGFRβ isoform, which can be alternately spliced (3Jaye M. Schlessinger J. Dionne C.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1135: 185-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). Both the natural variants of FGFR2β and mutants of FGFR1β with a deletion of all or a portion of the exon coding for the acidic box sequence had no qualitative effects on ligand binding (3Jaye M.

However, the presence of Loop I causes recombinant FGFR1α to exhibit an affinity for FGF-1 that is 12.5% of that of the FGFR1β isoform in the presence of heparin and complete loss of binding to FGF-1 in the absence of the glycosaminoglycan (6Shi E. Kan M. Xu J. Wang F. Hou J. McKeehan W.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3907-3918Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The fact that distal antibody epitopes within Loop I, the inter-Loop II/III sequence, and the COOH terminus of Loop III are masked in specifically native FGFR1α relative to denatured FGFR1α or FGFR1β suggested that Loop I and Loops II and III are sufficiently interactive to affect both the interaction of glycosaminoglycan and ligand with the 2-loop structure (7Xu J.

Here we report that FGFR1α and FGFR1β exhibit differences in affinity for heparin that parallel the differences in affinity for FGF-1. Deletion of the interloop sequence between Loops I and II caused reversion of multiple properties (affinity for heparin and FGF, lability to trypsin, display of antibody epitopes) of the FGFR1α isoform to those of the FGFR1β isoform despite the presence of the Loop I structure. We show that lack of expression of both exons coding for Loop I and the sequence between Loops I and II in the FGFR2 gene in prostate tumor cells correlates with the loss of low affinity binding sites. Although the interloop sequence is alternately spliced in the FGFR2β isoform, the two exons are expressed coordinately in the FGFRα variant, which results in unique properties of the isoform. The following oligonucleotide primer sequences (5′ to 3′) were synthesized on an ABI PCRMATE DNA synthesizer (Applied Biosystems, Inc., Foster City, CA): P1a, atatgaattcCGAGCTCACTGTGGAGTATCCATG; ADP1, TTTGGTGTTATCTGTTTCTTTCGAGGAGGGGAGAGCATC; ADP2, AAAGAAACAGATAACACCAAA; P1b, GACCTTGTAGCCTCCAATTCTGTGG; ADP3, TCCGTCAATGTTTCACCCGTAGCTCCATAT; and ADP4, ATATGGAGCTACGGGTGAAACATTGACGGA. Residues not in human FGFR1 cDNA are indicated in lowercase, and restriction sites are indicated in boldface. Mutant cDNA fragments for construction of FGFR1α(ΔA) (see Fig. 1) were generated by previously described methods (1Wang F. Kan M. Xu J. Yan G. McKeehan W.L. J. Biol.

Mutant fragments for construction of FGFR1α(ΔAE) were generated between P1a and ADP3 and between ADP4 and P1b. After digestion with BglI and BstXI, the mutant cDNAs were ligated with flanking FGFR1 cDNA sequences at BglI and BstXI sites and cloned into pBlueScript SK vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) at EcoRI and SalI sites. The resulting 1222- and 1273-base pair (bp) cDNAs were recovered by partial digestion with EcoRI and cloned into mammalian expression vectors p91023B and the baculovirus transfer vector pVL1393 at EcoRI sites. Recombinant baculoviruses bearing mutant FGFR1α cDNAs were prepared as described (1Wang F. Kan M. Xu J. Yan G. McKeehan W.L. J. Biol.

The nucleotide sequences of all cDNA fragments generated by the PCR and the sequence across ligation sites in all cDNA constructions were determined. 125I-Labeled FGF-1 binding and covalent affinity cross-linking were performed in transfected COS-7 cells and baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells as described (1Wang F. Kan M. Xu J. Yan G. McKeehan W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10222-10230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Scatchard analysis was carried out by addition of various concentrations of 125I-labeled FGF-1 and 2 μg/ml heparin. Specific binding was calculated by subtraction of the amount of labeled FGF-1 bound in the presence of a 50-fold excess of unlabeled FGF-1. For heparin binding, Sf9 insect cells were infected with recombinant baculovirus for 2 days and then harvested and distributed into 1.7-ml Eppendorf tubes at 5 × 104cells/tube by modification of procedures described for FGF-1 binding (6Shi E. Kan M. Xu J. Wang F. Hou J. McKeehan W.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3907-3918Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Concentrations (0.7-8 μg/ml) of [3H]heparin (Mr= 6000-20,000; 0.7 Ci/mg, DuPont) were added to each sample in 0.5 ml of binding buffer. After incubation for 4 h at 4°C, the cells were collected in 96-well filtration plates (Millipore, Bedford, MA) and washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7 (PBS). The membrane from each well was excised, and radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation. Specific binding was determined by the difference between total binding and nonspecific binding remaining in the presence of a 100-fold excess of unlabeled heparin or the amount of [3H]heparin bound to an equivalent amount of cells infected with an unrelated recombinant virus at the same titer. Complexes of recombinant FGFR1 constructions and heparin were fragmented with trypsin by modification of a previously described procedure (1Wang F. Kan M. Xu J. Yan G. McKeehan W.L. J. Biol.

Sf9 cells infected with baculoviruses bearing recombinant FGFR1 cDNAs were lysed with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS, and receptor products were then immobilized by incubation of the cell lysates with heparin-agarose beads (1 ml of packed beads/107cells) for 4 h at 4°C. After washing with PBS, half of the complex was retained as an untreated control, and the other half was treated with 100 μg/ml trypsin in PBS at 4°C for 1 h. After a wash with PBS containing 2 mM p-methylsulfonyl fluoride, material retained on the beads was eluted with 1 M NaCl in PBS, concentrated, and subjected to analysis by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblot (1Wang F.

Variants of the ectodomain of FGFR2 were analyzed by paired 5′ and 3′ primers PB1 (5′-gccgaatTCAAGTGTGCAGATGGGATTAACG) and CB (5′-AGGATGGGCCGGTGCGGTGATCGCTC). Primer PB1 began 67 bp upstream of the translational initiation site, and CB was complementary to an invariant sequence within Loop II (see Fig. 1). A 5′ primer PB9 (5′-AGCCACCAACCAAATACCAA) complementary to a coding sequence within Loop I of FGFR2α was paired with the CB primer to detect specifically the FGFRα isoform. Template cDNAs were prepared, and the PCR was performed as described previously (9Yan G. Fukabori Y. McBride G. Nikolaropolous S. McKeehan W.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4513-4522Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 10Yan G. McBride G. McKeehan W.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 194: 512-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Previous studies indicated that deletion of the 39-bp coding sequence for the 13 core residues (EDDDDDDDSSSEE) that compose the acidic box (denoted as the A domain in Fig. 1) in the NH2terminus of FGFR1β (5Hou J.

Chem. 1992; 267: 17804-17808Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or splice variants of the FGFR2 gene that do not exhibit the entire exon (acidic exon designated AE in Fig. 1) containing the acidic residues (3Jaye M. Schlessinger J. Dionne C.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1135: 185-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar, 4Miki T. Fleming T.P. Bottaro D.P. Rubin J.S. Ron D. Aaronson S.A. Science. 1991; 251: 72-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar) had no effect on the binding of FGF-1 to recombinant products expressed on the surface of transfected monkey kidney COS cells. To test whether the two deletions affected ligand binding to the 3-loop FGFR1α isoform, we constructed mutants FGFR1α(ΔA) and FGFR1α(ΔAE) with deletions of the 13 residues (Glu126-Glu139) of the acidic box and the whole exon coding for the interloop sequence (Asp120-Met149), respectively. Neither deletion had a notable qualitative effect on the amount of FGF-1 covalently cross-linked to recombinant product in assays containing heparin and 125I-FGF-1 at 120 pM (Fig. 1, inset). We previously reported that although both isoforms bind FGF-1 when expressed on the surface of baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells, the affinity of FGFR1α for FGF-1 was 12.5% that of FGFR1β in the presence of heparin (6Shi E. Kan M. Xu J. Wang F. Hou J. McKeehan W.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3907-3918Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 demonstrates that mammalian COS cells transfected with the FGFR1α ectodomain also exhibit a lower affinity for FGF-1 than those transfected with FGFR1β. The FGFR1α(ΔA) construction, which exhibits a deletion of only the 13-residue acidic box between Loops I and II, retained the lower affinity exhibited by wild-type FGFR1α; however, deletion of the entire interloop sequence resulted in a higher affinity similar to two-loop FGFR1β despite the presence of Loop I directly at the NH2terminus of Loop II (Fig. 2). When expressed on the surface of baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells, FGFR1α failed to bind FGF-1 at all in the absence of heparin relative to the FGFR1β isoform, which continues to bind FGF-1 with a reduced affinity (6Shi E. Kan M. Xu J. Wang F. Hou J. McKeehan W.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3907-3918Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Both deletions in the FGFR1α(ΔA) and FGFR1α(ΔAE) constructions relieved the absolute requirement for exogenous heparin for the binding of FGF-1 to wild-type FGFR1α on the surface of Sf9 cells (Fig. 3). Since heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycans bind directly to the FGFR ectodomain in the absence of FGF (2Kan M. Wang F. Xu J. Crabb J.W. Hou J. McKeehan W.L. Science. 1993; 259: 1918-1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar), we designed a radioreceptor assay to quantitate the binding of [3H]heparin to recombinant FGFR isoforms expressed on the surface of infected Sf9 cells. Binding was saturable and in the presence of unlabeled heparin reversible to a plateau level exhibited by cells infected with virus bearing an unrelated cDNA. Parallel to the differences in affinities for FGF-1, FGFR1α exhibited a lower affinity for the glycosaminoglycan than FGFR1β. Absence of the 13-residue acidic box in FGFR1α(ΔA) did not lower affinity for heparin, while deletion of the entire interloop sequence increased the affinity to that of FGFR1β (Fig. 4). Solubilized ectodomains immobilized either on antibody-agarose beads or constructions bearing a fusion partner (glutathione S-transferase) at the COOH terminus immobilized on GSH-agarose exhibited similar differences (not shown).Figure 4:Scatchard analysis of [3H]heparin binding to variant ectodomains of FGFR1. Specific binding of various concentrations of [3H]heparin in the presence or absence of a 100-fold excess of unlabeled heparin to Sf9 cells expressing the indicated cDNA constructions was determined. For example, in a typical binding assay, 105cells infected with FGFR1β bound 271,540 dpm of labeled heparin, and the same number of cells infected with virus bearing an unrelated cDNA bound 64,859 dpm. Addition of excess unlabeled heparin to FGFR1β-infected cells reduced the binding to near that exhibited by uninfected or mock-infected cells. The values are the mean of duplicate samples.

Wang F. Xu J. Crabb J.W. Hou J. McKeehan W.L. Science. 1993; 259: 1918-1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5). In contrast, heparin failed to protect the FGFR1α isoform from proteolysis. The FGFR1α(ΔA) product retained the properties of intact FGFR1α, while the FGFR1α(ΔAE) product exhibited properties of FGFR1β despite the presence of Loop I. Specific antibody epitopes within defined sequence domains in Loop I and the two loops of FGFR1β are masked by the native conformation of the FGFR1α isoform (7Xu J. Nakahara M. Crabb J.W. Shi E. Matuo Y. Fraser M. Kan M. Hou J. McKeehan W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17792-17803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether the inter-Loop I/II sequence affected the display of epitopes within native FGFR1α, we tested the reaction of the mutant construction products with monoclonal M5G10, which reacts with an epitope within the sequence spanning the COOH terminus of Loop II, the inter-Loop II/III sequence, and the NH2terminus of Loop III (7Xu J. Nakahara M. Crabb J.W. Shi E. Matuo Y. Fraser M. Kan M. Hou J. McKeehan W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17792-17803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As reported previously (7Xu J. Nakahara M. Crabb J.W. Shi E. Matuo Y. Fraser M. Kan M. Hou J. McKeehan W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17792-17803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), M5G10 fails to react with native FGFR1α but reacts with denatured FGFR1α (Fig. 2) and FGFR1β (Fig. 6). Deletion of the 13 residues of the acidic box and the entire interloop exon sequence in the mutant FGFR1α(ΔA) and the FGFR1α(ΔAE) constructions, respectively, restores reactivity with antibody M5G10 (Fig. 6). A distinctive difference between isolated epithelial cells from normal rat prostate and transplantable rat prostate tumors is the loss of the low affinity class of FGF receptor sites in the tumor cells (11Mansson P.E. Adams P. Kan M. McKeehan W.L. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 2485-2494PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether the difference reflected loss of expression of the α isoform of the FGFR2 gene, which is selectively expressed in the epithelial cells relative to the FGFR1 gene (9Yan G. Fukabori Y. McBride G. Nikolaropolous S. McKeehan W.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4513-4522Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar), mRNAs coding for isoforms of the FGFR2 ectodomain were analyzed by PCR in normal prostate; a slow growing, well differentiated, androgen-responsive tumor (Dunning R3327PAP tumor); and a malignant variant that arises from the latter after castration of male hosts (Dunning R3327AT3 tumor) (9Yan G. Fukabori Y. McBride G. Nikolaropolous S. McKeehan W.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4513-4522Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Normal prostate tissue exhibits three mRNA species characteristic of FGFR2α at 849 bp, FGFR2β at 585 bp, and FGFR2β(ΔAE) at 504 bp, while both types of tumors exhibited predominantly the FGFR2β(ΔAE) isoform (Fig. 7 A). The FGFR2β isoform exhibiting the NH2-terminal AE sequence is detectable in Dunning R3327PAP tumors but undetectable in the Dunning R3327AT3 tumors. Analysis of the cDNA template from normal prostate tissue with a primer complementary to specific coding sequences for Loop I of FGFR2α revealed a single 664-bp band characteristic of the FGFR2α isoform containing the interloop exon coding sequence AE (Fig. 7 B). No band at 583 bp indicative of the FGFR2α(ΔAE) variant could be detected. In the accompanying paper (1Wang F. Kan M. Xu J. Yan G. McKeehan W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10222-10230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), we demonstrated that the base ligand-binding site of the FGFR kinase ectodomain that is shared by FGF-1, FGF-2, and FGF-7 consists of one Ig-like disulfide loop (Loop II), which contains a heparan sulfate binding domain, a short interloop sequence that connects Loop II and Loop III, and a part of the NH2terminus of Loop III extending through lysine 189. A constitutive structural domain just downstream of lysine 189 within Loop III and mutually exclusive alternately spliced exons coding for the COOH-terminal half of Loop III interact to determine the affinity for FGF-2 and whether FGF-7 binds at all. In addition to tandem Loops II and III, which compose the FGFRβ isoform, alternate splicing of a single exon in the FGFR1 and FGFR2 genes results in an isoform (FGFRα) containing an NH2-terminal Ig-like loop (Loop I) that is connected to Loop II by an interloop sequence that is also encoded by a single exon. In previous reports, we have proposed that although Loop I does not directly participate in formation of a ligand-binding site, it is sufficiently interactive with the base-binding site formed by structural domains within Loops II and III to alter affinity for the same FGF ligand and to influence the nature of the interaction of the base-binding site with heparin (6Shi E. Kan M. Xu J. Wang F. Hou J. McKeehan W.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3907-3918Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 7Xu J. Nakahara M. Crabb J.W. Shi E. Matuo Y. Fraser M. Kan M. Hou J. McKeehan W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17792-17803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this report, we show by Scatchard analysis that FGFR1α exhibits a lower affinity for heparin that parallels its lower affinity for FGF. This and the fact that heparin fails to protect the active binding site from degradation by trypsin in the FGFR1α isoform confirmed that the nature of the interaction of the glycosaminoglycan with FGFR1α is quite different from that of FGFR1β and may underlie the differences in affinity between the two splice variants for the same ligand. Molecular models suggest that the interloop exon between Loops I and II may serve as a hinge that facilitates the interaction of Loop I with Loops II and III in the FGFR1α isoform (7Xu J. Nakahara M. Crabb J.W. Shi E. Matuo Y. Fraser M. Kan M. Hou J. McKeehan W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17792-17803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Here we show that a mutant of FGFR1α (FGFR1α(ΔAE)) in which the inter-Loop I/II sequence was deleted exhibits properties of FGFR1β despite the presence of Loop I immediately adjacent to the NH2terminus of Loop II. This included high affinity binding to both FGF and heparin, loss of the absolute requirement for heparin for FGF-1 binding, resistance to tryptic degradation in the presence of heparin, and display of antibody epitopes. Deletion of only the 13 residues that compose what is commonly referred to as the acidic box within the interloop sequence was insufficient to abrogate the low affinity of the FGFR1α isoform for FGF or heparin or the resistance of the active core of the ligand-binding site to trypsin in the presence of heparin. This suggests that the remaining 17 residues of the 30-residue interloop sequence are sufficient to facilitate the functional impact of Loop I with the active ligand- and heparin-binding site. It is noteworthy that deletion of the 13-residue sequence in FGFR1α was sufficient to expose a monoclonal antibody epitope within Loops II and III that is normally hidden and relieved the qualitative requirement for heparin for FGF-1 binding to the FGFR1α variant despite the fact that the deletion had no impact on the Kdfor heparin and FGF-1. The model presented here in which the major glycosaminoglycan binding domain of FGFR enjoys greater exposure to nearby co-factors explains the lack of requirement of FGFRβ relative to FGFRα for exogenous heparin when expressed on the surface of baculovirus-infected Sf9 insect cells, which express unidentified mimetic co-factors for the FGFR ectodomain (6Shi E. Kan M. Xu J. Wang F. Hou J. McKeehan W.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3907-3918Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) but do not express the type and amounts of long chain heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycans comparable with mammalian cells.2( 2M. Kan and R. Owens, unpublished results.) The impact of the differences between the FGFRα and FGFRβ ectodomains in requirement for heparan sulfates in a physiological context remains to be established. Although differences in the binding of FGF-1 and FGF-2 to FGFR1α and FGFR1β isoforms are quantitative when heparin is used as the glycosaminoglycan in the FGFR ternary complex, the presence of Loop I may restrict the range of natural heparan sulfate co-factors that will support the ternary FGFR complex with a particular FGF ligand. Regulation of the ratio of expression of FGFRα and FGFRβ at the level of alternate splicing has been reported. In well differentiated human hepatoma cells that are growth-inhibited by high concentrations of FGF, expression of the α isoform of the FGFR1 gene exceeds that of the β variant, and only the α ectodomain is combined with a kinase-defective intracellular domain, which also arises by an alternate splice event (6Shi E. Kan M. Xu J. Wang F. Hou J. McKeehan W.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3907-3918Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). A selective reduction in expression of the FGFR1α variant correlates with malignancy of human pancreatic (12Kobrin M.S. Yamanaka Y. Friess H. Lopez M.E. Korc M. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 4741-4744PubMed Google Scholar) and brain (13Yamaguchi F. Saya H. Bruner J.M. Morrison R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 484-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) tumors. Here we showed that lack of expression of the α splice variant of the FGFR2 variant characterizes transplantable rat prostate tumors relative to normal prostate tissue. This correlates with the loss of low affinity receptors on cells derived from the tumors relative to normal epithelial cells (11Mansson P.E. Adams P. Kan M. McKeehan W.L. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 2485-2494PubMed Google Scholar). The FGFR2 gene is specifically expressed in the epithelial cells from normal prostate and well differentiated prostate tumors that exhibit both epithelial and stromal compartments (9Yan G. Fukabori Y. McBride G. Nikolaropolous S. McKeehan W.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4513-4522Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Alternate splicing of exons coding for the COOH terminus of Loop III of FGFR2 determine whether the epithelial cells respond to stromal cell-derived FGF-7 or to other FGF ligands that are abnormally activated in malignant tumors (9Yan G. Fukabori Y. McBride G. Nikolaropolous S. McKeehan W.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4513-4522Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Last, we showed that, in normal prostate tissue that expresses the FGFR2α isoform, the single exons coding for Loop I and the inter-Loop I/II sequence are coordinately expressed, although the interloop exon is alternately spliced in the FGFR2β variant (3Jaye M. Schlessinger J. Dionne C.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1135: 185-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar, 4Miki T. Fleming T.P. Bottaro D.P. Rubin J.S. Ron D. Aaronson S.A. Science. 1991; 251: 72-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). This is consistent with the failure to demonstrate the αΔAE variant of FGFR1 and FGFR2 in a variety of tissues (3Jaye M.

The gene was initially isolated during a low stringency polymerase chain reaction screen of a NIH 3T3 cell cDNA library using primers that amplify a human fibrillin-1 epidermal growth factor-like repeat. Three lines of evidence suggest that the mouse gene is a third member of the LTBP gene family, which we designate LTBP-3. First, the deduced polypeptide, which consists of 15 epidermal growth factor-like repeats, 3 TGF binding protein repeats, and 2 proline- and glycine-rich sequences, shows 38.4% identity with LTBP-1 but only 27% identity with fibrillin-1. Second, the gene appears to be co-expressed in developing mouse tissues with TGF-β. Third, immunoprecipitation studies using mouse preosteoblast MC3T3-E1 cells and a specific anti-peptide polyclonal antiserum reveal that the mouse polypeptide forms a complex with the TGF-β1 precursor. Finally, we note that the LTBP-3 gene was recently localized to a distinct genetic locus (Li, X., Yin, W., Perez-Jurado, L., Bonadio, J., and Francke, U. (1995) Mamm. Genome 6, 42-45).

Initially synthesized as a precursor consisting of an amino-terminal propeptide followed by mature TGF-β, two chains of nascent pro-TGF-β associate in most tissues to form a Mr∼ 106,000 inactive disulfide-bonded dimer. Homodimers are most common, but heterodimers have also been described (Cheifetz et al., 1987Cheifetz S. Weatherbee J.A. Tsang M.L-S. Anderson J.K. Mole J.E. Lucas R. Massague J.

Consequently, the propeptide dimer is often referred to as the latency-associated protein, and this protein plus the disulfide-bonded TGF-β dimer are also known as the small latent complex. In the extracellular space, small latent complexes must be dissociated to activate mature TGF-β. The mechanism of activation of the latent complex is thought to be one of the most important steps governing TGF-β effects (Lyons et al., 1988Lyons R.M. Keski-Oja J. Moses H.L. J.

The deduced human LTBP-1 amino acid sequence is composed of a signal peptide, 16 epidermal growth factor-like repeats with the potential to bind calcium (EGF-CB repeats), two copies of a unique motif containing 8 cysteine residues, an RGD cell attachment motif, and an 8-amino acid motif identical to the cell binding domain of the laminin B2 chain (AGPHCEKC) (Kanzaki et al., 1990Kanzaki T. Olofsson A. Moren A. Wernstedt C. Hellman U. Miyazono K. Claesson-Welsh L. Heldin C.-H. Cell. 1990; 61: 1051-1061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). There is evidence that LTBP-1 binds calcium, which, in turn, induces a structural change that protects LTBP from proteolytic attack (Colosetti et al., 1993Colosetti P. Hellman U. Heldin C.-H. Miyazono K. FEBS Lett. 1993; 320: 140-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). LTBP-2 shows 41% sequence identity to LTBP-1, and its structural domains show a similar overall organization (Moren et al., 1994). While the functions of LTBP-1 and LTBP-2 presently are unknown, several ideas have been put forward in the literature. First, LTBP may regulate the intracellular biosynthesis of latent TGF-β precursors. Cultured erythroleukemia cells efficiently assemble and secrete large latent TGF-β complexes, whereas they slowly secrete small latent TGF-β complexes that contain anomalous disulfide bonds (Miyazono et al., 1991Miyazono K. Olofsson A. Colosetti P. Heldin C.-H. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1091-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, Miyazono et al., 1992Miyazono K. Thyberg J. Heldin C.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5668-5675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, LTBP may facilitate the normal assembly and secretion of latent TGF-β complexes. Second, LTBP may target latent TGF-β to specific types of connective tissue. Recent evidence suggests that the large latent TGF-β complex is covalently bound to the extracellular matrix via LTBP (Taipale et al., 1994Taipale J. Miyazono K. Heldin C.-H. Keski-Oja J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 171-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Based on these observations, LTBP has been referred to as a “matrix receptor”, i.e. a secreted protein that targets and stores latent growth factors such as TGF-β to the extracellular matrix. Third, LTBP may modulate the activation of latent complexes. This idea is based in part on recent evidence that suggests that mature TGF-β is released from extracellular storage sites by proteases such as plasmin and thrombin and that LTBP may protect small latent complexes from proteolytic attack (Falcone et al., 1993Falcone D.J.

Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 171-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar), i.e. protease activity may govern the effect of TGF-β in tissues, but LTBP may modulate this activity. Fourth, LTBP may play an important role in targeting the latent TGF-β complex to the cell surface, allowing latent TGF-β to be efficiently activated (Flaumenhaft et al., 1993Flaumenhaft R. Abe M. Sato K. Miyazono K. Harpel J. Heldin C.-H. Rifkin D.B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 995-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). In this paper, we report the molecular cloning of a new gene in the mouse that is related to LTBP-1 and LTBP-2. This conclusion is supported by (i) comparative analysis of DNA sequence identity, (ii) an evaluation of gene expression in developing tissues, and (iii) immunoprecipitation studies that show that that new mouse gene product forms specific complex with TGF- β1. A recent study has also shown that the new mouse gene is localized to a distinct genetic locus (Li et al., 1994).2Taken together, these results suggest that LTBP is a gene family of at least three members and that an appropriate designation for the new gene is LTBP-3. Identification of a third binding protein family member provides further insight into the mechanism by which latent TGF-β complexes can be targeted to connective tissue matrices and cells. Aliquots (typically 40-50,000 plaque-forming units) of phage particles from a cDNA library in the λZAP II vector made from NIH 3T3 cell mRNA (Stratagene) and fresh overnight XL1-Blue cells (grown in Luria broth supplemented with 0.4% maltose in 10 mM MgSO4) were mixed, incubated for 15 min at 37°C, mixed again with 9 ml of liquid (50°C) top layer agarose (NZY broth plus 0.75% agarose), and then spread evenly onto freshly poured 150-mm NZY-agar plates. Standard methods were used for the preparation of plaque-lifts and filter hybridization (42°C, in buffer containing 50% formamide, 5 × SSPE, 1 × Denhardt's solution, 0.1% SDS, 100 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA, 100 mg/ml heparin). Filters were washed progressively to high stringency (0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS, 65°C). cDNA probes were radiolabeled by the nick translation method using commercially available reagents and protocols (Sure Site kit, Novagen). Purified phage clones were converted to pBluescript plasmid clones, which were sequenced using Sequenase (version 2.0) as described previously (Chen et al., 1993Chen Y. Faraco J. Yin W. Germiller J. Francke U. Bonadio J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27381-27389Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 2The paper by Li et al. (1995), which refers to the LTBP-2 gene, was in press at the time that the paper describing the human LTBP-2 gene by Moren et al. (1994) was published; these genes are the same. Sequence alignment and identity was determined using sequence analysis programs from the Genetics Computer Group (MacVector). To prepare normal sense and antisense probes, a unique 342-base pair fragment from the 3′-untranslated region (+3973 to +4314, counting the A of the initiator Met codon as +1; see Fig. 1, ish) was subcloned into the pBluescript KS+ plasmid (Stratagene, Inc.). Template DNA was linearized with either EcoRI or BamHI, extracted, and precipitated with ethanol. Sense and antisense transcripts were generated from 1 μg of template with T3 and T7 polymerases in the presence of [35S]UTP at >6 mCi/ml (Amersham Corp., >1200 Ci/mmol) and 1.6 units/ml RNasin (Promega), with the remaining in vitro transcription reagents provided in a kit (SureSite, Novagen Inc.). After transcription at 37°C for 1 h, DNA templates were removed by a 15-min digest at 37°C with 0.5 units/ml RNase-free DNase I, extracted and precipitated with ethanol. Riboprobes were hydrolyzed to an average final length of 150 base pairs by incubating in 40 mM NaHCO3, 60 mM Na2CO3, 80 mM dithiothreitol for ∼40 min at 60°C. Hydrolysis was terminated by the addition of sodium acetate, pH 6.0, and glacial acetic acid to 0.09 M and 0.56% (v/v), respectively, and the probes were then ethanol-precipitated, dissolved in 0.1 M dithiothreitol, counted, and stored at −20°C until use. Day 8.5-9.0, day 13.5, and day 16.5 mouse embryo tissue sections (Novagen) and the in situ hybridization protocol were exactly as described (Chen et al., 1993Chen Y. Faraco J. Yin W. Germiller J. Francke U. Bonadio J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27381-27389Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).2 MC3T3-E1 cell poly(A+) RNA (2-10-μg aliquots) was electrophoresed on a 1.25% agarose, 2.2 M formaldehyde gel and then transferred to a nylon membrane (Hybond-N, Amersham Corp.). The RNA was cross-linked to the membrane by exposure to a UV light source (1.2 × 106mJ/cm2, UV Stratalinker 2400, Stratagene) and then prehybridized for >15 min at 65°C in Rapid-Hyb buffer (Amersham, Corp.). A specific cDNA probe consisting solely of untranslated sequence from the 3′ end of the transcript was 32P-labeled by random priming and used for hybridization (2 h at 65°C). Blots were washed progressively to high stringency (0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS, 65°C), and then placed against x-ray film with intensifying screens (XAR, Kodak) at −86°C. LTBP-3 antibodies were raised against a unique peptide sequence found in domain 2 (amino acids 155-167). Peptide 274 (GESVASKHAIYAVC) was synthesized using an ABI model 431A synthesizer employing FastMoc chemistry. The sequence was confirmed using an ABI 473 protein sequencer. A cysteine residue was added to the carboxyl terminus to facilitate cross-linking to carrier proteins. For antibody production, the synthetic peptide was coupled to rabbit serum albumin using m-maleimidobenzoic acid N-hydroxysuccinimide ester at a substitution of 7.5 mg of peptide/mg of rabbit serum albumin. One mg of the peptide-rabbit serum albumin conjugate in 1 ml of Freund's complete adjuvant was injected subcutaneously at 10 different sites along the backs of rabbits. Beginning at 3 weeks after initial immunization, the rabbits were given biweekly booster injections of 1 mg of peptide-rabbit serum albumin in 100 μl of Freund's incomplete adjuvant. IgG was prepared by mixing immune serum with caprylic acid (0.7 ml caprylic acid/ml of serum), stirring for 30 min, and centrifuging at 5000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was decanted and dialyzed against two changes of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) overnight at 4°C. The antibody solution was then affinity purified by passing it over a column containing the immunizing peptide coupled to Affi-Gel 10 affinity support. Bound antibodies were eluted with 0.2 M glycine, pH 2.3, immediately dialyzed against PBS, and concentrated to 1 mg/ml prior to storage at −70°C. Transient transfection was performed using standard protocols (Sambrook et al., 1989Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Briefly, subconfluent cells (covering ∼20% of a 100-mm plastic tissue culture dish) were washed 2 times in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium tissue culture medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) and then incubated for 3 h at 37°C in a sterile mixture of DEAE-dextran (0.25 mg/ml), chloroquine (55 mg/ml), and 15 μg of plasmid DNA (Courey and Tjian, 1988Courey A.J. Tjian R. Cell. 1988; 55: 887-898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1069) Google Scholar). Cells then were shocked by incubation with 10% dimethyl sulfoxide in sterile PBS for 2 min at 37°C, washed 2 × with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sambrook et al., 1989Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), and incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics for 72 h at 37°C. For immunoprecipitation, 1 ml of antibody (1:400 final concentration, in PBS-TDS buffer (0.38 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 8.1 mM Na2HPO4, 1.5 mM KH2PO4, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, and 0.1% SDS) was added to 1 ml of radiolabeled medium proteins. The mixture was incubated with shaking at 4°C for 1 h, protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads were added (200 μl, 10% suspension), and this mixture was incubated with shaking for 1 additional h at 4°C. Immunoprecipitated proteins were pelleted by brief centrifugation, the pellet was washed 6 times with PBS-TDS buffer, 2 × protein loading dye was added, and the samples were boiled for 5 min and then fractionated on 4-18% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Bonadio et al., 1985Bonadio J.F. Holbrook K.A. Gelinas R.E. Jacob J. Byers P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 1734-1742Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cold molecular weight markers (200-14.3 kDa, Rainbow mix, Amersham Corp.) were used to estimate molecular weight. The gel was dried and exposed to film for the indicated time at room temperature. Fractionated proteins within SDS-polyacrylamide gels were transferred to a nitrocellulose filter for 2 h using Tris-glycine-methanol buffer, pH 8.3, at 0.5 mA/cm2. The filter was blocked, incubated with nonfat milk plus antibody (1:1000 dilution) for 2 h, and washed. Antibody staining was visualized using the ECL Western blotting reagent (Amersham Corp.) according to the manufacturer's protocols. While cloning mouse fibrillin-1 (Yin et al., 1995Yin W. Germiller J. Sanguineti C. Smiley E. Pangilinan T. Pereira L. Ramirez F. Bonadio J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1798-1806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), a 3T3 cell cDNA library was PCR amplified using human fibrillin-1 oligonucleotide primers. A PCR fragment with low homology to human fibrillin-1 was obtained. This result was surprising because the human and mouse fibrillin-1 genes share >95% coding sequence identity. To investigate the possibility that the low homology mouse PCR fragment was derived from a related (fibrillin-like) cDNA, the 3T3 cell cDNA library was screened at high stringency using the PCR fragment as the probe. A walking strategy eventually yielded a series of overlapping cDNA clones (Fig. 1). Sequence analysis of cDNA clones revealed an open reading frame of 3,753 nucleotides. A methionine codon in a favorable context for translation initiation was provisionally designated the translation start site (CCTGCGATGC; see Kozak, 1991Kozak M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19867-19870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The initiator methionine was followed by a characteristic signal sequence of 21 amino acids. Beyond this, the conceptual amino acid sequence appeared to be organized into five structurally distinct domains (Fig. 2). Domain 1 was a 28-amino acid segment (amino acids 22-49) with a net basic charge (estimated pI, 12.36). Domain 2 (amino acids 50-439) consisted of an EGF-like repeat, a 135-amino acid segment that was proline-rich (20.7%) and glycine-rich (11.8%) but not cysteine-rich, a Fib-motif (Pereira et al., 1993Pereira L. D'Alessio M. Ramirez F. Lynch J.R. Sykes B. Pangilinan T. Bonadio J. Human Mol. Genet. 1993; 2: 961-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), an EGF-CB repeat, and a TGF-bp repeat. Domain 3 (amino acids 440-552) was characterized by its high proline content (21%). Domain 4 (amino acids 553-1229) consisted of 14 consecutive cysteine-rich repeats. Based on structural homologies, 12/14 repeats were EGF-CB motifs (Handford et al., 1990Handford P.A. Baron M. Mayhew M. Willis A. Beesley T. Brownlee G.G. Campbell I.D. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 475-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), whereas 2/14 were TGF-bp motifs (Kanzaki et al., 1990Kanzaki T. Olofsson A. Moren A. Wernstedt C. Hellman U. Miyazono K. Claesson-Welsh L. Heldin C.-H. Cell. 1990; 61: 1051-1061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Domain 5 was a unique 22-amino acid segment at the carboxyl terminus (amino acids 1230-1251).Figure 2:A, schematic showing the structure of mouse fibrillin-1 (top), the LTBP-3 gene product (middle), and human LTBP-1 (bottom).

RGD and laminin B2 chain cell adhesion sequences were not identified. Northern blot analysis of mouse embryo RNA using a 3′-untranslated region probe identified a transcript band of ∼4.6 kilobases (data not shown). In this regard, 4310 nucleotides have been isolated by cDNA cloning, including a 3′-untranslated region of 401 nucleotides and a 5′-upstream sequence of 156 nucleotides. The apparent discrepancy between the Northern analysis result and the cDNA sequence analysis suggested that the 5′-upstream sequence may include ∼300 nucleotides of additional upstream sequence. This estimate was consistent with preliminary primer extension mapping studies indicating that the 5′-upstream sequence is 400-500 nucleotides in length.3 3W. Yin, E. Smiley, and J. Bonadio, unpublished results. A total of 19 cysteine-rich repeats were found in domains 2 and 4 of the new mouse gene product. Thirteen were EGF-like and 11/13 showed the calcium binding consensus sequence: (D/N)(I/V)(D/N)(E/D)C1. This consensus was derived from an analysis of 154 EGF-CB repeats in 23 different proteins and from structural analyses of the EGF-CB repeat, both bound and unbound to calcium ion (Selander-Sunnerhagen et al., 1992Selander-Sunnerhagen M.

In addition, a potential calcium binding sequence, which has not previously been reported (ET(N/D)EC1), was identified in the first EGF-like repeat of domain 4. Ten of 13 EGF-CB repeats also contained a second consensus sequence, C3 X(D/N) XXXX(Y/F) XC4, which represents a recognition sequence for an Asp/Asn hydroxylase that co- and posttranslationally modifies D/N residues (Stenflo et al., 1987Stenf"
https://openalex.org/W1999325571,"In this study, we have identified a protein in Escherichia coli that specifically binds to double-stranded DNA containing a single-stranded gap of one nucleotide. The gap-DNA binding (GDB) protein was purified to apparent homogeneity. The analysis of the amino-terminal sequencing of the GDB protein shows two closely related sequences we identify as the α and β subunits of the HU protein. Furthermore, the GDB protein is not detected in the crude extract of an E. coli double mutant strain hupA hupB that has no functional HU protein. These results led us to identify the GDB protein as the HU protein. HU binds strongly to double-stranded 30-mer oligonucleotides containing a nick or a single-stranded gap of one or two nucleotides. Apparent dissociation constants were measured for these various DNA duplexes using a gel retardation assay. The KD(app)values were 8 nM for the 30-mer duplex that contains a nick and 4 and 2 nM for those that contain a 1- or a 2-nucleotide gap, respectively. The affinity of HU for these ligands is at least 100-fold higher than for the same 30-mer DNA duplex without nick or gap. Other single-stranded breaks or gaps, which are intermediate products in the repair of abasic sites after incision by the Fpg, Nth, or Nfo proteins, are also preferentially bound by the HU protein. Due to specific binding to DNA strand breaks, HU may play a role in replication, recombination, and repair.

Due to specific binding to DNA strand breaks, HU may play a role in replication, recombination, and repair. DNA transactions such as general and site-specific recombination, replication, and repair imply the formation of intermediates that contain single-stranded nicks or short gaps (1Charneau P. Clavel F. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 2415-2421Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Lahue R.S. Au K.G. Modrich P. Science. 1989; 245: 160-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar, 3Husain I. van Houten B.

Such sites are also generated by the nonenzymatic hydrolysis of sugar-base bonds and as a consequence of exposure to ionizing radiation (5Loeb L.A. Preston B.D. Annu. Rev.

Their repair results from the excision of a sugar phosphate followed by the insertion of one nucleotide by a DNA polymerase and sealing of the nick by the DNA ligase (7Dianov G. Price A. Lindahl T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1605-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Thus, in the majority of BER events, a single-stranded gap of one nucleotide is formed as a repair intermediate in duplex DNA. Larger gaps are also generated by the Escherichia coli nucleotide excision repair that induces the release of a single-stranded dodecamer containing the damaged site (9Sancar A. Tang M.-S. Photochem.

Single-stranded nicks and gaps in duplex DNA are also representative of a class of problems in nucleic acids structure. Several studies have shown that the presence of nicks and short gaps results in an increased flexibility of DNA at these sites (10Hays J.B. Zimm B.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1970; 48: 297-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 11Mills J.B. Cooper J.P. Hagerman P.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1797-1803Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 12Le Cam E.

Thus, the formation of BER and nucleotide excision repair intermediates in DNA may induce structural changes that might be specifically recognized by proteins in the cell. Indeed, these DNA intermediate structures represent potential weakness points in the DNA chain, which may require transitory interactions with putative “DNA chaperones” (13Travers A.A. Ner S.S. Churchill M.E.A. Cell. 1994; 77: 167-169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Such proteins might facilitate the access at these sites to DNA repair enzymes. In eukaryotes, at least one protein, the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) is known to be able to bind specifically DNA strand breaks (14Thraves P.J. Kasid U. Smulson M.E. Cancer Res. 1985; 45: 386-391PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies demonstrated that through its nick-DNA binding activity, PARP can modulate DNA repair (15Ding R. Pommier Y. Kang V.H. Smulson M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12804-12812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Satoh M.S. Lindahl T. Nature. 1992; 356: 356-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (939) Google Scholar, 17Molinete M.

Thus, since PARP is absent in prokaryotic cells, bacteria may possess protein factors that recognize such DNA structures. In this study, we have attempted to identify such protein(s) in E. coli. In this aim, we employed an electrophoretic mobility shift assay to reveal high affinity complex formation between some E. coli proteins and a 30-mer DNA oligonucleotide duplex containing a single nucleotide gap. Using this assay, we purified a protein that was determined to be the HU protein. HU is a low molecular weight, thermostable histone-like protein that forms heterodimers that bind to linear DNA fragments every 9 base pairs regardless of their sequence or length (18Rouvière-Yaniv J. Gros F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 3428-3432Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 19McGhee J. Felsenfeld G. Annu. Rev.

Moreover, in vitro and in vivo studies have also shown that HU may be involved in cellular DNA processes such as DNA transposition (24Lavoie B. Choconas G. J. Biol.

J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23083-23086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ability of HU to bind to DNA containing nicks or gaps, first described in this study, may be related to these biological functions. Fpg (Fapy-DNA glycosylase), Nth (endonuclease III), Nfo (endonuclease IV), and Ung (uracil-DNA glycosylase) proteins were purified from E. coli overproducing strains using procedures already described. The HU protein used for comparison with the GDB protein is a kind gift from Dr. J. Rouvière-Yaniv (IBPC, Paris). All the strains used were derived from E. coli K12. The BH20 strain is isogenic with AB1157 except for fpg-1::KanR(31Boiteux S. Huisman O. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1989; 215: 300-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The JR 766 strain is isogenic with the E. coli C600 strain except for hupA::KanRand hupB::CmR(32Bonnefoy E. Almeida A. Rouvière-Yaniv J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7691-7695Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Cell cultures and bacterial crude extracts were carried out as described by Boiteux et al. (33Boiteux S. O'Connor T.R. Laval J. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3177-3183Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). High pressure liquid chromatography-purified oligonucleotides were purchased from GENSET (Paris). The sequences used are reported in Fig. 1. Phosphorylation at the 5′-end of the oligonucleotides was performed using T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Corp.) or cold ATP as described by Castaing et al. (34Castaing B. Boiteux S. Zelwer C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 389-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Single-stranded 30-mer oligonucleotides were annealed to complementary sequences to produce a control duplex (Fig. 1, [C/G]) or duplexes that contain either a nick ([nick]) or single-stranded gaps of one or two nucleotides ([1 nt-gap]) and ([2 nt-gap]), respectively (Fig. 1). To yield intermediate products of base excision repair, a 30-mer 5′-32P-labeled single-stranded oligonucleotide containing a uracil residue was treated with the Ung protein for 1 h at 37°C (35Graves R.J. Felzenszwalb I. Laval J. O'Connor T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14429-14435Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After this treatment, more than 95% of the uracil residues were excised and replaced by an abasic site. The resulting oligonucleotide was annealed with a complementary sequence containing a guanine opposite the abasic site to produce the duplex (Fig. 1, [dr/G]). The initial single-stranded oligonucleotide containing a uracil was annealed with the same complementary sequence to obtain a duplex ([U/G]) (Fig. 1). To prevent β elimination at the abasic site, the ([dr/G]) duplex was stored in citrate buffer (SSC × 5) at −20°C and freshly thawed before use. The assay (24 μl, total volume) contained 25 mM Hepes/KOH, pH 7.6, 100 mM KCl, 5 mM Na2EDTA, 5 mMβ-mercaptoethanol, 6% glycerol, 0.2 mg/ml poly(dI-dC), 5,000-10,000 cpm of 5′-32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide probe (50-100 pM), and 5-15 μg of proteins from bacterial crude lysate or 5 μl of column fraction. When indicated, an unlabeled oligonucleotide competitor (2.4 nM) was added prior to the addition of the crude lysate. The binding reaction was performed for 10 min at 20°C. Then, samples were loaded onto a non-denaturing 10% polyacrylamide gel for electrophoresis according to Castaing et al. (34Castaing B. Boiteux S. Zelwer C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 389-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The gels were then fixed in a 10% acetic acid, 10% methanol solution (v/v), dried on 3MM Whatman paper, and exposed for autoradiography to Kodak X-AR film at −70°C. The specific binding of the [1 nt-gap] oligonucleotide was used as an activity assay to purify the GDB protein of E. coli. The apparent dissociation constants (KD(app)) were determined by the gel retardation method. The incubation mixtures were as above, except that assays were performed at 200 mM KCl without competitor poly(dI-dC) and in the presence of 1500 cpm (15 pM) of labeled oligonucleotide probes. Assuming a stoichiometry of 1:1 for the complex between the heterodimeric HU protein and the DNA probe, the Kdvalues are calculated directly from the electrophoresis data, as previously described by Castaing et al. (34Castaing B. Boiteux S. Zelwer C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 389-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). 1 liter of LB broth medium containing 40 μg/ml kanamycin was inoculated with 10 ml of an overnight culture of the E. coli strain BH20. Bacteria were grown at 37°C until A600= 2.0. Cells were harvested, washed, and resuspended in buffer A (25 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8.2, 5 mMβ-mercaptoethanol, 5% glycerol, and 1 mM Na2EDTA) containing 250 mM NaCl. The cell suspension was supplemented with 1 mg/ml lysozyme, incubated for 10 min at 37°C, and frozen for 10 min at −70°C. This freezing-thawing cycle was repeated twice. The lysate was then centrifuged at 35,000 r.p.m. for 1 h at 4°C. The resulting supernatant was the crude extract (fraction I). Fraction I was loaded on a QMA anion exchange column (Waters Acell), washed, and equilibrated in the buffer A containing 250 mM NaCl. The active fraction was eluted in the flow-through volume (fraction II). Fraction II was then heated at 100°C for 30 min and centrifuged at 10,000 r.p.m. for 15 min. The active GDB protein was recovered in the supernatant (fraction III). Fraction III was dialyzed against buffer A containing 25 mM NaCl and applied to a second QMA-Acell column, washed, and equilibrated in buffer A containing 25 mM NaCl. The GDB activity was recovered in the flow-through volume (fraction IV). Fraction IV was adjusted to pH 7.2 and loaded onto a Phospho-Ultrogel column (Sepracor, MA). The column was eluted with a linear NaCl gradient (25-600 mM). The active fractions eluted between 300 and 400 mM NaCl (fraction V). Fraction V was dialyzed against buffer A (pH 7.2) containing 25 mM NaCl and loaded onto a DNA-cellulose column (Sigma). This column was eluted with a linear NaCl gradient (25-500 mM). The GDB protein eluted at 250 mM NaCl (fraction VI). Fraction VI (1 mg of protein) was dialyzed and stored at 0°C. Amino-terminal microsequencing was performed as described by Le Caer and Rossier (36Le Caer J.-P. Rossier J. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 169: 246-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The goal of this study was to identify GDB proteins in E. coli. To identify such proteins, we used a gel retardation assay with 30-mer DNA probes either fully double-stranded [C/G] or containing a single-stranded region of one nucleotide [1 nt-gap] (Fig. 1). Fig. 2 shows the electrophoretic mobility of DNA probes [1 nt-gap] or [C/G] when they are mixed with E. coli crude extract. Several retardation complexes are formed including a well defined C1 complex and other complexes (Cn) migrating near the top of the gel (lanes 2 and 6). The C1 complex, however, is only observed with the [1 nt-gap] probe (lane 6). This complex is not detected with the unmodified control [C/G] duplex (lane 2). Furthermore, competition experiments with cold [C/G] duplex for the binding of the [1 nt-gap] duplex shows that only C1 is conserved (lane 8). These results strongly suggest that the C1 complex results from the specific interaction between the [1 nt-gap] probe and a cellular factor. Control experiments show that C1 complex is due to a heat stable cellular factor, since the incubation of crude extract at 100°C for 30 min does not affect the GDB activity (lane 7). In addition, the GDB activity is abolished after treatment of the extract with proteinase K (lane 10). These results show that E. coli possesses a thermostable protein that specifically binds a double-stranded DNA fragment that contains a single-stranded region of one nucleotide. The specific binding of the [1 nt-gap] probe, detected by the C1 complex, was used as an activity assay to purify the GDB protein of E. coli. Purification steps are as described under “Materials and Methods,” and the final fraction VI shows a single protein band on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with an apparent molecular mass of 7 kDa (Fig. 3). The homogeneous GDB protein contained in fraction VI was transferred onto Problot membrane, and its amino-terminal sequence was determined. We obtained the sequence MNK(T/S)QLID(V/K)IAE(G/K)A(E/D), where the amino acids between brackets correspond to a double signal in a single round of degradation. The results suggest the presence of two peptides with closely related sequences. A computer search for alignment of these two sequences indicated a perfect identity with the first 15 amino acids of the α and β subunits of the E. coli HU protein, respectively (20Drlica K. Rouvière-Yaniv J. Microbiol. Rev. 1987; 51: 301-319Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results strongly suggest that the GDB protein isolated in this study is the HU protein. Moreover, earlier studies showed that HU is heat stable (18Rouvière-Yaniv J. Gros F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 3428-3432Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Like the HU protein, the GDB protein activity is still detected in crude extract after boiling for 30 min (Fig. 2, lane 7). Fig. 4 shows that purified GDB protein and HU protein form a single retardation complex with the [1 nt-gap] probe (C1 complex) that migrates at the same position (lanes 2 and 3). The identification of HU as the GDB protein purified in this study was confirmed using a mutant of E. coli, which is defective in HU protein. Indeed, the GDB protein is not detected in a crude extract from an E. coli mutant strain (hupAB), where hupA and hupB genes, coding for α and β HU subunits, respectively, were inactivated (lane 6). In contrast, crude extract from the isogenic wild type strain possesses the thermostable GDB activity (lanes 4 and 5). Furthermore, it was possible to complement a hupAB crude extract for the GDB activity by the addition of the purified GDB protein in the binding mixture (lane 7). Finally, the GDB protein and HU form the same retardation complexes in the presence of the control 30-mer oligonucleotide (data not shown). These results led us to conclude that the purified GDB protein from E. coli and the HU protein are the same protein. The HU protein was initially identified in E. coli as a DNA binding protein able to bind single- and double-stranded DNA molecules as well as ribonucleic acids in a non-sequence-specific way (22Bonnefoy E. Rouvière-Yaniv J. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 687-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 37Rouvière-Yaniv J. Yaniv M. Cell. 1979; 17: 265-274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 38Broyles S.S. Pettijohn D.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 187: 47-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Here, we show that HU protein binds specifically DNA that contains a single-stranded region of one nucleotide. To quantify this specificity, we have determined by gel retardation assay the apparent dissociation constant (KD(app)) for 30-mer DNA oligonucleotides containing either no modification ([C/G]) or a nick ([nick]) or a gap of one ([1 nt-gap]) or two ([2 nt-gap]) nucleotides (Fig. 5). Determination of dissociation constants was carried out at 200 mM KCl to use more stringent conditions for DNA binding. Using the unmodified double-stranded oligonucleotide [C/G] and within the protein concentration range used (0-10 nM), only limited formation of a C1′ complex was observed (Fig. 5 A). About 200 nM HU is needed to bind 50% of the total [C/G] DNA in three complexes (data not shown). Complex C1′ corresponds to the first complex formed between one HU heterodimer and double-stranded DNA. In contrast, only 10 nM HU is sufficient to bind the major part of the three other oligonucleotides containing DNA strand breaks in the C1 complex (Fig. 5). The HU affinity increases from the [nick] with a KD(app)= 8 nM (Fig. 5 B) to the [1 nt-gap] with a KD(app)= 4 nM (Fig. 5 C) and to the [2 nt-gap] with a KD(app)= 2 nM (Fig. 5 D). These KD(app)values show that the DNA binding increases as a function of the length of the single-stranded region. It should be noted that the C1 complex migrates faster than the C1′ complex (Fig. 5). This result may be due to structural differences contained in the complex formed between HU and unmodified DNA (C′1) and complexes formed between HU and DNA containing a nick or a short single-stranded gap (C1). An abasic site is a common DNA repair intermediate in the course of BER (8Lindahl T. Nature. 1993; 362: 709-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (4213) Google Scholar). Fig. 6 summarizes the different DNA intermediates generated by enzymes that incise DNA at AP sites in E. coli (35Graves R.J. Felzenszwalb I. Laval J. O'Connor T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14429-14435Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Kim J. Linn S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 1135-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 40Boiteux S. J. Photochem. Photobiol. B Biol. 1993; 19: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 41Dianov G. Sedgwick B. Daly G. Olsson M. Lovett S. Lindahl T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 993-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). These various structures are potential ligands for the HU protein as shown in this work. To explore this question, a 30-mer single-stranded oligonucleotide containing one uracil residue was treated with an excess of the Ung protein and then annealed with its complementary strand to generate a double-stranded oligonucleotide containing a unique AP site opposite a guanine residue (Fig. 1, [U/G] and [dr/G]). The [dr/G] duplex was then incubated with several AP nicking enzymes such as Fpg, Nth, or Nfo proteins to yield the various repair intermediates (Fig. 6). The various oligonucleotides were incubated with HU under the same conditions, and the reactions were analyzed by bandshift assays (Fig. 7). As observed with the [C/G] duplex, HU is able to recognize [U/G] and [dr/G] duplexes to yield a weak amount of the C1′ complex (lanes 2 and 7). This result indicates that an abasic site is not a preferential ligand for the HU protein compared to unmodified DNA. Conversely, nicking of abasic sites at the 5′-side by Nfo (lane 13), at the 3′-side by Nth (lane 11), and at both 3′- and 5′-sides by Fpg (lane 9) or by [Nfo/Fpg] or [Nth/Nfo] combinations (lanes 15 and 17) generate high affinity ligands for the HU protein. The resulting complexes migrate at the same position as the C1 complex corresponding to the HU-[1 nt-gap] complex (lane 19). Fig. 7 also shows that the Fpg protein formed an additional complex called C2 with unmodified [U/G] probe (lane 3). The intensity of C2 increased after excision of the uracil residue (lanes 8 and 14). This observation may reflect the relative affinities of the Fpg protein for DNAs containing no modification or abasic sites (34Castaing B. Boiteux S. Zelwer C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 389-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 42Castaing B. Geiger A. Seliger H. Nehls P. Laval J. Zelwer C. Boiteux S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2899-2905Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). These last results also suggest that Fpg protein retains a high affinity for its terminal product (a gap of one nucleoside; see Fig. 6). When both HU and Fpg are present in the assay, we observe the C1 and C2 complexes simultaneously indicating a competition between these two proteins for the gap generated by Fpg (Fig. 7, lanes 9 and 16).Figure 7:Preferential binding of HU to DNA repair intermediates. The indicated 5′-32P-labeled DNA probes are described in Fig. 1. The [U/G] probe was incubated in the presence of the Ung protein yielding the [dr/G] DNA product that contains an AP site. The resulting [dr/G] probe was further incubated in the presence of an excess of enzymes that incise DNA at AP sites yielding various DNA repair intermediates. When indicated, HU was added to the reaction mixture without elimination of the AP nicking enzyme. Incubation was carried out for 10 min at 25°C. Then, samples were loaded onto a non-denaturing gel and analyzed as before. The C1 and C1′ complexes are defined in Fig. 2. The C2 complex contained the Fpg protein and any of DNA duplexes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In this study, we have purified and characterized a GDB protein of E. coli. Together, the amino-terminal sequence and the properties of the GDB protein indicate that this protein is the HU protein. Until recently, it has been considered that HU binds DNA in a nonspecific manner (see Introduction). In this work, we show that HU recognizes specifically 30-mer double-stranded oligonucleotides containing a single nick or a gap of one or two nucleotides. Under high salt conditions used (200 mM KCl), the affinity for the [1 nt-gap] DNA is at least 100-fold higher than for the unmodified [C/G] DNA. The affinity of HU increases as the size of the gap increases. Furthermore, the complex C1 formed between HU and DNA containing a nick or a gap migrates faster than the complex C1′ formed between HU and unmodified DNA. This difference in electrophoretic mobility may reflect structural differences between the low and the high affinity complexes. Recent studies have shown that nick or gap in DNA fragments result in an increased flexibility and in the formation of V-shaped structure (11Mills J.B. Cooper J.P. Hagerman P.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1797-1803Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 12Le Cam E. Fack F. Menissier-de Murcia J. Cognet J.A.H. Barbin A. Sarantoglou V. Revet B. Delain E. de Murcia G. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 1062-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). These results are in favor of the recognition by HU of a DNA structure resulting from the presence of a nick or a gap in the oligonucleotide used. However, the recognition of the free ends of the gap by HU cannot be excluded. Our results could be compared with those of Pontiggia et al. (43Pontiggia A. Negri A. Beltrame M. Bianchi M.E. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 7: 343-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) and Bonnefoy et al. (23Bonnefoy E. Takahashi M. Rouvière-Yaniv J. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 242: 116-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) showing that HU has a high affinity for cruciform and bulged DNAs. The common feature between these structures and those that DNA fragments containing a nick or gap may adopt is the possible occurrence of a sharp angle (10Hays J.B. Zimm B.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1970; 48: 297-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 11Mills J.B. Cooper J.P. Hagerman P.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1797-1803Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 12Le Cam E. Fack F. Menissier-de Murcia J. Cognet J.A.H. Barbin A. Sarantoglou V. Revet B. Delain E. de Murcia G. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 1062-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 30Hwang D.S. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23083-23086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The angle value seems to be a critical parameter to explain this HU preferential binding. Indeed, Pontiggia et al. (43Pontiggia A. Negri A. Beltrame M. Bianchi M.E. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 7: 343-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) show that the HU affinity for cruciform DNA (KD= 10-8to 10-9M) is significantly higher than the one found for a 6-nucleotide bulge DNA (KD= 3 × 10-7M). These authors suggest that the angle produced by the A6 bulge may not be optimal for the HU recognition. Bonnefoy et al. (23Bonnefoy E. Takahashi M. Rouvière-Yaniv J. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 242: 116-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) propose that this optimal value might be 60° as found in the X-shaped conformation of the cruciform DNA. These results suggest a preferential HU binding for sharp bend or kink in DNA, which by analogy is also suggested in our data. In addition to DNA packaging function, HU is involved in several DNA processing events such as the bacteriophage Mu transposition (24Lavoie B. Choconas G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1623-1627Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the Tn10 transposition (25Morisato D. Kleckner N. Cell. 1987; 51: 101-111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), and the gene inversion (27Wada M. Kutsukake K. Komano T. Imamoto F. Kano Y. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 76: 345-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Hwang and Kornberg (30Hwang D.S. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23083-23086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have also demonstrated that HU plays a role in the initiation of the DNA replication. In this work, we show that HU binds tightly to BER intermediates in vitro, suggesting that HU may play a role in DNA repair. In vivo, the putative role of HU would at first consist in the stabilization of DNA structures containing short single-stranded regions, protecting it from further degradation by endogenous nucleases. Then, local DNA conformational changes occurring through HU binding may contribute to the formation of an active protein-DNA complex by modifying the DNA accessibility for other proteins such as the DNA polymerase I. The hypothesis suggesting that HU can modify the binding property of other cellular proteins is consistent with previous studies showing that HU can modulate specific DNA binding of regulatory proteins such as cyclic AMP receptor protein (44Flashner Y. Gralla J.D. Cell. 1988; 54: 713-721Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), integration host factor (45Bonnefoy E. Rouvière-Yaniv J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4489-4496Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and LexA repressor (46Preobrajenskaya O. Boullard A. Boubrik F. Schnarr M. Rouvière-Yaniv J. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). In eukaryotes, a similar function has been proposed for the PARP. Thus, Satoh and Lindahl (16Satoh M.S. Lindahl T. Nature. 1992; 356: 356-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (939) Google Scholar) have shown in a human cell-free system that unmodified PARP binds tightly to γ-irradiated DNA containing single-stranded breaks and that the auto-poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of the protein then provokes its release, rendering these lesions accessible to DNA repair enzymes. By analogy with PARP, the HU binding to DNA strand breaks may constitute a cellular signal that facilitates DNA repair. According to this hypothesis, the HU protein could modulate DNA repair in vivo. This model relies, however, on in vitro experiments only and requires testing in vivo. We thank Dr. J. Rouvière-Yaniv for the kind gift of HU protein and bacterial strains. We thank J. P. Le Caer for the determination by microsequencing of the amino-terminal sequence of the homogeneous GDB protein. We are grateful to Dr. C. Paoletti for constant and warm encouragement. We also thank Drs. F. Culard, T. R. O'Connor, and D. Touati for helpful discussions and critical reading of the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W1551629219,"We have previously shown that in developing chicken embryos and differentiating mouse myoblasts, the demethylation of 5-metCpGs occurs through the replacement of 5-methylcytosine by cytosine (Jost, J.

We have now purified over 30,000-fold a 5-methylcytosine-DNA glycosylase from 12-day-old chicken embryos. The enzyme copurifies with a mismatch-specific thymine-DNA glycosylase and an apyrimidic-endonuclease. The reaction product of the highly purified 5-methylcytosine-DNA glycosylase is 5-methylcytosine. The copurified apyrimidic-endonuclease activity cleaves 3′ from the apyrimidic sugar. A 52.5-kDa peptide, isolated as a single band from preparative SDS-polyacrylamide gels, has both the 5-methylcytosine-DNA glycosylase and the mismatch-specific thymine-DNA glycosylase activities. 5-Methylcytosine-DNA glycosylase has an apparent pI of 5.5-7.5 and maximal activity between pH 6.5 and 7.5. The Km for hemimethylated oligonucleotide substrate is 8 × 10-8M with a Vmax of 4 × 10-11 mol/h/μg protein. 5-Methylcytosine-DNA glycosylase binds equally well to methylated and non-methylated DNA. The enzyme reacts six times faster with the hemimethylated DNA than with the same bifilarly methylated DNA sequence, and single-stranded methylated DNA is not a substrate. The action of the enzyme is distributive. We have previously shown that in developing chicken embryos and differentiating mouse myoblasts, the demethylation of 5-metCpGs occurs through the replacement of 5-methylcytosine by cytosine (Jost, J. P.(1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 90, 4685-4688; Jost, J. P. & Jost, Y. C. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 10040-10043).

https://openalex.org/W1849664627,"GTP cyclohydrolase I is the first and rate-limiting enzyme for the biosynthesis of tetrahydrobiopterin in mammals. Previously, we reported three species of human GTP cyclohydrolase I cDNA in a human liver cDNA library (Togari, A., Ichinose, H., Matsumoto, S., Fujita, K., and Nagatsu, T. (1992) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 187, 359-365). Furthermore, very recently, we found that the GTP cyclohydrolase I gene is causative for hereditary progressive dystonia with marked diurnal fluctuation, also known as DOPA-responsive dystonia (Ichinose, H., Ohye, T., Takahashi, E., Seki, N., Hori, T., Segawa, M., Nomura, Y., Endo, K., Tanaka, H., Tsuji, S., Fujita, K., and Nagatsu, T. (1994) Nature Genetics 8, 236-242). To clarify the mechanisms that regulate transcription of the GTP cyclohydrolase I gene and to generate multiple species of mRNA, we isolated genomic DNA clones for the human and mouse GTP cyclohydrolase I genes. Structural analysis of the isolated clones revealed that the GTP cyclohydrolase I gene is encoded by a single copy gene and is composed of six exons spanning ∼30 kilobases. We sequenced all exon/intron boundaries of the human and mouse genes. Structural analysis also demonstrated that the heterogeneity of GTP cyclohydrolase I mRNA is caused by an alternative usage of the splicing acceptor site at the sixth exon. The transcription start site of the mouse GTP cyclohydrolase I gene and the 5′-flanking sequences of the mouse and human genes were determined. We performed regional mapping of the mouse gene by fluorescence in situ hybridization, and the mouse GTP cyclohydrolase I gene was assigned to region C2-3 of mouse chromosome 14. We identified missense mutations in patients with GTP cyclohydrolase I deficiency and expressed mutated enzymes in Escherichia coli to confirm alterations in the enzyme activity.

We identified missense mutations in patients with GTP cyclohydrolase I deficiency and expressed mutated enzymes in Escherichia coli to confirm alterations in the enzyme activity. GTP cyclohydrolase I (EC 3.5.4.16) catalyzes the formation of D- erythro-7,8-dihydroneopterin triphosphate from GTP. This is the first step for the de novo biosynthesis of (6 R)-(L- erythro-1′,2′-dihydroxypropyl)-2-amino-4-oxo-5,6,7,8-tetrahydropteridine (tetrahydrobiopterin) (1Nichol C.A. Smith G.K. Duch D.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 729-764Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Tetrahydrobiopterin has multiple physiological functions. It acts as an essential cofactor for three aromatic amino-acid monooxygenases, i.e. phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan hydroxylases (2Kaufman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 2677-2682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Nagatsu T. Levitt M. Udenfriend S. J. Biol.

These enzymes are essential for synthesizing hormones and neurotransmitters such as dopamine, noradrenaline, adrenaline, and serotonin. It has also been shown that tetrahydrobiopterin acts as a cofactor for the generation of nitric oxide from arginine (5Tayeh M.A. Marletta M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19654-19658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Kwon N.S. Nathan C.F. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20496-20501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Besides these cofactor roles, tetrahydrobiopterin has been suggested to be involved in the proliferation and growth of erythroid cells (7Tanaka K. Kaufman S. Milstien S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5864-5867Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The de novo biosynthesis of tetrahydrobiopterin is thought to be regulated by the activity of GTP cyclohydrolase I (1Nichol C.A. Smith G.K. Duch D.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 729-764Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the GTP cyclohydrolase I activity increases in response to various stimuli. For example, the addition of interferon-γ (8Schoedon G. Troppmair J. Fontana A. Huber C. Curtius H.-C. Niederwieser A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 166: 303-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), phytohemagglutinin (9Blau N. Joller P. Atarés M. Cardesa-Garcia J. Niederwieser A. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1985; 148: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), or kit ligand (10Ziegler I. Hültner L. Egger D. Kempkes B. Mailhammer R. Gillis S. Rödl W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12544-12551Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) greatly induces the GTP cyclohydrolase I activity. It is thus of great importance to clarify the regulatory mechanism(s) underlying the inducible expression of the GTP cyclohydrolase I gene. There have been several reports on tetrahydrobiopterin-dependent hyperphenylalaninemia caused by a deficiency in GTP cyclohydrolase I (11Niederwieser A. Blau N. Wang M. Joller P. Atarés M. Cardesa-Garcia J. Eur. J. Pediatr. 1984; 141: 208-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 12Dhondt J.-L. Farriaux J.-P. Boudha A. Largilliére C. Ringel J. Roger M.-M. Leeming R.J. J.

Pediatrics. 1987; 79: 374-378PubMed Google Scholar). Hyperphenylalaninemia caused by GTP cyclohydrolase I deficiency shows more severe symptoms than that caused by a defect in phenylalanine hydroxylase because a deficiency in GTP cyclohydrolase I impairs the biosynthesis of both catecholamines and serotonin due to the lack of tetrahydrobiopterin. Patients show severe retardation of development, severe muscular hypotonia of the trunk and hypertonia of the extremities, convulsions, and frequent episodes of hyperthermia without infections (11Niederwieser A.

Pediatrics. 1987; 79: 374-378PubMed Google Scholar). Very recently, we found that the gene for GTP cyclohydrolase I is causative for hereditary progressive dystonia with marked diurnal fluctuation (HPD),1 1The abbreviations used are: HPDhereditary progressive dystonia with marked diurnal fluctuationDRDDOPA-responsive dystoniaRT-PCRreverse transcription-polymerase chain reactionkbkilobase(s). also known as DOPA-responsive dystonia (DRD) (14Ichinose H.

This disease is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait with a low penetrance. We found that HPD/DRD patients have genetic defects in the GTP cyclohydrolase I gene only in one allele and that their GTP cyclohydrolase I activity in mononuclear blood cells is reduced to <20% of that of normal individuals. If only one allele carries the mutant gene, the enzyme activity would be expected to be decreased to about half of the control value. We assumed that the expression of GTP cyclohydrolase I in HPD/DRD patients would be lower than in normal individuals. To elucidate the etiology of HPD/DRD in more detail, we undertook molecular characterization of the GTP cyclohydrolase I gene. hereditary progressive dystonia with marked diurnal fluctuation DOPA-responsive dystonia reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction kilobase(s). GTP cyclohydrolase I cDNA was first isolated from a rat liver cDNA library (15Hatakeyama K. Inoue Y. Harada T. Kagamiyama H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 765-769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previously, we reported the isolation of three GTP cyclohydrolase I cDNA clones from human liver (16Togari A. Ichinose H. Matsumoto S. Fujita K. Nagatsu T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 187: 359-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). All three cDNAs were identical at their central and 5′-regions, but diverged at their 3′-ends. We designated these three cDNAs as types 1-3. Type 1 cDNA, which has the longest coding region, consisting of 250 amino acids, corresponds to rat (15Hatakeyama K. Inoue Y. Harada T. Kagamiyama H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 765-769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and mouse (17Nomura T. Ichinose H. Sumi-Ichinose C. Nomura H. Hagino Y. Fujita K. Nagatsu T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 191: 523-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) cDNAs. For elucidation of the mechanisms regulating the expression of the GTP cyclohydrolase I gene and the mechanism generating the molecular heterogeneity of its mRNA, structural information on the gene is indispensable. Furthermore, recent advances in murine developmental biology have made it possible to knock out a specific gene in mice. Mice having a defect in the GTP cyclohydrolase I gene would be useful for analyzing physiological roles for tetrahydrobiopterin and as an animal model of hyperphenylalaninemia caused by GTP cyclohydrolase I deficiency or HPD/DRD. In this study, we isolated and characterized the mouse and human GTP cyclohydrolase I genes. Furthermore, we assigned the chromosomal location of mouse GTP cyclohydrolase I. This is the first report on the genomic structure of the GTP cyclohydrolase I gene in mammals. A mouse genomic library, constructed in Lambda FixII phage vectors (Stratagene), was screened by use of a mouse GTP cyclohydrolase I cDNA clone (17Nomura T. Ichinose H. Sumi-Ichinose C. Nomura H. Hagino Y. Fujita K. Nagatsu T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 191: 523-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) labeled with [α-32P]dCTP. Human genomic DNA libraries, constructed in Charon 4A (donated by Dr. Tom Maniatis, Harvard University) and in EMBL3 (LI 018; donated by the Japanese Cancer Research Resources Bank), were screened with a human GTP cyclohydrolase I cDNA clone (16Togari A. Ichinose H. Matsumoto S. Fujita K. Nagatsu T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 187: 359-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) used as a probe. DNAs were isolated from the purified phage plaques following standard protocols (18Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), and the fragments of interest were subcloned into pBluescript KS (Stratagene) or pUC119 vectors for further structural analysis. The nucleotide sequences of the clones were determined by the dideoxy chain termination method (19Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (51992) Google Scholar) using Sequenase (United States Biochemical Corp.). Mouse genomic DNA (10 μg) was digested with EcoRI, HindIII, and SacI; separated according to size on a 0.8% agarose gel; and capillary-blotted onto a nylon membrane (Hybond-N+, Amersham Corp.). This membrane was hybridized with a 32P-labeled full-length cDNA clone of mouse GTP cyclohydrolase I (17Nomura T. Ichinose H. Sumi-Ichinose C. Nomura H. Hagino Y. Fujita K. Nagatsu T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 191: 523-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) in a solution consisting of 6 × SSC (1 × SSC = 0.15 M NaCl and 0.015 M sodium citrate), 5 × Denhardt's solution, 0.5% SDS, and 0.1 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA. After hybridization at 65°C overnight, the membrane was washed twice with 2 × SSC containing 0.05% SDS at room temperature for 5 min and twice with the same solution at 42°C for 15 min. Total RNA was extracted from mouse brain with guanidinium thiocyanate followed by centrifugation in cesium chloride solutions. The transcription initiation site was determined by both primer extension analysis and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. In the primer extension experiment, mouse brain poly(A)+RNA (1.5 μg) was annealed to 32P-end-labeled primer m-42R (5′-AACAAGCGCTGCGGCTCAGCT-3′) in 0.25 M KCl by heating at 65°C for 1 h, followed by incubation at room temperature for 1.5 h. The annealed primer was extended at 45°C for 1 h in a reaction mixture containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 75 mM KCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 10 mM dithiothreitol, 0.25 mM dNTPs, 110 units of RNase inhibitor, and 400 units of reverse transcriptase (SuperScript II, Life Technologies, Inc.). Then the sample was precipitated by ethanol and analyzed on a 7 M urea, 6% acrylamide sequencing gel. The DNA fragment containing exon 1 was sequenced with primer m-42R at the same time. For RT-PCR experiments, total RNA from mouse brain was reverse-transcribed with random hexamer and amplified using primer m-42R as an antisense primer and primer m-189F, m-131F, or m-122F as a sense primer. Their sequences and positions on genomic DNA are shown in Fig. 5. To remove a trace amount of genomic DNA contaminating the RNA preparation, the total RNA was subjected to digestion with RNase-free DNase I (Boehringer Mannheim) prior to the reverse transcription reaction. Amplification for 30 cycles was carried out as follows: denaturation at 94°C for 30 s and annealing and extension at 60°C for 1 min. The amplified DNA fragments were electrophoresed on 4% NuSieve GTG agarose (FMC Corp. BioProducts). The direct R-banding fluorescence in situ hybridization method (20Matsuda Y. Harada Y.-N. Natsuume-Sakai S. Lee K. Shiomi T. Chapman V.M. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1992; 61: 282-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) was used for chromosomal localization of the mouse GTP cyclohydrolase I gene. Mouse lymphocyte cultures and preparation of R-banded chromosomes were performed as described previously (20Matsuda Y. Harada Y.-N. Natsuume-Sakai S. Lee K. Shiomi T. Chapman V.M. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1992; 61: 282-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The chromosomes on slides were hardened at 65°C for 2 h, denatured at 70°C in 70% formamide in 2 × SSC, and then dehydrated in 70/85/100% ethanol series at 4°C. The HindIII-digested mouse genomic DNA fragment (3.5 kb in length) containing exon 2 was labeled by nick translation with biotinylated 16-dUTP (Boehringer Mannheim) following the manufacturer's protocol. The labeled DNA fragments were ethanol-precipitated and then denatured in 100% formamide at 75°C for 10 min. The denatured probe was mixed with an equal volume of hybridization solution to make final concentrations of 50% formamide, 2 × SSC, 10% dextran sulfate, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (Sigma). Twenty microliters of the mixture containing 250 ng of probe DNA was put on the denatured chromosomes, and the slides were then covered with Parafilm and incubated overnight at 37°C, after which they were washed for 20 min in 50% formamide in 2 × SSC at 37°C and in 2 × SSC and 1 × SSC for 20 min each at room temperature. After the slides had been rinsed in 4 × SSC, the chromosomes were heat-incubated under a coverslip with fluoresceinated avidin (Vector Labs, Inc.) at a 1:500 dilution in 1% bovine serum albumin, 4 × SSC for 45 min at 37°C. The slides were then washed with 4 × SSC, 0.1% Nonidet P-40 in 4 × SSC and with 4 × SSC for 10 min each on a shaker. After the excess liquid had been drained from the slides, the chromosomes were finally stained with 0.75 μg/ml propidium iodide. Excitation was carried out at a wavelength of 450-490 nm (Nikon filter set B-2A), and a near 365-nm filter (UV-2A) was used for observation. Kodak Ektachrome ASA 100 films were used for microphotography. Patient N. R. is the second child of healthy nonconsanguineous parents. Pregnancy and delivery at term were uneventful; breast feeding was tolerated well, and the Guthrie phenylketonuria screening test performed at the age of 4 days was normal. The child was diagnosed as hyperphenylalaninemic at the age of 5 months, presenting progressive neurological deterioration, including severe hypotonia and uncoordinated and generalized movements (Parkinson-like symptoms). Metabolic studies including analysis of pterins in urine and cerebrospinal fluid as well as measurement of GTP cyclohydrolase I activity in a liver biopsy led to the diagnosis of GTP cyclohydrolase I deficiency (Table I) (21Blau N. Ichinose H. Nagatsu T. Heizmann C.W. Zacchello F. Burlina A. J. Pediatr. 1995; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Patient N. R. is still living and is in good health (21Blau N. Ichinose H. Nagatsu T. Heizmann C.W. Zacchello F. Burlina A. J. Pediatr. 1995; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar).Table I:Biochemical data on two GTP cyclohydrolase I-deficient patients Open table in a new tab Patient M. K., a female born near term weighing 2.7 kg, was identified by newborn screening as having phenylketonuria with blood phenylalanine values >2400 μmol/liter (22Matalon R. Pediatr. Res. 1984; 18 (abstr.): 223ACrossref Google Scholar). In the first week of life, the baby developed feeding problems, poor sucking, and poor muscle tone. At the age of 6 months, in spite of good control of blood phenylalanine levels, the baby was found to be delayed in development. By the age of 2 years, the child was unable to walk and developed seizures and choreoathetosis. Urinary pterins showed a profound deficiency in neopterin and biopterin (Table I). The same deficiency was found in the plasma (data not shown). Administration of tetrahydrobiopterin, 5-hydroxytryptophan, and L-DOPA/carbidopa reduced the blood phenylalanine level and improved the choreoathetosis. Patient M. K. died at the age of 10 years. Diagnosis was confirmed post-mortem by the measurement of the enzyme activity in the liver. Genomic DNA was extracted from primary skin fibroblasts. We amplified exons for GTP cyclohydrolase I including splicing junctions using PCR on genomic DNA. Primer sequences used for amplification of exons were as follows: exon 1, 5′-GTTTAGCCGCAGACCTCGAAGCG-3′ and 5′-GAGGCAACTCCGGAAACTTCCTG-3′; exon 2, 5′-GTAACGCTCGCTTATGTTGACTGTC-3′ and 5′-ACCTGAGATATCAGCAATTGGCAGC-3′; exon 3, 5′-AGATGTTTTCAAGGTAATACATTGTCG-3′ and 5′-TAGATTCTCAGCAGATGAGGGCAG-3′; exon 4, 5′-GTCCTTTTTGTTTTATGAGGAAGGC-3′ and 5′-GGTGATGCACTCTTATAATCTCAGC-3′; exon 5, 5′-GTGTCAGACTCTCAAACTGAGCTC-3′ and 5′-TCACTTCTAGTGCACCATTATGACG-3′; and exon 6, 5′-ACCAAACCAGCAGCTGTCTACTCC-3′ and 5′-AATGCTACTGGCAGTACGATCGG-3′. PCR amplification was performed in a reaction volume of 25 μl containing 100 ng of genomic DNA, 10 pmol of each primer, 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 50 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 5% dimethyl sulfoxide, 0.2 unit of Perfectmatch (Stratagene), and 1.25 units of Taq polymerase (Perkin-Elmer). After having been heated at 94°C for 3 min, the reaction mixture was cycled according to the following program: 30 cycles for 30 s at 94°C and for 1 min at 60°C and a final extension at 60°C for 6 min. The PCR products were sequenced directly with the same primers used for amplification by use of an automatic DNA sequencer (Perkin-Elmer Model 373A) and a DyeDeoxy Terminator Cycle sequencing kit. To perform oligonucleotide-directed in vitro mutagenesis, we followed the manufacturer's protocol for the Sculptor in vitro mutagenesis system (Amersham Corp.). We used plasmid Bluescript KS containing human GTP cyclohydrolase I cDNA (hGCH1) (16Togari A. Ichinose H. Matsumoto S. Fujita K. Nagatsu T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 187: 359-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) as a template for construction of mutant GTP cyclohydrolase I cDNAs by site-directed mutagenesis. Although the hGCH1 cDNA clone lacked the first 25 bases corresponding to nine amino acids from the starting methionine, the first nine amino acids in the human sequence do not seem to be important for the activity since mouse and rat enzymes lack these nine residues. The mutagenesis primers were 5′-GCAACACACATATGTATGGTAATG-3′ for the generation of the M211I mutation and 5′-GTTCAGGAGCACCTTACAAAAC-3′ for the generation of R184H (the mutated nucleotides are underlined). The integrity of the newly constructed mutant cDNAs was checked by sequencing the plasmids. Wild-type and mutant cDNAs were introduced into the EcoRI site of a pGEX-2T vector (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), which can express a foreign gene as the fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase. E. coli strain BL21 cells carrying each plasmid were cultured at 37°C to late-log phase, and the expression of the desired protein was induced by the addition of isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside. Expressed proteins were analyzed by SDS-10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. GTP cyclohydrolase I activities were measured as described previously (14Ichinose H. Ohye T. Takahashi E. Seki N. Hori T. Segawa M. Nomura Y. Endo K. Tanaka H. Tsuji S. Fujita K. Nagatsu T. Nature Genetics. 1994; 8: 236-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar) with crude homogenate used as an enzyme source. Proteins were determined by the method of Bradford (23Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (208747) Google Scholar) with bovine γ-globulin used as a standard. Student's t test was used for statistical evaluation of the mutated enzyme activity expressed in E. coli. Using the cloned mouse GTP cyclohydrolase I cDNA (17Nomura T. Ichinose H. Sumi-Ichinose C. Nomura H. Hagino Y. Fujita K. Nagatsu T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 191: 523-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) as a probe, we isolated five overlapping genomic DNA clones by screening a mouse genomic library constructed in λFixII (mgGCH1-5) (Fig. 1). Structural analysis of these clones revealed that the complete mouse GTP cyclohydrolase I gene is ∼32 kb in length and consists of a total of six exons. We sequenced the exons and their splice sites. As shown in Fig. 2, each exon/intron boundary conformed perfectly to the GT/AG rule (24Breathnach R. Chambon P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 349-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (3281) Google Scholar).Figure 2:Exon/intron boundary sequences of the mouse GTP cyclohydrolase I gene. Exon sequences are written in upper-case letters and intron sequences in lower-case letters. Sequences are numbered with the first base of the ATG initiation codon designated as position +1 (nucleotides within introns are not numbered). Sizes of both exons and introns are indicated. AATAAA as a polyadenylation signal (24) is underlined. b, bases.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To determine the copy number of the GTP cyclohydrolase I gene, we performed genomic DNA blot hybridization analysis. High molecular weight DNA samples were digested with the restriction enzymes EcoRI, HindIII, and SacI; separated electrophoretically on an agarose gel; and then transferred to a nylon membrane. The membrane was then hybridized with the mouse cDNA clone (Fig. 3). The sizes of bands showed good coincidence with those predicted from the restriction enzyme site mapping of the genomic DNA clones. This result suggests that GTP cyclohydrolase I is specified by a single copy gene. The transcription start site was determined by primer extension analysis and was confirmed by RT-PCR analysis as described under “Materials and Methods.” Primer extension analysis was performed with a 32P-end-labeled oligonucleotide (m-42R) located in exon 1 and with poly(A)+RNA from mouse liver. As shown in Fig. 4 A, this experiment yielded a major primer-extended product of 125 nucleotides with minor products ranging from 123 to 126 nucleotides. The length of the fragment mapped the initiation site around the guanine nucleotide at position −164. To confirm this result, we performed RT-PCR analysis using m-42R as an antisense primer and m-122F, m-131F, or m-189F as a sense primer (Fig. 4 B). Total RNA from mouse liver generated amplified products of the expected size with primers m-122F and m-131F, whereas primer m-189F showed no band (Fig. 4 B, lanes 1-3). These three primers correctly amplified the plasmid DNA containing exon 1 (Fig. 4 B, lanes 4-6). These results indicate that the 5′-end of the mRNA is present between primers m-131F and m-189F. This agreed with the result of the primer extension analysis. On the basis of these two results, the transcription start site of mouse GTP cyclohydrolase I mRNA was determined to be around guanine at position −164, ranging from cytidine at position −162 to adenine at position −165. The nucleotide sequence of the 5′-flanking region was determined to ∼620 base pairs upstream from the transcription start site and is shown in Fig. 5. This sequence has been submitted to the DDBJ data base. No obvious TATA box was observed in the promoter region. Instead, an AT-rich putative promoter motif (ATAAAAA) or a CCAAT box was present just upstream or 50 base pairs upstream from the transcription start site, respectively. In addition, H1 box (25Dalton S. Wells J.R.E. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 49-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) -, IBP-1b (26Blanar M.A. Baldwin A.S. Flavell R.A. Sharp P.A.

Cell Genet. 1992; 61: 282-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) was performed for chromosomal localization of the mouse GTP cyclohydrolase I gene, with a HindIII-digested genomic DNA fragment (3.5 kb in length) containing exon 2 used as a probe. The signals were localized to the region of C2-3 on chromosome 14 (data not shown). The standard G- and R-banded karyotypes have been reported by Matsuda et al. (20Matsuda Y. Harada Y.-N. Natsuume-Sakai S. Lee K. Shiomi T. Chapman V.M. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1992; 61: 282-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). We previously isolated three species of cDNA encoding GTP cyclohydrolase I from a human liver cDNA library (16Togari A. Ichinose H. Matsumoto S. Fujita K. Nagatsu T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 187: 359-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). All three cDNAs were identical at their central and 5′-regions, but diverged at their 3′-ends. To clarify the mechanism(s) that generate this heterogeneity of GTP cyclohydrolase I mRNA, we analyzed the human GTP cyclohydrolase I gene structure. Using a cDNA clone as a probe, we isolated three genomic DNA clones from genomic DNA libraries constructed in Charon 4A (hgGCH6) or EMBL3 (hgGCH5 and hgGCH10) (Fig. 6). Clone hgGCH5 contained exon 1; hgGCH10 contained exon 2; and hgGCH6 contained exons 4-6. Exon 3 was missing in these clones, although the clones encompassed >30 kb of human chromosomal DNA. To search for exon 3, we used PCR to amplify genomic DNA from the end of hgGCH10 to exon 3. PCR amplified a DNA fragment with a length of ∼1 kb. Sequence analysis of the fragment revealed that the correct DNA region was amplified. The length between exons 3 and 4 was determined by PCR. The recently developed long PCR technology enabled us to amplify the entire DNA region between exons 3 and 4, which showed a length of 9 kb. Structural analysis of these clones revealed that the human GTP cyclohydrolase I gene consists of six exons. We sequenced exon/intron boundaries, and these sequences have been submitted to GenBank™. Break points between exons were completely identical to those of the mouse gene (Fig. 7). Each exon/intron boundary conformed to the GT/AG rule (24Breathnach R. Chambon P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 349-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (3281) Google Scholar). A marked difference between the human and mouse GTP cyclohydrolase I genes was observed in the last exon (exon 6). We also isolated human cDNAs from a human pheochromocytoma cDNA library and sequenced a cDNA of 2.4 kb in length. The cDNA clone had an open reading frame corresponding to type 1 (a common type in human, rat,"

https://openalex.org/W1542309964,"We conducted an extensive mass isotopomer analysis of citric acid cycle and gluconeogenic metabolites isolated from livers of overnight fasted rats perfused with 4 mM glucose, 0.2 mM octanoate, 1 mM [U-13C3]lactate, and 0.2 mM [U-13C3]pyruvate, in the anterograde or retrograde mode. In both perfusion modes, two distinct isotopomer patterns were observed: (i) those of phosphoenolpyruvate, glucose, malate, and aspartate and (ii) those of citrate, α-ketoglutarate, glutamate, and glutamine. Key citric acid cycle parameters and, hence, rates of gluconeogenesis, calculated (Lee, W.-N. P. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 13002-13004 and Lee, W.-N. P. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 25522-25526) from our mass isotopomer data did not only vary, but lead to conclusions inconsistent with Lee's citric acid cycle model. Compared to lactate and pyruvate uptake, which sets an upper limit to glucose production, rates of gluconeogenesis calculated (i) with the phosphoenolpyruvate and citrate data were similar, but those calculated (ii) with the glutamate data amounted to only 60%, which is unlikely. All these conclusions are independent of the perfusion modes. We provide evidence that the following processes contribute to the observed labeling discrepancy: (i) the reversibility of the isocitrate dehydrogenase reaction and (ii) an active citrate cleavage pathway for the transfer of the oxaloacetate carbon skeleton from mitochondria to the cytosol. Also, a good fit of our labeling data was obtained with a model of citric acid cycle and gluconeogenesis which we developed to incorporate the above reactions (Fernandez, C. A., and Des Rosiers, C. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 10037-10042). The following conclusions can be drawn from the calculated reaction rates: (i) about half of the lactate conversion to glucose occurs via the citrate cleavage pathway, (ii) the flux through the reversal of the isocitrate dehydrogenase reaction is almost as fast as that through the citrate synthase reaction, and (iii) the flux through citrate synthase and α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase is 1.6- and 3.2-fold that through pyruvate carboxylase, respectively.

Quantitation Physiology and Mathematical Modeling. Wiley, NY1982: 201-219Google Scholar) initially introduced a method based on the relatively simple CAC model of Strisower et al. (1Strisower Ε.H. Kohler G.D. Chaikoff I.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1952; 198: 115-126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) which assumes that pyruvate is solely utilized by pyruvate carboxylase (PC), with negligible pyruvate recycling through pyruvate kinase (PK) and no reincorporation of 14CO2 into glucose. Hetenyi′s method requires a separate experiment with [2−14C]acetate infusion and measurements of 14C in glucose and CO2. Another method to correct for isotopic exchange using [2−14C]acetate was proposed by Katz (6Katz J. Am. J. Physiol. 1985; 248: R391-R399PubMed Google Scholar) which involves the measurements of the specific activity of carbons 1 and 2 (C-1 + −2) of plasma ketone bodies. However, the use of labeled acetate to trace hepatic metabolism has been questioned (7Rognstad R. Med. Sci. Res. 1988; 16: 293-294Google Scholar, 8Schumann W.C. Magnusson I. Chandramouli V. Kumaran K. Wahren J. Landau B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6985-6990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This tracer is mainly utilized in extrahepatic tissues, and its incorporation into glucose occurs mostly via reincorporation of 14CO2 generated extrahepatically (8Schumann W.C. Magnusson I. Chandramouli V. Kumaran K. Wahren J. Landau B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6985-6990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, Kelleher (9Kelleher J.K. Am. J.

Some of these assumptions could be tested by measuring the distribution of label in a five- or six-carbon CAC intermediate (9, 10). gluconeogenesis or gluconeogenic anterograde three carbon precursors citric acid cycle dilution factor gas chromatography-mass spectrometry isocitrate dehydrogenase α-ketoglutarate mass to charge ratio unlabeled mass isotopomer labeled mass isotopomer with i atoms of 13C mass isotopomer distribution absolute molar percent enrichment relative molar percent enrichment N-methyl-AT-(t-butyldimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide oxaloacetate pyruvate carboxylase pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphoenolpyruvate pyruvate kinase retrograde t-butyldimethylsilyl. C-1 + 2 + 3 and similar annotations refer to the carbons of a given molecule, with the number indicating the carbon position. The search for a specific tracer of hepatic metabolism has been helped by Magnusson et al. (11Magnusson I. Schumann W.C. Bartsch G.E. Chandramouli V. Kumaran K. Wahren J. Landau B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6975-6984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) who developed a technique for the noninvasive sampling of liver CAC metabolites. This technique involves intravenous infusion of [3−14C]lactate and ingestion of gram amounts of phenylacetate. In human and primate liver, phenylacetate is conjugated as phenylacetylglutamine which is excreted in urine. The labeling of the glutamine moiety of urinary phenylacetylglutamine reflects presumably that of liver α-ketoglutarate (αKG). Carbons 4 and 5 (C-4 + −5) of αKG derive from acetyl-CoA and carbons 1, 2, and 3 (C-1 + −2 + −3) derive from OAA, the precursor of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP). Relative fluxes of GNG and of the CAC, as well as the dilution factor between pyruvate and PEP, were determined from the labeling pattern of phenylacetylglutamine. Data were computed using equations based on a modified CAC model initially proposed by Katz (6Katz J. Am. J. Physiol. 1985; 248: R391-R399PubMed Google Scholar). Using a modification of this approach, we calculated absolute fluxes of GNG and CAC in rat livers perfused with [3−13C]lactate and [3−13C]pyruvate (12Di Donate L. Des Rosiers C. Montgomery J.Α. David F. Garneau M. Brunengraber H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4170-4180PubMed Google Scholar). Computation involved substrate balances and determination of the 13C labeling pattern of glutamate by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GCMS). Our data support the use of labeled lactate and/or pyruvate for tracing hepatic metabolism in vivo. The model used to calculate the rates of the CAC and of GNG from the labeling pattern of glutamate (11Magnusson I. Schumann W.C. Bartsch G.E. Chandramouli V. Kumaran K. Wahren J. Landau B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6975-6984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) assumes homogeneous labeling of all CAC and GNG intermediates. Various authors have reported apparent incompatibility between the labeling patterns of some hepatic CAC and GNG intermediates (13Müllhofer G. Schwab Α. Müller C. Von Stetten C. Gruber Ε. Eur J.

This labeling heterogeneity might result from (i) liver zonation, (ii) different populations of cells in liver, (iii) different populations of mitochondria, (iv) different subpools of liver mitochondrial metabolites, (v) metabolic channeling due to enzyme-enzyme interactions, or (vi) omission of reactions in the model. To investigate this question, we took advantage of the possibilities of calculating key parameters of CAC and GNG from the mass isotopomer distribution (MID) of various intermediates labeled from [U-13C6]glucose, [U-13C3]lactate, or [U-13C3] pyruvate using equations developed by Lee and co-workers (21Lee W.-N. P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13002-13004Google Scholar, 22Katz J. Lee W.-N. P. Wals P.Α. Bergner E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12994-13001Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Lee W.-N. P.

Chem. 1993; 268: 25522-25526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Whether or not pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) and/or PK activities are neglected, the calculation requires either solving a quadratic equation (21Lee W.-N. P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13002-13004Google Scholar) or a more complex mathematical treatment (24Lee W.-N. P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25522-25526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We perfused rat livers in the anterograde and retrograde modes with physiological concentrations of [U-13C3] lactate and [U-13C3]pyruvate. We analyzed the data with the various models available and with a model we developed. Our data show that most of the apparent labeling heterogeneity that we also observed results from the reversibility of the isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICDH) reaction and the involvement of ATP-citrate lyase in GNG from lactate. Part of this work was presented in abstract form (25Di Donato L. Laplante Α. David F. Brunengraber H. Des Rosiers C.

Enzymes, coenzymes, and biochemicals were purchased from Sigma, Aldrich Chemicals, Boehringer Mannheim, and Fisher Scientific. Sodium [U-13C3]lactate (99%), sodium [U-13C3]pyruvate (99%), sodium [3-l3C]pyruvate (99%), and sodium [2,3−13C2]pyruvate (99%) were obtained from Merck Sharp & Dohme Isotopes. L-[U-3H]malate was purchased from ICN Radiochemicals. N-Methyl-N-(t-butyldimethylsilyl) trifluoroacetamide (MTBSTFA), pentafluorobenzoxylamine hydrochloride, and pyridine (silylation grade) were obtained from Regis Chemical Co. (Morton Grove, IL). NaBH4 was dissolved in 0.1 M NaOH to a final concentration of 1 m. All solutions were made with water purified by a “Milli-Q” system (Millipore). Open-circuit perfusion of rat livers in the anterograde mode was performed as described previously (19Des Rosiers C. David F. Garneau M. Brunengraber H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1574-1578Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Brunengraber H. Boutry M. Lowenstein J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 2656-2669Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Perfusion of liver in the retrograde mode first involved perfusion in the anterograde mode via a portal canula, followed by instantaneous switching to the retrograde mode. The procedure minimized liver swelling as indicated by the only slightly greater wet weight of livers perfused in the retrograde than anterograde mode (7.1 ± 0.5 versus 5.6 ± 0.4 g). Livers isolated from overnight starved rats (120−135 g; Sprague-Dawley, Charles River Laboratories) were perfused at 15 ml/min at 37°C for 25 min with non-recirculating Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer containing 4 mM glucose, 1.0 mM lactate, 0.2 mM pyruvate, 0.2 mM octanoate, and 0.2 mM acetate, in the anterograde or retrograde mode. At 10 min, unlabeled lactate and pyruvate were replaced with [U-l3C3]lactate and [U-13C3]pyruvate. Samples of effluent perfusate were collected every 2 min starting at 18.5 min and immediately treated with perchloric acid (final concentration 4%). At 25 min, livers were freeze-clamped and kept in liquid N2. All samples were analyzed on a Hewlett Packard 5988A GCMS equipped with an HP-5 fused silica capillary column (25 m or 50 m, 0.2 mm inside diameter, 0.33 μm film thickness). Split injection ratio: about 10; carrier gas: helium 0.6−0.8 ml/min; injection port at 270°C; transfer line to the mass spectrometer at 280°C; positive ion electron impact: 70 eV. Appropriate ion sets were monitored with a dwell time of 120 ms per ion. 13C Labeling of PEP and of the PEP Moiety of Related Metabolites (Glucose: C-4 + −5 + −6, Citrate: C-2 + −3 + −6, Malate, Aspartate, Glutamate, and Glutamine: C-1 + −2 + −3) The neutralized perchloric acid extracts, corresponding to about 3 g of liver, were spiked with 5 × 104 dpm of [U-3H]malate, diluted 4-fold, and loaded onto 30 × 1.5 cm Bio-Rad AG 1-X8-Cl− columns. The columns were developed with 100 ml of H2O, 50 ml of 15 mM HC1 to isolate glutamate and aspartate, 120 ml of 60 mM HC1 to isolate malate and citrate, and 120 ml of 200 mM HC1 to isolate PEP. The water effluents were diluted 2-fold and loaded onto 30 × 1.5 cm Bio-Rad AG 50-X8-H+ columns, which were developed with 120 ml of H2O to isolate glucose and 100 ml of 1.5 n HC1 to isolate glutamine. Malate was identified by 3H counting, whereas glutamate (28Bernt E. Bergmeyer H.U. Bergmeyer H.U. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. Vol. 4. Academic Press, New York1974: 1704-1708Crossref Google Scholar), aspartate (29Bergmeyer H.U. Bernt E. Mollering H. Pfleiderer G. Bergmeyer H.U. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. Vol. 4.

Academic Press, New York1974: 1719-1722Google Scholar) were identified by enzymatic assays. Glucose was similarly isolated from the effluent perfusate. Fractions corresponding to each metabolite were pooled. The 13C labeling of PEP and of the PEP moiety of the above metabolites was determined after enzymatic conversion and/or chemical conversion, followed by derivatization: citrate, malate, aspartate to the oxime of pyruvic acid, PEP to the pentafluorobenzoxime of pyruvic acid, and glutamate to glutamine. The pyruvic oxime and pentafluorobenzoxime and the glutamine residues were then converted to t-butyldimethylsilyl (TBDMS) derivatives and glucose to an aldonitrile-pentaacetate derivative. Fractions containing PEP were processed (12Di Donate L. Des Rosiers C. Montgomery J.Α. David F. Garneau M. Brunengraber H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4170-4180PubMed Google Scholar) for conversion to pyruvate and then reacted with 30 μmol of pentafluorobenzoxylamine hydrochloride for 15 min at room temperature. The fractions containing malate were adjusted to pH 8.5 with 1 n NaOH and evaporated down to 2.5 ml under a stream of air at 65 °C before addition of 0.25 ml of 0.5 M triethanolamine buffer, pH 7.4, containing 100 mM MgSO4, and 50 mM EDTA, 10 mg of NADP, and 0.4 unit of malic enzyme. The reaction mixture was incubated at 37°C for 90 min. The fractions containing citrate were adjusted to pH 8.5 and treated with an excess of NABH4 (100 μmol) to convert pyruvate, co-eluting with citrate on the AG 1-X8 column (19Des Rosiers C. David F.

After 30 min, the solution was acidified with HC1 to destroy residual NABH4, adjusted to pH 7.0, and lyophilized. The residue was dissolved in 2.5 ml of H2O before addition of 0.25 ml of 0.5 M triethanolamine buffer, pH 7.4, containing 100 mM MgSO4, and 50 mM EDTA, 10 mg of NADH, 12 units of malate dehydrogenase, and 3.2 units of citrate lyase. The reaction mixture was incubated for 60 min, acidified with HC1 to destroy residual NADH, and readjusted to pH 7.4 with 1 n KOH. Ten mg of NADP and 0.4 unit of malic enzyme were then added before another 90-min incubation. An aliquot of about 0.25 μmol was evaporated to 200 μl under a stream of air at 45°C. The residue was dissolved in 0.5 ml of 67 mM phosphate, pH 7.2, 0.1 ml of 0.1 M α-ketoglutarate, 0.05 ml of 12 mM NADH, 0.3 ml of 0.04 M MgCl2, 0.03 ml of 23 mM NADP, 150 units of malate dehydrogenase, 10 units of glutamate-OAA transaminase, and 0.4 unit of malic enzyme and incubated for 90 min. The solutions containing pyruvate derived from citrate, malate, and aspartate were treated with hydroxylamine hydrochloride (12Di Donate L. Des Rosiers C. Montgomery J.Α. David F. Garneau M. Brunengraber H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4170-4180PubMed Google Scholar) to form pyruvic oxime. These samples and those containing pyruvic pentafluorobenzoxime (derived from PEP) were extracted and converted to TBDMS derivatives (12Di Donate L. Des Rosiers C. Montgomery J.Α. David F. Garneau M. Brunengraber H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4170-4180PubMed Google Scholar). For GCMS analysis, the column temperature initially set at 150 °C for 3 min was increased by 5 °C/min until 250 °C and kept at this temperature for 10 min. The TBDMS derivatives of pyruvic oxime and pentafluorobenzoxime elute at 8 and 11.5 min, respectively. The ion sets monitored at these times were at m/z 274 to 277 and 340 to 343. An aliquot of about 0.5 μmol of glutamate was evaporated to 200 μl under a stream of air at 45°C before enzymatic conversion to glutamine (12Di Donate L. Des Rosiers C. Montgomery J.Α. David F. Garneau M. Brunengraber H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4170-4180PubMed Google Scholar) which was assayed as the tetra-TBDMS derivative. The ion set monitored was at m/z 258−261, which includes carbons 1, 2, and 3 of glutamine or glutamate (12Di Donate L. Des Rosiers C. Montgomery J.Α. David F. Garneau M. Brunengraber H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4170-4180PubMed Google Scholar). Glucose was analyzed as an aldonitrile-pentaacetate derivative (32Beylot M. Previs S. David F. Brunengraber H. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 212: 526-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 33Tserng K.Y. Kalhan S.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1983; 245: E476-E482PubMed Google Scholar). The ion set monitored was at m/z 217−220 which includes carbons 4, 5, and 6 of the glucose molecule. The 13C labeling of liver pyruvate, lactate, citrate, αKG, malate, fumarate and succinate (34Des Rosiers C. Fernandez C.Α. David F. Brunengraber H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27179-27182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), glutamate (after conversion to glutamine) and glutamine (12Di Donate L. Des Rosiers C. Montgomery J.Α. David F. Garneau M. Brunengraber H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4170-4180PubMed Google Scholar), and liver and effluent glucose (as a pentaacetate (32Beylot M. Previs S. David F. Brunengraber H. Anal.

Diabetologia. 1990; 33: 449-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar)) was determined by published methods. All of the ion sets monitored included the entire carbon skeleton of the molecule. Except for citrate and glucose, the ions were formed through the loss of the t-butyl group [M − 57]+ from the molecular ion. The ions at m/z 459−463 of the tetra-TBDMS-citrate are formed through the loss of the t-butyldimethylsilanol from the [M − 57]+ fragment. The formation of the tetra-TBDMS derivative of citrate was confirmed by the presence of a [M + H]+ ion at m/z 649 after analysis by ammonia-positive chemical ionization mode (not shown). The ions at m/z 331−337 of glucose pentaacetate correspond to the loss of the acetyl group [M − 59]+ from the pentaacetate radical (32Beylot M. Previs S. David F. Brunengraber H. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 212: 526-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 35Tissot S. Normand S. Guilluy R. Pachiaudi C. Beylot M. Laville M. Cohen R. Mornex R. Riou J.P. Diabetologia. 1990; 33: 449-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The fractions containing aspartate were pooled, neutralized, and lyophilized, and the residues reacted with 10 μl of MTBSTFA and 30 μl of acetonitrile for 2 h at 85 °C. For GCMS analysis, the column temperature initially set at 150°C for 1 min was increased by 5 °C/min until 205 °C, then by 50 °C/min until 250 °C and kept at this temperature for 9 min. The tri-TBDMS derivative of aspartate elutes at 17.4 min. The ion set monitored was at m/z 418−422, corresponding to the loss of the t-butyl group [M − 57]+ from the molecular ion. To determine the 13C labeling of pyruvate and lactate in the influent and effluent perfusate, samples were processed as described above for liver pyruvate and lactate, except that samples were extracted with diethyl ether. Concentrations of acetoacetate and β-hydroxybutyrate (36Williamson D.H. Mellanby J. Bergmeyer H.U. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. Vol. 4. Academic Press, New York1974: 1836-1839Crossref Google Scholar), pyruvate and lactate (37Gutman I. Wahlefeld A.W. Bergmeyer H.U. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. Vol. 4. Academic Press, New York1974: 1464-1468Google Scholar), and glucose (30Bergmeyer H.U. Bernt E. Schmidt F. Stock H. Bergmeyer H.U. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. Vol. 3. Academic Press, New York1974: 1196-1201Google Scholar) were determined enzymatically in neutralized perchloric acid extracts of perfusate. ATP-citrate lyase activity was determined (38Takeda Y. Susuki F. Inoue H. Methods Enzymol. 1969; 13: 153-160Crossref Scopus (125) Google Scholar) in cytosolic extracts of livers isolated from fed and 1-day and 2-day starved rats. The total molar percent enrichment (MPE) in 13C-labeled mass isotopomers, as well as the absolute and relative MPE of individual relabeled mass isotopomers (M + i), of a given metabolite, was calculated as follows: TotalabsoluteMPE=totalMPE=%ΣAM+i/[AM+ΣAM+i]Eq. 1 AbsoluteMPE(M+i)=MPEM+i)=%AM+i/[AM+ΣAM+i]Eq. 2 RelativeMPE(M+i)=MPERELM+i)=%AM+i/[AM+ΣAM+i]Eq. 3 where AM and AM + i represents the peak area, corrected for natural abundance (12Di Donate L. Des Rosiers C. Montgomery J.Α. David F. Garneau M. Brunengraber H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4170-4180PubMed Google Scholar, 39Des Rosiers C. Montgomery J.Α. Desrochers S. Garneau M. David F.

(1994) Proceedings of the International Federation of Automatic Control Symposium, pp. 367-368Google Scholar), corresponding to the unlabeled (M) and 13C-labeled (M + i) mass isotopomers, respectively. Because Equation 3 does not include in its denominator the term AM, the relative MID is not sensitive to simple dilution by unlabeled metabolites. The rate of production of M + 3 glucose, labeled with 13C on C-1 + −2 + −3 and/or C-4 + −5 + −6 (μmol of C3 units min−1.g−1 wet weight), is calculated as follows: 2×(MPEM+3C-4+5+6glucoseintheeffluentperfusate×([glucose]intheeffluentperfusate(μmol/ml))(MPE(M+3)ofincomingpyruvate)×(flowrate(ml.min))×(liverwetweight(g))Eq. 4 where the MPE of M + 3 C-4 + −5 + −6 glucose was measured using the ion set at m/z 217−220 of the aldonitrile-pentaacetate derivative. Since this fragment includes only C-4 + −5 + −6 of glucose, the equation includes a factor of 2. Further analysis of the perfusate glucose as the pentaacetate derivative at the m/z 331−337 ion set, which includes all carbons of the molecule, indicated similar labeling of the C-4 + −5 + −6 and C-1 + −2 + −3 moieties of glucose: the total 13C content of M + 3 and M + 6 glucose was twice that measured for [4,5,6−13C3]glucose with the 217−221 ion set (not shown). The rate of GNG (μmol C3 units min−1 g−1) was then calculated as follows: =ProductionofM+3glucose(μmolC3unitsmin-1g-1)×DFEq. 5 where DF is the dilution factor between pyruvate and PEP. DF was calculated from (i) the ratio (M + 3 MPE of extracellular pyruvate)/(M + 3 MPE of liver PEP) and from (ii) the MID of PEP or of the PEP moiety of related metabolites using the equations of Lee (21, see below for more detail). The MPE (absolute or relative 2Since Lee′s equations rely on mass isotopomer enrichment ratios, identical CAC parameters are calculated when labeling data are expressed as absolute (Equation 2) or relative MPE (Equation 3). ) in M + 1, M + 2, and M + 3 isotopomers of PEP were introduced into the equations developed by Lee (21Lee W.-N. P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13002-13004Google Scholar) to estimate the CAC parameters, Y, the ratio of activity PC/CAC, and A, the fraction of M + 3 OAA labeled on carbons 1, 2, and 3. Parameter A reflects the degree of isotope randomization in OAA resulting from reversible malate dehydrogenase and fumarase reactions and varies between 0.5, indicating complete label randomization, and 1, indicating no randomization. Similarly, these equations allow calculation of Y and A from the MID of the corresponding PEP moiety of citrate (C-2 + −3 + −6), malate (C-1 + −2 + −3) and aspartate (C-1 + −2 + −3), αKG (C-1 + −2 + −3), glutamate (C-1 + −2 + −3), and glutamine (C-1 + −2 + −3). Briefly, this involves solving the following quadratic equation for R: (0.5+0.25ω)R2+0.5R-ω=0Eq. 6 where w = v/(1 + u), u = MPE (M + 2)/MPE (M + 3), and v = MPE (M + 1)/MPE (M + 3). Y is then obtained: Y=(1-R)/REq. 7 For PEP and for the PEP moiety of citrate (C-2 + −3 + −6), malate (C-l + −2 + −3), and aspartate (C-1 + −2 + −3): A=(1+0.5R)/(1+u)Eq. 8 For the PEP moiety of αKG, glutamate, and glutamine (C-1 + −2 + −3): (1-A)=(1+0.5R)/(1+u)Eq. 9 Y and A then allow calculation of the dilution between the M + 3 MPE of extracellular pyruvate and liver PEP: DF=1/[A×(Y/(1+Y)]Eq. 10 The above equations were developed on the basis of a CAC model which assumed steady state conditions and negligible PDH and PK activities. Recently, Lee modified his equations to include the latter enzymatic reactions (24Lee W.-N. P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25522-25526Abstract Full Text PDF"

We now show that hydrophobic peptides and ionophores also interact with the multidrug transporter. Multidrug-resistant cells are cross-resistant to several hydrophobic peptides and ionophores, but not to some other membrane-active species. Linear peptides, cyclic peptides, and ionophores stimulated the ATPase activity of P-glycoprotein in plasma membrane vesicles by up to 2.5-fold. Drugs and chemosensitizers were able to block P-glycoprotein ATPase stimulation by verapamil, however, peptides and ionophores (with the exception of cyclosporine A) were unable to do so. Peptides and ionophores also effectively inhibited ATP-dependent drug transport by P-glycoprotein in plasma membrane vesicles. The median effect analysis was used to extract quantitative parameters from the drug transport inhibition data. Unlike drug substrates and cyclic peptides, linear peptides did not inhibit photoaffinity labeling of P-glycoprotein by [3H]azidopine. Taken together, these results indicate that certain hydrophobic peptides and ionophores are P-glycoprotein substrates, however, they affect the transporter in a different manner from drugs. Linear peptides interact with P-glycoprotein at a site distinct from those for verapamil and azidopine, whereas the interaction site for cyclic peptides and ionophores appears to be linked to these sites to varying degrees.

Export of hydrophobic peptides may be an important physiological function of P-glycoprotein. The resistance of tumors to multiple chemotherapeutic drugs is a serious barrier to the treatment of human cancer. A common form of multidrug resistance is caused by the overexpression of a 170-180-kDa plasma membrane protein, the P-glycoprotein or multidrug transporter. This protein is a member of the ABC (ATP-binding cassette) (1Higgins C.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 67-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (3386) Google Scholar) or traffic ATPase (2Ames G.F.-L. Lecar H. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 2660-2666Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) superfamily, and is proposed to function as an ATP-driven drug efflux pump. Recently, we reconstituted P-glycoprotein into proteoliposomes, and demonstrated that it is indeed an active transporter, pumping drugs up a concentration gradient, powered by concomitant ATP hydrolysis (3Sharom F.J. Yu X. Doige C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24197-24202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One intriguing aspect of P-glycoprotein biochemistry concerns its ability to interact with, and transport, many structurally distinct classes of compounds, which suggests the possibility of multiple or overlapping drug-binding domains on the transporter. Drugs transported by P-glycoprotein are, in general, lipophilic, and it has been proposed that the drug-binding site(s) may reside within the transmembrane domains. This hypothesis is consistent with reports that these regions of P-glycoprotein are photolabeled by hydrophobic ligands (4Raviv Y. Pollard H.B. Bruggemann E.P. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3975-3980Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and site-directed mutations within the transmembrane segments are able to modulate drug specificity (5Dhir R. Grizzuti K. Kajiji S. Gros P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9492-9499Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 6Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol.

Two P-glycoprotein isoforms are expressed in normal tissues: overexpression of Class I and II P-glycoproteins (e.g. human MDR1, mouse mdr1/3, hamster pgp1/2) leads to multidrug resistance, whereas overexpression of Class III proteins (human MDR3, mouse mdr2, hamster pgp3) does not. Recent studies of mdr2 “knockout” mice suggest that the mdr2 gene product plays an essential role in the liver in the export of phospholipid from the apical surface of the canalicular membrane into the bile (8Smit J.J.M. Schinkel A.H. Oude Elferink R.P.J. Groen A.K. Wagenaar E. van Deemter L. Mol C.A.A.M. Ottenhof R. van der Lugt N.M.T. van Roon M.A. van der Walk M.A. Offerhaus G.J.A. Berns A.J.M. Borst P. Cell. 1993; 75: 451-462Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1336) Google Scholar). This proposal was confirmed by Ruetz and Gros (9Ruetz S. Gros P. Cell. 1994; 77: 1071-1081Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar), who demonstrated that the mdr2 protein acts as a phosphatidylcholine translocase (or flippase). The physiological substrates for Class I and II P-glycoproteins have not yet been identified. However, the sequence similarity of P-glycoprotein with other ABC transporters known to export peptides, both in prokaryotes (e.g. the Escherichia coli hemolysin exporter HlyB (10Holland I.B. Kenny B. Blight M. Biochimie (Paris). 1990; 72: 131-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar); the oligopeptide permease of Salmonella typhimurium (11Higgins C.F. Hyde S.C. Mimmack M.M. Gileadi U. Gill D.R. Gallagher M.P. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1990; 22: 571-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar)) and eukaryotes (e.g. the yeast ste6 a-factor exporter (12McGrath J.P. Varshavsky A. Nature. 1989; 340: 400-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar); the Tap-1/2 peptide transporters in the endoplasmic reticulum (13Powis S.J. Deverson E.V. Coadwell W.J. Ciruella A. Huskisson N.S. Smith H. Butcher G.W. Howard J.C. Nature. 1992; 357: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar)), suggests that peptides may also serve as P-glycoprotein substrates in vivo. Recently, there have been reports which indicate that P-glycoprotein may transport peptides, although the evidence for this has, to date, been indirect. Sharma et al. showed that mdr1-expressing cells were resistant to the hydrophobic tripeptide ALLN1 1The abbreviations used are: ALLNN-acetyl-leucyl-leucyl-norleucinalALLMN-acetyl-leucyl-leucyl-methioninalLUVlarge unilamellar vesiclesMDRmultidrug-resistant. (14Sharma R.C. Inoue S. Roitelman J. Schimke R.T. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5731-5734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the ability of mdr1 to complement ste6 mutations (15Raymond M. Gros P. Whiteway M. Thomas D.Y. Science. 1992; 256: 232-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) implies that P-glycoprotein can export the a-factor mating peptide from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, although its efficiency remains uncertain. More recently, we have demonstrated that the channel-forming linear hydrophobic peptide gramicidin D is a substrate for the multidrug transporter, which interferes with the ability of the peptide to form a functional dimeric cation channel in the membrane (16Loe D.W. Sharom F.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1190: 72-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In addition, prenylcysteine methyl esters and various hydrophobic peptides have been reported to stimulate the ATPase activity of P-glycoprotein in human mdr1-transfected Sf9 cell membranes (17Sarkadi B. Müller M. Homolya L. Holló Z. Seprdi J. Germann U.A. Gottesman M.M. Price E.M. Boucher R.C.

Chemosensitizers, compounds which reverse drug resistance, show promise when combined with chemotherapeutic agents in cancer treatment. The identification of new clinically effective chemosensitizers is an important goal in developing strategies to overcome MDR. The cyclic peptide cyclosporine A, a well-known chemosensitizer, was recently reported to be vectorially exported by monolayers of MDR cells (19Saeki T. Ueda K. Tanigawara Y. Hori R. Komano T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6077-6080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and brain endothelial cells (20Shirai A. Naito M. Tatsuta T. Dong J. Hanaoka K. Mikami K. Oh-hara T. Tsuruo T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1222: 400-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), indicating that it is also a substrate for transport by P-glycoprotein. Peptides thus represent an important, and hitherto largely unexamined, class of P-glycoprotein substrates and chemosensitizers, which may offer the hope of substantially lower toxicity. In the present study, we show that many hydrophobic peptides and ionophores both block drug transport by P-glycoprotein, and stimulate its ATPase activity, in an in vitro membrane vesicle system. In addition, we correlate these data with cross-resistance of MDR cells to peptides, and investigate their ability to inhibit azidopine photoaffinity labeling of P-glycoprotein. The results establish that certain hydrophobic peptides and ionophores are P-glycoprotein substrates, and also indicate that these classes of compounds interact with the transporter at different sites from those associated with other drugs and chemosensitizers. Export of hydrophobic peptides may thus be an important endogenous function for P-glycoprotein, which suggests that further exploration of this class of compounds as potential chemosensitizers is warranted. The drug-sensitive parent Chinese hamster ovary cell line (AuxB1) and an MDR cell line selected for colchicine resistance (CHRC5) (21Kartner N. Evernden-Porelle D. Bradley G. Ling V. Nature. 1985; 316: 820-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar), were grown as described previously (22Doige C.A. Sharom F.J. Protein Exp. Purif. 1991; 2: 256-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 23Doige C.A. Sharom F.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1109: 161-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 24Doige C.A. Yu X. Sharom F.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1109: 149-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Plasma membrane vesicles from AuxB1 and CHRC5 were isolated by a method involving cell disruption by nitrogen cavitation followed by centrifugation on a 35% (w/w) sucrose cushion (22Doige C.A. Sharom F.J. Protein Exp. Purif. 1991; 2: 256-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Plasma membrane vesicles were stored at −70°C for no longer than 3 months before use. Cross-resistance of CHRC5 cells to peptides and ionophores, and chemosensitization by verapamil, were determined by growth inhibition using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide dye reduction assay, as described previously (16Loe D.W. Sharom F.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1190: 72-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 25Loe D.W. Sharom F.J. Br. J. Cancer. 1993; 68: 342-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The fold resistance was calculated as the ratio of the IC50values for CHRC5 relative to the AuxB1 parent. The chemosensitization index was calculated as the ratio of the IC50for CHRC5 in the presence of 20 μM verapamil, to that in its absence (16Loe D.W. Sharom F.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1190: 72-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 25Loe D.W. Sharom F.J. Br. J. Cancer. 1993; 68: 342-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). A value of the chemosensitization index of 1 indicates that resistance was not reversed by verapamil, whereas a value >1 indicates that resistance was reversed. The protein content of CHRC5 plasma membrane was determined by a microplate adaptation of the Bradford assay (26Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217548) Google Scholar), using bovine serum albumin as a standard. The ATPase activity of P-glycoprotein in CHRC5 plasma membrane vesicles was determined as described previously (3Sharom F.J. Yu X. Doige C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24197-24202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Doige C.A. Yu X. Sharom F.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1109: 149-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 27Doige C.A. Yu X. Sharom F.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1146: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), by measuring the release of inorganic phosphate from ATP, using a colorimetric method. Samples contained 1-2 μg of CHRC5 plasma membrane with 2 mM ATP and 5 mM Mg2+, which gave maximal ATPase activity. The assay buffer did not contain either Na+or K+, to avoid contributions to activity from the Na+K+-ATPase; addition of 1 mM ouabain to the assay did not affect the measured ATPase activity. Membrane vesicles were preincubated with peptides and ionophores for 5 min before initiation of the assay by addition of ATP. Peptides, ionophores, and drugs were added as stock solutions in Me2SO, and controls contained the appropriate levels of Me2SO (which never exceeded 1%, v/v). Steady-state [3H]colchicine uptake into CHRC5 plasma membrane vesicles was determined using a protocol previously developed in our laboratory (23Doige C.A. Sharom F.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1109: 161-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Briefly, membrane vesicles (25-35 μg of protein in a 100-μl final volume of buffer) were mixed with 1 μM [3H]colchicine (0.3 μCi/sample), 5 mM Mg2+, and 1 mM ATP plus a regenerating system (creatine phosphate/creatine kinase). After various times at 23°C, the vesicles were harvested by rapid filtration on Whatman GF/F filters using a Hoeffer filtration manifold, and immediately washed with 5 ml of ice-cold buffer. Filters were dried and radioactivity was quantitated by liquid scintillation counting. Peptides, ionophores, and drugs were added as stock solutions in Me2SO, and controls contained the appropriate levels of Me2SO (which never exceeded 1%, v/v). Drug binding to filters, and nonspecific uptake into the vesicles, were determined in the absence of membrane vesicles, and in the absence of ATP and a regenerating system, respectively. The median effect equation (28Chou T.-C. Talalay P. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1983; 4: 450-454Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (530) Google Scholar, 29Chou T.-C. Talalay P. Weber G. Advances in Enzyme Regulation. Vol. 22. Pergamon Press, New York1984: 15-48Google Scholar) describes the relationship between any concentration of a compound, and its effect on the system being studied. In this case, the inhibition of [3H]colchicine transport into CHRC5 plasma membrane vesicles was measured at various concentrations of the test compound(s). The basic median effect equation is as follows, fafu=DDmm(Eq. 1) where fa = fraction of the system that is affected at a concentration D (in this case, the fractional inhibition of equilibrium colchicine uptake); fu = fraction of the system that is unaffected at concentration D; Dm = the compound concentration causing 50% inhibition; and m = parameter indicating the sigmoidicity of the dose-effect curve. Note that both fα and fu can vary between 0 and 1, and fa = (1 − fu). One transformation of the median effect equation is as follows, Logfafu=mlogD-mlogDm A plot of log (fa/fu) versus log D produces a straight line with slope m, and an x intercept equalling log Dm. The effect of peptides and ionophores on the integrity of lipid bilayers was determined by a modification of the method of Ertel et al. (30Ertel A. Marangoni A.G. Marsh J. Hallett F.R. Wood J.M. Biophys. J. 1993; 64: 426-434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2.5 mg of egg phosphatidylcholine (Sigma) in ethanol was dried under a stream of N2and then pumped in vacuo for 30 min. The lipid was then suspended in 1 ml of 70 mM calcein (Sigma), 50 mM NaCl. After freeze-thawing 10 times in liquid N2, large unilamellar vesicles (LUV) were prepared by high pressure extrusion through 100-nm polycarbonate filters, as described (31Hope M.J. Bally M.B. Webb G. Cullis P.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 812: 55-65Crossref Scopus (2020) Google Scholar). Untrapped dye was removed by gel filtration chromatography on Sephadex G-50. The void volume fractions containing LUV were pooled, and the lipid content determined using a microscale Bartlett assay (32Bartlett G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 466-468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Aliquots (0.5-1.0 μg of lipid) were dispensed into individual wells of a 96-well microplate, in a total volume of 100 μl of Hepes-buffered saline (10 mM Hepes, 0.15 M NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, pH 7.0), and increasing concentrations of the test compounds in Hepes-buffered saline were added. The release of calcein from the LUV was quantitated after 30 min at 23°C, using fluorescence measurements on a cytofluorimeter (Millipore Cytofluor 2300; λex= 485 nm, λem= 535 nm). [3H]Azidopine Photoaffinity Labeling-Photoaffinity labeling of P-glycoprotein in CHRC5 membrane vesicles with [3H]azidopine (200 nM, 52 Ci/mmol; Amersham) was carried out as described previously (16Loe D.W.

A. 1988; 85: 7187-7191Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), in the presence of various concentrations of peptides and ionophores. Membrane vesicles were then analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel, followed by fluorography. The MDR Chinese hamster ovary cell lines CHRC5 and CHRB30 were previously selected for resistance to colchicine, and overexpress predominantly the Class I isoform of P-glycoprotein (35Urbatsch I.L. Al-Shawi M.K. Senior A.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7069-7076Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). We previously reported that CHRC5 cells and mdr1-transfectants were highly cross-resistant to the linear channel-forming peptide gramicidin D (16Loe D.W. Sharom F.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1190: 72-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). We have now investigated cross-resistance of MDR cell lines to a selected set of linear and cyclic hydrophobic peptides and ionophores, and chemosensitization of this resistance by verapamil (Table I). CHRC5 displayed high levels of resistance to the protease inhibitor ALLN, and moderate levels were noted for the related peptide ALLM and the cyclic peptide ionophore valinomycin. A low, but significant level of resistance was observed for nonactin, a cyclic non-peptide ionophore. The CHRB30 cell line, which was derived from CHRC5, has substantially higher levels of drug resistance and P-glycoprotein expression, and displayed 5-fold resistance to nonactin, indicating that cross-resistance to this compound is genuine. No cross-resistance was observed to the membrane-active linear peptides melittin and alamethicin, or to the cyclic membrane-active peptide gramicidin S, and the cyclic peptide chemosensitizer cyclosporine A. Verapamil was able to reverse resistance to ALLM, ALLN, gramicidin D, valinomycin, and nonactin, which suggests that they are all P-glycoprotein substrates, but had no effect on resistance to melittin, alamethicin, gramicidin S, and cyclosporine A ().Table I:Effect of peptides and ionophores on various aspects of P-glycoprotein function Open table in a new tab CHRC5 plasma membrane vesicles displayed a high intrinsic Mg2+-ATPase activity (0.273 μmol/min/mg) compared to plasma membrane from the drug-sensitive parent line AuxB1 (0.056 μmol/min/mg, see Ref. 24). In previous studies, we confirmed that this additional ATPase activity in the drug-resistant cell line arises from the presence of P-glycoprotein (24Doige C.A. Yu X. Sharom F.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1109: 149-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The ATPase activity of CHRC5 membrane was inhibited by vanadate (IC50of 1.5 μM; 80% inhibition at 10 μM), which was previously observed to inhibit both P-glycoprotein-mediated drug transport (23Doige C.A. Sharom F.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1109: 161-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and the ATPase activity of a partially purified P-glycoprotein preparation (24Doige C.A. Yu X. Sharom F.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1109: 149-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The ATPase activity of CHRC5 plasma membrane was stimulated over 2.2-fold by the chemosensitizer verapamil. Trifluoperazine also produced a large activation, while the drug substrates vinblastine and colchicine increased activity by 40%. Maximal stimulation of P-glycoprotein ATPase was reached at 10 μM for verapamil, trifluoperazine, and vinblastine, and ∼100 μM for colchicine. The ATPase activity of plasma membrane from the drug-sensitive AuxB1 parent cell line was not stimulated significantly by any of the compounds tested. Thus, P-glycoprotein ATPase in a native membrane environment is activated by certain chemosensitizers and drugs. Similar results have been reported for plasma membrane vesicles from other P-glycoprotein-expressing cells. CHRC5 membrane vesicles therefore provide a simple and convenient system for screening various compounds for their effect on P-glycoprotein ATPase activity. We previously demonstrated that the ATPase activity of P-glycoprotein in detergent solution is also modulated by drugs (24Doige C.A. Yu X. Sharom F.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1109: 149-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 36Sharom F.J. Yu X. Chu J.W.K. Doige C.A. Biochem. J. 1995; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar), although to a lesser extent. Linear and cyclic peptides and ionophores were examined for their ability to stimulate P-glycoprotein ATPase in CHRC5 plasma membrane. The linear peptides ALLN, ALLM, pepstatin A, and leupeptin (Fig. 1 A), and the cyclic ionophores valinomycin and nonactin (Fig. 1 B) produced maximal enhancement of ATPase activity of around 2-2.5-fold. These six compounds all exhibited a pattern of activation which did not decrease at high concentrations, unlike the biphasic pattern noted previously by our group (3Sharom F.J. Yu X. Doige C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24197-24202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Doige C.A. Yu X. Sharom F.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1109: 149-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 36Sharom F.J. Yu X. Chu J.W.K. Doige C.A. Biochem. J. 1995; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar) and others (37Sarkadi B. Price E.M. Boucher R.C. Germann U.A. Scarborough G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4854-4858Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Ambudkar S.V. Lelong I.H. Zhang J. Cardarelli C.O. Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8472-8476Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar) for chemosensitizers and drugs. The membrane-active linear peptides melittin, alamethicin, and gramicidin D did not stimulate the ATPase (Fig. 1 A); instead they caused varying degrees of inhibition as the concentration increased. Activity was also stimulated (up to 1.4-fold) by cyclosporine A, which displayed a biphasic pattern, whereas gramicidin S did not activate the ATPase (Fig. 1 B). The concentrations of each peptide or ionophore that induced half-maximal stimulation of P-glycoprotein ATPase activity (SC50values) were interpolated from the curves in Fig. 1, A and B, and are listed in, together with the maximal fold-stimulation observed for each. The SC50values are useful indicators of the relative “affinity” of each compound for interaction with P-glycoprotein. Cyclosporine A showed the lowest SC50value of all the compounds tested (around 10 nM), whereas the SC50value for valinomycin was less than 1 μM, comparable to that for vinblastine. Nonactin and pepstatin A gave half-maximal ATPase stimulation in the low micromolar range, while ALLN, ALLM, and leupeptin had SC50values between 40 and 100 μM. In general, only compounds to which CHRC5 cells were cross-resistant stimulated ATPase activity; peptides such as melittin, alamethicin, and gramicidin S, to which MDR cells did not display cross-resistance, did not induce ATPase stimulation. As demonstrated above, verapamil stimulates the ATPase activity of CHRC5 plasma membrane by over 2.2-fold. It was of interest to determine whether peptides and ionophores block verapamil-induced ATPase activation, since this would give some indication of whether these classes of compounds compete with verapamil for a common binding site on P-glycoprotein. As shown in Fig. 2, cyclosporine A and vinblastine completely abrogated verapamil stimulation of P-glycoprotein ATPase activity at low concentrations (5 and 50 μM, respectively), as did other drugs and chemosensitizers, including daunomycin, trifluoperazine, quinine, and quinidine (not shown). In contrast, linear peptides such as ALLM and pepstatin A were unable to do so, even at a concentration of 200 μM. Valinomycin inhibited verapamil stimulation slightly at 100 μM. ALLN, leupeptin, and nonactin were also unable to block verapamil stimulation of ATPase activity (not shown). These data support the hypothesis that linear peptides interact with P-glycoprotein at a binding site distinct from that for verapamil. On the other hand, cyclosporine A and other drugs and chemosensitizers reside in a site which either overlaps with the verapamil-binding site, or is allosterically linked to it, so that occupancy affects the ability of verapamil to bind to the transporter, or signal the ATPase catalytic site once bound. Peptides and ionophores were examined for their ability to block active, ATP-dependent colchicine transport into CHRC5 plasma membrane vesicles, using methodology previously established in our laboratory (3Sharom F.J. Yu X. Doige C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24197-24202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Doige C.A. Sharom F.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1109: 161-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, a large number of peptides and ionophores inhibited accumulation of drug in the vesicle lumen, in a concentration-dependent manner. Cyclosporine A and vinblastine (Fig. 3 B) were highly effective competitors of colchicine transport, with >90% inhibition observed at 1 and 3 μM, respectively. Valinomycin (Fig. 3 B) also blocked transport very effectively in the low micromolar concentration range. Linear peptides (Fig. 3 A) inhibited colchicine transport in the order of effectiveness pepstatin A > leupeptin > ALLM, and the cyclic ionophore nonactin was the least potent inhibitor. Gramicidin D could not be tested above 50 μM due to poor solubility, but it blocked drug accumulation by >35% at this concentration. The transport inhibition data presented in Fig. 3 cannot be analyzed by enzyme kinetic models, since it represents steady-state drug accumulation, rather than initial rates of transport. As an alternative means for evaluation of the transport inhibition data, we employed the median effect analysis, which was developed by Chou (for reviews, see Refs. 28 and 29). This method is derived from the law of mass action, and requires no assumptions about mechanism (indeed, it is mechanism-independent), or estimates of binding or kinetic constants. It permits the experimenter to quantitate the relationship between the concentration of any compound, D, and its effect on the system being studied (see “Materials and Methods”). In this case, the fractional inhibition of colchicine accumulation in CHRC5 plasma membrane vesicles (data shown in Fig. 3) was used as the parameter fa, and median effect plots of log (fa/ fu) versus log D were constructed for each of the test compounds. The drug accumulation inhibition data gave a series of straight line median effect plots (shown in Fig. 4), covering a wide range of concentrations. The plot for cyclosporine A (the most effective transport inhibitor) appears at the far left of the series, and the plot for nonactin (the least effective transport inhibitor) is shown at the far right. The parameter Dmwas determined for each plot from the zero intercept on the x axis, and represents the concentration of test compound required to inhibit drug accumulation by 50% (see). The Dmvalues thus provide a means of quantitating the eff"

The presence of a prosthetic group capable of univalent redox reactions may help to explain the activation of the regulon in vivo by compounds that can mediate such reactions. INTRODUCTIONThe transcriptional regulators, SoxR and SoxS, govern a regulon of Escherichia coli that responds to superoxide generators such as paraquat (methyl viologen) (1Tsaneva I.R. Weiss B. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 4197-4205Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 2Greenberg J.T. Monach P. Chou J.H. Josephy P.D. Demple B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6181-6185Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). The soxRS regulon and the oxyR regulon (which protects against H2O2) are the two best studied bacterial regulatory systems for adaptive defenses against oxidants (3Demple B. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1991; 25: 315-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). The soxRS regulon includes the following genes of known function: sodA, encoding Mn2+-superoxide dismutase; nfo, encoding endonuclease IV, a DNA repair enzyme; zwf, encoding glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, which regenerates the reducing equivalents (in the form of NADPH) that are consumed during redox cycling of the inducers; micF, whose mRNA inhibits the porin gene, ompF; fpr, encoding ferredoxin (flavodoxin):NADPH oxidoreductase, which assists in the reduction of Fe-S proteins (4Liochev S.I. Hausladen A. Beyer W.F. Fridovich I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1328-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar); and fumC, encoding an oxidatively stable fumarase (5Liochev S.I. Fridovich I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5892-5896Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar).The induction of the soxRS regulon occurs in two steps (6Wu J. Weiss B. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 3915-3920Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Nunoshiba T. Hidalgo E. Amábile-Cuevas C.F. Demple B. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 6054-6060Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). SoxR responds to an oxidative signal and activates the transcription of soxS. The overproduced SoxS then activates the transcription of the target genes of the regulon. This cascade increases sensitivity through signal amplification. Although SoxS is a member of the AraC family of transcriptional activators, it lacks a region corresponding to the sensor domains of its relatives (8Wu J. Weiss B. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 2864-2871Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Amábile-Cuevas C.F. Demple B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4479-4484Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The following findings suggested that SoxR provides this sensor function. The action of SoxR precedes that of SoxS, some soxR mutants have a regulon-constitutive phenotype, and SoxR has a cluster of four cysteines that may be part of a redox-sensing center (6Wu J. Weiss B. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 3915-3920Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Nunoshiba T. Hidalgo E. Amábile-Cuevas C.F. Demple B. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 6054-6060Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 8Wu J. Weiss B. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 2864-2871Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Amábile-Cuevas C.F. Demple B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4479-4484Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar).In preliminary experiments (10Weiss B. Wu J. Asada K. Yoshikawa T Frontiers of Reactive Oxygen Species in Biology and Medicine. Excerpta Medica, New York1994: 241-244Google Scholar), we obtained active SoxR with an average of 1.0 iron atom per chain and the optical spectrum of an iron-sulfur protein. A recent report (11Hidalgo E. Demple B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 138-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) described the purification of SoxR that had 1.6 iron atoms per polypeptide and a similar spectrum. The low iron content was consistent with the well known instability of many Fe-S clusters. The number of iron atoms per Fe-S center and the number of clusters per polypeptide were not determined. In this study, we report the large scale production and purification of SoxR that contains a full complement of Fe-S clusters, a prerequisite for crystallographic and other physical studies. We determine some of its molecular parameters, and we show that the active protein is a globular homodimer containing one [2Fe-2S] center per polypeptide chain. Thus, SoxR is related to a class of well characterized electron transport proteins, the [2Fe-2S] ferredoxins. This identification of the redox center provides an important insight into the mechanism of activation of the soxRS regulon by oxidative stress.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESStrains and PlasmidsE. coli strain BL21(λDE3) and plasmid pET-11 (12Studier F.W.

Plasmid pHE6:: soxR, a derivative of pHE6 (13Milman G. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 153: 482-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), will be separately described.Molecular Biological MethodsGeneral methods for cloning and for electrophoretic analysis of polynucleotides and proteins were as described (14Sambrook J.

Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1989Google Scholar). DNA concentrations were estimated by staining with ethidium bromide (14Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) or by fluorimetry with Hoechst 33258 dye (16Cesarone C.F. Bolognesi C. Santi L. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 100: 188-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar).Overproduction of SoxRHigh density bacterial growth was performed as described (17Rogers S.G. Weiss B. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), with the following modifications. A 60-ml saturated culture of E. coli BL21(pET11K-soxR, λDE3) was inoculated into 3 liters of medium containing kanamycin (50 μg/ml) and incubated at 37°C under oxygen. At an OD525of 21 (11 h), the culture was rapidly cooled to 15°C, and 2 ml of a 20% IPTG1 1The abbreviations used are: IPTGisopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranosideMOPS3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acidPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. solution were added, followed 6 h later by 600 mg of rifampicin. The cells were harvested 23 h after induction (OD525= 32, pH 6.6). The cell paste (130 g) was washed and resuspended in an equal volume of 10% sucrose, 10 mM Tris− HCl buffer (pH 8.0), dripped into liquid N2, and stored at −80°C.Overproduction was also achieved in 500-ml flasks on a water bath shaker in room atmosphere. One ml of a saturated culture was added to 100 ml of medium in each flask. The temperature shift was performed at a cell density of 5 × 108ml−1. Rifampicin was omitted. The yield was 1.7 g of cell paste per flask.Purification of SoxRAll operations were performed at 0 to 4°C in a standard buffer containing 20 mM MOPS/KOH (pH 7.6), 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol. Precipitates were collected by centrifugation at 27,000 × g for 10 min after 20 min of stirring. Twenty grams of the frozen cell suspension were sonicated in 40 ml of the standard buffer containing 0.2 M KCl and 0.0025% phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 33,000 × g for 15 min. NaCl (5 M) and polyethyleneimine-HCl (5%, pH 7.0) were added to final concentrations of 0.1 M and 0.225%, respectively, and the precipitate was removed by centrifugation. An equal volume of a saturated solution of (NH4)2SO4was slowly added. The precipitate was dissolved in 40 ml of standard buffer, precipitated again with 60 ml of a saturated (NH4)2SO4solution, and redissolved in 200 ml of standard buffer containing 0.2 M KCl (loading buffer).Whatman P-11 phosphocellulose was equilibrated with the loading buffer and packed into a column (7.6 cm × 1 cm) to which the protein solution was applied followed by 12 ml of the loading buffer. Elution was performed with 60 ml of the loading buffer containing a linear gradient of from 0.2 to 1.0 M KCl. SoxR was eluted in a single peak at 0.5 to 0.6 M KCl. It was detected by its reddish brown color and electrophoretic mobility.DNA SubstratesThe soxS promoter segment used for electrophoretic mobility shift assays was an EcoRI- BstYI fragment of an M13mp19:: soxRS plasmid that had a terminal deletion of most of the soxR gene (8Wu J. Weiss B. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 2864-2871Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); it contained nucleotides 459-586 of the published sequence (8Wu J. Weiss B. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 2864-2871Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The control (soxR) DNA was an EcoRI- SmaI fragment of a similar plasmid that had an intact soxR gene; it contained nucleotides 977-1099. The soxS promoter DNA used for transcription assays extended from nucleotides 421-594. It was generated by a polymerase chain reaction (15Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1989Google Scholar) that employed a fragment of plasmid pUC18:: soxS (6Wu J. Weiss B. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 3915-3920Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as a template and the following oligonucleotides as primers: TAAGCGGCTGGTCAATATGC and GCGGGGTAATTTCTTTTCCA.Electrophoretic Band Shift AssaysMobility shift DNA binding assays using low ionic strength PAGE were performed as described elsewhere (15Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1989Google Scholar). Prior to electrophoresis, the 32P-labeled DNA fragments (7500 cpm each) were incubated with from 0 to 200 ng of SoxR protein for 20 min at 30°C in 15 μl of a solution containing 133 μg/ml poly(dI-dC), 300 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 12% glycerol, 10 mM KCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 12 mM HEPES/NaOH buffer (pH 7.9).Transcription AssaysSoxR was diluted in a solution containing 20 mM Tris·HCl buffer (pH 8.0), 100 mM KCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. SoxR (5-50 ng in 3 μl of diluent) was added to 18 μl of a solution containing 15 nmol of DNA template and 0.16 mM each of ATP, GTP, and CTP, 40 mM Tris·HCl buffer (pH 8.0), 10 mM MgCl2, 50 mM KCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. After the mixture was incubated for 10 min at 37°C, 0.15 unit of E. coli RNA polymerase-σ70holoenzyme (Epicentre Technologies) was added in 3 μl. After an additional 10 min at 37°C, 3 μl of heparin sulfate (1 mg/ml) and 3 μl of 80 μMα-[32P]UTP (3-30 Bq/mmol) were added simultaneously. The mixtures were incubated at 37°C for 15 min and treated with phenol. The RNA products were precipitated with ethanol and analyzed by electrophoresis in an 8% polyacrylamide, 7.7 M urea gel (15Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1989Google Scholar). Radioactivity was measured with the Ambis Corp. (San Diego, CA) radioanalytic imaging system. One standard unit of activity is defined as the incorporation of 1 fmol of UTP under these conditions. The activity was proportional (±5%) to the concentration of SoxR in the stated range.Protein AnalysesProtein concentrations were measured with the Pierce Coomassie Blue dye reagent, using bovine serum albumin as a standard (18Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213177) Google Scholar). Values for SoxR were multiplied by 0.323 to agree with those obtained with a Beckman 7300 Amino Acid Analyzer at the W. M. Keck Foundation, Yale University. N-terminal sequences were determined by Edman degradation, using an Applied Biosystems model 470 sequencer at the University of Michigan Protein and Carbohydrate Structure Facility.Gel Permeation ChromatographyA column (1-cm diameter, 35-ml volume) of Bio-Gel P-60 (Bio-Rad) was equilibrated and operated at 4°C with a solution containing 0.25 M KCl, 10 mM dithiothreitol, 20 mM MOPS/NaOH buffer (pH 7.6), and 10% glycerol. SoxR (45 μg) or other proteins (1 mg each) were applied in a volume of 0.1 ml. The void volume was determined with bovine catalase (240 kDa). Of the material applied, 37% of the SoxR protein and 24% of its original activity were recovered in the combined peak fractions. The markers used were ovalbumin, pancreatic DNase, bovine chymotrypsinogen, and horse heart cytochrome c.Sedimentation AnalysisBand sedimentation was performed in 4.5-ml solutions containing 0.25 M KCl, 10 mM dithiothreitol, 20 mM MOPS/NaOH buffer (pH 7.6), and a linear gradient of from 10 to 30% glycerol. The protein samples were 0.3 to 0.5 mg. Ovalbumin and chymotrypsinogen were the standards. Centrifugation was in a Beckman SW50.1 rotor at 48,000 rpm for 26 h at 4°C.Physical ParametersMethods of calculation for the Stokes radius, sedimentation coefficient, frictional ratio, and Mrof native SoxR were as in Weiss (19Weiss B. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 1896-1901Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A value of 0.736 was assumed for the partial specific volume of SoxR (20Smith M.H. Sober H.A. CRC Handbook of Biochemistry, Selected Data for Molecular Biology. The Chemical Rubber Co., Cleveland, OH1968: C3-C35Google Scholar).Metal AnalysesPrecautions were taken to reduce contaminating metal ions (21Holmquist B. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 158: 6-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Metal analyses were performed by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry in the Department of Geological Sciences at the University of Michigan. An ultrafiltrate served as a blank sample; it contained <10% as much iron as the SoxR solution.Reductive TitrationsTitrations of SoxR with sodium dithionite (22Burleigh Jr., B.D. Foust G.P. Williams Jr., C.H. Anal. Biochem. 1969; 27: 536-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 23Mayhew S.G. Petering D. Palmer G. Foust G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 2830-2834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were performed at 4°C under argon. Residual oxygen was removed with protocatechuic acid and protocatechuate dioxygenase (a generous gift of D. Ballou) (24Bull C. Ballou D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 12673-12680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which were added to 100 μM and 1 μM, respectively. The dithionite solution was standardized with FAD.EPR SpectraMethods used for EPR spectroscopy (25Hunt J. Massey V. Dunham W.R. Sands R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18685-18691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and computer programs for data reduction (26Hagen W.R. Hearshen D.O. Sands R.H. Dunham W.R. J. Magn. Reson. 1985; 61: 220-232Google Scholar, 27Hagen W.R. Hearshen D.O. Harding L.J. Dunham W.R. J. Magn. Reson. 1985; 61: 233-244Google Scholar) were as described previously.RESULTSCloning of soxR in an Expression VectorA promoterless DNA fragment containing the ribosome binding site and complete coding sequence of soxR was inserted into plasmid pET-11, thereby placing the soxR gene downstream from a phage T7 promoter under lac operator control (Fig. 1). The plasmid was unstable in high density cultures in which ampicillin, which is readily destroyed by β-lactamase, was used as the selective agent (12Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (5986) Google Scholar). Therefore, a kanamycin resistance gene was inserted. The resulting strain was >99% stable as determined by its ability to be killed by IPTG (12Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (5986) Google Scholar).Activity in Vivo of the Cloned soxR GeneTo ensure that our cloned soxR gene had not mutated, we tested for its ability to restore to a soxR9::cat mutant (6Wu J. Weiss B. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 3915-3920Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) the capacity of its zwf (glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase) gene to be induced by paraquat, a function that is mediated by the soxRS regulon (1Tsaneva I.R. Weiss B. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 4197-4205Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 2Greenberg J.T. Monach P. Chou J.H. Josephy P.D. Demple B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6181-6185Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). The plasmid enabled a 10-fold induction of the enzyme, comparable to that seen in wild type cells.Overproduction of SoxRThe use of a vector with an IPTG-inducible rather than a thermoinducible promoter, enabled the overexpression of SoxR at low temperature, which favors the synthesis of correctly folded, soluble, overexpressed proteins (29Steczko J. Donoho G.A. Dixon J.E. Sugimoto T. Axelrod B. Protein Expression Purif. 1991; 2: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). At 30 or 37°C, >50% of the SoxR produced from plasmid pET11K- soxR was insoluble; however, at 15°C, almost all of the SoxR protein produced could be recovered in a soluble fraction (Fig. 2).Figure 2:Overproduction (A) and purification (B) of SoxR as monitored by SDS-PAGE. A, a fermentor culture of strain BL21 (pET11K- soxR, λDE3) was sampled at 0, 18, and 23 h after treatment with IPTG at 15°C. Samples of equal cell mass were applied to the gel after lysis and denaturation. B, lane I, sonicate supernatant; II, polyethyleneimine supernatant; III, ammonium sulfate precipitate; IV, phosphocellulose eluate. Lanes I to III each contained proteins derived from 1 μl of sonicate. Lane IV contained 10 μg of SoxR. Markers were chymotrypsinogen (25 kDa) and lysozyme (14 kDa).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)PurificationOnly one chromatography step was needed to purify SoxR (Fig. 2 B). Its high pI enabled it bind to phosphocellulose at a high salt concentration required for its stability. The yield was 1.5 mg of purified SoxR per g of wet cells. Its specific activity was 10 units/ng of protein (transcriptional activation assay).The first five N-terminal amino acids of the purified protein matched those predicted by the DNA sequence of soxR (8Wu J. Weiss B. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 2864-2871Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that there was no amino-terminal processing. A secondary band detected by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2 B, IV), had the mobility and N-terminal sequence expected of undissociated SoxR dimer.General PropertiesPurified SoxR containing 1 mM dithiothreitol was stable only for about 1 week at 4°C. Preparations containing 10 mM dithiothreitol were stable for about 1 month at 4°C under argon or for at least 2 months at −20°C in 50% glycerol. At salt concentrations <0.2 M or at temperatures >10°C, the reddish brown solution formed an insoluble white precipitate within a few minutes. Fast-frozen samples that were stored at −80°C lost ≤15% of their activity on thawing. Although SoxR was reported to have a solubility ≤200 μg/ml (11Hidalgo E. Demple B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 138-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), under our conditions it was soluble at >10 mg/ml.DNA Binding ActivityPurified SoxR bound specifically to a fragment of soxS DNA extending 62 base pairs upstream of the transcriptional start site. The electrophoretic mobility of the DNA was retarded 11%, even in the absence of RNA polymerase. Under the conditions given (see “Experimental Procedures”), the binding constant of SoxR dimer to soxS DNA (determined as the concentration of SoxR required for retardation of 50% of the DNA) was between 0.4 and 2.0 × 10-8M. The results (not shown) were similar to those obtained by others (11Hidalgo E. Demple B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 138-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) and confirmed the activity of our preparation.Transcriptional EnhancementPurified SoxR was tested for its ability to activate the transcription of the soxS gene. The 173-bp linear soxS DNA template started 67 nucleotides upstream of the transcriptional start site. The one-cycle transcription assay employed heparin to block reinitiation during the elongation phase, thereby increasing the relative yield of full length transcripts. The results (Fig. 3) indicated that transcription from the SoxS promoter was dependent on the addition of SoxR. If SoxR were added after heparin, there was no transcriptional enhancement (results not shown). Therefore, SoxR functions in transcription initiation.Figure 3:Activation of soxS transcription by purified SoxR. A one-cycle transcription assay was performed with a soxS DNA template and increasing amounts of SoxR protein (see “Experimental Procedures”).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)In vivo, SoxR requires activation by treatment of cells with oxidants. However, purified SoxR was active in vitro without further treatment (Fig. 3) (11Hidalgo E. Demple B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 138-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). We were unable to increase the activity of our preparation by incubating it with potassium superoxide or with superoxide generating systems (phenazine methosulfate plus NADPH and O2, or 6-hydroxydopamine plus O2), even in the presence of catalase to remove any H2O2that might inactivate the protein (results not shown).SoxR Is a HomodimerTranscriptional activity and protein comigrated in a single peak during gel permeation chromatography. Although the molecular mass of the polypeptide is 17 kDa (8Wu J. Weiss B. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 2864-2871Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the native protein had an elution volume between that of pancreatic DNase I (31 kDa) and ovalbumin (43 kDa), and its sedimentation rate was between that of ovalbumin and chymotrypsinogen (25 kDa). The physical parameters of the native protein are as follows: Stokes radius, 2.81 nm; diffusion coefficient (D), 7.65 × 10-7cm2s−1; sedimentation coefficient (s20,w), 2.71 S; frictional ratio (f/f0), 1.26; Mr(calculated from D and s20,w), 32,700. Thus, SoxR is a globular homodimer in its active form.Metal ContentOur SoxR preparation contained 2.0 atoms of iron per polypeptide chain. Values for other metals were as follows: zinc, a ubiquitous contaminant (21Holmquist B. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 158: 6-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), 0.39; copper, ≤0.34; and cobalt, molybdenum, and magnesium, ≤0.10.Optical SpectrumAt peak wavelengths, the extinction coefficients (mM−1cm−1) for the SoxR polypeptide were as follows: ε276= 53.5, ε320= 24.5, ε418= 12.7, ε462= 12.4, and ε540(shoulder) = 8.0. The spectrum was characteristic of a [2Fe-2S] protein (30Orme-Johnson W.H. Orme-Johnson N.R. Spiro T.G. Iron-Sulfur Proteins. John Wiley & Sons, New York1982: 67-96Google Scholar). The ratio of the absorbance of other peaks to that at 276 nm is higher than that previously observed (11Hidalgo E. Demple B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 138-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), reflecting its higher iron content.Reductive Titration with DithioniteReduction by dithionite (Fig. 4) produced a decrease in absorbance above 300 nm as observed with [2Fe-2S] ferredoxins (23Mayhew S.G. Petering D. Palmer G. Foust G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 2830-2834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When the reduced protein was aerated, the original spectrum was almost completely restored within 2 min (Fig. 4, curve d), indicating that SoxR is readily autooxidized and that the spectral changes had been caused by the reversible reduction of the protein and not by its denaturation.Figure 4:Reductive titration of SoxR by sodium dithionite. A solution of 0.28 mM sodium dithionite in 20 mM MOPS buffer (pH 7.6) was added incrementally to SoxR (0.37 mg/ml) under anaerobic conditions in a 1-cm path length cuvette. Spectra were recorded: a, before treatment; b, after partial titration; c, after full titration; and d, after re-exposure to air for 2 min. Inset, Titration of a SoxR solution containing 34 μM bound Fe.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Oxidized [2Fe-2S] and [4Fe-4S] centers each accept one electron from dithionite (23Mayhew S.G. Petering D. Palmer G. Foust G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 2830-2834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When SoxR protein was titrated anaerobically with dithionite, 0.5 reducing equivalent was accepted per gram atom of iron (Fig. 4, inset). These results strongly suggest that each Fe-S center contains 2Fe. Because there are only 2Fe and 4 cysteines per chain of SoxR, there should be one [2Fe-2S] center per chain.EPR SpectrumUntreated SoxR produced no EPR signal, thereby ruling out the presence of a [3Fe-3S] or [3Fe-4S] cluster (31Cammack R. Patil D.S. Fernandez V.M. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1985; 13: 572-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). A sample reduced by dithionite gave EPR signals with g values of 2.01, 1.92, and 1.90 (Fig. 5), which are consistent with those of an S = 1/2 [2Fe-2S] center and close to those produced by the [2Fe-2S] cluster in E. coli fumarate reductase (2.03, 1.93, 1.92) (32Werth M.T. Sices H. Cecchini G. Schröder I. Lasage S. Gunsalus R.P. Johnson M.K. FEBS Lett. 1992; 299: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The almost axial spectrum resembles that first described for the hydroxylase type of [2Fe-2S] protein, which is exemplified by putidaredoxin and adrenodoxin (g = 2.02, 1.94, 1.94) (33Yoon P.S. Rawlings J. Orme-Johnson W.H. DeLuca H.F. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 2172-2176Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar).Figure 5:EPR spectrum (25 K) of SoxR after 50% reduction by dithionite. The data (solid line) are superimposed by a simulation (dashed line) with g values: 1.903, 1.922, 2.007, and line widths given in g units: 0.0086, 0.0065, and 0.0041, respectively. The incident microwave power was 0.4 milliwatt; the field modulation amplitude was 0.5 mT.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)EPR spectroscopy was performed on samples of SoxR that had been titrated spectrophometrically with dithionite. For a fully titrated solution of SoxR containing 45 μm of bound iron, the density of unpaired electron spins (i.e. the concentration of Fe-S centers) was 22 μM; for a half-titrated one, it was 11 μM. These results confirmed that there are 2Fe per Fe-S cluster.Sequence SimilaritiesUsing Genetics Computer Group software (34Devereux J. Haeberli P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (11516) Google Scholar), we scanned the SWISS-PROT data base (35Bairoch A. Boeckmann B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2019-2022Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) for Fe-S proteins with sequences similar to a 20-amino acid segment of SoxR encompassing the cysteine cluster. The greatest similarity was found with the [4Fe-4S] centers in bacterial ferredoxins, almost all of which share the following consensus sequence with SoxR around the first two cysteines: D XC(I,L,V) XCG. However, the spacing of the cysteines in SoxR (C X2C XC X5C) is unique; the bacterial ferredoxins, e.g. have two amino acids separating the second and third cysteines. MerR, a Hg-binding protein to which SoxR seems most closely related (9Amábile-Cuevas C.F. Demple B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4479-4484Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), has little homology to SoxR in this region, has only three cysteines (C XC X8C), and does not contain an Fe-S cluster.DISCUSSIONActive SoxR is a homodimer.

These changes play important roles in many physiological and pathological events. By differential screening of a cDNA library prepared from interleukin-1α and tumor necrosis factor-α-stimulated human dermal microvascular endothelial cells, we have identified a novel cytokine-inducible gene, designated as C-193. The compiled cDNA sequence of C-193 is 1901 base pairs long and shows no significant homology with any known gene sequence. Genomic DNA analysis revealed that C-193 is encoded by a single gene, which is conserved in different mammalian species. The C-193 gene was localized to human chromosome 10 by Southern blot analysis of somatic cell hybrids. Multiple AT-rich mRNA decay elements were identified in the 3′-untranslated region. C-193 mRNA expression was rapidly and transiently induced by treatment with interleukin-1α or tumor necrosis factor-α, reached a peak of expression about 16 h post tumor necrosis factor-α stimulation, and the induction of C-193 was protein synthesis independent. Lipopolysaccharide and cycloheximide were also potent inducers of C-193 mRNA. Therefore, C-193 represents a new addition to the primary response gene family. In vitro translation of C-193 yielded a 36-kDa protein product, consistent with the predicted open reading frame of 318 amino acids and a calculated molecular mass of 36 kDa for C-193 protein. The predicted protein sequence contains a basic amino acid cluster similar to a nuclear localization signal, four tandem repeats of ankyrin-like sequence, and multiple consensus protein phosphorylation sites. C-193 was engineered with a FLAG tag at its carboxyl terminus and transiently expressed in COS cells. Consistent with the presence of a putative nuclear localization signal, the C-193-FLAG protein was localized to the nucleus of transfected COS cells by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy.

Swerlick R.A. Burns D.K. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 4179-4189PubMed Google Scholar). In this report, we describe the isolation and characterization of a cDNA designated as C-193 which encodes a novel, cytokine-inducible nuclear protein in endothelial cells. HDMEC were isolated from human neonatal foreskins and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were isolated from fresh umbilical cords by collagenase digestion as described previously (13Chu W. Presky D.H. Swerlick R.A. Burns D.K. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 4179-4189PubMed Google Scholar, 14Jaffe E.A. Nachman R.L. Becker C.G. Minick C.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1973; 52: 2745-2756Crossref PubMed Scopus (5924) Google Scholar). All cells were used under five passages. Total RNA was extracted from IL-1α- and TNF-α-stimulated HDMEC (500 units/ml each for 16 h) and unactivated HUVEC by the guanidine isothiocyanate method (15Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16602) Google Scholar). Poly(A)+RNA was purified by two cycles of chromatography on oligo(dT)-cellulose (16Aviv H. Leder P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1972; 69: 1408-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (5170) Google Scholar). All cDNAs used for library construction and probe synthesis were primed with oligo(dT) primer. A cDNA library was prepared in pcDNAI (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) from HDMEC stimulated for 16 h with IL-1α and TNF-α by the method of Gubler and Hoffman as described previously (13Chu W. Presky D.H. Swerlick R.A. Burns D.K. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 4179-4189PubMed Google Scholar, 17Gubler U. Hoffman B.J. Gene (Amst.). 1983; 25: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (3062) Google Scholar). The library was screened at 500 colonies/150-mm plate by differential hybridization as described (18Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 9.47-9.55Google Scholar). Radioactively labeled cDNA prepared from unstimulated HUVEC poly(A)+RNA was used as control probe while cDNA prepared from cytokine-stimulated HDMEC poly(A)+served as the induced probe. Colonies which hybridized only to the induced probe were rescreened, and their DNA was isolated and sequenced using an automated DNA thermocycle sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). To isolate the full-length cDNA encoding C-193 sequence, the entire cDNA fragment of MEC-193 was used as a probe to screen a cDNA library prepared in λSH lox (Novagen, Madison, WI) from HUVEC stimulated for 4 h with IL-1α and TNF-α. Hybridization screening was carried out with radioactively labeled MEC-193 insert in 6 × SSC (1 × SSC is 150 mM NaCl, 15 mM sodium citrate, pH 7.0), 5 × Denhardt's solution, and 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA overnight at 65°C. After hybridization, the filters were washed in 0.1 × SSC at 65°C prior to autoradiography. The nucleotide sequence was determined for both strands of positive clones isolated, and the DNA sequence was compiled from the overlapping cDNA clones. Sequence analysis was performed using the Genetics Computer Group software package (19Devereux J. Haeberli P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (11511) Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis was performed according to standard methods as described (18Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 9.47-9.55Google Scholar). RNA was isolated from ∼3 × 106cells of each cell type using a micro RNA isolation system from Pharmacia LKB Biotechnol. For studies examining the kinetics of C-193 mRNA induction, subconfluent HDMEC or HUVEC were grown in T-75 flasks, treated with the indicated inducer for the specified time period, and then RNA was isolated as described above. RNA samples were separated on a 1.2% agarose, formaldehyde gel and transferred to a Nytran membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). The 5′ SphI restriction fragment of clone H193-2 was radioactively labeled using a random hexanucleotide labeling kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and used as a probe. The hybridization conditions were 3 × SSC, 50% formamide, 5 × Denhardt's solution, 0.1% SDS at 42°C. After hybridization the filter was washed two times with 0.5 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 60°C for 30 min each. Plasmid construct C-193F, which contains near full-length cDNA sequence of C-193, was prepared by exchange of the 5′ end SstI restriction fragment of H193-13 with the corresponding fragment isolated from clone H193-21 using a SstI site upstream to the cloning site in the pSH lox vector. C-193-FLAG/pcDNAI was constructed by inserting a polymerase chain reaction fragment of the C-193 coding region only (nucleotides 250-1206) into a pcDNAI vector. The polymerase chain reaction was performed with plaque-forming units DNA polymerase (Stratagene) and a set of primers as shown below: 5′-CGGGATCCGCCACCATGATGGTACTGAAAGTAGAGG-3′ and 5′-GCTCTAGACTACTTGTCATCGTCGTCCTTGTAGTCGAATGTAGCTATGCGAGAGGT-C-3′. The 3′ primer encodes an eight amino acid FLAG peptide tag (20Hopp T.P. Prickett K.S. Price V. Libby R.T. March C.J. Cerretti P. Urdal D.L. Conlon P.J. BioTechnology. 1988; 6: 1205-1210Crossref Scopus (732) Google Scholar) to facilitate subsequent detection and characterization of C-193-FLAG recombinant protein. The orientation and DNA sequence were verified by DNA sequencing of all constructs. The two DNA constructs C-193F and C-193-FLAG were linearized with NotI 3′ of the cloning site in the vector and used as templates for in vitro transcription with T7 RNA polymerase (Stratagene) and subsequent in vitro translation with rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Stratagene) in the presence of [35S]methionine (Amersham Corp.) according to the manufacturers' instructions. Aliquots of the in vitro translated products were used for immunoprecipitation, DNA cellulose binding studies, and were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The gels were fixed with 40% methanol, 10% acetic acid for 30 min, treated with Enlightening (DuPont NEN) for 30 min, dried, and exposed to x-ray film. The polymerase chain reaction fragment which contains the entire protein coding region of C-193 and a FLAG tag attached to its carboxyl terminus as described above was blunt ended and inserted into a mammalian expression vector pEF-BOS (21Mizushima S. Nagata S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1481) Google Scholar) to yield the C-193-FLAG/pEF-BOS expression construct. The proper orientation of the insert and its DNA sequence were confirmed by DNA sequencing. This DNA was introduced into COS cells by DEAE-dextran transfection as described previously (12Chu W. Presky D.H. Swerlick R.A. Burns D.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 695-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). The transfected cells were cultured at 37°C in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum for 48-72 h before harvesting. For immunofluorescence staining, COS cells transfected with either C-193-FLAG/pEF-BOS or control pEF-BOS DNA were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde for 10 min and incubated sequentially with a PBS solution containing 10 mM glycine for 10 min and PBS solution with 1% Triton X-100. Immunofluorescence staining was performed using monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody M2 (Eastman Kodak Co.) at 5 μg/ml and the F(ab′)2fragment of affinity purified, rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Cappel, West Chester, PA). The stained cells were washed and viewed under a Zeiss epifluorescence microscope. For immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis of the C-193-FLAG protein, COS cells were transfected with the expression construct C-193-FLAG/pEF-BOS or control pEF-BOS vector DNA alone by electroporation using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser System as described (22Chu G. Hayakawa H. Berg P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 1311-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). The transfected cells were scraped from the plates after 72 h and washed with PBS. Cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts for each transfectant were prepared by the methods of Dignam et al. (23Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9100) Google Scholar). Cell extracts, normalized to the same cell equivalents, were diluted with CHAPS lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mM CHAPS, 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM iodoacetamide, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and incubated with 5 μg of M2 antibody and 50 μl of GammaBind G Sepharose (Pharmacia) for 4 h at 4°C. The immunoprecipitates were washed four times with CHAPS lysis buffer, boiled in SDS sample buffer, and aliquots were separated by SDS-PAGE. The gel was electrotransfered onto a Nitrocellulose membrane for Western blot analysis. The membrane was blocked in Tris-buffered saline solution containing 5% non-fat dry milk, incubated with M2 antibody at 5 μg/ml followed by an affinity purified, peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Boehringer Mannheim), and developed using the ECL system (Amersham) following the manufacturer's instructions. FLAG-tagged bacterial alkaline phosphatase (BAP-FLAG) was included as a control for the Western blot process. Equivalent amounts of the same extracts were also subjected to Western blot analysis with a rabbit anti-GAPDH antisera (Chemicon International Inc., Temecula, CA), followed by peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG as described above. Human genomic DNA (10 μg each, Clontech Laboratories Inc.) was digested to completion with the indicated restriction enzymes (Boehringer Mannheim). The cleaved DNA was separated by electrophoresis on a 0.8% agarose gel and transferred onto a Nytran membrane. The filter was probed with the 5′ end of SphI restriction fragment of clone H193-2 as described previously for Northern hybridization. A Southern blot containing genomic DNA from a panel of human/hamster hybrid cell lines (Bios Corporation, New Haven, CN) was probed with the 5′ SphI restriction fragment of clone H193-2 to determine the chromosomal location of the C-193 gene. The chromosomal assignment obtained by the above hybrid blot was further confirmed by using polymerase chain reaction to amplify a 300-base pair long C-193 gene-specific fragment from DNA of human/rodent somatic cell hybrids obtained from Coriell Cell Repositories (Camden, NJ). Equivalent amounts of [35S]methionine-labeled C-193-FLAG protein prepared by in vitro translation as described above was applied to either a 2.0-ml DNA cellulose column (containing 0.25-1.5 mg of native calf thymus DNA/ml of Whatman CF cellulose, Pharmacia) or a Whatman CF-1 cellulose column in column buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10% glycerol, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing 50 mM NaCl. The flow-through was reapplied to the columns, which were then washed twice each with one column volume of column buffer containing 20 mM NaCl. The columns were step eluted sequentially with two column volumes of column buffer containing 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, and 1.0 M NaCl. A portion of each fraction (100 μl) was mixed with 3 ml of Aquasol scintillation fluid (Eastman Kodak Co.) and counted in a Beckman LS7800 liquid scintillation counter. For immunoprecipitation analysis, each fraction of the DNA cellulose column was adjusted to CHAPS lysis buffer conditions (described above) and immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody M2 followed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography as described above. In order to identify genes preferentially expressed in cytokine-activated HDMEC, a cDNA library was constructed using mRNA isolated from HDMEC stimulated for 16 h with IL-1α and TNF-α and screened by differential hybridization as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Duplicate filter lifts of approximately 4 × 104recombinant colonies were hybridized with radioactively labeled cDNA probes generated from mRNA isolated from either 16-h IL-1α- and TNF-α-stimulated HDMEC (induced probe) or unstimulated HUVEC (control probe). Because the availability of the primary HDMEC is very limited, we took advantage of the similarities between HUVEC and HDMEC and used HUVEC cDNA as the control probe. Thus, positive clones which hybridized only to the induced probe represent either true cytokine-inducible genes or genes not induced by cytokine but expressed at higher levels in HDMEC. These positive clones were rescreened and their DNA isolated for further characterization. Among those positive clones isolated were multiple forms of human E-selectin cDNA, an endothelial cell-specific cell surface glycoprotein expressed only in activated endothelial cells (6Strieter R.M. Kunkel S.L. Showell H.J. Remick D.C. Phan S.H. Ward P.A. Marks R.M. Science. 1989; 243: 1467-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar, 13Chu W. Presky D.H. Swerlick R.A. Burns D.K. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 4179-4189PubMed Google Scholar). One of the positive clones isolated, designated as MEC-193, is approximately 0.5 kilobase long and appears to encode part of a 2.0-kilobase mRNA whose expression is rapidly induced by IL-1α or TNF-α in both HDMEC and HUVEC as indicated by Northern blot analysis (see below). To isolate the full-length sequence, the insert of MEC-193 was used as a probe for screening a second cDNA library prepared from HUVEC stimulated with IL-1α and TNF-α for 4 h. After screening a total of 3 × 105plaques at high stringency, about 90 hybridization-positive plaques were identified, which represents about 0.03% of the total mRNA population of cytokine activated HUVEC. Four overlapping clones were subsequently isolated, and their DNA was sequenced. Sequence analysis confirmed that these clones overlap the original MEC-193 sequence (Fig. 1). The compiled sequence consists of 1901 base pairs which end with a short poly(A) stretch. The lack of a typical polyadenylation signal preceding the poly(A) sequence suggests that the poly(A) stretch may be an internal sequence. Interestingly, multiple mRNA decay elements, ATTTA, are found in the 3′-untranslated region. These “AU-rich” elements are commonly found in mRNAs of cytokines, proto-oncogenes, and primary response genes and are implicated in the rapid turnover of the corresponding mRNA (24Shaw G. Kamen R. Cell. 1986; 46: 659-667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3092) Google Scholar). A single open reading frame, beginning with the ATG at nucleotide 250, was identified which encodes a protein with 319 amino acid residues, designated as C-193. There is an in-frame stop codon, TGA, found at bases 55-57 upstream of the initiation sequence of the open reading frame (Fig. 1), further supporting the idea that the identified putative open reading frame encodes a full-length protein. A search of current DNA and protein data bases (GenBank, release 84.0, and Swiss-PROT, release 29.0) with C-193 nucleotide or amino acid sequences failed to identify any known sequences with significant homology. Northern blot analysis with RNA isolated from various human cell lines indicated that C-193 expression is mainly restricted to activated vascular endothelial cells, both microvascular and large vessel, as represented by HDMEC and HUVEC, respectively (Figs. 2 and 3). C-193 gene expression is rapidly and dramatically induced in both HDMEC and HUVEC after stimulation with IL-1α, TNF-α, and LPS. TNF-α seems to be the most potent inducer of C-193 in both types of cells. A significant amount of C-193 mRNA expression has been consistently observed in unstimulated HUVEC (Fig. 3). However, this basal expression can be further increased upon stimulation. In contrast, very low levels of expression were seen in unstimulated HDMEC detectable only after a prolonged exposure (data not shown). The induction by cytokine stimulation observed in endothelial cells was not affected by the addition of the protein synthesis inhibitor CHX, suggesting ongoing protein synthesis is not required for induction. Furthermore, CHX alone is able to cause significant induction of C-193 mRNA expression in both HDMEC and HUVEC. Except for a low level of expression detected in unstimulated Hep G2 cells, no C-193 expression was detected in any other types of unstimulated cells examined including epithelial cells (HeLa), bladder carcinoma cells (5637), fibroblasts (MRC-5), and melanoma cells (C-32) (Fig. 3). C-193 expression was not detected in either IL-1, TNF-α, or calcium ionophore A23187 stimulated or resting cells of hematopoietic lineage including the YT and Kit225 cell lines (data not shown). C-193 expression was detected in TNF-α-stimulated MRC-5 cells (data not shown). To study the kinetics of induction of C-193 mRNA, HDMEC were stimulated with TNF-α for various times, and their cytoplasmic RNA was isolated for Northern blot analysis with a C-193 cDNA fragment as probe. As shown in Fig. 4, no detectable C-193 mRNA is found in the unstimulated HDMEC. However, upon treatment with TNF-α, C-193 expression is rapidly induced within 30 min and reaches a maximum level after about 16 h. The deduced C-193 protein contains 319 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of 36 kDa and a pI of 7.10. There is no apparent signal peptide or recognizable hydrophobic transmembrane region in this protein. Sequence analysis of the predicted amino acid sequence using the Wordsearch program indicated a domain containing four tandem ankyrin-like repeats (25Lux S.E. John K.M. Bennett V. Nature. 1990; 344: 36-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar) located close to the carboxyl terminus of the protein (Fig. 1). In addition, a cluster of basic residues, KKRKK, was found preceding the ankyrin-like repeats. This type of basic residue cluster has been implicated in intracellular protein trafficking into the nucleus and is referred to as a nuclear localization signal (26Dingwall C. Sharnick S.V. Laskey R.A. Cell. 1982; 30: 449-458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 27Garcia-Bustos J. Heitman J. Hall M.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1071: 83-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar, 28Silver P.A. Cell. 1991; 64: 489-497Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Other interesting features include a putative Tyr phosphorylation site at amino acid 33 and a sequence containing multiple putative Ser and Thr phosphorylation sites present at the extreme carboxyl terminus, suggesting that protein phosphorylation may play a role in regulation of C-193 protein function. A PEST-rich (52%) region at residues 108-126 was also identified. The PEST-rich sequence is thought to confer susceptibility to rapid intracellular degradation and is expressed in many short-lived proteins, including c- myc, c- fos, and p53 (29Roger S. Wells R. Rechsteiner M. Science. 1986; 234: 364-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1919) Google Scholar). To verify the identified open reading frame and to characterize the polypeptide product encoded by C-193 mRNA, in vitro transcription and translation analysis was performed. Plasmids C-193F and C-193-FLAG/pcDNAI were used as the templates. As shown in Fig. 5 A, a predominant band was detected from the in vitro translated product of each construct at a position which is in agreement with the predicted molecular weight for C-193 protein, demonstrating that the predicted open reading frame of C-193 is able to direct the synthesis of C-193 protein. To examine whether the FLAG tag attached to the carboxyl terminus of C-193 is functional, equivalent amounts of translation products were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody M2 and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. As expected, the in vitro translated C-193-FLAG protein was specifically immunoprecipitated from translation products of construct C-193-FLAG/pcDNAI, but not C-193F, suggesting that antibody M2 and C-193-FLAG protein could be used for further characterization of C-193 protein. A polymerase chain reaction fragment containing C-193 coding region and a FLAG tag at the carboxyl terminus was inserted into an expression vector pEF-BOS generating C-193-FLAG/pEF-BOS. To determine the subcellular distribution pattern of the C-193-FLAG protein, indirect immunofluorescence staining and immunoprecipitation experiments with anti-FLAG antibody were performed using COS cells transfected either with C-193-FLAG/pEF-BOS or pEF-BOS vector DNA alone. As shown in Fig. 6 A, C-193 protein is abundantly expressed and sequestered predominantly within the nucleus of COS cells transfected with C-193-FLAG/pEF-BOS (left panel). No fluorescent staining was detected in COS cells transfected with the vector DNA as control (right panel). To further confirm its nuclear localization, immunoprecipitation of C-193-FLAG protein directly from nuclei isolated from transfected COS cells was carried out. As shown in Fig. 6 B, cytoplasmic (lane 1) and nuclear (lane 2) extracts were prepared from COS cells transfected with C-193-FLAG/pEF-BOS or pEF-BOS vector DNA alone (control DNA). The immunoprecipitates were separated by electrophoresis on a 4-20% SDS-PAGE, and then transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was incubated with anti-FLAG antibody M2 followed by a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and visualized with an ECL system. Consistent with the immunofluorescence results, the intact C-193-FLAG protein was detected in the nuclear fraction of C-193-FLAG/pEF-BOS transfected COS cells, although there was still a significant amount of protein that remained in the cytoplasmic fraction, probably due to ongoing protein synthesis. Interestingly, there were two a"

Resequencing of the neutral trehalase gene NTH1 on chromosome IV resulted in the observation of two possible start codons (Kopp, M., Nwaka, S., and Holzer, H. (1994) Gene (Amst.) 150, 403-404). We show here that only the most upstream start codon which initiates translation of the longest possible ORF is used for expression of NTH1 in vivo. A gene with 77% identity with NTH1, YBR0106, which was discovered during sequencing of chromosome II (Wolfe, K. H., and Lohan, A. J. E. (1994) Yeast 10, S41-S46), is shown here to be expressed into mRNA. Experiments with a mutant disrupted in the YBR0106 ORF showed, in contrast to a NTH1 deletion mutant, no changes in trehalase activity and in trehalose concentration. However, similar to the NTH1 gene a requirement of the intact YBR0106 gene for thermotolerance is demonstrated in experiments with the respective mutants. This indicates that the products of the likely duplicated YBR0106 gene and the NTH1 gene serve a heat shock protein function. In case of the YBR0106 gene, this is the only phenotypic feature found at present.

It is furthermore supposed to serve as a reserve carbohydrate during starvation and for germination of spores (for reviews, see Refs. 1Thevelein J.M. Microbiol.

Because nth1 mutants show high activity of acid trehalase, this is strong evidence for neutral trehalase, and not acid trehalase, being the catalyst of hydrolysis of trehalose in intact cells. Recently, Wolfe and Lohan (11Wolfe K.H. Lohan A.J.E. Yeast. 1994; 10: S41-S46Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) described a gene, YBR0106, located on chromosome II, whose predicted amino acid sequence showed 77% identity with the amino acid sequence predicted from the NTH1 gene published by Kopp et al. (6Kopp M. Müller H. Holzer H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4766-4774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Kopp M. Nwaka S. Holzer H. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 150: 403-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Because of the high identity of the predicted NTH1 and YBR0106 gene products as well as the high homology of the YBR0106 gene product to other trehalase sequences from a variety of animals and bacteria, the YBR0106 gene was designated a trehalase gene (11Wolfe K.H.

Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar). Escherichia coli (DH5α) strain was grown on LB medium (0.5% yeast extract, 1% NaCl, 1% bacto-tryptone) and supplemented as required. Standard molecular and recombinant DNA techniques were applied as described by Sambrook et al. (14Sambrook J. Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Competent yeast cells were prepared by lithium acetate, and transformation was as described by Ito et al. (15Ito H. Murata K. Kimura A. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1984; 48: 175-179Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). All plasmids were amplified in E. coli (DH5α) as described by Mandel and Higa (16Mandel M. Higa A. J. Mol. Biol. 1970; 53: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (1528) Google Scholar). The YBR0106 ORF was disrupted according to the one-step disruption protocol described by Rothstein (17Rothstein R.J. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 202-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (2033) Google Scholar), using a 3.8-kb1( 1The abbreviations used are: kbkilobase pair(s)bpbase pair(s)PCRpolymerase chain reaction.) HindIII fragment (containing 2.37 kb from the 5′-noncoding region, plus a 1.43-kb 5′ part of the 2.34-kb YBR0106 ORF) in pBluescript (a gift from Dr. K. Wolfe, University of Dublin). kilobase pair(s) base pair(s) polymerase chain reaction. This plasmid was digested with BglII, which has a unique site in this plasmid (at position 1.154 kb of the YBR0106 ORF). The URA3 gene isolated as a BamHI fragment from plasmid YDpU (18Berben G. Dumont J. Gilliquet V. Bolle P.A. Higler F. Yeast. 1991; 7: 475-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar) was inserted into the BglII site. The resulting plasmid bearing the disruption of the YBR0106 ORF was digested with HindIII prior to transformation into the wild type yeast strains YS18 and YSN1 (nth1ΔLEU2) (8Nwaka S. Kopp M. Burgert M. Deuchler I. Kienle I. Holzer H. FEBS Lett. 1994; 344: 225-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) to yield strains YSN01 (ybr0106::URA3) and YSN1-01 (nth1ΔLEU2/ybr0106::URA3), respectively. The disruption was confirmed in uracil prototrophic transformants by Southern blot analysis using HindIII-digested chromosomal DNA from these strains and a 728-bp (SfuI/BstEII) fragment from the YBR0106 gene as a radiolabeled probe. For overexpression studies, the ORF previously reported for NTH1 (6Kopp M. Müller H. Holzer H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4766-4774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the corrected sequence (12Kopp M. Nwaka S. Holzer H. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 150: 403-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) were amplified by PCR using synthetic oligonucleotide primers with BamHI recognition sequences at the 5′ ends. The sequence of forward primer for the corrected NTH1 ORF sequence (12Kopp M. Nwaka S. Holzer H. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 150: 403-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) is 5′CGGGATCCATGAGTCAAGTTAATACAAGCCAAG3′ and of the reverse primer is 5′CGGGATCCCTATAGTCCATAGAGGTTTCTTTCT3′. The sequence of the forward primer for the previously reported NTH1 ORF (6Kopp M. Müller H. Holzer H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4766-4774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is 5′CGGGATCCATGAGTGTTTTCGATAATGTATCTC3′ and of the reverse primer is the same as used for the corrected sequence above. In a PCR reaction, using the above primers and plasmid pTZ18R (6Kopp M. Müller H. Holzer H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4766-4774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (containing the NTH1 gene and its flanking sequences as a 6-kb SalI DNA fragment), fragments of 2.253 kb and 2.079 kb were generated as seen on agarose gels. Similarly, the YBR0106 ORF was amplified by PCR from genomic DNA of nth1Δ strain (YSN1) using the following synthetic oligonucleotide primers, 5′CGGGATCCATGGTAGATTTTTTACCAAAAGTAACG3′ and 5′CGGGATCCTAGGTAATACAATTTTTTCTCAGAGGGTTTC3′ as forward and reverse primers, respectively. These were subcloned behind the inducible GAL1 promoter in a high copy 2μ-based plasmid (pYES2, purchased from Invitrogen) to generate p2.253 (for the corrected NTH1 ORF (12Kopp M. Nwaka S. Holzer H. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 150: 403-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar)), p2.079 (for the previously reported NTH1 ORF (6Kopp M. Müller H. Holzer H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4766-4774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)), and pYBR (for the YBR0106 ORF). The sequence of the PCR cloned fragments was verified by sequence analysis according to Ref. 19Igloi G.L. Schiefmermayr E. Biotechnique. 1993; 15: 486-497PubMed Google Scholar. A schematic representation of the overexpression strategy is shown in Fig. 1. We introduced the NTH1 deletion into SEY6211 (which is GAL+) according to Ref. 8 to get YSN1A (nth1ΔLEU2) and transformed it with p2.253, p2.079, and pYBR to get YSN1A/p2.253, YSN1A/p2.079, and YSN1A/pYBR, respectively. Transformation was also done in WCG4a to get WCG4a/p2.253, WCG4a/p2.079, and WCG4a/pYBR. For Southern blot analysis, yeast cells were grown to stationary phase on YEPD. The cells were converted to spheroplasts as described (20Wolska-Mitaszko B. Jakubowicz T. Kucharzweska T. Gasior E. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 116: 241-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), lysed by SDS and potassium acetate, and the DNA was precipitated and washed after RNase digestion. The DNA was digested, subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis, and blotted onto Amersham Hybond H+membrane according to the manufacturer's instruction. For Northern blot analysis, total RNA was isolated from exponential and stationary phase cells according to Chirgwin et al. (21Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16652) Google Scholar). The total RNA was separated on a 1% formaldehyde-agarose gel and transferred onto a Hybond+nylon membrane according to the manufacturer's instruction. The DNA probes for Southern and Northern blot analysis were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by the random priming method (22Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16651) Google Scholar). For measurement of trehalase activity, both the overlay assay on plates and assay with samples from crude extracts were performed. The neutral trehalase overlay assay was performed as described before (6Kopp M. Müller H. Holzer H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4766-4774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The acid trehalase overlay assay was performed using the same method as for neutral trehalase except that sodium citrate, 5 mM EDTA buffer, pH 4.5, at 37°C instead of 50 mM imidazole chloride, pH 7.0, was used and there was no activation by the cAMP, ATP, and MgCl2mixture (5App H. Holzer H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17583-17588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Kopp M. Müller H. Holzer H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4766-4774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Mittenbühler K. Holzer H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8537-8543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Trehalase assay from crude extracts of the two enzymes was performed according to Refs. 5 and 7, and total protein concentration was determined by the method of Lowry et al. (23Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Trehalose assay in boiled extracts from exponentially growing yeast cells and heat-stressed cells was performed by using acid trehalase, according to Kienle et al. (24Kienle I. Burgert M. Holzer H. Yeast. 1993; 9: 607-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Yeast strains to be tested were streaked on YEPD plates and incubated at 30°C for 3 days. The cells were then replica-plated onto fresh YEPD plates and transferred immediately to a temperature of 50°C for 7 h to 10 h. After this time, the cells were shifted back to 30°C, and growth was monitored daily. The replica-plated cells treated at 45°C for 2 days and shifted back to 30°C (cf. Ref. 25Toh-E A. Yasunaga S. Nisogi H. Tanaka K. Oguchi T. Matsui Y. Yeast. 1993; 9: 481-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) gave similar results as those cells which underwent a 50°C treatment for 7 h to 10 h. Thermotolerance abilities of cells were also checked on liquid culture: the cells were grown to stationary phase on YEPD for 48 h at 30°C, and an aliquot was taken for determination of cell survival. The cells were then shifted to 50°C for 20 min, and, after this time, an aliquot was removed for determination of cell survival. Equal dilutions of stationary cells before and after heat shock (50°C for 20 min) were plated onto YEPD plates and kept at 30°C. After 3 days, the cells were counted and the percentage of survival was calculated using the survival of non-heat-shocked cells as 100% control. Expression of the YBR0106 gene was checked by Northern blot analysis using total RNA prepared from the NTH1 deletion mutant strain YSN1 (nth1ΔLEU2). Using a 728-bp (SfuI/ BstEII) fragment from the YBR0106 gene (11Wolfe K.H. Lohan A.J.E. Yeast. 1994; 10: S41-S46Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) as a radiolabeled probe, a signal of about 2.6 kb was detected (upper part of Fig. 2). The rRNA run in parallel verified equal total RNA loaded on the gel (lower part of Fig. 2). This fits with the size of the ORF of the YBR0106 gene (2.34 kb according to Ref. 11) plus possible polyadenylation signals. It can also be seen from Fig. 2 that the expression of YBR0106 gene is low in exponential phase and high in stationary or late exponential phase of cells growing on glucose. To check a possible influence of the YBR0106 gene on neutral trehalase activity and on trehalose metabolism, a disruption of the YBR0106 gene was introduced into a wild type strain YS18 as well as into strain YSN1 (nth1ΔLEU2) to yield strains YSN01 (ybr0106::URA3) and YSN1-01 (nth1ΔLEU2/ybr0106::URA3), respectively. The disruption was constructed in pBluescript containing a 3.8-kb HindIII DNA fragment (part of which is a 1.43-kb 5′ part of the YBR0106 gene). A 1.1-kb URA3 marker with BamHI ends (18Berben G. Dumont J. Gilliquet V. Bolle P.A. Higler F. Yeast. 1991; 7: 475-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar) was subcloned into the unique BglII site in the YBR0106 gene part of the plasmid as described under “Materials and Methods.” Prior to introduction into the respective yeast strains, the disruption plasmid was digested with HindIII (to generate a 4.9-kb fragment containing the original 3.8-kb HindIII DNA fragment plus the 1.1-kb URA3 gene). In a Southern blot analysis, using HindIII-digested genomic DNA from the mutant strains YSN01 and YSN1-01 and control strain YSN1, and using a 728-bp (SfuI/ BstEII) fragment from the part of the YBR0106 gene in pBluescript as a radiolabeled probe, a bandshift corresponding to the size of the URA3 marker was seen in the mutants carrying the disrupted gene as compared to the control strain. Activity of neutral trehalase with and without preincubation with cAMP/ATP and of acid trehalase was assayed in crude extracts of mutant cells and wild type cells after growth to the late exponential phase. It can be seen from that disruption of the YBR0106 gene has no influence on neutral trehalase activity as compared to the wild type. In contrast, the nth1 deletion mutant as well as a nth1/ybr0106 double mutant, show no detectable neutral trehalase activity. As shown previously (5App H. Holzer H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17583-17588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), phosphorylation with cAMP/ATP increases neutral trehalase activity in extracts from late stationary cells 2- to 3-fold as expected. Acid trehalase activity is not changed by deletion of the NTH1 gene (6Kopp M. Müller H. Holzer H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4766-4774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); the activity increases, however, 2-fold in cells carrying the ybr0106 disruption. Consistent with Wolfe and Lohan (11Wolfe K.H. Lohan A.J.E. Yeast. 1994; 10: S41-S46Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), we consider the YBR0106 gene not to be the structural gene for acid trehalase. It might, however, be that the YBR0106 gene is a negative regulatory factor for expression of acid trehalase activity. In summary, it may be concluded that the YBR0106 gene is transcribed to the corresponding mRNA; however, its predicted translation product has no detectable neutral trehalase activity at pH 7. The “increased sensitivity to heat shock” of the ybr0106::URA3 described below indicates, however, a translation product with possible heat shock protein function. Expression and function of the genes NTH1 and YBR0106 were also studied in intact cells by measuring the degradation of trehalose upon shift of cells from the heat stress at 40°C (at which cells accumulate trehalose) to the normal growth temperature of 30°C (8Nwaka S. Kopp M. Burgert M. Deuchler I. Kienle I. Holzer H. FEBS Lett. 1994; 344: 225-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 9Attfield P.V. FEBS Lett. 1987; 225: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 10Hottiger T. Schmutz P. Wiemken A. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 5518-5522Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). It may be seen from Table III that trehalose degradation takes place in the ybr0106 disruption mutant to the same extent as in the wild type, whereas in the nth1 deletion mutant as well as in the nth1/ybr0106 double mutant only a slight or no trehalose disappearance is observed. These experiments with intact cells support the results observed using cell extracts (Table II) showing that a ybr0106 disruption has no influence on neutral trehalase activity.Table III:Change in trehalose concentration at recovery (30°C) from mild heat stress (40°C) in ybr0106 mutants compared to nth1 mutants and wild type YS18 Open table in a new tab Table II:Neutral trehalase and acid trehalase activity in ybr0106 mutants compared to nth1 mutants and wild type YS18 Open table in a new tab Due to the close proximity of the start codon previously reported for the NTH1 gene (6Kopp M. Müller H. Holzer H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4766-4774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to the one found in the corrected sequence of the NTH1 gene (12Kopp M. Nwaka S. Holzer H. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 150: 403-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), we decided to check (i) whether both start codons can be used for translation of the NTH1 mRNA (translation of a gene from two neighbored possible start codons has been shown before (26Northemann W. Shiels B.R. Braciak T.A. Hanson R.W. Heinrich P.C. Fey G.H. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 9194-9203Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 27Northemann W. Braciak T.A. Hattori M. Lee F. Fey G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16072-16082Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) or (ii) whether the N-terminal region of the gene is necessary for activity of neutral trehalase. We therefore constructed the strains YSN1A/p2.253 and YSN1A/p2.079. For definition of p2.253 and p2.079, see “Materials and Methods.” Neutral trehalase activities (with and without preincubation with cAMP/ATP) of exponentially growing cells on YEPGal medium (to induce the production of neutral trehalase from the GAL1 promoter by galactose (28Johnston M. Microbiol. Rev. 1987; 51: 458-476Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) are presented in. As expected from previous work (5App H. Holzer H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17583-17588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), neutral trehalase in wild type cells (SEY6211) showed a 3- to 10-fold increased activity after preincubation of the extracts with cAMP/ATP. Neutral trehalase activity in cells with a NTH1 deletion is not detectable (Table IV, line 2). The strain YSN1A/p2.079 exhibits no detectable activity (Table IV, line 4), while the strain YSN1A/p2.253 showed several times higher activity under all conditions studied when compared to the wild type (, line 3). Similar results were also obtained using strains WCG4a/p2.253 and wild type WCG4a (data not shown). Furthermore, we constructed the strain YSN1A/pYBR and induced the overexpression of the YBR0106 gene by growth on galactose. Consistent with the idea that the possible YBR0106 gene product has no neutral trehalase activity, we could not detect any significant neutral trehalase activity in YSN1A/pYBR strain (Table IV, line 5).Table IV:Neutral trehalase activity in exponentially growing wild type and cells transformed with p2.253, p2.079, and pYBR Open table in a new tab A possible role of the trehalase genes, YBR0106 and NTH1, in the heat shock response was analyzed both on plates and in liquid cultures of stationary growing yeast cells. It can be seen in Fig. 3, that stationary phase cells of wild type YS18 and mutants YSN01 (ybr0106::URA3), YSN1 (nth1ΔLEU2), and YSN1-01 (nth1ΔLEU2/ybr0106::URA3) on YEPD plates treated at 50°C for 7 h showed different growth or recovery patterns when shifted back from 50°C to 30°C. A similar effect was seen when the cells were treated at 45°C for 2 days and shifted back from 45°C to 30°C. These differences in recovery from the high temperature treatment correlates to the presence or lack of either the NTH1 gene or the YBR0106 gene or both. After treatment at 50°C for 7 h, wild type cells resume growth at 30°C at a rate cells do without 50°C treatment. In contrast, the strains YSN1 (nth1ΔLEU2), YSN01 (ybr0106::URA3), and YSN1-01 (nth1ΔLEU2/ybr0106::URA3) showed an obvious delay in resumption of normal growth. The thermotolerance of these strains was also analyzed in liquid culture of stationary cells grown on YEPD (for details, see “Materials and Methods”). The survival data are 50-59% for the single mutants, 42% for the double mutants, and 77% for the wild type cells, which is in agreement with the result of the experiments done on solid medium. It may be emphasized that increased sensitivity to heat shock, i.e. a heat shock protein function, is the only phenotypic property known at present for the YBR0106 “trehalase” gene. A similar result was recorded for exponentially growing NTH1 deletion mutant cells pretreated at 40°C for 40 min and heat-shocked at 50°C for 10 or 20 min when wild type YS18 and strain YSN1 (nth1ΔLEU2) were compared (see Table I in Ref. 8). Discovery of a N-terminal extension (11Wolfe K.H. Lohan A.J.E. Yeast. 1994; 10: S41-S46Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 12Kopp M. Nwaka S. Holzer H. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 150: 403-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) of the previously described gene NTH1 (6Kopp M. Müller H. Holzer H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4766-4774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) raised the question whether the corrected ORF with the nucleotide extension or the previous ORF without extension was expressed in vivo. Experiments with the corresponding plasmids show that only the corrected NTH1 ORF is expressed yielding a protein with catalytic neutral trehalase activity (Table IV). We therefore identify the nucleotide sequence of the corrected ORF with “NTH1” (see the registration at the GenBank™/EMBL Data Bank, accession number X65925). A strong overexpression of neutral trehalase activity was observed in the transformed strain YSN1A/p2.253 (see Table IV). This feature may be useful for preparation of neutral trehalase with probably higher yield than in previous preparations from the ABYS mutant strain (5App H. Holzer H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17583-17588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The existence of two phosphorylation sites close to the N terminus are, in addition to the high identity of 77% of the amino acid sequence and 72% at nucleotide sequence level (according to computer analysis), characteristic properties indicating similarity of YBR0106 and NTH1. These similarities, as well as the localization of the two genes adjacent to the centromeres on the right arm of chromosomes II and IV, respectively, support the proposal of origination of the central parts of chromosomes II and IV from duplication of an ancestral chromosome (11Wolfe K.H. Lohan A.J.E. Yeast. 1994; 10: S41-S46Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). As shown with Northern blot analysis, expression of YBR0106 clearly leads to the corresponding mRNA under glucose derepressing conditions (Fig. 2). Whether a catalytically active trehalose-degrading protein, the enzyme trehalase, is actually formed by translation of the mRNA is very questionable: a ybr0106::URA3 disruption mutant strain does not show any change in trehalose degradation or in trehalose levels as compared to the wild type strain under different conditions. The only phenotypic characteristic for the YBR0106 disruption mutant discovered, until now, is an increased sensitivity against heat shock at 50°C as compared to wild type (see Fig. 3). The decreased thermotolerance, i.e. the heat shock protein function of the YBR0106 gene, may perhaps be used for screening of YBR0106 suppressors. From the Northern blots shown in Fig. 2, it may be seen that expression of mRNA transcribed from YBR0106 is much higher in stationary phase cells as compared to exponentially growing cells. The dependence of gene expression on the presence of glucose in the culture medium is typical for genes which are under control of “catabolite repression” also called “glucose repression” (29Monod J. Growth. 1947; 11: 223-289Google Scholar, 30Magasanik B. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1961; 26: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 31Holzer H. Cell Biol. Rev. 1989; 21: 305-319Google Scholar). In yeast, besides several key enzymes of gluconeogenesis (31Holzer H. Cell Biol. Rev. 1989; 21: 305-319Google Scholar), neutral trehalase (5App H. Holzer H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17583-17588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and acid trehalase (7Mittenbühler K. Holzer H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8537-8543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) also are subject to catabolite repression. Repression by glucose generally points to a biologically significant function of the respective enzymes in glucose metabolism. A biological function of the glucose regulated “silent trehalase” YBR0106 may consist of making glucose available from trehalose or other carbohydrates under special growth conditions. We are planning more detailed experiments on catabolite repression and catabolite inactivation (32Holzer H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1976; 1: 178-181Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (158) Google Scholar) of the predicted YBR0106 gene product. Because up to now no influence of YBR0106 on trehalose levels could be detected, we also intend to search for hydrolytic activity of the predicted YBR0106 protein with substrates other than trehalose under varying conditions. The results shown in Fig. 3 clearly demonstrate that the trehalase genes NTH1 and YBR0106 may play an important role in thermotolerance as well as in aiding yeast cells for fast recovery from heat shock. This role of the trehalases in enhanced thermotolerance does not occur via trehalose accumulation, otherwise one would have seen the opposite effect in the NTH1 defective mutant (which does not hydrolyze trehalose) when compared to the wild type or in the YBR0106 defective mutant which behaves like wild type in terms of trehalose hydrolysis. Although stationary phase cells are thermotolerant and show high trehalose concentration (8Nwaka S. Kopp M. Burgert M. Deuchler I. Kienle I. Holzer H. FEBS Lett. 1994; 344: 225-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 9Attfield P.V. FEBS Lett. 1987; 225: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 10Hottiger T. Schmutz P. Wiemken A. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 5518-5522Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), they also exhibit high neutral trehalase activity and a high mRNA expression of the YBR0106 gene (Fig. 2). Therefore, the ability to acquire thermotolerance of the strains shown in Fig. 3 can only be correlated to the trehalases and not to the trehalose concentration. This is another example of lack of correlation between trehalose concentration and increase in thermotolerance (8Nwaka S. Kopp M. Burgert M. Deuchler I. Kienle I. Holzer H. FEBS Lett. 1994; 344: 225-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 33Winkler K. Kienle I. Burgert M. Wagner J.C. Holzer H. FEBS Lett. 1991; 291: 261-272Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In this context, it may be of interest that the newly described stress-regulated element called STRE (CCCCT) (34Kobayashi N. McEntee K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 248-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 35Marchler G. Schüller C. Adam G. Ruis H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1997-2003Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 36Gounalaki N. Thireos G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4036-4041Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) exists in the promoter region of the NTH1 and the YBR0106 genes which are induced at heat stress (41Nwaka S. Mechler B. Destruelle M. Holzer H. FEBS Lett. 1995; 360: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar).

Intriguingly, during evolution each species, and to greater extent each order, appears to have acquired a unique complement of these repetitive elements. A marked example of this divergence is provided by primates, which differ from other mammalian orders in possessing a particularly abundant set of ≈300 bp of RNA pol III-transcribed repeats known as the Alu family (10Houck C.M.

When considering the high degree to which the Alu family has been amplified, one question that must be addressed is how the host cell deals with the large potential sink for transcription factors that these pol III promoter-containing elements represent. This is a significant issue, since, unlike satellite sequences which tend to be masked in large heterochromatic domains, Alu and other pol III short interspersed elements (14Singer M.F.

It has been argued that the vast majority of Alu repeats lack appropriate 5′-flanking signals and thus, even if unmasked from chromatin proteins, would be unable to recruit basal pol III transcription factors efficiently (24Ullu E.

Howard, unpublished results. contradict this view, however, leading to the alternative proposal that Alu elements are subject to specific repression. Recently, one mechanism has been identified that has the potential to mediate selective Alu silencing (1Englander E.W. Wolffe A.P. Howard B.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19565-19573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Englander et al. (1Englander E.W. Wolffe A.P. Howard B.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19565-19573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that Alu sequences possess the capacity to fix the rotational and translational positions of tetramer or octamer particles reconstituted in vitro. In that study the reconstitution of an Alu element with octamers of core histones was shown to result in the complete abrogation of in vitro pol III-dependent template activity. It was further shown that transcription could be completely blocked when a CpG-methylated Alu template was reconstituted with (H3/H4)2tetramers. In principle, there are far-reaching implications to the finding that Alu elements can position nucleosomes; yet because in vitro reconstitution studies do not necessarily predict in vivo chromatin structure (29FitzGerald P.C. Simpson R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15318-15324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Gottesfeld J.M. Mol. Cell.

A. 1993; 90: 6415-6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), a critical question has remained as to whether Alu sequences also possess the capacity to position nucleosomes within native chromatin. To address this issue we examined Alu repeats as a family and at a single previously studied locus. Our results suggest that a readily detectable fraction of Alu repeats is associated with rotationally positioned nucleosomes in native chromatin. Examination of a single Alu previously shown to direct translational positioning of nucleosomes in vitro revealed a similarly phased array in chromatin. Nuclei were isolated from HeLa cells by modification of established methods. Briefly, cells were incubated for 30 min on ice in a hypotonic buffer (1 mM Tris, pH 8, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1 mM polymethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mM dithiothreitol) (35Schlissel M.S. Brown D.D. Cell. 1984; 37: 903-913Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) and Dounce homogenized (20 strokes) in the presence of 3 mM MgCl2and 0.1% Nonidet P-40. Nuclei were recovered by centrifugation through a 0.25 M and subsequently a 1 M sucrose layer in a swinging bucket rotor and resuspended in a storage buffer (0.25 M sucrose, 10 mM Tris, pH 8, 3 mM MgCl2, 0.4 mM polymethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 50% glycerol). The quality of various nuclei preparations was monitored by microscopy. Genomic DNA was purified following lysis of HeLa cells at 37°C for 3 h in the presence of 0.5% SDS and 0.2 mg/ml proteinase K. DNA was extracted several times with phenol:chloroform and precipitated by spooling from 70% ethanol. Primers were designed using the major Alu family consensus sequence which is expected to represent ∼65% of Alu repeats (36Willard C. Nguyen H.T. Schmid C.W. J. Mol. Evol. 1987; 26: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The primers were selected to minimize cross-hybridization due to homology between the left and the right monomer. Accordingly, the primer used to extend in the sense orientation on the lower strand of the left monomer spans residues 8-24 (5′-GCGGTGGCTCACGCCT-3′) and harbors a 3-bp mismatch with the corresponding region in the right monomer. Primer used for extension in the antisense orientation, on the upper strand of the left monomer, spans residues 96-122 (5′-TTAGTAGAGA(C/G)GGGGTTTCACCATG-3′) (27Panning B. Smiley J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3231-3244Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and is expected to extend through the full length of the left monomer. The upper strand of the right monomer was analyzed using an antisense primer comprising residues 262-278 (5′-GGAGTCTCGCTCTGTCG-3′) within the right monomer. Template DNA was purified following DNase I (Worthington) digest in nuclei; a typical digest was at 25°C with 0.04 unit/μg DNA for 0, 2, 4, and 6 min or with naked DNA at 0.001 unit/μg for 0, 15, 30, and 60 s. To confirm the integrity of DNA in a given preparation, samples were incubated without DNase I for 6 min or 60 s for nuclei and genomic DNA, respectively, and examined by primer extension. Linear amplification reactions were carried out with end-labeled primers (37Bresnick E.H. Rories C. Hager G.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 865-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) : subsequently to extensive denaturation, template DNA (50-100 ng) was amplified by 22 cycles of Vent polymerase (New England Biolabs)-mediated linear polymerase chain reaction. Cycles were as follows: 1 min at 90°C, 1 min at 52−56°C and 30 s at 72°C. Products were resolved in 6% polyacrylamide, 7 M urea gels. Scans of gels were generated with a PhosphorImager using the ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). Nuclei were digested with MNase at 0.3 unit/μg DNA for 3, 6, 9, or 12 min at 25°C. Nuclei incubated for 12 min without MNase served as a control for endogenous nuclease activity. Naked DNA was digested with 0.03 unit/μg DNA for 15, 30, 60, or 90 s; the control for endogenous nuclease activity was naked DNA incubated without MNase for 90 s. Samples were made 12.5 mM EDTA and 0.5% SDS to terminate the reaction and then incubated with 0.2 mg/ml proteinase K for 16 h at 37°C, phenol:chloroform extracted, and ethanol-precipitated. Purified DNA was dissolved in a large volume of Tris-EDTA and digested for 24 h with an excess of BamHI. Following precipitation digestion was carried out with KpnI under similar conditions. Digested DNA was resolved in a 10-cm 1.3% agarose gel and transferred to a Gene ScreenPlus hybridization membrane. DNA was UV-cross-linked to the membrane (Stratalinker) and baked for 2 h at 80°C. The hybridization probe was the BamHI/PflMI fragment comprising the 350 bp most upstream region in the AFP-Alu locus (corresponding to the BamHI/ KpnI fragment, spanning residues −466 to 789 relative to the start of the Alu repeat) (38Gibbs P.E.M. Zielinski R. Boyd C. Dugaiczyk A. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 1332-1343Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The probe was used at 4+107cpm/ml. Hybridization was at 65°C for 40 h, and washes were with 2 × SSC, 0.5% SDS at 25° and 40°C and with 0.2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65°C. Exposure was 8 days at 80°C. Computer algorithm developed to predict the phase and the strength of rotational positioning signals (39Calladine C.R. Drew H.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 192: 907-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) was used to analyze a random set of Alu repeats within their native genomic DNA context. For a DNA sequence window of specified length, this algorithm calculates an energy function (Ψ) related to bending the DNA along a nucleosomal surface (the major groove at the center of the DNA is assumed to face the histone core). When the window is moved along a longer input DNA sequence to be analyzed, the output from the program is a series of Ψ values. If rotational positioning information is present, these values form a sinusoidal pattern with a 10-bp periodicity. To investigate whether the capacity to position nucleosomes is a general property of Alu repeats, we first asked if a defined nucleosomal rotational phase could be detected in association with these elements. The approach employed was intranuclear DNase I footprinting in combination with linear primer extension (32Chipev C.C. Wolffe A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 45-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 37Bresnick E.H. Rories C. Hager G.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 865-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Alu consensus sequence primers (9Schmid C. Maraia R. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1992; 2: 874-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) were designed with two objectives: to permit detection of the majority of Alu repeats and to minimize cross-hybridization due to homology between the left and right monomer moieties within the dimeric Alu structure (Fig. 1 B). Using three appropriately positioned primers, the positions of DNase I cleavage were mapped for the upper (Fig. 1) and the lower strand (Fig. 2 A) of the left monomer as well as the upper strand of the right monomer (Fig. 2 B).Figure 2:Intranuclear footprinting pattern for Alu repeats.

A schematic representation of the relevant portion of Alu repeat is shown. Increasing incubation time points with DNase I are from left to right.

The inter-monomer spacer protected in nuclei and hypersensitive in naked DNA is denoted by a vertical bar.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Analysis of the upper strand for the left monomer was carried out using a primer that spans residues from position 96 to 122 (Fig. 1 B) within the consensus sequence of the major Alu subfamily (27Panning B. Smiley J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3231-3244Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 36Willard C. Nguyen H.T. Schmid C.W. J. Mol. Evol. 1987; 26: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). When extension products spanning the left monomer in an antisense orientation were resolved by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, a ≈10-bp periodicity in DNase I cleavage, suggestive of rotationally positioned nucleosomes, was observed. This pattern (Fig. 1 A, arrows), starts at position ≈55 within the left monomer and extends upstream beyond the start site of Alu repeats, consistent with the in vitro footprinting results (1Englander E.W. Wolffe A.P. Howard B.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19565-19573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Densitometric analysis of the footprint confirmed that the preferential nicking occurs at intervals consistent with a ∼10-bp helical phase (Fig. 1 C). Control reactions using naked DNA as substrate for DNase I demonstrated that naked Alu DNA is cleaved in a pattern that is clearly distinct from that observed for chromatin. Importantly, the footprinting pattern observed with native chromatin (Fig. 1 A) shows periodic DNase I cleavage sites located beyond the start of the Alu repeat. These findings strongly suggest that diverse 5′-flanking regions assume rotationally fixed nucleosomal positions dictated by the properties of adjacent Alu sequences. The lower strand of the left monomer was examined through extension of a primer spanning residues 8 → 24 (Fig. 2 A). To the extent that the translational phasing of nucleosomes agrees with previous in vitro results (1Englander E.W. Wolffe A.P. Howard B.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19565-19573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the region visualized with this primer should comprise the 3′ boundary of a nucleosome and a ∼ 70 bp inter-nucleosomal linker that spans the Alu pol III B box element, the 3′ end of the left monomer, and the A/T-rich inter-monomer spacer (see Fig. 1 B). Consistent with those earlier results, an extended ladder was not observed, i.e. at most one or two DNase I cleavage sites matching the predicted 10-bp periodicity were evident. A hypersensitive site detected in nuclei at about position 55, which is absent in the naked DNA control (Fig. 2 A, arrow), might correspond to a periodic cleavage site near the 3′ boundary of the nucleosome; alternative explanations that do not involve nucleosomes are, however, also likely. Inspection of this region revealed two additional features: (i) enhancement of cleavage within the B box at position ≈78 (Fig. 2 A, arrowhead) that is weak in naked DNA and (ii) partial protection over the proximal portion of the nuclease sensitive A/T-rich spacer between the left and the right monomers (Fig. 2 A, vertical bar). Thus, although these results indicate differences between chromatin and naked DNA, the patterns observed do not support the interpretation that a nucleosome resides beyond the B box of the left monomer. The DNase I cleavage pattern for the right monomer was determined for the upper strand by extension of a primer spanning Alu positions 262 → 278 within the right monomer (Fig. 1 B). The pattern in nuclei again differed significantly from that obtained with naked DNA. The most conspicuous disparity was the greatly diminished susceptibility to DNase I of the inter-monomer spacer (Fig. 2 B, vertical bar). This was observed previously, although to a lesser degree, for the lower strand (Fig. 2 A, vertical bar). No 10-bp ladder was evident within the right monomer to suggest rotational positioning, consistent with our failure to detect such a pattern earlier in an in vitro reconstitution system (1Englander E.W. Wolffe A.P. Howard B.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19565-19573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As noted previously (1Englander E.W. Wolffe A.P. Howard B.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19565-19573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the right monomer may be involved primarily in translational positioning, since it encompasses a nucleosome core-sized 146-bp sequence flanked on both sides by poly(A) tracts. Such poly(A) tracts are significantly underrepresented within the central ≈120 bp of MNase-resistant nucleosome core particles (40Prunell A. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 41Satchwell S.C. Drew H.R. Travers A.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 191: 659-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar). We next asked whether the observed rotational positioning of nucleosome-like particles over the left monomer region could be explained on the basis of Alu DNA sequence features. On the basis of in vitro and in vivo studies (29FitzGerald P.C. Simpson R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15318-15324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Calladine C.R. Drew H.R. J. Mol.

Di Mauro E. Negri R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9315-9319Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), local bending and flexural properties of DNA have been identified in some cases as primary determinants for this type of positioning. These properties can be calculated by a computer algorithm that predicts the phase and approximate relative strength of positioning information (39Calladine C.R. Drew H.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 192: 907-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The signature of a rotational signal in the output from this program is a sinusoidal curve with a 10-bp periodicity (no information of predictive value is provided on translational phasing). As shown in Fig. 3, inspection of a set of full-length Alu sequences in this manner reveals that a strong rotational signal is centered in the conserved Alu region (47Kariya Y. Kato K. Hayashizaki Y. Himeno S. Tarui S. Matsubara K. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 53: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) between the A and B box pol III promoter elements. Three lines of evidence, two experimental (this study and earlier in vitro results) (1Englander E.W. Wolffe A.P. Howard B.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19565-19573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and one theoretical, indicate that Alu left monomer elements are capable of setting the rotational phase of nucleosomes or nucleosome-like particles. An obvious question is whether the determined/predicted rotational phases revealed by these approaches are in agreement. Alignment of the rotational phases determined/predicted by these approaches is shown in Fig. 4. Within the uncertainties associated with such a comparison, it can be seen that consistent results are obtained in all three cases. From this analysis we conclude that rotational positioning for Alu elements as a group reflects DNA sequence features intrinsic to these repeats. We next addressed whether nucleosomes associated with Alu repeats assume a defined translational position in vivo. Initially, we carried out linear primer extension experiments (37Bresnick E.H. Rories C. Hager G.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 865-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) with MNase-digested mononucleosome-sized fragments and Alu consensus primers. Although in several experiments preferential nicking was detected at about the position expected for the upstream border of the Alu left monomer-associated nucleosomes, variability in the data obtained with different preparations of nuclei precluded a confident interpretation (data not shown). We therefore narrowed the analysis to a single Alu locus (AFP-Alu) that had been demonstrated previously to confer both translational and rotational nucleosome positioning in an in vitro reconstitution system (1Englander E.W. Wolffe A.P. Howard B.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19565-19573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Chromatin structure at the AFP-Alu locus was characterized by indirect end-labeling, a technique that allows detection of sites susceptible to MNase cleavage relative to a common restriction site (48Wu C. Nature. 1980; 286: 854-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar, 49McPherson C.E. Shim E.-Y. Friedman D.S. Zaret K.S. Cell. 1993; 75: 387-398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). HeLa cell nuclei were subjected to limited digestion with MNase, and the partial nature of cleavage was confirmed by the appearance of a nucleosome ladder. Following purification, DNA was subjected to extensive double restriction to allow release of a 1.2-kb Alu-containing fragment from the AFP locus (Fig. 5 A and D). The Alu repeat is located in the center of this 1.2-kb fragment, so a 350-bp upstream region was chosen as the probe for indirect end-labeling (Fig. 5 D). As shown in Fig. 5B, a signal corresponding to the full-length 1.2-kb fragment decreased in proportion to the extent of digestion with MNase, shifting gradually to a ladder of bands with a ≈200 bp spacing (Fig. 5 B, lanes 3-5). This pattern, which was absent in the naked DNA control (Fig. 5 C), suggests the existence of a translationally positioned nucleosomal array over the AFP-Alu repeat locus. It is noteworthy that the preferential MNase cleavage sites depicted in Fig. 5D are consistent with the nucleosomal organization observed previously with assembly of the 1.2-kb fragment in an in vitro reconstitution system (1Englander E.W. Wolffe A.P. Howard B.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19565-19573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The results presented in this study support the idea that a significant fraction of human Alu repeats is associated with rotationally positioned nucleosomes. Such positioning is consistent with previous in vitro experiments in which nucleosomes were found to assemble on the 5′ ends of Alu left monomer units in a nonrandom rotational phase. Remarkably, the observed in vivo positioning extends over 5′-genomic flanking sequences which for Alu sequences are known to be diverse in sequence structure (2Jelinek W.R. Schmid C.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1982; 51: 813-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 50Daniels G.R. Deininger P.L. Nature. 1985; 317: 819-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). This is the first instance to our knowledge in which a nonsatellite repetitive element appears to impose rotational positioning on sequences that do not comprise an integral part of their repeat unit. We cannot at present exclude the possibility that nonrepetitive flanking sequences contribute to the nucleosomal organization evident in our data. However, it was previously demonstrated that nucleosome positioning signals were contained within the Alu sequence (1Englander E.W. Wolffe A.P. Howard B.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19565-19573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This is consistent with theoretical bending and flexibility predictions of Alu sequences which suggest that the observed rotational positioning could be accounted for by structural features inherent to these elements. We do not know at present what fraction of Alu repeats conforms to the pattern detected here, as some 5′ sequences may have structural determinants that cannot be overridden by the Alu sequence; in addition, rotational signals may be lost due to random mutational drift. In this regard, we note that Alu-specific primers used to detect positioning were designed to match the consensus sequence of majority of human Alus and might not detect sequences that have been mutated significantly. In any case, the data presented here and previously (1Englander E.W. Wolffe A.P. Howard B.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19565-19573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggest that rotational positioning of nucleosomes can be dictated by these elements. In considering chromatin organization at the local level, translational positioning constitutes a separate parameter associated with nucleosome assembly. Results obtained with limited MNase digestion confirm that translational positioning of nucleosomes at a single locus, namely the AFP-Alu repeat within the fourth intron of the α-fetoprotein gene, is similar for both in vitro reconstitutes and native chromatin. Indirect evidence for translational positioning over Alu repeats as a group is at present limited to DNase I nicking results in which the characteristic 10-bp ladder appears to be centered over the start of Alu left monomer. For reasons that are not yet understood, efforts to determine translational positioning on Alu repeats as a group using MNase digestion in nuclei have met with limited success. The results obtained were inconclusive, possibly due to interfering non-nucleosomal proteins and/or variable MNase cleavage of diverse sequences near the 5′ edges of the left monomer-associated nucleosomes. Further work will be required to determine whether or not most Alu elements assemble nucleosomes with a preferential translational phase. There are at least two reasons that nucleosome interactions with Alu repetitive elements in the human genome merit close examination. The first relates to Alu transcriptional regulation: a satisfactory understanding has been lacking as to why these elements are expressed at extremely low levels in normal somatic cells. In contradiction to an early proposal that Alu pol III promoters are defective, it has been shown that some Alu elements are strongly transcribed both in vivo and in vitro (27Panning B. Smiley J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3231-3244Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 28Panning B. Smiley J.R. Virology. 1994; 202: 408-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 51Pan J. Elder J.T.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 6439-6456Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Since Alu repeats are heavily methylated at CpG dinucleotides in vivo (54Schmid C.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5613-5617Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 55Hellmann-Blumberg U. Hintz M.F.M. Gatewood J.M. Schmid C.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4523-4530Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), methylation may partially account for transcriptional silencing. While complete CpG methylation is associated with a modest 2-3-fold decrease in Alu template activity in transient expression assays,3 3G. Humphrey, R. Vorce, E. W. Englander, and B. H. Howard, unpublished results. this effect may be enhanced in the context of chromatin (1Englander E.W. Wolffe A.P. Howard B.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19565-19573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 56Liu W.-M. Maraia R.J. Rubin C.M. Schmid C.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1087-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Chromatin proteins may also repress Alu repeats in part because the latter lack requisite sites that can effectively compete for stimulatory transcription factors. However, packaging by repressive chromatin proteins in a strictly random manner appears to be unlikely, since extraction of histone H1 from nuclei does not derepress Alu template activity.4 4V. Russanova and B. H. Howard, unpublished results. Taken together, these findings imply that more than one mechanism exists by which Alu repeats are maintained in a transcriptionally silent state. While the data presented in this study do not address Alu transcriptional regulation, they provide the first evidence for nucleosome positioning over Alu repeats in chromatin. As Alu repeats are transcriptionally quiescent in HeLa cells (and nucleosomes positioned over promoter elements are in many cases implicated in gene repression), it is reasonable to speculate that nucleosome positioning over the Alu A box promoter element might have a contributory role in Alu silencing. A second reason for characterizing the chromatin organization associated with Alu repeats relates to their potential effect on expression of adjacent genes (57Aronow B.J. Silbiger R.N. Dusing M.R.

Reynolds W. Oshima R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6742-6751Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). To the extent that Alu repeats confer rotational positioning over 5′-flanking sequences, their presence may influence access of regulatory proteins to cognate binding motifs within such sequences. While this notion is purely speculative, characterization of Alu-nucleosome interactions in vivo might be an important issue in studying the potential role of these sequences with regard to gene regulation. In situations where the presence of Alu repeats next to promoter/enhancer elements alters gene expression, it might be useful to consider the possibility that this effect is mediated at least in part by specific nucleosomal organization We thank Drs.

In addition, nonphosphorylated mCaMKIIα was a poor competitor for [32P]mCaMKIIα binding to p190. The competition data indicate that Ca2+/CaM-dependent autophosphorylation at Thr286promotes binding to p190, whereas, Ca2+/CaM-independent autophosphorylation at Thr306does not enhance binding.

We examined the effect of in vitro fatty acid supplementation on low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor activity in cultured cells and questioned whether changes were related to fatty acid-induced alterations in acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) activity. Preincubation of cultured cells (i.e. human skin fibroblasts, J774 macrophages, and HepG2 cells) with oleic acid (oleic acid:bovine serum albumin molar ratio 2:1) at 37°C for longer than 2 h resulted in a 1.2- to 1.5-fold increase in LDL cell binding at 4°C and LDL cell degradation at 37°C. Scatchard analysis showed that oleic acid increased LDL receptor number but not LDL affinity (Kd). Fatty acid supplementation of J774 macrophages increased both LDL receptor activity and cholesteryl ester accumulation. The ACAT inhibitor, 58-035, eliminated both effects, and increased ACAT activity preceded stimulation of LDL receptor activity by 1-2 h. Supplementation of macrophages with triolein emulsion particles also increased LDL cell binding and degradation, and addition of cholesterol to the emulsions abolished this effect. Among fatty acids tested, oleate (18:1), arachidonate (20:4), and eicosapentanoate (20:5) demonstrated the greatest effects.

In vitro experiments examining effects of fatty acid supplementation on LDL-cell interactions have yielded conflicting results. Previous work from this laboratory has shown that free fatty acids (FFA) at high FFA:bovine serum albumin (BSA) molar ratios (4-6:1) inhibit binding of LDL to the LDL receptor of human fibroblasts at 4°C (7Bihain B.E.

A similar effect has been reported in HepG2 cells (8Wong S. Nestel P.J.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 665: 632-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), mononuclear cells (11Loscalzo J. Freedman J. Rudd A.M. Barsky-Vasserman I. Vaughan D.E.

Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 6626-6632Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) have demonstrated increased LDL degradation following FFA supplementation. Exogenous cholesterol decreases both LDL receptor expression and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMG-CoA reductase) activity and up-regulates acyl CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) activity (14Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Science. 1986; 232: 34-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (4383) Google Scholar). Of interest, experiments in J774 macrophages showed that inhibition of ACAT activity with an ACAT inhibitor, 58-035, down-regulates LDL receptor activity, suggesting that there may also be a direct regulatory relationship between ACAT and the LDL receptor (15Tabas I. Weiland D.A. Tall A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 416-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In addition to cholesterol, ACAT activity can also be regulated by free fatty acids; for example, in vivo (16Mitropoulos K.A. Venkatesan S. Balasubramaniam S. Biochim. Biophys.

We therefore questioned whether in vitro supplementation of cultured cells with free fatty acids would increase cellular LDL receptor activity and, if so, would these changes be correlated with changes in cellular ACAT activity.

Our results demonstrate that cellular FFA supplementation in vitro can increase LDL receptor activity, and that this effect is mediated through modulation of cell ACAT activity and intracellular cholesterol redistribution. Sodium 125I was purchased from Amersham. Fatty acids, bovine serum albumin (Lot A-2153) with a fatty acid content of 0.11 mol of fatty acid/mol of albumin, disodium EDTA, trichloroacetic acid, and potassium iodide were obtained from Sigma. 10,000 mg/ml streptomycin, 200 mML-glutamine, and 100,000 units/ml penicillin were purchased from Hazelton. Normal human skin fibroblasts (HS68) and HepG2 cells were bought from American Tissue Culture Collection. Fibroblasts from familial hypercholesterolemia subjects lacking (GM 2000) or having a defect in the internalization of the LDL receptor (GM 2408, JD cells) were purchased from Coriell (Camden, NJ). J774 (A2) murine macrophages were kindly provided by Dr. Ira Tabas of Columbia University. Fibroblasts from frozen stocks (6-12 passages) were plated at a cell density of 24 × 103cells per well in 12-well plates (22 mm) in medium containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 1% glutamine (v/v), 1% penicillin/streptomycin (v/v), and 10% fetal bovine serum (v/v), which was replaced after 3 days. By the 5th day, fresh medium containing 10% (v/v) lipoprotein-deficient serum (d < 1.21 g/ml) was added to monolayers. Cells were used for experiments at day 7. Monolayer cultures of J774 cells were grown and maintained in the medium described above and plated at a cell density of 10 × 104. Twenty-four hours before experiments, the medium was changed to 10% (v/v) lipoprotein-deficient serum-containing medium. HepG2 cells were grown in collagen-coated tissue dishes in complete medium containing minimum essential medium with 0.1 mM nonessential amino acids, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 1% penicillin/streptomycin (v/v), and 10% fetal bovine serum.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 260: 212-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1185) Google Scholar). The specific activity of 125I-LDL ranged between 100 and 400 cpm/ng of LDL protein, and over 99% of the radioactivity was precipitable after a 60-min incubation with 10% (v/v) trichloroacetic acid at 4°C. LDL was dialyzed in 150 mM NaCl, 0.24 mM EDTA, pH 7.4, and then filtered with a 45-μm filter (Gelman Sciences). All isolated LDL were kept under argon at 4°C and used within 7 days. 50 mg of triolein or 25 mg of triolein and 25 mg of cholesterol oleate (Nu-Check) was added to 50 mg of egg yolk phosphatidylcholine (Avanti), and the organic solvents were completely evaporated under N2. Homogeneous IDL-size lipid emulsions were then prepared in 150 mM NaCl, 0.24 mM EDTA, 10% sucrose (w/v), pH 7.4 at 60°C, by sonification and ultracentrifugation, as previously detailed (25Schwiegelshohn B.

Emulsions were analyzed for triglycerides and total and free cholesterol (FC), as well as for phospholipid content. Triglycerides and total and free cholesterol were analyzed using Boehringer Mannheim Enzymatic Kits 877557, 290319, and 310378, respectively. Phospholipids were analyzed using the Bartlett assay (26Bartlett G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 466-468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ApoE emulsion complexes were prepared by adding 0.1 μg of recombinant apoE3 (Biotechnology General, Rehovot, Israel) to 1 μg of neutral lipid in the lipid emulsion. FFA were dissolved in 2-propanol (Fisher) to produce a concentrated solution (30.3-60.6 mM) which was added slowly to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing BSA (usually 1% w/v), at 37°C, below the surface-air interface to prevent surface dispersion of FFA. The total volume of propanol did not exceed 1% of the volume of DMEM, and propanol had no effect on any of the parameters measured. In some experiments, fatty acid was provided to cells in the form of triglyceride- and cholesteryl ester-containing emulsion particles. Cells were incubated with DMEM containing FFA at 37°C either in the absence (preincubation) or presence (co-incubation) of LDL at various FFA:BSA molar ratios ranging from 0.5:1 to 6:1. When cells were preincubated with FFA or triglyceride emulsions, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), 0.2% BSA (w/v) prior to the addition of radiolabeled LDL to remove non-cell-associated lipid. Cell binding of 125I-LDL to fibroblasts, J774 macrophages, and HepG2 cells at 4°C was measured in triplicate using established methods (27Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated for 2.5 h at 4°C in DMEM containing 125I-LDL, 25 mM HEPES, 1% BSA (w/v), pH 7.4. Afterwards, cells were washed with PBS, 0.2% BSA (w/v) five times, twice with PBS, solubilized in 0.1 N NaOH, and the total cell radioactivity was analyzed. Nonspecific binding was measured by the addition of a 30- to 50-fold excess of non-radiolabeled LDL. Specific binding was obtained by subtracting nonspecific bound from total bound 125I-LDL. Cellular binding, uptake, and degradation of 125I-LDL at 37°C was measured after 5 to 24 h of incubation in DMEM supplemented with 10% lipoprotein-deficient serum (LPDS) (27Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar). The medium was removed and cells were washed three times with PBS, 0.2% BSA and twice with PBS. At the end of the incubation, the media were collected and the LDL degradation was calculated as the difference between the amount of non-iodine, non-lipid, trichloroacetic acid-soluble radioactivity in the medium and the amount due to spontaneous degradation measured in parallel incubations in the absence of cells. Cell surface-bound LDL was determined as the amount of radioactivity displaced from the cells after a 60-min incubation at 4°C in a buffer containing 50 mM NaCl, 10 mM HEPES, 4 mg/ml dextran sulfate, pH 7.4. Internalized LDL was measured as the amount of radioactivity remaining associated with the cells after incubation with dextran sulfate buffer. Nonspecific binding uptake and degradation were determined in the presence of 30- to 50-fold excess non-radiolabeled LDL. LDL receptor mRNA of J774 macrophages was quantified by RNase protection assay, as described (28Rudling M. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 493-501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After incubation, cells were washed five times with PBS, 0.2% BSA, twice with PBS, and then cellular lipids were extracted for 4 h into hexane:isopropyl alcohol (3:2 v/v), as described (26Bartlett G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 466-468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using β-sitosterol (5 μg/ml) as an internal standard. Samples were split into two fractions to measure total and free cholesterol separately. To hydrolyze cellular cholesteryl esters (CE) prior to gas chromatography, 50% KOH (200 μl) and methanol (3 ml) were added to dried aliquots and heated to 75°C for 1 h in argon-capped tubes. After cooling, hexane (5 ml) and water (3 ml) were added. Samples were centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 5 min, and the supernatant containing cholesterol was removed and dried under N2. Cholesterol mass was measured by injection of 1-μl aliquots into a Hewlett Packard Model 5790A gas chromatograph with a Flame Ionization Detector equipped with a Hewlett Packard Model 7673A automatic sampler (Hewlett Packard Co.) using a 10 m × 0.53 mm × 0.88 μm cross-linked methyl silicone gum megapore column. Gas chromatography was performed at an isothermal temperature of 260°C, injection port temperature of 300°C, and detector temperature of 265°C with a N2carrier flow rate of 20 ml/min. Calibration was achieved by injection of a standard solution of cholesterol (100 μg/ml). Cellular cholesterol was labeled either by incubating cells with [3H]cholesterol/phospholipid liposomes (29Tabas I. Rosoff W.J. Boykow G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1266-1272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or by incubating the cells in the presence of [3H]mevalonolactone (30Rustan A.C. Nossen J.O. Osmundsin H. Drevon C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8126-8132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the first case, cell monolayers were incubated for 1 day with DMEM, 10% LPDS containing 1 μCi/ml of [3H]cholesterol/egg lecithin liposomes with concentrations of free cholesterol and phospholipid of 32 and 62.4 ng/ml, respectively. Following incubation, cells were washed twice with PBS, 0.2% BSA, prior to treatment with FFA. In experiments utilizing [3H]mevalonolactone to label newly synthesized cholesterol, cells were incubated in DMEM, 1% BSA (w/v) containing [3H]mevalonolactone (1 μCi/ml, 0.061 nmol/ml) for 1 h prior to the addition of FFA as well as during FFA supplementation. In both cases, after cholesterol labeling, cells were incubated at 37°C with oleic acid (FFA:BSA molar ratio 2:1) for up to 4 h, and cellular lipids were extracted with hexane/isopropyl alcohol (3:2 v/v). Free cholesterol and cholesteryl ester were then separated by thin layer chromatography in a solvent mixture of hexane:diethyl ether:acetic acid (70:30:1, v/v/v), and the radioactivity of each fraction was measured. Squalene was separated from cholesterol by an initial TLC run in the above solvent system up to 4 cm from the top of the plate, followed by a second run using hexane to the top of the plate (30Rustan A.C. Nossen J.O. Osmundsin H. Drevon C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8126-8132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Differences between group mean values were compared by two-tailed Student's t test or analysis of variance, when appropriate. Human fibroblasts and J774 macrophages, which had been previously incubated with lipoprotein-deficient serum (LPDS) to up-regulate the LDL receptor, were incubated with LDL with or without oleic acid (FFA:BSA molar ratio 2:1, 0.303 mM) for 5 h or 24 h at 37°C (Fig. 1). Compared to control cells at 24 h (Fig. 1, right), oleic acid supplementation increased LDL receptor binding by 60% in both cells (p < 0.001), LDL internalization by 50% (p < 0.05) in fibroblasts and 30% (p < 0.01) in macrophages, and LDL degradation by 20% and 30% (p < 0.06, p < 0.01) in fibroblasts and macrophages, respectively. At 5 h, less marked effects of oleic acid supplementation were observed on specific LDL binding and internalization via the LDL receptor in fibroblasts (p < 0.05) and in macrophages (p < 0.01) but with little early changes in LDL cell degradation in either cell type (Fig. 1, left). Similar incubations using octanoic acid resulted in no alterations in LDL binding, uptake, or degradation at either time period (data not shown). Nonspecific binding was found to change very little (less than 10% of net increase in total binding) in response to oleic acid. To determine whether there was an FFA dose-dependent effect in LDL cell binding, internalization, and degradation, up-regulated fibroblasts were incubated at 37°C with 125I-LDL and oleic acid at varying FFA:BSA molar ratios (1-6:1, 0.15-0.9 mM FFA) for 5 or 24 h (Fig. 2). After 5 h and 24 h of incubation, maximal increases in LDL surface binding and internalization of up to 20% (p < 0.01) occurred at the lower FFA:BSA molar ratios (<2:1), whereas after 5 h, but not after 24 h, of incubation, higher FFA:BSA molar ratios (6:1) decreased LDL binding and internalization up to 60%. After 24 h of incubation, a FFA:BSA molar ratio of 6:1 did not inhibit LDL cell binding or internalization, but degradation was decreased by 20%. Therefore, depending on the FFA:BSA molar ratio, co-incubation of fatty acids with LDL may have either a stimulatory or inhibitory effect on LDL metabolism in vitro. To test whether the effect of oleic acid on LDL metabolism was dependent on its presence in the media and perhaps the LDL particle, or was instead dependent on cellular mechanisms, up-regulated fibroblasts and J774 macrophages were first preincubated with oleic acid (FFA:BSA molar ratio 2:1) for varying lengths of time. Then, the cells were washed and specific LDL binding to the cell surface was assessed at 4°C, after oleate removal (Fig. 3). Increases of 20-40% in LDL specifically bound to the cell surface occurred only after 1 to 2 h of FFA preincubation with longer preincubation times (up to 24 h) resulting in increases of up to 50%. Fibroblasts appeared to respond to shorter oleic acid preincubation times than macrophages, but after 4 h of FFA incubation, the increase in cell surface binding was similar in both cell lines. Since increased LDL cell binding and degradation can be caused by increases in LDL receptor number on the cell surface or by increased affinity of the LDL receptor for its ligand, we next tested the effect of preincubation with oleic acid on the kinetics of LDL cell binding at 4°C in both fibroblasts and J774 macrophages (Fig. 4). Cells preincubated with oleic acid had a 35% and 25% increase in maximal specific LDL binding in fibroblasts and macrophages, respectively, with no significant alteration in receptor affinity (Fig. 4, insets). These data indicate that the increased LDL cell binding is due to an increase in the number of LDL receptors available at the cell surface. To ascertain if the effect of FFA on LDL cell binding was exclusively mediated via the LDL receptor or if other cell pathways might also contribute, experiments were performed in LDL receptor-negative fibroblasts (data not shown). Preincubation of these cells with oleic acid at different FFA:BSA molar ratios (0.5:1 to 4:1) resulted in no changes in total LDL cell surface binding at 4°C at ratios of <2:1 and up to a 25% decrease in LDL 4°C binding and degradation at 37°C at higher ratios. These results further suggested that the effects of FFA on increasing LDL binding to the cell surface were mediated through the LDL receptor. The effect of oleic acid on 125I-acetylated LDL metabolism in J774 macrophages was also studied, and no alterations in cell binding or degradation of modified LDL were found (data not shown), suggesting that oleic acid has no effect on the activity of the scavenger receptor in this cell line. To determine if the FFA-mediated increase in cell LDL binding was due to an increase in the cellular recycling of the LDL receptor, we compared the effect of oleic acid on normal fibroblasts and JD receptor-defective fibroblasts (Fig. 5). JD cells express LDL receptors on the cell surface, but fail to internalize receptor-bound LDL (14Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Science. 1986; 232: 34-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (4383) Google Scholar). Normal and JD fibroblasts were preincubated with oleic acid for 4 h, the FFA was removed as described above, and 125I-LDL was bound to the cell surface at 4°C. The cells were then washed to eliminate excess 125I-LDL and warmed to 37°C to follow the fate of the surface-bound LDL. At 4°C, compared with unsupplemented control cells, cells preincubated with oleic acid had 38% and 37% more LDL bound to the cell surface in normal and JD fibroblasts, respectively (Fig. 5 A). After warming at 37°C for 2 h, normal cells treated with oleic acid degraded 40% more LDL than untreated cells. JD cells, however, despite the initially increased cell surface-bound LDL after oleic acid treatment, degraded 13% less LDL than control JD cells, not treated with oleic acid (Fig. 5 B). Therefore, receptor internalization is not required for oleic acid to increase LDL binding at the cell surface, but is required for additionally bound LDL to be metabolized. To investigate whether the increase in maximal binding was due to increased synthesis of the LDL receptor mRNA, mRNA was quantified using an RNase protection assay, and differences due to FFA were not detected (data not shown). Experiments in both fibroblasts and macrophages demonstrated that the addition of a protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide (10 μg/ml), 30 min prior and throughout oleic acid supplementation, abolished the increase in cell surface LDL binding at 4°C. Similar incubations with the mRNA synthesis inhibitor, actinomycin D, showed no effect (data not shown), suggesting that FFA affected the LDL receptor by a post-translation pathway. To probe further whether FFA-mediated increases in LDL receptor activity were associated with changes in cellular cholesterol homeostasis, we compared the effects of oleic acid on LDL cell binding at 4°C in non-up-regulated and up-regulated fibroblasts. Cells were either grown continuously in medium containing 10% calf serum to suppress the LDL receptor (non-up-regulated) or in medium containing 10% lipoprotein-deficient serum for 2 days to up-regulate the LDL receptor (up-regulated). Cells were then preincubated for 4 h with oleic acid and washed, and, then, 125I-LDL binding to the cell surface was measured at 4°C. In both cell preparations, oleic acid increased LDL binding to the cell surface, but, compared to cells incubated in absence of oleic acid, up-regulated cells demonstrated a greater increase in LDL binding than non-up-regulated cells (30.7 ± 3.2 versus 19.3 ± 4.7 ng of LDL/mg of cell protein, respectively). This suggests that relative depletion of cellular cholesterol by incubation in lipoprotein-deficient serum makes the cell more sensitive to the effects of FFA, and that the effect of FFA may still occur despite the LDL receptor down-regulation induced by 10% calf serum on cultured cells. We next questioned whether the effects of different FFA on the LDL receptor parallel changes in cell cholesterol distribution between free cholesterol (FC) and cholesteryl ester (CE). J774 macrophages were incubated in parallel experiments with different FFA (FFA:BSA molar ratio 2:1) in the presence of 100 μg/ml radiolabeled or non-radiolabeled LDL to measure both LDL degradation and cellular cholesterol distribution expressed as CE/FC mass ratio (Fig. 6). In the presence of 100 μg/ml LDL, free cholesterol mass remained essentially constant while cell total cholesterol and the CE/FC ratio increased. Levels of FC were similar for all cells regardless of FFA supplementation, and there was no correlation between the amount of LDL degraded and cell FC (data not shown). In contrast, a high correlation was seen between the ability of the FFA to increase LDL catabolism and either the amount of cholesteryl ester accumulation (r2= 0.85) or the CE/FC ratio (r2= 0.78) after the 18-h incubation. For example, as compared to control, cholesteryl ester mass and the CE/FC ratio both increased by over 1.5-fold in the presence of oleic acid. Incubation of cells with fatty acids without LDL resulted in no changes in total cellular cholesterol mass. Unsaturated fatty acids had the most marked effect on LDL degradation and on changing cell cholesterol distribution between free cholesterol and cholesteryl ester. Saturated fatty acids had less effect, and short chain fatty acids had no effects. Myristic acid was not included in Fig. 6 because in different experiments it produced variable and inconsistent results. It has been previously reported that unsaturated FFA increase ACAT activity in J774 macrophages (20McCloskey H.M. Glick J.M. Ross A.C. Rothblat G.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 963: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), and in vivo studies suggest that, in the liver, FFA may regulate LDL receptor acti"

Transglutaminases are enzymes that catalyze the covalent cross-linking of proteins by promoting the formation of ∊-(γ-glutamyl)-lysine isopeptide bonds between selected protein-bound glutamine and lysine residue (1Folk J.E.

Transglutaminase activity has been detected in a variety of tissues and body fluids. It was originally thought that this activity was due to a single transglutaminase enzyme, but it is now clear that transglutaminase activity can be due to a family of related but distinct enzymes differing in their pattern of expression, their substrate specificity, and their physiological regulation (4Aeschlimann D. Paulsson M. Thrombo. Hemostasis. 1994; 71: 402-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). Some transglutaminases, such as Factor XIII and seminal plasma transglutaminase, are extracellular enzymes involved in the cross-linking of aggregated plasma proteins. Other transglutaminases, such as keratinocyte and epidermal transglutaminases, are intracellular enzymes involved in cross-linking of intracellular proteins during the terminal differentiation and cornification of skin cells (5Rice R.H. Green H. J. Cell Biol. 1978; 76: 705-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 6Thacher S.M. Rice R.H. Cell. 1985; 40: 685-695Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Tissue transglutaminase is a member of this multigene family that is involved in the cross-linking of both intracellular and extracellular proteins. Tissue transglutaminase can be secreted from cells and accumulated in the extracellular matrix (7Slife C.W. Dorsett M.D. Tillotson M.L. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 463-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Although the physiological functions of this secreted tissue transglutaminase are not well understood, it may be involved in the specialized processing of the matrix that occurs during bone formation (12Aeschlimann D. Wetterwald A. Fleisch H. Paulsson M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1461-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), wound healing (13Upchurch H.F. Conway E. Patterson M.K. Maxwell M.D. J. Cell. Physiol. 1991; 149: 375-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), and other remodeling processes. Tissue transglutaminase also appears to be involved in the cross-linking of intracellular protein. Fesus and Thomazy (14Fesus L. Thomazy V. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1988; 231: 119-134PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that tissue transglutaminase accumulates in cells undergoing apoptotic cell death. Activation of the enzyme during apoptosis causes the cross-linking of intracellular proteins that, in some cells, may be an integral part of the apoptotic program (15Fesus L. Immunol. Today. 1992; 13: A16-A17Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Our laboratory has been interested in the factors that regulate the expression of tissue transglutaminase especially during the process of programmed cell death. Previous studies have demonstrated that retinoids act as direct regulators of tissue transglutaminase gene expression, an effect frequently potentiated by cAMP (16Murtaugh M.P. Arend W.P. Davies P.J.A. J. Exp. Med. 1984; 159: 114-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 17Antonio Chiocca E. Davies P.J.A. Stein J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11584-11589PubMed Google Scholar).

MCF-7 (human breast cancer), SW13 cells (human adrenal adenocarcinoma), and Hela cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone Laboratories Inc., Logan, UT) at 37°C in 5% CO2incubator. γ3T3 cells, a Balb/c 3T3 cell line stably transfected with mouse retinoic acid receptor γ (RARγ), were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 5% serum plus™(JRH Biosciences, Lenexa, KS), and 200 μg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.). Luciferase vectors pXP1-Luc, pXP2-Luc, and pSV2-AL-Luc were kindly provided by Dr. Debbie Wilson, Dept. of Pathology, Texas Children Hospital, Houston (20Nordeen S.K. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 454-456PubMed Google Scholar). An amplified human placental genomic DNA library in Lambda Fix™vector (Stratagene Inc., La Jolla, CA) was screened with a 440-bp radiolabeled cDNA probe derived from 5′-end of a human tissue transglutaminase cDNA (λhTg-1). Escherichia coli cells (LE392) were infected with recombinant phage, and 1.2 × 106phage plaques were screened. Thirteen clones were obtained after tertiary screening and rescreened with three oligonucleotide probes whose sequences were derived from different segments of the 5′ region of the tissue transglutaminase cDNA. Southern blot analysis of the genomic library by both cDNA and oligonucleotide probes was performed according to the previously described methods. Restriction enzyme mapping of transglutaminase genomic DNA clones was carried out using standard procedures (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). DNA flanking the human tissue transglutaminase gene was subcloned into a pSuperlinker 301 vector (Invitrogen Corp., San Diego, CA) for sequencing. Plasmids were sequenced with either T7 or T3 oligonucleotide primers using an automated Taq DyeDeoxy™Terminator Cycling sequencing method (Applied Biosystems, Inc., Foster City, CA). Overlapping sequences from 29 fragments of DNA were aligned using the GCG Gelassembly sequence analysis program. A 4-kb HindIII fragment that included 1.74 kb of DNA upstream of the translation start site of the human tissue transglutaminase gene was subcloned into the HindIII site of both pXP1-Luc and pXP2-Luc vectors. The segment of the human tissue transglutaminase genomic DNA downstream of the translation start site was then deleted by excising a 2.2-kb NcoI/ SalI fragment from both pXP1-Tg-Luc and pXP2-Tg-Luc. These vectors were religated to give constructs HTGP1-Luc and HTGP2-Luc, in which 1.74 kb of the human tissue transglutaminase were inserted in sense (HTGP2-Luc) or antisense (HTGP1-Luc) orientation upstream of the luciferase gene. The deletion mutation constructs HTGP2-mut2-Luc, HTGP2-mut3-Luc, HTGP2-mut5-Luc, HTGP2-mut6-Luc, HTGP2-mut7-Luc, pXP2-TG-Luc, and pXP2-ΔCAAT-Luc were generated by deleting specific DNA fragments according to the restriction map shown in Fig. 5 A. The construct pXP2-Δ5P1-Luc was made by subcloning the PCR fragment spanning the human tissue transglutaminase sequence −40 to +59 bp into the pXP2-Luc vector. The construct pXP2-ΔNF1-Luc was made by subcloning a 39-mer oligonucleotide spanning the human tissue transglutaminase gene −32 to +5 bp into the pXP2-Luc vector. Lipofectin-mediated transfection was used for the transient transfection assays. Lipofectin reagent+DNA complex was prepared according to the protocol provided by Life Technologies, Inc. Briefly, plasmid DNA in serum-free DMEM at 10 μg/ml was mixed with the same volume of Lipofectin reagent solution (100 μl/ml Lipofectin reagent in serum-free DMEM). The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 10-15 min allowing the formation of Lipofectin reagent+DNA complex. The complex was then mixed with fresh serum-free DMEM at 1:4 (v/v) and was used immediately. Cells to be transfected were plated in a 35-mm tissue culture dish at a density of 2 × 105cells/plate in 2 ml of DMEM supplemented with serum. Twenty-four h later, the cells were washed twice with 2 ml of serum-free DMEM. The cells were then incubated with the Lipofectin reagent+DNA complex (0.2 ml/plate) for 10 h at 37°C in 5% CO2. The reaction was stopped by replacing the DNA complex-containing DMEM with DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum and 5% serum plus. Cells in 35-mm plates were washed twice with PBS. After 5 min of incubation with cell lysis buffer (25 mM Tris-phosphate, pH 7.8, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 2 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100), the cells were scraped with a rubber policeman. The samples were then centrifuged at 4°C for 5 min, and the supernatants were transferred to fresh vials. The protein concentration of each sample was determined before the assay of luciferase activity. Luciferase assays were performed in a Monolight 2010 Luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory, San Diego, CA). For each assay, cell extract (40 μl) was added into a cuvette, and the reaction started by injection of 200 μl of substrate buffer (27 mM KH2PO4/K2HPO4,pH 7.8, 42 mM MgSO4, 11.2 mM EDTA, 70 mM glycylglycine, 4 mM dithiothreitol, 3.6 mM ATP, 0.4 mM Luciferin) to the cuvette. Each reaction was measured for 10 s in the Luminometer. Luciferase activity was defined as light units/mg protein. β-Gal activity was determined using o-nitrophenyl-β-Dgalactopyranoside as substrate. The reaction was measured at 420 nm according to a standardized protocol (Promega). A 440-bp cDNA probe was used to screen a human placental genomic DNA library. The 440 EcoRI/ PstI fragment was purified from the 5′-end cDNA of the human tissue transglutaminase clone λhTg-1 (22Gentile V. Saydak M. Chiocca E.A. Akande O. Birckbichler P.J. Lee K.N. Stein J.P.

Thirteen clones were obtained after screening 2 × 106phage plaques. Oligonucleotide probe AS-140, spanning the translation start site, of the human tissue transglutaminase gene, was used to rescreen the positive clones. We found that all the clones hybridized to the oligonucleotide probe, suggesting that the clones span the 5′-end of the human tissue transglutaminase gene. Several of these clones were subjected to more detailed analysis. Fig. 1 shows the restriction map of a 17-kb XhoI fragment of human genomic DNA. Oligo AS-200 is located 60 bp downstream of the initiator ATG codon in the human tissue transglutaminase cDNA and oligo AS-460 is 320 bp downstream of initiator ATG in the cDNA. Southern blot and restriction mapping analysis demonstrated that oligo AS-200 is approximately 6 kb downstream from oligo AS140 in the genomic DNA, indicating the presence of at least one intron. Oligo AS-460 is about 8 kb downstream in the genomic DNA, indicating that further introns separate the cDNA sequences that hybridize to these oligonucleotide probes. Sequence analysis and restriction mapping were used to define precisely the number of introns and the intron-exon boundaries in the 5′-end of the human tissue transglutaminase gene (Fig. 2). As demonstrated in Fig. 2, the initiator ATG codon is included within exon 1. The first intron-exon boundary is within codon 4. The intron 1 is large, 6.1 kb. There is a second intron-exon boundary within codon 64. The second intron is 2.6 kb. The third intron starts within codon 145. The size of this third intron and the structure of the 3′-end of the gene remain to be determined.Figure 2:Organization of the human tissue transglutaminase gene.

Overlapping DNA fragments were used to deduce the sequence of 1.74-kb DNA flanking the 5′-end of the human tissue transglutaminase gene (Fig. 3, A and B). The presumptive cap site is 24 nucleotides downstream from TATA box. The GCAG sequence in this position is identical to the sequence spanning the cap site in both guinea pig (23Suto N. Ikura K.

Davies, unpublished observation. tissue transglutaminase promoters. Upstream of the TATA box is a potential CAAT box with an intervening GC-rich region (Fig. 3 B). Four SP1 sites (CCGCCC) were found in the proximal promoter region. Two of them are located between the TATA box and the CAAT box, and the other two SP1 sites are located within the 5′-untranslated region (5′-UTR). Four 3′ half-sites of NF1 element (CGCCAG) were also found within the 5′-UTR (24Chang T.S. Shapiro D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8176-8182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We searched the 1.74 kb upstream DNA segment with the consensus sequences of several well-characterized transcription factor-binding sites and hormone response elements. A potential glucocorticoid response element (TGTACAGCTTGTTCT), IL-6 response element (IL-6-RE, CTGGAAA), transcription factor AP1-binding site (AP1 site, TGTGTCAG), transcription factor AP2-binding site (AP2 site, CCCCAGGG)-like sequences were found (indicated by stippled bars in Fig. 3 B). No consensus sequences for retinoid receptor binding (i.e. RARE, AGGTCAnnnnnAGGTCA or RXRE, AGGTCAnAGGTCA) were found in the sequence. Recently, Ikura et al. (25Ikura K. Nasu T. Yokota H. Tsuchiya Y. Sasaki R. Chiba H. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 2898-2905Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) have reported the DNA sequence upstream of the guinea pig tissue transglutaminase gene. The cDNA sequences of the human and guinea pig tissue transglutaminase are conserved (76% identity; 22). The upstream sequence shows a much lower degree of homology (overall 42% identity), and this homology is concentrated in isolated islands of sequence identity. The proximal promoter region, including the TATA box, SP1 sites, and the CAAT box, is conserved between the human and guinea pig tissue transglutaminase gene (Fig. 4 A; 20). Upstream of the core promoter region in both the guinea pig and human tissue transglutaminase promoters, there is a region highly enriched in alternating pyrimidine/purine dinucleotide pairs (dTdG-rich region). Between −350 and −500 bp in the human tissue transglutaminase promoter, the frequency of dTdG dinucleotide pairs ranges from 20-30% (the predicted frequency due to random pairing would be 6%) (Fig. 4 B). This same region includes several extended tracks of dTdG repeats spanning the −402- to −451-bp region. A similar dTdG-rich region can be identified in the guinea pig tissue transglutaminase promoter approximately 300 bp upstream of the cap site. A very purine-rich region (comprised of dAdG dinucleotide pairs) is located in the human gene at the position of −900∼-1165 bp. This region contains multiple repeats of a GGATGG motif (Fig. 3 B). Double GGATGG motifs are found in the corresponding region of the guinea pig gene. However, the biological function of this element remains to be determined. It appears that there are isolated islands of very repetitive DNA conserved in both human and guinea pig transglutaminase promoters. The structural and functional significance of these regions of DNA are not clear. The promoter function of the human tissue transglutaminase gene was determined by transient transfection of recombinant reporter genes into cultured cell lines. Reporter genes were constructed by cloning the 1.74-kb HindIII/ NcoI fragment of the human tissue transglutaminase 5′-flanking DNA into a luciferase reporter vector at a position immediately upstream of luciferase gene. γ3T3 cells, a Balb/c 3T3 cell line stably transfected with a mouse RARγ expression vector, were used for these experiments. Cells, transfected with HTGP1-Luc, which contained the 1.74-kb DNA in the antisense orientation, showed a low level of luciferase activity, similar to that in non-transfected cells (Fig. 5). Cells transfected with the recombinant construct HTGP2-Luc containing the same 1.74-kb DNA in the sense orientation had significant luciferase activity. The level of luciferase activity is about 25% of that detected in cells transfected with the same amount of the pSV2-AL-Luc plasmid DNA, a control vector in which the luciferase gene is placed under control of the SV40 early promoter. The full 1.74-kb human tissue transglutaminase promoter had a high level of basal expression. To determine the regions of the gene responsible for this constitutive activity, we deleted segments of the promoter from the HTGP2-Luc reporter vector and then measured the activity of the truncated constructs by transient transfection in the γ3T3 cells. The intact HTGP2-Luc vector had a high level of constitutive activity. This activity was completely dependent on the core promoter since HTGP2-mut5-Luc, in which the core tissue transglutaminase promoter sequences were deleted, showed very little transcriptional activity (Fig. 5). Progressive deletion of the 5′-end of the human tissue transglutaminase promoter had no adverse effect on basal activity. HTGP2-mut2-Luc and HTGP2-mut3-luc are constructs in which either 0.64 or 1.1 kb, respectively, of the 5′-end of the promoter were deleted. These deletions included removal of part (HTGP2-mut2-Luc) or all (HTGP2-mut3-Luc) of the purine dinucleotide-rich region as well as the consensus glucocorticoid response elements, IL-6-RE, and AP1 elements. In spite of the removal of 65% of the 1.74-kb human tissue transglutaminase promoter, there was no decrease in the constitutive transcriptional activity of the promoter-reporter construct. The preceding studies indicated that the high constitutive activity of the human tissue transglutaminase promoter depended on the proximal promoter region. This region included the dTdG-rich region and a consensus AP2 site. To test the activity of these elements, a construct HTGP2-mut6-Luc was prepared in which a segment of the promoter spanning the dTdG-rich region and AP2 site was deleted. Removal of this region resulted in no loss of basal activity (Fig. 5). Finally, we deleted the segment of the core promoter sequence upstream of the SP1 sites in the proximal GC-rich region of the promoter (HTGP2-mut7-Luc). This construct again had high basal transcriptional activity. These studies suggest that the high constitutive transcriptional activity of the human tissue transglutaminase promoter depends only on the core promoter sequences (TATA box, four SP1 sites, and four potential NF1 sites) located in the 134 bp upstream of the translation start site. To identify the contribution of the core promoter regulatory elements, a series of reporter genes was constructed in which fragments of the core tissue transglutaminase promoter were inserted upstream of the luciferase gene (Fig. 6). The intact core promoter (entire 5′-UTR, TATA box, SP1 sites, and CAAT box) was included in the pXP2-TG-Luc construct (−122 to +72). This construct, when transfected into SW13 cells, showed the same high constitutive activity as the other reporter constructs that contained more of the upstream sequences. Removal of the CAAT box from this construct (pXP2-ΔCAAT-Luc) resulted in a significant decrease in the transcriptional activity of the promoter. However, the residual promoter still showed significant constitutive activity suggesting that the CAAT box element was functional and enhanced the activity of the core promoter. Removal of the four SP1 sites (pXP2-ΔSP1-Luc) resulted in a marked decrease in the transcriptional activity of the core promoter. The residual activity in this construct was only 8-fold more active than the “promoterless” control vector (pXP2-Luc). Deletion of the 5′-UTR (pXP2-ΔNF1-Luc) that included the putative NF1-binding sites resulted in even less basal activity. These studies suggested that the high level of constitutive activity of the tissue transglutaminase promoter was attributable to the four SP1 sites that flank the TATA box element. The presence of a functional CAAT box element also contributed to this high level of basal transcriptional activity. The potential NF1 sites at the 5′-UTR showed a weak activity. Tissue transglutaminase is expressed in a very cell- and tissue-specific manner. To determine if the tissue transglutaminase promoter shows comparable specificity, we compared the activity of the 1.74-kb human tissue transglutaminase promoter-reporter (HTGP2-Luc) construct (measured as fold increase over the activity of a control HTGP2-mut5-Luc plasmid) with the basal level of endogenous transglutaminase activity (Table I). In all the cell lines tested, the full promoter construct HTGP2-Luc was 30 ∼ 60-fold more active than the control vector. This relative activity was independent of the basal level of transglutaminase activity, suggesting that cell type-specific regulation of the endogenous promoter is not reflected in the activity of the 1.74-kb promoter fragment.Table I:Constitutive activity of the human tissue transglutaminase promoter in SW13, γ3T3, MCF-7, and Hela cells Open table in a new tab Retinoic acid (1 μM) can increase the tissue transglutaminase activity of γ3T3 cells 5-fold; however, there was no retinoid-dependent induction of luciferase activity following transfection of HTGP2-Luc into γ3T3 cells. This observation suggested that the retinoic acid regulatory elements of the human tissue transglutaminase gene are not located within the 1.74-kb 5′-flanking DNA fragment we had cloned. The goal of this study has been to identify the functional elements associated with the DNA sequences upstream of the human tissue transglutaminase transcription unit. To address this issue we have isolated and characterized the 5′-end of the human tissue transglutaminase gene and have analyzed its activity in transfected cells. These studies have provided novel insights into both the structural and functional aspects of the human tissue transglutaminase gene. Transglutaminases are a family of enzymes that share the same basic enzymatic activity, but whose members are adapted to a number of specialized functions. The organization of the genes for these transglutaminases (and transglutaminase-like proteins) reflects both their conserved enzymatic activity and their specialized functional attributes. All the transglutaminases share a highly conserved active site sequence that flanks the reactive cysteine and histidine residues critical to their enzymatic activity (in band 4.2 the cysteine is replaced with an alanine and histidine is replaced with a glutamine but the organization of the flanking sequences is preserved). Although there is considerable sequence divergence in other regions of the molecules, the overall organization of exons and introns within the transglutaminase genes is strikingly conserved (28Phillips M.A. Stewart B.E.

The genes for Factor XIIIa, keratinocyte transglutaminase, and erythrocyte band 4.2 have similar-sized exons encoding homologous segments of the proteins (26Ichinose A. Davie E.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5829-5833Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 27Yamanishi K. Inazawa J. Liew F.M. Nonomura K. Ariyama T. Yasuno H. Abe T. Doi H. Hirano J. Fukushima S. J. Biol.

Fig. 7 compares the structure of the 5′-end of the human tissue transglutaminase gene with the corresponding region of several other human transglutaminase genes that have recently been reported in the literature. In all four genes, the two distal exons (exons II and III for tissue transglutaminase and band 4.2, exons III and IV for keratinocyte transglutaminase and Factor XIIIa) are of similar in size and show significant sequence homology. These exons represent the 5′-end of the core structural unit conserved among the different members of the transglutaminase multigene family, and it is clear that tissue transglutaminase preserves this structural motif. The diversity in the members of the transglutaminase gene family is reflected in the diversity in the organization of the 5′-ends of the genes for these enzymes. As can be seen in Fig. 7, the tissue transglutaminase gene appears to represent the simplest member of this series. In this gene the entire 5′-untranslated region, the translation start site, and the first four codons are included in a single exon (exon I). This exon is juxtaposed directly to the core transglutaminase sequence represented by exon II. This simple gene structure suggests that tissue transglutaminase may be the simplest of the transglutaminase enzymes. Tissue transglutaminase is a ubiquitous enzyme, expressed in many cells and tissues. It is also a cytosolic enzyme that does not associate with specific subcellular compartments. Furthermore, it is translated as a fully active enzyme, and there is no evidence of proteolytic activation for this transglutaminase. There appear to be no specific regulatory functions associated with the amino terminus of the protein and therefore no specialized functional domains associated with the 5′-end of the tissue transglutaminase gene. The structure and the function of the other transglutaminases is considerably more complex. Erythrocyte band 4.2 actually includes two polypeptides generated by alternative splicing of the primary transcript (30Korsgren C. Cohen C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4840-4844Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 31Sung L.A. Chien S. Fan Y.S. Lin C.C. Lambert K. Zhu L.Y. Lam J.S. Chang L.S. Blood. 1992; 79: 2763-2770Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This heterogeneity is derived from the use of alternative splice sites within exon I. The structure of the 5′-end of the keratinocyte and Factor XIIIa genes are also complex. In both genes, the first exon contains only untranslated sequences. The translation start site is embedded in the second exon (26Ichinose A. Davie E.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5829-5833Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 27Yamanishi K. Inazawa J. Liew F.M. Nonomura K. Ariyama T. Yasuno H. Abe T. Doi H. Hirano J. Fukushima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17858-17863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Phillips M.A. Stewart B.E. Qin Q. Chakravarty R. Floyd E.E. Jetten A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In the human keratinocyte transglutaminase gene, this second exon is large, encoding a long polypeptide sequence that directs the myristylation of the amino-terminal end of the molecule (32Phillips M.A. Qin Q. Mehrpouyan M. Rice R.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11057-11063Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In Factor XIIIa, the second exon encodes a thrombin-sensitive peptide bond (33Grundmann U. Amann E. Zettlmeissl G. Kupper H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8024-8028Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 34Ichinose A. Hendrickson L.E. Fujikawa K. Davie E.W. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 6900-6906Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 35Takahashi N. Takahashi Y. Putnam F.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8019-8023Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Thus in both genes, the second exon encodes function that gives the particular enzymes their distinctive regulatory properties. It has been speculated that the introduction of specialized functions into the primordial transglutaminase gene occurred by the apposition of exons encoding specific activities (i.e. susceptibility to myristylation, thrombin activation, etc.) to the 5′-end of the gene. Comparison of the gene structures shown in Fig. 7 suggests that such diversity might have arisen from replacement of the simple first exon structure in the tissue transglutaminase gene with a variety of more complex structural motifs. Introduction of alternative splicing sites, membrane-anchoring domains, or proteolytic activation domains could have contributed to the generation of a multigene family of similar enzymes with diverse and specialized regulatory functions. The diversity in the transglutaminase gene family is not restricted to the organization of the 5′-exon-intron boundaries but also extends upstream into the promoter sequences as well. Tissue transglutaminase appears to have a typical type II promoter structure; there is a well-defined TATA box element located 24 nucleotide upstream from a canonical cap site. The promoter includes an extensive GC-rich region upstream from the TATA box element that encodes at least two consensus SP1-binding sites, and located further upstream is a canonical CAAT box element (Fig. 3 B). The keratinocyte transglutaminase also has a TATA box-like motif (ATAAA) upstream of the cap site, and this gene also contains two SP1 sites. These sites are, however, located considerable further upstream of the TATA box element than the SP1 sites, are in the human tissue transglutaminase gene. The keratinocyte transglutaminase promoter also lacks a putative CAAT box element (27Yamanishi K. Inazawa J. Liew F.M. Nonomura K. Ariyama T. Yasuno H. Abe T. Doi H. Hirano J. Fukushima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17858-17863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Phillips M.A. Stewart B.E. Rice R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2282-2286Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The band 4.2 promoter has a TATA box-like element located upstream of the putative cap site, but this promoter lacks a clearly defined GC-rich region or consensus SP1 sites (30Korsgren C. Cohen C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4840-4844Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The Factor XIIIa subunit promoter is a TATA box-less promoter that lacks both TATA box element or clearly defined SP1-binding sites (26Ichinose A. Davie E.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5829-5833Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The differences among the structures of the promoters for the members of the transglutaminase gene family argue against the suggestion that the 5′-exons were mere inserted downstream from a core transglutaminase promoter sequenced. The diversity suggests rather that key regulatory sequences and promoter elements were appended upstream of the core transglutaminase gene to generate a family of enzymes with divergent transcriptional control as well as unique structural and regulatory features. Tissue transglutaminase is expressed in cells and tissues in a highly regulated manner. Many cells, such as endothelial cells, vascular smooth muscle cells, platelets, and epithelial cells of the lens, express the enzyme constitutively and accumulate high levels of active enzyme (3Greenberg C.S. Birckbichler P.J. Rice R.H. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 3071-3077Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar). In other cells, such as monocytes and tissue macrophages, the enzyme is inducible (16Murtaugh M.P. Arend W.P. Davies P.J.A. J. Exp. Med. 1984; 159: 114-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 17Antonio Chiocca E. Davies P.J.A. Stein J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11584-11589PubMed Google Scholar, 36Moore W.T. Michael P. Murtaugh M.P. Davies P.J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12794-12802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Basal expression of the enzyme is very low, but the enzyme is dramatically induced following exposure to an inflammatory stimulus. In a few cells, particularly neurons and skeletal muscle cells, tissue transglutaminase expression is very low and very little active enzyme accumulates in these cells under normal conditions. These cells, and many other cells, do accumulate high levels of the enzyme if they enter into the pathway of programmed cell death. In view of the evidence for the tight physiological control of tissue transglutaminase expression in vivo, it was surprising to us to discover that the tissue transglutaminase core promoter is constitutively active in many different cell types. This high level of basal activity appears to be attributable to the presence of a CAAT box as well as the four SP1 sites, two located directly upstream of the TATA box element and the other two at the 5′-UTR. This strong constitutive activity is not unique to the human tissue transglutaminase promoter. Ikura et al. (23Suto N. Ikura K. Shinagawa R. Sasaki R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1172: 319-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) have reported that the guinea pig tissue transglutaminase promoter, which shows similar transcription factor-binding sites, also shows strong constitutive activity. The presence of a constitutively active promoter in a gene subject to complex regulation suggests that important negative or tissue-specific regulatory elements must control the activity of this gene in many cells and tissues. Further analysis of the human transglutaminase gene will be required to identify and characterize the cis-regulatory regions that are responsible for the cell- and tissue-specific gene expression. The rapid increase in the expression of the enzyme that occurs in many cells undergoing programmed cell death may not be due to a specific induction of the enzyme but rather may be due to the loss of factors that normally suppress its expression. Cell death may serve to unmask the activity of the constitutive core promoter of the tissue transglutaminase gene, and this in turn may lead to the marked accumulation of the enzyme that occurs in many dying cells. Several studies have demonstrated that the expression of tissue transglutaminase can be regulated by retinoids (3Greenberg C.S. Birckbichler P.J. Rice R.H. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 3071-3077Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar, 17Antonio Chiocca E. Davies P.J.A. Stein J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11584-11589PubMed Google Scholar, 36Moore W.T. Michael P. Murtaugh M.P. Davies P.J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12794-12802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Retinoids did not increase the transcriptional activity of the 1.74-kb tissue transglutaminase promoter fragment when it was transfected into a retinoid-responsive (γ3T3) cell line. This finding suggests that retinoid regulation of the human transglutaminase promoter is conferred by DNA sequences that lie outside the proximal 1.74-kb promoter fragment analyzed in these studies.

https://openalex.org/W2005630069,"Two tandem immunoglobulin-like disulfide loops (Loops II and III) linked by a short connecting sequence in the ectodomain of the fibroblast growth factor receptor kinase compose the binding sites for glycosaminoglycan and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) ligands. Alternate splicing of exons IIIb and IIIc coding for the COOH-terminal half of Loop III confers high affinity for FGF-7 or FGF-2, respectively, on the fibroblast growth factor receptor ectodomain without effect on the binding of FGF-1. Here we show that a 139-amino acid fragment composed of Loop II, the inter-Loop II/III sequence, and a short segment of the NH2terminus of Loop III is sufficient and near the minimal requirement for binding of FGF-1, FGF-2, and FGF-7. Extension of the fragment by five additional highly conserved residues (SD(P/A)QP) within a distinct constitutive structural domain (fl1) in Loop III restricts the binding of FGF-7 without effect on FGF-1 and FGF-2. Since the presence of exon IIIc in the full-length ectodomain does not change this ligand binding profile, we suggest that alternately spliced exon IIIc plays no active role in binding of the three ligands. In contrast, exon IIIb actively abrogates the restriction on the binding of FGF-7 and concurrently lowers the affinity for FGF-2.

Here we show that a 139-amino acid fragment composed of Loop II, the inter-Loop II/III sequence, and a short segment of the NH2terminus of Loop III is sufficient and near the minimal requirement for binding of FGF-1, FGF-2, and FGF-7. Extension of the fragment by five additional highly conserved residues (SD(P/A)QP) within a distinct constitutive structural domain (fl1) in Loop III restricts the binding of FGF-7 without effect on FGF-1 and FGF-2. Since the presence of exon IIIc in the full-length ectodomain does not change this ligand binding profile, we suggest that alternately spliced exon IIIc plays no active role in binding of the three ligands. In contrast, exon IIIb actively abrogates the restriction on the binding of FGF-7 and concurrently lowers the affinity for FGF-2."

Factor VIII is homologous to blood coagulation factor V, both having a domain structure of A1-A2-B-A3-C1-C2. Previous transfection studies demonstrated that factor VIII is 10-fold less efficiently expressed than the homologous coagulation factor, factor V. The inefficient expression correlated with interaction of the factor VIII primary translation product with the protein chaperonin BiP in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. In contrast, factor V was not detected in association with BiP and was secreted efficiently. To determine whether specific amino acid sequences within factor VIII inhibit secretion, we have studied the secretion of factor VIII deletion and factor VIII/factor V chimeric proteins upon transient transfection of COS-1 monkey cells. A chimeric factor VIII protein that contained the A1- and A2-domains of factor V was secreted with a similar efficiency as wild-type factor V, whereas the complementary chimera having the A1- and A2-domains of factor VIII was secreted with low efficiency, similar to wild-type factor VIII. These results suggested that sequences within the A1- and A2-domains were responsible for the low secretion efficiency of factor VIII. Secretion of A1-domain-deleted factor VIII was increased approximately 10-fold compared to wild-type factor VIII or A2-domain-deleted factor VIII. Expression of the factor VIII A1-domain alone did not yield secreted protein, whereas expression of the factor VIII A2-domain alone or the factor V A1-domain or A2-domain alone directed synthesis of secreted protein,.

Thus, our knowledge of factor VIII expression is derived from interpretation of results from expression of the cDNA using expression vectors in transfected mammalian cells. Expression of factor VIII in these transfection systems is 2-3 orders of magnitude lower than that observed with other genes using similar vectors and approaches. Studies have identified three potential reasons that limit factor VIII expression (14Kaufman R.J. Transfus. Med.

The inefficient secretion of factor VIII correlates with binding to the protein chaperonin identified as the immunoglobulin binding protein (BiP), also known as the glucose-regulated protein of 78 kDa (GRP78) (18Munro S. Pelham H.R.B. Cell. 1986; 46: 291-300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1039) Google Scholar) within the lumen of the ER (19Dorner A.J. Wasley L.C. Kaufman R.J. EMBO J. 1992; 4: 1563-1571Crossref Scopus (297) Google Scholar). BiP is a member of the heat-shock protein family that exhibits a peptide-dependent ATPase activity (20Flynn G.C. Chappell T.G. Rothman J.E. Science. 1989; 245: 385-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). BiP expression is induced by the presence of unfolded protein or unassembled protein subunits within the ER (21Lee A.S. Curr. Opin.

Chem. 1989; 264: 20602-20607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, factor VIII release from BiP and transport out of the ER required high levels of intracellular ATP (24Dorner A.J. Wasley L.C. Kaufman R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7429-7432Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In contrast, the homologous coagulation protein, factor V, did not associate with BiP and did not require high levels of ATP for secretion (25Pittman D.D. Tomkinson K.N. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17329-17337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Deletion of the factor VIII B-domain yielded a protein that bound BiP to a lesser degree and was more efficiently secreted (17Dorner A.J. Bole D.G. Kaufman R.J. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2665-2674Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). To evaluate whether the factor VIII B-domain was responsible for BiP interaction, factor V and factor VIII chimeric cDNA molecules were constructed in which the B-domain sequences were exchanged (26Pittman D.D. Marquette K.A. Kaufman R.J. Blood. 1994; 84: 4214-4225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A factor VIII hybrid harboring the B-domain of factor V was expressed and secreted as a functional molecule, although the secretion efficiency of the hybrid was poor and similar to wild-type factor VIII (26Pittman D.D. Marquette K.A. Kaufman R.J. Blood. 1994; 84: 4214-4225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This indicated that the difference in secretion efficiency between factors V and VIII was not directly attributable to specific sequences within the factor VIII B-domain, the most divergent region between these homologous coagulation factors. To further identify regions within factor VIII that inhibit secretion, we have analyzed the expression of factor VIII deletion and factor VIII/factor V chimeric molecules. The results identify a 110-amino acid region within the factor VIII A1-domain that inhibits secretion. Rabbit anti-factor V polyclonal antibody was purchased from Dako Corp. (Carpinteria, CA). Factor V monoclonal antibody E9 directed against the factor V light chain (27Katzmann J.A. Nesheim M.E. Hibbard L.S. Mann K.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 487-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) utilizes the adenovirus major late promoter with SV40 enhancer and origin of replication. The factor VIII expression vector pMT2-VIII has a unique XhoI site upstream of the initiation codon and a unique SalI site at nucleotide 8379, where nucleotide 1 is at the 5′ end of the SV40 enhancer (26Pittman D.D. Marquette K.A. Kaufman R.J. Blood. 1994; 84: 4214-4225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The factor V expression vector pMT2-V has two SalI sites flanking the factor V cDNA at nucleotides 1088 and 7932 (26Pittman D.D. Marquette K.A. Kaufman R.J.

To facilitate domain exchanges and deletions, site-directed oligonucleotide-mediated mutagenesis was performed by the heteroduplex procedure (30Pittman D.D. Kaufman R.J. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 236-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) using different sized (approximately 50 bases) mutagenic oligonucleotides to introduce unique MluI restriction sites at arginine residues 226, 336, 372, and 740 within factor VIII to yield expression plasmids designated p226 MluI, p336 MluI, p372 MluI, and p740 MluI. Plasmids p372 MluI and p740 MluI were previously described (28Pittman D.D. Millenson M. Marquette K. Bauer K. Kaufman R.J. Blood. 1992; 79: 389-397Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Unique MluI restriction sites were introduced into the factor V cDNA at arginine residues 198, 313, and 709 within factor V to yield p198 MluI, p313 MluI, and p709 MluI. Double MluI mutations were sequentially introduced into pMT2-V at amino acids 313 and 709 to yield p313/709 MluI. Chimeric and deletion molecules were constructed by restriction endonuclease digestion, gel electrophoresis in low-gelling temperature agarose, and ligation of the isolated fragments. The resulting plasmids were purified over cesium chloride and characterized by extensive restriction mapping and partial DNA sequencing. The factor VIII deletion pVIIIΔA1 was constructed by digesting p372 MluI with XhoI and MluI and ligation to complementary phosphorylated oligonucleotides encoding the factor VIII signal peptide and flanked by unique XhoI (5′) and MluI (3′) restriction sites having the sequence: 5′-TCGAGAGCTTCGACCACCATGCAAATAGAGCTCTCCACCTGCTTCTTTCTGTGCCTTTTGCGATTCTGCTTTAGTA-3′. The factor VIII deletion molecule pΔA1-ac deletes amino acids 1 through 372 and does not contain the factor VIII acidic region (residues 336-372). A linker comprised of two complementary synthetic oligonucleotides encoding the acidic region from 336 to 372 flanked by the 5′ and 3′ MluI restriction sites was ligated into the unique MluI site of pΔA1-ac to yield pVIIIΔA1. The hybrid pVIIIA1V containing the A1-domain of factor V (amino acids 1-312) was constructed by ligation of the 11,026-bp XhoI/ MluI fragment from pVIIIΔA1 to the 1,067-bp SalI/ MluI fragment from p313 MluI and designated pVIIIA1V-ac. pVIIIA1V was generated by ligation of the 108-bp MluI fragment (336-372 acidic region) from pVIIIΔA1 to MluI linearized pVIIIA1V-ac to yield pVIIIA1V. The factor VIII deletion molecule pVIIIΔA2 (336-739) has a unique MluI site at the junction of the deletion and was described previously (28Pittman D.D. Millenson M. Marquette K. Bauer K.

The factor VIII chimera containing the factor V A2-domain (factor V amino acid residues 313-708) was constructed by linearizing pVIIIΔA2 with MluI and ligating it to the 1188-bp MluI fragment from p313/709 MluI. The factor VIII deletion plasmid pΔ1-225 was made by ligation of the 3859-bp ClaI/ MluI fragment from pVIIIΔA1 to the 7685-bp ClaI/ MluI fragment from p226 MluI. The factor VIII chimera pV1-226, replacing factor VIII amino acids 1-225 with residues 1-197 from factor V, was assembled by ligation of the 11,468-bp XhoI/ MluI fragment from pΔ1-225 to the 722-bp SalI/ MluI fragment from p198 MluI. The factor VIII deletion pΔ226-371 removes amino acids 226-371 and was constructed by ligation of the 4,531-bp ClaI/ MluI fragment from p226 MluI to the 7,243-bp ClaI/ MluI fragment from p372 MluI. The factor VIII chimera pV227-336, replacing factor VIII amino acids 226-335 with factor V amino acids 198-312, was constructed by a 3-way ligation of MluI linearized pΔ226-371, the 106-bp MluI/ SacI fragment from p198 MluI and the 238-bp SacI/ MluI fragment from p313 MluI. Then the factor VIII acidic region (336-372) was isolated from pVIIIΔA1 on a 108-bp MluI fragment and ligated into the unique MluI site. The factor VIII chimera (pVIIIhcV) containing residues 1-708 from factor V was constructed by ligation of the 9,922-bp XhoI/ MluI fragment from p740 MluI to the 2,260-bp SalI/ MluI fragment from p709 MluI. The factor V hybrid molecule (pVhcVIII), harboring the heavy chain of factor VIII (amino acid residues 1-739) was constructed by ligating the 7,206-bp SalI/ MluI fragment from p740 MluI to the 4,553-bp SalI/ MluI fragment from p709 MluI. The hybrid pVIIIA1V containing the A1-domain of factor V (amino acids 1-312) was constructed by ligation of the 11,026-bp XhoI/ MluI fragment from pVIIIΔA1 to the 1,067 bp SalI/ MluI fragment from p313 MluI. To construct the factor VIII chimera containing the A2-domain (amino acids 313-709) of factor V(pVIIIA2V), pVIIIΔA2 was linearized with MluI and ligated to the 1,188-bp fragment from p313/709 MluI. The expression vector encoding the factor VIII A1-domain alone (pVIIIA1) was constructed by ligation of the 6102-bp MluI/ SalI fragment from p372 MluI to the following annealed phosphorylated oligonucleotide MluI- SalI linker: 5′-CGCGTTGATGAG-3′ and 5′-TCGACTCATCAA-3′, which contains two termination codons. The expression vector encoding the factor VIII A2-domain (pA2) was described previously (28Pittman D.D. Millenson M. Marquette K. Bauer K. Kaufman R.J. Blood. 1992; 79: 389-397Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The factor V A1-domain alone was assembled by ligating the 4924-bp XhoI/ MluI fragment from pVIIIA1 to the 1067-bp SalI/ MluI fragment from p313 MluI. The factor V A2-domain alone was constructed by a 3-way ligation of the 3859-bp ClaI/ MluI fragment from pVIIIΔA1, the 1188-bp MluI fragment from p313/709 MluI, and the 1141-bp ClaI/ MluI fragment from pVIIIA1. The factor V heavy chain alone (94-kDa) was constructed by ligation of the 4924-bp XhoI/ MluI fragment from pVIIIA1 to the 2281-bp SalI/ MluI fragment from p709 MluI. Plasmid DNA was transfected into COS-1 cells by the DEAE-dextran procedure (29Kaufman R.J. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 487-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Conditioned medium was harvested 60 h post-transfection in the presence of 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum for factor VIII assay. Primary translation products were analyzed by pulse labeling cells for 15 min with [35S]methionine (250 μCi/ml in methionine-free medium) and preparing cell extracts in a Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (31Dorner A.J. Kaufman R.J. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 577-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Protein secretion was monitored by metabolically pulse labeling cells with [35S]methionine (250 μCi/ml for 15 min) and chasing for increasing periods of time in medium containing excess unlabeled methionine as described (30Pittman D.D. Kaufman R.J. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 236-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Cell extracts and conditioned medium were harvested as described previously (30Pittman D.D. Kaufman R.J. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 236-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 31Dorner A.J. Kaufman R.J. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 577-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The factor VIII was quantitatively immunoprecipitated with an anti-factor VIII monoclonal antibody F-8 (28Pittman D.D. Millenson M. Marquette K. Bauer K. Kaufman R.J. Blood. 1992; 79: 389-397Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) coupled to CL-4B Sepharose or with anti-factor VIII light chain monoclonal antibody coupled to Affi-Gel. Factor V was immunoprecipitated with either monoclonal antibody E-9 specific to the factor V light chain (27Katzmann J.A. Nesheim M.E. Hibbard L.S. Mann K.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 162-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) or a rabbit polyclonal antibody coupled to Affi-Gel (Bio-Rad). The antibodies were tested prior to the experiments to determine the amount of antibody required for quantitative immunoprecipitation. In all cases excess antibody was used. The immunoprecipitates were washed as described (31Dorner A.J. Kaufman R.J. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 577-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitated proteins from the conditioned medium were resuspended 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM CaCl2, and 5% glycerol for electrophoresis on an SDS-low bis-8% polyacrylamide gel (32Dreyfuss G. Adam S.A. Choi Y.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 415-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). In addition to analysis by immunoprecipitation, equal quantities of [35S]methionine-labeled conditioned medium were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were visualized by autoradiography after fluorography by treatment with En3Hance (Dupont, Boston, MA). The band intensities were quantitated by scanning the lanes using an LKB UltroScan XL laser densitometer (Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology Inc., Uppsala, Sweden). The total amount of secreted protein was estimated by adding the amount of single-chain to the amount of processed fragments. Chain association was measured by co-immunoprecipitation experiments. The conditioned medium was immunoprecipitated with the factor VIII heavy chain monoclonal antibody (F8). The antibody-factor VIII complexes were collected by centrifugation and the supernatant fluid was subsequently immunoprecipitated with the light chain-specific monoclonal antibody. The immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as described above. Factor VIII activity was measured by a chromogenic assay (33Hellstern P. Kiehl R. Miyashita C. Schwerdt H. von Blohn G. Kohler M. Buttner M. Wenzel E. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1986; 56: 353-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) or in a clotting assay using factor VIII-deficient plasma (34Proctor R.R. Rapaport S.I. Am. J. Clin. Pathol. 1961; 36: 212-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). Factor V activity was measured in a clotting assay using factor V-deficient plasma. Total RNA was isolated from transfected COS-1 cells at 60 h post-transfection using the guanidine thiocyanate method (35Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16608) Google Scholar). Northern blot hybridization was performed using a dihydrofolate reductase cDNA probe as described previously (26Pittman D.D. Marquette K.A. Kaufman R.J. Blood. 1994; 84: 4214-4225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Northern blots were also probed with a β-actin cDNA probe to insure that the lanes were equally loaded. Previous studies in transfected mammalian cells demonstrated that factor V was more efficiently secreted than factor VIII (25Pittman D.D. Tomkinson K.N. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17329-17337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Pittman D.D. Marquette K.A. Kaufman R.J. Blood. 1994; 84: 4214-4225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, secretion of the factor VIII 90-kDa heavy chain fragment compared to the 80-kDa light chain fragment, each fused to the factor VIII signal peptide, was significantly reduced, although both proteins were translated at similar levels in the cell (36Burke R.L. Pachl C. Quiroga M. Rosenberg S. Haigwood N. Nordfang O. Ezban M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12574-12578Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).2 2K. A. Marquette, D. D. Pittman, and R. J. Kaufman, unpublished results. These results suggested that the factor VIII light chain can be efficiently secreted in the absence of the heavy chain and that the heavy chain expressed alone is inefficiently secreted, similar to wild-type factor VIII. To further localize a region(s) within the factor VIII heavy chain that may inhibit secretion, the expression of A1-domain (residues 1-336) deleted factor VIII (ΔA1) and of A2-domain (residues 373-740) deleted factor VIII (ΔA2) was studied. In addition, a series of chimeric proteins were constructed that replaced different regions of factor VIII heavy chain with factor V residues. The factor V and factor VIII cDNAs were engineered to contain unique MluI restriction sites (encoding Thr-Arg) at the Arg residues 226, 336, 372, and 740 in human factor VIII and at Arg residues 198, 313, and 709 in human factor V. In this way, homologous sequences were exchanged by DNA fragment exchanges and chimeric molecules were produced by transient DNA transfection of COS-1 monkey kidney cells. These particular residues were chosen because they are proteolytic cleavage sites that are likely on the outer surfaces of these proteins and therefore chimeric proteins that harbor novel junctions at these sites are more likely to fold properly. Analysis of factor VIII expression upon transient transfection of COS-1 monkey cells demonstrated that introduction of the MluI restriction sites did not affect the synthesis, secretion, functional activity, or the ability of the molecules to be cleaved by thrombin (data not shown). Chimeric molecules were constructed replacing factor VIII residues 1-740 with factor V residues 1-709 (designated VIIIhcV), factor VIII residues 1-336 with factor V residues 1-313 (designated VIIIA1V), and factor VIII residues 373-740 with factor V residues 314-709 (designated VIIIA2V). Transfected cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine and cell extracts were analyzed for primary translation products by immunoprecipitation with an anti-factor VIII polyclonal antibody. Total radiolabeled conditioned medium was analyzed directly to rule out the possibility that the mutant proteins were not efficiently recognized by the antibody. In addition, total cellular RNA was prepared for analysis by Northern blot hybridization to quantitate factor VIII mRNA levels. Analysis of total conditioned medium from wild-type factor V-transfected cells detected migration of factor V at 330 kDa, just below a background polypeptide (Fig. 1 A, lane 4). In contrast, wild-type factor VIII was barely detectable above background bands (Fig. 1 A, lane 1). Deletion of the A1-domain (Fig. 1 A, lane 2) or replacement of the factor VIII heavy chain (Fig. 1 A, lane 6) or the A1-domain (Fig. 1 A, lane 7) with corresponding sequences of factor V increased the level of factor VIII polypeptides in the conditioned medium significantly above the wild-type factor VIII. In addition, the increased expression permitted direct detection of radiolabeled light chain in the total conditioned medium from cells transfected with the ΔA1, VIIIhcV, or VIIIA1V (Fig. 1 A, lanes 2, 6, and 7). In contrast, deletion of the A2-domain (Fig. 1 A, lane 3) or replacement of the factor VIII A2-domain with factor V residues (Fig. 1 A, lane 8) did not increase the level of factor VIII polypeptides detected in the conditioned medium. Secretion of a factor V chimera that had factor V residues 1-709 replaced for factor VIII residues was reduced compared to wild-type factor V (Fig. 1 A, lane 5), suggesting the factor VIII residues 1-740 inhibit accumulation of the VhcVIII chimera in the conditioned medium. In addition, a factor V chimeric molecule that had the factor V light chain (residues 1546-2196) replaced by the factor VIII light chain (residues 1649-2332) accumulated to levels similar to wild-type factor V, indicating that the light chain of factor VIII did not inhibit factor V accumulation in the conditioned medium (data not shown). Analysis of mRNA (Fig. 1 B) and primary translation products (Fig. 1 C) indicated that the mRNAs encoding the deletion and chimeric factor VIII proteins were expressed at similar levels and were translated with similar efficiencies. Although there were minor variations in the mRNA levels detected, they did not account for the major difference in the amount of protein secreted into the conditioned medium. In addition, differences in methionine content could not account for the increased secretion associated with the absence of"
https://openalex.org/W2076288433,"Adenylate cyclase toxin from Bordetella pertussis is a 177-kDa calmodulin-activated enzyme that has the ability to enter eukaryotic cells and convert endogenous ATP into cAMP. Little is known, however, about the mechanism of cell entry. We now demonstrate that intoxication of cardiac myocytes by adenylate cyclase toxin is driven and controlled by the electrical potential across the plasma membrane. The steepness of the voltage dependence of intoxication is comparable with that previously observed for the activation of K+and Na+channels of excitable membranes. The voltage-sensitive process is downstream from toxin binding to the cell surface and appears to correspond to the translocation of the catalytic domain across the membrane.

In vitro this potent toxin induces massive increases in the intracellular levels of cAMP in phagocytes and is postulated to use this mechanism to disarm the host's response to infection (6Confer D.

Productive interaction between AC toxin and target cells requires calcium ions and a post-translational modification that is dependent upon the product of another gene, cyaC (8Confer D. Slungaard A.

A specific cell surface receptor for the toxin has never been identified; rather, there is evidence that the first step in the intoxication process may involve an interaction with negatively charged lipids (15Gordon V.M. Leppla S.H. Hewlett E.L. Infect. Immun. 1988; 56: 1066-1069Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Gordon V.M. Young W.W. Lechler S.M. Gray M.C. Leppla S.H. Hewlett E.L. J. Biol.

As observed with several other bacterial toxins (18Hoch D.H. Romero-Mira M. Ehrlich B.E. Finkelstein A. DasGupta B.R. Simpson L.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Toxicon. 1990; 28: 477-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), AC toxin was recently shown to form an ion-conductive pathway in artificial lipid bilayers in a voltage-dependent manner (17Szabo G. Gray M.C. Hewlett E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22496-22499Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This finding raises the possibility that in vivo the membrane potential might control the translocation of AC toxin across the plasma membrane. Although studies using ionophores or agents that collapse the mitochondrial electrochemical gradient have suggested that the movement of proteins into or across intracellular membranes might be affected by membrane potential, the complexity of the eukaryotic transport systems and the limitations inherent in the methods employed have precluded direct evaluation of this hypothesis (21Hudson T.H. Scharff J. Kimak M.A.G. Neville D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4773-4781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Chaumont F. O'Riordan V. Boutry M. J. Biol.

In contrast, the effects of membrane voltage on entry of AC toxin into cells can be studied directly in single cardiac myocytes by monitoring cAMP-stimulated calcium currents with the patch clamp technique (13Hewlett E.L. Gray M.C. Ehrmann I.E. Maloney N.J. Otero A.S. Gray L. Allietta M. Szabo G. Weiss A.A. Barry E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7842-7848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This approach allows full control of the potential across the plasma membrane, while the development of intoxication is measured with high sensitivity and time resolution. We report here the results of experiments demonstrating that intoxication of atrial cells by AC toxin is highly voltage-dependent, being abolished by membrane depolarization.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPurification of Adenylate Cyclase ToxinWild type B. pertussis (strain BP338) and a mutant in which Lys-58 was replaced with a methionine residue (strain BPLM58IE) were grown as described previously (25Hewlett E.

FEBS Lett. 1992; 304: 51-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). AC toxin was purified by urea extraction, phenyl-Sepharose chromatography, sucrose gradient centrifugation, and calmodulin-Sepharose chromatography (13Hewlett E.L. Gray M.C. Ehrmann I.E. Maloney N.J.

Each toxin batch was dialyzed against external solution immediately prior to experiments and then diluted to the desired concentration with external solution. Enzyme activity was measured by the conversion of [α-32P]ATP to [32P]cAMP in a cell-free assay (13Hewlett E.L. Gray M.C. Ehrmann I.E. Maloney N.J. Otero A.S. Gray L. Allietta M. Szabo G. Weiss A.A. Barry E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7842-7848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cAMP formed was isolated as described by Salomon et al. (27Salomon Y. Londos C. Rodbell M. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 58: 541-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (3368) Google Scholar). Enzyme specific activities for wild type toxin, BP338, ranged from 0.8 to 1.2 mmol of cAMP/min/mg of toxin. Toxin activity of wild type toxin, as determined by quantitation of intracellular cAMP in Jurkat cells exposed to AC toxin for 30 min at 37°C (13Hewlett E.L. Gray M.C. Ehrmann I.E. Maloney N.J. Otero A.S. Gray L. Allietta M. Szabo G. Weiss A.A. Barry E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7842-7848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was 12-15 μmol of cAMP/mg of Jurkat cell protein/mg of toxin. The mutant toxin, strain BPLM58IE, exhibited a 1000-fold reduction in enzymatic activity relative to wild type toxin and was unable to increase cAMP in target cells.Electrophysiologic Studies-Myocytes were enzymatically dissociated from bullfrog atria as described previously (28Otero A.S. Sweitzer N.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 595-604PubMed Google Scholar). Membrane currents were recorded at 22−24°C in the whole-cell configuration of the gigaseal patch clamp technique (29Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pflügers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15094) Google Scholar). The internal solution contained 120 mM CsCl (to block K+selective channels), 1 mM EGTA, 2.5 mM Mg+ATP, 0.2 mM Li4+GTP, 5 mM HEPES, adjusted to pH 7.4 with KOH, while the external solution contained 85 mM NaCl, 20 mM CsCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 2 mM CaCl2, 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.4 with NaOH), and 5 μM tetrodotoxin, a Na+channel blocker. The standard pulse protocol consisted of 0.5-s steps from a holding potential of −85 mV to −135, −75, −45, −15, 15, and 45 mV. The cell was kept at −85 mV for 2 s between pulses. The amplitude of ICawas measured as the difference between the peak inward current and the steady state current averaged during the last 10 ms of the pulse.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONAC toxin, at concentrations of 3.5-4.5 μg/ml, elicits a large increase (11.7-fold ± 4.4; n = 16) in the amplitude of Ca2+currents (ICa) of frog atrial myocytes (13Hewlett E.L. Gray M.C. Ehrmann I.E. Maloney N.J. Otero A.S. Gray L. Allietta M. Szabo G. Weiss A.A. Barry E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7842-7848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1), comparable in magnitude to the stimulation of ICainduced by β-adrenergic agonists (30Li Y. Hanf R. Otero A.S. Fischmeister R. Szabo G. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 104: 941-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). This effect of AC toxin is characterized by a short latency period (0.59 ± 0.17 min; n = 6) followed by a slow increase of Ca2+currents, with a maximum being reached within 3.5-9 min. An enzyme-deficient AC toxin, in which lysine 58, a residue involved in catalysis, is replaced by a methionine (26Ehrmann I. Weiss A. Goodwin M.S. Gray M.C. Barry E. Hewlett E.L. FEBS Lett. 1992; 304: 51-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) has no effect on ICa(Fig. 1). Thus, the increase in the amplitude of the Ca2+current is directly related to intracellular cAMP production, which is an intrinsic property of the wild type toxin and leads to activation of protein kinase A and phosphorylation of L-type Ca2+channels (31Trautwein W. Hescheler J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1990; 52: 257-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar).To determine the voltage dependence of intoxication, we applied AC toxin to cells for a fixed period while the membrane potential was clamped at the values specified in the figure legends. Calcium currents were measured at the beginning of the experiment, for determination of basal levels, and following the holding period. We found that the increase of ICais virtually complete following 5 min of toxin application to myocytes held at −85 mV (Fig. 2 A). In contrast, there is no increase in Ca2+currents when the membrane potential is kept at +45 mV during the first 5 min of AC toxin application (Fig. 2 B); upon return to the standard pulse protocol, ICais still at the basal level and only then starts to increase, following a time course similar to that shown in Fig. 1.Figure 2:Effect of AC toxin application on cells held at constant voltages. After the establishment of the whole-cell recording mode, ICa(•) was elicited by 0.5-s voltage steps to 15 mV from a holding potential of −85 mV, and basal currents were measured. The cell was then clamped at −85 mV (A) or +45 mV (B) for the period indicated by dotted lines. AC toxin (4 μg/ml) was applied for the period indicated by the horizontal bar. After 5 min of toxin exposure at a constant voltage, the pulse protocol was resumed directly and ICawas measured again.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 3 shows the percent increase in calcium currents observed for cells held at various potentials as a function of the membrane potential. The results indicate that there is essentially no stimulation of ICawhile cells are held in the range of 0 to +45 mV; as the holding potential becomes negative, the toxin-induced increases in ICarise steeply, reaching a maximum around −45 mV. The solid line is a fit of the data to the Boltzmann equation (1Weiss A. Hewlett E.L. Myers G. Falkow S. J. Infect. Dis. 1984; 150: 219-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), I=I\textmax/1+eβ(V-V0.5)(Eq. 1) Figure 3:Voltage dependence of ICastimulation. Experiments followed the protocol illustrated in Fig. 2. During the first 5 min of exposure to AC toxin (4 μg/ml) the voltage was kept at the values shown. Calcium currents recorded immediately after the pulse protocol was resumed were normalized to the maximal ICaamplitude in each cell (♦). Plotted are results obtained with individual cells; symbols with error bars are means ± S.E. from three separate experiments. Also shown are the results of experiments following the same protocol, but using 0.2 μM isoproterenol (□) instead of AC toxin to stimulate ICa.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Yielding Imax = 85.56%, β = 0.181 mV1, and V0.5 (voltage for half-maximal stimulation of Ca) = 16.6 mV. The slope factor β is equal to ze/kT, where k is the Boltzmann constant, e is elementary charge, T the absolute temperature, and z the number of elementary charges involved in toxin delivery. From the inverse of β we obtain a voltage dependence (32Hille B. Ionic Channels of Excitable Membranes. 2nd Ed. Sinauer Associates, Inc., Sunderland, MA1992: 23-58Google Scholar) of 5.5 mV per e-fold increase in ICa. With kT/e = 25.5 mV, it can be estimated that 4.6 elementary charges move across the membrane during toxin delivery. This value is compatible with the transmembrane movement of either one toxin molecule with multiple charges or a higher order oligomer with 1-2 charges per protein chain. The latter possibility would agree with a power dependence of greater than 3 for pore formation by AC toxin in lipid bilayers (17Szabo G. Gray M.C. Hewlett E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22496-22499Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).To verify that the observed voltage dependence is a property of AC toxin, and not a characteristic of one or more components of the phosphorylation cascade triggered by cAMP, we performed experiments in which ICawas stimulated not by AC toxin but by isoproterenol, a β-adrenergic receptor agonist, which increases cAMP production through stimulation of the endogenous adenylate cyclase. As seen in Fig. 3, enhancement of cardiac Ca2+currents by isoproterenol shows little influence of the membrane potential, confirming that the striking voltage dependence observed with AC toxin is a characteristic of the intoxication process.Experimental evidence indicates that B. pertussis AC toxin invades target cells directly, rather than depending on an endocytic pathway such as the one utilized by Bacillus anthracis toxin, the only other invasive bacterial toxin known to have adenylate cyclase activity (15Gordon V.M. Leppla S.H. Hewlett E.L. Infect. Immun. 1988; 56: 1066-1069Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Gordon V.M. Young W.W. Lechler S.M. Gray M.C. Leppla S.H. Hewlett E.L. J. Biol.

Therefore, a basic model of AC toxin entry into cells involves a sequence of at least two steps: 1) binding to the outer surface of the membrane and 2) insertion into the membrane with translocation of the catalytic portion into the cell interior (5Hewlett E.L. Maloney N.J. Iglewski B. Moss J. Tu A.T. Vaughan M. Handbook of Natural Toxins, Volume 8: Microbial Toxins. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1994: 425-439Google Scholar). In principle, the membrane potential could affect either or both these processes. To better define the step affected by the voltage, we performed experiments similar to the one in Fig. 2B, applying toxin for 5 min while holding the cell at +45 mV. Before the pulse protocol was resumed, however, the toxin-containing solution was replaced with standard external solution and the cell was washed for 2-3 min. Were the toxin not able to bind to the membrane at positive potentials, this washout period should completely remove it from the cell surface as well as the bathing solution, yielding no increase in ICaafter pulsing is resumed. In contrast, if binding occurs normally at positive potentials and only the translocation step is prevented, ICashould increase at the end of the holding period even if the toxin is no longer present in the bath. Indeed, Fig. 4 shows that even when the toxin is removed from the bath, ICaincreases upon return to the standard pulse protocol, indicating that during the period at +45 mV toxin molecules attached themselves to the plasma membrane in a manner that was resistant to subsequent washout. The results obtained under these conditions (n = 3) are qualitatively identical to those in Fig. 2 B, establishing that the voltage-sensitive step in toxin delivery is downstream from binding and is likely to represent translocation of the catalytic site to the cytoplasm.Figure 4:Effect of AC toxin application and washout at 45 mV. The experimental protocol and symbols are the same as in Fig. 2, except for the duration of toxin application and the inclusion of a washout period as indicated by the horizontal bar.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Our results demonstrate that the delivery of AC toxin to its site of action is driven and controlled by the electric field across the plasma membrane. Intoxication of atrial cells is readily observed within minutes of exposure to adenylate cyclase toxin when myocytes are held at negative potentials but hindered at membrane potentials positive to −45 mV and is totally prevented when the membrane is kept at positive potentials. This steep voltage dependence of intoxication (5.5 mV per e-fold increase in intoxication) is comparable with that of the voltage-gated K+and Na+channels of squid axon (4.8 and 3.9 mV per e-fold increase in conductance, respectively (Ref.32 and references therein)) and places AC toxin delivery among the most voltage-sensitive biological processes known. In our studies, the ability to follow the time course of intoxication of single cells by AC toxin has allowed direct demonstration of a role for membrane potential in toxin delivery. This novel experimental system should help expand our present understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying membrane translocation of proteins in general and of bacterial toxins in particular.

A specific cell surface receptor for the toxin has never been identified; rather, there is evidence that the first step in the intoxication process may involve an interaction with negatively charged lipids (15Gordon V.M. Leppla S.H. Hewlett E.L. Infect. Immun. 1988; 56: 1066-1069Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Gordon V.M. Young W.W. Lechler S.M. Gray M.C. Leppla S.H. Hewlett E.L. J. Biol.

As observed with several other bacterial toxins (18Hoch D.H. Romero-Mira M. Ehrlich B.E. Finkelstein A. DasGupta B.R. Simpson L.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Toxicon. 1990; 28: 477-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), AC toxin was recently shown to form an ion-conductive pathway in artificial lipid bilayers in a voltage-dependent manner (17Szabo G. Gray M.C. Hewlett E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22496-22499Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This finding raises the possibility that in vivo the membrane potential might control the translocation of AC toxin across the plasma membrane. Although studies using ionophores or agents that collapse the mitochondrial electrochemical gradient have suggested that the movement of proteins into or across intracellular membranes might be affected by membrane potential, the complexity of the eukaryotic transport systems and the limitations inherent in the methods employed have precluded direct evaluation of this hypothesis (21Hudson T.H. Scharff J. Kimak M.A.G. Neville D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4773-4781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Chaumont F. O'Riordan V. Boutry M. J. Biol.

In contrast, the effects of membrane voltage on entry of AC toxin into cells can be studied directly in single cardiac myocytes by monitoring cAMP-stimulated calcium currents with the patch clamp technique (13Hewlett E.L.

This approach allows full control of the potential across the plasma membrane, while the development of intoxication is measured with high sensitivity and time resolution. We report here the results of experiments demonstrating that intoxication of atrial cells by AC toxin is highly voltage-dependent, being abolished by membrane depolarization."

The expression of this gene is relatively low in the fetal and newborn rat brain, and an accelerated expression occurs 2-3 weeks after birth (1Watson J.B. Battenberg E.F. Wong K.K. Bloom F.E. Sutcliffe J.G. J. Neurosci. Res. 1990; 26: 397-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 3Repressa A. Deloulme J.C. Sensenbrenner M. Ben-Ari Y. Baudier J. J. Neurosci. 1990; 10: 3782-3792Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cellular and subcellular localizations and the pattern of expression of Ng/RC3 during development, in many respects, resemble those of the PKC-γ isozyme (17Yoshida Y. Huang F.L. Nakabayashi H. Huang K.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9868-9873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); however, the Ng/RC3 gene has a more restricted neuronal expression than PKC-γ. The characteristic tissue-specific and developmental stage-regulated expression of these two proteins is distinctively different from that of PKC-α and -β (17Yoshida Y. Huang F.L. Nakabayashi H. Huang K.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9868-9873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These latter two PKCs are ubiquitously expressed in a variety of tissues and cell types; in the brain, the expression of these two genes is progressively increased from the fetal stage up to 2-3 weeks after birth. The mechanisms that trigger the delayed expression of both PKC-γ and Ng/RC3 are unknown. Previously, we characterized the 5′-flanking region of the rat PKC-γ gene (18Chen K.-H. Widen S.G. Wilson S.H. Huang K.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19961-19965Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Chen K.-H. Widen S.G. Wilson S.H. Huang K.-P. FEBS Lett. 1993; 325: 210-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). A sequence of 163 base pairs (bp) upstream from the transcriptional initiation site was found to possess full promoter activity. This region contains consensus recognition elements for SP1 and AP2, but without the canonical TATA and CCAAT boxes at their usual positions upstream from the transcriptional initiation site. The PKC-γ gene contains a putative repressor-binding site near bp −670 with the ATTA motif typical of the homeobox-like protein-binding site of the POU family of factors (19Chen K.-H. Widen S.G. Wilson S.H. Huang K.-P. FEBS Lett. 1993; 325: 210-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 20Desplan C. Theis J. O'Farrell P.H. Cell. 1988; 54: 1081-1090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). This study was aimed at cloning the Ng/RC3 gene for the purpose of determining its structure and potential regulation. In addition, we were interested in determining any structural similarity between the Ng/RC3 and PKC-γ genes. Here, we describe the structural organization and sequence of the Ng/RC3 gene and its regulation by phorbol ester and PKC isozymes. The Ng/RC3 and PKC-γ genes are similar in that they lack the TATA and CCAAT boxes and contain several conserved sequence elements between them. We have also identified a 20-kDa DNA-binding protein that interacts with the AT-rich regions of both Ng/RC3 and PKC-γ promoters. The following materials were obtained from the indicated sources: a rat genomic library in the Lambda Dash II vector prepared from male Sprague-Dawley rat testis DNA from Stratagene; [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol), α-35S-ATP (1000 Ci/mmol), and [α-32P]CTP (3000 Ci/mmol) from Amersham Corp.; restriction enzymes and other DNA-modifying enzymes from New England Biolabs Inc. and Promega; molecular mass markers, luciferase, and β-galactosidase assay kits from Promega; a Sequenase kit from United States Biochemical Corp.; TaqI DNA polymerase, Lipofectin, Lipofectamine, and a DNase I footprinting system from Life Technologies, Inc.; and a Maxam-Gilbert DNA sequencing kit from DuPont NEN. Oligonucleotides were synthesized using an Applied Biosystems 380B DNA synthesizer. PKC-α, -βI, -βI, -γ, -δ, -ε, and -ζ cDNAs were provided by Dr. John L. Knopf (Genetics Institute), and RC3 cDNA was provided by Dr. Joseph B. Watson (UCLA). Approximately 1.5 × 106clones were screened by plaque hybridization with a 32P-randomly labeled full-length Ng/RC3 cDNA probe (1Watson J.B. Battenberg E.F. Wong K.K. Bloom F.E. Sutcliffe J.G. J. Neurosci. Res. 1990; 26: 397-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Escherichia coli strain LE392 was infected with recombinant phage and replica-plated on nitrocellulose filters. The filters were baked at 80°C for 2 h and then prehybridized at 65°C with 3 × SSC (150 mM NaCl, 15 mM trisodium citrate, pH 7.0) for 30 min and with 3 × SSC plus 1 × Denhardt's solution for 2 h. Hybridization with the probe was carried out in a hybridization solution containing 1 M NaCl, 10 mM EDTA, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 × Denhardt's solution, 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA, and denatured DNA probe at 65°C overnight. The filters were washed with 3 × SSC for 30 min at room temperature and then twice with 1 × SSC containing 0.1% SDS at 50°C for 30 min. Positive clones were further hybridized with a variety of oligonucleotide probes from the 5′-untranslated, translated, and 3′-untranslated regions of rat Ng/RC3 cDNA to confirm the isolation of a complete genomic clone. Phage DNA was digested with BamHI, EcoRI, PstI, and XbaI and subcloned into either the pGEM3Zf (Promega) or pBluescript IIKS(+) (Stratagene) vector. Each subclone was hybridized with oligonucleotide probes to determine the orientation of these genomic fragments and sequenced on both strands by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method using α-35S-dATP (21Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52251) Google Scholar). 7-Deaza-dGTP was used in some sequencing reactions to reduce the effect of GC band compression. To alleviate the polymerase “pauses” due to the secondary structure, terminal deoxynucleotide transferase was used in the chase reactions. The genomic DNA sequence was analyzed with the Genetics Computer Group software program. A 24-base synthetic oligodeoxynucleotide primer complementary to nucleotides +29 to +52 of the Ng/RC3 gene was labeled at the 5′-end with [γ-32P]ATP by T4 polynucleotide kinase and purified on a Stratagene NucTrap probe purification column. 32P-Labeled oligomer (∼10 pmol) was hybridized at 58°C for 20 min in a reaction mixture containing 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 300 mM KCl, and 1 μg of rat cerebral poly(A+) RNA prepared from adult rat brain total RNA. The extension reaction was carried out at 41°C for 30 min with the addition of 1 unit of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase, unlabeled deoxynucleotide triphosphates, and sodium pyrophosphate as recommended by the supplier (Promega, primer extension system). The reaction products were purified by ethanol precipitation and electrophoresed on a 7 M urea, 6% polyacrylamide sequencing gel. A single-stranded DNA sequencing product using the same primer was run in parallel as a reference to determine the size of the extended products. A 2.8-kb EcoRI/ BamHI genomic fragment encompassing the 5′-flanking region, the first exon, and part of the first intron was subcloned into pGEM3Zf(+), and deletion mutants were generated from this clone by polymerase chain reaction using specific primers for each construct. SacI and BglII site-containing primers were used at the 5′-ends for Ng/RC3(−1508/+256) and Ng/RC3(−940/+256) constructs, respectively. A KpnI linker was used for the 5′-ends of all other deletion mutants. The 3′-ends of all the deletion mutant constructs contained a HindIII linker. Polymerase chain reaction products digested with SacI/ HindIII for Ng/RC3(−1508/+256), BglII/ HindIII for Ng/RC3(−940/+256), and KpnI/ HindIII for the rest of the constructs were subcloned in the sense orientation upstream from the luciferase gene in the pGL2-Basic vector (Promega). All these constructs do not contain the neurogranin translational initiation codon (at nucleotide +260) and thus were not expected to interfere with the expression of luciferase. Various constructs were transformed into E. coli DH5α, and plasmid DNA was purified with a QIAGEN plasmid kit. Prior to transfection, samples of all plasmids were digested with the appropriate restriction endonucleases and resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis to ensure the quality of the preparations. Orientation of the insert was confirmed by sequencing. Transformed human embryonic kidney 293 cells (American Type Culture Collection) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 25 mM HEPES in a humidified atmosphere at 37°C containing 5% CO2. Subconfluent cultures (∼40-60% confluent, 24-48 h after plating) in 35-mm culture dishes were washed twice with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, and incubated with DNA-Lipofectin or DNA-Lipofectamine complexes containing 1.5-2.5 μg of Ng/RC3 construct plus 0.3-0.6 μg of pSV-β-galactosidase control vector or PKC cDNA in duplicate or triplicate. Transfection was carried out for 6 h, and cells were washed with fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 25 mM HEPES and fed the same medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. After 42-48 h, cells were rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with 25 mM Tris phosphate, pH 7.8, containing 2 mM dithiothreitol, 2 mM CDTA, 10% glycerol, and 1% Triton X-100 at room temperature for 10-15 min. Cells were scraped from the dish and transferred to microcentrifuge tubes for centrifugation to remove cell debris. Luciferase and β-galactosidase activities in the supernatant fluid were measured with Promega assay systems for these two enzymes. Protein concentrations were determined by the Coomassie Blue dye binding method (22Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar). A heat-stable nuclear protein was found to bind an AT-rich ApaI/ PstI fragment (−997/−454) of the Ng/RC3 gene. The binding activity of this protein was also stable to 2% perchloric acid treatment, similar to several PKC substrates such as Ng/RC3, neuromodulin, and MARCKS (23Huang F.L. Huang K.-P. Sheu F.-S. Osada K. Methods Neurosci. 1993; 18: 127-137Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). For large-scale preparation, 500 g of frozen rat brain were thawed and homogenized with a Polytron homogenizer in 2500 ml of buffer A (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM EGTA, and 10% glycerol) containing 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The homogenate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min, filtered through glass wool, and precipitated with 2.2% HClO4, and the supernatant was neutralized with KOH. Following removal of KClO4by centrifugation, the supernatant was concentrated by ultrafiltration (Amicon YM-5 membrane) and dialyzed with buffer A by repetitive dilution/concentration inside the ultrafiltration chamber. The concentrated solution was applied to a DEAE-cellulose column (1.6 × 10 cm, packed in a Pharmacia Biotech HR 16/10 column) equilibrated with buffer A, and the flow-through fractions were collected and further concentrated by ultrafiltration. These fractions were purified by high pressure liquid chromatography using a Vydac C4reversed-phase column (214TP510, 10 × 250 mm) eluted with a 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid/0.1% trifluoroacetic acid + 100% acetonitrile gradient. The DNA-binding protein was eluted between 20 and 25% acetonitrile and exhibited a molecular mass of 20 kDa as determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Homogeneous protein was prepared by additional chromatography on a Mono S column (Pharmacia Biotech HR 5/5) eluted with a buffer A/buffer A + 1.0 M KCl gradient. The DNA-binding protein was eluted at 0.4 M KCl. Ng/RC3(−1508/+256) plasmid DNA was digested with ApaI/ PstI and BstEII/ PstI and PKC-γ(−1612/+243) (18Chen K.-H. Widen S.G. Wilson S.H. Huang K.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19961-19965Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with AvrII/ AatII, gel-isolated, dephosphorylated with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase, and end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. The labeled DNA was precipitated with ethanol and dissolved in TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0). The labeled ApaI/ PstI fragment from Ng/RC3 was digested with BstEII to produce a shorter single terminus-labeled probe of the ApaI/ BstEII fragment (−997/−707). The end-labeled Ng/RC3 BstEII/ PstI (−706/−454) and PKC-γ AvrII/ AatII (−979/−691) probes were used directly. Footprinting was performed using the DNase I footprinting system of Life Technologies, Inc. Reaction mixtures (50 μl) containing 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 5% glycerol, 20 μg/ml poly(dI-dC), and 0.3-300 ng of purified protein were incubated at room temperature for 20 min. After the addition of 1 ng of labeled DNA probe, the mixture was further incubated at room temperature for 30 min. DNase I digestion was done at room temperature for 1 min following the addition of 50 μl of DNase I buffer (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.8, containing 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM CaCl2, and 25 mM NaCl) and 40-60 ng of DNase I. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 10 μl of stop buffer (100 mM MES, pH 6.0, containing 150 mM EDTA, 5% SDS, and 250 μg/ml herring sperm DNA), and the products extracted with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1), precipitated with ethanol, and run on an 8% polyacrylamide gel alongside a Maxam-Gilbert sequencing reaction (62Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 499-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (8988) Google Scholar) of the same DNA. Three positive phage recombinants were identified from a Stratagene rat genomic library with a 32P-labeled full-length Ng/RC3 cDNA as a probe. All these phage clones contained an 11-kb EcoRI fragment hybridized positively with the probe. One of them, Ng/RC3-T3, was chosen for further characterization by restriction enzyme mapping and Southern blotting. Digestion of the phage clone with BamHI generated a 4.7-kb fragment hybridized with a 330-bp restriction fragment (BamHI/ XbaI) derived from the 5′-end of Ng/RC3 cDNA. Both 11-kb EcoRI and 4.7-kb BamHI fragments were gel-isolated, subcloned into pGEM3Zf, and characterized by restriction enzyme mapping. Hybridization of the various restriction fragments with oligonucleotide probes derived from the various sequence regions of rat Ng/RC3 cDNA indicated that this genomic clone contained the entire rat Ng/RC3-coding region. The entire 13-kb genomic fragment was sequenced; a restriction map of this genomic clone is shown in Fig. 1(see Fig. 2 for nucleotide sequence).Figure 2:Nucleotide sequence of rat Ng/RC3 gene.

Battenberg E.F. Wong K.K. Bloom F.E. Sutcliffe J.G. J. Neurosci. Res. 1990; 26: 397-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). This gene is composed of four exons and three introns (Fig. 1). The boundaries of the exon/intron junctions conform the consensus 5′-splice donor site of GT and the 3′-splice acceptor site of AG (Table I). The splice acceptor dinucleotide AG is preceded by a CT-rich sequence at the 3′-end of introns 1 and 3, which both contain the sequence TCCTCAG. The splice donor sites of introns 1 and 2 contain the sequence GTGAG. The first exon (274 bp) contains the entire 5′-untranslated region and those coding for the N-terminal 5 amino acids. The second exon (227 bp) contains the region coding for the remaining 73 amino acids and a short tail of 3′-untranslated region. The third exon contains only 18 bp of the 3′-untranslated region, and the fourth exon contains the remaining 3′-untranslated region, which contains two polyadenylation signals (TTTAAT at nucleotide +8152 and AATAAA at nucleotide +8199) located near the end and a long purine tract, A35GA4GA4GA10GA3GA3GA3GA5GA4G. Two prominent transcripts of 1.0 and 1.5 kb that arise by the use of two polyadenylation sites of this gene have been identified from adult rat brain poly(A+) RNA (1Watson J.B. Battenberg E.F. Wong K.K. Bloom F.E. Sutcliffe J.G. J. Neurosci. Res. 1990; 26: 397-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The second and third introns are relatively short as compared with the first one (6.25 kb). This large first intron contains several long A tracts (A13at nucleotide +1811, A20at nucleotide +3944, A12CA6CA6at nucleotide +4198, and A5CA8at nucleotide +6494) and T tracts (T10at nucleotide +5462 and T17at nucleotide +5660) and a 38-nucleotide repeat (nucleotides +4847 to +4884 and nucleotides +5808 to +5845) with one mismatch. In addition, there is a GT-rich segment containing a GTG repeat 20 times within 89 nucleotides (nucleotides +4553 to +4641).Table I:Exon/intron junction sequences of the rat Ng/RC3 gene Open table in a new tab A homology search of the 2 kb upstream from the transcriptional initiation site revealed several potential transcriptional regulatory element sequences for SP1 at nucleotides −208 (GGGCGT), −216 (GGGCGG), and −1544 (CCCAGCCTC); for AP1 at nucleotides −1229 (CTAGTCA), −1393 (TGAATCA), and −1423 (GTGACTAA); and for AP2 at nucleotides −725 (GGGAGGGG), −951 (CCCCACCC), −955 (CCCACCCC), and −1358 (GGGATGGG). The 5′-untranslated region contains an SP1 at nucleotide +22 (CCCGCC) that overlaps with an AP2 at nucleotide +23 (CCGCCCACCC). The proximal promoter region (−300/+1) lacks a TATA box; several homologous ones (24Wobbe C.R. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3859-3867Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) are found within nucleotides −1330 and −410 (TATAAA at nucleotide −1324, TAAATA at nucleotides −1322 and −1274, TATATA at nucleotides −936 and −417, TATTTA at nucleotide −691, TTTAAA at nucleotides −689 and −608, and AATAAA at nucleotides −816 and −768). These AT-rich segments appear at a higher frequency between nucleotides −940 and −600. The Ng/RC3 promoter lacks the sequence elements for binding of steroid hormone receptors including glucocorticoid, estrogen, thyroid, and retinoic acid. Primer extension using a 5′-32P-labeled synthetic deoxyoligonucleotide primer complementary to a region near the 5′-end of Ng/RC3 cDNA (nucleotides +29 to +52) was extended with reverse transcriptase on rat cerebral poly(A+) RNA (Fig. 3). For direct comparison, the same primer was used for single-stranded plasmid sequencing of a PstI/ BamHI genomic fragment (−453/+513) as a marker. A cluster of extension products and several distinct ones of both higher and lower molecular sizes were detected. These findings confirm the previous results of Watson et al. (1Watson J.B. Battenberg E.F. Wong K.K. Bloom F.E. Sutcliffe J.G. J. Neurosci. Res. 1990; 26: 397-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), who demonstrated that Ng/RC3 transcription begins at multiple sites. We have designated the site corresponding to one of the prominent extension products upstream from the clustered ones as the initiation site, which is 10 nucleotides upstream from the 5′-end of Ng/RC3 cDNA. This start site is 259 bp upstream from the translational start site. Several deletion constructs upstream from the translational initiation site fused with a luciferase-carrying reporter plasmid (pGL2) were transfected into 293 cells to characterize the function of the Ng/RC3 promoter.

Major causes for the multiple forms were found to be due to alternative usage of the two different chondroitin sulfate attachment domains (α and β). In this study, genomic DNA analysis has revealed that these domains are encoded by two large exons, exon VII (2880 base pairs) and exon VIII (5229 base pairs). The splice sites of these two exons were consistent with the occurrence of alternative splicing without frameshift. Furthermore, the mouse PG-M gene was shown to have four distinct polyadenylation signals and three candidates for the transcription initiation site as well. These genomic structural variations may contribute to the multiplicity of PG-M transcripts.

However, the mechanism which couples the depletion of the stores to Ca2+influx across the plasma membrane is unclear. Recently, it was proposed that depletion of Ca2+stores might release a novel diffusible messenger (calcium influx factor (CIF)) which opens a specific class of calcium channels (3Randriamampita C. Tsien R.Y. Nature. 1993; 364: 809-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar, 4Parekh A.B. Terlau H. Stuhmer W. Nature. 1993; 364: 814-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate thapsigargin calcium influx factor Hanks' balanced salt solution 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane- N, N, N′, N′-tetraacetic acid high performance thin layer chromatography. We recently reported that activated Jurkat cells produce an intracellular-acting CIF activity measured indirectly as a Ca2+-dependent Cl−current in Xenopus oocytes (5Thomas D. Hanley M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6429-6432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Here we establish that there are different factors which act extracellularly or intracellularly. The partially purified CIF reported here acts exclusively intracellularly to induce the characteristic indicator of elevated cytosolic calcium changes in oocytes, the Ca2+-dependent Cl−current. These results suggest that acid extracts from Jurkat cells are a complex mixture of agents active on calcium metabolism, but an authentic CIF regulating the capacitative Ca2+entry pathway can be selectively purified away from both intracellular discharge and extracellular calcium-elevating activities. Thapsigargin (TG) was purchased from LC Services (Woburn, MA). Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS) and L-15 medium were from Life Technologies, Inc. RPMI 1640 was from BioWhitaker (Walkersville, MD). Bio-Gel P-2 gel was from Bio-Rad. Microcon-30 was from Amicon (Beverly, MA). Sep-Pak cartridge (C18) was from Millipore (Milford, MA). HPTLC plate (200-μm layer) was from Whatman. Jurkat T lymphocytes were maintained in suspension in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mML-glutamine, and penicillin (100 units)/streptomycin (100 μg/ml). Jurkat cells were passaged by 1:10 dilution every 4 days. Crude extracts were prepared from resting and stimulated Jurkat cells as described previously with minor modification (5Thomas D. Hanley M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6429-6432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed three times with HBSS containing 20 mM HEPES. Jurkat cells were stimulated with 1 μM TG for 15 min at 25°C. Cells were centrifuged for 5 min at 200 × g, and the pellet was resuspended in 0.85 ml of HBSS containing 20 mM HEPES. The suspension was extracted with 0.15 M HCl and was incubated for 30 min at 25°C. The extract was clarified by centrifugation for 10 min at 400 × g, and the supernatant was neutralized by addition of 10 M NaOH. After neutralization, 10 mM BaCl2was added to the extract for precipitation of vicinal phosphate compounds, including inositol polyphosphates. Insoluble material was removed from extracts by centrifugation for 5 min at 12,000 × g. The supernatant was lyophilized, and the residue was extracted with methanol with continuous mixing for 15 min at 25°C. The methanol extract (0.8 ml) was loaded on the Sep-Pak C18cartridge for removal of hydrophobic material and was rinsed with methanol (0.8 ml, flow rate: 0.25 ml/min). The methanol eluants were combined (1.6 ml), dried under N2gas (30°C), and resuspended in 0.1 M acetic acid (0.25 ml). The reconstituted extract was clarified by centrifugal ultrafiltration through a Microcon-30 filter. The filtrate is enriched for materials of Mr< 30,000, whereas the retentate is material Mr> 30,000. The filtrate was loaded on the gel filtration column for further purification. The filtrate was loaded onto a Bio-Gel P-2 column (0.7 × 27 cm), equilibrated with 0.1 M acetic acid, and was eluted by the same buffer (7 ml/h), collecting fractions of 0.5 ml. Activity was assayed by measuring Ca2+-dependent Cl−current in Xenopus oocytes under voltage clamp as described previously (5Thomas D. Hanley M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6429-6432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 6Ferguson J.E. Hanley M.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 297: 388-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Fraction 15 from TG-stimulated cell extracts has both extracellular and intracellular activities and is termed “Peak 1.” Fractions 18 and 19 have only intracellular activity, and were pooled to form “Peak 2.” Peak 1 was applied to a 200-μm HPTLC plate and developed with chloroform/methanol/acetic acid/water (20/15/8/4, v/v). Peak 1 was resolved into at least five bands using UV detection. Each identified band was scraped from the plate, extracted with 0.1 M acetic acid, and lyophilized. Each fraction was then reconstituted in 50 μl of buffer (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.0) and activity tested extracellularly and intracellularly by measuring Ca2+-dependent Cl−current in Xenopus oocytes. Each fraction was tested for activity by measuring Ca2+-dependent Cl−currents under voltage clamp conditions. Xenopus laevis oocytes were obtained by ovarectomy. Follicular cells were removed from oocytes by treating with collagenase (2 mg/ml) for 1 h and 45 min, followed by rolling oocytes on plastic Petri dishes. Defolliculated oocytes were maintained in modified L-15 medium (diluted 1:1 with 30 mM HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.25% chicken ovalbumin, 1 mML-glutamine, and 50 μg/ml gentamycin). Conventional two-electrode voltage clamping was performed as described previously (5Thomas D. Hanley M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6429-6432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 6Ferguson J.E. Hanley M.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 297: 388-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Oocyte injections were performed using the Picospritzer (General Valve Corp, Fairfield, NJ) pressure injection apparatus. Oocytes were voltage-clamped at −60 mV in OR2 medium (82.5 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM Na2HPO4, 5 mM HEPES, pH 7.4) and were injected with 10 nl of each chromatographic fraction. Currents were digitized using the Tl-1 A/D board (Axon Instruments Inc., Foster City, CA) in combination with the current analysis program SCAN (Dagan Corp., Minneapolis, MN). We have shown previously that acidic extracts from TG-stimulated Jurkat lymphocytes have intracellular activity in activating a calcium influx pathway (5Thomas D. Hanley M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6429-6432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). We now report that these extracts also exhibit extracellular activity on oocytes in stimulating the Ca2+-dependent Cl−current. This extracellular response was, however, unlike the intracellular activity, in that extracellular responses have no dependence on extracellular calcium (Fig. 1). This is similar to the earlier report of extracellular CIF activity (3Randriamampita C. Tsien R.Y. Nature. 1993; 364: 809-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar), but the dramatic difference in sensitivity to extracellular calcium removal suggested that these intracellular and extracellular activities were not the same and were therefore attributable to distinct and independent factors. Accordingly, in order to purify intracellularly acting CIF activity from Jurkat cell extracts, we have introduced a sequence of purification steps: 1) Sep-Pak reverse-phase columns, 2) Microcon-30 ultrafiltration, 3) Bio-Gel P-2 gel filtration, and 4) HPTLC. The activities were not retained on reverse phase cartridges or by a high molecular weight cut-off filter. The first separation of the activities into distinct fractions was observed on gel filtration (Fig. 2). Two active fractions were obtained. The first, called Peak 1, with an estimated molecular weight of 600, exhibited both extracellular and intracellular activities. The second, called Peak 2, with an estimated molecular weight of 400, exhibited exclusively intracellular activity (Fig. 2 B). The fractionation of extracts from unstimulated Jurkat cells (Fig. 2 A) was compared to that from TG-stimulated cells. Peak 2, which is only active by intracellular injection, was unaffected by TG stimulation. Although the extracellular activity of Peak 1 was also unaffected by TG stimulation, the intracellular activity of Peak 1 was specifically augmented (Fig. 2 A). These results suggest Peak 1 is heterogenous and contains two distinct factors, the intracellular, but not the extracellular, activity being produced by depletion of Ca2+stores. Therefore, the intracellularly active component in Peak 1 is a candidate for an authentic CIF. In order to compare the intracellular activity of Peak 1 to the previously reported properties of crude acid extracts (5Thomas D. Hanley M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6429-6432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), the effect of external calcium removal was examined. Using calcium-free medium (containing 1 mM EGTA) only 40% of the current could be blocked, indicating the remaining response was due to calcium discharge. This incomplete external calcium dependence of the current response was unlike that of crude acid extracts and was confirmed using extracellular medium containing 0.5 mM Ni2+as a Ca2+entry channel blocker (7Petersen C.C. Berridge M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32246-32253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Under these conditions, the response was also blunted by about 40% (Fig. 3). These results suggested that the intracellular activity of Peak 1 contained factors influencing both calcium entry as well as calcium mobilization from stores. The calcium discharge activity can be ascribed to a contaminant in that it is completely lost by a 1:4 dilution. Using such diluted extracts, the response to microinjection is not reduced, but shows complete extracellular calcium dependence (data not shown). Thus, in order to resolve authentic CIF from contaminating discharge activities, Peak 1 was further fractionated using HPTLC. Peak 1 was indeed heterogeneous and separated into at least five bands detectable under UV light. Two bands exhibited significant intracellular activity, but the extracellular activity of Peak 1 was resolved from both of these bands (data not shown). Thus, the intracellular and extracellular activities of Peak 1 are completely separated by this procedure. One HPTLC-purified band (RF= 0.57) elicited current responses, exclusively on microinjection and not on external application, that were eliminated by extracellular free calcium removal or addition of extracellular NiCl2(Fig. 4). In unstimulated cells, this band is completely absent. These results suggest that this HPTLC-enriched fraction contains authentic CIF. In previous work, we have reported that a novel CIF can be identified by intracellular injection of oocytes with extracts from TG-activated cells. However, the issue of the possible extracellular activity of CIF remained unresolved. The results reported here demonstrate that extracellular activity can be detected by external application of CIF-containing extracts to oocytes, but that it is attributable to a factor distinct from an authentic CIF. Moreover, the acid extracts are surprisingly complex in the diversity of distinct components active on calcium elevation. We have identified two size fractions on gel filtration which are active. The smaller size fraction, of approximately 400, is an intriguing and unexpected activity in that it induces calcium discharge by an InsP3-independent mechanism (data not shown). However, this has not been characterized further, other than its activity is unaffected by alkaline phosphatase treatment. The larger size fraction, of approximately 600 daltons, contains distinct and separable extracellular and intracellular factors. Only the latter, resolved by HPTLC, is a candidate for authentic CIF based on 1) its increased levels in cell extracts following thapsigargin treatment and 2) its distinctive profile of biological activity, eliciting calcium entry, but not discharge, exclusively by intracellular application. Thus, extracts thought to contain a single active component have, by this analysis, proven to have at least three distinct factors regulating calcium-dependent currents from external or intracellular sites of action in Xenopus oocytes. This introduces a significant complication in efforts to identify CIF activities in crude extracts.

We have determined that the activities of these two sequences are insufficient to account for the entire activity of the 132-base pair core. Using site-directed linker scan mutagenesis across the core fragment we identified several additional functional sequences. We used one of these functional sequences to screen a λgt11 cDNA expression library resulting in the isolation of cDNA clones encoding the transcription factors ATF-1 (activating transcription factor) and CREM (cyclic AMP response element modulator). Because ATF-1 and CREM are known to bind to cAMP response elements (CRE), this functional sequence was named the κE3′-CRE. We show that dibutyryl cAMP can increase κE3′ enhancer activity, and in transient expression assays ATF-1 caused a 4-5-fold increase in the activity of the core enhancer while CREM-α expression resulted in repression of enhancer activity. RNA analyses showed increased levels of ATF-1 mRNA during B cell development and some changes in CREM transcript processing.

It is made up as a dimer of two related polypeptide chains, designated A and B, which are assembled as homo- or heterodimers (PDGF-AA, PDGF-BB, and PDGF-AB). PDGF has been implicated as a regulator of cell proliferation during development and in wound healing, but also in the stimulation of cell growth in pathological conditions, e.g. atherosclerosis, tissue fibrosis, and tumorigenesis (1Ross R. Raines E.W. Bowen-Pope D.F. Cell. 1986; 46: 155-169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1573) Google Scholar). Two types of PDGF receptors, denoted α- and β-receptors, which display differences in ligand binding specificity, have been described (2Claesson-Welsh L. Westermark B. Sorg C. Biology of Platelet-derived Growth Factor: Cytokines. Vol. 5. S. Karger AG, Basel1993: 31-43Google Scholar). The B-subunit of PDGF binds to both α- and β-receptors with high affinity, whereas the A-subunit only binds to the α- receptor.The sis oncogene of simian sarcoma virus (SSV) encodes a protein that is homologous to the B-chain of PDGF (3Devare S.G.

The impact of suramin, which completely reverted the phenotype of the cells, on signaling via a number of established signal transduction molecules was examined. In the presence of suramin, the general level of tyrosine phosphorylation was decreased. Nevertheless, complexes of autophosphorylated receptors and signal transduction molecules persisted in the cell. To understand the significance of the suramin-resistant receptor-substrate complexes, we examined the state of tyrosine phosphorylation, kinase activity, and/or complex formation of known substrates for the PDGF β-receptor. Our data indicate that suramin treatment caused a marked down-regulation of the activities of certain signal transduction molecules, whereas others were less affected.MATERIALS AND METHODSCells and Tissue CultureNIH 3T3 cells and Sis 3T3 cells (kindly provided by Stuart A.

The rabbit anti-PTP 1D/Syp was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology Inc.125I-PDGF Binding AssayConfluent cells, grown in 12-well Linbro culture dishes in the absence or presence of 100 μM suramin for 24 h, were washed once in Eagle's minimal essential medium, supplemented with 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, and 1% newborn calf serum. 125I-PDGF-BB was added to the medium (0.5 ml/well) to a final concentration of 1 ng/ml and incubated for 1 h on ice. After five washes with Eagle's minimal essential medium, 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 1% newborn calf serum, cell-bound radioactivity was solubilized in 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, for 20 min and determined in a γ-spectrometer. Nonspecific binding was estimated from the extent of binding of 125I-PDGF-BB in the presence of an 80-fold molar excess of unlabeled PDGF. [35S]Methionine Labeling and Immunoprecipitation-For pulse-chase analyses, cells in 25-cm2flasks were labeled in cysteine- and methionine-free MCDB 104 medium supplemented with [35S]methionine at 200 μCi/ml (Amersham; specific activity 3000 Ci/mmol) for 20 min at 37°C. The medium was aspirated, and an appropriate number of cultures were rinsed with PBS and stored at −20°C until lysis. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with a 5-fold excess of methionine was added to the remaining cultures which were incubated at 37°C, for 30, 60, or 90 min. The monolayers were then washed with ice-cold PBS and lysed in 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM EDTA, 1% Trasylol (Bayer), 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF, Sigma). The lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min and the supernatants immunoprecipitated with antibodies specific for PDGF β-receptor (PDGFR-3) for 2 h at 4°C. Protein A-Sepharose CL 4B (Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology Inc.) was used to collect the immune complexes. Precipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer and once with ice-cold water and then eluted by heating the beads at 95°C for 4 min in sample buffer containing 2% SDS, 0.2 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 0.5 M sucrose, 5 mM EDTA, 0.01% bromphenol blue, and 2%β-mercaptoethanol (Carl Roth). After separation by SDS-PAGE, using gels of 7.5% polyacrylamide, the gel was soaked in Amplify (Amersham), dried, and exposed to Hyperfilm MP (Amersham). [32P]Orthophosphate Labeling-Confluent cells treated or not with 100 μM suramin for 24 h were rinsed three times in phosphate-free Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 0.1% fetal calf serum, and 50 μM Na3VO4; 100 μM suramin was included when appropriate. [32P]Orthophosphate (Amersham) was added to a final concentration of 1 mCi/ml, and the cultures were incubated at 37°C for 3 h. One culture flask had been stimulated overnight with 50 ng/ml PDGF-BB; for this culture, PDGF-BB was included during the labeling period. After 3 h of labeling, the remaining culture flasks were stimulated by incubation on ice and PDGF-BB was added at 100 ng/ml; after incubation for 1 h, the cells were returned to 37°C for 7 min. Cells were then washed with ice-cold PBS and solubilized in a lysis buffer consisting of 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM PMSF, 1% Trasylol, 100 μM Na3VO4. The cell lysates were centrifuged and immunoprecipitated as described above for 2 h with PY20. Immunoprecipitates were washed four times with lysis buffer and eluted from the Sepharose beads as described above. Samples were subjected to SDS-gel electrophoresis in a gradient gel of 7-12% polyacrylamide, which after fixation was incubated in 10% glutaraldehyde for 30 min in order to cross-link the proteins to the gel matrix (36Bourassa C. Chapdelaine A. Roberts K.D. Chevalier S. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 169: 356-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The gel was then soaked in 1 M KOH at 55°C for 1 h, to remove serine-bound phosphate (37Cooper J.A. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1981; 1: 165-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), fixed again, dried, and exposed to Hyperfilm MP (Amersham) using an intensifying screen.In Vitro Immune Complex Kinase AssayCells were stimulated overnight with 50 ng/ml PDGF-BB or, alternatively, with 100 ng/ml PDGF-BB for 30 min on ice, followed by 7 min at 37°C. After washing with ice-cold buffer containing 20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 100 μM Na3VO4, cells were solubilized in lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM PMSF, 1% Trasylol, 100 μM Na3VO4, 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT). The lysates were then centrifuged and the supernatants subjected to immunoprecipitation with affinity purified HL-2 antibodies (specific for the PDGF β-receptor; Ref. 31) for 2 h at 4°C, followed by incubation with protein A-Sepharose CL 4B. The beads were washed four times with the lysis buffer and once with 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 100 μM Na3VO4. Kinase assay was performed in 40 μl of 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 10 mM MnCl, 1 mM DTT, containing 5 μCi [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham; specific activity 3000 Ci/mmol) for 10 min at 4°C. The kinase reaction was terminated by addition of 40 μl of 2 × sample buffer for SDS-PAGE and heating at 95°C for 4 min. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE in a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel, which was fixed, cross-linked, and treated with 1 M KOH, as described above.Src Kinase AssayCells were stimulated and solubilized in the lysis buffer as described above for immune complex kinase assay, but without DTT. Src protein was immunoprecipitated with a monoclonal antibody, mAb 327. After washing, immune complex Src kinase assay was performed as described above. As an exogenous substrate for the Src kinase, acid-activated rabbit muscle enolase (Sigma) was used, as described previously (38Cooper J.A. Esch F.S. Taylor S.S. Hunter T. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 7835-7841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).PI 3-Kinase AssayCells were stimulated as described above, rinsed with PBS supplemented with 100 μM Na3VO4, and solubilized for 10 min on ice with 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 100 μM Na3VO4, 1% Trasylol, and 1 mM PMSF. Clarified cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with PDGFR-3 and collected as described above. The immobilized immune complexes were then washed three times with PBS containing 1% Nonidet P-40, once with PBS, once with 0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 M LiCl, once with distilled water, and once with 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM EDTA; all washes were at 0°C. The beads were suspended in 50 μl of 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM EGTA, and 0.2 mg/ml phosphatidylinositol (PI) (Sigma); this solution had been sonicated for 15 min at 4°C before use. A preincubation was performed at room temperature for 10 min. Twenty μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and MgCl2(final concentration, 10 mM) were added and samples were incubated for another 10 min. Reactions were stopped by addition of chloroform, methanol, 11.6 M HCl (50:100:1), phospholipids were extracted with chloroform and the organic phase washed with methanol, 1 M HCl (1:1). Reaction products were concentrated in vacuo, dissolved in chloroform, spotted on Silica Gel-60 plates (Merck) impregnated with 1% potassium oxalate and resolved by chromatography in chloroform, methanol, 28% ammonia, water (43:38:5:7) for 45 min. Phosphorylated products were detected by autoradiography on RX films.Raf-1 Kinase AssayCell lysates from Sis 3T3 and NIH 3T3 were immunoprecipitated with 1.5 μg/ml Raf-1 polyclonal antiserum (C-12). Immune complexes were washed three times in lysis buffer and once in kinase buffer containing 30 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 20 mM MgCl2, and 1 mM DTT, before being resuspended in 30 μl of kinase assay mixture containing kinase buffer, 0.5 μg of recombinant baculovirus-expressed catalytically inactive MEK (39Cook S.J. McCormick F. Science. 1993; 262: 1069-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar), 2 μM ATP, and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP/sample. Incubation was for 30 min at 30°C and was terminated by the addition of 40 μl of hot 2 × SDS-PAGE sample buffer, followed by incubation for 5 min at 95°C. Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE (7-12% polyacrylamide gels), and gels were destained, dried, and subjected to autoradiography.Immunoblotting of PLC-γ, GAP, Src, and ShcCells were washed with PBS and lysed in a buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM PMSF, 1% Trasylol, 100 μM Na3VO4. Immunoprecipitations were performed as described above. The samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond C extra; Amersham) in a buffer consisting of 20% methanol, 0.2 M glycine, and 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, at 400 mA for 3-4 h at 4°C. Blots were blocked by incubation in phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% dried milk and 0.05% Tween 20 (Merck) for 1 h at room temperature. Alternatively, the blots were blocked with phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% bovine serum albumin and 0.05% Tween 20 before probing with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (PY20). Blots were then incubated with different antisera. The blots were washed three times for 10 min in PBS containing 0.05% Tween-20 and then incubated with the peroxidase-conjugated swine anti-rabbit or sheep anti-mouse immunoglobulins (1:5000 and 1:1000 dilutions, respectively). After washing, bound antibodies were visualized using the ECL Western blotting detection system (Amersham). The blots were reprobed after removal of the first probe by incubation in 100 mMβ-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, for 40 min at 60°C, with occasional agitation.Precipitation Using Gst-Grb2 and Gst-PI 3-K Fusion ProteinCultures of bacteria expressing GST-SH2 Grb2 or Gst-SH2 p85 PI 3-K were grown for 3 h at 37°C in LB medium containing 0.5 mM isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactropyranoside. Bacteria were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in 300 μl/sample 1% Triton X-100 in PBS, 2 mM EDTA, 0.1%β-mercaptoethanol, 0.2 mM PMSF, 1% Trasylol, and lysed by sonication. The lysate was then clarified by centrifugation and the supernatant was incubated with glutathione-Sepharose (600 μl of packed beads) (Pharmacia) for 30 min at 4°C. The glutathione-Sepharose was washed three times with the lysis buffer and then incubated with different cell lysates (70 μl/sample) for 2 h at 4°C. The samples were then washed five times with a lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM PMSF, 1% Trasylol, 100 μM Na3VO4and once with ice-cold water, eluted and denatured by heating at 95°C for 4 min in SDS-sample buffer, resolved on SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by immunoblotting.RESULTSCharacterization of the Effect of Suramin on Sis-transformed NIH 3T3 CellsWe initially analyzed the effect of suramin on NIH 3T3 cells transfected with the PDGF B-chain cDNA and therefore expressing elevated levels of PDGF-BB (described in Ref. 24; in this study denoted Sis 3T3 cells). In the absence of suramin, the cells exhibited a transformed phenotype (Fig. 1 A, left). In a previous study, the response of Sis 3T3 cells to different concentrations of suramin were analyzed (24Fleming T.P. Matsui T. Molloy C.J. Robbins K.C. Aaronson S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8063-8067Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In agreement with their results, we found that treatment with 100 μM suramin for 24 h led to an apparently complete reversion of the transformed phenotype (Fig. 1 A, right). In the following experiments, cells treated with suramin were examined microscopically before use to ensure that they displayed the expected reverted morphology.Through its effect on the interaction between PDGF and its receptors, suramin treatment leads to an increased number of ligand-accessible cell surface PDGF receptors on human fibroblasts transfected with v- sis (40Johnsson A. Betsholtz C. Heldin C.-H. Westermark B. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 1535-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). This was also the case for suramin-treated Sis 3T3 cells, as demonstrated by use of a radioreceptor assay (Fig. 1 B); incubation of suramin-treated Sis 3T3 cells with 125I-PDGF-BB revealed a considerably increased number of specific ligand-accessible binding sites, as compared to untreated cells. This result shows that suramin treatment did not disrupt synthesis and transport of PDGF receptors to the cell surface.The turnover rate of the PDGF receptors on fibroblasts is increased in the presence of PDGF (41Claesson-Welsh L. Rönnstrand L. Heldin C.-H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8796-8800Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The increase in number of cell surface PDGF receptors in the suramin-treated Sis 3T3 cells could therefore, at least in part, be due to a disruption of ligand-dependent down-regulation of the receptors. The results from pulse-chase analysis of [35S]methionine-labeled Sis 3T3 cells (Fig. 1 C) gave credit to this assumption, in agreement with previous studies (23Keating M.T. Williams L.T. Science. 1988; 239: 914-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 42Huang S.S. Huang J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12608-12618Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, as a result of suramin treatment, the mature form of the PDGF β-receptor accumulated, whereas this form was hardly visible in the untreated cells.Analysis of Tyrosine-phosphorylated Proteins in Suramin-treated and Untreated Sis 3T3 Cells by in Vivo LabelingIn order to analyze PDGF receptor-mediated signal transduction in Sis 3T3 cells, in the presence and absence of suramin, [32P]orthophosphate labeling of the cells was performed, followed by immunoprecipitation with anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibodies (PY20) and SDS-PAGE analysis. Untransfected NIH 3T3 cells, stimulated with exogenous PDGF-BB for different time periods were included in this experiment, for comparison. The duration of stimulation with PDGF-BB was either 7 min or overnight; in the latter case, the intention was to create a condition of “chronic stimulation” more closely mimicking the situation in the Sis 3T3 cells. As seen in Fig. 2, the overall level of tyrosine phosphorylation was decreased in the suramin-treated Sis 3T3 cells. However, a component in the Sis 3T3 cells, which according to its migration rate corresponded to the precursor form of the PDGF β-receptor, exhibited markedly preserved phosphorylation after suramin treatment. Quantification showed that 66% of phosphorylated precursor remained after suramin treatment, whereas the level of phosphorylated mature receptors was reduced to 6% in the suramin-treated cells, as compared to un"

Neither substrate alone protected uridine phosphorylase from inactivation. The presence of phosphate did not affect the Kiand k2values. The addition of uracil or uridine led to a significant increase of both Ki(to 2.5 or 2.1 mM, respectively) and k2(to 6.1 or 4.8 min−1, respectively) values. Thus, WRK could react in accordance with slow (high affinity) and fast (low affinity) mechanisms. Combined addition of phosphate and uracil completely protected uridine phosphorylase. Tryptic digestion yielded a single modified peptide (Ser4-Asp(WRK)-Val-Phe-His-Leu-Gly-Leu-Thr-Lys13). Treatment of the modified enzyme with hydroxylamine led to removal of the bulky WRK residue and replacement of the Asp5carboxyl by a hydroxamic group. The enzyme thus obtained recovered about 10% of initial specific activity, whereas its substrate binding ability changed only moderately; the Kmvalues for phosphate and uridine were changed from 5.1 and 0.19 mM (or 7.3 and 0.14 mM according to Leer et al. (Leer, J. C., Hammer-Jespersen, K., and M. Schwartz (1977) Eur. J. Biochem. 75, 217-224)) to 22.6 and 0.12 m M, respectively. The hydroxamic enzyme had higher thermostability than the native enzyme. The results obtained demonstrated the importance of the carboxyl at position 5. The loss of activity after selective group replacement is due to impaired stabilization of the transition state rather than to a decline in substrate affinity or change of the active site structure.

We have also investigated the effects of ionic strength and of a bipolar aprotic solvent on the rate of enzyme-catalyzed uridine phosphorolysis and have selectively modified both uridine- and phosphate-binding subsites to demonstrate that active site hydrophobicity increases upon enzyme-substrate complex formation (Komissarov et al., 1994bKomissarov A.A.

The data obtained support the view that enzymatic uridine phosphorolysis proceeds by the Sn2 mechanism with phosphate activation due to its desolvation in the enzyme active site. In this paper, we report the kinetic mechanism of selective modification of E. coli uridine phosphorylase with Woodward's reagent K and describe the location of an important dicarboxylic amino acid residue in the enzyme active site. Woodward's reagent K (WRK), Tris, TPCK-trypsin, endoproteinase from Staphylococcus aureus strain V8, uridine (Urd), uracil (Ura), 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoate), trifluoroacetic acid, SDS, and acrylamide were obtained from Sigma. Sephadex G-50M was from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Acetonitrile was from Aldrich. All other chemicals were of reagent or analytical grade and were used without further purification. UPase was isolated from the E. coli K12 overproducing strain (kindly provided by Prof. A. S. Mironov, GNII Genetika, Moscow) as described previously (Mikhailov et al., 1992Mikhailov A.M.

The resulting enzyme was homogeneous in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Laemmli, 1970Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206961) Google Scholar), had a specific activity of 100-120 units/mg (25°C), and an A280/ A260ratio of 1.74-1.78. The UPase activity was assayed with a Graficord UV-240 spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Japan) according to Magni, 1978Magni G.

Schwartz M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 75: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Fresh WRK solutions (1.0-10.0 mM) in cold 0.1 mM HCl were made for each experiment. The enzyme (0.16 μM) was incubated at 20°C with varying WRK concentrations (10-200 μM) in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.1. The control sample was incubated under the same conditions without the reagent. At various times (0-5 min), aliquots of 5-20 μl were withdrawn from both incubation mixtures to measure the activity. Protection against inactivation was assessed with the following substrates and products added to the enzyme solution 10 min before WRK was added: 100 mM Pi, 5 mM Urd, 5 mM Ura, and 5 mM Urd plus 100 mM Pior 5 mM Ura plus 100 mM Pi. Stoichiometry of WRK incorporation into UPase was measured after exposing the enzyme (36 μM) to WRK (10-200 μM) for 5 min. Modified UPase was isolated by gel filtration on a Sephadex G-50M column in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.1. The number of modified carboxyls was estimated from the peak absorbance (about 350 nm) but using a published extinction coefficient of 7000 M−1cm−1at 340 nm (Sinha and Brever, 1985Sinha U. Brever J.M. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 151: 327-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Free SH groups of the modified enzyme were titrated with 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoate) by the method of Ellman, 1959Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (21351) Google Scholar in the presence of 6 M guanidine HCl. The residual activity of the enzyme samples obtained was determined as above and expressed as a percentage of initial activity. Enzyme samples treated in a similar manner in the presence of an equilibrium substrate-product mixture (addition of 5 mM Urd and 100 mM phosphate) served as control. The enzyme modified with WRK (5 mg) was lyophilized and dissolved in 0.1 ml of 6 M guanidine HCl; then 0.9 ml of 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, was added. Modified UPase was incubated with TPCK-trypsin or S. aureus proteinase V8(1:50, w/w) at 37°C for 6 h. The digest was centrifuged, and the supernatant was lyophilized, dissolved in a small volume of distilled water, and applied to a Zorbax PEP RP/1 (DuPont NEN) column equilibrated with solvent A (20 mM sodium phosphate, pH 6.0). HPLC was carried out using a Gilson model 704 apparatus, and absorbance at 215 and 340 nm was detected with a model 116 detector (Gilson) and Lambda-Max LC model 481 Spectrophotometer (Waters Co.). Peptides were eluted with a linear gradient of solvent B (20 mM sodium phosphate, pH 6.0, in 60% acetonitrile, 40% H2O (v/v)) (System 1) from 0 to 50% (1%/min). The flow rate was 1.0 ml/min. Peaks absorbing at both 215 and 340 nm were collected and lyophilized. Then the dry material was dissolved in a minimal volume of distilled water and injected into the same column equilibrated with 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid in H2O (System 2). Rechromatographed peptides were eluted with a 0-40% gradient of acetonitrile (1%/min). The flow rate was 1.0 ml/min. All separations were performed at room temperature. Approximately 10 nmol of the WRK-modified peptides obtained from HPLC separations in System 1 were lyophilized and redissolved in 0.1 ml of 50 mM Tris-HCl at pH 7.5. The V8and tryptic peptides were further digested with TPCK-trypsin or S. aureus V8proteinase, respectively (see above). The digests obtained were resolved in System 2 as described above. Modified peptide sequencing was carried out in the laboratory of Prof. T. A. Egorov (Institute of Molecular Biology, Russian Academy of Science, Moscow) using an Knauer model 910 sequencer. The WRK-modified enzyme (5 mg; residual activity less than 1%) was incubated with 1.5 M hydroxylamine, pH 6.8, for 1 h at 25°C. A control sample of native UPase was incubated with hydroxylamine under the same conditions. At various times (0-60 min), aliquots of 5-20 μl were withdrawn from both samples. Hydroxamic UPase was isolated by gel filtration on a Sephadex G-50M column in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.1. The protein was again consecutively treated with WRK and hydroxylamine and purified as above. The number of modified carboxyl groups and the restitution of activity were determined (see above). The Kmfor phosphate and uridine and Vmax were determined at pH 7.1 at 25°C and compared with the literature data (Leer et al., 1977Leer J.C. Hammer-Jespersen K. Schwartz M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 75: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar; Vita et al., 1986Vita A. Amici A. Cacciamani T. Lanciotti M. Magni G. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1986; 18: 431-436Google Scholar). The thermostability of native and hydroxamic enzymes was assessed by the apparent inactivation rate constants at 55 and 60°C without ligands and with 5 mM Urd or 100 mM Pi, pH 7.1. The Enzfitter program (version 1.05 (H)) was used to analyze the obtained data. Data are the means of at least two separate experiments. Incubation of UPase with WRK at pH 7.1 resulted in a time- and concentration-dependent loss of enzymic activity (Fig. 1 A). Semilog plots of residual activity versus time at various concentrations of WRK are not linear after 4 min of incubation, probably because of the reagent decomposition (Petra, 1971Petra P. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 3163-3170Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). A plot of the observed rate constants (kobs) versus reagent concentration (over the range 10-200 μM; Fig. 1 B) shows saturation kinetics. The reagent can therefore be thought to bind reversibly to the enzyme before covalent modification takes place, where E is UPase, I is WRK, E∗I is the complex of UPase with WRK, E-I is the modified enzyme, Kiis the apparent E∗I dissociation constant, and k2is the intrinsic rate constant for covalent modification of UPase. The observed inactivation rate constant (kobs) can be expressed as kobs= k2/(1 + Ki/[I]) or 1/ kobs= 1/ k2+ Ki/ k2+[I]. Fig. 1B shows the reciprocal plot of kobs versus WRK concentration. This plot yields Ki= 0.07 ± 0.011 mM and k2= 1.2 ± 0.13 min−1. The absorption spectrum of the modified enzymes has a band at about 350 nm, consistent with an enol ester (formed in the reaction of WRK with a carboxyl; Fig. 2 A) but with a red shift (see “Discussion”). The extent of inactivation correlated with the reagent incorporation, and the data in Fig. 2 B indicate that the enzyme is inactivated upon modification of less than two carboxyls in its subunit. Under an excess of enzyme (36 μM UPase and 20 μM WRK), 30% inactivation is concomitant with incorporation of 0.4 mol of reagent/mol of subunit. Complete inactivation with WRK is not accompanied by a decrease in free sulfhydryl groups (three/UPase subunit) (Walton et al., 1989Walton L. Richards C.A. Elwell L.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6741Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar; Bose and Yamada, 1974Bose R. Yamada E.W. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 2051-2056Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). An attempt was made to infer the place of reagent binding in the UPase active site from the influence of substrates and products on enzyme inactivation. The kobsin the presence of various ligands is shown in Table I. The inactivation of UPase with 0.2 mM WRK was not prevented by preincubation of the enzyme with any ligand used alone. However, almost complete protection was observed upon simultaneous addition of 5 mM uracil and 100 mM phosphate or 5 mM uridine and 100 mM phosphate (equilibrium substrate-product mixture) (Table I).Table I:Effects of substrates, products, and their analogs on inactivation rate constant (kobs) and Ki and k2 values (Scheme 1) Open table in a new tab To examine the protection mechanism of the product (Ura) and substrate (Pi) combination, the dependence of the kobson the concentration of one ligand (Pior Ura) at a saturating concentration of the other one was determined (Fig. 3). The data obtained suggest that the synergistic protective effect is only due to simultaneous filling of the corresponding subsites in the UPase active site (Km= 7.3 and 0.24 mM, respectively) (Leer et al., 1977Leer J.C. Hammer-Jespersen K. Schwartz M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 75: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). It should be noted that filling of ribose and phosphate subsites with deoxyribose 1-phosphate or ribose and uracil subsites with Urd provided no protection against inactivation with WRK (Table I). Furthermore the Kiand k2values (Scheme 1 Scheme 2) were determined under the conditions of saturation with Pi, Urd, and Ura (Table I). The binding of phosphate in the active site of UPase does not affect the inactivation kinetics. The binding of uridine and uracil strongly diminishes the enzyme affinity for the inhibitor (Ki= 2.1 and 2.5 mM, respectively) but significantly increases the k2(from 1.2 to 4.8 and 6.1 min−1, respectively). These results probably reflect the existence of two mechanisms of WRK interaction with UPase: high affinity (slow) and low affinity (fast). Comparison of the values obtained under saturation with Urd and Ura also confirms the suggestion that binding at the ribose subsite does not appreciably influence the reagent affinity and the inactivation rate (Table I).SCHEME 2View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) After digestion with trypsin or S. aureus proteinase V8, the resulting peptides were initially resolved by reversed-phase HPLC at pH 6.0 (System 1). Under these conditions the enol ester is stable enough for the modified peptide to be isolated. The elution profile of the tryptic peptides (Fig. 4 A) showed a single peak absorbing at both 215 and 340 nm. When the V8peptides were eluted in an analogous manner from the same column, a single peak of absorbance at 340 nm was eluted 3 min later (data not shown). The tryptic and V8peptides were further digested with proteinase V8and trypsin, respectively, and analyzed by HPLC using System 2. Only the V8peptide showed a change in retention time after additional trypsin treatment (Fig. 4 B) (coincidence with tryptic and tryptic-plus-V8peptides). These results suggested that the tryptic peptide did not contain V8cleavage sites. After rechromatography of the tryptic modified peptide (Fig. 4 B), the amino acid sequence was determined by automatic Edman degradation. The first six residues of the peptide coincided with those in the tryptic peptide Ser-Asp-Val-Phe-His-Leu-Gly-Leu-Thr-Lys occupying positions 4-13 in the UPase (Walton et al., 1989Walton L. Richards C.A. Elwell L.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6741Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Thus, the only dicarboxylic amino acid, Asp5, was modified with WRK. Because the WRK residue was eliminated during Edman degradation, Asp5was determined as a phenylthiohydantoin. The modified peptide was isolated and sequenced twice from different specimens of modified UPase. The WRK residue in the active center may cause steric obstacles resulting in complete enzyme inactivation; therefore the possible role of Asp5in the mechanism of the enzymatic uridine phosphorolysis remains unclear. It is known that the enol ester formed upon selective modification of the Asp5carboxyl by WRK readily reacts with some nucleophilic agents that substitute for the bulky WRK residue. Thus after reaction with hydroxylamine the Asp5carboxyl proves to be selectively replaced by a hydroxamic group. In this case the possible steric conflicts in the active site are negligible, because only two atoms (NH) are added in comparison with the initial structure (Fig. 5). The native enzyme is not inactivated upon incubation with hydroxylamine. To ensure completeness of the reaction, consecutive treatment of the enzyme with WRK and hydroxylamine was done twice. The control sample was treated in the presence of an equilibrium mixture of substrates and products of the UPase reaction. The hydroxamic UPase thus obtained retained about 10% of the initial activity (the control sample retained about 75% activity and exhibited the same properties as native UPase). The increase in specific activity of the modified enzyme (from <1 to about 10%) observed upon hydroxylamine treatment and accompanied by a decline in absorbance at 350 nm appears to reflect the removal of the WRK residue. Both native and hydroxamic UPase preparations demonstrated equal mobility in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence or absence of 2-mercaptoethanol. However, they demonstrated quite different behavior with respect to inactivation by WRK. With the hydroxamic enzyme the inactivation was 10 times slower and probably reflected nonspecific interaction of the agent with other carboxyls (Table II). Thus it could be suggested that selective replacement of an essential carboxyl has been achieved. To ascertain the cause of the observed differences in specific activities, the Vmax and Kmvalues with individual substrates were determined (Table II). Although the Kmvalues for native and hydroxamic UPases differ only slightly, the maximal rate for the modified enzyme is less than one-tenth of that for the native one. Selective group replacement at Asp5results in a marked increase in enzyme thermostability (Table I), so that after a long enough incubation the residual specific activity of the hydroxamic enzyme may exceed that of the native one by an order of magnitude.Table II:Properties of the native and hydroxamic enzymes Open table in a new tab As is evident from Fig. 1, WRK inactivates the E. coli UPase with pseudo first-order kinetics. The deviation from linearity in semilog plots (Fig. 1 A) after 4 min is most likely due to reagent decomposition. The data in Fig. 1 B comply with the two-step mechanism in Scheme 1, with Ki= 0.07 ± 0.01 mM and k2= 1.2 ± 0.1 min−1. The band at 350 nm appearing in the enzyme spectrum upon modification with WRK (Fig. 2 A) is indicative of an enol ester arising from interaction between WRK and a carboxyl, with allowance for the red shift recently observed in an analogous study with fluorescein 5′-isothiocyanate (Komissarov et al., 1994bKomissarov A.A. Moltchan O.K. Romanova D.V. Debabov V.G. FEBS Lett. 1994; 355: 192-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Hence we can conclude that UPase is inactivated by modification of a dicarboxylic amino acid. There are 28 free carboxyls in each UPase subunit (Walton et al., 1989Walton L. Richards C.A. Elwell L.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6741Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and WRK can also react with amino and sulfhydryl groups. However, the avidity of WRK for the active site permits unambiguous identification of the target residue. Exposure of the enzyme to a substoichiometric amount of WRK (Fig. 2 B) results in 30% inactivation upon modification of about 0.4 mol of residue/mol of subunit; quantitation of the spectral changes evoked by the WRK treatment in the absence and in the presence of protective agents (not shown) also testifies to modification of a single essential carboxyl. Again, no appreciable decrease in the number of free SH groups was found for the WRK-modified enzyme. Analysis of the effect of ligands on the inactivation with WRK (Table I) revealed three subsites (uracil, phosphate, and ribose) in the enzyme active center, just as expected from the chemistry of uridine phosphorolysis. The addition of phosphate or uracil (one subsite filled) or uridine or deoxyribose-1-phosphate (two subsites filled) alone at concentrations exceeding the respective Kmdoes not protect the enzyme from inactivation by WRK (Table I). Only when the uracil and the phosphate subsites are occupied simultaneously is the enzyme almost completely protected (Table I and Fig. 3). The presence of an equilibrium mixture of substrates and products of the enzymatic reaction also provides nearly complete protection against WRK. Concurrent filling of the ribose subsite has no effect on the inactivation, indicating that WRK perhaps does not interact with this subsite. Taken alone, Pidoes not change the Kiand k2values, whereas Ura or Urd markedly diminish the inhibitor binding (Table I). Comparison of Table I with the relevant literature data (Table III) demonstrates that WRK has an unusually high affinity for the UPase active site, and the inhibition constant is at least an order of magnitude lower than for any other enzyme tested. It is noteworthy that upon filling of the uracil subsite the Kivalue becomes comparable with those in Table III; hence we may conclude that the marked selectivity of WRK toward UPase is mainly due to interactions at the uracil subsite.Table III:Kinetic parameters of inactivation of some enzymes with WRK Open table in a new tab HPLC analysis of the proteolytic digests (Fig. 4) provides final proof that WRK reacts with a single dicarboxylic amino acid in the UPase subunit (incidentally, the minor peaks at 340 nm most likely account for the slight excess over equimolarity seen in Fig. 2B). As shown by Edman degradation, it is Asp5according to the sequence of Walton et al. (1989). Its selective modification with WRK completely inactivates the enzyme. However, the functional role of this residue remains uncertain, because activity could be lost simply because of steric hindrances from a bulky reagent in the active site. The activated ester generated by WRK-carboxyl interaction is readily subject to nucleophilic attack (Fig. 5). Thus consecutive treatment of UPase with WRK and hydroxylamine results in removal of the WRK residue and restores the enzyme specific activity from <1 to 20% of the initial. Being again exposed to WRK, such enzyme retains 9% of the initial activity (45% of the 20%) and is not noticeably reactivated with hydroxylamine. Thus, the enzyme preparation obtained after the first round of WRK/hydroxylamine treatment appears to be a mixture of 10% native (restituted; specific activity about 110 units/mg) and 90% hydroxamic UPase (specific activity about 10 units/mg). Only the native form reacts with WRK in the second exposure, and subsequent treatment with hydroxylamine leads to quantitative replacement of the Asp5carboxyl with a hydroxamic group (Fig. 5 and Table II). Inactivation of the resulting enzyme by WRK is an order of magnitude slower (Table II) and probably reflects nonspecific interactions. Comparison of the kinetic parameters for the native and the hydroxamic enzymes demonstrates that the modification only slightly raises the apparent Kmfor Piand Urd but significantly diminishes the Vmax (Table II). It appears that the Asp5carboxyl is not crucial for substrate binding but is dynamically involved in catalysis. Another interpretation of the data obtained might be that Asp5takes part in maintaining the native enzyme conformation. In such a case, however, the modification should have impaired the stability of hydroxamic UPase as compared with the control; instead we see that the thermostability of the modified enzyme is substantially enhanced (Table II). Thus we believe that the Asp5residue is essential for the catalytic step proper rather than for substrate binding or conformation. On the other hand, the hydroxamic substituent may afford additional hydrogen bonds; because the amino-terminal part of the UPase subunit is probably involved in active site formation, this may have significant structural and conformational effects and be the cause of enhanced enzyme thermostability. The results obtained point to the importance of the negatively charged carboxyl at position 5 and confirm the suggestion that the loss of activity after selective Asp5modification is due to impaired stabilization of the transition state rather than to a decrease in substrate affinity. The suggestion above is in agreement with the results on glycosidases and glycosyltransferases. It was consistently shown that in these enzymes a carboxyl group mediates glycosyl transfer (Mooser et al., 1991Mooser G. Hefta S.A. Paxton R.J. Shively J.E. Lee T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8916-8922Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Notwithstanding, additional studies including high resolution x-ray analysis of the enzyme-substrate complex and site-directed mutagenesis are clearly needed to get molecular insight into the enzymatic phosphorolysis of uridine.

https://openalex.org/W2068212637,"To examine the function of conserved noncoding regions in the erythropoietin (Epo) gene, we have prepared clones and pools of Hep3B cells stably transfected with a marked 4.1-kilobase Epo gene and deletions thereof. The marked transcripts had single base substitutions at three sites in the coding portion of Exon 5, enabling them to be distinguished from endogenous Epo mRNA by ribonuclease protection and competitive polymerase chain reaction. The basal expression and hypoxic induction of the marked Epo gene that had no deletions were indistinguishable from that of the endogenous Epo gene. Likewise, deletion of conserved intervening sequence 1 had minimal effect on hypoxic induction. In contrast, a 3′-deletion that included the conserved 3′-enhancer element resulted in a substantial, but not complete, suppression of hypoxic induction while a 3′-deletion downstream of the enhancer resulted in enhancement. A 188-base pair deletion of a conserved 3′-untranslated region in Exon 5 had minimal effect on hypoxic induction. However, the truncated Epo mRNA had a markedly prolonged half-life (15 h) in comparison to the endogenous Epo mRNA (2.0 h) or the marked full-length Epo mRNA (2.1 h). Further deletions in the 3′-UTR showed that a relatively small region of approximately 50 bases is responsible for the relatively rapid turnover of Epo mRNA. These experiments provide information on cis-acting elements of the Epo gene that cannot be obtained from conventional reporter gene transfection experiments."
https://openalex.org/W2074112727,"Two lysine isoacceptor tRNAs corresponding to the codons AAA and AAG, respectively, were isolated from squid (Loligo bleekeri), and their nucleotide sequences were determined. During this analysis, we discovered that the tRNA with the anticodon CUU was efficiently cleaved at a specific site in the presence of magnesium ions, whereas the tRNA with the anticodon UUU was not. Cleavage occurred almost exclusively at the phosphodiester linkage between G15and D16(p16). The most remarkable feature of this cleavage reaction is that the end product was not a 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate but was mainly a 3′-phosphate. Thus, this reaction was distinct from the well characterized cleavage of yeast tRNAPheby lead and from reactions catalyzed by various other metalloribozymes. The presence of a cytidine residue at position 60 was required for efficient cleavage but was not crucial for the reaction, and the entire tRNA molecule had to be intact for this specific and efficient cleavage reaction. The present study provides evidence that there exists a new catalytic mechanism for cleavage of tRNA that exploits biologically ubiquitous ions rather than toxic, nonessential ions such as lead. Two lysine isoacceptor tRNAs corresponding to the codons AAA and AAG, respectively, were isolated from squid (Loligo bleekeri), and their nucleotide sequences were determined. During this analysis, we discovered that the tRNA with the anticodon CUU was efficiently cleaved at a specific site in the presence of magnesium ions, whereas the tRNA with the anticodon UUU was not. Cleavage occurred almost exclusively at the phosphodiester linkage between G15and D16(p16).

INTRODUCTIONThe reaction of yeast tRNAPhewith Pb2+ions at pH 7.0 was the first well characterized example of a metal-promoted site-specific cleavage reaction involving RNA (1Werner C. Krebs B.

Cleavage occurs almost exclusively at the phosphodiester linkage between D17and G18(p18) (1Werner C. Krebs B. Keith G. Dirheimer G. Biochim. Biophys.

Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 5711-5777Crossref Scopus (102) Google Scholar), resulting in the formation of a 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate at D17(2Brown R.S. Hingerty B.E. Dewan J.C. Klug A.

The reaction involves the initial abstraction of a proton from a sugar 2′-OH group at the cleavage site by the ionized lead hydrate, which acts at the metal-binding pocket formed by the D and T loops (2Brown R.S. Hingerty B.E. Dewan J.C. Klug A. Nature. 1983; 303: 543-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 3Brown R.S. Dewan J.C. Klug A. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 4785-4801Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Other cations, such as Zn2+and Eu3+, are also capable of cleaving purified tRNAs at precise locations to yield 2′,3′-cyclic phosphates and 5′-hydroxyl termini (5Ciesiolka J. Marciniec T. Dziedzic P.

Wrzesinski J. Krzyzosiak W.J. FEBS Lett. 1989; 243: 293-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar).Although this seemingly anomalous reaction is not known to have biological relevance, the discovery of catalytic RNAs or ribozymes placed this reaction in a broader mechanistic context (8Cech T.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 543-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar, 9Altman S. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1989; 62: 1-36PubMed Google Scholar). In the first step of the self-splicing reaction of the Tetrahymena ribozyme, a Mg2+or Mn2+ion contributes directly to the reaction by coordination with the 3′ oxygen atom in the transition state, presumably stabilizing the developing negative charge on the leaving group (10Piccirilli J.A. Vyle J.S. Caruthers M.H. Cech T.R. Nature. 1993; 361: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Other ribozymes, such as hammerheads and hairpins, have also been proposed to be essentially metalloribozymes (11Dahm S.C. Uhlenbeck O.C. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9464-9469Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 12Koizumi M. Ohtsuka E. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5145-5150Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar).On the bases of the above described findings, yeast tRNAPhe, which undergoes intramolecular cleavage in the presence of Pb2+ions, has been redesigned to perform the intermolecular cleavage of RNA as a true enzyme (13Sampson J.R. Sullivan F.X. Behlen L.S. DiRenzo A.B. Uhlenbeck O.C. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1987; 52: 267-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 14Deng H.-Y. Termini J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10518-10528Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Pan and Uhlenbeck (15Pan T. Uhlenbeck O.C. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3887-3895Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 16Pan T. Uhlenbeck O.C. Nature. 1992; 358: 560-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) have used an in vitro selection method to produce a series of lead-dependent ribozymes that efficiently cleave RNA substrates with multiple turnover. One particular variant of the “leadzyme” promotes the formation of 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate termini and goes further, catalyzing hydrolysis of the cyclic phosphate to a 3′-terminal phosphate (16Pan T. Uhlenbeck O.C. Nature. 1992; 358: 560-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). This two-step mechanism is commonly exploited by several protein ribonucleases, but it is unique among all ribozymes described to date. The many examples of metal-catalyzed cleavages of tRNA described to date are presumed to resemble, in terms of mechanism, the reactions catalyzed by various other metalloribozymes.In the present report, we provide another example of cation-mediated cleavage of tRNA, in which a Mg2+ion is involved in hydrolysis of a cyclic phosphate to yield a 3′-terminal phosphate, as in the reaction of the “leadzyme.” In the present case, an intact tRNA structure must be preserved if the cleavage reaction is to proceed.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsRNase T1, RNase PhyM, and T4 RNA ligase were purchased from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. (Tokyo, Japan); nuclease P1 was from Yamasa Shoyu (Chiba, Japan); RNase U2, guanosine 2′,3′-cyclic monophosphate 5′-monophosphate (designated pG>p), and guanosine 2′,3′-cyclic monophosphate (designated G>p) were from Sigma; and RNase CL3 was from Boehringer Mannheim Yamanouchi (Tokyo, Japan). Alkaline phosphatase from Escherichia coli and T7 RNA polymerase were obtained from Takara Shuzo (Kyoto, Japan). [5′-32P]pCp, [α-32P]UTP, [α-32P]GTP, and [γ-32P]ATP were from Amersham (Tokyo, Japan). T4 polynucleotide kinase and other chemical reagents were purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Industries (Osaka, Japan).Purification and Determination of the Nucleotide Sequence of Squid tRNAsLys700 g of squid (Loligo bleekeri) were homogenized in liquid nitrogen. After 3 liters of buffer A (44% (v/v) phenol, 0.5 M NaCl, 0.25 mM EDTA, 50 mM NaOAc, pH 6.0, 10 mM Mg(OAc)2, 1.2% diethylpyrocarbonate) had been added, the mixture was shaken for 12 h. Total nucleic acids recovered by ethanol precipitation were subjected to chromatography on a column of DE52-cellulose that had previously been equilibrated with buffer B (0.2 M NaCl, 10 mM Mg(OAc)2, 20 mM NaOAc, pH 6.0).Bulk tRNA was obtained by stepwise elution with buffer B that contained 0.6 M NaCl in place of 0.2 M NaCl. The unfractionated tRNA (2,000 A260units) was applied to a column (1.5 × 45 cm) of DEAE-Sepharose that had previously been equilibrated with buffer C (0.1 M NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 8 mM MgCl2). The column was washed with buffer C and then eluted with a gradient obtained by placing 1 liter of buffer C in the mixing chamber and 1 liter of buffer C that contained 0.4 M NaCl in place of 0.1 M NaCl in the reservoir. A total of 150 A260units of the tRNA fraction that contained tRNALyswith the anticodon UUU (designated tRNALys(UUU)) was obtained. Then, 10 A260units/experiment were further applied to a column (0.5 × 10 cm) of RPC-5 that had previously been equilibrated with buffer D (0.4 M NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mM Mg(OAc)2). The column was washed with buffer D and then eluted with a gradient obtained by placing 20 ml of buffer D in the mixing chamber and 20 ml of buffer D that contained 1 M NaCl in place of 0.4 M NaCl in the reservoir. From an initial 10 A260units of tRNA applied to the RPC-5 column, a 0.2 A260unit of purified tRNALys(UUU) was finally obtained after electrophoresis in a non-denaturating gel.The tRNA fraction containing the tRNALyswith the anticodon CUU (designated tRNALys(CUU); 1,200 A260units) eluted from the column of DEAE-Sepharose was further applied to another column (1 × 50 cm) of DEAE-Sepharose that had previously been equilibrated with buffer E (0.4 M NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 20 mM NaOAc, pH 4.0). The column was washed with buffer E and then eluted with a gradient obtained by placing 500 ml of buffer E in the mixing chamber and 500 ml of buffer E that contained 0.75 M NaCl in place of 0.4 M NaCl in the reservoir. A total of 91 A260units of a tRNA fraction that contained tRNALys(CUU) was obtained from the column of DEAE-Sepharose (pH 4.0). Next, 10 A260units of this fraction/experiment were subjected to chromatography on the same column of RPC-5 as that used for purification of tRNALys(UUU), and the column was eluted with a gradient of NaCl under the same conditions as described above. From the 10 A260units of the tRNA fraction applied to the RPC-5 column, 0.09 A260unit of purified tRNALys(CUU) was finally obtained after electrophoresis in a non-denaturing gel.The fractions containing tRNAsLysthat were eluted from columns were assayed by aminoacylation using an extract S-100 of hen oviduct and hybridization with oligodeoxyribonucleotide probes specific to the squid genes for tRNALys(UUU) and tRNALys(CUU) by the previously published methods (17Nishimura S. Weinstein I.B. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 832-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 18Yokogawa T. Kumazawa Y. Miura K. Watanabe K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 2623-2638Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The sequences of the two species of tRNAsLyswere determined by the postlabeling method of Kuchino et al. (19Kuchino Y. Hanyu N. Nishimura S. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 155: 379-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and a partial enzymatic digestion method (20Donis-Keller H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1980; 8: 3133-3142Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar).Construction of Plasmids That Contained Genes for tRNALys (CUU)(C60) and tRNALys (CUU)(U60) and Transcription in Vitro of the DNAs That Included These GenesThree DNA fragments, namely Ribo-5′, which contains the promoter sequence of T7 RNA polymerase (5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGCCCGGCTAGCT-3′), Ribo-3′C (5′-CCTGGCGCCCAACGTGGGGCTCGA-3′), and Ribo-3′U (5′-CCTGGCGCCCAACGTGGGACTCGA-3′) were synthesized and used as primers for polymerase chain reaction (21Saiki R.K. Gelfand D.H. Stoffel S. Scharf S.J. Higuchi R. Horn G.H. Mullis K.B. Erlich H.A. Science. 1988; 239: 487-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (13400) Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA that included the gene for tRNALys (CUU) isolated from a genomic library of the squid 1M. Matsuo, Y. Abe, Y. Saruta, and N. Okada, unpublished observations. was used as a template for polymerase chain reaction. Using two sets of primers, we amplified and cloned DNAs in PUC19, obtaining pC60K and pU60K, respectively. The pC60K plasmid contained a gene for tRNALys (CUU) that had a cytidine residue at position 60 (designated tRNALys(CUU)(C60)). It generated the same sequence as that of the native tRNLys(CUU) of squid except for U1 and A72 by in vitro transcription. This U-A pair was changed to a G-C pair to allow the plasmid to be transcribed more efficiently. The pU60K plasmid contained the same sequence as that of pC60K except for one nucleotide at position 60; the transcript had a uridine residue at this position (designated tRNALys(CUU)(U60)).DNAs were amplified by polymerase chain reaction, using M4 (5′-GTTTTCCCAGTCACGAC-3′) and Reverse (5′-CAGGAAACAGCTATGAC-3′) as primers and pC60K DNA and pU60K DNA, respectively, as templates. The resultant DNA was digested with MvaI to generate the CCA end of tRNA and was transcribed in vitro in a reaction mixture of 100 μl that contained 2 mM of each NTP, 5 mM dithiothreitol, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM spermidine, 40 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 100 units of T7 RNA polymerase (22Himeno H. Hasegawa T. Ueda T. Watanabe K. Miura K. Shimizu M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 7855-7863Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar).Analyses of Terminal Structures Produced by Cleavages Catalyzed by Metal IonsFor analysis of terminal structures produced by cleavage with Mg2+ions, the 15-mer oligonucleotide was recovered from a denaturing polyacrylamide gel. The 15-mer was digested with RNase U2 in a reaction mixture that contained 0.5 A260unit of guanosine 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate (designated G>p), 10 mM sodium citrate, pH 4.5, and 50 units of RNase U2 in a final volume of 5 μl at 37°C for 1 h. G>p was included as an internal control to demonstrate that RNase U2 did not cleave a 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate ring under the conditions of the reaction. The digest was subjected to two-dimensional thin-layer chromatography with solvent system A (isobutyric acid, NH3, and H2O, 66:1:33, v/v) in the first dimension and solvent system B (60 g of ammonium sulfate dissolved in 100 ml of 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) plus 2 ml of n-propyl alcohol) in the second dimension (19Kuchino Y. Hanyu N. Nishimura S. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 155: 379-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In the case of digestion with nuclease P1, the 15-mer was incubated in a reaction mixture that contained 1 μg of nuclease P1 and 0.25 A260unit of carrier tRNA in a final volume of 10 μl at 37°C for 3 h.For analysis of the terminal structure produced by cleavage with Pb2+ions, the 17-mer oligonucleotide was recovered from a denaturing polyacrylamide gel. The 17-mer was digested with nuclease P1 under the same conditions as used in the case of the 15-mer. In another experiment, for the assay of the phosphomonoesterase activity associated with nuclease P1, the 17-mer was preincubated in a reaction mixture that contained 0.2 N HCl at 37°C for 1 h in a final volume of 5 μl to open the 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate ring. After neutralization of the mixture by the addition of 0.2 N NaOH, the 17-mer was recovered by ethanol precipitation and was digested with nuclease P1. Solvent systems used for thin-layer chromatography were the same as those used in the case of the analysis of the 15-mer.RESULTSOptimization of the Cleavage ReactionThe species of tRNAsLyshaving anticodons CUU and UUU (designated tRNALys(CUU) and tRNALys(UUU), respectively) were purified to homogeneity. The sequence was first analyzed by a partial enzymatic digestion method (20Donis-Keller H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1980; 8: 3133-3142Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) and was later confirmed by the postlabeling method of Kuchino et al. (19Kuchino Y. Hanyu N. Nishimura S. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 155: 379-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) for identification of modified nucleotides in the tRNAs. The sequences of the two tRNAs are shown in Fig. 1, in which differences between the two tRNAs are shaded.Fig. 2 shows autoradiograms of sequencing polyacrylamide gels for the two tRNAs after partial digestion with base-specific RNases. As shown in Fig. 2(A and B, lanes 1), tRNALys(CUU) was cleaved at a specific site even in the absence of any enzyme, whereas tRNALys(UUU) was not cleaved under the same conditions. This cleavage reaction was presumed to be due to incubation of the tRNA with a buffer that contained 10 mM Mg2+ions for a certain period of time before sequencing.Figure 2:Autoradiograms of sequencing polyacrylamide gels for analysis of tRNALys(CUU) (A) and tRNALys(UUU) (B) from squid. After treatment with bacterial alkaline phosphatase of the two tRNAsLys(about 0.02 A260unit of each), each was labeled at its 5′-end by [γ-32P]ATP and polynucleotide kinase. An aliquot of the labeled tRNA was incubated in the absence (lane 1) or in the presence of Na2CO3buffer (pH 9) (lanes 2 and 7), RNase T1 (lane 3), RNase U2 (lane 4), RNase Phy M (lane 5), or RNase CL3 (lane 6) according to the protocol described elsewhere (20). The cleavage product of tRNALys(CUU) in lane 1 is indicated by a black arrow, and the corresponding position in tRNALys(UUU) is indicated by a white arrow. Electrophoresis was performed in 15% polyacrylamide gels that contained 7 M urea and 10% glycerol for 3 h.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)We examined the kinetics and the optimum conditions for the cleavage reaction. Fig. 3 A shows the time course of the reaction in the presence of 30 mM MgCl2(pH 7.5). In this experiment, native squid tRNALys(CUU) labeled with [5′-32P]pCp at the 3′ terminus was used as a substrate to determine whether there might be another cleavage site in the 3′ portion of the tRNA. After incubation for 12 h, about 75% of the tRNA had been cleaved. As shown in lanes 1 and 2 of Fig. 3 B, Mg2+ions were required for the cleavage reaction, and spermidine could not take the place of Mg2+ions. In the absence of Mg2+ions and spermidine, slight cleavages were observed due to degradation of the tRNA (Fig. 3 B, lane 1). However, when spermidine was present, no such degradational cleavages occurred (Fig. 3 B, lane 2). Spermidine may possibly contribute to the maintenance of a stable tertiary structure of the tRNA. The optimal concentration of Mg2+ions was found to be 30 mM, and almost the same extent of cleavage was observed at concentrations of 30 and 50 mM (Fig. 3 B, lanes 7-10). In the presence of Mg2+ions, spermidine slightly enhanced the reaction (about 10%) (Fig. 3 B, lanes 3-10), a result that suggests that spermidine can assist in the proper folding that is required for generation of a cleavable tRNA molecule, as in the case of hepatitis delta virus RNA (23Suh Y.-A. Kumar P.K.R. Taira K. Nishikawa S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3277-3280Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). These experiments (Fig. 3 B), in which the native tRNALys(CUU) that had been labeled at the 5′-end was used, also showed that no cleavage sites other than p16 were present in the 5′ portion of the tRNA. Fig. 3 C shows the effects of temperature on the reaction. In the presence of Mg2+ions, the cleavage reaction proceeded efficiently at 37°C but not at 10°C. At 55°C, the tRNA was nonspecifically degraded.Figure 3:Determination of the optimal conditions for the cleavage of the native tRNALys(CUU) from squid. A, the cleavage reaction was performed in a reaction mixture that contained 30 mM MgCl2, 2 mM spermidine, and 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) at 37°C in a final volume of 77 μl. At each time point, 11 μl of the reaction mixture were withdrawn and analyzed. B, the reaction mixture with different concentrations of Mg2+ions was incubated at 37°C for 3 h with or without spermidine. C, the reaction mixture was incubated for 5 h at the temperatures specified. In each group, the concentration of Mg2+ions was varied. Electrophoresis was performed in 15% polyacrylamide gels that contained 7 M urea and 10% glycerol. The cleavage product is indicated by an arrow in each case.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The Cleavage of tRNALys(CUU) Can Be Potentiated by Several Metal IonsWe examined the cleavage of squid tRNALys(CUU) in the presence of other metal ions. Both Ca2+and Pb2+ions potentiated cleavage of squid tRNALys(CUU) at specific sites (see below). To compare the sites of cleavage in the presence of various metal ions, we incubated 5′-labeled tRNALys(CUU) with Mg2+, Ca2+, and Pb2+ions separately. In the presence of Ca2+and Mg2+ions, the tRNA was cleaved at the same site. However, the efficiency and specificity of the reaction with Ca2+ions were lower than with Mg2+ions (data not shown). By contrast, in the presence of Pb2+, the tRNA was mainly cleaved at the phosphodiester linkage between C17and G18(p18), namely two nucleotides downstream from the cleavage site found with Mg2+and Ca2+ions, confirming the previous data obtained with yeast tRNAPhe(GAA) (data not shown).Characterization of the End Products of Cleavage in the Presence of Mg2+, Ca2+, and Pb2+IonsTo characterize the end products of cleavages that occurred in the presence of metal ions, we constructed the pC60K plasmid, which can be transcribed by T7 RNA polymerase to generate the same sequence as that of the native squid tRNALys(CUU) with the exception of U1and A72. This U-A pair was changed to a G-C pair to allow the plasmid to be transcribed more efficiently (the product was designated tRNALys(CUU)(C60)).The plasmid was transcribed in the presence of [α-32P]UTP, and the resultant labeled transcript was cleaved in the presence of Mg2+ions. The 15-mer cleavage product was isolated by electrophoresis and was further digested with RNase U2 for analysis of the 3′ terminus of the oligonucleotide by thin-layer chromatography. Because RNase U2 recognizes purines predominantly, adenosine residues to produce a 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate, this enzyme appears unlikely to modify the 3′-end structure of the 15-mer generated in the presence of Mg2+ions. To our surprise, as shown in Fig. 4A, the major terminus after cleavage was found to be guanosine 3′-phosphate (designated G3′p) and not guanosine 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate (designated G>p), which is a common end product of cleavage in several ribozyme systems (24Forster A.C. Symons R.H. Cell. 1987; 49: 211-220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar, 25Prody G.A. Bakos J.T. Buzayan J.M. Schneider I.R. Bruening G.

In addition to G3′p, small amounts of G2′p and G>p were also detected. Because RNase U2 cannot cleave a 2′,3′-cyclic phosphodiester bond under the conditions used (as confirmed by the result that an excess of G>p in the reaction mixture could not be cleaved under these conditions; see “Experimental Procedures”), the result suggests that tRNALyswas cleaved intramolecularly in the presence of Mg2+ions at the phosphodiester linkage of p16 with opening of the 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate ring to give rise mainly to G3′p and also to a small amount of G2′p.Figure 4:The cleavage product generated by Mg2+ ions has mainly a 3′-phosphate and not a 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate ring at its 3′-end.

F, analysis of products of digestion with nuclease P1 of the same 17-mer after treatment of the 17-mer with hydrochloric acid. See “Experimental Procedures” for details of these analyses.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To confirm this result, another experiment was performed. The 15-mer cleavage product was digested with nuclease P1 and the digest was analyzed by TLC. As shown in Fig. 4B, a considerable amount of inorganic phosphate was detected in addition to pU derived from internal nucleotides of the oligonucleotide, pG2′p and pG>p. Our interpretation of this result is that the labeled 3′-phosphate in pG3′p that was generated by the cleavage reaction was released by 3′-phosphomonoesterase activity associated with nuclease P1. Because this activity releases the monophosphate of N3′p more efficiently than that of N2′p (3,000-fold preference for N3′p as compared with N2′p; Ref. 27Fujimoto M. Kuninaka A. Yoshino H. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1974; 38: 1555-1561Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar), the presence of a small amount of pG2′p can be explained by this difference in efficiency. The same result was found in the case of the cleavage reaction that occurred in the presence of Ca2+ions (Fig. 4, C and D).To confirm that the Mg2+ions cleave the phosphodiester linkage to form a 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate that is then further opened to the 3′-phosphate, we performed a kinetic experiment as shown in Fig. 5. The amounts of G3′p and G2′p increased with time, whereas the amount of G>p decreased concordantly. The result suggests that the cleavage actually goes through the cyclic intermediate.Figure 5:Time course of the generation of G>p, G3′p, and G2′p in the cleavage reaction by Mg2+ ions. The experimental conditions are as described in the legend to Fig. 4. At times specified, an aliquot was taken from the reaction tube and was subjected to electrophoresis. The 15-mer was digested with RNase U2, followed by TLC. The radioactivity corresponding to G>p, G3′p, and G2′p was analyzed by an image analyzer (bas2000).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)As a control experiment, an end product of cleavage in the presence of Pb2+ions was also analyzed. The pC60K plasmid was transcribed in vitro in the presence of [α-32P]GTP by T7 RNA polymerase, and the labeled transcript was incubated with Pb2+ions. The resultant 17-mer oligonucleotide was digested with nuclease P1, and the digest was analyzed by TLC as shown in Fig. 4 E. In this case, only pC>p and not Piwas detected, confirming the data obtained in several earlier studies of the cleavage of yeast tRNAPhein the presence of lead ions. When the 17-mer oligonucleotide was pretreated with hydrochloric acid to open the 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate ring, nuclease P1 released free phosphate groups from pCp (Fig. 4 F), confirming the release of the 3′-phosphate from pGp in the experiment for which results are shown in Fig. 4(B and D). These results unambiguously demonstrated that the cleavage of the tRNA in the presence of Mg2+ions generates mainly a 3′-phosphate terminus and not a 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate ring.Effect of C60on the Cleavage ReactionUnder the optimal ionic conditions, determined as described above (30 mM MgCl2, 2 mM spermidine, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) at 37°C, the efficiency of the cleavage reaction was compared between the tRNALys(CUU) and tRNALys(UUU), as shown in Fig. 6. After 8 h of incubation, 48% of tRNALys(CUU) had been cleaved, whereas only 3% of tRNALys(UUU) had been cleaved. Thus the ratio of the efficiencies of the cleavage reactions was 16 to 1.Figure 6:Comparison of the efficiency of the cleavage of the two native species of squid tRNAsLys in the presence of Mg2+ ions. The reaction conditions were the same as described in the legend to Fig. 3 A. The cleavage product is indicated by an arrow.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)As shown in Fig. 1, the sequences of the D-loop and D-stem regions of these two tRNAs are the same, suggesting that the T-loop region, which interacts in the tertiary structure with the D-loop, might be responsible for the difference in the efficiencies of the cleavage reactions. In tRNALys(CUU) the nucleotide at position 60 is cytidine, whereas in tRNALys(UUU) the same position is occupied by uridine. Therefore, we next examined the effect of C60on the cleavage reaction by constructing a T7 transcript that contained U60in the sequence background of tRNALys(CUU).The T7 transcript that contained the same sequence as that of tRNALys(CUU) with the exception of one base pair, U1-A72, and U at pos"

AT-Denver inhibited thrombin, Factor IXa, plasmin, and Factor Xa with second order rate constants that were 430-, 120-, 40-, and 7-fold slower, respectively, than those of native AT, consistent with an altered specificity of the variant inhibitor for its target proteinases. AT-Denver inhibited thrombin and Factor Xa with nearly equimolar stoichiometries and formed SDS-stable complexes with these proteinases, indicating that the diminished inhibitor activity was not due to an enhanced turnover of the inhibitor as a substrate. Binding and kinetic studies showed that heparin binding to AT-Denver as well as heparin accelerations of AT-Denver-proteinase reactions were normal, consistent with the P1′ mutation not affecting the heparin activation mechanism. Resolution of the two-step reaction of AT-Denver with thrombin revealed that the majority of the defective function was localized in the second reaction step and resulted from a 190-fold decreased rate constant for conversion of a noncovalent proteinase-inhibitor encounter complex to a stable, covalent complex. Little or no effects of the mutation on the binding constant for encounter complex formation or on the rate constant for stable complex dissociation were evident. These results support a role for the P1′ residue of antithrombin in transition-state stabilization of a substrate-like attack of the proteinase on the inhibitor-reactive bond following the formation of a proteinase-inhibitor encounter complex but prior to the conformational change leading to the trapping of proteinase in a stable, covalent complex. Such a role indicates that the P1′ residue does not contribute to thermodynamic stabilization of AT-proteinase complexes and instead favors a kinetic stabilization of these complexes by a suicide substrate reaction mechanism.

Such a role indicates that the P1′ residue does not contribute to thermodynamic stabilization of AT-proteinase complexes and instead favors a kinetic stabilization of these complexes by a suicide substrate reaction mechanism. Antithrombin is the principal protein inhibitor of mammalian blood coagulation proteinases and a member of the serpin (serine proteinase inhibitor) superfamily of protein proteinase inhibitors (Huber and Carrell, 1989Huber R. Carrell R.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8951-8966Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar; Olson and Björk, 1994Olson S.T. Björk I. Semin. Thromb. Hemostasis. 1994; 20: 373-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Inhibitors of this family act by displaying a unique reactive bond in an exposed loop of the protein, which is recognized by the proteinase as a normal substrate to be cleaved. Rather than cleaving this bond, however, the proteinase becomes trapped in a highly stable complex with the inhibitor, in which the inhibitor-reactive bond is bound tightly at the active site of the proteinase (Huber and Carrell, 1989Huber R. Carrell R.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8951-8966Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar; Bode and Huber, 1992Bode W. Huber R. Eur. J.

An analogous stable complex appears to be formed between low molecular weight protein proteinase inhibitors of other families and their target enzymes (Laskowski and Kato, 1980Laskowski Jr., M. Kato I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 593-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (1948) Google Scholar; Read and James, 1986Read R.J. James M.N.G. Barrett A.J. Salvesen G.S. Proteinase Inhibitors.

Unique to the serpin mechanism, however, is that accompanying the formation of the stable inhibitor-proteinase complex, the inhibitor undergoes a substantial conformational change in which the exposed reactive center loop is thought to insert into the major β-sheet of the inhibitor. This conformational change appears to be essential for arresting the cleavage of the reactive bond initiated by the proteinase and thus for trapping the enzyme in a stable inhibited complex (Engh et al., 1990Engh R.A.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7650-7657Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The reactive bond of human antithrombin has been identified as the Arg-393-Ser-394 bond, consistent with the specificity of the target proteinases of antithrombin for cleaving at Arg- X bonds (Björk et al., 1981Björk I. Danielsson A. Fenton J.W. Jörnvall H. FEBS Lett. 1981; 126: 257-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 1982). Characterization of natural and engineered variants of antithrombin and other serpins have confirmed the importance of the reactive bond for inhibitor function and in determining the specificity of the inhibitor for its target proteinases. Mutation of the arginine residue of this bond, i.e. the P1 residue, to His, Cys, or Pro in natural variants of antithrombin thus results in a complete loss of inhibitor function (Erdjument et al., 1988aErdjument H.

Similar consequences result from mutation of the P1 Arg residue of the related serpins, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, and C1inhibitor, to residues other than Lys (Sherman et al., 1992Sherman P.M.

Certain P1 mutations of other serpins produce a loss of function with natural target proteinases but the appearance of function with other nontarget proteinases (Owen et al., 1983Owen M.C. Brennan S.O. Lewis J.H. Carrell R.W. N. Engl. J. Med. 1983; 309: 694-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar; Derechin et al., 1990Derechin V.M. Blinder M.A. Tollefsen D.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1990; 265: 1199-1207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that the P1 residue is a primary determinant of target proteinase specificity. While such studies have demonstrated a critical role for the P1 residue in serpin inhibitor function, the role of the P1′ residue is less well defined. Thus, mutagenesis of the P1′ residue of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 has indicated a broad tolerance for different amino acids in this position (Sherman et al., 1992Sherman P.M. Lawrence D.A. Yang A.Y. Vandenberg E.T. Paielli D. Olson S.T. Shore J.D. Ginsburg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7588-7595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, mutation of the P1′ serine residue of antithrombin to leucine in the natural variant, antithrombin-Denver, drastically reduces the inhibitory activity toward thrombin, although it has a less pronounced effect on the inhibition of Factor Xa (Sambrano et al., 1986Sambrano J.E.

J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9035-9040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Further analysis of a number of P1′ variants of antithrombin produced by site-directed mutagenesis has shown that the size and hydrophobicity of the P1′ residue can significantly influence inhibitor function (Stephens et al., 1988Stephens A.W. Siddiqui A. Hirs C.H.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15849-15852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; Theunissen et al., 1993Theunissen H.J.M. Dijkema R. Grootenhuis P.D.J. Swinkels J.C.

Because of the contrasting findings with regard to the importance of the P1′ residue in serpin function, we have further characterized the functional defect in the natural P1′ variant, antithrombin-Denver. The results of these studies demonstrate the importance of the P1′ residue in determining the specificity of antithrombin for inhibition of various target proteinases. They additionally establish a mechanism for the expression of this specificity in which an interaction between the inhibitor P1′ residue and proteinase stabilizes the transition state and not the final ground state on the pathway to a covalent antithrombin-proteinase complex. Such findings support a mechanism for serpin inhibitor function different from that of low molecular weight protein proteinase inhibitors but similar to that of a suicide substrate (Fish and Björk, 1979Fish W.W.

Human antithrombin was purified from outdated plasma by chromatography on heparin-agarose, DEAE-Sepharose, and Sephacryl S-200 as described previously (Olson, 1988Olson S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1698-1708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; Olson et al., 1993Olson S.T. Björk I. Shore J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 525-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Heparin was a size- and affinity-fractionated preparation of Mr∼7900 (±10%) described previously (Olson et al., 1992Olson S.T. Björk I. Sheffer R. Craig P.A. Shore J.D. Choay J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12528-12538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Human α-thrombin was generously provided by Dr. John Fenton of the New York State Department of Health, Albany, NY. Factor Xa, plasmin, and Factor IXa were obtained from the purified zymogens of these proteinases by activation with specific enzymes, followed by their purification as described previously (Björk et al., 1992aBjörk I. Nordling K. Larsson I. Olson S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19047-19050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All proteins were judged pure by SDS gel electrophoresis. Normal and variant antithrombin concentrations were determined from the absorbance at 280 nm using an absorption coefficient of 0.65 liters+g-1+cm-1and molecular weight of 58,000 (Nordenman et al., 1977Nordenman B. Nyström C. Björk I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 78: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Concentrations of proteinases were determined by active site titration with 4-methylumbelliferyl p-guanidinobenzoate or fluorescein mono- p-guanidinobenzoate as described previously (Jameson et al., 1973Jameson G.W.

Antithrombin-Denver was purified from the plasma of a patient heterozygous for the mutation by modification of a previously described method, which exploits the differential reactivities of normal and mutant inhibitors with thrombin (Stephens et al., 1987Stephens A.W. Thalley B.S. Hirs C.H.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1044-1048Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Normal and mutant antithrombins were first copurified by the procedure used to purify normal antithrombin, except that the Sephacryl S-200 step was omitted. The purified mixture of normal and abnormal antithrombins was treated at a concentration of ∼8 μM (∼0.5 mg/ml) with 0.55 molar equivalents of thrombin in the presence of 1 μg/ml Polybrene (Aldrich) at 25°C. Neutralization of thrombin enzymatic activity was monitored by chromogenic substrate assay (see below) until the loss of activity had ceased (∼1 h). Residual active thrombin was then quenched with a 2-fold molar excess of D-Phe-L-Pro-L-Arg-chloromethyl ketone (Calbiochem). The sample was dialyzed and rechromatographed on heparin-agarose, which separated the antithrombin-thrombin complex and chloromethyl ketone-inactivated thrombin from unreacted antithrombin-Denver. The purified variant antithrombin (10 μM) was subsequently treated again with 0.02 molar equivalents of thrombin for 3 h to remove any residual traces of normal antithrombin. The reaction was quenched with chloromethyl ketone as above, dialyzed, and rechromatographed a third time on heparin-agarose. The resulting antithrombin was subsequently processed through the DEAE-Sepharose and Sephacryl S-200 steps as in the purification of normal antithrombin. Fixed levels of thrombin (5 μM) or Factor Xa (1 μM) were reacted with increasing levels of antithrombin or antithrombin-Denver ranging from 0.1 to 1.2 mol of inhibitor/mol of enzyme in 20 mM sodium phosphate, 0.1 M NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.1% polyethylene glycol 8000, I 0.15, pH 7.4, 25°C. Residual enzyme activity was assayed after 27 h for thrombin reactions and after 16 h for Factor Xa reactions. Assays were performed by diluting samples ≥1000-fold either into 100 μMD-Phe-L-Pip-L-Arg- p-nitroanilide (S-2238,1 1The abbreviation used is: S-2238D-Phe-L-Pip-L-Arg- p-nitroanilide. Chromogenix) for thrombin or 200 μM Spectrozyme FXa for Factor Xa, each containing 100 μg/ml Polybrene, and monitoring the initial rate of substrate hydrolysis from the absorbance increase at 405 nm. Similar titrations of 0.1 μM thrombin or Factor Xa with normal or variant antithrombins at molar ratios of inhibitor/enzyme ranging from 0.1 to 1.5 were also conducted in the presence of 0.3 μM heparin for 3-20 h and assayed for residual enzyme activity as above. Inhibitor titrations of Factor Xa in the absence of heparin were also done at the lower enzyme concentration using a 20-70-h incubation. The inhibition stoichiometry was obtained from the abscissa intercept of a linear regression fit of measured rates of substrate hydrolysis versus the molar ratio of inhibitor to enzyme. D-Phe-L-Pip-L-Arg- p-nitroanilide. Antithrombin-proteinase complexes were formed by incubating 6 μM antithrombin or antithrombin-Denver with 2 μM proteinase. Reactions with thrombin were done in the presence of 6 μM heparin for 15 min at 25°C in 0.02 M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.25 M NaCl (I 0.3), conditions that both avoided the degradation of the inhibitor-proteinase complex by free proteinase that occurs in the absence of polysaccharide and minimized the salt-dependent substrate reaction of the inhibitor that occurs in the presence of heparin (Olson, 1985Olson S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 10153-10160Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Factor Xa reactions were done in the absence of heparin for 1 h at 25°C in I 0.15, pH 7.4 sodium phosphate buffer. Reactions containing 25 μl were quenched with an equal volume of SDS sample buffer, boiled for 2 min, and then electrophoresed under nonreducing conditions in 10% polyacrylamide gels using the Laemmli buffer system (Laemmli, 1970Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar). Proteins bands were visualized by Coomassie Blue R-250 staining. Reactions of antithrombin or antithrombin-Denver with proteinases in the absence or presence of heparin were done in total reaction volumes of 40 or 50 μl in polystyrene cuvettes. The buffer was 20 mM sodium phosphate, 0.10 M NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.1% polyethylene glycol 8000, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, pH 7.40, at 25°C (except for Factor IXa reactions, where bovine serum albumin was omitted, and EDTA was present at 1 mM). Plasmin reactions were done in the presence of 20 mM∊-aminocaproic acid to stabilize the enzyme against autolysis. Reactions were conducted under pseudo-first order conditions by employing at least a 10-fold molar excess of antithrombin or antithrombin-heparin complex over proteinase. A molar excess of antithrombin over heparin was also used to fully saturate (>90%) the polysaccharide chains and minimize antagonism of the reaction by free heparin (Olson, 1988Olson S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1698-1708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Measured equilibrium binding constants were used to calculate concentrations of antithrombin-heparin complex. Proteinase concentrations were 0.1-100 nM for thrombin, 10-20 nM for Factor Xa, 10-100 nM for plasmin, and 200 nM for Factor IXa. Heparin-accelerated reactions of normal antithrombin with thrombin and Factor Xa were done in the presence of 2-5 mM p-aminobenzamidine to slow reactions sufficiently for manual sampling. Reaction rates were corrected for the effect of the competitive inhibitor as described previously (Olson and Björk, 1991Olson S.T. Björk I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6353-6364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; Olson et al., 1992Olson S.T. Björk I. Sheffer R. Craig P.A. Shore J.D. Choay J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12528-12538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The addition of bovine serum albumin served to minimize proteinase adsorption and was found not to significantly affect the rates of proteinase inhibition. For antithrombin-Factor IXa reactions, 1 nM hirudin (Sigma) was included to neutralize a 0.006% thrombin contamination detectable from the hirudin-dependent loss in enzymatic activity observed with the fluorogenic substrate assay for Factor IXa activity. Reactions were quenched at various times with 0.8-1.0 ml 50 μM Tosyl-Gly-Pro-Arg-7-amido-4-methyl coumarin (Sigma) (thrombin and Factor IXa), 100 μM S-2238 (thrombin), 200 μM Spectrozyme FXa (American Diagnostica) (Factor Xa), or 200 μMD-Val-L-Leu-L-Lys- p-nitroanilide (Chromogenix) (plasmin), all containing 100 μg/ml Polybrene. Residual enzyme activity was measured from the initial rate of substrate hydrolysis, either from the increase in fluorescence at λex380 nm, λem440 nm for thrombin and Factor IXa reactions, or from the absorbance increase at 405 nm for thrombin, Factor Xa, and plasmin reactions. Control incubations in the absence of inhibitor were used to establish the rate corresponding to fully active enzyme, as well as the stability of the activity over the time course of the reactions. Observed pseudo-first order rate constants (kobs) were obtained from the slopes of semilog plots of enzyme activity versus time or by nonlinear regression analysis of data by a single exponential decay function (Olson et al., 1993Olson S.T. Björk I. Shore J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 525-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Second order rate constants were obtained by linear regression analysis of plots of kobs versus the antithrombin or antithrombin-heparin complex concentrations, after correction in the latter instance for the free inhibitor reaction (Olson, 1988Olson S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1698-1708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Antithrombin-proteinase complex dissociation rate constants were measured essentially by the method of Jesty, 1979Jesty J. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 10044-10050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. Complexes were prepared by incubating proteinase (0.5 μM thrombin or 1 μM Factor Xa) with 5 μM antithrombin and 5 μM heparin at 37°C in I 0.15 sodium phosphate buffer for 10 min. Dissociation was then induced by diluting 5-27 μl of the incubation mixture into 1.0 ml (final volume) chromogenic substrate consisting of 400 μM S-2238 or 400 μM Spectrozyme FXa plus 100 μg/ml Polybrene (final concentrations) in I 0.15 sodium phosphate buffer at 37°C. Complex concentrations after dilution ranged between 2.5 and 27 nM. The initial rate of complex dissociation (<0.5% dissociation) was continuously monitored for 1 h at 37°C from the parabolic increase in absorbance at 405 nm due to the reappearance of enzyme activity. The absorbance changes were fit by a second order polynomial, and the dissociation rate constant was obtained from the fitted parameters using the measured turnover number at 37°C and the total concentration of complex as described previously (Danielsson and Björk, 1983Danielsson Å. Björk I. Biochem. J. 1983; 213: 345-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar; Olson et al., 1993Olson S.T. Björk I. Shore J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 525-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Measured rate constants were not appreciably affected by changing the antithrombin or proteinase concentrations, by including heparin to accelerate complex formation, or by increasing the substrate concentration employed to monitor complex dissociation, consistent with the measured rate constant not containing a significant contribution from the association process. Reported time-dependent decreases in the dissociation rate constant due to complex aggregation were minimized by the short reaction time of 10 min employed for complex formation (Danielsson and Björk, 1983Danielsson Å. Björk I. Biochem. J. 1983; 213: 345-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Binding of high affinity heparin to antithrombin or antithrombin-Denver was measured by fluorescence titrations in which the enhancement in protein tryptophan fluorescence accompanying polysaccharide binding was used to monitor the interaction (Olson and Shore, 1981Olson S.T. Shore J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11065-11072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; Olson et al., 1993Olson S.T. Björk I. Shore J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 525-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Titrations were done with 50 nM inhibitor in 20 mM sodium phosphate, 0.10 M NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.1% polyethylene glycol 8000, pH 7.4. Fluorescence measurements were made at λex280 nm, λem340 nm on an SLM 8000 spectrofluorometer. Relative fluorescence changes, Δ F/ Fo= (Fobs− Fo)/ Fo(where Fobsand Foare observed and starting fluorescence values, respectively), were computer fit by the quadratic equation describing the equilibrium binding process from which values of the dissociation constant, stoichiometry, and maximum fluorescence change were obtained (Olson et al., 1993Olson S.T. Björk I. Shore J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 525-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Mutation of the reactive center P1′ serine residue to leucine in the natural variant, antithrombin-Denver, was previously reported to drastically reduce the rate of inhibition of thrombin in the presence of the activator, heparin (Sambrano et al., 1986Sambrano J.E. Jacobson L.J. Reeve E.B. Manco-Johnson M.J. Hathaway W.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 77: 887-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar; Stephens et al., 1987Stephens A.W. Thalley B.S. Hirs C.H.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1044-1048Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Antithrombin-Denver retained the ability to inhibit thrombin as well as Factor Xa at a slow but measurable rate also in the absence of heparin (Fig. 1). The observed inhibition was not due to contaminating heparin, since Polybrene had no effect on the rates (not shown). Fitting the progress curves in Fig. 1 by a first order exponential decay indicated that antithrombin-Denver inhibited thrombin with a 430-fold reduced pseudo-first order rate constant (kobs) as compared with antithrombin. By contrast, the variant antithrombin inhibited Factor Xa with only a 6.5-fold reduced kobsas compared to the normal inhibitor. Reactions of antithrombin-Denver with thrombin were characterized by monophasic inactivation curves and indistinguishable second order rate constants when inhibitor/proteinase ratios were varied from 20,000 to as low as 20, indicating that the slow inactivation of this proteinase by the variant inhibitor was not due to contaminating wild-type inhibitor. The greatly different reductions in the rates of proteinase inactivation by antithrombin-Denver relative to antithrombin for thrombin and Factor Xa provided additional evidence that the inactivation of these proteinases by the variant inhibitor was not the result of contaminating normal antithrombin. The reactions of antithrombin-Denver and wild-type antithrombin with both thrombin and Factor Xa required approximately equimolar levels of inhibitor and proteinase for complete inhibition (Fig. 2, Table I). These findings indicated that the observed inactivation of proteinases by antithrombinDenver was due to the formation of 1:1 stoichiometric complexes like those formed in normal antithrombin-proteinase reactions. Heparin increased the inhibition stoichiometries of both normal and variant inhibitors with the two proteinases (Table I), due to the polysaccharide promoting a competing reaction of antithrombin with the enzymes as a substrate (Olson, 1985Olson S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 10153-10160Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; Olson et al., 1992Olson S.T. Björk I. Sheffer R. Craig P.A. Shore J.D. Choay J. J. Biol.

The in vivo activity and stability of mammalian ODC are regulated by polyamines. Polyamines induce antizyme, which inactivates ODC by tight association and promotes degradation of ODC by the mammalian 26 S proteasome.

Mouse ODC expressed in T. brucei was also unaffected by exogenous polyamines, suggesting that a mammalian antizyme equivalent may be absent in T. brucei.

Further in vitro experiments suggested the presence of an inhibitory factor(s) in trypanosome, which interferes with the degradation of mouse ODC.

INTRODUCTIONOrnithine decarboxylase (ODC1( 1The abbreviations used are: ODCornithine decarboxylaseDFMOα-DL-difluoromethylornithineHTChepatoma cellsPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisSucsuccinylMCA4-methyl-coumaryl-7-amide.) ; L-ornithine carboxylase, EC 4.1.1.17) is the key enzyme in de novo synthesis of polyamines, which are ubiquitous in and essential for cells (1Tabor C.W. Tabor H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1984; 53: 749-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (3221) Google Scholar, 2Oka T. Borellini F. Hayashi S. Ornithine Decarboxylase: Biology, Enzymology, and Molecular Biology. Pergamon Press, New York1989: 7-19Google Scholar). The inhibition of ODC has been investigated as a potential way to control rapid cell proliferation and to cure certain infectious deceases (3Jänne J. Alhonen-Hongisto L. Hayashi S. Ornithine Decarboxylase: Biology, Enzymology, and Molecular Biology. Pergamon Press, New York1989: 59-85Google Scholar). Indeed, α-DL-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), a catalytic, irreversible inhibitor of ODC, has been found to cure infections of Trypanosoma brucei in mice and Trypanosoma gambiense in man (4Bacchi C.J. Nathan H.C. Hutner S.H. McCann P.P. Sjoerdsma A. Science. 1980; 210: 332-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 5Sjoerdsma A. Schechter P.J. Clin. Pharmacol. Ther. 1984; 35: 287-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). DFMO depletes the pool of putrescine and spermidine in African trypanosomes, resulting in cessation of cell growth and eventual elimination of the parasites by the host immune response (5Sjoerdsma A. Schechter P.J. Clin. Pharmacol. Ther. 1984; 35: 287-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 6Bacchi C.J. Garofalo J. Mockenhaupt D. McCann P.P. Diekema K.A. Pegg A.E. Nathan H.C. Mullaney E.A. Chunosoff L. Sjoerdsma A. Hutner S.H. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1983; 7: 209-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The anti-trypanosomal action of DFMO can be reversed by intraperitoneal injections of polyamines in the murine model (7Nathan H.C. Bacchi C.J. Hutner S.H. Rescigno D. McCann P.P. Sjoerdsma A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1981; 30: 3010-3013Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The selective DFMO toxicity toward the trypanosomes may be attributable to a difference in the in vivo stabilities between trypanosomal ODC and its mammalian counterpart (8Phillips M.A. Coffino P. Wang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17933-17941Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mammalian ODC is one of the most short lived cellular proteins in vivo with a half-life of 10-50 min (1Tabor C.W. Tabor H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1984; 53: 749-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (3221) Google Scholar, 9Heller J.S. Fong W.F. Canellakis E.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 1858-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). On the other hand, we found that the trypanosomal ODC is very stable in T. brucei, presumably because a PEST sequence present at the carboxyl terminus of mouse ODC is absent from T. brucei ODC (10Phillips M.A. Coffino P. Wang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8721-8727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This carboxyl-terminal PEST sequence could be implicated in the rapid intracellular turnover of mammalian ODC. Truncation of the 37 residues at the carboxyl terminus of mouse ODC stabilized the protein in vivo (11Ghoda L. van Daalen Wetters T. Macrae M. Ascherman D. Coffino P. Science. 1989; 243: 1493-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), and addition of the carboxyl terminus of mouse ODC to trypanosomal ODC led to the rapid degradation of the chimeric protein in Chinese hamster ovary cells (12Ghoda L. Phillips M.A. Bass K.E. Wang C.C. Coffino P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11823-11826Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that the sequence at the mouse ODC carboxyl terminus plays an important role in bringing about its rapid degradation in vivo. However, when full-length mouse ODC was expressed in the procyclic form of T. brucei, we found that the mouse enzyme was stable (13Bass K.E. Sommer J.M. Cheng Q.L. Wang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11034-11037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This observation suggests the absence and/or the inhibition of necessary machineries in T. brucei cells required for rapid degradation of mammalian ODC. We decided therefore to look into the mechanisms behind the unusual stability of mouse ODC in the procyclic form of T. brucei.In mammalian cells, a noncompetitive inhibitory protein named antizyme is involved in the degradation of ODC both in vivo and in vitro (14Li X. Coffino P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3556-3562Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 15Murakami Y. Hayashi S. Biochem. J. 1985; 226: 893-896Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Murakami Y. Matsufuji S. Miyazaki Y. Hayashi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13138-13141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The expression of antizyme in mammalian cells can be induced by polyamines (9Heller J.S. Fong W.F. Canellakis E.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 1858-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Antizyme inhibits ODC activity by forming an ODC-antizyme complex (9Heller J.S. Fong W.F. Canellakis E.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 1858-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 14Li X. Coffino P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3556-3562Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 17Fong W.F. Heller J.S. Canellakis E.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 428: 456-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The complex thus formed causes the exposure of the carboxyl terminus of ODC (18Li X. Coffino P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2377-2383Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), which accelerates the degradation of ODC by the 26 S proteasome in an ATP-dependent but ubiquitin-independent manner (19Murakami Y. Matsufuji S. Kameji T. Hayashi S. Igarashi K. Tamura T. Tanaka K. Ichihara A. Nature. 1992; 360: 597-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar, 20Bercovich Z. Rosenberg-Hasson Y. Ciechanover A.

Biochem. 1989; 185: 469-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The 26 S proteasome is a large complex consisting of two functionally distinct units: a central cylindrical 20 S proteasome with at least three distinct protease activities, namely trypsin-like, chymotrypsin-like, and peptidylglutamyl-peptide hydrolase activities, respectively; and regulatory parts that attach to the central core (22Orlowski M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10289-10297Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 23Rechsteiner M. Hoffman L. Dubiel W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6065-6068Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Rivett A.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). The mammalian 20 S proteasome contains 20-25 different proteins with molecular sizes of 22-34 kDa resolved on a two-dimensional gel (24Rivett A.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). The manifestation of multiple catalytic activities at independent active sites within a single enzyme complex may be advantageous for the rapid and selective degradation and inactivation of various types of cellular proteins. In addition to the selective ubiquitin-independent degradation of ODC, the 26 S proteasome performs selective degradation of regulatory proteins related to cell cycle progression through a pathway that requires substrate ubiquitination (25Glotzer M. Murray A.W. Kirschner M.W. Nature. 1991; 349: 132-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1886) Google Scholar, 26Scheffner M. Werness B.A. Huibregtse J.M. Levine A.J. Howley P.M. Cell. 1990; 63: 1129-1136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3429) Google Scholar). The 26 S proteasome is also thought to play other roles in intracellular proteolysis such as antigen presentation (23Rechsteiner M. Hoffman L. Dubiel W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6065-6068Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).In this study we first examined whether an antizyme is present in T. brucei and found it to be absent. We then expressed both mouse ODC and rat antizyme in T. brucei by DNA transformation and noted the anticipated rat antizyme-mediated inactivation of mouse ODC enzymatic activity through antizyme-ODC complex formation. However, formation of the complex does not lead to rapid degradation in T. brucei, which could be attributed to the presence in T. brucei of an inhibitor(s) of proteasome function. We have also, for the first time, identified the proteasomes in T. brucei, which turn out to be distinct from mammalian proteasomes.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Cultures and Ornithine Decarboxylase Activity AssayProcyclic cells of a cloned T. brucei brucei strain TREU667 were continuously cultivated at 26°C by serial passages in Cunningham's medium (27Cunningham I. J. Protozool. 1977; 24: 325-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gemini Bioproducts, Inc.). The hepatoma cells (HTC) were cultured as described previously (14Li X. Coffino P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3556-3562Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The trypanosomal cell suspension was diluted with fresh Cunningham's medium containing fetal bovine serum to a density of approximately 1 × 106cells/ml and incubated at 26°C overnight before the ODC activity assay. Cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, lysed, and assayed for ODC activity essentially as described previously (14Li X. Coffino P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3556-3562Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). One unit of ODC activity is defined as 1 nmol of CO2released from L-ornithine/h. One unit of antizyme activity is defined as the amount of antizyme required to inhibit 1 unit of ODC activity.Plasmid Construction and Transformation of T. bruceiThe rat antizyme partial cDNA clone, Z1 (28Matsufuji S. Miyazaki Y. Kanamoto R. Kameji T. Murakami Y. Baby T.G. Fujita K. Ohno T. Hayashi S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1990; 108: 365-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 29Miyazaki Y. Matsufuji S. Hayashi S. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 113: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), was obtained from Dr. S. Hayashi. Due to the absence of a suitably placed methionine initiation codon in the clone, an in-frame ATG codon was added at the immediate 5′-end of the clone. The antizyme thus expressed from this construct in Chinese hamster ovary cells is known to execute all of the expected cellular and biochemical functions (30Li X. Coffino P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 87-92Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An XhoI site was generated upstream of the ATG codon in the primer sequence (5′-AAAACTCGAGCATATGCCAGAGAGAAAGAAGGGGA) for polymerase chain reaction. At the 3′-end of the clone, a BamHI site was added upstream of the poly(A) tail (primer sequence: 5′-TTTTGGATCCAGATCACTTTATTTATTAG). The XhoI/ BamHI fragment of the polymerase chain reaction product was inserted into the XhoI/ BamHI sites of the vector pTSA-Hyg2 (31Sommer J.M. Cheng Q.L. Keller G.A. Wang C.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 749-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), which contains a hyg gene whose expression in T. brucei is under the control of a procyclic acidic repetitive protein promoter. The nucleotide sequence of the insert was confirmed by sequencing. The plasmid thus constructed was named pAZ. Plasmids pMOD300 and pTOD300 containing the inserts of full-length cDNA encoding mouse ODC and T. brucei ODC, respectively, were constructed previously from a similar vector pTSA-Neo2, which has a neo gene controlled by the procyclic acidic repetitive protein promoter (13Bass K.E. Sommer J.M. Cheng Q.L. Wang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11034-11037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The DNAs of pAZ, pMOD300, and pTOD300 were each linearized at the MluI site at the center of T. brucei tubulin intergenic region and electroporated into the T. brucei cells (31Sommer J.M. Cheng Q.L. Keller G.A. Wang C.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 749-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) either individually or in combination. The stable transformants were selected in the Cunningham's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum in the presence of G418 (geneticin, Life Technologies, Inc.) (50 μg/ml), or hygromycin (Calbiochem-Novabiochem Corporation) (50 μg/ml), or both.Southern, Northern, and Slot Blot HybridizationsCellular DNA was isolated from the procyclic forms of T. brucei according to Hua and Wang (32Hua S.B. Wang C.C. J. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 54: 20-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Total cellular RNA was isolated as described (33Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd. ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), and the poly(A+) RNA was prepared by using the Fast-track mRNA isolation system (Invitrogen). The Southern, Northern, and slot blot hybridizations were carried out as described previously (32Hua S.B. Wang C.C. J. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 54: 20-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar).Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate-Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and ImmunostainingCells were lysed in the lysis solution (2% (w/v) SDS; 125 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8; 5% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol; 20% (v/v) glycerol). The lysate was centrifuged at 16,000 × g at 4°C for 10 min. The supernatant was fractionated on a 12.5% SDS-PAGE. The separated proteins were electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride Immobilon membrane (Millipore Inc.), immunostained, and visualized with the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Corp.) as described previously (32Hua S.B. Wang C.C. J. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 54: 20-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar).In Vivo Pulse-Chase Labeling of Protein and ImmunoprecipitationThe trypanosome cells were washed twice with cysteine/cystine-free Cunningham's medium, then suspended in the same medium containing L-[35S]cysteine (250 μCi/ml, 600 Ci/mmol) (DuPont NEN) to a density of 5-6 × 107cells/ml. After incubation at 26°C for 1 h, the radioactive medium was replaced with the regular Cunningham's medium and incubation continued. Cells were collected at time points of 0, 2, 4 and 6 h. Alternatively, cells were collected immediately after the L-[35S]cysteine labeling without chasing. The cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (150 mM NaCl; 0.1% SDS; 0.5% sodium deoxycholate; 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40; 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) (34Harlow E. Lane D. Antibody: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 421-470Google Scholar), and pretreated with a rabbit preimmune serum. Mouse ODC, trypanosomal ODC, and rat antizyme were immunoprecipitated with their respective antisera (see below) and Pansorbin (formalin-fixed Staphylococcus aureus cells) (Calbiochem-Novabiochem) following a standard protocol (34Harlow E. Lane D. Antibody: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 421-470Google Scholar). HTC cells were labeled in culture medium containing L-[35S]cysteine as described previously (30Li X. Coffino P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 87-92Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and ODC was immunoprecipitated as above. The immunoprecipitated proteins were subjected to 12.5% SDS-PAGE and autoradiography.In Vitro ODC Inhibition AssayAntizyme was produced by the in vitro transcription/translation systems described by Li and Coffino (18Li X. Coffino P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2377-2383Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Five microliters of the antizyme thus generated (containing approximately 0.25 unit of antizyme) was mixed with 0.5 unit of purified native mouse ODC and incubated on ice for 10 min. Alternatively, lysates from 1.5 × 106pAZ-transformed T. brucei cells were mixed with 0.5 unit of purified native mouse ODC and kept on ice for 10 min. These mixtures were then assayed for ODC activity as described above.In Vitro ODC Degradation AssayMouse ODC and antizyme proteins were prepared by the in vitro transcription/translation system as described previously (30Li X. Coffino P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 87-92Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mouse ODC was labeled with L-[35S]methionine during the in vitro translation and mixed with in vitro translated but unlabeled antizyme followed by the addition of an ATP-regenerating system as described previously by Li and Coffino (18Li X. Coffino P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2377-2383Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the in vitro translated, unlabeled antizyme sample was replaced with various trypanosomal cell lysates (1.5 × 106cells) for the degradation assay in an attempt to search for activity capable of degrading mouse ODC in the lysates. Treated mouse ODC was separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography.Purification and Analysis of ProteasomesProteasomes were isolated from trypanosome and rabbit blood cells according to Hoffman et al. (35Hoffman L. Pratt G. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22362-22368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, cells were lysed in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM ATP, 0.1 mM EDTA by sonication in an ice-ethanol bath. Cell breakage was monitored under a microscope. After centrifuging the lysate at 80,000 × g for 60 min, glycerol was added to the supernatant to 20% (v/v). The lysate was then loaded onto a DEAE-cellulose (Sigma) column equilibrated in the TSDG buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7; 25 mM KCl; 10 mM NaCl; 1.1 mM MgCl2; 0.1 mM EDTA; 1 mM dithiothreitol; 20% glycerol). The column was washed with 5 bed volumes of TSDG and 5 bed volumes of TSDG containing 100 mM KCl and eluted finally with TSDG containing 250 mM KCl. The eluate was then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 15 h at 4°C. The pellet was resuspended in TSDG and subjected to electrophoresis in a nondenaturing gel for 500 V-h as described (35Hoffman L. Pratt G. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22362-22368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The protease activity in the gel was detected with a mixture of two fluorogenic peptides in 30 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8; 5 mM MgCl2; 10 mM KCl; 0.5 mM dithiothreitol; 2 mM ATP for 30 min at 37°C. The fluorogenic peptides used were 20 μM Suc-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-MCA (4-methyl-coumaryl-7-amide) and 200 μM Pro-Phe-Arg-MCA (Sigma). The fluorescent gel was photographed and then stained in 0.2% Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Alternatively, the fluorescent bands were excised and soaked in 125 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8; 2% (w/v) SDS; 5% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol; 20% (v/v) glycerol for 15 h at 37°C. The samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunostaining with rabbit anti-human 20 S proteasome antibodies as described above (35Hoffman L. Pratt G. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22362-22368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Other MethodsAutoradiographic and immunostaining results were analyzed with a laser densitometer (LKB model 2202 Ultrascan). Protein concentrations were determined with protein assay reagent from Bio-Rad using bovine immunoglobulin (IgG) as a standard.MaterialsPutrescine and all of the chemicals for making Cunningham's medium were tissue culture reagents from Sigma. Spermidine was from Calbiochem. The rabbit antiserum against antizyme was raised using the glutathione S-transferase-antizyme fusion protein (30Li X. Coffino P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 87-92Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rabbit antiserum against trypanosomal ODC was prepared from purified recombinant T. brucei ODC (8Phillips M.A. Coffino P. Wang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17933-17941Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rabbit anti-mouse ODC antiserum was a gift from Dr. O. Jänne of the Rockefeller University. Rabbit antibody against human 20 S proteasome was a generous gift from Dr. M. Rechsteiner of the University of Utah (35Hoffman L. Pratt G. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol.

Donkey anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate was a product from Amersham.RESULTSEffect of Polyamines on T. brucei ODC ActivityPolyamines such as putrescine and spermidine regulate ODC activities in many living organisms including mammals (9Heller J.S.

A. 1985; 82: 4105-4109Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The presence of excessive polyamines results in dramatic reductions of ODC activities. We thus investigated the potential effects of polyamines on the ODC activity of procyclic T. brucei grown in culture medium. As shown in Fig. 1A, supplementation of the growth medium with either putrescine or spermidine up to 5 mM resulted in no apparent decrease in ODC activity in T. brucei over a period of 6 h. This is in sharp contrast to the results with rat HTC cell cultures, in which the ODC activity was markedly reduced upon the addition of putrescine (Fig. 1 B). It has been shown that putrescine and spermidine can effectively enter T. brucei cells (39Tekwani B.L. Bacchi C.J. Pegg A.E. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1992; 117: 53-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). These results thus indicate that there is no induced inhibition of trypanosomal ODC activity by putrescine or spermidine, in contrast to all eukaryotic cells examined previously.Trypanosomal ODC Is Stable in Polyamine-treated T. bruceiIn mammalian cells and Xenopus, the synthesis of an inhibitory protein antizyme can be induced by the presence of polyamines (9Heller J.S.

Antizyme reduces ODC activity dramatically and destabilizes ODC protein in mammalian cells (15Murakami Y. Hayashi S. Biochem. J. 1985; 226: 893-896Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Murakami Y. Matsufuji S. Miyazaki Y. Hayashi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13138-13141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Antizyme was also shown to interact with mouse ODC protein in vitro, inhibit ODC activity, and accelerate its degradation (14Li X. Coffino P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3556-3562Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 18Li X. Coffino P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2377-2383Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 30Li X. Coffino P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 87-92Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the above section, we observed no ODC activity change in the polyamine-treated T. brucei. Stable activity may result from the balance of both increased degradation and increased synthesis of trypanosomal ODC in the treated T. brucei. We therefore examined directly the stability of ODC protein in the treated trypanosomal cells. T. brucei cells were pulse labeled with L-[35S]cysteine and then chased in medium supplemented with 5 mM putrescine. The radiolabeled trypanosomal ODC was immunoprecipitated and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. The 45-kDa T. brucei ODC remained stable during the 6-h chase period (Fig. 2 A). There was no obvious change in migration in SDS-PAGE of the ODC from T. brucei samples treated with putrescine. On the other hand, the radiolabeled mouse ODC protein was degraded very rapidly in HTC cells upon incubation in the medium containing putrescine (Fig. 2 B), as observed previously (16Murakami Y. Matsufuji S. Miyazaki Y. Hayashi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13138-13141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Slot blot and Northern hybridizations of T. brucei poly(A+) RNA with a rat antizyme cDNA probe provided no indication of the presence of T. brucei transcripts homologous to the probe (see Fig. 4). These results suggest that antizyme is absent in T. brucei.Figure 2:L-[35S]Cysteine pulse-chase and immunoprecipitation. T. brucei cells (panel A) or mouse HTC cells (panel B) were pulse labeled with [35S]cysteine as described under “Experimental Procedures” and chased for the indicated time period with nonradioactive cysteine and in the presence of 5 mM putrescine. The cells were lysed, and T. brucei ODC (panel A) and mouse ODC (panel B) were immunoprecipitated with their respective antisera. The proteins were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Lane m in panel B is the in vitro translated product of mouse ODC. The arrowhead in panel A indicates the band of T. brucei ODC; the arrow in panel B points the mouse ODC.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 4:Northern analysis of rat antizyme expressed in T. brucei.

Sommer J.M. Cheng Q.L. Wang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11034-11037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (the transformant is herein designated Tb/MOD). Mouse ODC isolated from Tb/MOD possesses all of the in vitro biochemical properties identified in native mouse ODC, but it has little turnover in the trypanosomal cells (13Bass K.E. Sommer J.M. Cheng Q.L. Wang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11034-11037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present investigation, the Tb/MOD cells were incubated with polyamines (putrescine and spermidine) and assayed for ODC activity. Polyamine treatment caused no detectable change of the mouse ODC activity (Fig. 1 C), thus providing further evidence that T. brucei lacks an antizyme responsive to polyamines. To investigate whether this stability of mouse ODC in T. brucei cells was indeed solely due to the absence of antizyme in T. brucei, we transformed the T. brucei procyclic cells with rat antizyme cDNA in vector pTSA-Hyg2 (resulting in transformant Tb/AZ) and selected for stable transformants in the presence of hygromycin B. Similarly, each of the two stable transformants Tb/MOD and"
https://openalex.org/W2043669332,"Abstract The substrate binding properties of skeletal muscle myosin light chain kinase were investigated with a synthetic peptide containing the photoreactive amino acid p-benzoylphenylalanine (Bpa) incorporated amino-terminal of the phosphoacceptor serine (BpaKKRAARATSNVFA). When photolyzed at 350 nm, the peptide was cross-linked stoichiometrically to myosin light chain kinase in a Ca/calmodulin-dependent manner. Peptide incorporation into kinase inhibited light chain phosphorylation, and the loss of kinase activity was proportional to the extent of peptide incorporated. After peptide I was incorporated into myosin light chain kinase, it was partially phosphorylated in the absence of Ca/calmodulin. The extent of phosphorylation increased in the presence of Ca/calmodulin. The cross-linked photoadduct was digested, labeled peptides were purified by high performance liquid chromatography, and sites of covalent modification were determined by amino acid sequencing and analysis. The covalent modification in the catalytic core occurred on Ile-373 (66%) and in a peptide containing residues Asn-422 to Met-437 (14%), respectively. Lys-572 in the autoinhibitory region accounted for 20% of the incorporated label. The coincident covalent modification of the autoinhibitory domain suggests that it is located near the catalytic site. Based upon a model of the catalytic core, the substrate peptide is predicted to bind in the cleft between the two lobes of the kinase. The orientation of the substrate peptide on myosin light chain kinase is similar to the orientation of the substrate recognition fragment, but not the high affinity binding fragment, of inhibitor peptide of cAMP-dependent protein kinase in the catalytic subunit of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1571241634,"A peptidase, isolated from rat testes, is inhibited by 1 mM o-phenanthroline, 1 μM N-(1-(R, S)-carboxyl-3-phenylpropyl)-Ala-Ala-Phe- p-aminobenzoate, and 6 mM Pro-Ile, properties similar to those ascribed to endopeptidase 24.16. The enzyme hydrolyzes dynorphin A-8, neurotensin 1-13, angiotensin I, and substance P. Kinetic analysis of a series of angiotensin I analogs showed that substitutions at P-1, P-1′, or P-2′ had little effect on Kmor kcat.

We propose that this new endopeptidase be referred to as endopeptidase 24.16B, while the originally described enzyme be referred to as endopeptidase 24.16A Recent interest in peptidases has been stimulated by the finding that these enzymes can regulate the physiological action of peptides by inactivating them or by changing their mode of action. One of the best documented cases is the regulation of blood pressure through the action of angiotensin converting enzyme (EC 3.4.15.1) which converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II (1Ondetti M.A. Rubin B.

These, as well as other peptidases acting on biologically active peptides, exhibit a rather broad tissue distribution, with their physiological role dependent on substrate availability rather than on substrate specificity. Another such peptidase, endopeptidase 24.16 (EC 3.4.24.16), was first identified based on its ability to cleave neurotensin 1-13 at the Pro10-Tyr11bond (10Checler F. Vincent J.P. Kitabgi P. J. Neurochem. 1983; 41: 375-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). This peptidase appears to co-localize with neurotensin receptors in primary cultures of mouse embryonic neurons, suggesting a physiological role in neurotensin metabolism (11Chabry J. Checler F. Vincent J.P. Mazella J. J. Neurosci. 1990; 10: 3916-3921Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent studies of the enzyme showed it exhibits a rather broad substrate specificity including angiotensin I, bradykinin, and dynorphin-8 as potential physiological substrates (12Barelli H. Vincent J.P. Checler F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 211: 79-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The specificity of this enzyme in terms of bond cleavage is complex and yet to be clearly defined. The peptidase exhibits a rather broad tissue distribution and exists in both a soluble and membrane-associated form (13Checler F. Vincent J.P. Kitabgi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11274-11281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). During a study of peptidases in rat testes, we have found an enzyme with properties similar to, yet distinct from, rat endopeptidase 24.16. In this report we describe the purification and characterization of this enzyme and its similarities and differences to rat endopeptidase 24.16. Purification of Endopeptidase from Rat Testes All purification steps were carried out at 4°C. Frozen rat testes (209 g) were homogenized with a Tissuemizer (Tekmar, Cincinnati, OH) for 30 s at maximal speed in 5 volumes of 100 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.5, containing 1.0 mM dithiothreitol. The homogenate was centrifuged for 60 min at 10,000 × g and filtered through cheesecloth. Solid ammonium sulfate was slowly added to the supernatant to give 35% saturation (209 g/liter). The precipitated proteins were removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 60 min. The supernatant was adjusted to 60% ammonium sulfate saturation (164 g/liter), and the precipitated proteins were collected as described above. The precipitate was redissolved in a minimal volume of 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, (buffer A) and dialyzed overnight against 4.0 liters of this buffer. The ammonium sulfate dialysate was loaded onto a 100-ml anion exchange column, prepared from Accell Plus QMA resin (Waters), equilibrated with buffer A. After washing the column with 5 volumes of starting buffer, the enzyme was eluted with a 750-ml linear gradient of 0 to 0.5 M NaCl at a flow rate of 2.0 ml/min. Gradient elution for all columns was performed on a Waters 650 protein purification system. The active fractions were pooled and concentrated to 15 ml using an Amicon concentrator equipped with a YM-30 filter membrane. The concentrate from the QMA column was equilibrated to 30% ammonium sulfate by the addition of 9.0 ml of 80% ammonium sulfate prepared in buffer A, then loaded onto a 15-ml TosoHaas butyl 650-S column equilibrated with 30% ammonium sulfate in buffer A. After washing the column with 60 ml of starting buffer, the enzyme was eluted using a decreasing gradient of ammonium sulfate (30% to 0) in a total gradient volume of 150 ml. The active fractions were pooled yielding a volume of 10 ml. The active pool from the butyl column was adjusted to 20% ammonium sulfate by the addition of 3.0 ml of 80% ammonium sulfate prepared in buffer A and loaded onto an 8.0-ml TosoHaas phenyl 650-S column equilibrated with 20% ammonium sulfate in buffer A. After washing the column with 50 ml of starting buffer, enzyme was eluted with a decreasing gradient (20% to 0) of ammonium sulfate over a total gradient volume of 60 ml. The active fractions were pooled and concentrated to 2.0 ml as described above. The phenyl 650-S column concentrate was loaded onto a Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Superdex 200 16/60 gel filtration column equilibrated with buffer A. The enzyme was eluted with this buffer at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min and concentrated as described above. The concentrated gel filtration pool was applied to a 4.0 ml Mono P (Pharmacia) column equilibrated with bis-Tris buffer, pH 5.0. The enzyme was eluted with a gradient of decreasing pH from 5.0 to 4.0 using Pharmacia Polybuffer 74. Fractions were collected into tubes containing 20 μl of 0.5 M Tris base, pH 11.0. The active fractions were pooled in a total volume of 10 ml and concentrated to 2.0 ml. The concentrated Mono P pool was applied to a second Superdex 200 16/60 gel filtration column equilibrated with buffer A. The enzyme was eluted with buffer A at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. The active fractions were pooled in a volume of 6.0 ml. Protein was determined by either absorbance at 280 nm (1 A280= 1 mg/ml) or by the method of Bradford (14Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211784) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Determination of Endopeptidase Activity Throughout the purification, enzyme activity was followed by measuring the hydrolysis of the fluorogenic substrate 7-methoxycoumarin-3-carboxyl-Pro-Leu-Gly-Pro-D-Lys-dinitrophenylamide (Mcc1-PLGPL-Dnp, Nova-Biochemicals, 1The abbreviations used are: Mccmethoxycoumarin-3-carboxylDnpdinitrophenylamideCFPN-1-(R, S)-carboxyl-3-phenylpropylpABp-aminobenzoateHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisbis-Tris2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)-propane-1,3-diolAng Iangiotensin IDyndynorphinEnkenkephalinNTneurotensin. La Jolla, CA) (15Dauch P. Barelli H. Vincent J.P. Checler F. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 421-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). With this substrate, an increase in fluorescence occurs when a peptide bond is cleaved separating the N-terminal Mcc fluorescent group from the fluorescent quenching C-terminal Dnp group. Reaction mixtures contained 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, 30 μM Mcc-PLGPL-Dnp, and enzyme in a final volume of 200 μl. The reaction was initiated by the addition of enzyme and monitored for 3-5 min at an excitation wavelength of 345 nm and an emission wavelength of 405 nm using an Aminco-Bowman spectrofluorometer equipped with a strip chart recorder. Linear rates were obtained in all cases. A standard curve for Mcc-PLGPL-Dnp hydrolysis was constructed by measuring the total fluorescence change which occurs upon complete hydrolysis of varying concentrations of the substrate. Determination of Kinetic Constants Kior Kmwas determined by the above described fluorescent assay using the peptide in question as a competitive inhibitor. Reaction mixtures contained 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, 30 μM Mcc-PLGPL-Dnp (Km= 33 μM), peptide and enzyme in a final volume of 100 μl. Data were plotted as 1/velocity versus [peptide] with kinetic constants determined by a fit of the data to the computer programs of Cleland (16Cleland W.W. Adv. Enzymol. 1967; 29: 1-32PubMed Google Scholar). methoxycoumarin-3-carboxyl dinitrophenylamide N-1-(R, S)-carboxyl-3-phenylpropyl p-aminobenzoate high performance liquid chromatography polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)-propane-1,3-diol angiotensin I dynorphin enkephalin neurotensin. For the determination of kcatthe rate of substrate hydrolysis was determined by HPLC. Reaction mixtures contained 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, peptide and enzyme in a final volume of 125 μl. At various time points a 25-μl aliquot was removed and added to 75 μl of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid to stop the reaction. The rate of substrate disappearance, or in some cases product appearance, was then determined by isocratic HPLC. Samples were applied onto a VYDAC C-4 reverse phase column and eluted isocratically with a solvent composed of acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. The following peptides were eluted at the indicated acetonitrile concentration: Ala8-Ang I, Gln8-Ang I, and Ser8-Ang I, 20%; Dyn A-6, and Dyn A-7, 23%; Leu-Enk and Dyn A-8, 24%; NT-1-13, Dyn A-9, Asn1Val5-Ang I, Ala7-Ang I, Ser7-Ang I, Gln7-Ang I, Gly7-Ang I, 25%; Ang I, Val5-Ang I, Val5Ser9-Ang I, Val5Asn9-Ang I, and Leu8-Ang I, 26%; and, Asn1Val5Tyr9-Ang I, Asn1Val5Pro9-Ang I, Asn1Val5Val9-Ang I, and Asn1Val5Glu9-Ang I, 28%. Peptide peaks were monitored at 214 nm using a Waters 484 variable wavelength detector. In some cases gradient HPLC was used to identify and quantitate products. Determination of the cleavage sites in angiotensin I analogs was made by comparison of the product obtained, with all but the seven substituted analogs, to authentic angiotensin 1-7 by gradient HPLC analysis and in some cases by mass spectrometry. Cleavage of the angiotensins substituted at the 7 position was determined by identification of the tripeptide Phe-His-Leu which corresponds to residues 8 through 10 in each of these analogs. Determination of the cleavage sites in the various dynorphins and met-enkephalin analogs was determined by gradient HPLC by comparison of the elution position of the product to authentic standards. A number of angiotensin 1 analogs were custom-synthesized by Chiron Mimotopes Peptide Systems, Emeryville, CA. The concentration of these peptides was determined from their UV spectrum over the range of 220-330 nm. Each peptide had an absorbance maximum at 274 nm. The o-phthalaldehyde assay (17Benson J.R. Hare P.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 619-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar) was used to confirm the spectral data. In both methods the concentrations of peptide was calculated using commercial angiotensin I as a standard. Authentic rat endopeptidase 24.16 was kindly provided by Dr. Frederick Checler, Institut De Pharmacologie Moleculaire et Cellulaire, Valbonne, France, while purified rat endopeptidase 24.15 and N-(1-(R, S)-carboxyl-3-phenylpropyl)-Ala-Ala-Phe- p-aminobenzoate were generous gifts from Dr. Marion Orlowski, Mt. Sinai College of Medicine, New York, NY. A peptidase was purified from rat testes as described under “Materials and methods” using Mcc-Pro-Leu-Gly-Pro-D-Lys-Dnp as a substrate. A summary of the purification is given in Table I. Starting with 209 g of frozen testes, 80 μg of enzyme were obtained in ∼1% yield and ∼3,000-fold purification. Comparison of the activity in the membrane fraction to the cytosolic activity showed the latter to contain greater than 90% of the activity. Analysis of the purified enzyme by SDS-PAGE revealed a single protein, molecular mass of 72 kDa (Fig. 1). This enzyme had an apparent pI of 4.3-4.5, based on its elution from a chromatofocusing column.Table I:Purification of endopeptidase activity from rat testes Open table in a new tab The reaction of this enzyme with the synthetic substrate Mcc-Pro-Leu-Gly-Pro-D-Lys-Dnp was initially characterized. A Kmof 33 μM with a Vmax of 13.1 μmol/min/mg of protein was obtained. In order to classify this peptidase, the effect of a number of inhibitors on its activity were tested and are summarized in Table II. It can be seen that the enzyme is not inhibited by the sulfhydryl reagents iodoacetamide or N-ethylmaleimide, indicating it is not a thiol protease. Similarly no inhibition was observed with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride indicating the enzyme is not a serine protease. The enzyme is inhibited weakly by EDTA, but more potently by o-phenanthroline, indicating it is a metallopeptidase. The activity was unaffected by known inhibitors of specific peptidases; the neprilysin inhibitor phosphoramidon, the aminopeptidase inhibitor bestatin, or the dipeptidylcarboxypeptidase inhibitor captopril. Enzymatic activity was inhibited by N-(1-(R, S)-carboxyl-3-phenylpropyl)-Ala-Ala-Phe- p-aminobenzoate (CFP-AAF-pAB) which is a known inhibitor of two peptidases, endopeptidase 24.15 and endopeptidase 24.16 (18Millican P.E. Kenny A.J. Turner A.J. Biochem. J. 1991; 276: 583-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In addition, activity slightly increased when dithiothreitol was added, another characteristic of endopeptidase 24.15 (19Orlowski M. Michaud C. Chu T.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 135: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). However, benzoyl-Gly-Ala-Ala-Phe-pAB, a potent inhibitor of endopeptidase 24.15 (Ki= 0.02 μM) and a relative weak inhibitor of endopeptidase 24.16 (Ki= 0.66 μM) (15Dauch P. Barelli H. Vincent J.P. Checler F. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 421-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), inhibited the activity only 15% at 4 μM.Table II:Effect of inhibitors on endopeptidase activity Open table in a new tab It has recently been established that rat endopeptidases 24.15 and 24.16 can be distinguished by the susceptibility of the latter enzyme to inhibition by the dipeptide Pro-Ile (20Dauch P. Vincent J.P. Checler F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 202: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, the endopeptidase isolated in this study was in fact inhibited by Pro-Ile, whereas purified rat endopeptidase 24.15 was much less susceptible to inhibition by this dipeptide. The Kifor Pro-Ile was calculated to be 6 mM, which is considerably higher than the value of 0.09 mM reported for rat endopeptidase 24.16 (21Checler F. Barelli H. Dauch P. Vincent B. Dive V. Beaudet A. Daniel E.E. Fox-Threlkeld J.E.T. Masuo Y. Vincent J.P. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1993; 21: 692-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The substrate specificity of the enzyme was examined by first testing a number of potential physiological peptide substrates for their ability to inhibit Mcc-PLGPL-Dnp hydrolysis (Table III). For those peptides which were inhibitory, their rate of cleavage was determined by following substrate disappearance by HPLC. The results of this analysis showed that bradykinin, dynorphin B, dynorphin A 1-8, neurotensin 1-13, leutinizing hormone-releasing hormone, angiotensin I, dynorphin A 1-17, and substance P are all substrates for the enzyme (Table III). Although binding to the enzyme, as determined by their ability to act as an inhibitor, dynorphin A 1-13 and somatostatin were not cleaved at a significant rate. Met5-enkephalin and Leu5-enkephalin neither bound to the enzyme with significant affinity nor were they cleaved at a significant rate. Although not shown in Table III, it was found that neither angiotensin II nor neurotensin 1-8, at 0.1 mM were cleaved at a detectable rate, but acetylneurotensin 1-8 was cleaved at approximately the same rate as neurotensin 1-13.Table III:Kinetics of the reaction of physiologic substrates Open table in a new tab To gain additional insight regarding the specificity of the enzyme, the hydrolysis of two series of peptides, one based on angiotensin I and the other based on dynorphin A, were studied in more detail. The Kmand kcatvalues for a group of angiotensin I analogs is shown in Table IV. Cleavage of all of the peptides occurred at the same position, between the 7 and 8 bond. Substitution of the phenylalanine at position 8 with serine, leucine, alanine, or glutamine was without significant effect. Similarly substitution of histidine at position 9 with serine, glutamine, valine, tyrosine, proline, valine, glutamate, and asparagine had no effect on the kinetics of substrate hydrolysis. The only significant effect observed was a slight increase in kcatand kcat/ Kmwhen the proline, at the 7 position, was substituted with alanine, serine, or glutamine. Thus, as shown in Table IV, the results of this analysis indicate that substitutions of residues at P-1, P-1′, or P-2′ are rather unremarkable.Table IV:Kinetic constants for the reaction of angiotensin I analogs Open table in a new tab Table V shows the results obtained with analogs of dynorphin A as substrate. Although Leu-enkephalin is not a substrate, extension of this pentapeptide by one amino acid rendered it a substrate. As the size of the peptide increased, multiple cleavages were observed. The site of cleavage as well as the relative cleavage at each site is given in. With these peptides as substrates, it is difficult to see a definitive trend except perhaps that a di- or tripeptide appears to be released as product. This is consistent with the results obtained with the angiotensin series, where cleavage was essentially independent of the residues occupying the P-1 and P-1′ positions.Table V:Kinetics of the hydrolysis of enkephalin-related peptides Open table in a new tab In those cases where comparisons can be made, the Kivalues obtained are similar to those reported for endopeptidase 24.16 (12Barelli H. Vincent J.P. Checler F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 211: 79-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). However, a significant difference in the position at which bond cleavage occurred was noted between the results obtained in this study and those reported for rat endopeptidase 24.16. Analysis of the reaction of the peptidase described in this study with dynorphin A 1-8 (Tyr-Gly-Gly-Phe-Leu-Arg-Arg-Ile) as substrate revealed the presence of two products, Leu-enkephalin (Tyr-Gly-Gly-Phe-Leu) and Leu-enkephalin-Arg6(Tyr-Gly-Gly-Phe-Leu-Arg) (Table V and Fig. 3, top. The rates of product formation were linear with Leu-enkephalin being formed 4 times faster than Leu-enkephalin-Arg6(Fig. 3, inset). With the addition of 20 mM Pro-Ile, the rate of dynorphin A 1-8 cleavage was inhibited more than 80%, and no products could be detected. As shown in Fig. 3, authentic rat endopeptidase 24.16 cleaved dynorphin A 1-8 differently, yielding Tyr-Gly-Gly-Phe and Leu-enkephalin as products, a finding in agreement with the published results of Barelli et al. (12Barelli H. Vincent J.P. Checler F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 211: 79-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In the case of rat endopeptidase 24.16, Leu-enkephalin was formed ∼4 times faster than Tyr-Gly-Gly-Phe (Fig. 3, inset). Similarly, we found a difference in the cleavage pattern of neurotensin 1-13 by the peptidase isolated in this study as compared to rat endopeptidase 24.16. As shown in Fig. 4, and in agreement with the studies of Checler et al. (10Checler F. Vincent J.P. Kitabgi P. J. Neurochem. 1983; 41: 375-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), rat endopeptidase 24.16 catalyzed a single cleavage of neurotensin 1-13 at Pro10-Tyr11. In contrast the enzyme described in this study shows two distinct cleavages; one at Arg8-Arg9and the other at Pro10-Tyr11. The results of this study indicate that a soluble variant of the enzyme endopeptidase 24.16 has been isolated. Although endopeptidases 24.15 and 24.16 are similar in many of their properties, they can be distinguished by several criteria. First, only endopeptidase 24.16 is inhibited by the dipeptide Pro-Ile (20Dauch P. Vincent J.P. Checler F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 202: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Second, the peptidase described in this study is poorly inhibited by benzoyl-Gly-Ala-Ala-Phe-pAB, a potent inhibitor of endopeptidase 24.15 (15Dauch P. Barelli H. Vincent J.P. Checler F. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 421-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), yet is effectively inhibited by CFP-Ala-Ala-Phe-pAB, a inhibitor of both peptidases (21Checler F. Barelli H. Dauch P. Vincent B. Dive V. Beaudet A. Daniel E.E. Fox-Threlkeld J.E.T. Masuo Y. Vincent J.P. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1993; 21: 692-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Last, the endopeptidase isolated in this study does not cleave neurotensin 1-8, a substrate for endopeptidase 24.15,2 2D. Rodd and L. Hersh, unpublished results. but does cleave acetylneurotensin 1-8, which is not a substrate for endopeptidase 24.15 (25Dixon D.M. Traynor J.R. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1990; 101: 674-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The enzyme described here is similar to rat membrane endopeptidase 24.16 in that both are metallo-peptidases subject to inhibition by the dipeptide Pro-Ile and both share similarities in terms of the substrates hydrolyzed and in a general sense their substrate specificity. Both enzymes prefer substrates containing more than 5 amino acids, and both cleave a variety of peptide bonds with a preference for the release of carboxyl-terminally derived di or tripeptides. On the other hand, the enzymes differ quantitatively in their sensitivity to inhibition by Pro-Ile; rat membrane endopeptidase 24.16 exhibiting a >60-fold higher affinity for this dipeptide (21Checler F. Barelli H. Dauch P. Vincent B. Dive V. Beaudet A. Daniel E.E. Fox-Threlkeld J.E.T. Masuo Y. Vincent J.P. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1993; 21: 692-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). In addition the peptidase isolated in this study did not hydrolyze angiotensin II, while rat membrane endopeptidase 24.16 does (22Dahms P. Mentlein R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 208: 145-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Based on these observations and the results described below, we propose that the enzyme described in this study be referred to as endopeptidase 24.16B, and the enzyme first described by Checler et al. (10Checler F. Vincent J.P. Kitabgi P. J. Neurochem. 1983; 41: 375-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) as endopeptidase 24.16A Other differences between rat endopeptidase 24.16A and endopeptidase 24.16B are the products formed with dynorphin A 1-8 and neurotensin 1-13 as substrates. Rat endopeptidase 24.16A cleaves neurotensin 1-13 only at the Pro10-Tyr11bond, while endopeptidase 24.16B cleaves this substrate at both the Pro10-Tyr11and Arg8-Arg9bonds, the latter being the preferred site. A possible explanation for these differences is that endopeptidase 24.16A is derived from membranes, while endopeptidase 24.16B is cytosolic. However, Millican et al. (18Millican P.E. Kenny A.J. Turner A.J. Biochem. J. 1991; 276: 583-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), purified endopeptidase 24.16 from both porcine brain cytosol and membranes and found that both enzymes exhibited the same substrate specificity including cleavage of neurotensin 1-13 at both Arg8-Arg9and Pro10-Tyr11, a finding confirmed by Dahms and Mentlein (22Dahms P. Mentlein R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 208: 145-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Millican et al. (18Millican P.E. Kenny A.J. Turner A.J. Biochem. J. 1991; 276: 583-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) concluded the membrane form of porcine endopeptidase 24.16, which represents ∼10% of the total activity, is simply the cytosolic form loosely bound to the membrane. Interestingly, endopeptidase 24.16A and porcine endopeptidase 24.16 cleave dynorphin A 1-8 primarily at the Leu5-Arg6bond, with a minor cleavage at the Phe4-Leu5bond. Endopeptidase 24.16B also cleaves this substrate primarily at the Leu5-Arg6bond; however, a secondary cleavage site was found at the Arg6-Arg7bond, indicating that there may be species differences as well as variants within a species. It is of interest that dynorphin A 1-8 is a substrate for endopeptidase 24.16B since the products of its cleavage, leucine enkephalin and leucine enkephalin-Arg6, are both physiologically active peptides (23Barker J. Heale J.H. Smith T.G. McDonald R.I. Science. 1978; 191: 1451-1453Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 24Lyrenals S. Nyberg F. Linberg B. Terenius L. Obtet. Gynecol. 1988; 72: 54-58PubMed Google Scholar). It has been shown that dynorphin A 1-8 can act as a precursor for leucine enkephalin in the rat CNS (25Dixon D.M. Traynor J.R. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1990; 101: 674-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Thus, endopeptidase 24.16B may act as a processing enzyme for dynorphin A 1-8. This suggestion is further supported by examining the cleavage sites of dynorphin B. Dynorphin B is cleaved to liberate leucine enkephalin, leucine enkephalin-Arg6and leucine enkephalin-Arg6-Arg7. Thus, the 24.16 family of enzymes may play a dual role of inactivating peptides as well as converting them to other peptides with a distinct activity. Similarly, the ability of endopeptidase 24.16B to convert angiotensin I to angiotensin 1-7 may be of physiological significance. Angiotensin 1-7 is found in relatively high concentrations in the central nervous system, where it mimics some of the actions of angiotensin II (26Ferrario C.M. Brosnihan K.B. Diz D.I. Jaiswal N. Khosla M.C. Milsted A. Tallant E.A. Hypertension. 1991; 18: 126-133Google Scholar), while peripherally this metabolite acts as a vasodilator, being formed under conditions in which angiotensin converting enzyme is inhibited (27Osei S.Y. Ahima R.S. Minkes R.K. Weaver J.P. Khosla M.C. Kadowitz R.J. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1993; 23: 35-42Crossref Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Although angiotensin 1-7 can be formed either by the action of neprilysin (28Gafford J.T. Skidgel R.A. Erdos E.G. Hersh L.B. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 3265-3271Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) or by prolyl endopeptidase (29Welches W.R. Santos R.A. Chappell M.C. Brosnihan K.B. Greene L.J. Ferrario C.M. J. Hypertens. 1991; 9: 631-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), the contribution of endopeptidase 24.16 to the formation of angiotensin 1-7 must be considered. Dynorphin A 1-13 binds to the enzyme with a high affinity, but with a very low turnover. Thus dynorphin A 1-13, once formed, could act as a competitive inhibitor elevating the concentration of smaller peptides more susceptible to hydrolysis by this peptidase. Thus there can be a complex set of relationships which regulate the concentration of these peptides in vivo. The results of this study imply that a family of 24.16 endopeptidases may exist. These 24.16 endopeptidase variants may be species-specific as evidenced by differences between the rat and porcine membrane derived enzymes or tissue specific as seen in this study.

https://openalex.org/W2059334342,"We have described an enzyme in brain that catabolizes galactocerebroside sulfatide with a pH optimum of 7.2. To our knowledge, this is the first description of a catabolic enzyme for sulfatide at a neutral pH. Activity at a neutral pH implies a non-lysosomal location for this sulfatidase. Galactocerebroside sulfate sulfatidase (n-sulfatidase) activity was not apparent in crude microsomal extracts and was detected following partial purification of the enzyme. This enzyme, n-sulfatidase, differs from other arylsulfatases in its Mr, inability to bind to concanavalin A, and substrate specificity; n-sulfatidase was unable to hydrolyze p-nitrocatechol sulfate or estrone sulfate. The molecular mass of n-sulfatidase obtained by Sephacryl S-200 chromatography was 72 kDa, and the active fraction from this procedure was purified >600-fold by isoelectric focusing. Following SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, two bands were obtained with apparent molecular masses of 58 and 66 kDa. Enzyme activity was regenerated from both of these bands, with the 66-kDa band showing greater activity. The Kmof the sulfatidase was determined as 5.8 × 10-5M. The pI of n-sulfatidase was 7.7 in contrast to the pI of 4.9 for the sulfotransferase. No requirement was found for Mg2+or ATP for sulfatidase activity; vitamin K1enhanced sulfatidase activity approximately 3.3-fold. Therefore, this enzyme may have a role in the pathogenesis of metachromatic leukodystrophy in which sulfatides accumulate in the nervous and other tissues and in myelination since sulfatides are an important component of myelin.

We have studied the participation of vitamin K in sphingolipid biosynthesis initially in the vitamin K-dependent bacterium Porphyromonas (Bacteroides) levii (formerly Bacteroides melaninogenicus) (1Lev M. Milford A.F. J. Lipid Res. 1972; 13: 364-370Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When the bacterium was depleted of vitamin K, sphingolipid biosynthesis was inhibited, and further studies showed that vitamin K regulated the activity of the first enzyme of the sphingolipid pathway, serine palmitoyltransferase (3-ketodihydrosphingosine synthase) (EC 2.3.1.50) (2Lev M. Milford A.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1973; 157: 500-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 3Lev M. Milford A.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1981; 212: 424-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The role of vitamin K in brain sphingolipid biosynthesis was then investigated by the administration of the vitamin K antagonist, Warfarin, to young mice. Warfarin administration resulted in a significant reduction in brain sulfatide levels, and this reduction was reversed by the administration of vitamin K (4Sundaram K. Lev M. J. Lipid Res. 1988; 29: 1475-1479Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Vitamin K was then shown to regulate the activity of galactocerebroside sulfotransferase, which catalyzes the biosynthesis of sulfatide, both in vivo (5Sundaram K.S. Lev M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 277: 109-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and in vitro. In vitro, the requirement of the enzyme for ATP was partially fulfilled by 5 mM orthophosphate plus vitamin K (6Sundaram K.S. Lev M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 169: 927-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). During experiments on the purification of galactocerebroside sulfotransferase from brain (7Sundaram K.S. Lev M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24041-24044Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a new enzyme, galactocerebroside sulfate sulfatidase (n-sulfatidase),1( 1The abbreviations used are: PAPS3′-phosphoadenosine-5′-phosphosulfaten-sulfatidasegalactocerebroside sulfate sulfatidasePLPpyridoxal-5′-phosphatePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisIEFisoelectric focusing.) was found, which catabolizes sulfatide at a neutral but not at an acidic pH. This enzyme thus differs from the lysosomal catabolic enzyme, arylsulfatase A. n-Sulfatidase activity could not be detected in initial extracts of brain microsomes and only became apparent following partial purification of galactocerebroside sulfotransferase when catabolism of the product sulfatide was noted. Among other enzymes that break down sulfated compounds are arylsulfatase B, a lysosomal enzyme which catabolizes dermatan sulfate, chondroitin-4-sulfate, and arylsulfatase C, a microsomal enzyme which catabolizes sulfated steroid compounds at a neutral pH (8Shapiro L.J.

The role of sphingolipids and their metabolic products have been studied extensively in cell signaling, including a role for sulfatides and galactocerebroside (9Dyer C.A. Benjamins J.A. J. Neurosci. Res. 1991; 711: 699-711Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 10Dyer C.A. Benjamins J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 625-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). A neutral sphingolipid-catabolizing enzyme, sphingomyelinase, has been shown to be involved in cell signaling (for reviews, see Refs. 11Chatterjee S. Adv. Lipid Res. 1993; 26: 25-48PubMed Google Scholar and 12Kolesnick R. Golde D.W. Cell. 1994; 77: 325-328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar). A product of sulfatide catabolism, ceramide, was shown to be the active species in the sphingomyelin cycle and thus has a central role as a second messenger in this metabolic process (13Okazaki T. Bielawska A. Bell R.M Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15823-15831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although the role of ceramide in TNF-α activation of NF-kB has recently been disputed (14Betts J.C. Agranoff A.B. Nabel G.J. Shayman J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8455-8458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we report on the isolation, purification, and properties of the n-sulfatidase. A preliminary report of these results has been presented (15Lev M. Sundaram K.S. Trans. Am. Soc. Neurochem. 1993; 24: 185Google Scholar). Male Swiss mice (ICR) weighing 8-12 g were obtained from Harlan-Sprague-Dawley, Inc. and were used at 16 days old postweaned. Animals were sacrificed by CO2asphyxiation, and the brains were removed. Brain microsomes were prepared as previously described (5Sundaram K.S. Lev M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 277: 109-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The brains were homogenized in 0.32 M sucrose to give 40-60 mg/ml protein. After a 30-min centrifugation at 50,000 × g, the supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 90 min. The microsomal pellet was stored suspended in 0.32 M sucrose at −80°C at a concentration of 5 mg/ml protein. The microsomal preparation was extracted with an equal volume of 100 mM imidazole buffer (pH 7.2) containing 2.5 mM MgCl2and 0.5% Triton X-100 (buffer 1) with a protein to detergent ratio of 5:2. The Triton-extracted material was centrifuged (100,000 × g, 30 min), and the supernatant was used for further purification. 35S-Labeled sulfatide was prepared by intracranial injection of 16-day-old mice with 1 μCi of carrier-free Na2-35S-O4/g of body weight. We have shown previously that vitamin K stimulates brain sulfatide turnover (5Sundaram K.S. Lev M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 277: 109-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and we have used this property of vitamin K to increase the specific activity of the [35S]sulfatide. Mice were injected intraperitoneally with 1 mg of Aquamephyton (vitamin K1) on each day 2 days previous to injection with Na2-[35S]O4, and after 24 h, the mice were sacrificed. Sulfatides were extracted and purified from brain tissue as previously described (5Sundaram K.S. Lev M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 277: 109-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The vitamin K procedure results in a 60% increase in sulfatide specific activity over that obtained from mice that were not vitamin K-treated.2( 2S. K. Sundaram, J.-H. Fan, and M. Lev, unpublished observations.) [35S]Lysosulfatide was prepared by the following procedure.3( 3M. C. Seidel, personal communication.) [35S]Sulfatide was heated in 0.8 M KOH in methanol for 8 h in a pressure flask. The methanol was removed under N2, and the residue was dissolved in chloroform:methanol, 2:1 and applied to a silica gel plate. The plate was developed in chloroform:methanol:H2O, 65:25:4; the lysosulfatides were detected following radioautography. Cerebroside sulfotransferase was purified and assayed as described using Sephacryl S-200 and PLP-ligated Sepharose column chromatography (7Sundaram K.S. Lev M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24041-24044Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This partially purified sulfotransferase preparation from the PLP-ligated Sepharose column also contained the sulfatide-degrading enzyme. In the present studies, sulfatidase was purified starting from the Sephacryl S-200 fractions containing sulfatidase activity. These fractions were pooled, concentrated by ultrafiltration through a membrane with 10,000 molecular mass cutoff, and analyzed further by preparative scale IEF in the Rotofor (Bio-Rad) isoelectric focusing cell. To minimize the time required for focusing and to avoid pH extremes, the Rotofor cell was prefocused with approximately 48 ml of 3 M urea containing 0.5% Triton X-100, 5% glycerol, and 2% ampholytes, pH 5-8 (Bio-Rad) (solution A), at 15 watts constant power, 3°C for 1 h to establish the pH gradient. The sample containing concentrated sulfatidase fraction (1-2 ml, 5 mg of protein) was mixed with an equal volume of solution A and was injected near the middle of the chamber. Focusing was continued for 3 h. The initial conditions were 1400 V, 7 mA, and at equilibrium the conditions were approximately 2200 V, 4 mA. 20 fractions were harvested, and the pH, protein concentration, and sulfatidase activity were determined. Fractions containing activity (at pH 7.6) were pooled and rerun in the small Rotofor cell at 12 watts without additional ampholytes. Fractions with sulfatidase activity (pI = 7.6) were pooled, desalted, and used for determination of sulfatidase properties. The pI of n-sulfatidase was then determined as 7.7 using a tube gel and a surface electrode. A similar procedure was used to determine the pI of the sulfotransferase using 2% ampholytes, pH 4-6.5, in the Rotofor cell. Assay of n-sulfatidase was performed using [35S]sulfatide of known specific activity prepared as described above and purified by TLC. Sulfatide (10,000 cpm, about 10 nmol) was dissolved in 25 μl of chloroform:methanol (2:1, v/v) containing Triton X-100 (4%), evaporated under N2, and resuspended in buffer 1 (0.2 ml) containing 30 μg of vitamin K1(Aquamephyton), 0.3 ml of enzyme in total volume of 0.5 ml. After incubation for 30 min at 37°C, the reaction was terminated by the addition of 5 ml chloroform:methanol, and the mixture was partitioned into 0.2 volume aqueous 0.88% KC1. Sulfatides were then assayed by TLC (7Sundaram K.S. Lev M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24041-24044Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or the aqueous fraction was counted. In some experiments, sulfatide was tritiated (16Raghavan S.S. Gajewski A. Kolodny E.H. J. Neurochem. 1981; 36: 724-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and used where indicated. Labeled sulfatide showed a negligible (3%) loss in activity following a 30-min incubation period at 37°C in a reaction mixture containing inactive enzyme. Arylsulfatase A activity was assayed as previously described (5Sundaram K.S. Lev M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 277: 109-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) in purified sulfatidase fractions. Assays were performed in 0.2 ml containing 10 mM p-nitrocatechol sulfate, 0.2 M sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0, and enzyme. The reaction mixture was incubated (37°C, 30 min), and the reaction was stopped by the addition of 5 ml of 1 N NaOH and read at 500 nm. In other experiments, 10 nmol of [35S]sulfatide was used as substrate, and following incubation, catabolism of sulfatide was determined as described above. SDS-PAGE was performed as shown (Fig. 4), and enzyme activity was regenerated (17Kameshita I. Fujisawa H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 183: 139-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). The SDS was removed by washing twice in 100 ml of 20% 2-propanol in Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, for 1 h followed by 250 ml of Tris buffer containing 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol for 1 h at room temperature. The enzyme was then denatured by treating with two changes of 6 M gaunidine HCl for 1 h and then renatured in five changes of 250 ml of Tris buffer containing 0.04% Triton X-100 at 4°C. A portion of the gel was silver stained; areas corresponding to the two bands, shown in Fig. 4, lane D, were cut out, and the protein was eluted by electroelution. n-Sulfatidase activity was then assayed as described above. [35S]PAPS (1.6 Ci/mmol), Na-[35S]O4(carrier free), and [3H]estrone sulfate (49 mCi/mmol) were obtained from Dupont NEN, Aquamephyton (colloidal suspension of vitamin K1in detergent/glucose/benzyl alcohol) was obtained from Merck Sharp and Dohme, and EAH-Sepharose 4B and PD-10 columns were obtained from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Galactocerebroside was obtained from Matreya, Inc. (Pleasant Gap, PA) and was a mixture of hydroxy and non-hydroxy fatty acids. Other chemicals were obtained from Sigma. All of the chemicals were reagent grade or the best quality available. Brain microsomes were prepared and extracted as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Assay of sulfotransferase in brain microsomes results in a linear increase in sulfatide formation up to 90 min in our experiments, after which the level remains constant on further incubation as previously reported (18Farrel D.F. McKhann G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4694-4702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Tennekoon G.I. McKhann M. J. Neurochem. 1978; 31: 329-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar).2 However, when the extracts were passed through a PLP-ligated column and fractions were assayed for sulfotransferase activity, an increase in sulfatide formation occurred, which was followed by a decrease in lipid [35S]sulfate (Fig. 1) in contrast to results obtained using whole microsomal extracts. This decrease in sulfatide level following biosynthesis indicated the presence, in the partially purified preparation, of an enzyme-catabolizing sulfatide. In an experiment using a highly purified preparation of sulfotransferase (Fig. 1), the level of sulfatide did not decrease, supporting the presence of a catabolic enzyme in the partially purified material. Sulfatidase activity in the partially purified brain microsomal preparation was shown directly following the addition of 35S-labeled sulfatide to a reaction mixture used for sulfotransferase assay. A decrease in sulfatide level was found after 30 and 60 min of incubation, and this decrease was accompanied by an increase in aqueous [35S]sulfate (Fig. 2). The aqueous 35S fraction (96%) was precipitated by barium chloride, indicating the generation of free sulfate. n-Sulfatidase was purified by column chromatography on Sephacryl S-200; the peak n-sulfatidase activity corresponded to a molecular mass of 72,000 for the enzyme. The fractions containing sulfatidase activity were subjected to IEF on a Rotofor using ampholytes from pH 5-8. The active fraction was recovered from the Rotofor chamber at pI 7.6 (Fig. 3 A), and sulfotransferase activity was recovered at pI 4.9. This procedure was repeated and resulted in a 600-fold purification over the fraction obtained from the Sephacryl column (Table I). An IEF tube gel was run, and the pI was determined as 7.7 (Fig. 3 B) using a surface electrode. The 600-fold purified sulfatidase fraction was subjected to PAGE on a native gel; a single band was obtained, which was cut out and eluted. This band possessed n-sulfatidase activity and, when subjected to SDS-PAGE, formed two bands corresponding to molecular masses of 58 and 66 kDa (Fig. 4). No sulfotransferase activity was detected in the 600-fold IEF purified fraction following incubation with galactocerebroside and PAPS. The gel was treated as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and the proteins were assayed for enzyme activity. n-Sulfatidase activity was present in both bands; the 66-kDa protein possessed 1.6-fold the enzyme activity of the smaller, 56-kDa protein (290 versus 178 nmol of sulfatide hydrolyzed/mg of protein/30 min). As noted above, highly purified preparations of the sulfotransferase did not show a reduction in sulfatide level on prolonged incubation (Fig. 1). Further evidence that the two enzymes were distinct was obtained following chromatography on Sephacryl S-200 and IEF. In addition, IEF of the active fraction from Sephacryl S-200 chromatography gave a pI value of 7.7 for the sulfatidase and a pI of 4.9 for the sulfotransferase, indicating the differing characteristics of the two enzymes. To distinguish the activity of this sulfatidase from that of the lysosomal catabolic enzyme, arylsulfatase A, enzyme preparations were incubated at pH 5.5. No sulfatidase activity was evident at pH 4.0, 4.5, and 5.5, although sulfatide catabolism occurred at pH 7.2. The pH curve for n-sulfatidase over the range 5.5-8.0 is shown in Fig. 5; the activity of the enzyme falls rapidly at pH values less than 6.8. In addition, arylsulfatase A activity was not detected in purified sulfatidase preparations when assayed at pH 5.0 using p-nitrocatechol sulfate or [35S]sulfatide as substrate, and p-nitrocatechol sulfate was not hydrolyzed by n-sulfatidase at pH 7.2 (data not shown). A time course for sulfatide hydrolysis showed that the reaction reached a maximum at 30 min incubation and then leveled off. The Kmwas determined as 5.8 × 10-5M. The hydrolysis of sulfatide was dependent on the amount of sulfatide added over the range 5-50 μg/ml (Fig. 6). Arylsulfatases are known to bind to concanavalin A, and attempts were made to determine whether the n-sulfatidase possessed this property; n-sulfatidase did not bind to a concanavalin A column. Vitamin K, which we have shown to enhance the activity of brain galactocerebroside sulfotransferase (5Sundaram K.S. Lev M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 277: 109-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 6Sundaram K.S. Lev M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 169: 927-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), was examined for its ability to enhance the activity of n-sulfatidase. An assay of n-sulfatidase with and without vitamin K1showed that vitamin K enhanced n-sulfatidase activity approximately 3.3-fold over the preparation without vitamin K (Fig. 7). There was no requirement for Mg2+, ATP, or dithiothreitol; phosphatidylserine, which had been shown to stimulate neutral sphingomyelinase activity (20Lister M.D. Crawford-Redick C.L. Loomis C.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1165: 314-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), had no effect on n-sulfatidase. PAPS, adenosine 3′-5′-diphosphate, lysosulfatide, galactocerebroside, and ceramide were not inhibitory at a level of 0.5 μM. The n-sulfatidase possesses a higher degree of specificity than arylsulfatase A since, as noted above, the artificial substrate p-nitrocatechol sulfate, which is used to assay arylsulfatase A, was not hydrolyzed by n-sulfatidase at pH 7.2. [35S]Lysosulfatide was not hydrolyzed by n-sulfatidase, and [3H]estrone sulfate, a substrate for arylsulfatase C, was not catabolized by n-sulfatidase when assayed as described (21Iwamori M. Moser H.W. Kishimoto Y. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1976; 174: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). n-Sulfatidase was detected following studies on the purification of brain galactocerebroside sulfotransferase. Assays of the sulfotransferase with partially purified preparations showed an initial formation of the product sulfatide, which after 90 min was degraded. The degradation after 90 min suggested the presence of a sulfatidase acting at this time. The apparent lack of sulfatidase activity in the first 90 min is due to the excess sulfotransferase activity, and sulfatidase activity becomes apparent following depletion of PAPS and the resulting loss of sulfotransferase activity after 90 min. The lability of PAPS in sulfotransferase assays has been previously noted (18Farrel D.F. McKhann G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4694-4702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Taylor T. Oda K. Lingwood C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 913: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 23Cumar F.A. Barra H.S. Maccioni H.J. Caputto R. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 3807-3816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). With a highly purified preparation of sulfotransferase, degradation of sulfatide does not occur. The n-sulfatidase has been purified 600-fold over a Sephacryl S-200 fraction using IEF. Since we could not detect activity in the original microsomal fraction, the degree of purification is probably severalfold higher since we do not account for any purification obtained as a result of the Sephacryl chromatography. The 66-kDa band seen following SDS-PAGE, which contains the major activity following regeneration, may correspond to the 72-kDa activity peak from Sephacryl S-200 chromatography, indicating that the enzyme is monomeric. Since regeneration of enzymatic activity was found for both 66- and 58-kDa bands, the relationship if any between the two proteins remains to be determined. The n-sulfatidase differs from the biosynthetic enzyme sulfotransferase in several ways. n-Sulfatidase has no requirement for ATP or Mg2+; the pI for n-sulfatidase is 7.7, whereas that for sulfotransferase is 4.9; the sulfotransferase is retained by an ATP-ligated column, whereas the n-sulfatidase is not. Because of the wide difference in pI values of sulfotransferase and n-sulfatidase, there is little chance of contamination of sulfatidase with the sulfotransferase. In addition, purified sulfotransferase had no sulfatidase activity, and n-sulfatidase preparations possessed no detectable sulfotransferase activity. These facts would rule out any involvement of the sulfotransferase in sulfatide degradation. It is interesting to note that sulfotransferase activity can be recovered following the IEF procedure at a low pH. It was important to determine that the neutral sulfatidase we have described differs from known sulfatases. The major difference was in its activity at a neutral but not at an acidic pH. It also differs from arylsulfatase C, which is active at neutral pH and which catabolizes cholesteryl and estrone sulfate since the n-sulfatidase does not catabolize estrone sulfate. Moreover, arylsulfatase C and other arylsulfatases bind to concanavalin A-ligated columns (24Brattain M.G. Kimball P.M. Pretlow III, T.G. Marks M.E. Biochem. J. 1977; 163: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 25Philips N.C. Robinson D. Winchester B.G. Biochem. J. 1976; 153: 579-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), whereas n-sulfatidase does not. The inability to bind to concanavalin A would suggest that the enzyme is not glycosylated or does not contain the required mannose residues. Our results indicate, therefore, that this n-sulfatidase is a distinct enzyme. Based on its activity at a neutral pH and the fact that lysosomes have been removed during the initial preparation of the microsomes, the probable location of this enzyme is the cell membrane, although the exact location has yet to be determined. A further distinguishing feature was the high degree of substrate specificity of the enzyme; as noted above, p-nitrocatechol sulfate, the artificial substrate for arylsulfatase A, lysosulfatide, and estrone sulfate were not degraded. The highly restricted substrate specificity and a neutral pH optimum may suggest a role for n-sulfatidase in a specific mechanism such as cell signaling rather than a purely degradative role. A role in cell signaling has been demonstrated for another neutral enzyme of sphingolipid catabolism, sphingomyelinase, where a sphingomyelinase cycle has been extensively studied (see Refs. 11 and 12 for reviews).

Science. 1993; 259: 1769-1771Crossref PubMed Scopus (1547) Google Scholar), have also been shown to participate in cell signaling. Sulfatides bind to a number of compounds, including thrombospondin, p-selectin, and gp120 (see Ref. 30Vos J.P. Lopes-Cardozo M. Gadella B.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1211: 125-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar for review; see also Refs. 24 and 31McAlarney T. Apostolski S. Lederman S. Latov N. J. Neurosci.

Cell. 1991; 67: 35-44Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) in macrophage-endothelial cell interaction. In addition to our previous studies demonstrating a role for vitamin K in brain sulfatide biosynthesis and turnover (4Sundaram K. Lev M. J. Lipid Res. 1988; 29: 1475-1479Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Sundaram K.S. Lev M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 277: 109-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 6Sundaram K.S. Lev M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 169: 927-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), we now have used this property to prepare [35S]sulfatide of a higher specific activity than previously obtained. This result confirms a regulatory role for vitamin K in brain sulfatide metabolism. We have shown previously that vitamin K enhances the activity of brain galactocerebroside sulfotransferase in vivo and in vitro (6Sundaram K.S. Lev M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 169: 927-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 7Sundaram K.S. Lev M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24041-24044Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We now show that vitamin K enhances the activity of n-sulfatidase; the mechanism of the vi-tamin K activation of n-sulfatidase will be the subject of future studies. We thank Peter Cherry for helpful discussion on enzyme kinetics."
https://openalex.org/W1665952192,"Equilibrium isotope exchange kinetics (EIEK) and kinetic isotope effects have been used to determine the mechanistic basis for the altered kinetic characteristics of a mutant version of Escherichia coli aspartate transcarbamylase in which Asp-236 of the catalytic chain is replaced by alanine (Asp-236-->Ala). The [14C]Asp N-carbamyl-L-aspartate (CAsp) and [14C]CP CAsp exchange rates, observed as a function of various reactant-product pairs, exhibited dramatic increases in maximal rates, along with decreases in substrate half-saturation values and cooperativity. The carbon kinetic isotope effect, 13C versus 12C at the carbonyl group of carbamoyl phosphate, for the Asp-236-->Ala enzyme decreased toward unity as [Asp] increased, as observed for the wild-type enzyme. Both the kinetic isotope effects and EIEK results indicate that the Asp-236-->Ala enzyme operates by the same ordered kinetic mechanism as the wild-type enzyme. Although activation effects by ATP and N-phosphonacetyl-L-aspartate are lost, inhibition by CTP was apparent in equilibrium exchanges. Simulation of the EIEK data indicated that the best fit to the observed changes in saturation curves was obtained by preferentially increasing the rate of the T-->R transition, kappa T-->R, thereby destabilizing the T-state and increasing the equilbrium constant for the T R transition. A multistep model for Asp bindng to aspartate transcarbamoylase is proposed, in which Asp induces the initial conformational changes that in turn trigger the T-->R transition, followed by stepwise filling of the remaining active sites."
