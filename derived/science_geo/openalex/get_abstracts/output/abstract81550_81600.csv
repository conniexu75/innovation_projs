https://openalex.org/W2107332774,"The Xenopus embryo undergoes 12 rapid synchronous cleavages followed by a period of slower asynchronous divisions more typical of somatic cells. This change in cell cleavage has been termed the midblastula transition (MBT). We show that at the MBT the blastomeres become motile and transcriptionally active for the first time. We have investigated the timing of the MBT and found that it does not depend on cell division, on time since fertilization or on a counting mechanism involving the sequential modification of DNA. Rather, the timing of the MBT depends on reaching a critical ratio of nucleus to cytoplasm. We view the MBT as a consequence of the titration of some substance, originally present in the egg, by the exponentially increasing nuclear material. When this substance is exhausted a new cell program is engaged, leading to the acquisition of several new cell properties."
https://openalex.org/W2129923672,"Duck hepatitis B virus, a DNA virus closely related to human hepatitis B virus, was studied in infected duck liver. Subviral particles resembling the viral nucleocapsid cores were isolated from persistently infected liver and shown to have a DNA polymerase activity that utilizes an endogenous template and synthesizes both plus- and minus-strand viral DNA. Synthesis of the viral minus-strand DNA utilized an RNA template that was degraded as it was copied. Viral plus-strand synthesis occurred on the completed minus-strand DNA. A pathway for the replication of the DNA genome of hepatitis B-like viruses by reverse transcription of an RNA intermediate is proposed."
https://openalex.org/W1595656597,"The cytotoxic effects of many quinones are thought to be mediated through their one-electron reduction to semiquinone radicals, which subsequently enter redox cycles with molecular oxygen to produce active oxygen species and oxidative stress. The two-electron reduction of quinones to diols, mediated by DT-diaphorase (NAD(P)H: (quinone-acceptor) oxidoreductase), may therefore represent a detoxifying pathway which protects the cell from the formation of these reactive intermediates. By using menadione (2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone) and isolated hepatocytes, the relative contribution of the two pathways to quinone metabolism has been studied and a protective role for DT-diaphorase demonstrated. Moreover, in the presence of cytotoxic concentrations of menadione rapid changes in intracellular thiol and Ca2+ homeostasis were observed. These were associated with alterations in the surface structure of the hepatocytes which may be an early indication of cytotoxicity."

https://openalex.org/W2001743581,"A murine stage-specific embryonic antigen (SSEA3) is defined by reactivity with a monoclonal antibody prepared by immunization of a rat with 4- to 8-cell-stage mouse embryos. This antigenic determinant, present on oocytes, becomes restricted first to the inner cell mass at the blastocyst stage, and later to the primitive endoderm. Murine teratocarcinoma stem cells do not react with this antibody, whereas human teratocarcinoma stem cells are SSEA3-positive. This antigenic determinant is not expressed on a variety of other human and murine cell lines, but is found on the surface of human erythrocytes. It is a carbohydrate and is present on both cell-surface glycolipids and glycopeptides. These results demonstrate the feasibility of identifying stage-specific antigenic determinants with monoclonal antibody prepared against embryos. The need for thorough screening on a variety of cell types to establish developmentally important cross-reactivities is also emphasized."
https://openalex.org/W2064072571,"The activation of proliferative T lymphocytes normally involves the simultaneous recognition of a particular foreign antigen and a particular Ia molecule on the surface of antigen-presenting cells, the phenomenon of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) restriction. An analysis of T cell clones specific for pigeon cytochrome c, from B10.A and B10.S(9R) strains of mice, revealed the unusual finding that several of the clones could respond to antigen in association with Ia molecules from either strain. Using these cross-reactive clones, we performed experiments which demonstrated that both the Ia molecule and the T cell receptor contribute to the specificity of antigen recognition; however, MHC-linked low responsiveness to tuna cytochrome c (an immune response gene defect) could not be attributed solely to the efficacy with which the Ia molecules associated with the antigen. These results imply that antigen and Ia molecules are not recognized independently, but must interact at least during the process of T cell activation."

https://openalex.org/W2085374449,"β2-Microglobulin is encoded by a single gene per haploid genome in the mouse. This gene was cloned and sequenced and was shown to consist of four coding regions separated by three intervening sequences. Most of the protein (amino acids 3–95) is encoded in a single uninterrupted unit flanked by intervening sequences. In this respect, the genetic organization is similar to that of the evolutionarily related H-2 and immunoglobulin domains. A mutant cell line selected for loss of cell-surface expression of the thymus leukemic antigen and failing to express surface β2-microglobulin and H-2 was found to contain no detectable cytoplasmic β2-microglobulin. The genetic defect in this mutant was analyzed by Southern blots, which indicated that there are defects in both copies of the β2-microglobulin gene present in this cell. The concomitant loss of three cell-surface antigens was thereby linked to genetic defects in the β2-microglobulin locus."

https://openalex.org/W2060262724,"Previous work with Chinese hamster cells suggests that thymidine kinase deficiency and loss of potential for plating in HAT medium may arise by a process of mutation coupled with site-specific repression by bromodeoxyuridine at the tk locus. In this study, tk− Chinese hamster cells were exposed to a series of inductors to determine whether revertants for the putative second stage originate by genetic or epigenetic change. Brief exposure to 5-azacytidine resulted in massive conversion to the HAT+ state, and revertants showed levels of thymidine kinase activity intermediate between those of tk− and wild-type cells. By contrast, incidence of HAT+ cells rose only slightly in populations mutagenized with ethyl methanesulfonate. Large increases in frequency of HAT+ cells were obtained by treatment with n-butyrate and L-ethionine, which affect gene expression in other cell systems but have no known mutagenic potential. Induction of HAT+ revertants seems to be mediated by a stable epigenetic shift, which reverses the gradual extinction of thymidine kinase activity in the parent cells. The data support the view that induction in Chinese hamster cells results from changes in DNA methylation patterns, and suggest studies to define the process in molecular terms."
https://openalex.org/W2057301899,"The nucleotide sequences encoding the transforming polyproteins of the Snyder-Theilen and Gardner-Arnstein strains of feline sarcoma virus (FeSV) have been determined. These sequences include a viral transforming gene (v-fes), derived from cellular proto-oncogene sequences (c-fes) of domestic cats by recombination with feline leukemia virus (FeLV). The v-fes sequences are predicted to encode a polypeptide domain strikingly similar to that specified by the transforming gene (v-fps) of the avian Fujinami sarcoma virus. In addition, the 3′ 0.8 kilobase pairs of v-fes encode amino acid sequences homologous to the carboxy-terminal portion of pp60src, the transforming protein encoded by the avian Rous sarcoma virus src gene. Thus different feline and avian retroviral transforming genes, all of which encode functionally related proteins with associated tyrosine-specific kinase activities, must be derived from divergent members of the same protooncogene family."
https://openalex.org/W2072468798,"The gene encoding the RNA subunit (M1 RNA) of RNAase P (EC 3.1.26.5) from Escherichia coli has been isolated, and its complete nucleotide sequence, including flanking regions, has been determined. The promoter region, similar to others near genes under stringent control, and the site of transcription termination have been identified. The transcript from the gene (M1 RNA) can be drawn in a secondary structure that has approximately 60% G-C base pairs. One hairpin loop of this hypothetical structure has five contiguous nucleotides complementary to invariant nucleotides in the TpsiCG loop of all E. coli tRNAs. The M1 gene, when subcloned in the plasmid pBR325, can be amplified. It directs production of functional M1 RNA. In an E. coli strain thermosensitive for RNAase P function, the size of the gene transcript is the same as in wild-type E. coli, but less mature M1 RNA is made in the mutant cells."

https://openalex.org/W2165321825,"We describe a eucaryotic in vitro system for DNA replication derived from Xenopus eggs. In this system, priming and elongation of DNA chains occurs with unusually high efficiency on single-stranded circular DNA templates. Up to 1.5 μg M13 DNA can be converted to a completely double-stranded form by 100 μl egg extract in 1 hr at 22°C, a rate of synthesis comparable with the fastest rates of chromosomal DNA synthesis in early embryogenesis. Initiation of DNA synthesis on double-stranded circular DNA templates was undetectable however. The enzymatic events responsible for complementary-strand synthesis in vitro resemble those presumed to act at the lagging strand of the eucaryotic replication fork in vivo in three ways. First, inhibitor studies indicate that DNA polymerase a is required. Second, priming of DNA synthesis by oligoribonucleotides is strongly supported by the complete dependence on ribonucleoside triphosphates in the assay, and the detection of an oligoribonucleotide terminus of 9 or possibly 10 nucleotides associated with nascent DNA chains. Third, the priming reaction is resistant to a-amanitin."
https://openalex.org/W1506448714,"The reactivity of a series of monoclonal antibodies directed against human low density lipoproteins (LDL) has been tested with hepatic and intestinal apolipoprotein B (apo-B) termed B-100 and B-48, respectively (Kane, J. P., Hardman, D. A., and Paulus, H. E. (1980) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 77, 2465-2469). Whereas those antibodies that have been previously shown to recognize determinants close to the LDL receptor recognition site reacted only with B-100, two antibodies specific for other regions of apo-B reacted with both B-100 and B-48. Therefore, it is probable that sequence homologies exist between the two proteins and it must be considered that all or parts of the B-48 sequence may be contained within that of B-100. The specificity of the reaction of these antibodies with proteins designated B-74 and B-26 supports the concept that they represent complementary fragments of B-100. The present results have been incorporated in a theoretical map of the antigenic determinants recognized by these antibodies on the LDL apo-B."

https://openalex.org/W2132665360,"Mutations in the β-lactamase structural gene that alter the signal peptide were used to study secretion into the periplasm of Salmonella typhimurium. Processing and cellular location of mutant gene products were followed by pulse-chase and cell-fractionation experiments and by trypsin accessibility in intact and lysed spheroplasts. The precursor proteins examined never appear as a free species in the periplasm. Two of the signal-sequence mutants accumulate a precursor form that is trypsin-accessible in intact spheroplasts; the precursors synthesized by the remaining mutants resemble wild-type in that they remain trypsin-inaccessible. One of the latter mutants does produce mature protein, but at a very reduced rate. It thus appears that signal-sequence mutations can affect more than one step in the secretion process, and that processing of the signal peptide is not required for the protein to be translocated (at least partially) across the inner membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1566884392,"Mice were immunized against chick ribosomes with the use of various protocols and immunogen preparations. Hybridomas were prepared, clones screened, and specific antibodies identified by reversible protein staining followed by immunoperoxidase staining on nitrocellulose blots. Clones were obtained which secreted specific antibodies against ribosomal proteins S6, L7, L18a, P1/P2, and also against ribosomal RNA. Antibodies were typed by means of a dot-binding assay with typing antibodies immobilized on a solid support of nitrocellulose, and also characterized by their species cross-reactivities. The common determinant on proteins P1 and P2 cross-reacted with proteins of similar molecular weight in all eucaryotes tested, and with a determinant in a previously uncharacterized 38,000-dalton protein of the large ribosomal subunit. We designate this protein P0. The determinant of P0 was also present in a protein of similar molecular weight in all eucaryotes tested. Unlike P1 and P2, P0 was not removable from ribosomes by an ethanol-NH4Cl washing procedure. No evidence for a precursor-product relationship between P0 and P1/P2 was found. P0, P1, and P2 were found in active polysomes and in the nucleolus. The molecular weights of the nucleolar forms were not identical with those of the cytoplasmic forms, suggesting some processing during ribosomal assembly and/or transport."
https://openalex.org/W2068420800,"The avian retroviruses are unique among known RNA and DNA viruses in their extremely high frequencies of genetic recombination. We propose that these high frequencies can be explained by the facts that the closely associated RNA genomes of this diploid virus can be reverse-transcribed concurrently and that strand displacement is a fundamental property of the reverse transcription reaction. We have elaborated a specific model to describe this process that was suggested by the properties of novel structures observed with high frequency in the electron microscope: DNA duplexes in dimer arrangement that are linked at homologous regions by single-stranded DNA bridges. These structures are presumed to be intermediates of recombination, trapped because their generation in vitro prevents the subsequent resolution steps that would normally take place via the cellular apparatus during infection. The model generates several hypotheses whose exploration should help to test its accuracy."
https://openalex.org/W1966428323,"Studies of isolated islets labeled with radioactive leucine show that glucose at a critical time ""marks"" islets in such a way as to cause preferential release of newly synthesized insulin. The preferential release of insulin from marked islets is relatively independent of subsequent secretagogues or rates of insulin secretion. Previous kinetic studies have indicated that the critical time at which marking occurs is after proinsulin biosynthesis but before the secretory event. Thus, secretory cells may regulate the diversion of newly synthesized material for immediate release as it is approaching or transiting the Golgi apparatus."
https://openalex.org/W1560961839,"The lipogenic capacity of rat liver is increased in animals fed a high carbohydrate, fat-free diet or by the administration of 2,2',5'-triiodo-L-thyronine. Underlying this change is a generalized induction of the enzymes involved in lipogenesis, including glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, and malic enzyme, which together serve to generate the additional NADPH required for increased fatty acid synthesis. This report presents evidence indicating that induction of the hexose-shunt dehydrogenases involves increased enzyme synthesis secondary to elevated enzyme specific mRNA levels, as has previously been shown for malic enzyme. Activities of specific mRNAs, estimated by cell-free translation of hepatic poly(A)-containing RNA in the mRNA dependent rabbit reticulocyte lysate, were compared with enzyme specific activities and relative rates of specific enzyme synthesis. The 2-fold increase in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase specific activity in hyperthyroid rats and the 13-fold increase in rats fed a high carbohydrate, fat-free diet, relative to euthyroid, chow-fed controls were paralleled by comparable increases in the synthetic rates and mRNA levels of this enzyme. Similarly, consonant changes in the rate of enzyme synthesis and concentration of 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase mRNA accompanied the 2.5- and 3-fold increases in specific activity of this enzyme observed in response to hormonal and dietary induction, respectively. Thus, both thyroid hormone and carbohydrate feeding appear to induce glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase primarily by increasing the effective cellular concentrations of their respective mRNAs and, consequently, their rates of synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1970507666,"Employing enzymatic reactions containing reverse transcriptase and appropriately defined substrates, we have demonstrated that the tRNATrp primer molecule required for the initiation of DNA synthesis is cleaved from viral DNA by an enzymatic activity associated with the reverse transcriptase molecule. Since the alpha subunit of reverse transcriptase facilitates release of the tRNATrp primer from viral DNA and this activity is inhibited by a known inhibitor of reverse-transcriptase-associated RNAase H, it appears that the RNAase H activity, rather than the DNA endonuclease activity, is involved in this reaction. The cleavage site for RNAase H-mediated removal of the tRNATrp primer from viral DNA is located at or near the tRNATrp-viral DNA junction, and transcription of most, if not all, of the tRNATrp-binding site into (+) polarity DNA occurs before RNAase-H-mediated cleavage takes place. These studies indicate that an additional function can be ascribed to the reverse-transcriptase-associated RNAase H activity, which in this instance acts like an endonuclease, not requiring the unblocked termini of an RNA-DNA hybrid molecule for its activity."

https://openalex.org/W2057300583,"Herpes simplex virus (HSV) exists in humans in a latent form that can be activated. To characterize the molecular basis of the cell-virus interactions and to analyze the state of the latent HSV genome, an in vitro model system was established. In this system a large fraction of the latently infected cells contain an HSV genome that can be activated. Cell survival was reduced minimally after repression of high multiplicity HSV type 1 (HSV-1) infection of human fibroblast cells with (E)-5-(2-bromovinyl)-2′-deoxyuridine in combination with human leukocyte interferon (IFN-α). A minimum of 1 to 3 percent of the surviving cells contained an HSV genome that could be activated either by human cytomegalovirus superinfection or reduction in incubation temperature."
https://openalex.org/W2088567215,"The transcription of cloned tRNA genes that are clustered in the Escherichia coli and Euglena gracilis chloroplast genome was studied in a HeLa cell-free extract. RNA polymerase III transcribes the tRNA gene clusters into polycistronic primary transcripts, consisting of pre-tRNAVal-tRNAAsn-tRNAArg and pre-tRNAAsp-tRNATrp transcribed from the Euglena chloroplast and E. coli tRNA locus, respectively. A UV5-lac promoter in the 5'-flanking sequence of the E. coli tRNA gene cluster can be removed without effect on transcription initiation frequency. During transcription of the tRNA gene clusters, RNA polymerase III initiates predominantly, if not solely, with the first tRNA gene. Upon removal of the first tRNA gene, RNA polymerase III initiates transcription with the following tRNA gene. The primary transcripts are subsequently processed to mature tRNAs. RNA fingerprint analysis and reincubation experiments were used to establish the steps of tRNA maturation of the pre-tRNAVal-tRNAAsn-tRNAArg. The 3' trailer is processed prior to the removal of 5' leader and before cleavage of the primary transcript in the spacer sequences. The pre-tRNAs are then processed to mature tRNA molecules."
https://openalex.org/W1521995407,"Two cyclic structures, the 15-membered thiolactone A and the 5-membered lactam P, have been proposed for the metastable binding sites of the serum proteins C3, C4, and alpha 2-macroglobulin. Neither structure alone adequately explains two unusual reactions of these sites, namely, covalent attachment to nucleophiles with liberation of a thiol group and spontaneous hydrolysis (autolysis) of an internal peptide bond. The metastable binding sites of these proteins were modeled with the 15-membered thiolactone 1 (Khan, S. A., and Erickson, B. W. (1981) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 103, 7374-7376) and the isomeric 5-membered lactam 2, which contains an internal pyroglutamyl (Glp) residue. Under physiologic conditions (phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.3, 37 degrees C), thiolactone 1 and lactam 2 exist in dynamic equilibrium. Since the molar ratio of 2/1 is 11:1 at equilibrium, lactam 2 is 15 kcal/mol more stable than thiolactone 1. The activation energy for isomerization of 1 into 2 is 18 kcal/mol, which is about 5 kcal/mol lower than that for hydrolysis of the acyclic thiolester N,S-diacetyl-L-cysteine methylamide. Part of the chemistry of the metastable binding sites can be explained by an analogous equilibrium between protein structures A and B. Lactam B may be a key intermediate in the biosynthesis of thiolactone A. Under denaturating conditions, thiolactone A could either bind covalently to a receptive surface or isomerize into lactam B, which could undergo spontaneous hydrolysis of the Glu-Glp peptide bond."
https://openalex.org/W1591329640,A recombinant clone (pJY150R1.1) encoding the human major histocompatibility antigen (HLA-B7) was introduced into mouse cells and hamster cells by cotransformation with selectable genes. The exposure to mouse interferon of the cells transformed to HLA-B7+ resulted in a severalfold increase in the level of HLA antigen and RNA. The HLA-B7 clone used for the transfection includes a 670-base pair DNA sequence upstream from the coding segment. It remains to be established if the 670-base pair segment is necessary and/or sufficient to make the transcription of the HLA gene responsive to interferon.
https://openalex.org/W1573641872,"We have earlier shown that extraction of Rhodospirillum rubrum chromatophores with LiCl removed completely the beta-subunit of their coupling factor ATPase complex leaving the other four subunits attached to the membrane (Philosoph, S., Binder, A., and Gromet-Elhanan, Z. (1977) J. Biol. Chem. 252, 8747-8752). Further treatment of these beta-less chromatophores with LiBr, under the described optimal conditions, resulted in specific removal of one additional subunit, the gamma-subunit, and both subunits were purified to homogeneity. The beta, gamma-less chromatophores as well as the beta-less ones lost their ATP-linked activities, but retained their light-induced proton uptake, resulting in the formation of an electrochemical gradient of protons composed of both a pH gradient and a membrane potential. These results indicate that the removed beta and gamma subunits cannot be an integral part of an H+ gate in the R. rubrum chromatophore membrane. Each of the removed subunits could bind to the beta, gamma-less chromatophores, but such separate reconstitution of either beta or gamma alone did not lead to restoration of any ATP-linked activity. ATP synthesis and hydrolysis could be restored to the same extent to these chromatophores by their reconstitution with both beta and gamma. It is thus concluded that the presence of both subunits is required for ATP synthesis as well as hydrolysis by the R. rubrum F0.F1 complex. The identical degree of elimination and restoration of ATP synthesis and hydrolysis upon removal and reconstitution of beta and gamma indicates that in R. rubrum at least, there seems to be no reason for suggesting the operation of different catalytic sites for the two activities."
https://openalex.org/W2059554391,"A disulfide-linked conjugate between asialofetuin (ASF) and the toxic A chain (RTA) of ricin is as potent a toxin for cultured rat hepatocytes as our previously described conjugate between ASF and fragment A of diphtheria toxin (DTA). An RTA conjugate of epidermal growth factor (EGF) was a potent toxin for 3T3 cells. In contrast, EGF-DTA was essentially nontoxic for 3T3 cells. We have now examined the toxicity of EGF-RTA and EGF-DTA on cultured hepatocytes. The EGF-DTA conjugate, nontoxic to 3T3 cells, is also a potent toxin for hepatocytes. We also observed a decrease with time of culture in the sensitivity of hepatocytes to the ASF and EGF conjugates. This decrease is not a result of a decrease in EGF or asialoglycoprotein receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2167887143,"The induction of phosphorylation of both protein P1 and protein synthesis initiation factor eIF-2 alpha and the inhibition of virus replication were examined in mouse L929 fibroblasts treated with either natural mouse or individual cloned human interferons (IFN). Natural mouse IFN synthesized in Newcastle disease virus-induced L929 cells and two cloned human leukocyte IFN subspecies synthesized in Escherichia coli, IFN-alpha D and IFN-alpha A/D, possessed antiviral activity in L929 cells as measured by single cycle virus yield reduction with both vesicular stomatitis virus and reovirus. Natural L929 IFN and cloned IFNs, alpha D and alpha A/D, also induced the protein kinase that catalyzed the phosphorylation of endogenous ribosome-associated protein P1 and the alpha subunit of purified initiation factor eIF-2. Two other cloned human IFNs, alpha A and alpha D/A, were poor inducers of both the antiviral state and the phosphorylation of P1 and eIF-2 alpha in mouse L929 cells. The ability of individual human IFN-alpha subspecies to induce P1 and eIF-2 alpha phosphorylation in mouse L929 cells correlated with their ability to induce an antiviral state. Furthermore, the detailed kinetics of induction, in mouse L929 cells, of P1 and eIF-2 alpha phosphorylation and of the antiviral state by the heterologous cloned human IFN-alpha A/D were equivalent to the kinetics of induction by the homologous natural mouse L929 IFN. These results suggest that different subspecies of biologically active IFN induce equivalent antiviral activities and biochemical changes in mouse L929 cells, and that protein phosphorylation may play a major role in the antiviral mechanism of IFN action in mouse L929 fibroblasts."

This enzyme cleaves apyrimidinic DNA both 5' and 3' to the site of damage in a ratio of 60:40, respectively. Even though this enzyme can cleave on both sides of an internal AP site, it does not release deoxyribose 5-phosphate from terminal AP sites. However, a compound, tentatively identified as alpha, beta unsaturated deoxyribose 5-phosphate, is nonenzymatically released only from 5'-terminal AP sites, presumably by a beta-elimination mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2040230914,The French government has halted a program of clinical trials to test the potential antitumor properties of human interferon following the deaths of four patients from heart attacks.

Concerns have also been expressed that hospitals may have been using unregistered batches of interferon in the government-sponsored trials.
https://openalex.org/W1579801827,"Poly(A+)RNA from human term placenta was translated in a mouse-derived cell-free system. A major band corresponding to preplacental lactogen (pre-hPL) and a minor band co-migrating with mature hPL represent approximately 15% of the total radioactively labeled proteins. Analysis of the poly(A+)RNA by agarose gel electrophoresis showed a prominent band at approximately 860 nucleotides. A corresponding band was observed in Northern blots of total RNA, hybridized with 32P-labeled recombinant plasmid containing a portion of hPL cDNA. Similar analyses of nuclear RNA showed at least four additional bands at 990, 1200, 1460, and 1760 nucleotides, respectively, which are likely precursors of hPL mRNA. Poly(A+)RNA was also used to construct a cDNA library. Approximately 5% of the clones were found to hybridize to hPL DNA sequences, indicating that hPL mRNA is indeed very abundant in term placental tissue. One recombinant plasmid containing an insert of approximately 815 base pairs was isolated and characterized by restriction enzyme mapping and electron microscopy. Heteroduplexes constructed between the cDNA and the DNA isolated from an hPL genomic clone revealed four small intervening sequences which can account for the lengths observed for the hnRNA molecules."

Its activity is not susceptible to protease treatment but is destroyed by incubation with alkali. Inhibitory activity can be quantitatively recovered in the aqueous phase after phenol extraction and has the ultraviolet absorption spectrum of a nucleic acid. It is concluded that the inhibitor is RNA. The inhibitory activity sediments in the range of 3 S, but it has not been demonstrated whether the inhibitor RNA is a single molecular species. The inhibitory RNA does not affect peptide elongation but rather blocks a step of peptide initiation. It does not interfere with the formation of the ternary complex between initiation factor 2, GTP, and methionyl-tRNAMetf and does not activate a protein kinase phosphorylating initiation factor 2.

In an effort to account for these phenomena, several biochemical parameters were monitored during culture growth: the activities of the hypoxanthine transporter, of hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase, and of P-Rib-PP synthetase; and the intracellular concentrations of ATP and P-Rib-PP. All of these parameters remained virtually constant during growth of the culture, except for P-Rib-PP, which increased greater than 10-fold in a pattern similar to that for hypoxanthine uptake. The activities of the transporter, synthetase, and phosphoribosyltransferase remained stable over 7 h of treatment with cycloheximide."
https://openalex.org/W1980982515,"Within 1 day after the removal of one branch of the bifurcated axon of an identified neuron in Aplysia, the cell body reduced its output of transmitter storage vesicles to adjust precisely for the decreased need. This adjustment terminated the initial consequence of the removal, the transport of an inappropriately large number of vesicles to the remaining synapses. The most likely cause of the reduction of transport of transmitter is the loss of information normally provided by the disconnected axon or synapses."
https://openalex.org/W1508552961,"Using purified RNA polymerase II and the cloned fibroin gene of supercoiled form, we found a novel in vitro transcription initiation site. An analysis by S1 nuclease mapping showed that the transcripts synthesized by RNA polymerase II purified from three different sources gave primarily a common protection band, the 5' terminus of which was located at a specific site about the nucleotide position +25 of the fibroin gene. Such a transcript was not detected in the in vivo RNA; however, this site-specific transcription revealed a coding-strand selectivity and a high efficiency accounting for nearly 90% of total in vitro RNA synthesis. An analysis using a series of 5' deletion mutants of the fibroin gene indicates that this transcription initiation depends on a unique DNA sequence about the nucleotide position +25, which includes an inverted repeat and a sequence homologous to that around the in vivo initiation site of the fibroin gene."

The size, detergent binding properties, and products resulting from subsequent papain treatment demonstrated that chymotrypsin or trypsin removed segments of the hydrophilic carboxyl-terminal region of the heavy chain while leaving the hydrophobic (membrane-spanning) and glycosylated NH2-terminal regions intact. Chymotrypsin and trypsin caused rapid and extensive degradation of the H-2Kk heavy chain when treatment was done in buffer containing deoxycholate, suggesting that the protein undergoes partial, but readily reversible, denaturation in this detergent. This may account for the elution of H-2K and D antigens from monoclonal antibody affinity columns by deoxycholate-containing buffers."

CTC inhibited both processes at concentrations that were half maximally effective at approximately 13 and 16 microM, respectively. These inhibitory effects were prevented by either the Ca2+ chelator, ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid, or the inhibitor of mitochondrial Ca2+ influx, ruthenium red. These findings are consistent with the formation of a membrane associated calcium-CTC complex and suggest that CTC can alter mitochondrial energy metabolism during transmembrane Ca2+ cycling."
https://openalex.org/W1557447003,"Caffeine, at doses which enhance killing by UV light, inhibits the biosynthesis of pyrimidines in Chinese hamster ovary cells (K1) in culture. This inhibition was measured as a decrease in [14C]UTP and [14C]CTP accumulation after a 3-h incubation with [14C]aspartate or [14C]orotate and a similar decrease in Urd-A cells (which lack the first three enzymes of the pathway) using [14C]orotate as substrate. There was no such inhibition in Urd-C cells (which lack the last two enzymes) using [14C]aspartate as substrate and measuring accumulation of orotate. There is some inhibition of the fifth enzyme of the pathway, orotate phosphoribosyltransferase by caffeine in vitro and this is most striking at low 5-phosphoribosyl 1-pyrophosphate concentrations. The level of 5-phosphoribosyl 1-pyrophosphate is decreased in Chinese hamster ovary K1 cells by about 20% after 3 h and by about 70% after 16 h in the presence of caffeine. It is suggested that inhibition of pyrimidine biosynthesis by caffeine over a 16-h period may be due mainly to decreased intracellular 5-phosphoribosyl 1-pyrophosphate levels but that in the decrease in pyrimidine accumulation over 3 h, direct inhibition of orotate phosphoribosyltransferase by caffeine may also play a role."
