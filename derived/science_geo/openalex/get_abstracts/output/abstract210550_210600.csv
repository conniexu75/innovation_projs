https://openalex.org/W2005840740,"In rats placed in continuous darkness for 6 days, there is a striking increase in the activity of melatonin-synthesizing-enzyme (hydroxyindole-0-methyl transferase) in the pineal gland, but no change in the activity of monoamine oxidase. Since melatonin appears to have a hormonal role in mammals, and its synthesis is confined to the pineal gland, the inhibition of hydroxyindole-O-methyl transferase by light may constitute a mechanism of neuroendocrine regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2096251866,"Three types of gamma-globulins, gamma(2), gamma(IA), and yim, are present in certain body fluids and secretions in proportions significantly different from those of normal human serum. A lthough ylA-globulin is present in only small amounts in serum, it represents a major fraction of the gamma globulin of tears, bile, saliva, colostrum, and fluid of the small intestine."

https://openalex.org/W1969241454,"Biologically active, insoluble products have been prepared from soluble antigens or enzymes by entrapping them into the lattice of an insoluble, highly cross-linked synthetic polymer as it forms. Antigens, made insoluble, removed quantitatively certain or all antibiotics from complex mixtures. Seven enzymes so treated are described."
https://openalex.org/W2070531319,"Mutual adhesiveness and aggregation of dissociated embryonic retina cells in suspension cultures are suppressed rapidly and reversibly by puromycin, an inhibitor of RNA-dependent protein synthesis; and at a slower rate, irreversibly, by actinomycin D, an inhibitor of RNA formation. The results imply that biosynthetic processes are involved in the mechanism of reattachment of these cells."
https://openalex.org/W2092210455,"A genetically determined variant of lactic dehydrogenase has been observed in the red cells of four members of two generations of a Brazilian family. The appearance of the variant after starch-gel electrophoresis of the hemolysates supports the concept that the lactic dehydrogenase isozymes are determined by the interaction of two subunits which are under separate genetic control. The products of the mutant and normal allele do not, however, appear to associate randomly to form isozymes. The similarity of the relative retardation of normal and mutant isozymes in gels made with increasing concentrations of starch suggests that they do not differ significantly in size."
https://openalex.org/W1994528583,"Hyperphagocytic activity of the reticuloendothelial system induced in mice by the injection of glucan is associated with a significant increase in the primary and secondary immune responsiveness of these animals to sheep erythrocytes. Conversely, the administration of an agent which reduces endothelial phagocytosis is associated with significant depression of both primary and secnation of both factors."

https://openalex.org/W1985315886,"Acetohydroxamic acid has been identified, by paper chromatography, in the blood of three patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia on hydroxyurea therapy. This suggests that the drug is hydrolyzed yielding hyroxylamine, which then cleaves thioesters, in particular acetyl-coenzyme A."
https://openalex.org/W2090045753,"Four ingredients of a dry diet, Santa Monica, and a special food supplement, were tested for their effects on the occurrence of hepatomas in Salmo gairdnerii. When cottonseed meal was omitted from the diet, no hepatomas developed in the experimental fish. When the same diet with its usual cottonseed meal component was fed, 48 percent of the fish developed hepatomas."

https://openalex.org/W2027676164,"Mild reductive cleavage of the polypeptide chains of antibodies to the 2,4-dinitrophenyl group has been carried out according to the methods of Porter and co-workers. The addition of epsilon-2,4-dinitrophenyllysine permitted almost complete retention of the antibody binding capacity upon transfer to IM propionic acid. Fractionation of the chains showed that the hapten was specifically bound to the A and not the B chains, and that about 30 percent of the B chains were bound to A in the presence of the bound hapten. The results confirm the conclusion of Porter and ca-workers that the A chain is the principal component of the antibody site, but suggest that the B chain may also contribute to the site."
https://openalex.org/W1976415997,"Pigeons were intermittently reinforced with food for pecking at one key. Concurrent pecking at a second key intermittently produced conditioned reinforcers (the set of stimuli that accompanied food reinforcement, but not the food). Under these conditions, responding on the second key was maintained indefinitely. Rates and patterns of responding on the second key were a function of the schedule of conditioned reinforcement."
https://openalex.org/W2043010404,"A mutation in the genetic code would place new amino acids in certain loci and entirely eliminate amino acids from other loci of practically all proteins in an organism. It is reasonable to postulate that mutations of this kind cannot supplant the original code. The genetic code, once established, would therefore remain invariant."

https://openalex.org/W2053133255,"A mutant of Salmonella typhimurium, resistant to inhibition by 2, 6-diaminopurine, differs from its sensitive wild-type parent by an altered adenylic acid pyrophosphorylase. The altered enzyme, though still active with adenine as substrate, is inactive in the conversion of diaminopurine to its nucleotide. It also differs from the wildtype enzyme in a number of physical and chemical properties."
https://openalex.org/W2330005267,"THE fluid in fœtal lungs has been considered to be aspirated amniotic fluid1, an ultra-filtrate of plasma or an exudate from the lungs or bronchial system2. Scattered and casual reports have appeared in the literature to the effect that, after delivery of a fœtus by Caesarean section, fluid continues to be formed in the lungs on such a scale as to suggest that the lungs may be an important source of amniotic fluid3. However, except for one instance4, no observations on the nature of the fœtal pulmonary fluid have been reported. It has been possible to collect tracheobronchial fluid during the course of experiments on mature fœtal lambs for comparison with plasma and amniotic fluid in this laboratory. The experiments were performed for a different purpose and the observations reported here are consequently limited in scope."
https://openalex.org/W2094008850,Some agents teratogenic to the chick embryo cause serum electrolyte and fluid imbalances which initiate an edema syndrome leading to malformations. Differences in ionic composition of serum and yolk of normal chicks help explain how these imbalances can be produced.

https://openalex.org/W2075719046,"At 3 days of age, rats were (i) subjected to a febrile convulsion, or (ii) were handled, or (iii) were not handled. Evaluation at 30 days of age revealed that animals in the first group were heaviest and most resistant to audiogenic seizure stimuli. No differences were found in maze-learning ability or activity level."

The lysosomes were identified by their morphologic appearance when examined by electron microscopy, and by their acid phosphatase activity shown by both light and electron microscopic examination of Gomori-treated tissue."
https://openalex.org/W2008046674,Crosses between green and non-green Hyla regilla suggest that green color is determined by genes at two loci; each loci must have a dominant gene. Red is the result of a recessive gene and brown a dominant gene. The frequency of frogs with each color varies in different populations.
https://openalex.org/W2095487455,"Strain TE-55 of trachoma ""virus"" was extracted from infected chick-embryo yolk sacs, purified with the aid of diethylaminoethyl cellulose, and incubated with C14-glucose. Highly significant amounts of C14O2 were produced from carbon-1, but not from carbon-6 of glucose. This demonstrates independent carbohydrate metabolism in an extracellular environment by a microorganism of this group."

https://openalex.org/W2076824027,"THERE are now known to be a number of genetically determined variants of the human serum enzyme pseudocholinesterase1–5, of which the most frequent in Britain are the ‘typical’ and ‘atypical’ variants. Homozygotes for the ‘typical’ variant amount to about 96 per cent of the population, and heterozygotes to about 4 per cent. ‘Atypical’ homozygotes are only seen once among several thousands. The different pseudocholinesterase types are recognized by determining the degree of inhibition of the enzyme by dibucaine (‘Nupercaine’) following the method of Kalow and Genest1, the percentage inhibition being called the dibucaine number. The other pseudocholinesterase variants are extremely rare and they are also discovered in the first instance by their less than normal inhibition by dibucaine, with one exception, the ‘silent’ variant4 which in the homozygote results in complete absence of enzyme activity."
https://openalex.org/W2078945990,"Aerobacter aerogenes from continuous culture is killed by slow freezing in buffer or by freeze-drying. Rapid freezing in liquid nitrogen results in 50 per cent survival if the organisms are suspended in distilled water, and almost complete survival if they are suspended in 10 per cent glycerol. Ten per cent solutions of some other polyhydroxy-compounds, sugars or of polyethylene glycol protect equally well1. The work recorded here extends the investigation to other, mainly non-hydroxylic, compounds. Like the sugars, these had already been tested on human red blood cells subjected to relatively slow freezing (various workers, references below) and it seemed possible that the response of A. aerogenes would not be very different from that of red cells."

Preliminary results of an investigation by electron spin resonance were given. We mentioned the difficulties of a correct interpretation of the signals obtained on micro-crystalline powders of phenylalanine and tryptophan. Here are the first results of an investigation concerning solutions of aromatic amino-acids (tryptophan, phenylalanine, tyrosine)."
