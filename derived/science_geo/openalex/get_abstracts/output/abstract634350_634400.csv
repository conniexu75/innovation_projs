https://openalex.org/W2949177718,"Single-cell transcriptomics has transformed our ability to characterize cell states, but deep biological understanding requires more than a taxonomic listing of clusters. As new methods arise to measure distinct cellular modalities, a key analytical challenge is to integrate these datasets to better understand cellular identity and function. Here, we develop a strategy to “anchor” diverse datasets together, enabling us to integrate single-cell measurements not only across scRNA-seq technologies, but also across different modalities. After demonstrating improvement over existing methods for integrating scRNA-seq data, we anchor scRNA-seq experiments with scATAC-seq to explore chromatin differences in closely related interneuron subsets and project protein expression measurements onto a bone marrow atlas to characterize lymphocyte populations. Lastly, we harmonize in situ gene expression and scRNA-seq datasets, allowing transcriptome-wide imputation of spatial gene expression patterns. Our work presents a strategy for the assembly of harmonized references and transfer of information across datasets."

Using Organ-Chip technology, we created an entirely human BBB-Chip with induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived brain microvascular endothelial-like cells (iBMECs), astrocytes, and neurons. The iBMECs formed a tight monolayer that expressed markers specific to brain vasculature. The BBB-Chip exhibited physiologically relevant transendothelial electrical resistance and accurately predicted blood-to-brain permeability of pharmacologics. Upon perfusing the vascular lumen with whole blood, the microengineered capillary wall protected neural cells from plasma-induced toxicity. Patient-derived iPSCs from individuals with neurological diseases predicted disease-specific lack of transporters and disruption of barrier integrity. By combining Organ-Chip technology and human iPSC-derived tissue, we have created a neurovascular unit that recapitulates complex BBB functions, provides a platform for modeling inheritable neurological disorders, and advances drug screening, as well as personalized medicine."
https://openalex.org/W2948220248,"Targeting subunits of BAF/PBAF chromatin remodeling complexes has been proposed as an approach to exploit cancer vulnerabilities. Here, we develop proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC) degraders of the BAF ATPase subunits SMARCA2 and SMARCA4 using a bromodomain ligand and recruitment of the E3 ubiquitin ligase VHL. High-resolution ternary complex crystal structures and biophysical investigation guided rational and efficient optimization toward ACBI1, a potent and cooperative degrader of SMARCA2, SMARCA4 and PBRM1. ACBI1 induced anti-proliferative effects and cell death caused by SMARCA2 depletion in SMARCA4 mutant cancer cells, and in acute myeloid leukemia cells dependent on SMARCA4 ATPase activity. These findings exemplify a successful biophysics- and structure-based PROTAC design approach to degrade high profile drug targets, and pave the way toward new therapeutics for the treatment of tumors sensitive to the loss of BAF complex ATPases."
https://openalex.org/W2948495288,"The ability to inherit learned information from parents could be evolutionarily beneficial, enabling progeny to better survive dangerous conditions. We discovered that, after C. elegans have learned to avoid the pathogenic bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA14), they pass this learned behavior on to their progeny, through either the male or female germline, persisting through the fourth generation. Expression of the TGF-β ligand DAF-7 in the ASI sensory neurons correlates with and is required for this transgenerational avoidance behavior. Additionally, the Piwi Argonaute homolog PRG-1 and its downstream molecular components are required for transgenerational inheritance of both avoidance behavior and ASI daf-7 expression. Animals whose parents have learned to avoid PA14 display a PA14 avoidance-based survival advantage that is also prg-1 dependent, suggesting an adaptive response. Transgenerational epigenetic inheritance of pathogenic learning may optimize progeny decisions to increase survival in fluctuating environmental conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2948150815,"The hippocampus formation, although prominently implicated in schizophrenia pathogenesis, has been overlooked in large-scale genomics efforts in the schizophrenic brain. We performed RNA-seq in hippocampi and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices (DLPFCs) from 551 individuals (286 with schizophrenia). We identified substantial regional differences in gene expression and found widespread developmental differences that were independent of cellular composition. We identified 48 and 245 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with schizophrenia within the hippocampus and DLPFC, with little overlap between the brain regions. 124 of 163 (76.6%) of schizophrenia GWAS risk loci contained eQTLs in any region. Transcriptome-wide association studies in each region identified many novel schizophrenia risk features that were brain region-specific. Last, we identified potential molecular correlates of in vivo evidence of altered prefrontal-hippocampal functional coherence in schizophrenia. These results underscore the complexity and regional heterogeneity of the transcriptional correlates of schizophrenia and offer new insights into potentially causative biology."
https://openalex.org/W2948393771,"It is unknown whether the activity of the nervous system can be inherited. In Caenorhabditis elegans nematodes, parental responses can transmit heritable small RNAs that regulate gene expression transgenerationally. In this study, we show that a neuronal process can impact the next generations. Neurons-specific synthesis of RDE-4-dependent small RNAs regulates germline amplified endogenous small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and germline gene expression for multiple generations. Further, the production of small RNAs in neurons controls the chemotaxis behavior of the progeny for at least three generations via the germline Argonaute HRDE-1. Among the targets of these small RNAs, we identified the conserved gene saeg-2, which is transgenerationally downregulated in the germline. Silencing of saeg-2 following neuronal small RNA biogenesis is required for chemotaxis under stress. Thus, we propose a small-RNA-based mechanism for communication of neuronal processes transgenerationally."
https://openalex.org/W2948558658,"Alternative polyadenylation (APA) is a major driver of transcriptome diversity in human cells. Here, we use deep learning to predict APA from DNA sequence alone. We trained our model (APARENT, APA REgression NeT) on isoform expression data from over 3 million APA reporters. APARENT's predictions are highly accurate when tasked with inferring APA in synthetic and human 3'UTRs. Visualizing features learned across all network layers reveals that APARENT recognizes sequence motifs known to recruit APA regulators, discovers previously unknown sequence determinants of 3' end processing, and integrates these features into a comprehensive, interpretable, cis-regulatory code. We apply APARENT to forward engineer functional polyadenylation signals with precisely defined cleavage position and isoform usage and validate predictions experimentally. Finally, we use APARENT to quantify the impact of genetic variants on APA. Our approach detects pathogenic variants in a wide range of disease contexts, expanding our understanding of the genetic origins of disease."

DNA-damaging chemotherapeutics, such as cisplatin, have been the mainstay of cancer treatment for decades. DNA lesions generated by these therapies cannot be utilized by high-fidelity replicative DNA polymerases as the template, thus blocking the progression of the replication fork, generating cytotoxicity, and ultimately causing cell death. To promote survival, cells employ specialized DNA polymerases to bypass the lesion site at the cost of replication fidelity in a process known as translesion synthesis (TLS) (Makarova and Burgers, 2015Makarova A.V. Burgers P.M. Eukaryotic DNA polymerase ζ.DNA Repair (Amst.). 2015; 29: 47-55Google Scholar, Vaisman and Woodgate, 2017Vaisman A. Woodgate R.

Translesion and repair DNA polymerases: diverse structure and mechanism.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2018; 87: 239-261Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, TLS occurs in a two-step process in which insertion TLS DNA polymerases, such as POL κ, POL ι, POL η, or REV1, first introduce a nucleotide opposite the lesion. This is followed by elongation of the resulting 3′ terminus by an extension TLS DNA polymerase, such as the B-family polymerase complex POL ζ (POL ζ4: REV3L/REV7/POLD2/POLD3; Baranovskiy et al., 2012Baranovskiy A.G.

A four-subunit DNA polymerase ζ complex containing Pol δ accessory subunits is essential for PCNA-mediated mutagenesis.Nucleic Acids Res. 2012; 40: 11618-11626Google Scholar). Although TLS carried out by certain insertion DNA polymerases over their cognate lesions can be relatively accurate, for example, POL η over a cyclobutane thymine-thymine dimer (McCulloch et al., 2004McCulloch S.D. Kokoska R.J. Chilkova O. Welch C.M. Johansson E. Burgers P.M. Kunkel T.A. Enzymatic switching for efficient and accurate translesion DNA replication.Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 4665-4675Google Scholar), the major mutagenic branch of TLS is characterized by its dependence on REV1 and POL ζ. The ca. 100-amino-acid REV1 C-terminal domain (CTD) plays a major role in coordinating TLS, using one interface to recruit the insertion TLS polymerases POL κ, POL ι, and POL η and a second interface to recruit POL ζ through an interaction with its REV7 component (Yamanaka et al., 2017Yamanaka K. Chatterjee N. Hemann M.T. Walker G.C. Inhibition of mutagenic translesion synthesis: A possible strategy for improving chemotherapy?.PLoS Genet. 2017; 13: e1006842Google Scholar). Genetic inhibition of TLS through RNA-mediated depletion of REV1 or REV3L, the catalytic subunit of mammalian POL ζ, strikingly sensitizes a variety of cancer cells to DNA-damaging chemotherapeutics (Doles et al., 2010Doles J.

Error-prone translesion synthesis mediates acquired chemoresistance.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Although small-molecule compounds interfering with aspects of TLS have been reported (Actis et al., 2016Actis M.L. Ambaye N.D. Evison B.J. Shao Y. Vanarotti M. Inoue A. McDonald E.T. Kikuchi S.

A comprehensive strategy to discover inhibitors of the translesion synthesis DNA polymerase κ.PLoS ONE. 2012; 7: e45032Google Scholar), none has yet been shown to demonstrate in vivo efficacy. Obtaining a specific inhibitor of mutagenic TLS is inherently challenging because TLS and replicative polymerases share both common substrates and interaction partners (e.g., PCNA), and some components of TLS DNA polymerases, such as REV7, are additionally implicated in cellular functions beyond TLS (Bhat et al., 2015Bhat A.

The evolutionarily conserved interaction between REV1 and POL ζ, mediated by a shallow pocket on the REV1 CTD and the REV7 subunit of POL ζ, plays a critical and specific role in mutagenic TLS, but not accurate lesion bypass (Hashimoto et al., 2012Hashimoto K. Cho Y. Yang I.Y. Akagi J. Ohashi E. Tateishi S. de Wind N. Hanaoka F. Ohmori H. Moriya M. The vital role of polymerase ζ and REV1 in mutagenic, but not correct, DNA synthesis across benzo[a]pyrene-dG and recruitment of polymerase ζ by REV1 to replication-stalled site.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 9613-9622Google Scholar), rendering such a protein-protein interaction an ideal target for small molecule intervention. Therefore, we designed an ELISA assay to screen for small molecule inhibitors that specifically target the REV7-binding surface of the REV1 CTD to disrupt the REV1-REV7 interaction. An initial obstacle to developing a robust assay for monitoring the REV1-REV7 interaction was the instability of the REV1 CTD in solution. However, by fusing the REV1 CTD C-terminally to the POL κ RIR (REV1-interacting region) peptide, which induces the folding of the disordered N-terminal loop of the REV1 CTD into a hairpin conformation (Wojtaszek et al., 2012bWojtaszek J. Liu J. D’Souza S. Wang S. Xue Y. Walker G.C. Zhou P. Multifaceted recognition of vertebrate Rev1 by translesion polymerases ζ and κ.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 26400-26408Google Scholar), we were able to dramatically improve the stability of the REV1 CTD. Our structural analysis of this chimeric REV1 CTD protein (referred to as cREV1 CTD below) at 2.03 Å resolution (Figure S1A; structure statistics shown in Table S1) revealed a REV1 CTD conformation nearly identical to that observed in our previously published structure of the REV1 CTD in complex with the free POL κ RIR peptide (backbone root-mean-square deviation [RMSD] of 0.45 Å), with the fused POL κ RIR peptide binding to the REV1-insertion polymerase interface (Wojtaszek et al., 2012bWojtaszek J. Liu J. D’Souza S. Wang S. Xue Y. Walker G.C. Zhou P. Multifaceted recognition of vertebrate Rev1 by translesion polymerases ζ and κ.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 26400-26408Google Scholar) and with the evolutionarily conserved REV7-binding surface of the REV1 CTD unoccupied (Wojtaszek et al., 2012aWojtaszek J. Lee C.J. D’Souza S. Minesinger B. Kim H. D’Andrea A.D. Walker G.C. Zhou P.

Chem. 2012; 287: 33836-33846Google Scholar; Figure S1B). The linker loop connecting the POL κ RIR and the REV1 CTD and the C-terminal tail of the REV1 CTD were invisible in the crystal structure of the apo protein, reflecting their dynamic nature. In the ELISA assay (Figure 1A), purified His8-REV7 co-expressed with a REV3 peptide (referred to as His8-REV7/3 below) was immobilized in Ni2+-NTA-coated wells, and its ability to retain the FLAG-tagged cREV1 CTD in the presence of small molecule inhibitors was probed by the horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-FLAG antibody. Using this ELISA assay, we screened ∼10,000 structurally diverse compounds from the LOPAC and PRESTWICK libraries, as well as representative compounds from the Korea Chemical Bank compound collection. We identified a 1,4-dihydroquinolin-4-one derivative, JH-RE-06, that potently inhibited the REV1-REV7 interaction at a concentration of 10 μM. JH-RE-06 was re-synthesized in large scale (Figure S2A), and its ability to disrupt the REV1-REV7 interaction in a dose-dependent manner was determined in the quantitative AlphaScreen assay by using the anti-FLAG donor beads (to detect the FLAG-tagged cREV1 CTD) and anti-His acceptor beads (to detect His8-REV7/3), revealing an IC50 value of 0.78 μM (Figure 1B). Corroborating the AlphaScreen assay, a similar value of dissociation constant (Kd = 0.42 μM) was determined by using the isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) measurements (Figure S2B).Figure S2Synthesis and Characterization of JH-RE-06 and Its Analog JH-RE-25, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) The synthetic routes of JH-RE-06 and JH-RE-25.

We next probed the atomic details of the interaction between the REV1 CTD and JH-RE-06 by determining the co-crystal structure of the cREV1 CTD/JH-RE-06 complex at 1.50-Å resolution (Figure 2A; structure statistics shown in Table S1). The location of the JH-RE-06 compound is very well defined by the omit electron density map (Figures 2A and 2B). Although the co-crystal structure indeed confirmed that the previously described evolutionarily conserved REV7-binding surface of the REV1 CTD (Wojtaszek et al., 2012aWojtaszek J. Lee C.J. D’Souza S. Minesinger B. Kim H. D’Andrea A.D. Walker G.C. Zhou P. Structural basis of Rev1-mediated assembly of a quaternary vertebrate translesion polymerase complex consisting of Rev1, heterodimeric polymerase (Pol) ζ, and Pol κ.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 33836-33846Google Scholar) is the target site of JH-RE-06, it also revealed an unexpected binding mode: JH-RE-06 binds to the REV1 CTD by inducing dimerization of the protein such that the compound is almost completely encapsulated inside the REV1 CTD dimer (Figures 2A and 2B). The REV1 CTD dimer is formed in an asymmetric, tail-to-tail fashion, with the REV7-binding pockets from the two protomers facing each other and merging into a deep cavity to accommodate the binding of JH-RE-06. The core four-helix bundle of the REV1 CTD and the POL κ RIR helix of the chimeric protein are largely unperturbed in comparison with those in the POL κ RIR-REV1 CTD-REV7/3 complex (Figure S3A), whereas the disordered loop connecting the POL κ RIR and the REV1 CTD in the chimeric protein displays different conformations in the two protomers of the inhibitor-bound complex. The C-terminal tail of the REV1 CTD, which is also dynamic and invisible in the apo structure, adopts distinct conformations in the two protomers: the C-terminal tail in protomer B of the REV1 CTD is nearly superimposable with that of the REV1 CTD in the POL κ RIR-REV1 CTD-REV7/3 complex (Figure S3A), whereas the C-terminal tail of protomer A is pushed out by the acyl chain and bulky 1,4-dihydroquinolinone group of JH-RE-06, with the C-terminal residue (T1249) swinging over a distance of 15.8 Å (Figure S3B). Remarkably, the relocated C-terminal tail of protomer A now pairs up with the unperturbed C-terminal tail of protomer B to form an antiparallel β sheet as part of the ligand-binding pocket, thereby stabilizing the REV1 CTD dimer (Figure 2A, inset). Thus, not only does asymmetric JH-RE-06 have the rare attribute of interacting simultaneously but differently with two REV1 CTDs, but it also has the second rare attribute that one of its binding modes induces a conformational change enabling dimerization. Nearly all of the functional groups of JH-RE-06 are engaged in the interactions with one or the other of the two REV1 CTDs that form the dimer. A large number of hydrophobic interactions are observed between the acyl chain, the substituted aniline moiety, and the central 1,4-dihydroquinolinone group of JH-RE-06 and hydrophobic residues from both subunits of the REV1 CTD dimer (e.g., I1196, L1201, L1204, L1238, Y1242, L1246, and V1248; Figure 2C); direct polar interactions are also observed between the nitro, hydroxyl, and carbonyl groups of the 1,4-dihydroquinolinone moiety of JH-RE-06 and sidechains of Q1235 and S1244 of the REV1 CTD (Figure 2C). Of particular note, the formation of the REV1 CTD dimer not only creates a large binding pocket for JH-RE-06 but also conceals the REV7-binding surface of the REV1 CTD, thus blocking the REV1 CTD interaction with REV7 (Figure 2D). In order to eliminate the possibility that the compound-binding-induced dimerization of the REV1 CTD reflects a crystal-packing artifact, we tested the ability of disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS) to crosslink the REV1 CTD in the absence and presence of JH-RE-06 in solution. We found that the level of the crosslinked, dimeric form of the cREV1 CTD was significantly enhanced in the presence of JH-RE-06, but not in the absence of the compound, confirming that JH-RE-06 binding indeed promotes the formation of the REV1 CTD dimer in solution (Figure 2E). Such a conclusion is further corroborated by our ITC measurements of the REV1 CTD interaction with JH-RE-06, which revealed a protein-to-inhibitor binding stoichiometry of 2.04 in solution (Figure S2B). After elucidating the atomic details of the JH-RE-06 binding mode to the REV1 CTD, we tested whether JH-RE-06 is active in living mammalian cells by evaluating its ability to enhance the cytotoxicity of cisplatin in a variety of different cell lines, including HT1080 (human fibrosarcoma), A375 (human melanoma), KP (mouse KrasG12D;p53−/− lung adenocarcinoma), LNCap (human prostate adenocarcinoma), AG01522 (human primary cells), and, as shown below, MEFs (mouse embryonic fibroblasts). The addition of JH-RE-06 significantly decreased the ability of all the cisplatin-treated cancer cells to form colonies (Figures 3A–3D and 4A ), except for AG01522 cells (Figure 3E), where JH-RE-06 does not further enhance cisplatin cytotoxicity in these non-cancerous cells. The enhanced cisplatin cytotoxicity caused by JH-RE-06 in cancer cells and not the primary cells was further confirmed using the CellTiter-Glo assay (Figures S4A and S4B). We also used a variant of the previously published quantitative assay based on a gapped plasmid carrying an intrastrand cisplatin-1,2-GG adduct in the single-stranded region opposite to the gap (Avkin et al., 2004Avkin S.

Statistical analysis: Student’s t test. ∗p < 0.05; ∗∗p < 0.01. Consistent with JH-RE-06 acting by inhibiting TLS, we found that JH-RE-06 sensitized KP cells to other DNA-damaging agents besides cisplatin, including the bulky DNA-damaging agent benzo[α]pyrene diol epoxide (BPDE), the UV-mimetic 4-nitroquinolone 1-oxide (4-NQO), and the alkylating agent methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) (Figure S4C). Even more importantly, our observations indicated that JH-RE-06 acts by inhibiting mutagenic TLS because it also decreased the frequency of both spontaneous and cisplatin-induced HPRT mutations in HT1080 cells (Figure 3F). In this assay, mutations that inactivate the HPRT gene prevent cells from incorporating the toxic guanine analog, 6-thioguanine (6-TG), into DNA and allow cells to survive in the 6-TG selection medium. To test our prediction that the mutagenic TLS inhibited by JH-RE-06 is REV1 dependent, we employed an isogenic pair of wild-type (Rev1+/+) and knockout (Rev1−/−) MEF cell lines. We found that treatment of the Rev1+/+ and Rev1−/− MEF cells with JH-RE-06 alone had little effect on cell survival, indicating that JH-RE-06 has minimal toxicity on its own. However, JH-RE-06 strikingly increased the ability of cisplatin to kill Rev1+/+ MEF cells (Figure 4A), but not Rev1−/− MEF cells (Figure 4B). Furthermore, the lack of JH-RE-06-mediated sensitization to cisplatin in Rev1−/− MEF cells was completely reversed"
https://openalex.org/W2949201915,"mRNA translation is a key step in decoding genetic information. Genetic decoding is surprisingly heterogeneous because multiple distinct polypeptides can be synthesized from a single mRNA sequence. To study translational heterogeneity, we developed the MoonTag, a fluorescence labeling system to visualize translation of single mRNAs. When combined with the orthogonal SunTag system, the MoonTag enables dual readouts of translation, greatly expanding the possibilities to interrogate complex translational heterogeneity. By placing MoonTag and SunTag sequences in different translation reading frames, each driven by distinct translation start sites, start site selection of individual ribosomes can be visualized in real time. We find that start site selection is largely stochastic but that the probability of using a particular start site differs among mRNA molecules and can be dynamically regulated over time. This study provides key insights into translation start site selection heterogeneity and provides a powerful toolbox to visualize complex translation dynamics."

Taken together, these results provide a framework for understanding the physiology and pathophysiology of the intermediate cerebellum during precise skilled movements. A hallmark of cerebellar damage is a unique decomposition of reaching movements, termed dysmetria (Holmes, 1917Holmes G. The symptoms of acute cerebellar injuries due to gunshot injuries.Brain. 1917; 40: 461-535Crossref Scopus (472) Google Scholar). During movement, people with cerebellar damage exhibit a tremor-like oscillation of the limb, especially noticeable as over- and undershooting of target endpoint (Bonnefoi-Kyriacou et al., 1998Bonnefoi-Kyriacou B. Legallet E. Lee R.G. Trouche E. Spatio-temporal and kinematic analysis of pointing movements performed by cerebellar patients with limb ataxia.Exp. Brain Res. 1998; 119: 460-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). These kinematic features resemble a control system lacking the ability to predictively guide the limb to the target, relying instead on slow sensory feedback, thus producing oscillatory movements. The striking features of dysmetria, combined with decades of research identifying associative learning mechanisms in the cerebellar cortex, support a view of the cerebellum as an essential predictive modulator of movement (Ohyama et al., 2003Ohyama T.

However, the mechanisms translating these predictions into motor control are matters of significant debate, especially for the sole output regions of the cerebellum, the cerebellar nuclei. More specifically, the contribution of cerebellar nuclear activity to reaching movements remains obscure. The cerebellum exhibits broad functional topography, with intermediate regions being clearly involved in limb control. Inactivation or lesion of the anterior interposed nucleus (IntA), an output structure of the intermediate cerebellum, recapitulates some aspects of dysmetria seen in cerebellar patients (Cooper et al., 2000Cooper S.E.

Furthermore, early studies in decorticate preparations revealed limb movement in response to electrical stimulation of the intermediate cerebellum, with a general bias toward flexor activation (Magoun et al., 1935Magoun H. Hare W. Ranson S. Electrical stimulation of the interior of the cerebellum in the monkey.Am. J. Physiol. 1935; 112: 329-339Crossref Google Scholar, Miller and Laughton, 1928Miller F.R. Laughton N.B.

However, these and more contemporary studies note complex dependencies on limb state, even observing antagonistic effects (e.g., extensor versus flexor activation) under different baseline conditions (Ekerot et al., 1995Ekerot C.F. Jörntell H. Garwicz M. Functional relation between corticonuclear input and movements evoked on microstimulation in cerebellar nucleus interpositus anterior in the cat.Exp. Brain Res. 1995; 106: 365-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Moreover, significant disagreement exists over the basic question of whether cerebellar stimulation has reduced or enhanced effects during movement compared with quiescence, with some authors reporting increased but variable effects during movement (Krauzlis and Miles, 1998Krauzlis R.J.

The variability of effects of IntA stimulation reported across contexts leaves open the question of the causal role of IntA in shaping reach kinematics, motivating experiments that modulate nuclear activity specifically during reach. Recordings from neurons in the intermediate cerebellum also support a specific role during active limb control. Purkinje neurons in the intermediate cerebellar cortex exhibit strong encoding of limb movement kinematics, mirroring results in other motor behaviors, including eye, whisker, and eyelid movements (Chen et al., 2016Chen S.

In contrast, IntA neurons exhibit large rate fluctuations specifically during reach-to-grasp movements (as opposed to single-joint movements or control of manipulanda) (Gibson et al., 1996Gibson A.R.

Red nucleus: role in motor control.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1991; 1: 610-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Thus, fluctuations in IntA activity during reach likely influence ongoing control, yet the rules governing this interaction remain uncharacterized. One intriguing hypothesis given observations of dysmetria following IntA damage is that IntA may act as a “brake” during reach, signaling limb endpoint, although this theory is only indirectly supported (Ekerot et al., 1997Ekerot C.F. Garwicz M. Jörntell H. The control of forelimb movements by intermediate cerebellum.Prog. Brain Res. 1997; 114: 423-429Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Hore et al., 1991Hore J. Wild B. Diener H.C. Cerebellar dysmetria at the elbow, wrist, and fingers.J. Neurophysiol. 1991; 65: 563-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Importantly, the nature of the functional relationship between IntA neural activity and limb movement during reaching, including its sign, strength, and context dependence, remains unknown. Without any clear description of the causal relationship between IntA activity and the kinematic parameters of reach, functional interpretations of reach-associated IntA activity remain necessarily incomplete. In this study, we sought to identify causal relationships between IntA activity and reach kinematics and relate those findings to recordings of endogenous activity during reach behavior. Using a novel kinematic closed-loop system for optogenetic manipulation of IntA during reach, we found that IntA activity exerts monotonic, directional control over reach kinematics across a wide range of activity levels. Recordings of IntA neurons during unstimulated reaches revealed that this causal relationship is leveraged endogenously to slow the limb near endpoint and is scaled to modulate deceleration relative to early reach velocity, illustrating online contributions of IntA to reach endpoint precision. Taken together, these results identify the existence and utility of a directional, scalable motor controller for reach kinematics in IntA. We relate these observations to those made in cerebellar control of other effectors, highlighting shared principles of cerebellar control across movements with differing degrees of freedom and skill. Several studies in cats and monkeys report rate fluctuations in IntA neurons during limb movement, yet these investigations of encoding properties have resulted in little consensus about IntA function (Armstrong and Edgley, 1984Armstrong D.M. Edgley S.A. Discharges of nucleus interpositus neurones during locomotion in the cat.J. Physiol. 1984; 351: 411-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, Burton and Onoda, 1977Burton J.E.

Neurophysiol. 1978; 41: 654-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). One consistent observation is that IntA neurons are particularly modulated by reach-to-grasp movements (Gibson et al., 1996Gibson A.R. Horn K.M. Stein J.F. Van Kan P.L. Activity of interpositus neurons during a visually guided reach.Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1996; 74: 499-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, van Kan et al., 1993van Kan P.L. Houk J.C.

Physiol. 1994; 480: 171-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), though a lack of quantitative movement tracking prevented direct comparisons with specific kinematic features of reach. In this study, we combine quantitative measurement of reaching movements with in vivo recording and manipulations of IntA activity in order to further elucidate the mechanisms of reach control implemented by IntA. We therefore leveraged machine vision motion capture technology to accurately track the spatiotemporal trajectories of reaching movements in mice, which have recently become a model system for studying the neural mechanisms underlying skilled reach behavior (Azim et al., 2014Azim E.

We then recorded single-unit IntA activity with tetrodes (n = 84 neurons, N = 4 mice) while simultaneously tracking three-dimensional (3D) paw position during reaching behavior (Figure 1A; Figure S1; Video S1; n = 7,039 reaches, spatial resolution 150 μm, frame rate 120 Hz). eyJraWQiOiI4ZjUxYWNhY2IzYjhiNjNlNzFlYmIzYWFmYTU5NmZmYyIsImFsZyI6IlJTMjU2In0.eyJzdWIiOiIxZmY0Nzg2MzExZWEzMzUwZWMyNDY3ZWI2ZmY5YWZkYiIsImtpZCI6IjhmNTFhY2FjYjNiOGI2M2U3MWViYjNhYWZhNTk2ZmZjIiwiZXhwIjoxNjc3NzQyOTA4fQ.LD-0Bdd94up1DV67MXlb36fLX9kG1a6nOuAIVnWQzcghsiH8lzqq6gnUhaJFB8SnS2wUarO6YSIYoPZGszrse5NOcwzItdTBk-dE9W5OIcFFgdoV7dhtCADAIzeKx6glbZfHAhtN16sT6HWGrfQoty9OblzmHN9_fsbkchKU73D_M32LdLhxGoAuajfmPlPy99bwNmmMffTS-dWa10dP0_YP9v08krL49_A6QdO1fssQbv5e__LIuoldOdPCxovzQTTnBpHQ5Vl1GVYZ9MJzxiseTZQEd0tGeByaXT9VXQZbUiLYE75jL_4zFxbSr2ufI3opuJYTDEG8ybarH14yMQ Download .mp4 (1.31 MB) Help with .mp4 files Video S1. Real-Time Tracking of Mouse Reach Kinematics, Related to Figure 1Video example of an unstimulated reach (left) and three-dimensional paw position data (right; side view) that was captured in real time during the experiment. All videos slowed to 25% actual speed. We first confirmed that IntA neurons are modulated during reaching movements in mice. IntA neurons had a baseline firing rate of 39.1 ± 23.7 Hz (mean ± SD), with most neurons exhibiting modulation during reach (average peak rate 66.0 ± 56.4 Hz; p < 0.0001, Wilcoxon signed rank test). Aligning activity to reach start, as has been done previously (van Kan et al., 1993van Kan P.L. Houk J.C. Gibson A.R. Output organization of intermediate cerebellum of the monkey.J. Neurophysiol. 1993; 69: 57-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), we observed a broad tiling of activity during the reach (Figures S2A and S2B). However, because the hallmark deficit of IntA lesions, dysmetria, is most prominent around reach endpoint (Holmes, 1917Holmes G. The symptoms of acute cerebellar injuries due to gunshot injuries.Brain. 1917; 40: 461-535Crossref Scopus (472) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that IntA activity might exhibit unique patterning at or near this kinematic landmark. We therefore aligned IntA neural activity to reach endpoint and calculated average neural responses on a per cell basis (Figure 1B). Across the population of IntA neurons, endpoint alignment revealed a striking organization of peak activation times near reach endpoint (Figure 1C, top panel). The clear clustering of activity increases that occurred specifically during the deceleration phase of the outreach argued for a reach phase-specific role for many neurons in IntA (Figures 1C and 1D; n = 35 of 84 neurons, peak mean firing rate within 100 ms of endpoint; 2,000 ms analysis window). Peak mean firing rate times were significantly more clustered around endpoint than reach start (Figure 1D; Figure S2C; p < 0.0001, chi-square test; n = 11 of 84 neurons, peak activity within 100 ms of reach start). Moreover, firing rates were also less variable over trials when aligned to reach endpoint versus reach start (mean Fano factor, reach start [FFs], 2.2 ± 0.2; mean Fano factor, reach endpoint [FFe], 1.7 ± 0.1; p < 0.0001, Wilcoxon signed rank; FFs > FFe for 61 of 84 neurons). This selective engagement of IntA neurons near reach endpoint raised the question of whether this activity is causally related to reach kinematics. Endpoint-aligned activity in IntA could be contributing directly to limb deceleration, in congruence with the ongoing reach kinematics at that phase of movement. Alternatively, IntA activation near endpoint could be functionally resisting limb deceleration, counterbalancing decelerative commands generated elsewhere. Previous causal experiments that recapitulate the dysmetric phenotype seen in cerebellar patients, including lesion or inactivation of the IntA (Cooper et al., 2000Cooper S.E. Martin J.H. Ghez C.

Because those manipulations lasted orders of magnitude longer than a single reaching movement, IntA’s precise temporal contribution throughout reach behavior has remained obscure. To circumvent these limitations, we designed a kinematic closed-loop system to drive optogenetic manipulations tied directly to reaching movements. By tracking and analyzing the 3D trajectories of mouse reaching movements in real time, our system facilitates brief optogenetic stimulation of IntA at specific, experimenter-defined kinematic landmarks (Figure 2A). As the total closed-loop latency (9.5 ms) is ∼30-fold shorter than the duration of trained reaches (309 ± 40 ms, outreach only; Figure S3), we were able to manipulate IntA activity at specific phases of the reaching movement. We introduced ChR2 into IntA either by injecting trained animals with AAV-hSyn-hChR2-mCh (N = 6) or by crossing Ntsr1-Cre mice with FLEX-ChR2 transgenic mice, which limited expression to cerebellar premotor output neurons (N = 3; Houck and Person, 2015Houck B.D. Person A.L. Cerebellar premotor output neurons collateralize to innervate the cerebellar cortex.J. Comp. Neurol. 2015; 523: 2254-2271Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). An optical fiber was then implanted in IntA ipsilateral to the arm used for reaching (Figure S4). When mice reached for the pellet, we delivered a 50 ms train of blue light pulses (2 ms, 100 Hz) in closed loop at a kinematic landmark near the position of maximal reach velocity (Figure S3), stimulating on a random 25% of reaches to avoid anticipation. This positional landmark, a vertical plane located near the opening of the behavior box that the animals reach through (see STAR Methods), was consistently applied across all animals tested, unless otherwise noted. Using this method, we found that brief excitation of IntA during outreach resulted in clear and consistent kinematic effects (N = 9 animals, n = 2,897 reaches). Stimulated reaches showed a short-latency reversal in outward trajectory, resulting in reaches with premature endpoints (Figure 2C; latency from Stim.: mean 82 ± 10 ms; Videos S2, S3, and S4). Although some reaches were truncated in the outward direction after stimulation, a majority (75% ± 9% of stimulated reaches) continued toward the target after the initial direction reversal, arguing against non-specific behavioral disengagement (“continued reaches,” Figure 2C; latency from Stim.: mean 211 ± 33 ms; N = 4; Video S3). Across all animals and across days, stimulation consistently resulted in shorter reaches in the outward and upward direction, with no significant effect on endpoint variability (Figures 2D and 2E; Figure S5E; Video S4; p = 0.0039, Wilcoxon rank-sum test). Even allowing for continued reaches, success rates were significantly impaired by IntA excitation (stimulated [Stim.] − unstimulated [Unstim.], −6.5% ± 2.2%; p = 0.020, paired t test). These effects were not a consequence of light distracting the mouse, as identical experiments in animals not expressing ChR2 had no effect on reach kinematics (N = 4; Figures S5F–S5H). eyJraWQiOiI4ZjUxYWNhY2IzYjhiNjNlNzFlYmIzYWFmYTU5NmZmYyIsImFsZyI6IlJTMjU2In0.eyJzdWIiOiJlNTJmYWQyMzZmZjNkMjE4OGNkNjNjYWI2NTZmMTQ2ZCIsImtpZCI6IjhmNTFhY2FjYjNiOGI2M2U3MWViYjNhYWZhNTk2ZmZjIiwiZXhwIjoxNjc3NzQyOTA4fQ.stZnyqk6hTX3PJyOsPH863sjZsOC8QOXYuzgB5uYmf7_iaEPdEOHqBzpKHfnupq8cg_NiiB6jEgquwNuU9ZSYF1RShEssC87w8iWhIVCoAm0YVrXOJLyUpuz01MNy7cd8tN_aruXplIVTpp73NWCeInWKz9GO5njREn2eNePCGT7A-Kq-U2ZAFsb7gRkWYU-wmwwEQVsPF-itMgosjt04MyvMrtwrTfio2m40m8J9aC-oow92mjXtpjZRnOubVRm3ZZf6RgodeWqFod-m2en4yrvE7uM4zaMj3EGWMXjkdyU0TjLWwrzV7PuxUqncUpKz-Ndzwabaj7WtwlMCQIqUw Download .mp4 (1.52 MB) Help with .mp4 files Video S2.

Dendrites shape how synaptic inputs are integrated into behaviorally relevant outputs at the level of individual neurons (London and Häusser, 2005London M. Häusser M. Dendritic computation.Annu. Rev.

The amplification of synaptic inputs by voltage-gated ion channels can produce nonlinear dendritic spikes, which, in turn, trigger or modulate somatic action potential output. Layer 5 (L5) pyramidal neurons possess long apical dendrites with powerful spikes mediated by calcium electrogenesis (Harnett et al., 2013Harnett M.T. Xu N.L. Magee J.C. Williams S.R.

Recordings in anesthetized animals have demonstrated that dendritic calcium electrogenesis occurs in vivo and usually coincides with somatic burst firing (Helmchen et al., 1999Helmchen F. Svoboda K. Denk W. Tank D.W. In vivo dendritic calcium dynamics in deep-layer cortical pyramidal neurons.Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 989-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Calcium imaging has revealed previously that apical dendritic activity can represent behaviorally relevant features in trained animals (Peters et al., 2017Peters A.J. Lee J. Hedrick N.G. O’Neil K.

However, because somatic activity has not been concurrently assayed in awake animals, the relationship between compartments remains unclear. The prevalence of active dendritic integration in layer 5 is also unknown: prior experiments sparsely sampled neurons because of the GCaMP expression approach used and the neural dynamics during task performance. Is dendritic activity infrequent and independent of somatic activity, or is it a widespread and integral aspect of cellular computation? To determine how dendritic processing relates to cortical neuron output, we simultaneously measured dendritic and somatic GCaMP6f signals from L5 neurons in the primary visual cortex (V1) of awake mice. Because there are no existing ground truth calibrations of GCaMP6f signals in L5 somata or in dendrites, we combined multi-site whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology with GCaMP6f imaging in acute mouse brain slices to interpret in vivo results. We first imaged V1 neurons in awake head-fixed mice that were free to run on a cylindrical treadmill. We quasi-simultaneously recorded L5 somata (527.8 ± 9.1 μm deep, n = 12 fields of view in 5 mice) and their distal apical trunk dendrites in layer 2 (167.1 ± 6.2 μm deep, 360.8 ± 6.7 μm from the soma) at 15.46 Hz using an electrically tunable lens coupled to a two-photon microscope (Figures 1A–1C). Dendritic activity was detectable in all soma-dendrite pairs that exhibited somatic transients (Figure 1E; 156 of 157 pairs from 5 mice). This widespread dendritic engagement was associated with synchronous activity patterns between corresponding somata and dendrites (Figures 1C and S1), resulting in dendritic and somatic signals that were strongly correlated (Figure 1D; GCaMP6f signal correlation coefficient, 0.542 ± 0.008; n = 156 from 5 mice). Although corresponding somatic and dendritic GCaMP6f traces were similar, their amplitudes and kinetics were not closely matched (Figure 1C). To determine whether these differences reflect divergent features of dendritic and somatic compartments as opposed to noisy calcium dynamics or optical measurements, we analyzed soma-dendrite pairs and pairs of dendrites originating from the same soma that branched below the dendrite imaging plane (GCaMP6f signal correlation coefficient, 0.754 ± 0.033, n = 29 from 5 mice). Dendritic signals consistently had faster rise and decay kinetics than somatic signals (Figures 1H–1J). Thus, corresponding somatic and dendritic GCaMP6f signals are strongly correlated but exhibit compartment-specific differences in their kinetics. To dissect the relationship between somatic and dendritic activity, we isolated transients (Figure 2A; STAR Methods). We found that the majority of transients were paired with a transient in the other compartment (Figure 2B; paired dendritic transient; median [Q1-Q3]: 82.3% [69.1% 92.4%]; paired somatic transient; median [Q1-Q3]: 84.8% [65.8% 93.3%]; n = 156 from 5 mice). Furthermore, paired transients were much larger for both somata (somatic transient integral; paired, median [Q1-Q3]: 6.64 [3.69 13.32] ΔF/F∗s; unpaired median [Q1-Q3]: 1.13 [0.72 1.79] ΔF/F∗s; ∗∗∗p < 10−23, Wilcoxon paired test, n = 136 from 5 mice) and dendrites (dendritic transient integral; paired, median [Q1-Q3] 3.24 [2.42 5.06] ΔF/F∗s; unpaired median [Q1-Q3]: 0.58 [0.43 0.77] ΔF/F∗s; ∗∗∗p < 10−25, Wilcoxon paired test, n = 150 from 5 mice). To estimate how much of the activity is coupled while accounting for the different magnitudes of the paired and unpaired transients, we computed a coupling index (Figure 2D), which reflects the time integral of paired transients over the time integral of all transients. This analysis revealed that ∼97% of the activity is coupled (dendrite coupling index: median [Q1-Q3]: 0.965 [0.916 0.987]; soma coupling index: median [Q1-Q3]: 0.972 [0.897 0.992], n = 156 from 5 mice). GCaMP6f transients lasted up to minutes because of the temporal summation of multiple calcium signals. To assess coupling on a finer timescale, we separated rise and decay segments in the transients based on the first-order derivative of the GCaMP6f signal. We isolated rise events that correspond to segments with positive derivatives that likely reflect calcium entry and underlying electrical activity (Peters et al., 2017Peters A.J. Lee J. Hedrick N.G. O’Neil K. Komiyama T. Reorganization of corticospinal output during motor learning.Nat. Neurosci. 2017; 20: 1133-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar; Figure 2E; STAR Methods). Similar to the transients, most rise events were paired with a rise event in the other compartment (Figure 2F; paired dendritic rise event; median [Q1-Q3]: 83.9% [71.1% 91.1%]; paired somatic rise event; median [Q1-Q3]: 73.4% [56.8% 85.9%], n = 156 from 5 mice). Furthermore, the amplitude of rise events (maximum – minimum ΔF/F within an event) was correlated between the two compartments (Figures 2G and 2H; rise event amplitude correlation coefficient: median [Q1-Q3]: 0.554 [0.473 0.645], n = 156 from 5 mice). This strong somato-dendritic coupling resulted in similar tuning between the two compartments (Figure S1). These analyses reveal that most GCaMP6f events occur concurrently in corresponding dendritic and somatic compartments. To determine the physiological events that underlie the correlated somato-dendritic GCaMP6f transients we observed in vivo, we performed whole-cell recordings from GCaMP6f-expressing L5 neurons in acute brain slices from mouse V1 (Figure 3A). Dendritic whole-cell recordings (348.0 ± 12.8 μm from the soma, n = 10 dendrites from 7 mice) revealed a nonlinear relationship between voltage and GCaMP6f fluorescence (Figures 3B–3D). Subthreshold depolarization produced negligible signals, whereas suprathreshold dendritic electrogenesis produced significant GCaMP6f signals (Figures 3B–3D). The amplitude of the GCaMP6f transients reflected the duration of the suprathreshold dendritic spike (Figure S2). Importantly, dendritic spikes of all durations produced significant ΔF/F changes (Figure S2). Backpropagating action potentials (bAPs) can evoke calcium influx into dendrites (Grienberger and Konnerth, 2012Grienberger C. Konnerth A.

Indeed, a critical frequency of bAPs (∼100 Hz) has been shown to trigger dendritic electrogenesis (Larkum et al., 1999Larkum M.E. Kaiser K.M. Sakmann B.

We therefore investigated whether somatically evoked APs could elicit widespread somato-dendritic GCaMP6f signals. We performed dual whole-cell recordings (Figure 3F) and found that high-frequency bAPs (200 Hz), but not low-frequency bAPs (50 Hz), engaged dendritic electrogenesis to produce dendritic GCaMP6f signals (Figure 3E). Somatic GCaMP6f signals also displayed a strong frequency dependence (Figures 3E and 3H; n = 21 cells from 9 mice) so that APs produced similar signals in the soma and dendrite (Figure 3I). Unlike L2/3 somata (Chen et al., 2013Chen T.W. Wardill T.J. Sun Y. Pulver S.R. Renninger S.L. Baohan A. Schreiter E.R. Kerr R.A. Orger M.B. Jayaraman V. et al.Ultrasensitive fluorescent proteins for imaging neuronal activity.Nature. 2013; 499: 295-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (3617) Google Scholar), L5 somata exhibited negligible signals for low-frequency or single APs (Figures S3). Thus, low-frequency bAPs do not underlie dendritic GCaMP6f signals, but high-frequency bursts can trigger dendritic electrogenesis to produce dendritic GCaMP6f signals. Conversely, directly triggering dendritic electrogenesis produced widespread signals by eliciting high-frequency somatic APs (Figures 3G and 3J). Our ex vivo calibration experiments demonstrate that dendritic GCaMP6f signals reflect active dendritic engagement in the form of calcium electrogenesis. Somato-dendritic recordings in slices predict that both somatic and dendritic inputs can produce correlated GCaMP6f signals (Figures 3I and 3J). However, circuit influences, including inhibition and neuromodulation, could potentially disrupt this relationship in vivo. To determine whether somato-dendritic coordination is affected by state-dependent modulation of cortical circuit activity (Brombas et al., 2014Brombas A. Fletcher L.N. Williams S.R.

We presented long natural movies as opposed to short repetitive stimuli to broadly activate neurons while limiting stimulus-driven correlations. Movie presentation significantly increased both dendritic and somatic activity (Figures 4A–4C) compared with a dark screen but did not alter somato-dendritic correlations (Figure 4D). We next analyzed periods in which animals were running versus when they were stationary (Figure 4E). Despite an increase in activity (Figures 4F and 4G), we observed no motion-driven changes in correlation coefficients (Figure 4H). The percentage of paired rise events and the slope of the relationship between paired events across compartments were also not affected by visual inputs and locomotion (Figure S4). Taken together, these results demonstrate that visual inputs and locomotion do not alter strong somato-dendritic GCaMP6f coupling despite pronounced activity level changes. By simultaneously imaging GCaMP6f in L5 distal apical dendrites and somata in awake animals, we reveal an unexpectedly broad engagement of active dendritic processing across the population of V1 L5 neurons as well as strong coupling between dendritic and somatic activity. Our ex vivo calibration experiments demonstrate that dendritic GCaMP6f signals specifically reflect dendritic electrogenesis. These dendritic spikes can trigger or be triggered by high-frequency action potentials, altering the pattern of axo-somatic output (Beaulieu-Laroche et al., 2018Beaulieu-Laroche L.

We show here that the coordination of suprathreshold activity is constant in the face of visual stimuli, locomotion, and activity level changes, at least within the limits of GCaMP6f imaging. However, flexible somato-dendritic communication may occur on a shorter timescale or may not act along simple human-interpretable categories (e.g., running versus not running). We conclude that active dendritic integration is a widespread and integral feature of information processing in L5 pyramidal neurons.

We discovered that culture of HSCs in low calcium increased their maintenance as determined by phenotype, function, and single-cell expression signature. HSCs are endowed with low intracellular calcium conveyed by elevated activity of glycolysis-fueled plasma membrane calcium efflux pumps and a low-bone-marrow interstitial fluid calcium concentration. Low-calcium conditions inhibited calpain proteases, which target ten-eleven translocated (TET) enzymes, of which TET2 was required for the effect of low calcium conditions on HSC maintenance in vitro. These observations reveal a physiological feature of HSCs that can be harnessed to improve their maintenance in vitro."

The purposes of this study were to assess the scores of the Barthel Index (BI) and Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) scale in older adults with cognitive impairment and to explore the different effects that levels of cognitive functions have on changes in IADL functions. We recruited 31 participants with dementia, 36 with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 35 normal controls (NCs) from the neurology outpatient department of a regional hospital. The results of the demographic and clinical characteristics through the Lawton IADL scale, BI, Quick Mild Cognitive Impairment (Qmci) screen, Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), were collected on the same day and compared with the Kruskal-Wallis test, Wilcoxon rank-sum test, Fisher's exact test, and a multiple linear regression analysis, as appropriate. In the BI, bathing was the most discriminating activity to differentiate patients with MCI and dementia; in the Lawton IADL scale, medication responsibility and shopping were the most discriminating activities to differentiate NCs and patients with MCI, and patients with MCI and dementia, respectively. In addition, the predictors of changes in Lawton IADL scale scores were the problem-solving score of the Clinical Dementia Rating scale, a Qmci score of > 20.4 and an age of ≤ 81.2 years, a MoCA score of < 9.4 and an age of > 81.2 years, and the MMSE score and an age of > 81.2 years. This study adds to the evidence that the description of basic and instrumental daily activities is integrated in older adults with cognitive impairment. Notably, the Qmci is the most significant predictor of changes in IADL function for ""young"" older adults, as are the MoCA and MMSE for ""old"" older adults."
https://openalex.org/W2950774022,"A crucial step in understanding the sleep-control mechanism is to identify sleep neurons. Through systematic anatomical screening followed by functional testing, we identified two sleep-promoting neuronal populations along a thalamo-amygdala pathway, both expressing neurotensin (NTS). Rabies-mediated monosynaptic retrograde tracing identified the central nucleus of amygdala (CeA) as a major source of GABAergic inputs to multiple wake-promoting populations; gene profiling revealed NTS as a prominent marker for these CeA neurons. Optogenetic activation and inactivation of NTS-expressing CeA neurons promoted and suppressed non-REM (NREM) sleep, respectively, and optrode recording showed they are sleep active. Further tracing showed that CeA GABAergic NTS neurons are innervated by glutamatergic NTS neurons in a posterior thalamic region, which also promote NREM sleep. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated NTS knockdown in either the thalamic or CeA neurons greatly reduced their sleep-promoting effect. These results reveal a novel thalamo-amygdala circuit for sleep generation in which NTS signaling is essential for both the upstream glutamatergic and downstream GABAergic neurons."

The transformations may depend on the nanomaterials' own physicochemical properties as well as the environment they are exposed to. This study focuses on the mechanisms of transformation of cerium oxide nanoparticles (CeO2 NPs) in laboratory experiments which simulate potential scenarios in which the NPs are exposed to phosphate-bearing media. We have experimented with the transformation of four different kinds of CeO2 NPs, in order to investigate the effects of nanoparticle size, capping agent (three were uncapped and one was PVP capped) and oxidation state (two consisted mostly of Ce4+ and two were a mix of Ce3+/Ce4+). They were exposed to a reaction solution containing KH2PO4, citric acid and ascorbic acid at pH values of 2.3, 5.5 and 12.3, and concentrations of 1mM and 5mM. The transformations were followed by UV-vis, zeta potential and XRD measurements, which were taken after 7 and 21 days, and by transmission electron microscopy after 21 days. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy was measured at 5mM concentration after 21 days for some samples. Results show that for pH 5 and 5mM phosphate concentration, CePO4 NPs were formed. Nanoparticles that were mostly Ce4+ did not dissolve at 1mM reagent concentration, and did not produce CePO4 NPs. When PVP was present as a capping agent it proved to be an extra reducing agent, and CePO4 was found under all conditions used. This is the first paper where the transformation of CeO2 NPs in the presence of phosphate has been studied for particles with different size, shapes and capping agents, in a range of different conditions and using many different characterisation methods."
https://openalex.org/W2949527657,"Recently, Zika virus (ZIKV) has generated extraordinary concern because of its severe neurotoxicity. Disturbingly, there is no vaccine or specific drug to prevent or treat the diseases caused by ZIKV infection. Thus, it is extremely urgent to characterize the pathogenesis of ZIKV. It has been documented that ZIKV can evade antiviral responses of host cells. Here, we demonstrate that ZIKV strain SZ-WIV01 down-regulates the production of type I IFN and IFN-stimulated genes along with the expression of mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) and mediator of IFN regulatory factor 3 activation (MITA). In the mechanism, ZIKV nonstructural (NS) 3 and NS2B3 negatively regulate IFN-related retinoic acid-inducible gene I-like receptor signaling pathway by targeting MAVS and MITA, respectively. Overexpression of ZIKV NS3 and NS2B3 dramatically inhibits expression of IFN-β. ZIKV NS3 interacts with MAVS, and NS2B3 interacts with MITA, which catalyzes K48-linked polyubiquitination of MAVS and MITA for degradation. Further investigations suggest that ZIKV NS2B3 impairs polyinosinicpolycytidylic acid-triggered K63-linked polyubiquitination of MITA, thereby subverting the activation of downstream sensors. Our study reveals an undiscovered mechanism for ZIKV to escape the innate immune response, providing new insights into clinical study of vaccines or effective drugs.—Li, W., Li, N., Dai, S., Hou, G., Guo, K., Chen, X., Yi, C., Liu, W., Deng, F., Wu, Y., Cao, X.

https://openalex.org/W2948240260,"Background Pregnant and post-partum adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) living with HIV in sub-Saharan Africa experience inferior outcomes along the prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV (PMTCT) cascade compared to their adult counterparts. Yet, despite this inequality in outcomes, scarce data from the region describe AGYW perspectives to inform adolescent-sensitive PMTCT programming. In this paper, we report findings from formative implementation research examining barriers to, and facilitators of, PMTCT care for HIV-infected AGYW in Malawi, and explore strategies for adapting the mothers2mothers (m2m) Mentor Mother Model to better meet AGYW service delivery-related needs and preferences. Methods Qualitative researchers conducted 16 focus group discussions (FGDs) in 4 Malawi districts with HIV-infected adolescent mothers ages 15–19 years categorized into two groups: 1) those who had experience with m2m programming (8 FGDs, n = 38); and 2) those who did not (8 FGDs, n = 34). FGD data were analyzed using thematic analysis to assess major and minor themes and to compare findings between groups. Results Median participant age was 17 years (interquartile range: 2 years). Poverty, stigma, food insecurity, lack of transport, and absence of psychosocial support were crosscutting barriers to PMTCT engagement. While most participants highlighted resilience and self-efficacy as motivating factors to remain in care to protect their own health and that of their children, they also indicated a desire for tailored, age-appropriate services. FGD participants indicated preference for support services delivered by adolescent HIV-infected mentor mothers who have successfully navigated the PMTCT cascade themselves. Conclusions HIV-infected adolescent mothers expressed a preference for peer-led, non-judgmental PMTCT support services that bridge communities and facilities to pragmatically address barriers of stigma, poverty, health system complexity, and food insecurity. Future research should evaluate implementation and health outcomes for adolescent mentor mother services featuring these and other client-centered attributes, such as provision of livelihood assistance and peer-led psychosocial support."
https://openalex.org/W2965391133,"Dysfunction of tight junctions is a critical step during the initial stage of tumor progression. Trophoblast cell surface antigen 2 (Trop-2) belongs to the family of tumor-associated calcium signal transducer (TACSTD) and is required for the stability of claudin-7 and claudin-1, which are often dysregulated or lost in carcinogenesis. Here, we investigated the effects of Trop-2 phosphorylation on cell motility. Analyses using HCT116 cells expressing WT Trop-2 (HCT116/WT) or Trop-2 alanine-substituted at Ser-303 (HCT116/S303A) or Ser-322 (HCT116/S322A) revealed that Trop-2 is phosphorylated at Ser-322. Furthermore, coimmunoprecipitation and Transwell assays indicated that Trop-2 S322A interacted with claudin-7 the strongest, and a phosphomimetic variant, Trop-2 S322E, the weakest and that HCT116/S322E cells have the highest motility and HCT116/S322A cells the lowest. All cell lines had similar levels of claudin-7 mRNA, but levels of claudin-7 protein were markedly decreased in the HCT116/S322E cells, suggesting posttranscriptional control of claudin-7. Moreover, claudin-7 was clearly localized to cell–cell borders in HCT116/S322A cells but was diffusely distributed on the membrane and partially localized in the cytoplasm of HCT116/S322E and HCT116/WT cells. These observations suggested that Trop-2 phosphorylation plays a role in the decrease or mislocalization of claudin-7. Using protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors and PKC-specific siRNAs, we found that PKCα and PKCδ are responsible for Trop-2 phosphorylation. Of note, chemical PKC inhibition and PKCα- and PKCδ-specific siRNAs reduced motility. In summary, our findings provide evidence that Trop-2 is phosphorylated at Ser-322 by PKCα/δ and that this phosphorylation enhances cell motility and decreases claudin-7 localization to cellular borders."
https://openalex.org/W2948070094,"Background Sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 3 (S1P3) is one of five receptors for sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P). S1P/S1P3 signaling is involved in numerous physiological and pathological processes including bone metabolism, sepsis, cancer, and immunity. In rheumatoid arthritis (RA), fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs) are activated by several factors and promote abundant proinflammatory cytokine production and bone destruction. The aim of this study was to investigate whether S1P3 is associated with the development of autoimmune arthritis and the pathogenic function of FLSs. Methods Wild-type (WT) and S1P3 knockout (S1P3-KO) collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mice were evaluated with respect to clinical and histological disease severity, along with the levels of anti-collagen antibodies and expression of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) and interleukin-6 (IL-6). S1P3 expression in the synovium was analyzed by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunofluorescence staining. FLSs isolated from CIA mice were activated with TNFα and S1P3 expression was analyzed by real-time RT-PCR. The role of S1P/S1P3 signaling in activated and non-activated FLSs was investigated by measuring cell proliferation and cyto/chemokine production by real-time RT-PCR and/or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results Clinical and histological scores, and synovial IL-6 expression were significantly lower in S1P3-KO mice with CIA than in WT mice. Arthritic synovia had higher S1P3 expression than intact synovia and FLSs in arthritic joints expressed S1P3 in vivo. Primary cultured FLSs produced IL-6 in a time-dependent manner in response to S1P stimulation and exhibited higher levels of S1P3 expression after activation with TNFα. S1P3-induced production of IL-6 and MMP-3 was increased in FLSs pre-activated with TNFα. Conclusion In this study, we demonstrated that S1P3 expression is associated with the development of autoimmune arthritis via inflammation-induced increases in S1P/S1P3 signaling that increase production of IL-6 in FLSs. Inhibition of S1P/S1P3 signaling could open the door to the development of new therapies for RA."

https://openalex.org/W2948564214,"Several studies have shown differences in the abilities of maize genotypes to facilitate or impede Azospirillum brasilense colonization and to receive benefits from this association. Hence, our aim was to study the genetic control, heterosis effect and the prediction accuracy of the shoot and root traits of maize in response to A. brasilense. For that, we evaluated 118 hybrids under two contrasting scenarios: i) N stress (control) and ii) N stress plus A. brasilense inoculation. The diallel analyses were performed using mixed model equations, and the genomic prediction models accounted for the general and specific combining ability (GCA and SCA, respectively) and the presence or not of G×E effects. In addition, the genomic models were fitted considering parametric (G-BLUP) and semi-parametric (RKHS) kernels. The genotypes showed significant inoculation effect for five root traits, and the GCA and SCA were significant for both. The GCA in the inoculated treatment presented a greater magnitude than the control, whereas the opposite was observed for SCA. Heterosis was weakly influenced by the inoculation, and the heterozygosity and N status in the plant can have a role in the benefits that can be obtained from this Plant Growth-Promoting Bacteria (PGPB). Prediction accuracies for N stress plus A. brasilense ranged from 0.42 to 0.78, depending on the scenario and trait, and were higher, in most cases, than the non-inoculated treatment. Finally, our findings provide an understanding of the quantitative variation of maize responsiveness to A. brasilense and important insights to be applied in maize breeding aiming the development of superior hybrids for this association."
https://openalex.org/W2948739416,"Measuring quality of care in family planning services is essential for policymakers and stakeholders. However, there is limited agreement on which mathematical approaches are best able to summarize quality of care. Our study used data from recent Service Provision Assessment surveys in Haiti, Malawi, and Tanzania to compare three methods commonly used to create summary indices of quality of care—a simple additive, a weighted additive that applies equal weights among domains, and principal components analysis (PCA) based methods. The PCA results indicated that the first component cannot sufficiently summarize quality of care. For each scoring method, we categorized family planning facilities into low, medium, and high quality and assessed the agreement with Cohen’s kappa coefficient between pairs of scores. We found that the agreement was generally highest between the simple additive and PCA rankings. Given the limitations of simple additive measures, and the findings of the PCA, we suggest using a weighted additive method."

In the absence of oxygen, complex II of this alternative ETC functions in the opposite direction to the conventional ETC. To facilitate this reversal, fumarate is used as the final electron acceptor, and rhodoquinone (RQ) functions as the electron transporter. RQ differs from ubiquinone (Q), the electron transporter in the conventional ETC, by one substituent on the benzoquinone ring: RQ has a 2-amino substituent, whereas Q has a methoxy group in this position (Fig. 1A). RQ has a lower redox potential than Q (−63 mV versus 110 mV, respectively) (5Erabi T. Higuti T. Kakuno T. Yamashita J. Tanaka M. Horio T.

In contrast to other fermentative pathways, the alternative ETC allows proton pumping and ATP synthesis through complex V, leading to higher efficiency in harvesting energy.

The biosynthetic pathway of RQ has been extensively studied in Rhodospirillum rubrum. In this organism, RQ biosynthesis requires Q as a precursor (8Brajcich B.C. Iarocci A.L. Johnstone L.A.

Subsequently, it was discovered that the R. rubrum rquA gene is essential for RQ but not for Q biosynthesis (9Lonjers Z.T. Dickson E.L. Chu T.P. Kreutz J.E. Neacsu F.A. Anders K.R. Shepherd J.N.

Despite a comprehensive study of R. rubrum knockout mutants, using aerobic versus anaerobic transcriptome data and comparative genomic analysis, no other genes besides rquA were identified to be essential for RQ biosynthesis (10Campbell A.R.M.

In parallel, it was shown that unicellular eukaryotes also possess a homolog of the rquA gene, most likely acquired by horizontal gene transfer (11Stairs C.W. Eme L. Muñoz-Gómez S.A. Cohen A.

These studies indicate that rquA is the gene signature for RQ biosynthesis in bacteria and protists. More recently, the heterologous expression of R. rubrum rquA in two non-RQ–producing species, Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, resulted in the in vivo conversion of native Q to synthetic RQ (12Bernert A.C.

Despite these advances, the biosynthesis of RQ in animals has not been elucidated, and the key genes involved have remained elusive. RQ has been found in all helminths where it has been examined (7Van Hellemond J.J. Klockiewicz M. Gaasenbeek C.P. Roos M.H. Tielens A.G.

Importantly, RQ is also synthesized by the free-living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (14Takamiya S. Matsui T. Taka H. Murayama K. Matsuda M. Aoki T. Free-living nematodes Caenorhabditis elegans possess in their mitochondria an additional rhodoquinone, an essential component of the eukaryotic fumarate reductase system.Arch. Biochem.

Studies in C. elegans have shown that Q is not a required precursor of RQ. Indeed, a KO strain in coq-7 (also known as clk-1) abolishes Q biosynthesis without affecting RQ biosynthesis (15Jonassen T. Larsen P.L. Clarke C.F. A dietary source of coenzyme Q is essential for growth of long-lived Caenorhabditis elegans clk-1 mutants.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Although helminths are not easily approachable, C. elegans is a formidable experimental organism (17Corsi A.K. Wightman B. Chalfie M. A transparent window into biology: a primer on Caenorhabditis elegans.Genetics. 2015; 200 (26088431): 378-40710.1534/genetics.115.176099Crossref Scopus (264) Google Scholar) and has been used as a model for parasitic nematodes (18Bürglin T.R. Lobos E. Blaxter M.L. Caenorhabditis elegans as a model for parasitic nematodes.Int. J. Parasitol. 1998; 28 (9559358): 395-41110.1016/S0020-7519(97)00208-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In this study, we elucidate key steps in the RQ biosynthesis pathway using C. elegans. We demonstrate that the kynureninase KYNU-1 is essential for RQ biosynthesis, and based on RNAi experiments, we propose that RQ and Q have parallel pathways starting from different precursors. Because RQ is not synthesized or used by mammalian hosts, but is required for parasite survival, the RQ biosynthetic pathway is a unique target for antihelminthic drug design. Because of the differences in RQ biosynthesis in R. rubrum and C. elegans, we reasoned that, in the case of animals, the amino group at position 2 of the benzoquinone ring (Fig. 1A) may be added at the beginning of RQ biosynthesis, rather than at the end. Because kynu-1 encodes a kynureninase that catalyzes the synthesis of two arylamines, anthranilic acid (AA) and 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid (3HAA), from l-kynurenine (KYN) and 3-hydroxy-l-kynurenine (3HKYN), respectively (Fig. 2A), we examined RQ biosynthesis in a kynu-1 KO strain. No trace of RQ was observed in the KO animals (Fig. 2B). In contrast, Q levels were not reduced in the KO. RNAi-mediated knockdown of kynu-1 in the C. elegans strain rrf-3(pk1426), which is hypersensitive to RNAi (19Simmer F. Tijsterman M. Parrish S. Koushika S.P. Nonet M.L. Fire A. Ahringer J. Plasterk R.H. Loss of the putative RNA-directed RNA polymerase RRF-3 makes C. elegans hypersensitive to RNAi.Curr. Biol. 2002; 12 (12176360): 1317-131910.1016/S0960-9822(02)01041-2Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar), exhibited a significant decrease in RQ levels (p < 0.001), with no decrease in Q, as compared with the empty vector (EV) control (Fig. 2B). The expression of the WT kynu-1 allele in the kynu-1 strain under the control of its own promoter rescued RQ biosynthesis (Fig. 2B). These results allow us to conclusively demonstrate that kynu-1 is essential for RQ biosynthesis and strongly suggest that AA or 3HAA is a key precursor for RQ biosynthesis. Intriguingly, supplementation experiments with AA or 3HAA did not restore RQ biosynthesis in the kynu-1 strain (Fig. 2B). These results indicate that RQ is synthesized de novo in C. elegans. Because KYN can be converted to 3HKYN by kynurenine 3-monooxygenase, KMO-1, we analyzed a kmo-1 mutant strain to discriminate whether AA or 3HAA is the RQ precursor. The kmo-1 strain had significantly reduced RQ levels compared with N2 (p < 0.001), but RQ biosynthesis was not completely abolished (Fig. 2C). The result is consistent with the fact that a hydroxyl substituent can be introduced at position 3 of the aromatic ring by kmo-1–dependent and kmo-1–independent routes (20Coburn C. Gems D. The mysterious case of the C. elegans gut granule: death fluorescence, anthranilic acid and the kynurenine pathway.Front. Genet. 2013; 4 (23967012): 15110.3389/fgene.2013.00151Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 21van der Goot A.T. Zhu W. Vázquez-Manrique R.P. Seinstra R.I. Dettmer K. Michels H. Farina F.

Because KYNU-1 is required for the biosynthesis of both metabolites, this would explain the absolute requirement of this gene. Because both kynu-1 and kmo-1 belong to the kynurenine pathway (Fig. 2A), we analyzed a KO mutant in afmd-1, the gene that precedes kynu-1 in the pathway. afmd-1 encodes the kynurenine formamidase that converts l-formyl kynurenine to KYN. Surprisingly, the afmd-1 strain only reduced RQ levels to about half that of N2 (p < 0.001). We also analyzed a mutant strain in haao-1, which encodes a 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid oxygenase (HAAO-1) downstream of KYNU-1 in the pathway (Fig. 2A). This strain did not affect RQ biosynthesis (Fig. 2C). Thus, 2-amino-3-carboxymuconic semialdehyde is unlikely to be a precursor for RQ biosynthesis. Instead, RQ biosynthesis most likely branches from the AA or 3HAA precursors in the kynurenine pathway. To assess the expression pattern of kynu-1 during the C. elegans life cycle, we generated and analyzed a translational reporter strain expressing GFP under the control of the kynu-1 promoter (IH25 strain). We detected expression of kynu-1 in the embryo early in the E lineage and epidermis. This pattern was maintained in the L1 stage, but starting at L2 through adulthood expression was only seen in the epidermis (Fig. 3 and Fig. S1). Because RQ is supposed to play a key role as part of an alternative ETC under hypoxia, we analyzed whether expression of kynu-1 was affected after exposure to 0.4% oxygen during 24 h in adult worms. We did not observe any obvious increase in GFP fluorescence nor a difference in the spatial expression of the reporter. This suggests that kynu-1 expression is not regulated under hypoxic conditions. In the case of S. cerevisiae, Q can be synthesized from 4-hydroxybenzoic acid (4HB) or 4-aminobenzoic acid (pABA) in parallel pathways using common enzymes in most steps (Fig. 4A) (22Marbois B. Xie L.X. Choi S. Hirano K. Hyman K. Clarke C.F. para-Aminobenzoic acid is a precursor in coenzyme Q6 biosynthesis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.J. Biol.

Thus, we reasoned that some of the enzymes may also be involved in RQ biosynthesis. We performed RNAi knockdown assays of coq-3, coq-5, coq-6, and coq-7 genes. We found that coq-5 and coq-6 RNAi significantly decreased both Q and RQ levels compared with controls (p < 0.001), whereas coq-3 had a smaller effect on both (Fig. 4B and Table S1). As expected, coq-7 RNAi significantly decreased Q levels (p = 0.010) but not RQ. The mRNA levels for the silenced genes indicated efficient interference in all but the coq-3 RNAi samples (Fig. S2). These results clearly indicate that COQ-5 and COQ-6 are involved in both Q and RQ biosynthesis. Our results support the existence of parallel pathways that use several common enzymes to synthesize Q and RQ from different precursors. The biosynthesis of RQ in animals has remained a puzzle for decades (24Kawamukai M. Biosynthesis and applications of prenylquinones.Biosci. Biotechnol.

In bacteria and protists, RQ is derived from Q, and rquA is the gene signature for its biosynthesis (9Lonjers Z.T. Dickson E.L. Chu T.P. Kreutz J.E. Neacsu F.A. Anders K.R. Shepherd J.N.

In contrast, in animals, RQ is not derived from Q, and no RQ-specific gene has been discovered. By analogy to the biosynthetic pathway of Q in yeast from pABA (22Marbois B. Xie L.X. Choi S. Hirano K. Hyman K. Clarke C.F. para-Aminobenzoic acid is a precursor in coenzyme Q6 biosynthesis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.J. Biol.

Dolan K. Tan K.H. Spensley A. Caudy A.A. Fraser A.G. Identification of the pathway of rhodoquinone biosynthesis in C. elegans.bioRxiv. 2019; 10.1101/627737Google Scholar). Our study was performed with the kynu-1 strain Tm4924. The genetic rescue of Tm4924 and RNAi experiments that we performed confirmed this finding. These results indicate that AA and/or 3HAA are RQ precursors. Consistent with this view, the strain used in this study has been previously reported to show increased levels of KYN and 3HKYN (21van der Goot A.T. Zhu W. Vázquez-Manrique R.P. Seinstra R.I. Dettmer K. Michels H. Farina F. Krijnen J. Melki R. Buijsman R.C. Ruiz Silva M. Thijssen K.L. Kema I.P. Neri C. Oefner P.J. Nollen E.A. Delaying aging and the aging-associated decline in protein homeostasis by inhibition of tryptophan degradation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Interestingly, supplementation with AA or 3HAA did not rescue RQ biosynthesis, suggesting the absence of transporters for uptake of these metabolites. The kmo-1 strain showed significantly reduced levels of RQ. Thus, whether AA or 3HAA or both are precursors of RQ is unclear. The kynu-1–dependent, kmo-1–independent biosynthesis of 3HAA has been postulated in several studies (20Coburn C. Gems D. The mysterious case of the C. elegans gut granule: death fluorescence, anthranilic acid and the kynurenine pathway.Front. Genet. 2013; 4 (23967012): 15110.3389/fgene.2013.00151Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 21van der Goot A.T. Zhu W. Vázquez-Manrique R.P. Seinstra R.I. Dettmer K. Michels H. Farina F. Krijnen J. Melki R. Buijsman R.C. Ruiz Silva M. Thijssen K.L. Kema I.P. Neri C. Oefner P.J. Nollen E.A. Delaying aging and the aging-associated decline in protein homeostasis by inhibition of tryptophan degradation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

In any case, the drastic decrease of RQ biosynthesis in the kmo-1 strain would suggest that 3HAA is an RQ precursor. The mutant strain in afmd-1, upstream of kynu-1, did not completely abolish RQ biosynthesis. This result would be explained if the afmd-1 strain is not a null-mutant or if KYN can be acquired from E. coli. KYNU-1 expression was mostly restricted to the hypodermis, suggesting that the precursor of RQ is transported to other tissues. Two genes of the kynurenine pathway, tdo-2 and kmo-1, have also been found to be expressed almost exclusively in the worm hypodermis (26Vohra M. Lemieux G.A. Lin L. Ashrafi K. The beneficial effects of dietary restriction on learning are distinct from its effects on longevity and mediated by depletion of a neuroinhibitory metabolite.PLoS Biol. 2017; 15 (28763436): e200203210.1371/journal.pbio.2002032Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). KYN, AA, and 3HAA transport to other worm tissues is likely to be highly relevant because they are also precursors for other key metabolites, such as quinolinic acid and kynurenic acid. Interestingly, enigmatic deposits of fluorescent AA glycosyl esters are found in gut granules in dying worms (20Coburn C. Gems D. The mysterious case of the C. elegans gut granule: death fluorescence, anthranilic acid and the kynurenine pathway.Front. Genet. 2013; 4 (23967012): 15110.3389/fgene.2013.00151Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). We found that the expression of kynu-1 was not up-regulated under hypoxic conditions. KYNU-1 may be constitutively expressed because it is also essential for de novo synthesis of NAD+ (27McReynolds M.R. Wang W. Holleran L.M. Hanna-Rose W. Uridine monophosphate synthetase enables eukaryotic de novo NAD+ biosynthesis from quinolinic acid.J. Biol. Chem. 2017; 292 (28559281): 11147-1115310.1074/jbc.C117.795344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). An important conclusion of our study is that the kynurenine pathway is a complex metabolic hub, and that AA or 3HAA is a likely branch point for RQ biosynthesis. Our study reveals that from the kynurenine pathway branch point, Q and RQ biosynthesis in C. elegans make use of common enzymes, because coq-5 and coq-6 RNAi led to a significant decrease of both quinones. The fact that the enzymes involved in Q biosynthesis do not have strict substrate specificity is highlighted by the parallel pathways of Q biosynthesis in yeast that start from different precursors (23Awad A.M. Bradley M.C. Fernández-Del-Rćo L. Nag A. Tsui H.S. Clarke C.F. Coenzyme Q10 deficiencies: pathways in yeast and humans.Essays Biochem. 2018; 62 (29980630): 361-37610.1042/EBC20170106Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In addition, neo-functionalization of Coq enzymes has been described for the COQ-5 bacterial ortholog (UbiE/MenG) in the biosynthesis of menaquinone (28Lee P.T. Hsu A.Y. Ha H.T. Clarke C.F. A C-methyltransferase involved in both ubiquinone and menaquinone biosynthesis: isolation and identification of the Escherichia coli ubiE gene.J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179 (9045837): 1748-175410.1128/jb.179.5.1748-1754.1997Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). A scheme depicting a possible pathway for RQ biosynthesis in C. elegans is shown in Fig. 5, which utilizes COQ-2, COQ-3, COQ-5, and COQ-6. The order of these proposed steps will need to be determined. Our results highlight the existence of two independent evolutionary pathways for RQ biosynthesis. Interestingly, R. rubrum, and protists that synthesize RQ, lack the kynurenine pathway and use Q and RquA for the biosynthesis of RQ. In contrast, KYNU-1 is present in all helminths and in bivalves, suggesting that the kynurenine pathway has been co-opted for RQ biosynthesis. Our findings have practical applications for the identification of potential targets in the RQ biosynthetic pathway for antihelminthic drug development. Parasitic helminth infections have become a global health epidemic, and in the face of emerging drug resistance, new treatments are necessary to combat them (29Hotez P.J. Brindley P.J. Bethony J.M. King C.H. Pearce E.J. Jacobson J. Helminth infection: the great neglected tropical diseases.J. Clin. Invest. 2008; 118 (18382743): 1311-132110.1172/JCI34261Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar). A key issue regarding future studies is to understand why mammals, and other animals that possess the kynurenine pathway, do not synthesize RQ. The discovery of key enzymatic steps that discriminate between Q and RQ precursors will be highly relevant to target a metabolic pathway that is essential for helminth survival within the mammalian host under hypoxic conditions, such as those found in the intestine. The C. elegans strains used in this study are listed in Table S2. Transgenic lines were obtained according to Ref. 30Mello C.C. Kramer J.M. Stinchcomb D. Ambros V.

The pRF4 plasmid containing the injection marker rol-6(su1006) was co-injected with constructs containing Pkynu-1::kynu-1::gfp cloned into the pPD95.77 plasmid and injected into kynu-1(tm4924) animals. Independent transgenic lines were isolated and observed. The general methods used for culturing and maintenance of C. elegans are described in Ref. 31Brenner S. The genetics of Caenorhabditis elegans.Genetics. 1974; 77 (4366476): 71-94Crossref PubMed Google Scholar. All chemical reagents were purchased from Sigma. Chemical supplementation was carried out adding 10 mm AA or 10 mm 3HAA to NGM agar plates. The expression pattern of kynu-1 was determined using GFP as a reporter. The translational constructs Pkynu-1::kynu-1::gfp included promoter (1.4 kb), exons, and introns of kynu-1 in-frame with the gfp coding sequence. Sequences were amplified by PCR using appropriate primers (Table S3) from N2 genomic DNA. The PCR products were cloned into the pPD95.77 vector that provides the unc-54 3′UTR. For the study of the kynu-1 expression pattern under hypoxic conditions, adult worms of the transgenic lines expressing the construct Pkynu-1::kynu-1::gfp were grown at 0.42% oxygen, 20 °C during 20 h in a C-Chamber incubator with a ProOx 110 oxymeter (Biospherix, Parish, NY). Worms were immediately mounted for visualization under the microscope. Animals were visualized under a confocal microscope Zeiss LSM 880 and images captured with the Zen black 2.3 software and processed with Fiji (32Schindelin J. Arganda-Carreras I. Frise E. Kaynig V.

Embryos were obtained by a transverse cut in a gravid adult (early stages) or picked directly from the plate (late embryonic stages). The expressions of the C. elegans kynu-1, coq-3, coq-5, coq-6, and coq-7 (clk-1) genes were interfered with by E. coli strain HT115 containing the plasmid pL4440 encoding the gene of interest (Table S4). Plasmids without an insert DNA (EV) or encoding unc-22 were used as controls. E. coli strains were grown overnight at 37 °C in LB plus ampicillin (50 μg/ml) and carbenicillin (30 μg/ml), followed by a 2-h outgrowth to obtain a cell density of 0.4–0.6 OD600 units. Each strain was seeded onto 20 NGM agar plates (150 μl per plate) plus ampicillin, carbenicillin, and 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (to induce expression of dsRNA) and incubated for 48 h at 37 °C. RNAi was carried out by plating C. elegans rrf-3(pk1426), which were age-synchronized to the L1 stage, onto the seeded E. coli plates at 22 °C and grown for 7 days. Worms were washed from plates with M9 buffer, divided into aliquots for pelleting, and frozen at −80 °C until use. For lipid extractions of C. elegans N2 or mutant strains, 4,000 synchronized L1s were grown on NGM plates at 20 °C to adulthood. For each experiment, ∼10,000 adult worms were harvested and washed several times with 18 megohm water to obtain pellets for extraction (∼100 mg). Lipid extraction of rrf-3 strains from RNAi assays was also performed using pellets containing ∼100 mg of worms, prepared from feeding plates as described above. Prior to extraction, 1000 pmol of Q3 internal standards was added to pellets, and then lipids were extracted using hexanes and ethanol as described previously (12Bernert A.C. Jacobs E.J. Reinl S.R.

Standards were prepared and extracted at the following concentrations: Q3 (10 pmol/10 μl injection) and RQ9 (0.75, 1.5, 3.0, 4.5, or 6.0 pmol/10 μl injection). The RQ9 standard was isolated from Ascaris suum lipid extracts at Gonzaga University. In the absence of a standard, the quantity of Q9 was determined using a picomole conversion from the RQ9 standard curve and applying a RQ/Q response correction factor of 2.45 determined from RQ10/Q10 and RQ8/Q8 standard curves (12Bernert A.C.

We shine a spotlight on how this work has inspired the development of tools to study and correct genetic diseases in experimental systems, with the ultimate goal of treating human disease. Two historical challenges to studying and repairing genetic mutations have been the lack of relevant in vitro models and the inability to modify genes. Schwank et al., 2013Schwank G. Koo B.-K. Sasselli V. Dekkers J.F. Heo I. Demircan T. Sasaki N. Boymans S.

Organoids are three-dimensional structures derived from somatic stem cells or induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) that reproduce many features of tissue architecture and function. CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing induces double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) breaks at specific genomic loci adjacent to a protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM) using a complementary single-guide RNA sequence (sgRNA) and the Cas9 DNA endonuclease. DNA repair then occurs by either non-homologous end joining (which results in random insertions or deletions) or homology-directed repair (HDR) with a donor template (Fujii et al., 2019Fujii M. Clevers H. Sato T. Modeling Human Digestive Diseases With CRISPR-Cas9-Modified Organoids.Gastroenterology. 2019; 156: 562-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Schwank et al. used CRISPR-Cas9 to introduce dsDNA breaks in the APC tumor suppressor gene in mouse and patient-derived intestinal organoids. They then repaired an inborn genetic disease in patient-derived organoids using HDR. Cystic fibrosis is caused by inactivating mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductor receptor (CFTR), which encodes an anion channel that is essential for electrolyte balance. The researchers cultured intestinal and colon organoids from pediatric cystic fibrosis patients. They then introduced dsDNA breaks around the mutated CFTR locus using two sgRNAs and Cas9, together with a donor template carrying the corrected CFTR sequence and a marker for selecting repaired organoids. The authors reported heterozygous repair of CFTR in a small percentage of organoids, which resulted in restored CFTR function. This report from 2013 is the first instance of successful therapeutic CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing in human tissue. Almost 6 years later, what has been the impact of this research? One implication of this work is that CRISPR-Cas9-edited organoids or animal models can be used to understand mechanisms of genetic diseases for which experimental models previously did not exist or were limited. For example, CRISPR-Cas9 editing of DGAT1 in normal human intestinal organoids resulted in reduced lipid droplet formation and increased cell death in response to oleic acid treatment, similar to intestinal organoids derived from patients with inherited DGAT1 deficiency. CRISPR-Cas9 can also be used to model disease in induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). For example, inactivating mutations were introduced in the causative genes for polycystic kidney disease in iPSCs, which were then differentiated into kidney organoids that reproduced key features of the disease. In addition, multiplex CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing was performed in the murine liver to model argininosuccinic aciduria, a genetic disease that results in hyperammonemia (Driehuis and Clevers, 2017Driehuis E.

Schwank and colleagues were the first group to use CRISPR-Cas9 to edit a cancer-related gene in organoids (Schwank et al., 2013Schwank G. Koo B.-K. Sasselli V. Dekkers J.F. Heo I. Demircan T. Sasaki N. Boymans S.

Based on this work, we and others introduced multiple cancer-associated mutations in colon organoids using CRISPR-Cas9 and then transplanted engineered cancer organoids into the mouse colon to model human colorectal cancer and metastasis. We also directly edited cancer-associated genes in the mouse colonic epithelium to generate colon tumors with defined mutations (O’Rourke et al., 2017O’Rourke K.P. Loizou E. Livshits G. Schatoff E.M. Baslan T. Manchado E. Simon J. Romesser P.B. Leach B. Han T. et al.Transplantation of engineered organoids enables rapid generation of metastatic mouse models of colorectal cancer.Nat.

Biotechnol. 2017; 35: 569-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). CRISPR-Cas9 has also been used to reproduce genetic mutations that are associated with stomach, breast, lung, liver, muscle, and pancreatic cancers in patient-derived organoids, mouse organoids, or autochthonous mouse models (Driehuis and Clevers, 2017Driehuis E. Clevers H. CRISPR/Cas 9 genome editing and its applications in organoids.Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2017; 312: G257-G265Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). These studies demonstrate that CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing can be used to efficiently model cancer to study mechanisms of disease and response to therapy. The paper published by Schwank et al. has inspired investigators to apply CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing tools to repair disease in animal models. CRISPR-Cas9 editing with HDR was applied to prevent diseases such as cataracts and Duchenne muscular dystrophy in mouse zygotes (Savić and Schwank, 2016Savić N. Schwank G. Advances in therapeutic CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing.Transl. Res. 2016; 168: 15-21Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Three research groups used distinct CRISPR-Cas9 strategies in mouse models to restore function of dystrophin, a muscle protein that is deficient in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (Wang et al., 2019Wang D. Tai P.W.L. Gao G. Adeno-associated virus vector as a platform for gene therapy delivery.Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2019; 18: 358-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar). In a recent report, sgRNAs were delivered to the cochlea to induce dsDNA breaks in the mutant allele of a gene causing congenital deafness in mice, which improved hearing (Gao et al., 2018Gao X. Tao Y. Lamas V. Huang M. Yeh W.-H. Pan B. Hu Y.-J. Hu J.H. Thompson D.B. Shu Y. et al.Treatment of autosomal dominant hearing loss by in vivo delivery of genome editing agents.Nature. 2018; 553: 217-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Finally, delivery of Cas9 mRNA with adeno-associated viral particles containing guide RNAs and a repair template to mouse hepatocytes resulted in correction of the genetic mutation that causes hereditary tyrosinemia type I and a growth advantage for edited cells (Savić and Schwank, 2016Savić N. Schwank G. Advances in therapeutic CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing.Transl. Res. 2016; 168: 15-21Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). These experiments show that CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing can be applied to restore function in selected mouse models of human disease. As Schwank and colleagues noted, CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing with HDR is inefficient in slowly proliferating cells and results in undesired insertions or deletions. Recently developed CRISPR-associated base editors can precisely and efficiently correct disease-causing mutations in single-stranded DNA, independent of dsDNA break formation and HDR. The Schwank laboratory used adeno-associated viral particles carrying CRISPR-associated base editors to correct the gene mutation underlying phenylketonuria in hepatocytes and reverse the disease phenotype (Villiger et al., 2018Villiger L. Grisch-Chan H.M. Lindsay H. Ringnalda F. Pogliano C.B. Allegri G. Fingerhut R. Häberle J. Matos J. Robinson M.D. et al.Treatment of a metabolic liver disease by in vivo genome base editing in adult mice.Nat. Med. 2018; 24: 1519-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Another laboratory used base editing technology to repair a genetic mutation in the muscle of a mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Limitations of currently available DNA base editors include a low but detectable rate of insertions or deletions and off-target editing of nearby bases (Rees and Liu, 2018Rees H.A. Liu D.R. Base editing: precision chemistry on the genome and transcriptome of living cells.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2018; 19: 770-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). The work by Schwank and colleagues has led to advances in therapeutic CRISPR-Cas9 editing in cultured human tissues. One study described successful repair of iPSCs from a patient with the genetic blood disorder β-thalassemia using CRISPR-Cas9-based vectors and a DNA template for HDR. The corrected iPSCs were then differentiated into red blood cell precursors with functional hemoglobin, which could theoretically be used for therapeutic transplantation. Two independent studies demonstrated CRISPR-Cas9-based correction of dystrophin mutations in iPSCs and immortalized cell lines derived from patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Finally, researchers disrupted chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5), a coreceptor required for T cell infection by some common strains of HIV, in primary human CD4 T cells and hematopoietic stem cells. Together with the original work by Schwank et al., these studies suggest that CRISPR-Cas9-edited patient-derived cells or organoids could one day be used therapeutically (Savić and Schwank, 2016Savić N. Schwank G. Advances in therapeutic CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing.Transl. Res. 2016; 168: 15-21Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In summary, the breakthrough publication by Schwank et al. demonstrated that CRISPR-Cas9-based gene editing can be used to repair human genetic disease in patient-derived organoids. Researchers have subsequently applied this technology to model and correct a wide range of human diseases in organoids and in animal models. Many challenges remain before gene editing can be applied to treat disease in humans. Direct gene editing in patients is currently limited by difficulties in vector delivery, the relatively low efficiency of HDR, and the risk for undesired insertions/deletions and off-target effects. Editing of patient-derived cells or organoids permits selection, screening, and expansion of clones with the desired mutations. Gene editing in patient-derived organoids can be immediately applied in the clinic to determine whether mutations are pathogenic and to test therapies. Methods for efficient and precise engraftment must be developed before edited organoids can be used to treat disease. In the future, repaired patient-derived cells may be grown in advanced tissue scaffolds for subsequent transplantation.

https://openalex.org/W2948707274,"The aim of this study was to examine the association between health literacy (HL) and sleep problems with mental health of Chinese students in combined junior and senior high school.A cross-sectional study was conducted among seven hundred and seventy-five students from a combined junior and senior high school in Shenyang on December 16, 2016. HL, sleep problems, anxiety symptoms and depressive symptoms were measured by self-reported validated instruments. Multiple logistic regression models were used to examine the association of HL and sleep problems with mental health problems.The prevalence of anxiety symptoms and depressive symptoms was 24.6% and 45.2%, respectively. Low HL was significantly associated with anxiety symptoms (OR = 2.457, 95%CI: 1.493-4.045) and depressive symptoms (OR = 5.164, 95%CI: 3.233-8.250). Sleep problems were significantly positively correlated with anxiety symptoms (OR = 4.237, 95%CI: 2.831-6.341) and depressive symptoms (OR = 3.170, 95%CI: 2.084-4.823). The students who had sleep problems with low HL had the highest risks of anxiety symptoms (OR = 11.440, 95%CI: 5.564-23.520) and depressive symptoms (OR = 19.470, 95%CI: 8.143-46.558).Our findings suggest that Chinese students in combined junior and senior high school who had sleep problems with low HL are at risk of exhibiting anxiety symptoms and depressive symptoms. Intervention programs of mental health problems should enhance HL level and improve sleep quality."
https://openalex.org/W2948754410,"Background Whilst many health benefits are associated with regular exercise, medical complications may occur during higher-intensity activities, such as long distance running contests. The most common complication is collapse. However, the incidence and characteristics of these collapses are not very well studied. Method This is a retrospective study of severe collapse, defined as a patient in need of advanced medical care after a collapse, during the large Gothenburg’s half marathon, Göteborgsvarvet. The study included 230,501 competitors during the study-period of 5 years (2013–2017) with data being collected from medical race tents and using ambulance data. Vital signs, treatment and blood gas samples were noted and analyzed. Results The incidence of severe collapse was 1.53 per 1000 starting runners. The average age for patients was 34 years old and no difference in incidence were seen between male and female runners. The typical collapsed runner presented with tachycardia, normal systolic blood pressure, elevated body temperature and metabolic acidosis. The most common medical encounter was exercise-associated collapse. Conclusion The incidence of severe collapse was similar to findings in other studies, even though this study was set in different part of the world. Typical characteristics of a collapsed runner were identified providing new information which could be beneficial in the medical planning of larger running competitions and future preventative interventions. Importantly, life threatening conditions seem uncommon; no case of hyponatremia and only two cases of hypoglycemia were seen."

Sufficient intake of dietary choline is critical for proper brain function and neurodevelopment. This is especially important for brain development during the perinatal period. Current dietary recommendations for choline intake were undertaken without critical evaluation of maternal choline levels. As such, recommended levels may be insufficient for both mother and fetus. Herein, we examined the impact of perinatal maternal choline supplementation (MCS) in a mouse model of Down syndrome and Alzheimer's disease, the Ts65Dn mouse relative to normal disomic littermates, to examine the effects on gene expression within adult offspring at ∼6 and 11 mo of age. We found MCS produces significant changes in offspring gene expression levels that supersede age-related and genotypic gene expression changes. Alterations due to MCS impact every gene ontology category queried, including GABAergic neurotransmission, the endosomal-lysosomal pathway and autophagy, and neurotrophins, highlighting the importance of proper choline intake during the perinatal period, especially when the fetus is known to have a neurodevelopmental disorder such as trisomy.—Alldred, M.

Eighty-four patients with CVD were assessed and divided into two groups based on the presence of visceral obesity (VO). In patients with VO, the thickness of the epicardial deposits of the left and right ventricles were 1.75 and 1.43 times greater, respectively, than in patients without VO. For patients with VO, the prevalence of the volume of the left anterior descending artery was 10% higher, and the middle third of the envelope artery was 28% higher, when compared to patients without VO. When evaluating inflammatory status, it was established that the concentration of tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, and leptin in the blood serum of patients with VO exceeded the values of patients without VO. The level of anti-inflammatory IL-10 was 2-times lower in patients with VO. The findings of this study show that increased EAT and PVAT are independent risk factors of CVD, as well as a possible model for the assessment of drug effectiveness for CVD."
https://openalex.org/W2965449762,"Mast cells represent a heterogeneous cell population that is well-known for the production of heparin and the release of histamine upon activation. Serglycin is a proteoglycan that within mast cell α-granules is predominantly decorated with the glycosaminoglycans heparin or chondroitin sulfate (CS) and has a known role in granule homeostasis. Heparanase is a heparin-degrading enzyme, is present within the α-granules, and contributes to granule homeostasis, but an equivalent CS-degrading enzyme has not been reported previously. In this study, using several approaches, including epitope-specific antibodies, immunohistochemistry, and EM analyses, we demonstrate that human HMC-1 mast cells produce the CS-degrading enzymes hyaluronidase-1 (HYAL1) and HYAL4. We observed that treating the two model CS proteoglycans aggrecan and serglycin with HYAL1 and HYAL4 in vitro cleaves the CS chains into lower molecular weight forms with nonreducing end oligosaccharide structures similar to CS stub neoepitopes generated after digestion with the bacterial lyase chondroitinase ABC. We found that these structures are associated with both the CS linkage region and with structures more distal toward the nonreducing end of the CS chain. Furthermore, we noted that HYAL4 cleaves CS chains into lower molecular weight forms that range in length from tetra- to dodecasaccharides. These results provide first evidence that mast cells produce HYAL4 and that this enzyme may play a specific role in maintaining α-granule homeostasis in these cells by cleaving CS glycosaminoglycan chains attached to serglycin."
https://openalex.org/W2990038714,"Background Understanding patterns of socio-economic inequalities in tobacco consumption is key to design targeted public health policies for tobacco control. This study examines socio-economic inequalities in smoking and involuntary exposure to tobacco smoke between 2005 and 2013. Methods Data were derived from the Argentine National Risk Factors Surveys, conducted in 2005, 2009, and 2013. Two inequality measures were calculated: the age-adjusted prevalence ratio (PR) and the disparity index (DI). Educational level, household income per consumer unit and employment status were used as proxies for socio-economic status (SES). Generalized linear models were used in the analysis. Results Prevalence of smoking decreased from 29.7% to 25.1% between 2005 and 2013, mainly in women (p<0.001). Despite the overall prevalence reduction, socio-economic inequalities in smoking persisted. For both men and women, the DI was moderately high for smoking (14.47%-33.06%) across the three surveys. In men, the PR indicated a higher smoking prevalence for lower educational levels and lower household income throughout the analyzed period. In women, unlike previous years, the 2013 survey showed disparity related to unemployment. Involuntary exposure to tobacco smoke in 2013 was associated with educational level and household income, with lower involuntary exposure among those with higher SES. Conclusions While overall smoking rates have decreased in Argentina, socio-economic disparities related to tobacco smoking persist. Comprehensive tobacco control programs targeted to address these inequalities are essential in developing strategies to reduce health disparities in tobacco-related diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2948609096,"Concerns about the use of child labor in West African cocoa production became widespread in the early 2000s in many high-income countries. In 2015 in Ghana, 91.8% (or a total of 878,595) of the children working in the cocoa sector were involved in a form of hazardous work. Child labor in cocoa production is not just a symptom of poverty but also a contributing factor, as children often forgo a formal education to work in cocoa orchards. Current Ghanaian law prohibits child labor, but, with many cocoa households living in poverty, child labor becomes a necessity for survival, and as such, current child labor laws are rarely enforced. Therefore, an effective policy that eliminates child labor could compensate farmers by providing an economic incentive. In this paper, we develop and calibrate a farm household model to estimate the cocoa price premium necessary to eliminate child labor from cocoa production while leaving the farm household welfare unchanged. This welfare-neutral price premium removes the negative effects of eliminating child labor for the farm household. Varying degrees of child labor exists, with certain forms posing a greater risk to children’s wellbeing. The results show that eliminating the worst forms of child labor would require a cocoa price premium of 2.81% and eliminating regular work (non-hazardous work but over the maximum hours allowed for a child) and the worst forms would require an 11.81% premium, which could be paid for by the well-established Ghanaian Cocoa Marketing Board. An incentive for the Cocoa Marketing Board to pay the price premium and monitor and enforce this policy would be the ability to differentiate their cocoa as child-labor free and not lose market share to countries who cannot currently certify this practice."
https://openalex.org/W2955981370,"One common reason for cancer chemotherapy failure is increased drug efflux catalyzed by membrane transporters with broad pump substrate specificities, which leads to resistances to a wide range of chemically unrelated drugs. This multidrug resistance (MDR) phenomenon results in failed therapies and poor patient prognoses. A common cause of MDR is over-expression of the P-glycoprotein (ABCB1/P-gp) transporter. We report here on an MDR modulator that is a small molecule inhibitor of P-glycoprotein, but is not a pump substrate for P-gp and we show for the first time that extended exposure of an MDR prostate cancer cell line to the inhibitor following treatment with chemotherapeutics and inhibitor resulted in trapping of the chemotherapeutics within the cancerous cells. This trapping led to decreased cell viability, survival, and motility, and increased indicators of apoptosis in the cancerous cells. In contrast, extended exposure of non-Pgp-overexpressing cells to the inhibitor during and after similar chemotherapy treatments did not lead to decreased cell viability and survival, indicating that toxicity of the chemotherapeutic was not increased by the inhibitor. Increases in efficacy in treating MDR cancer cells without increasing toxicity to normal cells by such extended inhibitor treatment might translate to increased clinical efficacy of chemotherapies if suitable inhibitors can be developed."

We still have much to learn about their cellular roles, and evidence suggests that some may have more than one function. For example, RHBDL4 (rhomboid-like protein 4) is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)–resident protease that forms a ternary complex with ubiquitinated substrates and p97/VCP (valosin-containing protein), a major driver of ER-associated degradation (ERAD). RHBDL4 is required for ERAD of some substrates, such as the pre–T-cell receptor α chain (pTα) and has also been shown to cleave amyloid precursor protein to trigger its secretion. In another case, RHBDL4 enables the release of full-length transforming growth factor α in exosomes. Using the proximity proteomic method BioID, here we screened for proteins that interact with or are in close proximity to RHBDL4. Bioinformatics analyses revealed that BioID hits of RHBDL4 overlap with factors related to protein stress at the ER, including proteins that interact with p97/VCP. PTP1B (protein-tyrosine phosphatase nonreceptor type 1, also called PTPN1) was also identified as a potential proximity factor and interactor of RHBDL4. Analysis of RHBDL4 peptides highlighted the presence of tyrosine phosphorylation at the cytoplasmic RHBDL4 C terminus. Site-directed mutagenesis targeting these tyrosine residues revealed that their phosphorylation modifies binding of RHBDL4 to p97/VCP and Lys63-linked ubiquitinated proteins.

In this case, full-length pro-TGFα is released associated with exosomes from cells, by a mechanism that is currently unknown, although its traffic and secretion dynamics is likely controlled by RHBDL4 catalytic residues. Finally, in another context, RHBDL4 behaves as a sheddase-like rhomboid protease, cleaving and thereby releasing the extracellular domain of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), and its close homologues, amyloid precursor like protein 1 (APLP1) and 2 (APLP2), in a cholesterol-regulated manner (13Paschkowsky S.

Similarly, phorbol 13-myristate 12-acetate treatment can synergize with RHBDL4 activity to increase the secretion of TGFα (14Wunderle L. Knopf J.D. Kühnle N. Morlé A. Hehn B. Adrain C. Strisovsky K.

Until now there have been no reports of whether RHBDL4 is regulated by any post-translational modification that could affect its molecular functions. A powerful approach to uncovering the functional mechanisms of uncharacterized proteins is to identify their binding partners. BioID is a spatial proteomic approach in which a promiscuous R118G mutant of the Escherichia coli biotin ligase BirA (BirA*) is used to label proteins within the radius of ∼10 nm from the bait (22Roux K.J.

Because of a biotin-streptavidin–based isolation strategy combined with stringent washes with 2.0% SDS, BioID provides a restricted list of candidate neighbors. Unlike more classical co-immunoprecipitation approaches, BioID can identify very weak and transient interactions that may nevertheless be functionally important including, for example, enzymes such as kinases or E3 ligases and their substrates (26McAllaster M.R.

To begin to understand how RHBDL4 can play its distinct roles, we conducted a comparative spatial proteomic study using BioID. We performed a BioID screen for RHBDL4, using the pseudoprotease iRhom2 as a comparative negative control to help identify RHBDL4-specific partners. Notable RHBDL4 hits included the nonreceptor type tyrosine phosphatase PTP1B, known also as PTPN1. As an initial approach to validating their functional significance, we used MS to identify a cluster of phosphorylated tyrosine residues in the RHBDL4 cytoplasmic tail and uncovered their ability to modulate binding to Lys63-linked polyubiquitin and p97/VCP. This work begins to address the molecular protein networks surrounding RHBDL4 and therefore to provide a foundation for future mechanistic understanding of how this conserved rhomboid protease performs its apparently diverse biological roles. We performed a BioID screen with the protease RHBDL4 and, as a negative control to assess the specificity of RHBDL4 hits, with iRhom2, a nonprotease rhomboid-like protein located predominantly in the ER. WT human RHBDL4 was tagged at the cytoplasmic C terminus with a flexible arm of seven serines followed by BirA* (RHBDL4mycBirA*). Likewise, human iRhom2 was tagged at its cytoplasmic N terminus with mycBirA* followed by seven serines (mycBirA*iRhom2). We generated HeLa cells stably expressing mycBirA*, RHBDL4mycBirA*, and mycBirA*iRhom2. Additionally, we made HEK293 cells stably expressing RHBDL4mycBirA*. The expected sizes of the tagged proteins were measured by Western blotting as mycBirA* c30 kDa, RHBDL4mycBirA* c70 kDa, and mycBirA*iRhom2 c130 kDa (Fig. 1A). These molecular masses are consistent with those of BirA (35 kDa), RHBDL4 (36 kDa), or iRhom2 (93 kDa). Treatment with 50 μm biotin for 18 h had no impact on these bands (Fig. 1A), but when neutravidin-HRP was used to detect cellular biotinylation, the same lysates showed intense labeling in biotin treated-cells that were expressing mycBirA*, RHBDL4mycBirA*, and mycBirA*iRhom2 (Fig. 1B). As expected, endogenous mitochondrial carboxylases that contain biotin as covalently bound co-factor are visible in all cells at 130 kDa and between 100 and 70 kDa. In immunofluorescent micrographs, RHBDL4mycBirA* and mycBirA*iRhom2 were primarily localized in the ER, which is consistent with the localization of RHBDL4 and iRhom2 (8Fleig L. Bergbold N.

Upon treatment with biotin, RHBDL4mycBirA*-dependent biotinylation was detected with fluorescent streptavidin-Alexa 488 conjugate, and comparing it with the mitochondrially localized carboxylases that were labeled by anti-cytochrome c oxidase 4 (COX4) antibody (Fig. 1C, top row). Interestingly, biotinylation was also detected toward the periphery of the cell, not overlapping with the ER marker, phosphodiester isomerase (PDI), or RHBDL4mycBirA*, which was localized with anti-BirA antibody. We concluded that the localization of RHBDL4mycBirA* and mycBirA*iRhom2 is consistent with the literature, and the biotinylation levels induced upon treatment with biotin were compatible with proteomic use. Biotinylated proteins in extracts from cells expressing mycBirA* alone, RHBDL4mycBirA*, and mycBirA*iRhom2 were captured by affinity purification and analyzed by MS. Results from two independent replicates in HEK293 cells and three replicates of HeLa cells were compared. We excluded any protein with less than three weighted spectral counts in all lists. We also ignored any protein that was found in the mycBirA* alone condition, because we considered them non-specific hits of the mutant biotin ligase (R118G). In HEK293 cells, peptides mapped reproducibly to more than 146 proteins for RHBDL4 that were absent in the BioID of BirA* alone (Fig. 2A, domains a and ab, and Table S1). BioID was repeated in HeLa cells, where ∼60 reproducible candidates were identified for RHBDL4 (Fig. 2A, domains ab and b, and Table S1). By intersecting the BioID of RHBDL4 from HEK293 and HeLa, 43 proteins were identified as common and high priority hits (Fig. 2A, domain ab, and Table S1). Similarly, ∼28 candidates specific for iRhom2 were identified after exclusion of proteins that are in common with the BioID of mycBirA* or RHBDL4 (Table S1). Approximately 80 proteins were common hits between RHBDL4 and iRhom2 in the BioIDs that were performed in HEK293 (Table S1).

To transport cargo efficiently and prevent futile ATP hydrolysis, myosin-5a motor function must be tightly regulated. The globular tail domain (GTD) of myosin-5a not only functions as the inhibitory domain but also serves as the binding site for a number of cargo adaptor proteins, including melanophilin (Mlph) and Rab-interacting lysosomal protein–like 2 (RILPL2). In this study, using various biochemical approaches, including ATPase, single-molecule motility, GST pulldown assays, and analytical ultracentrifugation, we demonstrate that the binding of both Mlph and RILPL2 to the GTD of myosin-5a is required for the activation of myosin-5a motor function under physiological ionic conditions. We also found that this activation is regulated by the small GTPase Rab36, a binding partner of RILPL2. In summary, our results indicate that RILPL2 is required for Mlph-mediated activation of Myo5a motor activity under physiological conditions and that Rab36 promotes this activation. We propose that Rab36 stimulates RILPL2 to interact with the myosin-5a GTD; this interaction then induces exposure of the Mlph-binding site in the GTD, enabling Mlph to interact with the GTD and activate myosin-5a motor activity.

We demonstrated that Mlph-GTBM is sufficient for activation of the ATPase activity of Myo5a by disrupting the head–GTD interaction (9Yao L.L. Cao Q.J. Zhang H.M. Zhang J. Cao Y. Li X.D.

However, all abovementioned activations of Myo5a by Mlph are observed only in the presence of elevated concentrations of salt (0.15–0.3 m KCl), suggesting that other unknown cellular factors might be required for the activation of Myo5a by Mlph (5Zhang N. Yao L.L. Li X.D. Regulation of class V myosin.Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2018; 75 (28730277): 261-27310.1007/s00018-017-2599-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). One candidate is RILPL2 (Rab-interacting lysosomal protein–like 2), a Rab-interacting lysosomal protein (RILP) family member. Mammalian cells express three RILP family proteins (RILP, RILPL1, and RILPL2), each of which contains two conserved regions, RH1 and RH2 (RILP homology region 1 and 2, respectively) (20Wang T. Wong K.K. Hong W. A unique region of RILP distinguishes it from its related proteins in its regulation of lysosomal morphology and interaction with Rab7 and Rab34.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15 (14668488): 815-82610.1091/mbc.e03-06-0413Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). RILPL2 was first identified as a binding partner of Myo5a in the brain (21Lisé M.F. Srivastava D.P. Arstikaitis P. Lett R.L. Sheta R. Viswanathan V. Penzes P. O'Connor T.P. El-Husseini A. Myosin-Va-interacting protein, RILPL2, controls cell shape and neuronal morphogenesis via Rac signaling.J. Cell Sci. 2009; 122 (19812310): 3810-382110.1242/jcs.050344Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Structural and biochemical studies show that the RH1 of RILPL2 can form a ternary complex with Myo5a-GTD and Mlph-GTBM (22Wei Z. Liu X. Yu C. Zhang M. Structural basis of cargo recognitions for class V myosins.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110 (23798443): 11314-1131910.1073/pnas.1306768110Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), suggesting that RILPL2 might cooperate with Mlph in regulating the motor function of Myo5a. In this work, we found that, similar to Mlph, RILPL2 is expressed in mouse melanocytes and demonstrated that both Mlph and RILPL2 are required for the activation of Myo5a motor function under physiological ionic strength. Moreover, the RILPL2/Mlph-GTBM activation of Myo5a motor function is stimulated by Rab36, a binding protein of RILPL2. These results indicate that RILPL2 and Rab36 play a key role in regulating Myo5a motor function. We first examined the expression of three RILP family proteins (RILP, RILPL1, and RILPL2) in melanocytes. The cDNAs of the three RILP family proteins were amplified by RT-PCR from mouse melanocytes, melan-a cells. DNA sequencing showed that these cDNAs are consistent with the reported sequences, indicating that all three RILP family proteins are expressed in melan-a cells. We then cloned the cDNAs of these three RILP family proteins into bacterial expression vectors. All three RILP family proteins, containing an N-terminal GST tag or His tag, were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by GSH-Sepharose or Ni-agarose chromatography. To test the interactions between RILP family proteins with Myo5a, we performed a GST pulldown assay. As shown in Fig. 1A, RILPL2, but not RILP or RILPL1, was specifically pulled down with GST-tagged Myo5a-GTD. These results are consistent with the previous finding that Myo5a-GTD specifically interacts with RILPL2-RH1 but not with RILP-RH1 (22Wei Z. Liu X. Yu C. Zhang M. Structural basis of cargo recognitions for class V myosins.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110 (23798443): 11314-1131910.1073/pnas.1306768110Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Because Myo5a-GTD, RILPL2-RH1, and Mlph-GTBM can form a ternary complex (22Wei Z. Liu X. Yu C. Zhang M. Structural basis of cargo recognitions for class V myosins.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110 (23798443): 11314-1131910.1073/pnas.1306768110Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that RILPL2-RH1 might enhance the interaction between Myo5a and Mlph-GTBM. To test this possibility, we produced His-tagged RILPL2-RH1 (residues 1–97), a truncated RILPL2 containing the conserved RH1. We then performed GST pulldown of GST-tagged Mlph-GTBM with FLAG-tagged Myo5a in the absence or presence of His-tagged RILPL2-RH1. The pulled down GST-Mlph-GTBM and FLAG-tagged full-length Myo5a were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 1B, RILPL2-RH1 substantially increased the amount of FLAG-Myo5a pulled down with GST-tagged Mlph-GTBM. We hypothesized that RILPL2-RH1 and Mlph-GTBM might co-regulate the motor function of Myo5a. To test this possibility, we examined Mlph-GTBM activation of the actin-activated ATPase activity (hereafter referred to as ATPase activity) of Myo5a in the absence or presence RILPL2-RH1 under physiological ionic strength conditions, i.e. in the presence of 100 mm KCl. As shown in Fig. 2A, 5 μm RILPL2-RH1 had little effect on Myo5a ATPase activity but substantially increased the Vmax and decreased the Kd of Myo5a ATPase activity activated by Mlph-GTBM. In the absence of RILPL2-RH1, Myo5a ATPase activity was activated by Mlph-GTBM with a Vmax of 2.97 ± 0.35 s−1 head−1 and a Kd of 30.1 ± 7.6 μm. In the presence of 5 μm RILPL2-RH1, Myo5a ATPase activity was strongly activated by Mlph-GTBM, with a Vmax of 5.73 ± 0.40 s−1 head−1 and a Kd of 2.83 ± 0.37 μm. We then examined the ionic strength dependence of RILPL2-RH1/Mlph-GTBM activation of Myo5a ATPase activity. As shown in Fig. 2B, activation of Myo5a ATPase activity by 40 μm Mlph-GTBM and/or 5 μm RILPL2-RH1 is highly dependent on ionic strength. Myo5a ATPase activity in the absence of Mlph-GTBM and RILPL2-RH1 fluctuated in a narrow range over different KCl concentrations. In the presence of 5 μm RILPL2-RH1 or 40 μm Mlph-GTBM, Myo5a ATPase activity was bell-shaped as a function of ionic strength, with a peak at 200–300 mm KCl. On the other hand, in the presence of both 5 μm RILPL2-RH1 and 40 μm Mlph-GTBM, Myo5a ATPase activity reached its climax around 100 mm KCl. These results indicate that both RILPL2-RH1 and Mlph-GTBM are required for activation of Myo5a motor function under physiological conditions. To further analyze the activation of Myo5a by RILPL2-RH1 and Mlph-GTBM, we examined the motility activity of Myo5a at the single-molecule level. Cy3B-labeled Myo5a was first mixed with or without 20 μm Mlph-GTBM and/or 5 μm RILPL2-RH1 and then introduced into a flow chamber decorated with Alexa 488–labeled actin filaments. Images of Cy3B and Alexa 488 fluorescence were recorded under a total internal reflection fluorescence microscope (Fig. 3A and Movies S1–S4). In the absence of Mlph-GTBM and RILPL2-RH1, very few fluorescent spots of Cy3B-Myo5a colocalized and moved along actin filaments, and addition of Mlph-GTBM and RILPL2-RH1 caused a 13.1 ± 0.7–fold increase in the number of Myo5a molecules moving per time and length compared with Myo5a alone (Fig. 3B). On the other hand, addition of either Mlph-GTBM or RILPL2-RH1 alone did not greatly increase the number of Cy3B-Myo5a molecules moving along actin filaments. These results indicate that both Mlph-GTBM and RILPL2-RH1 are required for activation of Myo5a motor activity. It is well established that activation of Myo5a ATPase activity by Ca2+ or adaptor proteins is accompanied by a conformational transition of Myo5a from the ∼14 S folded conformation in the off state to the ∼11 S extended conformation in the on state (6Wang F.

Rep. 2015; 5 (26039755): 1087410.1038/srep10874Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). We expected that RILPL2-RH1/Mlph-GTBM also induced the conformational transition of Myo5a. Therefore, we measured the S value of Myo5a in the presence of RILPL2-RH1 and/or Mlph-GTBM under physiological ionic strength (100 mm KCl) and in the absence of Ca2+ (in the presence of 1 mm EGTA). As shown in Fig. 4, the S value of Myo5a was 14.4 S and decreased to 12.2 S by 5 μm Mlph-GTBM and 5 μm RILPL2-RH1. On the other hand, 10 μm RILPL2-RH1 alone slightly increased the S value of Myo5a, and 10 μm Mlph-GTBM alone had little effect on it. These results indicate that, under physiological ionic strength and in the absence of Ca2+, both Mlph-GTBM and RILPL2-RH1 are required for inducing Myo5a to form the extended conformation. Moreover, Myo5a might be more compact in the presence of RILPL2-RH1 than in its absence. RILPL2 contains two functional domains, RH1 and the RH2, which interact with Myo5a-GTD and Rab36, respectively (21Lisé M.F. Srivastava D.P. Arstikaitis P. Lett R.L. Sheta R. Viswanathan V. Penzes P. O'Connor T.P. El-Husseini A. Myosin-Va-interacting protein, RILPL2, controls cell shape and neuronal morphogenesis via Rac signaling.J.

To determine whether the interaction between RILPL2 and Rab36 depends on the nucleotide state of Rab36, we performed GST-RILPL2 pulldown with GTPγS-bound Rab36 (Rab36-GTPγS) or GDP-bound Rab36 (Rab36-GDP). As shown in Fig. 5A, more Rab36-GTPγS was pulled down with GST-RILPL2 than Rab36-GDP, indicating that the RILPL2–Rab36 interaction depends on the GTP-bound state of Rab36. We then examined the effects of Rab36 on RILPL2/Mlph-GTBM–mediated activation of Myo5a. We found that Mlph-GTBM activation of Myo5a ATPase activity was strongly enhanced by 5 μm RILPL2-RH1 (Fig. 5B, column 4) but weakly by 5 μm RILPL2 (Fig. 5B, column 6), suggesting that RH2 inhibits RH1/Mlph-GTBM–mediated activation of Myo5a. Because Rab36-GTPγS binds to RH2, we suspected that Rab36-GTPγS might relieve RILPL2-RH2 inhibition of the interaction between RILPL2-RH1 and Myo5a-GTD, stimulating RILPL2/Mlph-GTBM activation of Myo5a ATPase activity. We therefore measured Myo5a ATPase activity in the presence of RILPL2, Mlph-GTBM, and Rab36-GTPγS. Consistent with our expectation, 20 μm Rab36-GTPγS significantly enhanced Myo5a ATPase activity in the presence of RILPL2 and Mlph-GTBM (Fig. 5B, column 7). As a control, 20 μm Rab36-GTPγS had little effect on Myo5a ATPase activity in the absence of Mlph-GTBM (Fig. 5B, column 5). These results indicate that Rab36 regulates RILPL2/Mlph-GTBM–mediated activation of Myo5a. To further characterize the effects of Rab36 on the interaction between RILPL2 and Myo5a-GTD, we performed GST-Myo5a-GTD pulldown with RILPL2 and RILPL2-RH1 in the absence or presence of Rab36-GTPγS (Fig. 5C). We first compared the affinities of Myo5a-GTD with RILPL2 and RILPL2-RH1 using a GST pulldown assay. Both RILPL2 and the RILPL2-RH1 were stoichiometrically pulled down with GST-Myo5a-GTD (Fig. 5C, lanes 7 and 8), indicating strong interactions between Myo5a-GTD and RILPL2/RILPL2-RH1. However, a competition pulldown assay showed that RILPL2 has a lower affinity for Myo5a-GTD than RILPL2-RH1. When equal concentrations of RILPL2 and RILPL2-RH1 were present, significantly less RILPL2 was pulled down with GST-Myo5a-GTD than with RILPL2-RH1 (Fig. 5C, lane 9). We then examined the effects of Rab36 on the interaction between RILPL2 and Myo5a-GTD using a competition pulldown assay. We found that 15 μm Rab36-GTPγS significantly increased the amount of RILPL2 pulled down but decreased that of RILPL2-RH1 (Fig. 5C, compare lane 9 and lane 10). With Rab36-GTPγS increasing from 0 to 15 μm, the molar ratio of RILPL2 versus RILPL2-RH1 gradually increased from 0.28 ± 0.11 to 0.90 ± 0.18 (Fig. 5C, right panel). These results indicate that Rab36 regulates the interaction between RILPL2 and Myo5a-GTD. It is well established that the inhibited Myo5a is in a folded conformation, in which the GTD folds back to interact with the head, and the activated Myo5a is in an extended conformation, in which the head–GTD interaction is disrupted by Ca2+ or adaptor proteins (6Wang F.

In this study, we characterized the combined functions of the foot and ankle structures during walking by synthesizing the total force, displacement, and work profiles from structures distal to the shank. Eleven healthy adults walked at four scaled speeds. We quantified the ground reaction force and center-of-pressure displacement in the shank's coordinate system during stance phase and the total mechanical work done by these structures. This comprehensive analysis revealed emergent properties of foot-ankle structures that are analogous to passive springs: these structures compressed and recoiled along the longitudinal axis of the shank, and performed near zero or negative net mechanical work across a range of walking speeds. Moreover, the subject-to-subject variability in peak force, total displacement, and work were well explained by three simple factors: body height, mass, and walking speed. We created a regression-based model of stance phase mechanics that can inform the design and customization of wearable devices that may have biomimetic or non-biomimetic structures."
https://openalex.org/W2948793799,"Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) play an important role in the life activities of organisms. With the availability of large amounts of protein sequence data, PPIs prediction methods have attracted increasing attention. A variety of protein sequence coding methods have emerged, but the training of these methods is particularly time consuming. To solve this issue, we have proposed a novel matrix sequence coding method. Based on deep neural network (DNN) and a novel matrix protein sequence descriptor, we constructed a protein interaction prediction model for predicting PPIs. When performed on human PPIs data, the method achieved an accuracy of 94.34%, a recall of 98.28%, an area under the curve (AUC) of 97.79% and a loss of 23.25%. A non-redundant dataset was used to evaluate this prediction model, and the prediction accuracy is 88.29%. These results indicate that the matrix of sequence (MOS) descriptor can enhance the predictive power of PPIs and reduce training time, which can be a useful complement for future proteomics research. The experimental code and experimental results can be found at https://github.com/smalltalkman/hppi-tensorflow."
https://openalex.org/W2948424274,"Background/Objectives Studies have shown a strong relationship between depression and dementia. Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) were reported to be independently associated with depression and dementia. However, the relationship between depression and cognitive dysfunction in patients with LUTS is not well characterized. Method We conducted a matched cohort study by using a one-million population-based dataset in Taiwan. A total of 15,944 patients with LUTS aged 50 or older were included from 2001 to 2005 and followed up until their death or the end of 2012. During the follow-up period, 1958 cases developed depression subsequently and were defined as the study group. 7832 patients without depression were then identified as control group, matching by age, gender, insurance premium, status of catastrophic illness certificate, and the index year in a 1:4 ratio. The primary outcome was the onset of dementia. LUTS, depression, dementia, and other comorbidities were defined by the International Classification of Disease, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification coding system. Cox hazards models and Aalen Johansen curves were applied to measure the influence of depression on the risk of dementia in patients with LUTS. Results The crude incidence of depression among people with LUTS was 12.3%. The incidence of dementia in the depression group was significantly higher than that in the control group (12.2% versus 8.9%; P < 0.001). Depression was associated with a significantly greater risk of subsequent dementia after adjusted for socioeconomic status, number of outpatient visits and multiple comorbidities (adjusted hazard ratio: 1.32; 95% confidence interval: 1.13–1.54). Conclusions Depression is a major risk factor for the onset of subsequent dementia in patients with LUTS. Early screening and interventions for depression in patients with LUTS may be important to maintain cognitive function."

We shine a spotlight on his seminal work describing how the innate ability of embryonic stem cells to self-organize into layers and grow in a polarized fashion fosters their appropriate differentiation and response to morphogens. Yoshiki Sasai pioneered the organoid field with his idea of mimicking embryonic development in 3D. We shine a spotlight on his seminal work describing how the innate ability of embryonic stem cells to self-organize into layers and grow in a polarized fashion fosters their appropriate differentiation and response to morphogens. As Hans Clevers highlighted in 2016, the use of the term “organoid” witnessed a revival in recent years and acquired a new meaning. In the past 4 decades, “organoids” were mainly used in classic developmental biology experiments in the effort to study organogenesis by cell dissociation-reaggregation experiments. Now the term refers to three-dimensional (3D) aggregates obtained from embryonic stem cells (ESCs), induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), and tissue-specific adult stem cells (aSCs), implying an organized system where undifferentiated cells develop in a coordinated fashion. Yoshiki Sasai pioneered this new conceptualization. Sasai’s group was the first to propose the idea that pluripotent cells can differentiate and generate highly complex and organized structures mimicking normal tissue and organ development when grown in 3D. He envisioned that, under 3D culture conditions, cell differentiation could be optimized and more physiological because the cells, free from physical constaints imposed by the plastic surface of a culture dish, have the ability to rearrange themselves and self-organize in layered and polarized stuctures as dictated by their own surface properties and internal genetic programs. More than 10 years ago, Sasai’s laboratory designed conditions with tightly controlled medium and cell number to re-create the right environment for cells to spontaneously organize in the 3D space and prefigure a complex organ, such as the brain. They pioneered the generation of 3D forebrain structures from mouse and human ESCs, quickly followed by optic cup, neocortex, cerebellum, hippocampus, adenohypophysis, ventral telencephalon, and pituitary gland (Kadoshima et al., 2013Kadoshima T. Sakaguchi H. Nakano T. Soen M. Ando S. Eiraku M. Sasai Y.

Next-generation regenerative medicine: organogenesis from stem cells in 3D culture.Cell Stem Cell. 2013; 12: 520-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). This was a stunning demonstration of Sasai’s idea that ESCs realize a higher level of spatiotemporal organization when grown in a “multicellular society,” where their interactions actuated their own internal genetic programs, possibly through local signaling systems (Sasai, 2013Sasai Y. Next-generation regenerative medicine: organogenesis from stem cells in 3D culture.Cell Stem Cell. 2013; 12: 520-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Among all Sasai’s protocols, common parameters include an initial aggregation of stem cells, a general neural induction, and, in many cases, brief periods of exposure to specific morphogens for tissue-specific patterning and growth factor stimulation, followed by an extended period in growth-factor-free medium to favor cell-cycle exit and differentiation. Under these conditions, the community of ESC-derived neural progenitors goes through a complex series of stereotyped events resulting in tissue-like stratifications, compartment formation, and coordinated cell movements (such as in the formation of an optic cup) in the absence of further exogenous signaling. Even though Sasai’s team did not call their 3D structures “organoids,” their basic procedural layout is followed by organoid protocols today. Building on the long-born concept that in the absence of epidermal and mesodermal inducing signals (mimicked in vitro by Nodal, BMP, and Wnts inhibitors), ESCs will intrinsically acquire rostral neural fate by a “default model of neural induction,” Sasai’s team achieved the differentiation of dorsal telencephalic precursors from aggregates of mouse ESCs, called embryoid bodies (EBs), under conditions that minimize the addition of external pattern-inducing molecules (Watanabe et al., 2005Watanabe K. Kamiya D. Nishiyama A. Katayama T. Nozaki S. Kawasaki H. Watanabe Y. Mizuseki K. Sasai Y. Directed differentiation of telencephalic precursors from embryonic stem cells.Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 288-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). A few years later, they developed a 3D-aggregation culture system, which they called SFEBq (serum-free floating culture of EB-like aggregates with quick reaggregation) in which aggregates of mouse and human ESCs spontaneously self-organized to form apico-basally polarized cortical tissue (Eiraku et al., 2008Eiraku M. Watanabe K. Matsuo-Takasaki M. Kawada M. Yonemura S. Matsumura M. Wataya T. Nishiyama A. Muguruma K. Sasai Y. Self-organized formation of polarized cortical tissues from ESCs and its active manipulation by extrinsic signals.Cell Stem Cell. 2008; 3: 519-532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar). These aggregates could be further patterned to rostral or caudal cortical fate by the addition of molecules that created intra-aggregate morphogen gradients, e.g. treatment with FGF8 promoting rostral pallial fate. In their seminal paper on SFEBq culture, Sasai’s group used mouse and human ESCs. Inspired by this work, we applied their protocol to human iPSCs. Our findings (Mariani et al., 2012Mariani J. Simonini M.V. Palejev D. Tomasini L. Coppola G. Szekely A.M. Horvath T.L. Vaccarino F.M. Modeling human cortical development in vitro using induced pluripotent stem cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2012; 109: 12770-12775Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar) suggested that iPSCs could be used with Sasai’s protocol to generate bona fide human cortical neurons. This was later confirmed by Sasai’s group (Kadoshima et al., 2013Kadoshima T. Sakaguchi H. Nakano T. Soen M. Ando S. Eiraku M. Sasai Y. Self-organization of axial polarity, inside-out layer pattern, and species-specific progenitor dynamics in human ES cell-derived neocortex.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110: 20284-20289Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar) and opened the way for other scientific teams, including ours, to generate stem cell-derived dorsal forebrain organoids in a more reproducible and higher throughput fashion (Mariani et al., 2015Mariani J. Coppola G. Zhang P. Abyzov A. Provini L. Tomasini L. Amenduni M. Szekely A. Palejev D. Wilson M. et al.FOXG1-Dependent Dysregulation of GABA/Glutamate Neuron Differentiation in Autism Spectrum Disorders.Cell. 2015; 162: 375-390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). A decade after Sasai established the foundations for the field, organoid culture methods have diversified. A variety of organoid models are used today: unpatterned organoids containing a variety of brain regions (Lancaster et al., 2013Lancaster M.A. Renner M. Martin C.A. Wenzel D. Bicknell L.S. Hurles M.E. Homfray T. Penninger J.M. Jackson A.P. Knoblich J.A. Cerebral organoids model human brain development and microcephaly.Nature. 2013; 501: 373-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (2769) Google Scholar); patterned organoids, where stem cells are directed to differentiate into a specific regional fate (spinal cord, cortex, basal ganglia, cerebellum) by the addition of extrinsic morphogens; and organoids derived from adult tissue-specific stem cells, such as intestinal stem cells. Each system has its own advantages and its use is dependent on the experimental questions being asked. Yet, we believe it was Sasai’s seminal concept of self-organization and his emphasis on the power of intercellular signaling via endogenously generated morphogens that laid the foundations for the “organoid” field, including his realization that it could be harnessed for modeling a variety of different cell and organ types. Brain organoids have become very powerful and invaluable research tools to understand/mimic normal and abnormal brain development beginning from its very early stages in a dynamic way. Moreover, the ability to generate “personal” organoids from patient-specific iPSCs has opened new frontiers for disease modeling, drug discovery, and gene therapy. The field of brain organoids is still in its infancy. Being able to mimic later stages of brain development and maturation is, and is going to be, one of the main efforts of many scientists in the next few years. Also, the development of robust and, at the same time, scalable in vitro methods for the generation of brain organoids is on the top list of many laboratories. Understanding the strengths and limitations of each in vitro modeling system will help the field move forward. At the same time, a key question that we should constantly keep asking is to what extent organoids mimic their in vivo counterpart. Ultimately, as Sasai undoubtedly realized, organoids should not be taken as a system that reproduces comprehensively and faithfully the developing brain, but instead as a model for key aspects of brain development. Organoids may help us unravel, in an experimentally tractable fashion, developmental principles that would otherwise be impossible to understand in a human system as well as help us disentangle the collective cellular, molecular, and genetic events underlying morphogenesis.

https://openalex.org/W2948121255,"There is strong evidence that neuronal hyper-excitability underlies migraine, and may or may not be preceded by cortical spreading depression. However, the mechanisms for cortical spreading depression and/or migraine are not established. Previous studies reported that cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) [Na+] is higher during migraine, and that higher extracellular [Na+] leads to hyper-excitability. We raise the hypothesis that altered choroid plexus Na+, K+-ATPase activity can cause both migraine phenomena: inhibition raises CSF [K+] and initiates cortical spreading depression, while activation raises CSF [Na+] and causes migraine. In this study, we examined levels of specific Na+, K+-ATPase inhibitors, endogenous ouabain-like compounds (EOLC), in CSF from migraineurs and controls. CSF EOLC levels were significantly lower during ictal migraine (0.4 nM +/- 0.09) than from either controls (1.8 nM +/- 0.4) or interictal migraineurs (3.1 nM +/- 1.9). Blood plasma EOLC levels were higher in migraineurs than controls, but did not differ between ictal and interictal states. In a Sprague-Dawley rat model of nitroglycerin-triggered central sensitization, we changed the concentrations of EOLC and CSF sodium, and measured aversive mechanical threshold (von Frey hairs), trigeminal nucleus caudalis activation (cFos), and CSF [Na+] (ultra-high field 23Na MRI). Animals were sensitized by three independent treatments: intraperitoneal nitroglycerin, immunodepleting EOLC from cerebral ventricles, or cerebroventricular infusion of higher CSF [Na+]. Conversely, nitroglycerin-triggered sensitization was prevented by either vascular or cerebroventricular delivery of the specific Na+, K+-ATPase inhibitor, ouabain. These results affirm our hypothesis that higher CSF [Na+] is linked to human migraine and to a rodent migraine model, and demonstrate that EOLC regulates them both. Our data suggest that altered choroid plexus Na+, K+-ATPase activity is a common source of these changes, and may be the initiating mechanism in migraine."

We shine a spotlight on the platform’s enormous potential for studying cancer biology and as a preclinical human tumor model that can facilitate drug discovery and personalized therapy. Until recently, traditional two-dimensional (2D) neoplastic cell lines have been a mainstay of cancer research. However, the culture medium for monolayer cell lines lacks the supporting niche factors for stem cell growth, making it difficult to establish cancer cell lines and severely restricting the molecular repertoire that can be captured. Moreover, normal cell lines or cell lines representing early neoplastic stages were also lacking. Then, in 2009, Sato et al. described the ability to indefinitely culture three-dimensional (3D) organoids in Matrigel from single Lgr5-positive intestinal stem cells under defined culture conditions artificially providing niche factors (R-spondin, EGF, and noggin for small intestines, subsequently adding Wnt for other organs) (Sato et al., 2009Sato T.

The next 5 years saw the establishment of numerous long-term organoid culture protocols of normal epithelial cells from an array of different organs, incorporating organ-specific niche factor combinations. Subsequently, in 2014, Gao et al. and Li et al. described major breakthroughs for the use of organoid models in cancer research. Gao et al. cultured organoids from human metastatic prostate tumors from diverse disease sites or circulating tumor cells (Gao et al., 2014Gao D. Vela I. Sboner A. Iaquinta P.J. Karthaus W.R.

Sachs N. et al.Identification of multipotent luminal progenitor cells in human prostate organoid cultures.Cell. 2014; 159: 163-175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). They successfully generated seven novel organoid lines that harbored prostate-cancer-specific driver alterations, including ETS-translocations, CHD1 loss, and SPOP and FOXA1 mutations, of which the latter three had not been previously represented in 2D prostate cancer cell line models. This landmark study reported the first tumor organoid biobank capturing the molecular diversity of a solid tumor type. They performed comprehensive genomic analysis and documented that apart from driver mutations, the organoids highly recapitulated in vivo prostate cancers in copy number alterations, gene expression subtypes, and histological patterns. Moreover, they were able to engraft in immunodeficient mice to recapitulate the original histological patterns of the patients. Finally, the authors demonstrated that these lines were amenable to drug testing both in vitro and in vivo. Although their initial success rate was only 15%–20%, this study set the scene for numerous subsequent studies describing the generation of large biobank collections of patient-derived organoids from various organs, including primary colon, stomach, gastresophageal, pancreas, liver, breast, etc. (Drost and Clevers, 2018Drost J. Clevers H. Organoids in cancer research.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2018; 18: 407-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar, Yan et al., 2018Yan H.H.N. Siu H.C. Law S. Ho S.L. Yue S.S.K. Tsui W.Y. Chan D.

All of these studies consistently illustrated that tumor organoids highly resemble the original tumor tissue and that they are genetically stable over long-term in vitro culture, making them a superior model for drug screening. Indeed, the feasibility of large-scale drug sensitivity screening directly using patient-derived tumor organoids in vitro or mouse xenografts in vivo has already been demonstrated across various tumor types. The initial ALI organoid cultures from the normal intestine, gastric, or pancreatic tissue of neonatal mice could be maintained for >30 days, but it could not be passaged. Li et al. then engineered ALI pancreatic organoids with combination driver mutations of known cancer genes (Li et al., 2014Li X. Nadauld L. Ootani A. Corney D.C. Pai R.K. Gevaert O. Cantrell M.A. Rack P.G. Neal J.T. Chan C.W. et al.Oncogenic transformation of diverse gastrointestinal tissues in primary organoid culture.Nat. Med. 2014; 20: 769-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). The authors collected organoids from mice bearing KrasG12D LSL and/or p53flox/flox alleles and infected them with adenovirus-expressing Cre-GFP. These organoids were able to proliferate, could be serially passaged, and formed tumors when transplanted subcutaneously. The authors also established a colorectal cancer progression model whereby tamoxifen-treated organoids derived from villin-CreER;Apcflox/flox mice were subsequently transduced with retroviruses expressing mutant Kras, p53 shRNA, and Smad4 shRNA. They observed progressive dysplasia with increasing number of mutations and transformation into cribriform growth reminiscent of in vivo cancers with those four mutations. Subcutaneous xenotranplantation of the quadruple mutant organoids resulted in tumors with poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma morphology, whereas organoids with only Apc loss could not form tumors. Although the strategy of RNA interference and mutant cDNA overexpression by Li et al. does not produce permanent genetic alterations, this study nonetheless established the framework and potential for using normal organoid cultures to model stepwise oncogenic transformation. Shortly thereafter, a study using Crispr-Cas9 to engineer the same four mutations in pure human epithelial intestinal organoids in 3D Matrigel also generated adenocarcinoma in vitro and in vivo (Drost et al., 2015Drost J. van Jaarsveld R.H. Ponsioen B. Zimberlin C. van Boxtel R. Buijs A. Sachs N. Overmeer R.M. Offerhaus G.J. Begthel H. et al.Sequential cancer mutations in cultured human intestinal stem cells.Nature. 2015; 521: 43-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). This enabled follow-up orthotopic transplantation studies that made it possible to examine metastatic potential in a physiological environment. The potential utility of both models continues to evolve to encompass the study of the microenvironment and immune regulation. The group of Li et al. has recently enhanced their ALI organoid model by including niche factor supplementation, which preserves the stromal fibroblasts and a diversity of immune cell types, including the original tumor T cell spectrum, macrophages, and natural killer cells (Neal et al., 2018Neal J.T. Li X. Zhu J. Giangarra V. Grzeskowiak C.L. Ju J. Liu I.H. Chiou S.-H. Salahudeen A.A. Smith A.R. et al.Organoid Modeling of the Tumor Immune Microenvironment.Cell. 2018; 175: 1972-1988.e1916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). Although the culture cannot go beyond 60 days, it allows a window of opportunity in which to study the effects of immune-modulatory drugs such as anti-PD1 and anti-PDL1. As an alternative approach, peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBMCs) can be artificially co-cultured with autologous pure epithelial tumor organoids to generate tumor-reactive T cells, thus establishing a platform to assess the efficiency of T cell-mediated tumor killing (Dijkstra et al., 2018Dijkstra K.K. Cattaneo C.M. Weeber F. Chalabi M. van de Haar J. Fanchi L.F. Slagter M. van der Velden D.L. Kaing S. Kelderman S. et al.Generation of Tumor-Reactive T Cells by Co-culture of Peripheral Blood Lymphocytes and Tumor Organoids.Cell. 2018; 174: 1586-1598.e1512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). The continuous development of these platforms will have huge potential applications in cancer research. The ALI model, which conveniently uses one culture medium for all tumor types, requires a shorter time to establish and has a higher success rate, but it is short-term in nature. This ALI model may be further exploited for individual patient drug selection in a precision oncology setting. The Matrigel method with pure epithelial organoids, which has the capability for long-term culture and can be scaled up for large-scale drug screening, offers other unique opportunities for cancer cell biology studies and drug testing. The pure tumor epithelial culture allows a clear delineation of the cancer cell transcriptome, DNA copy number changes, and biallelic inactivation of tumor suppressors, which is often difficult to define in the tumor tissue that is often confounded by normal contamination. Furthermore, the organoids retain their reliance on niche factors, thus offering a clean functional assay of the integrity of key oncogenic signaling pathways (e.g., Wnt, BMP, and EGF), potentially facilitating the discovery of new mechanisms causing perturbation to these pathways. Additionally, the consistent retention of the EBV viral episomes in gastric cancer organoids (Yan et al., 2018Yan H.H.N. Siu H.C. Law S. Ho S.L. Yue S.S.K. Tsui W.Y. Chan D. Chan A.S. Ma S.

Recently, pure tumor epithelial cultures have also been demonstrated to capture intra-tumoral heterogeneity of oncogenic amplifications common in chromosome-unstable cancers (Yan et al., 2018Yan H.H.N. Siu H.C. Law S. Ho S.L. Yue S.S.K. Tsui W.Y. Chan D. Chan A.S. Ma S.

Yet, many challenges still remain, but continuous improvement of the platform is in progress, such as the availability of better synthetic 3D matrices and highly potent Wnt surrogates, along with optimized methods to favor growth of cancerous instead of normal organoids. Overall, organoid technology holds great promise to completely change the way we study and treat cancer, and future efforts will surely bring this novel technique closer to clinical practice.

A recent model utilises allometric coefficients for five of the seven extant bee families (Apoidea: Anthophila) to include crucial but difficult-to-measure traits, such as proboscis length, in ecological and evolutionary studies. Melittidae were not included although they are important pollinators in South Africa where they comprise an especially rich and morphologically diverse fauna. We measured intertegular distance (correlated with body size) and proboscis length of 179 specimens of 11 species from three genera of Melittidae. With the inclusion of Melittidae, we tested the between family differences in the allometric scaling coefficients. AIC model selection was used to establish which factors provide the best estimate of proboscis length. We explored a hypothesis that has been proposed in the literature, but which has not been tested, whereby body and range sizes of bees are correlated with rainfall regions. We tested this by using body size measurements of 2109 museum specimens from 56 species of Melittidae and applied the model coefficients to estimate proboscis length and foraging distance. Our results from testing differences across bee families show that with the addition of Melittidae, we retained the overall pattern of significant differences in the scaling coefficient among Apoidea, with our model explaining 98% of the variance in species-level means for proboscis length. When testing the relationship between body size and rainfall region we found no relationship for South African Melittidae. Overall, this study has added allometric scaling coefficients for an important bee family and shown the applicability of using these coefficients when linked with museum specimens to test ecological hypothesis."

We compared outcomes in incident PD patients according to their baseline heart failure status.This retrospective cohort study evaluated all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in incident PD patients with different heart failure status (non-CRS, acute heart failure [AHF], type II CRS, type IV CRS) who started PD between 2006 and 2016 in the Peking University Third Hospital.Of 748 patients included in the study, there were 466 (62.3%), 214 (28.6%), 27 (3.6%), and 41 (5.5%) patients in the non-CRS, AHF, type II CRS and type IV CRS groups, respectively. Patients with CRS were older (p<0.001), with more diabetes mellitus (p<0.001), coronary heart history (p<0.001), higher estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (p<0.001), lower serum creatinine (p<0.001) and phosphorus levels (p = 0.003) compared to non-CRS patients. Respective all-cause survival rates for patients with non-CRS, AHF, type II CRS and type IV CRS were 90.6%, 87.1%, 85.2% and 84.8% at 1 year, and 63.1%, 47.7%, 27.3% and 35.1% at 5 years (p<0.001). The corresponding figures for cardiovascular survival were 93%, 92%, 84% and 81% at 1 year, and 67%, 59%, 55% and 54% at 5 years (p<0.001). However, after adjusting for confounding factors, the presence of CRS was not independently associated with all-cause mortality whereas type IV CRS (HR 2.10, 95% CI 1.03-4.28, p = 0.04) was associated with higher cardiovascular mortality as compared to without CRS.Incident PD patients with different types of CRS had higher rates of both all-cause and cardiovascular mortality compared with patients without CRS. However, these observed adverse outcomes may be related to associated older age and higher prevalence of comorbidities, rather than CRS per se, except for type IV CRS, treatment strategies to reduce high cardiovascular CVD mortality may needed."
https://openalex.org/W2797387695,"Cell segmentation in microscopy is a challenging problem, since cells are often asymmetric and densely packed. This becomes particularly challenging for extremely large images, since manual intervention and processing time can make segmentation intractable. In this paper, we present an efficient and highly parallel formulation for symmetric three-dimensional (3D) contour evolution that extends previous work on fast two-dimensional active contours. We provide a formulation for optimization on 3D images, as well as a strategy for accelerating computation on consumer graphics hardware. The proposed software takes advantage of Monte-Carlo sampling schemes in order to speed up convergence and reduce thread divergence. Experimental results show that this method provides superior performance for large 2D and 3D cell segmentation tasks when compared to existing methods on large 3D brain images."

We attempted to develop a prediction model for future atrial fibrillation hospitalization (AFH) risk in PAF and PeAF patients including all previously experienced AFHs in the analysis, as opposed to time to first event.Recurrent event survival analysis was used to model the impact of past AFHs on the risk of future AFHs. A recurrent event was defined as a hospitalization due to a new episode of AF. Death or progression to permanent AF were included as competing risks.We enrolled 174 patients with PAF or PeAF, mean follow up duration was 1279 days, and 325 AFHs were observed. Median patient age was 63.0 (IQR 52.2-68.0), 29% had PAF, and 71% were male. Highly significant predictors of future AFH risk were PeAF (HR 3.20, CI 2.01-5.11) and number of past AFHs observed (HR for 1 event: 2.97, CI 2.04-4.32, HR for ≥2 events: 7.54, CI 5.47-10.40).In PAF and PeAF patients, AF type and observed AFH frequency are highly significant predictors of future AFH risk. The developed model enables risk prediction in individual patients based on AFH history and baseline characteristics, utilizing all events experienced by the patient. This is the first time recurrent event survival analysis has been used in AF patients."
https://openalex.org/W2948250022,"Many computational theories have been developed to improve artificial phonetic classification performance from linguistic auditory streams. However, less attention has been given to psycholinguistic data and neurophysiological features recently found in cortical tissue. We focus on a context in which basic linguistic units-such as phonemes-are extracted and robustly classified by humans and other animals from complex acoustic streams in speech data. We are especially motivated by the fact that 8-month-old human infants can accomplish segmentation of words from fluent audio streams based exclusively on the statistical relationships between neighboring speech sounds without any kind of supervision. In this paper, we introduce a biologically inspired and fully unsupervised neurocomputational approach that incorporates key neurophysiological and anatomical cortical properties, including columnar organization, spontaneous micro-columnar formation, adaptation to contextual activations and Sparse Distributed Representations (SDRs) produced by means of partial N-Methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) depolarization. Its feature abstraction capabilities show promising phonetic invariance and generalization attributes. Our model improves the performance of a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier for monosyllabic, disyllabic and trisyllabic word classification tasks in the presence of environmental disturbances such as white noise, reverberation, and pitch and voice variations. Furthermore, our approach emphasizes potential self-organizing cortical principles achieving improvement without any kind of optimization guidance which could minimize hypothetical loss functions by means of-for example-backpropagation. Thus, our computational model outperforms multiresolution spectro-temporal auditory feature representations using only the statistical sequential structure immerse in the phonotactic rules of the input stream."
https://openalex.org/W2986403723,"Purpose We previously reported that inhibitory G protein (Gi) exerts intrinsic receptor-independent inhibitory activity upon adenylyl cyclase (AC) that regulates contractile force in rat ventricle. The two major subtypes of AC in the heart are AC5 and AC6. The aim of this study was to determine if this intrinsic Gi inhibition regulating contractile force is AC subtype selective. Methods Wild-type (WT), AC5 knockout (AC5KO) and AC6 knockout (AC6KO) mice were injected with pertussis toxin (PTX) to inactivate Gi or saline (control).Three days after injection, we evaluated the effect of simultaneous inhibition of phosphodiesterases (PDE) 3 and 4 with cilostamide and rolipram respectively upon in vivo and ex vivo left ventricular (LV) contractile function. Also, changes in the level of cAMP were measured in left ventricular homogenates and at the membrane surface in cardiomyocytes obtained from the same mouse strains expressing the cAMP sensor pmEPAC1 using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). Results Simultaneous PDE3 and PDE4 inhibition increased in vivo and ex vivo rate of LV contractility only in PTX-treated WT and AC5KO mice but not in saline-treated controls. Likewise, Simultaneous PDE3 and PDE4 inhibition elevated total cAMP levels in PTX-treated WT and AC5KO mice compared to saline-treated controls. In contrast, simultaneous PDE3 and PDE4 inhibition did not increase in vivo or ex vivo rate of LV contractility or cAMP levels in PTX-treated AC6KO mice compared to saline-treated controls. Using FRET analysis, an increase of cAMP level was detected at the membrane of cardiomyocytes after simultaneous PDE3 and PDE4 inhibition in WT and AC5KO but not AC6KO. These FRET data are consistent with the functional data indicating that AC6 activity and PTX inhibition of Gi is necessary for simultaneous inhibition of PDE3 and PDE4 to elicit an increase in contractility. Conclusions Together, these data suggest that AC6 is tightly regulated by intrinsic receptor-independent Gi activity, thus providing a mechanism for maintaining low basal cAMP levels in the functional compartment that regulates contractility."
https://openalex.org/W2948071756,"Previous studies have found that high social class individuals are more dishonest than low social class ones. However, the underlying mechanism of this phenomenon is still unclear. The ""ignoring negative consequences"" hypothesis suggests that belonging to a high social class makes individuals ignore the negative consequences of dishonesty, whereas the ""self-focused"" hypothesis suggests that belonging to a high social class makes individuals focus more on the self and self-interests. The present study aims to examine these two hypotheses by measuring participants' subjective social class, narcissism, fear of negative evaluation, and tendency to be dishonest. To this end, an online survey was conducted. Results provide evidence for the self-focused hypothesis by showing that subjective social class positively predicts the tendency to be dishonest, and narcissism plays a mediating role in this relationship."

Interestingly, of all of the known dynamins, even though some are enriched in the brain, neurolastin is the only known brain-specific family member. In this study, we demonstrate a novel and unexplored role of neurolastin in regulating mitochondrial structure. We show that neurolastin is imported into the mitochondrial intermembrane space (IMS) via its N terminus. Although at steady state neurolastin exhibits partial cytosolic, endosomal, and mitochondrial localization, it has increased translocation to the mitochondria upon induction of cellular stress and mitochondrial fragmentation in neuronal cells. The RING domain of neurolastin and the mitoprotease Lon1 regulate the localization and expression of neurolastin, respectively. Importantly, the neurolastin KO animals have fragmented mitochondria, indicating that neurolastin regulates mitochondrial morphology in the brain. At steady state, neurolastin showed both a partially diffuse distribution and a partial punctate localization representing its cytosolic and membrane-associated organellar forms, respectively. However, a catalytically inactive RING mutant of neurolastin (H97W) displayed a distinct mitochondrial localization in HeLa cells while being excluded from other organelles (6Lomash R.M. Gu X. Youle R.J. Lu W. Roche K.W. Neurolastin, a dynamin family GTPase, regulates excitatory synapses and spine density.Cell Rep. 2015; 12 (26212327): 743-75110.1016/j.celrep.2015.06.064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Although surprising, this was a robust phenotype, and thus we explored it in more detail. First, we mutated other critical residues of the RING domain (H97W, C83S, C103S, and C83S/C103S; Fig. 1A) and tested the mitochondrial localization of these mutants by measuring Mander's colocalization coefficient between neurolastin mutants and the mitochondrial marker, ATP5A (Fig. 1, B and D). The stability and expression of the mutants was tested biochemically, revealing similar levels of expression (Fig. S1, A and B). We found that a mutation in the RING domain leads to increased mitochondrial localization of neurolastin. Subsequently, we also mutated critical residues of the GTPase domain (R340Q, K205A/R340Q, and R340Q/D341N; Fig. 1A) and tested the mitochondrial localization of these mutants. The GTPase mutants showed a diffuse distribution and punctate localization similar to WT neurolastin (Fig. 1, C and E). These results confirm that inactivation of the RING domain leads to increased mitochondrial localization of neurolastin. To examine the mitochondrial presence of neurolastin in vivo, we generated knockin (KI) mice with an HA tag appended to the C terminus of neurolastin (Fig. 2A). The tag was added at the C terminus and not the N terminus based on the observation that neurolastin with an N-terminal tag has very weak expression (data not shown). The KI animals were generated to visualize endogenous neurolastin due to lack of a specific antibody. The precise insertion of HA at the correct location was confirmed by genotyping, sequencing, and Western blotting of the post-nuclear supernatant (PNS) and synaptosomal (P2) fraction (Fig. S2 and Fig. 2B). We subsequently characterized the protein’s expression in the KI and were able to determine that endogenous neurolastin is expressed in different brain regions upon Western blotting (Fig. 2C). We observed multiple species of neurolastin on a Western blot (around the expected molecular mass of ∼72 kDa). This was similar to our previous observations where more than one protein species around the expected molecular weight in the neurolastin KO animals was absent (6Lomash R.M. Gu X. Youle R.J. Lu W. Roche K.W. Neurolastin, a dynamin family GTPase, regulates excitatory synapses and spine density.Cell Rep. 2015; 12 (26212327): 743-75110.1016/j.celrep.2015.06.064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Although we do not know the identity of the two protein bands, they may represent the different isoforms of neurolastin. Subsequently, we tested the developmental profile of neurolastin using PNS isolated from the brain of different aged animals. As reported previously (5Pao P.C. Huang N.K. Liu Y.W. Yeh S.H. Lin S.T. Hsieh C.P. Huang A.M. Huang H.S. Tseng J.T. Chang W.C. Lee Y.C. A novel RING finger protein, Znf179, modulates cell cycle exit and neuronal differentiation of P19 embryonal carcinoma cells.Cell Death Differ. 2011; 18 (21566658): 1791-180410.1038/cdd.2011.52Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), we also observed that neurolastin’s expression is developmentally regulated. Interestingly, we noticed that neurolastin levels peak between 2 and 4 weeks of age, after which the expression decreased (Fig. 2, D and E). To identify the cell populations that express neurolastin, we performed immunohistochemistry from brains of KI animals but encountered technical limitations with the HA antibody. Thus, we performed immunohistochemistry on sagittal brain sections of neurolastin KO mice generated previously (6Lomash R.M. Gu X. Youle R.J. Lu W. Roche K.W. Neurolastin, a dynamin family GTPase, regulates excitatory synapses and spine density.Cell Rep. 2015; 12 (26212327): 743-75110.1016/j.celrep.2015.06.064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The neurolastin gene has been replaced with a LacZ reporter in the KO. Neurolastin expression patterns were visualized by fluorescence detection of a β-gal antibody. We observed neurolastin expression in neurons and some astrocyte populations, whereas no signal was detected in microglia (Fig. S3). We finally prepared an enriched mitochondria fraction from the brains of the KI animals (Fig. 2F). We tested mitochondrial enrichment by blotting for classical mitochondrial markers, Tim23, Tom20, and cytochrome c (CytC). In the same preparation, we detected endogenous neurolastin-HA, confirming its presence in brain mitochondria. Other organellar markers—transferrin receptor (TfR, an endocytic marker), GM130 (Golgi), and LAMP1 (lysosomal protein)—were not detected, although a slight ER contamination (protein-disulfide isomerase, PDI) was seen in the enriched mitochondrial fraction. Neurolastin is a multidomain protein containing a RING, GTPase, and predicted coiled-coil (CC) domain. We previously demonstrated that it has a hydrophobic patch (Hp), which mediates membrane association (6Lomash R.M. Gu X. Youle R.J. Lu W. Roche K.W. Neurolastin, a dynamin family GTPase, regulates excitatory synapses and spine density.Cell Rep. 2015; 12 (26212327): 743-75110.1016/j.celrep.2015.06.064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In addition to these defined domains, neurolastin has ∼70 aa at the N terminus and ∼100 aa at the C terminus that do not conform to any known motifs. To determine what region mediates mitochondrial targeting of neurolastin, we generated different deletion constructs. For visualization by immunofluorescence microscopy, a C-terminal HA tag was added to all of the constructs. The expression of different truncations was tested biochemically (Fig. S1C). While all of the constructs migrated at the expected molecular weight, variation in their expression level was observed, possibly due to varying stability of the truncations. We measured mitochondrial localization of different neurolastin truncations defined in the schematic (Fig. 3A): full-length (FL) (residues 1–654); N-terminal deletions ΔN (residues 71–654) and ΔN+ΔRING (residues 158–654); and C-terminal deletions ΔHp (residues 1–563), ΔHp+ΔCC (residues 1–448), N+RING (residues 1–158), and ΔRING chimera (residues 1–76 and 123–654). The data in Fig. 3 (B and C) are a measure of colocalization between C-terminal HA-tagged neurolastin and ATP5A. Compared with FL neurolastin, the C-terminal deletions (ΔHp, ΔHp+ΔCC, and N+RING) showed a similar level of colocalization, although the N-terminal deletions (ΔN and ΔN+ΔRING) had a significantly reduced mitochondrial localization. We observed a robust increase in mitochondrial localization of the ΔRING chimera in which only the RING domain is deleted, leaving the N terminus and the rest of the protein intact. The distinct mitochondrial localization of the ΔRING chimera, as well as the RING mutants, show that an active RING domain inhibits mitochondrial localization of neurolastin, although it does not completely exclude neurolastin from the mitochondria, as the WT protein shows significantly more mitochondrial localization compared with ΔN neurolastin. Reduced mitochondrial colocalization with both N-terminal deletion constructs suggests that the N terminus is important for mitochondrial targeting. Based on these observations, we tested whether the N terminus is vital by analyzing the localization of the neurolastin RING mutant. We truncated the N terminus in one of our tested RING mutants to generate C83S/C103S (ΔN). We also generated C-terminal deletions on the C83S/C103S background, tested expression of all of these constructs (Fig. S1D), and analyzed their localization (Fig. 3, D and E). As expected, neurolastin C83S/C103S (FL) showed significantly increased mitochondrial localization compared with WT protein, whereas neurolastin C83S/C103S (ΔN) failed to target to the mitochondria, confirming that the N terminus of neurolastin is essential for mitochondrial targeting. We also tested neurolastin C83S/C103S C-terminal deletion constructs and found that the localization phenotype is similar to that of neurolastin C83S/C103S (FL). A slight reduction in mitochondrial localization observed for neurolastin C83S/C103S (ΔHp and ΔHp+ΔCC) may be due to altered protein conformation in the deletion constructs. The transport of newly synthesized proteins into the mitochondria often depends on a mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS), generally located at the N termini of proteins (22Chacinska A. Koehler C.M. Milenkovic D. Lithgow T. Pfanner N. Importing mitochondrial proteins: machineries and mechanisms.Cell. 2009; 138 (19703392): 628-64410.1016/j.cell.2009.08.005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (986) Google Scholar, 23Schmidt O. Pfanner N. Meisinger C. Mitochondrial protein import: from proteomics to functional mechanisms.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11 (20729931): 655-66710.1038/nrm2959Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). When a protein is imported into the mitochondria, the MTS from the precursor protein is usually cleaved, resulting in a mature processed form. Upon analyzing the protein sequence of neurolastin, multiple bioinformatic tools predicted an N-terminal MTS in neurolastin with a high degree of confidence by comparing shared physicochemical properties between MTS of known proteins (Fig. 4A). These predictions prompted us to test whether neurolastin is imported into the mitochondria. We expressed neurolastin in HeLa cells and added oligomycin and antimycin A (O/A) to dissipate the mitochondrial membrane potential and block import and processing of precursor proteins. Under normal conditions, we observed two bands on an immunoblot of WT and RING mutant neurolastin, presumably the FL neurolastin protein and a smaller processed mitochondria-localized form (Fig. 4B). After O/A treatment, the processed form of neurolastin disappeared in cells expressing either neurolastin WT or the RING mutant. Neurolastin ΔN lacking the MTS was used as a control that migrated as a single molecular weight species and remained unaltered upon O/A treatment (Fig. 4B). The ratio of mitochondrially imported (processed) to cytosolic (preprotein) full-length protein was plotted and found to be significantly reduced for the mitochondrially targeted WT neurolastin and RING mutant upon O/A treatment, whereas ΔN levels were not changed (Fig. 4C). We also analyzed the localization of WT, RING mutant, and ΔN neurolastin upon O/A treatment by imaging individual cells and found a striking difference in the distribution of the RING mutant protein that changed from being mitochondrial to a completely diffuse distribution due to mitochondrial membrane potential disruption upon O/A treatment, confirming mitochondrial import (Fig. 4D). We noted a slight discrepancy between results from imaging and biochemical analysis of mitochondrial import possibly due to differences in the techniques employed. Using immunofluorescence microscopy, the neurolastin RING mutant showed much higher mitochondrial localization compared with WT protein, whereas the biochemical data did not show a significant difference, although the observed trend was similar to the immunofluorescence observations. We immunoprecipitated neurolastin overexpressed in HeLa cells and, using mass spectrometry analysis, identified Lon1 as a putative interacting partner of the RING mutant (data not shown). Lon1 is a highly conserved ATP-dependent mitoprotease that is imported into the mitochondrial matrix and is crucial for mitochondrial homeostasis (24Pinti M. Gibellini L. Nasi M. De Biasi S. Bortolotti C.A. Iannone A. Cossarizza A. Emerging role of Lon protease as a master regulator of mitochondrial functions.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2016; 1857 (27033304): 1300-130610.1016/j.bbabio.2016.03.025Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). To determine whether neurolastin is regulated by Lon1, we inhibited the protease activity by using the synthetic triterpenoid CDDO. We saw a significant increase in the expression of neurolastin WT and RING mutant protein, whereas no change was observed for the neurolastin ΔN mutant (Fig. 4, E and F). To test whether the N terminus of neurolastin is sufficient to target any cytosolic protein to the mitochondria, we tested localization of GFP fused to different lengths of the neurolastin MTS. We found that whereas GFP alone or 23-GFP had a diffuse distribution, both 38-GFP and 78-GFP showed mitochondrial localization (Fig. 4, G and H), confirming that the N terminus of neurolastin is a bona fide MTS. As neurolastin is imported into the mitochondria, we wanted to discern whether it is imported into the IMS or is present in the matrix. To determine the submitochondrial localization of neurolastin, we expressed the GFP-tagged RING mutant of neurolastin (C83S/C103S) and immunostained under different permeabilization conditions. GFP expression was seen in all conditions, and neurolastin (GFP) staining (in red) was observed both by digitonin and Triton X-100 permeabilization. This was similar to staining for CytC, an IMS marker, whereas the matrix protein, Hsp70, could be stained only using Triton X-100 permeabilization. No signal was detected in control cells without any permeabilization (Fig. 5, A and B). Subsequently, using stimulated emission depletion microscopy (STED), we showed that neurolastin colocalizes with the IMS proteins (CytC and OPA1) (Fig. 5, C and D). These observations confirm that neurolastin is imported into the mitochondrial IMS. Because neurolastin is primarily a brain-specific protein, we sought to validate our findings in cultured primary neurons. To confirm that neurolastin mutants show a similar localization to mitochondria in neurons, we co-expressed neurolastin-HA mutants and mito-GFP (to label mitochondria) in day in vitro (DIV) 10 hippocampal neurons and stained them at DIV 13 (Fig. 6A). Mitochondrial localization was measured by scoring colocalization in dendrites between the two markers (Fig. 6B). Similar to observations in HeLa cells, neurolastin WT and the GTPase mutant (R340Q/D341N) had comparable mitochondrial localization, whereas neurolastin RING mutant (C83S/C103S) and ΔN displayed a significant increase or decrease in mitochondrial localization, respectively. These data confirm that the RING domain and N terminus govern neurolastin’s mitochondrial localization in neurons as well. Imaging both in HeLa cells and neurons showed that neurolastin at steady state is partially localized to the mitochondria, whereas the inactivation of the RING domain leads to increased mitochondrial localization. We wanted to determine the physiological stimuli, such as synaptic activity, intracellular trafficking regulation, or mitochondrial disruption, that would produce a similar effect. To test this, we cultured hippocampal neurons from KI animals until DIV 16 to allow detectable expression of neurolastin and subsequently treated them with different compounds: (a) KCl, tetrodotoxin, bicuculine, and glutamate (used for regulation of synaptic activity); (b) inhibitors (leupeptin (lysosomes), okadaic acid (phosphatases), and MG132 (proteasomes)); and (c) antimycin A for depolarization of mitochondrial membranes. To determine the mitochondrial localization, we double-labeled with HA and Tom20 to detect endogenous neurolastin and mitochondria, respectively, and measured colocalization by quantifying Pearson's coefficient from the dendrites of neurons. We observed a significant increase in mitochondrial localization of neurolastin upon glutamate treatment (Fig. 7, A and B), which causes induction of cellular stress leading to mitochondrial fragmentation. We have previously demonstrated that neurolastin is a functional dynamin GTPase (6Lomash R.M. Gu X. Youle R.J. Lu W. Roche K.W. Neurolastin, a dynamin family GTPase, regulates excitatory synapses and spine density.Cell Rep. 2015; 12 (26212327): 743-75110.1016/j.celrep.2015.06.064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and now show that neurolastin is localized to the mitochondria. To examine the functional importance of neurolastin in vivo, we compared the mitochondrial structure between WT and neurolastin KO mice. We evaluated the mitochondria in sections from different brain regions. Whereas we observed mitochondrial alterations in both the hippocampus and cerebellum, we also noticed differences in the number of neuron"
https://openalex.org/W2986670765,"Kernel regression models have been used as non-parametric methods for fitting experimental data. However, due to their non-parametric nature, they belong to the so-called “black box” models, indicating that the relation between the input variables and the output, depending on the kernel selection, is unknown. In this paper we propose a new methodology to retrieve the relation between each input regressor variable and the output in a least squares support vector machine (LS-SVM) regression model. The method is based on oblique subspace projectors (ObSP), which allows to decouple the influence of input regressors on the output by including the undesired variables in the null space of the projection matrix. Such functional relations are represented by the nonlinear transformation of the input regressors, and their subspaces are estimated using appropriate kernel evaluations. We exploit the properties of ObSP in order to decompose the output of the obtained regression model as a sum of the partial nonlinear contributions and interaction effects of the input variables, we called this methodology Nonlinear ObSP (NObSP). We compare the performance of the proposed algorithm with the component selection and smooth operator (COSSO) for smoothing spline ANOVA models. We use as benchmark 2 toy examples and a real life regression model using the concrete strength dataset from the UCI machine learning repository. We showed that NObSP is able to outperform COSSO, producing stable estimations of the functional relations between the input regressors and the output, without the use of prior-knowledge. This methodology can be used in order to understand the functional relations between the inputs and the output in a regression model, retrieving the physical interpretation of the regression models."
