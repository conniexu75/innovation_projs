https://openalex.org/W2172134989,"Two types of P-glycoprotein have been found in mammals: the drug-transporting P-glycoproteins and a second type, unable to transport hydrophobic anticancer drugs. The latter is encoded by the human MDR3 (also called MDR2) and the mouse mdr2 genes, and its tissue distribution (bile canalicular membrane of hepatocytes, B cells, heart, and muscle) suggests a specialized metabolic function. We have generated mice homozygous for a disruption of the mdr2 gene. These mice develop a liver disease that appears to be caused by the complete inability of the liver to secrete phospholipid into the bile. Mice heterozygous for the disrupted allele had no detectable liver pathology, but half the level of phospholipid in bile. We conclude that the mdr2 P-glycoprotein has an essential role in the secretion of phosphatidylcholine into bile and hypothesize that it may be a phospholipid transport protein or phospholipid flippase."
https://openalex.org/W1551443142,"Significant activity of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) was detected in the membrane fractions, or in the immunoprecipitates prepared with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies, from rat adipocytes that had been incubated with insulin for 20 min. The PI 3-kinase activity in these preparations as well as in the whole cell lysates of adipocytes not treated with insulin was inhibited by the addition of wortmannin, a fungal metabolite, to the enzyme assay mixture. The inhibition was dependent on the inhibitor concentration with IC50 being less than 10 nM and perfect inhibition at 100 nM. The effect of insulin to induce membrane PI 3-kinase activity was mostly abolished, but its effects to tyrosine-phosphorylate the beta-subunit of the insulin receptor or other cellular substrate proteins including insulin-receptor-substrate-1 were not at all antagonized, by wortmannin added to the cell incubation medium. Insulin stimulation of cellular 2-deoxyglucose uptake and inhibition of isoproterenol-induced lipolysis observable in adipocytes under the same conditions were also antagonized by wortmannin added in the same concentration range as used for the inhibition of insulin-susceptible PI 3-kinase. It is concluded, therefore, that activation of wortmannin-sensitive PI 3-kinase plays a pivotal role in the intracellular signaling pathways arising from the insulin receptor autophosphorylation and leading to certain metabolic responses."
https://openalex.org/W1560482245,"Folic acid was covalently conjugated to 66-nm liposomes via spacers of various lengths in an attempt to target the liposomes to KB cells expressing folate receptors. Spacers of short and intermediate lengths were unable to mediate association of folate-conjugated liposomes with receptor-bearing cells, however, use of a 250 A polyethyleneglycol spacer (PEG, M(r) approximately 3350) permitted avid uptake of the liposomes at approximately 2.5 x 10(5) sites/cell. The binding of folate-PEG liposomes to KB cells could be competitively inhibited by excess free folate or by antiserum against the folate receptor, demonstrating the interaction is mediated by the cell surface folate-binding protein. Following binding, cell-associated folate-PEG liposomes were internalized by folate-receptor-mediated endocytosis at 37 degrees C but not at 4 degrees C. These folate-PEG liposomes show potential for delivering large quantities of low molecular weight compounds nondestructively into folate receptor-bearing cells."
https://openalex.org/W2143818366,"Vertebrate Hoxd genes are sequentially activated during the morphogenesis and pattern formation of the limb. Using the approach of gene disruption via homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells, we have assessed the function of the last gene of the complex, Hoxd-13. Mutant mice displayed skeletal alterations along all body axes suggesting the existence of a general multiaxial patterning system. In limbs, abnormalities such as a reduction in the length of some bony elements, loss of phalanges, bone fusions, and the presence of an extra element were observed. We propose that the mutation induces local heterochrony, as illustrated by an important retardation in limb morphogenesis. The relevance of these observations to our understanding of the development and evolution of the tetrapod limb is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1528368632,"Wortmannin, a fungal metabolite, inhibited 32P labeling of phosphatidylinositol trisphosphate, a product of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase), selectively in formyl peptide-stimulated 32P-loaded guinea pig neutrophils. The inhibition was of the same concentration dependence (with the half-maximal inhibition around 50 nM) as was observed for the simultaneous inhibition of formyl peptide-induced superoxide anion production. Wortmannin inhibited all three of the PI 3-kinase activities found in the cytosol fraction of guinea pig neutrophils, with a similar dose dependence (the half-maximal effects at 5 nM). Wortmannin was also effective on an immunologically purified preparation of the enzyme. The inhibition was of a noncompetitive type with regard to ATP and was observed consistently when PI, PI monophosphate, or PI bisphosphate was used as substrate. PI 4-kinase activity was not affected. It is concluded, therefore, that wortmannin abolished the formyl peptide-induced stimulation of neutrophils as a result of the inhibition of PI 3-kinase. An essential role of PI 3-kinase in receptor-mediated signaling in neutrophils thus evidenced with the use of wortmannin will be expanded to other cellular signaling systems."

https://openalex.org/W1613312511,"Sphingosine-1-phosphate, a metabolite of sphingolipids which has previously been shown to stimulate DNA synthesis and cell division in quiescent cultures of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts (Zhang, H., Desai, N. N., Olivera, A., Seki, T., Brooker, G., and Spiegel, S. (1991) J. Cell Biol. 114, 155-167), induced a transient increase in intracellular free calcium independent of extracellular calcium. The increase in calcium was completely abolished when intracellular calcium pools were depleted with thapsigargin, an inhibitor of the endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase. The dose-response for calcium release induced by sphingosine-1-phosphate correlated closely with the concentration required for stimulation of DNA synthesis. The magnitude of the calcium response decreased with successive challenges, although sphingosine-1-phosphate did not attenuate the responses to either bradykinin or ionomycin. Conversely, prior stimulation of the cells with bradykinin had no effect on the sphingosine-1-phosphate-induced calcium signal. Although sphingosine-1-phosphate increased inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate levels, complete inhibition of inositol phosphate formation by pretreatment with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate did not block sphingosine-1-phosphate-mediated calcium responses. Moreover, in permeabilized cells, heparin, an inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate antagonist, blocked Ca2+ release induced by inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate, but did not significantly alter the Ca2+ release induced by sphingosine-1-phosphate. Sphingosine-1-phosphate did not stimulate the release of arachidonic acid, another signaling molecule known to elevate [Ca2+]i without inositol lipid turnover or calcium influx. Our data suggest that sphingosine-1-phosphate mobilizes Ca2+ from internal stores primarily through a mechanism independent of inositol lipid hydrolysis and arachidonic acid release and that sphingolipid metabolism may be important in calcium homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W1632767742,"A transgene consisting of an upstream glucokinase (GK) promoter fragment linked to coding sequences of the human growth hormone gene was expressed in certain neuroendocrine cells of the pancreas, pituitary, brain, gut, thyroid, and lungs of mice. In pancreas, the transgene was expressed in a nonuniform manner among beta cells and in a variable but substantial fraction of the other islet cell types. In pituitary, it was expressed in corticotropes, and in brain, it was expressed in cells of the medial hypothalamus. Within the gut transgene expression was detected in a subset of enteroendocrine cells of the stomach and duodenal epithelium, some of which also exhibited glucagon-like polypeptide-1 immunoreactivity. In thyroid, transgene expression was observed in C cells of neonatal animals, whereas in the lung, it was expressed among rare endocrine cells of the bronchopulmonary mucosa. RNA polymerase chain reaction analysis of human growth hormone mRNA corroborated the tissue-specific transgene expression pattern. Prompted by the finding of transgene expression in specific neuroendocrine cells, we sought to determine whether GK mRNA and GK itself was also expressed in the brain and gut, tissues not previously associated with the expression of this enzyme. Using rat tissues, GK mRNA was detected by RNA polymerase chain reaction in both the brain and intestine and was localized to specific cells in the hypothalamus and enteric mucosa by in situ hybridization. A high Km glucose phosphorylating activity was detected from isolated rat jejunal enterocytes that displayed a chromatographic elution profile identical to hepatic GK. GK immunoreactivity was detected in cells of the medial hypothalamus with many of the same cells also displaying GLUT2 immunoreactivity. Together, these studies provide evidence for upstream GK promoter activity, GK mRNA, and GK itself in certain neuroendocrine cells outside the pancreatic islet and lead us to suggest that GK may play a broader role in glucose sensing by neuroendocrine cells than was thought previously."
https://openalex.org/W1604694310,"Following infection by the malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, human erythrocytes show increased permeability to a variety of low molecular weight solutes. In this study a number of anion transport blockers were identified as potent inhibitors of the transport of a wide range of solutes into human erythrocytes infected in vitro with P. falciparum. 5-Nitro-2-(3-phenyl-propylamino)benzoic acid (NPPB), furosemide, and niflumate blocked the malaria-induced transport of monovalent cations, neutral amino acids, sugars, nucleosides, and monovalent anions. For all of the substrates tested the order of potency of these three inhibitors was the same (NPPB > furosemide > niflumate) and dose-response curves for the effect of these inhibitors on malaria-induced choline transport were similar to those for malaria-induced thymidine transport. The data suggest that much, if not all, of the high capacity (non-saturable) transport of low molecular weight solutes into P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes is via a single type of pathway. The broad specificity of the pathway, its non-saturability in the physiological concentration range, and its failure to distinguish between stereoisomers (L- and D-alanine) are consistent with its being a type of pore or channel. For those substrates for which quantitative influx measurements were made the magnitude of the malaria-induced (inhibitor-sensitive) transport was in the order: Cl- > lactate > thymidine, adenosine > carnitine > choline > K+. The pathway is therefore anion-selective. The pharmacological and substrate-selectivity properties of the pathway show marked similarities to those of chloride channels in other cell types; this raises the possibility that the high capacity transport of small organic solutes may be an important and, as yet, largely unrecognized role for such channels in other tissues."
https://openalex.org/W1493327795,"In order to identify protein complexes consisting of the proteasome and specific proteasome regulators, crude soluble lysates of red blood cells were fractionated by gel filtration chromatography and by velocity sedimentation centrifugation. The fractionated lysates were then tested for the relative distribution of proteasome activity, proteasome protein, and protein of a known proteasome activator, PA28. At least two proteasome complexes containing PA28 were identified. One of these complexes had an apparent molecular weight of approximately 1,750,000, and appeared to have much more proteasome activity than could be accounted for by its relative concentrations of proteasome and PA28 protein. We hypothesized that this complex contained another activator of the proteasome, and we sought to purify this activator from extracts of red blood cells. A proteasome activator with an apparent molecular weight of approximately 700,000 was identified, purified, and characterized. This activator, termed PA700, greatly stimulated the peptidase activities of the proteasome in an ATP-dependent fashion. PA700 was composed of about 16 polypeptides ranging in molecular weight from 20,000 to 100,000. The ATP-dependent activation of the proteasome by PA700 was closely linked to the formation of a high molecular weight complex that required no additional ATP for activated proteolysis. These results indicate that PA700 is a regulatory protein of the proteasome and is a component of at least one high molecular weight proteasome-containing complex occurring in cell extracts."
https://openalex.org/W1479767677,"Recent genetic studies have linked the tyk2 gene, which encodes a novel type of non-receptor tyrosine kinase, to the interferon-alpha intracellular signaling pathway. In this report, biochemical evidence is presented which supports this proposed function for the tyk2 tyrosine kinase and further defines its role in the interferon-alpha signaling cascade. Specifically, the tyk2 gene is shown to encode a 135-kDa protein which is rapidly phosphorylated on tyrosine in response to interferon-alpha treatment. Indirect evidence suggests that the tyrosine phosphorylation of p135tyk2 is the result of autokinase activity, implying that the Tyk2 tyrosine kinase is activated by interferon-alpha treatment. Two complementary methods demonstrate a physical association between p135tyk2 and the alpha-subunit of the interferon-alpha receptor. First, immunoblots show that monoclonal antibodies against the alpha-subunit of the interferon-alpha receptor can co-immunoprecipitate p135tyk2. Second, interferon-alpha receptor proteins which have been labeled by affinity cross-linking with 125I-interferon-alpha 2 can be co-immunoprecipitated using anti-tyk2 antisera. Taken together, these data suggest that an interferon-alpha receptor-p135tyk2 complex functions, in a manner analogous to the CD4-lck tyrosine kinase complex, to initiate the interferon-alpha signaling cascade."
https://openalex.org/W1564230599,"Structural genes for small lanthionine-containing antimicrobial peptides, known as lantibiotics, encode N-terminal leader sequences which are not present in the mature peptide, but are cleaved off at some stage in the maturation process. Leader sequences of the different lantibiotics share a number of identical amino acid residues, but they are clearly different from sec-dependent protein export signal sequences. We studied the role of the leader sequence of the lantibiotic nisin, which is produced and secreted by Lactococcus lactis, by creating site-directed mutations at various positions in the leader peptide sequence. Mutations at Arg-1 and Ala-4, but not at the conserved Pro-2, strongly affected the processing of the leader sequence and resulted in the extracellular accumulation of a biologically inactive precursor peptide. Amino acid analysis and 1H NMR studies indicated that the precursor peptide with an Ala-4-->Asp mutation contained a modified nisin structural part with the (mutated) unmodified leader sequence still attached to it. The Ala-4-->Asp precursor peptide could be activated in vitro by enzymatic cleavage with trypsin, liberating nisin. These results confirmed that cleavage of the leader peptide is the last step in nisin maturation and is necessary to generate a biologically active peptide. Several mutations, i.e. Pro-2-->Gly,Pro-2-->Val, Asp-7-->Ala,Lys-9-->Leu,Ser-10-->Ala/Ser-12-->Ala and Val-11-->Asp/Val-13-->Glu in the leader peptide did not have any detectable effect on nisin production and secretion, although some of them affected highly conserved residues. When mutations were created in the -18 to -15 region of the nisin leader peptide (i.e. Phe-18-->Leu,Leu-16-->Lys,Asp-15-->Ala), no secretion or intracellular accumulation could be detected of nisin or its precursors. This suggested that these conserved residues are involved in the maturation process and may interact with lantibiotic-specific modifying enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1548696821,"The c-fos proto-oncogene transcript is one of the most labile mammalian mRNAs known. Rapid degradation of c-fos mRNA is mediated by both the c-fos protein-coding region and an AU-rich element in the 3‘-untranslated region. Here we present evidence that the c-fos coding region contains multiple destabilizing elements that can function independently to facilitate both deadenylation and decay of mRNA. The ability of these coding region destabilizing elements to direct deadenylation and decay requires the assembly of ribosomes at the 5‘ end of this domain and, most likely, translation of the message."
https://openalex.org/W1591414362,"To study the signal transduction mechanisms by which ultraviolet B (UVB) leads to increased prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) synthesis, human epidermal cultures were irradiated with 30 mJ/cm2 UVB and assayed for 6-h cumulative PGE2. Supernatants from irradiated cultures showed a 4-fold increase in PGE2 synthesis (113.6 +/- 26.8 pg/mg protein) when compared to supernatants from sham-irradiated cultures (25.6 +/- 3.9 pg/mg protein). Pretreatment of irradiated cultures with genistein (10 micrograms/ml) or tyrphostin-23 (50 microM), inhibitors of tyrosine kinases, blocked UVB-stimulated PGE2 synthesis. Treatment of nonirradiated cultures with epidermal growth factor (EGF), which acts through the receptor tyrosine kinase EGF-R, produced a 4-fold increase in PGE2 synthesis. However, addition of EGF to irradiated cultures did not further enhance their PGE2 synthesis, indicating irradiation rendered them refractory to EGF stimulation. In contrast, irradiated cultures could still significantly increase their PGE2 synthesis in response to the calcium ionophore A23187 or the protein kinase C activator 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, suggesting that the lack of response to EGF was selective. Furthermore, anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblot analysis revealed UVB-induced phosphorylation of tyrosine residues of EGF-R, an indicator of receptor activation. Phosphorylation was maximal 30-60 min after irradiation and was blocked by the tyrosine kinase inhibitors, genistein and tyrphostin. The antioxidant N-acetylcysteine decreased UVB-induced EGF-R tyrosine phosphorylation and PGE2 synthesis to near-basal levels. Conversely, treatment of unirradiated cultures with the potent oxidant tert-butyl-hydroperoxide (100 microM) increased both PGE2 synthesis and EGF-R phosphorylation. Collectively, these data suggest that antioxidant depletion induced by UV results in tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of the EGF-R. This activation may subsequently activate epidermal phospholipase at early time points after UVB exposure."
https://openalex.org/W1507410787,"Consumption of grains contaminated with Fusarium moniliforme (Sheldon) causes liver cancer in rats and has been correlated with esophageal cancer in humans. The causative agents are believed to be a family of compounds known as fumonisins, which bear remarkable structural resemblances to sphingosine and sphinganine, the long-chain (sphingoid) base backbones of sphingolipids. Recently, fumonisin B1 has been shown to block de novo synthesis of sphingolipids by inhibiting sphingosine (sphinganine) N-acyltransferase, which leads to accumulation of sphingoid bases. Because the exogenous addition of sphingosine and sphingosine 1-phosphate to Swiss 3T3 cells has been shown to stimulate DNA synthesis (Zhang, H., Buckley, N.E., Gibson, K., and Spiegel, S. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 76-81; Zhang, H., Desai, N.N., Olivera, A., Seki, T., Brooker, G., and Spiegel, S. (1991) J. Cell Biol. 114, 155-167), we hypothesized that fumonisins might stimulate DNA synthesis by disrupting sphingolipid metabolism. Fumonisin B1 caused accumulation of sphinganine and sphingosine in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts and, as occurred when these sphingoid bases were added exogenously, stimulated thymidine incorporation into DNA and augmented the mitogenic effect of insulin in a concentration-dependent manner. The mechanism underlying the mitogenic effect of fumonisin B1 was further investigated by using beta-fluoroalanine to block the initial step of sphingolipid biosynthesis catalyzed by serine palmitoyltransferase. beta-Fluoroalanine reduced sphingoid base accumulation in fumonisin B1-treated fibroblasts and inhibited fumonisin B1-stimulated DNA synthesis, but had no effect on mitogenesis when added alone. Fumonisin B1 did not cause accumulation of sphinganine 1-phosphate; therefore, it appears that sphingoid bases per se can stimulate DNA synthesis. To prove that the 1-phosphate is not obligatory, a 1-deoxysphinganine was synthesized, and it was as potent as sphinganine in stimulating DNA synthesis. These results establish that fumonisin B1 is mitogenic via accumulation of sphingoid bases rather than inhibition of complex sphingolipid biosynthesis per se. Because mitogens can often affect cell transformation, this provides a plausible molecular mechanism to explain the carcinogenicity of fumonisins."
https://openalex.org/W1965327935,"Glutamate receptors mediate excitatory neurotransmission in the brain and are important in the formation of memory and in some neurodegenerative disorders. A complementary DNA clone that encoded a 33-kilodalton protein (GR33) was obtained by screening a library with an antibody generated against glutamate binding proteins. The sequence of GR33 is identical to that of the recently reported presynaptic protein syntaxin. When GR33 was expressed in Xenopus oocytes, it formed glutamate-activated ion channels that are pharmacologically similar to those of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors but with different electrophysiological properties. Mutation of the leucine 278 residue in the single putative transmembrane segment of GR33 affects the properties of the channel. Thus, in vivo GR33 may be a presynaptic glutamate receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1598651148,"Dentin sialoprotein (DSP) is a 53-kDa protein isolated from rat dentin. It contains 29.6% carbohydrate (including 9% sialic acid) and has an overall composition similar to that of the bone sialoproteins osteopontin and bone sialoprotein (i.e. rich in Asp, Ser, Glu, and Gly). Using a monospecific anti-DSP polyclonal antibody to screen a rat incisor odontoblast cDNA library, a cDNA clone was isolated and sequenced. This approximately 750-base pair clone contained a DNA sequence corresponding to the NH2-terminal 9 amino acids of DSP. A second cDNA clone was isolated by using the first cDNA as a probe to rescreen the library. This second clone had the full-length DSP coding region. From the sequence, we deduced that the DSP cDNA coded for 366 amino acids, predominantly Asp, Ser, Glu, and Gly. The amino acid composition calculated for this sequence was very similar to that for purified DSP reported earlier; likewise the deduced molecular weight (53,045) was essentially identical to that determined by sedimentation equilibrium. Six potential N-linked glycosylation sites were present in the predicted DSP sequence. No Arg-Gly-Asp sequence was found, and the sequence for DSP was dissimilar to those of osteopontin and bone sialoprotein. Multiple transcripts near 4.6 and 1.5 kilobases were detected by Northern blot analysis in the incisor of 21-day-old rat and the tooth germ of the newborn rat. Consistent with previous immunohistochemical findings, no transcripts were detected in brain, salivary gland, heart, muscle, spleen, kidney, intestine, lung, liver, pancreas, tibia, calvaria, or osteoblast-like osteosarcoma (ROS 17/2.8) cells, indicating that DSP is specifically expressed by odontoblasts and related cells."
https://openalex.org/W1534123638,"Photosystem I functions as a light-driven plastocyanin-ferredoxin oxidoreductase in the photosynthetic membranes of cyanobacteria and chloroplasts. A mutant strain of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 that contains a deletion of the psaF gene and a transcriptionally inactive psaJ gene has assembled photosystem I complexes that lack PsaF, a lumenal protein and PsaJ, a 4-kDa hydrophobic protein. The cells of the mutant and wild type strains have similar rates of photosynthetic electron transfer and P700+ rereduction under linear and cyclic electron transfer conditions. Analysis of flash-induced absorption transients at 700 nm demonstrate that the absence of PsaF in purified mutant photosystem I did not affect the rate of P700 rereduction by cytochrome c553. Therefore, PsaF is not essential for docking of cytochrome c553. We also studied the organization of the proteins of mutant and wild type photosystem I by comparing their accessibility to digestion by thermolysin or to removal by 1 M NaI. The PsaA-PsaB subunits were more easily degraded by thermolysin in the mutant photosystem I. Thermolysin cleavage of PsaB yielded two major fragments that were immunoreactive with an antibody raised against the C terminus of PsaB. The N termini of these PsaB peptides mapped at Ile482 and Ile498 residues, thus identifying a surface-exposed domain of the core of photosystem I. The PsaE subunit could be removed by 1 M NaI and was rapidly digested by thermolysin in the mutant but not in the wild type photosystem I. Therefore, PsaF and PsaJ subunits of photosystem I have dispensable accessory roles in the function and organization of the complex."
https://openalex.org/W1672154570,"Abstract The Ras-related protein ADP-ribosylation factor 1 (ARF1) is a low molecular weight GTP binding protein, which in its GTP state supports the binding of coatomer, a cytosolic coat protein complex, to Golgi membranes. To create an active ARF, we constructed a point mutation in ARF1, Q71I, which was predicted to slow the rate of GTP hydrolysis. We demonstrate that Q71I, in contrast to wild type ARF1, exhibits a 2-3-fold increase in the half-life of ARF-GTP and is able to promote stable coatomer binding to Golgi membranes in the presence of GTP in vitro. Additionally, Q71I is able to support the binding of a significant amount of coatomer to membranes in the absence of added nucleotides, effectively bypassing the brefeldin A (BFA)-sensitive exchange activity. Furthermore, transfection of cells with Q71I, but not ARF1, renders the Golgi association of coatomer resistant to the effects of BFA in vivo. These observations provide compelling evidence that ARF1 is a necessary GTP binding protein that regulates the reversible binding of coat proteins to Golgi membranes and that the effects of BFA on this process in living cells must be a consequence of BFA's inhibition of guanine nucleotide exchange onto ARF1."
https://openalex.org/W1507877151,"In neuronal cells, microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) can be classified into two distinct groups. One consists of force-producing MAPs, the main components of which are kinesin and cytoplasmic dynein. The other is composed of fibrous MAPs, which include tau and MAP2. Many studies have been performed on the respective groups to understand their structures and functions. However, the problem of how the groups interact with each other on microtubules is still unresolved. To elucidate the interaction between kinesin or cytoplasmic dynein and tau or MAP2, we performed three experiments: competition, motility assay, and cosedimentation. To distinguish whether the binding competition is caused by steric hindrance of the projection domains of MAPs or by the competition of the binding sites on microtubules, we used microtubule binding domains of tau and MAP2 as well as native proteins. Our results revealed that kinesin or cytoplasmic dynein and tau or MAP2 complete for almost the same binding domains located on the carboxyl-terminal side of alpha- and the amino-terminal side of beta-tubulin from the site of subtilisin cleavage. Furthermore, the projection of tau, and probably of MAP2, might inhibit the binding of kinesin or cytoplasmic dynein to microtubules by steric hindrance. These findings will provide a useful step toward understanding the regulation system of intracellular organelle transport."
https://openalex.org/W1538605908,"Cellular receptors for blood proteases regulate chemotaxis, extracellular proteolysis, and growth behavior of normal and malignant cells. Binding of the coagulation protease factor Xa to leukocytes is contributed by a recently identified molecule, denominated Effector cell Protease Receptor-1 (EPR-1). Monoclonal antibodies were generated against EPR-1+ MOLT13 lymphocytes and selected for reactivity with lymphocyte surface proteins by flow cytometry and with affinity-purified EPR-1 in Western blots. Antibody-based functional cloning of the cDNA for EPR-1 reveals the sequence of a novel molecule encoded by a prominent 1.9-kilobase mRNA. The cDNA predicts a glycoprotein of 337 amino acids, characterized by a unique cysteine-rich extracellular module, a single membrane-spanning domain, and a serine-rich (26%) cytoplasmic tail featuring at least 15 potential phosphorylation sites. Genetically engineered EPR-1 transfectants were recognized by monoclonal antibodies to EPR-1 and bound 125I-factor Xa in a specific and saturable manner (Kd approximately 10-15 nM). In the absence of factor V/Va, EPR-1 transfectants promoted prothrombin activation in a factor Xa concentration-dependent reaction, inhibited by a monoclonal antibody to EPR-1. These findings define EPR-1 as a novel cell surface receptor for factor Xa potentially implicated in protease-dependent cellular effector functions."
https://openalex.org/W1553050604,"Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) stimulates migration and proliferation of vascular endothelial cells (EC). Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptors have an intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity involved in FGF-mediated proliferation, but the signal transduction pathway(s) responsible for movement is not known. We compared the role of signal-transducing G-proteins in migratory and proliferative responses of bovine aortic EC in vitro. Pertussis toxin, which ADP-ribosylates susceptible G-proteins, reduced bFGF-stimulated EC migration by 80%. The toxin did not block serum-stimulated movement, indicating that structural components required for motility were not impaired. The toxin did not inhibit bFGF-stimulated EC proliferation, showing that distinct intracellular signaling mechanisms are involved in the migratory and proliferative responses to bFGF. Three experimental approaches indicated that promigratory responses were due to release of arachidonic acid: (i) of the second messengers induced by G-protein-coupled effectors, only arachidonic acid over-came the pertussis toxin block, (ii) bFGF stimulated arachidonic acid release from EC in a pertussis toxin-sensitive manner, and (iii) phospholipase A2 inhibitors blocked the EC migration in response to bFGF. These data provide evidence that the migratory response of vascular EC to bFGF may be mediated by a G-protein-coupled phospholipase A2 activity."
https://openalex.org/W1576758515,"Cytosolically synthesized thylakoid lumen proteins are normally transported across the thylakoid membrane of chloroplasts as intermediate forms following cleavage of the full precursor polypeptides by a stromal peptidase. We have examined the mechanisms by which two lumenal proteins, the 33- and 23-kDa components of the oxygen-evolving complex, are translocated across the thylakoid membrane using an in vitro import assay and synthetic engineered intermediate forms of the two proteins as substrates. Efficient transport of the 23-kDa protein is observed in both the presence and absence of stromal extracts, but efficient import of the 33-kDa protein into thylakoids is completely dependent on the presence of stroma. The required stromal factor is heat-sensitive, macromolecular, and trypsin-sensitive. These findings thus represent the first evidence for the active participation of one or more stromal proteins in thylakoidal protein transport. We also show that import into thylakoids of the 33-kDa protein, but not of the 23-kDa protein, is absolutely dependent on the presence of nucleotide triphosphates. The data therefore indicate that at least two distinct mechanisms exist for the translocation of lumenal proteins across the thylakoid membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1527594904,"Abstract Limited chymotrypsin proteolysis of CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (CT; EC 2.7.7.15) produced several distinct fragments which were mapped to the N terminus of CT using antibodies directed against the N and C terminus and the conserved central domain. A time course of chymotrypsin proteolysis showed a progression in digestion as follows: 42-->39-->35-->30-->28-->26 kDa. The binding of CT and of the chymotrypsin fragments to lipid vesicles was assessed by floatation analysis. The ability of the fragments to bind to activating lipid vesicles correlated with the presence of a putative amphipathic alpha-helix, helix-1, between residues 236 and 293. Fragments lacking this helix could, however, bind to phosphatidylcholine/sphingosine vesicles, which inhibit CT activity, and were capable of dimer formation. The degree of resistance to chymotrypsin degradation increased when CT was bound to the strongly activating lipid vesicles phosphatidylcholine/oleic acid (1:1) and phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylglycerol (1:1). Conversion of the 39- and 35-kDa fragments, which contain the intact helix-1, to the 30-, 28-, and 26-kDa bands, which lack helix-1, required longer proteolysis times, suggesting that this helical domain is more shielded from solvent upon membrane binding. These results support the theory that CT has a bipartite tertiary structure composed of a globular N-terminal domain and an extended C-terminal domain and that CT interacts with membranes via its putative amphipathic helix which intercalates into the membrane bilayer of activating phospholipids."

Plasma membranes were labeled exogenously with [3H]cholesterol or [3H]zymosterol. Translocation of the labeled sterols to the rough ER was inferred from their conversion to [3H]cholesteryl esters and [3H]cholesterol, respectively. Progesterone inhibited both of these reactions by more than 90%. The concentration for half-maximal inhibition was 0.7 microgram/ml. Progesterone did not inhibit acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase activity itself, since the steroid had no effect on the esterification of [3H]cholesterol synthesized in vitro in the rough ER from [3H]zymosterol. Moreover, the small amount of [3H]cholesterol synthesized from plasma membrane [3H]zymosterol in progesterone-treated intact cells was esterified at the same fractional rate as cholesterol in control cells. Subcellular fractionation of cells pulse-labeled with [3H]cholesterol and treated with progesterone suggested that the block in plasma membrane cholesterol transfer to the rough ER occurred at the level of the plasma membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1490646790,"Phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)-P2) is the precursor of several second messenger molecules. In unstimulated cells PtdIns(4,5)P2 is hydrolyzed by a PtdIns(4,5)P2 5-phosphatase to form phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PtdIns(4)P) which is subsequently recycled to phosphatidylinositol. PtdIns(4,5)P2 5-phosphatase activity was detected in platelet cytosolic and particulate fractions. The platelet PtdIns(4,5)P2 5-phosphatase activity was magnesium but not calcium dependent. The elution profile of platelet cytosolic PtdIns(4,5)P2 5-phosphatase from anion exchange resins, exactly matched that of the 75-kDa inositol-polyphosphate 5-phosphatase (Ins(1,4,5)P3 5-phosphatase). The latter is a signal terminating enzyme responsible for the hydrolysis of inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3) to inositol (1,4)-bisphosphate (Mitchell, C.A., Connolly, T.M., and Majerus, P.W. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 8873-8877). Polyclonal antibodies raised against recombinant 75-kDa Ins(1,4,5)P3 5-phosphatase specifically immunoprecipitated all PtdIns-(4,5)P2 5-phosphatase activity from both the platelet membrane and cytosolic fractions. Purified 75-kDa Ins(1,4,5)P3 5-phosphatase hydrolyzed PtdIns(4,5)P2 forming PtdIns(4)P (Km = 250 microM). By contrast, purified membrane-associated 43-kDa Ins(1,4,5)P3 5-phosphatase did not hydrolyze PtdIns(4,5)P2. In the unstimulated platelet, recycling of PtdIns-(4,5)P2 to PtdIns(4)P is mediated by the 75-kDa Ins-(1,4,5)P3 5-phosphatase."
https://openalex.org/W1540059232,"B94 was originally described as a novel tumor necrosis factor-alpha-inducible primary response gene in endothelial cells which was also induced in an in vitro model of angiogenesis. To further characterize its expression, we cloned the mouse homologue and mapped its developmental and tissue specific expression. The predicted amino acid sequence of mouse B94 was found to be 83% similar to its human homologue. The gene was localized to mouse chromosome 12 just centromeric to the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus, in a region that is often rearranged in T-cell neoplasms. To explore the possibility that B94 is expressed during vasculogenesis and other developmental processes, the expression of its transcript was determined during mouse development by in situ hybridization. In 10-day embryos B94 was expressed prominently in the myocardium and in the aortic arch. By the 15th day of gestation, expression was restricted largely to the liver, the bone forming regions of the jaw, the aortic endothelium, and the nasopharynx: a pattern that was maintained until just prior to birth. Postnatally, expression shifted to the red pulp of the spleen and the thymic medulla. B94 expression was extinguished in most adult tissues but was detectable in lymphopoietic tissues including the spleen, tonsil, and lymphatic aggregates in the gut. Consistent with this was the finding that mononuclear progenitor cells in bone marrow and mature peripheral blood monocytes expressed B94. A truncated testis-specific transcript previously identified by Northern blot analysis was determined to result from the use of an alternate polyadenylation signal which was surprisingly located within the open reading frame. This shorter transcript was expressed at high levels exclusively in late stage spermatids. Immunostaining with an affinity-purified polyclonal antiserum revealed B94 to be localized to the acrosomal compartment of mature sperm. These studies demonstrate that B94 expression is tightly regulated during development and suggests distinct roles for B94 in myelopoiesis and spermatogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1488966816,"A conserved proline residue is found at position 331 in the CH2 domains of human IgG subclasses which fix complement. This residue is replaced by a serine in IgG4 which is inactive. To determine the role of residue 331 in the differential ability of human IgGs to activate the complement cascade, a pair of genetically engineered anti-dinitrophenol IgG1 and IgG4 antibodies with reciprocal mutations at position 331 were tested for their hemolytic activity as well as for their ability to bind C1q, activate C1 and cleave C4. The IgG1 Ser331 mutant was virtually unable to mediate the lysis of trinitrobenzene-sulfonic acid-derivatized sheep red blood cells as a result of a marked defect in C1q binding activity. In contrast, the substitution of Pro for Ser331 in IgG4 bestowed partial hemolytic activity (40%) to the IgG4 Pro331 variant. Under low ionic strength conditions, this mutant was found to be approximately 50 and 75% as active as wild-type IgG1 in the C1q binding and C4b deposition assays, respectively. These results indicate that residue Pro331, which folds into close proximity to a previously identified C1q binding motif (Duncan, A. R., and Winter, G. (1988) Nature 332, 738-740), contributes to the architecture of the IgG1 C1q binding site and that its replacement by a serine residue in IgG4 is largely responsible for the functional inactivity of this isotype."
https://openalex.org/W1625084039,"1,25-Dihydroxycholecalciferol (1,25-(OH)2-D3) increases membrane-associated protein kinase C (PKC) activity and immunoreactivity in renal epithelial (Madin Darby bovine kidney, MDBK) cells (Simboli-Campbell, M., Franks, D. J., and Welsh, J. E. (1992) Cell Signalling 4, 99-109). We have now characterized the effects of 1,25-(OH)2-D3 on the subcellular localization of three individual isozymes by immunofluorescence and immunoblotting. Although the total amount of PKC alpha, PKC beta, and PKC zeta are unaffected by 1,25-(OH)2-D3, this steroid hormone induces subcellular redistribution of both PKC alpha and PKC beta. Treatment with 1,25-(OH)2-D3 (100 nM, 24 h) enhances plasma membrane association of PKC alpha and induces translocation of PKC beta to the nuclear membrane. The effects of 1,25-(OH)2-D3 appear to be limited to the calcium-dependent PKC isozymes, since 1,25-(OH)2-D3 has no effect on the calcium independent isozyme, PKC zeta. In contrast to rapid transient PKC translocation seen in response to agents which interact with membrane receptors to induce phospholipid hydrolysis, modulation of PKC alpha and PKC beta is observed after 24 h treatment with 1,25-(OH)2-D3. In MDBK cells, the phorbol ester 12-0-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) (100 nM, 24 h) down-regulates PKC alpha and, to a lesser extent, PKC zeta, without altering their subcellular distribution. TPA also induces translocation of PKC beta to the nuclear membrane. MDBK cells treated with 1,25-(OH)2-D3, but not TPA, exhibit enhanced phosphorylation of endogenous nuclear proteins. In addition to the distinct effects of 1,25-(OH)2-D3 and TPA on PKC isozyme patterns, 1,25-(OH)2-D3 up-regulates both the vitamin D receptor and calbindin D-28K, whereas TPA down-regulates the expression of both proteins. These data support the involvement of PKC in the mechanism of action of 1,25-(OH)2-D3 and specifically implicate PKC beta in 1,25-(OH)2-D3-mediated nuclear events."
https://openalex.org/W1501423285,"Using recombinant baculovirus vectors, the three subunits of mouse rod photoreceptor cGMP phosphodiesterase (PDE) (alpha beta gamma 2) have been expressed in insect cells. The recombinant alpha,beta subunits accumulate to 5 mg/liter culture, but most (98%) of the expressed polypeptides are insoluble. In the soluble fraction, individually expressed alpha and beta subunits showed insignificant PDE activity, but coexpression (by coinfection) of alpha beta subunits elevated PDE activity 7-fold and coexpression of alpha beta gamma up to 15-fold. The soluble expressed holoenzyme associated with ROS membranes under isotonic, but not hypotonic, conditions. The Km of the soluble holoenzyme was 11-16 microM both for coexpressed alpha beta subunits and for alpha beta gamma subunits, similar to the Km (6-80 microM) of native PDE. Site-directed mutagenesis of cysteine to serine in the C-terminal CAAX box of both alpha and beta subunits substantially decreased the protein expression level, abolished post-translational isoprenylation, and prevented subunit binding to the rod outer segment (ROS) membranes. The mutant holoenzyme, however, showed a cGMP hydrolytic activity comparable with that of the normal recombinant enzyme. These results suggest that both alpha and beta subunits are required for the formation of a functional enzyme and that isoprenylation of the subunits is essential for membrane association and stability of PDE."
https://openalex.org/W1521214092,"The conformation of an Asn-linked glycopeptide in H2O was studied by two-dimensional 1H NMR. Nonexchangeable proton and exchangeable amide (NH) proton resonances were assigned for the hen ovomucoid glycopeptide 1, Ser-Ile-Glu-Phe-Gly-Thr-Asn Ile-Ser-Lys, with pentasaccharide Man alpha 1-3 (Man alpha 1-6)Man beta 1-4GlcNAc beta 1-4GlcNAc beta 1-NH attached to the Asn7 gamma-carboxamide. The pentasaccharide increases the local correlation times of amino acid residues near the N-glycosylation site. Nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) measurements on 1 and the corresponding Man3-GlcNAc2 pentasaccharide 3 show that the attached peptide does not perturb O-glycoside conformation. Sequential dNN (i, i + 1) NOEs in the Thr6-Ser9 region indicate populations of folded structure near the N-glycosylation site of both glycopeptide 1 and aglycosyl peptide 2. However, the Man3GlcNAc2 pentasaccharide does not dramatically affect the average conformation of either the peptide backbone or the Asn7 side chain. GlcNAc NH protons were studied at pH 3.0; and NOE and 3JNH data were used to constrain the glycopeptide's GlcNAc-1 side chain dihedral angle (tau) (C1-C2-N2-C7(Ac)). The glycopeptide's core GlcNAc-1 C2-N2 side chain bond is not flexible in H2O. A strong GlcNAc-1 NH2-H3 NOE, a medium strength NH2-H1 NOE, and a weak NH2-H2 interaction suggest that GlcNAc-1 has a rigid C2-N2 bond, with tau between 95 and 115 degrees. No evidence was found for intramolecular hydrogen bonds restricting this C2 side chain torsion. It may be that GlcNAc-1's rigid planar N-glycosidic linkage limits the conformational space available to the adjacent C2 acetamido side chain."
https://openalex.org/W1984168282,"Repetitive activation of excitatory synapses in the hippocampus produces a persistent enhancement of synaptic efficiency known as long-term potentiation (LTP). In anesthetized and in freely moving rats, the induction of LTP in the perforant path led to a transient increase in the amount of messenger RNA (mRNA) coding for a presynaptic glutamate receptor (GR33) in dentate granule cells. The amount of GR33 mRNA was increased for at least 5 hours after the induction of LTP but was indistinguishable from control values 1 day after induction. The N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist 2-aminophosphonovalerate prevented the induction of both LTP and the increase in GR33 mRNA. The amount of GR33 protein was increased in the mossy fiber terminal zone of dentate granule cells 5 hours after the induction of LTP. These results suggest that the induction of LTP in synapses at one stage in a neural network may lead to modification in synaptic function at the next stage in the network."
https://openalex.org/W1534823358,"A mutant cDNA of recombinant (r)-human protein C (PC) encoding a Leu5–>Gln substitution ([Leu5–>Gln]r-PC) has been constructed and expressed in human 293 cells. A subpopulation of molecules was then purified that contained fully gamma-carboxylated [Leu5–>Gln]r-PC. Intrinsic fluorescence quenching studies with this mutant protein revealed a C50 for Ca2+ binding (0.24 mM) that was essentially the same as that of wild-type (wt) r-PC (0.35 mM). Additionally, the C50 for the Ca2+ dependence of binding of a Ca(2+)-specific monoclonal antibody to [Leu5–>Gln]r-PC, of 5.4 mM-6.5 mM, was similar to that of wtr-PC (4.5 mM). On the other hand, the anticoagulant activity of the activated form of this mutant ([Leu5–>Gln]r-APC) was only 2% of that of activated wtr-PC (wtr-APC), and the inactivation rate of human factor Va catalyzed by this same mutant enzyme was approximately 10% of that of wtr-APC, at maximal levels of Ca2+. This substantial loss of activity was reconciled with the apparent retention of the integrity of the Ca(2+)-dependent conformation of this mutant by the finding that this Ca(2+)-dependent conformation of [Leu5–>Gln]r-PC interacted poorly with mixed (60:40, w/w) phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylserine (PL) vesicles. These results suggest that Leu5, a residue strictly conserved in vitamin K-dependent proteins, is required for functional binding of PC to PL vesicles. These findings lend support to recent observations that have shown the importance of hydrophobic interactions in the binding of coagulation factors to PL vesicles. This current work further implicates Leu5 as a possible key participant in this hydrophobic binding energy."

The bacterially expressed rbPRLR-ECD protein, contained within the refractile body pellet, was solubilized in 4.5 M urea, refolded, and purified on a Q-Sepharose column by stepwise elution with NaCl. The bioactive monomeric fraction was eluted in 0.05 M NaCl, yielding 15-20 mg/8 liters of induced culture. The purified protein was > 98% homogeneous, as shown by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence or absence of reducing agent and by chromatography on a Superdex column. Its molecular mass was 25 kDa as determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the absence of reducing agent and 22 kDa as determined by gel filtration. Binding experiments revealed remarkable differences between rabbit and porcine prolactins (PRLs) and the other tested lactogenic hormones. Gel filtration was used to determine the stoichiometry of the rbPRLR-ECD interaction with ovine, rabbit, and porcine PRLs, with human growth hormone and its truncated des-7 analogue, and with bovine placental lactogen (bPL) and des-13-bPL. The formation of only 1:1 complexes was indicated, except with bPL, for which a 2:1 complex was detected. Identical stoichiometry was also obtained using excess radiolabeled rbPRLR-ECD in gel filtration experiments. Interaction of 125I-labeled ovine PRL with rbPRLR-ECD secreted into conditioned medium by rbPRLR-ECD cDNA-transfected COS 7 cells also indicated formation of 1:1 molar complexes. Despite the differences in binding potency and stoichiometries of the interaction with rbPRLR-ECD, all seven tested hormones were biologically active in inducing PRL receptor-mediated casein synthesis in explants of rabbit mammary gland. We therefore propose that the formation of the 1:2 complexes with soluble rbPRLR-ECD is not predictive of biological activity of the different lactogenic hormones."

https://openalex.org/W1484933207,"Like amiloride, 6-iodoamiloride (6-IA) competitively and reversibly inhibits rotation of the Na(+)-driven flagellar motors of alkalophilic Bacillus cells. However, when 6-IA-treated cells are irradiated with UV light, motility is irreversibly inhibited. This treatment does not alter the membrane potential or affect Na(+)-coupled alpha-aminoisobutyrate transport. An increase in the Na+ concentration during UV irradiation substantially protects the motors from irreversible inhibition. Thus, photoactivated 6-IA seems to bind specifically and covalently at or around the Na(+)-interaction site of the force-generating units of the motors to inhibit motor rotation irreversibly. Rotation of each motor, which is monitored using tethered alkalophilic Bacillus cells, is also inhibited by photoactivated 6-IA. In this case, however, the rotation rate during UV irradiation decreases stepwise, suggesting the presence of several independently functioning force-generating units in a motor. From the data of 14 tethered cells, the number of units/motor is estimated to be 5-9."

In a triplex of this type, the second pyrimidine strand is in a parallel orientation to the purine strand and forms Hoogsteen base pairs with it via the major groove. We describe here the three-dimensional crystal structure determination of the antigen-binding fragment (Fab) from the murine monoclonal antibody Jel 318. Jel 318 is specific for triple-stranded DNA, with a preference for the sequence poly[d(T.m5C)].poly[d(G.A)].poly[(d(m5C+.T)]. The structure has been solved by the molecular replacement method and refined by molecular dynamics to an R value of 0.20 at a resolution of 2.8 A. The crystals have cell dimensions that are very similar to those of the previously determined structure of Fab Kol, but the Fab fragments pack within the unit cell in a completely different manner. The protein is in an extended conformation, with an elbow angle of 154 degrees. The shape and electrostatic surface potential of the antibody combining site suggest a possible model for the recognition of triplex DNA in which residues of CDR-H2 (where CDR represents complementarity-determining region) make specific contact with the DNA bases in the minor groove of the triplex."
https://openalex.org/W1547693430,"The heterotrimeric G proteins are often regarded functionally as a heterodimer, consisting of a guanine nucleotide-binding alpha subunit and a beta gamma subunit complex. Since the tightly associated beta gamma subunit complex can be separated only under denaturing conditions, studies aimed at determining the individual contributions of the beta and gamma subunits in terms of binding to the various alpha subunits, interacting with receptors, and regulating effectors, have not been possible. To circumvent this problem, we have used baculovirus-infected cells to direct the individual expression of the beta 1 and gamma 2 subunits. Application of extracts from baculovirus-infected cells to an alpha subunit of G protein (G(o) alpha)-affinity matrix resulted in the selective retention and AMF-specific elution of the expressed gamma 2 subunit, but not the expressed beta 1 subunit. Overall, these and other data provide the first evidence of a direct association between the gamma and alpha subunits, which is dependent on prenylation of gamma. The apparent direct association between the gamma and alpha subunits was further probed by limited trypsin proteolysis. Upon addition of trypsin, the G(o) alpha subunit was rapidly cleaved to a 24-kDa fragment. However, in the presence of the purified gamma 2 subunit, trypsin cleavage of the G(o) alpha subunit was completely prevented. This demonstration of a direct association between the gamma and alpha subunits is particularly intriguing in light of the increasingly large number of known alpha, beta, and gamma subunits, which raises important questions regarding the assembly of these subunits into functionally distinct G proteins. Thus, a direct association between the gamma and alpha subunits, which exhibit the greatest structural diversity, may provide the basis for the selective assembly of these subunits into G proteins with functional diversity."
https://openalex.org/W1555784054,"The human asialoglycoprotein receptor, an endocytic transport receptor of the basolateral surface of hepatocytes, is a hetero-oligomer of two homologous subunits H1 and H2. The cytoplasmic domain of H1 has been shown previously to contain a tyrosine-based signal for endocytosis and basolateral sorting. Here, we have investigated sorting determinants within subunit H2 and their contribution to the targeting of the hetero-oligomeric receptor complex. Despite extensive sequence homology, H2 expressed separately in fibroblast cells was endocytosed poorly, and mutation of phenylalanine 5 (corresponding to the critical tyrosine in H1) did not further reduce internalization. Consistent with this observation, ligand uptake by receptors composed of H1 lacking tyrosine 5 and H2 was inefficient. With respect to polarized transport in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, H2 could not be analyzed separately, because in the absence of H1 subunit H2 was completely degraded intracellularly. Coexpression of both subunits yielded ligand-binding receptors located specifically on the basolateral surface. The mutant H1(5A) (tyrosine 5 replaced by alanine) is approximately 55% apical in the absence of H2. In cells expressing H1(5A) together with H2, however, subunit H2 directed receptor complexes exclusively to the basolateral domain. Phenylalanine 5 is not essential for basolateral transport. Thus, whereas the endocytosis signal of the hetero-oligomeric asialoglycoprotein receptor resides exclusively in subunit H1, polarized transport to the basolateral domain of Madin-Darby canine kidney cells may involve two signals, only one of which is active for endocytosis."
https://openalex.org/W1583813946,Jel 72 is a murine monoclonal antibody that is highly specific for the right-handed DNA duplex formed by poly(dG).poly(dC). The three-dimensional structure of the antigen-binding fragment (Fab) of Jel 72 has been determined by x-ray crystallographic methods and refined to 2.7-A resolution. The structure has been determined using a combination of molecular replacement and multiple isomorphous replacement techniques. Crystals of Jel 72 contain two Fab fragments/asymmetric unit. The orientation of each of the four separate constant and variable domain pairs was determined from rotation function searches against appropriately oriented model Fab fragments. The rotated Fab domain pairs were placed within the unit cell using a phased translation search procedure with low resolution phases calculated from three derivatives. The two crystallographically independent Fab fragments possess elbow angles (relating the variable and constant domain pairs) that differ by 14 degrees (146 degrees versus 132 degrees). The shape and electrostatic surface potential of the combining site suggest a possible model for the recognition of double helical DNA. The model proposes that residues in the third hypervariable region of the heavy chain interact with the DNA bases via the major groove of poly(dG).poly(dC). This model may be applicable to the recognition of double-stranded DNA by autoimmune antibodies that occur in systemic lupus erythematosus.
https://openalex.org/W1605396922,"The present work examined the effects of chronic metabolic acidosis on the vacuolar proton-translocating adenosine triphosphatase (H(+)-ATPase) activity both in rat renal cortical homogenates and in their luminal membranes. Moreover, to assess the effect of acidosis on H+ transport by the apical H(+)-ATPase, we have developed a detergent-dilution procedure, resulting in the formation of sealed vesicles having this enzyme at their external surface. NH4Cl loading for 4 days had no effect on homogenates H(+)-ATPase activity, estimated with either N-ethylmaleimide or bafilomycin A1. In contrast, H(+)-ATPase activities were increased significantly by about 30% in both native apical membranes prepared by Ca2+ aggregation and detergent-treated luminal vesicles from acidotic animal. Kinetic analysis revealed that this stimulation was solely through changes in the Vmax for ATP. In membranes prepared by Mg2+ aggregation, acidosis also caused significant stimulation of the H(+)-ATPase activity. In addition, the initial rate of ATP-induced intravesicular acidification was 25% higher in reoriented H(+)-ATPase vesicles from acidotic rats, whereas passive proton permeability was identical in both groups. Finally, both vesicle enrichments and yields of luminal markers and de-enrichments and yields of intracellular membrane markers were identical in the two groups. These results provide enzymatic and functional evidence suggesting that chronic acidosis induces an adaptative change in the rat brush border H(+)-ATPase."
https://openalex.org/W1482428370,"Abstract Using gamma-32P-labeled 8-azidopurine nucleotide photoaffinity probes of GTP and ATP, the respective purine ring binding domain peptides of tubulin have been identified. First, the location of the GTP-specific binding site was shown to be on the beta-subunit, whereas the major ATP-specific binding site was on the alpha-subunit. Using a combination of anion-exclusion and immobilized Al3+ column chromatography, the respective photolabeled tryptic peptides of both nucleotide binding sites were isolated, further purified by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and sequenced. Chymotryptic peptides were also generated for the GTP binding site. High retention of the photoinserted radiolabel was observed with many of the peptides on reverse phase HPLC at low flow rates. The stability of the photoinserted radiolabel to HPLC varied with different peptides. However, certain peptides were easily distinguished as being within the base binding domains of the GTP and ATP binding sites of tubulin. Two beta-tubulin peptides containing the majority of photoinserted [gamma-32P]8-azidoguanosine 5'-triphosphate corresponded to N-terminal beta-tubulin amino acid residues 3EIVHIQAGQCGNQIGAK19 and 20FWEVISDEHGIDPTGS35.

https://openalex.org/W1541725736,"Retroviral insertional mutagenesis can both generate somatic cell mutants and pinpoint the genomic locus associated with a mutant phenotype. In the present study, this approach was applied to Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO) made susceptible to Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMuLV) infection by stable expression of an ecotropic retrovirus receptor. These CHO cells were infected with a replication incompetent MoMuLV construct with a promoterless hygromycin phosphotransferase (hygro) gene inserted into the U3 region of the long terminal repeat and a second selectable marker, neomycin phosphotransferase (neo), expressed from an internal promoter. CHO clones containing integrated proviruses were selected with hygromycin or G418, and the subset of these with reduced cell surface Neu5Ac were then selected with wheat germ agglutinin (WGA). The majority of the resulting clones had a phenotype not previously described for WGA-resistant CHO mutants arising spontaneously or from chemical mutagenesis: Neu5Ac was almost completely replaced by Neu5Gc. We have provisionally termed these clones SAP mutants, for sialic acid phenotype. Southern analysis of HindIII digested DNA from four SAP mutants revealed that the MoMuLV provirus is present in a 10.4-kilobase (kb) fragment. Probing with a flanking CHO sequence resulted in equivalent hybridization to a 4.6-kb fragment and the 10.4-kb provirus-containing fragment in all four cases, while uninfected parental cells and non-SAP glycosylation mutants generated in the same retrovirus insertional mutagenesis experiments yielded only the 4.6-kb fragment. Sequencing of the 3'-flanking DNA revealed that each of the four SAP mutants had a unique provirus integration site falling within a 796 bp region of the CHO genome. The frequency with which SAP mutants arise suggests that this may be a preferred site for retrovirus integration."
https://openalex.org/W1569598281,"Abstract The role of GTP-binding proteins in autophagic vacuole formation was investigated in isolated rat hepatocytes permeabilized by alpha-toxin from Staphylococcus aureus, an agent which creates stable plasma membrane channels allowing exchange of small (< or = 1000 Da) molecules. Vacuole formation was monitored from the uptake of 125I-tyramine-cellobiitol (125ITC) into osmotically sensitive vacuoles isolated on colloidal silica density gradients. Separation was based on an established observation that autophagic vacuoles are retained in a heavy midgradient band when samples are layered, but are selectively shifted to dense fractions when they are previously dispersed in the gradient material. The vacuolar uptake of 125ITC was concentration-dependent and required exogenous ATP: 94% was directly mediated by sequestration; 6% was acquired by fluid-phase endocytosis as monitored by [carboxyl-14C]dextran-carboxyl. Although the amino acid control of proteolysis was lost, addition of the nonhydrolyzable GTP analog GTP gamma S (as well as GMP-PNP) decreased fractional rates of direct vacuolar 125ITC uptake and long-lived proteolysis by similar amounts (1.02-1.03% h-1), substantiating the notion that the effects were the direct result of autophagic inhibition. These and associated findings, supported by quantitative electron microscopy, indicate the presence of ongoing macro- and microautophagy in alpha-toxin-permeabilized cells and suggest that one or more GTP-binding proteins is required in macroautophagic vacuole formation."
https://openalex.org/W1485567075,"Androgen is required for maintaining the differentiated state of prostatic epithelium, and that cell adhesion molecules play active roles in controlling the development of epithelial cells. However, little is known about the regulation of cell adhesion molecules during prostate development. In this study, we demonstrated that the expression of an epithelial cell adhesion molecule, C-CAM, in rat ventral prostatic epithelium are repressed by androgen. A similar regulatory pattern was also observed in the seminal vesicle but not in other androgen-dependent organs (the coagulating gland and the dorsolateral prostate), or other organs (the liver and kidney). These observations suggest that regulation of C-CAM expression by androgen is tissue-specific. Unlike the other androgen-repressed genes associated with apoptosis, which have transient expression patterns, the elevated level of C-CAM in the ventral prostate persisted for more than 30 days postcastration, suggesting that C-CAM belongs to a class of androgen-repressed genes which are not associated with apoptosis. Immunohistochemical study detected C-CAM on the apical surface of secretory epithelium in control rats; castration resulted in an altered localization of C-CAM expression from columnar epithelium to cuboidal basal epithelium. Taken together, the up-regulation and altered expression pattern of C-CAM in ventral prostatic epithelium by androgen deprivation may be associated with the enriched epithelial stem/amplifying cell population in degenerated ventral prostate. These observations suggest that C-CAM may play an active role in the process of prostatic epithelial differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1582536068,"The cardiac myosin heavy chain genes, alpha and beta, have been shown to change their patterns of expression rapidly and dramatically in response to a variety of stimuli. A major means of achieving these changes in gene expression is transcriptional control; however, the role of post-transcriptional regulation in cardiac myosin gene expression has not been investigated. We have identified two post-transcriptional events in rat alpha cardiac myosin heavy chain (alpha-MHC) gene expression and investigated their regulatory significance in different developmental and thyroid hormone states. The polyadenylation of alpha-MHC mRNA occurs at three different sites: 12, 18, and 23 bases downstream from a single polyadenylation signal. Hyperthyroid hearts did not demonstrate any change in the proportion of the three alpha-MHC mRNA subspecies. Hypothyroid hearts (which have a decreased amount of total alpha-MHC mRNA) showed a significant increase in the proportion of the longest subspecies and a decrease in the shortest subspecies. The second post-transcriptional event in alpha-MHC gene expression which was demonstrated was the inclusion or exclusion of a codon, CAG, encoding glutamine at position 1931, resulting from alternate splicing of the alpha-MHC transcript. The ratio of CAG+ and CAG- forms of mRNA in the adult euthyroid hearts is 40:60% which was unchanged in hypo- and hyperthyroid states. This is the first example of alternate splicing in a vertebrate sarcomeric myosin heavy chain gene. We conclude that the rat alpha-MHC gene transcript is post-transcriptionally modified."
https://openalex.org/W1928999079,"We have measured the ability of three TATA box promoters, adenovirus 2 major late (Ad 2 ML), Ad 2 ML with a point mutation in the TATA box, and mouse beta-globin, to support abortive and productive RNA synthesis in vitro. We have also measured the ability of these promoters to direct the assembly of preinitiation complexes using a nuclease protection assay. The relative strengths in productive transcription, determined from the synthesis of RNAs 10 nucleotides or longer, were 12:6:1 for Ad 2 ML, mouse beta-globin, and the TATA mutant of Ad 2 ML. However, the TATA mutant was reduced only 4-fold in its ability to assemble preinitiation complexes, compared to Ad 2 ML. Complexes formed on the Ad 2 ML TATA mutant may therefore also be reduced in their ability to initiate transcription. The mouse beta-globin promoter directed assembly and initiation as well as Ad 2 ML, but the beta-globin transcription complexes were less able to clear the promoter, resulting in an increase in aborted transcripts at the expense of productive RNA synthesis. We have thus shown that the transcriptional strength of eukaryotic promoters may be determined not only at the step of transcription complex assembly but also at the level of promoter clearance and possibly at transcription initiation as well."
https://openalex.org/W2160833147,"Blood coagulation factors IX and X are two serine proteases with a similar modular structure. The non-catalytic part of each protein consists of a gamma-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla)-containing module and two modules homologous to the epidermal growth factor (EGF) precursor. We have now found that the NH2-terminal EGF-like module of both factors IX and X inhibits factor Xa formation in a Gla-independent manner, both in the presence and absence of phospholipid and the cofactor, factor VIIIa. In contrast, the COOH-terminal EGF-like module has no such effect. Our data indicate that the NH2-terminal EGF-like module of factor IXa beta interacts either with the corresponding module or with the serine protease module in the substrate, factor X, without affecting the hydrolysis of low molecular weight substrates. Using antibodies as structural probes, we found that Ca2+ binding to the Gla module of factor IXa beta induces a conformational transition in the serine protease module. No evidence was found for a direct interaction between the Gla module and factor VIIIa. We therefore propose that the Gla module in factor IXa beta is indirectly involved in the cofactor interaction, in that Ca2+ binding to sites in this module induces a conformation in the serine protease module that is commensurate with factor VIIIa interaction. In addition, the immunochemical approach revealed a Gla-independent Ca2+ binding site in the serine protease module (apparent Kd of approximately 120 microM) that also might influence its conformation. Antibodies against the EGF-like modules of factor IX were used to probe Ca2+ binding to these modules in intact and in Gla-domainless factor IXa beta. The data indicate a Ca2+ binding site with an apparent Kd of approximately 50 microM in the NH2-terminal EGF-like module of both factor IX species."
https://openalex.org/W1582378812,"Mutants of rhodanese (EC 2.8.1.1) which substitute serine residues for each of the 4 cysteine residues have been studied to determine the roles of cysteines in the structure and function of the enzyme. The proteins compared in these studies were: the wild-type, C63S, C247S, C254S, C263S, C254S/C263S, and C63S/C254S/C263S. These current studies show that cysteine 247 is the only cysteine required for the activity of the enzyme. Although the other sulfhydryl groups do not participate in sulfur transfer, mutations of the noncatalytic cysteines result in the destabilization of the native structure of the enzyme. All the active proteins had similar kinetic parameters. Mutants substituting cysteine 254, compared with the other species, were: (a) more resistant than wild-type to inactivation by dithiothreitol, (b) more readily reactivated following oxidative inactivation, and (c) found to adopt conformations that show increased exposure of hydrophobic surfaces following removal of the transferable sulfur. On the other hand, cysteine to serine substitutions had very little effect on: (a) the rates of oxidative inactivation, (b) the increased fluorescence following the removal of transferable sulfur, or (c) the effectiveness of spontaneous refolding after urea denaturation. Forms of rhodanese that were formerly considered to be irreversibly oxidized can be reactivated if the protein is denatured in urea before reductants are used. It is proposed that these forms differ from reversibly oxidized states due to the inaccessibility of intramolecular disulfides to reductants and not to the formation of higher oxidation states of the protein."
https://openalex.org/W1504850172,"We have analyzed in greater detail the interaction of strand exchange protein 1 (Sep1) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae with DNA. The binding site size of Sep1 on single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) was determined to be 70 nucleotides per protein monomer using a fluorescence assay and 100 nucleotides using an exonuclease titration technique. The amount of Sep1 required for maximum aggregation of ssDNA was the amount needed to saturate the DNA. When double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) and ssDNA were both present, the duplex DNA was efficiently aggregated only at protein concentrations above that required for saturation of ssDNA. Strand exchange reactions with blunt-ended linear dsDNA and homologous ssDNA substrates required saturation of the ssDNA with Sep1 since free Sep1 is needed for exonuclease activity to initiate pairing with the dsDNA substrate. Preincubation of Sep1 with resected duplex DNA before adding ssDNA allowed joint molecule formation to occur at protein concentrations at least 10-fold below that required for saturation of the ssDNA. However, preincubation of Sep1 with ssDNA before the addition of resected duplex DNA required saturating amounts of Sep1 for joint molecule formation to occur. These results suggest that pairing requires Sep1 on both the ssDNA and the resected ends of the dsDNA."
