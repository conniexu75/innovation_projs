https://openalex.org/W2163327652,"Whole-genome bisulphite sequencing data from diverse human cell and tissue types shows that only about 22% of CpGs change their methylation state across these cell types; most of these CpGs are located at gene regulatory elements, particularly enhancers and transcription-factor-binding sites, and these selected regions with dynamic DNA methylation patterns could help to define putative regulatory elements further. The methylation of cytosine, usually at CpGs, is a common feature of epigenetic regulation of gene expression. Most cell types have relatively stable CpG dinucleotide methylation patterns and our understanding of which CpGs participate in genomic regulation is limited. Here, Meissner and colleagues analyse whole-genome bisulphite sequencing data sets across diverse human cell and tissue types and find that only about 22% of CpGs change their methylation state across these. Most of these CpGs are located at putative gene regulatory elements, particularly enhancers and transcription-factor-binding sites. In addition to further clarifying the distribution of DNA methylation, these selected regions with dynamic DNA methylation patterns could help guide more efficient genomic approaches to focus on informative regions, as well as help define regulatory elements. DNA methylation is a defining feature of mammalian cellular identity and is essential for normal development1,2. Most cell types, except germ cells and pre-implantation embryos3,4,5, display relatively stable DNA methylation patterns, with 70–80% of all CpGs being methylated6. Despite recent advances, we still have a limited understanding of when, where and how many CpGs participate in genomic regulation. Here we report the in-depth analysis of 42 whole-genome bisulphite sequencing data sets across 30 diverse human cell and tissue types. We observe dynamic regulation for only 21.8% of autosomal CpGs within a normal developmental context, most of which are distal to transcription start sites. These dynamic CpGs co-localize with gene regulatory elements, particularly enhancers and transcription-factor-binding sites, which allow identification of key lineage-specific regulators. In addition, differentially methylated regions (DMRs) often contain single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with cell-type-related diseases as determined by genome-wide association studies. The results also highlight the general inefficiency of whole-genome bisulphite sequencing, as 70–80% of the sequencing reads across these data sets provided little or no relevant information about CpG methylation. To demonstrate further the utility of our DMR set, we use it to classify unknown samples and identify representative signature regions that recapitulate major DNA methylation dynamics. In summary, although in theory every CpG can change its methylation state, our results suggest that only a fraction does so as part of coordinated regulatory programs. Therefore, our selected DMRs can serve as a starting point to guide new, more effective reduced representation approaches to capture the most informative fraction of CpGs, as well as further pinpoint putative regulatory elements."

https://openalex.org/W1989621138,"Animal behaviour arises from computations in neuronal circuits, but our understanding of these computations has been frustrated by the lack of detailed synaptic connection maps, or connectomes. For example, despite intensive investigations over half a century, the neuronal implementation of local motion detection in the insect visual system remains elusive. Here we develop a semi-automated pipeline using electron microscopy to reconstruct a connectome, containing 379 neurons and 8,637 chemical synaptic contacts, within the Drosophila optic medulla. By matching reconstructed neurons to examples from light microscopy, we assigned neurons to cell types and assembled a connectome of the repeating module of the medulla. Within this module, we identified cell types constituting a motion detection circuit, and showed that the connections onto individual motion-sensitive neurons in this circuit were consistent with their direction selectivity. Our results identify cellular targets for future functional investigations, and demonstrate that connectomes can provide key insights into neuronal computations. Reconstruction of a connectome within the fruitfly visual medulla, containing more than 300 neurons and over 8,000 chemical synapses, reveals a candidate motion detection circuit; such a circuit operates by combining displaced visual inputs, an operation consistent with correlation based motion detection. Three papers in this issue of Nature use the retina as a model for mapping neuronal circuits from the level of individual synaptic contacts to the long-range scale of dendritic interactions. Helmstaedter et al. used electron microscopy to map a mammalian retinal circuit of close to a thousand neurons. The work reveals a new type of retinal bipolar neuron and suggests functional mechanisms for known visual computations. The other two groups study the detection of visual motion in the Drosophila visual system — a classic neural computation model. Takemura et al. used semi-automated electron microscopy to reconstruct the basic connectome (8,637 chemical synapses among 379 neurons) of Drosophila's optic medulla. Their results reveal a candidate motion detection circuit with a wiring plan consistent with direction selectivity. Maisak et al. used calcium imaging to show that T4 and T5 neurons are divided into specific subpopulations responding to motion in four cardinal directions, and are specific to 'ON' versus 'OFF' edges, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W2062155132,"Quantum fluctuations of a laser are transferred onto the motion of a mechanical resonator and interfere with the fluctuations of the light reflected from the resonator, leading to ‘squeezed’ light with optical noise suppressed below the standard quantum limit. Light falling on a mechanical object exerts a small force that alters the object's motion — an effect that is studied in the field of optomechanics. The motion of the object itself exerts back-action on the light, resulting in 'squeezed' light with non-classical behaviour. Squeezed light with quantum fluctuations below that of the vacuum field was proposed nearly three decades ago as a means of beating the standard quantum limits in precision force measurements. Safavi-Naeini et al. demonstrate squeezed-light generation using continuous position measurement of a solid-state optomechanical system fabricated from a silicon microchip and composed of a micromechanical resonator coupled to a nanophotonic cavity. With further device improvements, on-chip squeezing at significant levels should be possible, making such integrated microscale devices ideal for precision metrology applications. Monitoring a mechanical object’s motion, even with the gentle touch of light, fundamentally alters its dynamics. The experimental manifestation of this basic principle of quantum mechanics, its link to the quantum nature of light and the extension of quantum measurement to the macroscopic realm have all received extensive attention over the past half-century1,2. The use of squeezed light, with quantum fluctuations below that of the vacuum field, was proposed nearly three decades ago3 as a means of reducing the optical read-out noise in precision force measurements. Conversely, it has also been proposed that a continuous measurement of a mirror’s position with light may itself give rise to squeezed light4,5. Such squeezed-light generation has recently been demonstrated in a system of ultracold gas-phase atoms6 whose centre-of-mass motion is analogous to the motion of a mirror. Here we describe the continuous position measurement of a solid-state, optomechanical system fabricated from a silicon microchip and comprising a micromechanical resonator coupled to a nanophotonic cavity. Laser light sent into the cavity is used to measure the fluctuations in the position of the mechanical resonator at a measurement rate comparable to its resonance frequency and greater than its thermal decoherence rate. Despite the mechanical resonator’s highly excited thermal state (104 phonons), we observe, through homodyne detection, squeezing of the reflected light’s fluctuation spectrum at a level 4.5 ± 0.2 per cent below that of vacuum noise over a bandwidth of a few megahertz around the mechanical resonance frequency of 28 megahertz. With further device improvements, on-chip squeezing at significant levels should be possible, making such integrated microscale devices well suited for precision metrology applications."
https://openalex.org/W2102935354,"The interplay of spin, energetics and delocalization of the electronic excitations are shown to create a spin blockade of electron–hole recombination in organic photovoltaic cells, resulting in high quantum efficiencies. State-of-the-art solar cells based on blends of organic semiconductors can show impressive performance characteristics — which is perhaps surprising, given the nature of the interactions that take place between the photogenerated electrons and holes, where recombination of the photogenerated charges might be expected to significantly reduce overall device efficiency. Akshay Rao et al. have looked in detail at this loss mechanism, and identify the key physical factors that can suppress electron–hole recombination in these materials. This mechanistic information should provide valuable guidance for the design of future high-performance organic optoelectronic systems. In biological complexes, cascade structures promote the spatial separation of photogenerated electrons and holes, preventing their recombination1. In contrast, the photogenerated excitons in organic photovoltaic cells are dissociated at a single donor–acceptor heterojunction formed within a de-mixed blend of the donor and acceptor semiconductors2. The nanoscale morphology and high charge densities give a high rate of electron–hole encounters, which should in principle result in the formation of spin-triplet excitons, as in organic light-emitting diodes3. Although organic photovoltaic cells would have poor quantum efficiencies if every encounter led to recombination, state-of-the-art examples nevertheless demonstrate near-unity quantum efficiency4. Here we show that this suppression of recombination arises through the interplay between spin, energetics and delocalization of electronic excitations in organic semiconductors. We use time-resolved spectroscopy to study a series of model high-efficiency polymer–fullerene systems in which the lowest-energy molecular triplet exciton (T1) for the polymer is lower in energy than the intermolecular charge transfer state. We observe the formation of T1 states following bimolecular recombination, indicating that encounters of spin-uncorrelated electrons and holes generate charge transfer states with both spin-singlet (1CT) and spin-triplet (3CT) characters. We show that the formation of triplet excitons can be the main loss mechanism in organic photovoltaic cells. But we also find that, even when energetically favoured, the relaxation of 3CT states to T1 states can be strongly suppressed by wavefunction delocalization, allowing for the dissociation of 3CT states back to free charges, thereby reducing recombination and enhancing device performance. Our results point towards new design rules both for photoconversion systems, enabling the suppression of electron–hole recombination, and for organic light-emitting diodes, avoiding the formation of triplet excitons and enhancing fluorescence efficiency."
https://openalex.org/W2128007785,"The bacterial type VI secretion system (T6SS) is a large multicomponent, dynamic macromolecular machine that has an important role in the ecology of many Gram-negative bacteria. T6SS is responsible for translocation of a wide range of toxic effector molecules, allowing predatory cells to kill both prokaryotic as well as eukaryotic prey cells. The T6SS organelle is functionally analogous to contractile tails of bacteriophages and is thought to attack cells by initially penetrating them with a trimeric protein complex called the VgrG spike. Neither the exact protein composition of the T6SS organelle nor the mechanisms of effector selection and delivery are known. Here we report that proteins from the PAAR (proline-alanine-alanine-arginine) repeat superfamily form a sharp conical extension on the VgrG spike, which is further involved in attaching effector domains to the spike. The crystal structures of two PAAR-repeat proteins bound to VgrG-like partners show that these proteins sharpen the tip of the T6SS spike complex. We demonstrate that PAAR proteins are essential for T6SS-mediated secretion and target cell killing by Vibrio cholerae and Acinetobacter baylyi. Our results indicate a new model of the T6SS organelle in which the VgrG-PAAR spike complex is decorated with multiple effectors that are delivered simultaneously into target cells in a single contraction-driven translocation event."
https://openalex.org/W2044463066,"The cyclic AMP (cAMP)-dependent catabolite repression effect in Escherichia coli is among the most intensely studied regulatory processes in biology. However, the physiological function(s) of cAMP signalling and its molecular triggers remain elusive. Here we use a quantitative physiological approach to show that cAMP signalling tightly coordinates the expression of catabolic proteins with biosynthetic and ribosomal proteins, in accordance with the cellular metabolic needs during exponential growth. The expression of carbon catabolic genes increased linearly with decreasing growth rates upon limitation of carbon influx, but decreased linearly with decreasing growth rate upon limitation of nitrogen or sulphur influx. In contrast, the expression of biosynthetic genes showed the opposite linear growth-rate dependence as the catabolic genes. A coarse-grained mathematical model provides a quantitative framework for understanding and predicting gene expression responses to catabolic and anabolic limitations. A scheme of integral feedback control featuring the inhibition of cAMP signalling by metabolic precursors is proposed and validated. These results reveal a key physiological role of cAMP-dependent catabolite repression: to ensure that proteomic resources are spent on distinct metabolic sectors as needed in different nutrient environments. Our findings underscore the power of quantitative physiology in unravelling the underlying functions of complex molecular signalling networks."

https://openalex.org/W2056724834,"The growth and reduction of Northern Hemisphere ice sheets over the past million years is dominated by an approximately 100,000-year periodicity and a sawtooth pattern (gradual growth and fast termination). Milankovitch theory proposes that summer insolation at high northern latitudes drives the glacial cycles, and statistical tests have demonstrated that the glacial cycles are indeed linked to eccentricity, obliquity and precession cycles. Yet insolation alone cannot explain the strong 100,000-year cycle, suggesting that internal climatic feedbacks may also be at work. Earlier conceptual models, for example, showed that glacial terminations are associated with the build-up of Northern Hemisphere 'excess ice', but the physical mechanisms underpinning the 100,000-year cycle remain unclear. Here we show, using comprehensive climate and ice-sheet models, that insolation and internal feedbacks between the climate, the ice sheets and the lithosphere-asthenosphere system explain the 100,000-year periodicity. The responses of equilibrium states of ice sheets to summer insolation show hysteresis, with the shape and position of the hysteresis loop playing a key part in determining the periodicities of glacial cycles. The hysteresis loop of the North American ice sheet is such that after inception of the ice sheet, its mass balance remains mostly positive through several precession cycles, whose amplitudes decrease towards an eccentricity minimum. The larger the ice sheet grows and extends towards lower latitudes, the smaller is the insolation required to make the mass balance negative. Therefore, once a large ice sheet is established, a moderate increase in insolation is sufficient to trigger a negative mass balance, leading to an almost complete retreat of the ice sheet within several thousand years. This fast retreat is governed mainly by rapid ablation due to the lowered surface elevation resulting from delayed isostatic rebound, which is the lithosphere-asthenosphere response. Carbon dioxide is involved, but is not determinative, in the evolution of the 100,000-year glacial cycles."

https://openalex.org/W1972616856,"The HeLa cell line was established in 1951 from cervical cancer cells taken from a patient, Henrietta Lacks. This was the first successful attempt to immortalize human-derived cells in vitro. The robust growth and unrestricted distribution of HeLa cells resulted in its broad adoption--both intentionally and through widespread cross-contamination--and for the past 60 years it has served a role analogous to that of a model organism. The cumulative impact of the HeLa cell line on research is demonstrated by its occurrence in more than 74,000 PubMed abstracts (approximately 0.3%). The genomic architecture of HeLa remains largely unexplored beyond its karyotype, partly because like many cancers, its extensive aneuploidy renders such analyses challenging. We carried out haplotype-resolved whole-genome sequencing of the HeLa CCL-2 strain, examined point- and indel-mutation variations, mapped copy-number variations and loss of heterozygosity regions, and phased variants across full chromosome arms. We also investigated variation and copy-number profiles for HeLa S3 and eight additional strains. We find that HeLa is relatively stable in terms of point variation, with few new mutations accumulating after early passaging. Haplotype resolution facilitated reconstruction of an amplified, highly rearranged region of chromosome 8q24.21 at which integration of the human papilloma virus type 18 (HPV-18) genome occurred and that is likely to be the event that initiated tumorigenesis. We combined these maps with RNA-seq and ENCODE Project data sets to phase the HeLa epigenome. This revealed strong, haplotype-specific activation of the proto-oncogene MYC by the integrated HPV-18 genome approximately 500 kilobases upstream, and enabled global analyses of the relationship between gene dosage and expression. These data provide an extensively phased, high-quality reference genome for past and future experiments relying on HeLa, and demonstrate the value of haplotype resolution for characterizing cancer genomes and epigenomes."
https://openalex.org/W2059721573,"Behavioural responses to temperature are critical for survival, and animals from insects to humans show strong preferences for specific temperatures. Preferred temperature selection promotes avoidance of adverse thermal environments in the short term and maintenance of optimal body temperatures over the long term, but its molecular and cellular basis is largely unknown. Recent studies have generated conflicting views of thermal preference in Drosophila, attributing importance to either internal or peripheral warmth sensors. Here we reconcile these views by showing that thermal preference is not a singular response, but involves multiple systems relevant in different contexts. We found previously that the transient receptor potential channel TRPA1 acts internally to control the slowly developing preference response of flies exposed to a shallow thermal gradient. We now find that the rapid response of flies exposed to a steep warmth gradient does not require TRPA1; rather, the gustatory receptor GR28B(D) drives this behaviour through peripheral thermosensors. Gustatory receptors are a large gene family, widely studied in insect gustation and olfaction, and are implicated in host-seeking by insect disease vectors, but have not previously been implicated in thermosensation. At the molecular level, GR28B(D) misexpression confers thermosensitivity upon diverse cell types, suggesting that it is a warmth sensor. These data reveal a new type of thermosensory molecule and uncover a functional distinction between peripheral and internal warmth sensors in this tiny ectotherm reminiscent of thermoregulatory systems in larger, endothermic animals. The use of multiple, distinct molecules to respond to a given temperature, as observed here, may facilitate independent tuning of an animal's distinct thermosensory responses."
https://openalex.org/W2045024225,"Wild waterfowl form the main reservoir of influenza A viruses, from which transmission occurs directly or indirectly to various secondary hosts, including humans. Direct avian-to-human transmission has been observed for viruses of subtypes A(H5N1), A(H7N2), A(H7N3), A(H7N7), A(H9N2) and A(H10N7) upon human exposure to poultry, but a lack of sustained human-to-human transmission has prevented these viruses from causing new pandemics. Recently, avian A(H7N9) viruses were transmitted to humans, causing severe respiratory disease and deaths in China. Because transmission via respiratory droplets and aerosols (hereafter referred to as airborne transmission) is the main route for efficient transmission between humans, it is important to gain an insight into airborne transmission of the A(H7N9) virus. Here we show that although the A/Anhui/1/2013 A(H7N9) virus harbours determinants associated with human adaptation and transmissibility between mammals, its airborne transmissibility in ferrets is limited, and it is intermediate between that of typical human and avian influenza viruses. Multiple A(H7N9) virus genetic variants were transmitted. Upon ferret passage, variants with higher avian receptor binding, higher pH of fusion, and lower thermostability were selected, potentially resulting in reduced transmissibility. This A(H7N9) virus outbreak highlights the need for increased understanding of the determinants of efficient airborne transmission of avian influenza viruses between mammals."

Following ingestion, the flukes locate to the biliary tree, where chronic infection frequently leads to cholangiocarcinoma (CCA). The mechanisms by which O. viverrini infection culminates in CCA remain unknown. An unexplored aspect is its influence on the host microbiome. In the hamster, infection with this pathogen reliably leads to CCA. Genomic DNAs of microbiota from colorectal contents and bile of hamsters and from whole O. viverrini were examined in this model of fluke-induced CCA. Microbial communities were characterized by high-throughput sequencing of variable regions 7–9 of prokaryotic 16S ribosomal DNA Of ~1 million sequences, 536,009 with useable reads were assignable to 29,776 operational taxonomy units (OTUs) and, in turn, to 20 phyla and 273 genera of Bacteria or Archaea. Microbial community analyses revealed that fluke infection perturbed the gastrointestinal tract microbiome, increasing Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae, and Lactobacillaceae, while decreasing Porphyromonadaceae, Erysipelotrichaceae, and Eubacteriaceae (P<0.05). More than 60 OTUs were detected in the biliary system, which confirmed bacteriobilia and a noteworthy community of microbes associated with the parasites. The fluke-associated microorganisms included potential pathogens from the Enterobacteriaceae and Listeriaceae and others, including Cyanobacteria and Deinococci, usually found in external environments. Given that opisthorchiasis is distinguished from other helminth infections by a robust inflammatory phenotype with conspicuously elevated IL-6, and that inflammation of the biliary system leads to periductal fibrosis, which is a precursor of CCA, the flukes and their microbiota may together drive this distinctive immune response.—Plieskatt, J.

https://openalex.org/W2013499563,"The telomeric DNA of vertebrates consists of d(TTAGGG)n tandem repeats, which can form quadruplex DNA structures in vitro and likely in vivo. Despite the fact that the G-rich telomeric DNA is susceptible to oxidation, few biochemical studies of base excision repair in telomeric DNA and quadruplex structures have been done. Here, we show that telomeric DNA containing thymine glycol (Tg), 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine (8-oxoG), guanidinohydantoin (Gh), or spiroiminodihydantoin (Sp) can form quadruplex DNA structures in vitro. We have tested the base excision activities of five mammalian DNA glycosylases (NEIL1, NEIL2, mNeil3, NTH1, and OGG1) on these lesion-containing quadruplex substrates and found that only mNeil3 had excision activity on Tg in quadruplex DNA and that the glycosylase exhibited a strong preference for Tg in the telomeric sequence context. Although Sp and Gh in quadruplex DNA were good substrates for mNeil3 and NEIL1, none of the glycosylases had activity on quadruplex DNA containing 8-oxoG. In addition, NEIL1 but not mNeil3 showed enhanced glycosylase activity on Gh in the telomeric sequence context. These data suggest that one role for Neil3 and NEIL1 is to repair DNA base damages in telomeres in vivo and that Neil3 and Neil1 may function in quadruplex-mediated cellular events, such as gene regulation via removal of damaged bases from quadruplex DNA."

https://openalex.org/W2049509539,"Mechanical interactions of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) with the environment play a significant role in controlling the diverse biological functions of these cells. Mechanical forces are transduced by integrins to the actin cytoskeleton that functions as a scaffold to switch mechanical signals into biochemical pathways. To explore the significance of cytoskeletal mechanisms in human MSC we modulated the actin cytoskeleton using the depolymerising drugs cytochalasin D (CytD) and latrunculin A (LatA), as well as the stabilizing drug jasplakinolide (Jasp) and examined the activation of the signalling molecules ERK and AKT during mechanical loading. All three drugs provoked significant changes in cell morphology and organisation of the cytoskeleton. Application of mechanical forces to β1-integrin receptors using magnetic beads without deformation of the cell shape induced a phosphorylation of ERK and AKT. Of the two drugs that inhibited the cytoskeletal polymerization, LatA completely blocked the activation of ERK and AKT due to mechanical forces, whereas CytD inhibited the activation of AKT but not of ERK. Activation of both signalling molecules by integrin loading was not affected due to cell treatment with the cytoskeleton stabilizing drug Jasp. To correlate the effects of the drugs on mechanically induced activation of AKT and ERK with parameters of MSC differentiation, we studied ALP activity as a marker for osteogenic differentiation and examined the uptake of fat droplets as marker for adipogenic differentiation in the presence of the drugs. All three drugs inhibited ALP activity of MSC in osteogenic differentiation medium. Adipogenic differentiation was enhanced by CytD and Jasp, but not by LatA. The results indicate that modulation of the cytoskeleton using perturbing drugs can differentially modify both mechanically induced signal transduction and MSC differentiation. In addition to activation of the signalling molecules ERK and AKT, other cytoskeletal mechanisms are involved in MSC differentiation."

A negative correlation between serum concentrations of parathyroid hormone and 25(OH)D3 suggested an overall normal physiological vitamin D response among the participants. The genes CD14 and thrombomodulin (THBD) are up-regulated primary vitamin D targets and showed to be suitable gene expression markers for vitamin D signaling in both primary tissues. However, in a ranking of the samples concerning their expected response to vitamin D only the top half showed a positive correlation between the changes of CD14 or THBD mRNA and serum 25(OH)D3 concentrations. Interestingly, this categorization allows unmasking a negative correlation between changes in serum concentrations of 25(OH)D3 and the inflammation marker interleukin 6. We propose the genes CD14 and THBD as transcriptomic biomarkers, from which the effects of a vitamin D3 supplementation can be evaluated. These biomarkers allow the classification of subjects into those, who might benefit from a vitamin D3 supplementation, and others who do not."

Significance: Novel amyloid-associated proteins can be identified in less tractable organisms and model systems, requiring no special genetic tools. Pathological aggregation of specific proteins is a hallmark of numerous neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer, Parkinson, and Huntington diseases. For each disease a particular protein (or peptide) is considered the primary aggregating species. In many cases these proteins assemble into amyloid fibers that accumulate into larger deposits that resist normal protein quality control mechanisms. Amyloid is a highly ordered and stable type of protein aggregate that can form in intra- and extracellular spaces and can recruit multiple associated proteins (e.g. components of protein quality control machinery) in addition to the core protein(s). The identification of associated proteins suggested a toxicity mechanism by which functional cellular components are titrated out of solution.

The accumulation of prion amyloid in yeast can be disadvantageous under standard growth conditions (7McGlinchey R.P. Kryndushkin D. Wickner R.B. Suicidal [PSI+] is a lethal yeast prion.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2011; 108: 5337-5341Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), but it is also proposed to be beneficial under certain stress conditions (8True H.L. Lindquist S.L.

Prion switching in response to environmental stress.PLoS Biol. 2008; 6: e294Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The capacity to adopt an amyloid conformation is inherent to many different polypeptide sequences, suggesting that the amyloid configuration is a generic, widely accessible structure of polypeptides (10Dobson C.M. Protein misfolding, evolution, and disease.Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 329-332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1700) Google Scholar). Amyloids share an unbranched filamentous morphology with a common cross-β-core structure composed of stacked β strands that lie perpendicular to the fiber axis, forming a continuous sheet over the length of the fiber (for review, see Ref. 11Tycko R. Molecular structure of amyloid fibrils. Insights from solid-state NMR.Q. Rev. Biophys. 2006; 39: 1-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Abundant interlocking hydrogen bonds between β-sheets within fibers, known as “steric zippers” (12Sawaya M.R. Sambashivan S. Nelson R. Ivanova M.I. Sievers S.A. Apostol M.I. Thompson M.J.

Proteins of very different origin and sequence, once they adopt an amyloid conformation, share these common properties, including resistance to proteolysis, chaotropic agents, mechanical breakage, and strong detergents (13Dong J.

Several high throughput genetic screens were previously utilized to uncover >20 amyloid-based prion or prion-like proteins in yeast (for review, see Refs. 5Liebman S.W. Chernoff Y.O.

Strategies for identifying new prions in yeast.Prion. 2011; 5: 263-268Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Genetic screening is powerful but is frequently limited to model systems or genetic reporters. Given the widespread existence of the prion phenomenon in S. cerevisiae and disease-associated aggregates in humans, there is a clear need for a multisystem approach to identify amyloid-forming proteins that does not rely on genetic manipulations. We found previously that SDS-resistant prion aggregates can be separated electrophoretically in agarose gels (in lieu of standard acrylamide gels) and then detected by immunostaining in a technique called SDD-AGE 3The abbreviations used are: SDD-AGE, semi-denaturing detergent agarose gel electrophoresis; htt, huntingtin; TAPI, technique for amyloid purification and identification; GuHCl, guanidine HCl.

This method works successfully with many amyloid and prion protein substrates (18Bagriantsev S.N. Kushnirov V.V. Liebman S.W.

However, one major drawback of SDD-AGE is it requires prior knowledge of the aggregating species for immunodetection. In this work we present a complimentary approach where the extreme detergent resistance and high molecular weight of amyloid aggregates are utilized to enrich them from cellular lysates. We also developed a new filtration scheme that enables the subsequent identification of these enriched proteins by mass spectrometry. We show this unbiased proteomic strategy can be used to identify core amyloid-forming proteins both in yeast and in mammalian cells as well as proteins that are strongly associated with amyloid.

Yeast cells were grown at 30 °C in standard rich yeast extract/peptone/dextrose or synthetic media containing 2% glucose as a carbon source. For overexpression of genes under the copper promoter, cells were cultured in synthetic media supplemented with 50 μm CuSO4. For prion curing, cells were grown on yeast extract/peptone/dextrose supplemented with 4 mm GuHCl for at least 60 generations. Imaging of live yeast cells expressing the appropriate GFP fusion proteins was performed on a Zeiss Pascal laser scanning confocal microscope equipped with a Plan-Apochromat 100×/1.4 oil objective (Carl Zeiss Inc.) and appropriate filters. The pinhole size was set at 0.6 μm. Image acquisition and analysis was carried out with LSM 5 software. 2% poly-l-lysine and 2% concanavalin A (Sigma) were used for coating glass slides (5 min at room temperature) to immobilize yeast cells. Yeast cells were grown in yeast extract/peptone/dextrose medium to A600 = 1 or 2. About 0.4 g of yeast pellet was used for the regular sample preparation. Cells were washed with cold TBS and disrupted with glass beads in 0.7 ml of buffer A (30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm DTT, 40 mm NaCl, 3 mm CaCl2, 3 mm MgCl2, 5% glycerol, Halt protease inhibitors mixture (Thermo Scientific), 20 mm N-ethylmaleimide (Sigma), 0.5 μl of Benzonase nuclease (250 units/ul)) for 3 min by vortexing. The lysates were spun for 10 min at 800 × g at 4 °C to remove unbroken cells and cell debris. The supernatant was placed in a separate tube and treated with 100 μg/ml RNase A for 30 min on ice followed by 1% Triton X-100 for 10 min on ice. The lysate was then spun at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C and loaded onto the top of 1 ml of a 40% sucrose pad in the centrifuge tube. The lysate was spun for 1 h at 200,000 × g to concentrate the amyloid material. The pellet was rigorously suspended in 200 μl of buffer B (TBS, pH 7.5, 2% SDS, 5 mm DTT, Halt protease inhibitors with EDTA) and incubated at 37 °C for 15–30 min. During incubation the solution was mixed by pipetting multiple times to resuspend partially insoluble proteins, resulting in a clear solution with few visible particles. The solution was spun at 16,000 g for 12 min; the supernatant was mixed with 0.05% bromphenol blue and loaded on the top of the acrylamide gel (Any kDaTM, Bio-Rad) for SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, small pieces of the acrylamide gel (2–3 mm) around the base of the wells were removed with a razor blade, combined in one tube, and frozen at −20 °C for 30 min or overnight. For elution of aggregates, the gel pieces were resuspended in buffer C (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.3% SDS, 5 mm DTT) by pipetting and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min followed by a short centrifugation and collection of the supernatant. This procedure was repeated three times to ensure good elution. The aggregates were pelleted for 1 h at 200,000 × g and resuspended in a minimal volume of water before electron microscopy and immunogold labeling. For identification of the trapped proteins, the same elution procedure was performed at 95 °C instead of 37 °C, which provided conditions for partial disruption of aggregates. Alternatively, more complete elution of proteins from gel pieces can be done by electroelution (Eluter 422, Bio-Rad) according to the instructions. However, the efficiency of the electroelution was often comparable with only the heating (95 °C) and simple resuspension procedure described above. After elution, the material was concentrated with a Spin-vac concentrator (Savant DNA 120, Thermo Scientific). For detection of the eluted proteins by immunostaining or Coomassie staining, the eluted material was subjected to SDS-PAGE. For mass spectrometry identification of the eluted proteins, the mixture was subsequently applied to the HiPPR Detergent Removal column and Zeba Desalting column (both from Thermo Scientific) to remove SDS and salts. The buffer was exchanged to 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.0. 0.1% RapiGest surfactant (Waters) was added to the purified mixture to help the following protease digestion. The sample was treated with 10 mm DTT for 5 min at 95 °C followed by 50 mm iodoacetamide for 30 min at room temperature. The sample was digested with Lys-C protease (Promega) for 3 h at 37 °C followed by trypsin (Promega) digestion for 16 h at 37 °C. The digestion reaction was stopped by the addition of 0.5% formic acid, incubated for 30 min at 37 °C to hydrolyze Rapigest, and spun 16,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was dried with the Spin-vac concentrator and sent for mass spectrometry identification. We used in-house one-dimensional reverse phase ultra performance liquid chromatography (Waters) coupled in-line with a Xevo G2 QT of mass spectrometer (Waters) and ProteinLynx Global Server (Waters) for protein identification or two different commercial services, Mass Spectrometry and Proteomics Facility at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine and the Keck Proteomics Center at Yale University. The Johns Hopkins services were performed with a Thermo LTQ ion trap MS interfaced with a two-dimensional nanoLC system (Eksigent), and the Keck services utilized a Thermo Scientific LTQ-Orbitrap XL mass spectrometer. Protein identification was performed with the Mascot algorithm (Version 2.4.0) with the following search parameters: peptide mass tolerance, 15 ppm; fragment mass tolerance, 0.6 Da; maximum number of missed cleavages, 1; variable modifications carbamidomethyl (C) and oxidation (M). The in-house MS was used for the initial method development, and the commercial services were used for the majority of samples to obtain consistent and reproducible results and for sample comparisons. The PC12 cells that model huntingtin (htt) aggregation expressing 74Q were previously described (29Wyttenbach A. Swartz J. Kita H. Thykjaer T. Carmichael J. Bradley J. Brown R. Maxwell M. Schapira A. Orntoft T.F. Kato K. Rubinsztein D.C. Polyglutamine expansions cause decreased CRE-mediated transcription and early gene expression changes prior to cell death in an inducible cell model of Huntington's disease.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 1829-1845Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were maintained in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin, 2 mm l-glutamine, 10% horse serum, 5% Tet-free fetal bovine serum, and 100 μg/ml G418 at 37 °C and 10% CO2. Induction of htt expression was done by incubating the cells in media containing 1 μg/ml doxycycline for 48 h. To prepare cell lysates for TAPI, five T75 flasks of PC12 cells with the induced expression of HttQ74-GFP were collected, washed with cold PBS, resuspended in 1 ml of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 2 mm EDTA, Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), 5% glycerol), and lysed by pipetting on ice for 15 min. Lysates were clarified by 300 × g spin for 5 min and incubated with 0.2 mg/ml RNase I, 60 units/ml DNase I, 10 mm MgCl2 for 30 min on ice. After the second spin (300 × g, 13 min) lysates were loaded onto the top of 1 ml of 40% sucrose pad in the centrifuge tube followed by the standard TAPI procedure described above. Agarose Gel Electrophoresis (SDD-AGE) of prion aggregates was performed as previously described (14Kryndushkin D.S. Alexandrov I.M. Ter-Avanesyan M.D. Kushnirov V.V.

Briefly, cell lysates were sedimented through a 30% sucrose pad (1 ml) in an SW55 rotor (Beckman) for 1 h at 45,000 rpm to enhance resolution of aggregates on the final picture. Recovered pellets were treated with 2% SDS for 10 min at 37 °C and separated by horizontal 1.8% agarose gel electrophoresis in Tris borate-EDTA buffer with 0.1% SDS. After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred from gels to Immobilon-P PVDF sheets (Millipore) overnight with a vacuum transfer unit (GE Healthcare) followed by immunostaining with anti-Sup35 antibodies. Filter retardation assay were performed as described previously (30Muchowski P.J. Schaffar G. Sittler A. Wanker E.E. Hayer-Hartl M.K. Hartl F.U. Hsp70 and hsp40 chaperones can inhibit self-assembly of polyglutamine proteins into amyloid-like fibrils.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7841-7846Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). Briefly, lysates of cells expressing HA-tagged yeast proteins for 5 h in SDGal were equalized, treated with 1% SDS for 10 min at room temperature, vacuum-blotted to cellulose acetate or PVDF membranes, washed with blotting buffer, and stained with an anti-HA antibody. As a modification of the method, SDS-treated cell lysates were loaded on acrylamide gel without boiling and subjected to SDS-PAGE under standard conditions. Resistant aggregates can be detected below loading wells at the start of the gel. Extracted protein samples were dispensed as 10-μl aliquots on carbon/Formvar-coated copper grids (Ted Pella Inc.) and incubated for 15–20 min. Samples were blotted off with absorbent paper and washed by adding 10 μl of water quickly to the grid surface. This was repeated with a second round of water. Next, the water was blotted off, and 10 μl of 2% uranyl acetate stain was added to the grid surface. After about 2 min the stain was blotted off, and the grid was air-dried. Images were collected using a Jeol JEM-1011 operating at 80 kV. The immuno-EM methodology was derived from Wischik et al. (31Wischik C.M. Novak M. Edwards P.C. Klug A. Tichelaar W. Crowther R.A.

Next, the grids were treated with 10 μl of blocking solution (2.5% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% cold fish gelatin) for 1 h. The blocking solution was blotted away, and then 10 μl of primary antibody in the same solution was added to the grid. After about 1 h, the primary antibody was removed, and the grid surface was washed 5 times with 10-μl aliquots of blocking solution. Secondary antibody in the same solution was dispensed to the grid and incubated for about 20 min. Finally, the grid surface was washed several times with blocking solution and then negative-stained with uranyl acetate as described above. Antibodies used in the study were as follows: polyclonal anti-Sup35 and anti-Rnq1 (in house); anti-GFP and anti-HA (3F10) (Roche Applied Science); polyclonal anti-Sis1 (a gift of Dr. Cyr, University of North Carolina); anti-TDP-43 (Proteintech) and anti-FUS (Bethyl). Strong anionic detergents like sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and sarkosyl are known for their ability to solubilize and destroy most protein-protein complexes, ultimately leading to protein denaturation. In contrast, our previous work established that interactions within yeast prion aggregates are strong enough to survive the treatment of 2% SDS at 37 °C (14Kryndushkin D.S. Alexandrov I.M. Ter-Avanesyan M.D. Kushnirov V.V. Yeast [PSI+] prion aggregates are formed by small Sup35 polymers fragmented by Hsp104.J. Biol.

We hypothesized that the biophysical properties of protein amyloid, such as its SDS resistance and large molecular weight would enable sufficient purification and enrichment from biological source material for identification by mass spectrometry. The details of our approach to isolate amyloid aggregates are illustrated in Fig. 1 and are explicitly outlined under “Experimental Procedures.” The essential steps are summarized here. After cell disruption, we reduced the complexity of the cellular lysates by extensive nuclease treatment and differential centrifugation (Fig. 1, Step 2). The centrifugation isolated prion aggregates, ribosomes, and other high molecular weight assemblies. To disrupt most of these complexes but not prion aggregates, the mixtures were thoroughly treated with 2% SDS at 37 °C (Fig. 1, Step 3). To separate resistant prion aggregates from the solubilized material, the suspensions were loaded on an acrylamide gel and subjected to electrophoresis. Although solubilized proteins migrated into the gels, the resistant prion aggregates were trapped at the start of the gels due to their large size (Fig. 1, Step 4). To evaluate how efficiently the prion aggregates could be trapped, we compared the isogenic yeast strain pair, where one strain has two prions ([PSI+] and [RNQ+], respectively, composed of amyloid f"
https://openalex.org/W1988943742,"Purpose Retinal vascular caliber has been linked with increased cardiovascular risk and is predictive of cardiovascular pathology, including stroke and coronary heart disease. Oxidative stress, as well as inflammatory mechanisms, plays a major role in the pathogenesis and progression of atherosclerosis, plaque rupture and vascular thrombotic propensity. The purpose of this study is to explore the relationship between retinal vascular calibers and biomarkers of oxidative stress and inflammation, in subjects free of cardiovascular pathology. Patients and Methods Cross-sectional analysis from a community-dwelling cohort comprising 1224 individuals aged 60 years and over, without a history of coronary or peripheral artery disease or stroke. Retinal vascular caliber was measured from fundus photographs using semi-automated standardized imaging software. Oxidative stress was evaluated using plasma superoxide dismutase 2 and glutathione peroxidase (GPx-3) activities, and inflammatory state was assessed using plasma high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and orosomucoid. Results In a multivariate model controlling for cardiovascular risk factors, larger retinal arteriolar caliber was independently related to higher level of GPx-3 activity (p = 0.003) whereas larger venular caliber was associated with higher levels of hsCRP (p = 0.0001) and orosomucoid (p = 0.01). Conclusion In the present study, biomarkers of oxidative stress regulation and inflammation were independently associated with retinal vascular calibers. This suggests that an assessment of retinal vessels may offer early and non-invasive detection of subclinical vascular pathology."
https://openalex.org/W2077676934,"Activation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) near sites of DNA breaks facilitates recruitment of DNA repair proteins and promotes chromatin relaxation in part through the action of chromatin-remodeling enzyme Amplified in Liver Cancer 1 (ALC1). Through proteomic analysis we find that ALC1 interacts after DNA damage with Tripartite Motif-containing 33 (TRIM33), a multifunctional protein implicated in transcriptional regulation, TGF-β signaling, and tumorigenesis. We demonstrate that TRIM33 is dynamically recruited to DNA damage sites in a PARP1- and ALC1-dependent manner. TRIM33-deficient cells show enhanced sensitivity to DNA damage and prolonged retention of ALC1 at sites of DNA breaks. Conversely, overexpression of TRIM33 alleviates the DNA repair defects conferred by ALC1 overexpression. Thus, TRIM33 plays a role in PARP-dependent DNA damage response and regulates ALC1 activity by promoting its timely removal from sites of DNA damage."

https://openalex.org/W2125712759,"Defective cardiac mechanical activity in diabetes results from alterations in intracellular Ca2+ handling, in part, due to increased oxidative stress. Beta-blockers demonstrate marked beneficial effects in heart dysfunction with scavenging free radicals and/or acting as an antioxidant. The aim of this study was to address how β-blocker timolol-treatment of diabetic rats exerts cardioprotection. Timolol-treatment (12-week), one-week following diabetes induction, prevented diabetes-induced depressed left ventricular basal contractile activity, prolonged cellular electrical activity, and attenuated the increase in isolated-cardiomyocyte size without hyperglycemic effect. Both in vivo and in vitro timolol-treatment of diabetic cardiomyocytes prevented the altered kinetic parameters of Ca2+ transients and reduced Ca2+ loading of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), basal intracellular free Ca2+ and Zn2+ ([Ca2+]i and [Zn2+]i), and spatio-temporal properties of the Ca2+ sparks, significantly. Timolol also antagonized hyperphosphorylation of cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR2), and significantly restored depleted protein levels of both RyR2 and calstabin2. Western blot analysis demonstrated that timolol-treatment also significantly normalized depressed levels of some [Ca2+]i-handling regulators, such as Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX) and phospho-phospholamban (pPLN) to PLN ratio. Incubation of diabetic cardiomyocytes with 4-mM glutathione exerted similar beneficial effects on RyR2-macromolecular complex and basal levels of both [Ca2+]i and [Zn2+]i, increased intracellular Zn2+ hyperphosphorylated RyR2 in a concentration-dependent manner. Timolol also led to a balanced oxidant/antioxidant level in both heart and circulation and prevented altered cellular redox state of the heart. We thus report, for the first time, that the preventing effect of timolol, directly targeting heart, seems to be associated with a normalization of macromolecular complex of RyR2 and some Ca2+ handling regulators, and prevention of Ca2+ leak, and thereby normalization of both [Ca2+]i and [Zn2+]i homeostasis in diabetic rat heart, at least in part by controlling the cellular redox status of hyperglycemic cardiomyocytes."

These substructures, called nanoclusters, were proposed to be crucial for high-fidelity signal transmission in cells. However, the molecular basis of Ras nanoclustering is poorly understood. In this work, we used coarse-grained (CG) molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the molecular mechanism by which full-length H-ras proteins form nanoclusters in a model membrane. We chose two different conformations of H-ras that were proposed to represent the active and inactive state of the protein, and a domain-forming model bilayer made up of di16:0-PC (DPPC), di18:2-PC (DLiPC) and cholesterol. We found that, irrespective of the initial conformation, Ras molecules assembled into a single large aggregate. However, the two binding modes, which are characterized by the different orientation of the G-domain with respect to the membrane, differ in dynamics and organization during and after aggregation. Some of these differences involve regions of Ras that are important for effector/modulator binding, which may partly explain observed differences in the ability of active and inactive H-ras nanoclusters to recruit effectors. The simulations also revealed some limitations in the CG force field to study protein assembly in solution, which we discuss in the context of proposed potential avenues of improvement."
https://openalex.org/W2049949265,"c-Src kinase activity is regulated by phosphorylation of Y527 and Y416. Y527 phosphorylation stabilizes a closed conformation, which suppresses kinase activity towards substrates, whereas phosphorylation at Y416 promotes an elevated kinase activity by stabilizing the activation loop in a manner permissive for substrate binding. Here we investigated the correlation of Y416 phosphorylation with c-Src activity when c-Src was locked into the open and closed conformations (by mutations Y527F and Q528E, P529E, G530I respectively). Consistent with prior findings, we found Y416 to be more greatly phosphorylated when c-Src was in an open, active conformation. However, we also observed an appreciable amount of Y416 was phosphorylated when c-Src was in a closed, repressed conformation under conditions by which c-Src was unable to phosphorylate substrate STAT3. The phosphorylation of Y416 in the closed conformation arose by autophosphorylation, since abolishing kinase activity by mutating the ATP binding site (K295M) prevented phosphorylation. Basal Y416 phosphorylation correlated positively with cellular levels of c-Src suggesting autophosphorylation depended on self-association. Using sedimentation velocity analysis on cell lysate with fluorescence detection optics, we confirmed that c-Src forms monomers and dimers, with the open conformation also forming a minor population of larger mass complexes. Collectively, our studies suggest a model by which dimerization of c-Src primes c-Src via Y416 phosphorylation to enable rapid potentiation of activity when Src adopts an open conformation. Once in the open conformation, c-Src can amplify the response by recruiting and phosphorylating substrates such as STAT3 and increasing the extent of autophosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W2074584135,"Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is recognized as an important angiogenic factor that promotes angiogenesis in a series of pathological conditions, including cancer, inflammation, and ischemic disorders. We have recently shown that the inflammatory transcription factor SAF-1 is, at least in part, responsible for the marked increase of VEGF levels in breast cancer. Here, we show that SAF-1-mediated induction of VEGF is repressed by KLF-4 transcription factor. KLF-4 is abundantly present in normal breast epithelial cells, but its level is considerably reduced in breast cancer cells and clinical cancer tissues. In the human VEGF promoter, SAF-1- and KLF-4-binding elements are overlapping, whereas SAF-1 induces and KLF-4 suppresses VEGF expression. Ectopic overexpression of KLF-4 and RNAi-mediated inhibition of endogenous KLF-4 supported the role of KLF-4 as a transcriptional repressor of VEGF and an inhibitor of angiogenesis in breast cancer cells. We show that KLF-4 recruits histone deacetylases (HDACs) -2 and -3 at the VEGF promoter. Chronological ChIP assays demonstrated the occupancy of KLF-4, HDAC2, and HDAC3 in the VEGF promoter in normal MCF-10A cells but not in MDA-MB-231 cancer cells. Co-transfection of KLF-4 and HDAC expression plasmids in breast cancer cells results in synergistic repression of VEGF expression and inhibition of angiogenic potential of these carcinoma cells. Together these results identify a new mechanism of VEGF up-regulation in cancer that involves concomitant loss of KLF-4-HDAC-mediated transcriptional repression and active recruitment of SAF-1-mediated transcriptional activation."
https://openalex.org/W1994587434,"Objective To compare the prevalence of an incomplete circle of Willis in patients with migraine with aura, migraine without aura, and control subjects, and correlate circle of Willis variations with alterations in cerebral perfusion. Methods Migraine with aura, migraine without aura, and control subjects were prospectively enrolled in a 1∶1∶1 ratio. Magnetic resonance angiography was performed to examine circle of Willis anatomy and arterial spin labeled perfusion magnetic resonance imaging to measure cerebral blood flow. A standardized template rating system was used to categorize circle of Willis variants. The primary pre-specified outcome measure was the frequency of an incomplete circle of Willis. The association between circle of Willis variations and cerebral blood flow was also analyzed. Results 170 subjects were enrolled (56 migraine with aura, 61 migraine without aura, 53 controls). An incomplete circle of Willis was significantly more common in the migraine with aura compared to control group (73% vs. 51%, p = 0.02), with a similar trend for the migraine without aura group (67% vs. 51%, p = 0.08). Using a quantitative score of the burden of circle of Willis variants, migraine with aura subjects had a higher burden of variants than controls (p = 0.02). Compared to those with a complete circle, subjects with an incomplete circle had greater asymmetry in hemispheric cerebral blood flow (p = 0.05). Specific posterior cerebral artery variants were associated with greater asymmetries of blood flow in the posterior cerebral artery territory. Conclusions An incomplete circle of Willis is more common in migraine with aura subjects than controls, and is associated with alterations in cerebral blood flow."
https://openalex.org/W2003276545,"Long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons are the major class I mobile elements in plants. They play crucial roles in gene expansion, diversification and evolution. However, their captured genes are yet to be genome-widely identified and characterized in most of plants although many genomes have been completely sequenced. In this study, we have identified 7,043 and 23,915 full-length LTR retrotransposons in the rice and sorghum genomes, respectively. High percentages of rice full-length LTR retrotransposons were distributed near centromeric region in each of the chromosomes. In contrast, sorghum full-length LTR retrotransposons were not enriched in centromere regions. This dissimilarity could be due to the discrepant retrotransposition during and after divergence from their common ancestor thus might be contributing to species divergence. A total of 672 and 1,343 genes have been captured by these elements in rice and sorghum, respectively. Gene Ontology (GO) and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) showed that no over-represented GO term was identified in LTR captured rice genes. For LTR captured sorghum genes, GO terms with functions in DNA/RNA metabolism and chromatin organization were over-represented. Only 36% of LTR captured rice genes were expressed and expression divergence was estimated as 11.9%. Higher percentage of LTR captured rice genes have evolved into pseudogenes under neutral selection. On the contrary, higher percentage of LTR captured sorghum genes were under purifying selection and 72.4% of them were expressed. Thus, higher percentage of LTR captured sorghum genes was functional. Small RNA analysis suggested that some of LTR captured genes in rice and sorghum might have been involved in negative regulation. On the other hand, positive selection has been observed in both rice and sorghum LTR captured genes and some of them were still expressed and functional. The data suggest that some of these LTR captured genes might have evolved into new gene functions."

Serratia marcescens type I fimbriae-dependent biofilms are coordinated by the adenylate cyclase, CyaA, and the cyclic 3′,5′-adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-cAMP receptor protein (CRP) complex. This study uses S. marcescens as a model system to test the role of cAMP-phosphodiesterase activity in controlling biofilm formation. Herein we describe the characterization of a putative S. marcescens cAMP-phosphodiesterase gene (SMA3506), designated as cpdS, and demonstrated to be a functional cAMP-phosphodiesterase both in vitro and in vivo. Deletion of cpdS resulted in defective biofilm formation and reduced type I fimbriae production, whereas multicopy expression of cpdS conferred a type I fimbriae-dependent hyper-biofilm. Together, these results support a model in which bacterial cAMP-phosphodiesterase activity modulates biofilm formation."

Successful HIV entry into CD4+ T cells requires actin reorganization induced by the interaction of the cellular receptor/co-receptor complex CD4/CXCR4 with the viral envelope complex gp120/gp41 (Env). In this report, we analyze the role of the actin modulator drebrin in HIV-1 viral infection and cell to cell fusion. We show that drebrin associates with CXCR4 before and during HIV infection. Drebrin is actively recruited toward cell-virus and Env-driven cell to cell contacts. After viral internalization, drebrin clustering is retained in a fraction of the internalized particles. Through a combination of RNAi-based inhibition of endogenous drebrin and GFP-tagged expression of wild-type and mutant forms, we establish drebrin as a negative regulator of HIV entry and HIV-mediated cell fusion. Down-regulation of drebrin expression promotes HIV-1 entry, decreases F-actin polymerization, and enhances profilin local accumulation in response to HIV-1. These data underscore the negative role of drebrin in HIV infection by modulating viral entry, mainly through the control of actin cytoskeleton polymerization in response to HIV-1.Background: Drebrin binds to F-actin and CXCR4 in T cells.

https://openalex.org/W2111913564,"High-throughput screening for interactions of peptides with a variety of antibody targets could greatly facilitate proteomic analysis for epitope mapping, enzyme profiling, drug discovery and biomarker identification. Peptide microarrays are suited for such undertaking because of their high-throughput capability. However, existing peptide microarrays lack the sensitivity needed for detecting low abundance proteins or low affinity peptide-protein interactions. This work presents a new peptide microarray platform constructed on nanostructured plasmonic gold substrates capable of metal enhanced NIR fluorescence enhancement (NIR-FE) by hundreds of folds for screening peptide-antibody interactions with ultrahigh sensitivity. Further, an integrated histone peptide and whole antigen array is developed on the same plasmonic gold chip for profiling human antibodies in the sera of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients, revealing that collectively a panel of biomarkers against unmodified and post-translationally modified histone peptides and several whole antigens allow more accurate differentiation of SLE patients from healthy individuals than profiling biomarkers against peptides or whole antigens alone."

Although it is known that relaxin mediates its actions through the G protein-coupled receptor relaxin family peptide receptor 1 (RXFP1), little is known about the molecular mechanisms by which relaxin binding results in receptor activation. Previous studies have highlighted that the unique N-terminal low density lipoprotein class A (LDLa) module of RXFP1 is essential for receptor activation, and it has been hypothesized that this module is the true “ligand” of the receptor that directs the conformational changes necessary for G protein coupling. In this study, we confirmed that an RXFP1 receptor lacking the LDLa module binds ligand normally but cannot signal through any characterized G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway. Furthermore, we comprehensively examined the contributions of amino acids in the LDLa module to RXFP1 activity using both gain-of-function and loss-of-function mutational analysis together with NMR structural analysis of recombinant LDLa modules. Gain-of-function studies with an inactive RXFP1 chimera containing the LDLa module of the human LDL receptor (LB2) demonstrated two key N-terminal regions of the module that were able to rescue receptor signaling.

However, RXFP1 and RXFP2 are unique in both the leucine-rich repeat-containing GPCR and GPCR family in that they have a low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLr) class A (LDLa) module at their N termini.

In addition to a correctly folded module, there is also evidence to suggest that specific amino acid side chains are necessary for the activity of the LDLa module. When the LDLa module of human RXFP1 was swapped with the second ligand binding domain (LB2) of the LDLr with which it shares high structural but relatively low sequence similarity (Fig. 1), the resulting chimera was unable to signal, although it was expressed on the cell surface and bound H2 relaxin like RXFP1 (19.Hopkins E.J.

Although the study did not conclusively verify the properties of Leu-7 or Tyr-9 essential for activation, it provided compelling evidence to suggest that specific LDLa residues with specific signaling roles exist. It is clear that an obvious gap in the understanding of RXFP1 activation exists as the molecular mechanics surrounding the role of the LDLa module remain elusive. Therefore, this study aimed to advance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of LDLa-mediated activation of RXFP1. First, we clarified whether the LDLa module is essential for any G protein-mediated signaling. We then adopted a gain-of-function and loss-of-function approach to identify LDLa signaling residues. Subsequently, we sought to understand the molecular mechanism involved in the LDLa action by characterizing the side chain properties engaged in potential protein-protein interactions that form the active receptor. HEK293T cells (ATCC number CRL-1573, American Type Tissue Culture Collection) stably expressing RXFP1 without the LDLa module (RXFP1-short) were generated via retrovirus transduction (21.Cepko C. Pear W. Overview of the retrovirus transduction system.Curr. Protoc. Mol. Biol. 2001; (Chapter 9, Unit 9.9)Google Scholar). Simply, the receptor-coding DNA sequence was first subcloned in-frame via a 5′ BamHI and a 3′ XhoI restriction site into the MSCV-IRES-GFP retroviral expression vector (a kind gift from Associate Prof. Ross Hannan, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Australia) in the 5′–3′ direction between the 5′ long terminal repeats and the internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) sequence. Green fluorescent protein (GFP) follows the IRES. Following cloning and sequencing, the MSCV-RXFP1-short-IRES-GFP construct was utilized for retrovirus production by co-transfecting HEK293T cells on a 10-cm cell culture dish (Nunc) with the construct together with the Ampho packaging plasmid (a kind gift from Associate Prof. Ross Hannan) for 48 h. Retrovirus secreted into the medium was collected and passed through a 30-mm-diameter 0.45-μm Durapore PVDF syringe filter (Millipore) to remove any cell particulate prior to storage at −80 °C. HEK293T cells seeded on a 10-cm cell culture dish were transduced with the harvested retrovirus by replacing the cell culture medium with 10 ml of the retrovirus-containing medium mixed with Polybrene (Millipore) to increase the transduction efficiency. Two rounds of 24-h transduction were performed before the cells were allowed to recover for 48 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Multicel) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 1% l-glutamine (referred to as complete DMEM). The cells were then transferred and grown to confluence in a 175-cm2 flask. Transduced cells were sorted into three distinct populations based on the amount of GFP fluorescence using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) on a MoFloTM XDP cell sorter (Beckman Coulter): high, medium, and low GFP (hence receptor) expression. These cells were then grown to confluence before assessing receptor expression on the cell surface via the cell surface expression assay as outlined below. The SEAP reporter gene assay was performed as described (22.Halls M.L. Bathgate R.A. Summers R.J. Comparison of signaling pathways activated by the relaxin family peptide receptors, RXFP1 and RXFP2, using reporter genes.J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2007; 320: 281-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) using reporter gene constructs (Clontech) that contained the SEAP gene under the control of specific transcription factor consensus sequences (cAMP response element (CRE), glucocorticoid response element, nuclear factor of κB cells (NFκB), activator protein 1, serum response element, nuclear factor of activated T cells, E-box DNA binding element (Myc), and heat shock element). Briefly, HEK293T cells stably expressing RXFP1 or RXFP1-short seeded in 12-well plates (Nunc) were first transfected with the desired plasmids for 30 h at a 1:1 ratio for a reporter gene of interest and the mCherry plasmid. Cells were then partially serum-starved for 18 h in DMEM supplemented with 0.5% FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 1% l-glutamine prior to stimulation using 100 nm H2 relaxin. Stimulation was allowed to occur for 18 h (a time point chosen as responses began to peak at 12 h and were maintained at 24 h (22.Halls M.L. Bathgate R.A. Summers R.J. Comparison of signaling pathways activated by the relaxin family peptide receptors, RXFP1 and RXFP2, using reporter genes.J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2007; 320: 281-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar)) after which medium samples were collected, frozen at −20 °C, and had their SEAP protein content quantified using the BD Great EscAPeTM SEAP Fluorescence Detection kit (Clontech). The transfection efficiency of the reporter gene constructs could affect SEAP protein expression and hence bias the results; therefore, the mCherry plasmid, which constitutively expressed a red fluorescent monomer, served as a control to measure transfection efficiency between and within experiments. Upon medium sample collection, cells in each well were lysed in 500 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris base, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, pH 7.4) and transferred to a 96-well OptiPlate with white opaque walls. mCherry fluorescence was then measured using a Victor Multilabel Plate Reader with 587 and 610 nm excitation and emission wavelengths, respectively. Data analysis was performed as described (22.Halls M.L. Bathgate R.A. Summers R.J. Comparison of signaling pathways activated by the relaxin family peptide receptors, RXFP1 and RXFP2, using reporter genes.J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2007; 320: 281-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) using GraphPad Prism 5. Briefly, discrepancies in cell transfection efficiency were first corrected by standardizing the SEAP protein measurement using the fluorescence measurement of the mCherry protein in each individual well. The transformed SEAP readings were then expressed as -fold change in response to peptide stimulation compared with the effect of vehicle alone. Data from three independent assays were pooled and are displayed as mean -fold change ±S.E. Unpaired two-tailed t tests were performed on the transfection-standardized and background-corrected data, comparing the peptide- and vehicle-treated cells for each reporter gene construct. Human RXFP1 with its LDLa module substituted with the LB2 module was cloned into pcDNA3.1/Zeo (RXFP1-LB2) (19.Hopkins E.J. Layfield S. Ferraro T. Bathgate R.A. Gooley P.R. The NMR solution structure of the relaxin (RXFP1) receptor lipoprotein receptor class A module and identification of key residues in the N-terminal region of the module that mediate receptor activation.J.

As the LB2 module was inserted via two artificially engineered EcoRI restriction sites flanking the LDLa sequence, site-directed mutagenesis was used to delete the two additional amino acids (Glu-Phe) at each end of the LDLa module encoded by the EcoRI restriction sites. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out via the QuikChange method as described (23.Yan Y. Scott D.J. Wilkinson T.N. Ji J. Tregear G.W. Bathgate R.A.

Polymerase chain reactions were performed with the RXFP1 or RXFP1-LB2 plasmids as templates to generate whole receptor mutants. The pGEV-LB2 plasmid expresses the LB2 module fused at its N terminus to B1 immunoglobulin binding domain of streptococcal protein G (GB1). Mutagenesis was performed on this plasmid to generate mutant LB2 modules for recombinant expression in Escherichia coli. Mutagenic primers were designed as detailed (24.Zheng L. Baumann U. Reymond J.-L. An efficient one-step site-directed and site-saturation mutagenesis protocol.Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: e115Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar).

Hence, the DNA sequence encoding the LB2 module with introduced RXFP1 LDLa residues and flanking EcoRI restriction sites was purchased from GenScript and cloned into the original pcDNA3.1/Zeo construct (19.Hopkins E.J.

https://openalex.org/W2026997251,"Duck is an economically important poultry and animal model for human viral hepatitis B. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying host-virus interaction remain unclear because of limited information on the duck genome. This study aims to characterize the duck normal liver transcriptome and to identify the differentially expressed transcripts at 24 h after duck hepatitis A virus genotype C (DHAV-C) infection using Illumina-Solexa sequencing.After removal of low-quality sequences and assembly, a total of 52,757 unigenes was obtained from the normal liver group. Further blast analysis showed that 18,918 unigenes successfully matched the known genes in the database. GO analysis revealed that 25,116 unigenes took part in 61 categories of biological processes, cellular components, and molecular functions. Among the 25 clusters of orthologous group categories (COG), the cluster for ""General function prediction only"" represented the largest group, followed by ""Transcription"" and ""Replication, recombination, and repair."" KEGG analysis showed that 17,628 unigenes were involved in 301 pathways. Through comparison of normal and infected transcriptome data, we identified 20 significantly differentially expressed unigenes, which were further confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Of the 20 unigenes, nine matched the known genes in the database, including three up-regulated genes (virus replicase polyprotein, LRRC3B, and PCK1) and six down-regulated genes (CRP, AICL-like 2, L1CAM, CYB26A1, CHAC1, and ADAM32). The remaining 11 novel unigenes that did not match any known genes in the database may provide a basis for the discovery of new transcripts associated with infection.This study provided a gene expression pattern for normal duck liver and for the previously unrecognized changes in gene transcription that are altered during DHAV-C infection. Our data revealed useful information for future studies on the duck genome and provided new insights into the molecular mechanism of host-DHAV-C interaction."
https://openalex.org/W2019208429,"Among the several multigene families codified by the genome of T. cruzi, the TcTASV family was the latest discovered. The TcTASV (Trypomastigote, Alanine, Serine, Valine) family is composed of ∼40 members, with conserved carboxi- and amino-termini but with a variable central core. According to the length and sequence of the central region the family is split into 3 subfamilies. The TcTASV family is conserved in the genomes of – at least – lineages TcI and TcVI and has no orthologues in other trypanosomatids. In the present work we focus on the study of the TcTASV-C subfamily, composed by 16 genes in the CL Brener strain. We determined that TcTASV-C is preferentially expressed in trypomastigotes, but it is not a major component of the parasite. Both immunoflourescence and flow cytometry experiments indicated that TcTASV-C has a clonal expression, i.e. it is not expressed by all the parasites of a certain population at the same time. We also determined that TcTASV-C is phosphorylated and glycosylated. TASV-C is attached to the parasite surface by a GPI anchor and is shed spontaneously into the medium. About 30% of sera from infected hosts reacted with TcTASV-C, confirming its exposition to the immune system. Its superficial localization and secretory nature suggest a possible role in host-parasite interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2146440581,"Background Our previous studies have shown that signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling is important for the development of pancreatic microvasculature via its regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A). Pancreas-specific STAT3-KO mice exhibit glucose intolerance and impaired insulin secretion in vivo, along with microvascular alterations in the pancreas. However, the specific role of STAT3 signaling in the regulation of pancreatic islet development and function is not entirely understood. Methodology/Principal Findings To investigate the role of STAT3 signaling in the formation and maintenance of pancreatic islets, we studied pancreas-specific STAT3-KO mice. Histological analysis showed that STAT3 deficiency affected pancreatic islet morphology. We found an increased proportion of small-sized islets and a reduced fraction of medium-sized islets, indicating abnormal islet development in STAT3-KO mice. Interestingly, the islet area relative to the whole pancreas area in transgenic and control mice was not significantly different. Immunohistochemical analysis on pancreatic cryosections revealed abnormalities in islet architecture in STAT3-KO mice: the pattern of peripheral distribution of glucagon-positive α-cells was altered. At the same time, islets belonging to different size categories isolated from STAT3-KO mice exhibited normal glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in perifusion experiments in vitro when compared to control mice. Conclusions Our data demonstrate that STAT3 signaling in the pancreas is required for normal islet formation and/or maintenance. Altered islet size distribution in the KO mice does not result in an impaired islet secretory function in vitro. Therefore, our current study supports that the glucose intolerance and in vivo insulin secretion defect in pancreas-specific STAT3-KO mice is due to altered microvasculature in the pancreas, and not intrinsic beta-cell function."
https://openalex.org/W1982780307,"Large-scale interspecific studies of mammals ranging between 0.04-280 kg have shown that larger animals walk with more extended limb joints. Within a taxon or clade, however, the relationship between body size and joint posture is less straightforward. Factors that may affect the lack of congruence between broad and narrow phylogenetic analyses of limb kinematics include limited sampling of (1) ranges of body size, and/or (2) numbers of individuals. Unfortunately, both issues are inherent in laboratory-based or zoo locomotion research. In this study, we examined the relationship between body mass and elbow and knee joint angles (our proxies of fore- and hind limb posture, respectively) in a cross-sectional ontogenetic sample of wild chacma baboons (Papio hamadryas ursinus) habituated in the De Hoop Nature Reserve, South Africa. Videos were obtained from 33 individuals of known age (12 to ≥ 108 months) and body mass (2-29.5 kg) during walking trials. Results show that older, heavier baboons walk with significantly more extended knee joints but not elbow joints. This pattern is consistent when examining only males, but not within the female sample. Heavier, older baboons also display significantly less variation in their hind limb posture compared to lighter, young animals. Thus, within this ontogenetic sample of a single primate species spanning an order of magnitude in body mass, hind limb posture exhibited a postural scaling phenomenon while the forelimbs did not. These findings may further help explain 1) why younger mammals (including baboons) tend to have relatively stronger bones than adults, and 2) why humeri appear relatively weaker than femora (in at least baboons). Finally, this study demonstrates how field-acquired kinematics can help answer fundamental biomechanical questions usually addressed only in animal gait laboratories."
https://openalex.org/W2085388062,"Hepatitis A (HAV) and hepatitis B (HBV) vaccination in patients with chronic liver disease is an accepted standard of care. We determined HAV and HBV vaccination rates in a tertiary care referral hepatology clinic and the impact of electronic health record (EHR)-based reminders on adherence to vaccination guidelines.We reviewed the records of 705 patients with chronic liver disease referred to our liver clinic in 2008 with at least two follow-up visits during the subsequent year. Demographics, referral source, etiology, and hepatitis serology were recorded. We determined whether eligible patients were offered vaccination and whether patients received vaccination. Barriers to vaccination were determined by a follow-up telephone interview.HAV and HBV serologic testing prior to referral and at the liver clinic were performed in 14.5% and 17.7%; and 76.7% and 74% patients, respectively. Hepatologists recommended vaccination for HAV in 63% and for HBV in 59.7% of eligible patients. Patient demographics or disease etiology did not influence recommendation rates. Significant variability was observed in vaccination recommendation amongst individual providers (30-98.6%), which did not correlate with the number of patients seen by each physician. Vaccination recommendation rates were not different for Medicare patients with hepatitis C infection for whom a vaccination reminder was automatically generated by the EHR. Most patients who failed to get vaccination after recommendation offered no specific reason for noncompliance; insurance was a barrier in a minority.Hepatitis vaccination rates were suboptimal even in an academic, sub-speciality setting, with wide-variability in provider adherence to vaccination guidelines."
https://openalex.org/W2078818115,"The generation of high-affinity antibodies and the development of B cell memory are dependent on the help provided by CD4 T cells. Mouse studies indicate that STAT3 signaling in CD4 T cells promotes the acquisition of the B cell help function. However, the role of STAT3 in humans has been controversial. In this study, we show that IL-6 and other STAT3 activating cytokines (IL-21 and IL-27) induce the differentiation of CD4 T cells promoting antibody production by B cells. The acquisition of B cell stimulating properties by naive cord blood CD4 T cells required the STAT3-dependent expression of ICOS and IL-21. Gene reporter and ChIP experiments unambiguously demonstrated that upon IL-6 stimulation, STAT3 induces the transcription of the ICOS gene through direct recruitment to the proximal promoter region indicating that STAT3 acts in part through the direct activation of the ICOS gene."

Segal D. JAB1/CSN5 and the COP9 signalosome. A complex situation.EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 96-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The CSN complex typically consists of 8 subunits that show significant homology with the 19 S lid subcomplex of the 26 S proteosome and translation initiation factor eIF3 (2Wei N. Serino G. Deng X.W. The COP9 signalosome. More than a protease.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2008; 33: 592-600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). The best characterized function of the CSN is its isopeptidase catalytic activity that cleaves the covalently bound Nedd8 protein of the Cullin family and thereby regulates the activity of the Cullin-ring ubiquitin ligases (3Richardson K.S. Zundel W. The emerging role of the COP9 signalosome in cancer.Mol. Cancer Res. 2005; 3: 645-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). CSN has been of considerable interest to tumor biologists, because is known to play a crucial role in the degradation of multiple key players involved in essential cellular activities of cancer progression (3Richardson K.S. Zundel W. The emerging role of the COP9 signalosome in cancer.Mol. Cancer Res. 2005; 3: 645-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). CSN5, the fifth element of the CSN complex, was originally discovered as a transcriptional co-activator of c-Jun, Jab1 (Jun activation domain-binding protein 1) (4Seeger M. Kraft R. Ferrell K. Bech-Otschir D. Dumdey R. Schade R. Gordon C. Naumann M. Dubiel W. A novel protein complex involved in signal transduction possessing similarities to 26S proteasome subunits.FASEB J. 1998; 12: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). CSN5 is now of great interest not only as an important catalytic subunit for the deneddylation of Cullin-ring ubiquitin ligases but also as a multifunctional cell cycle regulator (5Shackleford T.J. Claret F.X. JAB1/CSN5. A new player in cell cycle control and cancer.Cell Div. 2010; 5: 26Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Furthermore, accumulating evidence has revealed that CSN5 is an oncoprotein. CSN5 is overexpressed in tumors of varying origin, and CSN5 knockdown inhibits the proliferation of cancer cells (6Fukumoto A. Tomoda K. Yoneda-Kato N. Nakajima Y. Kato J.Y. Depletion of Jab1 inhibits proliferation of pancreatic cancer cell lines.FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 5836-5844Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Moreover, CSN5, both as a part of the CSN holoenzyme and independently, actively participates in essential cellular functions, such as cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, apoptosis, and the maintenance of genome stability (2Wei N. Serino G. Deng X.W. The COP9 signalosome. More than a protease.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2008; 33: 592-600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 7Tian L. Peng G. Parant J.M.

CSN5 also interacts with a number of important cellular regulators including Cyclin E, p53, and β-Catenin. Among these proteins, the expression of Myc, Cyclin A, Cdk2, and p27, were stabilized in CSN5 knockdown cells, whereas those of Skp2, c-Jun, and HIF1-α were destabilized in the same model system (2Wei N.

CENP-W was initially identified as a putative oncogene, cancer up-regulated gene 2 (CUG2), which is commonly up-regulated in various types of human cancers and is highly oncogenic in a mouse fibroblast cell line (9Lee S.

As a complex, CENP-T·CENP-W functions prior to other centromere components as a prerequisite factor for the recruitment of centromere components. Cellular depletion of CENP-T·CENP-W induces severe defects in the assembly of a functional kinetochore and aberrant chromosome segregation (10Hori T. Amano M. Suzuki A. Backer C.B. Welburn J.P.

Furthermore, we recently localized CENP-W to the nucleolus during interphase, where it was found to interact with the nucleolar phosphoprotein, Nucleophosmin-1/B23 (12Chun Y. Park B. Koh W. Lee S. Cheon Y. Kim R. Che L. Lee S. New centromeric component CENP-W is an RNA-associated nuclear matrix protein that interacts with nucleophosmin/B23 protein.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 42758-42769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). We proposed that CENP-W mediates the interaction between the pre-kinetochore complex and nucleoli during interphase, and may therefore contribute to the maintenance of centromere protein stability and the recruitment of kinetochore components during mitosis (12Chun Y. Park B. Koh W. Lee S. Cheon Y. Kim R. Che L. Lee S. New centromeric component CENP-W is an RNA-associated nuclear matrix protein that interacts with nucleophosmin/B23 protein.J. Biol.

In the present study, we identified an interaction between CSN5 and CENP-T·CENP-W and showed the ability of CSN5 to regulate the protein stability of CENP-T·CENP-W through the ubiquitin-mediated degradation pathway. Our findings suggest that a novel role exists for CSN5 that enable it to regulate the integrity of the functional kinetochore complex. Transient transfection of 293T cells was performed using either EffecteneTM (Qiagen) or polyethylenimine reagent (Sigma) according to the vendor's instructions. HeLa-FLAG-CENP-W stable cells (11Kim H. Lee M. Lee S. Park B. Koh W. Lee D.J. Lim D.S.

Cells. 2009; 27: 697-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum under standard cell culture conditions. HeLa cells stably expressing CENP-T were also generated with pcDNA-3FLAG-CENP-T plasmid (11Kim H. Lee M. Lee S. Park B. Koh W. Lee D.J. Lim D.S. Cancer-upregulated gene 2 (CUG2), a new component of centromere complex, is required for kinetochore function.Mol. Cells. 2009; 27: 697-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). To generate the GST-CSN5 construct, full-length CSN5 was amplified from the cDNA clone obtained from the 21C Frontier Human Gene Bank (Korea). Then, the PCR product was subcloned into the pEBG vector (11Kim H. Lee M. Lee S. Park B. Koh W. Lee D.J. Lim D.S. Cancer-upregulated gene 2 (CUG2), a new component of centromere complex, is required for kinetochore function.Mol. Cells. 2009; 27: 697-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) using the BamHI-NotI restriction sites. The ORF of CSN5 was also subcloned into EGFP-C1 vector (Clontech) using BglII and XbaI sites. For siRNA treatment, cells were transfected with siRNAs synthesized from Bioneer (Korea) using LipofectaminTM (Invitrogen). The target sequences were as follows: CSN5, GCUCAGAGUAUCGAUGAAA; CENP-T, CAGUAGUGGCCAGGCUUCA; and CENP-W, a mixture of CAGAUAAAGCGGAAGGCUC and UACUGGCCGCAGCAAAGGU. By using EcoRI and SalI, the C terminus region (amino acids 455–546) was amplified and subcloned into the pGBKT7 vector (Clontech) to generate a bait plasmid. Screening was performed with the MatchmakerTM two-hybrid system and the pre-transformed human fetal testis library (Clontech). For co-immunoprecipitation, cells were first lysed in a lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% Triton X-100) supplemented with Protease Inhibitor Mixture (Sigma). The cleared lysate was then mixed with 1 μg of an appropriate antibody or preimmune mouse IgG (Santa Cruz) for 2 h at 4 °C, followed by protein A-agarose (Amersham Biosciences) treatment. For glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull-down, the cell lysate was incubated with 20 μl of a 50% slurry suspension of glutathione-agarose beads (Peptron, Korea) for 2 h at 4 °C with gentle rotation. For the in vitro protein-binding assay, CSN5, CENP-W, and CENP-T were first subcloned into the pET15b bacterial expression vector (Novagen). Next, the His-tagged recombinant proteins were expressed using the Escherichia coli S30 T7 protein expression system (Promega), and co-immunoprecipitation was carried out using an anti-CSN5 antibody (Santa Cruz). Anti-FLAG and anti-Myc antibodies were purchased from Sigma, and anti-His, anti-HA, anti-GFP, anti-CENP-A, anti-CENP-B, anti-Cyclin A, and anti-p27 antibodies from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. To measure the half-life of a protein, cyclohexamide (Sigma) was added at 100 μg/ml to cells. Then, cells were harvested at different time points and the half-life was quantified by densitometric measurement of the Western blot intensity. For the in vivo ubiquitination assay, 293T cells or HeLa stable cells were transfected with HA-ubiquitin plasmid (kindly provided by Dr. J. Ahn of Chungnam National University, Korea). After 24 h, cells were lysed and target proteins were immunoprecipitated with the appropriate antibody. Co-fractionated ubiquitinated proteins were then identified by Western blotting with an anti-HA antibody. For CSN5 co-localization analysis, HeLa cells were incubated with either hydroxyurea (2 mm) or nocodazole (100 ng/ml) for 12 h prior to fixation in 4% freshly prepared paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min. Next, cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS, the coverslips were incubated with anti-FLAG and anti-CSN5 antibody, followed by FITC-labeled anti-mouse antibody (Vector Laboratories) and Cy3-linked anti-rabbit antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Imaging was performed using an Olympus IX70 fluorescence microscope at ×200 magnification. For cell fractionation, 10 ml of linear glycerol gradient (10–40%) containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 120 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, was prepared. After loading the cell lysate onto the glycerol gradient, the sample was centrifuged at 40,000 × g in a Beckman SW 41 Ti rotor for 16 h at 4 °C. The fractions (0.7 ml) were collected from the bottom and labeled as fraction 1. We previously identified CENP-T as the binding partner of CENP-W by yeast two-hybrid screening (9Lee S. Gang J. Jeon S.B. Choo S.H. Lee B. Kim Y.G. Lee Y.S. Jung J. Song S.Y. Koh S.S. Molecular cloning and functional analysis of a novel oncogene, cancer-upregulated gene 2 (CUG2).Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 360: 633-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In the present study, we used the same approach to identify new CENP-T-interacting proteins. Because full-length CENP-T was self-active when fused to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain, we used a truncated C-terminal region (amino acids 455–546) of CENP-T as bait. This region contains the Histone 2A (H2A) domain (amino acids 477–523), which we identified using the SMART (Simple Modular Architecture Research Tool) protein domain analysis program. Screening was performed against a human testis cDNA library. Among the selected clones, we isolated CENP-T, suggesting that CENP-T can exist as a dimer. We also identified a cDNA sequence of CSN5, the fifth component of CSN. To confirm the interaction between CSN5 and CENP-T, we performed co-immunoprecipitation with ectopically expressed GST-CSN5 and FLAG-CENP-T in 293T cells. CSN5 was co-isolated with full-length CENP-T as well as with the C-terminal region of CENP-T (Fig. 1A). Likewise, GST pull-down experiments revealed that the C-terminal region (amino acids 455–546) of CENP-T was eluted with GST-CSN5 (Fig. 1B). The CSN5-CENP-T interaction was then examined endogenously by immunoprecipitation using an anti-CSN5 antibody and HeLa cell lysates, followed by Western blot analysis with an anti-CENP-T antibody (12Chun Y. Park B. Koh W. Lee S. Cheon Y. Kim R. Che L. Lee S. New centromeric component CENP-W is an RNA-associated nuclear matrix protein that interacts with nucleophosmin/B23 protein.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 42758-42769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). CENP-T was present in the CSN5 fraction, but not in the normal IgG fraction (Fig. 1C). Finally, to demonstrate direct binding between CSN5 and CENP-T, we performed an in vitro binding assay using recombinant proteins obtained from an E. coli lysate-based cell-free expression system. Co-immunoprecipitation with an anti-CSN5 antibody revealed that His-CSN5 expressed in vitro directly interacts with recombinant His-CENP-T (Fig. 1D). To determine which CSN5 domain is required for the interaction with CENP-T, a series of truncated versions of CSN5 were generated and tested for CENP-T binding activity. The deneddylation activity of CSN5 was previously mapped to the JAB1/MPN/Mov34 metalloenzyme (JAMM) motifs located within the Pad1p N-terminal (MPN) domain (Fig. 1E). We found that the interaction between CSN5 and CENP-T also depended on the N-terminal region containing the MPN domain (amino acids 1–190). Interestingly, additional deletion analysis revealed that the N-terminal short fragment containing the JNK-binding domain (amino acids 1–53) (13Bogoyevitch M.A. Kobe B. Uses for JNK: the many and varied substrates of the c-Jun N-terminal kinases.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2006; 70: 1061-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar) has greater CENP-T binding activity than the MPN domain (amino acids 54–190). Conversely, we mapped the CENP-T region required for binding to CSN5 using CENP-T deletion mutants. The H2A domain within CENP-T, previously used as bait for yeast two-hybrid screening, was sufficient for interaction with CSN5 (Fig. 1F). Based on studies that indicate CSN5 is an important regulator of proteasome-dependent degradation of key proteins in the cell cycle (8Yoshida A. Yoneda-Kato N. Panattoni M. Pardi R. Kato J.Y. CSN5/Jab1 controls multiple events in the mammalian cell cycle.FEBS Lett. 2010; 584: 4545-4552Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), we evaluated the ability of CSN5 to modulate CENP-T protein stability. First, we determined if CENP-T degradation is proteasome-dependent using MG132, a potent inhibitor of proteasomes, in HeLa-FLAG-CENP-T stable cells. After blocking protein synthesis with cyclohexamide treatment, we determined that the half-life of CENP-T increased greatly following MG132 treatment, indicating that proteasomes are involved in the breakdown of CENP-T (Fig. 2A). Next, HeLa-CENP-T stable cells transfected with GST-CSN5 or GST were treated with cyclohexamide and used to examine CENP-T protein levels. The half-life of CENP-T was significantly decreased in GST-CSN5-transfected cells compared with GST expressing control cells (Fig. 2B). The N-terminal short fragment (amino acids 1–53), which was identified to be crucial in binding with CENP-T also promotes CENP-T degradation, suggesting that the effect of CSN5 to CENP-T is dependent on a protein-protein interaction. Moreover, we determined the effects of the CSN5 inhibitor, curcumin, on CENP-T protein stability. At 24 h post-transfection with CSN5, HeLa-CENP-T stable cells were treated with increasing concentrations of curcumin. The addition of curcumin significantly increased CENP-T stability, the extent of which was proportional to the amount of destabilized CSN5 (Fig. 2C). We also carried out an in vivo ubiquitination assay to determine whether CSN5 can regulate the ubiquitination of CENP-T. HeLa-FLAG-CENP-T cells were transfected with HA-ubiquitin, and immunoprecipitation was carried out with an anti-FLAG antibody. The number of high molecular weight ubiquitinated CENP-T signals significantly increased when CSN5 was co-transfected (Fig. 2D). Finally, the protein level of CENP-T was examined after knockdown of CSN5 in HeLa cells following a 32-h siRNA treatment. Depletion of CSN5 resulted in an increase in endogenous CENP-T protein levels (Fig. 2E). The known target of CSN5, cyclin A, was also examined to verify the suppression of CSN5 in cells. Altogether, these data suggest that CSN5 promotes the proteasome-dependent degradation of CENP-T in a ubiquitin-mediated manner. CSN5 promotion of the nuclear to cytoplasmic shuttling of target proteins, such as p27, has been observed in a number of other studies (5Shackleford T.J. Claret F.X. JAB1/CSN5. A new player in cell cycle control and cancer.Cell Div. 2010; 5: 26Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). To determine whether CSN5 can change the localization of CENP-T within cells, HeLa-FLAG-CENP-T stable cells were transfected with EGFP-CSN5. After immunostaining with an anti-FLAG antibody and Cy3-labeled secondary antibody, the EGFP-CSN5 and CENP-T signals were monitored. Although no cytoplasmic shuttling of CENP-T was observed, almost all CENP-T signals were lost in ∼30% of CSN5-transfected cells, suggesting that CSN5 co-expression facilitates CENP-T degradation (Fig. 2F). In contrast, CSN5 was found in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, and no significant differences were observed upon co-transfection of CENP-T. Given that CENP-T functions as a complex with CENP-W (10Hori T. Amano M. Suzuki A. Backer C.B. Welburn J.P. Dong Y. McEwen B.F. Shang W.H. Suzuki E. Okawa K. Cheeseman I.M. Fukagawa T.

CENP-T-W-S-X forms a unique centromeric chromatin structure with a histone-like fold.Cell. 2012; 148: 487-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), we examined the ability of CSN5 to interact with CENP-W in vivo. 293T cells were transfected with FLAG-CENP-W and GST-CSN5 and used in an in vivo binding assay. GST pull-down revealed that GST-CSN5 co-fractionated with FLAG-CENP-W (Fig. 3A), and reciprocal immunoprecipitation showed that CSN5 also bound to FLAG-CENP-W (Fig. 3B). To examine CSN5 and CENP-W interaction at the endogenous level, and because of the unavailability of specific antibodies for CENP-W, we used HeLa cells stably expressing FLAG-CENP-W (12Chun Y. Park B. Koh W. Lee S. Cheon Y. Kim R. Che L. Lee S. New centromeric component CENP-W is an RNA-associated nuclear matrix protein that interacts with nucleophosmin/B23 protein.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 42758-42769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). When immunoprecipitation was conducted using an anti-CSN5 antibody, FLAG-CENP-W was clearly observed in the CSN5 complex (Fig. 3C), but not in the IgG control. We also examined the in vitro binding of recombinant CENP-W and CSN5 proteins using the E. coli cell-free expression system. His-CENP-W was co-fractionated with His-CSN5 when immunoprecipitated with an anti-CSN5 antibody in vitro (Fig. 3D), indicating a direct interaction between these 2 proteins. To evaluate the complex formation of these 3 proteins, we transfected 293T cells with FLAG-CENP-T, Myc-CENP-W, and GST-CSN5 plasmids and performed immunoprecipitation with an anti-FLAG antibody. CSN5 and CENP-W were co-eluted with FLAG-CENP-T, whereas no specific bands were observed with normal mouse IgG (Fig. 3E), suggesting that these 3 proteins exist in the same complex. Taken together, these results demonstrate that CSN5 interacts with CENP-W as well as CENP-T, and these 3 proteins likely form a complex in vivo. To identify the region of CSN5 responsible for CENP-W binding, we performed GST pull-down using GST-CSN5 deletion mutants. CENP-W had a different binding specificity from CENP-T: a truncated CSN5 containing the MPN domain (amino acids 54–190) was sufficient to interact with CENP-W (Fig. 3F), whereas the presence of the short N terminus fragment (amino acids 1–53), important in CENP-T affinity, inhibited the interaction between CENP-W and CSN5. Both the large N-terminal region (amino acids 1–190) and the short N-terminal fragment (amino acids 1–53) did not bind with CENP-W. Furthermore, we examined the region of CENP-W necessary for the interaction with CSN5. Our results indicate that the middle region of CENP-W (amino acids 31–60) most likely mediates its interaction with CSN5 (Fig. 3G). To determine whether CSN5 can also regulate CENP-W protein stability, we examined the degradation rate of CENP-W in the presence and absence of CSN5. 293T cells were transfected with FLAG-CENP-W and GST-CSN5 for 24 h, followed by cyclohexamide treatment. The degradation rate of CENP-W was slightly accelerated in CSN5 co-transfection (Fig. 4A). To confirm this observation, we transfected A549-FLAG-CENP-W stable cells (11Kim H. Lee M. Lee S. Park B. Koh W. Lee D.J. Lim D.S. Cancer-upregulated gene 2 (CUG2), a new component of centromere complex, is required for kinetochore function.Mol. Cells. 2009; 27: 697-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) with increasing concentrations of GST-CSN5 plasmid and found that CENP-W protein levels decreased in proportion to the concentrations of CSN5 in transfected cells (Fig. 4B). Moreover, the CSN5 inhibitor curcumin induced CSN5 destabilization, which in turn resulted in CENP-W stabilization, indicating that CSN5 controls CENP-W protein levels (Fig. 4C). Next, we determined if the observed accelerated CENP-W degradation by CSN5 is a proteasome-mediated process. As shown in Fig. 4D, incubation with MG132 clearly abrogated CSN5-mediated CENP-W degradation. Finally, we performed an in vivo ubiquitination assay, which revealed that the ubiquitination of CENP-W significantly increases when CSN5 is co-transfected in cells (Fig. 4E). Taken together, these results show that CSN5 promotes the proteasomal degradation of CENP-W. Again, no cytoplasmic shuttling of CENP-W was observed when CENP-W and CSN5 were co-expressed in HeLa cells (Fig. 4F); however, we did notice there was a change in the nuclear distribution of CENP-W. As previously reported (12Chun Y. Park B. Koh W. Lee S. Cheon Y. Kim R. Che L. Lee S. New centromeric component CENP-W is an RNA-associated nuclear matrix protein that interacts with nucleophosmin/B23 protein.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 42758-42769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), CENP-W is predominantly accumulated in nucleolar compartments when transiently expressed alone (second row of Fig. 4F). However, when CSN5 was co-expressed, CENP-W was visible as numerous dots in most cells (third row of Fig. 4F). We also performed a knockdown experiment in HeLa-CENP-W stable cells by using CSN5 siRNA. Prolonged treatment (∼72 h) of cells with CSN5 siRNA resulted in decreased levels of both CENP-W and CENP-T, perhaps because of the disruption of global balance or to secondary effects from other CSN5 target molecules (data not shown). However, upon inhibition of CSN5 expression for a shorter period (∼32 h), an increase in CENP-W, CENP-T, as well as previously identified substrates, such as Cyclin A1 and p27, was observed (Fig. 4G). Taken together, these findings indicate that CSN5 promotes the ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation of the CENP-T·CENP-W complex. We also evaluated the effect of CSN5 on CENP-W using CSN5 mutant proteins. The D151N mutant, which does not bind with CENP-W resulted in attenuated CENP-W degradation activity (Fig. 4, H and I). In contrast, the E76A mutant accelerated CENP-W degradation, indicating that the protein-protein interaction is also important in the CSN5-mediated degradation of CENP-W. In our double-transfection experiment with CENP-W and CENP-T, we observed that the level of 1 protein was affected by co-expression of another. To address this phenomenon, we monitored CENP-T protein levels after transfection of 293T cells with increasing concentrations of CENP-W (Fig. 5A). CENP-T protein levels were proportional to CENP-W levels. We also examined CENP-T protein stability in HeLa-CENP-T stable cells transfected with CENP-W. As shown in Fig. 5B, CENP-T decay was remarkably protected with the addition of CENP-W in HeLa-CENP-T stable cells. To determine whether the ubiquitination process was involved in this interaction, we carried out an in vivo ubiquitination assay examining CENP-T in the presence of CSN5 and CENP-W. The smeared bands of high molecular weight CENP-T were intensified by co-expression of CSN5 (Fig. 5C). However, the CSN5-mediated CENP-T ubiquitination was significantly inhibited by CENP-W co-expression, which suggests that CENP-T ubiquitination and degradation was inhibited"

However, the knowledge that can be extracted from this peculiar ecosystem regarding epidemiology of economically relevant diseases has not been widely addressed. We used information available in the scientific literature for 10 old world islands or archipelagos and original data on Sicily to gain new insights into the epidemiology of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTC). We explored three nonexclusive working hypotheses on the processes modulating bovine tuberculosis (bTB) herd prevalence in cattle and MTC strain diversity: insularity, hosts and trade. Results suggest that bTB herd prevalence was positively correlated with island size, the presence of wild hosts, and the number of imported cattle, but neither with isolation nor with cattle density. MTC strain diversity was positively related with cattle bTB prevalence, presence of wild hosts and the number of imported cattle, but not with island size, isolation, and cattle density. The three most common spoligotype patterns coincided between Sicily and mainland Italy. However in Sicily, these common patterns showed a clearer dominance than on the Italian mainland, and seven of 19 patterns (37%) found in Sicily had not been reported from continental Italy. Strain patterns were not spatially clustered in Sicily. We were able to infer several aspects of MTC epidemiology and control in islands and thus in fragmented host and pathogen populations. Our results point out the relevance of the intensity of the cattle commercial networks in the epidemiology of MTC, and suggest that eradication will prove more difficult with increasing size of the island and its environmental complexity, mainly in terms of the diversity of suitable domestic and wild MTC hosts."

https://openalex.org/W2093754311,"Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) fulfill essential biological functions and are key pharmaceutical targets. Regulation of MAPKs is achieved via a plethora of regulatory proteins including activating MAPKKs and an abundance of deactivating phosphatases. Although all regulatory proteins use an identical interaction site on MAPKs, the common docking and hydrophobic pocket, they use distinct kinase interaction motif (KIM or D-motif) sequences that are present in linear, peptide-like, or well folded protein domains. It has been recently shown that a KIM-containing MAPK-specific dual specificity phosphatase DUSP10 uses a unique binding mode to interact with p38α. Here we describe the interaction of the MAPK binding domain of DUSP16 with p38α and show that despite belonging to the same dual specificity phosphatase (DUSP) family, its interaction mode differs from that of DUSP10. Indeed, the DUSP16 MAPK binding domain uses an additional helix, α-helix 4, to further engage p38α. This leads to an additional interaction surface on p38α. Together, these structural and energetic differences in p38α engagement highlight the fine-tuning necessary to achieve MAPK specificity and regulation among multiple regulatory proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1988469226,"The hawkmoth, Manduca sexta, uses both colour and odour to find flowers when foraging for nectar. In the present study we investigated how vision and olfaction interact during learning. Manduca sexta were equally attracted to a scented blue coloured feeding target (multimodal stimulus) as to one that does not carry any scent (unimodal stimulus; visual) or to an invisible scented target (unimodal stimulus; odour). This naive attraction to multimodal as well as to unimodal stimuli could be manipulated through training. Moths trained to feed from a blue, scented multimodal feeding target will, when tested in a set-up containing all three feeding targets, select the multimodal target as well as the scented, unimodal target, but ignore the visual target. Interestingly, moths trained to feed from a blue, unimodal visual feeding target will select the visual target as well as the scented, multimodal target, but ignore the unimodal odour target. Our results indicate that a multimodal target is perceived as two separate modalities, colour and odour, rather than as a unique fused target. These findings differ from earlier studies of desert ants that perceive combined visual and odour signals as a unique fused stimulus following learning trials."

The rat is an important animal model for human disease research. Using inhibitors of glycogen synthase kinase 3 and MAPK signaling pathways, rat embryonic stem cells and rat induced pluripotent stem cells (riPSCs) have been derived. However, unlike rat embryonic stem cells, germ line competent riPSCs have only been derived from Wistar rats at low efficiency. Here, we found that an optimized induction medium containing knock-out serum replacement and vitamin C improved the rate and efficiency of riPSCs generation from Dark Agouti rat fibroblasts and Sertoli cells. riPSCs maintained an undifferentiated status for >30 passages and could differentiate into various cells types including germ cells when injected into rat blastocysts. Moreover, transgenic riPSCs could be generated through the PiggyBac transposon, which could be used to generate transgenic rats through germ line transmission. riPSCs can be used as a novel tool in genetic and genomic studies of the rat. Background: Rat induced pluripotent stem cells (riPSCs) failed to produce transgenic rats. Results: We found that an optimized induction medium improved the efficiency of iPSC generation from rat somatic cells. The riPSCs could successfully generate transgenic rats. Conclusion: We could generate high quality riPSCs that could be used to produce transgenic rats. Significance: RiPSCs can be used as a novel tool in genetic and genomic studies of the rat. Somatic cells can be reprogrammed into pluripotent stem cells by forced expression of the four Yamanaka factors (Oct4, Sox2, Klf4 and c-Myc) (1Takahashi K. Yamanaka S.

They are a promising resource for cell replacement therapy with lower or no immune rejection after transplantation (3Zhao T. Zhang Z.N. Rong Z. Xu Y.

Generation of healthy mice from gene-corrected disease-specific induced pluripotent stem cells.PLoS Biol. 2011; 9: e1001099Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However, the efficiency of iPSC generation is extremely low and accompanied by wide variation of the quality of iPSC colonies, which may hinder iPSC applications. The rat is used as an important model of human diseases, especially those of the neural and cardiac systems, because of similar physiological features (9Jacob H.J. Kwitek A.E. Rat genetics: attaching physiology and pharmacology to the genome.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2002; 3: 33-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). In addition, the efficiency of small organ transplantation in mice is extremely low, which hinders regenerative medicine research in mice. When using rat iPSCs (riPSCs) to generate large organs, testing the function of the transplanted organ in the rat will be easier and more consistent. However, unlike in the mouse that can be used to generate transgenic animals with embryonic stem (ES) cells and iPSCs, the use of pluripotent stem cells to generate transgenic rats has only been successful using rat ES cells. riPSCs can be generated from the somatic cells of Wistar, Dark Agouti (DA), Fischer 344 (F344) and Brown Norway rats, which differentiate into the three germ layers in teratomas and chimeric rats (10Liao J. Cui C. Chen S. Ren J. Chen J. Gao Y. Li H. Jia N. Cheng L. Xiao H. Xiao L.

However, only Wistar riPSCs can contribute to the germ line of chimeric rats (12Hamanaka S. Yamaguchi T. Kobayashi T. Kato-Itoh M. Yamazaki S. Sato H. Umino A. Wakiyama Y. Arai M. Sanbo M.

Whether live rats with germ line transmission can be obtained from iPSCs of strains other than the Wistar rat is unclear. Moreover, similar to rat ES cells, whether riPSCs can be used to generate transgenic rats is unknown (13Tong C. Li P. Wu N.L. Yan Y. Ying Q.L.

Efficient and rapid generation of induced pluripotent stem cells using an alternative culture medium.Cell Res. 2010; 20: 383-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), but few studies have focused on riPSCs. Previous reports have shown that knock-out serum replacement (KOSR) and vitamin C (Vc) can improve mouse iPSC generation. On the other hand, whether combined use of KOSR and Vc can facilitate riPSC generation is unclear. Here, we optimized an induction system that combined KOSR and Vc to improve riPSC generation from both DA rat fibroblasts and Sertoli cells. The riPSCs expressed pluripotency markers and could differentiate into various cell types including germ cells. We also generated transgenic rats using these riPSCs, which provides a new approach to generate rat disease models. DA, Sprague-Dawley (SD) and F344 rats and CF-1 mice were purchased from Vital River Laboratories, Beijing, China, and maintained in a specific pathogen-free environment. All experiments were performed in accordance with the Beijing Animal Protection Laws of China. Rat embryonic fibroblasts (REFs) derived from an embryonic day (E)14.5 DA rat fetus were cultured with DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), nonessential amino acids, l-glutamine, and penicillin-streptomycin. riPSCs were cultured in 6-well plates on feeder cells (mitomycin-C-treated mouse embryonic fibroblasts) and in N2B27 medium supplemented with rat recombinant leukemia inhibitor factor (rLIF) and 2i (3 μm GSK3 inhibitor CHIR99021 and 1 μm MEK inhibitor PD0325901). Vc (10 μg/ml) and 10% KOSR were added to the medium as indicated. riPSCs were subcultured every 2–3 days. The lentiviral vector 4F2A (Addgene) was used to reprogram REFs. At 48 h after transfection of 293 cells, supernatants containing virus particles were harvested, filtered, and subjected to ultracentrifugation for concentration. REFs were plated at 2 × 105 cells/35-mm culture dish at 1 day prior to infection. doxycycline (2 μg/ml) and Polybrene (4 μg/ml) were added on the first day of infection (day 0), and rLIF was added to the medium on day 1. Infected REFs were seeded onto a feeder layer in N2B27 medium containing doxycycline, rLIF, Vc, and 10% KOSR on day 2. On day 3.5, 2i was added to the medium, and ES cell-like colonies appeared from day 4.5. Colonies with a typical dome shape were picked up at day 5.5–6.5 and expanded in N2B27 medium containing 2i and rLIF. Immunofluorescence staining was performed as described previously (18Zhao X. Lv Z. Liu L. Wang L. Tong M. Zhou Q. Derivation of embryonic stem cells from Brown Norway rats blastocysts.J. Genet. Genomics. 2010; 37: 467-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Primary antibodies against the following markers were used: Oct4 (1:100; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Sox2 (1:100; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Nanog (1:100; Millipore), SSEA-1 (1:100; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and Esrrb (1:100; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies were purchased from Jackson Laboratory. DNA was stained with Hoechst 33342. AP staining was performed with an alkaline phosphatase kit (Sigma) following the manufacturer's instructions. An Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-SSEA-1 monoclonal antibody (Millipore) was used according to the manufacturer's instruction. At day 6 postinfection, SSEA-1-positive cell populations were analyzed by flow cytometry. Western blotting was performed as described previously (19Li W. Shuai L. Wan H. Dong M. Wang M. Sang L. Feng C. Luo G.Z. Li T. Li X. Wang L. Zheng Q.Y. Sheng C. Wu H.J. Liu Z. Liu L. Wang L. Wang X.J. Zhao X.Y. Zhou Q. Androgenetic haploid embryonic stem cells produce live transgenic mice.Nature. 2012; 490: 407-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Protein samples were extracted from rat ES cells (DA5-3), riPSCs (riPS-1 and riPS-2), and REFs. Primary antibodies against the following molecules were used: Oct4 (1:100; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Nanog (1:100; Millipore), Sox2 (1:100; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and α-tubulin (1:1000; Sigma), followed by a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:1000; WAKO). Genomic DNA and total RNA were extracted by a MicroElute Genomic DNA Kit (Omega) and TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), respectively, according to the manufacturers' instructions. cDNA was synthesized from 2 μg of total RNA using Super Script III RT (Invitrogen) and an oligo(dT) primer (Promega). Q-PCR analysis was performed using SYBR Green Real-time PCR Master Mix (Toyobo) in triplicate. Gene expression levels were normalized to expression of the housekeeping gene β-actin. PCR primers are listed in supplemental Table S1. Genomic DNA (200 ng) from each sample was treated with a Methylamp DNA modification sample kit (Epigentek) to convert cytosine to uracil according to the manufacturer's instructions. The promoter and enhancer regions of Oct4 were amplified by PCR using EX TaqHS, cloned into the PMD-18-T vector, and sequenced with M13 reverse and forward primers. PCR primers are listed in supplemental Table S1. For teratoma formation, 2 × 106 riPSCs cells were subcutaneously injected into severe combined immune deficiency (SCID) mice. Teratomas were collected after approximately 4 weeks and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for paraffin embedding and hematoxylin and eosin staining following standard procedures. Ten to 15 riPSCs cells were injected into blastocysts collected from the uterus of 4.5 days postcoitum female F344 rats followed by transfer into the uterine horns of E3.5 pseudopregnant female SD rats. Chimeric rats and germ line-transmitted rats were identified by coat color. Red fluorescence protein (RFP) was detected by an IVIS Spectrum system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). SSLP analysis was used to determine rat strains. DNA samples were extracted from riPSCs and the tails of littermates and chimeric rats. Tail DNA from DA, F344, and SD rats was used for the controls. The primer sequences are described in The National Bio Resource Project for the Rat in Japan. Approximately 1 × 106 riPSCs were electroporated with 4.5 μg of PiggyBac vector (PiggyBac plasmid with an EF1α promoter-driven DsRed-IRES-neor cassette) and 1.5 μg of PBase vector (PiggyBac integrase) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Electroporated cells were cultured in N2B27 medium (without antibiotics) containing 5% KOSR and 200 μg/ml G418. Neomycin-resistant colonies exhibiting RFP fluorescence were picked up and transferred to 4-well plates after 7 days of selection. Genital ridges from E15.5 fetuses were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight and embedded in paraffin. Fixed sections were permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS at room temperature for 30 min and then incubated with 2% BSA/PBS (w/v) for 1 h at room temperature for blocking. Sections were incubated with a primary rabbit anti-DDX4/mouse vasa homolog antibody (1:500; Abcam) overnight at 4 °C and then an Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (1:400; Jackson Laboratory) for 1 h at room temperature. Hoechst 33342 was used for nuclear staining. Sections were observed under a confocal laser scanning microscope. To test the combinatorial effects of KOSR and Vc on riPSC induction, DA REFs were transfected with the four Yamanaka factors to generate riPSCs (Fig. 1, A and B). At 36 h postinfection, REFs with marked morphological changes were subcultured onto dishes containing mouse embryonic fibroblast feeder cells and cultured with riPSC induction medium supplemented with or without KOSR and Vc (KOSR-Vc group versus control group). ES cell-like colonies appeared at day 4.5 postinfection, and colonies with a typical stem cell morphology were picked up at 5.5 days in the KOSR-Vc group (Fig. 1C). AP staining was performed to detect the positive number of primary riPSC colonies. The results showed that the number of AP-positive colonies in the KOSR-Vc group was almost 12-fold (459 versus 42) higher than that in the control without KOSR and Vc at day 5.5, and 8-fold higher (988 versus 124) than that in the control at day 7.5 postinfection (Fig. 1, D and E). We performed live staining of SSEA-1 to determine the percentage of SSEA-1-positive cells among induced cells by flow cytometry. The percentage of SSEA-1-positive cells in the KOSR-Vc group was approximately 6-fold more than that in the control group at day 5.5 postinfection (3.45% versus 0.55%) (Fig. 1F). In addition, pluripotency markers SSEA-1 and Esrrb detected by immunofluorescence showed strong expression in the KOSR-Vc group, whereas weak staining was observed in the control group at day 5.5 postinfection (Fig. 1G). Q-PCR analysis of Esrrb and Nanog expression showed 4- and 6-fold higher expression in the KOSR-Vc group than that in the control group at day 5.5, respectively (Fig. 1, H and I). These data suggest that KOSR and Vc improves riPSC generation. To date, this result is the most rapid reprogramming of riPSCs with very high efficiency. We picked up a total of nine colonies in three repeated experiments at day 5.5 postinfection and established seven stable riPSC lines (seven of nine, 77.8%) that were expanded for >30 passages. Two riPSC lines, riPS-1 and riPS-2, were randomly selected to perform subsequent experiments. We also generated four cell lines from eight riPSC colonies (riPS-c1, riPS-c2, riPS-c3, and riPS-c4; four of eight, 50%) at day 8.5 postinfection from the control group without KOSR and Vc. A rat ES cell line (DA5-3), which had previously shown germ line contribution, and REFs were chosen as positive and negative controls, respectively. RT-PCR analysis showed that the four Yamanaka factors were silenced in the two riPSC lines, whereas endogenous Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc were reactivated (Fig. 2A). Karyotyping showed that the riPSCs had a normal karyotype of 42 (Fig. 2B). The riPSCs were AP-positive (Fig. 2C). RT-PCR and Q-PCR analyses showed that key marker genes of pluripotency (Oct4, Sox2, Nanog, and Rex1) were highly expressed in riPSCs (Fig. 2, D and E). Western blotting and immunofluorescence confirmed a similar expression pattern of pluripotency markers (Fig. 2, F and G). Bisulfite sequencing results showed that the DNA methylation status of the enhancer and promoter regions of Oct4 were hypomethylated in riPSCs and the rat ES cell control, whereas they were hypermethylated in REFs (Fig. 2H). Taken together, riPSCs exhibited the characteristics of pluripotent stem cells at the molecular level. We further tested the feasibility of reprogramming adult somatic cells. Tail tip fibroblasts from 20-week-old DA rats were reprogrammed to riPSCs (Fig. 3A). ES cell-like colonies with morphologically typical features appeared under the KOSR-Vc condition at day 5.5 (Fig. 3B). Karyotyping, AP staining, and immunofluorescence showed that these riPSCs had a normal karyotype and were characterized as pluripotent stem cells (Fig. 3, C–E). Passage 3 Sertoli cells, an interstitial cell type in a terminally differentiated state, were also isolated and transfected with the four Yamanaka factors (Fig. 3F). Morphologically ES cell-like colonies were picked up and expanded at day 5.5 postinfection (Fig. 3G). Karyotype analysis, AP staining, and immunofluorescence indicated that the reprogramming process was completed in these iPSCs (Fig. 3, H–J). Thus, the KOSR-Vc combination robustly generates riPSCs from adult somatic cells. To determine the differentiation capacity of riPSCs, we allowed riPSCs to differentiate as embryoid bodies and evaluated the expression of differentiation marker genes by RT-PCR (Fig. 4A). We detected the expression of marker genes of the three germ layers, such as Nestin and Pax6 (ectoderm), Gata4 and Sox17 (primitive endoderm), AFP (endoderm), and Flk1 (mesoderm), whereas only slight residual expression of Oct4 similar to that in the DA ES cell control was detected at day 8 of differentiation (Fig. 4B). Next, we examined the differentiation capacity of riPSCs in vivo. riPSCs (2 × 106) were subcutaneously injected into SCID mice and assessed after 4 weeks. Histological examination showed that teratomas contained derivatives of the three germ layers (Fig. 4C). These results indicated that riPSCs could differentiate into the three germ layers. We also performed a more stringent pluripotency assay by examining chimeric rats. riPSCs from the riPS1–6 cell line (DA background and Agouti coat color) were injected into F344 blastocysts (white coat color) and then transferred to SD pseudopregnant females to generate chimeras. A total of 72 chimeras were obtained among 132 live pups born (Table 1). Most of the chimeric rats had a high percentage of riPSCs contribution as determined by coat color chimerism (>85%, Fig. 4D). The SSLP assay confirmed the riPSC contribution (Fig. 4E). As shown in Table 1, four riPSC lines (riPS-c1, riPS-c2, riPS-c3, and riPS-c4) from the control group were also injected into F344 blastocysts under the same condition, and 14 chimeras were obtained among 47 live pups born.TABLE 1Generation of chimeras and germ line-competent offspring from riPSCsCell linePassage no.No. of injected blastocystPupsChimeras (survival)Germ line transmissionriPS-192063 (2)3riPS-213, 1756106 (3)NTaNT, not tested.riPS-311, 134095 (3)3riPS-4121674 (2)0bNo germ line transmission.riPS-511–311949653 (37)1riPS-6143341 (1)NTriPS-c112, 1741103 (2)1riPS-c2152171 (0)NTriPS-c313, 1854156 (2)0bNo germ line transmission.riPS-c419, 2663154 (2)0bNo germ line transmission.riPS-tg-113–28242cThree pseudopregnant female SD rats with 42 transferred blastocysts were killed by cervical dislocation to test for germ line contribution of riPSCs.

Twelve fetuses were obtained, and eight fetuses with black eyes were examined. Open table in a new tab We next explored whether these riPSCs could contribute to the germ line. Ten chimeras from four cell lines (riPS-1, riPS-3, riPS-4, and riPS-5, obtained 2, 3, 2, 3 chimeras, respectively), among which six showed a high level of chimerism, were mated with SD rats (white coat color), resulting in seven germ line transmission rats originating from three riPSC lines (riPS-1, riPS-3, and riPS-5) (Fig. 4F and Table 1). However, six chimeras from control riPSCs (riPS-c1, riPS-c3, and riPS-c4) only produced one germ line transmission rat (riPS-c1) (Table 1). The presence of transgenic Yamanaka factors in the DA genome (Fig. 4G) was confirmed by genomic PCR and showed that riPSCs contributed to the germ line. Moreover, germ line transmission rats (DA × SD background) produced healthy progenies (Fig. 4, H and I). In summary, these data showed that the riPSCs were pluripotent stem cells, especially the iPSCs induced with KOSR and Vc, which showed a robust potential to contribute to the germ line. To explore the feasibility of using riPSCs to generate transgenic rats, RFP and neor genes driven by the EF1α promoter through PiggyBac transposons were electroporated into two riPSC lines (riPS-1 and riPS-2) to generate RFP transgenic riPSCs (Fig. 5A). After G418 selection for 1 week, two surviving clones expressing RFP were randomly picked up for expansion (riPS-tg-1 and riPS-tg-2; Fig. 5B). Next, we injected diploid blastocysts with transgenic riPSCs. RFP-positive chimeric fetuses were harvested at E15.5, in which RFP-positive cells had widely contributed to multiple organs and tissues including the genital ridges (Fig. 5, C–E). Further analysis by immunofluorescence staining revealed mouse vasa homolog- and RFP-double positive cells within the germ line of the fetus, demonstrating the germ line contribution of RFP-positive riPSCs (Fig. 5F). Thirty-four full-term chimeric pups were obtained at day 21.5 (Fig. 5G). All chimeras exhibited an Agouti white inlaid coat color. Five adult chimeric rats from riPS-tg-1 (three males and two females) were mated with SD rats (white coat color) to test for germ line transmission. Three offspring with the Agouti color and RFP expression were obtained, indicating the competency of germ line contribution of transgenic riPSCs (Fig. 5H). We next performed genomic PCR analysis with primers designed to detect the EF1α promoter plus neor and RFP genes. The data showed that germ line transmission rats inherited the transgene originating from transgenic riPSCs (Fig. 5I). We further tested whether somatic cells from transgenic rats could be induced to pluripotent stem cells by directly adding doxycycline. Ear fibroblasts from a 1-month-old transgenic rat were isolated (Fig. 5J), and doxycycline was added daily for reprogramming. ES cell-like colonies with RFP expression emerged by day 5 (Fig. 5K). Karyotype analysis showed a normal number of chromosomes (2N = 42) (Fig. 5L). AP staining was performed to demonstrate the pluripotent state of riPSCs (Fig. 5M). Taken together, these data show that transgenic riPSCs can produce transgenic rats through germ line transmission. In this study, we showed that KOSR combined with Vc robustly improves the generation of riPSCs. The riPSCs possessed all the key features of rat ES cells, such as expression of pluripotency markers and contribution to multiple tissues including the germ line. Through germ line transmission, transgenic riPSCs produced transgenic rats. The combination of KOSR and VC increased the rate and efficiency of riPSC generation. We have shown previously that a high concentration of KOSR instead of FBS can be used for efficient and rapid generation of mouse iPSCs (2Zhao X.Y. Li W. Lv Z. Liu L. Tong M. Hai T. Hao J. Guo C.L.

Efficient and rapid generation of induced pluripotent stem cells using an alternative culture medium.Cell Res. 2010; 20: 383-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Moreover, Vc is an antioxidant that increases the proliferation of fibroblasts in the intermediate phase of reprogramming by alleviating cell senescence through a reduction of p53 levels and maintenance of intact DNA repair machinery (16Esteban M.A. Wang T. Qin B. Yang J. Qin D. Cai J. Li W. Weng Z. Chen J. Ni S. Chen K. Li Y. Liu X. Xu J. Zhang S. Li F. He W. Labuda K. Song Y. Peterbauer A. Wolbank S. Redl H. Zhong M. Cai D. Zeng L. Pei D. Vitamin C enhances the generation of mouse and human induced pluripotent stem cells.Cell Stem Cell. 2010; 6: 71-79Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar). Using a combination of KOSR and Vc, we rapidly generated riPSCs at high efficiency from both fibroblasts and Sertoli cells. However, the detailed mechanism needs further investigation in the future. Using the optimized induction system, we efficiently generated iPSCs from DA rat somatic cells. In addition, the riPSCs contributed to the germ line after blastocyst injection. Previous reports have shown that germ line-competent riPSCs can only be derived from Wistar background somatic cells with a recessive coat color. The present study provides the alternative of DA riPSCs for use in research. Compared with control iPSCs, the iPSCs generated with KOSR and Vc contributed more efficiently to the germ line, indicating that KOSR and Vc also improve the quality of riPSCs by reducing the variation of colonies. Using this robust reprogramming system, we can conveniently derive riPSCs with other backgrounds. This is the first report demonstrating that riPSCs can produce transgenic rats. This approach will be useful to study the mechanisms of diseases in rat models. However, the virus integration may have some negative effects. Generation of integration-free riPSCs from rat somatic cells and subsequent production of genetically modified rats with these riPSCs still require further study. This novel approach may improve the application of rat disease models and regenerative medicine in the future.

The antitumor activities of 31 RES derivatives, including dimers, trimers, and tetramers of RES, were evaluated using cell-based assays and validated on a murine model. Several trimeric and a tetrameric stilbenoids induced tumor cell apoptosis or growth arrest of several tumor cell lines with IC50 values (2.8–19.7 μM), significantly lower than that of RES (IC50>70 μM). Using pauciflorol B (PauB) as an example, we showed that the compound induced apoptosis p53 dependently, inducing p53 accumulation and p53-modulated gene expression in cells with wild-type p53, but not in those with nonfunctional p53. Reexpression of p53 in p53-null cells rescued cell death response. In parallel, the MAPK/p38 was activated and critical for PauB-induced killing. Interestingly, activation of p38 in p53 deficient cells was sufficient to drive cells into senescence via the p16–pRb pathway. Finally, PauB dose-dependently inhibited tumor growth on nude mice. Naturally occurring trimeric and tetrameric stilbenoids are potent antitumor agents. Those compounds exert antitumor effect through p53-dependent induction of apoptosis or senescence.—Qiao, H., Chen, X., Xu, L., Wang, J., Zhao, G., Hou, Y., Ge, H. M., Tan, R-X., Li, E.

https://openalex.org/W2105589713,"In the USA, the relationship between the legal availability of guns and the firearm-related homicide rate has been debated. It has been argued that unrestricted gun availability promotes the occurrence of firearm-induced homicides. It has also been pointed out that gun possession can protect potential victims when attacked. This paper provides a first mathematical analysis of this tradeoff, with the goal to steer the debate towards arguing about assumptions, statistics, and scientific methods. The model is based on a set of clearly defined assumptions, which are supported by available statistical data, and is formulated axiomatically such that results do not depend on arbitrary mathematical expressions. According to this framework, two alternative scenarios can minimize the gun-related homicide rate: a ban of private firearms possession, or a policy allowing the general population to carry guns. Importantly, the model identifies the crucial parameters that determine which policy minimizes the death rate, and thus serves as a guide for the design of future epidemiological studies. The parameters that need to be measured include the fraction of offenders that illegally possess a gun, the degree of protection provided by gun ownership, and the fraction of the population who take up their right to own a gun and carry it when attacked. Limited data available in the literature were used to demonstrate how the model can be parameterized, and this preliminary analysis suggests that a ban of private firearm possession, or possibly a partial reduction in gun availability, might lower the rate of firearm-induced homicides. This, however, should not be seen as a policy recommendation, due to the limited data available to inform and parameterize the model. However, the model clearly defines what needs to be measured, and provides a basis for a scientific discussion about assumptions and data."
