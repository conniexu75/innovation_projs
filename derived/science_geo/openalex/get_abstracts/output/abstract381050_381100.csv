https://openalex.org/W2082704291,"Background Age-related physiological changes in the gastrointestinal tract, as well as modifications in lifestyle, nutritional behaviour, and functionality of the host immune system, inevitably affect the gut microbiota, resulting in a greater susceptibility to infections. Methodology/Principal Findings By using the Human Intestinal Tract Chip (HITChip) and quantitative PCR of 16S rRNA genes of Bacteria and Archaea, we explored the age-related differences in the gut microbiota composition among young adults, elderly, and centenarians, i.e subjects who reached the extreme limits of the human lifespan, living for over 100 years. We observed that the microbial composition and diversity of the gut ecosystem of young adults and seventy-years old people is highly similar but differs significantly from that of the centenarians. After 100 years of symbiotic association with the human host, the microbiota is characterized by a rearrangement in the Firmicutes population and an enrichment in facultative anaerobes, notably pathobionts. The presence of such a compromised microbiota in the centenarians is associated with an increased inflammatory status, also known as inflammageing, as determined by a range of peripheral blood inflammatory markers. This may be explained by a remodelling of the centenarians' microbiota, with a marked decrease in Faecalibacterium prauznitzii and relatives, symbiotic species with reported anti-inflammatory properties. As signature bacteria of the long life we identified specifically Eubacterium limosum and relatives that were more than ten-fold increased in the centenarians. Conclusions/Significance We provide evidence for the fact that the ageing process deeply affects the structure of the human gut microbiota, as well as its homeostasis with the host's immune system. Because of its crucial role in the host physiology and health status, age-related differences in the gut microbiota composition may be related to the progression of diseases and frailty in the elderly population."
https://openalex.org/W2057549495,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are approximately 22-nt small non-coding regulatory RNAs that have generally been considered to regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level in the cytoplasm. However, recent studies have reported that some miRNAs localize to and function in the nucleus.To determine the number of miRNAs localized to the nucleus, we systematically investigated the subcellular distribution of small RNAs (sRNAs) by independent deep sequencing sequenced of the nuclear and cytoplasmic pools of 18- to 30-nucleotide sRNAs from human cells. We identified 339 nuclear and 324 cytoplasmic known miRNAs, 300 of which overlap, suggesting that the majority of miRNAs are imported into the nucleus. With the exception of a few miRNAs evidently enriched in the nuclear pool, such as the mir-29b, the ratio of miRNA abundances in the nuclear fraction versus in the cytoplasmic fraction vary to some extent. Moreover, our results revealed that a large number of tRNA 3' trailers are exported from the nucleus and accumulate in the cytoplasm. These tRNA 3' trailers accumulate in a variety of cell types, implying that the biogenesis of tRNA 3' trailers is conserved and that they have a potential functional role in vertebrate cells.Our results provide the first comprehensive view of the subcellular distribution of diverse sRNAs and new insights into the roles of miRNAs and tRNA 3' trailers in the cell."
https://openalex.org/W2123962115,"Background Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has a dismal prognosis. The high risk of recurrence following surgical resection provides the rationale for adjuvant therapy. However, only a subset of patients benefit from adjuvant therapy. Identification of molecular markers to predict treatment outcome is therefore warranted. The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether expression of novel candidate biomarkers, including microRNAs, can predict clinical outcome in PDAC patients treated with adjuvant therapy. Methodology/Principal Findings Formalin-fixed paraffin embedded specimens from a cohort of 82 resected Korean PDAC cases were analyzed for protein expression by immunohistochemistry and for microRNA expression using quantitative Real-Time PCR. Cox proportional hazards model analysis in the subgroup of patients treated with adjuvant therapy (N = 52) showed that lower than median miR-21 expression was associated with a significantly lower hazard ratio (HR) for death (HR = 0.316; 95%CI = 0.166–0.600; P = 0.0004) and recurrence (HR = 0.521; 95%CI = 0.280–0.967; P = 0.04). MiR-21 expression status emerged as the single most predictive biomarker for treatment outcome among all 27 biological and 9 clinicopathological factors evaluated. No significant association was detected in patients not treated with adjuvant therapy. In an independent validation cohort of 45 frozen PDAC tissues from Italian cases, all treated with adjuvant therapy, lower than median miR-21 expression was confirmed to be correlated with longer overall as well as disease-free survival. Furthermore, transfection with anti-miR-21 enhanced the chemosensitivity of PDAC cells. Conclusions Significance Low miR-21 expression was associated with benefit from adjuvant treatment in two independent cohorts of PDAC cases, and anti-miR-21 increased anticancer drug activity in vitro. These data provide evidence that miR-21 may allow stratification for adjuvant therapy, and represents a new potential target for therapy in PDAC."
https://openalex.org/W2091613784,"Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a dimeric glycoprotein that plays a crucial role in microvascular complications of diabetes, including diabetic nephropathy. However, the precise regulatory mechanisms governing VEGF expression in the diabetic milieu are still poorly understood. Here, we provide evidence that microRNA-93 (miR-93) regulates VEGF expression in experimental models of diabetes both in vitro and in vivo. Comparative microRNA expression profile arrays identified miR-93 as a signature microRNA in hyperglycemic conditions. We identified VEGF-A as a putative target of miR-93 in the kidney with a perfect complementarity between miR-93 and the 3'-untranslated region of vegfa in several species. When cotransfected with a luciferase reporter construct containing the mouse vegfa 3'-untranslated region, expression of miR-93 markedly decreased the luciferase activity. We showed that forced expression of miR-93 in cells abrogated VEGF protein secretion. Conversely, anti-miR-93 inhibitors increased VEGF release. Transfection of miR-93 also prevented the effect of high glucose on VEGF downstream targets. Using transgenic mice containing VEGF-LacZ bicistronic transcripts, we found that inhibition of glomerular miR-93 by peptide-conjugated morpholino oligomers elicited increased expression of VEGF. Our findings also indicate that high glucose decreases miR-93 expression by down-regulating the promoter of the host MCM7 gene. Taken together, our findings provide new insights into the role of miR-93 in VEGF signaling pathway and offer a potentially novel target in preventing the progression of diabetic nephropathy."
https://openalex.org/W2101476524,"Small heat shock proteins (sHsps) are molecular chaperones involved in maintaining protein homeostasis; they have also been implicated in protein folding diseases and in cancer. In this protein family, a conserved core domain, the so-called α-crystallin or Hsp20 domain, is flanked by highly variable, nonconserved sequences that are essential for chaperone function. Analysis of 8714 sHsps revealed a broad variation of primary sequences within the superfamily as well as phyla-dependent differences. Significant variations were found in the number of sHsps per genome, their amino acid composition, and the length distribution of the different sequence parts. Reconstruction of the evolutionary tree for the sHsp superfamily shows that the flanking regions fall into several subgroups, indicating that they were remodeled several times in parallel but independent of the evolution of the α-crystallin domain. The evolutionary history of sHsps is thus set apart from that of other protein families in that two exon boundary-independent strategies are combined: the evolution of the conserved α-crystallin domain and the independent evolution of the N- and C-terminal sequences. This scenario allows for increased variability in specific small parts of the protein and thus promotes functional and structural differentiation of sHsps, which is not reflected in the general evolutionary tree of species."
https://openalex.org/W1987486422,"Background The proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) is an important factor in the etiology of familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and is also an attractive therapeutic target to reduce low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. PCSK9 accelerates the degradation of hepatic low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and low levels of hepatic PCSK9 activity are associated with reduced levels of circulating LDL-cholesterol. Methodology/Principal Findings The present study presents the first evidence for the efficacy of a locked nucleic acid (LNA) antisense oligonucleotide (LNA ASO) that targets both human and mouse PCSK9. We employed human hepatocytes derived cell lines HepG2 and HuH7 and a pancreatic mouse β-TC3 cell line known to express high endogenous levels of PCSK9. LNA ASO efficiently reduced the mRNA and protein levels of PCSK9 with a concomitant increase in LDLR protein levels after transfection in these cells. In vivo efficacy of LNA ASO was further investigated in mice by tail vein intravenous administration of LNA ASO in saline solution. The level of PCSK9 mRNA was reduced by ∼60%, an effect lasting more than 16 days. Hepatic LDLR protein levels were significantly up-regulated by 2.5–3 folds for at least 8 days and ∼2 fold for 16 days. Finally, measurement of liver alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels revealed that long term LNA ASO treatment (7 weeks) does not cause hepatotoxicity. Conclusion/Significance LNA-mediated PCSK9 mRNA inhibition displayed potent reduction of PCSK9 in cell lines and mouse liver. Our data clearly revealed the efficacy and safety of LNA ASO in reducing PCSK9 levels, an approach that is now ready for testing in primates. The major significance and take home message of this work is the development of a novel and promising approach for human therapeutic intervention of the PCSK9 pathway and hence for reducing some of the cardiovascular risk factors associated with the metabolic syndrome."
https://openalex.org/W2047666011,"Background Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is the most common kidney cancer. The purpose of this study is to define a biological pathway signature and a cellular differentiation program in ccRCC. Methodology We performed gene expression profiling of early-stage ccRCC and patient-matched normal renal tissue using Affymetrix HG-U133a and HG-U133b GeneChips combined with a comprehensive bioinformatic analyses, including pathway analysis. The results were validated by real time PCR and IHC on two independent sample sets. Cellular differentiation experiments were performed on ccRCC cell lines and their matched normal renal epithelial cells, in differentiation media, to determine their mesenchymal differentiation potential. Principal Findings We identified a unique pathway signature with three major biological alterations—loss of normal renal function, down-regulated metabolism, and immune activation–which revealed an adipogenic gene expression signature linked to the hallmark lipid-laden clear cell morphology of ccRCC. Culturing normal renal and ccRCC cells in differentiation media showed that only ccRCC cells were induced to undergo adipogenic and, surprisingly, osteogenic differentiation. A gene expression signature consistent with epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) was identified for ccRCC. We revealed significant down-regulation of four developmental transcription factors (GATA3, TFCP2L1, TFAP2B, DMRT2) that are important for normal renal development. Conclusions ccRCC is characterized by a lack of epithelial differentiation, mesenchymal/adipogenic transdifferentiation, and pluripotent mesenchymal stem cell-like differentiation capacity in vitro. We suggest that down-regulation of developmental transcription factors may mediate the aberrant differentiation in ccRCC. We propose a model in which normal renal epithelial cells undergo dedifferentiation, EMT, and adipogenic transdifferentiation, resulting in ccRCC. Because ccRCC cells grown in adipogenic media regain the characteristic ccRCC phenotype, we have indentified a new in vitro ccRCC cell model more resembling ccRCC tumor morphology."
https://openalex.org/W2075877033,"Nipah virus (NiV) is an enigmatic emerging pathogen that causes severe and often fatal neurologic and/or respiratory disease in both animals and humans. Amongst people, case fatality rates range between 40 and 75 percent and there are no vaccines or treatments approved for human use. Guinea pigs, hamsters, cats, ferrets, pigs and most recently squirrel monkeys (New World monkey) have been evaluated as animal models of human NiV infection, and with the exception of the ferret, no model recapitulates all aspects of NiV-mediated disease seen in humans. To identify a more viable nonhuman primate (NHP) model, we examined the pathogenesis of NiV in African green monkeys (AGM). Exposure of eight monkeys to NiV produced a severe systemic infection in all eight animals with seven of the animals succumbing to infection. Viral RNA was detected in the plasma of challenged animals and occurred in two of three subjects as a peak between days 7 and 21, providing the first clear demonstration of plasma-associated viremia in NiV experimentally infected animals and suggested a progressive infection that seeded multiple organs simultaneously from the initial site of virus replication. Unlike the cat, hamster and squirrel monkey models of NiV infection, severe respiratory pathology, neurological disease and generalized vasculitis all manifested in NiV-infected AGMs, providing an accurate reflection of what is observed in NiV-infected humans. Our findings demonstrate the first consistent and highly pathogenic NHP model of NiV infection, providing a new and critical platform in the evaluation and licensure of either passive and active immunization or therapeutic strategies for human use."
https://openalex.org/W2161266187,"Clostridium difficile toxin A (TcdA) and toxin B (TcdB), C. sordellii lethal toxin (TcsL) and C. novyi α-toxin (TcnA) are important pathogenicity factors, which represent the family of the clostridial glucosylating toxins (CGTs). Toxin A and B are associated with antibiotic-associated diarrhea and pseudomembraneous colitis. Lethal toxin is involved in toxic shock syndrome after abortion and α-toxin in gas gangrene development. CGTs enter cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis and require an acidified endosome for translocation of the catalytic domain into the cytosol. Here we studied the endocytic processes that mediate cell internalization of the CGTs. Intoxication of cells was monitored by analyzing cell morphology, status of Rac glucosylation in cell lysates and transepithelial resistance of cell monolayers. We found that the intoxication of cultured cells by CGTs was strongly delayed when cells were preincubated with dynasore, a cell-permeable inhibitor of dynamin, or chlorpromazine, an inhibitor of the clathrin-dependent endocytic pathway. Additional evidence about the role of clathrin in the uptake of the prototypical CGT family member toxin B was achieved by expression of a dominant-negative inhibitor of the clathrin-mediated endocytosis (Eps15 DN) or by siRNA against the clathrin heavy chain. Accordingly, cells that expressed dominant-negative caveolin-1 were not protected from toxin B-induced cell rounding. In addition, lipid rafts impairment by exogenous depletion of sphingomyelin did not decelerate intoxication of HeLa cells by CGTs. Taken together, our data indicate that the endocytic uptake of the CGTs involves a dynamin-dependent process that is mainly governed by clathrin."
https://openalex.org/W2042153549,"The ability of many viruses to manipulate the host antiviral immune response often results in complex host-pathogen interactions. In order to study the interaction of dengue virus (DENV) with the Aedes aegypti immune response, we have characterized the DENV infection-responsive transcriptome of the immune-competent A. aegypti cell line Aag2. As in mosquitoes, DENV infection transcriptionally activated the cell line Toll pathway and a variety of cellular physiological systems. Most notably, however, DENV infection down-regulated the expression levels of numerous immune signaling molecules and antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). Functional assays showed that transcriptional induction of AMPs from the Toll and IMD pathways in response to bacterial challenge is impaired in DENV-infected cells. In addition, Escherichia coli, a Gram-negative bacteria species, grew better when co-cultured with DENV-infected cells than with uninfected cells, suggesting a decreased production of AMPs from the IMD pathway in virus-infected cells. Pre-stimulation of the cell line with Gram-positive bacteria prior to DENV infection had no effect on DENV titers, while pre-stimulation with Gram-negative bacteria resulted in an increase in DENV titers. These results indicate that DENV is capable of actively suppressing immune responses in the cells it infects, a phenomenon that may have important consequences for virus transmission and insect physiology."
https://openalex.org/W2059928226,"Most acute infections with RNA viruses are transient and subsequently cleared from the host. Recent evidence, however, suggests that the RNA virus, West Nile virus (WNV), not only causes acute disease, but can persist long term in humans and animal models. Our goal in this study was to develop a mouse model of WNV persistence. We inoculated immunocompetent mice subcutaneously (s.c.) with WNV and examined their tissues for infectious virus and WNV RNA for 16 months (mo) post-inoculation (p.i.). Infectious WNV persisted for 1 mo p.i. in all mice and for 4 mo p.i. in 12% of mice, and WNV RNA persisted for up to 6 mo p.i. in 12% of mice. The frequency of persistence was tissue dependent and was in the following order: skin, spinal cord, brain, lymphoid tissues, kidney, and heart. Viral persistence occurred in the face of a robust antibody response and in the presence of inflammation in the brain. Furthermore, persistence in the central nervous system (CNS) and encephalitis were observed even in mice with subclinical infections. Mice were treated at 1 mo p.i. with cyclophosphamide, and active viral replication resulted, suggesting that lymphocytes are functional during viral persistence. In summary, WNV persisted in the CNS and periphery of mice for up to 6 mo p.i. in mice with subclinical infections. These results have implications for WNV-infected humans. In particular, immunosuppressed patients, organ transplantation, and long term sequelae may be impacted by WNV persistence."
https://openalex.org/W1966678292,"Several lines of evidence support that dopaminergic neurotransmission plays a role in creative thought and behavior. Here, we investigated the relationship between creative ability and dopamine D2 receptor expression in healthy individuals, with a focus on regions where aberrations in dopaminergic function have previously been associated with psychotic symptoms and a genetic liability to schizophrenia. Scores on divergent thinking tests (Inventiveness battery, Berliner Intelligenz Struktur Test) were correlated with regional D2 receptor densities, as measured by Positron Emission Tomography, and the radioligands [(11)C]raclopride and [(11)C]FLB 457. The results show a negative correlation between divergent thinking scores and D2 density in the thalamus, also when controlling for age and general cognitive ability. Hence, the results demonstrate that the D2 receptor system, and specifically thalamic function, is important for creative performance, and may be one crucial link between creativity and psychopathology. We suggest that decreased D2 receptor densities in the thalamus lower thalamic gating thresholds, thus increasing thalamocortical information flow. In healthy individuals, who do not suffer from the detrimental effects of psychiatric disease, this may increase performance on divergent thinking tests. In combination with the cognitive functions of higher order cortical networks, this could constitute a basis for the generative and selective processes that underlie real life creativity."
https://openalex.org/W2122441130,"Transfer of the melanocyte-specific and lysosome-related organelle, the melanosome, from melanocytes to keratinocytes is crucial for the protection of the skin against harmful ultraviolet radiation (UVR)—our main physiological cutaneous stressor. However, this commonplace event remains a most enigmatic process despite several early hypotheses. Recently, we and others have proposed a role for filopodia in melanin transfer, although conclusive experimental proof remained elusive. Using known filopodial markers (MyoX/Cdc42) and the filopodial disrupter, low-dose cytochalasin-B, we demonstrate here a requirement for filopodia in melanosome transfer from melanocytes to keratinocytes and also, unexpectedly, between keratinocytes. Melanin distribution throughout the skin represents the key phenotypic event in skin pigmentation. Melanocyte filopodia were also necessary for UVR-stimulated melanosome transfer, as this was also inhibited by MyoX knockdown and low-dose cytochalasin-B. Knockdown of keratinocyte MyoX protein, in its capacity as a phagocytosis effector, resulted in the inhibition of melanin uptake by keratinocytes. This indicates a central role for phagocytosis by keratinocytes of melanocyte filopodia. In summary, we propose a new model for the regulation of pigmentation in human skin cells under both constitutive and facultative (post-UVR) conditions, which we call the “filopodial-phagocytosis model.” This model also provides a unique and highly accessible way to study lysosome-related organelle movement between mammalian cells.—Singh, S. K., Kurfurst, R., Nizard, C., Schnebert, S., Perrier, E., Tobin, D. J.

https://openalex.org/W2014702974,"Polistes paper wasps are models for understanding conditions that may have characterized the origin of worker and queen castes and, therefore, the origin of paper wasp sociality. Polistes is “primitively eusocial” by virtue of having context-dependent caste determination and no morphological differences between castes. Even so, Polistes colonies have a temporal pattern in which most female larvae reared by the foundress become workers, and most reared by workers become future-reproductive gynes. This pattern is hypothesized to reflect development onto two pathways, which may utilize mechanisms that regulate diapause in other insects. Using expressed sequence tags (ESTs) for Polistes metricus we selected candidate genes differentially expressed in other insects in three categories: 1) diapause vs. non-diapause phenotypes and/or worker vs. queen differentiation, 2) behavioral subcastes of worker honey bees, and 3) no a priori expectation of a role in worker/gyne development. We also used a non-targeted proteomics screen to test for peptide/protein abundance differences that could reflect larval developmental divergence. We found that foundress-reared larvae (putative worker-destined) and worker-reared larvae (putative gyne-destined) differed in quantitative expression of sixteen genes, twelve of which were associated with caste and/or diapause in other insects, and they also differed in abundance of nine peptides/proteins. Some differentially-expressed genes are involved in diapause regulation in other insects, and other differentially-expressed genes and proteins are involved in the insulin signaling pathway, nutrient metabolism, and caste determination in highly social bees. Differential expression of a gene and a peptide encoding hexameric storage proteins is especially noteworthy. Although not conclusive, our results support hypotheses of 1) larval developmental pathway divergence that can lead to caste bias in adults and 2) nutritional differences as the foundation of the pathway divergence. Finally, the differential expression in Polistes larvae of genes and proteins also differentially expressed during queen vs. worker caste development in honey bees may indicate that regulatory mechanisms of caste outcomes share similarities between primitively eusocial and advanced eusocial Hymenoptera."
https://openalex.org/W2076317547,"Background A prevailing view is that audiovisual integration requires temporally coincident signals. However, a recent study failed to find any evidence for audiovisual integration in visual search even when using synchronized audiovisual events. An important question is what information is critical to observe audiovisual integration. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we demonstrate that temporal coincidence (i.e., synchrony) of auditory and visual components can trigger audiovisual interaction in cluttered displays and consequently produce very fast and efficient target identification. In visual search experiments, subjects found a modulating visual target vastly more efficiently when it was paired with a synchronous auditory signal. By manipulating the kind of temporal modulation (sine wave vs. square wave vs. difference wave; harmonic sine-wave synthesis; gradient of onset/offset ramps) we show that abrupt visual events are required for this search efficiency to occur, and that sinusoidal audiovisual modulations do not support efficient search. Conclusions/Significance Thus, audiovisual temporal alignment will only lead to benefits in visual search if the changes in the component signals are both synchronized and transient. We propose that transient signals are necessary in synchrony-driven binding to avoid spurious interactions with unrelated signals when these occur close together in time."
https://openalex.org/W2004985053,"Background Lyme disease, caused by various species of Borrelia, is transmitted by Ixodes ticks in North America and Europe. Studies have shown the genotype of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto (s.s.) or the species of B. burgdorferi sensu lato (s.l.) affects the ability of the bacteria to cause local or disseminated infection in humans. Methodology/Principal Findings We used a multilocus PCR electrospray mass spectrometry assay to determine the species and genotype Borrelia from ticks collected in New York, Connecticut, Indiana, Southern Germany, and California and characterized isolates from parts of the United States and Europe. These analyses identified 53 distinct genotypes of B. burgdorferi sensu stricto with higher resolution than ospC typing. Genotypes of other members of the B. burgdorferi sensu lato complex were also identified and genotyped including B. afzelii, B. garinii, B. lusitaniae, B. spielmanii, and B. valaisiana. While each site in North America had genotypes unique to that location, we found genotypes shared between individual regions and two genotypes found across the United States. Significant B. burgdorferi s.s. genotypic diversity was observed between North America and Europe: only 6.6% of US genotypes (3 of 45) were found in Europe and 27% of the European genotypes (3 of 11) were observed in the US. Interestingly, 39% of adult Ixodes scapularis ticks from North America were infected with more than one genotype of B. burgdorferi s.s. and 22.2% of Ixodes ricinus ticks from Germany were infected with more than one genotype of B. burgdorferi s.l. Conclusions/Significance The presence of multiple Borrelia genotypes in ticks increases the probability that a person will be infected with more than one genotype of B. burgdorferi, potentially increasing the risks of disseminated Lyme disease. Our study indicates that the genotypic diversity of Borrelia in ticks in both North America and Europe is higher then previously reported and can have potential clinical consequences."
https://openalex.org/W2132733207,"This study examined the effect of H(2)O(2) on the TRPC6 channel and its underlying mechanisms using a TRPC6 heterologous expression system. In TRPC6-expressing HEK293T cells, H(2)O(2) significantly stimulated Ca(2+) entry in a dose-dependent manner. Electrophysiological experiments showed that H(2)O(2) significantly increased TRPC6 channel open probability and whole-cell currents. H(2)O(2) also evoked a robust inward current in A7r5 vascular smooth muscle cells, which was nearly abolished by knockdown of TRPC6 using a small interfering RNA. Catalase substantially attenuated arginine vasopressin (AVP)-induced Ca(2+) entry in cells co-transfected with TRPC6 and AVP V1 receptor. N-Ethylmaleimide and thimerosal were able to simulate the H(2)O(2) response. Dithiothreitol or glutathione-reduced ethyl ester significantly antagonized the response. Furthermore, both N-ethylmaleimide- and H(2)O(2)-induced TRPC6 activations were only observed in the cell-attached patches but not in the inside-out patches. Moreover, 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol effect on TRPC6 was significantly greater in the presence of H(2)O(2). Biotinylation assays revealed a significant increase in cell surface TRPC6 in response to H(2)O(2). Similarly, in cells transfected with TRPC6-EGFP, confocal microscopy showed a significant increase in fluorescence intensity in the region of the cell membrane and adjacent to the membrane. AVP also increased the fluorescence intensity on the surface of the cells co-transfected with TRPC6-EGFP and V1 receptor, and this response was inhibited by catalase. These data indicate that H(2)O(2) activates TRPC6 channels via modification of thiol groups of intracellular proteins. This cysteine oxidation-dependent pathway not only stimulates the TRPC6 channel by itself but also sensitizes the channels to diacylglycerol and promotes TRPC6 trafficking to the cell surface."
https://openalex.org/W2031753305,"RelBE represents a typical bacterial toxin-antitoxin (TA) system. Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv, the pathogen responsible for human tuberculosis, contains three RelBE-like modules, RelBE, RelFG, and RelJK, which are at least partly expressed in human macrophages during infection. RelBE modules appear to be autoregulated in an atypical manner compared to other TA systems; however, the molecular mechanisms and potential interactions between different RelBE modules remain to be elucidated. In the present study, we characterized the interaction and cross-regulation of these Rel toxin-antitoxin modules from this unique pathogen. The physical interactions between the three pairs of RelBE proteins were confirmed and the DNA-binding domain recognized by three RelBE-like pairs and domain structure characteristics were described. The three RelE-like proteins physically interacted with the same RelB-like protein, and could conditionally regulate its binding with promoter DNA. The RelBE-like modules exerted complex cross-regulation effects on mycobacterial growth. The relB antitoxin gene could replace relF in cross-neutralizing the relG toxin gene. Conversely, relF enhanced the toxicity of the relE toxin gene, while relB increased the toxicity of relK. This is the first report of interactions between different pairs of RelBE modules of M. tuberculosis."
https://openalex.org/W2092545696,"Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is a neurological condition associated with neuron loss, axon sprouting, and hippocampal sclerosis, which results in modified synaptic circuitry. Cannabinoids appear to be anti-convulsive in patients and animal models of TLE, but the mechanisms of this effect are not known. A pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus mouse model of TLE was used to study the effect of cannabinoid agonists on recurrent excitatory circuits of the dentate gyrus using electrophysiological recordings in hippocampal slices isolated from control mice and mice with TLE. Cannabinoid agonists WIN 55,212-2, anandamide (AEA), or 2-arachydonoylglycerol (2-AG) reduced the frequency of spontaneous and tetrodotoxin-resistant excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) in mice with TLE, but not in controls. WIN 55,212-2 also reduced the frequency of EPSCs evoked by glutamate-photolysis activation of other granule cells in epileptic mice. Secondary population discharges evoked after antidromic electrical stimulation of mossy fibers in the hilus were also attenuated by cannabinoid agonists. Agonist effects were blocked by the cannabinoid type 1 receptor (CB1R) antagonist AM251. No change in glutamate release was observed in slices from mice that did not undergo status epilepticus. Western blot analysis suggested an up-regulation of CB1R in the dentate gyrus of animals with TLE. These findings indicate that activation of CB1R present on nerve terminals can suppress recurrent excitation in the dentate gyrus of mice with TLE. This suggests a mechanism for the anti-convulsive role of cannabinoids aimed at modulating receptors on synaptic terminals expressed de novo after epileptogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2081384422,"The cohesin complex plays a central role in genome maintenance by regulation of chromosome segregation in mitosis and DNA damage response (DDR) in other phases of the cell cycle. The ATM/ATR phosphorylates SMC1 and SMC3, two core components of the cohesin complex to regulate checkpoint signaling and DNA repair. In this report, we show that the genome-wide binding of SMC1 and SMC3 after ionizing radiation (IR) is enhanced by reinforcing pre-existing cohesin binding sites in human cancer cells. We demonstrate that ATM and SMC3 phosphorylation at Ser(1083) regulate this process. We also demonstrate that acetylation of SMC3 at Lys(105) and Lys(106) is induced by IR and this induction depends on the acetyltransferase ESCO1 as well as the ATM/ATR kinases. Consistently, both ESCO1 and SMC3 acetylation are required for intra-S phase checkpoint and cellular survival after IR. Although both IR-induced acetylation and phosphorylation of SMC3 are under the control of ATM/ATR, the two forms of modification are independent of each other and both are required to promote reinforcement of SMC3 binding to cohesin sites. Thus, SMC3 modifications is a mechanism for genome-wide reinforcement of cohesin binding in response to DNA damage response in human cells and enhanced cohesion is a downstream event of DDR."
https://openalex.org/W2050232735,"Interactions between urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) and its various ligands regulate tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis. Antibodies that bind specific uPAR epitopes may disrupt these interactions, thereby inhibiting these processes. Using a highly diverse and naïve human fragment of the antigen binding (Fab) phage display library, we identified 12 unique human Fabs that bind uPAR. Two of these antibodies compete against urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) for uPAR binding, whereas a third competes with beta1 integrins for uPAR binding. These competitive antibodies inhibit uPAR-dependent cell signaling and invasion in the non-small cell lung cancer cell line, H1299. Additionally, the integrin-blocking antibody abrogates uPAR/beta1 integrin-mediated H1299 cell adhesion to fibronectin and vitronectin. This antibody and one of the uPAR/uPA antagonist antibodies shows a significant combined effect in inhibiting cell invasion through Matrigel/Collagen I or Collagen I matrices. Our results indicate that these antagonistic antibodies have potential for the detection and treatment of uPAR-expressing tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2042396716,"Eosinophil peroxidase (EPO) is an abundant heme protein in eosinophils that catalyzes the formation of cytotoxic oxidants implicated in asthma, allergic inflammatory disorders, and cancer. It is known that some proteins with peroxidase activity (horseradish peroxidase and prostaglandin hydroperoxidase) can catalyze oxidation of bisulfite (hydrated sulfur dioxide), leading to the formation of sulfur trioxide anion radical (·SO3−). This free radical further reacts with oxygen to form peroxymonosulfate anion radical (−O3SOO·) and the very reactive sulfate anion radical (SO4̇̄), which is nearly as strong an oxidant as the hydroxyl radical. However, the ability of EPO to generate reactive sulfur radicals has not yet been reported. Here we demonstrate that eosinophil peroxidase/H2O2 is able to oxidize bisulfite, ultimately forming the sulfate anion radical (SO4̇̄), and that these reactive intermediates can oxidize target proteins to protein radicals, thereby initiating protein oxidation. We used immuno-spin trapping and confocal microscopy to study protein oxidation by EPO/H2O2 in the presence of bisulfite in a pure enzymatic system and in human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 clone 15 cells, maturated to eosinophils. Polyclonal antiserum raised against the spin trap 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO) detected the presence of DMPO covalently attached to the proteins resulting from the DMPO trapping of protein free radicals. We found that sulfite oxidation mediated by EPO/H2O2 induced the formation of radical-derived DMPO spin-trapped human serum albumin and, to a lesser extent, of DMPO-EPO. These studies suggest that EPO-dependent oxidative damage may play a role in tissue injury in bisulfite-exacerbated eosinophilic inflammatory disorders. Eosinophil peroxidase (EPO) is an abundant heme protein in eosinophils that catalyzes the formation of cytotoxic oxidants implicated in asthma, allergic inflammatory disorders, and cancer.

Sulfur dioxide, formed during the combustion of fossil fuels, is a major air pollutant near large cities (1Rall D.P. Environ. Health Perspect. 1974; 8: 97-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). It can be hydrated to bisulfite in the lung and upon contact with fluids lining the air passages as follows,SO2+H2O→HSO3−+H+HSO3−+H2O→SO32−+H3O+REACTIONS 1 AND 2 where the second pKa = 7.2 (2Hayon E. Treinin A. Wilf J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1972; 94: 47-57Crossref Scopus (695) Google Scholar). Its two ionized forms in aqueous solution at physiological pH, bisulfite and sulfite (3Neta P. Huie R.E. Environ. Health Perspect. 1985; 64: 209-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), are widely used as preservatives and antioxidants to prevent food and beverage spoilage, as bleaching agents for certain products, and as medicine ingredients (4Gunnison A.F. Food Cosmet. Toxicol. 1981; 19: 667-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Bisulfite is used when not referring to a particular sulfite species. Sulfite is generated endogenously during the normal metabolic processing of sulfur-containing amino acids (5Shih V.E. Abroms I.F. Johnson J.L. Carney M. Mandell R. Robb R.M. Cloherty J.P. Rajagopalan K.V. N. Engl. J. Med. 1977; 297: 1022-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Sulfite is toxic to the lung and can cause allergic reactions in humans, especially in sulfite-hypersensitive individuals, most commonly causing bronchoconstriction in asthmatics (6Lester M.R. J. Am. Coll. Nutr. 1995; 14: 229-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). It is detoxified to sulfate by sulfite oxidase (7Cohen H.J. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 359-366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and deficiency of this enzyme in humans is fatal. Sulfite oxidase is present at high levels in the liver and in lower concentrations in most of the other tissues of the body (e.g. in the lung). The enzymatic oxidation of sulfite proceeds via a two-electron oxidation, but recent studies suggest that the cytotoxicity of bisulfite is mediated by free radicals (8Niknahad H. O'Brien P.J. Chem. Biol. Interact. 2008; 174: 147-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In fact, free radicals have been demonstrated to be produced by enzymatic initiation of the oxidation of bisulfite by prostaglandin H synthase (9Mottley C. Mason R.P. Chignell C.F. Sivarajah K. Eling T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5050-5055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and horseradish peroxidase (10Araiso T. Miyoshi K. Yamazaki I.

Data. 1988; 17: 1027-1284Crossref Scopus (2685) Google Scholar). The oxygen transfer reaction of −O3SOO· to form SO4̇̄ is a general reaction of peroxyl radicals and is not limited to oxygen donation to sulfite as in Reaction 7 (2Hayon E. Treinin A. Wilf J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1972; 94: 47-57Crossref Scopus (695) Google Scholar, 14Reed G.A. Curtis J.F. Mottley C. Eling T.E. Mason R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Furthermore, SO4̇̄ can react with another molecule of bisulfite via Reaction 8, but, being a very strong oxidant (13Neta P. Huie R.E. Ross A.B. J. Phys. Chem. Ref. Data. 1988; 17: 1027-1284Crossref Scopus (2685) Google Scholar), it will oxidize almost any biomolecules. Despite the proclivity of peroxidases to serve as initiators in the generation of reactive sulfur-derived species, we can find no reports of bisulfite oxidation mediated by any mammalian peroxidase.

EPO is a monomer of 70 kDa, composed of heavy and light chains with molecular masses of 55 and 15 kDa, respectively. EPO and the other members of mammalian peroxidase superfamily II have the unique ability to use halides and pseudohalides at plasma levels (SCN−, 20–120 μm; Br−, 20–100 μm; I−, <1 μm; Cl−, 100 mm) to generate hypohalous acids via the reaction H2O2 + X− + H+ → HOX + H2O, where X− represents SCN−, Br−, I−, or Cl−, and HOX is the corresponding hypohalous acid (12Furtmüller P.G.

Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 406-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Studies thus far on EPO have focused primarily on its preference to oxidize these physiological substrates through a two-electron oxidation pathway. Recently, it has been demonstrated that nitric oxide can serve as a substrate for EPO and compete with plasma levels of bromide, steering the enzyme reaction from a two-electron oxidation to a one-electron oxidation pathway by generation of reactive nitrogen species (25Galijasevic S. Proteasa G. Abdulhamid I. Abu-Soud H.M. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 406-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In a model of nitrite oxidation (24Wu W. Chen Y. Hazen S.L. J. Biol.

We now demonstrate that EPO uses bisulfite as a one-electron donor substrate to generate reactive intermediates that oxidize the most abundant protein present in plasma, albumin (HSA), to protein radicals via REACTIONS 1 AND 2, REACTION 3, REACTIONS 4 AND 5, REACTION 6, REACTION 7, REACTION 8. In our study, we used immuno-spin trapping with 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO) (27Mason R.P. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2004; 36: 1214-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) and confocal miscroscopy to investigate protein radical formation in the reaction of bisulfite with EPO-H2O2 in cells. Human EPO was purified from white blood cells (Lee Biosolutions Inc., St. Louis, MO). The purity of the enzyme was assured by the purity ratio (RZ) > 1.0 (A413/A280) and by SDS-PAGE analysis with Coomassie Blue staining. The concentration of the enzyme was calculated using an extinction coefficient of 112 mm−1 cm−1 at 413 nm (28Bolscher B.G. Plat H. Wever R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 784: 177-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Human serum albumin (99.99% purity), diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid, sodium sulfite, sodium thiocyanate, sodium bromide, sodium chloride, sodium iodide, ascorbic acid, glutathione, cysteine, methionine, melatonin, homovanillic acid (HVA), and hydrogen peroxide (obtained as a 30% solution) were from Sigma. The hydrogen peroxide concentration was determined from its absorbance at 240 nm (ϵ = 39.4 m−1 cm−1). DMPO (high purity, ≥99%) from Alexis Biochemicals (San Diego, CA) was sublimed twice under vacuum at room temperature and stored under an argon atmosphere at −80 °C before use. Chelex-100 resin was purchased from Bio-Rad. ESR spectra were obtained at room temperature using a Bruker EMX spectrometer with 100-kHz modulation frequency equipped with an ER 4122 SHQ cavity. Samples were placed in a 10-mm flat cell (200-μl final volume), and recording of the spectra was initiated within 1 min of the start of the reaction. The ESR spectrometer settings were as follows: modulation amplitude, 0.4 G; scan range, 80 G; microwave power, 20 milliwatts; receiver gain, 5 × 104; time constant, 327.68 ms; sweep time, 335.544 s; frequency, 9.80 GHz. The simulation was performed using WinSim version 1.0 software (29Duling D.R. J. Magn. Reson. B. 1994; 104: 105-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar). Kinetic experiments were carried out with a Cary 100 spectrophotometer (Varian Inc., Palo Alto, CA) using a 500-μl quartz cuvette. Reactions were performed in 100 mm phosphate buffer (Chelex-treated with 25 μm diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid) at pH 7.4. For reduction of compound II, 1.5 μm EPO was premixed with 1.3 μm HVA and 15 μm hydrogen peroxide. Forty seconds after the mixing, compound II was allowed to react with bisulfite. Pseudo-first order conditions were achieved by keeping the bisulfite concentration at a ≥5-fold excess over the enzyme. For oxygen uptake measurements, sodium sulfite and hydrogen peroxide were mixed in a 2-ml chamber equipped with a Clark electrode and a stirrer. The reaction mixture (1.8 ml) was initiated by EPO, and the oxygen uptake curves were obtained at room temperature with an oxygen monitor (YSI Inc., Yellow Springs, OH). The oxygen polarographic electrode was calibrated by the depletion of oxygen during the oxidation of hypoxanthine in the presence of xanthine oxidase and catalase (30Holtzman J.L. Anal. Chem. 1976; 48: 229-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Typically, reactions of 600 μm HSA, 2 mm Na2SO3, 100 μm H2O2, and 1 μm EPO were carried out in the presence or absence of 1 mm DMPO in 100 mm phosphate buffer (Chelex-treated with 25 μm diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid) at pH 7.4 in a total volume of 30 μl. After 1 h of incubation at 37 °C, samples were then diluted with deionized H2O for electrophoresis and immuno-spin trapping analyses. Rabbit anti-DMPO polyclonal serum, developed in our laboratory, was used for the development of the immunoassays (31Detweiler C.D. Deterding L.J. Tomer K.B. Chignell C.F. Germolec D. Mason R.P.

The DMPO-HSA nitrone adducts were determined using a standard ELISA in 96-well plates (Greiner Labortechnik, Frickenhausen, Germany) as described previously (34Ranguelova K. Suarez J. Magliozzo R.S. Mason R.P. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 11377-11385Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Optimal concentrations were determined by varying the concentrations of HSA, Na2SO3, H2O2, and DMPO one at a time. Reaction mixtures were electrophoresed under reducing conditions through duplicate 4–12% BisTris NuPage acrylamide gels (Invitrogen). After electrophoresis, one gel was stained using Coomassie Blue, and the proteins in the other were blotted to a nitrocellulose membrane. Western blotting was performed as described with minor changes (35Ramirez D.C. Gomez Mejiba S.E. Mason R.P. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2005; 38: 201-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In experiments to analyze HSA and EPO immunostain, rabbit polyclonal anti-HSA (Abcam, Cambridge, MA) and anti-EPO (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) were used at a dilution of 1:10,000, and the secondary antibody used was an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Pierce). HL-60 (clone 15) cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were grown in RPM1–1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and optimal antibiotics. The cultures were treated with 0.5 mm butyric acid for 5 days for their differentiation into mature eosinophils. The cells were harvested and checked for viability by trypan blue dye exclusion. Harvested 2 × 106 cells/ml of viable cells were seeded in a 24-well culture plate and incubated with DMPO, bisulfite, and 5 mm glucose plus 50 milliunits/ml glucose oxidase (G/GOx) for 1 h. This concentration initially produced 5 μm H2O2/min and required mixing because the reaction is oxygen-dependent. Following incubation, the cells were washed once with PBS and lysed using radioimmune precipitation buffer containing proteinase inhibitors. The cell lysates were used immediately or stored at −80 °C until further use. For confocal microscopy studies, treated HL-60 (clone 15) cells were allowed to adhere on polylysine-coated plates (MatTek, Ashland, MA) for 30 min on ice. The cells were fixed with 0.4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.01% Surfact-Amps X-100 (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA). After blocking with 0.1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline, EPO and DMPO-nitrone adducts were stained using primary anti-EPO (mouse host) (Abcam, Cambridge, MA) and anti-DMPO (rabbit host) antisera. After a 1-h incubation, the cells were washed, and secondary Alexafluor anti-mouse and Alexafluor anti-rabbit conjugated with fluorescein (Invitrogen) were added. Incubations of bisulfite (500 μm) with eosinophil peroxidase (3 μm) plus H2O2 (3 μm) in the presence of DMPO (100 mm) yielded an ESR spectrum of a sulfur trioxide anion radical (·SO3−) radical adduct (Fig. 1A). The hyperfine coupling constants of the assigned DMPO/·SO3− radical adduct (aN = 14.7 G and aβH = 16.0 G) are consistent with previous reports (9Mottley C. Mason R.P. Chignell C.F. Sivarajah K. Eling T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5050-5055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Mottley C. Mason R.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 267: 681-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). When EPO, bisulfite, or H2O2 was omitted, no radical adduct was formed (Fig. 1, spectra C, D, and E, respectively). The proposed mechanism of enzymatic oxidation of bisulfite to the ·SO3− radical by the eosinophil peroxidase/H2O2 system proceeds in two sequential, one-electron reduction reactions of compounds I and II by sulfite, similar to the oxidation of bisulfite by horseradish peroxidase and prostaglandin H synthase (9Mottley C. Mason R.P. Chignell C.F. Sivarajah K. Eling T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5050-5055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Mottley C. Trice T.B. Mason R.P. Mol.

Chem. 1973; 51: 588-596Crossref Google Scholar). To determine the reduction of EPO compound II by bisulfite (compound I of eosinophil peroxidase has been reported to be very unstable (12Furtmüller P.G. Burner U. Regelsberger G. Obinger C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15578-15584Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar)), EPO was premixed with a substoichiometric concentration of HVA and a 10-fold excess of hydrogen peroxide. Under these conditions, a spectrum of compound II was obtained with peaks at 433, 537, and 565 nm (Fig. 2A), and the corresponding time trace (at 433 nm) clearly indicated that compound II was stable for at least 1 min (Fig. 2B, inset). It has been shown that HVA readily reduces compound I but is an extremely poor substrate for compound II (37Furtmüller P.G. Jantschko W. Regelsberger G. Obinger C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1548: 121-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Consequently, we premixed EPO (1.5 μm), HVA (1.3 μm), and hydrogen peroxide (15 μm) to generate compound II, and after 40 s, we then followed its reaction with various concentrations of bisulfite. The corresponding spectral changes indicated a transition of compound II to ferric EPO (with peaks at 413, 500, and 639 nm) (Fig. 2A). For each sulfite concentration, the loss of absorbance at 433 nm displayed monoexponential character. Typical time traces for the reaction of sulfite with compound II are shown in the inset of Fig. 2B. The pseudo-first-order rate constants (kobs) were obtained from these traces and plotted against the concentration of bisulfite (Fig. 2B). The slope of this secondary plot yielded the second-order rate constant for the reduction of compound II at pH 7.4. It was calculated to be (2.1 ± 0.6) × 102 m−1 s−1. The calculated rate is very similar to that reported for horseradish peroxidase. The second-order rate constants for the reactions between HRP compounds I and II with bisulfite at neutral pH are (7.6 ± 0.8) × 10 m−1 s−1 and (1.8 ± 0.06) × 102 m−1 s−1, respectively (36Roman R. Dunford H.B. Can. J. Chem. 1973; 51: 588-596Crossref Google Scholar). Although these reactions are relatively slow, only 1.4 × 10−13 m ·SO3− is necessary to propagate this enzymatically initiated, free radical chain reaction (38Ranguelova K. Mason R.P. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2009; 47: 128-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The resulting sulfur trioxide anion radical (·SO3−) is known to react further with molecular oxygen and form peroxymonosulfate (−O3SOO·) and sulfate (SO4̇̄) anion radicals in the free radical chain mechanism reported previously (2Hayon E. Treinin A. Wilf J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1972; 94: 47-57Crossref Scopus (695) Google Scholar, 14Reed G.A. Curtis J.F. Mottley C. Eling T.E. Mason R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1986; 83: 7499-7502Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 15Mottley C. Mason R.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 267: 681-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated the consumption of oxygen by this system. When the primary ·SO3− radical reacted with oxygen in the absence of DMPO (Fig. 3A), the consumption of oxygen increased strongly with the bisulfite concentration, with 200 μm bisulfite notably stimulating oxygen uptake (Fig. 3A, trace b) and causing total oxygen consumption within 2 min at 2 mm bisulfite (Fig. 3A, trace e). When we examined the DMPO concentration dependence of oxygen consumption experiments using 2 mm bisulfite, 100 μm H2O2, and 50 nm EPO as the initiator, the prior addition of 100 mm DMPO (the same amount used for the ESR data) almost completely prevented oxygen uptake (Fig. 3B, trace a) (i.e. there were no radical chain reactions forming −O3SOO· and SO4̇̄ radicals. At lower DMPO concentrations of 0.3 mm and 1 mm DMPO, oxygen uptake was inhibited after 10 min by ∼40 and ∼60%, respectively. The ESR detection of the DMPO/·SO3− radical adduct by spin trapping in aerobic conditions and oxygen uptake experiments indicates that there is a strong competition between the spin trap and the oxygen for the primary ·SO3− radical. In order to allow the radical chain reaction to proceed, the concentration of DMPO has to be decreased so that a significant fraction of the primary ·SO3− radical is not trapped by DMPO, allowing its reaction with oxygen to produce secondary −O3SOO· and tertiary SO4̇̄ radicals via REACTION 6, REACTION 7, REACTION 8. This result demonstrates that to trap protein radicals formed by −O3SOO· and/or SO4̇̄ will require DMPO concentrations of 10 mm or less (Scheme 1).SCHEME 1Proposed mechanism of protein oxidative damage induced by the eosinophil peroxidase-H2O2-bisulfite system.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To characterize the ability of the SO4̇̄ radical (or possibly other sulfite-derived radicals such as −O3SOO·) to oxidize target proteins, the most abundant plasma protein (human serum albumin) was incubated with the complete eosinophil peroxidase-H2O2-bisulfite system in the presence of DMPO, and the reaction products were analyzed by Western blotting using an anti-DMPO polyclonal antibody. Initially, samples containing 600 μm HSA (plasma concentration) were mixed with 2 mm bisulfite and 100 μm H2O2 in the absence or presence of different concentrations of DMPO, and the reactions were initiated by the addition of 1 μm eosinophil peroxidase. The reaction products were then subjected to gel electrophoresis and Western blot. Coomassie Blue staining verified equal amounts of HSA in all treatments and showed the presence of a single band at 60 kDa due to albumin together with a small amount of HSA dimer at ∼120 kDa (Fig. 4A). No additional bands were observed, indicating that at 1 μm, eosinophil peroxidase was undetectable. Immunochemical detection of HSA-DMPO nitrone adducts was also performed (Fig. 4B). Samples lacking eosinophil peroxidase, H2O2, or Na2SO3 contained negligible anti-DMPO cross-reacting material. Incubation of HSA with 0.1 or 0.3 mm DMPO produced nitrone adducts at background levels, whereas increasing the DMPO concentration up to 1 mm resulted in a significant increase in HSA-DMPO-derived nitrone adducts. Further increases in the spin trap concentration up to 3 mm produced modest increases in adduct formation, whereas 10 mm caused a decrease. The addition of 100 mm DMPO totally inhibited DMPO-nitrone adduct production, preventing the radical chemistry in REACTION 6, REACTION 7, REACTION 8 by trapping the primary ·SO3− radical, thus diminishing the formation of the damaging radical intermediates. Production of HSA-derived nitrone adducts also depended on Na2SO3 concentration (supplemental Fig. 1A). When 1 and 10 μm bisulfite and 600 μm albumin were oxidized in the presence of 1 mm DMPO and EPO (1 μm)/H2O2 (100 μm), no DMPO-nitrone adducts were detected. Western blotting performed on reactions containing from 100 μm to 2 mm bisulfite showed increased production of DMPO-HSA radical-derived nitrone adducts and faint bands of DMPO-HSA dimer at the higher bisulfite concentrations. The effect of increasing concentrations of H2O2 was also determined (supplemental Fig. 1B). Omission of HSA, DMPO, or H2O2 resulted in no immunostaining above the background level. In the presence of 1 mm DMPO, 2 mm Na2SO3, and eosinophil peroxidase (1 μm), 10 μm H2O2 produced DMPO-HSA radical-derived nitrone adducts detectable by Western blot. Although the addition of smaller amounts of H2O2 had no observable effect, 50 and 100 μm H2O2 significantly increased production of DMPO-nitrone adducts, which appeared as HSA monomers and, in the case of 100 μm H2O2, HSA dimers. As shown in Fig. 5A, the omission of HSA resulted in no staining on the gel, whereas the sample not treated with eosinophil peroxidase confirmed the presence of the single HSA band at 60 kDa together with a small amount of a 120-kDa dimer. Incubation of HSA with 5 and 10 μm EPO resulted in visualization of the heavy chain of EPO (∼55 kDa). The light chain (∼15 kDa) of the peroxidase was much less pronounced but still visible on the stained gel. Anti-EPO immunodetection of the same samples indicated the presence of eosinophil peroxidase (Fig. 5B), exhibiting two bands corresponding to the heavy and light chains. When the samples were analyzed with anti-DMPO, no immunostain was observed in the controls (without HSA or EPO) except for a faint band in the sample without EPO (Fig. 5C). When the EPO concentration was increased from 1 to 5 μm, anti-DMPO staining also increased. With 10 μm EPO, a sharp increase in staining and drastic oxidative damage to HSA were observed. DMPO-HSA radical-derived nitrone adducts were observed not only as monomers but also as dimers and multiple fragments of HSA. Interestingly, with 10 μm EPO, immunostained samples showed a small but detectable amount of nitrone adducts on EPO, clearly visible on the light EPO chain (the heavy chain DMPO-EPO nitrone adducts overlapped with the DMPO-HSA complexes). To test the structural damage on HSA due to the bisulfite oxidation catalyzed by EPO, we examined the same samples using anti-HSA polyclonal antibody. Untreated HSA appeared essen"
https://openalex.org/W2017678090,"Midgut enzymatic activity is one of the obstacles that Leishmania must surpass to succeed in establishing infection. Trypsins are abundant digestive enzymes in most insects. We have previously described two trypsin cDNAs of L. longipalpis: one (Lltryp1) with a bloodmeal induced transcription pattern, the other (Lltryp2) with a constitutive transcription pattern. We have now characterized the expression and activity of trypsin-like proteases of Lutzomyia longipalpis, the main vector of visceral leishmaniasis in Brazil.In order to study trypsin expression profiles we produced antibodies against peptides specific for Lltryp1 and Lltryp2. The anti-Lltryp1-peptide antibody revealed a band of 28 kDa between 6 and 48 hours. The anti-Lltryp2 peptide antibody did not evidence any band. When proteinaceous substrates (gelatin, hemoglobin, casein or albumin) were co-polymerized in polyacrylamide gels, insect midguts obtained at 12 hours after feeding showed a unique proteolytic pattern for each substrate. All activity bands were strongly inhibited by TLCK, benzamidine and 4-amino-benzamidine, indicating that they are trypsin-like proteases. The trypsin-like activity was also measured in vitro at different time points after ingestion of blood or blood containing Leishmania infantum chagasi, using the chromogenic substrate BArhoNA. L. longipalpis females fed on blood infected with L. i. chagasi had lower levels of trypsin activity after 12 and 48 hours than non-infected insects, suggesting that the parasite may have a role in this modulation.Trypsins are important and abundant digestive enzymes in L. longipalpis. Protein production and enzymatic activity followed previously identified gene expression of a blood modulated trypsin gene. A decrease of enzymatic activity upon the parasite infection, previously detected mostly in Old World vectors, was detected for the first time in the natural vector-parasite pair L. longipalpis-L. i. chagasi."
https://openalex.org/W2038552200,"The order of genes in eukaryotes is not entirely random. Studies of gene order conservation are important to understand genome evolution and to reveal mechanisms why certain neighboring genes are more difficult to separate during evolution. Here, genome-wide gene order information was compiled for 64 species, representing a wide variety of eukaryotic phyla. This information is presented in a browser where gene order may be displayed and compared between species. Factors related to non-random gene order in eukaryotes were examined by considering pairs of neighboring genes. The evolutionary conservation of gene pairs was studied with respect to relative transcriptional direction, intergenic distance and functional relationship as inferred by gene ontology. The results show that among gene pairs that are conserved the divergently and co-directionally transcribed genes are much more common than those that are convergently transcribed. Furthermore, highly conserved pairs, in particular those of fungi, are characterized by a short intergenic distance. Finally, gene pairs of metazoa and fungi that are evolutionary conserved and that are divergently transcribed are much more likely to be related by function as compared to poorly conserved gene pairs. One example is the ribosomal protein gene pair L13/S16, which is unusual as it occurs both in fungi and alveolates. A specific functional relationship between these two proteins is also suggested by the fact that they are part of the same operon in both eubacteria and archaea. In conclusion, factors associated with non-random gene order in eukaryotes include relative gene orientation, intergenic distance and functional relationships. It seems likely that certain pairs of genes are conserved because the genes involved have a transcriptional and/or functional relationship. The results also indicate that studies of gene order conservation aid in identifying genes that are related in terms of transcriptional control."

Angiogenesis is critical for physiological processes such as development, wound healing, reproduction, tissue regeneration, and remodeling. It also plays a major role in sustaining tumor progression and chronic inflammation. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-B, a member of the VEGF family of angiogenic growth factors, effects blood vessel formation by binding to a tyrosine kinase receptor, VEGFR-1. There is growing evidence of the important role played by VEGF-B in physiological and pathological vasculogenesis. Development of VEGF-B antagonists, which inhibit the interaction of this molecule with its cognate receptor, would be important for the treatment of pathologies associated specifically with this growth factor. In this study, we present the crystal structure of the complex of VEGF-B with domain 2 of VEGFR-1 at 2.7 Å resolution. Our analysis reveals that each molecule of the ligand engages two receptor molecules using two symmetrical binding sites. Based on these interactions, we identify the receptor-binding determinants on VEGF-B and shed light on the differences in specificity towards VEGFR-1 among the different VEGF homologs.

VEGF-A along with VEGF-B, VEGF-C, VEGF-D, placenta growth factor (PlGF) and related proteins called VEGF-E (Orf virus-encoded protein), and VEGF-F (variant isolated from snake venom) belong to a structurally related superfamily of proteins called the cysteine-knot growth factors (4Holmes D.I.

The members of the VEGF family of cytokines mediate their different biological roles by binding to three high affinity tyrosine kinase receptors as follows: VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2, and VEGFR-3. Although VEGF-A binds to both VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2, VEGF-B and PlGF bind only VEGFR-1. VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3 bind to VEGF-C and VEGF-D to exert their cellular responses (6Stuttfeld E. Ballmer-Hofer K.

Homodimeric VEGF-B exists as two alternatively spliced forms, VEGF-B167 and VEGF-B186, with identical N-terminal domains but nonhomologous C-terminal domains. VEGF-B has wide tissue distribution albeit overlapping with VEGF-A, and experiments reveal that VEGF-B can act as an endothelial cell growth factor (10Olofsson B. Pajusola K.

Around the same time, it was shown that although VEGF-B is dispensable for blood vessel growth, it was absolutely critical for vascular survival. This study indicated that this property of VEGF-B, regulated by neuropilin-1 and VEGFR-1, could be targeted to inhibit angiogenesis (15Zhang F. Tang Z. Hou X. Lennartsson J. Li Y. Koch A.W.

Interestingly, some recent studies implicate a role for VEGF-B in lipid metabolism, a function not yet assigned for an angiogenic growth factor (19Karpanen T. Bry M. Ollila H.M. Seppänen-Laakso T.

Taken together, data from all the previous studies suggest that VEGF-B, unlike VEGF-A, is in the nascent stage of establishing its role in the field of angiogenesis. Studies focusing on VEGF-B along with its molecular and cellular targets become necessary to delineate the angiogenic capability of this cysteine-knot protein. VEGF-B is known to regulate the bioavailability and activity of VEGF-A and PlGF by forming heterodimers with these growth factors (10Olofsson B. Pajusola K. Kaipainen A. von Euler G. Joukov V.

The mitogenic capability of VEGFR-1 is not yet completely understood. Some experiments point to a synergistic role for VEGFR-1 whereby this receptor molecule regulates angiogenesis by augmenting VEGFR-2 signaling. Data also indicate that binding and phosphorylation of VEGFR-1 (by VEGF-B) can potentiate angiogenesis via activation of the Akt-endothelial nitric-oxide synthase pathway (23Yoon Y.S. Losordo D.W. Circ. Res. 2003; 93: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar).

Here, we report the three-dimensional structure of VEGF-B in complex with domain 2 of VEGFR-1. The complex is topologically similar to the other receptor complexes reported for the VEGF family. However, structural comparisons of the present complex with the known receptor-ligand interactions highlight unique molecular features that help shed light on the differences in the molecular recognition of VEGFR-1 that seem to affect downstream signaling. Human VEGF-B(10–108) cDNA was PCR-amplified from a plasmid encoding full-length human VEGF-B (clone ID: IRAUp969H0431D, imaGenes) using KOD Hot Start DNA polymerase (Novagen) and the following primers: forward primer 5′-GGTATTGAGGGTCGCCACCAGAGGAAAGTGGT-3′ and reverse primer 5′-AGAGGAGAGTTAGAGCCCTACTTTTTTTTAGGTCTGCAT-3′. The PCR product was cloned into pET-32 Xa/LIC plasmid (Novagen), and the resulting expression plasmid was transformed into Rosetta-gamiTM B(DE3)pLysS strain. Cells were grown in TB media at 30 °C to an A578 of 1.0, cooled to 14 °C, and induced overnight at the reduced temperature by addition of 0.3 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Cells obtained from 0.5 liter of bacterial culture were resuspended in 20 ml of sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 (lysis buffer), and lysed by sonication. The lysate was centrifuged for 20 min at 20,000 × g following which the supernatant was discarded. The pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer supplemented with 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, sonicated, and centrifuged. The pellet, consisting primarily of VEGF-B(10–108) (fusion protein), was washed once again with lysis buffer supplemented with 0.5 m NaCl and collected by centrifugation as before. The inclusion bodies were dispersed in 8 m urea, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.3 m reduced glutathione, 2 mm EDTA and stirred under nitrogen gas for 2 h. Solubilized protein was added dropwise to 500 ml of 0.5 m l-arginine, pH 8.0, containing 1.2 mm oxidized glutathione and left for 24 h at 19 °C. The solution was clarified by centrifugation for 30 min at 10,000 × g and diluted 5-fold with water, and refolded protein was bound on a 1-ml HiTrap FF column (GE Healthcare). The column was washed with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, and the bound protein was eluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, and 300 mm imidazole.

Thioredoxin tag and His6 tag from the fusion complex were cleaved with factor Xa. The cleavage reaction was again separated on Superdex 75 and equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 150 mm NaCl to elute the untagged VEGF-B(10–108)·VEGFR-1D2 complex.

Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19667) Google Scholar) resulted in the final structure for all data between 40 and 2.7 Å resolution (Table 1). The cloning, expression, and purification of VEGF-B(10–108) have been reported previously (37Scrofani S.D. Fabri L.J. Xu P. Maccarone P. Nash A.D. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 2018-2025Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). However, the reported protocol was not followed in this study as it involved three chromatographic steps to yield pure protein. To overcome this, recombinant VEGF-B(10–108) was cloned into pET-32 Xa/LIC vector and expressed as a fusion protein containing a thioredoxin (109 amino acids), His tag, and an S tag at the N-terminal end. Despite the presence of the thioredoxin tag and expression in Rosetta-gamiTM B(DE3)pLysS cells to enhance the formation of disulfide bonds in the cytoplasm, VEGF-B(10–108) expressed only in the insoluble fraction. Solubilized inclusion bodies were refolded in an arginine-based buffer, and the protein was purified using Ni2+ affinity chromatography. SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis of the purified protein revealed a major band with an apparent molecular mass of 56 kDa. This value is in agreement with the predicted molecular mass from the protein sequence and corresponds to the dimeric form of VEGF-B(10–108). Following metal affinity chromatography, the yield of pure dimeric tagged protein from 1 liter of bacterial culture was estimated to be between 10 and 12 mg. The structure of the complex between the minimal receptor-binding domain of VEGF-B (VEGF-B(10–108)) and domain 2 of VEGFR-1 (VEGFR-1D2) has been determined at 2.7 Å resolution (Fig. 1A and Table 1). The two symmetrical ends of the VEGF-B(10–108) dimer engage one molecule each of VEGFR-1D2 in the asymmetric unit. Analysis of the Ramachandran plot (38Ramachandran G.N. Sasisekharan V. Adv. Protein Chem. 1968; 23: 283-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (2735) Google Scholar) indicated that 84.9% of residues fall in the most favored region and 15.1% in the additional allowed regions of the plot. There are no residues in the disallowed region of the plot. The construct for the receptor contains amino acids 129–226. However, electron density for the first three N-terminal amino acid residues could not be observed for chain X (MolA), and the last two residues at the C-terminal end could not be observed for chain C (MolB) of VEGFR-1D2. Although none of the residues in MolA of the receptor have been modeled as alanine or glycine, residues 139, 174, 180, and 182–184 of MolB have been clipped to the Cβ atom to compensate for poor electron density for the side chains. In the VEGF-B(10–108) dimer, monomer A has the full complement of amino acids, whereas the first N-terminal (residue 10) and the last C-terminal residue (residue 108) are not observed in monomer B. Electron density for monomer A seems to be better defined than that for monomer B, which is reflected by the number of residues that have been modeled as alanine or glycine in both monomer A (residues 12, 18, 38, and 85) and monomer B (residues 12, 38, 42, 44, 45, 84, 89, and 96). None of these residues form the binding interface and thus do not affect our analysis of the interface. Average temperature factors are 39.7 Å2 for VEGF-B(10–108) dimer, 39.3 Å2 for MolA, and 44.1 Å2 for MolB. Temperature factors for the residues, from the VEGF-B(10–108) dimer and the two molecules of receptor, involved in intermolecular interactions at the receptor-ligand interface are significantly lower than the average B-factor for the structure. A total of 44 water molecules was observed in the asymmetric unit. Also found interacting with the VEGF-B(10–108) dimer is one molecule of glycerol positioned along the symmetry axis such that both monomers of VEGF-B share the same molecule of glycerol. The average temperature factor for this shared glycerol molecule is 23.2 Å2. The VEGF-B(10–108) dimer in the receptor complex (Fig. 1A) is topologically similar to the dimer in the native structure (30Iyer S. Scotney P.D. Nash A.D. Acharya K.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 359: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and in complex with the neutralizing antibody fragment Fab2H10 (32Leonard P. Scotney P.D. Jabeen T. Iyer S. Fabri L.J. Nash A.D. Acharya K.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 384: 1203-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The dimer essentially consists of two anti-parallel β-sheets with the cysteine-knot and the hydrophobic core positioned symmetrically opposite each other (30Iyer S. Scotney P.D. Nash A.D. Acharya K.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 359: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The two monomers in the present structure superimpose with an r.m.s.d of about 1.0 Å (Fig. 1B), which is much higher than what was observed between the two monomers in the native (0.61 Å (30Iyer S. Scotney P.D. Nash A.D. Acharya K.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 359: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar)) and in the antibody complex structure (0.62 Å (32Leonard P. Scotney P.D. Jabeen T. Iyer S. Fabri L.J. Nash A.D. Acharya K.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 384: 1203-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar)). Conformational differences in the three loop regions, residues 37–46, 61–67, and 84–89 of the VEGF-B(10–108) dimer (Fig. 1B), are observed in the present complex as well, similar to what was previously seen in the complex with the antibody fragment. In the present complex, the flexibility is quite pronounced for the loop comprising residues 37–46. Residues from the aforementioned loop regions, apart from loop 37–46, form a part of the binding interface between the receptor and the ligand. Given the lack of intermolecular interactions for loop 37–46 with both the receptor molecule and symmetry-related molecules, one could assume that its resulting pliancy is responsible for the higher r.m.s.d. value between the two VEGF-B(10–108) monomers in the present complex. Domain 2 of VEGFR-1 is the minimal binding domain required to ligate with VEGF-B. Two receptor molecules bind to the distant poles of the dimeric ligand, each consisting of two β-sheets, one made up of five strands and the other made up of three strands. Each receptor has a disulfide bond formed between Cys-158 and Cys-207. The two molecules of VEGFR-1D2 in the asymmetric unit superimpose onto each other with an r.m.s.d. of around 0.9 Å for 94 Cα atoms. Superposition of VEGFR-1D2 from the three receptor-ligand complexes results in an r.m.s.d. of 0.8 Å for 95 Cα atoms between VEGF-B and VEGF-A complex (25Wiesmann C. Fuh G. Christinger H.W. Eigenbrot C. Wells J.A. de Vos A.M. Cell. 1997; 91: 695-704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar) and 0.9 Å for 91 Cα atoms between VEGF-B and PlGF complex (31Christinger H.W. Fuh G. de Vos A.M. Wiesmann C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10382-10388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). This value is higher than that observed between VEGFR-1D2 from the VEGF-A and PlGF complex (∼0.6 Å for 91 Cα atoms). The topology of the VEGF-B(10–108)·VEGFR-1D2 complex (Fig. 1A) is essentially the same as that seen in the receptor complexes elucidated so far for the VEGF family of ligands. Pairwise superposition of these dimeric growth factors (Fig. 1C) in their receptor-bound state results in an r.m.s.d. of 1.5 Å over 218 Cα atoms (PDB code 1FLT (25Wiesmann C. Fuh G. Christinger H.W. Eigenbrot C. Wells J.A. de Vos A.M. Cell. 1997; 91: 695-704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar)) and 2.0 Å over 256 Cα atoms (PDB code 1RV6 (31Christinger H.W. Fuh G. de Vos A.M. Wiesmann C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10382-10388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar)). A comparison of VEGF-B(10–108) from the present complex with the structures of the unbound form (PDB code 2C7W (30Iyer S. Scotney P.D. Nash A.D. Acharya K.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 359: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar)) and that bound to Fab-2H10 (PDB code (32Leonard P. Scotney P.D. Jabeen T. Iyer S. Fabri L.J. Nash A.D. Acharya K.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 384: 1203-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar)) results in an r.m.s.d. of 1.2 Å (181 Cα atoms) and 1.3 Å (175 Cα atoms), respectively. The mode of VEGFR-1D2 binding to the VEGF-B(10–108) dimer creates two interacting surfaces symmetrically opposite each other. Both these interfaces involve mostly similar interactions; hence, all our analysis and description given here refer to VEGF-B(10–108)-MolA interface unless otherwise indicated (Table 2). Complex formation between VEGF-B(10–108) dimer and the receptor buries around 1500 Å2 of the solvent-accessible surface area at each of the two interfaces. This value is comparable with the total surface area buried in each of the interfaces between PlGF and VEGFR-1D2 (1650Å2 (31Christinger H.W. Fuh G. de Vos A.M. Wiesmann C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10382-10388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar)). It is, however, twice the area reported for that between VEGF-A and the same receptor domain (25Wiesmann C. Fuh G. Christinger H.W. Eigenbrot C. Wells J.A. de Vos A.M. Cell. 1997; 91: 695-704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). The shape correlation between the interacting surfaces of VEGF-B(10–108) and domain 2 of the receptor molecule was calculated to be about 0.66 (34Collaborative Computational Project, No. 4Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19667) Google Scholar). This value is similar to that calculated for the VEGF-A (0.62) and PlGF (0.65) receptor complexes but slightly more than that for the VEGF-B(10–108)·Fab2H10 complex (0.54 (32Leonard P. Scotney P.D.

https://openalex.org/W2053419164,"Nectin-1 is known to undergo ectodomain shedding by alpha-secretase and subsequent proteolytic processing by gamma-secretase. How secretase-mediated cleavage of nectin-1 is regulated in neuronal cells and how nectin-1 cleavage affects synaptic adhesion is poorly understood. We have investigated alpha-and gamma-secretase-mediated processing of nectin-1 in primary cortical neurons and identified which protease acts as a alpha-secretase. We report here that NMDA receptor activation, but not stimulation of AMPA or metabotropic glutamate receptors, resulted in robust alpha- and gamma-secretase cleavage of nectin-1 in mature cortical neurons. Cleavage of nectin-1 required influx of Ca(2+) through the NMDA receptor, and activation of calmodulin, but was not dependent on calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) activation. We found that ADAM10 is the major secretase responsible for nectin-1 ectodomain cleavage in neurons and the brain. These observations suggest that alpha- and gamma-secretase processing of nectin-1 is a Ca(2+)/calmodulin-regulated event that occurs under conditions of activity-dependent synaptic plasticity and ADAM10 and gamma-secretase are responsible for these cleavage events."

The human CLC-5 is an electrogenic voltage-dependent 2Cl−/1H+ exchanger that gives rise to strongly outwardly rectifying currents when expressed. We conducted whole-cell recordings from HEK293 cells transiently transfected with either wild-type CLC-5 or a permeation-deficient mutant, E268A. With E268A CLC-5 we recorded transient voltage-dependent currents that represent the gating currents associated with CLC-5 activation and had kinetics that could be described by voltage-dependent forward and reverse transition rates. In extracellular solutions rich in Cl− or Br−, CLC-5 exhibited a gating charge of 1.3, but this was reduced to 0.9 in solutions comprising the impermeant anions aspartate, methanesulfonate, sulfate, or HEPES. Extracellular ion depletion by local perfusion with isotonic mannitol failed to reduce the gating charge further. Lowering intracellular pH from 7.4 to 5.4 did not shift the voltage-dependence of the gating currents, but reducing and increasing intracellular Cl− shifted the charge-voltage relationship to more negative and positive potentials, respectively. Our data suggest that voltage sensing is an intrinsic property of the CLC-5 protein and that permeant anions, particularly Cl−, modulate a voltage-dependent transition to an activated state from which Cl−/H+ exchange can occur.—Smith, A.

https://openalex.org/W1978575231,"Background The northern fur seal (Callorhinus ursinus; NFS) is a widely distributed pinniped that has been shown to exhibit a high degree of philopatry to islands, breeding areas on an island, and even to specific segments of breeding areas. This level of philopatry could conceivably lead to highly genetically divergent populations. However, northern fur seals have the potential for dispersal across large distances and have experienced repeated rapid population expansions following glacial retreat and the more recent cessation of intensive harvest pressure. Methodology/Principal Findings Using microsatellite and mitochondrial loci, we examined population structure in NFS throughout their range. We found only weak population genetic structure among breeding islands including significant FST and ΦST values between eastern and western Pacific islands. Conclusions We conclude that insufficient time since rapid population expansion events (both post glacial and following the cessation of intense harvest pressure) mixed with low levels of contemporary migration have resulted in an absence of genetic structure across the entire northern fur seal range."
https://openalex.org/W1995536538,"Heat-shock genes have a well-studied control mechanism for their expression that is mediated through cis-regulatory motifs known as heat-shock elements (HSEs). The evolution of important features of this control mechanism has not been investigated in detail, however. Here we exploit the genome sequencing of multiple Drosophila species, combined with a wealth of available information on the structure and function of HSEs in D. melanogaster, to undertake this investigation. We find that in single-copy heat shock genes, entire HSEs have evolved or disappeared 14 times, and the phylogenetic approach bounds the timing and direction of these evolutionary events in relation to speciation. In contrast, in the multi-copy gene Hsp70, the number of HSEs is nearly constant across species. HSEs evolve in size, position, and sequence within heat-shock promoters. In turn, functional significance of certain features is implicated by preservation despite this evolutionary change; these features include tail-to-tail arrangements of HSEs, gapped HSEs, and the presence or absence of entire HSEs. The variation among Drosophila species indicates that the cis-regulatory encoding of responsiveness to heat and other stresses is diverse. The broad dimensions of variation uncovered are particularly important as they suggest a substantial challenge for functional studies."
https://openalex.org/W2090274013,"Background Considerable evidence indicates that heparan sulfate is essential for the development of tissues consisting of branching ducts and tubules. However, there are few examples where specific sulfate residues regulate a specific stage in the formation of such tissues. Methodology/Principal Findings We examined the role of heparan sulfation in mammary gland branching morphogenesis, lactation and lobuloalveolar development by inactivation of heparan sulfate GlcNAc N-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase genes (Ndst) in mammary epithelial cells using the Cre-loxP system. Ndst1 deficiency resulted in an overall reduction in glucosamine N-sulfation and decreased binding of FGF to mammary epithelial cells in vitro and in vivo. Mammary epithelia lacking Ndst1 underwent branching morphogenesis, filling the gland with ductal tissue by sexual maturity to the same extent as wildtype epithelia. However, lobuloalveolar expansion did not occur in Ndst1-deficient animals, resulting in insufficient milk production to nurture newly born pups. Lactational differentiation of isolated mammary epithelial cells occurred appropriately via stat5 activation, further supporting the notion that the lack of milk production was due to lack of expansion of the lobuloalveoli. Conclusions/Significance These findings demonstrate a selective, highly penetrant, cell autonomous effect of Ndst1-mediated sulfation on lobuloalveolar development."
https://openalex.org/W2025934666,"Many heme enzymes show remarkable versatility and atypical kinetics. The fungal extracellular enzyme chloroperoxidase (CPO) characterizes a variety of one and two electron redox reactions in the presence of hydroperoxides. A structural counterpart, found in mammalian microsomal cytochrome P450 (CYP), uses molecular oxygen plus NADPH for the oxidative metabolism (predominantly hydroxylation) of substrate in conjunction with a redox partner enzyme, cytochrome P450 reductase. In this study, we employ the two above-mentioned heme-thiolate proteins to probe the reaction kinetics and mechanism of heme enzymes. Hitherto, a substrate inhibition model based upon non-productive binding of substrate (two-site model) was used to account for the inhibition of reaction at higher substrate concentrations for the CYP reaction systems. Herein, the observation of substrate inhibition is shown for both peroxide and final substrate in CPO catalyzed peroxidations. Further, analogy is drawn in the ""steady state kinetics"" of CPO and CYP reaction systems. New experimental observations and analyses indicate that a scheme of competing reactions (involving primary product with enzyme or other reaction components/intermediates) is relevant in such complex reaction mixtures. The presence of non-selective reactive intermediate(s) affords alternate reaction routes at various substrate/product concentrations, thereby leading to a lowered detectable concentration of ""the product of interest"" in the reaction milieu. Occam's razor favors the new hypothesis. With the new hypothesis as foundation, a new biphasic treatment to analyze the kinetics is put forth. We also introduce a key concept of ""substrate concentration at maximum observed rate"". The new treatment affords a more acceptable fit for observable experimental kinetic data of heme redox enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W2068425394,"Hyaluronan synthases (HAS1-3) are integral plasma membrane proteins that synthesize hyaluronan, a cell surface and extracellular matrix polysaccharide necessary for many biological processes. It has been shown that HAS is partly localized in cholesterol-rich lipid rafts of MCF-7 cells, and cholesterol depletion with methyl-beta-cyclodextrin (MbetaCD) suppresses hyaluronan secretion in smooth muscle cells. However, the mechanism by which cholesterol depletion inhibits hyaluronan production has remained unknown. We found that cholesterol depletion from MCF-7 cells by MbetaCD inhibits synthesis but does not decrease the molecular mass of hyaluronan, suggesting no major influence on HAS stability in the membrane. The inhibition of hyaluronan synthesis was not due to the availability of HAS substrates UDP-GlcUA and UDP-GlcNAc. Instead, MbetaCD specifically down-regulated the expression of HAS2 but not HAS1 or HAS3. Screening of signaling proteins after MbetaCD treatment revealed that phosphorylation of Akt and its downstream target p70S6 kinase, both members of phosphoinositide 3-kinase-Akt pathway, were inhibited. Inhibitors of this pathway suppressed hyaluronan synthesis and HAS2 expression in MCF-7 cells, suggesting that the reduced hyaluronan synthesis by MbetaCD is due to down-regulation of HAS2, mediated by the phosphoinositide 3-kinase-Akt-mTOR-p70S6K pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2085617128,"The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha) activator fenofibrate efficiently decreases plasma triglycerides (TG), which is generally attributed to enhanced very low density lipoprotein (VLDL)-TG clearance and decreased VLDL-TG production. However, because data on the effect of fenofibrate on VLDL production are controversial, we aimed to investigate in (more) detail the mechanism underlying the TG-lowering effect by studying VLDL-TG production and clearance using APOE*3-Leiden.CETP mice, a unique mouse model for human-like lipoprotein metabolism. Male mice were fed a Western-type diet for 4 weeks, followed by the same diet without or with fenofibrate (30 mg/kg bodyweight/day) for 4 weeks. Fenofibrate strongly lowered plasma cholesterol (-38%) and TG (-60%) caused by reduction of VLDL. Fenofibrate markedly accelerated VLDL-TG clearance, as judged from a reduced plasma half-life of glycerol tri[(3)H]oleate-labeled VLDL-like emulsion particles (-68%). This was associated with an increased post-heparin lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity (+110%) and an increased uptake of VLDL-derived fatty acids by skeletal muscle, white adipose tissue, and liver. Concomitantly, fenofibrate markedly increased the VLDL-TG production rate (+73%) but not the VLDL-apolipoprotein B (apoB) production rate. Kinetic studies using [(3)H]palmitic acid showed that fenofibrate increased VLDL-TG production by equally increasing incorporation of re-esterified plasma fatty acids and liver TG into VLDL, which was supported by hepatic gene expression profiling data. We conclude that fenofibrate decreases plasma TG by enhancing LPL-mediated VLDL-TG clearance, which results in a compensatory increase in VLDL-TG production by the liver."
https://openalex.org/W2024289775,"Sphingosine kinase-1 is known to mediate Mycobacterium smegmatis induced inflammatory responses in macrophages, but its role in controlling infection has not been reported to date. We aimed to unravel the significance of SphK-1 in controlling M. smegmatis infection in RAW 264.7 macrophages. Our results demonstrated for the first time that selective inhibition of SphK-1 by either D, L threo dihydrosphingosine (DHS; a competitive inhibitor of Sphk-1) or Sphk-1 siRNA rendered RAW macrophages sensitive to M. smegmatis infection. This was due to the reduction in the expression of iNOs, p38, pp-38, late phagosomal marker, LAMP-2 and stabilization of the RelA (pp-65) subunit of NF-κB. This led to a reduction in the generation of NO and secretion of TNF-α in infected macrophages. Congruently, overexpression of SphK-1 conferred resistance in macrophages to infection which was due to enhancement in the generation of NO and expression of iNOs, pp38 and LAMP-2. In addition, our results also unraveled a novel regulation of p38MAPK by SphK-1 during M. smegmatis infection and generation of NO in macrophages. Enhanced NO generation and expression of iNOs in SphK-1++ infected macrophages demonstrated their M-1bright phenotype of these macrophages. These findings thus suggested a novel antimycobacterial role of SphK-1 in macrophages."
https://openalex.org/W2091692749,"Thiazolidinediones (TZDs) are insulin sensitizers used to treat patients with insulin resistance. To assess potential gene-drug interactions, mice expressing human apolipoprotein E3 or E4 (APOE3 or APOE4) were fed a Western-type high-fat diet for 12 wk, at which time they developed similarly impaired glucose tolerance. Supplementing the diet with rosiglitazone (1.5 mg/g body weight) for an additional 4 wk improved plasma lipid profiles in both APOE3 and APOE4 mice. However, glucose tolerance improved only in APOE3 mice. Induction of adipogenesis and lipogenesis was severely blunted in adipose tissues, but not in the livers, of APOE4 mice. Consequently, lipids were channeled to the liver, causing marked steatosis in these mice. Impaired glucose tolerance was not a prerequisite for this adverse effect, and long-term treatment with rosiglitazone altered liver enzymes and caused hepatic fibrosis in APOE4 mice. Finally, TZDs failed to stimulate PPARγ activation and adipocyte differentiation in preadipocytes and embryonic fibroblasts isolated from APOE4 mice compared to those from APOE3 mice. We conclude that the effects of TZDs are APOE isoform dependent, and that the metabolic damage observed in APOE4 mice is rooted in an impaired activation of the adipogenic program in the adipose tissues expressing APOE4.—Arbones-Mainar, J.

https://openalex.org/W1994785305,"MAGP1 is an extracellular matrix protein that, in vertebrates, is a ubiquitous component of fibrillin-rich microfibrils. We previously reported that aged MAGP1-deficient mice (MAGP1Delta) develop lesions that are the consequence of spontaneous bone fracture. We now present a more defined bone phenotype found in MAGP1Delta mice. A longitudinal DEXA study demonstrated age-associated osteopenia in MAGP1Delta animals and muCT confirmed reduced bone mineral density in the trabecular and cortical bone. Further, MAGP1Delta mice have significantly less trabecular bone, the trabecular microarchitecture is more fragmented, and the diaphyseal cross-sectional area is significantly reduced. The remodeling defect seen in MAGP1Delta mice is likely not due to an osteoblast defect, because MAGP1Delta bone marrow stromal cells undergo osteoblastogenesis and form mineralized nodules. In vivo, MAGP1Delta mice exhibit normal osteoblast number, mineralized bone surface, and bone formation rate. Instead, our findings suggest increased bone resorption is responsible for the osteopenia. The number of osteoclasts derived from MAGP1Delta bone marrow macrophage cells is increased relative to the wild type, and osteoclast differentiation markers are expressed at earlier time points in MAGP1Delta cells. In vivo, MAGP1Delta mice have more osteoclasts lining the bone surface. RANKL (receptor activator of NF-kappaB ligand) expression is significantly higher in MAGP1Delta bone, and likely contributes to enhanced osteoclastogenesis. However, bone marrow macrophage cells from MAGP1Delta mice show a higher propensity than do wild-type cells to differentiate to osteoclasts in response to RANKL, suggesting that they are also primed to respond to osteoclast-promoting signals. Together, our findings suggest that MAGP1 is a regulator of bone remodeling, and its absence results in osteopenia associated with an increase in osteoclast number."

Up-to-date structural and functional annotations of genes are an essential foundation of systems biology modeling. We propose that the first essential step in any systems biology modeling of functional genomics data, especially for species with recently sequenced genomes, is gene structural and functional re-annotation. To demonstrate the impact of such re-annotation, we structurally and functionally re-annotated a microarray developed, and previously used, as a tool for disease research. We quantified the impact of this re-annotation on the array based on the total numbers of structural- and functional-annotations, the Gene Annotation Quality (GAQ) score, and canonical pathway coverage. We next quantified the impact of re-annotation on systems biology modeling using a previously published experiment that used this microarray. We show that re-annotation improves the quantity and quality of structural- and functional-annotations, allows a more comprehensive Gene Ontology based modeling, and improves pathway coverage for both the whole array and a differentially expressed mRNA subset. Our results also demonstrate that re-annotation can result in a different knowledge outcome derived from previous published research findings. We propose that, because of this, re-annotation should be considered to be an essential first step for deriving value from functional genomics data."

We have demonstrated previously that RNA editing by ADAR2 is regulated metabolically in pancreatic β cells. To investigate the cellular functions of ADAR2 in professional secretory cells, we studied the effects of ADAR2 knockdown on regulated exocytosis. Selective knockdown of ADAR2 expression markedly impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in the rat insulinoma INS-1 cells and primary pancreatic islets and significantly diminished KCl-stimulated secretion of exogenous human growth hormone or endogenous chromogranin B protein in the rat adrenal pheochromocytoma PC12 cells. Notably, restored overexpression of catalytically active but not editing-deficient mutant ADAR2 could rescue the impairment in stimulated secretion from ADAR2 knockdown cells. Moreover, ADAR2 suppression significantly attenuated Ca2+-evoked membrane capacitance increases and appreciably reduced the number of membrane-docked insulin granules in INS-1 cells. Interestingly, the secretory defects resulting from ADAR2 deficiency were coupled to decreased expression of Munc18-1 and synaptotagmin-7, two key molecules in the regulation of vesicle exocytosis. Thus, these findings reveal an important aspect of ADAR2 actions in regulated exocytosis, implicating RNA editing in the control of cellular secretory machinery.—Yang, L., Zhao, L., Gan, Z., He, Z., Xu, J., Gao, X., Wang, X., Han, W., Chen, L., Xu, T., Li, W., Liu, Y.

https://openalex.org/W2050247571,"Bach1 is a member of the basic leucine zipper transcription factor family, and the Bach1/small Maf heterodimer specifically represses transcriptional activity directed by the Maf recognition element (MARE). Because Bach1 is a repressor of the oxidative stress response, we examined the function(s) of Bach1 in keratinocytes subjected to oxidative stress. Oxidative stress induced by H2O2 led to an increase in MARE activity and expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), an inducible antioxidant defense enzyme. Bach1 depletion by small interfering RNAs or by deletion of Bach1 enhanced HO-1 expression in the absence of H2O2, indicating that Bach1 is a critical repressor of HO-1 in keratinocytes. Although Bach1-deficient or -reduced keratinocytes expressed higher levels of HO-1 than control cells in response to H2O2, Bach1 down-regulation did not attenuate the production of reactive oxygen species by H2O2. In contrast, Bach1 overexpression abolished HO-1 induction by H2O2, which led to increased reactive oxygen species accumulation. HO-1 was induced during keratinocyte differentiation, but MARE activity did not change during differentiation. Furthermore, Bach1 overexpression did not inhibit differentiation-associated induction of HO-1 expression, suggesting that HO-1 induction in differentiation is independent of Bach1. Thus, in response to oxidative stress, Bach1 regulates the oxidation state through the negative control of HO-1 expression prior to terminal keratinocyte differentiation. However, Bach1-mediated repression is negated during keratinocyte differentiation.

The skin is constantly exposed to harmful ROS that are generated by pro-oxidant agents in the environment, as well as by endogenous cellular oxidants. Thus, keratinocytes strongly and constitutively express ROS-detoxifying enzymes, including superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and reductase, and contain substantial levels of the antioxidants tocopherol and ubiquinol (2Briganti S.

An imbalance between ROS and antioxidants can lead to the generation of high oxidant levels, which play a pivotal role in skin aging and disease (6Wojas-Pelc A. Marcinkiewicz J. Int. J. Exp.

Bach1 forms heterodimers with the basic leucine zipper subfamily of small Maf proteins (i.e. MafF, MafG, and MafK), which bind the Maf recognition element (MARE) in the promoter regions of genes such as HO-1, NADP(H) quinone (oxido)reductase, and β-globin (7Igarashi K.

In the presence of oxidative stress, Bach1 is inactivated (11Ishikawa M. Numazawa S. Yoshida T. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2005; 38: 1344-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 12Suzuki H.

Thus, redox regulation is partly mediated by reciprocal DNA-MARE binding by the Bach1 repressor and other transcriptional activators. Heme oxygenases HO-1 and HO-2 are the rate-limiting enzymes in heme degradation (14Shibahara S. Tohoku J. Exp. Med. 2003; 200: 167-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). HO-1 is an inducible enzyme, and HO-2 is constitutively expressed. Heme is a critical prosthetic group for many organisms and is synthesized in virtually all cells. However, free heme is a potent pro-oxidant that catalyzes the formation of ROS by the Fenton reaction (14Shibahara S. Tohoku J. Exp. Med. 2003; 200: 167-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). HO-1 converts excess heme into ferrous iron, carbon monoxide, and biliverdin, which is reduced to bilirubin by biliverdin reductase. Carbon monoxide and biliverdin, as well as bilirubin, have anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties in vivo (15Baranano D.E. Rao M. Ferris C.D. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 16093-16098Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar, 16Otterbein L.E. Soares M.P. Yamashita K. Bach F.H. Trends Immunol. 2003; 24: 449-455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar), suggesting a role for HO-1 in the conversion of heme into antioxidants for defense against ROS. The transcription of Hmox-1, which encodes HO-1, is induced by oxidative stress (14Shibahara S. Tohoku J. Exp. Med. 2003; 200: 167-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). As the inducible enhancers of Hmox-1 carry multiple MAREs, HO-1 transcription is regulated by the balance between Bach1 and transcriptional activators. The epidermis constitutes the primary defense mechanism of the body against oxidative damage. HO-1 is induced during keratinocyte differentiation and is highly expressed in the upper layers of the epidermis (17Numata I. Okuyama R. Memezawa A. Ito Y. Takeda K. Furuyama K. Shibahara S. Aiba S. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2009; 129: 2594-2603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism of Bach1-mediated HO-1 regulation in keratinocytes remains unclear. Here, we investigated the role of Bach1 in HO-1 regulation and ROS production. The Bach1 expression plasmid (plasmid pCMV/Bach1) has been described previously (8Oyake T. Itoh K. Motohashi H. Hayashi N. Hoshino H. Nishizawa M. Yamamoto M. Igarashi K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6083-6095Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). The pRBGP3 and pRBGP2 plasmids contain no copies or three copies, respectively, of the MARE region (5′-TCG ACC CGA AAG GAG CTG ACT CAT GCT AGC CC-3′) upstream of the thymidine kinase promoter in pGL2-TK (18Igarashi K.

The reporter plasmids for the regulatory regions of HO-1 (pHO15luc) and Blimp1 possess MARE regions (10Sun J. Hoshino H. Takaku K. Nakajima O. Muto A. Suzuki H. Tashiro S. Takahashi S. Shibahara S.

The pHO15luc reporter plasmid contains the 15 kb of DNA upstream of the mouse HO-1 gene and was previously shown to recapitulate inducible expression of the HO-1 gene in response to heme, cadmium, and H2O2 (19Alam J.

Polyclonal antiserum against Bach1 (A1–6) was produced as described previously (21Suzuki H. Tashiro S. Hira S. Sun J. Yamazaki C. Zenke Y. Ikeda-Saito M. Yoshida M. Igarashi K. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2544-2553Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The following antibodies were purchased and used as recommended by their suppliers: rabbit anti-HO-1 (Abcam, Tokyo, Japan); goat anti-lamin B (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Tokyo, Japan); and mouse monoclonal anti-α-tubulin (Sigma). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG, goat anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Biosciences), and rabbit anti-goat IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used as secondary antibodies. Primary keratinocytes were prepared from newborn ICR mouse epidermis, as described previously (22Okuyama R. Ogawa E. Nagoshi H. Yabuki M. Kurihara A. Terui T. Aiba S. Obinata M. Tagami H. Ikawa S. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 4478-4488Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In brief, the epidermis was separated from the dermis with 0.25% trypsin (Invitrogen) overnight at 4 °C, plated in dishes precoated with type I collagen (Nitta Gelatin, Osaka, Japan), and cultured in minimum essential medium supplemented with 4% Chelex-treated fetal calf serum, epidermal growth factor (10 ng/ml; Invitrogen), and 0.05 mm CaCl2. Under these conditions, keratinocytes were maintained in an immature state, and differentiation was induced by addition of CaCl2 to a final concentration of 2 mm, as described elsewhere (23Hennings H. Michael D. Cheng C. Steinert P. Holbrook K. Yuspa S.H. Cell. 1980; 19: 245-254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1507) Google Scholar). Primary keratinocytes were also prepared from the newborn mouse epidermis of Bach1−/− mice and Bach1+/+ mice using the procedure described above. The generation of Bach1−/− mice has been described previously (10Sun J. Hoshino H. Takaku K. Nakajima O. Muto A. Suzuki H. Tashiro S. Takahashi S. Shibahara S. Alam J. Taketo M.M. Yamamoto M. Igarashi K. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5216-5224Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). The study was carried out in accordance with international ethical guidelines for laboratory animals and was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. The following reagents were purchased from the indicated commercial sources: H2O2 (Wako, Osaka, Japan), doxycycline and the γ-secretase inhibitor N-[N-(3,5-difluorophenylacetyl)-l-alanyl]-S-phenylglycine t-butyl ester (Sigma), H2DCFDA (Invitrogen), the JNK inhibitor II, protein kinase C (PKC) α/β inhibitor Gö6976, the PKCδ/θ inhibitor rottlerin (Merck), the ERK inhibitor PD98059, and p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 (Cell Signaling Technology, Tokyo, Japan). The ATP assay kit was performed according to the supplier's instructions (Bioassay Systems, Hayward, CA). Transfections were carried out using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To assess promoter activity, transfected keratinocytes were subjected to a Dual-Luciferase reporter assay (Promega, Tokyo, Japan) 72 h after transfection. Relative luciferase activities were normalized to Renilla luciferase activity. The small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) specific to Bach1 (B-1, B-2, and B-3) were purchased from Invitrogen, together with a stealth siRNA as a control. The HO-1-specific siRNA sequences were as follows: HO-1 siRNA1, 5′-AUC ACC AGC UUA AAG CCU UCU CUG G-3′; HO-1 siRNA2, 5′-CCA GAG AAG GCU UUA AGC UGG UGA U-3′. Recombinant adenoviruses expressing either Bach1 (Ad-Bach1) or lacZ (Ad-LacZ) were generated as described previously and used at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 25 (22Okuyama R. Ogawa E. Nagoshi H. Yabuki M. Kurihara A. Terui T. Aiba S. Obinata M. Tagami H. Ikawa S. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 4478-4488Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 24Ogawa E. Okuyama R. Egawa T. Nagoshi H.

Bach1 expression was induced by a regulatory virus (Ad-TO; Adeno-X Tet-On; Clontech) with the addition of doxycycline (100 ng/ml). Total cell proteins were extracted from cultured keratinocytes as described previously (22Okuyama R. Ogawa E. Nagoshi H. Yabuki M. Kurihara A. Terui T. Aiba S. Obinata M. Tagami H. Ikawa S. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 4478-4488Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Nuclear proteins were purified according to the manufacturer's protocol (nuclear extract kit; Active Motif, Tokyo, Japan). The extracted proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore, Tokyo, Japan). The membranes were blocked with TBST (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.5% Tween 20) containing 5% nonfat dried milk, incubated with primary antibodies, rinsed with TBST, and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. After additional rinses, the blots were exposed to LumiGLO reagent (Cell Signaling Technology) and subsequently to x-ray film. Protein concentrations were normalized using a BCA protein assay (Pierce), and equal loading was assessed by α-tubulin immunoblot. Total RNA was prepared from primary keratinocytes using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Tokyo) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cDNAs were synthesized using SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and 3 μg of total RNA as a template. Real time PCR analyses were performed with a Quantitect SYBR Green PCR kit (Qiagen) and an iCycler (Bio-Rad) using the following primers: Bach1, 5′-GCC CGT ATG CTT GTG TGA TT-3′ and 5′-CGT GAG AGC GAA ATT ATC CG-3′; HO-1, 5′-GGG TGA CAG AAG AGG CTA AG-3′ and 5′-GTG TCT GGG ATG AGC TAG TG-3′; and Nrf2, 5′-CAA GAC TTG GGC CAC TTA AAA GAC-3′ and 5′-AGT AAG GCT TTC CAT CCT CAT CAC-3′. ChIP analyses were performed as described previously (25Sun J. Brand M. Zenke Y. Tashiro S. Groudine M. Igarashi K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 1461-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). In brief, keratinocytes were cross-linked with formaldehyde (1% final concentration) for 15 min at room temperature. Nuclear fractions were sonicated to break the DNA into fragments with an average length of ∼200–500 bp and extracts subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-Bach1 (A1–6) or normal rabbit serum. After releasing cross-linked DNA from the immunoprecipitated materials with 10 mm dithiothreitol, samples were incubated for 6 h at 65 °C to remove formaldehyde from the DNA. After purification with a QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen), the recovered DNAs were subjected to PCR analyses. PCR analyses were performed using Takara LA Taq (Takara, Ohtsu, Japan) and an iCycler with primers capable of amplifying DNA fragments in the vicinity of the MARE motifs in the regulatory regions of HO-1, Blimp1, and Mcm5. The promoter of Mcm5, a gene adjacent to HO-1, was used as a control. The following primers were used for PCR amplification of reporters: HO-1 E1, 5′-TGA AGT TAA AGC CGT TCC GG-3′ and 5′-AGC GGC TGG AAT GCT GAG T-3′; HO-1 E2, 5′-GGG CTA GCA TGC GAA GTG AG-3′ and 5′-AGA CTC CGC CCT AAG GGT TC-3′; Blimp1 promoter MARE, 5′-CTG ACA CTT ACA TGG TAT CTG TGC CC-3′ and 5′-AAA TCC AGC CTC CTG CAG AGG-3′; and Blimp1 intron 5 MARE, 5′-GTT AAT CTG CTT TCT CGG TTT C-3′ and 5′-TCT TAA ATG GCT GTA GGC GGA C-3′. The Mcm5 promoter primers were as described previously (25Sun J. Brand M. Zenke Y. Tashiro S. Groudine M. Igarashi K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 1461-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). To quantify ROS, cultured keratinocytes were incubated with 100 or 500 μm H2O2 for 12 h and then stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated H2DCFDA. Analyses were performed using a FACSCalibur instrument with CellQuest software (BD Biosciences). Data were analyzed using an unpaired Student's t test. Differences were considered statistically significant for p values less than 0.05. First, we examined the effect of Bach1 on transactivation in keratinocytes. The activity of Bach1 in keratinocytes was accessed by transfecting them with the MARE reporter pRBG2 and a Bach1 expression plasmid. Exogenous Bach1 suppressed MARE activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1A), suggesting that Bach1 acts to repress gene function. Bach1 did not affect the basal activity of the promoter (pRBG3 lacking MARE). Furthermore, we analyzed the effects of Bach1 on transactivation of HO-1 and Blimp1. Blimp1 is important for keratinocyte differentiation (26Magnúsdóttir E. Kalachikov S. Mizukoshi K. Savitsky D. Ishida-Yamamoto A. Panteleyev A.A. Calame K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 14988-14993Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and is repressed by Bach2, a paralogue of Bach1, in B lymphoid cells (27Muto A. Tashiro S. Nakajima O. Hoshino H. Takahashi S. Sakoda E. Ikebe D. Yamamoto M. Igarashi K. Nature. 2004; 429: 566-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The HO-1 reporter pHO15luc contains a region of 15 kb of DNA upstream of the murine HO-1 gene. The induction of HO-1 in response to heme and other stresses is regulated principally by two upstream enhancers within this 15-kb region, E1 and E2, both of which contain MAREs (19Alam J. Wicks C. Stewart D. Gong P. Touchard C. Otterbein S. Choi A.M. Burow M.E. Tou J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27694-27702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). The Blimp1 promoter also possesses a MARE region (25Sun J. Brand M. Zenke Y. Tashiro S. Groudine M. Igarashi K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 1461-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Bach1 repressed expression of both reporter genes (Fig. 1, B and C). Subsequently, we tested for binding of Bach1 to the HO-1 enhancer regions (E1 and E2) and Blimp1 regulatory regions (promoter MARE region and intron 5 MARE region (28Ochiai K. Muto A. Tanaka H. Takahashi S. Igarashi K. Int. Immunol. 2008; 20: 453-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar)) by ChIP analysis (Fig. 1D). Bach1 bound to the E1 and E2 HO-1 enhancer regions. In contrast, no association of Bach1 with the Blimp1 regulatory regions was detected. However, we could not exclude the possibility of an association between Bach1 and the Blimp1 regulatory region. The association of MafK with the Blimp1 regulatory region was much weaker than its association with the HO-1 enhancer, as detected by ChIP assay (data not shown). Therefore, the affinity of Bach1 for the Blimp1 regulatory region may be lower than that for the HO-1 enhancer. Because we detected a direct association between Bach1 and the HO-1 enhancer region, we next focused on oxidative stress-induced expression of HO-1. H2O2 increased both the amount of HO-1 protein (Fig. 2A) and the activity of the HO-1 enhancer region (Fig. 2B). MARE activation also increased in response to H2O2 (Fig. 2C). The increased MARE activity was consistent with HO-1 induction, because the HO-1 enhancer contains multiple MAREs. Bach1 activity is regulated at various levels, including ubiquitin-dependent degradation, nuclear localization, and changes in DNA affinity (7Igarashi K. Sun J. Antioxid. Redox. Signal. 2006; 8: 107-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 29Zenke-Kawasaki Y. Dohi Y. Katoh Y. Ikura T. Ikura M. Asahara T. Tokunaga F. Iwai K. Igarashi K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 6962-6971Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Next, we examined the amount of Bach1 in total and nuclear cellular fractions. Bach1 levels remained constant in total cellular fraction despite H2O2 addition and were slightly increased in nuclear cellular fraction (Fig. 2D), suggesting that neither degradation nor nuclear export contributed to the increase in MARE activation. Because Bach1 is regulated by the redox status of its cysteine residues, this regulation is likely in response to H2O2 (11Ishikawa M. Numazawa S. Yoshida T. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2005; 38: 1344-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In addition, we compared the levels of Bach1, Nrf2, HO-1, and HO-2 expression in primary keratinocytes and in primary dermal fibroblasts. Bach1 is expressed ubiquitously (8Oyake T. Itoh K. Motohashi H. Hayashi N. Hoshino H. Nishizawa M. Yamamoto M. Igarashi K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6083-6095Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar) and in keratinocytes (30Reichard J.F. Sartor M.A. Puga A. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 22363-22370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 31Zhong J.L. Raval C. Edwards G.P. Tyrrell R.M. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2010; 48: 196-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis revealed that Bach1 levels were similar in primary keratinocytes and primary dermal fibroblasts (Fig. 2E). Nrf2 was also expressed at similar levels in both cell types. However, keratinocytes exhibited lower levels of HO-1 compared with dermal fibroblasts. Furthermore, lower HO-1 levels were present after treatment with H2O2 in keratinocytes (Fig. 2F). A similar level of HO-2 expression in these cells suggests that the differential expression of HO-1 is not a result of alterations in HO-2 expression. Although the levels of Bach1 and Nrf2 in keratinocytes were similar to those in dermal fibroblasts, Bach1 appeared to be the defining feature for the regulation of HO-1 expression in keratinocytes. To investigate the function of Bach1 in the regulation of HO-1 in keratinocytes, we examined the levels of ROS in Bach1−/− keratinocytes. Consistent with earlier results showing that Bach1 negatively regulates expression of the HO-1 reporter gene (Fig. 1B), Bach1−/− keratinocytes expressed higher levels of HO-1 mRNA and protein than wild-type cells under normal conditions (Fig. 3, A and B). Furthermore, H2O2 treatment resulted in much higher levels of HO-1 in Bach1−/− keratinocytes (Fig. 3B) than HO-1 levels in wild-type keratinocytes. These results indicate that Bach1 was responsible not only for the repression of basal HO-1 levels but also for the attenuation of HO-1 expression induced by oxidative stress conditions. Because increased HO-1 levels are predicted to protect against ROS, we examined whether Bach1 deletion and subsequent HO-1 increase was sufficient to protect keratinocytes against oxidative stress. ROS levels increase within the cell upon treatment with H2O2. However, despite the higher level of HO-1 expression, ROS accumulation was not attenuated by the loss of Bach1 (Fig. 3C). Rather, ROS levels were higher in Bach1−/− keratinocytes than control cells, regardless of H2O2 treatment. To check effects of Bach1 down-regulation on ROS levels further, we next compared HO-1 expression before and after Bach1 knockdown by RNA interference (RNAi). Bach1 was knocked down by transient transfection with siRNA constructs that targeted three different regions of the Bach1 transcript. Similar to the Bach1−/− keratinocytes, reduced Bach1 levels resulted in increased HO-1 expression (Fig. 3D). H2O2 treatment resulted in higher levels of HO-1 in Bach1-depleted keratinocytes (Fig. 3E), but ROS accumulation was not decreased by Bach1 depletion (Fig. 3F). Similar to Bach1 gene deletion, RNAi inhibition of Bach1 expression increased ROS levels in the presence or absence of H2O2 treatment. Taken together, these results suggest that Bach1 down-regulation enhances HO-1 expression but is not sufficient to suppress ROS production. To analyze the downstream effects of Bach1 down-regulated keratinocytes, we examined cell viability. Regardless of oxidative stress, the Bach1 down-regulation resulted in lowered keratinocyte viability (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, we quantified ATP levels because several heme proteins function in the mitochondria for energy production. The reduced Bach1 levels caused a decrease of ATP levels in both normal and oxidative stress conditions (Fig. 4B). These results suggest that HO-1 overexpression may lead to a disruption of energy production rather than protection against oxidative stress. We further examined the effects of combined knockdown of Bach1 and HO-1 in keratinocytes by using HO-1-specific siRNA constructs. RNAi-mediated suppression of HO-1 mRNA decreased HO-1 levels even in the Bach1-depleted keratinocytes, regardless of oxidative stress (Fig. 4, C and D). The HO-1 knockdown attenuated the decreased cell viability by the Bach1 knockdown in both normal and oxidative stress conditions (Fig. 4E). In addition, the reduced HO-1 levels also abolished the decreased ATP levels in the Bach1-depleted keratinocytes (Fig. 4F). Thus, Bach1 appears to suppress HO-1 induction to maintain cellular homeostasis, particularly in energy production. We next used an adenoviral transduction system to examine the effects of Bach1 overexpression. Using the Tet-On system, Bach1 expression was efficiently induced in keratinocytes (Fig. 5A). In the absence of oxidative stress, Bach1 overexpression did not alter the basal level of HO-1 expression in keratinocytes (Fig. 5B), showing that endogenous HO-1 expression is not dependent on the MARE elements in the E1 and E2 enhancer regions. In contrast, HO-1 induction in response to H2O2 was almost completely inhibited by overexpression of Bach1 in keratinocytes (Fig. 5C). Consequently, ROS levels were much higher in Bach1-overexpressing cells than in control cells (Fig. 5D). Taken together, these results suggest that Bach1-mediated repression of HO-1 is specific to stress-induced HO-1 expression and was not effective in regulation of basal HO-1 levels under normal culture conditions. Interestingly, Bach1 up-regulation abolished cellular responses against oxidative stress, which resulted in ROS accumulation. We next examined the role of Bach1 in the regulation of HO-1 during keratinocyte differentiation. Upon transfer of keratinocytes to high calcium medium, thereby forcing differentiation and the expression of keratins 1 and 10, loricrin, and filaggrin, the expression of HO-1 gradually and steadily increased at both the mRNA and protein levels (Fig. 6, A and B). In contrast, MARE reporter activity and HO-1 reporter activity did not increase during this differentiation period (Fig. 6, C and D). In addition, the level of the Bach1 transcript remained constant over this process (Fig. 6E). Similar to Bach1 levels, Nrf2 mRNA levels remained constant during differentiation. The protein levels of Bach1 and Nrf2 were increased in the nuclear fraction (Fig. 6F). Thus, HO-1 expression was induced by keratinocyte differentiation, but this induction was independent of both increased MARE activity and derepression of Bach1-mediated inhibition of HO-1 expression."
https://openalex.org/W2104431882,"There has been substantial growth in the numbers of patients with conjunctival squamous cell carcinoma infected with HIV in East Africa. The natural history of the conjunctival squamous cell carcinoma appears to be unique in this region of the world, but the etiologic mechanism unclear and therapeutic options limited. This research was carried out to determine if conjunctival squamous cell carcinoma harbors human papillomavirus DNA and is associated with activation of the EGFR signaling pathway. Positive findings would identify etiologic causes and provide clinical guidance to improve treatment.Expression of p-MAPK/MAPK, p-Akt/Akt and p-EGFR/EGFR in cell nuclei and cytoplasm of 38 FFPE specimens were assessed by immunohistochemistry; HPV genotype was detected by qPCR assay; EGFR mutation was assessed by DNA sequencing analysis; and EGFR mRNA expression was measured using relative qPCR. Statistical analyses included two-sided Fisher exact test or chi-square test, Spearman correlation coefficient and ANOVA. HPV 18 was found in 61% of samples, with HPV 16 double-genotype in 6 patients (16%). Immunohistochemistry and qPCR data suggest that activation and expression of the EGFR signaling pathway is related to disease progression of conjunctival cancer. The associations between cytoplasmic p-MAPK, cytoplasmic p-Akt and tumor invasiveness were significant (p = 0.05 or 0.028). Nuclear p-EGFR appeared only in invasive tumors. A significant positive association between EGFR expression and disease invasiveness was observed (p = 0.01). A SNP in 10 patients and one missense mutation were found within EGFR tyrosine kinase domain. Statistical analysis indicates that patients with measurable EGFR expression more likely harbor EGFR mutations, compared to those with negative EGFR expression (35.3% vs. 0%).We conclude that HPV types 16/18 infection is frequent in East African patients with AIDS-associated squamous cell carcinoma of the conjunctiva. EGFR activation/alteration may contribute to and sustain the high prevalence of this cancer. Our findings hint that adoption of HPV vaccination strategies may impact the incidence of conjunctival carcinoma. Agents that target the EGFR pathway may have potential therapeutic benefit."
https://openalex.org/W2166171456,"How do we recognize emotions from other people? One possibility is that our own emotional experiences guide us in the online recognition of emotion in others. A distinct but related possibility is that emotion experience helps us to learn how to recognize emotions in childhood.We explored these ideas in a large sample of people (N = 4,608) ranging from 5 to over 50 years old. Participants were asked to rate the intensity of emotional experience in their own lives, as well as to perform a task of facial emotion recognition. Those who reported more intense experience of fear and happiness were significantly more accurate (closer to prototypical) in recognizing facial expressions of fear and happiness, respectively, and intense experience of fear was associated also with more accurate recognition of surprised and happy facial expressions. The associations held across all age groups.These results suggest that the intensity of one's own emotional experience of fear and happiness correlates with the ability to recognize these emotions in others, and demonstrate such an association as early as age 5."
https://openalex.org/W1996560705,"The chemokine receptor CXCR4 is shared by primary and laboratory-adapted strains of feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) for viral entry. Our previous studies implicated a contiguous nine-amino-acid region of the V3 loop of the FIV envelope surface as important in CXCR4 binding and virus entry. The binding is specific for CXCR4 since it can be inhibited by AMD3100, a selective CXCR4 inhibitor. Additional site-directed mutagenesis was used to further reveal the key residues. Binding studies indicated that basic residues R395, K397, R399 as well as N398 are critical for CXCR4 binding. The effect of other amino acid residues on receptor binding depends on the type of amino acid residue substituted. The binding study results were confirmed on human CXCR4-expressing SupT1 cells and correlated with entry efficiency using a virus entry assay. Amino acid residues critical for CXCR4 are not critical for interactions with the primary binding receptor CD134, which has an equivalent role as CD4 for HIV-1 binding. The ELISA results show that W394 and W400 are crucial for the recognition by neutralizing anti-V3 antibodies. Since certain strains of HIV-1 also use CXCR4 as the entry receptor, the findings make the feline model attractive for development of broad-based entry antagonists and for study of the molecular mechanism of receptor/virus interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2026404100,"During Xenopus gastrulation alpha5beta1 integrin function is modulated in a temporally and spatially restricted manner, however, the regulatory mechanisms behind this regulation remain uncharacterized. Here we report that XGIPC/kermit2 binds to the cytoplasmic domain of the alpha5 subunit and regulates the activity of alpha5beta1 integrin. The interaction of kermit2 with alpha5beta1 is essential for fibronectin (FN) matrix assembly during the early stages of gastrulation. We further demonstrate that kermit2 regulates alpha5beta1 integrin endocytosis downstream of activin signaling. Inhibition of kermit2 function impairs cell migration but not adhesion to FN substrates indicating that integrin recycling is essential for mesoderm cell migration. Furthermore, we find that the alpha5beta1 integrin is colocalized with kermit2 and Rab 21 in embryonic and XTC cells. These data support a model where region specific mesoderm induction acts through kermit2 to regulate the temporally and spatially restricted changes in adhesive properties of the alpha5beta1 integrin through receptor endocytosis."
https://openalex.org/W2167288238,"Miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements (MITEs), which are common in eukaryotic genomes, are small non-coding elements that transpose by utilizing transposases encoded by autonomous transposons. Recent genome-wide analyses and cross-mobilization assays have greatly improved our knowledge on MITE proliferation, however, specific mechanisms for the origin and evolution of MITEs are still unclear.A group of coral MITEs called CMITE were identified from two corals, Acropora millepora and Acropora palmata. CMITEs conform to many common characteristics of MITEs, but also present several unusual features. The most unusual feature of CMITEs is conservation of the internal region, which is more conserved between MITE families than the TIRs. The origin of this internal region remains unknown, although we found one CMITE family that seems to be derived from a piggyBac-like transposon in A. millepora. CMITEs can form tandem arrays, suggesting an unconventional way for MITEs to increase copy numbers. We also describe a case in which a novel transposable element was created by a CMITE insertion event.To our knowledge, this is the first report of identification of MITEs from coral genomes. Proliferation of CMITEs seems to be related to the transposition machinery of piggyBac-like autonomous transposons. The highly conserved internal region of CMITEs suggests a potential role for this region in their successful transposition. However, the origin of these unusual features in CMITEs remains unclear, and thus represents an intriguing topic for future investigations."

In this work, we selected a panel of strains in which it is possible to investigate the influence of a library of molecules on growth rate, respiratory metabolism (HAP1), and multidrug-membrane function (ERG6, SNQ2, and PDR3). Peptidomimetics (20.Gante J. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1994; 33: 1699-1720Crossref Scopus (888) Google Scholar) play a prominent role as candidate compounds to induce phenotypic effects on biological systems. In fact, side-chain recognition dominates biological interactions of almost all cellular processes; thus, peptidomimetics, initially developed for their property of preventing degradation and improving oral bioavailability of peptide-based drugs, have been envisaged as a tool for perturbing such interactions and identifying protein function. Small peptide-based agents have attracted wide interest as cancer-targeting and anti-infective agents, and there is a need to develop new high affinity and high specificity peptidomimetic or small molecule ligands in such widespread pathologies. Success in this area depends on the ability to create novel complex molecular structures of a peptidomimetic nature as tools for probing protein-protein interactions. Diversity-oriented synthesis (21.Burke M.D. Schreiber S.L. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed.

Three wild-type strains were used: W303 (MATα can1-100 ade2-1 his3-11,15 leu2-3,112 trp1-1, ura3-1), BY4742 (MATα his3 leu2 lys2 ura3), and 0117. The deletion strains used were BY4742Δsnq2 (MATα his3 leu2 lys2 ura3 snq2::kanMX), BY4742Δpdr3 (MATα his3 leu2 lys2 ura3 pdr3::kanMX4), and BY4742Δerg6 (MATα his3 leu2 lys2 ura3 erg6::kanMX4). Yeast strains used to simulate the HAP1 pattern of BY4742 were FY2607 (MATa ura3 his3 leu2 lys2-128TM hap1T), FY2609 (MATa ura3 his3 leu2 lys2-128TM) and FY2611 (MATa ura3 his3 leu2 lys2-128TM hap1:kanMX4). For growth inhibition tests, yeast cells were inoculated at 1 × 105 cells/ml in YPD medium (yeast peptone dextrose, yeast extract 1% (w/v), peptone 2% (w/v), buffered at pH 4.8 with acetic acid, 2% glucose). First level assays allowed the selection of a restricted number of active molecules. W303 and 0117 strains were grown in YPD. The different cultures were dispensed at equal volume onto 96-well plates, each well containing a different compound at a concentration of 0.1 mm. The assay plates were incubated at 28 °C with shaking, and yeast growth was scored by measurement of A650 with a Victor high throughput microplate spectrophotometer equipped with a 96-well plate reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) every 2 h for the first 24 h and then once a day for 7 days. Compounds responsible for the variation in cell growth during the exponential phase or in the OD650 value of the stationary phase or both were selected for further characterization. These compounds were tested at concentrations of 1, 0.5, 0.4, 0.3, 0.2, and 0.1 mm. Second level assays were carried out to give more insight into the results obtained from the first run of assays. Molecules selected because of their significant effects on the wild-type strains at the concentration of 0.3 mm were tested on BY4742Δerg6, BY4742Δsnq2, and BY4742Δpdr3 strains. Strains were grown in YPD supplemented with the molecule at 0.3 mm concentration and monitored with the same protocol applied in the first level assay. The OD650 values used to define the growth curves were evaluated as the difference between OD650 at tx and OD650 at t0. The percentage effect of each molecule (% effect) was calculated as a function of the OD650 value of treated cells in the stationary phase (OD650st.ph.treat) and the OD650 of untreated cells in the stationary phase (OD650st.ph.ctrl).% effect =OD650st.ph.treat −OD650st.ph.ctrl OD650st.ph.ttrl ×100(Eq. 1) Wild-type strains (W303 and BY4742) were grown in 2 ml of YPD (pH 4.8) supplemented with the most active compound, 089 ((7R)-3-benzhydryl-2-oxo-5-phenyl-6,8-dioxa-3-aza-bicycle[3.2.1]octane-7-carboxyl-ethylamide), at concentrations of 1, 0.5, 0.4, 0.3, 0.2, and 0.1 mm. The assay cultures were incubated at 28 °C with shaking. After 3 days, the concentration of the cells was determined, and 100 cells were plated (100 cells/plate) on YPD agar (in two replicates). After 5 days, colony-forming units were calculated, and the concentration-effect curve of the treatment was plotted. This test was carried out with the LIVE/DEAD® yeast viability assay (Molecular Probes), following the manufacturer's instructions, and with the methylene blue assay determining the survival rate of the two wild-type W303 and BY4742 strains and of the BY4742Δerg6, BY4742Δsnq2, and BY4742Δpdr3 strains. Cells were grown in YPD supplemented with 089 at concentrations of 1, 0.5, 0.4, 0.2, and 0.1 mm; a positive control was also carried out without the compound. The assay cultures were incubated at 28 °C, and after 2 and 4 h, aliquots were processed with the LIVE/DEAD and methylene blue assays, permitting calculation of the survival rate (number of live cells counted × 100/total number of cells in the positive control culture). Yeast microarrays were constructed as described previously (27.Landry C.R. Oh J. Hartl D.L. Cavalieri D. Gene. 2006; 366: 343-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Yeast cells (BY4742, BY4742Δerg6, and BY4742Δsnq2 strains) were treated in YPD (pH 4.8) supplemented with 089 at 0.2 mm concentration and incubated at 28 °C with shaking for 4 h. RNA was extracted from about 1 × 109 cells using the hot acid phenol/chloroform protocol. RNAs were quantified spectrophotometrically using Nanodrop and by measuring the absorbance at 230, 260, and 280 nm and then calculating the 260/230 and 260/280 ratios and considering good data to be values of 1.8–2.2. RNA integrity was checked by electrophoresis in 1% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide. RNAs from cells treated with 089 (labeled with Cy5) were compared with RNAs from cells grown in YPD as the reference sample (labeled with Cy3) (CyDye Mono-Reactive Dye Pack, Amersham Biosciences). The labeling method used was the indirect method described by DeRisi (see the University of California San Francisco DeRisi laboratory Web site). Hybridization took place at 63 °C for 14–16 h. Fluorescent cDNA bound to the microarray was detected with a GenePix 4000B microarray scanner (Axon Instruments), using the GenePixPro6.1 software package to quantify microarray fluorescence. The control microarray spot quality required the following features: 50% as the minimum percentage of pixels for which the foreground intensity was greater than the background intensity + 2 S.D. values; 80 pixels as the minimum number of pixels; absence of saturated pixels. Median values for the foreground and background of each channel were normalized using the MIDAW Web tool (28.Romualdi C. Vitulo N. Del Favero M. Lanfranchi G. Nucleic. Acids. Res. 2005; 33: W644-W649Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). A -fold change cut-off of 1.5 filtered by variance coefficient was used to select differentially expressed genes. Genes within each group were examined for functional enrichment using Gene Ontology categories. Normalized transcriptional data were analyzed with Eu.Gene Analyzer 5.1 (29.Cavalieri D. Castagnini C.

Clustering of pathway-based analysis of microarray data was performed according to the procedure described in Ref. 35.Beltrame L. Rizzetto L. Paola R. Rocca-Serra P. Gambineri L. Battaglia C.

After 4 h of treatment with 089 at 0.2 mm concentration, or without it as a control, cultured cells were resuspended at 1 × 106 cells/ml in 10 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, containing 5% glucose. Rhodamine B hexyl ester (Molecular Probes) was added to a final concentration of 100 nm. After 15–30 min of incubation, the mitochondrial membrane potential was visualized by fluorescence microscopy (excitation λ at 555 nm, green; emission λ at 579 nm, red). An equal aliquot of cells was treated with dihydrorhodamine 123 (Molecular Probes) to analyze endogenous reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, observed after 60 min of incubation (excitation λ at 505 nm, blue; emission λ at 534 nm, green). Each aliquot was treated with Calcofluor White (M2R) (blue) to show the cell wall in order to count total cells. Several easily detectable phenotypes in the yeast cell are related to growth rate, respiratory metabolism, and cell wall-multidrug resistance. The panel of strains of the budding yeast we have selected encompasses S. cerevisiae wild type for respiratory function and multidrug resistance, two laboratory strains, W303 and FY2609, and one wine strain, 0117. We probed the effect of the molecules on respiration by using strains altered in the respiratory function, BY4742 and FY2607, that harbor a mutation caused by a transposon in the HAP1 coding sequence that reduces Hap1p function by 75% (4.Hoon S.

This mutation was studied alone and in combination with other deficiencies in genes involved in cell wall and multidrug resistance (Δerg6, Δsnq2, and Δpdr3). Erg6p is a sterol 24C-methyl transferase, which is involved in the synthesis of ergosterol; Snq2p is a drug efflux pump belonging to the family of the ATP-binding cassette transporters, conferring resistance to many drugs and oxygen radicals; Pdr3p is a zinc finger protein, a transcriptional co-activator (in association with Pdr1p) of genes encoding ATP-binding cassette transporters. The effects of 104 compounds, composing a preconstituted library, each at 0.1 mm concentration, were initially tested on W303 and 0117 wild-type strains. These molecules (supplemental Table 1), which are both secondary and tertiary amides based on the 6,8-dioxa-3-azabicyclo[3.2.1]-octane scaffold (Table 1), were synthesized as described previously (22.Guarna A.

One of the tested compounds induced a growth rate increase between 10 and 20%, whereas 22 compounds resulted in a decrease between 10 and 20%, and six molecules resulted in a decrease between 20 and 50% of growth rate (supplemental Table 2). Thus, higher concentrations (1 and 0.5 mm) of the compounds inducing more than 10% growth decrease at a concentration of 0.1 mm were tested. Effects of intermediate concentration (0.4, 0.3, and 0.2 mm) of 16 molecules inducing a more than 80% growth decrease in W303 were then investigated (Table 2).TABLE 2Structures and effects of compounds selected from the first level assay To gain insight into the effect of the molecules on fundamental cellular functions, second level assays were conceived by testing the effect of the selected molecules on a panel of deletion mutant strains constructed in the BY4742 genetic background, compared with the parental strain. Notably, molecules that were selected because of their ability to negatively affect the growth rate of W303 and 0117 mostly induced an increase or only a weak decrease in growth rate in BY4742. This observation suggests that the different genetic backgrounds of these two strains influenced the results. W303 and BY4742 are highly genetically similar, although one of the most striking differences is the presence of a transposon insertion in the coding region of the HAP1 gene in the BY4742 strain. The alteration in Hap1p function is known to reduce BY4742 respiratory ability (4.Hoon S. St Onge R.P. Giaever G. Nislow C. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2008; 29: 499-504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 17.Brem R.B. Yvert G. Clinton R. Kruglyak L.

Bioeng. 2004; 98: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The effect of the 16 compounds that induced a decrease between 10 and 20% in the wild-type genetic context was further tested on BY4742Δerg6, BY4742Δsnq2, and BY4742Δpdr3 strains at a concentration of 0.3 mm, which is the minimum concentration that induced an effect on the wild-type strain (Fig. 1). Five of the compounds tested, 011, 012, 018, 022 and 028, decreased the growth rate of W303, whereas they showed no effects on BY4742 and an increase in BY4742Δsnq2 and BY4742Δerg6 mutant strains. This effect can be attributed to an increase in the intracellular/cytoplasmic concentration of the molecule, due to a defect in the efflux activity (deletion of SNQ2) or to a higher membrane permeability (deletion of ERG6). Four of the molecules tested were able to increase the growth rate of BY4742. Specifically, 066 and 067 exerted the same effect even on Pdr3p and Snq2p; 038 and 053 induced an increase in growth rate even on Pdr3p, Snq2p, and Erg6p. Further assays on 089, which was identified as the molecule inducing the most intense cell growth decrease (more than 80%), showed that after 18 h of treatment at 0.3 mm concentration, the variation in OD650 value of the culture of BY4742Δerg6 became negative due to cell death, confirmed by microscopic observation with LIVE/DEAD (live cells converting the green fluorescent intracellular staining FUN1 dye into red fluorescent intravacuolar structures) and methylene blue (dead cells turning blue) assays as well as the presence of cellular debris. The screening conducted in this study was carried out by treating a whole organism with small molecules. Analysis of the observed effects provided information on the connection between the molecular structure and the ability to perturb the growth rate of treated cells, regardless of the target receptor of each molecule. The class of molecules having the general structure III, as shown in Table 1 (106, 107, 108, 110, 111, 112, 113, and 114) induced a growth rate decrease only if the molecule had a secondary amine as the R4 group. The molecules containing a leucine isostere as the R1 group (119, 120, 123, and 124) did not induce effects in any case. Phenotypic effects of compounds having an ethyl group at R4, (020, 024, 025, 042, 049, 057, 072, 075, 076, 089, and 090) suggested that 1) the presence of a protic donor group (resulting in R4 hydroxyethyl residue), which in some cases was connected to higher cell growth rate, and 2) the substitution of the methyl group with CF3 at the second position of the ethylamine was associated with a higher growth decrease, not attributable to the steric hindrance of fluorine (similar to hydrogen) but to the ability to form polar interactions. The ability of molecules having the general structure I, as shown in Table 1 (056, 057, 058, 059, 060, 061, 066, 067, 068, 069, 070, and 071), to induce a biological effect was associated with the steric hindrance of the R4 group; the lower the steric hindrance, the higher the biological effect, decreasing up to 50% in the presence of a bulkier group. On the contrary, the opposite correlation was evident in molecules possessing the scaffold II, as shown in Table 1 (001, 002, 004, 005, 008, 009, 010, 011, 012, 013, 014, 015, 016, and 018), thus suggesting two different targets for the two compound classes. By comparing 089 with other molecules of the library that differed in some functional groups, a drastic decrease in the ability to induce a biological effect was seen to be due to the lack of the carbonyl group embedded in the bicycle, the benzhydryl group substitution with a benzyl group, and the lipophilic R4 chain elongation. The MIC of 089 on W303 and BY4742 wild-type strains was determined (supplemental Fig. 1). Both strains were characterized by a MIC of 1 mm, but the EC50 values, which were 0.25 mm for W303 strain and 0.38 mm for BY4742 strain, were more interesting. The survival rate of the strains W303, BY4742, BY4742Δerg6, BY4742Δsnq2, and BY4742Δpdr3 after a 2- and 4-h treatment with different concentrations of 089 (1, 0.5, 0.2, and 0.1 mm and control) was evaluated. The results of this assay (Fig. 2) showed that at higher concentrations, the molecule induced steady effects in each strain even at the early time points. Lower concentrations (up to 0.1 mm in the 2-h treatments and up to 0.2 mm in the 4-h treatments) induced a survival percentage decrease only for W303, thus confirming the MIC results. Each strain showed almost the same higher survival decrease at 0.5 mm concentration of 089 (nearly 30% in the 2-h treatment, around 10% in the 4-h treatment). By contrast, BY4742 revealed itself to be the most resistant to the treatment, as previously observed. The 4-h exposure to 089 with a concentration of 1 mm triggered the same effects on all of the tested strains, including BY4742. The concentration of 089 inhibiting the growth of deletion mutant strains induced a minor effect on BY4742, probably due to different respiratory ability. Because the two wild-type tested strains, BY4742 and W303, had a different genetic background, we further investigated the role of HAP1 using FY2609 (HAP1) and FY2607 (hap1T) as two additional strains having similar alterations of HAP1 in the same genetic background. The FY strains (36.Hickman M.J. Winston F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 7414-7424Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) have a similar pedigree and genetic background as the BY series strains, all being derivatives of S288c; therefore, the results"
https://openalex.org/W2017088492,"In vertebrates, Ran-Binding Protein in the Microtubule Organizing Center (RanBPM) appears to function as a scaffolding protein in a variety of signal transduction pathways. In Drosophila, RanBPM is implicated in the regulation of germ line stem cell (GSC) niche organization in the ovary. Here, we addressed the role of RanBPM in nervous system function in the context of Drosophila larval behavior.We report that in Drosophila, RanBPM is required for larval feeding, light-induced changes in locomotion, and viability. RanBPM is highly expressed in the Kenyon cells of the larval mushroom body (MB), a structure well studied for its role in associative learning in Drosophila and other insects. RanBPM mutants do not display major disruption in nervous system morphology besides reduced proliferation. Expression of the RanBPM gene in the Kenyon cells is sufficient to rescue all behavioral phenotypes. Through genetic epistasis experiments, we demonstrate that RanBPM participates with the Drosophila orthologue of the Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP) in the development of neuromuscular junction (NMJ).We demonstrate that the RanBPM gene functions in the MB neurons for larval behavior. Our results suggest a role for this gene in an FMRP-dependent process. Taken together our findings point to a novel role for the MB in larval behavior."
https://openalex.org/W1971325678,"Post-translational modifications by ubiquitin-like proteins are among the most important mechanisms for regulating a wide variety of cellular functions. In these modifications an E1 enzyme activates each ubiquitin-like protein (Ubl) by adenylation of the Ubl C-terminal COOH group and then forms a thioester bond with the adenylated C-terminal COOH group of the Ubl. Previous x-ray crystallography studies revealed a conserved zinc motif in the SUMO and NEDD8 E1; however, the function of this Zn(2+) motif is unclear. In this study, using quantitative ATP:PPi isotope exchange assays in combination with site-directed mutagenesis, we show that the conserved Zn(2+) motif in the SUMO E1 is important for SUMO adenylation and is critical for the E1 pseudo-ordered substrate binding mechanism. Furthermore, Zn(2+) motif mutants showed significantly reduced k(cat) values for ATP:PPi isotope exchange assays, suggesting that the Zn(2+) motif is important in binding and preventing SUMO adenylate from dissociating from E1 before formation of the thioester conjugate. Because the Zn(2+) motif is located in a cross-over loop that is known to have conformational flexibility, the results described here suggest that this cross-over loop interacts with Ubl in the multistep, dynamic process of Ubl activation by E1s."

Transgenic rescue experiments demonstrated that neuronal expression of WSP-1 rescued this phenotype and that it required a functional WSP-1 Cdc42/Rac interactive binding domain. WSP-1-GFP fusion protein was found localized presynaptically, immediately adjacent to the synaptic protein RAB-3. Strong genetic interactions with wsp-1 and other genes involved in different stages of synaptic transmission were observed as the wsp-1(gm324) mutation suppresses the aldicarb resistance seen in unc-13(e51), unc-11(e47), and snt-1 (md290) mutants.

https://openalex.org/W2122590618,"Infection with adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector with liver tropism leads to persistent expression of foreign antigens in the mouse liver, with no significant liver inflammation or pathology. This provides a model to investigate antigen persistence in the liver and strategies to modulate host immunity to reduce or clear the foreign antigen expressed from AAV vector in the liver.We showed that expressing LIGHT with an adenovirus vector (Ad) in mice with established AAV in the liver led to clearance of the AAV. Ad-LIGHT enhanced CD8 effector T cells in the liver, correlated with liver inflammation. LTbetaR-Ig proteins blocked Ad-LIGHT in clearing AAV. Interestingly, in LTbetaR-null mice, Ad-LIGHT still cleared AAV but caused no significant liver inflammation.Our data suggest that LIGHT interaction with the LTbetaR plays a critical role in liver inflammation but is not required for LIGHT-mediated AAV clearance. These findings will shed light on developing novel immuno-therapeutics in treating people chronically infected with hepato-tropic viruses."
