When it is required to remove nucleic acids, the protein is treated with 5 per cent trichloroacetic acid at 90° for 15 min. before the hot alcohol wash."

These species, Stomias boa (Risso), Flagellostomias sp., Argyropelecus olfersii (Cuvier) and Myctophum punctatum Rafinesque, are often caught around 500 m.1, a depth close to that at which the human eye ceases to see the light of day2."

https://openalex.org/W2023325917,"IN the course of our investigations on the hæmoglobins in the blood of various animal species by the agar electrophoresis technique1,2, it was found that the blood of buffalo contained two distinct hæmoglobins. Blood hæmolysates were prepared by the method of Drabkin3 without using aluminium chloride. The hæmolysate was applied on the surface of the agar gel (0.5 per cent) containing 0.05 ionic strength barbital buffer of pH. 8.6. Electrophoresis was carried out according to the procedure described before4. After electrophoresis (200 V., 6m.amp., 6 hr.) the hæoglobin bands could be observed visually. Under ultra-violet light using Wood's filter the bands could be seen more clearly. The hæmoglobin bands could be stained with amido black 10B after drying the agar plate and the concentrations of the components could be determined densitometrically. The region occupied by the hæmoglobins shows positive reaction with benzidine reagent. Rat blood hæmolysates showed the presence of two minor components of proteins in addition to the major component of hæmoglobin."

https://openalex.org/W1979046401,"WE recently discovered accidentally that controlled autolysis of certain Gram-positive bacteria in concentrated sucrose solutions adjusted to a critical ionic strength at pH 6 results in the release of the internal protoplasts from the mechanical protection of the cell-wall1,2. These ‘protoplasts’ are stable in suspension media of osmotic pressure above 20 atm., but lyse in more dilute media. The observations of Alfred Fischer3 and Garbowski4 on plasmoptysis of certain Gram-negative bacteria in media of low salinity suggested that autolytic release of stable protoplasts might also be possible in these organisms. We have therefore made a preliminary investigation of the conditions required to release the protoplasts of Bacterium coli (American strain B)."

https://openalex.org/W2079891342,"IN the course of analysing the frequency of chromosomal inversions in 292 adult females of Drosophila willistoni, we have recorded for the first time evidence of crossing-over between two non-overlapping inversions in the same chromosome arm of this species. These findings are of some general interest since, as Dobzhansky and Epling1 have said: “The biological function of inversions in natural populations of Drosophila and their principal role in the evolution of these insects might be conceived to be the suppression of crossing over between gene complexes which have reached an adaptive equilibrium. Crossing over would destroy these complexes and would result in gene combinations of different adaptive values, but would be prevented by the binding effect of the inversions”."

https://openalex.org/W1973738657,"WHEN a solution of 7-hydroxypteridine1 was spotted on a sheet of Whatman No. 1 filter paper, irradiated with ultra-violet light (principally 254 mµ) for 5 min., and developed (by ascending chromatography) in various solvents, two spots appeared. One of these was identical with the starting material (unirradiated material was used as a control on the same piece of paper), and the other proved to be 5 : 6-dihydro-7-hydroxypteridine1. This reaction did not take place in aqueous solution (although 2 : 6-di-hydroxypteridine2 undergoes photochemical change in water), but it did if allyl-thiourea was present as a hydrogen donor (unirradiated controls were not reduced). 2- and 4-hydroxypteridine were found also to be photo-altered on paper; but the products have not yet been identified."

https://openalex.org/W2065483393,"THERE are several reports concerning the biochemical changes accompanying experimental liver damage by administration of carbon tetrachloride and other steatogenic poisons. However, the fundamental metabolic deviation causing fatty degeneration has not been well understood. Patwardhan et al.1 have demonstrated that marked changes in the distribution and quantity of several constituents of the liver cells occur before structural damage to the organ. In the present communication, it is shown that a rapid rate of depletion of soluble sulphydryl compounds is among the major derangements in liver injury by carbon tetrachloride. The possibility has been indicated that the protection afforded by prior administration of vitamin B12 may be due to its known influence on sulphydryl metabolism2."

https://openalex.org/W1996335665,"IN Britain Palaemonetes varians, variety microgenitor, commonly inhabits only saline water around the coastline and has never been recorded in fresh water. The prawn is, however, very abundant in water of extremely low salinity in the Cardiff area, where it occurs in the drainage ditches of farm-land adjacent to an area of salt-marsh1. In the summer months both the salt-marsh and the farm-land waterways swarm with larval prawns. The P. varians of these two regions are morphologically identical but differ physiologically, those from the latter habitat being in some way better suited for life in a low salinity environment. When in water of low salinity (such as that contained in the ditches traversing the cultivated area) they show a much smaller expenditure of metabolic energy (as measured by the respiratory rate) than those from the neighbouring, highly saline marsh pools2."
