Hypoxia increases mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation at Complex III, which causes accumulation of HIF-1α protein responsible for initiating expression of a luciferase reporter construct under the control of a hypoxic response element. This response is lost in cells depleted of mitochondrial DNA (ρ0 cells). Overexpression of catalase abolishes hypoxic response element-luciferase expression during hypoxia. Exogenous H2O2 stabilizes HIF-1α protein during normoxia and activates luciferase expression in wild-type and ρ0 cells. Isolated mitochondria increase ROS generation during hypoxia, as does the bacterium Paracoccus denitrificans. These findings reveal that mitochondria-derived ROS are both required and sufficient to initiate HIF-1α stabilization during hypoxia.

Gene products that augment O2 supply at the tissue level include erythropoietin (Epo)1 which increases the proliferation of erythrocytes, tyrosine hydroxylase which is necessary for the synthesis of the neurotransmitter dopamine in the carotid bodies, and the angiogenic factor VEGF which stimulates growth of new capillaries (1Semenza G.L.

At the cellular level, gene products that enhance survival during hypoxia include the glycolytic enzymes and the glucose transporters Glut1 and Glut3 (4Bunn H.F. Poyton R.O. Physiol.

The significance of HIF-1 in transcriptional regulation was recently demonstrated by the marked decrease in mRNA expression of VEGF and glycolytic enzymes seen during hypoxia in HIF-1α- or ARNT-deficient murine embryonic stem cells (10Iyer N.V. Kotch L.E. Agani F. Leung S.W. Laughner E. Wenger R.H. Gassmann M. Gearhart J.D. Lawler A.M., Yu, A.Y. Semenza G.L.

Schmidt J.V. Baunoch D. Bradfield C.A. Simon M.C. Nature. 1997; 386: 403-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which HIF-1 activation is initiated during hypoxia remains unclear. Both HIF-1α and ARNT mRNAs are constitutively expressed, indicating that functional activity of the HIF-1α·ARNT complex is regulated by post-transcriptional events. ARNT levels are not significantly affected by [O2], whereas HIF-1α protein is rapidly degraded under normoxic conditions by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (13Salceda S. Caro J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22642-22647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1381) Google Scholar, 14Kallio P.J. Pongratz I. Gradin K. McGuire J. Poellinger L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5667-5672Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Hypoxia enhances HIF-1α protein levels by inhibiting its degradation, thereby allowing it to accumulate, to dimerize with ARNT, and to bind to the hypoxia-responsive element (HRE) in the promoter or enhancer regions of various genes. Thus, the functional HIF-1α·ARNT complex is primarily regulated by the abundance of the HIF-1α subunit. Although much has been learned about the role of HIF-1 in controlling the expression of hypoxia-responsive genes, the underlying mechanism by which cells detect the decrease in [O2] and initiate the stabilization of HIF-1α is not known. Presently, four diverse O2-sensing mechanisms have been proposed to mediate the transcriptional response to hypoxia (15Semenza G.L. Cell. 1999; 98: 281-284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Two of these models postulate the involvement of an iron-containing unit in the form of either a heme group or an iron/sulfur cluster, which undergoes a change in activity during hypoxia that triggers the transcriptional response. These models are supported by the observation that cobaltous ions, or alternatively the iron chelator desferrioxamine (DFO), stabilize HIF-1α under normoxic conditions (16Wang G.L. Semenza G.L. Blood. 1993; 82: 3610-3615Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, no specific proteins with this role have been identified in mammalian systems. Two other models involve the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by a flavoprotein-containing NAD(P)H oxidase or by mitochondria. The NAD(P)H oxidase theory postulates that a decrease in ROS production triggers the transcriptional response to hypoxia (17Fandrey J. Frede S. Jelkman W. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 507-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 18Ehleben W. Bolling B. Merten E. Porwol T. Strohmaier A.R. Acker H. Respir. Physiol. 1998; 114: 25-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In support of that model, exogenous H2O2 was found to inhibit subsequent hypoxic stabilization of HIF-1α (19Huang L.E. Arany Z. Livingston D.M. Bunn H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32253-32259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). However, diphenylene iodonium (DPI), a specific flavoprotein inhibitor that blocks ROS generation by NAD(P)H oxidase, abolishes the hypoxic induction of HIF-1-dependent genes (20Gleadle J.M. Ebert B.L. Ratcliffe P.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 92-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), whereas the model would predict that DPI should activate the response during normoxia. We previously proposed that hypoxia partially inhibits mitochondrial electron transport, producing redox changes in the electron carriers that increase the generation of ROS. These oxidants then enter the cytosol and function as second messengers in the signaling pathway leading to stabilization of HIF-1α (21Chandel N.S. Maltepe E. Goldwasser E. Mathieu C.E. Simon M.C. Schumacker P.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11715-11720Crossref PubMed Scopus (1559) Google Scholar). In support of this model, hypoxia failed to increase ROS production or the expression of EPO, VEGF, and glycolytic enzymes in ρ0 cells, which lack mitochondrial DNA and electron transport activity. Also, the response to hypoxia was abolished by the DPI, which abrogates mitochondrial ROS generation by inhibiting electron transport at the flavin site in mitochondrial Complex I (22Majander A. Finel M. Wikstroem M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21037-21042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our previous study tested whether ROS are required for the DNA binding of HIF-1 and the subsequent mRNA expression of Epo, VEGF, and glycolytic enzymes during hypoxia. However, protein levels of HIF-1α were not measured, so that study did not reveal whether mitochondrial ROS were required to trigger stabilization of HIF-1α during hypoxia. Moreover, although ROS were found to be necessary for the transcriptional response to hypoxia, it was not clear whether ROS by themselves were sufficient to initiate HIF-1α stabilization. Accordingly, the present study tested the following: (a) whether mitochondrial ROS are required for HIF-1α stabilization during hypoxia, cobalt treatment, or DFO; (b) whether cytosolic ROS are sufficient to trigger HIF-1α stabilization; and (c) whether mitochondrial cytochrome coxidase serves as the O2 sensor responsible for the redox changes underlying the increase in ROS generation during hypoxia. Human hepatoma 3B (Hep3B) cells and the human kidney 293 cells were cultured in α-minimum essential medium and Dulbecco's modified essential medium, respectively, to subconfluent conditions. Rat hepatocytes were isolated as described previously (23Schumacker P.T. Chandel N. Agusti A.G.N. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: L395-L402PubMed Google Scholar) and maintained in Dulbecco's modified essential medium. Media were supplemented with penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. The ρ0-293 and ρ0-Hep3B cells were generated by incubating wild-type cells in medium containing ethidium bromide (25 ng/ml), sodium pyruvate (1 mm), and uridine (50 μg/ml) (24King M.P. Attardi G. Science. 1989; 246: 500-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (1431) Google Scholar). Hypoxic conditions were achieved as described previously (21Chandel N.S. Maltepe E. Goldwasser E. Mathieu C.E. Simon M.C. Schumacker P.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11715-11720Crossref PubMed Scopus (1559) Google Scholar). Intracellular ROS generation was assessed using 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (Molecular Probes). ROS in the cells cause oxidation of DCFH, yielding the fluorescent product 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein (DCF). Cells were plated on Petri dishes and incubated with DCFH-DA (10 μm) under various conditions. The media were then removed;, cells were lysed and centrifuged to remove debris, and the fluorescence in the supernatant was measured using a spectrofluorometer (excitation, 500 nm; emission, 530 nm). Data were normalized to values obtained from normoxic, untreated controls. Nuclear extracts were prepared by lysing cells in a hypotonic solution (KCl (10 mm), HEPES (10 mm), protease mixture inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm), freshly added, pH 7.8) for 30 min. The disrupted cells were then centrifuged at 14,000 rpm, and the pellet was resuspended in a solution containing KCl (400 mm), HEPES (20 mm), glycerol (25%, v/v), EDTA (0.2 mm), and MgCl2 (1.5 mm) at pH 7.8 in order to lyse the nuclear membrane. The suspension was then centrifuged, and the proteins in the supernatant were quantified by Bradford reagent (Sigma). Nuclear protein extract (30 μg) was mixed with equal volume of electrophoresis buffer (1.0 ml of glycerol, 0.5 ml of β-mercaptoethanol, 3.0 ml of 10% SDS, 1.25 ml of Tris-HCl (1.0m), pH 6.7, and 1–2 mg of bromphenol blue). After heating, the protein was resolved on an SDS-7.5% polyacrylamide gel and transferred to hybond ECL nitrocellulose paper (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After transfer, the gel was stained with Ponceau stain to verify uniform loading and transfer. Membranes were blocked with 5% milk in TBS-T (Tris-HCl (10 mm), NaCl (150 mm), Tween 20 (0.1%), pH 8.0) overnight and subsequently incubated with the HIF-1α antibody (Novus Biological Sciences) for 3 h at room temperature. The membrane was washed with TBS-T three times and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Subsequently, the membrane was washed three times with TBS-T and analyzed by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Transfections of 293 and ρ0-293 cells were carried out on cells plated on 35-mm Petri dishes at 60–80% confluence using TransIT-LT1 (Panvera) according to the manufacturer's protocol. A typical transfection was performed by using 0.5 μg of the luciferase reporter driven by a trimer of murine Epo 3′ enhancer and the Glut-1 promoter (pEpo3′Glut1-Luc) and 0.5 μg of the pSV-β-galactosidase (Promega) as a control vector for monitoring transfection efficiencies. In some experiments, 0.5 μg of empty vector (pRc/CMV2) or human catalase gene driven by SV40 enhancer-promoter (pZeoSV-CAT) was co-transfected with the luciferase and β-galactosidase. The DNA/LipofectAMINE mixture was incubated with plated cells for 24 h. Subsequently, the media were replaced and cells exposed to various conditions. Cell lysis was performed using the reporter gene lysis buffer (Promega). Replicate transfection experiments were performed with four independent DNA preparations. Luciferase assays were performed using Luciferase Assay System (Promega). β-Galactosidase assays were performed using the luminescent β-galactosidase genetic reporter system II (CLONTECH). The concentration of H2O2 or t-butyl hydroperoxide was assessed in media of Hep3B cells using the xylenol orange assay (25Jiang Z.Y. Woollard A.C. Wolff S.P. FEBS Lett. 1990; 268: 69-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated in serum-free α-medium without phenol red (Life Technologies, Inc.) with H2O2 (25 or 40 μm) for 30 min with samples (900 μl) taken every 5 min (Fig. 4 A), or witht-butyl hydroperoxide (25 or 40 μm) for 120 min with samples (900 μl) taken every 30 min (Fig. 4 B). The aliquots of media were incubated at 25 °C for 45 min with 100 μl of a 10× xylenol orange stock solution (xylenol orange (10 μm), Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2·6H2O (2.5 μm), H2SO4 (25 mm), (Sigma)) after which the absorbance was read at 590 nm (25Jiang Z.Y. Woollard A.C. Wolff S.P. FEBS Lett. 1990; 268: 69-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). The concentration of H2O2 ort-butyl hydroperoxide was determined from a standard curve (0, 25, and 40 μm). Fresh stock solutions of H2O2 (10 mm) and t-butyl hydroperoxide were prepared immediately prior to each trial. Rat liver mitochondria were isolated by differential centrifugation from the livers of adult rats. The liver homogenate was prepared using a Dounce homogenizer at 4 °C in buffer containing mannitol (200 mm), sucrose (70 mm), HEPES (10 mm), and EGTA (1.0 mm), at pH 7.2. The homogenate was spun for 10 min at 750 × g, and the supernatant was spun at 10,000 × g to recover the mitochondrial fraction. Mitochondria were suspended in sucrose buffer (sucrose (250 mm), HEPES (20 mm), KCl (5 mm), KH2PO4 (3 mm), MgCl2(1.5 mm), EGTA (1 mm), pH 7.2) at a protein concentration of 0.1 mg/ml at 25 °C and were incubated with succinate (5 mm), antimycin (1 μg/ml), rotenone (1 μg/ml), and DCFH-DA (10 μm) for 30 min in spinner flasks. Subsequently, a mitochondrial aliquot (100 μl) was lysed with 1 ml of H2O, and the sample fluorescence was measured using a spectrofluorometer. The head space of the spinner flasks was gassed with various O2 concentrations as described previously (26Chandel N. Budinger G.R.S. Kemp R.A. Schumacker P.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: L918-L925Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Wild-typeP. denitrificans (ATCC, Rockville MD) were grown aerobically with succinate as the carbon source as described previously (49Ludwig B. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 126: 153-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Bacteria were harvested in mid-logarithmic growth phase and washed twice with KH2PO4 (50 mm). Cells were suspended in Krebs-Henseleit buffer (NaCl (120 mm), HEPES (20 mm), CaCl2 (1 mm), glucose (10 mm), KCl (2.5 mm), MgSO4 (1 mm) and KH2PO4(1 mm), pH 7.4) at 25 °C. Cells were incubated for 60 min with DCFH-DA (10 μm) in spinner flasks gassed with various O2 concentrations. Subsequently, fluorescence was measured from an aliquot of media. Intracellular ROS generation was examined in human Hep3B cells in response to hypoxia, cobalt chloride (CoCl2), or DFO using 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein (DCFH) (27Bass D.A. Parce J.W. Dechatelet L.R. Szejda P. Seeds M.C. Thomas M. J. Immunol. 1983; 130: 1910-1917PubMed Google Scholar). This probe enters the cells and can be oxidized in the presence of ROS, generating the fluorescent compound, DCF. Previous studies have indicated that DCFH oxidation can be mediated by H2O2 but not by superoxide (28Carter W.O. Narayanan P.K. Robinson J.P. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1994; 55: 253-258Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hep3B cells incubated with DCFH for 6 h during hypoxia (1.5% O2) or with CoCl2 (100 μm) during normoxia demonstrated an increase in DCF fluorescence (Fig.1, A and B). By contrast, DFO (100 μm) did not elicit an increase in DCF fluorescence over the same period (Fig. 1 C). The increase in DCF fluorescence induced by hypoxia or CoCl2 was abolished by the thiol reductant pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC, 20 μm) (Fig. 1, A and B). PDTC can enhance the scavenging of H2O2 by maintaining cellular stores of reduced glutathione (GSH). ROS can be generated at a number of intracellular sites, including NAD(P)H oxidases and at mitochondrial Complex III. DPI inhibits electron transport in flavin-containing systems including NAD(P)H oxidase and mitochondrial Complex I. DPI (10 μm) attenuated the increase in DCF fluorescence in response to hypoxia but not to CoCl2 (Fig.1, A and B). Mitochondrial ROS generation at Complex III can be attenuated by inhibiting electron flux at more upstream sites. Rotenone (1 μg/ml), an inhibitor of electron transport at Complex I, abolished the increase in DCF fluorescence during hypoxia but not during CoCl2 incubation (Fig. 1,A and B). By contrast, antimycin A (1 μg/ml), an inhibitor of the downstream end of Complex III, did not alter the increase in DCF fluorescence. Superoxide generated within mitochondria would require anion channels to enter the cytosol, where it would be converted to H2O2 by cytosolic superoxide dismutase (29Takahashi M.A. Asada K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1983; 226: 558-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). The inhibitor of mitochondrial anion channels 4,4′-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2′-disulfonate (DIDS) should therefore suppress the egress of superoxide from the mitochondria (30Beavis A.D. Davatol-Hag H. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1996; 28: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Indeed, DIDS (150 μm) abolished the increase in DCF fluorescence during hypoxia (Fig. 1 A). By contrast, DIDS failed to attenuate the CoCl2-stimulated increase in the DCF signal (Fig. 1 B). These results support the conclusion that hypoxia stimulates mitochondrial ROS generation, that CoCl2stimulates ROS generation by a non-mitochondrial mechanism, and that desferrioxamine does not affect ROS production. Hep3B cells were exposed to hypoxia, CoCl2, or DFO in the presence of PDTC to examine whether increases in ROS are required for the HIF-1α stabilization. PDTC abolished the hypoxia- and CoCl2-induced stabilization of HIF-1α but had no effect on DFO-induced stabilization of HIF-1α protein (Fig. 2 A). Furthermore, human epithelial kidney 293 cells transiently co-transfected with a luciferase reporter construct driven by the HRE and a construct containing catalase (31Bai J. Rodriguez A.M. Melendez J.A. Cederbaum A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26217-26224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) were exposed to hypoxia, CoCl2, or DFO. Catalase expression significantly attenuated the expression of luciferase in response to hypoxia or CoCl2, whereas the response to DFO was unaffected (Fig.2 B). HIF-1α protein accumulation and HRE-luciferase expression were examined in ρ0-Hep3B cells and ρ0-293 cells, respectively, to determine whether mitochondria function as the source of ROS required for activation of HIF-1 during hypoxia. The ρ0-Hep3B cells failed to accumulate HIF-1α protein during hypoxia (Fig. 2 C). By contrast, CoCl2 and DFO still stabilized HIF-1α protein in ρ0-Hep3B cells (Fig. 2 C). Hypoxia-induced HRE-luciferase expression was not detected in ρ0-293 cells, but these cells still demonstrated HRE-luciferase expression in response to CoCl2 or DFO (Fig. 2 D). The CoCl2-induced increase in HRE-luciferase expression in ρ0-293 cells was abolished in cells co-transfected to overexpress catalase (Fig. 2 D). To clarify further the role of mitochondria in the hypoxic response, wild-type Hep3B cells were exposed to hypoxia, CoCl2, or DFO in the presence of rotenone (1 μg/ml), DPI (10 μm), DIDS (150 μm), or antimycin A (1 μg/ml). Rotenone, DPI, and DIDS all abolished the accumulation of HIF-1α during hypoxia but not during CoCl2 or DFO treatment (Fig.3, A–C). Antimycin A augments ROS generation at Complex III (32Boveris A. Oshino N. Chance B. Biochem. J. 1972; 128: 617-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (1203) Google Scholar, 33Turrens J.F. Alexandre A. Lehninger A.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 237: 408-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar), which should mimic the response to hypoxia and lead to stabilization of HIF-1α. Yet antimycin A failed to stabilize HIF-1α during normoxia and did not abrogate the induction of HIF-1α during hypoxia, CoCl2, or DFO (Fig.3 D). We had previously reported that the ROS response to antimycin A during normoxia was smaller than the response to hypoxia in Hep3B cells (21Chandel N.S. Maltepe E. Goldwasser E. Mathieu C.E. Simon M.C. Schumacker P.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11715-11720Crossref PubMed Scopus (1559) Google Scholar), which suggests that ROS signaling by antimycin A may have been inadequate. We therefore tested whether stabilization of HIF-1α during normoxic antimycin A treatment might be amplified in cells whose ability to degrade H2O2 is impaired. Hep3B cells were treated for 16 h with buthionine-l-sulfoximine (100 μm) to deplete glutathione stores in an attempt to amplify the response to an oxidizing stimulus evoked by antimycin A (34Nakamura K. Wang W. Kang U.J. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 1850-1858Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Glutathione-depleted Hep3B cells demonstrated HIF-1α accumulation under normoxia in the presence of antimycin A (Fig. 3 E). Rotenone, DPI, and DIDS all abolished this response, confirming the specificity of mitochondrial involvement (Fig. 3 E). These results support the hypothesis that mitochondrial ROS are required and sufficient for stabilization of HIF-1α during hypoxia and that non-mitochondrial ROS generation is involved in the response to CoCl2. DFO responses require neither the mitochondria nor ROS, suggesting that this compound acts at a more distal step in the signaling cascade.Figure 3A, HIF-1α protein levels in Hep3B cells exposed to 21% O2, 1.5% O2, CoCl2 (100 μm), or DFO (100 μm) for 4 h with or without rotenone (ROT., 1 μg/ml).B, HIF-1α protein levels in Hep3B cells exposed to 21% O2, 1.5% O2, CoCl2 (100 μm), or DFO (100 μm) for 4 h with or without DPI (10 μm).

If so, then exogenous administration of peroxide should stabilize HIF-1α during normoxia. Accordingly, boluses of H2O2 or t-butyl hydroperoxide, a more stable analogue of H2O2, were added to culture media of normoxic Hep3B cells. Serum-free media was used because catalase in serum would otherwise rapidly degrade any added peroxide. In the absence of serum, a bolus of H2O2 added to achieve an initial concentration of 25 or 40 μm was progressively degraded over 30 min (Fig. 4 A). t-Butyl hydroperoxide (25 or 40 μm) produced a more sustained elevation, but it, too, was largely degraded within 1 h (Fig.4 B). To produce a more sustained elevation in H2O2 levels, Hep3B cells were treated with repeated boluses of H2O2 or t-butyl hydroperoxide (25 μm or 40 μm) every 15 min for 2 h. This regimen was sufficient to trigger the stabilization of HIF-1α protein levels (Fig. 4 C). Hydrogen peroxide failed to stabilize HIF-1α when bolus concentrations were lowered to 10 μm (data not shown). In 293 cells transfected with the HRE-luciferase expression vector, bolus additions of H2O2 (40 μmH2O2 every 15 min for 10 h) caused expression of luciferase compared with normoxic controls (Fig.4 D). By contrast, 293 cells co-transfected with the HRE-luciferase and with catalase demonstrated an attenuated expression in response to a similar regimen of H2O2administration (Fig. 4 D). To determine whether H2O2 acts upstream or downstream of mitochondria, HRE-luciferase expression was examined in ρ0-293 cells exposed to a similar regimen of H2O2 (40 μm). These ρ0-293 cells increased HRE-luciferase expression, indicating that peroxide must act downstream from the mitochondria (Fig. 4 D). Protein phosphorylation participates in the signaling cascade mediating the accumulation of HIF-1α as well as in the transactivation by the HIF-1 complex in response to hypoxia (35Richard D.E.

The phosphatase inhibitor calyculin A (5 nm) abolished HIF-1α stabilization in response to hypoxia, CoCl2, or DFO in Hep3B cells (Fig.5 A). Wortmannin (0.1–1.0 μm), an inhibitor of PI-3 kinase, attenuated HIF-1α accumulation in response to hypoxia, CoCl2, or DFO (Fig.5 B). Wortmannin (500 nm) also attenuated the expression of HRE-luciferase in 293 cells (Fig. 5 C). In the presence of calyculin A or wortmannin, the proteasome inhibitorN-carbobenzoxyl-l-leucinyl-l-leucinyl-l-norvalinal (10 μm) was still able to stabilize HIF-1α (Fig.5 D). These observations reveal the following: (a) the inhibited stabilization of HIF-1α in the presence of these compounds did not reflect a nonspecific toxic effect, and (b) phosphatases and PI-3 kinases must act upstream of the proteolytic degradation machinery. To demonstrate that phosphatases and PI-3 kinases act downstream of H2O2, Hep3B cells were treated with boluses of H2O2 (40 μm every 15 min for 2 h) in the presence of calyculin A or wortmannin. Calyculin A and wortmannin independently abolished the stabilization of HIF-1α protein effected by H2O2 (Fig. 5 E). Thus, phosphatases and PI-3 kinases are required for the stabilization of HIF-1α and act at steps downstream of ROS. To determine whether the inhibition of the HIF-1α protein response to hypoxia, CoCl2, or DFO by wortmannin was specific to that compound, additional studies were carried out using the PI-3 kinase inhibitor LY 294002. At a concentration of 20 μm, this compound also inhibited the stabilization of HIF-1α in response to hypoxia, CoCl2, or DFO (Fig. 5 F). These results support the conclusion that PI-3 kinase participates in the signaling regulating HIF-1α stabilization by acting downstream from the activation by hypoxia, CoCl2, and DFO. We previously found that cytochromec oxidase undergoes a decrease inV max during hypoxia (39Chandel N.S. Budinger G.R.S. Schumacker P.T. J. Biol.

When a liquid droplet several millimeters in diameter was placed on a substrate surface modified with a calix[4]resorcinarene derivative having photochromic azobenzene units, asymmetrical photoirradiation caused a gradient in surface free energy due to the photoisomerization of surface azobenzenes, leading to the directional motion of the droplet. The direction and velocity of the motion were tunable by varying the direction and steepness of the gradient in light intensity. The light-driven motion of a fluid substance in a surface-modified glass tube suggests potential applicability to microscale chemical process systems."

Four early target genes of CO were identified using a steroid-inducible version of the protein. Two of these genes, SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CO 1 (SOC1) and FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT), are required for CO to promote flowering; the others are involved in proline or ethylene biosynthesis. The SOC1 and FT genes are also regulated by a second flowering-time pathway that acts independently of CO. Thus, early target genes of CO define common components of distinct flowering-time pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1932116449,"Recent data from this laboratory demonstrate that increasing adipocyte intracellular Ca(2+) results in a coordinated stimulation of lipogenesis and inhibition of lipolysis. We have also noted that increasing dietary calcium of obese patients for 1 year resulted in a 4.9 kg loss of body fat (P<0.01). Accordingly, we tested the possibility that calcitrophic hormones may act on adipocytes to increase Ca(2+) and lipid metabolism by measuring the effects of 1, 25-(OH)(2)-D in primary cultures of human adipocytes, and found significant, sustained increases in intracellular Ca(2+) and a corresponding marked inhibition of lipolysis (EC(50) approximately 50 pM; P<0.001), suggesting that dietary calcium could reduce adipocyte mass by suppressing 1,25-(OH)(2)-D. To test this hypothesis, we placed transgenic mice expressing the agouti gene specifically in adipocytes on a low (0.4%) Ca/high fat/high sucrose diet either unsupplemented or with 25 or 50% of the protein replaced by non-fat dry milk or supplemented to 1.2% Ca with CaCO(3) for 6 wk. Weight gain and fat pad mass were reduced by 26-39% by the three high calcium diets (P<0.001). The high calcium diets exerted a corresponding 51% inhibition of adipocyte fatty acid synthase expression and activity (P<0.002) and stimulation of lipolysis by 3. 4- to 5.2-fold (P<0.015). This concept of calcium modulation of adiposity was further evaluated epidemiologically in the NHANES III data set. After controlling for energy intake, relative risk of being in the highest quartile of body fat was set to 1.00 for the lowest quartile of Ca intake and was reduced to 0.75, 0.40, and 0.16 for the second, third, and fourth quartiles, respectively, of calcium intake for women (n=380;P<0.0009); a similar inverse relationship was also noted in men (n=7114; P<0.0006). Thus, increasing dietary calcium suppresses adipocyte intracellular Ca(2+) and thereby modulates energy metabolism and attenuates obesity risk."
https://openalex.org/W1966132803,"It is controversial whether the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is involved in the maintenance of items in working memory or in the selection of responses. We used event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging to study the performance of a spatial working memory task by humans. We distinguished the maintenance of spatial items from the selection of an item from memory to guide a response. Selection, but not maintenance, was associated with activation of prefrontal area 46 of the dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex. In contrast, maintenance was associated with activation of prefrontal area 8 and the intraparietal cortex. The results support a role for the dorsal prefrontal cortex in the selection of representations. This accounts for the fact that this area is activated both when subjects select between items on working memory tasks and when they freely select between movements on tasks of willed action."

Minichromosome maintenance (MCM) protein complexes have DNA helicase activity but have only been functionally implicated in initiating DNA replication. Using an improved method for constructing conditional degron mutants, we show that depletion of MCMs after initiation irreversibly blocks the progression of replication forks in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Like the Escherichia coli dnaB and SV40 T antigen helicases, therefore, the MCM complex is loaded at origins before initiation and is essential for elongation. Restricting MCM loading to the G(1) phase ensures that initiation and elongation occur just once per cell cycle."

The molecular mechanisms involved in mycobacterial entry are still poorly characterized. Here we report that cholesterol is essential for uptake of mycobacteria by macrophages. Cholesterol accumulated at the site of mycobacterial entry, and depleting plasma membrane cholesterol specifically inhibited mycobacterial uptake. Cholesterol also mediated the phagosomal association of TACO, a coat protein that prevents degradation of mycobacteria in lysosomes. Thus, by entering host cells at cholesterol-rich domains of the plasma membrane, mycobacteria may ensure their subsequent intracellular survival in TACO-coated phagosomes."

It is shown here that transformation of the hematopoietic cell lines Ba/F3, 32Dcl3, and MO7e with BCR/ABL results in an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) compared with quiescent, untransformed cells. The increase in ROS was directly due to BCR/ABL because it was blocked by the ABL-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor STI571. Oxidative stress through ROS is believed to have many biochemical effects, including the potential ability to inhibit protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPases). To understand the significance of increased production of ROS, a model system was established in which hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) was added to untransformed cells to mimic the increase in ROS induced constitutively by BCR/ABL. H2O2 substantially reduced total cellular PTPase activity to a degree approximately equivalent to that of pervanadate, a well known PTPase inhibitor.

The ABL tyrosine kinase in the BCR/ABL fusion protein is constitutively activated and its activity may increase over time as the disease progresses from the CML stable phase to blast crisis (1Sattler M. Salgia R. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1997; 8: 63-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Also, the kinase activity of BCR/ABL is regulated in vivo by cellular proteins that are thought to bind reversibly and inhibit autophosphorylation of the kinase (2Dai Z.H. Pendergast A.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2569-2582Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). We and others have recently shown that activated growth factor receptors increase the relative levels of intracellular ROS (3Sundaresan M., Yu, Z.X. Ferrans V.J. Irani K. Finkel T.

The biological effects of ROS vary widely in different cells and include modulation of signaling pathways by directly altering the activity of protein kinases and protein phosphatases (PTPases) (7Denu J.M. Tanner K.G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5633-5642Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar, 8Monteiro H.P. Stern A. Free. Radic. Biol.

Here, we demonstrate that BCR/ABL transformation of three hematopoietic cell lines is associated with increased intracellular levels of ROS. A model system was established to directly look for contributions of ROS to signaling in hematopoietic cells. Untransformed MO7e cells were treated with H2O2 to mimic the ROS increase described with BCR/ABL. Treatment of MO7e cells with H2O2 reduced the cellular PTPase activity and induced tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins, generating an increased pattern of cellular tyrosine phosphorylation remarkably similar to that of BCR/ABL itself. Interestingly, the tyrosine kinase activity of c-ABL was also increased by H2O2. The potential contribution of ROS to BCR/ABL signaling was investigated by adding antioxidants. Overall, the results are consistent with a model in which increased ROS amplify BCR/ABL signaling, possibly by inhibiting cellular PTPases. The human megakaryocytic cell line MO7e was grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 20% (v/v) fetal calf serum and 10 ng/ml granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor. The murine pre-B-cell line Ba/F3 and the murine myeloid cell line 32Dcl3 were grown in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum and 10% (v/v) WEHI-conditioned medium (as a source of interleukin-3). Cells transfected with a BCR/ABL cDNA (MO7/p210, BaF3/p210, and 32D/p210) were grown in medium without growth factors. In some experiments MO7e were deprived of growth factors for 18 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin or Ba/F3, and 32Dcl3 cells were deprived for the same period of time in RPMI 1640 medium containing 0.5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. Viability of cells was determined by trypan blue exclusion. The relative levels of intracellular ROS were analyzed as described using the redox-sensitive fluorochrome 2′,7′-dichloro-fluorescin-diacetate (Acros Organics, Pittsburgh, PA) (5Sattler M. Winkler T. Verma S. Byrne C.H. Shrikhande G. Salgia R. Griffin J.D. Blood. 1999; 93: 2928-2935Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In some experiments cells were pretreated with the ABL-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor STI571 (Novartis), the antioxidants pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC) andN-acetylcysteine (NAC), the oxidant H2O2, or the mitochondrial complex I inhibitor rotenone. For immunoprecipitation studies, MO7/p210 cells were left untreated or treated with pervanadate, PDTC, or NAC. Similarly, growth factor-starved MO7e cells were left untreated or stimulated with H2O2 or pervanadate. Cells were treated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium at a concentration of 5 × 106 cells/ml. Pervanadate solutions of different concentrations were generated by oxidizing vanadate solutions of the corresponding concentrations in water with 500 μmH2O2. Cells were washed in cold Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline, and cell lysates were prepared as described (14Sattler M. Durstin M.A. Frank D.A. Okuda K. Kaushansky K. Salgia R. Griffin J.D. Exp.

The PTPase activity was measured in whole cell lysates using the PTP assay system (New England BioLabs, Beverly, MA) according to the manufacturer's descriptions except that33P-phosphorylated myelin basic protein was concentrated in Centricon 10 tubes (Centricon, Beverly, MA), washed three times, and resuspended in 1 ml of buffer containing 25 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 0.1 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.01% (w/v) Brij 35. Cells were lysed in the absence of the PTPase inhibitor vanadate. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting using a chemiluminescence technique were performed as described (14Sattler M.

Polyclonal rabbit antisera against SHP-2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), c-CBL (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), SHC (Transduction Laboratories), and the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY) and the monoclonal antibody Ab-3 against ABL (Calbiochem) were used. Tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were detected using the monoclonal antibody 4G10 (kindly provided by Dr. B. Druker, Oregon Health Sciences University, Portland, OR) and tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were precipitated using the monoclonal antibody PY20 (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY). The activity of the BCR/ABL tyrosine kinase was measured in anti-ABL (K12, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) immunoprecipitates. MO7/p210 cells were left untreated or treated with PDTC and PDTC plus pervanadate. Similarly, MO7e cells were treated with H2O2 or pervanadate before the preparation of cellular lysate. The immunoprecipitates were washed in kinase buffer (25 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 75 mmNaCl) and incubated in the same buffer with 10 mmMnCl2 and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 30 min. GST or GST-CRKL (2.5 μg) bound to glutathione beads was used as an in vitro substrate for the ABL kinase. The pGEX vector containing full-length CRKL was kindly provided by Dr. J. Groffen (Children's Hospital, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA), and GST or the GST-CRKL fusion protein were prepared as described (15Sattler M. Salgia R. Shrikhande G. Verma S. Pisick E. Prasad K.V.S. Griffin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10248-10253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The immune complexes were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA), and analyzed by autoradiography using BioMax film (Eastman Kodak Co.). The number of viable cells was determined by trypan blue exclusion or annexin V staining (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). We and others have previously shown that activated growth factors increase the intracellular levels of ROS in hematopoietic cells (3Sundaresan M., Yu, Z.X. Ferrans V.J. Irani K. Finkel T. Science. 1995; 270: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (2305) Google Scholar, 4Ohba M. Shibanuma M. Kuroki T. Nose K. J.

Blood. 1999; 93: 2928-2935Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In Ba/F3, 32Dcl3, and MO7e cells transfected with BCR/ABL the relative ROS levels are also increased, compared with the untransformed cells that were deprived of growth factors. ROS were measured by the fluorochrome 2′,7′-dichloro-fluorescin-diacetate (Fig.1 A, upper panel). BCR/ABL-transfected and -untransfected cells have equal levels of autofluorescence (Fig. 1 A, bottom panel). To determine if the intracellular ROS levels require BCR/ABL kinase activity, BCR/ABL-transformed Ba/F3, 32Dcl3, and MO7e cells were treated for 24 h with the ABL-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor STI571 (formerly CGP57148B) (1 μm) (16Druker B.J. Tamura S. Buchdunger E. Ohno S. Segal G.M. Fanning S. Zimmermann J. Lydon N.B. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 561-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (3144) Google Scholar) or solvent alone. STI571 reduced the relative levels of intracellular ROS in all three cells lines compared with Me2SO-treated cells (Fig.1 B, top panel). Although experiments using the ABL kinase inhibitor STI571 support our observation of increased ROS levels in BCR/ABL-transformed cells, it is possible that this inhibitor may have additional unsuspected mechanisms of action. STI571 treatment did not alter the viability or the autofluorescence of the cells during the assay (Fig. 1 B, bottom panel). To demonstrate that the intracellular ROS levels can be manipulated by oxidizing or reducing agents, MO7/p210 cells were treated with the reducing agents PDTC (1 mm) for 3 h or NAC (4 mm) for 30 min and untransformed MO7e cells were treated with the oxidizing reagent H2O2 (1 mm) for 1 h. In each case, there was no loss of cell viability at the end of the experiment. PDTC and NAC reduced the ROS levels of MO7/p210 cells (Fig. 1 C, top left andmiddle panel), and H2O2 increased the intracellular levels of ROS in MO7e cells (Fig. 1 C,top panel) compared with untreated cells. PDTC, NAC, or H2O2 treatment did not alter the autofluorescence of the cells (Fig. 1 B, bottom panel). Because mitochondria are an important source of ROS in many cells, we examined the effects of rotenone, an inhibitor of the electron transfer from complex I to ubiquinone (17Chance B. Hollunger G. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 418-431Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ROS levels were measured 1 h after treatment of MO7e or MO7/p210 cells with 0.1 μmrotenone or with the solvent Me2SO. The relative ROS levels were reduced by an average of 22% in MO7/p210 cells but did not change significantly in MO7e cells (Fig. 1 D). These data suggest that increased levels of ROS in MO7/p210 cells, at least in part, depend on the mitochondrial respiratory chain. ROS such as H2O2 have been implicated in the regulation of PTPase activities (7Denu J.M. Tanner K.G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5633-5642Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). Because changes in the level of PTPase activity would be expected to have a significant impact on BCR/ABL transformation (18LaMontagne K.R. Hannon G. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14094-14099Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), we measured cellular PTPase activity in normal and BCR/ABL-transformed cells. Starved MO7e cells were left untreated or treated with H2O2 or pervanadate. The cellular PTPase activity was determined in whole cell lysates of MO7e cells using 33P-labeled myelin basic protein as a substrate and compared with cells transformed with the BCR/ABL oncogene (Fig.2). Both H2O2 and pervanadate significantly decreased the PTPase activity to 22% and 16% of untreated cells, respectively. BCR/ABL-transformed MO7e cells also showed a significant decrease in PTPase activity to 59% of that of untransformed cells (Fig. 2). In Ba/F3 cells, BCR/ABL transformation was associated with only an 18% decrease in PTPase activity (from 475 fmol of 33P release/mg protein/min in Ba/F3 cells to 391 fmol of 33P release/mg protein/min in BCR/ABL transformed Ba/F3 cells). Transformation by BCR/ABL requires constitutive activation of its ABL tyrosine kinase activity (16Druker B.J. Tamura S. Buchdunger E. Ohno S. Segal G.M. Fanning S. Zimmermann J. Lydon N.B. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 561-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (3144) Google Scholar, 19Lugo T.G. Pendergast A.M. Muller A.J. Witte O.N. Science. 1990; 247: 1079-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (1117) Google Scholar). Biological effects activated by BCR/ABL are therefore likely to be stimulated through tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins, which in turn are regulated by PTPases. Because BCR/ABL-transformed cells have increased levels of ROS and decreased PTPase activity, we measured the changes in cellular tyrosine phosphorylation induced by ROS, pervanadate, or BCR/ABL. Pervanadate (20 μm vanadate and 500 μm H2O2) increased tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins in growth factor-deprived MO7e cells (Fig. 3 A, right panel). At the concentration used to generate pervanadate, neither vanadate nor peroxide increased tyrosine phosphorylation when used alone (data not shown). When MO7e cells were exposed to 5 mm H2O2, the tyrosine phosphorylation pattern was similar to that of cells treated with pervanadate and also to that of BCR/ABL-transformed cells (Fig.3 A, left panel). The apparent similarities in tyrosine phosphorylation patterns of H2O2, pervanadate, and BCR/ABL were further explored by specifically looking at tyrosine phosphorylation of several known BCR/ABL substrates. H2O2 and pervanadate induced tyrosine phosphorylation of c-CBL, SHC, SHP-2, and c-ABL, although c-CBL was partially tyrosine-phosphorylated in unstimulated cells (Fig. 3 B). ROS-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins can be decreased by reducing agents such as PDTC and NAC (5Sattler M. Winkler T. Verma S. Byrne C.H. Shrikhande G. Salgia R. Griffin J.D. Blood. 1999; 93: 2928-2935Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Huang R.P. Wu J.X. Fan Y. Adamson E.D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 211-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 20Yeh L.H. Park Y.J. Hansalia R.J. Ahmed I.S. Deshpande S.S. Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Irani K. Alevriadou B.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C838-C847Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PDTC treatment of MO7/p210 cells gradually reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins over a 60-min time period (Fig.4 A, left panel). A significant reduction in tyrosine phosphorylation was observed for several, but not all, proteins with an apparent molecular mass between 210 and 55 kDa. PDTC also reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins in the Ph positive cell line K562, but had no effect on the Ph positive cell line BV173 under these conditions (data not shown). We next tested if NAC also decreases cellular tyrosine phosphorylation. MO7/p210 cells were left untreated or treated with NAC for 10 min. NAC was not cytotoxic under these conditions, and the cells were fully viable at the end of the experiment. Treatment of MO7/p210 cells with 4 mm NAC significantly reduced cellular tyrosine phosphorylation but had little effect at lower concentrations (Fig.4 A, right panel). The effect of PDTC on known BCR/ABL substrates that were shown before to be increased tyrosine phosphorylated by H2O2 and pervanate (Fig.3 B) was examined in MO7/p210 cells. PDTC decreased tyrosine phosphorylation of the BCR/ABL substrates c-CBL, SHP-2, and SHC (Fig.4 B). It is also possible that in addition to BCR/ABL, other tyrosine kinases, previously activated by BCR/ABL, are also reduced in their activity. This could be either a result of decreased BCR/ABL activity or a result of direct inhibition by PDTC and NAC. Overall, these data suggest that reducing agents like NAC and PDTC can decrease intracellular tyrosine kinase activity in BCR/ABL transformed cells. Reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of BCR/ABL substrates is consistent with activation of cellular PTPases, but could also be because of reduced BCR/ABL kinase activity. To address this issue, an in vitro kinase assay was performed using anti-ABL immune complexes from cell lysates of MO7/p210 cells that were left untreated, PDTC- (1 mm) treated, and PDTC-treated with subsequent pervanadate treatment. These immune complexes specifically phosphorylate the substrate GST-CRKL but not GST using lysate from untreated MO7p210 cells (Fig.5, top left). The in vitro kinase activity in anti-ABL immunoprecipitates and the BCR/ABL phosphorylation were reduced after PDTC treatment (Fig. 5,top right), and this correlated with the reduced phosphorylation of cellular proteins shown in Fig. 4 B. It is possible that the detected reduction in ABL kinase activity was also in part due to reduced c-ABL kinase activity. However, in the absence of ionizing radiation, the level of c-ABL kinase activity is thought to be extremely low (21Kharbanda S. Ren R.B. Pandey P. Shafman T.D. Feller S.M. Weichselbaum R.R. Kufe D.W. Nature. 1995; 376: 785-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). Because both H2O2 and pervanadate increase the tyrosine phosphorylation of c-ABL in intact MO7e cells, we also measured c-ABL in vitro kinase activity in cellular lysates from untransformed cells. The in vitro kinase activity toward GST-CRKL in ABL immune complexes was found to be elevated by H2O2 as well as pervanadate treatment of MO7e cells (Fig. 5, bottom panel). These results suggest that inactivation of PTPases alone is sufficient to activate ABL kinase activity. In addition, we used a recombinant ABL kinase domain and measured its phosphorylation in the presence or absence of 1 mm PDTC and 5 mm H2O2. We did not find significant changes in the phosphorylation of ABL (data not shown), suggesting that PDTC and H2O2 are unlikely to directly modulate ABL kinase activity. Thus, these data favor a mechanism whereby cellular ROS levels alter activity of one or more PTPases, which then regulate the kinase activity of both BCR/ABL and c-ABL. BCR/ABL mimics some signaling events induced by activated growth factor receptors (1Sattler M. Salgia R. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1997; 8: 63-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Recent evidence suggests that activation of growth factor receptors coincides with an increase of intracellular ROS levels, including the receptor for platelet-derived growth factor (3Sundaresan M., Yu, Z.X. Ferrans V.J. Irani K. Finkel T. Science. 1995; 270: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (2305) Google Scholar), transforming growth factor-β (4Ohba M. Shibanuma M. Kuroki T. Nose K. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1079-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar), or granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (5Sattler M. Winkler T. Verma S. Byrne C.H. Shrikhande G. Salgia R. Griffin J.D. Blood. 1999; 93: 2928-2935Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, antioxidants or antioxidant enzymes have been shown to reduce tyrosine phosphorylation events in cells stimulated with these growth factors. ROS are thought to signal, at least in part, through the inactivation of PTPases (7Denu J.M. Tanner K.G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5633-5642Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that BCR/ABL is associated with increased levels of ROS in three different hematopoietic cell lines compared with their nontransformed parental cell lines. In these untransformed cell lines, increasing ROS using exogenous H2O2 inhibited PTPase activity and dramatically increased tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins in MO7e cells in a pattern similar to that of the known PTPase inhibitor pervanadate. Consistent with a potential role of ROS in BCR/ABL signaling, we also found reduced PTPase activity in MO7/p210 cells. Further, BCR/ABL-induced tyrosine phosphorylation was inhibited by the addition of a reducing agent, PDTC. Finally, ABL kinase activity was shown to be regulated by ROS, suggesting that ROS play an important role in BCR/ABL-induced transformation. Thus, these data suggest a model in which BCR/ABL signaling is amplified by simultaneous reduction in the activity of one or more PTPases. It is not known how BCR/ABL modulates the levels of ROS. We have demonstrated that inhibition of the mitochondrial respiratory chain by rotenone significantly decreased intracellular ROS levels. This suggests that mitochondria are an important source for ROS in BCR/ABL-transformed cells. In addition, it is also possible that BCR/ABL affects the protein levels or enzymatic activities of one or more enzymes that regulate ROS. There is considerable precedent for BCR/ABL affecting the level of intracellular enzymes. For example, BCR/ABL is known to markedly reduce the expression of leukocyte alkaline phosphatase (22Rambaldi A. Terao M. Bettoni S. Bassan R. Battista R. Barbui T. Garattini E. Blood. 1989; 73: 1113-1115Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), increase the level of PTP1B (23LaMontagne K.R. Flint A.J. Franza B.R. Pendergast A.M. Tonks N.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2965-2975Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), and decrease the polyinositol 5-phosphatase SHIP (24Sattler M. Salgia R. Shrikhande G. Verma S. Choi J.L. Rohrschneider L.R. Griffin J.D. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2379-2384Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). One obvious candidate would be catalase, but in experiments not shown BCR/ABL did not alter catalase levels in MO7e cells as measured by immunoblotting. The growth promoting effect of ROS and the growth-inhibiting effect of antioxidants are of interest. The available data suggest that the mechanism involves enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation, possibly by inhibiting one or more PTPases. ROS can regulate protein function in part through oxidation of redox-sensitive cysteine residues in some proteins. For example, oxidation of Cys118 in RAS is known to activate its GTPase activity (25Lander H.M. Hajjar D.P. Hempstead B.L. Mirza U.A. Chait B.T. Campbell S. Quilliam L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4323-4326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Also, PTPases contain a redox-sensitive cysteine residue in their active site that must be in the reduced state for full enzyme activity (7Denu J.M. Tanner K.G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5633-5642Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). Recent work implies that ROS can modulate the function of protein kinases as well as PTPases. For example, the phosphorylation of cellular proteins can be increased by increasing kinase activities, decreasing PTPase activities, or both. This is of special interest because inhibition of PTPases through redox modulation would augment transformation. ROS have been demonstrated to activate signaling pathways by inducing tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins, including FAK (26Sonoda Y. Kasahara T. Yokota-Aizu E. Ueno M. Watanabe S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 241: 769-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), SHC (27Rao G.N. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 713-719PubMed Google Scholar), or LCK (28Yurchak L.K. Hardwick J.S. Amrein K. Pierno K. Sefton B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12549-12554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Suh et al. (29Suh Y.-A. Arnold R.S. Lassegue B. Shi J. Xu X. Sorescu D. Chung A.B. Griendling K.K. Lambeth J.D. Nature. 1999; 401: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (1270) Google Scholar) have recently demonstrated that increased production of ROS can lead to a transforming phenotype. Overexpression of the superoxide-generating NADPH oxidase Mox1 in NIH3T3 fibroblasts increases cell growth and induces tumors in athymic mice (29Suh Y.-A. Arnold R.S. Lassegue B. Shi J. Xu X. Sorescu D. Chung A.B. Griendling K.K. Lambeth J.D. Nature. 1999; 401: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (1270) Google Scholar). However, the exact mechanism of ROS action has not been entirely elucidated. We have demonstrated that the PTPase activity in untransformed cells is decreased by H2O2 and upon BCR/ABL transformation. We have also shown that PDTC inhibits BCR/ABL autokinase activity and reduces the total cellular tyrosine phosphorylation. It is possible that this effect is mediated in part by activation of PTPases. It will therefore be of interest to determine if BCR/ABL is not only involved in generating ROS but is also regulated by redox-sensitive PTPases itself. Likely candidates that would regulate BCR/ABL function are PTPases that are known to interact with the BCR/ABL kinase such as SHP-1 (30Tauchi T. Ohyashiki K. Yamashita Y. Sugimoto S. Toyama K. Int. J. Oncol. 1997; 11: 471-475PubMed Google Scholar), SHP-2 (31Tauchi T. Feng G.S. Shen R. Song H.Y. Donner D. Pawson T. Broxmeyer H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15381-15387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or PTP1B (23LaMontagne K.R. Flint A.J. Franza B.R. Pendergast A.M. Tonks N.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2965-2975Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The high level of tyrosine phosphorylation of SHP-1 (30Tauchi T. Ohyashiki K. Yamashita Y. Sugimoto S. Toyama K. Int. J. Oncol. 1997; 11: 471-475PubMed Google Scholar) and SHP-2 (31Tauchi T. Feng G.S. Shen R. Song H.Y. Donner D. Pawson T. Broxmeyer H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15381-15387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in BCR/ABL-expressing cells demonstrates an imbalance between kinase and PTPase activities. Our data demonstrating a decrease in PTPase activity in BCR/ABL-transformed MO7e cells compared with untransformed cells are consistent with the known reduced alkaline phosphatase activity in CML cells (32Pedersen B. Br. J. Haematol. 1982; 51: 339-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Both in vitro activities overlap because PTPase activity as well as alkaline phosphatase activity can be measured with the same substrates, including tyrosine-phosphorylated peptides andp-nitrophenyl-phosphate (22Rambaldi A. Terao M. Bettoni S. Bassan R. Battista R. Barbui T. Garattini E. Blood. 1989; 73: 1113-1115Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Sparks J.W. Brautigan D.L. J. Biol.

Biochem. 1999; 72: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). It will be important to identify the specific PTPases that contribute to the observed reduction in PTPase activity and evaluate their response to changes in the cellular redox status. In contrast to the data presented here, LaMontagne et al. (18LaMontagne K.R. Hannon G. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14094-14099Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) have reported an increase in PTPase activity in BCR/ABL-transformed RAT1 fibroblasts compared with untransformed cells. The increase in PTPase activity was solely contributed to a severalfold increase in PTP1B protein expression (23LaMontagne K.R. Flint A.J. Franza B.R. Pendergast A.M. Tonks N.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2965-2975Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). However, the increase in PTP1B expression was not maintained when subclones of BCR/ABL expressing RAT1 fibroblasts were examined (18LaMontagne K.R. Hannon G. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14094-14099Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). We did not detect significant BCR/ABL-dependent PTP1B induction in three different hematopoietic cell lines, including MO7e, Ba/F3, and 32Dcl3 cells, or a Ba/F3 cell line with BCR/ABL expression under the control of a doxycycline inducible promoter (data not shown). It is possible that the measured differences in the amount of PTPase activity are because of the different PTPase substrates used for analysis. Of particular relevance to human CML is the fact that an increase in ROS could also have long term consequences for genetic stability. ROS levels are not only quenched by enzymes, antioxidants, sulfydryl groups, but also by reacting with DNA bases (35Dreher D. Junod A.F. Eur. J. Cancer. 1996; 1: 30-38Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (767) Google Scholar). ROS can modify the DNA bases adenosine, guanosine, thymidine, or cytosine and lead to derivates such as 5-formamido-4.6-diamino-pyrimidine, 8-hydroxy-guanine, thymine glycol, and 5-hydroxy-cytosine, respectively (36Halliwell B. Aruoma O.I. FEBS Lett. 1991; 281: 9-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (1458) Google Scholar). Although these modifications can be efficiently removed by DNA repair mechanisms, a persistent increase in ROS could lead to accumulation of mutations, and ROS have previously been linked to tumor induction as a result of tobacco smoke (37Spencer J.P. Jenner A. Chimel K. Aruoma O.I. Cross C.E. Wu R. Halliwell B. FEBS Lett. 1995; 375: 179-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 38Pryor W.A. Stone K. Zang L.Y. Bermudez E. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1998; 11: 441-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 39Yoshie Y. Ohshima H. Carcinogenesis. 1997; 18: 1359-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In the CML stable phase, ROS therefore have the potential to lead to additional mutations that could contribute to progression of CML. In any case, it is likely that further characterization of redox-sensitive PTPases and other proteins will be helpful in understanding the signaling of BCR/ABL and in particular its mechanism of transformation. Our studies, using antioxidants to reduce the kinase activity of BCR/ABL and reducing the cell growth of BCR/ABL expressing cells point at new targets of drug treatment of CML. Ideally, drugs that would be efficient in CML treatment would lower ROS through targeting directly the ROS-producing enzymes or would supplement the antioxidative potential of cells. Such drugs could be used in combination with BCR/ABL kinase inhibitors such as STI571 to block BCR/ABL signaling and thus progression of the disease."

This had no evident effect in the mutant ferritin clone, whereas it induced an iron-deficient phenotype in the H-ferritin wild type clone, manifested by ∼5-fold increase of IRPs activity, ∼2.5-fold increase of transferrin receptor, ∼1.8-fold increase in iron-transferrin iron uptake, and ∼50% reduction of labile iron pool.

They are made of 24 subunits that assemble in an almost spherical shell to delimit a cavity where iron is accommodated and concentrated in a mineral and compact form. Mammalian ferritin are composed of two subunit types, the H- and L-chains, with ∼50% sequence identity and very similar three-dimensional structures made of a four-helix bundle (1Harrison P.M. Arosio P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1275: 161-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (2278) Google Scholar). The mRNAs for the two chains have nearly identical iron-responsive elements (IREs)1 close to the 5′ termini that bind to the iron sensors iron-regulatory proteins (IRPs) with a mechanism that determines a tight translational iron-dependent regulation of protein expression (2Rouault T.A. Klausner R.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 174-177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 3Hentze M.W. Kuhn L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8175-8182Crossref PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar). Iron supplementation to cells in culture determines a strong up-regulation of both ferritin chains, whereas treatment with chelating agents such as desferrioxamine determines an almost total suppression of ferritin accumulation in about 24 h (4Cairo G. Bardella L. Schiaffonati L. Arosio P. Levi S. Bernelli-Zazzera A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 133: 314-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Ferritin function has been studied mainly in vitro, using horse spleen ferritin first and recombinant proteins later. The recombinant ferritins have the property of being composed by a single subunit type, the H-chain, L-chain, or artificial variants (5Levi S. Luzzago A. Cesareni G. Cozzi A. Franceschinelli F. Albertini A. Arosio P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18086-18092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although these homopolymers are virtually nonexistent in mammalian cells, the approach proved instructive and showed important functional differences between the two gene products. The recombinant L-chain homopolymers purify fromEscherichia coli as iron poor proteins, induce a slow uptake of iron from Fe(II) salts, and are more stable to denaturants than the H-homopolymers (6Levi S. Salfeld J. Franceschinelli F. Cozzi A. Dorner M.H. Arosio P. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 5179-5184Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 7Santambrogio P. Levi S. Arosio P. Palagi L. Vecchio G.

The L-subunit has no catalytic activity on its own, but it facilitates the activity of the H-subunits by offering sites for iron nucleation and mineralization and increasing the turnover at the ferroxidase centers (8Levi S.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9743-9750Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Recombinant H-chain homopolymers purify from E. coli as iron-containing molecules and induce fast iron oxidation (5Levi S. Luzzago A. Cesareni G. Cozzi A. Franceschinelli F. Albertini A. Arosio P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18086-18092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This is due to the presence of ferroxidase centers buried inside the protein fold and consisting in di-iron binding sites coordinated by atoms of seven residues that are conserved in most ferritins from animals, plants, and bacteria (1Harrison P.M. Arosio P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1275: 161-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (2278) Google Scholar, 11Lawson D.M. Artymiuk P.J. Yewdall S.J. Smith J.M. Livingstone J.C. Treffry A. Luzzago A. Levi S. Arosio P. Cesareni G. Nature. 1991; 349: 541-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). These catalytic sites accelerate Fe(II) oxidation, which is a rate-limiting step in the mechanism of ferritin iron incorporation, in a reaction that consumes one dioxygen molecule/two Fe(II) ions with the production of hydrogen peroxide (10Yang X. Chen-Barrett Y. Arosio P. Chasteen N.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9743-9750Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Present understanding of the mechanism of in vitro ferritin iron uptake indicates that Fe(II) ions move inside the cavity through hydrophilic channels on the 3-fold symmetry axes and the transfer is facilitated by the presence of local metal binding sites (12Levi S. Santambrogio P. Corsi B. Cozzi A. Arosio P. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 467-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The iron then localizes in the ferroxidase centers where a fast interaction with O2 occurs with the formation of a transient peroxodiferric complexes that readily decay (13Hwang J. Krebs C. Huynh B.H. Edmondson D.E. Theil E.C. Penner-Hahn J.E. Science. 2000; 287: 122-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), the resulting μ-oxo bridged di-iron intermediates then split, and the mononuclear Fe(III) complexes move to the cavity where they hydrolyze to build iron cores of up to 4000 iron atoms (1Harrison P.M. Arosio P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1275: 161-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (2278) Google Scholar, 14Harrison P.M. Bauminger E.R. Hechel D. Hodson N.W. Nowik I. Treffry A. Yewdall S.J. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1994; 356: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The vacated ferroxidase center is then available for other cycles of iron oxidation (10Yang X. Chen-Barrett Y. Arosio P. Chasteen N.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9743-9750Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In vitro, in parallel to the catalyzed reaction, spontaneous iron oxidations occur with the stoichiometry of four Fe(II) ions per O2molecule and the formation of water. These reactions predominate at high iron concentrations and high pH values and occur also inside the cavity on iron core surface after it has reached a sufficiently large size (15Yang X. Chasteen N.D. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 615-618Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, in the ferritin iron is oxidized on the catalytic center and on the surface of the mineral core, but the physiological relevance of the latter is dubious. In fact, in conditions in which spontaneous iron hydrolysis does not occur, ferritin can still incorporate iron, although with lower efficiency, as in the case Fe(III) chelated to citrate or nitrilotriacetate (NTA) in the presence of ascorbate. This reaction, which is possibly closer to that occurring in the cell, necessitates of the ferroxidase activity of H-chain and the integrity of hydrophilic channels (16Santambrogio P. Levi S. Cozzi A. Corsi B. Arosio P. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The in vivo functionality of ferritin is more complex than that predicted by the in vitro data, because of interactions with other molecules and the poor characterization of the iron forms accessible to the ferritin inside the cell. The analysis of the distinct roles of H- and L-subunits is facilitated by the bypassing of the IRE-IRPs iron-mediated regulation that equally affects the two chains. This occurs in the hereditary hyperferritinemia cataract syndrome where heterogeneous point mutations in the IRE sequence of L-subunit determine a constitutive up-regulation of thel-ferritin expression with protein accumulation in serum and tissues to levels 10–20-fold higher than normal, without evident effects on body iron metabolism (17Beaumont C.

Arbustini E. Grasso M. Vercesi E. Barosi G. Bianchi P.E. Cairo G. Arosio P. Blood. 1997; 90: 814-821Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of immortalized cells from these subjects showed that the accumulated L-subunit homopolymers were incompetent in iron incorporation within the cells (19Levi S. Girelli D. Perrone F. Pasti M. Beaumont C. Corrocher R. Albertini A. Arosio P. Blood. 1998; 91: 4180-4187Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To study the role of H-subunit, its cDNA was inserted under strong promoters and used to obtain transient transfected COS cells. However the system proved not very informative, because the exogenous ferritin did not coassemble with the endogenous ones and the resulting transfectant ferritins were apparently nonfunctional in iron incorporation or in modifying cellular iron metabolism (20Corsi B. Perrone F. Bourgeois M. Beaumont C. Panzeri M.C. Cozzi A. Sangregorio R. Santambrogio P. Albertini A. Arosio P. Levi S. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 315-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). More instructive was the production of mouse erythroleukemic (MEL) cells lines stably transfected with mouse ferritin H-chain cDNA in which the IRE was inactivated and H-ferritin was constitutively up-regulated (21Picard V. Renaudie F. Porcher C. Hentze M.W. Grandchamp B. Beaumont C. Blood. 1996; 87: 2057-2064Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cells accumulated H-ferritin up to 5-fold over background and were found to be iron starving and to have significant reduction of labile iron pool; in addition they showed reduced heme and hemoglobin synthesis, were more resistant to oxidative damage, and had multidrug resistance properties (21Picard V. Renaudie F. Porcher C. Hentze M.W. Grandchamp B. Beaumont C. Blood. 1996; 87: 2057-2064Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Epsztejn S. Glickstein H. Picard V. Slotki I.N. Breuer W. Beaumont C.

The results indicate that the H-subunit has active roles in regulating iron-related metabolic processes, whereas the L-chain seem inactive. This opens the question of whether the H-chain activity is dependent only on its ferroxidase activity. With the aim of clarifying this point, we produced HeLa cell lines transfected with cDNA for the full human H-chain and a variant with inactivated ferroxidase activity. The cDNAs were under the tetracycline-responsive promoter, and protein expression was induced by withdrawal of doxycycline. It was found that in HeLa cells H-chain overexpression induced iron deprivation, which reduced cell growth and increased resistance to oxidative damage by H2O2. These effects were reverted by prolonged cell supplementation with ferric salts and were absent in the mutant ferritin transfectants. The results show that H-ferritin functional activity in HeLa cells is mediated by the ferroxidase activity and indicate that most of the features of the in vitro mechanism of ferritin iron incorporation apply to the in vivoconditions. The cDNAs for the human entire coding sequences of human H-chain wild type and H-222 mutant (E62K, H65G) were generated by polymerase chain reaction and subcloned into pUDH10–3 vector (24Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4268) Google Scholar) under the control of tTA promoter to obtain pUD-HFt and pUD-222Ft plasmids that encode for the entire ferritin H-chain and its mutant 222, respectively. HeLa-tet Off cells (CLONTECH) were co-transfected with 3.5 μg of pUD-HFt or pUD-222Ft plasmids and with 1 μg of pTK-Hyg plasmid (5:1 molar ratio) (CLONTECH) using calcium phosphate method (25Jordan M. Schallhorn A. Wurm F.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 596-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). The colonies were grown in DMEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) with hygromycin D (150 μg/ml) and doxycycline (2 μg/ml), and the surviving ones were screened for the integration of ferritin genes by polymerase chain reaction. Clones were further tested for protein expression by growing them up to 30 days in the absence of doxycycline and analyzing ferritin content in the cell extracts. The selected cells were maintained in DMEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (CLONTECH), 100 μg/ml G418 (Geneticin, Sigma), 150 μg/ml hygromycin D (CLONTECH), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 1 mml-glutamine, and with (Dox+) or without (Dox−) 2 ng/ml doxycycline (Sigma). Extracts of 106 cells were analyzed for ferritin content by using ELISA assays based on monoclonal antibodies specific for the H-ferritin (rH02) and the l-ferritin (LF03) calibrated on the corresponding recombinant homopolymers expressed in E. coli(26Cozzi A. Levi S. Bazzigaluppi E. Ruggeri G. Arosio P. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1989; 184: 197-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Protein content was evaluated by BCA method (Pierce) calibrated on bovine serum albumin. In immunoblot experiments 3 μg of soluble proteins were loaded on 12% SDS-PAGE, and the nitrocellulose filters were incubated with anti-TfR antibody (dilution 1:1000) (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) followed by secondary, peroxidase-labeled antibody (Envision, DAKO). Bound activity was revealed by ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cells (5 × 105) were grown for 1 h in DMEM w/ol-glutamine, methionine, and cysteine (ICN), 0.5% fetal calf serum, 0.5% bovine serum albumin and then were labeled for 18 h with 50 μCi/ml [35S]methionine (ICN) in the same medium (19Levi S. Girelli D. Perrone F. Pasti M. Beaumont C. Corrocher R. Albertini A. Arosio P. Blood. 1998; 91: 4180-4187Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed with 500 μl of lysis buffer (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mm LiCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40). Total radioactivity associated to the soluble proteins were determined by trichloroacetic acid precipitation. For immunoprecipitation studies, 4 × 106 cpm of cytosolic lysates were precleared by incubation with 30 μl of protein A-Sepharose 50% v/v (Sigma) for 1 h at 4 °C with gentle shaking and centrifuged for 1 min at 14,000 rpm. Then anti-ferritin L-chain antibody LFO3 (30 μg) and protein A-Sepharose (30 μl) were added, the samples were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C, and the precipitates were collected. The soluble fractions were further incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with 30 μg of anti-ferritin H-chain antibody rH02 and protein A-Sepharose (30 μl) and precipitated (19Levi S. Girelli D. Perrone F. Pasti M. Beaumont C. Corrocher R. Albertini A. Arosio P. Blood. 1998; 91: 4180-4187Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The immunobeads were washed resuspended in SDS buffer, boiled for 10 min, and loaded on 12% polyacrylamide SDS-PAGE. The gels were treated with autoradiography image enhancer (Amplify; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), dried, and exposed. The intensity of ferritin subunit bands was quantified by densitometry. In other experiments, after 18 h labeling with [35S]methionine, the cells were washed twice with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline and then grown in the complete medium. At the indicated times the cells were harvested and lysed, and 10 μg of soluble extract protein were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-H-ferritin antibody as above. Electromobility shifts assays for IRP activity were performed as in Ref. 27Corsi B. Levi S. Cozzi A. Corti A. Altimare D. Albertini A. Arosio P. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 149-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar. Cells (2 × 105) were lysed, and 2-μg samples of soluble proteins were incubated with a molar excess of 32P-labeled H-ferritin IRE probe, RNase T1, and heparin in the presence or the absence of 2% 2-mercaptoethanol. RNA protein complexes were separated on 6% nondenaturing PAGE and exposed to autoradiography. The cellular LIP was measured essentially as described in Ref. 23Picard V. Epsztejn S. Santambrogio P.

Cells (2 × 106) were incubated with 0.250 μm calcein-AM (Molecular Probes) for 15 min at 37 °C in bicarbonate free medium containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.3. After washing the cells were resuspended in 2 ml of HBS (145 mm NaCl, pH 7.2, 20 mm HEPES), and 1 ml of cell suspension was placed in a stirred, thermostated (37 °C) cuvette; the fluorescence was monitored at an excitation of 488 nm and an emission of 517 nm in an instruments LS50B (Perkin-Elmer). The quenching of calcein by intracellular iron was revealed by addition of 100 μmisonicotionoyl salicylaldehyde hydrazone (kindly donated by Dr. P. Ponka). Cells (2 × 105) were grown for 18 h in the presence of 1 μm55Fe-transferrin in DMEM, 0.5% fetal calf serum, 0.5% bovine serum albumin. The cells were washed and lysed in 0.3 ml of lysis buffer, and after centrifugation 10 μl of the soluble fraction was mixed with 0.3 ml of Ultima Gold (Packard) and counted for 1 min in a scintillator counter (Packard). The soluble proteins were analyzed also on nondenaturing PAGE (7% polyacrylamide) directly or after immunoprecipitation (19Levi S. Girelli D. Perrone F. Pasti M. Beaumont C. Corrocher R. Albertini A. Arosio P. Blood. 1998; 91: 4180-4187Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Gels were dried and exposed to autoradiography. In the experiments to evaluate the effect of cell integrity on ferritin iron uptake, the cells in DMEM, 0.5% fetal calf serum, 0.5% bovine serum albumin or in lysis buffer were added to 2 μCi/ml 55Fe-NTA (1:10), 200 μm ascorbic acid and incubated for 3 h at 37 °C, and the protein was separated in nondenaturing PAGE. To evaluate the rate of cell growth, the cells were counted, and 104 of them were plated in 96 wells culture plates (Greiner) in octaplicate in normal medium. They were grown for 18 h at 37 °C in DMEM, then MTT was added, and after 3 h the developed color was read at 570 nm (28Cory A.H. Owen T.C. Barltrop J.A. Cory J.G. Cancer Commun. 1991; 3: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (1319) Google Scholar), following manufacturer's instructions (MTT assay, Sigma). In the experiments in which the cytotoxic effect of H2O2 was analyzed, the cells were plated at different concentrations (1.5 × 104 of the induced Hwt-tTA cells and 104 of the other cells) to obtain analogous reading at 570 nm after 18 h growth at 37 °C. Then cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, incubated for 1 h in serum free medium, added of different concentrations of H2O2, and further incubated for 2 h. Finally, the plates were washed twice, and cellular vitality was measured by incubating the cells in MTT for 3 h as above. The cDNAs for human H-ferritin wild type and for its mutant named 222 in which ferroxidase activity was inactivated by the substitutions E62K+H65G (29Levi S. Yewdall S.J. Harrison P.M. Santambrogio P. Cozzi A. Rovida E. Albertini A. Arosio P. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 591-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) were subcloned into the pUHD10-3 vector under the control of inducible tetracycline responsive promoter (24Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4268) Google Scholar). The constructs were used to transfect HeLa cells, and among the stable transfectant clones obtained we selected the ones that expressed the highest levels of ferritin after induction. The clones were named Hwt-tTA and H222-tTA, respectively. Ferritin levels in the cell homogenates were measured by specific ELISA assays, and we found that the ferritin expression was maximally repressed at doxycycline (Dox) concentrations >2 ng/ml and fully derepressed with Dox concentrations <0.015 ng/ml (not shown). Upon withdrawal of the drug (from 2 ng/ml Dox), the H-ferritin concentration increased steadily in the H222-tTA clone up to day 7 and then leveled off, whereas H-ferritin accumulation in Hwt-tTA clone showed a biphasic pattern with a maximum around day 4 followed by a decrease (Fig. 1). The maximum H-ferritin concentrations reached in the two clones were similar and 14–16-fold higher than that of untransfected parent cells (TableI). In the repressed Dox+ H222-tTA clone H-ferritin level was analogous to that of untransfected HeLa cell, whereas in the Hwt-tTA clone it was slightly higher possibly for some leakiness. The concentration of the partner l-ferritin was consistently higher in the repressed Dox+ than in the derepressed Dox− clones (Table I). For a qualitative analysis of the isoferritins the cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]Met, and the homogenates were immunoprecipitated first with anti-ferritin L-chain and then with anti-H-chain antibodies, a system that separates ferritin heteropolymers from the H-homopolymers (20Corsi B. Perrone F. Bourgeois M. Beaumont C. Panzeri M.C. Cozzi A. Sangregorio R. Santambrogio P. Albertini A. Arosio P. Levi S. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 315-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The H-chain homopolymers were undetectable in the untransfected and repressed cells, as expected, whereas they were highly represented in both derepressed clones (Fig. 2, lanes 5 and9). Densitometry showed that the ferritin heteropolymers in derepressed Dox− cells (Fig. 2, lanes 2 and 7) had a H- to L-chain ratio of about 20 to 1, whereas in the repressed or untransfected cells, the ratio was in the range of 4–5 to 1 (Fig. 2,lanes 1, 3, and 8).Table IMaximum ferritin accumulation in transfected HeLa-tTA cellsCellsH-FerritinL-Ferritinng/mg total proteinng/mg total proteinHeLa234 ± 26.619.7 ± 4.5Hwt-tTA dox+400 ± 97.732.0 ± 8.2Hwt-tTA dox−3716 ± 92115.4 ± 5.1H222-tTA dox+291 ± 4032.8 ± 10H222-tTA dox−4056 ± 63310.2 ± 4.2Cells were grown up to 7 days in the presence or the absence of 2 ng/ml doxycycline (dox), and the extracts of 106 cells were analyzed for ferritin content with ELISA assays specific for H- and L-ferritins.

The results are expressed as ng of ferritin/mg of total soluble protein. The values are the means and S.D. of seven experiments in triplicate. Cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]Met for 18 h, and then the ferritins immunoprecipitated at various times with anti-H-chain antibody. Ferritin remained detectable up to 24 h after labeling and disappeared at similar rates in the untransfected parent cells and in the transfected cells, repressed or not (Fig.3). The H to L ratio did not change throughout the experiments, indicating that the two chains degrade at similar rates and that the homo- and hetero-polymers of Hwt or H222 mutant have similar stability. The calculated half time of about 18–24 h is in agreement with that found in human fibroblasts (30Roberts S. Bomford A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19181-119187Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Electromobility shift assays for IRE binding activity of the IRPs were carried out on the cell extracts. The activity, indicated by the intensity of the IRE-IRP complex, was analogous in the repressed and derepressed H222-tTA clone, whereas it was about 5-fold higher in the derepressed than the repressed Hwt-tTA clone (Fig.4 A). In derepressed Hwt-tTA clone, the IRP activity was down-regulated by iron supplementation, although less so than in the corresponding repressed cells, and it was only marginally up-regulated by desferrioxamine treatment, likely because already highly activated (Fig. 4 B). The effect of IRP up-regulation in the derepressed Hwt-tTA clone was manifested by a 2.5-fold higher accumulation of transferrin receptor, detected by Western blotting, compared with the other cells (Fig.4 C). The influence of Hwt or H222-ferritin overexpression on cellular LIP was measured by a fluorescent permeable metal sensor calcein-AM (23Picard V. Epsztejn S. Santambrogio P. Cabantchik Z.I. Beaumont C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15382-15386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Cells were loaded by 15 min of incubation with 0.250 μmcalcein-AM at 37 °C, and after extensive washing the highly permeable iron chelator isonicotionoyl salicylaldehyde hydrazone was added. The increase in fluorescence secondary to isonicotionoyl salicylaldehyde hydrazone sequestration of calcein bound iron, which cause dequenching, provides a reliable index of labile iron concentration. The variation of fluorescence was analogous in the derepressed and repressed H222-tTA clone (Fig.5 B), whereas in the repressed Hwt-tTA clone it was about 2-fold higher than in the derepressed conditions, implying that H-ferritin overexpression reduced iron available to calcein binding (Fig. 5 A). Cells were incubated for 18 h with 55Fe-Tf, and, after washing, the radioactivity associated to the soluble fraction of cell homogenates or to ferritins was determined. Total cellular iron uptake was analogous in the parent HeLa cells and in the transfected and repressed clones, whereas it increased of about 1.8-fold in the derepressed Hwt-tTA, but not in the derepressed H222-tTA clone (Fig.6 A). Autoradiography of55Fe labeled cellular homogenates separated on nondenaturing PAGE showed that essentially all protein-bound radioactivity was associated to ferritin, and that band intensities were stronger in the derepressed Hwt-tTA clone than in control cells (Fig. 6 B). To further analyze in which ferritin compartment the iron was allocated, the 55Fe-labeled homogenates were immunoprecipitated with saturating amount of anti-l-ferritin antibody to remove ferritin heteropolymers and then analyzed on nondena"
https://openalex.org/W1756010385,"Diethylstilbestrol (DES) was widely used to treat pregnant women through 1971. The reproductive tracts of their female offspring exposed to DES in utero are characterized by anatomic abnormalities. Here we show that DES administered to mice in utero produces changes in the expression pattern of several Hox genes that are involved in patterning of the reproductive tract. DES produces posterior shifts in Hox gene expression and homeotic anterior transformations of the reproductive tract. In human uterine or cervical cell cultures, DES induces HOXA9 or HOXA10 gene expression, respectively, to levels approximately twofold that induced by estradiol. The DES-induced expression is not inhibited by cyclohexamide. Estrogens are novel morphogens that directly regulate the expression pattern of posterior Hox genes in a manner analogous to retinoic acid regulation of anterior Hox genes. Alterations in HOX gene expression are a molecular mechanism by which DES affects reproductive tract development. Changes in Hox gene expression are a potential marker for the effects of in utero drug use that may become apparent only at late stages of development."

At present, it is not known whether Cbfa1 regulates any of the osteoblast-derived factors involved in the bone resorption pathway. Osteoprotegerin (OPG) is an osteoblast-secreted glycoprotein that functions as a potent inhibitor of osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption. Cloning and computer analysis of a 5.9-kilobase human OPG promoter sequence revealed the presence of 12 putative Cbfa1 binding elements (osteoblast-specific element 2 (OSE2)), suggesting a possible regulation of OPG by Cbfa1. We cloned the promoter upstream of the β-galactosidase reporter gene (pOPG5.9βgal) and evaluated whether Cbfa1 could regulate its expression in transient transfection assays. The 5.9-kilobase promoter directed increased levels of reporter gene expression, reminiscent of OPG protein levels in osteoblastic cell lines (BALC and U2OS) as compared with the nonosteoblastic cell line COS1. Cotransfection of a Cbfa1 expression construct along with pOPG5.9βgal reporter construct led to 39-, 7-, and 16-fold increases in β-galactosidase activity in COS1, BALC, and U2OS cells, respectively. Removal of all the putative OSE2 elements led to an almost complete loss of transactivation. Mutational analysis demonstrated that the proximal OSE2 element contributes to a majority of the effects of Cbfa1, and Cbfa1 bound to the proximal element in a sequence-specific manner. Further, overexpression of Cbfa1 led to a 54% increase in OPG protein levels in U2OS cells.

Osteoclasts that are primarily involved in bone resorption are multinucleated cells derived from hematopoietic precursors of the monocyte/macrophage series.

While the role of Cbfa1 in osteoblast differentiation and bone formation is fairly well understood, it is not known whether it can modulate the expression of regulators of osteoclast differentiation and function, namely RANK ligand and OPG, that are generated by cells of the osteoblast lineage. To search for any potential role of Cbfa1 in regulating osteoclast formation, we directly examined the effect of Cbfa1 on OPG gene transcription by cloning a 5.9-kb region of the human OPG promoter and analyzed its transcriptional activity in cotransfection experiments. We present evidence that Cbfa1 increases OPG gene transcription in osteoblastic and nonosteoblastic cells, via sequence-specific binding and transactivation mediated by the OSE2 elements and that Cbfa1 overexpression enhances OPG protein levels in osteoblastic cells. To clone the human OPG promoter, two approaches were combined to identify and isolate an approximately 5.9-kb genomic fragment located immediately 5′ to the coding region of the OPG gene. The first approach involved using the Genome Walker kit (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). This is a PCR-based method used to “walk” genomic DNA adjacent to known sequences. Gene-specific primers were designed from the published OPG sequence (GenBankTM accession number U94332) (27Morinaga T. Nakagawa N. Yasuda H. Tsuda E. Higashio K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 685-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) as follows: GSP1 5′-gga gat gtc cag aaa cac gag cgc gca g-3′ and nested GSP2 5′-cac agc aac ttg ttc att gtg gtc ccc-3′. These primers were used in combination with primers specific to the Genome Walker library adapter to amplify 1874-, 1473-, and 391-bp fragments of DNA upstream of the OPG coding region. Sequence analysis demonstrated that these were overlapping proximal fragments of the 5′-flanking region of the OPG gene. To clone larger promoter fragments containing more distal sequences we next screened a conventional genomic library. To do this, the full-length OPG cDNA (GenBankTM accession numberU94332) was sent to Genome Systems (St. Louis, MO) and used to screen a human P1 library. The screen yielded three positive clones, each containing 70–100 kb of genomic DNA. To determine which P1 clone contained the promoter, each clone was digested with a panel of restriction enzymes and then Southern blotted with the 1874-bp promoter fragment described above. Clone 19401 digested with SstI andEco47III yielded a 5936-bp band that hybridized to the 1874-bp OPG promoter fragment. This 5936-bp fragment was then gel purified and cloned. All plasmid constructs containing 5′ deletions in the OPG promoter were generated using standard cloning procedures. The 5936-bp SstI-Eco47III fragment of the human OPG gene, containing sequences from −5917 to +19 relative to the transcriptional start site, was cloned into theSstI/SmaI site of pGL3-Basic (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI) and designated pOPG5.9. pOPG3.6 (−3621 to +19) was derived from pOPG5.9 by digesting with SstI andNaeI, releasing about 2.3 kb of the 5′ end of the OPG promoter. Then the ends were blunted with T4 DNA polymerase and religated with T4 DNA ligase. The SmaI-Eco47III fragments from OPG promoter fragments (1874, 1473, and 391 bp) amplified from the Genome Walker library were cloned into theSmaI site of pGL3-Basic (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI) to obtain pOPG1.9 (−1855 to +19), pOPG1.5 (−1454 to +19), and pOPG0.4 (−372 to +19), respectively. The construct pOPG0.9 (−872 to +19) was generated by cloning the 0.9-kb XhoI fragment of pOPG1.5 into the same site in pGL3-Basic and screening for the proper orientation. pOPG0.2 (−188 to +19) was derived from pOPG0.4 by digesting with BamHI/BglII and subcloning the 0.2-kb insert into the BglII site in pGL3-Basic. pOPG5.9, pOPG3.6, pOPG1.9, pOPG1.5, pOPG0.9, pOPG0.4, and pOPG0.2 were digested with KpnI and BglII, and the promoter fragments were subcloned into the KpnI/BglII sites of pβgal-basic (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA), to generate pOPG5.9βgal, pOPG3.6βgal, pOPG1.9βgal, pOPG1.5βgal, pOPG0.9βgal pOPG0.4βgal, and pOPG0.2βgal, respectively. For site-directed mutagenesis of the proximal OSE2 element, the OSE2 core element (AACCTCA) (OSE2 element 1, −309 to −303; see Table I and Fig. 1) in the pOPG0.9βgal construct (in the pβgal-Basic vector backbone) was substituted with a random sequence of 7 nucleotides (AGATATC; theEcoRV recognition site is underlined) using the two-step PCR strategy (28). The mutant primers used for the two first step PCR reactions were 5′-ctc atc aat gta tct tat gg-3′ (pβgal-F: vector primer) with 5′-gct gtc tcc gcg ggg ctc gat atc ttc ccg gcc cct tcc cgc c-3′ (OSEmutRev) and 5′-ggc ggg aag ggg ccg gga aga tat cga gcc ccg cgg aga cag cag ccg-3′ (OSEmutFor) with 5′-gtc aaa gta aac gac atg-3′ (pβgal-R: vector primer). The second step PCR reaction was performed with flanking primers (pβgal-F and pβgal-R), using the first step PCR products as template. To generate the OSE2 mutant construct (pOPG0.9OSEmutβgal), the second step PCR product was digested with Asp718 and BglII and was ligated to pβgal-Basic vector containing Asp718 and BglII ends. To generate the OSE2 mutation in pOPG0.4βgal, the 0.4-kb region containing the mutation was PCR amplified from pOPG0.9OSEmutβgal using the primers 5′-ata ggt acc gcc cag ccc tcc cac cgc tgg t-3′ (OPG392AspF) and pβgal-R. The PCR product was digested with Asp718 and BglII and ligated to pβgal-Basic vector that was digested with the same enzymes. To create a substitution mutation in the proximal OSE2 element in pOPG5.9βgal, a XhoI fragment was removed from pOPG5.9βgal and replaced with the XhoI fragment from pOPG0.9OSEmutβgal. Deletion of the proximal OSE2 element (pOPG 0.3βgal) was achieved by subcloning the 312-bpSacII-BglII fragment from pOPG0.4βgal into pβgal-Basic.Table ILocation and sequence of putative OSE2 and OSE2-like elements in the 5.9-kb OPG promoterOSE2 elementSequencePosition relative to transcription start site125′-TGTGGGT-3′−5909 to −5903115′-AGCCACA-3′−5784 to −5778105′-AGCCTCA-3′−5599 to −559395′-CACCTCA-3′−5572 to −556685′-GACCTCA-3′−3520 to −351475′-ACCCACA-3′−3409 to −340365′-GCCCACA-3′−2526 to −252055′-GCCCACA-3′−2398 to −239245′-AACCTCA-3′−2139 to −213335′-ACCCACA-3′−1614 to −160825′-GACCACA-3′−990 to −98415′-AACCTCA-3′−309 to −303 Open table in a new tab For the addition of OSE2 element(s) to pOPG0.2βgal, either one or three copies of the consensus OSE2 sequence from the osteocalcin promoter was included in the 5′ (forward) primers (1XocOSEOPG primer: 5′-ata tgg tac cgc tgc aat cac caa cca cag cgg atc ctt tcc gcc cca gcc ctg a-3′; 3XocOSEOPG primer: 5′-ata tgg tac cgc tgc aat cac caa cca cag cgc tgc aat cac caa cca cag cgc tgc aat cac caa cca cag cgg atc ctt tcc gcc cca gcc ctg a-3′), and the 0.2-kb OPG promoter fragment was amplified using one of the forward primers and pβgal-R reverse primer, from pOPG0.2βgal template. The resultant PCR products were digested with Asp718 and BglII and ligated to pβgal-Basic vector that was digested with the same enzymes, to generate the 1xOSE-pOPG0.2βgal and 3xOSE-pOPG0.2βgal plasmids. pEF/myc/cyto (control vector) was purchased from Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA. It contains an SV40 origin of replication, the elongation factor EF1α promoter, and a Myc epitope tag coding sequence at the 3′ end of the multiple cloning site. The region of Cbfa1 that encodes the protein isoform starting with the amino acids MASNS and ending with VWRPY (Osf2Met69) (29Thirunavukkarasu K. Mahajan M. McLarren K.W. Stifani S. Karsenty G. Mol. Cell Biol. 1998; 18: 4197-4208Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was PCR amplified from pCMV5-Osf2 (obtained from Dr. Gerard Karsenty, Houston, TX) (1Ducy P. Zhang R. Geoffroy V. Ridall A.L. Karsenty G. Cell. 1997; 89: 747-754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3631) Google Scholar). The PCR product was then subcloned into the NcoI andXhoI sites of pEF/myc/cyto to generate pEF-Cbfa1. Cbfa1 is expressed from this plasmid as a fusion protein with a Myc epitope tag at the C-terminal end. The integrity of all plasmid constructs were confirmed by restriction mapping and automated DNA sequencing. The sequence of the 5.9-kb OPG promoter was analyzed for the presence of consensus transcription factor binding sites, including OSE2 (Cbfa1-binding site) and OSE2-like elements, using the GCG Wisconsin Package, Genetics Computer Group, Inc. (Madison, WI). The monkey kidney cell line COS-1 was obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC CRL 1650) and was grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Hyclone Laboratories, Logan, UT) and 2 mml-glutamine (Life Technologies, Inc.). COS1 cells were chosen for use in transient transfection studies owing to their ability to initiate replication and generate multiple copies of transfected plasmids that contain the SV40 origin of replication, eventually resulting in the synthesis of substantial amounts of the protein of interest (30Gulzman Y. Cell. 1981; 23: 175-182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1459) Google Scholar). BALC, a mouse calvaria-derived stromal/osteoblastic cell line (31John V. Hock J.M. Short L.L. Glasebrook A.L.

All cultures were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2. For Cbfa1 transactivation studies, 1 × 105 cells were plated per well in 6-well plates and incubated for 24 h. Cells were then transfected with 1 μg each of the reporter (OPG promoter constructs linked to βgal or the control reporter vector pβgal-Basic) and the effector plasmid (pEF-Cbfa1 or the control expression vector pEF/myc/cyto), using Fugene transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The constructs (1 μg each in a total volume of 20 μl in Tris-EDTA buffer, pH 8.0) were mixed with diluted Fugene reagent (194 μl of serum-free medium + 6 μl of Fugene) and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. The DNA-Fugene mix was then added dropwise to the plates, and the cells were incubated for an additional 48 h. Following transfection, the plates were washed twice with PBS (Life Technologies, Inc.) and then lysed with 100 μl of lysis buffer provided with the βgal reporter gene assay kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The cell extracts were spun down for 2 min at 14,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge to precipitate cellular debris. 20 μl of the supernatant was transferred to white opaque microtiter plates, and the βgal activity was measured as per the manufacturer's instructions, using an automated injection MLX Luminometer (Dynex Corporation, Chantilly, VA). As a positive control and to verify transfection efficiency, separate plates were transfected with a βgal expression plasmid (pβgal-Promoter,CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) that has the βgal reporter gene coding region under the control of the SV40 early promoter (referred to as SV40-βgal in the text and in Fig. 4). This was done to avoid possible squelching of factors that could arise when cotransfecting multiple plasmids (32Farr A. Roman A.

The luciferase reporter vector was not used because of our recent finding that cryptic enhancer elements in the luciferase reporter vector pGL3-Basic could mediate transactivation by Cbfa1, leading to spurious background luciferase expression (34Thirunavukkarasu K. Miles R.R. Halladay D.L. Onyia J.E. BioTechniques. 2000; 28: 506-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). All the experiments were repeated at least three times in triplicate wells, using different plasmid preparations. The βgal activity values represent the integral value of light emitted over a period of two seconds and are expressed as fold induction over basal (control vector-transfected) levels. Results were analyzed using Student's t test, and probability (p) values of less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. To analyze the effect of Cbfa1 transfection on OPG secretion, U2OS cells were plated at 1 × 105 cells/well in 6-well plates and allowed to grow for 24 h. The culture medium was then removed, cells were washed with 1× PBS (Life Technologies, Inc.) and replaced with medium containing 0.1% FBS and incubated overnight. The next morning, cells were transfected with 1 μg of either empty vector (pEF/myc/cyto) or pEF-Cbfa1 using Fugene reagent as described above. 5.5 h after transfection, the medium was removed, plates were washed with 1× PBS, and complete medium was added and incubated for 4 h. The cells were then serum-starved (in medium with 0.1% FBS) and incubated further. 48 h after transfection, the supernatant was collected, and the amount of secreted OPG was quantified in an ELISA as described below. Nuclear extracts were prepared from ROS 17/2.8 cells that were grown in 10-cm tissue culture plates, following the published protocol (35Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3916) Google Scholar). Using the same protocol, nuclear extracts were also prepared from COS1 cells that were transfected with 10 μg of empty vector (pEF/myc/cyto) or the Cbfa1 expression construct (pEF-Cbfa1) using Fugene transfection reagent and incubated for 48 h. DNA binding reactions were performed in a buffer containing 5% glycerol, 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 2 μg of poly(dI·dC)·poly(dI·dC). 5 fmol of 32P-labeled double stranded OSE2 oligonucleotides from either the osteocalcin promoter (5′-GAT CCG CTG CAA TCA CCA ACC ACA GCA-3′, OCwt) (36Ducy P.

https://openalex.org/W1980146060,"Bovine IF1, a basic protein of 84 amino acids, is involved in the regulation of the catalytic activity of the F1 domain of ATP synthase. At pH 6.5, but not at basic pH values, it inhibits the ATP hydrolase activity of the enzyme. The oligomeric state of bovine IF1 has been investigated at various pH values by sedimentation equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation and by covalent cross-linking. Both techniques confirm that the protein forms a tetramer at pH 8, and below pH 6.5, the protein is predominantly dimeric. By covalent cross-linking, it has been found that at pH 8.0 the fragment of IF1 consisting of residues 44–84 forms a dimer, whereas the fragment from residues 32–84 is tetrameric. Therefore, some or all of the residues between positions 32 and 43 are necessary for tetramer formation and are involved in the pH-sensitive interconversion between dimer and tetramer. One important residue in the interconversion is histidine 49. Mutation of this residue to lysine abolishes the pH-dependent activation-inactivation, and the mutant protein is active and dimeric at all pH values investigated. It is likely from NMR studies that the inhibitor protein dimerizes by forming an antiparallel α-helical coiled-coil over its C-terminal region and that at high pH values, where the protein is tetrameric, the inhibitory regions are masked. The mutation of histidine 49 to lysine is predicted to abolish coiled-coil formation over residues 32–43 preventing interaction between two dimers, forcing the equilibrium toward the dimeric state, thereby freeing the N-terminal inhibitory regions and allowing them to interact with F1.

Therefore, some or all of the residues between positions 32 and 43 are necessary for tetramer formation and are involved in the pH-sensitive interconversion between dimer and tetramer. One important residue in the interconversion is histidine 49. Mutation of this residue to lysine abolishes the pH-dependent activation-inactivation, and the mutant protein is active and dimeric at all pH values investigated. It is likely from NMR studies that the inhibitor protein dimerizes by forming an antiparallel α-helical coiled-coil over its C-terminal region and that at high pH values, where the protein is tetrameric, the inhibitory regions are masked. The mutation of histidine 49 to lysine is predicted to abolish coiled-coil formation over residues 32–43 preventing interaction between two dimers, forcing the equilibrium toward the dimeric state, thereby freeing the N-terminal inhibitory regions and allowing them to interact with F1. polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid The activity of the proton-pumping ATP synthase (F1F0-ATPase) found in mitochondria is regulated in vivo by ADP, a proton motive force (ΔμH+) and by a natural protein inhibitor, IF1 (1Walker J.E. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1994; 4: 912-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Decrease of ΔμH+ can reverse the action of ATP synthase, making it hydrolyze ATP and pump protons out of the organelle. ATP hydrolysis is inhibited by the inhibitor protein, IF1, which binds to ATP synthase in a 1:1 stoichiometry (2Klein G. Satre M. Dianoux A.C. Vignais P.V. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 2919-2925Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Binding depends on the presence of MgATP. Restoration of a proton motive force favoring ATP synthesis displaces IF1 from its inhibitory site and releases bound ATP, indicating that IF1 prevents product release (3Pedersen P.L. Schwerzmann K. Cintron N.M. Curr. Top. Bioenerget. 1981; 11: 149-199Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 4Penin F. Di Pietro A. Godinot C. Gautheron D.C. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8969-8974Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The binding of IF1 to ATP synthase is dependent on pH. Upon reduction of pH below neutrality, the inhibitory capacity of IF1 increases (5Panchenko M.V. Vinogradov A.D. FEBS Lett. 1985; 184: 226-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In respiring mitochondria, the pH is relatively low outside and relatively high inside the matrix where ATP is made. In the absence of oxygen or in the presence of an uncoupler of oxidative phosphorylation, ATP synthase is poised in the direction of ATP hydrolysis, and glycolysis becomes the only source of cellular ATP. The high rate of glycolysis results in reduction of cytosolic pH (6Rouslin W. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9657-9661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) which is transmitted to the mitochondrial matrix, promoting inhibition of ATP hydrolysis by IF1 in order to preserve ATP. Bovine IF1 is a basic protein 84 amino acids in length (7Pullman M.E. Monroy G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 3762-3769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and homologues have been characterized in mitochondria from rats (8Cintron N.M. Pedersen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 3439-3443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar),Saccharomyces cerevisiae (9Hashimoto T. Negawa Y. Tagawa K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1981; 90: 1151-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), and plants (10Norling B. Tourikas C. Hamsur B. Glaser E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 188: 247-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Its primary sequence is well conserved, particularly in residues 14–47 (bovine numbering) which have been defined as the minimal inhibitory sequence (11Van Raaij M.J. Orriss G.L. Montgomery M.G. Runswick M.J. Fearnley I.M. Skehel J.M. Walker J.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15618-15625Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 12Papa S. Zanotti F. Cocco T. Perrucci C. Candita C. Minuto M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 240: 461-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). At least some of the inhibitory domain lies in residues 9–22, and its C-terminal region (approximately residues 39–84) forms an intermolecular α-helical coiled-coil, possibly leading to the formation of dimers and higher oligomers (11Van Raaij M.J. Orriss G.L. Montgomery M.G. Runswick M.J. Fearnley I.M. Skehel J.M. Walker J.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15618-15625Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). By solution NMR studies of the fragment 44–84, it has been shown that dimerization is due to the formation of an anti-parallel coiled-coil. 1D. J. Gordon-Smith, R. J. Carbajo, M. J. Runswick, J. E. Walker, and D. Neuhaus, manuscript in preparation. Although reduction of pH is necessary for IF1 to bind to F1, the mechanism controlling this process has been unknown until now. It has been suggested that IF1 exists in two conformations as follows: an inactive, highly α-helical, non-inhibitory form above pH 6.7, and an active, less α-helical, inhibitory form at values below pH 6.7. Bovine IF1 contains five histidine residues that are expected to have pK a values within the regulatory range of inhibitor action, and therefore, the protonation and deprotonation of these residues have been proposed to modify the structure of IF1allowing it to interact with F1. In support, the mutation of histidine 49 to lysine in bovine IF1 (referred to as IF1-H49K) eliminates its pH sensitivity (14Schnizer R. Van Heeke G. Amaturo D. Schuster S.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1292: 241-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). As described below, the oligomeric state of bovine IF1 has been investigated by sedimentation equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation and by covalent cross-linking. Both techniques show that IF1 forms active dimers and inactive tetramers and that the oligomerization state is dependent on pH. A 12-residue segment from 32 to 43 contains amino acids that are involved in this pH-dependent interconversion between the dimer and tetramer. Protein concentrations were determined by the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) method (Pierce) or by acid hydrolysis and amino acid analysis. SDS-PAGE2 gels containing a 12–22% (w/v) acrylamide gradient separating gel and 4% (w/v) stacking gel (acrylamide:N,N-methylenebisacrylamide, 30:0.8, w/w) were cast in 10 cm × 10 cm × 0.6 mm format and run in the buffer system of Laemmli (15Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Bands were stained for 15 min in Gel Stain (50% (v/v) methanol, 7% (v/v) acetic acid, 0.2% (w/v) Page Blue 83). Samples of proteins for analytical ultracentrifugation or for the cross-linking experiments were dialyzed overnight against the required buffer (2.5 liters) in a cellulose membrane tubing with a molecular weight cut-off of 2 kDa (Spectrum Laboratories, Inc. Haverhill, UK). The expression plasmid pRKIF1 contains the coding sequence for the entire bovine IF1 (11Van Raaij M.J. Orriss G.L. Montgomery M.G. Runswick M.J. Fearnley I.M. Skehel J.M. Walker J.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15618-15625Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Plasmids expressing IF1-H49K and IF1 truncated at the N terminus by 31 residues [IF1 (residues 32–84)] were made from pRKIF1 by polymerase chain reaction using the oligonucleotide primers GAA GAA ACA CAA GGA AAA TGA GAT and TAG GAA TTC CAT ATG CGA TAC TTC CGA GCT CGT GCT AAA, respectively. The plasmid encoding the fragment [IF1 (residues 44–84)] was described earlier (11Van Raaij M.J. Orriss G.L. Montgomery M.G. Runswick M.J. Fearnley I.M. Skehel J.M. Walker J.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15618-15625Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The overexpression of IF1 and related proteins was carried out as described previously (11Van Raaij M.J. Orriss G.L. Montgomery M.G. Runswick M.J. Fearnley I.M. Skehel J.M. Walker J.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15618-15625Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) except that the host cell was Escherichia coli C41 (16Miroux B. Walker J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 289-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (1586) Google Scholar). After addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, the cells were grown overnight at 25 °C. The bacteria were centrifuged (7000 × g, 15 min, 4 °C) and resuspended in TEP buffer (150 ml), consisting of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.001% (w/v) phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. One tablet of a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, GmbH, Germany) was added at this step. Protein purifications were carried out at 4 °C. Bacterial cells containing the various proteins were broken by being passed twice through a French pressure cell. The proteins were soluble in the cytoplasmic fraction that was clarified by high speed centrifugation (142,000 × g, 1 h), except for [IF1(residues 32–84)] which formed inclusion bodies (collected by centrifugation at 45,000 × g, 40 min). The broken cell supernatants containing the proteins were dialyzed twice against TEP buffer (4 liters) using a membrane with a molecular mass cut-off of 3.5 kDa and then applied to a prepacked column of S-Sepharose HP obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech equilibrated with the same buffer. IF1, IF1-H49K, and [IF1(residues 44–84)] eluted from the column at 0.35 m on a linear gradient of 0–1 m sodium chloride in TEP buffer. The fragment [IF1 (residues 32–84)] was recovered from inclusion bodies by solubilization in 6 m guanidine HCl and 0.1 m MOPS, pH 7.0, centrifuged at 140,000 ×g for 1 h, and the supernatant dialyzed twice against TEP buffer. Insoluble protein was removed by centrifugation at 80,000 × g, 30 min. The supernatant containing IF1 (residues 32–84) was applied to a S-Sepharose column equilibrated with the same buffer and eluted at 1 m sodium chloride. In all cases, pooled fractions containing the protein were dialyzed against TEP buffer again and applied to a Q-Sepharose HP column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with the same buffer. All the proteins emerged on a linear gradient of 0–1 msodium chloride at 0.4–0.5 m but IF1 (residues 32–84) also eluted at 0.2 m. The recovery of each protein was about 80 mg per 6 liters of culture, and the proteins were stable for several months at −20 °C. Activities of recombinant bovine IF1 and IF1-H49K were assayed at various pH values for the inhibition of ATPase activity of isolated, inhibitor-free F1-ATPase (17Lutter R. Abrahams J.P. Van Raaij M.J. Todd R.J. Lundqvist T. Buchanan S.K. Leslie A.G.W. Walker J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 787-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). IF1 or IF1-H49K (0.6 μg in each case) were mixed with F1-ATPase (12 μg, 32 pmol) to give a total volume of 200 μl in 10 mm MOPS-NaOH, for pH 5.5–7.0, or 10 mm Tris-HCl, for pH 7.0–8.5. The substrate MgATP (1 μl of a neutralized 200 mm solution) was added to the mixture. After 5 min of incubation at 37 °C, the ATPase activity was estimated by transferring 10 μl of the mixture to 1 ml of ATPase assay mixture at 37 °C and by measuring the decrease in the absorbance of NADH at 340 nm for 5 min. Control activity was determined at each pH by prior incubation of F1 without inhibitor. The ATPase assay mixture contained 50 mm Tris sulfate, pH 8.0, 50 mm potassium chloride, 2 mm magnesium chloride, 1 mm EDTA, pyruvate kinase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) (20 μg/ml), lactate dehydrogenase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) (10 μg/ml), 0.2 mm NADH, 1 mmphosphoenolpyruvate, and 2 mm MgATP. Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were performed in a Beckman Optima XLA analytical ultracentrifuge, using an An-60Ti rotor, with IF1 at either pH 5.0 (in 20 mm sodium cacodylate, 0.15 m NaCl), pH 6.5 (in sodium phosphate, ionic strength 0.1 m), or pH 8.0 (in sodium phosphate, ionic strength 0.1 m). All experiments were performed at 5.0 °C and at 15,000 rpm, with scanning at 230 nm. Cells were largely filled (400-μl sample), to give data over a wide range of concentration in each cell, at a variety of initial concentrations. After an initial scan, the centrifuge was overspeeded at 22,500 rpm for 6 h, to reduce the time taken to reach equilibrium (18Van Holde K.E. Baldwin R.L. J. Phys. Chem. 1958; 62: 734-743Crossref Scopus (455) Google Scholar), and then the speed was reduced and another scan taken, followed by further scans at intervals of 24 h. When successive scans were indistinguishable, the later scan was taken as being operationally at equilibrium, and scans averaging over 100 readings were taken for analysis. Subsequently, the centrifuge was overspeeded to sediment the macromolecule away from the meniscus, before slowing to equilibrium speed and taking a further scan to establish the effective base-line absorbance for each cell. The apparent partial specific volume (φ′), used for analysis of the data, was measured from the density increment (∂ρ/∂c 2)μ by Equation1,∂ρ∂c2μ=(1−φ′ρ0)Equation 1 where ρ is the density of a solution containing a concentration (c 2) of the macromolecular component at dialysis equilibrium with all the diffusible components, and ρ0 is the solvent density. Densities for the solution and solvent were measured using an oscillating densitometer (19Kratky O. Leopold H. Stabinger H. Methods Enzymol. 1973; 27: 98-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar) (model DMA60 with a DMA602 cell; Anton Paar, Graz, Austria). The protein concentration was measured by amino acid analysis. Data were analyzed initially by taking overlapping sets of 41 data points to calculate the apparent weight average molecular mass (M̄ w,app), taken to be at the concentration of the middle point, by nonlinear regression with Equation 2(20Casassa E.F. Eisenberg H. Adv. Protein Chem. 1964; 19: 287-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar),M̄Mw,app=dln(c)dr22RTω2(1−φ′ρ0)Equation 2 where M̄ w,app is the apparent weight average molecular mass; c is the concentration (as optical density) at radius r, and ω is the angular velocity (in radians/s). Plots of M̄ w,app againstc were made, using the program Profit version 5.1.2 ppc (Quantum Soft, Zürich, Switzerland) and taking ε230= 2.52 × 106m−1. Visual inspection of these plots allowed an appropriate model to be selected for further analysis of possible aggregation, by directly fitting the absorbance against radius data (21Johnson M.L. Straume M. Schuster T.M. Laue T.M. Modern Analytical Ultracentrifugation. Birkhauser Boston, Inc., Cambridge, MA1994: 37-65Crossref Google Scholar), using Profit with the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm (with error estimates in absorbance from the recorded data), for selected models. In practice, it was found that at any given pH, IF1 was detectable only as a single oligomer, with non-ideality detectable in some cases but with no evidence for either dissociation or further association. (Clearly there must be some smaller oligomers, but these could not be detected and the dissociation constant (K d) fell to the lower limit even when this was set far below the values measurable in the data.) Therefore, the fitting presented is entirely consistent with the equation for a non-ideal single species. Taking Equation 3 for a non-ideal solute (20Casassa E.F. Eisenberg H. Adv. Protein Chem. 1964; 19: 287-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar, 22Eisenberg H. Biological Macromolecules and Polyelectrolytes in Solution. Clarendon Press, Oxford1976Google Scholar) (assuming that only the second viral coefficient need be considered),(1+2Bc2,r)c2,rdc2,r=M(1−φ′ρ0)RTrdrEquation 3 which leads to c 2,r =c 2,0 exp(ς(r2 −r 02) − 2B(c 2,r −c 2,0)) (Eq. 4); where ς = (M(1 − φ′ρ0)ω2)/2RT, B is the molar second viral coefficient (inm−1);c 2,r is the molar concentration of component 2 (i.e. the macromolecule) at radius r,and M is the “monomer.” This expression can be fitted to data by evaluatingc 2,r against r and then converting to OD by A r = ε230 c 2,r. Since Equation 4 is transcendental (i.e. c 2,rappears on both sides), it was evaluated numerically for each radius, by fitting c 2,r successively until the change was less than 10−5 of the final value. (The reference radius (r 0) was taken two-thirds down the column, and the reference concentration (c 2,0) was evaluated here.) Fitting was carried out with parameters for error in both the base line and the value for M, with this latter value effectively correcting for error in φ′ or ρ0 (21Johnson M.L. Straume M. Schuster T.M. Laue T.M. Modern Analytical Ultracentrifugation. Birkhauser Boston, Inc., Cambridge, MA1994: 37-65Crossref Google Scholar) as well as B. Residuals were plotted against radius, to assess the goodness of fit and, particularly, to see any systematic deviation rather than random error due to the data. Theoretical curves forM̄ w,app against c 2were also plotted onto the experimental plots, using the fitted parameters, so that the fit could be seen. Cross-linking of amino groups in IF1, IF1-H49K, and fragments of IF1 with dimethyl suberimidate was carried out essentially according to Davis and Stark (23Davies G.E. Stark G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1970; 66: 651-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). The samples were dissolved at a protein concentration (determined by BCA method) of about 0.5 mg/ml in 20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 0.001% phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and dialyzed overnight against the same buffer. Then the protein concentration was adjusted to 0.1 mg/ml by dilution with dialysis buffer, and dimethyl suberimidate (freshly dissolved at 20 mg/ml in the same buffer) was added to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml. The mixture was kept for 3 h at room temperature. Samples (10 μl) were removed at various times, dissolved in sample buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. At the protein concentration used, the maximal inhibitory effect of IF1was at pH 6.5, with decreased effects at both higher and lower values (see Fig. 1). At pH 8.0, F1was 45% active. In contrast, the inhibitory effect of IF1-H49K was clearly independent of pH confirming earlier work (14Schnizer R. Van Heeke G. Amaturo D. Schuster S.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1292: 241-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), and at pH 8.0, 98% of the activity of F1 was inhibited. At lower concentrations of IF1, higher activities of F1-ATPase were observed, but at all F1 concentrations investigated, the pattern of response of inhibition by IF1 to pH was similar (data not shown). Density measurements were carried out at 5 °C on both the solvent (ρ0) and solutions of IF1, at dialysis equilibrium with this solvent, in buffers at pH values 5.0, 6.5, and 8.0. Protein concentrations were also determined by acid hydrolysis and amino acid analysis of replicate samples of each protein solution. From these values, the density increment ((∂ρ/∂c 2)μ) for IF1 at each pH was calculated and hence the apparent partial specific volume (φ′). These values (TableI) were used for all calculations from the analytical ultracentrifuge data.Table IApparent partial specific volume and solvent density of bovine IF1 at various pH valuespHρ0Δρc2(∂ρ/∂c2)μφ′g/mlmg/mlmg/mlml/g5.01.0021283.42214.320.2390.7596.51.0015272.51010.800.2320.7668.01.0009576.17925.800.2390.760 Open table in a new tab Sedimentation equilibrium experiments with IF1 were carried out at 5 °C and pH values 5.0, 6.5, and 8.0. Typical plots of the apparent weight average molecular mass M̄ w,app against concentration (with data from several cells loaded at different concentrations superimposed), at each pH, are shown in Fig.2. Also shown are typical plots of the residuals (against radius) for fitting the original centrifuge data with a model for a non-ideal “monomer.” In practice, this “monomer” was taken to be a dimer of IF1 at pH 5.0 and a tetramer of IF1 at pH values 6.5 and 8.0, in keeping with the obvious values of M̄ w,app in the direct plots. Plots of the residuals (Fig. 2) show that such models give a good agreement to the data, with no evidence for either association or dissociation of the dominant oligomer. At both pH 5.0 and 6.5 the best fit was obtained with some non-ideality, giving estimates forB of 5.4(±1) × 104 and 2.2(±1) × 105m−1, respectively (concentrations expressed as true monomer), and B was fit as zero (i.e. no non-ideality) at pH 8.0. Calculated lines forM̄ w,app against concentration have been drawn onto each of the experimental figures to show the fit given with the fitted parameters. Attempts were also made to fit the data with models for a monomer/dimer equilibrium (with or without non-ideality), but in every case the dissociation constant (K d) fell to the limit during the fitting, even when this was set well below the smallest value that would be detectable with this optical system. Therefore, IF1 forms a dimer at pH 5.0. At pH 6.5 dimers and tetramers are in equilibrium, and at pH 8 the predominant form is the tetramer. Moreover, dissociation into monomers is very low, and although there must be some lower oligomers present, in equilibrium with these dominant forms, they must be at such low concentrations as not to affect the apparent mass at the experimental concentrations. Similarly, aggregation of the dimer at pH 5.0 must be very slight at these concentrations, as again it does not show in the apparent mass. In view of the change in aggregation state observed between conditions where the inhibitor is active and inactive, the aggregation state of IF1-H49K, which does not show the pH-dependent interconversion, was investigated. Similar plots to those for IF1 were obtained (Fig. 3). They were calculated assuming the same apparent partial specific volume as IF1. The protein appears to be a dimer at all three pH values, with the residuals for fitting the model of a non-ideal “monomer” again reasonably distributed around zero. However, in this case, B was fit as zero in each case, i.e. there was no evidence for any non-ideality. The oligomeric states of both IF1 and IF1-H49K were examined at pH 8.0 by covalent cross-linking with dimethyl suberimidate. The products from IF1 (see Fig. 4) contain the monomer, dimer, trimer, and tetramer. Tetramer formation reached a plateau after 2 h. In contrast, only dimers were observed with IF1-H49K. Therefore, at pH 8.0 IF1 forms tetramers and IF1-H49K forms dimers. The C-terminal region of IF1 has been proposed to be involved in α-helical coiled-coil formation (11Van Raaij M.J. Orriss G.L. Montgomery M.G. Runswick M.J. Fearnley I.M. Skehel J.M. Walker J.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15618-15625Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Therefore, the oligomerization states of two fragments consisting of residues 44–84 and 32–84 were examined. Dimer formation without tetramer was observed for the former and both tetramer and dimer for the latter (see Fig. 4). Therefore, residues in the region from 32 to 43 are necessary for both tetramer formation and the pH-dependent interconversion between dimer and tetramer. A fragment of bovine IF1 consisting of residues 44–84 forms a symmetrical dimer of antiparallel α-helical coiled-coils,1 and it is likely that dimerization of intact IF1 occurs in a similar way. The region in IF1 involved in the coiled-coil is predicted to extend from residues 37 to 84, whereas in IF1-H49K the coiled-coil region is predicted to be shorter involving only residues 47–84 (see Fig. 5). The loss of coiled-coil structure in IF1-H49K in this region could thus prevent tetramer formation and, therefore, maintain the protein as an active dimer from pH 5.0 to pH 8.0. This conclusion is further supported by the observations that IF1-H49K, where the lysine residue will be fully protonated, is dimeric and active at all the pH values tested. The protonation-deprotonation of histidine 49 in IF1 could change the extent of coiled-coil formation thereby affecting both oligomerization and activity of the protein in a pH-dependent manner. These results suggest a model to explain the mechanism of action of IF1 depicted in Fig. 6. At a pH of about 6.5 (Fig. 6 A), IF1 forms an active dimer in which its N-terminal inhibitory domain is exposed and is capable of interacting with the F1 domain of ATP synthase. Activation is accompanied by a decrease in IF1 helicity relative to the inactive form between residues 35 and 47 which are involved in the formation of a dimer of dimers, the inactive form (Fig.6 B). This region immediately precedes histidine 49, and so it is possible that protonation of this residue leads to the loss of helicity in this area as predicted by the MULTICOIL program (see Fig.5). The loss of the coiled-coil structure in this region would prevent the interaction between the two dimers forcing the equilibrium from tetramers to dimers, freeing the inhibitory regions to interact with F1. An important implication of this model is that dimeric IF1is capable of binding to two F1 domains simultaneously. Dimeric F1F0 complexes have been detected by native gel electrophoresis in mild detergent (24Schagger H. Pfeiffer K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1777-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar). This dimerization has been suggested to involve subunits e, g, and k in yeast (25Arnold I. Pfeiffer K. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. Schagger H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7170-7178Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Whether it could also involve IF1 remains to be investigated. A number of other issues surrounding the action of IF1remain to be elucidated. One such issue is where is the unbound tetrameric IF1 in the mitochondrion? It has been suggested that it might bind to an unidentified protein, not part of F1F0, in the inner membrane (26Lopez-Mediavilla C. Vigny H. Godinot C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; : 215Google Scholar). Other important issues are what is the atomic structure of IF1 in its dimeric and tetrameric states and where is the binding site of dimeric IF1 in the F1 domain? Solution NMR studies are helping to unravel the structure of the dimer,1and knowledge of the oligomerization process should help in the crystallization of IF1 and in the elucidation of the structure of the IF1-F1 complex.

https://openalex.org/W1969054288,"Most voltage-gated Na+ channels inactivate almost completely at depolarized membrane potentials, but in some cells a residual Na+ current is seen that is resistant to inactivation. This persistent Na+ current can have a profound impact on the electrical behavior of excitable cells, and the regulation of this property could have important biological consequences. However, the biological signaling mechanisms that regulate the persistence of Na+ channels are not well understood. This study showed that in nerve terminals and ventricular myocytes nitric oxide (NO) reduced the inactivation of Na+current. This effect was independent of cGMP, was blocked byN-ethylmaleimide, and could be elicited in cell-free outside-out patches. Thus, a reactive nitrogen species acts directly on the channel or closely associated protein. Persistent Na+current could also be induced by endogenous NO generated enzymatically by NO synthase (NOS). Application of ionomycin to raise the intracellular Ca2+ concentration in myocytes activated NOS. The NO produced in response to ionomycin was detected with an NO-sensitive fluorescent dye. Persistent Na+ current was enhanced by the same treatment, and NOS inhibitors abolished both the elevation of NO and the induction of persistent Na+current. These experiments show that NO is a potential endogenous regulator of persistent Na+ current under physiological and pathophysiological conditions. Most voltage-gated Na+ channels inactivate almost completely at depolarized membrane potentials, but in some cells a residual Na+ current is seen that is resistant to inactivation.

This effect was independent of cGMP, was blocked byN-ethylmaleimide, and could be elicited in cell-free outside-out patches. Thus, a reactive nitrogen species acts directly on the channel or closely associated protein. Persistent Na+current could also be induced by endogenous NO generated enzymatically by NO synthase (NOS). Application of ionomycin to raise the intracellular Ca2+ concentration in myocytes activated NOS. The NO produced in response to ionomycin was detected with an NO-sensitive fluorescent dye. Persistent Na+ current was enhanced by the same treatment, and NOS inhibitors abolished both the elevation of NO and the induction of persistent Na+current. These experiments show that NO is a potential endogenous regulator of persistent Na+ current under physiological and pathophysiological conditions. nitric-oxide synthase sodium nitroprusside diaminofluorescein N-ethylmaleimide 7-nitroindazole According to the classical Hodgkin-Huxley model, Na+channels inactivate within a few milliseconds after being activated by a depolarizing voltage step. This together with the opening of K+ channels leads to rapid membrane repolarization to terminate an action potential. However, many excitable tissues have a component of Na+ current that is resistant to inactivation. This “persistent” Na+ current is believed to play important roles in the integration of synaptic inputs (1Crill W.E. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1996; 58: 349-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar, 2Raman I.M. Bean B.P. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 4517-4526Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the generation of rhythmic oscillations (1Crill W.E. Annu. Rev.

NO donors have recently been shown to increase persistent Na+current in posterior pituitary nerve terminals (8Ahern G.P. Hsu S.-F. Jackson M.B. Soc. Neurosci. Abstr. 1998; 24: 427.9Google Scholar) and hippocampal neurons (9Hammarstrom A.K.M. Gage P.W. J. Physiol. 1999; 520: 451-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). NO levels rise following Ca2+ overload and ischemia, and Na+ current persistence is enhanced by hypoxia (10Hammarstrom A.K. Gage P.W. J. Physiol. 1998; 510: 735-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Because these conditions promote arrhythmias and seizures, it is possible that NO-induced Na+ channel persistence is involved. The action of NO on Na+ channels is through a direct chemical reaction with a protein thiol (8Ahern G.P. Hsu S.-F. Jackson M.B. Soc. Neurosci. Abstr. 1998; 24: 427.9Google Scholar, 9Hammarstrom A.K.M. Gage P.W. J. Physiol. 1999; 520: 451-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). NO has been shown to modulate a number of other ion channels by this mechanism (11Bolotina V.M. Najibi S. Palacino J.J. Pagano P.J. Cohen R.A. Nature. 1994; 368: 850-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (1514) Google Scholar, 12Broillet M.C. Firestein S.

However, little evidence has been presented that endogenous NO can initiate this process. Indeed, since the proposal that NO can modify protein thiols (15Stammler J.S. Simon D.I. Osborne J.A. Mullins M.E. Jaraki O. Michel T. Singel D.J. Loscalzo J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 444-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (1311) Google Scholar), an important question has been the extent to which this represents a biological route for the modulation of function. In the case of Ca2+-activated K+ channels in vascular smooth muscle, acetylcholine was shown to mimic the effect of NO (11Bolotina V.M. Najibi S. Palacino J.J. Pagano P.J. Cohen R.A. Nature. 1994; 368: 850-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (1514) Google Scholar). Here we show that NO induces persistent Na+currents in ventricular myocytes and neurohypophysial nerve terminals. We further show that endogenous NO production can be stimulated in myocytes by Ca2+ loading. This induces persistent Na+ current similar to that produced by exogenous NO application. Both rises in cellular NO and modulation of Na+ channels were blocked by inhibitors of nitric-oxide synthase (NOS).1 Thus, endogenously generated NO can induce persistent Na+current. These findings suggest that NO is a potential physiological regulator of Na+ channel persistence, and this is likely to have important consequences for the regulation of cellular excitability. Posterior pituitary slices were prepared from male Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats (200–300 g) as described previously (16Jackson M.B. Konnerth A. Augustine G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 380-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Slices were maintained in 95% O2/5% CO2-saturated artificial cerebrospinal fluid containing 125 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 26 mm NaHCO3, 1.25 mm NaH2PO4, 2 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm glucose. Adult rat ventricular myocytes were isolated enzymatically by perfusion of the heart with Ca2+-free Ringer's solution containing collagenase (1 mg/ml) and hyaluronidase (0.4 mg/ml), as described previously (17Huang X.P. Pi Y. Lokuta A.J. Greaser M.L. Walker J.W. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1625-1634PubMed Google Scholar). Voltage clamp recordings were made using standard patch clamp methods (18Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15174) Google Scholar). Patch pipettes with resistances between 2 and 3 MΩ were prepared from borosilicate or aluminosilicate glass (Garner Glass, Claremont, CA). Series resistance compensation was routinely set at 50–70%. Leak conductance was subtracted using a P/4 protocol. In nerve terminals, voltage errors due toR s were as high as 3 mV at peak Na+current (∼1–2 nA). In myocytes, the peak currents were subject to significant R s errors, but persistent current was measured at the end of a 100–200 ms depolarizing pulse (in nerve terminals as well as myocytes). These final currents were always <500 pA, so that R s errors were generally ∼1 mV or less when persistent Na+ current was measured. In nerve terminals, the bathing solution contained 121 mmNaCl, 20 mm tetraethylammonium, 10 mmHEPES, 10 mm glucose, 4 mm CsCl, 2 mm 4-aminopyridine, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 0.2 mmCdCl2. The pipette solution contained 120 mmKCl or CsCl, 10 mm NaCl, 10 mmtetraethylammonium, 10 mm HEPES, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgATP, and 0.1 mm GTP, pH 7.3. For excised, outside-out patch recording from nerve terminals, the bath contained artificial cerebrospinal fluid solution, and the pipette solution was as above with 120 mm CsCl. For myocyte patch clamp recording, the bathing solution contained 130 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, 5 mm KCl, 5 mm CsCl, 5 mm CoCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4, and the pipette solution contained 130 mm cesium gluconate, 10 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, 13 mmtetraethylammonium, 10 mm EGTA, and 4 mm MgATP, pH 7.4. Either 1 or 4 mm dipotassium nitrosylpentachlororuthenate (K2RuCl5NO; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) or 2 mm sodium nitroprusside (SNP; Sigma) were used as caged NO. Each was included in the pipette solution. After establishment of a whole terminal recording, at least 2–3 min were allowed for diffusion of caged NO into the nerve terminal prior to photolysis. The preparation was illuminated with a 75 W Xe arc lamp (Optiquip, Highland Mills, NY) gated by an electromechanical shutter. We have previously calibrated the photolytic efficiency of this system by measuring the light-induced increase in the fluorescence of caged fluorescein (fluorescein bis-(5-carboxymethoxy-2-nitrobenzyl) ether) (14Ahern G.P. Hsu S.F. Jackson M.B. J. Physiol. 1999; 520: 165-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). From these experiments we have estimated that one light flash will convert ∼2% of the K2RuCl5NO to free NO. With 4 mm K2RuCl5NO, we estimate that five flashes of light in rapid succession (our typical illumination protocol) will produce [NO] ≤ 400 μm. For fluorometric monitoring of NO rises, cells were preloaded with diaminofluorescein (19Kojimi H. Nakatsubo N. Kikuchi K. Kawahara S. Kirino Y. Nagoshi H. Hirata Y. Nagano T. Anal. Chem. 1998; 70: 2446-2453Crossref PubMed Scopus (1188) Google Scholar) (DAF-2; Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) by incubating in 5 μm DAF-2-DA (the diacetyl ester) for 20 min. Fluorescence was measured from single cells with a Deltascan spectrofluorometer (Photon Technology, Int., South Brunswick, NJ) coupled to a Reichert Jung Diastar microscope (Leica, Deerfield, IL). The excitation light was tuned to 488 nm and reflected onto the preparation by a 515-nm dichroic mirror. Emitted light was passed through a 550 ± 25-nm bandpass filter, measured with a photomultiplier tube and read into a computer. Parallel runs were performed on DAF-2-loaded cells on a Bio-Rad 1024 confocal microscope. All other drugs and reagents were obtained from Sigma/RBI. All values are expressed as the means ± S.E. Statistical significance was evaluated using a two-tailed Student's t test. Na+ currents were recorded in the nerve terminals of the posterior pituitary and in ventricular myocytes. Under control conditions, depolarizing pulses evoked a transient current, and after the transient phase ended there was little current detectable above base line. After NO treatment, inactivation was incomplete; the transient Na+ current was followed by a persistent Na+ current (Fig. 1,A and B). A further increase in persistent current (up to ∼10% of peak current) could then be elicited by additional NO treatment (Fig. 1 B), and no recovery was evident for the duration of the recording (∼20 min). The persistent current inactivated only slightly during the course of a 200-ms pulse (Fig. 1 B) but deactivated rapidly upon repolarization to −80 mV. NO had similar effects in all nerve terminals (n = 15) and myocytes (n = 29) tested, with a mean persistent current density of 26.1 ± 2.6 pA/pF and 5.3 ± 0.3 pA/pF, respectively, elicited by photolysis of SNP (Fig. 2 B). The UV light used to release NO had no effect on its own. Further, no effects of photolysis were observed when the caged NO solution was exposed to light prior to recording, presumably because prior illumination photolyzed the caged NO. Because NO itself has a short lifetime in the presence of oxygen it decomposed prior to patch recording. Whole terminal recording and illumination with these solutions showed no persistent Na+ current, ruling out a nonspecific action of UV light and uncaging byproducts. Persistent Na+ current was also induced in cardiac myocytes by the NO donor, diethylamine NONOate (1–2 mm, n = 4; Fig.2 B). In addition, NO did not alter the membrane current evoked by small subthreshold voltage pulses, ruling out an effect on leak conductance.Figure 2Persistent Na+ current was activated by different forms of NO application and blocked by NEM.A, the sulfhydryl alkylating reagent NEM (5 mm, 3 min) reduced the effect of NO in myocytes (photolysis of SNP). Current was activated by 200-ms voltage pulses from −95 to −35 mV.B, summary of NO activation of persistent Na+current in nerve terminals and myocytes. Currents were evoked by pulses from −120 to −20 mV (100 ms) in terminals and as stated above in myocytes. NO was applied by photolysis of K2RuCl5NO (p < 0.001) and SNP (p < 0.001) and by addition of diethylamine NONOate (DEA-NO, 1–2 mm, p < 0.001). Pretreatment with NEM (5 mm) prevented the persistent Na+ current caused by NO (photolysis of SNP) in a time-dependent manner (<5 min, p < 0.001; >10 min, p < 0.001; number of experiments in parentheses above each bar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Both the persistent and transient components of current varied with voltage in the manner expected for current through channels selective for Na+. Fig. 1 C shows the current-voltage plots from the same experiment shown in Fig. 1 A. Both the transient and persistent currents extrapolate to a reversal potential of 65 mV, which is very close to the Na+ Nernst potential calculated for the solutions used in these experiments (E Na = 69 mV). Fig. 1 E shows that steady-state inactivation was incomplete in NO-modified channels, with ∼6% of the maximal current remaining at positive potentials. Plots of the voltage dependence of Na+ conductance (Na+ current divided by V −E Na; Fig. 1 D) show that the NO-modified transient current and the persistent current were shifted to the left (negative) by 3 and 11 mV, respectively, relative to the control transient current. These negative shifts are an important hallmark of persistent Na+ current described in many preparations (20French C.R. Sah P. Buckett K.J. Gage P.W. J. Gen. Physiol. 1990; 95: 1139-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Given the unusually high threshold of pituitary Na+ channels (21Jackson M.B. Zhang S.J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1995; 483: 597-611Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar), this shift would make nerve terminals much more sensitive to small depolarizations. NO is known to bind soluble guanylate cyclase and stimulate production of cGMP (22Garthwaite J. Boulton C.L. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 683-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar), but NO still induced a persistent Na+ current in nerve terminals treated with the guanylate cyclase inhibitor 6-(phenylamino)-5,8-quinolinedione (20 μm,n = 4). In contrast, pretreatment with the sulfhydryl-alkylating reagent, N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), inhibited NO activation of persistent current in cardiac myocytes (Fig.2, A and B). This suggests that the ultimate target of NO is a protein thiol, and this is consistent with the finding that the reducing agent dithiothreitol reverses NO-induction of persistent Na+ current in hippocampal neurons (9Hammarstrom A.K.M. Gage P.W. J. Physiol. 1999; 520: 451-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). When NO was applied to excised outside-out patches from nerve terminals, Na+ channels became resistant to inactivation. In control experiments almost no Na+ channel activity could be seen >20 ms after the start of a depolarizing pulse. After NO was applied, channel activity was high for the duration of the 50-ms pulse (Fig. 3 A). Moreover, after NO application, sustained bursts of tetrodotoxin-sensitive Na+ channel activity could be seen when patches were held at potentials more positive than −60 mV (Fig. 3 B). NO treatment produced a significant increase in channel open probability well after control Na+ current inactivated (Fig.3 C). The single-channel conductance of Na+channels was not altered by NO. A plot of single-channel currentversus voltage gave a conductance of 18 pS for NO-modified Na+ channels and data for control Na+ channels superimposed along this line (Fig. 3 D). The activation of persistent Na+ current in excised cell-free patches occurs in the absence of cGMP and further argues against a role for this second messenger. This finding together with the occlusion of this current by NEM in whole cell recordings (Fig. 2 B) is consistent with a direct action of NO at a thiol group on either Na+ channels themselves or on a closely associated membrane protein. These results show that exogenously applied NO can activate persistent Na+ current. However, whether this signaling pathway plays a role under physiological conditions is unclear, because the NO levels achieved by these exogenous NO application methods may not be physiologically relevant. To address this issue we tested whether persistent Na+ current could be induced by endogenous NO production. To stimulate Ca2+-dependent NOS activity in myocytes, we used the Ca2+ ionophore, ionomycin, which has previously been shown to stimulate NO production in vascular smooth muscle (23Wang Y. Shin W.S. Kawaguchi H. Inukai M. Kato M. Sakamoto A. Uehara Y. Miyamoto M. Shimamoto N. Korenaga R. Ando J. Toyo-oka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5647-5655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Using the NO-sensitive fluorophore, DAF-2 (19Kojimi H. Nakatsubo N. Kikuchi K. Kawahara S. Kirino Y. Nagoshi H. Hirata Y. Nagano T. Anal. Chem. 1998; 70: 2446-2453Crossref PubMed Scopus (1188) Google Scholar), we found that ionomycin increased NO production in myocytes. Fluorescence images produced by a confocal microscope showed that fluorescence intensity increased with time after ionomycin application and became very bright after 15 min. Fluorescence intensity averaged from several experiments was plotted to show the time course of this effect (Fig. 4 B,triangles). The fluorescence in control untreated cells was relatively stable (Fig. 4 B, circles). Thus, ionomycin produced a marked increase in NO synthesis beginning shortly following its addition. This increase in NO production was completely inhibited by pretreatment with the NOS inhibitor 7-nitroindazole (7-NI) (Fig. 4 B, squares). The average fluorescence values were plotted for control, ionomycin, and ionomycin + 7-NI in Fig. 4 C and show that ionomycin produces an ∼7-fold increase in DAF-2 fluorescence after 25 min. The change induced by ionomycin was statistically significant, whereas the plot obtained for ionomycin application to 7-NI-treated cells was flat and statistically indistinguishable from the control plot. These experiments demonstrated that treating ventricular myocytes with ionomycin increases cellular Ca2+ to a level sufficient to activate NOS. The enhancement in NOS activity raises NO concentrations to levels that are readily detectable with DAF-2. Because ionomycin treatment is an effective means of stimulating NOS, we used this method to determine whether endogenous NO can modify the activity of Na+ channels in the same way as exogenous NO. Myocytes were treated with ionomycin as in Fig. 4 and voltage clamped 15–30 min later. After ionomycin treatment myocytes exhibited a ∼3-fold increase (n = 22, p < 0.001) in persistent Na+ current (measured at the end of a 200-ms pulse) compared with control cells (n = 29), and this increase was inhibited by pretreatment with 7-NI to inhibit NOS (Fig.5). Similar results were obtained with another NOS inhibitor S-ethylisothiourea, and these results are summarized in Fig. 5 B. 7-NI andS-ethylisothiourea failed to alter persistent Na+ current on their own (Fig. 5 B). Thus, production of NO enzymatically by NOS within ventricular myocytes can induce persistent Na+ current. This study has shown that NO modifies the activity of voltage-gated Na+ channels in posterior pituitary nerve terminals and ventricular myocytes. This modification leads to the appearance of a persistent Na+ current that fails to inactivate completely at depolarized membrane potentials. These two cell types, peptidergic nerve terminals and heart muscle, normally express large transient Na+ currents with little if any persistence. Application of NO either by the addition of NO donors or photolysis of caged NO induced the appearance of persistent Na+ currents. NO donors have also been shown to increase persistent Na+ current in hippocampal neurons (9Hammarstrom A.K.M. Gage P.W. J. Physiol. 1999; 520: 451-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), suggesting that this represents a general mechanism by which NO can modify electrical excitability. Activation of persistent Na+ current was independent of guanylate cyclase and was blocked by NEM treatment. Furthermore, NO produced the same modification of channel behavior in excised patches. These results suggest that a reactive nitrogen species interacts directly with the Na+ channel or with a closely associated membrane protein. Several other channels are thought to be modulated by NO in the same way, including Ca2+-activated K+channels (11Bolotina V.M. Najibi S. Palacino J.J. Pagano P.J. Cohen R.A. Nature. 1994; 368: 850-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (1514) Google Scholar, 14Ahern G.P. Hsu S.F. Jackson M.B. J. Physiol. 1999; 520: 165-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), cyclic nucleotide-gated channels (12Broillet M.C. Firestein S. Neuron. 1996; 16: 377-385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), and ryanodine receptors (13Xu L. Eu J.P. Meissner G. Stamler J.S. Science. 1998; 279: 234-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar). NO is thus capable of modulating the activity of a number of ion channels, apparently through chemical modification of a protein thiol. As the number of putative non-heme, S-nitrosylation targets of NO expands (15Stammler J.S. Simon D.I. Osborne J.A. Mullins M.E. Jaraki O. Michel T. Singel D.J. Loscalzo J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 444-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (1311) Google Scholar), the question of physiological relevance increases in importance. In the case of NO modification of the Ca2+-activated K+ channel of vascular smooth muscle, it was shown that acetylcholine mimicked the action of exogenous NO (11Bolotina V.M. Najibi S. Palacino J.J. Pagano P.J. Cohen R.A. Nature. 1994; 368: 850-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (1514) Google Scholar), but the transduction pathway employed by acetylcholine to induce this effect was not clear. We stimulated NOS in cardiac myocytes by using ionomycin to elevate cytoplasmic Ca2+. This produced a concomitant increase in the amplitude of persistent Na+ current. Both the NO rise and the modulation of Na+ channels were prevented by inhibitors of NOS. This experiment demonstrated that endogenous NO generated within a cell can modify the ion channels within its own plasma membrane. Thus, NO induction of persistent Na+ current can serve in physiological pathways for the modulation of membrane excitability. Constitutive NOS is a Ca2+/calmodulin activated enzyme found in neurons and muscle. In these excitable cells, NO induction of persistent Na+ current is likely to play an important role in regulating electrical activity. Altered inactivation behavior contributes to resurgent Na+ current, which has been shown to alter the capacity of synaptic inputs to generate action potentials (2Raman I.M. Bean B.P. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 4517-4526Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Persistent Na+ current generates voltage oscillations in cerebellar Purkinje cells (3Llinas R. Sugimori M. J. Physiol. 1980; 305: 171-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). Exogenous NO can also generate voltage oscillations in pituitary nerve terminals by inducing persistent Na+, and this action would allow NO to act as a secretogogue (8Ahern G.P. Hsu S.-F. Jackson M.B. Soc. Neurosci. Abstr. 1998; 24: 427.9Google Scholar). Modification of Na+ channels in nerve terminals can have a profound impact on presynaptic action potential shape, and this will dramatically alter Ca2+ entry and transmitter release (16Jackson M.B. Konnerth A. Augustine G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 380-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The induction of persistent Na+current in synaptic nerve terminals could thus underlie some of the effects of NO on synaptic transmission and synaptic plasticity (22Garthwaite J. Boulton C.L. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 683-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar). Constitutive NOS is linked to the cytoplasmic peripheral membrane protein syntrophin, as are brain and muscle Na+ channels (24Gee S.H. Madhavan R. Levinson S.R. Caldwell J.H. Sealock R. Froehner S.C. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 128-137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These interactions could bring NOS and Na+ channels into close proximity. Because NO is a labile signaling molecule, its production in close proximity to Na+ channels provides a potentially important mechanism for a selective action on this target. Cytoplasmic Ca2+ signals vary both spatially and temporally, and these variations can influence the signaling pathways that are activated (25Augustine G.J. Neher E. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1992; 2: 302-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 26Gu X. Spitzer N.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 784-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). Spatial variations in Ca2+could determine the location where NO rises, and if channels are segregated, this will determine which channel types are modified. This form of ion channel modulation is likely to be activated during physiological and pathological conditions associated with elevated intracellular Ca2+. Variations in persistent Na+ current would have profound consequences for the spike patterns elicited by excitatory synaptic inputs (2Raman I.M. Bean B.P. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 4517-4526Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), as well as spontaneous rhythmic activity in neurons (1Crill W.E. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1996; 58: 349-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). Such a mechanism may explain the fact that elevated Ca2+, NO levels, and persistent Na+ current are found in the heart following hypoxia (6Ju Y.K. Saint D.A. Gage P.W. J. Physiol. 1996; 497: 337-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 27Ravens U. Himmel H.M. Pharmacol. Rev. 1999; 39: 167-174Google Scholar, 28Theroux P. Am. J.

Whereas further analysis of the AUC data imply that SLAM could form “head to head” dimers spanning adjacent cells, the very low affinity raises important questions regarding the physiological role and/or properties of such interactions.

However, we also establish a new theoretical treatment of surface plasmon resonance-derived homophilic binding data, which indicates that SLAM-SLAM interactions (solution K d ∼200 μm) are in fact considerably weaker than most other well characterized protein-protein interactions at the cell surface (solution K d ∼0.4–20 μm), a conclusion that is supported by the AUC analysis. Whereas further analysis of the AUC data imply that SLAM could form “head to head” dimers spanning adjacent cells, the very low affinity raises important questions regarding the physiological role and/or properties of such interactions. immunoglobulin superfamily signaling lymphocytic activating molecule monoclonal antibody soluble SLAM response unit(s) biotinylated sSLAM analytical ultracentrifugation domains 3 and 4 of rat CD4 human surface plasmon resonance Svedbergs Transient, low affinity interactions between the proteins present on the surfaces of leukocytes or other cell types are critical for the normal functioning of the immune system (1van der Merwe P.A. Barclay A.N. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 354-358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Among the best characterized interactions of this type are those mediated by the CD2 subset of the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF)1 (2Davis S.J. van der Merwe P.A. Immunol. Today. 1996; 17: 177-187Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 3Davis S.J. Ikemizu S. Wild M.K. van der Merwe P.A. Immunol. Rev. 1998; 163: 217-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Proteins in this subset are characterized by the presence of paired membrane-distal V set and membrane-proximal C2 set IgSF domains with distinctive disulphide bond arrangements (4Killeen N. Moessner R. Arvieux J. Willis A. Williams A.F. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3087-3091Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and the subset now includes CD2, CD58, CD48, 2B4, SLAM (CDw150), CD84, and Ly-9. It is postulated that the CD2 subset arose via successive duplications of a common ancestral gene originally encoding a homophilic cell adhesion molecule (5Wong Y.W. Williams A.F. Kingsmore S.F. Seldin M.F. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 171: 2115-2130Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In addition to sequence and structural relationships, this proposal is supported by the fact that many of the genes encoding these molecules are clustered at two duplicated loci in humans and mice and that most, if not all, of the interactions of these proteins are restricted to one or more members of the CD2 subset (6Brown M.H.

Substantial overlap in the ligand binding specificities and signaling properties of these molecules further underscores their close evolutionary history. For example, murine CD2 and 2B4 both bind CD48 (6Brown M.H. Boles K. van der Merwe P.A. Kumar V. Mathew P.A. Barclay A.N. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 2083-2090Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar), the cytoplasmic domains of 2B4 and SLAM each bind an adaptor signaling protein known as SLAM-associated protein (8Sayos J. Wu C.

Finally, rat and human soluble (s) CD2 crystals are dominated by homophilic head to head crystal lattice contacts proposed (12Jones E.Y. Davis S.J. Williams A.F. Harlos K. Stuart D.I.

Previously, however, there has been no clear evidence that any homophilic interactions of potential physiological significance occur among the existing members of this subset of the IgSF. SLAM was initially identified with a monoclonal antibody (mAb) that activated T-cells and bound a previously uncharacterized activation antigen (11Cocks B.G. Chang C.C. Carballido J.M.

The prevailing view of the function of SLAM is that it is homophilic and that through bidirectional signaling it regulates T- and B-cell responses (8Sayos J. Wu C. Morra M. Wang N. Zhang X.

Preliminary data implying that the affinity might be as high as 1010m−1 (15Punnonen J. Cocks B.G. Carballido J.M. Bennett B. Peterson D. Aversa G. de Vries J.E. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 993-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) argue against a role in T-cell-B-cell interactions, however, since protein contacts in this context generally have much lower affinities, presumably to ensure that such interactions are readily reversible (1van der Merwe P.A. Barclay A.N. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 354-358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). To resolve this issue, we have characterized the self-association of soluble (s) forms of SLAM using SPR-based methods and analytical ultracentrifugation. This analysis, for which a new theoretical framework for characterizing homophilic protein-protein interactions using SPR-based methods had to be established, indicates that SLAM self-associates with an affinity much lower than was previously anticipated. mAbs used were: SLAM mAbs IPO-3 (16Sidorenko S.P.

The OX mAbs are referenced in the European Collection of Animal Cell Cultures. IgG FITC goat anti-mouse was supplied by Serotec (Kidlington, UK). Vectors for expressing a chimeric form of SLAM (sSLAMCD4) consisting of the entire extracellular region fused with domains 3 and 4 of rat CD4 and containing a COOH-terminal biotinylation sequence were constructed as described (6Brown M.H.

The join at the SalI (g tcg acc) junction of SLAM with CD4 was SLAM: DPSST (the residues containing theSalI site are underlined). The extracellular region of SLAM (sSLAM) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction from cDNA prepared from MT-2 cells (human T-cell lymphotrophic virus-1-transformed human T-cells). The 5′-primer was complementary to the SLAM leader sequence (MDPKGLLS (11Cocks B.G. Chang C.C. Carballido J.M. Yssel H. de Vries J.E. Aversa G. Nature. 1995; 376: 260-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar)), added an XbaI site, and inserted, immediately upstream of the initiation codon, the 25 bases that precede the rat CD4 initiation codon (26Clark S.J.

The 3′-primer was complementary to the membrane proximal SPWPGCRTDPSETK-encoding sequence and added nucleotides encoding a short linker (amino acids GGG), the BirA biotinylation signal sequence (amino acids LNDIFEAQKIEW (27Schatz P.J.

The polymerase chain reaction fragment was subcloned into the glutamine synthetase-based gene expression vector, pEE14 (28Bebbington C.R. Hentschel C.C.G. Glover D.M. DNA Cloning: A Practical Approach. 3. IRL Press, Oxford1987: 163-188Google Scholar). All constructs were checked by dideoxy sequencing. Chimeric proteins were expressed by transiently transfecting 293T-cells with 40 μg of plasmid DNA/5 × 106cells/175-cm2 flask using calcium phosphate as described (6Brown M.H.

Chinese hamster ovary-K1 cells were transfected with the pEE14 construct (28Bebbington C.R. Hentschel C.C.G. Glover D.M. DNA Cloning: A Practical Approach. 3.

The best clone was grown to confluence in bulk culture before switching to medium supplemented with 2 mm sodium butyrate, as described (29Davis S.J. Ward H.A. Puklavec M.J. Willis A.C. Williams A.F. Barclay A.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10410-10418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). sSLAM was purified from spent tissue culture supernatant by affinity chromatography using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen GmbH) followed by size exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column. When required, the histidine tag at the carboxyl terminus was removed by incubating 2.5 mg of sSLAM in 1.5 ml of Hepes-saline buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) with 1.2 units of carboxypeptidase A conjugated to agarose beads (Sigma) for 16 h at 30 °C with agitation. Removal of the carboxyl-terminal histidines was at least 80% efficient according to amino acid analysis. The extinction coefficient of the detagged protein was determined by amino acid analysis to be 1.03 cm2/mg. Prior to BIAcore™ analysis, sSLAM was passed through a Superdex 75 gel filtration column to remove aggregated protein (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For immobilization in BIAcore™ experiments, purified sSLAM or sSLAMCD4 in concentrated tissue culture supernatant were biotinylated by incubation with recombinant BirA enzyme (obtained from Avidity, Denver, CO or as a kind gift from Dr C. A. O'Callaghan) in 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8, 7.5 mm MgCl2, 5 mmNaCl, 5 mm ATP, and 1 mm biotin, overnight (6Brown M.H. Boles K. van der Merwe P.A. Kumar V. Mathew P.A. Barclay A.N. J. Exp.

All binding experiments were carried out on a BIAcore 2000 instrument (BIAcore AB, St. Albans, UK) using Hepes-buffered saline buffer, 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 3.4 mm EDTA, and 0.005% surfactant P20 supplied by the manufacturer. Streptavidin (Pierce) was coupled at 0.2 mg/ml in 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 5, to research grade CM5 chips (BIAcore AB) using amine coupling kits (BIAcore AB) and an activation time of 5 min, resulting in immobilization levels of ∼3000–4000 response units (RU). Equilibrium binding analysis was undertaken as described (7van der Merwe P.A. Barclay A.N. Mason D.W. Davies E.A. Morgan B.P. Tone M. Krishnam A.K. Ianelli C. Davis S.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10149-10160Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar); increasing and decreasing concentrations of sSLAM (5-μl injections at a flow rate of 20 μl/min) were passed over proteins immobilized at high, intermediate, and low levels. For kinetic analysis, dissociation rates were measured as described (7van der Merwe P.A. Barclay A.N. Mason D.W. Davies E.A. Morgan B.P. Tone M. Krishnam A.K. Ianelli C. Davis S.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10149-10160Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Experiments were performed at 25 °C unless indicated. Affinity and kinetic data were analyzed using the curve fitting tools of Origin v.5.0 (MicroCal Software Inc, Northampton, MA). Assuming that all of the molecules of immobilized biotinylated sSLAM (sSLAMb) are equally available to take part in homophilic interactions, the relevant equations at equilibrium are as follows for interactions between molecules in solution. [As⋅As]=1Kd1×[As]2Equation 1 The following is for interactions between immobilized molecules. [Af⋅Af]=1Kd2×[Af]2Equation 2 The interactions between soluble and immobilized molecules is as follows, [As·Af]=1Kd3×[As]×[Af]Equation 3 where [As ] and [Af ] are the concentrations of monomeric soluble and monomeric immobilized molecules, respectively, and [A s · As ], [A f · Af ], and [A s · Af ] are the concentrations of the three species of dimeric complexes. The corresponding dissociation constants are designatedK d 1,K d2 , and K d3 . In keeping with the general interpretation of BIAcore™ data, in what followsK d 3 will be assumed to be equal toK d 1. The relationship betweenK d 1 andK d 2 will be considered when the experimental data are discussed. In calculating [As ] and [As · As ] from Equation 1, use is made of the fact that, at equilibrium, the concentration of these molecular species is the same in the chip as it is in the solution passing through it. Putting [As ] = [A so] − 2[A s · As ], where [A so] is the total concentration of molecules in the soluble phase, Equation 1 can be solved to give the following. [As]=Kd14×1+8×[Aso]Kd11/2−1Equation 4 Similarly, Equations 2 and 3 yield the following, after some rearrangement, [Af]=Kd24×1+[As]Kd1×1+8×[Afo]Kd2×1+[As]Kd121/2−1Equation 5 where [A fo] is the total concentration of immobilized molecules on the chip, and [As ] is given by Equation 4. Equations 4 and 5, which give [As ] and [Af ] in terms of the two concentrations [A so], [A fo], and the two dissociation constants, K d 1 andK d 2, are used, in Equation 6 below, to give theoretical values for the response units obtained from the BIAcore™. Equation 6 is RU=P×1Kd1×[As]×[Af]Equation 6 where P is the number of response units/M of dimeric molecules formed by association between molecules in solution and those immobilized on the chip. For a molecule with anM r of 30,000 the value of P is taken to be 3 RU/μm. Titration of the sSLAM signal in the reference flow cell (see “Results”; Fig. 2 B) allowed accurate determination of P and the level of sSLAMb immobilized (i.e. [A fo]). With these substitutions, the full binding equation is shown below. RU=34×1+8×[Aso]Kd11/2−1×Kd24×1+[As]Kd1×Equation 7 1+8×[Afo]Kd2×1+[As]Kd121/2−1To derive K d 1 andK d 2 from the experimental data involves choosing values of these parameters that best fit the observations. This choice is facilitated by the fact that at low values of [A so] the soluble molecule is virtually all in monomeric form, that is [As ] approximately equals [A so]. Further, the value of [Af ] is given by the following. [Af]≈Kd24×1+8×[Afo]Kd21/2−1Equation 8 It follows that, at values of [A so] much lower than the K d , the fraction [A so]bound/[A so]free(defined as g), is given by the following. g=[Aso]−[As][As]≈Kd24×Kd1×1+8×[Afo]Kd21/2−1=RU3×[Aso]Equation 9 Equation 9 may be rearranged to give the following. Kd2=2×Kd1×g×(Kd1×g)([Afo]−Kd1×g)Equation 10 This expression may be used to expressK d 1 in terms of g andK d 2 in Equation 7. The result is as follows. RU=38[(1+8×[A80]Kd1)1/2−1]×[(Kd1×g)2([Afo]−Kd1×g)]×[1+[As]Kd1]×[(1+4×[Afo](Kd1×g)2([Afo]−Kd1×g)×[1+[As]Kd1]2)1/2−1]Equation 11 If the value of g, for a given value of [A fo], is determined experimentally, Equation11 may be used to calculate response units for various values of [A so], for any chosen value ofK d 1. In practice a curve-fitting computer program is used to determine the value ofK d 1 that best fits the observed dependence of RU on [A so]. Alternatively, if g is measured for two or more different values of [A fo], Equation 10 may be used to calculate K d 1 andK d 2. Thus, ifga and gb are two values of g, obtained by using two different concentrations, [A fo] a and [A fo] b of immobilized molecules on the chip, then the equation shown below follows from Equation 10. Kd1=gb2×[Afo]a−gb2×[Afo]bga×gb×(gb−ga)Equation 12 Alternatively, if K d 1is assumed to be equal toK d 2, then again the following is from Equation 10. Kd1=Kd2=[Afo]g×(2×g+1)Equation 13 Analysis of the experimental results for sSLAM indicates that they are compatible with the two dissociation constants being equal. Consequently, Equation 13 can be used to calculateK d 1 from the RU values obtained at low concentrations of sSLAM passed through the BIAcore™ chip. More generally, if K d 1 andK d 2 are not assumed to be equal, Equation 11 must be used to evaluateK d 1. To set up the immobilized phase (Af), sSLAMb was generated by biotinylating the COOH terminus of sSLAM to anchor it to streptavidin covalently attached to the sensor surface. Streptavidin has four biotin binding sites, but considerations of steric hindrance strongly suggest that at most three of these remain accessible to biotin after immobilizing the streptavidin to the chip. Consequently, the immobilized sSLAMb probably exists in monomeric, dimeric, and trimeric forms. The presence of the bivalent and trivalent forms introduces a complication in calculating equilibrium constants for the immobilized sSLAMb molecules in that these multimers may be expected to make more stable homophilic complexes between themselves than does the monomeric form of sSLAMb. To take this complexity into account, we assume that only the monomeric form of immobilized sSLAMb is available to react with the soluble sSLAM passing through the chip. If [B] is the total molar concentration of sSLAMb on the chip and [Av] is the concentration of streptavidin, then, assuming that three biotin binding sites remain accessible on each streptavidin molecule, the proportion of the total immobilized sSLAMb that exists as a monomer is given by the following. [sSLAMbmonomer][sSLAMbtotal]=1−[B]3×[Av]2Equation 14 The application of Equation 10 to the experimental data given in “Results” indicates that, at [sSLAMbtotal] values of 82.7, 186, and 438 μm, the fraction of the total immobilized sSLAMb that exists as a monomer is 0.91, 0.80, and 0.56, respectively. The corresponding values for the effective concentrations of sSLAMb are 75, 148, and 246 μm. A correction of this magnitude is clearly essential because without it the application of Equation 12 to the experimental data obtained with 82.7 μm and 438 μm sSLAMb immobilized predicts a negative value for K d 1. In contrast, the application of Equation 12 to the 82.7 and 186 μmresults gives a positive value for the same dissociation constant. Similarly, uncorrected values of [A fo] substituted in Equation 9 give very disparate values for the ratio ofK d 1/K d 2when the observed values of g are used to calculate it. In the preceding analysis it was assumed that those molecules of immobilized sSLAMb, which were not involved in the multimeric homophilic interactions described above, were available to react both with each other and equally with sSLAM passing through the chip. This assumption would be invalid if the multimeric interactions imposed some conformational restraint on the gel matrix that impeded homophilic interactions between molecules of immobilized sSLAMb but not between immobilized and soluble forms of the molecule. To analyze this model, Kd2 was taken to be essentially infinite. In this case the binding equation reduces to the following. RU=3×1+8×[Aso]Kd11/2−1×[Afo]3+1+8×[Aso]Kd11/2Equation 15 The term [A fo] is equal tog × K d 1, whereg is, as before, the observed ratio of bound to free sSLAM at low concentrations of sSLAM. With this equality substituted into Equation 15, a comparison can be made between the experimental data and the prediction of this alternative model, without an explicit value of [A fo] being required. Application of this model to the experimental data demonstrated that it was invalid because the values of K d1 that it predicted yielded corresponding values of [A fo] that were actually larger than those used in the experiments (see “Results”). Samples to be analyzed by sedimentation velocity were contained in double sector centerpieces (pathlength of 3 or 12 mm depending on protein concentration) and spun at 40,000 rpm in a Beckman Optima XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge at 37 °C. The sedimentation of the protein boundary was observed using a variety of incident wavelengths of light, chosen to give an interpretable series of boundary traces for the experimental protein concentration. At high concentrations a schlieren signal was observed in the absorbance scans. This has been reported once before when it was shown that it is a function of the precise configuration of the AUC monochromator (31Coelfen H. Harding S.E. Progr. Colloid Polym. Sci. 1995; 99: 167-186Crossref Google Scholar), which varies between instruments. This was controlled for by collecting data at different wavelengths and resulted in an additional peak in theg(s*) profile at low s* at wavelengths where a schlieren signal was elicited. The schlieren contribution was allowed for at this stage. Data were analyzed using the time derivative (g(s*)t ) method calculated with the program dc/dt (32Stafford W.F. d. Anal.

In Escherichia coli , this reaction is mediated by the Ffh/4.5 S RNA ribonucleoprotein complex (Ffh/4.5 S RNP; the SRP) and the FtsY protein (the SRP receptor). We have quantified the effects of 4.5 S RNA on Ffh-FtsY complex formation by monitoring changes in tryptophan fluorescence. Surprisingly, 4.5 S RNA facilitates both assembly and disassembly of the Ffh-FtsY complex to a similar extent. These results provide an example of an RNA molecule facilitating protein-protein interactions in a catalytic fashion."

Monoclonal antibodies against the P-selectin binding domain of the leukocyte P-selectin glycoprotein ligand, PSGL-1, prevented HGE cell binding and infection, as did enzymatic digestion of PSGL-1. Furthermore, simultaneous neoexpression in nonsusceptible cells of complementary DNAs for both PSGL-1 and its modifying α-(1,3) fucosyltransferase, Fuc-TVII, allowed binding and infection by HGE. Thus, the HGE bacterium specifically bound to fucosylated leukocyte PSGL-1. Selectin mimicry is likely central to the organism's unique ability to target and infect neutrophils."

The results give a Grüneisen parameter γ 0 = 1.68 (±0.20) and q = 0.7 (±0.5). Phenomenological modeling shows that the Raman-active mode can be approximately correlated with an acoustic phonon and thus provides direct information about the high-pressure elastic properties of iron, which have been controversial. In particular, the C 44 elastic modulus is found to be lower than previous determinations. This leads to changes of about 35% at core pressures for shear wave anisotropies."

SAO shock was induced in rats by clamping both the superior mesenteric artery and the celiac trunk for 45 min, followed by release of the clamp (reperfusion). At 60 min after reperfusion, animals were killed for histological examination and biochemical studies. There was a marked increase in the oxidation of dihydrorhodamine 123 to rhodamine (a marker of peroxynitrite-induced oxidative processes) in the plasma of the SAO-shocked rats after reperfusion, but not during ischemia alone. Immunohistochemical examination demonstrated a marked increase in the immunoreactivity to nitrotyrosine, an index of nitrogen species such as peroxynitrite, in the necrotic ileum in shocked rats. SAO-shocked rats developed a significant increase of tissue myeloperoxidase and malonaldehyde activity, and marked histological injury to the distal ileum. SAO shock was also associated with a significant mortality (0% survival at 2 h after reperfusion). Reperfused ileum tissue sections from SAO-shocked rats showed positive staining for P-selectin localized mainly in the vascular endothelial cells. Ileum tissue sections obtained from SAO-shocked rats and stained with antibody to ICAM-1 showed a diffuse staining. Administration of FeTMPS significantly reduced ischemia/reperfusion injury in the bowel, and reduced lipid and the production of peroxynitrite during reperfusion. Treatment with PN catalyst also markedly reduced the intensity and degree of P-selectin and ICAM-1 staining in tissue sections from SAO-shocked rats and improved survival. Our results clearly demonstrate that peroxynitrite decomposition catalysts exert a protective effect in SAO and that this effect may be due to inhibition of the expression of adhesion molecules and the tissue damage associated with peroxynitrite-related pathways."

Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1986; 1: 376-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), suggesting that subfamily members may not be very closely related. Indeed, unlike ICP10 PK, ICP6 PK DNA does not have transforming potential (9Aurelian L. Front.

Because the PK domains are only present in the HSV R1 proteins and sequences homologous to ICP10 PK DNA were cloned from human cells (HeLa) (24Smith C.C. Wymer J.P. Luo J. Aurelian L. Virus Genes. 1991; 5: 215-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), it has been suggested that the domains arose from a co-opted cellular gene(s) (9Aurelian L. Front. Biosci. 1998; 3: 237-249Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). However, cellular genes similar to the HSV R1 PKs are largely unknown. The only exception is FAST, a PK that is activated during Fas-mediated apoptosis and is 12% identical to ICP10 PK when PK motifs are anchored (25Tian Q. Taupin J.L. Elledge S. Robertson M. Anderson P. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 865-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The studies described in this report were designed to identify cellular genes homologous to ICP10 PK and examine their function. We report the cloning and characterization of a novel gene (H11), which encodes a protein with 30% identity to ICP10 PK (with anchored PK motifs) and induces anchorage-independent growth in stably transfected cells. H11 protein has Ser-Thr PK activity. It is expressed in melanoma cells and expression appears to be required for cell growth.DISCUSSIONThe salient feature of the data described in this report is the identification and cloning of a novel gene (H11) that has transforming potential and codes for a protein, which is similar to ICP10 PK and has Ser-Thr-specific PK activity.

Genet. 1986; 1: 376-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and it has different biological properties, including its failure to associate with the plasma membrane (22Conner J. Murray J. Cross A. Clements J.B. Marsden H.S. Virology. 1995; 213: 615-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), activate the mitogenic RAS/MEK/MAPK pathway (23Zachos G. Clements B. Conner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5097-5103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), and cause transformation (9Aurelian L. Front. Biosci. 1998; 3: 237-249Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Another PK known to function with a similarly limited number of conserved catalytic motifs is FAST, which is only 12% identical to ICP10 PK (25Tian Q. Taupin J.L. Elledge S. Robertson M. Anderson P. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 865-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Because sequences homologous to ICP10 PK were previously cloned from human cells (24Smith C.C. Wymer J.P. Luo J. Aurelian L. Virus Genes. 1991; 5: 215-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), we proposed that the unique PK domains in HSV R1 proteins arose from cellular gene(s) (9Aurelian L. Front. Biosci. 1998; 3: 237-249Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). However, these putative homologues were not previously cloned and their function is unknown. The studies described in this report were designed to address these questions.We screened HeLa and melanoma cDNA libraries because these cells express a protein that cross-reacts with ICP10 PK in immunoblotting. H11 cDNA was cloned from both libraries. It codes for a protein that is 30% identical to ICP10 PK over the PK catalytic domain. This identity level is higher than that between FAST and ICP10 PK, but lower than that between the HSV-1 and HSV-2 R1 PK proteins (1Nikas I. McLauchlan J. Davison A.J. Taylor W.R. Clements J.B. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1986; 1: 376-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Potential conserved PK catalytic motifs are organized in a pattern similar to that in ICP10 PK and flanking an Src homology region 3-binding site (6Nelson J.W. Zhu J. Smith C.C. Kulka M. Aurelian L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17021-17027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar,14Hunter J.C.R. Smith C.C. Aurelian L. Int. J. Oncol. 1995; 7: 515-522PubMed Google Scholar). Like ICP10 PK, which is myristoylated (3Chung T.D. Wymer J.P. Kulka M. Smith C.C. Aurelian L. Virology. 1990; 179: 168-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), H11 has consensus sites for myristoylation. However, the biologic and evolutionary significance of this level of identity is still unclear, particularly as it relates to the potential cellular origin of the R1 PKs.The basic shared functions common to all PKs are ion-dependent ATP binding and catalysis. The two conserved charged residues that respectively constitute catalytic motifs II (Lys) and III (Glu) presumably form an ion pair that, in the ternary complex, provides a docking site for MgATP (12Hanks S.K. Hunter T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 576-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (2262) Google Scholar, 13Taylor S.S. Knighton D.R. Zheng J. Ten Eyck L.F. Sowadski J.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 429-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). In kinases that are expressed at low levels, replacement of the Lys residue in catalytic motif II is sufficient to show a null phenotype (13Taylor S.S. Knighton D.R. Zheng J. Ten Eyck L.F. Sowadski J.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 429-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 17Honneger A.M. Dull T.J. Felder S. van Obberghen E. Bellot F. Szapary D. Schmidt A. Ullrich A Schlessinger J. Cell. 1987; 51: 199-209Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Our findings for H11 are consistent with these interpretations. Thus, a 25-kDa phosphoprotein was seen in extracts of 293 cells transfected with the H11 expression vector by immunocomplex PK/immunoblotting assays with antibodies specific for residues located at the N terminus or C terminus of the H11 protein. Like the ICP10 PK activity, the PK activity of H11 was Ser-Thr-specific, Mn2+-dependent, and it did not require monovalent cations. It was optimized in the presence of Mg2+ and Mn2+ ions. We do not exclude the possibility that H11 is a substrate for other cellular kinases. However, we conclude that it has intrinsic PK activity, because the activity was ablated (null phenotype) by mutation of Lys113(catalytic motif II), which is the criterion used for all other PKs studied to date (12Hanks S.K. Hunter T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 576-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (2262) Google Scholar, 13Taylor S.S. Knighton D.R. Zheng J. Ten Eyck L.F. Sowadski J.M. Annu. Rev.

The comparison between H11 and Lys113 in PK assays is justified, because the levels of the proteins in the assay were virtually identical, as evidenced by immunoblotting of the immunoprecipitates. Background activity was not observed in immunoprecipitates from mock-transfected cells or from cells transfected with H11 and precipitated with preimmune serum. If present, the contaminating activity in these assays is less than 0.1% of the specific activity of wild type H11, because PK negative mutants are sometimes detectable within this range (43LaPorte D.C. Thorsness P.E. Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 10563-10568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the Lys113 mutant was not phosphorylated. The Lys113 mutant retains all known target sites for other PKs, and the H11 PK activity was not altered by mutation of Lys115 that is not located within a conserved catalytic motif (data not shown), suggesting that loss of PK activity by Lys113 mutation is not because of a nonspecific conformational alteration resulting from the mutation of a Lys residue. The conclusion that H11 has PK activity is also supported by the finding of PK activity in bacteria induced to express GST-H11, but not uninduced bacteria or bacteria induced to express GST. Background phosphorylation due to nonspecific protein binding to the glutathione-Sepharose beads was also not seen. However, H11 may be part of a hetero-oligomeric complex, in which it contributes much of the PK catalytic domain while another protein contributes other required sequences (35Herman P.K. Stack J.H. DeModena J.A. Emr S.D. Cell. 1991; 64: 425-437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Ongoing studies of the H11 PK activity include identification of H11 PK substrates and phosphorylation sites.H11 resembles ICP10 PK in that 293 cells stably transfected with the H11 expression vector pYXH11 acquire anchorage-independent growth, a virtually absolute correlate of neoplastic potential in vivo. We conclude that H11 expression is required for anchorage-independent growth, because the latter was seen in at least four independently established lines that were positive for H11 expression but not in H11 negative cells (untransfected or transfected with the empty vector). Additionally, cloning was determined at an early passage, before cells with a H11-unrelated growth advantage could be selected. The cloning efficiency of cells transformed with H11 was comparable or greater than that of such oncogenes as v-fos(0.1–0.7% (44Lee M.-S. Yang J.-H. Salehi Z. Arnstein P. Chen L.-S. Jay G. Rhim J.S. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 387-393PubMed Google Scholar)), int-2 (0.35%), c-Ha-ras(0.5%), c-erb B2 (1.0% (45Basolo F. Fiore L. Ciardiello F. Calvo S. Fontanini G. Conaldi P.G. Toniolo A. Int. J. Cancer. 1994; 56: 736-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar)), and v-sis(2.9–4.3% (46Yang D. Kohler S.K. Maher V.M. McCormick J.J. Carcinogenesis. 1994; 15: 2167-2175Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar)) in human cells, suggesting that H11 has a relatively strong transforming activity, as previously reported for ICP10 PK (9Aurelian L. Front. Biosci. 1998; 3: 237-249Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 10Smith C.C. Luo J.H. Hunter J.C.R. Ordonez J.V. Aurelian L.

When colonies similar in size to those scored for c-erb B2 and v-sis (60–80 μm) were counted, the cloning efficiency of H11-transformed cells was 10–20-fold higher than that reported for these oncogenes. However, the mechanism of H11-mediated transformation and the role of the PK activity are presently unknown. The presence of consensus myristoylation sites in the H11 protein suggests that it might be associated with the plasma membrane (47Schultz A.M. Henderson L.E. Oroszlan S. Gerber E.A. Hanafusa H. Science. 1985; 227: 427-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) and thereby function in the transduction of growth signals. Ongoing studies using cell lines established with the Lys113 PK negative mutant are designed to examine the role of PK activity in H11-mediated transformation.H11 RNA was seen in melanoma cell lines and in primary melanoma tissues, indicating that expression was not an artifact because of prolonged in vitro culture. RNA was also seen in normal melanocytes and benign nevi, but its levels were significantly (47–100-fold) lower than those in melanoma cells. Expression of the H11 protein was determined by immunoprecipitation/immunoblotting with antibodies that recognize epitopes located at the H11 N terminus or C terminus. A 25-kDa protein consistent with that seen in pYXH11-transfected 293 cells was recognized by both antibodies in melanoma cells labeled with [35S]methionine. The protein was also seen in normal melanocytes, but at significantly lower levels than those in melanoma cells. It was also precipitated from [32P]orthophosphate-labeled melanoma cells and, as predicted, it was recognized by ICP10 PK antibodies, but not by preimmune serum or antibody to the hsp27 protein. We conclude that the H11 protein in melanoma cells has PK activity because autophosphorylation was seen in immunocomplex PK/immunoblotting assays with the H11 antibodies. However, the in vivo versus in vitro phosphorylation patterns of the H11 melanoma cell protein are still unknown.Ongoing immunohistochemistry studies support the interpretation that H11 is overexpressed in melanoma cells and also in skin tissues. 3Gyotoku, T., Kokuba, H., Aurelian, L. Burnett, J. W., manuscript in prepartion. However, overexpression does not seem to result from gene amplification, at least as determined by Southern blot hybridization. This is consistent with previous findings for other overexpressed genes (viz. N-myc) for which the levels of expression are unrelated to gene amplification (27Livingstone A. Mairs R.J. Russell J. O'Donogue J. Gaze M.N. Wheldon T.E. Eur. J. Cancer. 1994; 30A: 382-389Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Gene alterations that cause overexpression include deletion/mutation (48Hosokawa Y. Suzuki R. Joh T. Maeda Y. Nakamura S. Kodera Y. Arnold A. Seto M. Int. J. Cancer. 1998; 76: 791-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), altered regulation resulting from improved access to translational initiation sites or increased translational efficiency (49Child S.J. Miller M.K. Geballe A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24335-24341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), increased RNA stability (50Bauer S.R. Piechaczyk M. Nordan R.P.

Oncogene. 1998; 16: 3013-3017Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The mechanism responsible for H11 overexpression in melanoma cells and the tissue distribution of H11 expression remain to be determined.An important as yet unresolved consideration is the role of H11 in melanoma. To begin to address this question, we used the antisense approach because numerous studies have shown antisense effects on virus- or cancer-related genes, and antisense therapeutics have begun to move into the clinical arena (28Feng C.P.

Despite the common enzymatic properties, discrete expression of both isoforms is maintained in alternate cell types.

Although there are two isozymes of ACE in every mammal, both are transcribed in a tissue-specific fashion from distinct promoters within the same gene (2Howard T.E. Shai S.Y. Langford K.G.

The 140-kDa somatic (sACE) isoform is expressed in vascular endothelial cells, epithelial cells in the kidney proximal tubules, brain, intestinal brush border cells, monocytes, epididymis, and Leydig cells of the testes (4Friedland J.

The 70-kDa germinal (gACE) isoform is expressed exclusively in late pachytene spermatocytes (7Langford K.G. Zhou Y. Russell L.D. Wilcox J.N. Bernstein K.E. Biol. Reprod. 1993; 48: 1210-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The overall sequence homology between isoforms across mammalian species is 80–90%. Expression in such diverse tissue types evokes a broader, modern view of ACE as a physiological mediator of multiple regulatory processes. This concept was illustrated in ACE-deficient mice that suffer from gross kidney structural abnormalities, altered vascular wall architecture, electrolyte imbalance, and male infertility (8Esther C.R.

The fertility defect was due to poor sperm migration through the oviduct and failure to bind and penetrate the zona pellucida. However, there was no fertility defect in angiotensinogen knockout mice. Taken together, these results suggest that gACE may hydrolyze an oviduct or ovum-specific substrate (11Hagaman J.R. Moyer J.S. Bachman E.S. Sibony M. Magyar P.L. Welch J.E. Smithies O. Krege J.H. O'Brien D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2552-2557Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). The absolute requirement for ACE expression was demonstrated in Drosophila in which two unique genes encode alternatively expressed ACE-like isozymes, AnCE and Acer (12Houard X. Williams T.A. Michaud A. Dani P. Isaac R.E. Shirras A.D. Coates D. Corvol P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 257: 599-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Two embryonic lethal mutants have mapped to theAnce gene locus, and heteroallelic combinations of these two mutations produced sterile male progeny (13Tatei K. Cai H. Ip Y.T. Levine M. Mech. Dev. 1995; 51: 157-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Transcription initiations of gACE and sACE mRNAs occur at two alternative sites within the same gene. The gACE-specific sequences are spliced out of the mature sACE transcript, whereas the gACE transcription initiates within an intron of the sACE transcription unit (2Howard T.E. Shai S.Y. Langford K.G. Martin B.M. Bernstein K.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4294-4302Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 3Kumar R.S. Thekkumkara T.J. Sen G.C. J. Biol.

As a result, the two proteins contain 665 common residues at their carboxyl termini, whereas at the amino termini, sACE and gACE contain 664 unique residues and 72 unique residues, respectively (14Thekkumkara T.J. Livingston W.D. Kumar R.S. Sen G.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 683-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Both ACE isoforms are type I ectoproteins that are anchored in the plasma membrane through hydrophobic regions present near their carboxyl termini. In addition, a soluble form of the sACE protein containing the extracellular domain is also produced by the regulated action of a membrane-associated cleavage-secretion process (15Beldent V.

A. 1998; 95: 138-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Both isozymes share a common catalytic center located in the identical carboxyl-terminal domains. As expected, the enzymatic properties of the gACE and carboxyl-terminal domain of sACE are very similar owing to the common sequence shared by both isozymes (18Ehlers M.R. Riordan J.F. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7118-7126Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 19Sen I. Samanta H. Livingston III, W. Sen G.C. J. Biol.

J. 1992; 288: 875-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In contrast, sACE contains another catalytic center in its unique amino-terminal domain (8Esther C.R. Marino E.M. Howard T.E. Machaud A. Corvol P. Capecchi M.R. Bernstein K.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2375-2385Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 19Sen I. Samanta H. Livingston III, W. Sen G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21985-21990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although both domains of sACE contain the same zinc-binding motif (His-Glu-X-Y-His), the amino-terminal active site cleaves LHRH 30 times faster and the hematopoietic peptide NH2-acetyl-Ser-Gly-Lys-Pro 40 times faster than the carboxyl-terminal active site (18Ehlers M.R. Riordan J.F. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7118-7126Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 22Rousseau A. Michaud A. Chauvet M.T. Lenfant M. Corvol P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3656-3661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Similar substrate preferences were observed for the AnCE and Acer proteins (12Houard X. Williams T.A. Michaud A. Dani P. Isaac R.E. Shirras A.D. Coates D. Corvol P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 257: 599-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 23Isaac R.E. Ekbote U. Coates D. Shirras A.D. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 897: 342-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The evolutionary conservation of the two isoforms of ACE indicates that both are functionally indispensable (6Corvol P. Williams T.A. Soubrier F. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 283-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Moreover, their tissue-specific expression suggests that the specific physiological function of an isoform requires its expression in the correct tissue, a concept that was experimentally supported by our observation that gACE expression in sperm alone is sufficient for maintaining male fertility (24Ramaraj P. Kessler S.P. Colmenares C. Sen G.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 371-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). It remains unclear, however, given the similarities in their enzymatic properties in vitro, why the two isoforms are needed. The conservation of gACE is especially puzzling because the carboxyl-terminal active site of sACE is both structurally and functionally identical to the single active site of gACE. Moreover, the recombinant sACE carboxyl-terminal domain can hydrolyze several sperm-specific proteins in vitro (20Isaac R.E. Williams T.A. Sajid M. Corvol P. Coates D. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 587-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Thus, one would expect that sACE should be able to carry out all physiological functions of gACE if expressed in the appropriate tissues. This idea was experimentally tested in the studies reported here. By creating transgenic mice that express sACE exclusively in ACE-deficient sperm, we demonstrate that each isoform is functionally distinct. Enzymatically active, sperm surface-bound sACE failed to restoreAce −/− male fertility. Although the level of sACE expression exceeded that of normal gACE expression, there was no fertility blockage in Ace +/− mice that also contained the somatic ace transgene. Our results explain the strict evolutionary requirement for the expression of both ACE isoforms. In addition, we demonstrate the applicability of an in vivoisozymic substitution approach to test the functional equivalence of any two or more isoforms that share very similar enzymatic properties. The full-length rabbit somaticace cDNA was assembled in pCDNA3 (Invitrogen) that contains the T7 and CMV promoters. The 177-bpNcoI-XhoI genomic GC-rich fragment (3Kumar R.S. Thekkumkara T.J. Sen G.C.

Chem. 1991; 266: 3854-3862Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was joined at the unique XhoI site to the remainder of the somaticace cDNA amplified by HiFidelity reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) on rabbit lung mRNA template utilizing a sense primer rACEp5Xho1 (5′GCTACAACTCGAGCGCCGAGCAGG3′ and antisense primer rACEpendAS (5′CCCGTCGACTCAGGAGTGTCTTAGCTCCACCTCG3′). The vector containing thePGK2-somatic ace transgene (Ps), was then generated by substituting the sperm-specific 515-bp human phosphoglycerate kinase II (PGK2) promoter for the T7 and CMV promoters (24Ramaraj P. Kessler S.P. Colmenares C. Sen G.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 371-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The 5246-bp (Ps) transgene, released bySpeI and AsnI digestion, was purified from agarose gel using Geneclean II (BIO 101, Inc., Vista, CA) prior to microinjection into FVB zygotes by the Cleveland Clinic Foundation Transgenic Core Facility utilizing standard techniques. Prior to transgene micro-injection, we tested for expression of full-length, enzymatically active sACE protein in vitro. A coupled transcription/translation reaction with [35S]Met was performed according to instructions in the T7 TNT kit (Promega). The resulting 140-kDa rabbit sACE protein was visualized in an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and autoradiographed for 16 h. Expression of enzymatically active sACE in vivo was tested by transiently transfecting plasmid AP005 into the ACE-expressing opossum kidney cells (OPK) (ATCC CRL-1840) and human fibrosarcoma cells (HT1080) (ATCC CCL-121) using Fugene 6 Transfection Reagent according the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cells were cultured as described previously (25Kessler S.P. Goraya T.Y. Sen G.C. Gene Expr. 1996; 6: 73-85PubMed Google Scholar). The standard ACE enzyme assay that measures the cleavage of His-Leu from Hip-His-Leu was performed on the cell extracts as described (19Sen I. Samanta H. Livingston III, W. Sen G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21985-21990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Genomic DNA (15 μg) was digested overnight with SacI as described (24Ramaraj P. Kessler S.P. Colmenares C. Sen G.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 371-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The DNA was electrophoresed in a 0.8% TBE agarose gel, transferred to Hybond N+ membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), pre-hybridized and hybridized in Church Buffer and washed as described (26Kessler S.P. Rowe T.M. Blendy J.A. Erickson R.P. Sen G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9971-9975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The 405-bp somaticace probe used for founder identification was generated from plasmid AP005 by EcoRI digestion. The 218-bp mouseAce exon 13-14 probe was obtained by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction amplification from mouse testes total RNA and cloned into pBluescriptII (Stratagene) to yield mouseAce 13-14/pBSII (2Howard T.E. Shai S.Y. Langford K.G. Martin B.M. Bernstein K.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4294-4302Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The exon 13-14 probe, released byBamHI and HindIII digestion, was used for all subsequent genotyping since it hybridized to both mouse Aceand transgenic rabbit ace genes. Probes were radiolabeled with [α-32P]dCTP as indicated in the Random Prime Labeling Kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). After exposing to a PhosphorImager screen for 4 h, each band was quantitated using ImageQuant analysis software. Copy number and transgene homozygosity was determined by normalizing the transgene signal to the corresponding mouse Ace signal. Tissues isolated from age-matched adult mice were homogenized in ACE lysis buffer as described (19Sen I. Samanta H. Livingston III, W. Sen G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21985-21990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All Line A, C, and D extracts (100 μg) were electrophoresed on an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and then transferred to Immobilon-P (Millipore). Membranes were probed with the goat anti-rabbit ACE polyclonal antisera 447 (17Sadhukhan R. Sen G.C. Ramchandran R. Sen I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 138-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) as described previously (24Ramaraj P. Kessler S.P. Colmenares C. Sen G.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 371-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitation ACE enzyme assay was performed by incubating 200 μg of tissue extract with antisera 447 diluted 1:150 in 150 μl of ACE lysis buffer. Following rotation at 4 °C for 1 h, 30 μl of ACE lysis buffer equilibrated rabbit anti-goat-agarose beads (Sigma) was added. Incubation was continued for an additional 1 h at 4 °C with rotation. Following extensive washing with ACE lysis buffer, the standard ACE enzyme assay that measures the cleavage of His-Leu from Hip-His-Leu was performed on the rabbit ACE tethered to the agarose beads (19Sen I. Samanta H. Livingston III, W. Sen G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21985-21990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Un-fixed, adult testes were embedded in O.C.T. (Tissue-Tek) in dry ice/methanol bath and cryo-sectioned at 20-μm thickness. Slides were equilibrated at 25 °C for 30 min in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl prior to probing with 800 pm125I-351A (2176 Ci/mmol) (Peptide Radioiodination Service Center, Washington State University, Pullman, WA) as described (27Krebs L.T. Hanesworth J.M. Sardinia M.F. Speth R.C. Wright J.W. Harding J.W. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2000; 293: 260-267PubMed Google Scholar). All sections were quantitated with subtraction of background using ImageQuant software analysis of signals obtained by Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. Age-matched, adult kidneys and testes were fixed in Histochoice (Sigma), paraffin-embedded, cross-sectioned at 5 μm thickness, and hematoxylin and eosin-stained by the Lerner Research Institute Histology Core (Cleveland, OH). Immunohistochemistry was performed following standard de-paraffinization procedures employing Clear-Rite and Flex solutions (Richard Allan). Slides were twice boiled in 10 mm sodium citrate, pH 6.0, for 5 min and returned to PBS. The slides were blocked for 2 h at 25 °C in PBS + 10% horse serum + 0.3% Triton X-100 (blocking buffer). The primary antibody 447, diluted 1:1000 in blocking buffer, was applied to the slides in a humid chamber for 16 h at 4 °C. Following washes in PBS + 0.3% Triton X-100 (PBST), anti-goat fluorescein isothiocyanate (1:200) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was applied to each section for 2 h in the dark at 25 °C. Following washes in PBST, Vectashield (Vector Laboratories) diluted 1:1 in PBS was applied. All stained slides were visualized with a Leica digital fluorescent microscope and Adobe Photoshop software. The C57Bl/6 strain Ace knockout mice were a kind gift from Oliver Smithies (9Krege J.H. John S.W. Langenbach L.L. Hodgin J.B. Hagaman J.R. Bachman E.S. Jennette J.C. O'Brien D.A. Smithies O. Nature. 1995; 375: 146-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). To generateAce knockout FVB strain mice, Ace +/− C57Bl/6 males were crossed with wild-type FVB females. Successive back-cross-matings were continued for 8 generations with Ace+/− males and wild-type FVB females (Taconic Farms). Since the previously reported transgenic mice, [PGK2-germinalace-bghPa (Pg)] were FVB strain, generation of FVB strain Ace −/−, Pg +/− mice was performed by crossing FVB Ace +/− mice with Pg +/− FVB strain mice. Mating Ace +/−, Pg +/− F1 sibs was performed to generate F2 Ace −/−, Pg +/− sibs that were used as the control group for the fertility assay. Similarly, FVBPGK2-somatic ace-bghpA (Ps) transgenic founder mice were mated with Ace +/− FVB mice to generate Ace +/−, Ps +/− mice. Matings were then performed with all male and female genotypes to produce (Ace −/−, Ps +/−) and (Ace −/−,Ps +/+) experimental males. The number of pups sired from all of these matings was recorded. Fertility testing of all four Line A experimental males was conducted by mating each with a total of six wild-type age-matched females (The Jackson Laboratories) for 10 days. Females were observed for plugs. If no pups were produced within 22 days from male removal, the same females were mated with Ace +/− FVB males for 10 days. The number of pups per litter was noted. Control group fertility testing was performed with Ace −/−, Pg +/− sibs, age-matched to the Line A experimental group. The full-length rabbit somatic ace cDNA was assembled in the pCDNA3 vector by joining a 177-bp ace genomic fragment (3Kumar R.S. Thekkumkara T.J. Sen G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3854-3862Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to a large fragment of the somatic ace cDNA that was generated by HiFidelity reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (Fig.1 A). Verification of full-length sACE expression was demonstrated by an in vitrotranscription and translation assay (Fig. 1 B). The in vitro translated sACE was enzymatically active in the standard ACE enzyme analysis that measures the cleavage of Hip-His-Leu to His-Leu (data not shown) (19Sen I. Samanta H. Livingston III, W. Sen G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21985-21990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of rabbit sACE in vivo was measured following transient transfection into HT1080 cells and sACE-expressing opossum proximal kidney tubule (OPK) cells. Again, 140-kDa enzymatically active rabbit sACE was produced (Fig. 1,C and D). Verification of the species specificity of the antisera was also observed. The goat anti-rabbit ACE antisera did not detect sACE in whole mouse lung (Fig. 1 C). With these results, the 515-bp human PGK2 promoter, previously shown to direct sperm-specific transgene expression in mice (24Ramaraj P. Kessler S.P. Colmenares C. Sen G.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 371-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), was substituted for the CMV promoter in theCMV-somatic ace-bghpA construct to generate the PGK2-somatic ace-bghpA(Ps) transgene (Fig. 2).Figure 2Southern hybridization and mating scheme. Autoradiograph of a Southern blot hybridization utilizing the 405-bp somatic ace probe to analyze 15 μg ofSacI-digested mouse genomic tail DNA. Four out of 21 FVB pups generated by micro-injection received the PGK2-somaticace-bghpA transgene (Ps). Each founder was mated with Ace +/− FVB mice for transgene transmission. Founder and F1 generation SacI-digested DNA was hybridized with the murine exon 13-14 probe to determine theAce and Ps genotype of each mouse based on the presence of a 6.6- (wild-type Ace allele), 8.4- (Ace knockout allele), and 3.7-kb transgene fragment. Line A (Ace −/−, Ps +/−) mice were produced by matingAce +/−, Ps +/− sibs.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) For generating transgenic mice, the 5.25-kb SpeI to AsnI fragment of the PGK2-somatic ace-bghpAexpression vector was microinjected into fertilized FVB strain eggs. Out of 21 pups born, 4 had transgene integration. The founders were identified by Southern blot hybridization with a probe isolated from the rabbit somatic ace cDNA (Fig. 2). For establishing lines from the four transgenic mice, they were mated with FVB mice of the Ace +/− genotype. It was important to assess the effects of the somatic ace transgene on mice with syngeneic backgrounds because physiological properties, such as blood pressure or litter size, are known to vary significantly among different strains (24Ramaraj P. Kessler S.P. Colmenares C. Sen G.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 371-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Since our transgenic mice were of FVB strain, we transferred theAce null genotype from the original C57Bl/6 background to the FVB background by repeated back-crossing for eight generations. Of the original four transgenic founders, only A (number 5), C (number 16), and D (number 18) transmitted the transgene (Fig. 2). Founder B (number 8) failed to transmit the transgene to any of 33 offspring analyzed (data not shown). Simultaneous verification of mouseAce and Ps transgene genotype was performed using a mouse exon 13-14 probe. Hybridization of this probe to genomic DNA digested with SacI resulted in an 8.4-kb Aceknockout allelic fragment carrying the neo r gene insertion, a 6.6-kb wild-type Ace fragment, and a 3.7-kb somatic ace transgene fragment (Fig. 2) (9Krege J.H. John S.W. Langenbach L.L. Hodgin J.B. Hagaman J.R. Bachman E.S. Jennette J.C. O'Brien D.A. Smithies O. Nature. 1995; 375: 146-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). Further characterization of copy number and homozygosity was determined by PhosphorImager quantitation of the transgene normalized to the single copy mouse Ace gene. The copy number of Lines A, C, and D was determined to be four, two, and eight, respectively. Sibling matings were then performed between Ace +/−, Ps+/− mice to generate the Ace −/−, Ps +/− male experimental mice used in the fertility analysis (Fig. 2). Successful transmission of the Ps transgene was observed in Lines A, C, and D. A Western blot screen was performed to verify testes-specific expression of the Ps transgene. Fig.3 A illustrates the production of 140-kDa sACE in the testes of Lines A and C mice as detected by rabbit sACE-specific antisera. Line D, however, produced a larger ACE-like protein. The anti-rabbit ACE antisera did not cross-react with murine sACE or gACE present in the testes extracts of wild-type mice. Further tissue analysis revealed that expression of the transgene was confined to the testes. There was no expression in Line A (Ace +/−, Ps +/−) brain, blood, heart, intestine, kidney, liver, lung, or spleen. Verification of the species specificity of the antiserum was again observed. The goat polyclonal anti-rabbit ACE antisera did not detect sACE in any somatic tissue (Fig. 3 B). Because all testes contain both gACE, expressed on the sperm, and sACE, expressed in the vasculature and somatic Leydig cells, we needed to quickly determine which founders expressed enzymatically active, transgene-encoded sACE in sperm. We devised an immunoprecipitation procedure in order to selectively immunoprecipitate the transgenic rabbit ACE away from the endogenous murine ACE. Equal quantities of whole testicular extracts from transgenic and non-transgenic, age-matched mice were incubated with the rabbit ACE-specific antisera raised in goat prior to immunoprecipitation with anti-goat antibody-conjugated latex beads. Following several washes, the standard ACE enzyme assay, measuring Hip-His-Leu cleavage, was performed on the rabbit ACE tethered to the beads. Mice from Line A and Line C both expressed enzymatically active sACE, whereas Line D failed to express active ACE when compared with non-transgenic, age-matched males (Fig.4 A). Although Line D produced a protein that was recognized by the anti-ACE antisera (Fig.3 A), it was not of correct molecular mass nor was it enzymatically active. No further experimentation was performed with mice from Line D and Line C mice. Mice from Line A were used exclusively for all further analysis. We wanted to compare the levels of gACE expression in the sperm ofAce +/− mice with the corresponding level of the transgenic sACE expression in the Ace −/−, Ps +/− mice to ensure that enough of the transgenic protein was being expressed. Because an ACE antiserum that reacts with both rabbit and mouse ACE with equal avidity was not available, we used an in situligand binding assay (28Perich R.B. Jackson B. Rogerson F. Mendelsohn F.A. Paxton D. Johnston C.I. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 42: 286-293PubMed Google Scholar). In this assay, a radiolabeled angiotensin I analog (351A) was bound to testis sections, and bound radioactivity was quantitated by PhosphorImager analysis. The assay revealed that about 70-fold more probe was bound to a testis section of an Ace−/−, Ps +/− mouse than to a corresponding section of anAce +/− mouse (Fig. 4 B). Thus, the transgenic protein was expressed to a much higher level than the level of the natural proteins. As previously reported for C57Bl/6 mice, in FVB Ace −/− mice, there was no observable distortion or abnormality of the testes architecture as revealed by hematoxylin and eosin staining (not shown) (8Esther C.R. Marino E.M. Howard T.E. Machaud A. Corvol P. Capecchi M.R. Bernstein K.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2375-2385Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 11Hagaman J.R. Moyer J.S. Bachman E.S.

Consequently, the overall histology of a testes section from anAce −/−, Ps +/− mouse was indistinguishable from that of an Ace +/+ mouse (Fig.5 A, 1 and2). In contrast, the same was not true for the kidney. Compared with the kidney of a wild-t"
https://openalex.org/W1914674710,"The NF-kappaB family of transcription factors regulates diverse cellular functions such as immune response and cell growth and development, and has been reported to be constitutively active in a variety of mammary carcinoma cell lines. However, its role in normal mammary gland development has not been addressed. In our study, we detected developmentally regulated NF-kappaB activity in the mammary gland of mice. During pregnancy, DNA binding activity of NF-kappaB p50/p65 increased until day 16 postcoitum and decreased with the onset of lactation, most likely due to reduced p50 and p65 protein levels in the nucleus. Cotransfection experiments performed with 293 cells revealed an inhibition of the prolactin receptor/JAK2/STAT5 pathway by NF-kappaB. In HC11 cells, NF-kappaB p50/p65 activity was inversely correlated with prolactin-induced STAT5 tyrosine phosphorylation, expression of endogenous beta-casein gene, and of a transfected beta-casein gene promoter reporter construct. This indicates a negative cross talk between NF-kappaB and the prolactin receptor/JAK2/STAT5 activation pathway, which occurs at the level of STAT5 tyrosine phosphorylation. Our results provide evidence for a role of NF-kappaB in normal mammary gland development, and indicate its function as a negative regulator of beta-casein gene expression during pregnancy by interfering with STAT5 tyrosine phosphorylation."

It was our aim to understand the molecular interactions between amebic trophozoites and enterocytes during the early steps of invasion. Trophozoites of E. histolytica strain HM1:IMSS were seeded on the apical side of enteric T84 cell layers, which were established on filters in two-compartment culture chambers. Cocultures were analyzed for paracellular permeability by measurement of transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) and for the tight junction proteins ZO-1, ZO-2, occludin, and cingulin by immunocytochemistry and immunoprecipitation. On direct contact with the apical side of the enteric cells, trophozoites caused an increase in paracellular permeability as evidenced by a decrease of TER associated with an increase in [(3)H]mannitol flux. Immunoprecipitation of cocultures revealed dephosphorylation of ZO-2, loss of ZO-1 from ZO-2, and degradation of ZO-1 but less so of ZO-2 and none of occludin or E-cadherin. In conclusion, trophozoite-associated increase in paracellular permeability of enteric cell layers is ascribed to disturbance of the molecular organization of tight junction proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2099836083,"Apoptosis is a cell suicide mechanism that requires the activation of cellular death proteases for its induction. We examined whether the progress of apoptosis involves cleavage of phospholipase C-gamma1 (PLC-gamma1), which plays a pivotal role in mitogenic signaling pathway. Pretreatment of T leukemic Molt-4 cells with PLC inhibitors such as U-73122 or ET-18-OCH(3) potentiated etoposide-induced apoptosis in these cells. PLC-gamma1 was fragmented when Molt-4 cells were treated with several apoptotic stimuli such as etoposide, ceramides, and tumor necrosis factor alpha. Cleavage of PLC-gamma1 was blocked by overexpression of Bcl-2 and by specific inhibitors of caspases such as Z-DEVD-CH(2)F and YVAD-cmk. Purified caspase-3 and caspase-7, group II caspases, cleaved PLC-gamma1 in vitro and generated a cleavage product of the same size as that observed in vivo, suggesting that PLC-gamma1 is cleaved by group II caspases in vivo. From point mutagenesis studies, Ala-Glu-Pro-Asp(770) was identified to be a cleavage site within PLC-gamma1. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) -induced tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-gamma1 resulted in resistance to cleavage by caspase-3 in vitro. Furthermore, cleaved PLC-gamma1 could not be tyrosine-phosphorylated by EGFR in vitro. In addition, tyrosine-phosphorylated PLC-gamma1 was not significantly cleaved during etoposide-induced apoptosis in Molt-4 cells. This suggests that the growth factor-induced tyrosine phosphorylation may suppress apoptosis-induced fragmentation of PLC-gamma1. We provide evidence for the biochemical relationship between PLC-gamma1-mediated signal pathway and apoptotic signal pathway, indicating that the defect of PLC-gamma1-mediated signaling pathway can facilitate an apoptotic progression."
https://openalex.org/W2152077121,"The catecholamine-mediated modulation of the cytokine network has primarily been demonstrated for leukocytes. Whereas catecholamines decrease the LPS-induced production of IL-6 by leukocytes, serum levels of IL-6 are dramatically increased by the catecholamine epinephrine in animal endotoxemia models. We now demonstrate that epinephrine as well as norepinephrine can induce IL-6 in an endothelial cell line (HMEC-1). Furthermore, these catecholamines could even potentiate the LPS-induced IL-6 protein production. The synergistic effect of catecholamines and LPS could be reproduced in primary human skin microvascular endothelial cells. The catecholamine-induced IL-6 stimulation is based on increased IL-6 mRNA levels. RNA stability assays revealed that this regulation is not a result of enhanced RNA stability and therefore is most likely due to an increased transcription. Treatment with cycloheximide indicated that new protein synthesis is not necessary for this transcriptional up-regulation of IL-6 mRNA. Preincubation with alpha and beta receptor antagonists showed that the effect is mediated by beta(1)- and beta(2)-adrenergic receptors. Thus, endothelial cells might be a possible source of increased IL-6 production observed in situations such as stress or septic shock, in which catecholamines are elevated due to endogenous production or exogenous application."

https://openalex.org/W2005899779,"G protein-activated inwardly rectifying potassium channels (Kir3) are widely expressed throughout the brain, and regulation of their activity modifies neuronal excitability and synaptic transmission. In this study, we show that the neurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), through activation of TrkB receptors, strongly inhibited the basal activity of Kir3. This inhibition was subunit dependent as functional homomeric channels of either Kir3.1 or Kir3.4 were significantly inhibited, whereas homomeric channels composed of Kir3.2 were insensitive. The general tyrosine kinase inhibitors genistein, Gö 6976, and K252a but not the serine/threonine kinase inhibitor staurosporine blocked the BDNF-induced inhibition of the channel. BDNF was also found to directly stimulate channel phosphorylation because Kir3.1 immunoprecipitated from BDNF-stimulated cells showed enhanced labeling by anti-phosphotyrosine-specific antibodies. The BDNF effect required specific tyrosine residues in the amino terminus of Kir3.1 and Kir3.4 channels. Mutations of either Tyr-12, Tyr-67, or both in Kir3.1 or mutation of either Tyr-32, Tyr-53, or both of Kir3.4 channels to phenylalanine significantly blocked the BDNF-induced inhibition. The insensitive Kir3.2 was made sensitive to BDNF by adding a tyrosine (D41Y) and a lysine (P32K) upstream to generate a phosphorylation site motif analogous to that present in Kir3.4.

Black I.B. Plummer M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8074-8077Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). These studies suggest that BDNF has direct effects on ion channel properties to modulate synaptic activity. The neurotrophin receptors are transmembrane tyrosine kinases, and BDNF activation of the TrkB receptor is known to initiate a cascade of phosphorylation events that activate a complex of signaling proteins (10Greene L.A. Kaplan D.R. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1995; 5: 579-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Tyrosine kinases directly phosphorylate ion channels to provide rapid regulation of neuronal excitability (11Hilborn M.D. Vaillancourt R.R. Rane S.G. J.

Curr. Opin.

Similarly, phosphorylation of serine residues in the amino terminus of a different delayed rectifying potassium channel Kv3.4 causes channel inactivation (21Covarrubias M. Wei A. Salkoff L. Vyas T.B. Neuron. 1994; 13: 1403-1412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Additionally, tyrosine phosphorylation of other potassium channels may regulate neuronal excitability. Because G protein-coupled receptor activation of Kir3 type potassium channels is one of the major mechanisms controlling neuronal excitability, we explored the hypothesis that BDNF regulation of Kir3 may control neuronal excitability by modulation of these channels. Our results show that BDNF inhibits basal Kir3 channel activity and define specific tyrosine phosphorylation sites in the amino terminus of Kir3 that are important for channel inhibition caused by TrkB activation. cDNAs for the Kir3.1 (GIRK 1) (GenBank accession no.

Mutations were introduced by polymerase chain reaction amplification usingPfu Turbo DNA polymerase with complementary oligonucleotide primers incorporating the desired mutation. Positive clones were confirmed by automated sequencing. Plasmid templates for constructs were linearized prior to in vitro mRNA synthesis (24Dascal N. Schreibmayer W. Lim N.F. Wang W. Chavkin C.

Healthy stage V and VI oocytes were harvested from mature anesthetized Xenopus laevis (Xenopus Express, Gainesville, FL) and defolliculated enzymatically as described (25Snutch T.P. Trends Neurosci. 1988; 11: 250-256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The oocytes were maintained at 18 °C in standard oocyte buffer (ND96: 96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2 1 mmMgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.5) supplemented with 2.5 mm sodium pyruvate and 50 μg/ml gentamicin (Sigma). One day after harvest, each oocyte was injected with 50 nl of mRNA for the TrkB receptor, and either G protein inwardly rectifying potassium channel heteromultimers Kir3.1 and Kir3.2, Kir3.1 and Kir3.4, or homomers Kir3.1(F137S), Kir3.2(S146T), or Kir3.4(S143T) into the vegetal pole. Recordings were made at least 48 h after cRNA injection. Two electrode voltage clamp recordings were made at −80 mV in hK buffer (2 mm NaCl, 24 or 96 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.5). X. laevis oocytes were injected with 10 ng of Kir3.1, 1 ng of Kir3.4, and 0.08 ng of TrkB mRNA. After 4 days of protein expression, groups of 25 oocytes received either ND96 or BDNF treatment (400 ng/ml) for 15 min and were then frozen at −70 °C. Oocyte membranes were extracted with 100 μl of solubilization buffer (1% SDS, 25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA), plus general protease inhibitors (1 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml apoprotein, 200 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor perorthovanadate (1 mm). The preheated (55 °C) solubilization solution was applied to frozen intact oocytes for oocyte membrane solubilization and agitated until the outer surface pigment layer was removed. This unpublished method was developed by Abraham Kovoor while a member of the Chavkin laboratory. To immunoprecipitate Kir3.1, the oocyte membrane protein was incubated with 35 μg of an affinity-purified antibody directed against carboxyl-terminal residues 482–498 of rKir3.1 (26Bausch S.B. Patterson T.A. Ehrengruber M.U. Lester H.A. Davidson N. Chavkin C. Receptors Channels. 1995; 3: 221-241PubMed Google Scholar). The membrane/antibody complex was precipitated with 7.5 mg of Protein A-Sepharose, washed three times with radioimmunoassay buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mmEDTA, 1% Triton X-100), and washed once with 15 mm Tris, pH 7.4, each containing protease inhibitors and perorthovanadate as described above. The immunoprecipitate was extracted using sample buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 500 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 10% glycerol). The protein samples were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to 0.2-μm nitrocellulose membranes, and then blocked overnight in 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline. Membranes were first blotted with a biotin-conjugated PY:20 anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (1:7500 dilution, ICN Biomedical), followed by a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated avidin secondary antibody (ICN Biomedical). Immunoreactivity was visualized using ECL detection methods (NEN Life Science Products). The results shown were replicated three times. Genistein, staurosporine, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), and Me2SO were from Sigma. Gö 6976 and K252a were obtained from Calbiochem, San Diego, CA. U69,593 was obtained from Research Biochemicals International. Pfu Turbo was from Stratagene, La Jolla, CA. PMA, Gö 6976, genistein, and K252a were dissolved in Me2SO; the final concentration of Me2SO applied to the oocytes was ∼0.02%. BDNF (Amgen, Thousand Oaks, CA) was dissolved in water and stored at −70 °C until use. Data are presented as means ± S.E. Statistical analysis was carried out using an unpairedt test. A probability of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Brief treatment ofXenopus oocytes expressing TrkB and Kir3 heteromultimers composed of either Kir3.1/3.2 or Kir3.1/3.4 with BDNF (200 ng/ml) produced a strong depression of the channel current (Fig.1). BDNF suppressed Kir3.1/3.2 by 62 ± 1% (n = 17) and Kir3.1/3.4 by 70 ± 1% (n = 16). As shown in the current-voltage curve (Fig.1 A, inset), BDNF reduced the total conductance through Kir3.1/3.2 channels; similar results were found for Kir3.1/3.4 (data not shown). The effect of BDNF required co-expression of the TrkB receptor (Fig. 1 B). The dose-response analysis (Fig.1 C) showed that the potency of BDNF in this system (EC50 = 20 ng/ml) was consistent with prior findings (27Sadick M.D. Galloway A. Shelton D. Hale V. Weck S. Anicetti V. Wong W.L. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 234: 354-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). TrkB activation results in an increase in tyrosine kinase activity and the subsequent activation of a cascade of kinase effectors (10Greene L.A. Kaplan D.R. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1995; 5: 579-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). To determine if the suppression of the Kir3 current was initiated by the tyrosine kinase activity, oocytes were pretreated for 25 min with the nonspecific tyrosine kinase inhibitor Gö 6976 (100 nm) (28Behrens M.M. Strasser U. Choi D.W. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 919-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), genistein (100 μm) (29Akiyama T. Ishida J. Nakagawa S. Ogawara H. Watanabe S. Itoh N. Shibuya M. Fukami Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5592-5595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or K252a (20 μm) (30Ueda H. Miyamae T. Fukushima N. Misu Y. Neuroreport. 1994; 5: 1985-1988Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) prior to treatment with BDNF and inhibitor. Pretreatment with Gö 6976 completely blocked the effects of BDNF. Similarly, genistein or K252a pretreatment also completely blocked the effects of BDNF treatment. In contrast, the serine/threonine kinase inhibitor staurosporine (1 μm) was ineffective (Fig.2). The results suggest that the BDNF-induced suppression of the Kir3 current required activation of the tyrosine kinase, but not an intervening serine/threonine phosphorylation event. The BDNF-induced suppression could either result from a direct phosphorylation of Kir3 or an indirect effect on channel activation mechanisms. The Kir3 channels normally assemble as heteromultimers. To advance our analysis of the mechanism, we next determined if the channels formed from subunits of single Kir3 isoforms were sensitive to the BDNF effect. To do this, we used the strategy developed by Logothetis and colleagues (22Chan K.W. Sui J.L. Vivadou M. Logothetis D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14193-14198Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 23Vivadou M. Chan K.W. Sui J. Jan L. Reuveny E. Logothetis D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31553-31560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) to generate functional homomeric Kir3 channels. Mutations in the putative pore of these channels, Kir3.1(F137S) and Kir3.4(S143T) greatly increased expression and activity of the channel homomers. We generated a point mutation in Kir3.2(S146T), and we found that this change also increased current compared with wild-type Kir3.2, which normally forms a homomeric channel. Moreover, the point mutation of Kir3.2(S146T) served as a control, as this change was similar to Kir3.1(F137S) and Kir3.4(S143T). The homomeric Kir3.1(F137S) was as strongly inhibited by BDNF treatment as was the Kir.3.1/3.2 heteromeric channel (Fig.3 A). The homomeric Kir3.4(S143T) was also highly sensitive to BDNF treatment. In contrast, neither wild-type Kir3.2 nor Kir3.2(S146T) were affected by BDNF treatment. The channel type selectivity evident from this experiment supports the hypothesis that the BDNF-induced suppression of the current was caused by a direct modification of the channel. Because protein kinase C activation also suppresses Kir3 conductance (31Rogalski S.L. Cyr C. Chavkin C. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 1409-1416Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 32Sharon D. Vorobiov D. Dascal N. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 477-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), we compared the effects of BDNF with those of PMA. Control oocytes expressing Kir3.1(F137S), Kir3.2(S146T), or Kir3.4(S143T) homomeric channels were compared with matched oocytes preincubated in PMA (100 nm, 10–15 min). PMA produced significant inhibition of the potassium current for all three channels (Fig.3 B). The lack of selectivity of PMA effects contrasts sharply with BDNF. Thus, we conclude that the channel subtype-specific effects of TrkB activation were not mediated by protein kinase C activation. This is consistent with the lack of effect of staurosporine described above. To test the hypothesis that the activated TrkB had a direct effect on the Kir3 channel, cells expressing TrkB and Kir3.1/3.4 were either pretreated with BDNF (400 ng/ml, 15 min) or pretreated in vehicle. Membrane proteins were solubilized, and equivalent amounts of protein were immunoprecipitated with an affinity-purified antibody against Kir3.1 (26Bausch S.B. Patterson T.A. Ehrengruber M.U. Lester H.A. Davidson N. Chavkin C. Receptors Channels. 1995; 3: 221-241PubMed Google Scholar). A 45-kDa protein band corresponding to the immunoprecipitated Kir3.1 showed a substantial increase in phosphotyrosine immunoreactivity following BDNF treatment. The 45-kDa band was not evident in the lane loaded with an equal amount of Kir3.1 isolated from untreated oocytes expressing Kir3.1/Kir3.4 and Trk B (Fig. 4). These results suggest that BDNF-induced TrkB activation causes direct tyrosine phosphorylation of the Kir3.1 subunit of the channel. Potential sites of tyrosine phosphorylation in the Kir3 sequence were first studied by making an amino-terminal truncation of Kir3.4(S143T) (Fig.5). Using a polymerase chain reaction-based amplification, we prepared a cDNA template for mRNA encoding a Kir3.4(S143T) lacking amino acid residues 1–57. Oocytes expressing the truncated Kir3.4(S143T) produced strong potassium currents that were not significantly (p > 0.05) suppressed by BDNF treatment. After BDNF treatment, the mean current was 90 ± 11% (n = 8) of control compared with untreated oocytes expressing truncated Kir3.4(S143T) (Fig.6 A). Two tyrosine residues within the Kir3.4 affected by the amino-terminal truncation and are noted as potential phosphorylation sites A and B (Fig.5 B).Figure 6The effect of mutation of Tyr in the amino terminus of Kir3 .4(S143T) and Kir3 .1(F137S). A, oocytes were injected with 0.004 ng of TrkB and the following: 0.05 ng of Kir3.4(S143T), 0.05 ng of Kir3.4(S143T/Del 1–57), 1 ng of Kir3.4(S143T/Y32F), 1 ng of Kir3.4(S143T/Y53F), or 1 ng of Kir3.4(S143T/Y32F/Y53F).

Oocytes were presoaked for 10–15 min BDNF (200 ng/ml). Bar graph summarizes the effect of BDNF on homomeric channels compared with its own control from that day's matched group. Data are means ± S.E. from 4–7 oocytes and two to three independent experiments (*, p < 0.05) (ϕ t test with value compared with untreated, control oocytes: p < 0.05).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Using a sequence alignment program (BCM Search Launcher, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX), we compared the sequence motifs surrounding site A of Kir3.1, Kir3.2, and Kir3.4. Sequence alignment analysis indicated that Kir3.1 and Kir3.4 both have tyrosine residues in the amino terminus that align with aspartic acid 41 of Kir3.2 (Fig.5 B). A tyrosine was present in all three channels in site B (Fig. 5 B). To test whether either or both tyrosine residues of Kir3.1 and Kir3.4 were sites of BDNF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation, tyrosine residues 12 and 67 in the Kir3.1 sequence and 32 and 53 in the Kir3.4 sequence were mutated to phenylalanine. In contrast to the Kir3.4(S143T), BDNF did not significantly (p < 0.05) inhibit the conductance of Kir3.4(S143T/Y32F) (Fig. 6 A). After BDNF treatment, the current was 80 ± 14% (n = 14) of the untreated current, not significantly different from control currents 100 ± 23% (n = 8) (p > 0.05). The same loss of BDNF sensitivity was observed with channels having tyrosine 32 mutated to aspartic acid to produce Kir3.4(S143T/Y32D) (data not shown). Mutation of the other tyrosine in the amino terminus of Kir3.4(S143T/Y53F) also significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the sensitivity to BDNF; BDNF treatment caused only a reduction to 74 ± 5% (n = 11) of the control, untreated currents. As expected, the deletion of both amino-terminal tyrosines to produce Kir3.4(S143T/Y32F/Y53F) also significantly blocked (p < 0.05) the effect of BDNF treatment 112 ± 8% (n = 15) (Fig. 6 A). These results suggest that tyrosine residues in both of these sites in the amino terminus of Kir3.4 (S143T) are critical for sensitivity to BDNF and are likely sites of tyrosine phosphorylation on Kir3.4. For the Kir3.1(F137S) homomeric channel, mutation of tyrosine 12 to phenylalanine, Kir3.1(F137S/Y12F), completely blocked the BDNF effect 95 ± 12% (n = 23) (Fig. 6 B). Mutation of tyrosine 67, Kir3.1(F137S/Y67F), effectively reduced the BDNF effect. After BDNF treatment, the current through Kir3.1(F137S/Y67F) was 78 ± 4% (n = 16) (p < 0.05). Deletion of both tyrosines from the amino terminus to produce Kir3.1(F137S/Y12F/Y67F) also completely blocked the BDNF effect; current was 75 ± 7% (n = 12) after treatment with BDNF, a result not significantly different than the single point mutations (p < 0.05) (Fig. 6 B). The results suggest that TrkB-induced phosphorylation of either Tyr-12 or Tyr-67 in Kir3.1 mediated the BDNF effect on the channel. Removal of the tyrosines 12 and 67 of Kir3.1 did not block the substantial increase in phosphotyrosine immunoreactivity after BDNF treatment (data not shown). Because Kir3.1 has 14 potential sites for tyrosine phosphorylation, the data suggest that alternative tyrosine phosphorylation events must be occurring that does not affect channel conductance. To determine the basis for Kir3.2(S146T) insensitivity to BDNF, the sequences of Kir3.2 and Kir3.4 were compared (Fig. 5 B). An aspartic acid in the BDNF-insensitive channel Kir3.2(S146T) (Asp-41) aligned with the tyrosine in the BDNF-sensitive Kir3.4(S146T) (Tyr-32). Unexpectedly, the mutation of aspartic acid to tyrosine to produce Kir3.2(S146T/D41Y) did not confer sensitivity to BDNF (Fig.7). The presence of proline 32 in site A of Kir3.2 instead of a lysine as in Kir3.4 (Fig. 5 B) was a potentially significant difference between the two channels. Consistent with other tyrosine phosphorylation motifs (33Songyang Z. Cantley L.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 11: 470-475Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (329) Google Scholar), the positively charged lysine Kir3.4 (Lys-23) may be permissive for a tyrosine phosphorylation event on Kir3.4. In confirmation of this hypothesis, the conductance of Kir3.2(S146T/P32K/D41Y) was reduced by BDNF 40 ± 7% (n = 33) (p < 0.05) (Fig. 7). To further test that the charged lysine residue conferred sensitivity to Kir3.2 (D41Y), we mutated the proline to alanine. Kir3.2(P32A/D41Y) was not sensitive to BDNF (data not shown). The results thus help to define the motif required for BDNF sensitivity; two tyrosine residues in the amino terminus combined with a nearby cluster of positively charged residues seem to be required. A reduction in channel conductance may be caused either by reduced current through existing channels or by loss of channel from the plasma membrane. To distinguish between these two alternatives, we tested the effects of channel activation by G protein-coupled receptor stimulation. We expressed the rat κ opioid receptor (KOR), TrkB, Kir3.1, and Kir3.4 heteromultimers (34Appleyard S.M. Celver J. Pineda V. Kovoor A. Wayman G.A. Chavkin C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23802-23807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 35Henry D.J. Grandy D.K. Lester H.A. Davidson N. Chavkin C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 551-557PubMed Google Scholar). Pretreatment with BDNF inhibited the channel conductance as shown previously (Fig.8). In contrast, the stimulation of Kir3 current by a maximally effective concentration of the κ receptor by U69,593 was not inhibited by BDNF pretreatment (Fig. 8). The results suggest that BDNF-induced phosphorylation shifts the channel from a basally active to a basally inactive state but does not prevent Gβγ activation of the channel. The principal finding of these studies is that activation of TrkB by BDNF produces a robust inhibition of the G protein-gated inwardly rectifying potassium channel (Kir3). These results support the conclusion that Kir3.1 and Kir3.4 required phosphorylation at two sites in the amino terminus; removal of either blocked BDNF inhibition. The data suggest that the related channel, Kir3.2, was insensitive to BDNF-induced inhibition because Kir3.2 has only a single tyrosine site in the amino terminus. As shown by immunoblot and channel mutagenesis results, channel inhibition was likely caused by direct channel phosphorylation on conserved tyrosine residues in the amino terminus of Kir3.1 and Kir3.4. These novel findings suggest that a component of BDNF action on neuronal excitability may include the regulation of G protein receptor signaling. The resulting increase in excitability could contribute to the increases in synaptic plasticity and neurotransmitter release observed in the intact neuronal preparations (36Berninger B. Poo M.M. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1996; 6: 324-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 37Lessmann V. Gottmann K. Heumann R. Neuroreport. 1994; 6: 21-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). In the mutagenesis studies described, we found that two tyrosine residues in the Kir3.4 sequence (Tyr-32 and Tyr-53) and two tyrosine residues in the Kir3.1 sequence (Tyr-12 and Tyr-67) were required for sensitivity to BDNF. Phosphorylation of other tyrosine residues in Kir3 channels was not responsible for BDNF-induced inhibition. The lack of sensitivity of Kir3.2 to BDNF inhibition was a striking finding that helped to define a potential consensus site. Because Kir3.2 contains a tyrosine residue surrounded by nearly the same motif as evident in Kir3.1 and Kir3.4 (Fig. 5, site B), we predicted that it should be phosphorylated following TrkB activation. By introducing a second tyrosine phosphorylation site in the amino terminus of Kir3.2 and adding an essential basic charge near the phosphorylation site, Kir3.2 became sensitive to BDNF inhibition. We suggest that the change in charge created by the consensus site mutant enhanced the ability of tyrosine kinase to phosphorylate the Kir3.2(D41Y) tyrosine mutation. This reinforces the idea that tyrosine kinase phosphorylation is dependent upon charge interactions surrounding the phosphorylation site (33Songyang Z. Cantley L.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 11: 470-475Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 38Songyang Z. Carraway III, K.L. Eck M.J. Harrison S.C. Feldman R.A. Mohammadi M. Schlessinger J. Hubbard S.R. Smith D.P. Eng C. Lorenzo M.J. Ponder B.A.J. Mayer B.J. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1995; 373: 536-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar). Alternatively, Kir3.2 may be insensitive because the phosphorylation site (Fig.5 B) does not interact with a complementary domain required for channel inhibition. A clearer understanding of the biophysical basis for the phosphotyrosine inhibition of the channel conductance is required before we can understand why Kir3.2 is insensitive to BDNF inhibition. As is evident from the surrounding sequences, all three BDNF-sensitive Kir3 channels have charged amino acids (aspartic acid or arginine) on the amino side of the tyrosine and a hydrophobic residue on the carboxyl side. This general motif is characteristic of other sites phosphorylated by protein tyrosine kinases (33Songyang Z. Cantley L.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 11: 470-475Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 38Songyang Z. Carraway III, K.L. Eck M.J. Harrison S.C. Feldman R.A. Mohammadi M. Schlessinger J. Hubbard S.R. Smith D.P. Eng C. Lorenzo M.J. Ponder B.A.J. Mayer B.J. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1995; 373: 536-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar); however, the motif is not sufficiently specific to allow the identification of the kinase involved. Although the specific kinase mediating the Kir3 inhibition was not defined in this study, the Src tyrosine kinase, Fyn, which is present in oocytes, associates with TrkB and mediates some of the tyrosine phosphorylation events following TrkB activation (39Iwasaki Y. Gay B. Wada K. Koizumi S.J. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 106-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The conductance of the G protein-gated inwardly rectifying potassium channel is controlled by a wide range of regulatory factors, as would be expected for a ubiquitous channel having a key role in the regulation of neuronal excitability. Kir3 is activated by Gβγ, phosphotidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), and sodium binding and inhibited by protein kinase phosphorylation (40Dascal N.

Logothetis and colleagues suggest that PIP2 binding generally regulates the inwardly rectifying potassium channels; the Kir3 channel interaction with PIP2 additionally requires both sodium and Gβγ binding to the carboxyl terminus of the channel (41Zhang H. He C. Yan X. Mirshahi T. Logothetis D.E. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 3: 183-188Crossref Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Our results show that U69,593 activation of the κ opioid receptor, which acts by increasing Gβγ concentration, overcomes the basal inhibition of the conductance caused by BDNF treatment. This result shows that the tyrosine phosphorylated Kir3 channel still can be activated by PIP2, sodium, and Gβγ binding. We suggest that BDNF-induced phosphorylation of Kir3 causes a conformational change in the channel that reduces the ability of intrinsic activators to basally activate the channel. The observation that Gβγ, increased by κ receptor activation, can overcome the BDNF effect suggests that the inhibition by phosphorylation is independent of the activation by endogenous regulators PIP2, sodium, and Gβγ. Evidence suggests that growth factors have diverse effects on ion channels. For example, nerve growth factor regulates both the number and distribution of delayed rectifying K+ channels in PC 12 cells (42Sharma N. D'Arcangelo G. Kleinklaus A. Halegoua S. Trimmer J.S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1835-1843Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). However, growth factors can also have extremely selective effects on ion channels. The growth factors FGF1 and FGF2 have opposing effects in the regulation of Kir in cardiac myocytes via distinct second messenger pathways (43Chauhan-Patel R. Spruce A.E. J. Physiol. 1998; 512: 109-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Our data demonstrate that the growth factor BDNF selectively modulates Kir3 through a unique pathway. That growth factors can control both ion channel distribution and regulation suggests that BDNF modulation of Kir3 may be a determinant in synaptic transmission. The results in this study suggest an additional mechanism for BDNF regulation of ion channel conductance, an important mechanism regulating neuronal excitability. Our analysis utilized a malleable expression system to define a novel regulatory mechanism and predict a physiological relationship between neurotrophin action and potassium channel function.

However, the sequence of events leading to the development of insulin signaling defects and the significance of decreased GLUT4 expression in causing adipocyte insulin resistance are unknown. The present study used male heterozygous GLUT4 knockout mice (GLUT4(+/-)) as a novel model of diabetes to study the development of insulin signaling defects in adipocytes with the progression of whole body insulin resistance and diabetes. Male GLUT4(+/-) mice with normal fed glycemia and insulinemia (N/N), normal fed glycemia and hyperinsulinemia (N/H), and fed hyperglycemia with hyperinsulinemia (H/H) exist at all ages. The expression of GLUT4 protein and the maximal insulin-stimulated glucose transport was 50% decreased in adipocytes from all three groups. Insulin signaling was normal in N/N adipose cells. From 35 to 70% reductions in insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IR, IRS-1, and pp60/IRS-3 were noted with no changes in the cellular content of IR, IRS-1, and p85 in N/H adipocytes. Insulin-stimulated protein tyrosine phosphorylation was further decreased to 12-23% in H/H adipose cells accompanied by 42% decreased IR and 80% increased p85 expression. Insulin-stimulated, IRS-1-associated PI3 kinase activity was decreased by 20% in N/H and 68% reduced in H/H GLUT4(+/-) adipocytes. However, total insulin-stimulated PI3 kinase activity was normal in H/H GLUT4(+/-) adipocytes. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that hyperinsulinemia triggers a reduction of IR tyrosine kinase activity that is further exacerbated by the appearance of hyperglycemia. However, the insulin signaling cascade has sufficient plasticity to accommodate significant changes in specific components without further reducing glucose uptake. Furthermore, the data indicate that the cellular content of GLUT4 is the rate-limiting factor in mediating maximal insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in GLUT4(+/-) adipocytes."

The presequence dramatically altered SCP-2 structure as determined by circular dichroism, mass spectroscopy, and antibody accessibility such that pro-SCP-2 had 3-fold less α-helix, 7-fold more β-structure, 6-fold more reactive C terminus to carboxypeptidase A, 2-fold less binding of anti-SCP-2, and did not enhance sterol transfer from plasma membranes. These differences were not due to protein stability since (i) the same concentration of guanidine hydrochloride was required for 50% unfolding, and (ii) the ligand binding sites displayed the same high affinity (nanomolar K d values) in the order: cholesterol ≫ straight chain fatty acid > kinked chain fatty acid. Laser scanning confocal microscopy and double immunofluorescence demonstrated that pro-SCP-2 was more efficiently targeted to peroxisomes.

However, resolving the relative roles of SCP-2 in cholesterol versus fatty acid metabolism has been complicated by the fact that neither the function of the 20-amino acid presequence in 15-kDa pro-SCP-2, the primary SCP-2 gene product, nor how it affects the intracellular targeting of this protein are yet known. Further, little is known about the structure and function pro-SCP-2 because it is posttranslationally completely cleaved to the mature SCP-2 in all tissues examined (reviewed in Ref. 2Schroeder F.

SCP-2 was originally isolated from liver and other tissues as a 13-kDa soluble protein whose amino acid sequence did not identify any consensus sequences targeting SCP-2 to specific intracellular organelle(s), suggesting a primarily cytosolic localization (11Pastuszyn A.

In contrast, cDNA sequencing revealed that the two SCP-2 gene products, 58-kDa SCP-x and 15-kDa pro-SCP-2, as well as the mature 13-kDa SCP-2 contained an C-terminal SKL peroxisomal targeting sequence, thereby suggesting an exclusive peroxisomal localization (reviewed in Refs. 2Schroeder F.

However, immunogold electron microscopy and immunofluorescence imaging showed that, whereas SCP-x appears almost exclusively peroxisomal, the intracellular localization of SCP-2 is more complex with over half of the total SCP-2 being extraperoxisomal where it is localized diffusely in the cytoplasm as well as associated with endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria (reviewed in Refs. 2Schroeder F.

The fact that the SCP-x and SCP-2 did not copurify with peroxisomes (catalase) in subcellular fractionation further supported differential intracellular distribution of SCP-2 in the cell. These studies suggest that the 20-amino acid presequence of the pro-SCP-2 may function in some manner to modify the intracellular targeting of this gene product and thereby account for dual functions of SCP-2 gene products in both fatty acid and sterol metabolism. Consistent with this possibility, transfection of cells with the cDNA encoding pro-SCP-2 (8Moncecchi D.M. Murphy E.J. Prows D.R. Schroeder F. Biochim. Biophys.

Furthermore, in SCP-2 gene ablated mice (missing all SCP-2 gene products), not only is peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation deranged, liver cholesterol ester and triacylglycerol contents are also decreased 2-fold (7Seedorf U.

These findings are consistent with a potential role for SCP-2 in both peroxisomal and extraperoxisomal cholesterol and/or fatty acid metabolism. In summary, except for the 20-amino acid N-terminal presequence present in the pro-SCP-2, both pro-SCP-2 and SCP-2 are identical and contain the same C-terminal SKL peroxisomal targeting sequence. The purpose of the present investigation was to determine the potential role(s) of the 20-amino acid presequence of pro-SCP-2 in modulating the structure, function, and intracellular targeting of SCP-2. The latter question gains additional importance since analysis of the pro-SCP-2 20-amino acid N-terminal presequence by a recognition program (e.g.PSORT II) reveals 89% similarity and 83% identity to mitochondrial targeting sequences.

Rabbit and rat anti-13-kDa SCP-2 polyclonal antibodies were the primary antibodies for detecting SCP-2 in the cells.

As indicated in the Introduction, there are no available data explaining the differential effects of expressing the pro-SCP-2 versus SCP-2 on cholesterol and fatty acid uptake, intracellular trafficking, and metabolism in transfected cells. If these proteins differed in secondary structure conformation, this could affect their relative targeting to peroxisomes via their C-terminal SKL peroxisomal targeting sequences. However, other than its cDNA-derived primary amino acid sequence, nothing is known regarding secondary or tertiary structure of pro-SCP-2. Therefore, the secondary structure of pro-SCP-2 and SCP-2 were determined by circular dichroism. The circular dichroic spectra of pro-SCP-2 and SCP-2 differed dramatically. SCP-2 circular dichroic spectra displayed strong minima at 208 and 225 nm and one maximum at 193 nm, consistent with the presence of significant α-helical secondary structure (Fig.1 A, triangles). In contrast, pro-SCP-2 circular dichroic spectra (Fig. 1 A,squares) were attenuated 4–5-fold in intensity and were more asymmetrical in shape as compared with that of SCP-2. Quantitative analysis of the spectra, determined as described under “Experimental Procedures,” provided a high accuracy assessment for the following secondary structures: α-helix (H), 310-helix (G), β-strand (E), turn (T), and poly(l-proline)II type 31-helix (P). All other structures unresolved by this algorithm are designated as “other” (O). The experimental and theoretical fits of the spectra were nearly superimposable (data not shown). Pro-SCP-2 had less than 20% helical structure (H + G +P in Fig. 1 B, black bars). The predominant components in the secondary structure of pro-SCP-2 were β-turn and β-strand, which represent about 40% of its structure (E + T in Fig. 1 C, black bars). In marked contrast, SCP-2 was predominantly helical structured, with the total helix fractions being approximately 50% (H + G + P in Fig. 1 B,shaded bars) and only about 20% β-structure (E + T in Fig. 1 C, shaded bars). Both proteins contained about the same fraction of unresolved structures (O in Fig. 1 C). In summary, the presence of the N-terminal 20-amino acid presequence in pro-SCP-2 dramatically altered the secondary structure. The relative stability of 15-kDa pro-SCP-2 and 13-kDa SCP-2 to guanidine-HCl-induced unfolding was determined by monitoring the reduction of circular dichroism at 222 nm, as indicated under “Experimental Procedures.” At increasing guanidine-HCl, the negative molar ellipticity [θ]225 of SCP-2 (Fig.2 A) and pro-SCP-2 (Fig.2 B) was markedly reduced. The concentration of guanidine-HCl required for 50% unfolding, 0.80 and 0.82 m, respectively, did not differ between the two proteins. Plots of the observed free energy change ΔG obs versusguanidine-HCl concentration for both proteins were linear (Fig. 2,A (inset) and B (inset)) and allowed calculation of the Gibbs free energy change ΔG0 in the absence of denaturant, 14.7 and 14.9 kJ/mol, respectively, for the two proteins. These data indicate that pro-SCP-2 and SCP-2 did not differ in stability. Since circular dichroism revealed that the presence of the 20-amino acid N-terminal presequence dramatically altered the secondary structure of the protein, it was important to determine if this also resulted in modified tertiary structure. Polyclonal antisera against the SCP-2 reacted similarly with unfolded pro-SCP-2 and SCP-2 as determined by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting (data not shown). In contrast, when the proteins were examined by dot blotting, they differed markedly (Fig. 3). Visual examination of the dot blots revealed that the anti-SCP-2 antisera reacted more strongly at all concentrations tested with SCP-2 as compared with equimolar pro-SCP-2. This effect was even more pronounced than observed with the SCP-x (Fig. 3), the other SCP-2 gene product whose C-terminal 13-kDa polypeptide is identical to SCP-2. These differences in accessibility of the surface epitopes of SCP-2 and pro-SCP-2 were not likely due to differences in unfolding on preparation of the dot blots because these proteins exhibited nearly identical stability (Fig. 2, A andB). In order to more specifically determine the relative surface exposure of the C-terminal SKL peroxisomal targeting sequence, SCP-2 gene products as well as several other known peroxisomal proteins were probed with commercially available antisera generated against a peptide (NH2-CRYHLKPLQSKL-COOH) containing the C-terminal SKL peroxisomal targeting sequence 1 (PTS 1). The last 9 amino acids of this peptide corresponded to the C terminus of rat peroxisomal proteins (acyl-CoA oxidase and hydratase-dehydrogenase bifunctional enzyme) (38Gould S.J. Krisans S.K. Keller G.A. Subramani S. J. Cell Biology. 1990; 110: 26-34Crossref Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Consistent with previous reports (38Gould S.J. Krisans S.K. Keller G.A. Subramani S. J.

SDS-PAGE and Western blotting were performed on equimolar amounts of known peroxisomal proteins: acyl-CoA oxidase (C-terminal 9 amino acids identical to the SKL peptide to which the antibodies were generated) and catalase and luciferase (sharing only the C-terminal 3 amino acids SKL with the SKL peptide to which the antibodies were generated). Although the anti-SKL antibodies detected all three unfolded peroxisomal proteins (Fig. 4, top panel), they differentially reacted with these unfolded proteins in the order: luciferase [tmt] catalase > acyl-CoA oxidase (Fig. 4,top panel). When the anti-SKL reactivity of these proteins was examined in the folded state by dot blotting (Fig. 4,bottom panel), they reacted essentially equally well as in the unfolded state (Fig. 4, top panel) and in the quantitative order: luciferase >>> catalase > acyl-CoA oxidase (not shown). These data with unfolded, as well as folded, peroxisomal proteins suggest that the large differe"

A Genetic Switch. Cell Press and Blackwell Scientific Publications, Cambridge, MA1992Google Scholar). Although the sequences recognized can be extremely diverse, most regulatory proteins naturally bind discrete target sites within the bacterial genome. However, some regulators (typically the nucleoid-associated proteins; Ref. 2Azam T.A. Ishihama A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 274: 33105-33113Google Scholar) are also known to bind somewhat degenerated sequences or structural motifs, thus spreading DNA-protein interactions along extended nucleotide sequences. This feature is shared with a variety of eukaryotic regulators, typically those containing zinc fingers such as the transcription factor TFIIIA (3Wuttke D.S. Foster M.P. Case D.A. Gottesfeld J.M. Wright P.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 183-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). In this respect, the Fur protein of Escherichia coli displays both properties found in specific transcriptional factors and those in more global regulators. Fur is the product of the fur(ferric uptake regulation) gene (4Bagg A. Neilands J.B. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 161: 450-453Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Hantke K. Mol. Gen.

But, in addition, Fur appears to play an important role also in a variety of cell functions unrelated to iron acquisition, such as the production of several virulence determinants (13Litwin M.

Calderwood S.B. Gene. 1998; 209: 65-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). These studies have revealed that every iron-dependent promoter contains a target DNA sequence with different degrees of similarity to a palindromic 5′-GATAATGATAATCATTATC-3′, 19-bp1 consensus box (26de Lorenzo V. Wee S. Herrero M. Neilands J.B. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 2624-2630Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Calderwood S. Mekalanos J.J. J.

More recently, we have reinterpreted such a consensus as the combination of three repeats of the simpler motif 5′-NAT(A/T)AT-3′ (33Escolar L. Pérez-Martı́n J. de Lorenzo V. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 283: 537-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), in which the thymines would be the bases determining the type of contact of the Fur protein with such a minimal unit of interaction. The corollary of this interpretation is that extended sites for Fur binding could be naturally or artificially assembled by simply adding multiple adjacent 5′-NAT(A/T)AT-3′ hexamers to a minimum of three repeats. This is a very attractive possibility, because it would permit the generation of repertoires of binding sites of varying extensions and affinities, which would allow Fur to act in some promoters as a very specific regulator and in others as a more general co-regulator (12Escolar L. Pérez-Martı́n J. de Lorenzo V. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6223-6229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although this notion has been substantiated using synthetic DNA sequences consisting of synthesized 5′-NAT(A/T)AT-3′ hexamers (33Escolar L. Pérez-Martı́n J. de Lorenzo V. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 283: 537-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), it is unclear whether long sequence-dependent Fur operators are operative in natural iron-regulated promoters. The promoter of the operon responsible for the biosynthesis of the aerobactin siderophore (referred hereafter asPaer) is particularly interesting in this respect (26de Lorenzo V. Wee S. Herrero M. Neilands J.B. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 2624-2630Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32de Lorenzo V. Giovannini F. Herrero M. Neilands J.B. J. Mol.

Unlike other promoters controlled by Fur in which the operator involves a clear-cut target sequence (13Litwin M. Calderwood S. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 6: 137-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar, 24Brickman T.J. Ozenberger B.A. McIntosh M.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 212: 669-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 27Desai P.J. Angerer A. Genco C.A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5020-5023Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Griggs D.W. Konisky J. J.

Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3944-3955Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Paeris bound by the repressor to three distinct extents depending on the concentration of the protein (Fig. 1 and see below). Although Fur binding to the adjacent sites named I and II can be justified by their similarity to the consensus, the massive protection of the further upstream sequences (the so called polymerization region; Fig. 1) is intriguing, because it does not contain clear Fur consensus boxes. Such an extensive occupation of the promoter by the repressor spreading over 100 bp has been revealed not only by DNase I and hydroxyl radical footprinting (32, see below) but also visualized directly through electron microcoscopy (35Le Cam E. Fréchon D. Barray M. Fourcade A. Delain E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11816-11820Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Other iron-regulated promoters appear to undergo such an ample occupation as well (25Chai S. Welch T.J. Crosa J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33841-33847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 36Fréchon D. Le Cam E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 201: 346-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), so it might be a genuine phenomenon and not an unspecific protection caused by an excess of the protein. In this work, we show that the as yet unaccounted binding of the Fur protein to the 5′ upstream region of the aerobactin promoter is due to the functionality of a long operator composed of nine adjacent 5′-NAT(A/T)AT-3′ hexamers. This operator, which is entirely sequence-dependent, becomes effective only following the occupation of the other two sites. These results support the notion that the binding of Fur to DNA is mediated by the recognition of hexameric repeats and that an increasing number of adjacent repeats allow a co-operative binding of the repressor mediated by lateral protein-protein interactions. Furthermore, we argue that this type of interaction, which has features reminiscent of some transcription factors (37Pizzi S. Dieci G. Frigeri P. Piccoli G. Stocchi V. Ottonello S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2539-4838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), endows the protein with the ability to behave both as a very specific repressor and as a more general regulator. The Fur protein used in all the assays was purified to homogenity following the metallo-affinity purification protocol of Wee et al. (7Wee S. Neilands J.B. Bittner M.L. Hemming B.C. Haymore B.L. Seetharam R. Biol. Metals. 1988; 1: 62-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). According to Ref. 8Althaus E.W. Outten C.E. Olson K.E. Cao H. O'Halloran T.V. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6559-6569Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, such purification protocol yields a Fur protein containing 1 atom of zinc/repressor monomer, whose DNA binding ability is responsive to Mn2+ in our assays system (see below). Protein Fur concentrations indicated through this work refer to the protein monomer. DNA techniques were run according to published protocols (38Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The organization of the DNA fragments used in footprinting assays is shown in Fig.2. The fragment wt1 is a 368-bpEcoRI-PvuII segment from plasmid pUC-LE15 that contains the region spanning positions −128 to +32 of the aerobactin promoter region (using as a reference the transcription start site of the main promoter P1) as an EcoRI-BamHI plus a vector-born unrelated BamHI-PvuII extension of 208 bp. The strategy for creating the promoter termed Δ50 is sketched in Fig. 2 A as well. Primers were devised for amplification of the sequence −50 to +32 (thus excluding the P2 promoter) and the upstream extension region. This fragment was recloned in pUC19 using the EcoRI and BamHI sites present in the amplified fragments (BamHI already present andEcoRI entered with the rightwards primer). To get a template of identical size to wt1 for the footprint assay, a primer was engineered that contained a terminal NcoI site located at exactly the same distance that the EcoRI site of the wt1 promoter (Fig. 2 B). Such a segment was then entered at the single HincII site of the previous pUC19 derivative. This new plasmid contained an insert in the vector that spans the new promoter construct Δ50. The fragment generated after restriction withNcoI-PvuII allowed a base-wise comparison of its footprint with the wild type fragment because the end-sites,EcoRI or NcoI, were located exactly at the same point. For the second series of templates shown in Fig. 2 B, modified variants of the aerobactin promoter with increasing distance between the Fur box I (Fig. 1) and the downstream protected region were constructed as follows. In the EcoRI-BamHI insert of plasmid pUC-LE15 a novel ClaI restriction site was introduced by site-directed mutagenesis at the boundary between Fur boxes I and II (Fig. 2 B) with the method of Kunkel et al. (39Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4558) Google Scholar). Digestion of the resulting construct withClaI, filling-in of the cohesive ends, and religation originated a novel NruI as well as +2 bp insertion between the boxes. The same ClaI-digested plasmid was ligated to the linker 5′-CGACCATGGT-3′, which entered a novel NcoI site as well as a +10 insertion. Finally, NcoI digestion of the resulting construct, filling-in the cohesive ends and religation generated the +14 bp along with a new NsiI site. The mutated segments were cloned back to pUC19 and used as the source of the end-labeled restriction fragments employed in the footprinting assays. To this end, they were excised from these pUC19 derivatives asEcoRI-PvuII or NcoI-PvuII segments (for labeling of the bottom strand) and purified by electrophoresis on nondenaturing 5% polyacrylamide gels. The overhanging ends of the restriction fragments were then filled-in with [α-32P]dATP and Klenow polymerase, after which they were further purified from nonincorporated nucleotides on small Sephadex G-25 columns. DNA-protein interactions were probed with DNase I as described in Refs. 32de Lorenzo V. Giovannini F. Herrero M. Neilands J.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 203: 875-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar and 33Escolar L. Pérez-Martı́n J. de Lorenzo V. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 283: 537-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar. Samples were preincubated for 5 min at 37 °C with the amounts of the Fur protein indicated in each case. Each tube was then added with 2.5 ng of DNase I and further incubated for 2 min. Reactions were stopped, nucleic acids precipitated, dried, and directly resuspended in 7m urea (with tracking dyes). Samples were loaded on 7–10% polyacrylamyde sequencing gels with 7 m urea. A+G reactions (40Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 499-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (9013) Google Scholar) with the same labeled DNA fragments or sequencing size markers were loaded onto the gels together with the treated samples. Footprinting of DNA with hydroxyl radicals generated in situwith Fe/EDTA/ascorbate were carried out (32de Lorenzo V. Giovannini F. Herrero M. Neilands J.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 203: 875-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) on Fur-DNA mixtures prepared and preincubated in the same conditions as before. To match faithfully the extensions of each binding site for the Fur protein along thePaer promoter with the specific bases involved in protein-DNA contacts, we conducted the experiment shown in Fig.3. In it, we compared directly the protections caused by increasing concentration of Fur-Mn2+to either DNase I nicking or hydroxyl radical cleavage of sugar-phosphate bonds (Mn2+ was used instead of Fe2+ because of its superior stability under the aerobic conditions of the experiment; Refs. 11Escolar L. de Lorenzo V.

Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6223-6229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, and 26de Lorenzo V. Wee S. Herrero M. Neilands J.B. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 2624-2630Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The reference DNase I footprint to the left of the gel shown in Fig. 3 revealed the position of each of the known three regions sequentially protected by growing repressor concentrations. This includes first a 31-bp sequence (site I) spanning the −35 hexamer of the P1 promoter, an additional 18–19 bp downstream protection (site II) overlapping the −10 box, and the less defined further upstream region protected toward 5′ (26de Lorenzo V. Wee S. Herrero M. Neilands J.B. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 2624-2630Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although weaker than those of sites I and II, this last protection involves exactly 60 bp, so that the addition of all sites covered by the protein at the higher protein concentration comes to 110 bp. When the same protein-DNA contacts are inspected in strict parallel with hydroxyl radical footprinting, some salient features become apparent. First, that the distinction between the three binding regions revealed by DNase becomes less clear-cut. At the higher Fur concentration, the whole of the 110-bp DNA sequence displays a continuous and repetitive pattern of two protected residues/four nonprotected bases. The frame of such a regular pattern is shifted only once and by one base at the very boundary between the DNase I site I and the upstream protected region, to then resume the previous two protected/four nonprotected mold through the further upstream region. Furthermore, the data of Fig. 3suggest that the occupation of such an upstream region does not commence until the site II is fully bound by the repressor. Because we could not distinguish discrete binding sites within the 110-bp region but rather a continuum of repetitive interactions, we wondered whether the entire DNA stretch actually functions as a natural, extended operator of the type predicted by the reinterpretation of the Fur consensus sequences presented before (33Escolar L. Pérez-Martı́n J. de Lorenzo V. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 283: 537-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Because the 50-bp sequence of the Paer promoter spanning DNase sites I and II interacts invariably with the Fur protein with the 6-bp periodicity discussed above, we first addressed whether such sites are independent (as they should be by the 19-bp consensus criterium) or site II is a sequence-dependent extension of site I. Such secondary sites are protected in most E. coli Fur-regulated promoters, although the sequences can be very variable (24Brickman T.J. Ozenberger B.A. McIntosh M.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 212: 669-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 28Griggs D.W. Konisky J. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 1048-1054Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Hunt M.D. Pettis G.S. McIntosh M.A. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3944-3955Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Tardat B. Touati D. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 9: 53-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). To address this issue, we engineered a ClaI site next to the Fur box of site I (primary binding site of the protein). This site was employed to insert extra bases that changed the relative orientation of the downstream site II by 2, 10, or 14 bp (Fig. 2 B). The expected result of such insertions was to either offset moderately the two target sequences (+2) or to separate them but keep the phase of the DNA helix (+10) or to entirely offset and separate sites I and II (+14). The resulting promoter variants were then footprinted with DNase I in the presence of growing concentrations of Fur-Mn2+, with the results shown in Fig. 4. The 2-bp insertion (Fig. 4) between the sites entered a change in the extension and strength of the occupation of site II. The first 31 bp (site I) were protected to the same extension and the same protein concentration as the wild type promoter. However, occupation of site II (which was displaced further downstream: upwards in Fig. 4) required a significantly higher Fur-Mn2+ level. Interestingly, the protection of the 5′ extension region occurred at the very same protein concentration as in the wild type promoter, thus suggesting that such an extension is entirely independent of the presence of protein bound to site II. Although these results indicated that occupation of site II is co-operative with that of site I, they do not rule by themselves that both sites are indeed independent. This issue, however, was unequivocally ascertained by the results of the +10 and +14 promoters. Regardless of the maintenance of the DNA helix phase (+10) or its full disruption (+14), the increased distance between sites I and II resulted in the inability of the downstream site to bind any protein. In both cases, the protection of site I was in all comparable with the wild type Paer promoter. These data favor the notion that site II is an extension of site I rather than a separate target sequence. As in the case of the +2 template, the separation of the sites by longer insertions did not affect at all the upstream 5′ extensions, which were detected to the same extent and apparent intensity as in the wild type promoter. The results above gave a preliminary hint on whether the lateral enlargements of the protection caused by Fur on most iron-regulated promoters ofE. coli (24Brickman T.J. Ozenberger B.A. McIntosh M.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 212: 669-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 28Griggs D.W. Konisky J. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 1048-1054Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Hunt M.D. Pettis G.S. McIntosh M.A. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3944-3955Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Tardat B. Touati D. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 9: 53-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) is sequence-specific or whether they just reflect an artifactual occupation caused by a high protein concentration in vitro. This is a reasonable doubt, because such prolongation not always matches the 19-bp consensus Fur box (24Brickman T.J. Ozenberger B.A. McIntosh M.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 212: 669-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar,28Griggs D.W. Konisky J. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 1048-1054Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Hunt M.D. Pettis G.S. McIntosh M.A. J.

The data of Fig. 4 show that not any sequence adjacent to site I within the aerobactin promoter is suitable to become protected by a high concentration of the repressor. Furthermore, extensions require a certain frame and distance in respect to the primary site. However, the secondary site does include a sequence stretch similar to the 19-bp consensus, thereby suggesting that frame, distance, and specific sequence are all necessary for the enlargement toward the site II. This is, however, less clear at the third protected region, where the extension phenomenon is far more dramatic that in site II (Fig. 3). In this case, the upstream protection observed spans 60 additional base pairs. Although such a protection has a clear directionality and defined boundaries, the sequence involved does not show any significant homology with the reference 19-bp Fur consensus box (26de Lorenzo V. Wee S. Herrero M. Neilands J.B. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 2624-2630Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is thus conceivable that such a massive protection is not specific and therefore irrelevant to understand the metalloregulation of the promoter. To ascertain this question, we simply prepared a new DNA template (Fig. 2 A) in which we faithfully replaced the upstream DNA by an unrelated sequence. The substitution was such that a DNA fragment of a size identical to that bearing the wild typePaer promoter could be examined in parallel in DNase I footprinting assays. The results shown in Fig.5 indicated that the unrelated sequence failed to bear any visible extension of the footprint, even at the higher protein concentrations. Furthermore, the 5′ boundary of the protection was located exactly at the point where the heterologous sequence started (marked with an arrow in Fig. 5). We thus conclude that the binding of Fur to the third region is indeed sequence-dependent. We argue below that this cannot be explained with the generally accepted 19-bp consensus model, but it is perfectly compatible with the notion that a shorter 5′-NAT(A/T)AT-3′ motif is the basic unit of Fur binding. The data presented in this work support the hypothesis (33Escolar L. Pérez-Martı́n J. de Lorenzo V. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 283: 537-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) that Fur binding sites do not follow the standard palindromic organization of target sequences for regulators in prokaryotic promoters (1Ptashne M. A Genetic Switch. Cell Press and Blackwell Scientific Publications, Cambridge, MA1992Google Scholar). Instead, Fur operators of different extensions can be formed by addition, in any orientation, of a minimum of three NAT(A/T)AT hexamers. Although this was shown to be true for artificially assembled NAT(A/T)AT multimers (33Escolar L. Pérez-Martı́n J. de Lorenzo V. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 283: 537-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), this report shows that this is the case also for a natural promoter such as that of the aerobactin operon, whose extended binding sites for the repressor cannot be easily explained with the generally accepted 19-bp consensus model. Fig. 6 shows a reinterpretation of the pattern of Fur-DNA interactions in the promoter as the result of a single, enlarged operator that is formed by additions of up to 18 boxes whose frame give a maximum match to the reference AT(A/T)AT pentamer. Such boxes are separated in all cases by one intervening extra base. The one exception is at the boundary between the site I and the protected upstream region, which lacks such an additional base, a fact that is faithfully reflected in the hydroxyl radical footprint of the region (Fig. 3). It seems that either the deletion of 1 base or the addition of two bases between boxes (as in the artificial promoter +2, see Fig. 4) flaws the co-operative occupation of adjacent hexamers but does not inhibit it. In fact, it is revealing that such a naturally existing deletion between site I and the upstream extension is required to frame maximally the further upstream sequence to the reference NAT(A/T)AT motif. But how does this hypothesis equate the actual data? The sequence that is protected by the lowest concentrations of Fur-Mn2+ includes 31 bp and, according to the hydroxyl radical footprinting of Fig. 3, consists of a whole of five adjacent hexamers, three of them with a nearly perfect match to NAT(A/T)AT. The side repeats contain less conserved T residues, and thus their occupation requires a higher repressor concentration, which establishes the pause in the protection that is clearly revealed by DNase I footprint (Fig. 3) and which defines site II. Such second site would include three additional repeats. This extension certainly requires protein-protein interactions with the repressor already bound to site I, to compensate the divergence in the sequence. In fact, some hexamers have only a limited match with the consensus. Thus, the downstream sequence may not bind by itself to the Fur-Mn2+ complex, but it does in the context of the whole promoter. Finally, the long upstream extension can also be sorted out as an array of adjacent Fur-binding hexamers frameshifted by one base in respect to the sequence of boxes included in sites I and II. Although such a shift may explain the lower affinity, the hydroxyl radical data of Fig. 3 shows that the shift resettles the pattern of protein-DNA interactions to the maximum match with the NAT(A/T)AT array. It thus appears that the suboptimal alignment with the primary sites and the considerable sequence divergence of the upstream region are balanced by a higher number of boxes that, as a result, produce an unusually long operator. Although not to the same dramatic extent as the aerobactin system, many if not all iron-regulated promoters of E. coli (14Tardat B. Touati D. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 9: 53-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 22Stojiljkovic I. Bäumler A.J. Hantke K. J. Mol.

Commun. 1994; 201: 346-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) contain Fur target sequences that spread beyond the core iron box. No natural Fur binding sites have been found to give less than a 31-bp footprint with DNase I, although the minimal operator is only 19 bp. It thus looks likely that such adjacent sequences are not casual but are indeed arrayed in a configuration of various 6-bp repeats with a potential to interact specifically with the Fur protein as a whole. Extended sites might tolerate a degree of divergence in the sequences involved, which could be compensated by the higher overall affinity. These additional contacts might strengthen the overall binding of the DNA segment to the regulator and do explain why the protection is not limited to the consensus Fur box. The 6-bp box criteria accounts for the variability and extension of the sequences protected by Fur in most iron-regulated promoters and is also compatible with the relatively high amount of Fur molecules (approximately 5000) found inside the cell (16Hall H.K. Foster J.W. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5683-5691Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 41Watnick P.I. Eto T. Takahashi H. Calderwood S.B. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 243-247Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The published DNase I footprinting assays on several promoters (14Tardat B. Touati D. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 9: 53-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 24Brickman T.J.

Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3944-3955Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) can be consistently reinterpreted as arrays of hexameric sequences akin to those of the aerobactin promoter, in which the key T residues are conserved to various degrees. This mode of Fur-DNA interaction, in which new Fur molecules must necessarily bind adjacent hexamers through side-by-side oligomerization, explains the gradual physiological response observed in Fe2+-responsive systems, because it would make possible an entire range of repression levels of iron-controlled promoters (12Escolar L. Pérez-Martı́n J. de Lorenzo V. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6223-6229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The affinity for specific promoters would vary depending on the number of repeats present on each operator and the conservation of their sequences, thus generating a hierarchy of transcriptional responses depending on small changes in the iron status of the cell. Such an ability of Fur to control promoters through extensive DNA-protein interactions makes this protein to be mechanistically closer to general regulators than to specific transcriptional factors. In fact, because Fur is a Zn-containing protein (8Althaus E.W. Outten C.E. Olson K.E. Cao H. O'Halloran T.V. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6559-6569Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), it is curious that the type of DNA-protein interactions reported here have certain reminiscence to the occupation of adjacent DNA sites by individual zinc fingers within eukaryotic transcription factors such as transcription factor TFIIIA (3Wuttke D.S.

Defects in NER result in human syndromes such as xeroderma pigmen-tosum (XP), where there is a 1000-fold increased incidence of skin cancer. The ERCC1 protein is essential for NER, but ERCC1 knockout mice are not a model for XP. In the absence of exogenous DNA-damaging agents, these mice are runted and die before weaning, with dramatically accelerated liver polyploidy and elevated levels of p53. Here we present a morphological, immunological, and molecular study to understand the mechanism for the unusual liver pathology in ERCC1-deficient mice. We show that the enlarged ERCC1-deficient hepatocytes are arrested in G2 and that DNA replication and the normal process of binucleation are both reduced. This is associated with a p53-independent increase in expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21. The most dramatic feature of the ERCC1-deficient liver phenotype, the accelerated polyploidy, is not rescued by p53 deficiency, but we show that p53 is responsible for the reduced DNA replication and binucleation. We consider that the liver phenotype is a response to unrepaired endogenous DNA damage, which may reflect an additional non-NER-related function for the ERCC1 protein.—Núñez, F., Chipchase, M.

Urbatsch I.U. Gros P. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34711-34718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) that provides sufficient material for crystallization trials. Until high resolution data on Pgp are available, it seems reasonable to utilize the HisP x-ray structure (32Hung L.W. Wang I.X. Nikaido K. Liu P.Q. Ames G.F. Kim S.H. Nature. 1998; 396: 703-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar) as a guide. HisP is the catalytic, ATP-hydrolyzing subunit of the bacterial ABC transporter, histidine permease (33Nikaido K. Liu P-Q. Ames G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27745-27752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). It shows significant sequence homology to the two Pgp ATP-binding sites, containing Walker A, Walker B, and ABC signature (“LSGGQ”) sequences. In addition, HisP contains a Tyr residue (Tyr-16) which, in the x-ray structure, is stacked against the adenine ring of bound ATP. Tyr-16 corresponds in sequence to each of the two Tyr residues (Tyr-397 and Tyr-1040) 2Here we use residue numbers corresponding to the mouse MDR3 Pgp sequence. that are covalently labeled by the photoaffinity label 8-azido-ADP trapped in the N- and C-terminal ATP-binding sites of Pgp (34Sankaran B. Bhagat S. Senior A.E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Therefore, significant similarities in structure between the HisP and Pgp catalytic sites are evident. The Walker A consensus sequence (GXXXXGK(S/T)), found in numerous ATP- and GTP-hydrolyzing enzymes, ends in a highly conserved Ser or Thr. In cases where x-ray structures are available (e.g. myosin, ATP synthase F1 sector, G-proteins), the hydroxyl oxygen of this residue is seen to provide a direct ligand to the Mg2+ of the substrate MgNTP (35Fisher A.J. Smith C.A. Thoden J.B. Smith R. Sutoh K. Holden H.R. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8960-8972Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar, 36Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E.

Chem. 1993; 268: 923-929Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mg2+ is not present in the HisP x-ray structure, because uncomplexed ATP was the ligand bound in the crystals, but Hung et al. (32Hung L.W. Wang I.X. Nikaido K. Liu P.Q. Ames G.F. Kim S.H. Nature. 1998; 396: 703-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar) argue that water 407 occupies the position that would normally be occupied by Mg2+. They point out that water 407 lies 3.26 Å from one of the γ-phosphate oxygens of ATP, 3.37 Å from a β-phosphate oxygen, and 2.73 and 3.31 Å, respectively, from the two carboxyl oxygens of Asp-178, the Walker B Asp residue. Examination of the HisP structure shows that the hydroxyl oxygen of Ser-46 lies 2.90 Å from Water-407, and is therefore another candidate to provide a coordinating ligand, direct or indirect, to the Mg2+ in the natural MgATP substrate. Ser-46 lies at the end of the HisP Walker A consensus sequence, and corresponds to Ser-430 and Ser-10732 in the N- and C-terminal ATP binding sites of Pgp. Mg2+ is an obligate cofactor for ATP hydrolysis in Pgp (18al-Shawi M.K. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4197-4206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate the possible role of Ser-430 and Ser-1073 in Pgp catalysis, and to further study the role of the two catalytic sites, we generated mutations at these positions in mouse MDR3 Pgp. 3Mouse MDR3 Pgp is 87% identical in amino acid sequence to human MDR1 Pgp. Mutant proteins were expressed in Pichia pastoris and purified to homogeneity (31Lerner-Marmarosh N. Gimi K. Urbatsch I.U. Gros P. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34711-34718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis used the commercially available Altered Sites II method from Promega. For mutations in the N-terminal ATP-binding site, anEcoRI-EcoRI fragment of mouse mdr3cDNA (base pairs −13 to 2248) was excised from pDR16 (38Beaudet L. Gros P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17159-17170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and ligated into pAlter-1 to create pAlt-mdr3N, which was the template for mutagenesis. To facilitate subsequent manipulations, this template also contained engineered NruI (position 1348) andSalI (position 1908) restriction sites. The mutagenic oligonucleotide for the S430A mutation was: GCTGTGGAAAAGCGACAACTGTCCAG in which the underlined GCG (Ala) replaced AGC (Ser) and introduced a PshAI site. For mutations in the C-terminal ATP-binding site, anEcoRI-AgeI fragment (base pairs 2248–4007) of mouse mdr3 cDNA was excised from pVT-mdr3.5(24Urbatsch I.L. Beaudet L. Carrier I. Gros P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4592-4602Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), the AgeI site was blunt-ended with T4 DNA polymerase, and the fragment was ligated into pAlter-1, which had been cut withEcoRI and SalI and blunt-ended at theSalI site, to create pAlt-mdr3.5C, which was the template for mutagenesis. To facilitate subsequent manipulations, this template also contained engineered NruI (position 2872),SalI (position 2631), SpeI (position 3067),SnaBI (position 3980), and AgeI (position 4007) restriction sites. The mutagenic oligonucleotide for S1073A mutation was: GGCTGCGGGAAGGCGACAGTGGTCCAG, where the underlined bases replace Ser (AGC) by Ala (GCG) and introduce a newPshAI site. The mutagenic oligonucleotide for S1073T mutation was: CTGCGGGAAGACGACAGTGGTCCA where the underlined bases replace Ser (AGC) by Thr (ACG) and introduce a newPshAI site. The S430T mutation was obtained as follows. The template was an EcoRI-EcoRI fragment (base pairs −13 to 2248) from mdr3 cDNA ligated in M13mp18 (24Urbatsch I.L. Beaudet L. Carrier I. Gros P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4592-4602Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), and the mutagenic antisense oligonucleotide was: GGACAGTTGTGGYTTTTCCACAGC, in which the mutagenic Y changes Ser (TCC) to Ala (GCC) or Thr (ACC). Only Thr mutants were obtained. Mutagenesis in this case was by the T7-GEN method (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). In all cases, presence of the correct mutation and lack of any undesired mutations in the fragment to be transferred into pHIL-mdr3.5-His6 were checked by DNA sequencing. Expression of mutations utilized the InVitrogen P. pastoris expression system (license no. 272749). Mutations were transferred into plasmid pHIL-mdr3.5-His6 (24Urbatsch I.L. Beaudet L. Carrier I. Gros P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4592-4602Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) using the following restriction fragments: S430A and S430T,BglII-SmaI; S1073A and S1073T,SpeI-SnaBI. Successful transfer was checked by restriction digestion and/or DNA sequencing. The new pHIL-mdr3.5-His6 derivatives were carefully checked using a combination of AflII, BglII,SmaI, and SnaBI, to ensure that they gave fragments of the correct size, then they were digested withNotI and the linearized DNA (containing the wholemdr3 sequence on a 9.3-kilobase pair fragment) was transformed into P. pastoris strain GS115 by LiCl technique (InVitrogen guidelines). His+ transformants that showed slow growth when patched on methanol-containing plates (MutS) were isolated. These isolates have undergone homologous recombination of the mdr3 sequence behind the AOX1 promoter. Expression of MDR3 protein was assayed using “rapid membranes preparation” and Western blotting, as previously described (31Lerner-Marmarosh N. Gimi K. Urbatsch I.U. Gros P. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34711-34718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Strains that showed good expression of Pgp were saved as glycerol stocks. Around 90% of His+, MutS recombinants expressed Pgp. The pHIL-mdr3.5-His6 plasmid contains full-length mouse MDR3 Pgp sequence with an additional His6 tag at the C-terminal end. Thus, all mutant proteins contained the His tag. Media were as described previously (31Lerner-Marmarosh N. Gimi K. Urbatsch I.U. Gros P. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34711-34718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Growth of cells in 2-liter flasks for purification of Pgp was as described previously (31Lerner-Marmarosh N. Gimi K. Urbatsch I.U. Gros P. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34711-34718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. After initial growth in MGY medium, cells were centrifuged and resuspended in MM medium containing 0.5% v/v methanol, at A 600 of 3.0–4.0 instead of 2.0 as previously. Further additions of methanol were 1% v/v at 24 and 48 h, to increase cell yield. Cells were harvested and resuspended as described (31Lerner-Marmarosh N. Gimi K. Urbatsch I.U. Gros P. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34711-34718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and disrupted in 100-g batches in a Bead-Beater (Biospec Inc, model 1107900) using 0.5-mm diameter glass beads (catalog no. 11079-105). (previously, a French press was used). Crude microsomes were prepared from disrupted cells as described previously (31Lerner-Marmarosh N. Gimi K. Urbatsch I.U. Gros P. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34711-34718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Solubilization and purification of Pgp was as described previously (31Lerner-Marmarosh N. Gimi K. Urbatsch I.U. Gros P. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34711-34718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), using DM for solubilization, followed by nickel-affinity chromatography, DEAE-cellulose ion exchange, and concentration by pressure filtration. After the solubilization step, all buffers contained 20% v/v glycerol (instead of 30% in Ref. 31Lerner-Marmarosh N. Gimi K. Urbatsch I.U. Gros P. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34711-34718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) to speed chromatography and concentration. This was done as described in Ref. 31Lerner-Marmarosh N.

Briefly Pgp was incubated with 8 mm DTT and 1% w/v Escherichia coli lipids (Avanti, acetone/ether preparation) (final ratio of lipid/protein = 100/1) for 20 min at room temperature, followed by sonication for 30 s at 4 °C in a bath sonicator. Where labeling with or trapping of radioactive nucleotide was being assayed, the ratio of lipid/protein was reduced to 2/1 (which is sufficient for maximal activation of ATPase; Ref. 31Lerner-Marmarosh N.

Aliquots of 2–5 μl of activated Pgp (above) were added to 50 μl of 50 mmTris-Cl, pH 7.5, 10 mm NaATP, 10 mmMgCl2, and incubated at 37 °C. Reactions were stopped at appropriate times by addition of 1 ml of ice-cold 20 mmH2SO4, and Pi release was estimated by the method of Van Veldhoven and Mannaerts (39Van Veldhoven P.P. Mannaerts G.P. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 161: 45-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). All reactions were linear with time, and ≤10% of the ATP was hydrolyzed. Verapamil was added as a solution in dimethyl sulfoxide, keeping solvent ≤2% v/v. For determination of K m values, MgATP at varied concentration was added with excess 2 mm MgCl2.Metal dependence of ATP hydrolysis was measured using 10 mmNaATP, 150 μm verapamil in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, with MgCl2, MnCl2, CaCl2, or CoCl2 added at concentrations indicated under “Results.” Inhibition of ATPase by varied concentration of Vi, BeFx, or fluoroaluminate (AlFx) was assayed using MgATP (1 mm) and 150 μm verapamil for 20 min at 37 °C. For BeFx and AlFx, a constant concentration of 5 mm NaF was used and concentration of BeSO4 or AlCl3 was varied. Orthovanadate solutions (100 mm) were prepared from Na3VO4(Fisher Scientific) at pH 10 and boiled for 2 min before each use to break down polymeric species. 1-ml centrifuge columns of Sephadex G-50 in disposable syringes were equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 0.001% DM at 4 °C. After a pre-spin as described (40Penefsky H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 252: 2891-2899Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar), Pgp (2.5–20 μg in 100-μl volume) was loaded on the column, and eluted by a second spin, also at 4 °C. If lipid activation of Pgp was not carried out beforehand, then 10% v/v glycerol was also included in the column buffer to preserve activity. Recovery of Pgp in the eluates was 80–95%, as judged by ATPase and protein assays. Similar results were seen if centrifuge columns were run at room temperature, or if 0.01% DM was used in the buffer. This was done as described by Urbatsch et al.(20Urbatsch I.L. Sankaran B. Weber J. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19383-19390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 21Urbatsch I.L. Sankaran B. Bhagat S. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26956-26961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Activated Pgp (see above) was incubated with 200 μm Vi (or 200 μmBeSO4 plus 1 mm NaF, or 1 mmAlCl3 plus 5 mm NaF) plus 100 μmNaATP, 3 mm MgCl2, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, and 150 μm verapamil in a total volume of 100 μl for 20 min at 37 °C. Incubations were started by addition of nucleotide and stopped by transfer to ice. Samples were passed through centrifuge columns as above to remove unbound ligands. Reactivation of ATPase was measured in an enzyme-linked continuous optical assay utilizing an ATP regeneration system (20Urbatsch I.L. Sankaran B. Weber J. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19383-19390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 21Urbatsch I.L. Sankaran B. Bhagat S. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26956-26961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Vi trapping experiments were performed as in the previous paragraph, except that 100 μm[α-32P]ATP replaced ATP. Control experiments using 100 μm [α-32P]ATP showed that <0.02% of applied nucleotide eluted from centrifuge columns in the absence of protein, all other components being present. The amount of trapped radioactive nucleotide was proportional to the amount of Pgp used in the range 3.5 μg (25 pmol) to 20 μg (142 pmol). Stoichiometry of Vi-trapped nucleotide in Pgp was calculated using a molecular mass of 141,000 Da. Activated Pgp (7 μg) was incubated in 2.5 or 100 μm [α-32P]ATP, 150 μm verapamil, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 1% acetone, with EDTA (1 mm) or MgCl2 as indicated, for 5 min on ice in a volume of 30 μl. Final DTT concentration was 1 mm. Samples were irradiated in a methacrylate cuvette for 3 min at room temperature with a xenon arc lamp (Osram XBO 450). 20 μl of irradiated sample (5 μg) was mixed with 10 μl of SDS buffer and run on 10% SDS gels. Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue and subjected to autoradiography. To quantitate amount of radioactivity in the Pgp bands, a PhosphorImager (Storm 860, Molecular Dynamics) and software (ImageQuant 5.0, Molecular Dynamics) were used. Activated Pgp (5 μg) was incubated in 20 μl containing 2.5 μm8-azido-[α-32P]ATP, 150 μm verapamil, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, in presence of EDTA (1 mm) or MgCl2 as indicated, for 5 min on ice. Final DTT concentration was 1 mm. This was followed by UV irradiation for 5 min on ice (UVG-11 Minerallight, 254 nm, 5.5 milliwatts/cm2, placed directly above the samples). Photolabeled samples were mixed with SDS buffer and the whole sample run on 10% SDS gels, stained with Coomassie Blue, and subjected to autoradiography. Activated Pgp was incubated with 100 μm 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP, 200 μm Vi, 150 μm verapamil, 50 mmTris-Cl, pH 7.5, in a total volume of 50 μl at 37 °C for 20 min. EDTA, MgCl2, MnCl2, CaCl2, or CoCl2 were included at concentrations indicated under “Results.” Incubations were started by addition of 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP and stopped by transfer to ice. 50 μl of ice-cold 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, was added to bring the volume to 100 μl, and free label was promptly removed by passage though a centrifuge column (above). Samples were irradiated on ice with UV for 5 min as above. 10 μl of SDS buffer was added, and samples were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C, then concentrated to 15-μl volume in a SpeedVac at 43 °C and run on SDS gels. Protein concentrations were determined by the bicinchoninic acid method in presence of 1% SDS using bovine serum albumin as a standard (18al-Shawi M.K. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4197-4206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was done using the Mini-PROTEAN II gel and Electrotransfer system (Bio-Rad). Samples (2 volumes) were dissolved in 1 volume of 5% (w/v) SDS, 25% (v/v) glycerol, 0.125 mTris-Cl, pH 6.8, 0.01% pyronin Y, 160 mm DTT for 20 min at 37 °C, then run on 10% polyacrylamide gels. For immunodetection of Pgp, mouse monoclonal antibody C219 (Signet Laboratories Inc.) was used with the ECL detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For autoradiography, SDS gels were stained with Coomassie Blue, dried, and exposed overnight at −80 °C to Kodak BioMax films with intensifying screens. 8-Azido-[α-32P]ATP was purchased from Affinity Labs Inc. [α-32P]ATP was from NEN Life Science Products. Acetone/ether-precipitated E. coli lipids were from Avanti Polar Lipids. Other chemicals were as described in Ref. 31Lerner-Marmarosh N. Gimi K.

Analysis of the catalytic mechanism of P-glycoprotein in molecular detail has been facilitated by two recent advances. One is the resolved x-ray structure of the nucleotide-binding subunit HisP from the ABC transporter histidine permease (32Hung L.W. Wang I.X. Nikaido K. Liu P.Q. Ames G.F. Kim S.H. Nature. 1998; 396: 703-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar), which, as we argue in the Introduction, likely provides a reasonable facsimile of the structure of the nucleotide-binding domains of Pgp. The second is the development of a large scale method for purification of mutant Pgp in detergent-soluble form (31Lerner-Marmarosh N. Gimi K. Urbatsch I.U. Gros P. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34711-34718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In this paper we study the role of conserved Ser residues (Ser-430 and Ser-1073),2 which occur at the end of the Walker A sequence in the N-terminal and C-terminal ATP-binding sites of Pgp. We generated mutations S430A, S430T, S1073A, and S1073T in mouse MDR3 Pgp, in order to study the catalytic role of these Ser residues. The four mutant proteins were generated and expressed in the yeast P. pastoris. Cells were grown in flask cultures, crude microsomes were prepared, and Pgp was solubilized and purified as published previously (31Lerner-Marmarosh N. Gimi K. Urbatsch I.U. Gros P. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34711-34718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Modifications to the procedure were made to improve yield and speed, as noted under “Experimental Procedures.” We routinely obtained a yield of ∼25 g of cells/liter of culture, and a final average yield of 0.03 mg of Pgp/g wet weight of cells for the four mutant proteins, as compared with 0.05 mg of Pgp/g wet weight of cells for wild-type Pgp grown under the same conditions. In a typical purification, we grew 3-liter batches of cells, and obtained 2 mg of pure mutant protein. Each mutant protein was purified at least twice, and excellent agreement was seen between replicate preparations in terms of specific ATPase activity. Fig.1 shows an SDS gel of the purified mutant proteins. The results confirmed those obtained in Ref. 31Lerner-Marmarosh N. Gimi K. Urbatsch I.U. Gros P. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999"

However, an excess of ROS can damage cells and alter endothelial cell function. We hypothesized that endogenous mechanisms protect the vasculature from excess levels of ROS. We now show that superoxide can inhibit endothelin-converting enzyme activity (ECE) and decrease endothelin-1 synthesis. Superoxide inhibits ECE but hydrogen peroxide and nitric oxide do not. Superoxide inhibits ECE by ejecting zinc from the enzyme, and the addition of exogenous zinc restores enzymatic activity. Superoxide may inhibit other zinc metalloproteinases by a similar mechanism and may thus play an important role in regulating the biology of blood vessels.

Endothelin-1 (ET-1)1 is synthesized from a large precursor, prepro-ET-1 (4Inoue A. Yanagisawa M. Takuwa Y. Mitsui Y. Kobayashi M. Masaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14954-14959Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A signal peptidase cleaves prepro-ET-1 into pro-ET-1, which in turn is cleaved by a furin-like enzyme into big ET-1. Endothelin-converting enzyme (ECE) then cleaves big ET-1 into ET-1, a 21-amino acid residue polypeptide. Cleavage of big ET-1 into ET-1 is essential for its activity, because big ET-1 is biologically inactive.The endothelin-converting enzyme (ECE) was first purified from rat lung and was subsequently discovered to be expressed in endothelial cells of many organs (5Takahashi M.

All three ECE-1 isoforms are encoded by a single gene; they share a common carboxyl-terminal portion but three alternate promoters regulate expression of unique amino-terminal portions.The ECEs are members of a larger zinc metalloproteinase family that includes neutral endopeptidase. ECE is a type II membrane glycoprotein. ECE shares with other zinc metalloproteinases a zinc-binding HEXXH motif. An arginine residue, Arg129, plays a role in binding of big ET. ECE-1 is a homodimer, with a single disulfide bond between the Cys412 residue of each monomer, linking two 130-kDa ECE-1 monomers together.The precise mechanisms that regulate ECE-1 expression, localization, and activity are partially understood. Differences in the response elements of the three alternate promoters of ECE-1 may account for differences in the expression of the isoforms. For example, ECE-1c is expressed predominantly in human smooth muscle, whereas human ECE-1a is expressed in endothelial cells. Differences in the subcellular localization of ECE-1 isoforms may be due to differences in amino-terminal targeting motifs. Human ECE-1a and ECE-1c are found mostly in the plasma membrane, and human ECE-1b is localized in an intracellular compartment. Phosphoramidon, an inhibitor of ECE, induces internalization of ECE. However, little is known about the post-translational regulation of ECE activity.Reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as superoxide or hydrogen peroxide are produced in the cardiovascular system during a variety of physiological and pathophysiological conditions (11Griendling K.K.

Every cell type in blood vessels can produce ROS, including endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and smooth muscle cells; and neutrophils and macrophages that infiltrate into vessels can also produce ROS (15Zweier J.L.

For example, hydrogen peroxide mediates signal transduction of platelet-derived growth factor (21Sundaresan M., Yu, Z.X. Ferrans V.J. Irani K. Finkel T. Science. 1995; 270: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (2300) Google Scholar). Superoxide mediates p21 ras regulation of the cell cycle (22Irani K. Xia Y. Zweier J.L. Sollott S.J. Der C.J. Fearon E.R. Sundaresan M. Finkel T. Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Science. 1997; 275: 1649-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (1421) Google Scholar). ROS activate a variety of other redox-sensitive intracellular cellular targets as well (reviewed in Refs. 11Griendling K.K. Harrison D.G. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 562-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 13Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Moldovan L. Gene Expr. 1999; 7: 255-260PubMed Google Scholar, 14Finkel T. Curr. Opin.

Thus ROS have been shown to play important roles in the regulation of cell growth and migration.However, high levels of ROS can be cytotoxic. For example, vessel injury can lead to the adherence of neutrophils to the endothelium, the activation of the neutrophil NADPH oxidase, and the generation of extracellular superoxide, which can damage endothelial cells (reviewed in Refs. 11Griendling K.K. Harrison D.G. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 562-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 13Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Moldovan L. Gene Expr. 1999; 7: 255-260PubMed Google Scholar, and 26Harrison D.G. J.

Furthermore, ischemia and reoxygenation can lead to the production of high levels of ROS inside endothelial and smooth muscle cells, which can also damage cells.ROS may also play a pathophysiological role in hypertension. Superoxide levels are increased in vessels of spontaneously hypertensive rats compared with wild-type rat vessels (29Suzuki H. Swei A. Zweifach B.W. Schmid-Schonbein G.W. Hypertension. 1995; 25: 1083-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Griendling and co-workers (18Griendling K.K. Minieri C.A. Ollerenshaw J.D. Alexander R.W. Circ. Res. 1994; 74: 1141-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (2368) Google Scholar, 30Rajagopalan S. Kurz S. Munzel T. Tarpey M. Freeman B.A. Griendling K.K. Harrison D.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1916-1923Crossref PubMed Scopus (2140) Google Scholar) have shown that ROS play an important role in angiotensin signaling. Angiotensin binding to its receptors leads to intracellular production of superoxide; superoxide can combine with nitric oxide (NO), decreasing NO levels, and in theory leads to vasospasm. Thus excessive levels of ROS can be potentially harmful to the vasculature.Although superoxide may be detrimental to the vasculature, endogenous counter-regulatory mechanisms may exist that inhibit the harmful effects of superoxide upon the vessel wall. We hypothesized that ROS inhibit the activity of ECE. A reduction in ET levels might then lead to an increase in local blood flow, which would increase perfusion of damaged tissues. Thus ROS inhibition of ECE activity might counteract some of the potentially harmful effects of ROS. To test this hypothesis, we prepared endothelial cell membranes that contain ECE, and we examined the effect of various ROS upon ECE activity.DISCUSSIONThe major finding of our study is that superoxide inhibits ECE by ejecting zinc from the enzyme. This inhibition is due specifically to superoxide; hydrogen peroxide and nitric oxide do not affect ECE activity. Furthermore, this inhibition is reversible, since the addition of zinc restores ECE activity.The mechanism by which superoxide ejects zinc from ECE is unclear. However, it is unlikely that superoxide destroys the structure of ECE, since the addition of zinc restores ECE activity. One possible mechanism by which superoxide could remove zinc from ECE is by reducing the residues that coordinate zinc binding. Superoxide can convert histidine into 2-oxo-histidine, but this reaction is not reversible (41Jewett S.L. Rocklin A.M. Ghanevati M. Abel J.M. Marach J.A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 26: 905-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 42Retsky K.L. Chen K. Zeind J. Frei B. Free. Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 26: 90-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 43Uchida K.

Another possibility is that superoxide reduces Zn2+ to Zn+, which might interact less strongly with the HEXXH motif of ECE and disassociate from ECE. This mechanism would explain why the addition of exogenous zinc restores ECE activity, since Zn2+ can interact with the HEXXH motif. This reduction and ejection of zinc from ECE by superoxide is similar to the effect of superoxide upon iron during superoxide inactivation of iron-sulfur-containing (de)hydratases such as cis-aconitase (45Gardner P.R. Biosci. Rep. 1997; 17: 33-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 46Gardner P.R. Raineri I. Epstein L.B. White C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13399-13405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar).There are over 200 zinc metalloproteinases, and they regulate a variety of physiological and pathophysiological processes, including development, reproduction, tissue remodeling or destruction, inflammation, carcinogenesis, and fibrosis (47Parks W.C. Mecham R.P. Matrix Metalloproteinases. Academic Press, London1998Google Scholar, 48Barrett A.J. Rawlings N.D. Woessner J.F. Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes. Academic Press, London1998Google Scholar). Superoxide may also regulate other zinc metalloproteinases in addition to ECE as well. Others have shown that superoxide can increase matrix metalloproteinase activity. For example, superoxide can increase activity of collagenase, MMP-2, and MMP-9 (19Rajagopalan S. Meng X.P. Ramasamy S. Harrison D.G. Galis Z.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2572-2579Crossref PubMed Scopus (1007) Google Scholar, 49Galis Z.S. Asanuma K. Godin D. Meng X.

Furthermore, superoxide dismutase inhibits matrix degradation (53Shingu M. Isayama T. Yasutake C. Naono T. Nobunaga M. Tomari K. Horie K. Goto Y. Inflammation. 1994; 18: 613-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 54Shingu M. Takahashi S. Ito M. Hamamatu N. Suenaga Y. Ichibangase Y. Nobunaga M. Rheumatol. Int. 1994; 14: 77-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In contrast, our data suggest that superoxide inhibits ECE. Perhaps superoxide activates one set of metalloproteinases and inhibits another because of the difference in zinc-binding motifs. ECE belongs to the zinc metalloproteinase clan MA with the zinc-binding motif HEXXH and the third zinc ligand Glu. In contrast, the matrix metalloproteinase clan MB contains the zinc-binding motif HEXXHXXGXXH, and the third zinc ligand is His.What are the potential physiological consequences of superoxide inhibition of ECE? ROS might act as part of a negative feedback loop during inflammation of the vasculature. For example, neutrophils can bind to endothelial cells as a result of hypoxia or cytokine stimulation. The neutrophil NADPH oxidase can then secrete high levels of superoxide. Superoxide can damage endothelial cells, leading to endothelial cell dysfunction, decreasing endothelial NO production, which can lead to local vasospasm. However, if superoxide also decreases local synthesis of ET-1, then vasospasm might be diminished. Thus ROS which is normally produced during inflammation might actually serve to counteract vasospasm by decreasing ET synthesis. Since ET may play a role in a variety of other pathophysiological conditions, these data also suggest a novel target for inhibitors of ECE. Endothelins are polypeptides that play important signaling roles in the cardiovascular system (1Yanagisawa M. Kurihara H. Kimura S. Tomobe Y. Kobayashi M. Mitsui Y. Yazaki Y. Goto K. Masaki T.

A. 1989; 86: 2863-2867Crossref PubMed Scopus (2555) Google Scholar). Endothelins have many physiological activities, stimulating smooth muscle cell contraction and proliferation, inducing the release of neuropeptides, and regulating bone resorption (reviewed in Ref. 3Miyauchi T. Masaki T. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1999; 61: 391-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Endothelins may play a role in a variety of diseases, including hypertension, vasospasm, congestive heart failure, and renal failure (3Miyauchi T. Masaki T. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1999; 61: 391-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). The three isoforms of endothelin are expressed in endothelial cells and a variety of other cells as well (1Yanagisawa M. Kurihara H. Kimura S. Tomobe Y. Kobayashi M. Mitsui Y. Yazaki Y. Goto K. Masaki T. Nature. 1988; 332: 411-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (10185) Google Scholar, 2Inoue A. Yanagisawa M. Kimura S. Kasuya Y.

Endothelin-1 (ET-1)1 is synthesized from a large precursor, prepro-ET-1 (4Inoue A. Yanagisawa M. Takuwa Y. Mitsui Y. Kobayashi M. Masaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14954-14959Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A signal peptidase cleaves prepro-ET-1 into pro-ET-1, which in turn is cleaved by a furin-like enzyme into big ET-1. Endothelin-converting enzyme (ECE) then cleaves big ET-1 into ET-1, a 21-amino acid residue polypeptide. Cleavage of big ET-1 into ET-1 is essential for its activity, because big ET-1 is biologically inactive. The endothelin-converting enzyme (ECE) was first purified from rat lung and was subsequently discovered to be expressed in endothelial cells of many organs (5Takahashi M. Matsushita Y. Iijima Y.

Chem. 1994; 269: 18275-18278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ECE is also found in adrenal cells, pancreatic cells, the testis, and brain. ECE-1 and ECE-2 are encoded by separate genes and share 59% homology. Human ECE-1 has three isoforms, ECE-1a, ECE-1b, and ECE-1c (7Schweizer A. Valdenaire O. Nelbock P. Deuschle U.

Furthermore, this inhibition is reversible, since the addition of zinc restores ECE activity.The mechanism by which superoxide ejects zinc from ECE is unclear. However, it is unlikely that superoxide destroys the structure of ECE, since the addition of zinc restores ECE activity. One possible mechanism by which superoxide could remove zinc from ECE is by reducing the residues that coordinate zinc binding. Superoxide can convert histidine into 2-oxo-histidine, but this reaction is not reversible (41Jewett S.L. Rocklin A.M. Ghanevati M. Abel J.M. Marach J.A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 26: 905-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 42Retsky K.L. Chen K. Zeind J. Frei B. Free. Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 26: 90-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 43Uchida K.

Another possibility is that superoxide reduces Zn2+ to Zn+, which might interact less strongly with the HEXXH motif of ECE and disassociate from ECE. This mechanism would explain why the addition of exogenous zinc restores ECE activity, since Zn2+ can interact with the HEXXH motif. This reduction and ejection of zinc from ECE by superoxide is similar to the effect of superoxide upon iron during superoxide inactivation of iron-sulfur-containing (de)hydratases such as cis-aconitase (45Gardner P.R.

Superoxide may also regulate other zinc metalloproteinases in addition to ECE as well. Others have shown that superoxide can increase matrix metalloproteinase activity. For example, superoxide can increase activity of collagenase, MMP-2, and MMP-9 (19Rajagopalan S. Meng X.P. Ramasamy S. Harrison D.G. Galis Z.S. J. Clin.

Furthermore, superoxide dismutase inhibits matrix degradation (53Shingu M. Isayama T. Yasutake C. Naono T. Nobunaga M. Tomari K. Horie K. Goto Y.

Int. 1994; 14: 77-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In contrast, our data suggest that superoxide inhibits ECE. Perhaps superoxide activates one set of metalloproteinases and inhibits another because of the difference in zinc-binding motifs. ECE belongs to the zinc metalloproteinase clan MA with the zinc-binding motif HEXXH and the third zinc ligand Glu. In contrast, the matrix metalloproteinase clan MB contains the zinc-binding motif HEXXHXXGXXH, and the third zinc ligand is His.What are the potential physiological consequences of superoxide inhibition of ECE? ROS might act as part of a negative feedback loop during inflammation of the vasculature. For example, neutrophils can bind to endothelial cells as a result of hypoxia or cytokine stimulation. The neutrophil NADPH oxidase can then secrete high levels of superoxide. Superoxide can damage endothelial cells, leading to endothelial cell dysfunction, decreasing endothelial NO production, which can lead to local vasospasm. However, if superoxide also decreases local synthesis of ET-1, then vasospasm might be diminished. Thus ROS which is normally produced during inflammation might actually serve to counteract vasospasm by decreasing ET synthesis. Since ET may play a role in a variety of other pathophysiological conditions, these data also suggest a novel target for inhibitors of ECE. The major finding of our study is that superoxide inhibits ECE by ejecting zinc from the enzyme. This inhibition is due specifically to superoxide; hydrogen peroxide and nitric oxide do not affect ECE activity. Furthermore, this inhibition is reversible, since the addition of zinc restores ECE activity. The mechanism by which superoxide ejects zinc from ECE is unclear. However, it is unlikely that superoxide destroys the structure of ECE, since the addition of zinc restores ECE activity. One possible mechanism by which superoxide could remove zinc from ECE is by reducing the residues that coordinate zinc binding. Superoxide can convert histidine into 2-oxo-histidine, but this reaction is not reversible (41Jewett S.L. Rocklin A.M. Ghanevati M. Abel J.M. Marach J.A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 26: 905-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 42Retsky K.L. Chen K. Zeind J. Frei B. Free. Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 26: 90-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 43Uchida K.

Another possibility is that superoxide reduces Zn2+ to Zn+, which might interact less strongly with the HEXXH motif of ECE and disassociate from ECE. This mechanism would explain why the addition of exogenous zinc restores ECE activity, since Zn2+ can interact with the HEXXH motif. This reduction and ejection of zinc from ECE by superoxide is similar to the effect of superoxide upon iron during superoxide inactivation of iron-sulfur-containing (de)hydratases such as cis-aconitase (45Gardner P.R.

There are over 200 zinc metalloproteinases, and they regulate a variety of physiological and pathophysiological processes, including development, reproduction, tissue remodeling or destruction, inflammation, carcinogenesis, and fibrosis (47Parks W.C.

However, tungsten isotopic data reveal clear differences. Moreover, the silicate and metal fractions define distinct initial (182)Hf/(180)Hf corresponding to a 13.8 +/- 5.3 million year apparent age difference. Internal reequilibration does not provide a ready explanation for this result. Larger scale redistribution of tungsten is more likely, such as may have occurred during collisions between planetesimals."

Several functional proteins including merozoite surface protein 1 are anchored to the cell surface by GPI modification, and GPIs are vital to the parasite. Here, we studied the developmental stage-specific biosynthesis of GPIs by intraerythrocytic P. falciparum. The parasite synthesizes GPIs exclusively during the maturation of early trophozoites to late trophozoites but not during the development of rings to early trophozoites or late trophozoites to schizonts and merozoites. Mannosamine, an inhibitor of GPI biosynthesis, inhibits the growth of the parasite specifically at the trophozoite stage, preventing further development to schizonts and causing death. Mannosamine has no effect on the development of either rings to early trophozoites or late trophozoites to schizonts and merozoites. The analysis of GPIs and proteins synthesized by the parasite in the presence of mannosamine demonstrates that the effect is because of the inhibition of GPI biosynthesis. The data also show that mannosamine inhibits GPI biosynthesis by interfering with the addition of mannose to an inositol-acylated GlcN-phosphatidylinositol (PI) intermediate, which is distinctively different from the pattern seen in other organisms. In other systems, mannosamine inhibits GPI biosynthesis by interfering with either the transfer of a mannose residue to the Manα1–6Manα1–4GlcN-PI intermediate or the formation of ManN-Man-GlcN-PI, an aberrant GPI intermediate, which cannot be a substrate for further addition of mannose.

Plasmodium falciparum, the most virulent parasite among the four species of plasmodial apicomplexan protozoa that infect man, causes millions of deaths each year in tropical and subtropical countries (7Triggs P.I. Kondrachine A.V. Sherman I.W. Malaria: Parasite Biology, Pathogenesis, and Protection. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1998: 11-22Google Scholar). In the past decades, chloroquine and other drugs have been very useful in reducing mortality due to malaria. Although these conventional drugs are still widely used for the treatment of parasite infection, the parasite is rapidly becoming drug-resistant, raising the death toll from malaria (7Triggs P.I. Kondrachine A.V. Sherman I.W. Malaria: Parasite Biology, Pathogenesis, and Protection. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1998: 11-22Google Scholar). Therefore, malaria is once again a global concern, and novel antimalarial drugs are urgently needed. In P. falciparum, GPIs are the major carbohydrate moieties, whereas N- and O-linked carbohydrates or other glycolipids are either absent or present only at very low levels (8Gowda D.C. Gupta P.

The P. falciparum GPIs contain a conserved core structure, ethanolamine-phosphate-6Manα1–2Manα1–6Manα1–4GlcN, that is α-(1–6)-linked to the inositol residue of PI (8Gowda D.C. Gupta P. Davidson E.A.

The parasite GPIs differ significantly from those of the human host, particularly with respect to the absence of additional ethanolamine substituents on the glycan core, the presence of a fourth Man residue, the absence of an alkyl substituent at the sn-1 position, and the type of acyl substituents on the glycerol and inositol moieties (15Ferguson M.A.J.

In this study, we show that intraerythrocytic P. falciparum synthesizes GPI anchors exclusively at the trophozoite stage in a developmental stage-specific manner. We also investigated the effect of the inhibition of GPI anchor biosynthesis on the growth and development of the parasite using ManN, a known inhibitor of GPI biosynthesis in eukaryotic cells (16Lisanti M.

In eukaryotes, ManN can also inhibit the assembly of N-linked oligosaccharides (17Pan Y.-T. De Gespari R. Warren C.D. Elbein A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8991-8999Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and it is a precursor for the synthesis of sialic acid (22Schauer R. Adv. Carbohydr. Chem. Biochem. 1982; 40: 131-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (939) Google Scholar). BecauseP. falciparum contains little or noN-glycosylation capacity, and the parasite does not synthesize sialic acid, the effect of ManN on the parasite is because of the inhibition of GPI biosynthesis. In the presence of ManN, the growth of the parasite was arrested specifically at the trophozoite stage, a developmental stage at which the parasite synthesizes all of its GPIs; this resulted in the death of the parasite. Detailed study demonstrated that the lethal effect of ManN on the parasite is because of the inhibition of GPI biosynthesis, and that ManN interferes with the addition of the first mannose residue to the inositol-acylated GlcN-PI, a mechanism of inhibition that is different from that observed in other organisms.

The [3H]GlcN- or [35S]Met-labeled parasites were dissolved in nonreducing SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and the lysates were heated in a boiling water bath for 5 min and then electrophoresed under nonreducing conditions on 6–20% SDS-polyacrylamide gradient gels (28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207522) Google Scholar). The gels were fixed, washed with water, soaked in 1 m sodium salicylate in water for 30 min, dried, and exposed to x-ray films at −80 °C. We investigated the developmental stage-specific biosynthesis of GPIs in intraerythrocyticP. falciparum and the effect of inhibition of the GPI biosynthetic pathway on the survival of the parasite. Synchronous cultures of the parasites were treated with 1.25–10 mmManN at the early ring stage (8 h after invasion of erythrocytes), and the growth of parasites was monitored through various stages of intraerythrocytic development. ManN inhibited parasite growth in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1and Table I). Parasites treated with 10 mm ManN developed normally during the ring stage, but their growth was markedly impaired at the trophozoite stage; although the treated parasites differentiated into trophozoites, they looked unhealthy with little or no pigment formation, were unable to become schizonts, and died. Parasites treated with 5 mm ManN developed into trophozoites and schizonts, but the rate of growth was significantly reduced during the trophozoite stage. The merozoites formed during 5 mm ManN treatment invaded red blood cells with significantly lower efficiency compared with the untreated parasites. Continued treatment with 5 mm ManN through the second cell cycle completely arrested parasite growth at the trophozoite stage and all parasites died. The parasites treated with 1.25 mm or 2.5 mm ManN grew similar to control cultures during the first cell cycle, but the efficiency of erythrocyte invasion of merozoites formed during the second cell cycle was significantly reduced (∼90 and ∼75%, respectively) compared with that of the control culture. The survival of parasites treated with <5 mm ManN is because of the formation of significant amounts of GPIs, which were used for the GPI anchoring of proteins (see below).Table IThe effect of ManN on parasitemia and development of intraerythrocytic P. falciparumCulture treatmentCulture time1-aCulturing time after the addition of ManN (8 h after the erythrocyte invasion) to the cultures. and parasite development stage32 h56 h80 h104 hUntreatedLate trophozoitesRingsLate trophozoitesRings(3%)(12%)(12%)(4 × 12%)1.25 mm ManNLate trophozoitesRingsLate trophozoitesRings(3%)(12%)(11%)(4 × 11%)2.5 mm ManNLate trophozoitesRingsLate trophozoitesEarly Rings(3%)(12%)(9%)(4 × 9%)5 mm ManNLate trophozoitesRingsMidtrophozoitesUnhealthy trophozoites(2%)(5%)(5%)(5%)Early or midtrophozoites (1%)Schizonts (1%)10 mm ManNUnhealthy midtrophozoitesDead parasites(3%)Synchronous cultures of the parasites were treated with ManN, and at the indicated time the levels of parasitemia and development stage of parasites were assessed by examining Giemsa-stained thin smear of cultures under light microscope.1-a Culturing time after the addition of ManN (8 h after the erythrocyte invasion) to the cultures. Open table in a new tab Synchronous cultures of the parasites were treated with ManN, and at the indicated time the levels of parasitemia and development stage of parasites were assessed by examining Giemsa-stained thin smear of cultures under light microscope. To examine whether the effect of ManN on the parasite is because of the inhibition of a specific metabolic pathway at the trophozoite stage or to nonspecific toxicity, the parasites were treated (6 h after invasion) with 5 or 10 mm ManN. At various time intervals, ManN was withdrawn. Treatment with either 5 or 10 mm ManN during the ring stage only had no significant effect on parasite growth; the parasites developed into trophozoites and schizonts, and the invasion efficiency of the merozoites was similar to that of the untreated parasites. However, treatment with 5 mm ManN for 24 h, extending the treatment period to the trophozoite stage, caused about a 60% reduction in parasitemia in the second cell cycle; the surviving parasites then grew at the same efficiency as that of the control culture. When treated with 10 mm ManN for 24 h, the growth was arrested at the mid-trophozoite stage, and subsequently all parasites died. Treatment with 10 mm ManN starting at the early trophozoite stage (28 h after invasion or earlier) caused death of the parasites in the first cell cycle. However, when ManN treatment was started 36 h after invasion (late trophozoite stage) or later, the growth of the parasites was not affected. The parasites differentiated normally to schizonts, which formed merozoites that efficiently invaded the erythrocytes; these developed into late rings even in the continued presence of 10 mm ManN. However, in the continued presence of 10 mm ManN, parasite growth was completely stopped at the trophozoite stage in the second cell cycle. These results suggest that ManN affects the growth of P. falciparum only at the trophozoite stage, and this is because of the inhibition of GPI biosynthesis (see below). The level of GPI biosynthesis at various stages of intraerythrocytic P. falciparum was determined by measuring the incorporation of [3H]GlcN into GPIs. Synchronous cultures of the parasites were treated with [3H]GlcN 10 h after invasion, and then at 6 h intervals, the parasites were harvested, and the GPIs formed were analyzed. The parasites did not synthesize GPIs during the ring stage (until 16 h after invasion); low levels of GPIs were synthesized by early trophozoites (16–28 h after invasion) (Fig.2). However, the parasites synthesized almost all of their GPIs during development from early trophozoites to late trophozoites (28–40 h of the parasite erythrocytic life cycle). Little or no GPI synthesis occurred during the differentiation of trophozoites to schizonts (40–48 h of the cell cycle). These results, taken together with mannosamine inhibition data demonstrate that GPIs are critically required for the development of trophozoites to schizonts. The [3H]GlcN-labeled GPIs and their intermediates were identified by their susceptibility to nitrous acid and HF and by analysis of their glycan cores before and after digestion with α-mannosidase. The results are summarized in TableII. All the major [3H]GlcN-labeled bands on HPTLC corresponded to GPIs and their intermediates; glycolipids other than GPI were not present at significant amounts.Table IIThe structures of [3H]GlcN-labeled GPIs and their intermediates synthesized by P. falciparumGPI speciesStructureR F valuesGlycan core identifiedEM4GnPIEtN-P-Man4-GlcN-PI0.19Man4GlcNEM3GnPIEtN-P-Man3-GlcN-PI0.29Man3GlcNM4GnPIMan4-GlcN-PI0.61Man4GlcNM3GnPIMan3-GlcN-PI0.74Man3GlcNM2GnPIMan2-GlcN-PI0.84Man2GlcNGnPI*GlcN-PI*0.87GlcNGnAcPI*GlcNAc-PI*0.88GlcNAcM1GnPIMan1-GlcN-PI0.88Man1GlcNGnPIGlcN-PI0.90GlcNThe parasites were labeled with [3H]GlcN and GPIs and their intermediates synthesized by the parasites (see Figs.

Davidson E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6428-6439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 14Gerold P. Schofield L. Blackman M.J. Holder A.A. Schwarz R.T. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 75: 131-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Among various GPI intermediates formed during biosynthesis, the formation of Man4-GlcN-PI that lacks the ethanolamine phosphate substituent (see also Ref. 13Gerold P. Dieckmann-Schuppert A. Schwarz R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2597-2606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), in addition to EtN-P-Man3-GlcN-PI, the conserved GPI structure in all eukaryotes, is noteworthy. The presence of both these GPI species in significant amounts suggests that the formation of the matured GPI, EtN-P-Man4-GlcN-PI, occurs through two different pathways: (i) by transfer of a mannose residue to EtN-P-Man3-GlcN-PI, and (ii) by the addition of mannose to Man3-GlcN-PI and then substitution with EtN-P. As far as we know, the latter reaction sequence is novel. The operation of this pathway is evident by nearly complete conversion of the [3H]GlcN-labeled intermediate to the matured GPI when [3H]GlcN-containing medium was replaced with regular medium at the midtrophozoite stage and the parasites were grown to schizonts. 3R. S. Naik and D. C. Gowda, unpublished data. To determine the time required for the incorporation of exogenous GlcN into the matured GPI molecules, the parasites were metabolically labeled at their trophozoite stage with [3H]GlcN, and the radiolabeled GPIs formed were analyzed at various time intervals. A significant amount of radioactivity was incorporated into matured GPIs within 30 min after the addition of [3H]GlcN to the culture medium, with maximum incorporation reached at 4 h (Fig.3). Therefore, the observed absence of GPI synthesis during ring stage development is not because of any delay in the uptake or utilization of [3H]GlcN by the parasite. Because, in intraerythrocytic P. falciparum, the GPIs are synthesized only at the trophozoite stage, the parasites were treated with varying concentrations of ManN at the early trophozoite stage (28 h after invasion), and 2 h later, they were labeled with [3H]GlcN for 6 h in the continued presence of ManN. ManN inhibited GPI synthesis in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4). The parasites treated with 1.25, 2.5, 5, and 10 mm ManN synthesized ∼30, 18, 12, and 6% of GPIs, respectively, compared with the amount of GPIs synthesized by the untreated parasites. This dose-dependent inhibition of parasite GPI biosynthesis by ManN parallels the concentration-dependent inhibition of parasite growth by ManN. Whereas significant proportions of both the GlcN-PI and inositol-acylated GlcN-PI intermediates were observed in untreated parasites, inositol-acylated GlcN-PI was the major intermediate in ManN-treated parasites (Fig. 4). However, whereas untreated parasites contain a small amount of Man1-GlcN-PI, this GPI intermediate is below the detectable level in the ManN-treated parasites (compare Fig. 2 C with Fig. 4). Furthermore, both untreated and ManN-treated parasites contain small but similar proportions of Man2-GlcN-PI. Together these results suggest that although inositol-acylated GlcN-PI formed in a significant amount, this intermediate is not utilized rapidly for mannosylation. Thus, ManN inhibits the addition of the first mannose residue to the inositol-acylated GlcN-PI intermediate. This is in contrast to the mechanism of inhibition of GPI biosynthesis by ManN in other organisms, where either the accumulation of Man2-GlcN-PI or the formation of ManN-Man-GlcN-PI was observed (5Ralton J.E.

The matured GPIs synthesized by parasites treated with ManN appear to be utilized efficiently for the anchoring of proteins. SDS-PAGE fluorography of the parasite lysates showed significant amounts of GPI-modified proteins in parasites treated with 1.25 or 2.5 mm ManN (Fig. 5); this agrees with the growth of the treated parasites through several cycles. The parasites treated with 5 mm ManN contained low levels of GPI-anchored proteins, and those treated with 10 mm ManN almost completely lacked GPI-anchored proteins. These results suggest the essential role of GPI-anchored proteins in parasite survival. To examine whether ManN treatment also affected protein synthesis, the parasites were labeled with [35S]Met, and the cell lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE fluorography. The results show that the parasites treated with 1.25–10 mm ManN for 5–6 h all synthesized similar levels of proteins compared with the untreated parasites (not shown). Protein synthesis, however, was significantly reduced when parasites were treated with 10 mm ManN during the entire trophozoite stage because of slow growth or growth arrest (not shown). Four important findings emerge from this study: 1) intraerythrocytic P. falciparum synthesizes GPI anchors in a developmental stage-specific manner exclusively at the trophozoite stage; 2) GPI biosynthesis is critical to the differentiation of trophozoites into schizonts, and thus the inhibition of GPI biosynthesis causes parasite growth arrest at the trophozoite stage; 3) in P. falciparum, ManN inhibits GPI biosynthesis by interfering with the attachment of first Man to the inositol-acylated GlcN-PI intermediate, a mechanism that is distinctively different from those in other organisms, including man; and 4) The matured GPI, EtN-P-Man4-GlcN-PI, is formed by two different reaction sequences: transfer of a mannose residue to EtN-P-Man3-GlcN-PI and to Man3-GlcN-PI; Man4-GlcN-PI is then substituted with ethanolamine phosphate. This study shows that ManN inhibits the growth of P. falciparum specifically at the trophozoite stage by inhibiting GPI biosynthesis. 1) The parasite synthesizes almost all of its GPI pool at the trophozoite stage. 2) ManN treatment does not affect the growth of the parasite at either the ring or the schizont stage. Rings treated with even 10 mm ManN developed into early trophozoites, and late trophozoites became schizonts and functional merozoites even in the continued presence of 10 mm ManN. 3) When ManN treatment was withdrawn at the late ring stage, the parasites developed normally to schizonts despite having been treated during most of the ring stage. However, continued treatment with 5 or 10 mmManN either significantly reduced the growth rate or caused complete growth arrest and death of parasites at the midtrophozoite stage. 4) ManN inhibits GPI biosynthesis and the GPI-anchor modification of proteins in a dose-dependent manner. 5) ManN does not significantly affect protein synthesis in the parasite. In several eukaryotic systems, ManN has been shown to be a specific inhibitor of GPI and N-linked oligosaccharide biosynthesis (14Gerold P. Schofield L. Blackman M.J. Holder A.A. Schwarz R.T. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 75: 131-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Because intraerythrocytic P. falciparum has little or noN-glycosylation capacity and the parasite treated with tunicamycin (an inhibitor of N-glycosylation) during the trophozoite stage, synthesized normal levels of GPIs, and developed into schizonts,2 the effect of ManN is not because of the inhibition of N-glycosylation of parasite proteins. These observations conclusively establish that the effect of ManN on the growth of trophozoite stage P. falciparum is specifically because of the inhibition of GPI biosynthesis. The data presented here demonstrate that the biosynthesis of GPIs inP. falciparum occurs exclusively at the trophozoite stage of the parasite. Metabolic labeling of the parasites with [3H]GlcN at various stages of intraerythrocytic development and analysis of the labeled GPIs indicated that the GPIs are not synthesized during the ring stage. As shown in Fig. 2, all of the GPIs were synthesized during the trophozoite stage (between 28 and 38 h after erythrocytic invasion), and little or no GPIs were formed during the schizont stage. The absence of GPI biosynthesis during the ring stage, however, is not because of a delay in the passage of [3H]GlcN through erythrocyte membranes and its entry into the parasites, because trophozoites synthesize significant amounts of GPIs within 30 min after the addition of [3H]GlcN to the culture medium. Although GPI structures of all eukaryotes contain EtN-P-Man3-GlcN-PI, a conserved core structure, the sugar backbone is variously modified with additional sugars and oligosaccharide moieties, which are usually attached to the third and/or first mannose residues (12Kinoshita T. Ohishi K. Takeda J. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 122: 251-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 15Ferguson M.A.J. Brimacombe J.S. Brown J.R. Crossman A. Dix A. Field R.A. Güther M.L. Milne K.G. Sharma D.K. Smith T.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1455: 327-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Among known substituents, the presence of a fourth mannose residue appears to be the common feature of many eukaryotic GPIs (15Ferguson M.A.J. Brimacombe J.S. Brown J.R. Crossman A. Dix A. Field R.A. Güther M.L. Milne K.G. Sharma D.K. Smith T.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1455: 327-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The biosynthetic sequence by which the fourth mannose is added is not clear. It is believed that the formation of EtN-P-Man4-GlcN-PI occurs through the transfer of a mannose residue to EtN-P-Man3-GlcN-PI. However, the results of this study suggest that, in P. falciparum, EtN-P-Man4-GlcN-PI is formed via two distinct reaction sequences: 1) by transfer of a mannose residue to EtN-P-Man3-GlcN-PI, and 2) by the addition of mannose to Man3-GlcN-PI followed by the transfer of a ethanolamine phosphate moiety. If the latter sequence is unique to P. falciparum GPIs, then understanding of the relative regulation of the two reaction sequences may provide a parasite-specific target for the development of antimalarial agents. The inhibition of parasite growth at the trophozoite stage is not because of nonspecific ManN toxicity. Parasites treated with 10 mm ManN after the midtrophozoite stage develop normally to schizonts, and the formed merozoites successfully invaded erythrocytes. Withdrawal of ManN from the parasite cultures treated up to late ring stage also allowed normal parasite development and protein synthesis. The data establish that the deleterious effect of ManN on the trophozoite stage of P. falciparum is specifically because of the inhibition of GPI biosynthesis and agrees with the synthesis of GPIs occurring exclusively during trophozoite development. The effect of ManN specifically at the trophozoite stage of P. falciparum, i.e. the failure of the parasite to develop into schizonts with concomitant inhibition of GPI biosynthesis, strongly suggests that the GPIs are essential for the differentiation of trophozoites into schizonts. Complex carbohydrates in the forms of glycoproteins and/or glycolipids are present in almost all eukaryotic organisms where they have critical roles in development and differentiation. In animals, GPIs have been shown to be vital for normal development (11Marshall V.M. Silva A. Foley M. Cranmer S. Wang L. McColl D.J. Kemp D.J. Coppel R.L Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 4460-4467Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although they are present at markedly lower levels compared with those in parasites. Analysis of the GPI intermediates formed in P. falciparumtreated with ManN suggested that ManN affects the parasite biosynthetic pathway by a mechanism distinctly different from those in other organisms. In several eukaryotic systems including trypanosomes,Leishmania, Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, and HeLa cells, ManN has also been shown to inhibit GPI anchor biosynthesis without affecting protein synthesis. In HeLa cells, ManN was shown to inhibit the α-(1–2)-mannosyltransferase responsible for the transfer of the third Man residue, causing the accumulation of the Manα1–6Manα1–4GlcN-PI intermediate (17Pan Y.-T. De Gespari R. Warren C.D. Elbein A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8991-8999Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Pan Y.-T. Elbein A.D. Arch. Biochem.

In Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, Trypanosoma brucei, andLeishmania mexicana, the inhibition of mature GPI formation was shown to be because of the incorporation of ManN into Man-GlcN-PI. This results in the formation of an aberrant GPI intermediate, ManN-Man-GlcN-PI, which prevents further addition of Man residues because of the lack of a hydroxyl group on C2 (5Ralton J.E. Milne K.G.

Chem. 1993; 268: 9570-9577Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In P. falciparum, however, ManN inhibits GPI biosynthesis by inhibiting the addition of the first mannose to the inositol-acylated GlcN-PI, suggesting significant differences in the specificity of the parasite and mammalian enzymes. In conclusion, the data presented here show that intraerythrocyticP. falciparum synthesizes GPIs in a developmental stage-specific manner, exclusively at the trophozoite stage. The inhibition of P. falciparum GPI biosynthesis by mannosamine prevented the differentiation of trophozoites to schizonts. Mannosamine inhibits the GPI biosynthesis by a novel mechanism, which suggests that the enzymes of the parasite GPI biosynthetic pathway can be exploited as parasite-specific targets for the development of antimalarial drugs.

A complex of proteins (referred to as AUX240 for the 240-kDa antigenic protein it contains) identified with monoclonal antibodies raised against in vitro assembled 27 S editing complexes (editosomes) (29Schock D. Kuo S.-R. Steinberg M.F. Bolognino M. Sparks J.D. Sparks C.E. Smith H.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1097-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) has also been proposed to contain auxiliary proteins. The specific functional role that each candidate auxiliary protein may play in apoB mRNA editing remains to be further clarified. A direct demonstration of the intracellular site of editing activity through immunolocalization of APOBEC-1 has not been possible due to the very low level of expression of the enzyme in cells and tissues. Evidence for a nuclear localization of the editing activity was first provided through the demonstration of editing on polyadenylated but unspliced apoB mRNA and that the level of editing of spliced nuclear apoB mRNA was equivalent to that of cytoplasmic or total cellular mRNA (30Lau P.P. Xiong W. Zhu H.J. Chen S.H. Chan L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20550-20554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Chen L. Chan L. J. Theor. Biol. 1996; 183: 391-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). These findings were corroborated in studies in which chimeric splicing/editing RNA substrates were used to demonstrate that the close proximity of introns to the editing site within apoB encoding exon inhibited editing activity in McArdle cells until splicing had occurred (32Sowden M.P. Hamm J.K. Spinelli S. Smith H.C. RNA (N. Y.). 1996; 2: 274-288PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, the data suggested that editing of apoB mRNA took place in the cell nucleus; however, the possibility of cytoplasmic editing has not been ruled out. The localization of APOBEC-1 has been evaluated by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy of HA-tagged APOBEC-1 in transiently transfected McArdle cells and HepG2 human hepatoma cells (33Yang Y. Yang Y. Smith H.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13075-13080Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 34Siddiqui J.F.M. Van Mater D. Sowden M.P. Smith H.C. Exp. Cell. Res. 1999; 252: 154-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The enzyme was distributed in both the nucleus and cytoplasm of these cells but was localized in the cytoplasm of cells that did not support editing activity (Chinese hamster ovary and COS-7 cells). The nuclear distribution of APOBEC-1 required an N-terminal sequence (residues 13–35) similar to a bipartite nuclear localization signal (NLS). This sequence, however, was not sufficient to direct chimeric proteins to the nucleus and hence did not satisfy the strict definition of an NLS (33Yang Y. Yang Y. Smith H.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13075-13080Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The data suggested that auxiliary proteins may play an important role in determining the intracellular distribution of APOBEC-1. In contrast, residues 174–180 in the C terminus of APOBEC-1 behaved as a strong nuclear export signal (NES)/cytoplasmic retention signal (CRS) and were sufficient in directing chimeric proteins to the cytoplasm (33Yang Y. Yang Y. Smith H.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13075-13080Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). These findings further suggested that the nuclear and cytoplasm distribution may be due to the combined activities of interactions involving APOBEC-1's NLS and NES/CRS signals. We report here that apoB mRNA editing can be experimentally induced in the cytoplasm of McArdle cells, suggesting that auxiliary proteins as well as APOBEC-1 are distributed in both the nucleus and cytoplasm of liver cells. Biological alterations in the proportion of edited apoB mRNA appear, however, to result primarily or exclusively from changes in nuclear editing activity. The construction of plasmids encoding His6-HA-APOBEC-CMPK, His6-HA-APOBEC-1, and His6-HA-CMPK hence referred to as APOBEC-CMPK, APOBEC-1, and CMPK, respectively (33Yang Y. Yang Y. Smith H.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13075-13080Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), and the splicing/editing substrate IVS-apoB (32Sowden M.P. Hamm J.K. Spinelli S. Smith H.C. RNA (N.

Biol. 2000; 20: 1846-1854Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) was amplified from human total liver RNA by RT-PCR methodology with the following primers 5′-CTCGATATCATGGAATCAAATCACAAATCCGG and 5′-CTCTCTAGATCAGAAGGTGCCATATCCATC and subcloned via EcoRV and XbaI sites downstream of HA and His6epitope tags in a modified pcDNA3 vector (33Yang Y. Yang Y. Smith H.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13075-13080Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The rat hepatoma McArdle RH7777 cells were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA). Cells were transfected as reported previously (32Sowden M.P. Hamm J.K. Spinelli S. Smith H.C. RNA (N. Y.). 1996; 2: 274-288PubMed Google Scholar). Stable cell lines transfected with apobec-cmpk were obtained by limiting dilution under 500 μg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.) selection 48 h after transfection. Cells were treated with ethanol by rapidly mixing an appropriated aliquot of ethyl alcohol (AAPER Alcohol and Chemical Co.) into media as described previously (39Van Mater D. Sowden M.P. Cinaci J. Sparks J.D. Sparks C.E. Ballatori N. Smith H.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 252: 334-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). McArdle cells were processed into S-100 extracts as described previously (29Schock D. Kuo S.-R. Steinberg M.F. Bolognino M. Sparks J.D. Sparks C.E. Smith H.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Recombinant proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Qiagen) metal-chelating chromatography as described previously (19Yang Y. Smith H.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 797-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Total cellular RNA was isolated from approximately 2 × 106cells with Tri-Reagent (Molecular Research Center) according to the manufacturer's recommendations 24 h after transfection. Differential isolation of nuclear and cytoplasmic RNA was achieved by using NE-PERTM Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction Kit (Pierce) with the following modifications to the manufacturer's protocols. After cells were scraped from the tissue culture plates and processed through CER-I, RNase inhibitor (Eppendorf Scientific, Inc.) was added before the cells were lysed in CER-II buffer. The cytoplasmic fraction that was collected following centrifugation was transferred immediately to a fresh tube and mixed with 2 volumes of Tri-Reagent. The pellet containing partially purified nuclei (as evaluated by phase microscopy) was resuspended with Buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2) and purified by sedimentation through Buffer C (1 msucrose, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mmMgCl2) and centrifuged (150,000 × g for 15 min) at 7 °C. The purity of nuclei was assessed by microscopy, and nuclear RNA was extracted with 2 volumes of Tri-Reagent. Purified RNAs were digested with RQ-DNase I (Promega, Madison, WI) and RsaI or EcoRI to ensure the removal of copurifying endogenous rat or transfected human apoB DNA, respectively, prior to RT-PCR. Differential RT-PCR amplification of RNA transcripts at different stages in RNA processing was performed using primer pairs MS1/MS2 to generate PCR products from the prespliced IVS-apoB message, whereas MS3/MS2 was used to generate PCR product from the apoB exon (Fig. 1 A). Since the ratio of unspliced apoB mRNAversus completely processed apoB mRNA in total cellular RNA pool is small, the PCR products generated from apoB-specific primer pairs MS3/MS2 are more likely to represent mature apoB mRNA. The selective amplification of endogenous rat apoB mRNA or of human apoB mRNA in the reporter RNAs was performed using oligo(dT)-primed first strand cDNA synthesis coupled with RT-PCR as described previously (32Sowden M.P. Hamm J.K. Spinelli S. Smith H.C. RNA (N. Y.). 1996; 2: 274-288PubMed Google Scholar). For in vitro apoB RNA editing activity, 50-μl editing reactions containing 20 fmol of in vitro transcribed apoB RNA, 50 μg of S-100 extract from wild type McArdle cells and recombinant APOBEC-CMPK proteins were incubated at 30 °C for 3 h under conditions described previously (19Yang Y. Smith H.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 797-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 20Yang Y. Yang Y. Kovalski K. Smith H.C. J. Biol.

Editing efficiency was evaluated by poisoned primer extension analysis, and the primer extension products were resolved on a 10% denaturing polyacrylamide gel and quantified by laser densitometric scanning (PhosphorImager 425E, Molecular Dynamics) as described previously (20Yang Y.

Cells fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.4% Triton X-100 were incubated with anti-HA monoclonal antibody for 1 h at room temperature (Babco, Berkeley, CA; 1:500 in phosphate-buffered saline containing 3% bovine serum albumin), followed by incubation for 1 h at room temperature with fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (ICN/Cappel; 1:25 in 3% bovine serum albumin/phosphate-buffered saline). Coverslips were mounted onto DAPI containing mounting medium. Slides were observed under an Olympus BH-2 fluorescence microscope using a 40× Olympus objective. Protein extracts were made from approximately equal number of transfected cells and subsequently resolved and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, probed with anti-HA monoclonal antibody as described previously (33Yang Y. Yang Y. Smith H.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13075-13080Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). When the mRNA splicing cassette from the adenovirus late leader sequence was placed either 5′ or 3′ of a 492-nucleotide apoB exon containing the editing site, editing efficiency was markedly reduced in wild type McArdle cells (32Sowden M.P. Hamm J.K. Spinelli S. Smith H.C. RNA (N. Y.). 1996; 2: 274-288PubMed Google Scholar). In these studies, the number of edited apoB mRNA molecules at steady state was demonstrated to be dependent on the level of APOBEC-1 expression and was independent of the abundance of apoB mRNA or the presence of competing RNA editing substrates (32Sowden M.P. Hamm J.K. Spinelli S. Smith H.C. RNA (N. Y.). 1996; 2: 274-288PubMed Google Scholar, 34Siddiqui J.F.M. Van Mater D. Sowden M.P. Smith H.C. Exp. Cell. Res. 1999; 252: 154-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Taken together, the data suggested the “gating hypothesis” wherein editing was proposed to occur at a temporal and/or a spatial point (a gate) through which all apoB pre-mRNAs pass during their maturation. The number of apoB mRNA molecules that are edited at the gate was proposed to be determined by the probability of assembling functional editosomes on each mRNA, which in turn is determined by the number of APOBEC-1 molecules available for assembly into these editosomes. As a further test of the gating hypothesis, wild type McArdle cells and a stable transfected McArdle cell line expressing APOBEC-1 (McAPOBEC cells, Ref. 20Yang Y. Yang Y. Kovalski K. Smith H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27700-27706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) were transfected with plasmids encoding a splicing-editing RNA (IVS-apoB RNA) and the editing efficiency evaluated by poisoned primer extension analysis of RT-PCR product as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As determined previously (32Sowden M.P. Hamm J.K. Spinelli S. Smith H.C. RNA (N. Y.). 1996; 2: 274-288PubMed Google Scholar), the presence of an intron severely impaired editing efficiency of IVS-apoB RNA (Fig.1 A) in wild type McArdle cells 2.7% (n = 3, S.E. = 1.0%) (Fig. 1 B,first lane). Overexpression of APOBEC-1 in McAPOBEC cells markedly stimulated the editing of IVS-apoB 44% (n = 3, S.E. = 1.0%) (second lane). Additional editing of C6661 due to overexpression of APOBEC-1 (promiscuous editing Refs. 34Siddiqui J.F.M. Van Mater D. Sowden M.P. Smith H.C. Exp. Cell.

Chem. 1996; 271: 11506-11510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) was also observed. To evaluate whether the regulation of editing activity had occurred at a “gate” localized within the cell nucleus, the proportion of edited IVS-apoB RNA was determined in subcellular fractions of wild type McArdle and McAPOBEC cells. The quality of the nuclear preparation was evaluated by phase microscopy (Fig. 1 C), the gross morphological integrity of the isolated nuclei, and the virtual absence of cytoplasmic materials was apparent. The amount of edited nuclear IVS-apoB was low in wild type McArdle cells 2.1% (n = 3, S.E. = 0.5%) but may have been slightly higher than that determined in the cytoplasm 1.7% (n = 3, S.E. = 0.3%) (compare the first two lanes of Fig. 1 D). In contrast, an elevated proportion of edited IVS-apoB RNA was more apparent in the cytoplasm 48% (n = 3, S.E. = 2.3%) of McAPOBEC cells compared with that measured on nuclear IVS-apoB RNA 7.8% (n = 3, S.E. = 4.4%, the last two lanes of Fig. 1 D). The markedly higher proportion of edited RNA in the cytoplasm of McAPOBEC cells compared with that found in the nucleus suggested the unprecedented possibility that additional editing of spliced IVS-apoB RNA had occurred in the cytoplasm. To evaluate this possibility, an APOBEC-1 chimera was designed that would retain the enzyme in the cytoplasm through the addition of full-length CMPK (chicken muscle pyruvate kinase, a well characterized neutral cargo protein in the nuclear-cytoplasmic trafficking field) as bulk protein sequence (33Yang Y. Yang Y. Smith H.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13075-13080Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). To evaluate whether editing could occur in the cytoplasm, we targeted APOBEC-1 to the cytoplasm by taking advantage of our previous finding that the addition of protein mass to APOBEC-1 impaired the ability of the chimeric enzyme to localize within the nucleus (33Yang Y. Yang Y. Smith H.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13075-13080Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 34Siddiqui J.F.M. Van Mater D. Sowden M.P. Smith H.C. Exp. Cell. Res. 1999; 252: 154-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The chimeric enzyme retained editing activity as evident from the ability of HA- and His6-tagged APOBEC-CMPK fusion protein, purified from E. coli. to stimulate in vitro apoB editing in a concentration-dependent manner when added to wild type McArdle cell extracts (Fig.2). Having demonstrated that APOBEC-CMPK was functional in apoB mRNA editing, McArdle cells were transfected with plasmid encoding APOBEC-CMPK and evaluated for the intracellular distribution of this chimeric protein using antibodies specific for the HA tag in indirect immunofluorescence analysis. The data suggested that most, if not all, of APOBEC-CMPK was localized in the cytoplasm of transiently transfected McArdle cells (Fig. 3). If apoB mRNA editing was primarily a nuclear event, overexpression of APOBEC-CMPK should cause little or no change in the editing activity of McArdle cells due to its cytoplasmic distribution. To evaluate editing of the endogenous, McArdle cell apoB mRNA, cells were transiently transfected with plasmids encoding either APOBEC-1, CMPK, or APOBEC-CMPK cDNAs, and total cellular RNAs were isolated and analyzed. The expression of full-length wild type and chimeric proteins was evident on Western blots of cell extracts from an equivalent number of transfected cells (∼105) that were reacted with HA-specific antibody (Fig.4 A). APOBEC-1 expression elevated apoB mRNA editing in McArdle cells to 48% (n = 3, S.E. = 3.9%), whereas overexpression of CMPK as a negative control did not significantly change editing activity from that observed in untransfected cells, 14% (n = 3, S.E. = 1.9%) (Fig. 4 B). In contrast, overexpression of APOBEC-CMPK increased apoB mRNA editing efficiency to 50% (n = 3, S.E. = 4.6%). To evaluate whether the editing efficiency observed in cells expressing APOBEC-CMPK was dependent on the expression level of the enzyme, McArdle cell lines were established by clonal selection in the presence of G418, and cell lines expressing low, medium, and high levels of APOBEC-CMPK fusion protein were identified by Western blotting (Fig.4 C). Primer extension analysis of RT-PCR product specific to endogenous McArdle cell apoB mRNA demonstrated that the editing efficiency in three cell lines expressing low, medium, or high levels of APOBEC-CMPK was 22% (n = 3, S.E. = 1.2%), 50% (n = 3, S.E. = 1.8%), and 93% (n = 3, S.E. = 2.4%), respectively (Fig.4 D). The data demonstrated that the level of APOBEC-CMPK expression determined the proportion of edited apoB mRNA despite the enzyme's distribution in the cytoplasm and thereby support the possibility of cytoplasmic editing. The data raised the question of whether cytoplasmic APOBEC-CMPK was active on cytoplasmic apoB mRNA or whether a small amount of APOBEC-CMPK, which was below the detection limit of immunofluorescence microscopy, was in the nucleus for a period of time long enough to edit nuclear apoB. If APOBEC-CMPK's editing activity was cytoplasmic, then the proportion of edited apoB should not be inhibited by the placement of introns adjacent to the editing site, and the proportion of edited apoB RNAs in the cytoplasm should be substantially higher than that observed with nuclear apoB RNA. In contrast, if APOBEC-CMPK editing activity occurred exclusively or predominantly in the nucleus, then nuclear apoB RNAs should reflect elevated levels of editing activity equivalent to that determined on total cellular apoB RNAs. The cellular site of editing was evaluated in the APOBEC-CMPK high level expression McArdle cell line and wild type McArdle cells as negative control following transiently transfection of a plasmid encoding IVS-apoB. The proportion of edited apoB RNA was assayed 24 h after tra"

We previously reported that the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) induces growth arrest and myogenic differentiation in these cells, which constitutively express muscle regulatory factors. We show that TPA inhibits the activation of secreted latent TGF-beta, thus decreasing the concentration of active TGF-beta to which the cells are exposed. This event is mediated by the TPA-induced alteration of the uPA/PAI serine-protease system. Complete removal of TGF-beta, mediated by the ectopic expression of a soluble type II TGF-beta receptor dominant negative cDNA, induces growth arrest, but does not trigger differentiation. In contrast, a reduction in the TGF-beta concentration, to a range of 0.14-0.20 x 10(-2) ng/ml (which is similar to that measured in TPA-treated cells), mimics TPA-induced differentiation. Taken together, these data demonstrate that cell growth and suppression of differentiation in rhabdomyosarcoma cells require overproduction of active TGF-beta; furthermore, they show that a 'critical' concentration of TGF-beta is necessary for myogenic differentiation to occur, whereas myogenesis is abolished below and above this concentration. By impairing the TGF-beta autocrine loop, TPA stabilizes the factor concentration within the range compatible for differentiation to occur. In contrast, in human primary muscle cells a much higher concentration of exogenous TGF-beta is required for the differentiation inhibitory effect and TPA inhibits differentiation in these cells probably through a TGF-beta independent mechanism. These data thus clarify the mechanism underlying the multiple roles of TGF-beta in the regulation of both the transformed and differentiated phenotype."

As we have demonstrated previously, DnaG is recruited to the replication fork via a transient protein-protein interaction with DnaB. Here, using site-directed amino acid mutagenesis, we have defined the region on DnaB required for this protein-protein interaction. Mutations in this region of DnaB affect the DnaB-DnaG interaction during both general priming-directed and φX174 complementary strand DNA synthesis, as well as at replication forks reconstituted in rolling circle DNA replication reactions. The behavior of the purified mutant DnaB proteins in the various replication systems suggests that access to the DnaG binding pocket on DnaB may be restricted at the replication fork.

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 673-719Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There are two primosomes inEscherichia coli, one that forms in a DnaA-directed fashion at the chromosomal origin, oriC, and one that forms at recombination intermediates to restart stalled or aborted replication forks (2Marians K.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 185-189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The replicative primosome formed at oriC requires DnaB, DnaC, and DnaG for assembly, whereas the replication restart primosome (formerly the φX174-type primosome (3Sandler S.J. Marians K.J. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 9-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar)), which can form at D loops (4Liu J. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25033-25041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), requires PriA, PriB, DnaT, and possibly PriC, in addition to the former three proteins, for assembly (3Sandler S.J. Marians K.J. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 9-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Primosomes provide both the DNA unwinding and Okazaki fragment-priming functions of the replisome. In the case of each of the bacterial primosomes, these activities are provided by DnaB and DnaG, respectively. To form a replication fork, DnaB must be placed onto single-stranded (ss)1 DNA that is coated with the single-stranded DNA-binding protein (SSB). Whereas DnaB itself can bind to naked ssDNA, it is prevented from doing so in vivo because it is found in a stoichiometric complex with DnaC (5Wickner S. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 921-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). DnaC, which has a cryptic ssDNA binding activity that is activated when it is complexed with DnaB (6Learn B.A. Um S.-J. Huang L. McMacken R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1154-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), can transfer DnaB to naked ssDNA but not to SSB-coated DNA. This mechanism presumably prevents promiscuous loading of DnaB to any region of the chromosome that happens to become single-stranded. Thus, DnaB must be directed to specific regions of the DNA by the action of other proteins that somehow manage to create an SSB-free region of ssDNA. AtoriC this is accomplished by a protein-protein interaction between DnaA and DnaB (7Kaguni J.M. Kornberg A. Cell. 1984; 38: 183-190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). During replication fork reactivation, PriA identifies the site for restart primosome loading (2Marians K.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 185-189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 3Sandler S.J. Marians K.J. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 9-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 8Liu J. Xu L. Sandler S.J. Marians K.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3552-3555Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), and it is probably a protein-protein interaction between DnaT and DnaB that mediates transfer of DnaB to SSB-coated DNA (9Liu J. Nurse P. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15656-15661Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Initial studies demonstrated that DnaG, which had been identified as a primase (10Wickner S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 72: 2815-2819Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 11Bouché J.-P. Zechel K. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 5995-6001Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was not present in restart primosomes formed in the absence of DNA synthesis and isolated by gel filtration bound to φX174 ss(c)DNA. For primer synthesis to occur, DnaG had to be added back to those protein-DNA complexes (12Weiner J.H. McMacken R. Kornberg A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 752-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 13Wickner S. Denhardt D. Dressler D. Ray D. The Single-Stranded DNA Phages. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1978: 255-271Google Scholar). We showed that this was also the case at active replication forks, i.e. DnaG did not remain permanently associated with the replication fork; rather, a new molecule of DnaG was recruited from solution to synthesize the primer for each new Okazaki fragment (14Wu C.A. Zechner E.L. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4030-4044Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This distributive action, with respect to the cycle of Okazaki fragment synthesis, of DnaG at the replication fork acts to regulate the size of the nascent lagging-strand fragments. Thus, Okazaki fragment size is inversely related to the concentration of DnaG in the reaction mixture (14Wu C.A. Zechner E.L. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4030-4044Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,15Zechner E.L. Wu C.A. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4045-4053Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Using partial proteolysis to resolve DnaG into independent domains, we demonstrated that the C-terminal 16 kDa of the protein were not required for primer synthesis but were required for DnaG activity in any replication assay that also required DnaB (16Tougu K. Peng H. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4675-4682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because the isolated C-terminal fragment of DnaG could compete with the intact protein at the replication fork and cause Okazaki fragment size to be altered, we concluded that this domain mediated a protein-protein interaction between DnaB and DnaG that acted to recruit DnaG to the replication fork. Subsequent studies indicated that the C-terminal 16 amino acids of DnaG were crucial to the interaction with DnaB (17Tougu K. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21391-21397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). For example, at identical concentrations, DnaG Q576A directs the synthesis of Okazaki fragments that are at least 15-fold longer in size than those directed by the wild type protein (18Tougu K. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21398-21405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Here we report the isolation of reciprocal mutations in DnaB that specifically affect the DnaB-DnaG interaction at the replication fork. As was the case with the mutant DnaG proteins, the mutant DnaB proteins direct the synthesis of larger Okazaki fragments at the replication fork than the wild type protein. These mutations lie in the N-terminal region of DnaB, mapping very close together in the crystal structure (19Fass D. Bogden C.E. Berger J.M. Structure. 1999; 7: 691-698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), and do not affect the ability of the mutant proteins to act as replication fork DNA helicases. Interestingly, the mutant proteins display a different spectrum of activities in a number of DNA replication systems that utilize DnaB, suggesting that the DnaB-DnaG interaction at the replication fork is further modulated by another factor.

SSB was purified according to Minden and Marians (27Minden J.S. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 9316-9325Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The precise dnaB open reading frame was removed from pET3c-dnaB (22Marians K.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 507-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) by digestion withNdeI and BamHI and inserted into NdeI- and BamHI-digested pET15b to give pET15b-dnaB. This results in the addition of 20 amino acids onto the N terminus of DnaB. This tag includes a hexahistidine sequence and a thrombin cleavage site. Mutant alleles encoding the E32A, E32K, and Y105A amino acid substitutions in DnaB were engineered according to the Stratagene Quick Change technique as per the manufacturer's instructions. Mutated alleles were completely sequenced before use. For purification, BL21(DE3)pLysS (Novagen) carrying either a wild type or mutant pET21a-dnaB plasmid was grown in 12 liters of L broth supplemented with 0.4% glucose and 0.5 mg/ml ampicillin toA 600 = 0.4. isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was then added to 0.4 mm, and the synthesis of the target protein was induced for 2 h. The cells were harvested and resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0 at 4 °C) and 10% sucrose to 50% w/v, frozen in liquid N2, and stored at −80 °C. Because of the extreme overproduction, DnaB was followed during purification by SDS-PAGE. The cell suspension was thawed quickly and brought to 1 mm PMSF, 0.1% Brij-58, and 0.2 mg/ml lysozyme. The suspension was incubated briefly on ice as required for cell lysis and then sedimented in the Sorvall A841 rotor at 37,000 rpm for 1 h at 4 °C. The lysate was applied immediately to a 10-ml column of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) equilibrated in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5 at 4 °C), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm PMSF, and 10% sucrose. The column was then washed with two column volumes of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5 at 4 °C), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm PMSF, 10 mm imidazole-HCl (pH 8.0), and 10% glycerol. DnaB was eluted from the column with a 10-column volume gradient of 10–300 mm imidazole-HCl (pH 8) in the same buffer. Fractions (0.5 ml) containing DnaB were pooled and dialyzed overnight against ATP agarose buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5 at 4 °C), 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm MgCl2,1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm PMSF, 50 mm NaCl, and 20% glycerol). The dialyzed fraction was applied to and eluted from an ATP-agarose column and dialyzed into storage buffer as described previously (22Marians K.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 507-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). An SDS-PAGE gel of the purified wild type, E32A, E32K, and Y105A mutant DnaBs is shown in Fig.1. Multiple experiments demonstrated that the N-His tag had essentially no effect on DnaB activity. As an example, titrations comparing the activity of wild type DnaB and N-His DnaB E32A (a mutant DnaB with activities indistinguishable from wild type; see “Results”) in the rolling circle DNA replication assay are shown in Fig. 2.Figure 2Comparison of the activity of N-His-tagged and wild type DnaB. Standard rolling circle replication reactions containing either wild type (WT) or N-His-DnaB E32A at the indicated concentrations (DnaB concentration increases 3-fold inlanes 1–5 and 6–10 from left toright) were performed and analyzed as indicated under “Materials and Methods.” A, alkaline agarose gel electrophoresis of the reaction products.

Both assays were stopped by the addition of 100 μl of 0.2 m NaPPi. After addition of 100 μl of 1 mg/ml heat-denatured salmon sperm DNA as carrier, trichloroacetic acid-insoluble radioactivity was then determined. For the φX174 ss(c) → replicative form assay, reaction mixtures (25 μl) contained the standard buffer, φX174 ss(c)DNA (220 pmol as nucleotide), 750 ng of SSB, 1 mm ATP, 100 μm CTP, GTP, and UTP, 40 μm dNTPs including [3H]dTTP (150 cpm/pmol),12 nm either wild type or mutant DnaB, 72 nm DnaC, 10 nm DnaT, 15 nm PriA, 15 nm PriB, 15 nm PriC, 10 nm DNA polymerase III HE (Pol III HE), and the indicated concentrations of DnaG. Reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 10 min. For the general priming assay, reaction mixtures (25 μl) contained the standard buffer, φX174 ss(c)DNA (330 pmol as nt), 1 mm ATP, 200 μm CTP, GTP, and UTP, 40 μm dNTPs including [3H]dTTP (150 cpm/pmol), 12 nmDnaB, 10 nm DNA Pol III HE, and the indicated concentrations of DnaG. The reaction mixture was incubated at 30 °C for 15 min. Tailed form II (TFII) DNA was prepared as described by Mok and Marians (20Mok M. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16644-16654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For rolling circle DNA replication with the complete restart primosome, reaction mixtures (12 μl) containing 50 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.9), 12 mm MgOAc, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 5 μm ATP, 80 mm KCl, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1.1 μm SSB, 0.42 nm TFII DNA, 3.2 nm DnaB, 56 nm DnaC, 680 nm DnaG, 28 nm DnaT, 2.5 nm PriA, 2.5 nmPriB, 2.5 nm PriC, and 28 nm Pol III HE were preincubated at 30 °C for 2 min. NTPs were added to final concentrations of 1 mm ATP, 200 μm GTP, 200 μm CTP, and 200 μm UTP, and dNTPs to 40 μm, and the reaction was incubated for 2 min at 30 °C (stage 1). [α-32P]dATP (2000–4000 cpm/pmol) was added to the reaction mixture, and the incubation was continued at 30 °C for an additional 10 min (stage 2). For rolling circle DNA replication with only DnaB and DnaG, reaction mixtures were identical except that PriA, PriB, PriC, and DnaT were omitted, and the concentrations of DnaB and DnaC were increased to 80 nm and 1 μm, respectively. In addition, the SSB was added along with the nucleotides during the stage 1 incubation rather than at the start of the incubation. DNA synthesis was quenched by addition of EDTA to 40 mm. Total DNA synthesis was determined by assaying an aliquot of the reaction mixture for acid-insoluble radioactivity. DNA products were analyzed by alkaline gel electrophoresis as described (20Mok M. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16644-16654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DnaB activity is crucial to the proper function of the replisome. Not only does the protein provide the DNA unwinding necessary for replication fork propagation, it also serves to attract DnaG to the replication fork via a protein-protein interaction. In addition, another protein-protein interaction between DnaB and the τ subunit of the DNA Pol III HE literally cements the replisome together, stimulating the helicase activity of DnaB (28Kim S. Dallmann H.G. McHenry C.S. Marians K.J. Cell. 1996; 84: 643-650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar) and defining which of the two polymerase cores in the holoenzyme becomes the leading-strand polymerase (29Kim S. Dallmann H.G. McHenry C.S. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4315-4318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 30Yuzhakov A. Turner J. O'Donnell M. Cell. 1996; 86: 877-886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Thus, understanding replication fork function requires observation of the effects of disrupting these interactions. To define the regions on DnaB that are involved in these important protein-protein interactions, we have subjected dnaB to alanine scanning and charge reversal mutagenesis. The mutated proteins are expressed and purified by a combination of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose and ATP-agarose affinity chromatography, and the initial screening of their biochemical phenotype was performed using rolling circle DNA replication. Rolling circle DNA replication is established on a tailed form II DNA template by the addition of the replication restart primosomal proteins (including the mutant DnaB under consideration), SSB, and the DNA Pol III HE. We use this system as the initial screen because, as we have documented previously (14Wu C.A. Zechner E.L. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4030-4044Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Mok M. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16644-16654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it accurately mimics the behavior of the cellular DNA replication fork. Moreover, the products of rolling circle DNA replication are cleanly resolved by alkaline agarose gel electrophoresis into a large leading-strand population that barely enters the gel and a population of Okazaki fragments that is typically centered about 1.5–2.5 kilobases in length. Thus, mutant DnaBs affected in the functions described above can therefore easily be identified as a result of the predicted effect on the products of the reaction. When incorporated into the replisome, DnaB proteins that have become modified in their ability to interact with DnaG should exhibit, at identical concentrations of primase, a population of Okazaki fragments of altered size compared with those made at replication forks reconstituted with the wild-type protein. This is because, as described above, Okazaki fragment size is controlled by the cycle of DnaG binding to and dissociating from DnaB at the replication fork. Thus, any change in the affinity of this interaction will result in a change in the average size of the population of Okazaki fragments synthesized. We have identified two single amino acid substitutions in DnaB that fulfill these predictions. These mutant DnaB proteins were culled from a set of mutant proteins engineered by substituting charged amino acid residues that were conserved among DnaB proteins on the assumption that these residues were more likely to reside on the surface of the protein, and thus altering them might affect protein-protein interactions. When wild type DnaB was used to reconstitute rolling circle replication, Okazaki fragment size reached its minimum as a function of DnaG concentration between 100 and 200 nm (Fig.3). In fact, the average size of Okazaki fragments synthesized at these two concentrations was nearly identical. Reduction of the DnaG concentration below 100 nm resulted in a large increase in Okazaki fragment size, such that at 25 nm, it was not possible to determine the average size of the fragments because the population of lagging-strand products had merged with the population of leading-strand products. Replication forks reconstituted with DnaB E32A produced Okazaki fragment populations that were identical to those made in the presence of the wild type protein (Fig. 3); however, those containing DnaB E32K consistently produced Okazaki fragments that were about 3-fold longer than those synthesized by replication forks containing either the wild type or E32A DnaB (Fig. 3). Okazaki fragments produced by replication forks containing DnaB Y105A were even longer (Fig. 3). Note that in Fig. 3, the lowest concentration of DnaG in the titration of DnaB Y105A is nearly 90% greater than the highest value in the titration for either the wild type, E32A, or E32K DnaBs. And even at 3 μm DnaG, Okazaki fragments synthesized by replication forks containing DnaB Y105A are still larger than those synthesized by replication forks containing the wild type protein with DnaG at 100 nm. A conservative estimate is that at equivalent concentrations of DnaG, the Okazaki fragments synthesized by replication forks containing DnaB Y105A are at least 15-fold larger than those synthesized by replication forks containing the wild type DnaB. Given that DnaB is also the replication fork DNA helicase, the observed variation in Okazaki fragment size as a function of the DnaB present at the fork could arise for one of two reasons. It could be, as described above, that the mutations actually affected the affinity of the protein-protein interaction between DnaB and DnaG. On the other hand, it could also be that the mutations affected the rate of replication fork progression. The size of an Okazaki fragment is essentially the distance on the lagging-strand template between two successful DnaG-primed initiation events by the lagging-strand polymerase. Because in the rolling circle system the nascent leading strand is the lagging-strand template, Okazaki fragment size can also be made to vary at a fixed concentration of DnaG by altering the rate at which the lagging-strand template is generated, i.e. by altering the rate of DnaB-catalyzed unwinding at the replication fork. Although we considered this explanation unlikely because in this scenario DnaB Y105A would have to have at least a 15-fold greater rate of DNA unwinding at the replication fork than the wild-type protein, we compared the rate of replication fork progression for the wild type and mutant proteins directly. The rate of replication fork progression sustained by replisomes containing either the wild type or mutant DnaBs was assessed by sampling rolling circle replication reactions in 10-s intervals from the start of the incubation and analyzing the products by alkaline agarose gel electrophoresis (Fig. 4). The change in the length of the longest leading-strand present is a direct measure of the rate of replication fork movement. As evident in Fig. 4, the size of the nascent leading-strand was identical at each time point for the wild type and three mutant DnaBs. We thus conclude that the E32A, E32K, and Y105A amino acid substitutions have not affected, in any gross manner, the ability of that particular DnaB to act as the replication fork DNA helicase. Thus, the variation in Okazaki fragment size observed with replication forks containing the mutant DnaB proteins is very likely the result of an alteration of the affinity of the interaction between the mutated DnaB and DnaG. The results described above suggested that the interaction between DnaG and DnaB Y105A was more severely altered than the interaction between DnaG and DnaB E32K. If this were the case, it should also hold true in the general priming reaction where only DnaB and DnaG are present with the HE. In this reaction, DnaB binds to the protein-free ss(c)DNA and then serves to attract DnaG to synthesize a primer that is then elongated by the HE. Alterations in the affinity of the interaction between DnaB and DnaG can therefore be directly read out from the dose response curve of DnaG concentration. Surprisingly, both the E32K and Y105A DnaBs behaved identically in the general priming reaction (Fig. 5). At subsaturating levels of primase, about 2–2.5-fold higher concentrations of DnaG were required to support an equivalent amount of nucleotide incorporation as wild type DnaB when these two mutant proteins were present in the assay. As expected, DnaB E32A did not exhibit any defect in this assay; if anything, it might been somewhat more active than the wild type. The general priming data would have predicted that both DnaB E32K and DnaB Y105A would show similar defects at replication forks. However, although at the same concentration of DnaG the lagging-strand products formed in the presence of either mutant protein are clearly larger than those formed in the presence of the wild type, the Okazaki fragments formed by the DnaB Y105 forks are much larger than those formed by the DnaB E32K forks. We considered that this apparent difference might be because there are probably more proteins present on the DNA at replication forks formed in the rolling circle system, which utilizes all the restart primosomal proteins, than in the general priming system, which utilizes only DnaB and DnaG. We therefore compared the activity of the mutant protein during synthesis of the complementary strand of φX174 ss(c)DNA. In this assay, SSB-coated φX viral DNA is converted to the replicative form by the formation of a restart primosome at the primosome assembly site. The primosome catalyzes primer synthesis, and the primer is elongated by the HE to form the complementary strand. Once again, both the E32K and Y105A DnaBs required higher concentrations of primase to sustain the same level of nucleotide incorporation as the wild-type protein (Fig.6). In this case, the defect exhibited by DnaB Y105A was somewhat greater than that exhibited by DnaB E32K. Thus, it was possible that the presence of other primosomal proteins at the replication fork might alter the interaction between DnaB and DnaG and exacerbate the effect of the Y105A amino acid substitution. This predicts that the E32K and Y105A DnaBs should behave identically at replication forks reconstituted in the presence of only DnaB, DnaC, and DnaG. Typically, we use all the restart primosomal proteins to form replication forks in the rolling circle system. This is because loading of DnaB to DNA by DnaC is relatively inefficient. Auxiliary proteins are required to maximize the process. At oriC, this is accomplished by DnaA, which has been shown to interact with DnaB (31Marszalek J. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4883-4890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Effectively, the combination of PriA, PriB, DnaT, and possibly PriC (32Ng J.Y. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15642-15648Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 33Liu J. Nurse P. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15649-15655Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) act as the equivalent of DnaA at the primosome assembly site on φX viral DNA and at recombination intermediates (8Liu J. Xu L. Sandler S.J. Marians K.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3552-3555Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). However, replication forks can be formed in the rolling circle system in the absence of PriA, PriB, PriC, and DnaT if the concentration of DnaB and DnaC is increased 15–20-fold (20Mok M. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16644-16654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the reaction has to be staged somewhat differently because DnaC cannot load DnaB to SSB-coated DNA. Thus, DnaB and DnaC are exposed to the TFII template first for a short period of time, and then SSB is added. Interestingly, the dramatic difference between the Y105A and E32K DnaBs was maintained at replication forks formed in the absence of PriA, PriB, PriC, and DnaT (Fig. 7). Replication forks formed in the presence of the E32K protein consistently gave Okazaki fragments that were, at equivalent concentrations of DnaG, about 2–3-fold longer than those synthesized at replication forks formed in the presence of DnaB E32A (which is essentially identical to wild type). On the other hand, at the DnaG concentrations shown, Okazaki fragments produced by replication forks formed in the presence of DnaB Y105A were very long and could barely be distinguished from the leading-strand DNA. To prove that Okazaki fragments were, in fact, being made at replication forks formed in the presence of DnaB Y105A, the ability of a restriction enzyme to digest the DNA products formed was examined.BamHI will only digest the rolling circle DNA product if both leading- and lagging-strand DNA had been synthesized, producing a duplex DNA tail. This was the case when DNA made by replication forks containing wild-type DnaB was tr"

Therefore, X11L is thought to play an important role in regulating the amyloidogenic pathway of APP metabolism in neuronal tissues and thus contributing to the pathogenesis of AD.X11L has 53.5% amino acid homology with X11 protein (4Duclos F.

These results suggest that the distinct functions of X11L and/or X11, if both proteins function independently, may be mediated by protein-protein interactions involving their divergent amino-terminal domains.In this study, we isolated XB51 (name derived fromX11L-binding-protein of clone number51) as a protein that interacts with the amino-terminal domain of human X11L. XB51 is expressed in a neuron-specific manner in mouse and inhibits the association of X11L with APP. Therefore, the interaction between XB51 and X11L may regulate the function of either or both of these two molecules. Furthermore, association of XB51 with X11L abolished the suppression of Aβ40 production by X11L. These observations suggest that X11L and XB51 play a role in the regulation of metabolism and function of APP.DISCUSSIONThe protein X11L is thought to regulate Aβ generation (1Tomita S. Ozaki T.

Its PI and PDZ domains are important for the interaction with APP and the regulation of Aβ generation. We also found that the amino-terminal domain can regulate the binding affinity of X11L for APP (1Tomita S. Ozaki T. Taru H. Oguchi S. Takeda S. Yagi Y. Sakiyama Y. Kirino Y. Suzuki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2243-2254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). To elucidate the physiological role of the amino-terminal domain of X11L, we first isolated proteins that interact with the amino-terminal domain of X11L.In the present study, we focused on XB51, an X11L-binding protein. The mXB51 protein lacks the middle 34-amino acid sequence of hXB51, but the sequence otherwise shows strong homology with hXB51. However, the tissue specificity of hXB51 expression differs from that of mXB51 expression, which is brain-specific. The difference in the expression of XB51 between human and mouse is not artificial, as an autoradiogram of a membrane blotted with human RNA and probed with mX11L (a cross-hybridization study) gave a result identical to that observed in Fig. 1 b and vice versa (data not shown).We observed that XB51 efficiently inhibited the interaction of X11L with APP. Association of XB51 with X11L may alter the conformation of X11L so that it can no longer interact with APP. XB51 was also found to inhibit the interaction between X11L and APP using a yeast three-hybrid assay (data not shown). It has already been reported that X11L slightly suppresses the production of Aβ40 (1Tomita S. Ozaki T. Taru H. Oguchi S. Takeda S. Yagi Y. Sakiyama Y. Kirino Y. Suzuki T. J. Biol.

We observed that the suppression of Aβ40 production in cells expressing X11L was abolished by the concomitant expression of XB51. Our present and previous results (1Tomita S. Ozaki T. Taru H.

This suppression of Aβ40 generation was abolished by dissociation of X11L from APP resulting from association of XB51 with X11L. Although the mechanisms regulating the metabolism of APP and secretion of Aβ are as yet not well revealed, the present results suggest the importance of X11L and XB51 in the regulatory system of APP metabolism and Aβ generation.

Their independence from host cell nuclear functions is aided by a distinctive replication and transcription apparatus encoded by viral genes (for a review, see Ref.2Moss B. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Chanock R.M. Monath T.P. Howley P.M. Melnick J.L. Roizman B. Strauss S.E. 3rd Ed. Poxviridae: The Viruses and Their Replication. 2. Lippincott-Raven, Philadelphia1996: 2637-2671Google Scholar). Virion enzymes produce mature viral mRNA with eukaryotic features, including a 5′ cap and a 3′ poly(A) tail. Vaccinia virus genes are expressed in a cascade that is divided into three temporal classes: early, intermediate, and late. Despite its complexity, the viral RNA polymerase requires separate and nonoverlapping sets of auxiliary proteins to initiate transcription of each gene class. Transcription of early genes occurs in the cytoplasm within the infecting core structure. The translation products of viral early mRNAs include RNA polymerase subunits and factors needed for intermediate gene transcription, which occurs after the onset of DNA replication. Late transcription follows intermediate and requires the synthesis of transcription factors encoded by viral intermediate genes. Host factors are also employed in both intermediate (3Rosales R. Sutter G. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3794-3798Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and late (4Gunasinghe S.K. Hubbs A.E. Wright C.F. J. Biol.

Shuman S. Moss B. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10754-10760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and virion RNA polymerase possessing the RNA polymerase-associated protein RAP94, the product of theH4Lgene (7Ahn B.Y.

Chem. 1994; 269: 14323-14328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Only the virion RNA polymerase molecules containing RAP94 can functionally interact with VETF to transcribe a double-stranded DNA template possessing a viral early promoter (9Ahn B.Y. Gershon P.D. Moss B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7552-7557Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike the other subunits of vaccinia virus RNA polymerase, RAP94 is present in submolar amounts and synthesized exclusively late in infection, whereupon it is packaged into nascent virions (7Ahn B.Y. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3536-3540Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Early viral genes are unique in that transcription terminates in a signal- and factor-dependent manner (10Rohrmann G. Yuen L. Moss B. Cell. 1986; 46: 1029-1035Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 11Shuman S. Broyles S.S. Moss B. J. Biol.

Elongation proceeds through the sequence TTTTTNT in the nontemplate strand, yielding UUUUUNU in the nascent mRNA, which serves as a signal required for the termination event (13Yuen L. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6417-6421Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 14Shuman S. Moss B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21356-21360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Termination requires both the vaccinia termination factor (VTF)1 (also serves as viral mRNA capping enzyme) (11Shuman S. Broyles S.S. Moss B. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12372-12380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and nucleoside triphosphate phosphohydrolase I (NPH I), the product of the D11Lgene, as the ATPase employed in transcription termination (15Deng L. Shuman S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 538-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar,16Christen L.M. Sanders M. Wiler C. Niles E.G. Virology. 1998; 245: 360-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). During infection, transcription termination is restricted to early genes. In vitro, only RNA polymerase capable of recognizing early promoters is subject to signal-dependent termination, suggesting that this form of RNA polymerase is uniquely termination-competent (17Condit R.C. Lewis J.I. Quinn M. Christen L.M. Niles E.G. Virology. 1996; 218: 169-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Prior work indicates the presence of a multicomponent virion transcription complex. Broyles and Moss (18Broyles S.S. Moss B. Mole. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 7-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) showed that activities corresponding to two enzymes, vaccinia termination factor (VTF/capping enzyme) and nucleoside triphosphate phosphohydrolase I (ssDNA-dependent ATPase; NPH I), partially co-sedimented with the virion RNA polymerase complex that specifically initiates and terminates early gene transcription. Moreover, Zhang et al. (19Zhang Y. Ahn B.Y. Moss B. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 1360-1370Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) showed that nascent RAP94-deficient core particles exhibit low or undetectable amounts of the viral RNA polymerase, capping enzyme/termination factor, poly (A) polymerase, DNA-dependent ATPase, RNA helicase, and topoisomerase. The presence of these unpackaged viral enzymes in the cytoplasm indicated that RAP94 is required for targeting a complex of functionally related proteins involved in early gene transcription. Previous work from our laboratory showed that short COOH-terminal deletion mutations of NPH I, which retain ATPase activity, failed to terminate or to inhibit wild type NPH I-dependent transcription termination activityin vitro (16Christen L.M. Sanders M. Wiler C. Niles E.G. Virology. 1998; 245: 360-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). One appealing model proposes that the COOH-terminal end of NPH I binds to one or more components in the termination complex. One likely candidate is RAP94, which is unique to the virion form of RNA polymerase capable of terminating early gene transcription. In this report, we show that NPH I (D11L) binds to the H4L subunit of virion RNA polymerase (RAP94). The interaction site is mapped to the COOH-terminal 175 amino acids of NPH I and the NH2-terminal 195 amino acids of H4L. Carboxyl-terminal deletion mutations of NPH I that retain both ATPase and DNA binding activities fail to bind H4L. COOH-terminal deletions also fail to mediate transcript release or to inhibit wild type NPH I's transcript release activity. These data provide an explanation for the observation that UUUUUNU-dependent transcription termination is restricted to early genes, whose transcription is catalyzed by the H4L-containing virion RNA polymerase. Wild type (WT) vaccinia virus strain WR and the temperature-sensitive (ts) mutant virus, C50, (20Condit R.C. Motyczka A. Virology. 1981; 113: 224-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 21Condit R.C. Motyczka A. Spizz G. Virology. 1983; 128: 429-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) were propagated in BSC40 African green monkey cells at 37 °C or the permissive temperature for ts mutants, 31 °C, respectively, as described (20Condit R.C. Motyczka A. Virology. 1981; 113: 224-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Crude virus-containing extracts of infected cells were prepared by freeze/thaw, and infectious virus titer was determined by plaque assay on BSC40 cells at the permissive temperature, 31 °C, and the nonpermissive temperature, 40 °C. BSC1 cells (ATCC CCL6) were used for plaque purification and guanine phosphoribosyl transferase selection (22Falkner F.G. Moss B. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 1849-1854Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Propagation of recombinant virus vNPHINGST was carried out in BSC1 cell monolayers at 37 °C, in the presence of mycophenolic acid (MPA; 25 μg/ml). Recombinant vaccinia virus, vTF7–3 (23Fuerst T.R. Niles E.G. Studier F.W. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8122-8126Crossref PubMed Scopus (1874) Google Scholar), expressing T7 RNA polymerase, was propagated in BSC40 cells at 37 °C. BSC40 cells were infected with WT virus at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 0.2/cell, at 37 °C. Following incubation for 2 h, the infected cells were transfected with 1.7 μg of pTM3GST/NPHI mixed with CaCl2 (125 mm final) for 15 min at room temperature. Medium was then added to the infected cells, and incubation was continued at 37 °C. After 4 h, the medium was replaced, and cells were incubated for 2–3 days until they exhibited complete cell killing. The infected cells were then scraped, pelleted, and resuspended in 300 μl of PBS (170 mm NaCl, 3.35 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 1.8 mm KH2PO4). BSC1 cells were pretreated with MPA (25 μg/ml), xanthine (0.25 mg/ml), and hypoxanthine (15 μg/ml) and used for plaque purification and guanine phosphoribosyl transferase selection (22Falkner F.G. Moss B. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 1849-1854Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant vaccinia virus with a GST tag at the NH2 terminus of the gene encoding NPH I was isolated by plaque purification and named vNPHINGST. Each plaque was subjected to three rounds of purification. A combination of GST and T7 terminator primers was employed in a diagnostic polymerase chain reaction, in order to distinguish between crossing over into thymidine kinase versus WT NPH I loci. Approximately 1 × 107 BSC1 cells were co-infected with 5 m.o.i./cell of vTF7–3 (23Fuerst T.R. Niles E.G. Studier F.W. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8122-8126Crossref PubMed Scopus (1874) Google Scholar) and vNPHINGST viruses. As a negative control, BSC1 cells were also infected with each of these viruses separately. The infected cells were incubated for 8 h at 37 °C in a regular medium. Following incubation, the regular medium was removed, and the cells were washed with methionine-free medium. The cells were then pulse-labeled for 1 h at 37 °C with 65 μCi/ml of [35S]methionine in 2.0 ml of methionine-free medium. After the labeling period, the isotope was removed, and the monolayers were washed twice with PBS. The pulse-labeled cells were harvested and lysed by the addition of 1.5 ml of radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1% SDS, 140 mm NaCl, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 1% bovine serum albumin, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.025% sodium azide). The lysed cells were frozen at −20 °C, and after thawing, the cell debris was transferred to an Eppendorf microcentrifuge tube. The cell extracts were cleared by centrifugation for 15 min in a microcentrifuge at 4 °C. The supernatants were then incubated with 200 μl (bed volume) of glutathione-Sepharose resin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Resins were then washed four times in buffer A (25 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol (w/v), 50 mm NaCl), and the resin-bound proteins were resolved on SDS-PAGE for evaluation. Proteins were resolved on a 12.5% polyacrylamide SDS gel, and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The blot was blocked with 3% gelatin and probed with rabbit polyclonal antibodies (diluted 1:1000 in 1% gelatin) raised against a pATH fusion protein containing amino acids 202–631 of NPH I or the NH2-terminal 256 amino acids of H4L subunit of virion RNA polymerase. Following several washes, the blot was incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG (diluted 1:20,000 in 1% gelatin) conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. The Supersignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce) was then used for the development of immunoblots followed by autoradiography. Extracts of virus-infected cells were prepared by lysolecithin treatment, as described (17Condit R.C. Lewis J.I. Quinn M. Christen L.M. Niles E.G. Virology. 1996; 218: 169-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). A549 cells were infected with either wild type or ts mutant viruses at an m.o.i. of 15, at 37 or 31 °C, respectively. In the case of the ts mutant virus, after 24 h, the medium was removed and replaced with 40 °C medium containing 100 μg/ml cycloheximide. After a further 24 h, cells were washed and treated with 250 μg/ml lysolecithin, and extracts were prepared. Construction of the G21(TER29)A78 plasmid containing a vaccinia early promoter was described previously (24Deng L. Hagler J. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19556-19562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The prototype G21(TER29)A78 transcription unit consists of a synthetic early promoter fused to a 20-nucleotide G-less cassette, which is flanked by a run of three G residues at positions 21–23. A 57-nucleotide A-less cassette was inserted downstream of the G-less cassette and flanked at its 3′ end by four A residues at positions 78–81. A termination signal, TTTTTTTTT, was placed within the A-less cassette, spanning positions 29–37. The biotinylated 324-base pair DNA template was polymerase chain reaction-amplified employing a 5′ biotin tag on the upstream primer and isolated by preparative agarose gel electrophoresis. The purified DNA fragment was then immobilized to streptavidin-coated magnetic beads (Dynabeads M280; Dynal) as described (25Hagler J. Luo Y. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10050-10060Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The bead-bound (B) template (typically, 100 fmol) was first incubated with 6 μl of C50 or WT virus-infected cell extracts, in the presence of 1 mm ATP, 4 μCi of [α-32P]CTP (800 Ci/mmol), 0.1 mm UTP, and 0.625 mm 3′-OMeGTP to synthesize the G21 transcript. The ternary complex was then isolated, and the nascent transcript was extended through the A-less cassette, in the presence of 1 mm UTP, 1 mm GTP, 4 μCi of [α-32P]CTP, and 1 mm cordycepin triphosphate (3′-dATP) to yield a bead-bound ternary complex containing the A78 transcript. Elongation of the nascent chains beyond the arrest site at G21depended on removal of the blocking 3′-OMeGMP moiety by the hydrolytic activity intrinsic to the vaccinia RNA polymerase elongation complex (26Hagler J. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2166-2173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ternary complexes were collected by centrifugation and resuspended, and transcript release from the paused ternary complex was then assessed (24Deng L. Hagler J. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19556-19562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) in the presence or absence of VTF, WT NPH I, and NPH I COOH-terminal deletion mutations (3′Δ1 and 3′Δ2) or Walker Box B motif-specific mutation of NPH I, M2 (16Christen L.M. Sanders M. Wiler C. Niles E.G. Virology. 1998; 245: 360-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). After incubation for 10 min at 30 °C, the bound transcript was separated from the free by centrifugation and analyzed by gel electrophoresis. The percentage of RNA released was quantified by scanning the autoradiogram with a PhosphorImager. pGEX 4T1-D11L plasmids containing either full-length or truncated D11L (NPH I) coding sequence were described (16Christen L.M. Sanders M. Wiler C. Niles E.G. Virology. 1998; 245: 360-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). pET-30a-D11L-(457–631) was constructed by excising the COOH-terminal coding region from pGEX 4T1-D11L by restriction digestion using EcoRV and SalI restriction enzymes and then inserting it into pET-30a vector digested with the same enzymes. pCITE-4a-H4L plasmid containing full-length H4L was constructed by inserting a NcoI–SalI DNA fragment derived from pET-14a-H4L (obtained from Dr. Stewart Shuman), containing the coding sequence of H4L, into the NcoI–SalI-digested pCITE-4a. A series of H4L truncation mutations in pCITE-4a were constructed by restriction digestion of the original pCITE-4a-H4L construct with AccI, BglII, HincII,SpeI, or MscI–SnaBI restriction enzymes and religation of the digested construct. This gave rise to a series of H4L COOH- and NH2-terminal truncations representing amino acids, 1–195, 1–288, 1–338, 1–577, and 235–795, respectively. pET-30a-H4L-(1–195) was constructed by excising the DNA fragment corresponding to amino acids 1–195 from pCITE-4a-H4L-(1–195) construct, using NcoI and XhoI restriction enzymes, and inserting it into pET-30a. Plasmid pTM3GST is a derivative of pTM-3 (27Elroy-Stein O. Fuerst T.R. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6126-6130Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar), which allows high level of expression of GST-tagged protein. pTM3GST was constructed by insertion of theNcoI–BamHI GST-coding sequence, derived from pTM1GST (obtained from Dr. Michael Merchlinsky), into theNcoI–BamHI-cleaved pTM-3 vector. The plasmid used to obtain recombinant vaccinia virus expressing GST-NPH I (pTM3GST/NPHI) was constructed by inserting aBglII–SalI DNA fragment representing full-length NPH I coding sequence into theBamHI–SalI-cleaved pTM3GST. Large scale induction of GST fusion of wild type as well as truncation mutations of NPH I was carried out at 20 °C as described previously (28Higman M.A. Bourgeois N. Niles E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16430-16437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were collected by centrifugation and stored at −80 °C until used. GST fusions were then purified from an S100 fraction of the induced cells by batchwise affinity to glutathione-Sepharose. In the case of both D11L-(457–631) and H4L-(1–195), the His6-tagged fusions were isolated by batchwise affinity to nickel-agarose. The protein-bound resins were tested by SDS-PAGE, and the volume used was adjusted, whenever required, by dilution with the respective resin to yield equivalent amounts of each protein. Resins were kept as 50% slurry at −20 °C. Novagen Single Tube Protein system 3 was used for the in vitro synthesis of35S-labeled proteins directly from DNA templates containing T7 RNA polymerase promoter. The DNA template (typically 0.5 μg) was transcribed in 10 μl at 30 °C for 15 min followed by the addition of 40 μl of translation mix and continued incubation for 60–90 min. Both pCITE-4a- and pET-30a-derived recombinant plasmids were used. The proteins were labeled in vitro with [35S]methionine by the STP3 in vitro translation system, from Novagen. One μl of the translation mix was incubated with 25 μl of glutathione-Sepharose or nickel-charged His-bind resins coupled to 1 μg of the protein of interest at 4 °C overnight in binding buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol (w/v), 50 mm NaCl). After binding, the resin was washed four times, each with 500 μl of binding buffer. In case of nickel-charged His-bind resins, 50 mm imidazole was included in the buffer during the wash step. The washed resins were then boiled in 1× SDS-loading buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.72 m β-mercaptoethanol) for 5 min and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The gel was then soaked in 1m salicylic acid for 30 min and dried, and autoradiography was then performed at −80 °C. We employed a GST pull-down approach to evaluate possible interactions between NPH I, an early gene transcription termination factor (15Deng L. Shuman S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 538-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 16Christen L.M. Sanders M. Wiler C. Niles E.G. Virology. 1998; 245: 360-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and other components in the transcription termination complex. To this end, glutathione-Sepharose coupled with GST-NPH I was mixed with an 35S-labeled, in vitro synthesized H4L protein. As a negative control, glutathione-Sepharose resin coupled with GST was mixed with an equal amount of 35S-H4L. The interaction between the two subunits of the heterodimeric poly(A) polymerase, J3R and E1L (29Gershon P.D. Ahn B.Y. Garfield M. Moss B. Cell. 1991; 66: 1269-1278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 30Moss B. Rosenblum E.N. Gershowitz A. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4722-4729Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was employed as a positive control to provide a measure of the efficiency of a strong protein/protein interaction in this assay (Fig.1 A, top). Compared with a resin-linked GST, GST-NPH I bound to H4L (Fig. 1 A,bottom), showing an interaction between NPH I and the H4L subunit of virion RNA polymerase. In order to confirm this interaction in virus-infected cells, we constructed recombinant vaccinia virus, vNPHINGST, that expresses GST-tagged NPH I, under the control of T7 RNA polymerase. BSC1 cells were co-infected with 5 m.o.i./cell of recombinant vaccinia virus expressing T7 RNA polymerase, vTF7–3 (23Fuerst T.R. Niles E.G. Studier F.W. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8122-8126Crossref PubMed Scopus (1874) Google Scholar), and vNPHINGST virus. As a negative control, BSC1 cells were also infected with each virus separately. The infected cells were lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer, the lysates were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose and washed, and the resin-bound proteins were then examined for the presence of both NPH I and H4L by Western blot analysis using chemiluminescent substrate (Fig. 1 B). The H4L subunit of virion RNA polymerase was detected in the resin-bound proteins prepared from extracts infected with both viruses but not in the single infection controls. Although this test does not prove a direct interaction between NPH I and H4L, this observation is consistent with the GST pull-down results in Fig. 1 A. In an attempt to map the site of interaction of NPH I on H4L, a battery of NH2- and COOH-terminal truncation mutations of H4L was constructed in pCITE-4a (Fig.2 A). Each of these truncations was synthesized in vitro as 35S-labeled protein. For each of the COOH-terminal deletion mutations, a prominent degradation product co-exists with the full-length product and co-migrates roughly with the NH2-terminal 195-amino acid fragment (Fig. 2 B). This degradation product represents the NH2-terminal region, since it is absent from the NH2-terminal deletion mutation (residues 235–795). Each of the NH2- and COOH-terminal truncation mutations of H4L was mixed with GST-NPH I coupled to glutathione-Sepharose. Compared with a GST-negative control, all of the COOH-terminal deletion mutations of H4L, including the smallest NH2-terminal region of H4L (residues 1–195), bound to GST-NPH I (Fig.2 B). Furthermore, GST-NPH I was unable to pull down the NH2-terminal deletion mutation of H4L (residues 235–795), limiting the site of interaction of NPH I to the NH2-terminal 195 amino acids of H4L. In accordance with this conclusion, the prominent degradation product in each of the H4L COOH-terminal deletions bound to GST-NPH I. Despite the use of roughly equal amounts of radioactivity tested in each case, it is interesting to note that the COOH-terminal deletions of H4L exhibit a stronger binding to GST-NPH I compared with the longer H4L fragments. This may be due, in part, to the greater accessibility or exposure of the NH2-terminal binding site to NPH I in the NH2-terminal fragment. Previous evaluation of NPH I carboxyl-terminal deletion mutations indicated that the carboxyl-terminal end of NPH I may be involved in an interaction with one or more other components of the termination system (16Christen L.M. Sanders M. Wiler C. Niles E.G. Virology. 1998; 245: 360-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Based on the above-mentioned results, we tested whether the COOH-terminal region of NPH I interacts with the NH2-terminal 195 amino acids of H4L. To this end, a nickel-agarose resin coupled with His6-tagged NPH-I-(457–631) was mixed with35S-H4L-(1–195). Compared with a nickel-agarose-negative control, His6-tagged NPH I-(457–631) was capable of pulling down 35S-H4L-(1–195) (Fig.3, top). In a confirmation of this result, a His6-tagged H4L-(1–195) was also shown to bind to 35S-NPH I-(457–631) (Fig. 3, bottom). These results demonstrate that the NH2-terminal 195 amino acids of H4L interact with the COOH-terminal region of NPH I (residues 457–631). The ability of each NPH I COOH-terminal deletion mutation to interact with H4L was assessed directly. Each of these truncation mutants, 3′Δ1, 3′Δ2, and 3′Δ3, representing amino acids 1–603, 1–563, and 1–524, respectively, was expressed as GST fusion, coupled to glutathione-Sepharose resin, and mixed with equal amounts of35S-H4L-(1–288). GST fusion of wild type NPH I was used as a positive control (Fig. 4,lane 3). Compared with a GST-negative control (Fig. 4, lane 2), each of the NPH I COOH-terminal deletions failed to bind to the NH2-terminal region of H4L (Fig. 4, lanes 4–6). This observation shows that deletion of as few as 28 amino acids from the COOH-terminal end of NPH I abolishes its ability to interact with H4L. The ability of NPH I COOH-terminal deletions 3′Δ1 (residues 1–603) and 3′Δ2 (residues 1–563) as well as NPH I's Walker Box B motif specific mutation, M2 (16Christen L.M. Sanders M. Wiler"

Both RNAs form ribonucleoprotein complexes with their cognate polymerases. Here we show that these complexes are not localized in mitochondria, unlike the closely related mitoviruses, which reside in these organelles. Cytoplasmic localization of these polymerases was demonstrated by immunofluorescence and by fluorescence emitted from green fluorescent protein-fused polymerases. These fusion proteins were able to form ribonucleoprotein complexes as did the wild-type polymerases. Fluorescent observations and cell fractionation experiments suggested that the polymerases were stabilized by complex formation with their viral RNA genomes. Immunoprecipitation experiments with anti-green fluorescent protein antibodies demonstrated that a single polymerase molecule binds to a single viral RNA genome in the complex. Moreover, the majority (if not all) of 20 S and 23 S RNA molecules were found to form complexes with their cognate RNA polymerases. Since these viral RNAs were not encapsidated, ribonucleoprotein complex formation with their cognate RNA polymerases appears to be their strategy to survive in the host as persistent viruses.

Cytoplasmic localization of these polymerases was demonstrated by immunofluorescence and by fluorescence emitted from green fluorescent protein-fused polymerases. These fusion proteins were able to form ribonucleoprotein complexes as did the wild-type polymerases. Fluorescent observations and cell fractionation experiments suggested that the polymerases were stabilized by complex formation with their viral RNA genomes. Immunoprecipitation experiments with anti-green fluorescent protein antibodies demonstrated that a single polymerase molecule binds to a single viral RNA genome in the complex. Moreover, the majority (if not all) of 20 S and 23 S RNA molecules were found to form complexes with their cognate RNA polymerases. Since these viral RNAs were not encapsidated, ribonucleoprotein complex formation with their cognate RNA polymerases appears to be their strategy to survive in the host as persistent viruses. green fluorescent protein 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid GAL4 DNA-binding domain RNAs are involved in many fundamental biological processes and also serve as genetic entities. Although some RNAs have catalytic activities by themselves, most of their tasks are accomplished through interactions with proteins. Because of their versatility, RNA-protein interactions not only serve catalytic purposes, but can also affect the fate of the RNAs themselves. For example, the stability of mRNA is governed by complex interactions between cis-elements on the RNA and various proteins (1Caponigro G. Parker R. Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 60: 233-249Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Jacobson A. Peltz S.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 693-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). It is also well known that rRNAs, once assembled into ribosomal subunits, become extremely stable in vivo. (+)-Single-stranded 20 S RNA (ScNV-20 S) and 23 S RNA (ScNV-23 S) viruses belong to the family Narnaviridae (3Wickner R.B. Esteban R. Hillman B.I. Van Regenmortel M.H.V. Fauquet C. Bishop D.H.L.

Then, how can they survive stably without protective coats in the host cell as persistent viruses? This is one of the interesting questions to be answered. 20 S and 23 S RNA viruses have no extracellular transmission pathway and do not render any phenotypic changes in the host. They show 4+:0 segregation in meiosis and can be efficiently transmitted during cytoduction using karyogamy-deficient mutants, thus suggesting their non-nuclear localization. 20 S and 23 S RNAs are induced under nitrogen starvation conditions, and their copy numbers reach up to 100,000 copies/cell. They are stably maintained; and at present, there are no known procedures to eliminate these cryptic viruses from the host cell. The complete nucleotide sequences of 20 S and 23 S RNAs have been determined: 2514 bases for 20 S RNA and 2891 bases for 23 S RNA (4Rodrı́guez-Cousiño N. Solórzano A. Fujimura T. Esteban R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20363-20371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). These RNAs do not encode coat proteins, but do encode their RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, p91 and p104, respectively (see Fig. 1) (5Rodrı́guez-Cousiño N. Esteban L.M. Esteban R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12772-12778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Esteban L.M. Rodrı́guez-Cousiño N. Esteban R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10874-10881Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 20 S and 23 S RNAs are linear molecules (7Rodrı́guez-Cousiño N. Esteban R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2761-2766Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), but they have 5-nucleotide inverted sequences at their 5′- and 3′-ends that can potentially form panhandle structures. There are no poly(A) tails at their 3′-ends (4Rodrı́guez-Cousiño N. Solórzano A. Fujimura T. Esteban R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20363-20371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Yeast strains also contain double-stranded RNAs called W and T (8Wesolowski M. Wickner R.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 181-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The (+)-strands of W and T double-stranded RNAs are identical to 20 S and 23 S RNAs, respectively (4Rodrı́guez-Cousiño N.

Both RNAs instead form ribonucleoprotein complexes with their cognate RNA polymerases (9Esteban L.M. Fujimura T. Garcı́a-Cuéllar M.P. Esteban R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29771-29777Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Garcı́a-Cuéllar M.P. Esteban L.M. Fujimura T. Rodrı́guez-Cousiño N. Esteban R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20084-20089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). p91 and p104 have consensus sequences for RNA-dependent RNA polymerases that are closely related to those of the replicases of RNA coliphages. Recently, several RNAs of viral origin have been isolated from plant pathogenic fungi (11Polashock J.J. Hillman B.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8680-8684Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 12Hong Y. Dover S.L. Cole T.E. Brasier C.M. Buck K.W. Virology. 1999; 258: 118-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). When the mitochondrial genetic code of fungi was applied, these RNAs showed only one open reading frame with consensus sequences for RNA-dependent RNA polymerases. These consensus sequences are most closely related to those of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerases encoded by 20 S and 23 S RNAs. Furthermore, they are reported to reside in mitochondria, thus are called mitoviruses, and belong to the same Narnaviridae family as the yeast single-stranded RNA viruses. In this work, we have determined the subcellular localization of 20 S and 23 S RNA ribonucleoprotein complexes. Unlike mitoviruses, they do not reside in mitochondria, but in the cytoplasm. Immunofluorescence microscopy and cell fractionation experiments suggest that the viral RNA polymerases form aggregates in the absence (or low amounts) of the cognate viral RNAs, but are stabilized by the formation of complexes with them. When the green fluorescent protein (GFP)1 was fused to the C termini of the polymerases, the fusion proteins were active in complex formation with their cognate viral RNAs. These complexes co-sedimented with the authentic, endogenous viral RNA·RNA polymerase complexes in sucrose gradients. When p91-GFP was immunoprecipitated with anti-GFP antibodies, only the fusion protein and the viral RNA (but not the endogenous polymerase) were precipitated, thus suggesting that a single RNA polymerase molecule binds to the viral RNA in the complex. Finally, we found that virtually all of the 20 S and 23 S RNA molecules form complexes with their cognate RNA polymerases. Thus, the yeast single-stranded RNA viruses exist in the host cytoplasm as ribonucleoprotein complexes that contain the viral RNA genome and their cognate RNA polymerases in a 1:1 stoichiometry. The yeast strains used are listed in Table I. Induction of 20 S and 23 S RNAs by nitrogen starvation was done as described elsewhere (5Rodrı́guez-Cousiño N. Esteban L.M. Esteban R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12772-12778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, yeast cells were grown in 1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 0.04% adenine sulfate, and 2% glucose at 30 °C for 2 days and then shifted into 1% potassium acetate (pH 7.0) at 30 °C for 16 h.Table IS. cerevisiae strainsStrainGenotypeRefs.37–4Cαkar1–1 leu1 20 S RNA+, 23 S RNA+8Wesolowski M.

The complete 23 S RNA cDNA fragment (2891 base pairs) was inserted downstream of the PGK1 promoter of pI2 (14Wickner R.B. Icho T. Fujimura T. Widner W.R. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 155-161Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Then the termination codon of p104 was modified by in vitro mutagenesis. A polymerase chain reaction-cloned 0.7-kilobase fragment from pMCB15 containing the GFP gene was then fused in frame to p104 (Fig.1 B). pALI40 was constructed similarly using pI2, but contained an additional 1-kilobaseURA3 DNA fragment inserted into the EcoRV site of the TRP1 gene. The p91-GFP expressed from pALI40 consists of full-length p91 and GFP at the C terminus (Fig.1 B). pALI2 was made by subcloning a fragment of 0.7 kilobases containing the 20 S RNA cDNA sequence from nucleotides 1885 to 2506 into the SalI site of pLM62+, a derivative of the pT7-7 vector (9Esteban L.M.

It was used to synthesize 23 S RNA-specific probes. Antisera against p104 and purified antibodies have been described elsewhere (9Esteban L.M. Fujimura T. Garcı́a-Cuéllar M.P. Esteban R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29771-29777Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Antisera against p91 were raised using p24 overproduced in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells from plasmid pALI2. p24 has the last 205 amino acids from the C terminus of p91 and 11 extra amino acids from a vector at the N terminus. Antibodies against p24 were purified from the sera following the method of Beall and Mitchell (16Beall J.A. Mitchell G.F. J. Immunol. Methods. 1986; 86: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Antibodies against GFP were purchased fromCLONTECH. Localization of p91-GFP and p104-GFP was observed in cells carrying pALI40 or pALI59, respectively. After mounting, images were captured with a Zeiss laser confocal microscope (LSM 510) with a ×63 objective and processed with Adobe PhotoShop software. Localization of p91 or p104 by indirect immunofluorescence was carried out as described (17Bähler J. Pringle J.R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1356-1370Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Cells were first fixed with formaldehyde (3.7%) for 1–2 h, and then spheroplasts were made by treatment with 5 mg/ml zymolyase 100T (ICN Biochemicals) for 30–45 min at 30 °C in 100 mm PIPES, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgSO4, and 1.2m sorbitol (pH 6.9). Anti-p91 and anti-p104 antisera (or their preimmune sera) were used at dilutions of 1:100 for 16 h at 4 °C. Cy3-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Sigma) was used at a 1:300 dilution for 45 min at 25 °C. After mounting, images were captured with the confocal microscope and processed as described above. Immunoprecipitation with specific antibodies was done using protein A-Sepharose CL-4B, and proteins in the immunoprecipitates were then separated on SDS-acrylamide gels and detected by Western blot analysis. The presence of 20 S or 23 S RNAs in the immunoprecipitates was tested directly by dot blot analysis (9Esteban L.M. Fujimura T. Garcı́a-Cuéllar M.P. Esteban R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29771-29777Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Yeast crude cell lysates enriched in 20 S RNA·p91 complexes were prepared as described (18Garcı́a-Cuéllar M.P. Esteban R. Fujimura T. RNA. 1997; 3: 27-36PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, yeast cells grown under nitrogen starvation conditions were broken with glass beads by Vortex mixing at the maximum speed for 15 s 10 times in buffer A (100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation in an Eppendorf centrifuge at the maximum speed at 4 °C for 3 min. The supernatant was centrifuged again at 80,000 rpm (228,000 × g) in a Beckman TLA 100.2 rotor for 1 h at 4 °C. All of the 20 S RNA and p91 were recovered in the precipitate (18Garcı́a-Cuéllar M.P. Esteban R. Fujimura T. RNA. 1997; 3: 27-36PubMed Google Scholar). The precipitate was suspended in the same buffer and used immediately. The lysate was applied directly onto a 1% native agarose gel or preincubated with the anti-p91 or anti-p104 antiserum or their preimmune sera before loading. As a control, the lysate was extracted with phenol, and protein-stripped RNAs were loaded onto the gel. Electrophoresis was done at 4.5 V/cm for 2.5 h at 4 °C in TAE buffer (40 mm Tris acetate and 1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0)) containing 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide. Then RNAs on the gel were blotted onto nitrocellulose or positively charged nylon membranes in TAE buffer at 270 mA for 1 h at 4 °C using an electrotransfer unit from the Mini-Protean II series (Bio-Rad). 20 S RNA on the membranes was detected by Northern hybridization using a 20 S RNA-specific probe and visualized by autoradiography. Due to the instability of 23 S RNA·p104 complexes in buffer A, we substituted it with buffer B (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 30 mm MgCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mmdithiothreitol) to prepare the lysates and analyzed 23 S RNA·p104 complexes as described above. 20 S RNA·p91 complexes in cell lysates, whether prepared in buffer A or B, gave the same results, as shown in Fig. 7 (A and B). Sucrose gradient centrifugation was carried out as described previously (9Esteban L.M. Fujimura T. Garcı́a-Cuéllar M.P. Esteban R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29771-29777Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Northern (19Fujimura T. Esteban R. Esteban L.M. Wickner R.B. Cell. 1990; 62: 819-828Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and Western (9Esteban L.M. Fujimura T. Garcı́a-Cuéllar M.P. Esteban R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29771-29777Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) analyses were done according to the methods described. Yeast mitochondria were prepared according to the standard method (20Daum G. Böhni P.C. Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13028-13033Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fungal mitochondria have been reported as the organelles in which linear DNA or RNA extrachromosomal genetic elements are frequently located (21Griffiths A.J.F. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 673-685Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Hong Y. Cole T.E. Brasier C.M. Buck K.W. Virology. 1998; 246: 158-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 23Lakshman D.K. Jian J. Tavantzis S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6425-6429Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Among them are the mitovirus NB631 naked RNA (CpMV1-NB631) from the chestnut blight fungusCryphonectria parasitica, which is closely related to 20 S and 23 S RNAs (11Polashock J.J. Hillman B.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8680-8684Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), and multiple RNA viruses found in an isolate of the Dutch elm disease fungus Ophiostoma novo-ulmi. (12Hong Y. Dover S.L. Cole T.E. Brasier C.M. Buck K.W. Virology. 1999; 258: 118-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). This prompted us to study the localization of 20 S and 23 S RNAs and their polymerases within the cell. Yeast cells that harbor 20 S and 23 S RNAs were grown under nitrogen starvation conditions to induce high copy numbers of the viral RNAs. Then the cells were gently broken, and the mitochondrial pellet and the post-mitochondrial soluble fraction were prepared according to the standard method of Daum et al. (20Daum G. Böhni P.C. Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13028-13033Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By Northern hybridization, we detected 20 S and 23 S RNAs in the soluble fraction, but not in the mitochondrial pellet (Fig.2 B). Similarly, their RNA polymerases (p91 and p104, respectively) were detected in the soluble fraction by Western blotting (Fig. 2 A). Thus, these data suggest the non-mitochondrial localization of 20 S and 23 S RNAs and their RNA polymerases. However, if the mitochondria had been damaged during the preparation, their contents could have leaked into the soluble fraction. Therefore, we did several control experiments to see if the organelles in the pellet were intact. We used two marker proteins, the mitochondrial outer membrane porin (24Mihara K. Sato R. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 769-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) and the matrix protein hsp60 (25Cheng M.Y. Hartl F.-U. Matin J. Pollock R.A. Kalousek F. Neupert W. Hallberg E.M. Hallberg R.L. Horwich A.L. Nature. 1989; 337: 620-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). Both proteins were found in the pellet fraction, but not in the soluble fraction, indicating that the soluble fraction was not contaminated with mitochondria (Fig. 2 A). Furthermore, the confinement of the soluble matrix protein hsp60 in the pellet indicates the intactness of the organelles. The other control was the 21 S large mitochondrial rRNA. This RNA was found only in the pellet, but not in the soluble fraction (Fig. 2 B). Again, this result indicates the intactness of the mitochondria and shows no contamination of the soluble fraction with mitochondria and their contents. Therefore, these results clearly established that 20 S and 23 S RNAs and their RNA polymerases do not reside in mitochondria. We also examined the nuclear localization of 20 S and 23 S RNAs. When intact nuclei were isolated by a Percoll density gradient (26Icho T. Wickner R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1467-1476Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), 2 μm DNA remained associated with the nuclei, whereas 20 S and 23 S RNAs and their polymerases distributed evenly throughout the gradient (data not shown). Furthermore, we also found that p91 and 20 S RNA were not associated with the endoplasmic reticulum or plasma membranes by sucrose density gradient centrifugation (data not shown). We used Sec36p and Pma1p as protein markers for the endoplasmic reticulum and plasma membranes, respectively (27Trilla J.A. Durán A. Roncero C. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1153-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Therefore, these results indirectly suggest that 20 S and 23 S RNAs and their polymerases localize in the cytoplasm. Since 20 S and 23 S RNAs form ribonucleoprotein complexes in vivowith their cognate RNA polymerases (Refs. 9Esteban L.M. Fujimura T. Garcı́a-Cuéllar M.P. Esteban R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29771-29777Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and 10Garcı́a-Cuéllar M.P. Esteban L.M. Fujimura T. Rodrı́guez-Cousiño N. Esteban R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20084-20089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar; see also Fig. 7) and these polymerases are responsible for the viral replication (18Garcı́a-Cuéllar M.P. Esteban R. Fujimura T. RNA. 1997; 3: 27-36PubMed Google Scholar), we tried to locate p91 and p104 within the cell by immunofluorescent microscopy. Nitrogen-starved cells were fixed with formaldehyde and then converted to spheroplasts. The spheroplasts were treated with the anti-p91 or anti-p104 antiserum. The immunocomplexes were detected with a secondary antibody conjugated with the fluorochrome Cy3 and visualized with a laser confocal microscope. As shown in Fig.3 (A and D), p91 and p104 were present throughout the cytoplasm and were apparently absent from vacuoles. When the preimmune sera were used, only background fluorescence was detected (Fig. 3, C andF). Similarly, 20 S RNA−, 23 S RNA− cells gave only background fluorescence (data not shown). We tried another approach to confirm their cytoplasmic localization. For this purpose, we constructed yeast vectors that can express GFP fused to the C termini of the complete amino acid sequences of p91 and p104. The fusion proteins were expressed in nitrogen-starved cells that harbored endogenous 20 S and 23 S RNA viruses. As shown in Fig.4 A, the fluorescence emitted directly from p91-GFP was observed throughout the cytoplasm, with a distribution very similar to that of p91 detected by indirect immunofluorescence (Fig. 3 A). Although p104-GFP was expressed at a much lower level, it likewise distributed throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 4 E). As a control, GAL4BD-GFP fusion protein was expressed. Since GAL4BD has a nuclear localization signal (28Silver P.A. Keegan L.P. Ptashne M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 5951-5955Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), this fusion protein was confined within the nuclei (Fig.4 I), quite different from the localization of p91-GFP and p104-GFP. The non-nuclear localization of p91 and p104 is consistent with the results of isolation of intact nuclei and also with genetic data: their 4+:0 segregation in meiosis and efficient transmission during cytoduction (6Esteban L.M. Rodrı́guez-Cousiño N. Esteban R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10874-10881Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, these data altogether indicate that p91 and p104 are localized in the cytoplasm. During the course of the fluorescent microscopy experiments, we noticed that p91 and p104 formed clusters in the cytoplasm of log-phase cells (Fig. 3,B and E). If these cells were starved for nitrogen, a condition that induced a high copy number of the viral RNAs (Fig. 3, G–I), the polymerases were more evenly distributed throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 3, A and D). When the p91-GFP fusion protein was observed in log-phase cells, the cluster formation of the fusion protein became more evident, irrespective of the presence or absence of 20 S RNA viruses (Fig. 4, B andD). They appear to be localized near the cell periphery. If these cells were starved for nitrogen, however, the fusion protein spread throughout the cytoplasm in the 20 S RNA-positive strain, while remaining in clusters in the 20 S RNA-negative strain (Fig. 4,A and C). The dispersion of fluorescence in the nitrogen-starved cells was not caused by proteolytic release of GFP fragments from aggregates of the fusion protein since we detected only full-length p91-GFP under these conditions (Figs.5 A and 6 B). We also observed a similar cluster formation/dispersion pattern of p104-GFP in the cytoplasm, and the dispersion was again evident in nitrogen-starved cells with endogenous 23 S RNA virus (Fig. 4 E). Thus, these observations suggest that p91 and p104 form aggregates when the cognate viral RNA is absent or scarce for ribonucleoprotein complex formation. Consistently, when nitrogen-starved cells were broken and centrifuged at a low speed (13,200 rpm in an Eppendorf centrifuge for 5 min), most of p91-GFP was found in the pellet (60%) in 20 S RNA-negative cells, but remained soluble (>80%) in 20 S RNA-positive cells. If these extracts were further subjected to sucrose gradient centrifugation, p91-GFP from 20 S RNA-positive cells co-sedimented with the endogenous 20 S RNA·p91 complex in the gradient (Fig. 5 A), but p91-GFP from 20 S RNA-negative cells ran much faster and was distributed more broadly in the gradient (Fig. 5 B). These results strongly suggest that the viral RNA polymerases form aggregates when the cognate viral RNA is absent or in insufficient amounts to form the ribonucleoprotein complexes.Figure 6Immunoprecipitation of 20 S RNA by anti-GFP antibodies. A, an aliquot of fraction 13 from the gradient shown in Fig. 5 A (prepared from strain TF395/pALI40) that contained p91, p91-GFP, and 20 S RNA was incubated with the anti-p91 antiserum (blot 5), its preimmune serum (blot 4), or anti-GFP antibodies (blot 6). Immunoprecipitates were extracted with phenol and then applied to a nylon membrane. The membrane was hybridized with a 20 S RNA-specific probe. As a negative control (blots 1–3), fraction 13 from a sucrose gradient prepared from strain 37-4C containing only p91 and 20 S RNA was processed similarly: precipitated with the anti-p91 antiserum (blot 2), its preimmune serum (blot 1), or anti-GFP antibodies (blot 3) and hybridized as described above. B, an aliquot of fraction 13 containing p91, p91-GFP, and 20 S RNA was incubated with the anti-p91 antiserum (lane 2), its preimmune serum (lane 1), or anti-GFP antibodies (lane 3). Immunoprecipitates were directly suspended in an SDS loading buffer, separated on an acrylamide gel, and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. p91 and p91-GFP on the membrane were detected by Western analysis with the anti-p91 antiserum.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) As shown above, p91-GFP, when expressed in 20 S RNA-positive cells, comigrated with the endogenous 20 S RNA·p91 complexes in sucrose gradients. Similarly, p104-GFP, although much less expressed, comigrated with the endogenous 23 S RNA·p104 complexes in these gradients (data not shown). In contrast, both fusion proteins expressed in the absence of the endogenous cognate RNAs ran much faster in the gradients (Fig. 5 B and data not shown). These data suggest that p91-GFP and p104-GFP can form complexes with endogenous 20 S and 23 S RNAs, respectively. To prove the formation of a complex between p91-GFP and 20 S RNA, we immunoprecipitated p91-GFP with anti-GFP antibodies and tested whether 20 S RNA is also coprecipitated along with p91-GFP. Since p104-GFP was expressed much less, we focused our attention on the 20 S RNA·p91-GFP complex. The peak fraction of the sucrose gradient (fraction 13 in Fig.5 A) that contained both p91 and p91-GFP was incubated with the anti-p91 antiserum or its preimmune serum. Then the immunoprecipitates were analyzed by dot blot hybridization using a 20 S RNA-specific probe. As shown in Fig.6 A, the anti-p91 antiserum, but not its preimmune serum, precipitated 20 S RNA. We have shown (10Garcı́a-Cuéllar M.P. Esteban L.M. Fujimura T. Rodrı́guez-Cousiño N. Esteban R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20084-20089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) that this hybridization is 20 S RNA-specific since a 23 S RNA-specific probe did not hybridize to the immunoprecipitates produced by the anti-p91 antiserum, and a 20 S RNA-specific probe did not hybridize to those produced by the anti-p104 antiserum. When anti-GFP antibodies were used, 20 S RNA was also precipitated (Fig. 6 A). Moreover, none of these antisera precipitated the p91-GFP mRNA since a specific probe for the GFP RNA failed to detect positive signals in these experiments (data not shown). Therefore, these results suggest the formation of complexes between p91-GFP"
https://openalex.org/W2023473765,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) reverse transcriptase (RT) variants with the K65R or L74V substitution display resistance to several nucleoside analogs. An in vitro dNTP exclusion assay revealed an increased fidelity for K65R RT compared with wild-type RT, but little change for L74V RT. When the forward mutation rates were measured via a gap-filling assay, the K65R variant displayed an 8-fold decrease in the overall mutation rate (1.0 × 10−3 versus 8.6 × 10−3 for wild-type HIV-1 RT), whereas the rate for the L74V variant was closer to that for wild-type RT (5.0 × 10−3). The increase in overall fidelity observed for K65R RT is the largest reported for any drug-resistant HIV-1 RT variant. Nucleotide sequence analysis oflacZα mutants generated by variant RTs indicated that K65R RT displays uniform reduction in most types of errors, whereas L74V RT does not. Modeling the substitutions into the x-ray structure of the ternary complex revealed that the major influence of Leu74 in stabilizing the templating base is unaffected by Val substitution, whereas the K65R substitution appears to increase the stringency of dNTP binding. It is speculated that the increased fidelity of K65R RT is due to an altered interaction with the dNTP substrate."
https://openalex.org/W2050478749,"MyoD heterodimerizes with E type factors (E12/E47 and ITF-2A/ITF-2B) and binds E box sequences within promoters of muscle-specific genes. In transient transfection assays, MyoD activates transcription in the presence of ITF-2A but not ITF-2B, which contains a 182-amino acid N-terminal extension. The first 83 amino acids of the inhibitory N terminus of ITF-2B show high sequence homology to the N terminus of full-length E12/E47. Previous studies that showed activation of MyoD by E12 used an artificially N-terminally truncated form. Here we show that the full-length form of E12 inhibits MyoD function. A conserved alpha-helix motif, capable of interacting with the transcriptional machinery, was not essential for inhibition. Furthermore, the fusion of N-terminal ITF-2B sequences or non-inhibiting ITF-2A sequences to truncated E12 was sufficient in converting the activator into an inhibitor. Overexpression of ITF-2B did not inhibit C2C12 myogenesis or affect levels of endogenous muscle gene expression, consistent with the finding that inhibitory E type proteins are present in muscle. Furthermore, we found that MyoD co-transfected with either ITF-2B or ITF-2A converted fibroblasts into myoblasts with the same frequency. Our findings suggest that the ability of E type proteins to inhibit MyoD activity is dependent on the context of the E box."

Following their conversion to the active triphosphate form by cellular kinases, the analogs incorporate at 3′ ends of newly synthesized DNA strands to either decrease or terminate further chain elongation. Incorporation of either ara-CTP or F-ara-ATP into DNA is a critical event for the cytotoxic effect in the target cell (1Major P.P. Egan E.M. Beardsley G.P. Minden M.D. Kufe D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

In vitro, resistance to ara-C has been linked to reduction either in its transport or its metabolism and to increased dCTP pools, all of which result in decreased incorporation of ara-CTP into DNA (7Wiley J.S.

The underlying mechanism(s) of resistance to F-ara-AMP is not well characterized although sensitivity of cultured leukemia cells is directly related to the extent of incorporation of F-ara-ATP into DNA (12Huang P.

Nuclear DNA polymerases δ and ε possess intrinsic 3′-5′ exonuclease activities to repair mispairs that arise when these polymerases insert an incorrect nucleotide at the 3′ end of the replicating DNA strand. Theoretically, these integral exonucleases could cleave out ara-CMP and F-ara-AMP incorporated into DNA in leukemia cells; however, previous studies have shown that they are generally inefficient at removing therapeutic nucleotide analogs from DNA (12Huang P.

It is conceivable that unassociated 3′-5′ exonucleases remove ara-CMP and F-ara-AMP residues from DNA to counteract the therapeutic effect of these drugs in leukemia cells. Accordingly, clinical samples from leukemia patients were examined for the existence of a putative exonuclease on substrates designed to resemble analog-terminated DNA in treated cells. Using a sequencing-gel exonuclease assay on DNA terminated with either ara-CMP or F-ara-AMP, a 3′-5′ exonuclease (exoN) was purified from nuclear extracts processed from one CLL patient, three AML patients, two AML cell lines, and two healthy individuals. The levels of exoN activity were compared between ara-C-resistant and drug-sensitive AML cells and in normal cells. The physical characteristics determined for exoN as well as its behavior on analog-terminated DNA indicate that it is a previously uncharacterized exonuclease. ara-CTP was purchased from Sigma, and F-ara-ATP was a generous gift from Dr. William Parker (Southern Research Institute, Birmingham, AL). Phage M13mp18 (+) DNA and M13mp19 (+) DNA were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech and Life Technologies, Inc., respectively. The anion-exchanger diethylaminoethyl cellulose (grade DE52) was purchased from Whatman, and S-Sepharose cation-exchange resin was purchased from Sigma. Frozen cells from the two continuous lines AML-2 and AML-5 and from three AML patients were all generously provided by Dr. Mark Minden (Ontario Cancer Institute, Toronto, Ontario, Canada). The cell lines were originally established from peripheral blast cells of an untreated AML patient as described elsewhere (24Koistinen P. Wang C. Yang G.S. Wang Y.-F. Williams D.E. Lyman S.D. Minden M.D. McCulloch E.A. Leukemia. 1991; 5: 704-711PubMed Google Scholar), and AML-5 cells are 9-fold more resistant to ara-C than AML-2 cells (25Hu Z.B. Yang G.S. Li M. Myiamoto N. Minden M.D. McCulloch E.A. Leukemia. 1995; 9: 789-798PubMed Google Scholar). The established and primary AML cells were cultured in α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in 5% CO2 (AML-5 cells were grown in 10% medium conditioned by 5637-CM bladder carcinoma cells). Each cell line has a doubling time of approximately 14 h. Clinical blood samples from a previously untreated patient diagnosed with CLL (20 ml) and from two healthy individuals (50 ml/volunteer) were collected and immediately processed for the isolation of lymphocytes using Ficoll density centrifugation as described previously (26Panasci L. Henderson D. Torres-Garcia S.J. Skalski V. Caplan S. Hutchinson M. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 1972-1976PubMed Google Scholar). The number of viable lymphocytes obtained was 2 × 109 for the patient and 5 × 107 for each healthy volunteer. Exonuclease activity was tested using a sequencing gel assay as detailed elsewhere (27Skalski V. Chang C.-N. Dutschman G. Cheng Y.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23234-23238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 3′-terminated DNA substrates were prepared from an 18-mer with the following sequence: 5′-GTA AAA CGA CGG CCA GTG-3′. This DNA primer is complementary to region 6291–6308 either on M13mp19 (+) phage DNA when terminated with F-ara-AMP or on M13mp18 (+) phage DNA when terminated with ara-CMP. The primer was labeled at the 5′ end with [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity 6000 Ci/mmol), purified on a G25 Sephadex column, and terminated at the 3′ end with the appropriate analog in reactions with 1 unit/ml terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase in 250 mm potassium cacodylate, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.6, 0.25 mg/ml heat-inactivated BSA, and either 1.5 mm cobalt chloride and 25 μmF-ara-ATP or 0.75 mm cobalt chloride and 25 μm ara-CTP. The terminated primers were purified as described previously (22Skalski V. Liu S.-H. Cheng Y.-C. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1995; 50: 815-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and portions of each primer were annealed to a 3-fold molar excess of either M13mp18 (+) or M13mp19 (+) DNA. For normally terminated DNA substrates, a primer with the above sequence was synthesized (Life Technologies, Inc.) with either an additional 3′-dCMP or 3′-dAMP residue in the 19th position. The direction of nucleotide removal by exoN was tested as described elsewhere (22Skalski V. Liu S.-H. Cheng Y.-C. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1995; 50: 815-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Exonuclease assays were done in 10-μl reactions containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mg/ml heat-inactivated BSA, 0.04 nm of the appropriate primer (either single-stranded or annealed to its complementary phage DNA), and 1 μl of the appropriate protein fraction. Incubations varied from 15 to 180 min at 37 °C, and reactions were terminated by adding 4 μl of 98% formamide, 10 mm EDTA, and 0.025% bromphenol blue. Samples were denatured at 100 °C for 5 min, followed by rapid cooling on ice. Electrophoresis was performed on 15% polyacrylamide, 7 murea sequencing gels. The reaction products, detected as bands of radioactivity on sequencing gels, were quantified on a Molecular Dynamics Densitometer, and the exonuclease activity was expressed as percentage of a 3′-terminal nucleotide analog (e.g. ara-CMP or F-ara-AMP) removed from DNA. One unit of exonuclease activity is defined as the amount of enzyme that removes 10% of ara-CMP from the 3′ end of duplex DNA in 10 min at 37 °C. The assays were performed in 15-μl reactions with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 8 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mmEDTA, 0.15 mg/ml heat-inactivated BSA, 0.15 mg/ml activated calf thymus DNA, 50 μm each of dATP, TTP, and dGTP, 1 μm dCTP, 1 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP (specific activity 6000 Ci/mmol), and 2.5 μl of the appropriate protein fraction at 37 °C for 60 min. The reaction mixtures were spotted onto Whatman DE-81 filter discs; the discs were washed three times with 0.3 m NaCl and fixed with 95% ethanol. The incorporated dCMP was measured by liquid scintillation counting, and the DNA polymerase activity expressed in units, where 1 unit is defined as the amount of protein required to incorporate 1 nmol of dCMP into DNA in 60 min at 37 °C. All steps were performed at 4 °C unless otherwise specified. Nuclear protein extracts were prepared from 1–2 × 109 AML-2, AML-5, or CLL cells, 5 × 107 primary normal cells, and 1 × 107primary AML cells. These cells contain approximately 0.1 mg of protein/106 cells (e.g. 0.1 ± 0.2 mg/106 AML-5 cells and 0.09 ± 0.4 mg/106AML-2 cells). Nuclei were isolated as described previously with modifications (28Bogenhagen D. Clayton D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 7991-7995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were rinsed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, cell viability was checked by trypan blue exclusion, and the cell number was determined. The cells were incubated for 10 min in Buffer A (10 mm NaCl, 1.5 mmCaCl2, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), and 1 mm benzamidine hydrochloride (Benz HCl) at a ratio of 5 ml of Buffer A to 1 ml of cell pellet. Approximately 95% of the cells were lysed in a Dounce homogenizer with a loose-fitting pestle as judged by phase contrast microscopy. The nuclei were removed by successive centrifugations for 4 min at 1430 × g. The pellet was washed twice in Buffer A; resuspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm PMSF, and 1 mm Benz HCl (2.5 ml/1 × 109 cells); mixed for 20 min; and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was adjusted to 0.6 m NaCl, 10% glycerol and loaded on a DE52 column equilibrated in Buffer B (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 1 mm each PMSF and Benz HCl) and 0.6 m NaCl. The unbound nuclear protein fraction was dialyzed against Buffer B and loaded on a DE52 column equilibrated in Buffer B. Protein that bound to DE52 was eluted in a linear gradient (0–1 m KCl), and all fractions were assayed for excision of ara-AMP or F-ara-AMP from 3′ ends of terminated DNA. The unbound (flow-through) protein fraction, which contained approximately 95% of total exonuclease activity, was loaded on an S-Sepharose column, and the protein was eluted in a linear gradient (0–1 m KCl). A single peak of exonuclease activity eluted at 0.39 m KCl for each normal, CLL, and AML preparation. However, due to limited availability of primary AML cells, exoN recovered from these cells after the S-Sepharose step was less stable as compared with exoN purified from (larger numbers of) other primary and established cells used in this study. Hence, exoN activity in primary AML cells was examined in the flow-through protein fraction from the preceding chromatography step on DE52. Protein concentration was measured using the Bio-Rad assay. The purity of exoN was assessed by: 1) quantifying excision of ara-CMP or F-ara-AMP from DNA after each purification step by densitometry; 2) 10% SDS-PAGE followed by staining with silver nitrate. Fractionation to nuclei followed by chromatography on DE52 and S-Sepharose typically resulted in 2600-fold purification of exoN from either primary or established cells to a specific activity of approximately 7.7 × 105 units/mg of protein. Gel filtration was performed with 200 μl of AML-5 exoN recovered from chromatography on S-Sepharose. The sample was loaded on a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 pre-packed column and eluted in Buffer B and 0.35 m KCl using the fast protein liquid chromatography system. The column had been calibrated with the following protein standards: ribonuclease A (13.7 kDa), chymotrypsinogen A (25 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), albumin (67 kDa), and aldolase (158 kDa). A standard curve of molecular weightversus the partition coefficient K avwas plotted, where K av was calculated for each protein by Equation 1. Kav=Ve−VoVt−VoEquation 1 Ve is the elution volume for a given protein standard, Vo is the void volume (elution volume for blue dextran 2000), and Vt is the total bed volume (29Stellwagen E. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 318Google Scholar). The K av calculated for exoN was used to extrapolate its molecular weight from the standard curve. In situ protein renaturation of exoN from AML-5 cells was performed according to a previously published procedure with several modifications (30Mummenbrauer T. Janus F. Muller B. Wiesmuller L. Deppert W. Grosse F. Cell. 1996; 85: 1089-1099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Briefly, 100 μl of S-Sepharose fraction 19 was loaded on 10% SDS-PAGE, followed by transfer of the protein to a nitrocellulose membrane using the Bio-Rad Mini-Protean II system. Rainbow protein standards (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were similarly processed to visualize the migration and transfer of proteins of known molecular weight. The transferred exoN preparation was renatured on the nitrocellulose membrane in two changes of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 25% 2-propanol, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol at room temperature for 30 min, followed by incubation in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 25 mm KCl, 0.2 mg/ml heat-inactivated BSA, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 20% glycerol for 18 h at 4 °C. The nitrocellulose area that contained the renatured protein from fraction 19 was cut into 10 1–2-mm strips. Each strip was tested for exonuclease activity in reactions with 0.4 nm 5′ end-radiolabeled and 3′-ara-CMP-terminated 19-mers for 3 h at 37 °C. The reactions (minus the nitrocellulose strips) were loaded on sequencing gels, and reaction products were detected by autoradiography. Nuclear protein prepared from a CLL patient was fractionated on DE52 anion exchange, and the eluted fractions were tested for both exonuclease and DNA polymerase activity. More than 90% of DNA polymerase activity bound to DE52 and eluted at 0.16m KCl (results not shown). In contrast, approximately 95% of exonuclease activity that cleaved F-ara-AMP from 3′ ends of DNA was detected in the unbound protein fraction, which upon fractionation on S-Sepharose yielded one peak of exonuclease activity that eluted at 0.39 m KCl (Fig.1 A). The excision of F-ara-AMP was optimal in reactions with fraction 20, as indicated by comparing the relative ability of the eluted fractions to convert analog-terminated 19-mers to shorter DNA fragments that migrated faster than the unreacted primers on sequencing gels. The appearance of successively shorter 18-mers, 17-mers, etc., is consistent with a non-processive mode of nucleotide excision. Removal of F-ara-AMP from duplex DNA by the exonuclease eluted in fraction 20 was linear during the initial 10 min with 48% of F-ara-AMP excised and slowed down thereafter with 82% of the analog removed after 120 min (Fig.1 B). The newly identified nuclear exonuclease was named exoN. Ion exchange chromatography on DE52 followed by S-Sepharose was performed on nuclear extracts from equivalent numbers of AML-2 and the 9-fold more ara-C-resistant AML-5 cells. As was observed with CLL cells, exoN did not bind to DE52 and subsequent fractionation on S-Sepharose resulted in recovery of one peak of exonuclease activity that eluted at 0.39 m KCl for each cell line (Fig.2 A). A comparison of the amount of ara-CMP-terminated 19-mers converted to shorter DNA products indicated that exoN in fractions 18–23 from AML-5 cells removed more analog than exoN in the corresponding fractions from AML-2 cells. The purity of peak exonuclease fractions was visualized on silver-stained protein gels, and a typical result is shown for exoN purified from the nuclei of AML-5 cells (Fig. 2 B). This preparation is enriched in a 46-kDa protein and contains lower levels of eight additional proteins that range in size from approximately 30 to 130 kDa. Time-course studies of ara-CMP excision from DNA duplexes confirmed that exoN from AML-5 cells removes ara-CMP more efficiently than exoN from AML-2 cells (Fig. 3 A). This result was reproduced three times with separate preparations of AML-5 and AML-2 nuclear protein (Fig. 3 B). Under linear reaction conditions (initial 15 min), exoN from AML-5 cells cleaved approximately 6-fold more ara-CMP as compared with exoN from AML-2 cells. In contrast to exoN activity, similar levels of DNA polymerase activity were recovered from AML-5 and AML-2 cells (36 and 37 units, respectively). Lymphocytes from two healthy individuals were processed concurrently to obtain two S-Sepharose-purified preparations of nuclear exoN. The exonuclease activity was tested on 3′-ara-CMP- and 3′-F-ara-AMP-terminated DNA, and the percentage of analog removed was quantified and plotted as a function of time (Fig. 4, Aand B). A comparison of the initial excision rates revealed that, after 30 min, exoN from volunteer 1 excised approximately 5 times more 3′-ara-CMP and 3 times more 3′-F-ara-AMP as compared with exoN from volunteer 2. At all other time points tested, exoN purified from volunteer 1 removed approximately 2-fold more of each nucleotide analog from DNA as compared with exoN purified from volunteer 2. Finally, nuclear extracts from three AML patients were fractionated on DE52, and the partially purified exoN in the unbound protein fraction was tested for removal of ara-CMP from duplex DNA. After 60 min at 37 °C, exoN from ara-C-resistant AML patients 1 and 2 removed 40% and 46% of ara-CMP, respectively, as compared with 30% of ara-CMP excised by exoN from the third, ara-C-sensitive patient. An aliquot of exoN purified from AML-5 cells was analyzed by gel filtration. A single peak of exonuclease activity was detected in fractions 36–39, and its calculatedK av of 0.443 corresponds to a 45.3-kDa protein on the standard curve (Fig.5 A). In situ protein renaturation studies were performed to determine the oligomerization status of exoN. A portion of S-Sepharose-purified exoN from AML-5 cells was loaded on 10% SDS-PAGE, followed by transfer of the protein to a nitrocellulose membrane. The migration of exoN relative to protein standards of known molecular weight was deduced by cutting the nitrocellulose into 1–2-mm segments and testing each segment for renatured exonuclease activity on sequencing gels. A renatured protein in segment 6 excises ara-CMP from DNA and co-migrates with the 46-kDa protein standard on SDS-PAGE (Fig.5 B). Table I summarizes the properties of exoN. It is a 3′-5′-directed exonuclease that preferentially cleaves nucleotides from single-stranded DNA, and is at least as active on nucleotide analog-terminated DNA as on 3′ ends of DNA that contain naturally occurring nucleotides. exoN activity requires 50 mm KCl and 1 mm magnesium for optimal activity, whereas it is completely inhibited when either zinc or calcium replaces magnesium in the exonuclease reactions. exoN can utilize manganese instead of magnesium; however, its activity is decreased in the presence of the former divalent metal.Table IProperties of exoNMolecular mass (kDa)46Oligomerization statusMonomerMgCl2 (mm) for optimal activity1-aThe activity of exoN (purified from either AML-5 or AML-2 cells) was determined in reactions with the appropriate 5′ end-radiolabeled DNA substrate as outlined under “Experimental Procedures.”1MnCl2(mm) for optimal activity0.1KCl (mm) for optimal activity50Direction of nucleotide removal from DNA1-bThe direction of exoN excision was examined in reactions with 3′ end-radiolabeled DNA as outlined under “Experimental Procedures.”3′–5′Preferential excision of single-stranded DNA1-cRatio of exoN activity on single-stranded versus duplex DNA.1.5Preferential excision of ara-CMP1-dRatio of removal of ara-CMPversus dCMP or F-ara-AMP versus dAMP from 3′ ends of DNA.1Preferential excision of F-ara-AMP1-dRatio of removal of ara-CMPversus dCMP or F-ara-AMP versus dAMP from 3′ ends of DNA.31-a The activity of exoN (purified from either AML-5 or AML-2 cells) was determined in reactions with the appropriate 5′ end-radiolabeled DNA substrate as outlined under “Experimental Procedures.”1-b The direction of exoN excision was examined in reactions with 3′ end-radiolabeled DNA as outlined under “Experimental Procedures.”1-c Ratio of exoN activity on single-stranded versus duplex DNA.1-d Ratio of removal of ara-CMPversus dCMP or F-ara-AMP versus dAMP from 3′ ends of DNA. Open table in a new tab The potency of ara-C and F-ara-AMP is dependent upon their incorporation at the 3′ ends of replicating DNA in tumor cells (1Major P.P. Egan E.M. Beardsley G.P.

Pharmacol. 1995; 36: 181-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). We identified a 3′-5′ exonuclease in human cells, which efficiently removes ara-CMP and F-ara-AMP from synthetic substrates that mimic analog-terminated DNA. exoN was purified from nuclei derived from four leukemia patients and two healthy blood donors, and this suggests that it is a ubiquitous enzyme that may reverse incorporation of therapeutic nucleoside analogs into DNA in leukemia cells. The activity of a DNA polymerase-unassociated 3′-5′ exonuclease might be important in cells treated with F-ara-AMP, as this analog was previously shown to inactivate the 3′-5′ exonuclease subunit of DNA polymerase ε (17Kamiya K. Huang P. Plunkett W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19428-19435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). exoN removes increasing amounts of F-ara-AMP as a function of time, suggesting that it is not inactivated by the excised nucleotide analog (Figs. 1 B and 4 B). Thus, the activity of exoN could be a critical determinant of the potency of F-ara-AMP in CLL cells. The idea that resistance to nucleoside analogs is secondary to exoN activity is supported by our demonstration that exoN purified from resistant AML cells excises more ara-CMP from DNA than exoN purified from drug-sensitive cells. Additionally, exoN activity varies between two healthy volunteers and among three AML patients. These findings provide preliminary evidence for the existence of variations in constitutive exoN activity among individuals and for the induction of this activity by ara-C. These attributes could partially explain bothde novo and acquired resistance to nucleoside analogs among leukemia patients (5Bennett J.M. Young M.L. Andersen J.W. Cassileth P.A. Tallman M.S. Paietta E. Wiernik P.H. Rowe J.M. Cancer. 1997; 80 Suppl. 11: 2205-2209Crossref Google Scholar). Other previously characterized mechanisms of resistance include decreased transport and/or decreased phosphorylation of ara-C to its active metabolite (7Wiley J.S. Jones S.P. Sawyer W.H.

A number of DNA polymerase-unassociated 3′-5′ exonucleases have been described in human cells (18Vazquez-Padua M.A. Starnes M.C. Cheng Y.-C.

Genet. 1998; 20: 114-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar); however, we detect one major activity that removes each ara-CMP and F-ara-AMP from 3′ termini of DNA. Additionally, certain enzymatic and physical properties of exoN, especially its behavior during chromatography, magnesium requirement, molecular weight, and oligomerization status, distinguish it from other 3′-5′ exonucleases, and this suggests that we have identified a previously uncharacterized protein. The up-regulation of exoN activity in resistant AML cells might occur either at the transcriptional or translational level; alternatively, it may result from a mutation in the exoN gene. Although we compared the same amounts of crude AML-5 and AML-2 protein, we recovered more purified exoN protein from the former cells. This suggests that the expression and/or stability of exoN are/is increased in AML-5 cells. A definitive answer to this question awaits identification of the gene that encodes exoN. These studies are presently under way. We thank Drs. H. Klamut and A. M. Rauth for critical review of the manuscript and excellent suggestions. V.

The specificity of the inhibitory effect was demonstrated by the complete lack of effect of the dipeptide Cbz-Gly-Gly-NH2, an inactive analogue of Cbz-Gly-Phe-NH2. The effect was reversible and dose- (IC50 as low as 0.2 mm depending on the cell type) and time-dependent. Adding Cbz-Gly-Phe-NH2 during the lag phase caused a diminution of its inhibitory effect similar to that observed with brefeldin A (BFA). Whereas the dipeptide completely suppressed the CT-induced adenylate cyclase (AC) activity, a direct effect on AC is unlikely since the elevation of intracellular cAMP by forskolin was only slightly reduced. The A1 peptide of CT and NAD+ activated the AC to the same extent in membranes from control and Cbz-Gly-Phe-NH2-treated cells or when Cbz-Gly-Phe-NH2 was added directly to the assay. The inhibitory effects of suboptimal amounts of Cbz-Gly-Phe-NH2and BFA were not additive pointing to a similar mode of action of the two substances. However, Madin-Darby canine kidney cells of which the Golgi structure is BFA-resistant were not resistant to the inhibitory action of Cbz-Gly-Phe-NH2 on CT cytotoxicity. Several lines of evidence indicate that a perturbation of intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis by Cbz-Gly-Phe-NH2 is not responsible for the inhibitory effect of the dipeptide. The dipeptide had also no effect on the binding of 125I-CT to cells and even increased its intracellular internalization. In contrast with BFA, Cbz-Gly-Phe-NH2 did not completely suppress the formation of the catalytically active A1 fragment from bound CT. The data are compatible with a role of metalloendoprotease activity in the intracellular trafficking and processing of CT, although other mechanisms of action of Cbz-Gly-Phe-NH2cannot be excluded.

CT and the Escherichia coliheat-labile enterotoxin (LT), are structurally and immunologically highly homologous, belonging to the same enterotoxin family (1Finkelstein R.A. Hardegree M.C. Tu A.T.

Both are oligomeric proteins of the A-B type. CT is composed of one A or activating subunit (CT-A Mr 27,400), which consists of two distinct polypeptide chains CT-A1(Mr 22,000) and CT-A2(Mr 5,400), linked by a single disulfide bridge and five identical B subunits (Mr 11,600) arranged in a ring-like configuration (CT-B). The subunits are arranged such that CT-A occupies the central channel of the CT-B pentamer extending well above the plane of the pentameric ring (3Sixma T.K. Pronk S.E. Kalk K.H. Wartna E.S.

The CT-A2 peptide goes through the pore in the doughnut-like structure of the CT-B pentamer and protrudes on the side that binds cell surface receptors with its COOH-terminal KDEL sequence exposed. CT elicits a secretory response from intestinal epithelia by binding to the apical cell membrane through interaction between CT-B and the monosialoganglioside GM1 followed by entry of polypeptide A1 into the cell, where it is able to stimulate the basolateral adenylate cyclase by catalyzing the ADP-ribosylation of Arg-201 of the Gsα subunit of the stimulatory GTP-binding regulatory protein (1Finkelstein R.A.

There is a distinct lag period between toxin binding and the activation of adenylate cyclase, during which the toxin must be internalized and processed. At the end of this lag period small amounts of CT-A1 appear in the cells in parallel with activation of the cyclase (5Kassis S. Hagmann J. Fishman P.H. Chang P.P. Moss J. J. Biol.

A role for Golgi-ER retrograde transport in the processing of CT and LT is suggested by the observation that both CT-A and LT-A possess a carboxyl-terminal tetrapeptide sequence (KDEL in CT-A and RDEL in LT-A) that functions as an ER retrieval sequence in eukaryotic cells (17Munro S. Pellham H.R. Cell. 1987; 48: 899-907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1586) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis studies on CT and LT, however, indicated that the ER retrieval signal enhances the efficient delivery of the toxin but is not absolutely required for toxin action (12Lencer W.I.

At present, there are no experimental data to support the mechanism of membrane translocation of the active fragment of CT. It has been suggested that translocation involves the ER-associated protein degradation pathway and that the translocated active A1 fragment escapes ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation because of the complete lack of internal lysine residues (19Hazes B. Read R.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11051-11054Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). To explore further the role of retrograde Golgi-ER transport in CT action and its associated vesicular trafficking events, the effect of benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz)-Gly-Phe-amide, a specific inhibitor of metalloendoproteases, was studied. Recently (20Ivessa N.E. De Lemos-Chiardini C. Gravotta D. Sabatini D.D. Kreibich G. J. Biol.

Vero cells originally obtained from Flow Laboratories were cultured in Medium 199 with Earle's salts supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum. Human intestinal epithelial T84 cells (obtained from ATCC) were propagated in a 1:1 mixture of Ham's F12 medium and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 2.5 mml-glutamine and 5% fetal bovine serum. Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells (obtained from ATCC) were grown in Eagle's minimum essential medium with 2 mml-glutamine and Earle's balanced salt solution adjusted to contain 1.5 g/liter sodium bicarbonate, 0.1 mmnon-essential amino acids, and 1.0 mm sodium pyruvate with 10% fetal bovine serum.

Growth medium was changed twice a week, and cells were passed weekly (at confluency) using a 0.1% trypsin solution (Worthington) in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline without Ca2+ and Mg2+. Vital staining of the Golgi apparatus with C6-NBD-ceramide was done by the method of Ktistakis et al. (24Ktistakis N.T. Roth M.G. Bloom G.S. J.

Wolff D.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1981; 20: 59-67PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, monolayer cultures of Vero cells were washed twice with 10 ml of Earle's balanced salt solution supplemented with 1 mm EGTA and 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5. Another 10 ml of the above salt solution was added, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C until they detached from the plastic surface. The cell suspension was centrifuged at 600 × g for 3 min at room temperature and the supernatant fluid discarded. Cells were resuspended in the above solution and centrifuged. The pellet of the cells was resuspended in 10 ml of the buffered salt solution containing 1 mmMgCl2 and 1 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Monolayer cultures of cells were washed twice with Earle's balanced salt solution without Ca2+ and Mg2+ and treated with 0.05% (w/v) trypsin solution containing 0.02% EDTA. After 1 min the trypsin solution was removed, and 10–15 min later cells were suspended in culture medium. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 750 rpm for 5 min and resuspended in 1 ml of serum-free medium containing 25 mm Hepes, 0.01% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, and 1 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine. 1-ml aliquots of cell suspension (105 cells/ml) were divided over Eppendorf tubes and cooled to 4 °C. Following addition of the indicated amounts of CT, suspensions were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. After washing the cells the temperature was shifted to 37 °C, and cells were further incubated for the indicated times. Afterward, cell suspensions were put on ice, centrifuged for 6 min at 1000 rpm, and resuspended in 0.1 ml of 0.5 m sodium acetate buffer (pH 6.2). The suspensions were boiled for 10 min and then sonicated for 30 s. After centrifugation for 10 min at 10,000 rpm, 20 μl of cell extract was taken for cyclic AMP (cAMP) assay. cAMP was assayed using a cAMP assay kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) based on a competitive protein-binding method. Results for cAMP represent the mean of values from duplicate samples each assayed in triplicate. For the determination of adenylate cyclase, Vero cells (105 cells) were incubated in 1 ml of serum-free medium 199 buffered with 25 mm Hepes at 37 °C with and without 3 mm Cbz-Gly-Phe-NH2for 15 min. The medium was replaced with ice-cold medium containing CT (2 μg/ml), 0.01% BSA, and ±3 mmCbz-Gly-Phe-NH2, and the cells were further incubated at 4 °C for 30 min. The cells were subsequently incubated at 37 °C for different times by replacing the medium with warm Medium 199/Hepes ±3 mm Cbz-Gly-Phe-NH2. The cells were washed with ice-cold Earle's balanced salt solution, lysed by subjecting to a freezing (−80 °C) thawing cycle in 1 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mm EDTA, pH 7.4.

The reaction was stopped by boiling the solution for 2 min. The tubes were cooled in ice, centrifuged (10,000 × g), and triplicate 20-μl samples removed for assay of cyclic AMP.

Chem. 1981; 256: 5481-5488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) from control and Cbz-Gly-Phe-NH2-treated cells were also incubated with 5 μg/ml activated CT (incubated 10 min at 37 °C with 20 mm dithiothreitol), 1 mm NAD+, 100 μm GTP, with and without 3 mmCbz-Gly-Phe-NH2 for 10 min at 30 °C and then assayed for adenylate cyclase activity as described above. Vero cells were grown attached to 35-mm wells of multicluster dishes in Medium 199 with Earle's salts supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum. The cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in serum-free medium buffered with 25 mm Hepes containing 0.01% BSA and CT (0.5 μg/ml) for 30 min at 4 °C. The cells were then washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, incubated in fresh serum-free medium in the presence and absence of dipeptide for the indicated times at 37 °C, and assayed for surface CT according to the procedure described by Fishman (27Fishman P.H. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 860-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) except that anti-choleragenoid antibodies were used. Vero cells were grown to confluency in small (inner diameter = 3 cm) Petri dishes (250 × 106 cells) and maintained in culture for at least 1 week before use. Cells were washed once with serum-free medium buffered with 25 mm Hepes and incubated with and without Cbz-Gly-Phe-NH2, Cbz-Gly-Gly-NH2 (3 mm), or BFA (1 μg/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C. The medium was replaced with ice-cold serum-free medium/Hepes (total volume = 3 ml) containing 125I-CT (106 cpm/ml; ∼ 1 nm CT) and 0.01% BSA, and the cells were further incubated at 4 °C for 30 min. The cells were then washed with ice-cold serum-free medium/Hepes and incubated at 37 °C for different times by replacing the medium with warm serum-free medium/Hepes. With each medium change, Cbz-Gly-Phe-NH2, Cbz-Gly-Gly-NH2, or BFA was added as required. The cell incubations were stopped by adding 1 ml of ice-cold N-ethylmaleimide (1 mm) in phosphate-buffered saline to prevent any further reduction of CT (5Kassis S. Hagmann J. Fishman P.H. Chang P.P. Moss J. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 12148-12152Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), scraped in phosphate-buffered saline, and pelleted by low speed centrifugation. Generation of CT-A1 was determined by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 16% Tris glycine gels. Protein bands corresponding to CT-A1 and CT-A were cut from the gels and analyzed for radioactivity. As shown in Fig.1 prior treatment of Vero cells with BFA (2 μg/ml) strongly suppressed the CT-induced cAMP accumulation which is in agreement with previous studies on other cell types (14Orlandi P.A. Curran P.K. Fishman P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12010-12016Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Nambiar M. Oda T. Chen C. Kuwazuru Y. Wu H.C. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 154: 222-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 16Lencer W.I. de Almeida J.B. Moe S. Stow J.L. Ausiello D.A. Madara J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 2941-2951Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). However, pretreatment of cells with Cbz-Gly-Phe-NH2 only slightly prevented the BFA-induced blockage of CT action, whereas the dipeptide on its own strongly suppressed CT action. Because the role of metalloendoproteases in CT action has not been addressed before, we studied the effect of metalloendoprotease substrates on CT action in somewhat more detail. As illustrated in Fig.2 prior exposure (15 min at 37 °C) of Vero, SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma, and human intestinal epithelial T84 cells to Cbz-Gly-Phe-NH2 completely or almost completely suppressed the CT-induced cAMP accumulation in a dose-dependent way. Depending on the cell type IC50 values varied from 0.2 to 0.5 mm. The extent of inhibition was similar to that observed with BFA, except that with T84 cells BFA only partially inhibited CT action. The specificity of the inhibitor effect was demonstrated by the complete lack of an effect of the dipeptide Cbz-Gly-Gly-NH2, an inactive analogue of Cbz-Gly-Phe-NH2 which is not a substrate for metalloendoproteases (28Pitt A. Schwartz A.L. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 55: 328-335PubMed Google Scholar). As depicted in Fig.3 the inhibitory effect of Cbz-Gly-Phe-NH2 was time-dependent. When Cbz-Gly-Phe-NH2 was added at the same time as CT 80% inhibition was observed, whereas when Vero cells were exposed to 3 mm Cbz-Gly-Phe-NH2 15 min before the addition of CT the activation was virtually abolished. Adding Cbz-Gly-Phe-NH2 during the lag phase caused a diminution of the inhibitory effect. In parallel experiments we also determined the time dependence of the inhibitory effect of BFA on the CT-induced cAMP accumulation in Vero cells. In agreement with a previous study with SK-N-MC cells (14Orlandi P.A. Curran P.K. Fishman P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12010-12016Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the inhibitory effect was time-dependent and adding BFA during the lag phase also reduced its effectiveness as an inhibitor. However, as shown in Fig. 3 there is a marked difference in the time dependence of the inhibitory action of Cbz-Gly-Phe-NH2 and BFA. Adding BFA 15 min after the addition of CT did not reduce but rather increased the response of Vero cells to CT. With the dipeptide a similar phenomenon was only observed when it was added 45 min after the addition of CT. The inhibitory effect of Cbz-Gly-Phe-NH2 on Vero cells was reversible (Fig. 4). Exposure of cells to Cbz-Gly-Phe-NH2 followed by its removal did not affect the extent of CT-induced cAMP accumulation and only slightly altered the time course of CT stimulation (Fig. 4) by causing a small increase in the lag phase. In contrast, no shift in time course was observed following a similar treatment of Vero cells with BFA (2 μg/ml). With SH-SY5Y cells the inhibitory effects of Cbz-Gly-Phe-NH2 (3 mm) and BFA (2 μg/ml) were less reversible. In both cases (Fig. 4) the extent of the CT-induced cAMP accumulation was somewhat reduced and the shift in the time courses was more pronounced. Similar results were obtained when after preincubation of the cells with either Cbz-Gly-Phe-NH2 (3 mm) or BFA (2 μg/ml) for 15 and 30 min, respectively, the cells were cooled to 4 °C, incubated with CT (2 μg/ml) for 30 min at 30 min at 4 °C, washed three times, and finally further incubated at 37 °C for the indicated times. Because of some similarities in the inhibitory action of Cbz-Gly-Phe-NH2 and BFA we explored the effects of the combined addition of suboptimal amounts of these agents on the CT-induced cAMP accumulation in Vero cells. As illustrated in Fig. 5 the inhibitory effects of suboptimal amounts of Cbz-Gly-Phe-NH2 and BFA were not additive, indicating a similar mode of action. However, Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells of which the Golgi structure is BFA-resistant (29Hunziker W. Whitney J.A. Mellman I. Cell. 1991; 61: 617-627Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (193) Google Scholar), and as a consequence are resistant to the inhibitory effect of BFA on CT action, were not resistant to the inhibitory effect of Cbz-Gly-Phe-NH2. With these cells prior exposure to Cbz-Gly-Phe-NH2 (3 mm) also completely suppressed (IC50 = 0.5 mm) CT action (data not shown). To ascertain whether Cbz-Gly-Phe-NH2 had any direct effect on AC activity, we determined the effect of the dipeptide on the forskolin-induced intracellular accumulation of cAMP in Vero cells. As illustrated in Table I, the elevation of intracellular cAMP by forskolin was only slightly suppressed by the dipeptide indicating no direct effect on AC activity.Table IEffect of Cbz-Gly-Phe-NH 2 and Cbz-Gly-Gly-NH 2 on the forskolin-induced cAMP accumulation in Vero cellsTreatmentAccumulation of cAMPpmol/10 5 cellsControl0.2 ± 0.02Forskolin (1 mm)7.84 ± 0.24Cbz-Gly-Phe-NH2 (0.3 mm) + forskolin (1 mm)7.36 ± 0.16Cbz-Gly-Phe-NH2 (3 mm) + forskolin (1 mm)6.85 ± 0.17Cbz-Gly-Gly-NH2 (3 mm) + forskolin (1 mm)7.98 ± 0.14Vero cells were preincubated at 37 °C for 30 min in the absence or the presence of the indicated amounts of Cbz-Gly-Phe-NH2 and Cbz-Gly-Gly-NH2.

Open table in a new tab Vero cells were preincubated at 37 °C for 30 min in the absence or the presence of the indicated amounts of Cbz-Gly-Phe-NH2 and Cbz-Gly-Gly-NH2. Subsequently forskolin (1 mm) was added and the cell suspension incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Values are the means ± S.D. of triplicate assays from one of two similar experiments. CT was able to activate AC in control Vero cells in a time-dependent manner, resulting in a 3-fold increase after 60 min of incubation but had almost no effect on AC activity in cells exposed to Cbz-Gly-Phe-NH2 (data not shown). The A1 peptide, however, was able to activate AC in membranes from Cbz-Gly-Phe-NH2-treated Vero cells (Fig.6). Furthermore, adding Cbz-Gly-Phe-NH2 to the latter assay had only a minor inhibitory effect on the activation of AC by the A1peptide. It has been previously reported (30Brostrom M.A. Wong Ling W.L. Gmitter D. Brostrom C.O. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 499-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) that Cbz-Gly-Phe-NH2 and certain related analogues perturb intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis by the mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ from both high (ER) and low affinity (mitochondria) compartments. To explore this possibility we studied the effect of agents known to be able to mobilize Ca2+ from intracellular stores. We first determined the effect of Cbz-l-Tyr-p-nitrophenyl ester, a more hydrophobic tyrosine analogue possessing three aromatic rings, which has been shown to be 80-fold more potent than Cbz-Gly-Phe-NH2 in inhibiting Ca2+ accumulation by the ER and which is not recognized as a metalloendoprotease inhibitor (30Brostrom M.A. Wong Ling W.L. Gmitter D. Brostrom C.O. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 499-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Addition of Cbz-l-Tyr-p-nitrophenyl ester at concentrations up to 50 μm (at higher concentrations the agent became insoluble) caused only a minor reduction (<15%) of the CT and forskolin (1 mm)-induced cAMP accumulation in Vero cells. We subsequently studied the effect of thapsigargin, a tumor-promoting sesquiterpene lactone, which selectively inhibits the Ca2+-ATPase responsible for Ca2+ accumulation by the ER and causes a loss of Ca2+ from the lumen of this compartment (31Thastrup O. Cullen P.J. Drobak B.K. Hanley M.R. Dawson A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2466-2470Crossref PubMed Scopus (3009) Google Scholar). Since under these conditions the Ca2+-transporting systems especially the Ca2+pumps in the plasma membrane remain functional, it is believed that Ca2+ levels in the ER and cytosol equilibrate at a low level (30Brostrom M.A. Wong Ling W.L. Gmitter D. Brostrom C.O. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 499-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 7 prior treatment of Vero cells with thapsigargin did not reduce but rather increased the CT-induced accumulation of cAMP in a dose-dependent way. At a concentration of 0.5 μm the CT-induced increase in cAMP level was enhanced by 30%. As also illustrated in Fig. 7 pretreatment of Vero cells with thapsigargin (0.5 μm) only partially prevented the BFA-induced blockage of CT action. In a third experiment we studied the inhibitory effect of Cbz-Gly-Phe-NH2 on the CT-induced increase in cAMP level in Ca2+-depleted Vero cells as a function of extracellular Ca2+ concentration. In this experiment Ca2+-depleted Vero cells, prepared by EGTA treatment as described under “Experimental Procedures,” were equilibrated for 30 min in Earle's balanced salt solution containing different concentrations of Ca2+. As shown in Fig.8 EGTA treatment makes the Vero cells somewhat less sensitive to the action of Cbz-Gly-Phe-NH2, but addition of increasing concentrations of extracellular Ca2+ did not affect its inhibitory action.Figure 8.

Cbz-Gly-Phe-NH2 was added at the indicated concentrations, and preparations were incubated for 15 min. CT-induced cAMP accumulation was then determined after an additional 90 min of incubation at 37 °C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Preincuba"
https://openalex.org/W1535235217,"We have investigated the biological role of the cellular counterpart of the leukemogenic AF-9 gene by cloning the rat AF-9 (rAF-9) cDNA and defining the regulation of an anterior pituitary-specific rAF-9 transcript that is expressed in a sexually dimorphic manner. Expression of this transcript is down-regulated after puberty in females and can be subsequently up-regulated in adults by ovariectomy. Hormone replacement studies have provided direct evidence that rAF-9 mRNA expression is suppressed by estrogen. Mapping the 1.9 kb anterior pituitary transcript has shown that it corresponds in size to the rAF-9 cDNA clone, which contains an open reading frame (ORF) that is truncated compared with the human AF-9 ORF, but encodes a previously defined transcriptional activation domain. Thus, the cellular AF-9 gene is alternatively expressed in a manner that reflects the presence of translocated, functionally active (oncogenic) AF-9 sequences in leukemias. Using a novel antisera raised against a rAF-9 peptide, we have also demonstrated tissue- and sex-specific expression of a nuclear 41 kDa anterior pituitary protein and have localized this protein to a major population of growth hormone synthesizing cells. By localizing the expression and defining the physiological regulation of rAF-9, our studies have provided novel insights into the AF-9 gene that will facilitate an understanding of both oncogenic and endocrine roles."
