https://openalex.org/W2089676546,"The interaction between silver nanoparticles and herpesviruses is attracting great interest due to their antiviral activity and possibility to use as microbicides for oral and anogenital herpes. In this work, we demonstrate that tannic acid modified silver nanoparticles sized 13 nm, 33 nm and 46 nm are capable of reducing HSV-2 infectivity both in vitro and in vivo. The antiviral activity of tannic acid modified silver nanoparticles was size-related, required direct interaction and blocked virus attachment, penetration and further spread. All tested tannic acid modified silver nanoparticles reduced both infection and inflammatory reaction in the mouse model of HSV-2 infection when used at infection or for a post-infection treatment. Smaller-sized nanoparticles induced production of cytokines and chemokines important for anti-viral response. The corresponding control buffers with tannic acid showed inferior antiviral effects in vitro and were ineffective in blocking in vivo infection. Our results show that tannic acid modified silver nanoparticles are good candidates for microbicides used in treatment of herpesvirus infections."

Whether proteases that cleave PAR2 at distinct sites are biased agonists that also induce inflammation and pain is unexplored. Cathepsin S (Cat-S) is a lysosomal cysteine protease of antigen-presenting cells that is secreted during inflammation and which retains activity at extracellular pH. We observed that Cat-S cleaved PAR2 at E56↓T57, which removed the canonical tethered ligand and prevented trypsin activation. In HEK and KNRK cell lines and in nociceptive neurons of mouse dorsal root ganglia, Cat-S and a decapeptide mimicking the Cat-S-revealed tethered ligand-stimulated PAR2 coupling to Gαs and formation of cAMP. In contrast to trypsin, Cat-S did not mobilize intracellular Ca2+, activate ERK1/2, recruit β-arrestins, or induce PAR2 endocytosis. Cat-S caused PAR2-dependent activation of transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) in Xenopus laevis oocytes, HEK cells and nociceptive neurons, and stimulated neuronal hyperexcitability by adenylyl cyclase and protein kinase A-dependent mechanisms. Intraplantar injection of Cat-S caused inflammation and hyperalgesia in mice that was attenuated by PAR2 or TRPV4 deletion and adenylyl cyclase inhibition. Cat-S and PAR2 antagonists suppressed formalin-induced inflammation and pain, which implicates endogenous Cat-S and PAR2 in inflammatory pain. Our results identify Cat-S as a biased agonist of PAR2 that causes PAR2- and TRPV4-dependent inflammation and pain. They expand the role of PAR2 as a mediator of protease-driven inflammatory pain.

In the spinal cord, Cat-S induces pain by an indirect mechanism: Cat-S released from microglial cells liberates membrane-tethered fractalkine from neurons, which activates CX3CR1 on microglial cells to trigger inflammatory signals that contribute to central sensitization of pain (1.Clark A.K.

PAR2 is a member of a family of four G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) with a unique mechanism of activation: proteases cleave within the extracellular N-terminal domains of PARs to reveal tethered ligands that bind to and activate the cleaved receptors (11.Ossovskaya V.S. Bunnett N.W. Protease-activated receptors: contribution to physiology and disease.Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 579-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar). Trypsin cleaves human PAR2 at R36↓S37 to expose the tethered ligand 37SLIGKV, and synthetic peptides that mimic this domain can directly activate the receptor (12.Bohm S.K. Kong W. Bromme D.

During injury and inflammation, these proteases can activate PAR2 on nociceptive neurons to stimulate Ca2+-dependent release of neuropeptides that cause neurogenic inflammation (10.Steinhoff M.

Besides proteases that cleave the receptor at the canonical site, certain proteases cleave PAR2 at distinct sites to destroy or remove the tethered ligand domain. These cleavage events disarm the receptor by rendering it unable to respond to activating proteases. For example, elastase cleaves PAR2 at S68↓V69, which removes the tethered ligand and thereby prevents trypsin-stimulated PAR2 signaling (33.Dulon S. Cande C. Bunnett N.W. Hollenberg M.D. Chignard M.

Chem. 2011; 286: 24638-24648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). However, the patho-physiological relevance of this PAR2 disarming mechanism is uncertain. We report that Cat-S, like elastase, cleaves PAR2 distal to the canonical trypsin site. Cleavage exposes a unique tethered ligand domain that induces distinct signaling events that sensitize TRPV4 and cause hyperexcitability of nociceptive neurons, which induce neurogenic inflammation and pain. This mechanism of biased agonism of GPCRs can explain how different endogenous ligands or drugs that interact with the same GPCR can activate divergent signaling pathways with unique outcomes (35.Kenakin T. Christopoulos A. Signalling bias in new drug discovery: detection, quantification and therapeutic impact.Nat. Rev. Drug Disc. 2013; 12: 205-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). Proteases that cleave PARs at different sites may also act as biased agonists. Elastase cleavage of PAR2 at S68↓V69 induces PAR2-dependent activation of extracellular signal regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2) by a Rho-kinase dependent pathway (34.Ramachandran R. Mihara K. Chung H.

Specific length amplified fragment sequencing (SLAF-seq) is a recently developed high-resolution strategy for large scale de novo discovery and genotyping of single nucleotide polymorphisms. SLAF-seq was employed in this study to obtain sufficient markers to construct a high-density genetic map for soybean. In total, 33.10 Gb of data containing 171,001,333 paired-end reads were obtained after preprocessing. The average sequencing depth was 42.29 in the Dongnong594, 56.63 in the Charleston, and 3.92 in each progeny. In total, 164,197 high-quality SLAFs were detected, of which 12,577 SLAFs were polymorphic, and 5,308 of the polymorphic markers met the requirements for use in constructing a genetic map. The final map included 5,308 markers on 20 linkage groups and was 2,655.68 cM in length, with an average distance of 0.5 cM between adjacent markers. To our knowledge, this map has the shortest average distance of adjacent markers for soybean. We report here a high-density genetic map for soybean. The map was constructed using a recombinant inbred line population and the SLAF-seq approach, which allowed the efficient development of a large number of polymorphic markers in a short time. Results of this study will not only provide a platform for gene/quantitative trait loci fine mapping, but will also serve as a reference for molecular breeding of soybean."

However, the mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of shock waves have not yet been fully revealed. Because cell proliferation is a major requirement in the wound healing cascade, we used in vitro studies and an in vivo wound healing model to study whether shock wave treatment influences proliferation by altering major extracellular factors and signaling pathways involved in cell proliferation. We identified extracellular ATP, released in an energy- and pulse number-dependent manner, as a trigger of the biological effects of shock wave treatment. Shock wave treatment induced ATP release, increased Erk1/2 and p38 MAPK activation, and enhanced proliferation in three different cell types (C3H10T1/2 murine mesenchymal progenitor cells, primary human adipose tissue-derived stem cells, and a human Jurkat T cell line) in vitro. Purinergic signaling-induced Erk1/2 activation was found to be essential for this proliferative effect, which was further confirmed by in vivo studies in a rat wound healing model where shock wave treatment induced proliferation and increased wound healing in an Erk1/2-dependent fashion. In summary, this report demonstrates that shock wave treatment triggers release of cellular ATP, which subsequently activates purinergic receptors and finally enhances proliferation in vitro and in vivo via downstream Erk1/2 signaling. In conclusion, our findings shed further light on the molecular mechanisms by which shock wave treatment exerts its beneficial effects.

The material represents a new pterosaur, Caiuajara dobruskii gen. et sp. nov., that is the southermost occurrence of the edentulous clade Tapejaridae (Tapejarinae, Pterodactyloidea) recovered so far. Caiuajara dobruskii differs from all other members of this clade in several cranial features, including the presence of a ventral sagittal bony expansion projected inside the nasoantorbital fenestra, which is formed by the premaxillae; and features of the lower jaw, like a marked rounded depression in the occlusal concavity of the dentary. Ontogenetic variation of Caiuajara dobruskii is mainly reflected in the size and inclination of the premaxillary crest, changing from small and inclined (∼115°) in juveniles to large and steep (∼90°) in adults. No particular ontogenetic features are observed in postcranial elements. The available information suggests that this species was gregarious, living in colonies, and most likely precocial, being able to fly at a very young age, which might have been a general trend for at least derived pterosaurs."
https://openalex.org/W2063452799,"IL-6/Stat3 is associated with the regulation of transcription of key cellular regulatory genes (microRNAs) during different types of liver injury. This study evaluated the role of IL-6/Stat3 in regulating miRNA and miR-21 in alcoholic liver disease. By microarray, we identified that ethanol feeding significantly up-regulated 0.8% of known microRNAs in mouse liver compared with controls, including miR-21. Similarly, the treatment of normal human hepatocytes (N-Heps) and hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) with ethanol and IL-6 significantly increased miR-21 expression. Overexpression of miR-21 decreased ethanol-induced apoptosis in both N-Heps and HSCs. The expression level of miR-21 was significantly increased after Stat3 activation in N-Heps and HSCs, in support of the concept that the 5′-promoter region of miR-21 is regulated by Stat3. Using real time PCR, we confirmed that miR-21 activation is associated with ethanol-linked Stat3 binding of the miR-21 promoter. A combination of bioinformatics, PCR array, dual-luciferase reporter assay, and Western blot analysis revealed that Fas ligand (TNF superfamily, member 6) (FASLG) and death receptor 5 (DR5) are the direct targets of miR-21. Furthermore, inhibition of miR-21 by specific Vivo-Morpholino and knock-out of IL-6 in ethanol-treated mice also increased the expression of DR5 and FASLG in vivo during alcoholic liver injury. The identification of miR-21 as an important regulator of hepatic cell survival, transformation, and remodeling in vitro, as well as its upstream modulators and downstream targets, will provide insight into the involvement of altered miRNA expression in contributing to alcoholic liver disease progression and testing novel therapeutic approaches for human alcoholic liver diseases.

Although several in vitro studies have been carried out to identify modulators of beta-cell mass expansion, restoring endogenous beta-cell mass in vivo has yet to be achieved. To identify potential stimulators of beta-cell replication in vivo, we established transgenic zebrafish lines that monitor and allow the quantification of cell proliferation by using the fluorescent ubiquitylation-based cell cycle indicator (FUCCI) technology. Using these new reagents, we performed an unbiased chemical screen, and identified 20 small molecules that markedly increased beta-cell proliferation in vivo. Importantly, these structurally distinct molecules, which include clinically-approved drugs, modulate three specific signaling pathways: serotonin, retinoic acid and glucocorticoids, showing the high sensitivity and robustness of our screen. Notably, two drug classes, retinoic acid and glucocorticoids, also promoted beta-cell regeneration after beta-cell ablation. Thus, this study establishes a proof of principle for a high-throughput small molecule-screen for beta-cell proliferation in vivo, and identified compounds that stimulate beta-cell proliferation and regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W1968028576,"Ubiquitin specific protease 7 (USP7) is a known deubiquitinating enzyme for tumor suppressor p53 and its downstream regulator, E3 ubiquitin ligase Mdm2. Here we report that USP7 regulates nucleotide excision repair (NER) via deubiquitinating xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group C (XPC) protein, a critical damage recognition factor that binds to helix-distorting DNA lesions and initiates NER. XPC is ubiquitinated during the early stage of NER of UV light-induced DNA lesions. We demonstrate that transiently compromising cellular USP7 by siRNA and chemical inhibition leads to accumulation of ubiquitinated forms of XPC, whereas complete USP7 deficiency leads to rapid ubiquitin-mediated XPC degradation upon UV irradiation. We show that USP7 physically interacts with XPC in vitro and in vivo. Overexpression of wild-type USP7, but not its catalytically inactive or interaction-defective mutants, reduces the ubiquitinated forms of XPC. Importantly, USP7 efficiently deubiquitinates XPC-ubiquitin conjugates in deubiquitination assays in vitro. We further show that valosin-containing protein (VCP)/p97 is involved in UV light-induced XPC degradation in USP7-deficient cells. VCP/p97 is readily recruited to DNA damage sites and colocalizes with XPC. Chemical inhibition of the activity of VCP/p97 ATPase causes an increase in ubiquitinated XPC on DNA-damaged chromatin. Moreover, USP7 deficiency severely impairs the repair of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers and, to a lesser extent, affects the repair of 6-4 photoproducts. Taken together, our findings uncovered an important role of USP7 in regulating NER via deubiquitinating XPC and by preventing its VCP/p97-regulated proteolysis."
https://openalex.org/W2055351105,"Resistance against antimicrobial peptides in many Firmicutes bacteria is mediated by detoxification systems that are composed of a two-component regulatory system (TCS) and an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter. The histidine kinases of these systems depend entirely on the transporter for sensing of antimicrobial peptides, suggesting a novel mode of signal transduction where the transporter constitutes the actual sensor. The aim of this study was to investigate the molecular mechanisms of this unusual signaling pathway in more detail, using the bacitracin resistance system BceRS-BceAB of Bacillus subtilis as an example. To analyze the proposed communication between TCS and the ABC transporter, we characterized their interactions by bacterial two-hybrid analyses and could show that the permease BceB and the histidine kinase BceS interact directly. In vitro pulldown assays confirmed this interaction, which was found to be independent of bacitracin. Because it was unknown whether BceAB-type transporters could detect their substrate peptides directly or instead recognized the peptide-target complex in the cell envelope, we next analyzed substrate binding by the transport permease, BceB. Direct and specific binding of bacitracin by BceB was demonstrated by surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy. Finally, in vitro signal transduction assays indicated that complex formation with the transporter influenced the autophosphorylation activity of the histidine kinase. Taken together, our findings clearly show the existence of a sensory complex composed of TCS and ABC transporters and provide the first functional insights into the mechanisms of stimulus perception, signal transduction, and antimicrobial resistance employed by Bce-like detoxification systems."

One possible example of such a phenomenon could be the recently discovered interaction between host defense proteins known as immunity-related GTPases (IRGs) and a family of rhoptry pseudokinases (ROP5) expressed by the protozoan parasite, Toxoplasma gondii. Mouse IRGs are encoded by an extensive and rapidly evolving family of over 20 genes. Similarly, the ROP5 family is highly polymorphic and consists of 4–10 genes, depending on the strain of Toxoplasma. IRGs are known to be avidly bound and functionally inactivated by ROP5 proteins, but the molecular basis of this interaction/inactivation has not previously been known. Here we show that ROP5 uses a highly polymorphic surface to bind adjacent to the nucleotide-binding domain of an IRG and that this produces a profound allosteric change in the IRG structure. This has two dramatic effects: 1) it prevents oligomerization of the IRG, and 2) it alters the orientation of two threonine residues that are targeted by the Toxoplasma Ser/Thr kinases, ROP17 and ROP18. ROP5s are highly specific in the IRGs that they will bind, and the fact that it is the most highly polymorphic surface of ROP5 that binds the IRG strongly supports the notion that these two protein families are co-evolving in a way predicted by the Red Queen hypothesis.

This appears to be due, at least in part, to the inhibition of IRG oligomerization by ROP5 (9.Fleckenstein M.C. Reese M.L. Könen-Waisman S. Boothroyd J.C. Howard J.C. Steinfeldt T.

Here, we present the crystal structures of two alleles of ROP5 in complex with the murine GTPase IRGa6. The structures reveal not only that ROP5 uses an unusual, polymorphic binding surface to bind IRGa6 but also that ROP5 binding induces an allosteric rearrangement of the IRGa6 active site. This has implications for the competition of Toxoplasma with the IRGs, which are, themselves, polymorphic in the region ROP5 recognizes. Mutant ROP5CI was generated using the Phusion (New England Biolabs) mutagenesis protocol with forward primer (5′-TGTACACCTCTGCCTGACTTCGTG-3′) and either reverse primer G490D (5′-TGAGTCGAATGCCAGACTGTCAGTCCC-3′) or G490F/S491P (5′-TGGGAAGAATGCCAGACTGTCAGTCCCTGG-3′). All recombinant protein was expressed in E. coli Rosetta2(DE3) (EMD Biosciences). ROP5BI and ROP5CI were affinity-purified on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen), and the His6 tag was removed by overnight thrombin (Hematologic Technologies) cleavage at 4 °C. GST-IRGa6 was affinity-purified on glutathione-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) and eluted by on-bead thrombin cleavage overnight at 4 °C. All proteins were further purified by anion exchange and size exclusion chromatography. Crystals of ROP5-IRGa6 grew at a wide range of pH (5 - 9) and PEG molecular weights. ROP5-IRGa6 complex was formed by adding equimolar amounts of individually purified ROP5 and IRGa6 in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm DTT. High quality crystals of ROP5BI-IRGa6 were grown at 18 °C by mixing equal volumes of protein solution (125 µm complex), nucleotide solution (10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ADP, 1 mm GDP, 10 mm DTT), and a reservoir containing 20% PEG 3350, 0.1 m NH4 citrate, pH 7.0. Similarly, high quality crystals of ROP5CI-IRGa6 were grown using a reservoir containing 12% PEG 20,000, 0.1 m MES, pH 6.0. Crystals were flash-frozen in a cryoprotectant of mother liquor with 25% (ROP5BI-IRGa6) or 30% (ROP5CI-IRGa6) ethylene glycol. The diffraction data were collected at beamline 11.1 of the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory at a wavelength of 0.979 Å and a temperature of 100 K. Indexing, integration, and scaling of the diffraction data were performed using the XDS suite (23.Kabsch W. XDS.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (11232) Google Scholar). Because both ROP5BI-IRGa6 and ROP5CI-IRGa6 crystallized in the low symmetry space group P1, data sets from multiple crystals were merged for each complex (see Table 1). Initial phases for the two complexes were obtained by molecular replacement using Phaser (24.McCoy A.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Adams P.D. Winn M.D. Storoni L.C. Read R.J. Phaser crystallographic software.J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2007; 40: 658-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (14444) Google Scholar) with the structures of ROP5BI (3Q60) and IRGa6-GDP (1TPZ) used as initial search models. Probably due to the conformational changes we eventually discovered in the structure, molecular replacement was only successful by first searching for ROP5, followed by IRGa6. Manual rebuilding in Coot (25.Emsley P. Lohkamp B. Scott W.G. Cowtan K. Features and development of Coot.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

Figures were rendered using PyMOL (Schrödinger, LLC, New York).TABLE 2Interface contacts 10–20 µm IRGa6 was incubated at 37 °C with 2 mm GTP (Sigma) in reaction buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm DTT) either with or without the addition of ROP5. All protein was of crystallographic purity. Individual 5-µl reactions were initiated at time points between 0 and 40 min such that all reactions could be halted simultaneously with the addition of 100 µl of BIOMOL Green (Enzo) to measure free inorganic phosphate according to the manufacturer's instructions. A standard curve was measured with each independent experiment. Oligomerization of IRGa6 was measured by an increase in turbidity at A400 and was carried out essentially as described previously (30.Pawlowski N. Khaminets A. Hunn J.P. Papic N. Schmidt A. Uthaiah R.C. Lange R. Vopper G. Martens S. Wolf E. Howard J.C. The activation mechanism of Irga6, an interferon-inducible GTPase contributing to mouse resistance against Toxoplasma gondii.BMC Biol. 2011; 9: 7Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Briefly, oligomerization of 60 µm IRGa6 alone or in the presence of 100 µm wild-type or mutant ROP5CI was initiated by the addition of 5 mm GTP. Assays were conducted at 25 °C in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm DTT. Previous work demonstrated that ROP5 can physically interact with and inhibit the IRG system in vivo (9.Fleckenstein M.C. Reese M.L. Könen-Waisman S. Boothroyd J.C. Howard J.C. Steinfeldt T.

The polymorphic pseudokinase ROP5 controls virulence in Toxoplasma gondii by regulating the active kinase ROP18.PLoS Pathog. 2012; 8: e1002992Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Although the ROP5-IRGa6 interface was partially mapped (9.Fleckenstein M.C. Reese M.L. Könen-Waisman S. Boothroyd J.C. Howard J.C. Steinfeldt T. A Toxoplasma gondii pseudokinase inhibits host IRG resistance proteins.PLoS Biol. 2012; 10: e1001358Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), the analysis was based on limited mutagenesis and low resolution NMR data. To determine the molecular mechanism of ROP5 inhibition of the IRGs at atomic resolution, we solved the crystal structure of murine IRGa6 in complex with the pseudokinase domains of each of two allelic isoforms of ROP5, ROP5BI and ROP5CI, at 1.70 and 1.72 Å resolution, respectively (Fig. 1 and Table 1). The two alleles of ROP5 bind IRGa6 in essentially the same orientations (Fig. 1B). As suggested by previously published NMR data (9.Fleckenstein M.C. Reese M.L. Könen-Waisman S. Boothroyd J.C. Howard J.C. Steinfeldt T. A Toxoplasma gondii pseudokinase inhibits host IRG resistance proteins.PLoS Biol. 2012; 10: e1001358Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), the region of ROP5 that binds IRGa6 is on the opposite face of the pseudokinase domain from the activation loop and substrate recognition site (Fig. 1A). This is consistent with the idea that pseudokinases have evolved away from catalysis to adopt roles such as protein-protein interaction (16.Boudeau J. Miranda-Saavedra D. Barton G.J. Alessi D.R.

Kannan N. Structural and evolutionary adaptation of rhoptry kinases and pseudokinases, a family of coccidian virulence factors.BMC Evol. Biol. 2013; 13: 117Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Instead, the region of ROP5 that binds IRGa6 is the face sometimes recognized by specific kinase regulatory proteins (33.Li S. Depetris R.S. Barford D. Chernoff J. Hubbard S.R. Crystal structure of a complex between protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B and the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase.Structure. 2005; 13: 1643-1651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Specificity at this surface is achieved by discrimination of three-dimensional structure rather than simply primary sequence (as is typical in substrate recognition). For ROP5, the IRG-binding surface includes two structural elements that define the parasite-specific family of kinases to which ROP5 belongs (32.Talevich E. Kannan N. Structural and evolutionary adaptation of rhoptry kinases and pseudokinases, a family of coccidian virulence factors.BMC Evol.

Although IRGa6 adopts slightly different conformations to interact with the two ROP5 isoforms, it retains an identical active site conformation in the two structures (Fig. 1B). The surface of IRGa6 that interacts with ROP5 is a face near but not including the GTPase active site. This surface of IRGa6 does, however, contain a number of highly conserved residues that have been implicated in IRG activation and oligomerization through mutagenesis studies (9.Fleckenstein M.C. Reese M.L. Könen-Waisman S. Boothroyd J.C. Howard J.C. Steinfeldt T.

The activation mechanism of Irga6, an interferon-inducible GTPase contributing to mouse resistance against Toxoplasma gondii.BMC Biol. 2011; 9: 7Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2 and Table 2). Importantly, several of these IRG residues have been previously mutated and shown to disrupt ROP5 binding (Table 2). These data are consistent with the proposed model that ROP5 competitively inhibits IRG oligomerization by sterically occluding its multimerization (9.Fleckenstein M.C. Reese M.L. Könen-Waisman S. Boothroyd J.C. Howard J.C. Steinfeldt T. A Toxoplasma gondii pseudokinase inhibits host IRG resistance proteins.PLoS Biol. 2012; 10: e1001358Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). NMR data previously indicated that ROP5 binding to IRGa6 alters the conformation of the GTPase active site (9.Fleckenstein M.C. Reese M.L. Könen-Waisman S. Boothroyd J.C. Howard J.C. Steinfeldt T. A Toxoplasma gondii pseudokinase inhibits host IRG resistance proteins.PLoS Biol. 2012; 10: e1001358Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), although the extent of these changes was unknown. Consistent with this observation, the IRGa6 switch loop adopts a helical conformation in ROP5-IRGa6-GDP that differs radically from the conformation in the IRGa6-GDP structure (35.Ghosh A. Uthaiah R. Howard J. Herrmann C. Wolf E. Crystal structure of IIGP1: a paradigm for interferon-inducible p47 resistance GTPases.Mol.

https://openalex.org/W2068610338,"Rett (RTT) syndrome is a severe neurological disorder that affects almost exclusively females. Several detectable mutations in the X-linked methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 gene (MECP2) are responsible for the onset of the disease. MeCP2 is a key transcription regulator involved in gene silencing via methylation-dependent remodeling of chromatin. Recent data highlight that lipid metabolism is perturbed in brains and livers of MECP2-null male mice. In addition, altered plasma lipid profile in RTT patients has been observed. Thus, the aim of the work is to investigate the protein network involved in cholesterol homeostasis maintenance on freshly isolated fibroblasts and plasma from both RTT and healthy donors. To this end, protein expression of 3-hydroxy-3methyl glutaryl Coenzyme A reductase (HMGR), sterol regulatory element binding proteins (SREBPs), low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLr) and scavenger receptor B-1 (SRB-1) was assessed in cultured skin fibroblasts from unaffected individuals and RTT patients. In addition, lipid profile and the abundance of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) were analyzed on plasma samples. The obtained results demonstrate that the main proteins belonging to cholesterol regulatory network are altered in RTT female patients, providing the proof of principle that cholesterol metabolism may be taken into account as a new target for the treatment of specific features of RTT pathology."
https://openalex.org/W2028145547,"Aβ42 oligomers play key roles in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease, but their structures remain elusive partly due to their transient nature. Here, we show that Aβ42 in a fusion construct can be trapped in a stable oligomer state, which recapitulates characteristics of prefibrillar Aβ42 oligomers and enables us to establish their detailed structures. Site-directed spin labeling and electron paramagnetic resonance studies provide structural restraints in terms of side chain mobility and intermolecular distances at all 42 residue positions. Using these restraints and other biophysical data, we present a novel atomic-level oligomer model. In our model, each Aβ42 protein forms a single β-sheet with three β-strands in an antiparallel arrangement. Each β-sheet consists of four Aβ42 molecules in a head-to-tail arrangement. Four β-sheets are packed together in a face-to-back fashion. The stacking of identical segments between different β-sheets within an oligomer suggests that prefibrillar oligomers may interconvert with fibrils via strand rotation, wherein β-strands undergo an ∼90° rotation along the strand direction. This work provides insights into rational design of therapeutics targeting the process of interconversion between toxic oligomers and non-toxic fibrils."
https://openalex.org/W2029330544,"Background Subjects born small (SGA) and large (LGA) for gestational age have an increased risk of cardio-metabolic alterations already during prepuberty. Nevertheless, the progression of their cardio-metabolic profile from childhood to adolescence has not been fully explored. Our aim was to assess potential changes in the cardio-metabolic profile from childhood to adolescence in subjects born SGA and LGA compared to those born appropriate (AGA) for gestational age. Methods This longitudinal study included 35 AGA, 24 SGA and 31 LGA subjects evaluated during childhood (mean age (±SD) 8.4±1.4 yr) and then re-assessed during adolescence (mean age 13.3±1.8 yr). BMI, blood pressure, insulin resistance (fasting insulin, HOMA-IR) and lipids were assessed. A cardio-metabolic risk z-score was applied and this consisted in calculating the sum of sex-specific z-scores for BMI, blood pressure, HOMA-IR, triglycerides and triglycerides:high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio. Results Fasting insulin and HOMA-IR were higher in SGA and LGA than AGA subjects both during childhood (all P<0.01) and adolescence (all P<0.01). Similarly, the clustered cardio-metabolic risk score was higher in SGA and LGA than AGA children (both P<0.05), and these differences among groups increased during adolescence (both P<0.05). Of note, a progression of the clustered cardio-metabolic risk score was observed from childhood to adolescence within SGA and within LGA subjects (both P<0.05). Conclusions SGA and LGA subjects showed an adverse cardio-metabolic profile during childhood when compared to AGA peers, with a worsening of this profile during adolescence. These findings indicate an overtime progression of insulin resistance and overall estimated cardiovascular risk from childhood to adolescence in SGA and LGA populations."

Sponsorship and trial results were extracted from manuscripts and classified according to predefined criteria. Main outcome measure was acceptance for publication. Results Of 15,972 manuscripts submitted, 472 (3.0%) were drug RCTs, of which 98 (20.8%) were published. Among submitted drug RCTs, 287 (60.8%) had positive and 185 (39.2%) negative results. Of these, 60 (20.9%) and 38 (20.5%), respectively, were published. Manuscripts on non-industry trials (n = 213) reported positive results in 138 (64.8%) manuscripts, compared to 71 (47.7%) on industry-supported trials (n = 149), and 78 (70.9%) on industry-sponsored trials (n = 110). Twenty-seven (12.7%) non-industry trials were published, compared to 27 (18.1%) industry-supported and 44 (40.0%) industry-sponsored trials. After adjustment for other trial characteristics, manuscripts reporting positive results were not more likely to be published (OR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.61 to 1.66). Submission to specialty journals, sample size, multicentre status, journal impact factor, and corresponding authors from Europe or US were significantly associated with publication. Conclusions For the selected journals, there was no tendency to preferably publish manuscripts on drug RCTs that reported positive results, suggesting that publication bias may occur mainly prior to submission."
https://openalex.org/W2047384628,"The mechanisms of allergic sensitization to milk are still elusive. The major allergen Bos d 5 belongs to the lipocalin-family and thus is able to transport numerous ligands. In this study we investigated its ability to bind to iron-siderophore complexes and tested the immune-modulatory properties of Bos d 5 in either forms. Structural and in silico docking analysis of Bos d 5 revealed that Bos d 5 is able to bind to iron via catechol-based flavonoids (quercetin, myricetin, luteolin) that act as siderophores as confirmed by spectral-analysis and iron staining. Calculated dissociation constants of docking analyses were below 1 µM by virtual addition of iron. When incubated with human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), only the apo-form of Bos d 5 led to an increase of CD4+positive cells and significantly elevated IL13 and IFNγ-levels. In contrast, holo-Bos d 5 decreased numbers of CD4 expressing cells and induced apoptosis. Taken together, our data give evidence that Bos d 5 is capable of binding iron via siderophores. Moreover, our data support for the first time the notion that the form of application (apo- or holo-form) is decisive for the subsequent immune response. The apo-form promotes Th2 cells and inflammation, whereas the holo-form appears to be immunosuppressive."
https://openalex.org/W2059643803,"The evolutionarily conserved target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1) controls growth-related processes such as protein, nucleotide, and lipid metabolism in response to growth hormones, energy/ATP levels, and amino acids. Its deregulation is associated with cancer, type 2 diabetes, and obesity. Among other substrates, mammalian TORC1 directly phosphorylates and inhibits the phosphatidate phosphatase lipin-1, a central enzyme in lipid metabolism that provides diacylglycerol for the synthesis of membrane phospholipids and/or triacylglycerol as neutral lipid reserve. Here, we show that yeast TORC1 inhibits the function of the respective lipin, Pah1, to prevent the accumulation of triacylglycerol. Surprisingly, TORC1 regulates Pah1 in part indirectly by controlling the phosphorylation status of Nem1 within the Pah1-activating, heterodimeric Nem1-Spo7 protein phosphatase module. Our results delineate a hitherto unknown TORC1 effector branch that controls lipin function in yeast, which, given the recent discovery of Nem1-Spo7 orthologous proteins in humans, may be conserved."
https://openalex.org/W2112530308,"We have previously demonstrated that Sinupret, an established treatment prescribed widely in Europe for respiratory ailments including rhinosinusitis, promotes transepithelial chloride (Cl-) secretion in vitro and in vivo. The present study was designed to evaluate other indicators of mucociliary clearance (MCC) including ciliary beat frequency (CBF) and airway surface liquid (ASL) depth, but also investigate the mechanisms that underlie activity of this bioflavonoid.Primary murine nasal septal epithelial (MNSE) [wild type (WT) and transgenic CFTR(-/-)], human sinonasal epithelial (HSNE), WT CFTR-expressing CFBE and TMEM16A-expressing HEK cultures were utilized for the present experiments. CBF and ASL depth measurements were performed. Mechanisms underlying transepithelial Cl- transport were determined using pharmacologic manipulation in Ussing chambers, Fura-2 intracellular calcium [Ca(2+)]i imaging, cAMP signaling, regulatory domain (R-D) phosphorylation of CFTR, and excised inside out and whole cell patch clamp analysis.Sinupret-mediated Cl- secretion [ΔISC(µA/cm(2))] was pronounced in WT MNSE (20.7+/-0.9 vs. 5.6+/-0.9(control), p<0.05), CFTR(-/-) MNSE (10.1+/-1.0 vs. 0.9+/-0.3(control), p<0.05) and HSNE (20.7+/-0.3 vs. 6.4+/-0.9(control), p<0.05). The formulation activated Ca(2+) signaling and TMEM16A channels, but also increased CFTR channel open probability (Po) without stimulating PKA-dependent pathways responsible for phosphorylation of the CFTR R-domain and resultant Cl- secretion. Sinupret also enhanced CBF and ASL depth.Sinupret stimulates CBF, promotes transepithelial Cl- secretion, and increases ASL depth in a manner likely to enhance MCC. Our findings suggest that direct stimulation of CFTR, together with activation of Ca(2+)-dependent TMEM16A secretion account for the majority of anion transport attributable to Sinupret. These studies provide further rationale for using robust Cl- secretagogue based therapies as an emerging treatment modality for common respiratory diseases of MCC including acute and chronic bronchitis and CRS."
https://openalex.org/W1978840765,"Little information is known about factors that influence perioperative and anesthesia-related cardiac arrest (CA) in older patients. This study evaluated the incidence, causes and outcome of intraoperative and anesthesia-related CA in older patients in a Brazilian teaching hospital between 1996 and 2010.During the study, older patients received 18,367 anesthetics. Data collected included patient characteristics, surgical procedures, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status, anesthesia type, medical specialty team and outcome. All CAs were categorized by cause into one of four groups: patient's disease/condition-related, surgery-related, totally anesthesia-related or partially anesthesia-related.All intraoperative CAs and deaths rates are shown per 10,000 anesthetics. There were 100 CAs (54.44; 95% confidence intervals [CI]: 44.68-64.20) and 68 deaths (37.02; 95% CI: 27.56-46.48). The majority of CAs were patient's disease-/condition-related (43.5; 95% CI: 13.44-73.68). There were six anesthesia-related CAs (3.26; 95% CI: 0.65-5.87) - 1 totally and 5 partially anesthesia-related, and three deaths, all partially anesthesia-related (1.63; 95% CI: 0.0-3.47). ASA I-II physical status patients presented no anesthesia-related CA. Anesthesia-related CA, absent in the last five years of the study, was due to medication-/airway-related causes. ASA physical status was the most important predictor of CA (odds ratio: 14.52; 95% CI: 4.48-47.08; P<0.001) followed by emergency surgery (odds ratio: 8.07; 95% CI: 5.14-12.68; P<0.001).The study identified high incidence of intraoperative CAs with high mortality in older patients. The large majority of CAs were caused by factors not anesthesia-related. Anesthesia-related CA and mortality rates were 3.26 and 1.63 per 10,000 anesthetics, with no anesthesia-related CA in the last five years of the study. Major predictors of intraoperative CAs were poorer ASA physical status and emergency surgery. All anesthesia-related CAs were medication-related or airway-related, which is important for prevention strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2064140964,"Squalene, the main hydrocarbon in the unsaponifiable fraction of virgin olive oil, is involved in cholesterol synthesis and it has been reported to own antiatherosclerotic and antiesteatosic effects. However, the squalene's role on lipid plasma parameters and the influence of genotype on this effect need to be addressed.Three male mouse models (wild-type, Apoa1- and Apoe- deficient) were fed chow semisynthetic diets enriched in squalene to provide a dose of 1 g/kg during 11 weeks. After this period, their plasma parameters and lipoprotein profiles were analyzed.Squalene administration at a dose of 1 g/kg showed decreased reactive oxygen species in lipoprotein fractions independently of the animal background and caused an specific increase in high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol levels, accompanied by an increase in phosphatidylcholine and paraoxonase 1 and no changes in apolipoproteins A1 and A4 in wild-type mice. In these mice, the cholesterol increase was due to its esterified form and associated with an increased hepatic expression of Lcat. These effects were not observed in absence of apolipoprotein A1. The increases in HDL- paraoxonase 1 were translated into decreased plasma malondialdehyde levels depending on the presence of Apolipoprotein A1.Dietary squalene promotes changes in HDL- cholesterol and paraoxonase 1 and decreases reactive oxygen species in lipoproteins and plasma malondialdehyde levels, providing new benefits of its intake that might contribute to explain the properties of virgin olive oil, although the phenotype related to apolipoproteins A1 and E may be particularly relevant."
https://openalex.org/W2061853852,"Objective The purpose of this study was to compare the apolipoprotein composition of the three major lipoprotein classes in patients with metabolic syndrome to healthy controls. Methods Very low density (VLDL), intermediate/low density (IDL/LDL, hereafter LDL), and high density lipoproteins (HDL) fractions were isolated from plasma of 56 metabolic syndrome subjects and from 14 age-sex matched healthy volunteers. The apolipoprotein content of fractions was analyzed by one-dimensional (1D) gel electrophoresis with confirmation by a combination of mass spectrometry and biochemical assays. Results Metabolic syndrome patients differed from healthy controls in the following ways: (1) total plasma - apoA1 was lower, whereas apoB, apoC2, apoC3, and apoE were higher; (2) VLDL - apoB, apoC3, and apoE were increased; (3) LDL - apoC3 was increased, (4) HDL -associated constitutive serum amyloid A protein (SAA4) was reduced (p<0.05 vs. controls for all). In patients with metabolic syndrome, the most extensively glycosylated (di-sialylated) isoform of apoC3 was reduced in VLDL, LDL, and HDL fractions by 17%, 30%, and 25%, respectively (p<0.01 vs. controls for all). Similarly, the glycosylated isoform of apoE was reduced in VLDL, LDL, and HDL fractions by 15%, 26%, and 37% (p<0.01 vs. controls for all). Finally, glycosylated isoform of SAA4 in HDL fraction was 42% lower in patients with metabolic syndrome compared with controls (p<0.001). Conclusions Patients with metabolic syndrome displayed several changes in plasma apolipoprotein composition consistent with hypertriglyceridemia and low HDL cholesterol levels. Reduced glycosylation of apoC3, apoE and SAA4 are novel findings, the pathophysiological consequences of which remain to be determined."
https://openalex.org/W1974992512,"Amyloid fibrils form in supersaturated solutions of precursor proteins by a nucleation and growth mechanism characterized by a lag time. Although the lag time provides a clue to understanding the complexity of nucleation events, its long period and low reproducibility have been obstacles for exact analysis. Ultrasonication is known to effectively break supersaturation and force fibrillation. By constructing a Handai amyloid burst inducer, which combines a water bath-type ultrasonicator and a microplate reader, we examined the ultrasonication-forced fibrillation of several proteins, with a focus on the fluctuation in the lag time. Amyloid fibrillation of hen egg white lysozyme was examined at pH 2.0 in the presence of 1.0–5.0 M guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl), in which the dominant species varied from the native to denatured conformations. Although fibrillation occurred at various concentrations of GdnHCl, the lag time varied largely, with a minimum being observed at ∼3.0 m, the concentration at which GdnHCl-dependent denaturation ended. The coefficient of variation of the lag time did not depend significantly on the GdnHCl concentration and was 2-fold larger than that of the ultrasonication-dependent oxidation of iodide, a simple model reaction. These results suggest that the large fluctuation observed in the lag time for amyloid fibrillation originated from a process associated with a common amyloidogenic intermediate, which may have been a relatively compact denatured conformation. We also suggest that the Handai amyloid burst inducer system will be useful for studying the mechanism of crystallization of proteins because proteins form crystals by the same mechanism as amyloid fibrils under supersaturation.

Of the various types of protein aggregates, amyloid fibrils, which are associated with >20 types of amyloidoses, have been the target of recent protein science investigations (1.Sipe J.D.

Amyloid fibrils are fibrillar aggregates with a width of 10 nm and a length of several micrometers. The dominant secondary structure is a cross-β-structure stabilized by an ordered hydrogen bond network. Previous studies proposed that amyloid fibrils may form in supersaturated solutions of precursor proteins by a nucleation and growth mechanism characterized by a lag phase (5.Jarrett J.T.

Widespread aggregation and neurodegenerative diseases are associated with supersaturated proteins.Cell Rep. 2013; 5: 781-790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). One of the most important parameters for characterizing amyloid fibrillation is the lag time, during which no fibrils are detected (6.Wetzel R.

Because the lag time provides a clue to understanding the complexity of nucleation events, numerous experiments have been performed to reveal the relationship between the lag time and various factors determining fibrillation. However, the lag time varies from minutes to months depending on the conditions, and the reproducibility among samples is low in general, making exact analysis difficult. To characterize the kinetics of amyloid fibrillation, including the lag time, a high-throughput analysis using microplates combined with accelerated fibrillation has been suggested (16.Platt G.W.

The ends of fibrils act as the templates of subsequent growth; therefore, ultrasonic treatments effectively maximize the seeding potential of preformed fibrils. The same effects have also been applied to the amplification of infectious prion proteins (26.Saborio G.P. Permanne B. Soto C.

Here, we constructed an instrument, a Handai amyloid burst inducer (HANABI), 4The abbreviations used are: HANABIHandai amyloid burst inducerGdnHClguanidine hydrochlorideAβ(1–40)amyloid-β peptide-(1–40)ThTthioflavin TTEMtransmission electron microscopyAFMatomic force microscopy. with which the ultrasonication-forced fibrillation of proteins can be automatically and rapidly analyzed. Handai amyloid burst inducer guanidine hydrochloride amyloid-β peptide-(1–40) thioflavin T transmission electron microscopy atomic force microscopy. To obtain further insights into the mechanism of amyloid fibrillation, we performed a series of experiments using the HANABI system, with a focus on the fluctuation in the lag time. Most important, using hen egg white lysozyme, we studied the dependence of the lag time on the initial conformational states. Although the lag time varied largely depending on the guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl) concentration, the degree of relative variation (i.e. coefficient of variation) did not depend on the GdnHCl concentration, suggesting that the large fluctuation originates from a process associated with a common amyloidogenic intermediate. We also show that the controlled crystallization of hen egg lysozyme could be monitored by installing a camera in the HANABI system. The results indicate that the HANABI system can be used to clarify the underlying mechanisms responsible for the supersaturation-limited phase transitions of proteins. Lysozyme chloride from hen egg white was purchased from Nacalai Tesque (Kyoto, Japan) and used without further purification. Lyophilized amyloid-β peptide-(1–40) (Aβ(1–40)), which was purchased from Peptide Institute, Inc. (Osaka, Japan), was dissolved in a 0.05% (w/w) ammonia solution at a concentration of 500 µm and stored at −80 °C. Recombinant human insulin (Roche Diagnostics) was purchased from Nacalai Tesque and used without further purification. Recombinant human β2-microglobulin was produced with an Escherichia coli expression system as described previously (32.Chiba T. Hagihara Y. Higurashi T. Hasegawa K. Naiki H. Goto Y. Amyloid fibril formation in the context of full-length protein. Effects of proline mutations on the amyloid fibril formation of β2-microglobulin.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47016-47024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Thioflavin T (ThT) was obtained from Wako Pure Chemical Industries Ltd. (Osaka, Japan). All other reagents were purchased from Nacalai Tesque. The HANABI system, in which a microplate reader was combined with a water bath-type ultrasonicator (see Fig. 1), was used to induce amyloid fibril formation. Lysozyme was typically dissolved in a 3.2 mm HCl solution containing various concentrations of GdnHCl to yield a lysozyme concentration of 5.0 mg/ml. ThT was added to the samples at a final concentration of 5.0 µm. Amyloid fibrillation was assayed by a significant enhancement in ThT fluorescence. The excitation and emission wavelengths were 455 and 485 nm, respectively, and were set with diffraction gratings. Reaction mixtures in 96 wells of a microplate were ultrasonicated from three directions (i.e. two sides and the bottom) for 3 min and then incubated under quiescence for 7 min. This process was repeated during incubation at 37 °C. The volume of the water bath was ∼14 liters. To form lysozyme crystals, lysozyme was dissolved at a concentration of 20 mg/ml in 50 mm sodium acetate (pH 4.8) containing 1.0 m NaCl. The native lysozymes in the wells of the microplate were ultrasonicated for various periods, and crystal formation was directly monitored by a CCD camera installed in the HANABI system at the position of the microplate reader. Fibrils were diluted 10-fold and immediately placed on a 400-mesh carbon-coated copper grid (Nissin EM, Tokyo, Japan) for transmission electron microscopy (TEM) or on a freshly cleaved mica-covered metal plate for atomic force microscopy (AFM). For TEM measurements, adsorbed fibrils on the grid were negatively stained with a 2% (w/v) uranyl acetate solution. Electron micrographs were acquired using a Hitachi H-7650 transmission electron microscope at 80 kV. AFM images were obtained using a Digital Instruments NanoScope IIIa microscope in tapping mode with an Olympus AC160TS-R3 microcantilever. Far-UV CD spectra were measured with a Jasco 710 CD spectrophotometer as described previously (18.Ohhashi Y. Kihara M. Naiki H. Goto Y. Ultrasonication-induced amyloid fibril formation of β2-microglobulin.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 32843-32848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Measurements were performed at 0.1 mg/ml lysozyme and 25 °C using a quartz cuvette with a 1-mm path length, and the results are expressed as mean residue ellipticity (θ). Although we previously used a 96-well microplate for simultaneous assays of ultrasonication-forced fibrillation, the microplate was moved manually after each ultrasonic irradiation from the ultrasonicator to the microplate reader (20.So M. Yagi H. Sakurai K. Ogi H. Naiki H. Goto Y. Ultrasonication-dependent acceleration of amyloid fibril formation.J. Mol. Biol. 2011; 412: 568-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). With the HANABI system, ultrasonic irradiation was performed in a water bath, the plate was then moved to the microplate reader, and ThT fluorescence was monitored; these three processes were repeated automatically under programmed time schedules (Fig. 1). Moreover, the plate was moved in the x-y axes in sequence to ultrasonicate the 96 wells evenly. A typical movement was 5 cm in the x axis, 10 cm in the y axis, −5 cm in the x axis, and −10 cm in the y axis in sequence. We examined the effects of plate movements by monitoring the oxidation of potassium iodide (KI), one of the most conventional ultrasonication-dependent chemical dosimetries used to calibrate ultrasonic power (28.Yamaguchi K. Matsumoto T. Kuwata K. Proper calibration of ultrasonic power enabled the quantitative analysis of the ultrasonication-induced amyloid formation process.Protein Sci. 2012; 21: 38-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 33.Koda S. Kimura T. Kondo T. Mitome H. A standard method to calibrate sonochemical efficiency of an individual reaction system.Ultrason. Sonochem. 2003; 10: 149-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). When ultrasound is irradiated into the KI solution, I− ions are oxidized to give diatomic molecules (I2). When excess I− ions are present in solutions, I2 reacts with excess I− ions to form I3− ions. The amount of I3− ions produced after an adequate duration of sonication, which can be estimated by measuring the absorbance of I3− at 355 nm, is regarded as a relative measure of ultrasonic power. Absorbance was monitored at 355 nm following ultrasonic irradiation every 20 min. Absorbance was measured separately with an SH-9000 microplate reader (Corona Electric Co., Tokyo, Japan). From a linear increase in absorbance, we determined the rate of KI oxidation for each of the 96 wells (Fig. 2A) and represented it schematically on the plate (Fig. 2B). Without plate movements, the rate of KI oxidation was slow in many wells and varied significantly depending on the well. These variations were attributed to fluctuations in the ultrasonic power, even though the three ultrasonic transducers were set to maximize the ultrasonic intensity at the location of the plate. Upon moving the microplate to average the ultrasonic energy, the rate increased, and variations in the KI oxidation rate decreased. Because KI oxidation is a simple reaction that is directly proportional to the ultrasonic energy, we assumed that the observed variations in the KI oxidation rate represented the basic performance of the HANABI system based on intrinsic variations in the simple chemical reaction and mechanical instability arising from uneven ultrasonic irradiation. We repeated ultrasonication-dependent KI oxidation three times in the presence and absence of plate movements. Variations in the oxidation rate were then analyzed in two ways. First, a histogram was plotted for the distribution of this rate in the presence and absence of plate movements (Fig. 2C). The histogram with plate movements showed a Gaussian distribution, whereas that without plate movements had a maximum at the lower rate regions. We obtained the mean ± S.D. and coefficient of variation for the KI oxidation rate in the 96 wells in each of the three experiments in the presence and absence of plate movements (Fig. 2D). Here, the coefficient of variation defined by S.D. divided by the mean indicates a degree of relative variation. The results obtained revealed that plate movements significantly suppressed variations in the rate, giving coefficients of variation in the absence and presence of plate movements of 1.4 and 0.2, respectively (Fig. 2D). The coefficients of variation were constant in the three experiments, suggested that fluctuations between the experiments were minimal. Alternatively, we obtained the mean ± S.D. of the rates for the three experiments in each of the 96 wells, and the S.D. (Fig. 2E) and coefficient of variation (Fig. 2F) were plotted against the average oxidation rate. Plots were made in both the absence and presence of plate movements. The coefficient of variation with plate movements was relatively independent of the rate of KI oxidation, giving a value of 0.2 (Fig. 2F). In both analyses, we obtained a value of 0.2 for the coefficient of variation in the presence of plate movements. Thus, we assumed that the value of 0.2 represented the minimal value achieved for a simple reaction largely determined by mechanical instability associated with uneven ultrasonic irradiation. To assess the performance of the HANABI system, we examined the standard amyloid fibrillation of β2-microglobulin, a protein responsible for dialysis-related amyloidosis (8.Naiki H. Hashimoto S. Suzuki H. Kimura K. Nakakuki K. Gejyo F. Establishment of a kinetic model of dialysis-related amyloid fibril extension in vitro.Amyloid. 1997; 4: 223-232Crossref Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Previous studies established that ultrasonication effectively accelerates the fibrillation of β2-microglobulin (18.Ohhashi Y. Kihara M. Naiki H. Goto Y.

Mol. Biol. 2011; 412: 568-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Solutions of 0.3 mg/ml β2-microglobulin in 100 mm NaCl (pH 2.5) in 96-well plates were irradiated with cycles of 1 min of ultrasonication and 9 min of quiescence. Although the amyloid burst occurred after a lag time in the absence of plate movements, the lag time varied significantly from 1.5 to 10 h depending on the wells (Fig. 3, A and B). In contrast, plate movements led to synchronized fibril formation with a lag time of 1–1.5 h (Fig. 3, D and E). The formation of fibrils was confirmed by TEM (Fig. 3, C and F). These results are consistent with our previous finding showing that the rotation of a microplate is useful for synchronizing the lag time (20.So M. Yagi H. Sakurai K. Ogi H. Naiki H. Goto Y. Ultrasonication-dependent acceleration of amyloid fibril formation.J. Mol. Biol. 2011; 412: 568-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar); however, the achievement was markedly better for the current x-y movement. Here, we noticed that, although the morphologies of fibrils were independent of the plate movements, the fibrils formed with plate movements tended to be contaminated by amorphous aggregates. This was more evident when the decrease in ThT fluorescence after the maximum was marked, suggesting that the extensive ultrasonication caused the transformation of preformed amyloid fibrils to more stable amorphous aggregates accompanied by the decrease in ThT fluorescence (see below). The extent of variation among the 96 wells was analyzed on the basis of a lag time in the presence and absence of plate movements (Fig. 3, G and H)."
https://openalex.org/W1984936432,"Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (ST) is an enteropathogenic Gram-negative bacterium that causes infection following oral ingestion. ST spreads rapidly along the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) and invades the intestinal epithelium to ultimately reach internal body organs. The probiotic yeast Saccharomyces boulardii BIOCODEX (S.b-B) is prescribed for prophylaxis of diarrheal infectious diseases. We previously showed that S.b-B prevents weight loss in ST-infected mice and significantly decreases bacterial translocation to the spleen and liver. This study was designed to investigate the effect of S.b-B on ST migration along the GIT and the impact of the yeast on the host's early innate immune responses. Bioluminescent imaging (BLI) was used to evaluate the effect of S.b-B on the progression of luminescent Salmonella Typhimurium (ST-lux) in the GIT of mice pretreated with streptomycin. Photonic emission (PE) was measured in GIT extracts (stomach, small intestine, cecum and colon) at various time periods post-infection (PI). PE analysis revealed that, 45 min PI, ST-lux had migrated slightly faster in the mice treated with S.b-B than in the untreated infected animals. At 90 min PI, ST-lux had reached the cecum in both groups of mice. Adhesion of ST to S.b-B was visualized in the intestines of the mice and probably accounts for (1) the faster elimination of ST-lux in the feces, and (2) reduced translocation of ST to the spleen and liver. In the early phase of infection, S.b-B also modifies the host's immune responses by (1) increasing IFN-γ gene expression and decreasing IL-10 gene expression in the small intestine, and (2) elevating both IFN-γ, and IL-10 mRNA levels in the cecum. BLI revealed that S.b-B modifies ST migration and the host immune response along the GIT. Study findings shed new light on the protective mechanisms of S.b-B during the early phase of Salmonella pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1994622621,"The molecular differences between ischemic (IF) and non-ischemic (NIF) heart failure are poorly defined. A better understanding of the molecular differences between these two heart failure etiologies may lead to the development of more effective heart failure therapeutics. In this study extensive proteomic and phosphoproteomic profiles of myocardial tissue from patients diagnosed with IF or NIF were assembled and compared. Proteins extracted from left ventricular sections were proteolyzed and phosphopeptides were enriched using titanium dioxide resin. Gel- and label-free nanoscale capillary liquid chromatography coupled to high resolution accuracy mass tandem mass spectrometry allowed for the quantification of 4,436 peptides (corresponding to 450 proteins) and 823 phosphopeptides (corresponding to 400 proteins) from the unenriched and phospho-enriched fractions, respectively. Protein abundance did not distinguish NIF from IF. In contrast, 37 peptides (corresponding to 26 proteins) exhibited a ≥ 2-fold alteration in phosphorylation state (p<0.05) when comparing IF and NIF. The degree of protein phosphorylation at these 37 sites was specifically dependent upon the heart failure etiology examined. Proteins exhibiting phosphorylation alterations were grouped into functional categories: transcriptional activation/RNA processing; cytoskeleton structure/function; molecular chaperones; cell adhesion/signaling; apoptosis; and energetic/metabolism. Phosphoproteomic analysis demonstrated profound post-translational differences in proteins that are involved in multiple cellular processes between different heart failure phenotypes. Understanding the roles these phosphorylation alterations play in the development of NIF and IF has the potential to generate etiology-specific heart failure therapeutics, which could be more effective than current therapeutics in addressing the growing concern of heart failure."
https://openalex.org/W2015375625,"Infants of women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) are more likely to be born large for gestational age with a higher percentage body fat. Elevated maternal lipids may contribute to this. Placental lipases such as lipoprotein lipase (LPL), endothelial lipase (EL) and hormone sensitive lipase (HSL) are involved in transferring lipids from mother to fetus. Previous studies of expression of these lipases in placentae in women with diabetes in pregnancy have reported divergent results. Intracellular lipases such as adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), and HSL are central to lipid droplet metabolism. The activities of these lipases are both influenced by Perilipin 1, and ATGL is also activated by a co-factor comparative gene identification-58 (CGI-58) and inhibited by G0/G1 switch gene 2 (GS02). None of these modifying factors or ATGL have been examined previously in placenta. The purpose of this study was therefore to examine the expression of ATGL, HSL, LPL, EL, as well as Perilipin 1, GS02 and CGI-58 in term pregnancies complicated by GDM. mRNA and protein expression of the lipases were measured in placentae from 17 women with GDM and 17 normoglycaemic pregnancies, matched for maternal BMI and gestational age of delivery. ATGL mRNA expression was increased and HSL mRNA expression reduced in placentae from GDM although there was no differences in protein expression of any of the lipases. All lipases were localised to trophoblasts and endothelial cells. The expression of Perilipin 1 and CGI-58 mRNA was increased and GS02 not altered in GDM. These results suggest that there is no difference in expression in these four lipases between GDM and normoglycaemic placentae, and therefore altered lipid transfer via these lipases does not contribute to large for gestational age in infants of women with GDM."
https://openalex.org/W2027048169,"Nef is an accessory protein of human immunodeficiency viruses that promotes viral replication and progression to AIDS through interference with various host trafficking and signaling pathways. A key function of Nef is the down-regulation of the coreceptor CD4 from the surface of the host cells. Nef-induced CD4 down-regulation involves at least two independent steps as follows: acceleration of CD4 endocytosis by a clathrin/AP-2-dependent pathway and targeting of internalized CD4 to multivesicular bodies (MVBs) for eventual degradation in lysosomes. In a previous work, we found that CD4 targeting to the MVB pathway was independent of CD4 ubiquitination. Here, we report that this targeting depends on a direct interaction of Nef with Alix/AIP1, a protein associated with the endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) machinery that assists with cargo recruitment and intraluminal vesicle formation in MVBs. We show that Nef interacts with both the Bro1 and V domains of Alix. Depletion of Alix or overexpression of the Alix V domain impairs lysosomal degradation of CD4 induced by Nef. In contrast, the V domain overexpression does not prevent cell surface removal of CD4 by Nef or protein targeting to the canonical ubiquitination-dependent MVB pathway. We also show that the Nef-Alix interaction occurs in late endosomes that are enriched in internalized CD4.

This pathway is similar to that followed by signaling receptors, transporters, and other transmembrane proteins that undergo ubiquitination-mediated incorporation into nascent intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) of multivesicular bodies (MVBs) for eventual transport to lysosomes (25.Raiborg C. Stenmark H. The ESCRT machinery in endosomal sorting of ubiquitylated membrane proteins.Nature. 2009; 458: 445-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (1000) Google Scholar).

To determine whether Alix has a role in Nef-induced targeting of CD4 to the MVB pathway, we further investigated the Alix-Nef interaction. We found that Nef binds to both the Bro1 and V domains of Alix. Depletion of Alix or overexpression of a truncated construct comprising the V domain (VD) impairs lysosomal degradation of CD4 induced by Nef, likely by disturbing interaction with endogenous Alix. Moreover, we found that Nef interacts with Alix in late endosomes that contain internalized CD4. These observations indicate that Nef uses Alix as an adaptor for ubiquitination-independent targeting of transmembrane cargo to the MVB pathway.

Research in the last decade has revealed several examples of proteins that can mimic DNA (1.Dryden D.T. Tock M.R. DNA mimicry by proteins.Biochem. Soc.

These DNA mimic proteins prevent DNA-binding proteins from binding to DNA using their DNA-like surfaces. To date only a few DNA mimic proteins have been reported and functionally characterized because the amino acid sequences and protein structures of reported DNA mimic proteins are divergent (1.Dryden D.T. Tock M.R. DNA mimicry by proteins.Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2006; 34: 317-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 4.Wang H.C. Hsu K.C. Yang J.M. Wu M.L. Ko T.P. Lin S.R. Wang A.H.

To extend our knowledge of this novel type of control factor, we searched for new DNA mimic proteins from selected species including bacteriophage, white spot syndrome virus, Neisseria, and Staphylococcus. In the past five years, we have successfully identified four DNA mimic proteins, ICP11, DMP19, DMP12, and SAUGI, using structural and proteomic approaches (4.Wang H.C. Hsu K.C. Yang J.M. Wu M.L.

U.S.A. 2008; 105: 20758-20763Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In the course of discovering these new DNA mimic proteins, gene mining from the whole genome has been the first step to explore the potential targets. To our knowledge the genes encoding small and acidic proteins have a higher chance to be DNA mimics. Another important criterion is the functions of these potential targets. The annotation of these gene products usually specifies “DNA-related” functions such as regulating transcription, inhibiting DNA metabolic enzyme, or binding to DNA binder. To screen the undiscovered functions of these potential DNA mimics, a pulldown assay is one of the proteomic approaches to characterize them. Based on these preliminary studies we found that the bacteriophage T4 protein Arn (Anti-restriction nuclease) is likely to be a DNA mimic. After analyzing the three-dimensional structure and the function of Arn, we believe that Arn could be added to the list of DNA mimics. In previous reports Arn was identified as an auxiliary protein that blocks McrBC restriction nuclease activity and prevents the T4 genome from host R/M (restriction modification) system digestion (8.Dharmalingam K. Revel H.R. Goldberg E.B. Physical mapping and cloning of bacteriophage T4 anti-restriction endonuclease gene.J. Bacteriol. 1982; 149: 694-699Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Kim B.C. Kim K. Park E.H. Lim C.J. Nucleotide sequence and revised map location of the arn gene from bacteriophage T4.Mol. Cells. 1997; 7: 694-696PubMed Google Scholar). Because Arn has the patterns of negatively charged amino acids reminiscent of the DNA mimic proteins Ocr and DinI, Putnam and Tainer (2.Putnam C.D. Tainer J.A. Protein mimicry of DNA and pathway regulation.DNA Repair. 2005; 4: 1410-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) proposed that this protein is a potential DNA mimic. In the present paper we tested this hypothesis by determining the crystal structure of Arn. The structural analysis showed that this dimeric protein has a crescent-like shape that is similar to a bent, double-stranded DNA molecule (dsDNA). Additionally, a dsDNA-like negative charge distribution could be found on the surface of Arn dimer. Arn may, therefore, use these DNA-like properties to control the restriction nuclease activity of McrBC. Interestingly, we found that the bacterial histone-like protein H-NS can interact with Arn in our proteomic studies. We also present evidence that Arn can disrupt H-NS·DNA binding and attenuate H-NS-induced gene silencing. Together, these observations suggest that Arn might serve as an antagonist of the host anti-phage defense systems (e.g. McrBC and H-NS) by its DNA mimic properties. The full-length T4 phage Arn gene (residues 1–92) was synthesized by Genomics (Taipei, Taiwan) and cloned into a pET21b expression vector (Novagen); the resulting plasmid was called pET21b-Arn. The recombinant Arn protein contained a C-terminal His6 tag (100 amino acids) referred to as Arn-His. This protein was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells at 37 °C for 4 h after induction with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside. Soluble Arn-His was purified by immobilized metal-ion chromatography with a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column followed by anion exchange with a Q column and gel filtration using Superdex 200pg (GE Healthcare). The full-length hns gene with a stop codon was obtained by direct PCR from E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells and cloned into a pET21b expression vector (Novagen). The tag-free H-NS was overexpressed in BL21 (DE3) cells at 37 °C after induction with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside for 4 h. The total lysate of H-NS-overexpressing BL21 (DE3) cells was treated with Benzonase (Merck) before centrifugation. Soluble H-NS was purified by a cation exchange SP column and a heparin column (GE Healthcare). The DNA fragment encoding H-NS DNA binding domain (H-NS91–137) was cloned into a pET16b expression vector (Novagen). The recombinant H-NS DNA binding domain contained an N-terminal His10 tag referred to as His-H-NS91. His-H-NS91 was expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells at 30 °C for 4 h after induction with 0.5 mm isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside. Soluble His-H-NS91 was purified by immobilized metal-ion chromatography with a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column followed by anion exchange with a heparin column and gel filtration using Superdex 200pg (GE Healthcare). Purified Arn-His was concentrated in a crystallization buffer (50 mm Tris at pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl) to 20 mg/ml. For crystallization, 2 µl of the Arn-His solution was mixed with 2-µl of a reservoir (3.6 m sodium formate, 0.1 m Tris at pH 8.0) with 1 µl of additive (Bis-Tris 2The abbreviations used are: Bis-Tris2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diolAUCanalytical ultracentrifugation. at pH 5.2). The mixture was then equilibrated with the reservoir by the sitting drop method at 25 °C. The PtII-containing compound terpyridine-PtIICl2 was used in derivatizing the crystals to determine the phase. Both native and single wavelength anomalous diffraction x-ray diffraction data from the Arn-His crystals were collected using beamline BL13B1 at the National Synchrotron Radiation Research Center in Hsinchu, Taiwan and beamline BL12B2 at SPring-8 in Japan. The data were processed using HKL2000 (10.Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

The native and peak datasets in the range of 23–1.90 and 40–1.93 Å resolution were collected at wavelengths of 0.97622 and 1.0716 Å, respectively. Two PtII sites were found in an asymmetric unit. As a result of employing the program DM (12.Cowtan K.D. Main P. Phase combination and cross validation in iterated density-modification calculations.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System. DeLano Scientific LLC, Palo Alto, CA2008Google Scholar). To determine the Arn-interacting proteins from the host, we used the His pulldown method with E. coli BL21 lysate. E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells were cultured overnight, harvested (the pellet was ∼0.6 g from a 100-ml culture), and directly resuspended in 2.4 ml of B-PER bacterial protein extraction reagent (Thermo Scientific) with an EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and Benzonase (Merck). After centrifugation at 4000 × g for 30 min, the soluble protein fraction was mixed with Arn-His and nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid beads; the salt concentration was adjusted to 100 mm NaCl and 40 mm imidazole. After incubation at 4 °C for 16 h, the beads were washed with binding buffer (20 mm Tris at pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, and 40 mm imidazole; 10× bead volume) 3 times. The proteins remaining on the beads were eluted with buffer containing 250 mm imidazole and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Other His pulldown assays were performed by incubating the two purified proteins, Arn-His and H-NS, at room temperature for 10 min under conditions of different pH or ionic strength. The protein bands of interest were manually excised from the SDS-PAGE gel followed by in-gel trypsin digestion. Using LC-MS/MS to resolve protein fragments and combining data with the search program MASCOT (19.Perkins D.N. Pappin D.J. Creasy D.M. Cottrell J.S. Probability-based protein identification by searching sequence databases using mass spectrometry data.Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 3551-3567Crossref PubMed Scopus (6763) Google Scholar), several fragments were matched as significant hits and were regarded as positive identifications. Sedimentation velocity analysis was performed at 60,000 rpm using a 4-hole An-60 Ti rotor at 20 °C in a Beckman Optima XL-I AUC equipped with absorbance optics. Each sample was adjusted to a suitable concentration (280-nm absorption between 0.4 and ∼0.6) in 20 mm Tris at pH 7.5 and 50 mm NaCl. Data were analyzed with the c(M) distribution of the Lamm equation solutions calculated by the program SEDFIT (created at the National Institutes of Health). The SEDFIT parameters were: buffer density, 1.0087 g/ml; buffer viscosity, 0.01013 poise (g/cm/s); protein partial specific volume, 0.73. The oligonucleotides were synthesized by Mission Biotech (Taipei, Taiwan). The short dsDNA was prepared by mixing equal amounts of complementary oligonucleotides, heating to 95 °C for 15 min, and then reducing to 25 °C for annealing. For the competitive binding assay, the chronological order of H-NS·DNA complex formation and Arn protein emergence was taken into consideration for the purpose of imitating the in vivo dynamics. The purified H-NS and dsDNA were first mixed in the reaction buffer (20 mm Tris at pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl) and incubated at 25 °C for 10 min, and then purified recombinant Arn-His was added at 25 °C for another 10 min. All reactions were analyzed on a 0.8% agarose (Yeastern) gel and stained with SYBR Green I (Sigma). The assay was performed in a cell-free expression system using an EasyXpress protein synthesis kit (QIAgen). The plasmid containing inducible gfp as the reporter gene driven by the T7 promoter was previously constructed, and its use in the gene regulation assay was described previously (6.Wang H.C. Ko T.P. Wu M.L. Ku S.C. Wu H.J. Wang A.H. Neisseria conserved protein DMP19 is a DNA mimic protein that prevents DNA binding to a hypothetical nitrogen-response transcription factor.Nucleic Acids Res. 2012; 40: 5718-5730Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). To execute the assay, the plasmid was mixed with (or without) purified H-NS protein at 25 °C for 10 min followed by incubation with different amounts of purified recombinant Arn-His for another 10 min. After the preincubation step, the mixture was combined with the E. coli extract containing the protein synthesis reaction buffer that was provided in the kit, and the reaction was initiated by the addition of 1 mm isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside. During the 1-h induction at 37 °C, the relative amount of GFP expressed was detected at 395-nm excitation and 508-nm emission wavelengths. DNA·H-NS complexes were prepared for EM using the aqueous drop spreading method (20.Thresher R. Griffith J. Electron microscopic visualization of DNA and DNA-protein complexes as adjunct to biochemical studies.Methods Enzymol. 1992; 211: 481-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The DNA·H-NS (DNA 100 ng/µl, H-NS 2 µm) was mixed with 200 µg/ml cytochrome c in 2.5 m ammonium acetate and incubated for 3 min. A 50-µl drop was placed on a clean Parafilm surface, and DNA·H-NS was picked up on a Parlodion-covered grid, dehydrated, and air-dried. Dehydration was carried out in 70% ethanol followed by 90% ethanol. Finally, the grids were blotted on filter paper and imaged using a rotary shadow at an angle of 8° with platinum:palladium (80%:20%) in a high vacuum. The samples were examined in an FEI Tecnai F20 transmission electron microscopy using 200 kV accelerating voltage, and the images were recorded using a Gatan (Pleasanton, CA) slow scan 4k × 4k CCD camera. The preparation and imaging of Arn-His (20 µm) containing DNA·H-NS transmission electron microscopy samples were identical to the methods used for the DNA·H-NS samples. To further understand the biological properties of Arn, the protein was crystallized. Its structure was solved by single wavelength anomalous diffraction. Each asymmetric unit contains an Arn monomer, but the monomer forms a homodimer with a dyad-related partner. Despite a high solvent content of >60%, the structure refines quite well (Table 1, PDB code 3WX4). The Arn monomer folds into a three-stranded, anti-parallel β-sheet, and bundled on the other side are four α-helices (Fig. 1A). Part of the His-tag propagates as an extension of the C-terminal helix. At the N terminus, the β-strand stretches out and associates with its counterpart on the other monomer, forming a long β-ribbon of 14 residues and expanding the β-sheet across the dimer interface. Dimerization of Arn buries 1240 Å2 of the 7090 Å2 surface area of each monomer. The overall structure of Arn revealed a crescent-shaped dimer that resembles T7 Ocr (21.Walkinshaw M.D. Taylor P. Sturrock S.S. Atanasiu C. Berge T. Henderson R.M. Edwardson J.M. Dryden D.T. Structure of Ocr from bacteriophage T7, a protein that mimics B-form DNA.Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 187-194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), another dimeric DNA mimic protein (PDB code 1S7Z; Fig. 1A). Numerous acidic residues located in the helical bundles are found on the concave side of the dimer. The distribution of these negatively charged amino acids is more concentrated on this side in Arn when compared with Ocr (Fig. 1B). On the convex side, the formation of an extended β-sheet across the dimer interface in Arn suggests a much more stable dimer than Ocr, which despite its larger size has a dimer interface of only 500 Å2. As expected for a DNA mimic protein, the acidic residues of Arn are arranged in a symmetric and similar way as the phosphate groups in dsDNA (Fig. 1C). In a preliminary analysis, we performed a His pulldown assay that used His-tagged Arn as bait to search for potential interaction partners whose functions are DNA-related in an E. coli extract. Several distinct proteins were pulled down by the Arn-His-bound resin, as shown in the SDS-PAGE results (Fig. 2). We selected the five most obvious bands (bands 1–5) and analyzed them by LC-MS/MS (Fig. 2 and Table 2). All of the major protein species were identified. However, many of them are metabolic enzymes or bear the function of protein synthesis or trafficking. Interestingly, two potential interaction partners of Arn that bear DNA binding ability were found in band 1 and band 5. Although DNA topoisomerase 1 was found in band 5, this protein usually appears in our other His pulldown assays, and we regard this protein as a nonspecific binding to our His pulldown assay system. In band 1, we found the histone-like nucleoid structuring protein H-NS, which is a major protein species that bears DNA-related function; thus, H-NS is a potential new target of Arn. In addition to H-NS original function, it also serves as a gene silencer against exogenous DNA molecules such as the phage genome, and thus it is a potential target of bacteriophages (22.Ali S.S.

Open table in a new tab To confirm the Arn·H-NS interaction, purified Arn-His and H-NS recombinant proteins were used in another His pulldown assay. Indeed, Arn-His and H-NS interacted with each other in this assay (Fig. 3A). AUC analysis further confirmed the Arn·H-NS interaction (Fig. 3B). The AUC result clearly indicated that the H-NS DNA binding domain, named His-H-NS91, binds to an Arn-His dimer in solution and forms a larger complex. To further understand the interaction between Arn and H-NS, we performed the His pulldown assay under different salt concentrations and pH values. We found that H-NS could be pulled down by Arn-His only in low salt conditions (Fig. 4A). When the NaCl concentration was increased to 200 mm, the interaction between these two proteins was disrupted. Ambient pH is another factor that modulates the formation of the Arn·H-NS complex. We performed a pH-dependent His pulldown assay using pH values ranging from 5.5 to 8.5, and the Arn-His protein level in each eluent was found to be similar (Fig. 4B). The Arn·H-NS complex was most stable at pH 7.5 without interference from the Tris and Hepes buffer systems. When the pH was lowered to 5.5, virtually no Arn·H-NS complexes were formed. Therefore, the stability of the Arn·H-NS complex is strongly influenced by increasing the salt concentration and suggests that ionic bonds play an important role in the interaction between the surfaces of these two proteins. To verify that Arn serves as a DNA-like molecule and competes with the DNA binding site of H-NS, an EMSA was used. Previous studies had shown that several H-NS binding sequences occur in the promoter regions of many E. coli genes, such as the proV, virF, OriC, and fisP promoters and even the hns promoter (25.Bouffartigues E. Buckle M. Badaut C. Travers A. Rimsky S. H-NS cooperative binding to high-affinity sites in a regulatory element results in transcriptional silencing.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 441-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 26.Lang B. Blot N. Bouffartigues E. Buckle M. Geertz M. Gualerzi C.O. Mavathur R. Muskhelishvili G. Pon C.L. Rimsky S. Stella S.

High-affinity DNA binding sites for H-NS provide a molecular basis for selective silencing within proteobacterial genomes.Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 6330-6337Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Here we used a 32-mer DNA fragment, PHns-32, from the hns promoter region (5′-CAATTTTGAATTCCTTACATTCCTGGCTATTG-3′),which contains an H-NS DNA binding consensus sequence (underlined). The EMSA showed a significant band shift of PHns-32 dsDNA after the addition of 10 µm H-NS (Fig. 5A, left four lanes). In addition, H-NS·DNA complex formation could be disrupted by the addition of Arn-His, indicating that this competitive effect was dose-dependent (Fig. 5A, right five lanes). Furthermore, two other small and acidic proteins were used as control proteins: the histone binding DNA mimic protein Icp11 (9.2 kDa, pI 4.20) (7.Wang H.C. Wang H.C. Ko T.P. Lee Y.M. Leu J.H. Ho C.H. Huang W.P. Lo C.F. Wang A.H. White spot syndrome virus protein ICP11: a histone-binding DNA mimic that disrupts nucleosome assembly.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 20758-20763Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and Neisseria NMO-0455 (accession number YP_003082676; 22.2 kDa, pI 4.85). Neither of these proteins affected the H-NS·DNA complex (Fig. 5B). Subsequently we performed another EMSA using the DNA consensus sequence from T4 phage early promoters as the dsDNA substrate to validate the effect of H-NS on T4 phage DNA. The design was based on the strong T4 phage early gene promoter p8.1 (27.Sommer N. Salniene V. Gineikiene E. Nivinskas R. Rüger W. T4 early promoter strength probed in vivo with unribosylated and ADP-ribosylated Escherichia coli RNA polymerase: a mutation analysis.Microbiology. 2000; 146: 2643-2653Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). This 32-mer dsDNA (5′-ACGATAAAAAGTTGTTTACTTCCTCGGTTAGT-3′),called P8.1–32, contains the consensus sequence (underlined) and its flanking regions. The EMSA showed that the H-NS protein binds to the P8.1–32 dsDNA substrate (Fig. 5C, left three lanes), and the H-NS·DNA complex bands become progressively diminished with increasing concentrations of the Arn-His protein (Fig. 5C, right six lanes). These EMSA experiments demonstrated that the Arn protein competes with bacteria and phage DNA fragments for binding to H-NS, supporting the DNA mimic characteristic of the Arn protein. To validate the Arn·H-NS complex, we docked the H-NS DNA binding domain (PDB codes 1HNR) to an Arn (PDB code 3WX4) dimer by ClusPro (28.Comeau S.R. Gatchell D.W. Vajda S. Camacho C.J.

This model suggests that the Arn dimer utilizes its negative charge-dense side to interact with the H-NS DNA binding domain (Fig. 6A). The interface of the model shows that the three-dimensional shape and electrostatic surfaces of these two proteins are complementary to each other (Fig. 6B). H-NS serves as a bacterial defense against foreign DNA by its gene-silencing effect; thus, we performed an in vitro gene regulation assay (6.Wang H.C. Ko T.P. Wu M.L. Ku S.C. Wu H.J. Wang A.H.

https://openalex.org/W2067389559,"Reforestation of riparian zones is increasingly practiced in many regions for purposes of biodiversity conservation, bank stabilisation, and improvement in water quality. This is in spite of the actual benefits of reforestation for recovering underlying soil properties and function remaining poorly understood. Here we compare remnant riparian rainforest, pasture and reforestation plantings aged 2-20 years in an Australian subtropical catchment on ferrosols to determine the extent to which reforestation restores key soil properties. Of the nine soil attributes measured (total nitrogen, nitrate and ammonium concentrations, net nitrification and ammonification rates, organic carbon, bulk density, fine root biomass and water infiltration rates), only infiltration rates were significantly lower in pasture than remnant riparian rainforest. Within reforestation plantings, bulk density decreased up to 1.4-fold and infiltration rates increased up to 60-fold with time post-reforestation. Our results suggest that the main outcome of belowground processes of early reforestation is the recovery of the soils' physical structure, with potential beneficial ecosystem services including reduced runoff, erosion and associated sediment and nutrient loads in waterways. We also demonstrate differential impacts of two commonly planted tree species on a subset of soil properties suggesting that preferential planting of select species could accelerate progress on specific restoration objectives."
https://openalex.org/W2079321540,"Copy number variation (CNV) is a major genetic polymorphism contributing to genetic diversity and human evolution. Clinical application of CNVs for diagnostic purposes largely depends on sufficient population CNV data for accurate interpretation. CNVs from general population in currently available databases help classify CNVs of uncertain clinical significance, and benign CNVs. Earlier studies of CNV distribution in several populations worldwide showed that a significant fraction of CNVs are population specific. In this study, we characterized and analyzed CNVs in 3,017 unrelated Thai individuals genotyped with the Illumina Human610, Illumina HumanOmniexpress, or Illumina HapMap550v3 platform. We employed hidden Markov model and circular binary segmentation methods to identify CNVs, extracted 23,458 CNVs consistently identified by both algorithms, and cataloged these high confident CNVs into our publicly available Thai CNV database. Analysis of CNVs in the Thai population identified a median of eight autosomal CNVs per individual. Most CNVs (96.73%) did not overlap with any known chromosomal imbalance syndromes documented in the DECIPHER database. When compared with CNVs in the 11 HapMap3 populations, CNVs found in the Thai population shared several characteristics with CNVs characterized in HapMap3. Common CNVs in Thais had similar frequencies to those in the HapMap3 populations, and all high frequency CNVs (>20%) found in Thai individuals could also be identified in HapMap3. The majorities of CNVs discovered in the Thai population, however, were of low frequency, or uniquely identified in Thais. When performing hierarchical clustering using CNV frequencies, the CNV data were clustered into Africans, Europeans, and Asians, in line with the clustering performed with single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data. As CNV data are specific to origin of population, our population-specific reference database will serve as a valuable addition to the existing resources for the investigation of clinical significance of CNVs in Thais and related ethnicities."

https://openalex.org/W2126649325,"Ichnoviruses are large dsDNA viruses that belong to the Polydnaviridae family. They are specifically associated with endoparasitic wasps of the family Ichneumonidae and essential for host parasitization by these wasps. We sequenced the Hyposoter didymator Ichnovirus (HdIV) encapsidated genome for further analysis of the transcription pattern of the entire set of HdIV genes following the parasitization of four different lepidopteran host species. The HdIV genome was found to consist of at least 50 circular dsDNA molecules, carrying 135 genes, 98 of which formed 18 gene families. The HdIV genome had general features typical of Ichnovirus (IV) genomes and closely resembled that of the IV carried by Hyposoter fugitivus. Subsequent transcriptomic analysis with Illumina technology during the course of Spodoptera frugiperda parasitization led to the identification of a small subset of less than 30 genes with high RPKM values in permissive hosts, consisting with these genes encoding crucial virulence proteins. Comparisons of HdIV expression profiles between host species revealed differences in transcript levels for given HdIV genes between two permissive hosts, S. frugiperda and Pseudoplusia includens. However, we found no evident intrafamily gene-specific transcription pattern consistent with the presence of multigenic families within IV genomes reflecting an ability of the wasps concerned to exploit different host species. Interestingly, in two non-permissive hosts, Mamestra brassiccae and Anticarsia gemmatalis (most of the parasitoid eggs were eliminated by the host cellular immune response), HdIV genes were generally less strongly transcribed than in permissive hosts. This suggests that successful parasitism is dependent on the expression of given HdIV genes exceeding a particular threshold value. These results raise questions about the mecanisms involved in regulating IV gene expression according to the nature of the lepidopteran host species encountered."
https://openalex.org/W1995750034,"Introduction Inflammation and pulmonary edema are involved in the pathogenesis of seawater aspiration-induced acute lung injury (ALI). Although several studies have reported that 1α,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 (calcitriol) suppresses inflammation, it has not been confirmed to be effective in seawater aspiration-induced ALI. Thus, we investigated the effect of calcitriol on seawater aspiration-induced ALI and explored the probable mechanism. Methods Male SD rats receiving different doses of calcitriol or not, underwent seawater instillation. Then lung samples were collected at 4 h for analysis. In addition, A549 cells and rat pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (RPMVECs) were cultured with calcitriol or not and then stimulated with 25% seawater for 40 min. After these treatments, cells samples were collected for analysis. Results Results from real-time PCR showed that seawater stimulation up-regulated the expression of vitamin D receptor in lung tissues, A549 cells and RPMVECs. Seawater stimulation also activates NF-κB and RhoA/Rho kinase pathways. However, we found that pretreatment with calcitriol significantly inhibited the activation of NF-κB and RhoA/Rho kinase pathways. Meanwhile, treatment of calcitriol also improved lung histopathologic changes, reduced inflammation, lung edema and vascular leakage. Conclusions These results demonstrated that NF-κB and RhoA/Rho kinase pathways are critical in the development of lung inflammation and pulmonary edema and that treatment with calcitriol could ameliorate seawater aspiration-induced ALI, which was probably through the inhibition of NF-κB and RhoA/Rho kinase pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2043086790,"Uganda's forests are globally important for their conservation values but are under pressure from increasing human population and consumption. In this study, we examine how conversion of natural forest affects soil bacterial and fungal communities. Comparisons in paired natural forest and human-converted sites among four locations indicated that natural forest soils consistently had higher pH, organic carbon, nitrogen, and calcium, although variation among sites was large. Despite these differences, no effect on the diversity of dominant taxa for either bacterial or fungal communities was detected, using polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE). Composition of fungal communities did generally appear different in converted sites, but surprisingly, we did not observe a consistent pattern among sites. The spatial distribution of some taxa and community composition was associated with soil pH, organic carbon, phosphorus and sodium, suggesting that changes in soil communities were nuanced and require more robust metagenomic methods to understand the various components of the community. Given the close geographic proximity of the paired sampling sites, the similarity between natural and converted sites might be due to continued dispersal between treatments. Fungal communities showed greater environmental differentiation than bacterial communities, particularly according to soil pH. We detected biotic homogenization in converted ecosystems and substantial contribution of β-diversity to total diversity, indicating considerable geographic structure in soil biota in these forest communities. Overall, our results suggest that soil microbial communities are relatively resilient to forest conversion and despite a substantial and consistent change in the soil environment, the effects of conversion differed widely among sites. The substantial difference in soil chemistry, with generally lower nutrient quantity in converted sites, does bring into question, how long this resilience will last."
https://openalex.org/W1975652626,"Despite its superiority for evaluating gene expression, real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) results can be significantly biased by the use of inappropriate reference genes under different experimental conditions. Reaumuria soongorica is a dominant species of desert ecosystems in arid central Asia. Given the increasing interest in ecological engineering and potential genetic resources for arid agronomy, it is important to analyze gene function. However, systematic evaluation of stable reference genes should be performed prior to such analyses. In this study, the stabilities of 10 candidate reference genes were analyzed under 4 kinds of abiotic stresses (drought, salt, dark, and heat) within 4 accessions (HG010, HG020, XGG030, and XGG040) from 2 different habitats using 3 algorithms (geNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper). After validation of the ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase large unite (rbcL) expression pattern, our data suggested that histone H2A (H2A) and eukaryotic initiation factor 4A-2 (EIF4A2) were the most stable reference genes, cyclophilin (CYCL) was moderate, and elongation factor 1α (EF1α) was the worst choice. This first systematic analysis for stably expressed genes will facilitate future functional analyses and deep mining of genetic resources in R. soongorica and other species of the Reaumuria genus."
https://openalex.org/W2116150154,"Hematopoietic Stem Cell (HSC) targeted gene transfer is an attractive treatment option for a number of hematopoietic disorders caused by single gene defects. However, extensive methylation of promoter sequences results in silencing of therapeutic gene expression. The choice of an appropriate promoter is therefore crucial for reproducible, stable and long-term transgene expression in clinical gene therapy. Recent studies suggest efficient and stable expression of transgenes from the ubiquitous chromatin opening element (UCOE) derived from the human HNRPA2B1-CBX3 locus can be achieved in murine HSC. Here, we compared the use of HNRPA2B1-CBX3 UCOE (A2UCOE)-mediated transgene regulation to two other frequently used promoters namely EF1α and PGK in human fetal liver-derived HSC (hflHSC). Efficient transduction of hflHSC with a lentiviral vector containing an HNRPA2B1-CBX3 UCOE-eGFP (A2UCOE-eGFP) cassette was achieved at higher levels than that obtained with umbilical cord blood derived HSC (3.1x; p<0.001). While hflHSC were readily transduced with all three test vectors (A2UCOE-eGFP, PGK-eGFP and EF1α-eGFP), only the A2-UCOE construct demonstrated sustained transgene expression in vitro over 24 days (p<0.001). In contrast, within 10 days in culture a rapid decline in transgene expression in both PGK-eGFP and EF1α-eGFP transduced hflHSC was seen. Subsequently, injection of transduced cells into immunodeficient mice (NOD/SCID/Il2rg-/-) demonstrated sustained eGFP expression for the A2UCOE-eGFP group up to 10 months post transplantation whereas PGK-eGFP and EF1α-eGFP transduced hflHSC showed a 5.1 and 22.2 fold reduction respectively over the same time period. We conclude that the A2UCOE allows a more efficient and stable expression in hflHSC to be achieved than either the PGK or EF1α promoters and at lower vector copy number per cell."
https://openalex.org/W1982087396,"Background The health benefits of marriage have been demonstrated mainly by studies on Western populations. This study aims to test whether the benefits are also valid in East Asian populations. Methodology/Principal Findings Individuals (n = 8,538) from China, Japan, Taiwan, and the Republic of Korea were sampled from the 2006 East Asian Social Survey. The association between self-rated health status and two marriage-related independent variables was analyzed using multivariate logistic regression models. In a two-level analysis for individuals from all countries, married individuals were more likely to report very good or good health compared to their never-married counterparts [odds ratio (OR) 1.56; 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.16−2.10]. However, the addition of marital satisfaction disintegrated the significant association of marriage with self-rated health. Married individuals in satisfying marriages were more likely to report very good or good health compared with never-married individuals (OR 1.85; 95% CI 1.37−2.50). In contrast, married individuals in dissatisfying marriages were as likely to report very good or good health as never-married individuals (OR 0.78; 95% CI 0.50−1.24). In a one-level analysis for each country, the importance of marital satisfaction varied greatly across countries. Unlike in other countries, in Japan, married individuals in dissatisfying marriages were about half as likely to report very good or good health as never-married individuals (OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.31−0.83), thereby showing no significant benefits from marriage with regard to self-rated health. Conclusion/Significance The present study of East Asian countries suggests that marital satisfaction is of greater importance in determining self-rated health than marriage itself, and that the importance of marital satisfaction varies across countries. Further research is required to better understand the relationship between marital satisfaction and self-rated health in different socio-cultural settings, and to establish effective social policies aiming at improving public health."
https://openalex.org/W2019779638,"This study examined the effect of the polar moment of inertia of a tennis racket on upper limb loading in the serve. Eight amateur competition tennis players performed two sets of 10 serves using two rackets identical in mass, position of center of mass and moments of inertia other than the polar moment of inertia (0.00152 vs 0.00197 kg.m2). An eight-camera motion analysis system collected the 3D trajectories of 16 markers, located on the thorax, upper limbs and racket, from which shoulder, elbow and wrist net joint moments and powers were computed using inverse dynamics. During the cocking phase, increased racket polar moment of inertia was associated with significant increases in the peak shoulder extension and abduction moments, as well the peak elbow extension, valgus and supination moments. During the forward swing phase, peak wrist extension and radial deviation moments significantly increased with polar moment of inertia. During the follow-through phase, the peak shoulder adduction, elbow pronation and wrist external rotation moments displayed a significant inverse relationship with polar moment of inertia. During the forward swing, the magnitudes of negative joint power at the elbow and wrist were significantly larger when players served using the racket with a higher polar moment of inertia. Although a larger polar of inertia allows players to better tolerate off-center impacts, it also appears to place additional loads on the upper extremity when serving and may therefore increase injury risk in tennis players."
https://openalex.org/W2047293332,"The rapid developments in neuroscientific techniques raise high expectations among the general public and therefore warrant close monitoring of the translation to the media and daily-life applications. The need of empirical research into neuroscience communication is emphasized by its susceptibility to evoke misconceptions and polarized beliefs. As the mass media are the main sources of information about (neuro-)science for a majority of the general public, the objective of the current research is to quantify how critically and accurately newspapers report on neuroscience as a function of the timing of publication (within or outside of periods of heightened media attention to neuroscience, termed ""news waves""), the topic of the research (e.g. development, health, law) and the newspaper type (quality, popular, free newspapers). The results show that articles published during neuroscience news waves were less neutral and more optimistic, but not different in accuracy. Furthermore, the overall tone and accuracy of articles depended on the topic; for example, articles on development often had an optimistic tone whereas articles on law were often skeptical or balanced, and articles on health care had highest accuracy. Average accuracy was rather low, but articles in quality newspapers were relatively more accurate than in popular and free newspapers. Our results provide specific recommendations for researchers and science communicators, to improve the translation of neuroscience findings through the media: 1) Caution is warranted during periods of heightened attention (news waves), as reporting tends to be more optimistic; 2) Caution is also warranted not to follow topic-related biases in optimism (e.g., development) or skepticism (e.g., law); 3) Researchers should keep in mind that overall accuracy of reporting is low, and especially articles in popular and free newspapers provide a minimal amount of details. This indicates that researchers themselves may need to be more active in preventing misconceptions to arise."
https://openalex.org/W2088042346,"Regulation of inflammation is necessary to balance sufficient pathogen clearance with excessive tissue damage. Central to regulating inflammation is the switch from a pro-inflammatory pathway to an anti-inflammatory pathway. Macrophages are well-positioned to initiate this switch, and as such are the target of multiple therapeutics. One such potential therapeutic is methylthioadenosine (MTA), which inhibits TNFα production following LPS stimulation. We found that MTA could block TNFα production by multiple TLR ligands. Further, it prevented surface expression of CD69 and CD86 and reduced NF-KB signaling. We then determined that the mechanism of this action by MTA is signaling through adenosine A2 receptors. A2 receptors and TLR receptors synergized to promote an anti-inflammatory phenotype, as MTA enhanced LPS tolerance. In contrast, IL-1β production and processing was not affected by MTA exposure. Taken together, these data demonstrate that MTA reprograms TLR activation pathways via adenosine receptors to promote resolution of inflammation."

The aim of the present study is to explore the role of peroxynitrite (ONOO-) in aging resistance arterial vasorelaxation dysfunction and the possible mechanism. In the present study, young (3-4 months olds) and aging (20 months olds) male SD rats were randomized to receive vehicle (Saline) or FeTMPyP (ONOO- scavenger) for 2 weeks. The vasorelaxation of resistance arteries was determined in vitro; NOx level was tested by a colorimetric assay; the expression of nitrotyrosine (NT), soluble Guanylate Cyclase (sGC), vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP), phosphorylated VASP (P-VASP) and cGMP in resistance arteries were detected by immunohistochemical staining. In the present study, endothelium-dependent dilation in aging resistance arteries was lower than in those from young rats (young vs. aging: 68.0% ± 4.5% vs. 50.4% ± 2.9%, P<0.01). And the endothelium-independent dilation remained constant. Compared with young rats, aging increased nitrative stress in resistance arteries, evidenced by elevated NOx production in serum (5.3 ± 1.0 nmol/ml vs. 3.3 ± 1.4 nmol/ml, P<0.05) and increased NT expression (P<0.05). ONOO- was responsible for the vasorelaxation dysfunction, evidenced by normalized vasorelaxation after inhibit ONOO- or its sources (P<0.05) and suppressed NT expression after FeTMPyP treatment (P<0.05). The expression of sGC was not significantly different between young and aging resistance arteries, but the cGMP level and P-VASP/VASP ratio (biochemical marker of NO-sGC-cGKs signaling) decreased, which was reversed by FeTMPyP treatment in vivo (P<0.05). The present study suggested that ONOO- mediated the decline of endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation of aging resistance arteries by induction of the NO-sGC-cGKs pathway dysfunction."

Methods A cross sectional study of all consecutive CD patients seen at 2 large inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) referral centers in the Western Cape, South Africa between September 2011 and January 2013 was performed. Numerous demographic and clinical variables at diagnosis and date of study enrolment were identified using an investigator administered questionnaire as well as clinical examination and patient case notes. Using predefined definitions, disease behavior was stratified as ‘complicated’ or ‘uncomplicated’. Results One hundred and ninety four CD subjects were identified; 35 (18%) were white, 152 (78%) were Cape Coloured and 7(4%) were black. On multiple logistic regression analysis Cape Coloureds were significantly more likely to develop ‘complicated’ CD (60% vs. 9%, p = 0.023) during the disease course when compared to white subjects. In addition, significantly more white subjects had successfully discontinued cigarette smoking at study enrolment (31% vs. 7% reduction, p = 0.02). No additional inter-racial differences were found.

Horizontal and vertical eye movements were recorded in 28 EP and compared to 21 Parkinson's disease (PD) patients, and 27 age- and gender-matched healthy subjects using standardized oculomotor tasks with infrared videooculography. EP patients showed slow and hypometric horizontal saccades, an increased occurrence of square wave jerks, long latencies of vertical antisaccades, a high error rate in the horizontal antisaccade task, and made more errors than controls when pro- and antisaccades were mixed. Based on oculomotor performance, a direct differentiation between EP and PD was possible only by the velocity of horizontal saccades. All remaining metrics were similar between both patient groups. EP patients present extensive oculomotor disturbances probably due to manganese-induced damage to the basal ganglia, reflecting their role in oculomotor system."

For many viral diseases, vaccination with virus-like particles (VLPs) has shown considerable promise as a prophylactic approach; however, the processes of assembly and release of peste des petits ruminants virus (PPRV) VLPs are not well characterized, and their immunogenicity in the host is unknown. In this study, VLPs of PPRV were generated in a baculovirus system through simultaneous expression of PPRV matrix (M) protein and hemaglutin in (H) or fusion (F) protein. The released VLPs showed morphology similar to that of the native virus particles. Subcutaneous injection of these VLPs (PPRV-H, PPRV-F) into mice and goats elicited PPRV-specific IgG production, increased the levels of virus neutralizing antibodies, and promoted lymphocyte proliferation. Without adjuvants, the immune response induced by the PPRV-H VLPs was comparable to that obtained using equivalent amounts of PPRV vaccine. Thus, our results demonstrated that VLPs containing PPRV M protein and H or F protein are potential “differentiating infected from vaccinated animals” (DIVA) vaccine candidates for the surveillance and eradication of PPR."
https://openalex.org/W1994213181,"Purpose To determine the biometry of anterior segment dimensions of the human eye on both horizontal and vertical meridians with extended scan depth optical coherence tomography (OCT) during accommodation. Methods Twenty pre-presbyopic volunteers, aged between 24 and 30, were recruited. The ocular anterior segment of each subject was imaged using an extended scan depth OCT under non- and 3.0 diopters (D) of accommodative demands on both horizontal and vertical meridians. All the images were analyzed to yield the following parameters: pupil diameter (PD), anterior chamber depth (ACD), anterior and posterior surface curvatures of the crystalline lens (ASC and PSC) and the lens thickness (LT). Two consecutive measurements were performed to assess the repeatability and reproducibility of this OCT. They were evaluated by calculating the within-subject standard deviation (SD), a paired t-test, intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) and the coefficient of repeatability/reproducibility (CoR). Results There were no significant differences between two consecutive measurements on either horizontal or vertical meridians under both two different accommodative statuses (P>0.05). The ICC for all parameters ranged from 0.775 to 0.998, except for the PSC (0.550) on the horizontal meridian under the non-accommodative status. In addition, the CoR for most of the parameters were excellent (0.004% to 4.89%). In all the parameters, only PD and PSC were found different between the horizontal and vertical meridians under both accommodative statuses (P<0.05). PD, ACD, ASC and PSC under accommodative status were significantly smaller than those under the non-accommodative status, except that the PSC at the vertical meridian did not change. In addition, LT was significantly increased when accommodation. Conclusion The extended scan depth OCT successfully measured the dimensions of the anterior eye during accommodation with good repeatability and reproducibility on both horizontal and vertical meridians. The asymmetry of lens posterior surface and oval-shaped pupil were found during accommodation."

It compares the lymph node yield of a contemporary dataset compiled from the histopathology reports of 2178 patients who underwent surgery for primary colorectal cancer between 2005 and 2012 with that of a historic dataset compiled from the histopathology reports of 1038 patients who underwent surgery for colorectal cancer at 5 yearly intervals from 1975 to 2000. The mean lymph node yield was 14.91 in 2005 rising to 21.38 in 2012. In 2012 92.9% of all cases had at least 12 lymph nodes examined. Comparison of the mean lymph node yield and proportion of Dukes C cases shows a significant increase (Pearson correlation = 0.927, p = 0.001) in lymph node yield while there is no corresponding significant trend in the proportion of Dukes C cases (Pearson correlation = −0.138, p = 0.745).

https://openalex.org/W2016226427,"Antibody response to carbohydrate antigens is often independent of T cells and the process of affinity/specificity improvement is considered strictly dependent on the germinal centers. Antibodies induced during a T cell-independent type 2 (TI-2) response are less variable and less functionally versatile than those induced with T cell help. The antigen specificity consequences of accumulation of somatic mutations in antibodies during TI-2 responses of Marginal Zone (MZ) B cells is a fact that still needs explanation. Germline genes that define carbohydrate-reactive antibodies are known to sculpt antibody-combining sites containing innate, key side-chain contacts that define the antigen recognition step. However, substitutions associated with MZ B cell derived antibodies might affect the mobility and polyspecificity of the antibody. To examine this hypothesis, we analyzed antibodies reactive with the neolactoseries antigen Lewis Y (LeY) to define the residue subset required for the reactive repertoire for the LeY antigen. Our molecular simulation studies of crystallographically determined and modeled antibody-LeY complexes suggests that the heavy-chain germline gene VH7183.a13.20 and the light-chain Vκ cr1 germline gene are sufficient to account for the recognition of the trisaccharide-H determinant Types 1-4, while the specificity for LeY is driven by the CDR3 backbone conformation of the heavy chain and not the side chain interactions. These results confirm that these monoclonals use germline-encoded amino acids to recognize simple carbohydrate determinants like trisaccharide-H but relies on somatic mutations in the periphery of the combining site to modify affinity for LeY through electrostatic interactions that leads to their optimized binding. These observations bring further attention to the role of mutations in T-cell independent antibodies to distinguish self from non-self carbohydrate antigens."
https://openalex.org/W2054874563,"The significant roles of genetic variants in myasthenia gravis (MG) pathogenesis have been demonstrated in many studies, and recently it has been revealed that aberrant level/regulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) might contribute to the initiation and progression of MG. However, the dysfunction of miRNA associated with single nucleotide polymorphisms (miRSNPs) has not been well investigated in MG. In this study, we created a contemporary catalog of 89 MG risk genes via manual literature-mining. Based on this risk gene catalog, we obtained 18 MG risk pathways. Furthermore, we identified 93 miRNAs that target MG risk pathways and revealed the miRSNPs 'switches' in miRNA regulation in the MG risk pathways by integrating the database information of miRSNPs. We also constructed a miRNA-mediated SNP switching pathway network (MSSPN) to intuitively analyze miRNA regulation of MG risk pathways and the relationship of the polymorphism 'switch' with these changes in regulation. Moreover, we carried out in-depth dissection on the correlation between hsa05200 (pathway in cancer) and MG development, and elaborated the significance of 4 high-risk genes. By network analysis and literature mining, we proposed a potential mechanism of miRSNPs→gene→pathway effects on MG pathogenesis, especially for rs28457673 (miR-15/16/195/424/497 family)→IGF1R→hsa05200 (pathway in cancer).

We used the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of nuclear ribosomal DNA (nrDNA) and the chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) trnL-F region for phylogenetic reconstruction of Meconopsis and its close relatives Papaver, Roemeria, and Stylomecon. We identified five main clades, which were well-supported in the gene trees reconstructed with the nrDNA ITS and cpDNA trnL-F sequences. We found that 41 species of Asian Meconopsis did not constitute a monophyletic clade, but formed two solid clades (I and V) separated in the phylogenetic tree by three clades (II, III and IV) of Papaver and its allies. Clade V includes only four Asian Meconopsis species, with the remaining 90 percent of Asian species included in clade I. In this core Asian Meconopsis clade, five subclades (Ia–Ie) were recognized in the nrDNA ITS tree. Three species (Meconopsis discigera, M. pinnatifolia, and M. torquata) of subgenus Discogyne were imbedded in subclade Ia, indicating that the present definition of subgenera in Meconopsis should be rejected. These subclades are inconsistent with any series or sections of the present classifications, suggesting that classifications of the genus should be completely revised. Finally, proposals for further revision of the genus Meconopsis were put forward based on molecular, morphological, and biogeographical evidences."

Volunteers had to be clinically healthy, not pregnant and negative for HIV, Hepatitis B and C, and syphilis infection at both visits. At each visit, blood was taken for measurement of hemoglobin, haematocrit, mean corpuscular volume, red blood cells, platelets, total white blood cells (WBC), neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, basophils, CD4/CD8 T cells, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, direct bilirubin, total bilirubin, total immunoglobulin gamma, total protein, creatinine, total amylase, creatine phosphokinase and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Consensus dry season reference intervals were applied to rainy season values (and vice versa) and the proportion of 'out-of-range' values determined. Percentage differences between dry and rainy season parameter mean values were estimated.In this cohort of 903 volunteers, less than 10.0% of consensus parameter (except LDH) values in one season were ""out-of-range"" in the other. Twenty-two (22) percent of rainy season LDH values fell outside of the consensus dry season interval with the higher values observed in the rainy season. Variability between consensus seasonal means ranged from 0.0% (total WBC, neutrophils, monocytes, basophils, and direct bilirubin) to 40.0% (eosinophils). Within sites, the largest seasonal variations were observed for monocytes (Masaka, 11.5%), LDH (Lusaka, 21.7%), and basophils (Kigali, 22.2%).Seasonality had minimal impact on adult clinical laboratory parameter values in Rwanda, Zambia, and Uganda.
