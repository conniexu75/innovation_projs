https://openalex.org/W2038751264,"The proteasome consists of a 20S proteolytic core particle (CP) and a 19S regulatory particle (RP), which selects ubiquitinated substrates for translocation into the CP. An eight-subunit subcomplex of the RP, the lid, can be dissociated from proteasomes prepared from a deletion mutant for Rpn10, an RP subunit. A second subcomplex, the base, contains all six proteasomal ATPases and links the RP to the CP. The base is sufficient to activate the CP for degradation of peptides or a nonubiquitinated protein, whereas the lid is required for ubiquitin-dependent degradation. By electron microscopy, the base and the lid correspond to the proximal and distal masses of the RP, respectively. The lid subunits share sequence motifs with components of the COP9/signalosome complex and eIF3, suggesting that these functionally diverse particles have a common evolutionary ancestry."

https://openalex.org/W2030665169,"We have used confocal videomicroscopy in real time to delineate the adhesive interactions supporting platelet thrombus formation on biologically relevant surfaces. Type I collagen fibrils exposed to flowing blood adsorb von Willebrand factor (vWF), to which platelets become initially tethered with continuous surface translocation mediated by the membrane glycoprotein Ibα. This step is essential at high wall shear rates to allow subsequent irreversible adhesion and thrombus growth mediated by the integrins α2β1 and αIIbβ3. On subendothelial matrix, endogenous vWF and adsorbed plasma vWF synergistically initiate platelet recruitment, and α2β1 remains key along with αIIbβ3 for normal thrombus development at all but low shear rates. Thus, hemodynamic forces and substrate characteristics define the platelet adhesion pathways leading to thrombogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2127398512,"Natural isolates of C. elegans exhibit either solitary or social feeding behavior. Solitary foragers move slowly on a bacterial lawn and disperse across it, while social foragers move rapidly on bacteria and aggregate together. A loss-of-function mutation in the npr-1 gene, which encodes a predicted G protein-coupled receptor similar to neuropeptide Y receptors, causes a solitary strain to take on social behavior. Two isoforms of NPR-1 that differ at a single residue occur in the wild. One isoform, NPR-1 215F, is found exclusively in social strains, while the other isoform, NPR-1 215V, is found exclusively in solitary strains. An NPR-1 215V transgene can induce solitary feeding behavior in a wild social strain. Thus, isoforms of a putative neuropeptide receptor generate natural variation in C. elegans feeding behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2083358105,"Caveolin-1 functions as a membrane adaptor to link the integrin α subunit to the tyrosine kinase Fyn. Upon integrin ligation, Fyn is activated and binds, via its SH3 domain, to Shc. Shc is subsequently phosphorylated at tyrosine 317 and recruits Grb2. This sequence of events is necessary to couple integrins to the Ras–ERK pathway and promote cell cycle progression. These findings reveal an unexpected function of caveolin-1 and Fyn in integrin signaling and anchorage-dependent cell growth."
https://openalex.org/W2102868284,"The Smad family of proteins, which are frequently targeted by tumorigenic mutations in cancer, mediate TGF-beta signaling from cell membrane to nucleus. The crystal structure of a Smad3 MH1 domain bound to an optimal DNA sequence determined at 2.8 A resolution reveals a novel DNA-binding motif. In the crystals, base-specific DNA recognition is provided exclusively by a conserved 11-residue beta hairpin that is embedded in the major groove of DNA. A surface loop region, to which tumorigenic mutations map, has been identified as a functional surface important for Smad activity. This structure establishes a framework for understanding how Smad proteins may act in concert with other transcription factors in the regulation of TGF-beta-responsive genes."
https://openalex.org/W2019286212,"Recognition of antigen by T cells requires the formation of a specialized junction between the T cell and the antigen-presenting cell. This junction is generated by the recruitment and the exclusion of specific proteins from the contact area. The mechanisms that regulate these events are unknown. Here we demonstrate that ligand engagement of the adhesion molecule, CD2, initiates a process of protein segregation, CD2 clustering, and cytoskeletal polarization. Although protein segregation was not dependent on the cytoplasmic domain of CD2, CD2 clustering and cytoskeletal polarization required an interaction of the CD2 cytoplasmic domain with a novel SH3-containing protein. This novel protein, called CD2AP, is likely to facilitate receptor patterning in the contact area by linking specific adhesion receptors to the cytoskeleton."
https://openalex.org/W2017168486,"SKOR, a K+ channel identified in Arabidopsis, displays the typical hydrophobic core of the Shaker channel superfamily, a cyclic nucleotide-binding domain, and an ankyrin domain. Expression in Xenopus oocytes identified SKOR as the first member of the Shaker family in plants to be endowed with outwardly rectifying properties. SKOR expression is localized in root stelar tissues. A knockout mutant shows both lower shoot K+ content and lower xylem sap K+ concentration, indicating that SKOR is involved in K+ release into the xylem sap toward the shoots. SKOR expression is strongly inhibited by the stress phytohormone abscisic acid, supporting the hypothesis that control of K+ translocation toward the shoots is part of the plant response to water stress."

https://openalex.org/W1974425687,"We have identified the yeast CRT1 gene as an effector of the DNA damage and replication checkpoint pathway. CRT1 encodes a DNA-binding protein that recruits the general repressors Ssn6 and Tup1 to the promoters of damage-inducible genes. Derepression of the Crt1 regulon suppresses the lethality of mec1 and rad53 null alleles and is essential for cell viability during replicative stress. In response to DNA damage and replication blocks, Crt1 becomes hyperphosphorylated and no longer binds DNA, resulting in transcriptional induction. CRT1 is autoregulated and is itself induced by DNA damage, indicating the existence of a negative feedback pathway that facilitates return to the repressed state after elimination of damage. The inhibition of an autoregulatory repressor in response to DNA damage is a strategy conserved throughout prokaryotic and eukaryotic evolution."

S. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 11671–11673). Human pre-B REH cells express high levels of Bcl2 yet remain sensitive to the chemotherapeutic agents etoposide, cytosine arabinoside, and Adriamycin. In contrast, myeloid leukemia-derived HL60 cells express less than half the level of Bcl-2 but are >10-fold more resistant to apoptosis induced by these drugs. The mechanism responsible for this apparent dichotomy appears to involve a deficiency of mitochondrial PKCα since 1) HL60 but not REH cells contain highly phosphorylated Bcl2; 2) PKCα is the only classical isoform co-localized with Bcl2 in HL60 but not REH mitochondrial membranes; 3) the natural product and potent PKC activator bryostatin-1 induces mitochondrial localization of PKCα in association with Bcl2 phosphorylation and increased REH cell resistance to drug-induced apoptosis; 4) PKCα can directly phosphorylate wild-type but not phosphorylation-negative and loss of function S70A Bcl2 in vitro; 5) stable, forced expression of exogenous PKCα induces mitochondrial localization of PKCα, increased Bcl2 phosphorylation and a >10-fold increase in resistance to drug-induced cell death; and (6Coustan-Smith E.

The Bcl2 family plays a central role in mammalian programmed cell death pathways by suppressing (e.g. Bcl2, Bcl-XL) or promoting (e.g. Bax, Bad, Bcl-Xs) apoptosis (1Yang E. Korsmeyer S.J. Blood. 1996; 88: 386-401Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A popular model of Bcl2 antiapoptotic function suggests that Bcl2 actively forms heterodimers with Bax to neutralize the latter's proapoptotic activity (2Oltvai Z.N. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 609-619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5823) Google Scholar). There are exceptions, however, where even high levels of Bcl2 expression apparently fail to prevent cell death (1Yang E. Korsmeyer S.J. Blood. 1996; 88: 386-401Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Legdeur M.C.J.C. Bontje P.M. Ossenkopple G.J. Beelen R.H.J. van de Loosdrecht A.A. Broekhoeven M.G. Langenhuisjen M.M.A.C. Thijsen S.F.T. Hofstee H. Schuurhuis G.J. Exp. Hematol. 1996; 24: 1530-1539PubMed Google Scholar). For example, the negative selection of thymocytes is not blocked by Bcl2 (4Sentman D.L. Shutter J.R. Hockenbery D. Kanagawa O. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1991; 67: 879-888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1151) Google Scholar). In addition, B lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells, despite expressing high levels of Bcl2 (5Campana D. Coustan-Smith E. Manabe A. Buschle M. Raimondi S.C. Behm F.G. Ashmun R. Arico M. Biondi A. Pui C.H. Blood. 1993; 81: 1025-1031Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), remain clinically sensitive to apoptosis induced by chemotherapeutic drugs (6Coustan-Smith E. Kitanaka A. Pui C.H. McNinch L. Evans W.E. Raimondi S.C. Behm F.G. Arico M. Campana D. Blood. 1996; 87: 1140-1146Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These exceptions indicate that Bcl2 expression alone is not sufficient to block apoptosis. This suggests either that Bcl2 may not be active to suppress apoptosis under all circumstances or that pathway(s) not involving Bcl2 may exist to regulate programmed cell death. Recent studies have shown that phosphorylation of Bcl2 is required for the antiapoptotic function of Bc12 (7May W.S. Tyler P.G. Ito T. Armstrong D.K. Qatsha K.A. Davidson N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26865-26870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Ito T. Deng X. Carr B. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11671-11673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). In the murine interleukin-3-dependent cell lines FDCP1/ER and NSF.N1/H7, it was initially discovered that potent inhibitors of protein kinases, such as staurosporine and the methylpiperazine H-7, could block agonist-induced Bcl2 phosphorylation in association with induction of apoptosis (7May W.S. Tyler P.G. Ito T. Armstrong D.K. Qatsha K.A. Davidson N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26865-26870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A role for protein kinase C (PKC)1 was implicated since the potent PKC activator bryostatin-1 (bryo) can mimic interleukin-3 by inducing Bcl2 phosphorylation and promoting cell survival (9Fields A.P. Pincus S.M. Kraft A.S. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21896-21901Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, since direct phosphorylation of Bcl2 in vitro by a pan PKC mixture was found to be Ca2+-dependent, a role for a classic PKC isoform was suggested (7May W.S. Tyler P.G. Ito T. Armstrong D.K. Qatsha K.A. Davidson N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26865-26870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In support of these findings, our recent results indicate that Bcl2 phosphorylation occurs at serine 70, a PKC consensus phosphorylation site, and is required for the antiapoptotic function of Bc12 following the stress of growth factor withdrawal or chemotherapy (8Ito T. Deng X. Carr B. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11671-11673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Thus, post-translational modifications of Bcl2 appear to be involved in regulating apoptosis in response to various stress stimuli. From these data we hypothesize that, at least in part, appropriate regulation of apoptosis may depend upon the activity of the agonist-induced signal that mediates both PKC activation and Bcl2 phosphorylation. While other functional Bcl2 kinases may also exist (8Ito T. Deng X. Carr B. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11671-11673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar), our focus was to test whether a PKC-Bcl2 connection may exist. Perturbation of such a signaling pathway could dramatically affect the response of cells to apoptotic signals including antileukemic therapy. To assess whether a specific classic PKC isoform may be responsible for Bcl2 phosphorylation and increased resistance to chemotherapy, we compared human pre-B REH cells, which express high levels of Bcl2 but remain sensitive to chemotherapy, with HL60 leukemic cells, which express approximately one-half the amount of Bcl2 but are >10-fold more resistant to chemotherapy. Results indicate that a mechanism involving mitochondrial PKCα and Bcl2 phosphorylation may, at least in part, explain these findings. All reagents used were purchased from commercial sources unless otherwise stated. Bryostatin-1 was the kind gift of G. R. Pettit (Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ). REH and HL60 cells were obtained from the ATCC (Rockville, MD) and maintained in RPMI 1640 + 10% bovine calf serum at 37 °C in 5% CO2. The PKCα cDNA containing cytomegalovirus plasmid was a kind gift of Alan Fields (University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, TX). The plasmid was introduced into REH cells by electroporation (200 V, 975 μF capacitance) and selected and maintained in the above medium plus 0.6 mg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were treated with increasing doses of etoposide (VP16; Sigma), cytosine arabinoside (araC; Upjohn, Kalamazoo, MI), Adriamycin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), or staurosporine (Calbiochem) for 24 or 48 h. Where indicated, cells were incubated with 10 nm bryostatin-1 for 1 h prior to the addition of the chemotherapeutic drug. Cell viability was measured by trypan blue dye exclusion (8Ito T. Deng X. Carr B. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11671-11673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar), and apoptosis was analyzed using a variation of a conventional FACS method to detect sub-2N DNA content in nonviable cells (10Murakami T. Gong J. Bhatia U. Traganos F. Darzynkiewicz Z. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 3093-3098PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were treated with VP16, fixed in methanol, incubated with 0.1 mg/ml RNase A, and stained with 0.1 mg/ml propidium iodide (Sigma) prior to analysis using a Becton Dickinson FACScan (Flow Cytometry Facility, University of Texas Medical Branch). Total cellular protein (100 μg) was electrophoresed in a 10–12% acrylamide, 0.1% SDS gel and transferred to nitrocellulose. Western blotting analysis was performed with antibodies against each of the classical PKC isoforms (12Earl D.C. Korner A. Biochem. J. 1965; 94: 721-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), Bcl2 (7May W.S. Tyler P.G. Ito T. Armstrong D.K. Qatsha K.A. Davidson N.E. J. Biol.

Carr B. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11671-11673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Quantitation of detected proteins was performed by densitometric analysis using a model SI Personal Densitometer (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Cells were labeled with [32P]orthophosphoric acid, treated with 10 nmbryostatin-1, and Bcl2 or Bax was analyzed by immunoprecipitation as described previously (7May W.S. Tyler P.G. Ito T.

Chem. 1997; 272: 11671-11673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Samples were electrophoresed in a 12% acrylamide, 0.1% SDS gel, transferred to nitrocellulose, and exposed to Kodak X-Omat film at −80 °C. The same blot was used for Western blotting with an anti-Bcl2 antisera and developed using ECL (Amersham kit) as described previously (8Ito T. Deng X. Carr B. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11671-11673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Subcellular fractionation of cells was performed by a previously described method (11Wang H.G. Rapp U.R. Reed J.C. Cell. 1996; 87: 629-638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were swelled in ice-cold hypotonic Hepes buffer (10 mm Hepes at pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 40 mm Kcl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin) for 30 min, aspirated repeatedly through a 25-gauge needle (25 strokes), and centrifuged at 200 × g to pellet nuclei. The resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 10,000 × g to pellet the heavy membrane (HM) fraction containing mitochondria. The resulting HM supernatant was centrifuged at 150,000 × g to pellet the plasma membranes (light membranes), and the supernatant represented the cytosol. The nuclear membranes were isolated by centrifugation of the nuclei through a 2m sucrose cushion at 150,000 × g. The purity of the HM fraction was assessed by determining the percent succinate dehydrogenase (12Earl D.C. Korner A. Biochem. J. 1965; 94: 721-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Results indicate a >99% activity of the enzyme in the HM fraction and <1% of the total activity in the other fractions (data not shown). Western blotting analysis for the cell surface transferrin receptor indicated localization to the light membrane fraction only (data not shown). Subcellular fractions were subjected to denaturing electrophoresis in a 12% acrylamide, 0.1% SDS gel and transferred to nitrocellulose for PKC isoform-specific (13Hocevar B.A. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 28-33Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Bcl2 (7May W.S. Tyler P.G. Ito T. Armstrong D.K. Qatsha K.A. Davidson N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26865-26870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or Bax (8Ito T. Deng X. Carr B. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11671-11673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar) Western blotting as described above. Phosphorylation of Bcl2 in vitro was performed as described previously except that purified human PKCα (Pan Vera, Madison, WI) was used instead of rat brain pan PKC mixture (7May W.S. Tyler P.G. Ito T. Armstrong D.K. Qatsha K.A. Davidson N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26865-26870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, immunoprecipitated Bcl2 was resuspended in 50 μl of kinase buffer that contained 50 mm Tris (pH 7.2), 50 mm NaCl, 1% glycerol, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm CaCl2, 100 μm ATP, 1 μCi [γ-32P]ATP, 40 μg/ml phosphatidyl serine, 10 nm bryo, and 0.4 μg of PKCα. The mixture was incubated for 30 min at 30 °C, and phosphorylated proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and detected by autoradiography as described above. The identity of Bcl2 was confirmed by Western analysis. Bcl2 expression is significantly higher in some B lymphocyte leukemic cells compared with normal B lymphocytes (5Campana D. Coustan-Smith E. Manabe A. Buschle M. Raimondi S.C. Behm F.G. Ashmun R. Arico M. Biondi A. Pui C.H. Blood. 1993; 81: 1025-1031Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Coustan-Smith E. Kitanaka A. Pui C.H. McNinch L. Evans W.E. Raimondi S.C. Behm F.G. Arico M. Campana D. Blood. 1996; 87: 1140-1146Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The representative pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia REH cell line expresses ∼30-fold higher levels of Bcl2 than do normal CD10+ immature B cells (5Campana D. Coustan-Smith E. Manabe A. Buschle M. Raimondi S.C. Behm F.G. Ashmun R. Arico M. Biondi A. Pui C.H. Blood. 1993; 81: 1025-1031Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Yet the leukemic cells remain highly sensitive to induction-remission chemotherapy with >90% of patients entering a complete remission (14Ito T. May W.S. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 403-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). REH and HL60 cells were treated with three clinically useful antileukemia drugs with different mechanisms of action including VP16, araC, and Adriamycin. While treatment with 1 μm VP16 was found to induce death in 50% of the REH cells at 24 h (IC50 = 1 μm), the IC50 in HL60 cells was 26 μm, demonstrating a >20-fold resistance (Fig. 1 A and Table I). Similarly, REH cells demonstrate an increased sensitivity pattern to araC and Adriamycin with IC50 values consistently 10-fold lower than those for HL60 cells (Table I). The mechanism of cell death induced by each drug was identified by FACS analysis to be apoptosis, but only results for VP16 are shown (Fig. 1 B). Chromosomal sub-2N DNA populations could be detected in REH cells that were treated with as little as 0.1 μm VP16, while similar populations were not detected in HL60 cells until at least 10 μm VP16 was used. These results indicate that both cell lines undergo apoptosis following chemotherapy but with vastly different relative drug sensitivities.Table IEffect of bryostatin-1 on cell survivalCellBryostatin-1 (10 nM)VP16 IC50VP16 fold increase survivalAraC IC50AraC fold increase survivalAdriamycin IC50Adriamycin fold increase survivalμmμg/mlμg/mlHL60−26>20>2HL60+1101401.90REH−11.90.2REH+99>20>10210IC50 is the drug concentration that results in 50% cell killing at 24 h as derived from timed dose response curves as in Fig. 1 A.

Values were derived from experiments that were carried out at least three times. The fold increase in survival was calculated as: IC50 with bryostatin-1/IC50 control. One possible explanation for the differences in chemosensitivity is differential Bcl2 and/or Bax expression. Bcl2 and Bax protein levels were compared in REH and HL60 cells. Actin expression was measured to normalize for differences in protein loading. Bcl2 expression in HL60 cells was less than half (∼33%) that for REH cells as determined by densitometry (Fig. 1 C). Furthermore, the levels of Bax are slightly higher in HL60 cells (∼131%) compared with REH cells (Fig. 1 C). These findings indicate that the Bcl2/Bax ratio is higher in REH cells than in HL60 cells and, according to a currently held model, would predict that REH cells will exhibit a greater resistance to drug-induced apoptosis (2Oltvai Z.N. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 609-619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5823) Google Scholar). However, as REH cells exhibit a greater sensitivity to apoptosis-inducing drugs than do HL60 cells (Fig. 1 A and Table I), any enhanced chemosensitivity in REH cells cannot be explained by simple quantitative differences in the expression of Bcl2 or Bax. This prompted us to test for a possible qualitative defect in Bcl2. Since Bcl2 phosphorylation has been shown to be required for full and potent suppression of apoptosis in factor-dependent murine cell lines (7May W.S. Tyler P.G. Ito T. Armstrong D.K. Qatsha K.A. Davidson N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26865-26870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Ito T. Deng X. Carr B. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11671-11673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar), the basal phosphorylation status of Bcl2 in REH and HL60 cells was assessed. Interestingly, the increased sensitivity of REH cells to chemotherapy was found to be closely correlated with a markedly decreased level of Bcl2 phosphorylation compared with that for HL60 cells, which show an intrinsically high level of Bcl2 phosphorylation (Fig. 2). Next, whether the level of Bcl2 phosphorylation could be augmented and correlate with chemosensitivity was tested. Specifically whether PKC activation following bryo treatment (15Lewin N.E. Dell'Aquila M.L. Petit G.R. Blumberg P.M. Warren B.S. Biochem.

Treatment of REH cells with bryo for 30 min prior to drug addition was found to significantly improve survival of REH cells following treatment with any of the three toxic drugs (Table I). Interestingly, however, bryo did not significantly alter either Bcl2 phosphorylation in HL60 cells or the drug resistance profile observed with Adriamycin and may even have rendered the cells slightly more sensitive to VP16 and araC (i.e. up to 2-fold; Table I). Therefore, the mechanism(s) for increased REH cell resistance is of intense interest. Furthermore, in addition to induction of Bcl2 phosphorylation, bryo treatment of REH cells significantly increases their resistance (>10-fold) to apoptosis in response to all three drugs (Table I). The relatively low basal level of Bcl2 phosphorylation in REH cells and the dramatic increase observed with bryo treatment may result from either a low level of expression of a PKC isoform expression and/or activity in REH compared with HL60 cells (7May W.S. Tyler P.G. Ito T. Armstrong D.K. Qatsha K.A. Davidson N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26865-26870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we assessed whether a PKC isoform was a functional Bcl2 kinase and whether the failure of the Bcl2 kinase to co-localize with and/or be activated in Bcl2-containing mitochondrial membranes might account for the differential Bcl2 phosphorylation observed. Bcl2 is localized in outer mitochondrial and nuclear membranes and in the endoplasmic reticulum (16Hockenbery D. Nunez G. Milliman C. Schreiber R.D. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1990; 348: 334-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (3514) Google Scholar, 17Nguyen M. Millar D.G. Yong V.W. Korsmeyer S.J. Shore G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25265-25268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There is evidence that suppression of apoptosis by Bcl2 requires mitochondrial localization (18Petit P.X. Susin S.A. Zamzami N. Minotte B. Kroemer G. FEBS Lett. 1996; 396: 7-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). A recent study showed that Bcl2 must be targeted to mitochondrial membranes in order to efficiently suppress apoptosis following serum deprivation in both MDCK and Rat-1/Myc cells (19Zhu W. Cowie A. Wasfy G.W. Penn L.Z. Leber B. Andrews D.W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4130-4141Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Since PKCα and PKCβII are the only classic isoforms that we and others have found to be expressed in HL60 cells (Fig. 3) (20Murray N.R. Burns D.J. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21385-21390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), subcellular fractionation studies were carried out to determine whether a classic PKC isoform and Bcl2 were co-localized and if so, whether a potential defect might occur in REH cells. Results indicate that PKCα, but not PKCβII, is expressed in the HM fraction containing mitochondria in HL60 cells (Fig. 3). In contrast, little PKCα is localized to the HM fraction in REH cells, suggesting a possible mechanism to account, at least in part, for the decreased Bcl2 phosphorylation observed. Since no detectable PKCβIIcould be observed in the mitochondrial membranes and bryo appears to down-regulate cytosolic PKCβII in both cell lines (Fig. 3), a role for this isoform in Bcl2 phosphorylation was eliminated. Next, since bryo treatment can induce Bcl2 phosphorylation in REH cells, a potential defect in PKCα subcellular localization was assessed. Results reveal that treatment of cells with 10 nmbryo for 24 h dramatically increases the mitochondrial PKCα levels, presumably as a result of the well described mechanism by which PKC can be translocated to the membrane and activated (21Pagano R.E. Longmuir K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 1909-1916Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus Bcl2 phosphorylation may require the presence of mitochondrial PKCα activity. However, the failure of the agonist to augment Bcl2 phosphorylation in HL60 cells is not altogether clear. Perhaps the relatively high endogenous levels of mitochondrial PKCα and Bcl2 phosphorylation observed in these cells cannot be further enhanced even by this potent agonist (Fig. 2). Nevertheless, the exciting possibility that mitochondrial PKCα may be involved in Bcl2 phosphorylation and REH cell resistance was further evaluated. Previous studies have shown that a pan PKC mixture can directly phosphorylate Bcl2in vitro in a Ca2+-dependent manner (7May W.S. Tyler P.G. Ito T. Armstrong D.K. Qatsha K.A. Davidson N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26865-26870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Ito T. Deng X. Carr B. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11671-11673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). To ascertain whether PKCα can directly phosphorylate Bcl2in vitro, purified human PKCα was used in a kinase reconstitution assay described previously (7May W.S. Tyler P.G. Ito T. Armstrong D.K. Qatsha K.A. Davidson N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26865-26870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Bcl2 immunoprecipitated from murine cells overexpressing the murine protein was used as substrate. PKCα was found to actively phosphorylate Bcl2 in vitro (Fig. 4). To determine if PKCα could selectively phosphorylate the physiologic serine 70 site, immunoprecipitates of mutant Bcl2 protein was tested. Bcl2 mutants at serine 24 (S24A, which is phosphorylated and functional in suppressing apoptosis) (8Ito T. Deng X. Carr B. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11671-11673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar) or serine 70 (S70A, which is not phosphorylated and nonfunctional in suppressing apoptosis) (8Ito T. Deng X. Carr B. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11671-11673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar) were used as substrates in the in vitro kinase assay. Results reveal that PKCα was able to robustly phosphorylate both the wild-type and S24A Bcl2, but not the S70A Bcl2 (Fig. 4). Since S70A Bcl2 mutant protein was purified from stably transfected NSF.N1/H7 cells that also express low but barely detectable levels of endogenous Bcl2 (7May W.S. Tyler P.G. Ito T. Armstrong D.K. Qatsha K.A. Davidson N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26865-26870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), any phosphorylation observed in the S70A immunoprecipitate may represent residual endogenous Bcl2. Therefore, the ability of PKCα to phosphorylate Bcl2 at the serine 70 consensus PKC site in vitro supports a role for this isoform as a Bcl2 kinase. To confirm a role for PKCα in Bcl2 phosphorylation and survival following chemotherapy, REH cells were transfected, and clones stably expressing exogenous PKCα were analyzed. Analysis of three clones revealed at least a 5-fold increase in the level of PKCα expression compared with parental or empty vector-alone transfected cells (Fig. 5and Table II). Subcellular fractionation studies revealed that the pattern of PKCα localization in the vector-alone transformed cells mirrored that for parental REH cells (compare Figs. 3 and 6 A). In contrast, overexpression of the PKCα isoform leads to increased levels of PKCα in all fractions, including the mitochondrial membrane-containing HM fraction (Fig. 6 A). A comparison of HM fractions isolated from the three clones reveals that increased mitochondrial PKCα is detected compared with the empty vector transformed cells and PKCα levels are highest in clone 6 and lowest in clone 3 (Fig. 6 B). Significantly, overexpression of the PKCα isoform did not lead to an alteration in Bcl2 expression and eliminates the possibility that the experimentally observed effects are due to Bcl2 up-regulation (Fig. 5 and Table II). These results strongly suggest that the regulatory effect of PKCα on Bcl2 is post-translational and therefore qualitative. As observed in parental REH cells, there is little or no Bcl2 phosphorylation in the untreated empty vector transformed cells while bryo treatment significantly increases phosphorylation (Fig. 7 A). On the other hand, PKCα transfection leads to a significant increase in both Bcl2 phosphorylation (∼3–6-fold; Fig. 7, A and B, and Table III) and survival of clones following drug exposure (i.e. ∼6–13-fold; Fig. 8 and Table III). The enhanced chemoresistance pattern observed for the PKCα-overexpressing clones mimics the results for bryo treatment of parental or empty vector REH-transformed cells (Fig. 8, Tables I and III). Interestingly, bryo treatment of clones overexpressing PKCα results in a further increase in mitochondrial PKCα localization (Fig. 6 A) and Bcl2 phosphorylation (∼3–5-fold; Fig. 7, A and B; Table III) and importantly, leads to an additional 2–4-fold increase in chemoresistance (Fig. 8 and Table III). Thus, at least for REH cells, the potent PKC agonist bryo can further stimulate Bcl2 survival function, solidifying a role for PKCα. In addition, these findings indicate that resistance to drug-induced apoptosis is strongly correlated with mitochondrial PKCα expression and the degree of Bcl2 phosphorylation. For example, clone 3, which exhibits the lowest level of mitochondrial PKCα expression, also shows the weakest phosphorylation of Bcl2 (Fig. 7 and Table III) and the smallest increase in chemoresistance (Table III). Alternatively, clone 6 demonstrates the highest level of Bcl2 phosphorylation and the greatest chemoresistance.Table IIExpression of PKCα and Bcl2 in ClonesParentalVectorClone 3Clone 5Clone 6PKCα10.787.65.16.1Bcl210.860.680.870.73Values were derived by comparing densitometric numbers with parental REH values after adjusting for actin expression relative to parental REH actin expression.

Values were normalized against the REH vector control (which was assigned a value of 1.0). It has been reported that apoptosis induced by the potent protein kinase inhibitor, staurosporine, can be suppressed by the overexpression of exogenous Bcl2 (22Hunter J.J. Bond B.L. Parslow T.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 877-883Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since staurosporine at concentrations that would be expected to inhibit PKCin vivo does not completely block agonist-induced Bcl2 phosphorylation in NSF/N1.H7 cells stably overexpressing exogenous Bcl2, it is likely that a staurosporine-resistant Bcl2 kinase may also exist (8Ito T. Deng X. Carr B. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11671-11673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Thus, there may be more than one functional Bcl2 kinase. Nevertheless, it appears that bryo activates PKCα and promotes Bcl2 phosphorylation and chemoresistance and that PKCα can directly phosphorylate Bcl2 at serine 70 (Fig. 4). Therefore, to determine if bryo could also affect cellular resistance to staurosporine, REH cell clones overexpressing exogenous PKCα were treated with increasing concentrations of staurosporine in the absence or presence of bryo. Results reveal that for either vector-alone transfected controls or the PKCα clones there is no apparent survival difference following staurosporine treatment, even when the cells are simultaneously treated with bryo to maximize activation of PKC (Fig. 9). By contrast, and consistent with results reported here that indicate a role for PKCα, treatment with bryo does promote increased survival when cells are treated with the non-kinase inhibitor chemotherapeutic agent VP16 (Fig. 8). The ability of bryo to increase survival of these clones following VP16 treatment, while at the same time failing to protect the cells from staurosporine, is consistent with a functional role for PKCα in Bcl2 phosphorylation and the drug resistance phenotype. However, it does not rule out the potential existence of a second, staurosporine-resistant Bcl2 kinase that may function under other conditions, such as when Bcl2 is forcibly overexpressed (8Ito T. Deng X. Carr B. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11671-11673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar, 22Hunter J.J. Bond B.L. Parslow T.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 877-883Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is clear from these data that either the treatment of parental REH cells with the PKC agonist bryo or the simple overexpression of exogenous PKCα results in increased mitochondrial PKCα localization, augmented Bcl2 phosphorylation, and enhanced chemoresistance. These findings suggest a mechanism whereby PKCα mediates Bcl2 phosphorylation and accounts for the increased cell survival observed following chemotherapy. While the mechanism by which a significant fraction of exogenous PKCα may become localized to the mitochondria is not yet clear, this may result from cytosolic to mitochondrial translocation, which may result from the mitochondrial generation of diacylglycerol as reported previously (21Pagano R.E. Longmuir K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 1909-1916Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Such a plasma membrane translocation mechanism for PKC activation is well described elsewhere (23Nishizuka Y. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 484-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2347) Google Scholar). These results now tightly correlate mitochondrial PKCα expression, Bcl2 phosphorylation, and resistance to antileukemic drug therapy. While other mechanisms potentially involved in drug resistance (e.g. multidrug resistance) might also be affected by PKCα expression and/or bryo treatment, the findings reported here clearly identify a major role for mitochondrial PKCα in regulating Bcl2 phosphorylation and its function in suppressing drug-induced apoptosis. However, while these novel findings help to identify a role for a classic PKC isoform in antiapoptotic Bcl2 signaling, we cannot rule out that PKCα may also act indirectly to enhance Bcl2 phosphorylation. Thus, even though purified PKCα can efficiently and directly phosphorylate Bcl2 at serine 70 in vitro (Fig. 4), we and others have previously discovered that PKC can also directly activate other protein kinases required for cell growth, including Raf-1 (24Kolch W. Heidecker G. Kochs G. Hummel R. Vahidi H. Mischak H. Finkenzeller G. Marme D. Rapp U.R. Nature. 1993; 364: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (1149) Google Scholar, 25Carroll M.P. May W.S. J. Biol.

Since Raf-1 has been recently reported to associate with Bcl2 and can increase survival when expressed and localized to the mitochondria (11Wang H.G. Rapp U.R. Reed J.C. Cell. 1996; 87: 629-638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar), activated Raf-1 may also affect Bcl2 phosphorylation. Therefore, while we believe that the simplest explanation for these results supports a role for PKCα as a direct Bcl2 kinase, it is formally possible that PKCα may function indirectly. It is also possible that another physiologic Bcl2 kinase may also exist to potentially regulate Bcl2 function. For example, we previously have discovered evidence to support the existence of a staurosporine-resistant Bcl2 kinase (8Ito T. Deng X. Carr B. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11671-11673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). In that study, residual Bcl2 phosphorylation could be detected even in the presence of high concentrations of staurosporine (up to 1000 nm) that would be expected to inhibit PKC (8Ito T. Deng X. Carr B. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11671-11673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). The presence of another Bcl2 kinase(s), in addition to PKCα, may reflect a mechanism by which Bcl2 may be functionally phosphorylated by signal transduction pathways involving other protein kinases whose activities may intersect at Bcl2. This exciting possibility is currently being explored in the laboratory. Nevertheless, the findings presented here indicate the existence of a novel, previously unrecognized regulatory role for mitochondrial PKCα as a potential Bcl2 kinase involved in the direct phosphorylation of Bcl2 and suppression of apoptosis. The relative or absolute absence of mitochondrial PKCα may result in an inability to maximally phosphorylate Bcl2, which may render this prototypic antiapoptotic molecule nonfunctional, as previously reported (8Ito T. Deng X. Carr B. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11671-11673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Therefore, a mechanism whereby PKCα can directly phosphorylate Bcl2 may identify a promising target for the development of novel antileukemic strategies. Consistent with this notion, a recent study reported that high levels of expression of the PKCα and β classical isoforms in leukemic cells from patients with childhood acute leukemias may represent a risk factor for resistance to induction-remission chemotherapy (27Volm M. Zintl F. Edler L. Sauerbrey A. Med. Pediatr. Oncol. 1997; 28: 117-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Thus, if it can be demonstrated that the chemotherapy-resistant leukemic cells also contain relatively high levels of mitochondrial PKCα and phosphorylated Bcl2, one novel therapeutic strategy for translational research might involve the selective inhibition of PKCα and blockade of Bcl2 phosphorylation prior to institution of induction-remission chemotherapy.

In histone H4 and Cse4p mutants, the core centromere chromatin structure is disrupted at restrictive temperature. Overexpression of Cse4p suppresses this defect in the H4 mutant, implying that the two proteins act together in centromere structure. We show by chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments that Cse4p is specifically cross-linked to centromeric DNA. Furthermore, by immunofluorescence microscopy, Cse4p is found in discrete foci consistent with that expected for centromeres. These results suggest the kinetochore is assembled on a specialized centromeric nucleosome containing Cse4p."

On the other hand, HBx induces apoptosis in a p53-dependent manner and sensitizes cells to apoptosis by tumor necrosis factor (11Chirillo P. Pagano S. Natoli G. Puri P.L. Burgio V.L. Balsano C.

Leung S. Li X. Stark G.R. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1578-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 15Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3330) Google Scholar). Up to now, four members of the Jak family, including Jak1, Jak2, Jak3, and Tyk2, have been characterized. STAT proteins are a family of transcription factors of 90–110 kDa that are activated upon tyrosine phosphorylation by Jak kinase (14Leaman D.W. Leung S. Li X. Stark G.R. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1578-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 15Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3330) Google Scholar). Growth factor or cytokine treatment leads to the oligomerization of receptor subunits, and receptor-associated Jaks phosphorylate STATs recruited to the receptors by binding to the phosphotyrosine residues through their SH2 domains. In turn, activated STATs are dimerized or multimerized through their SH2 domains, transported into the nucleus, and then bind to the specific STAT-binding DNA sequences leading to the activation of various genes. Regulation of Jak-STAT is linked to various biological aspects like cell transformation, development, differentiation, apoptosis, etc. Previous reports have suggested that transformation by several oncogenes like src and abl accompanies the activation of the Jak-STAT signaling pathway (16Migone T.S. Lin J.X. Cereseto A. Muloy J.C. O'Shea J.J. Franchini G. Leonard W.J. Science. 1995; 269: 79-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar, 17Yu C.L. Meyer D.J. Campbell G.S. Larner A.C. Carter-Su C.

Science. 1995; 269: 1875-1877Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), and especially in the liver, the constitutive elevation of Jak-STAT signaling is associated with hepatocyte proliferation in response to growth factor/cytokine or partial hepatectomy (20Ruff-Jamison S. Chen K. Cohen S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4215-4218Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 21Cressman D.E. Diamond R.H. Taub R.

Insomuch as HBx is known to stimulate cell proliferation, and Jak-STAT is associated with the proliferation signal of liver cells, we tested the effect of HBx on Jak-STAT signaling pathway in liver cells. We demonstrate that HBx activates various STATs through the specific stimulation of Jak1 tyrosine kinase. Combined with the fact that HBx activates several growth factor-dependent signaling, including the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, and nuclear factor-κB pathways (7Benn J. Schneider R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10350-10354Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 8Benn J. Su F. Doria M. Schneider R.J. J.

Biol. 1997; 17: 6427-6436Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), the observed Jak-STAT activation establishes HBx as an “internal ligand” of the growth factor/cytokine-dependent signal transduction. The HBx expression plasmid, pcDNA-X, has been described (3Lee H. Lee Y-H. Huh Y-S. Moon H. Yun Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31405-31412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). pMFG-HBx, a retroviral expression plasmid, was constructed by subcloning the NcoI/BglII fragment of pcDNA-X into the NcoI/BamHI site of MFG-puro. Eight deletion mutants of HBx (XD1–XD8) were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis using pcDNA-X as the template. The mutant clones were selected by DNA sequencing, and the size of the translated product was confirmed by in vitro translation in the presence of [35S]methionine. Stable cell lines were obtained by Lipofectin-mediated transfection of a mouse hepatoma cell line, Hepa 1–6 with pMFG-HBx plasmid. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the medium was replaced with medium containing puromycin (1 μg/ml for Hepa 1–6). The candidate clones were analyzed by Western blot analysis using anti-HBx antiserum. Anti-HBx antiserum was obtained by immunizing two different keyhole limpet hemocyanin-conjugated HBx peptides into rabbits. The peptide sequences used for immunizations are LSAMSTTDLEAYFKDC (corresponding to amino acids 100–115 of HBx) and SPAPCNFFTSA (corresponding to amino acids 144–154 of HBx). These peptides were previously reported as highly immunogenic (24Moriarty A.M. Alexander H. Lerner R.A. Thornton G.B. Science. 1985; 227: 429-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were obtained first by Dounce homogenization of cell pellets in buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsufonyl fluoride) and a subsequent incubation in buffer B (5 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 26% glycerol, (v/v), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 300 mm NaCl) on ice for 30 min. The binding reaction was performed in a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1 mmMgCl2, 4% Ficoll, 50 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.02 mm EDTA, 8% glycerol, 2.5 μg of poly(dI-dC), 10 fmol of 32P labeled probe, and 5 μg of nuclear extracts. After incubation on ice for 30 min, samples were separated on a 4% polyacrylamide gel with 0.25 × TBE as buffer. The oligonucleotides used in EMSA were APRE (5′-GATCCTTCTGGGAATTCCTAGATC-3′), SIE (5′-AGCTTCATTTCCCGTAAATCCCTAAAGCT-3′), and Fos intragenic regulatory element (5′-GTCCCCGGCCGGGGAGGCGCT-3′). Exponentially growing Hepa-X and Hepa-puro cells were harvested and rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline. Cell extracts were prepared by incubating in radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mmphenylmethylsufonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin) for 30 min on ice. Immunoprecipitation was performed with anti-STAT or anti-Jak antibodies: STAT1 and -2 (UBI), STAT3 and -4 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), STAT5 (Signal Transduction Laboratory), Jak1 and -2, Tyk2 (UBI). After 4 h of incubation, the immune complexes were captured on protein A agarose, washed 3 times with wash buffer, and boiled for 5 min in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot. Western blots were probed with monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (UBI) or other antibodies using an ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For in vitro kinase assay, the immunoprecipitates of anti-Jaks were incubated in a kinase buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100) containing 30 μCi of γ-[32P]ATP and 400 pmol of unlabeled ATP for 30 min at 25 °C. One μg of SIE-Luc reporter was cotransfected with 1 μg of pcDNA-X or a series of mutant expression plasmids. Cells were incubated with DNA-Lipofectin for 20 h in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. After the addition of 0.5% serum, the cells were further incubated for an additional 20 h and harvested, and luciferase activity was measured. Insect Sf9 cells were maintained in TNM-FH media containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Dr. J. Ihle (St. Jude Children's Hospital) kindly provided the baculoviruses expressing Jak1 and Jak2. Forty-eight hours after infection with Jak1 or Jak2 baculovirus, cells were suspended in a buffer containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 50 mmNaF, 100 μm Na3VO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and disrupted by sonication. Insoluble fractions were cleared by centrifugation, and Jak1 or Jak2 protein was precipitated by anti-Jak1 or Jak2 antibody-bound protein A-agarose. Here we investigated the effect of HBx on the Jak-STAT signaling pathway. As a first step, we established stable cell lines expressing HBx in a constitutive manner. The expression construct pMFG-HBx is based on the retroviral vector pMFG (23Dranoff G. Jaffe E. Lazenby A. Golumbek P. Levitsky H. Brose K. Jackson V. Hamada H. Pardoll D. Mulligan R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3539-3541Crossref PubMed Scopus (2639) Google Scholar) and depicted in Fig. 1 A. pMFG-HBx was transfected into Hepa 1–6 mouse hepatoma cell line, and stable clones were selected in the presence of puromycin. As a negative control, parental pMFG-puro vector was transfected to generate Hepa-puro cell line. The expression of HBx in these stable clones was tested by Western blot analysis using antiserum raised against the synthetic peptides derived from HBx (24Moriarty A.M. Alexander H. Lerner R.A. Thornton G.B. Science. 1985; 227: 429-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 B, HBx was detected as a 17-kDa protein, and two clones, Hepa-X1 and Hepa-X2, were selected for further study. These two clones were maintained for several months without losing HBx expression. In contrast to the Hepa 1–6 case, the efforts to establish HBx-stable clones in human liver cell lines HepG2 and the Chang liver cell failed because of apparent cell death (data not shown). This result probably reflects the previously reported apoptosis phenomena of HBx (11Chirillo P. Pagano S. Natoli G. Puri P.L. Burgio V.L. Balsano C. Levrero M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8162-8167Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 12Su F. Schneider R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8744-8749Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 13Kim H. Lee H. Yun Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 381-385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). As a next step, we tested the possibility of HBx inducing the tyrosine phosphorylation of STATs, because the tyrosine phosphorylation of STATs is essential for their dimerization and activation (14Leaman D.W. Leung S. Li X. Stark G.R. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1578-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 15Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3330) Google Scholar). Generally, activated STATs show the reduced mobility in SDS-PAGE because of phosphorylation and translocate into the nucleus (14Leaman D.W. Leung S. Li X. Stark G.R. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1578-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 15Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3330) Google Scholar). Therefore, nuclear extracts of Hepa-puro and Hepa-X cells were subjected to Western analysis using antibodies against 5 different STATs including STAT1 through -5 (Fig. 2 A). Surprisingly, all 5 antibodies tested detected the appearance of bands with reduced mobility in Hepa-X cells reflecting the post-translational modification, probably resulting from the tyrosine phosphorylation of all 5 STATs tested by HBx. The band shift of the STAT5 case was most prominent. The tyrosine phosphorylation of STATs by HBx was further confirmed by immunoprecipitation-phosphotyrosine blotting experiments. As representative examples, STAT3 and -5 were immunoprecipitated from Hepa-X cells, and the tyrosine phosphorylation status was investigated by Western blot analysis with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (Fig. 2 B). As expected, the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 and -5 was constitutively elevated in Hepa-X cells indicating that HBx possesses the ability of inducing the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 and -5 in the liver cells. Even though we have not shown directly the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1, -2, and -4, it is most likely that these STATs are also phosphorylated upon expression of HBx because the retarded migration is observed for all five STATs (Fig. 2 A). The activation of multiple STATs may explain part of the pleiotropic functions of HBx in liver cells. In the liver, three members of the Jak kinase, Jak1, Jak2, and Tyk2, are present (14Leaman D.W. Leung S. Li X. Stark G.R. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1578-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 15Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3330) Google Scholar). To determine the upstream events leading to the activation of STATs, we tested whether any of the Jak kinase members are involved in the signaling by HBx. Immunoprecipitation of Jak1/Jak2 and subsequent Western blot analysis with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody revealed that the tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak1, but not that of Jak2, is specifically enhanced in Hepa-X cells (Fig. 3 A, left panel). Western analysis of the same immunoprecipitate with anti-Jak1 antibody detected an approximately equal intensity of the signal in both control and Hepa-X cells (Fig. 3 A, right panel) ruling out the possibility that the increased tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak1 by HBx is because of the change in the protein level of Jak1. Of note is that, in addition to the approximately 130-kDa bands representing Jak, additional phosphoprotein bands of >200 and 90 kDa are detected at a low stringency immunoprecipitation condition (Fig. 3 A, left panel). As previously reported (25Lutticken C. Wegenka U.M. Yuan J. Buschman J. Schindler C. Ziemiecki A. Harpur A.G. Wilks A.F. Yasukawa K. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Barbieri G. Pellegrini S. Sendtner M. Heinrich P.C. Horn F. Science. 1994; 263: 89-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar), these associated bands may represent the Jak1- associated proteins, potentially the receptors or STATs. Insomuch as tyrosine phosphorylation of Jaks was shown to result in the increased kinase activity, we investigated whether the expression of HBx enhances the in vitro kinase activity of Jak1 (Fig. 3 B). Jak1, Jak2, and Tyk2 were immunoprecipitated, incubated with γ-[32P]ATP, and the autophosphorylation was assayed as an indicator of kinase activity. We observed that the autophosphorylation of Jak1 was specifically enhanced in Hepa-X cells compared with the control, whereas those of Jak2 and Tyk2 were not altered. Based on the above results, we conclude that HBx induces the tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak1 leading to the enhancement of Jak1 tyrosine kinase activity and subsequent phosphorylation of multiple STATs. Previously, viral transforming proteins like Src or Abl were shown to activate the STAT pathway through direct interaction with Jak kinase (18Danial N.N. Pernis A. Rothman P.B. Science. 1995; 269: 1875-1877Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 19Campbell G.S., Yu, C.-L. Jove R. Carter-Su C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2591-2594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). To define the mechanism for the HBx-mediated Jak1 activation, we tested the possibility of interaction between HBx and Jak1. HBx was prepared byin vitro translation in the presence of [35S]Met (Fig. 4, left panel). Jak1 and Jak2 proteins were expressed using the baculoviruses kindly provided by Dr. J. Ihle (26Quelle F.W. Thierfelder W. Witthuhn B.A. Tang B. Cohen S. Ihle J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20775-20780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The Sf9 cell lysates were prepared and subjected to immunoprecipitation with Jak1 or Jak2 antibody, and protein A-agarose-bound Jak1 or Jak2 proteins were incubated with in vitro translated HBx. Subsequently, protein A-bound fractions were washed with buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and exposed to x-ray film. As shown in Fig. 4, right panel, the HBx band was specifically coprecipitated with Jak1 protein but not with Jak2. Based on these results, we propose that HBx stimulates the Jak1-STAT pathway through protein to protein interaction with Jak1. The observed tyrosine phosphorylation of STATs led us to test the effect of HBx on STAT-dependent transcriptional activation and DNA binding. The transcriptional activation was assayed in heterologous, human hepatoma cell line HepG2 to test whether the observed STAT activation by HBx is extended to liver cell lines other than Hepa 1–6 (Fig. 5 A). The reporter SIE-Luc and its mutant version, mSIE-Luc, were described previously (27Brunn G.J. Falls E.L. Nilson A.E. Abraham R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11628-11635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and contain 3 repeats of SIE or mutant SIE, respectively. When SIE-Luc was transiently cotransfected with the HBx expression plasmid pcDNA-X, approximately a 4-fold activation of luciferase activity was observed compared with the negative control. The epidermal growth factor treatment of Hepa-puro cells used as a positive control resulted in 7-fold activation. On the other hand, mutant SIE (mSIE)-driven reporter activity was not elevated by the coexpression of HBx, indicating that HBx specifically activates STAT-dependent transcription activation. In addition, these results suggest that STAT activation is not limited to Hepa 1–6 cells and is not caused by the secondary effect introduced during the establishment of Hepa-X stable cells. Insomuch as STAT is known as a DNA-binding transcription factor, we tested the effect of HBx on the DNA-binding activity of STATs by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (Fig. 5 B). Nuclear extracts were prepared from the control Hepa-puro and Hepa-X cells and incubated with a labeled APRE probe, which has been shown to bind STAT3 (28Zhong Z. Wen Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1994; 264: 95-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (1678) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5 B, the APRE-binding activity was enhanced by approximately 4-fold in Hepa-X cells. The observed DNA-binding complex was specifically competed by the 100-fold excess of unlabeled APRE but not by an unrelated Fos intragenic regulatory element. Moreover, the addition of anti-STAT3 antibody led to the appearance of a supershifted band indicating that the constitutive enhancement of DNA-binding activity in Hepa-X cells is attributable to STAT proteins. Next, to control the effect of wild type HBx and also to map the domain responsible for the STAT activation, we generated a series of HBx deletion mutants (Fig. 6 A) and tested the effects of these mutants on SIE-Luc reporter activity (Fig. 6 B). Except for the deletions in the N- (XD1) or C-terminal (XD8) region, all of the internal deletions of HBx resulted in the reduced activation of STAT-dependent transcription, suggesting that a relatively broad, central region of HBx is responsible for STAT activation. Perhaps these internal deletions of HBx alter the conformation of HBx necessary for the interaction with Jak1. The domain necessary for STAT-dependent transcriptional activation is overlapped with the previously identified transcriptional activation domains of HBx (29Kumar V. Narayana J. Kumar R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5647-5652Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 30Murakami S. Cheong J.H. Kaneko S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15118-15123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) except for the difference in the XD2 case. These domain mapping results suggest that a certain cross-talk may exist in the activation mechanism of HBx. In this report, we have shown that HBx interacts with Jak1-tyrosine kinase leading to the activation of the Jak1-STAT signaling pathway. However, the exact mechanism through which HBx activates Jak1 needs further investigation. Insomuch as HBx can form a dimer (30Murakami S. Cheong J.H. Kaneko S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15118-15123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), HBx dimerization might bring associated Jak1 molecules into close proximity allowing cross-phosphorylation and autoactivation, which in turn leads to the activation of multiple STATs. The full activation of STATs requires serine phosphorylation in addition to tyrosine phosphorylation (28Zhong Z. Wen Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1994; 264: 95-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (1678) Google Scholar). Considering that HBx activates serine/threonine kinases like mitogen-activated protein kinase and Jun-N-terminal kinase (7Benn J. Schneider R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10350-10354Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 8Benn J. Su F. Doria M. Schneider R.J. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4978-4985Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we do not exclude the possibility that HBx assists the activation of STATs through serine phosphorylation in addition to tyrosine phosphorylation (31Wen Z. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1995; 82: 241-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1724) Google Scholar). Recently, Klein and Schneider (10Klein N.P. Schneider R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6427-6436Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) reported that HBx activates Src kinase, and this event is linked to HBx-mediated Ras pathway activation. Because Src is known to activate Jak1 and STAT3 (17Yu C.L. Meyer D.J. Campbell G.S. Larner A.C. Carter-Su C. Schwartz J. Jove R. Science. 1995; 269: 81-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar, 19Campbell G.S., Yu, C.-L. Jove R. Carter-Su C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2591-2594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), there is a possibility that HBx-mediated activation of Src and Jak/STAT is closely related. However, in the Hepa-X cell system, we could not detect any enhancement of Src tyrosine phosphorylation by HBx (data not shown). Although this might be a cell type-specific phenomenon, at least we propose that Jak-STAT activation in Hepa-X cells is not a result of Src activation. Importantly, HBx-mediated Jak-STAT activation may explain the promiscuous actions of HBx as a viral transactivator. The observed Jak1-STAT activation, in combination with the fact that HBx also activates the serine/threonine kinase pathway through the activation of Ras and Src (7Benn J. Schneider R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10350-10354Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 10Klein N.P. Schneider R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6427-6436Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), establishes that HBx behaves like a typical growth factor and acts at the membrane proximal level. As reported previously, activated Jak1 may recruit a number of molecules, including STATs, Shc, and Raf (33Barinaga M. Science. 1995; 269: 1673Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 34He T.C.

In addition, activated STAT3 can act as an adaptor protein, recruiting phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase to the receptor complex (37Pfeffer L.M. Mullersman J.E. Pfeffer S.R. Murti A. Shi W. Yang C.H. Science. 1997; 276: 1418-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Therefore, activation of Jak1 thereby mediates multiple impacts of HBx on cytoplasmic signaling pathways as well as on nuclear transcriptional events. The finding in this report establishes hepatitis B virus as the first example of a transforming DNA virus, the gene product that activates the Jak/STAT signaling pathway. Up to now, Jak/STAT activation was limited for some oncogenic retroviruses like v-src, v-abl, and human T-cell lymphotrophic virus (16Migone T.S. Lin J.X. Cereseto A. Muloy J.C. O'Shea J.J.

The activation of the Jak/STAT-signaling pathway may contribute to the transforming potential of HBx, even though the role of Jak/STAT signaling in mitogenesis is still under debate. Cumulating evidence indicates that the Jak/STAT pathway is activated in the transformed cell (16Migone T.S. Lin J.X. Cereseto A. Muloy J.C. O'Shea J.J. Franchini G. Leonard W.J.

In cytokine-growth factor signaling, activated Jaks tyrosine phosphorylates shc or raf, which in turn activates the Ras-Raf-mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. Perhaps previously reported Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase activation by HBx may be mediated through Jak/STAT. Taking this information together, we propose that the HBx-mediated Jak-STAT activation contributes at least in part to the development of hepatocellular carcinoma. In addition to the potential role in transformation, HBx-mediated Jak/STAT activation may be linked to a variety of pathogenic phenomena caused by the infection of the hepatitis B virus. For example, constitutive activation of STAT3 leads to the dysregulation of the interleukin-6 gene, the main mediator of the acute phase response and liver cirrhosis (38Deviere J. Content J. Denys C.

Science. 1996; 274: 1379-1383Crossref PubMed Scopus (1291) Google Scholar). In conclusion, we found that the constitutive expression of HBx results in the activation of the Jak1/STAT signaling pathway, which may potentially provide the mechanism for promiscuous transcription activation by HBx, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Activation of Jak1/STAT by the viral transactivator may be a common strategy adopted by a number of viruses to exploit the host cell machinery.

The N-terminal region of the 230 kDa Drosophila TAFII (dTAFII230) binds directly to TBP and inhibits TBP binding to the TATA box. We report here the solution structure of the complex formed by dTAFII230 N-terminal region (residues 11–77) and TBP. dTAFII23011–77 comprises three α helices and a β hairpin, forming a core that occupies the concave DNA-binding surface of TBP. The TBP-binding surface of dTAFII230 markedly resembles the minor groove surface of the partially unwound TATA box in the TBP–TATA complex. This protein mimicry of the TATA element surface provides the structural basis of the mechanism by which dTAFII230 negatively controls the TATA box–binding activity within the TFIID complex."

The Rel/NF-κB family of dimeric transcription factors is ubiquitous in all human cell types. NF-κB regulates the expression of a variety of genes essential for cellular immune responses, inflammation, and growth and development (1Baeuerle P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4602) Google Scholar, 2Siebenlist U. Franzoso G. Brown K. Annu. Rev.

Transcriptionally active NF-κB dimers form through the combinatorial assembly of the five monomeric polypeptides, p50, p65, p52, c-Rel, and RelB. Each monomer shares an approximately 300-amino acid region known as the rel homology region (RHR).1Within the RHR of the NF-κB polypeptides are all of the amino acid residues required for subunit dimerization, specific DNA binding, and nuclear localization (2Siebenlist U. Franzoso G. Brown K. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 405-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (2016) Google Scholar, 3Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev.

Structure. 1997; 5: 1427-1436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) revealed that the 13 carboxyl-terminal amino acids containing the nuclear localization sequence (NLS) are not part of the dimerization domain of p50 and p65. The carboxyl-terminal NLS segments of p50 and p65 are not visible in the electron density maps and are presumably unstructured in solution. Subsequent crystal structures of the RHR dimers of p52 (7Cramer P. Larson C.J. Verdine G.L. Muller C.W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7078-7090Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), p65 (8Chen Y.Q. Ghosh S. Ghosh G. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 67-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), and p50/p65 (9Chen F.E. Huang D.B. Chen Y.Q. Ghosh G. Nature. 1998; 391: 410-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar) used smaller RHR versions that exclude the carboxyl-terminal 13 amino acids. These structures display folds similar to p50RHR. Together, these structures indicate that the RHR of the NF-κB transcription factors is composed of three mutually independent modules. 1) An amino-terminal domain, composed of roughly 200 amino acids, assumes an immunoglobulin-like tertiary fold and is primarily responsible for conferring DNA binding specificity. 2) The central dimerization domain, approximately 100 amino acids in length, also exhibits an immunoglobulin fold. 3) The NLS, composed of 13 residues at the carboxyl terminus, appears to be flexible in solution (Fig. 1 A, top panel). The nuclear translocation and DNA binding activities of the NF-κB proteins are inhibited through association with a member of the IκB family of transcription factor inhibitors (3Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5591) Google Scholar). A host of extracellular stimuli trigger various signal transduction cascades, which converge at the phosphorylation of IκBα or IκBβ in complex with a dimer of NF-κB (2Siebenlist U. Franzoso G. Brown K. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 405-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (2016) Google Scholar, 10Traenckner E.B. Pahl H.L. Henkel T. Schmidt K.N. Wilk S. Baeuerle P.A.

Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2723-2735Crossref PubMed Scopus (1665) Google Scholar). The phosphorylated IκB proteins become targets for ubiquitination and subsequent proteosome-mediated degradation (13Chen Z. Hagler J. Palombella V.J. Melandri F. Scherer D. Ballard D. Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1586-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (1172) Google Scholar). Free NF-κB dimers can then readily translocate the nuclear envelope and bind to their specific DNA target sites. An analogous mechanism for activation of transcription exists in Drosophila melanogaster development. The morphogen regulatory transcription factor Dorsal exists in an inactive cytoplasmic complex with its inhibitor, Cactus. These two proteins are structurally and functionally related to the NF-κB and IκB proteins, respectively (14Geisler R. Bergmann A. Hiromi Y. Nusslein-Volhard C. Cell. 1992; 71: 613-621Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 15Kidd S. Cell. 1992; 71: 623-635Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 16Steward R.

Members of the IκB family of proteins contain six to seven homologous copies of an approximately 33-amino acid sequence known as the ankyrin repeat (3Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev.

Science. 1998; 279: 1037-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) show that ankyrin repeats assume a unique structural scaffold in which a “finger-like” β-hairpin is projected from the core helix-turn-helix element. The ankyrin repeat domain of IκBα, consisting of six imperfect repeats, is preceded by a 70-amino acid amino-terminal segment and followed by a 42-amino acid carboxyl-terminal region (21Jaffray E. Wood K.M. Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2166-2172Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 A, bottom panel). The amino-terminal segment, referred to as the signal response domain (SRD), receives signals through the phosphorylation of serines at positions 32 and 36. The SRD is not known to play any role in NF-κB binding (11Brown K. Franzoso G. Baldi L. Carlson L. Mills L. Lin Y.C. Gerstberger S. Siebenlist U. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3021-3027Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Whiteside S.T. Ernst M.K. LeBail O. Laurent-Winter C. Rice N. Israel A. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1995; 15: 2809-2818Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The carboxyl-terminal segment is rich in proline, glutamic acid/aspartic acid, serine, and threonine residues (the PEST sequence). This PEST sequence is a common feature implicated in high turnover rate among short-lived proteins (24Rogers S. Wells R. Rechsteiner M. Science. 1986; 234: 364-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1963) Google Scholar). Partial or complete deletion of the acidic PEST region reduces the ability of IκBα to inhibit DNA binding of certain NF-κB dimers (25Ernst M.K. Dunn L.L. Rice N.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 872-882Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Leveillard T. Verma I.M. Gene Expr. 1993; 3: 135-150PubMed Google Scholar, 27Naumann M. Wulczyn F.G. Scheidereit C. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 213-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Other IκB family proteins also contain a similar domain structure, with the notable exceptions of p105 and p110, which contain NF-κB p50 and p52 sequences, respectively, at their amino termini. It is generally believed that the IκB proteins retain NF-κB in the cytoplasm by precluding the NLS of the NF-κB RHR from being recognized by the nuclear transport machinery (1Baeuerle P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4602) Google Scholar, 2Siebenlist U. Franzoso G. Brown K. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 405-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (2016) Google Scholar). In addition, studies have shown that one IκBα molecule interacts with one NF-κB dimer (25Ernst M.K. Dunn L.L. Rice N.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 872-882Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, it is not known whether the IκB proteins directly contact the NLS or mask it by steric hindrance (28Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1996; 87: 13-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2935) Google Scholar, 29Beg A.A. Ruben S.M. Scheinman R.I. Haskill S. Rosen C.A. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1899-1913Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has not been determined whether one or both of the NF-κB NLSs are involved in this process. One other intriguing property of IκBα is that in the post-induction stage, newly synthesized IκBα can enter the nucleus, where it is capable of dissociating transcriptionally competent NF-κB/DNA complexes (30Tran K. Merika M. Thanos D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5386-5399Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,31Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Thompson J. Rodriguez M.S. Bachelerie F. Thomas D. Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2689-2696Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It remains to be seen whether this inhibition of DNA binding activity of IκBα occurs through interaction with the DNA binding residues of NF-κB. There exists no clear evidence as to why the NF-κB p50/p65 heterodimer is preferentially recognized by IκBα over the p50, p65, or c-Rel homodimers. Furthermore, the role of the p50 subunit of the p50/p65 heterodimer in its interaction with IκBα is not known. Finally, it remains unclear what role, if any, the amino-terminal DNA binding domain of the NF-κB RHR plays in the NF-κB/IκB complex. Using fluorescence polarization competition experiments, we have determined the equilibrium dissociation constants of the complexes between NF-κB (wild type and mutant p50 and p65 homodimers and the p50/p65 heterodimer) and IκBα. We show that IκBα recognizes the NF-κB dimers with variable affinities. In binding to the heterodimer, IκBα directly contacts the NLSs of both subunits in addition to making contacts with the dimerization domains and the DNA binding loop L1 of the p65 subunit. We suggest that the mode of interaction between each of the NF-κB dimers and IκBα is similar and that the relative amounts of various NF-κB dimers and their affinities for IκBα are the determinants of their cytoplasmic retention. The cloning, expression, and purification of the NF-κB subunits and amino-terminal deletion mutants has been described previously (4Ghosh G. van Duyne G. Ghosh S. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1995; 373: 303-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar, 6Huang D.-B. Huxford T. Chen Y.-Q. Ghosh G.

Biol. 1998; 5: 67-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 9Chen F.E. Huang D.B. Chen Y.Q. Ghosh G. Nature. 1998; 391: 410-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). The purification of p50dd/p65ddNLS, the p50RHR/p65RHR heterodimer, and its derivatives was accomplished by unfolding and refolding of purified components (9Chen F.E. Huang D.B. Chen Y.Q. Ghosh G. Nature. 1998; 391: 410-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). In a second method, p50 and p65 have been coexpressed in Escherichia coli and purified as heterodimers. The full-length IκBα (residues 1–317) and IκBαΔSRD (residues 67–317) proteins were expressed as glutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusion proteins in a pGEX vector (Novagen). They were both purified in a similar manner. The clone was transformed into BL21[DE3] cells and induced with 0.1 mmisopropylthio-β-d-galactoside overnight at room temperature. After cell lysis by sonication, the crude lysate was loaded onto a reduced glutathione-Sepharose column, followed by a Q Sepharose column and finally a Superdex75 gel filtration column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The peak fractions were collected and stored at −80 °C. Untagged IκBαΔSRD (residues 67–317) and IκBαΔSRDΔPEST (residues 67–277) were cloned into a pET3a vector (Novagen) and purified as the GST-fusion proteins with the exception that the glutathione-Sepharose step was ignored. A 39-bp fluorescein labeled DNA was purchased from Yale University oligonucleotide synthesis facility. The DNA had the following sequence: 5′-fluorescein-GATCGCTGGGGACTTTCCAGGGAGGCGTGGCCTGAGTCC-3′. The HIV-κB target site is shown in boldface. The complementary strand was synthesized on a Cyclone Plus DNA synthesizer. After deblocking, the oligonucleotides were purified over a Q-Sepharose column. Peak fractions were pooled and concentrated. Equimolar concentrations of the sense and antisense strands were mixed and annealed. The BIAcore biosensor system allows the monitoring of macromolecular reactions in real time (32Jonsson U. Fagerstam L. Lofas S. Stenberg E. Karlsson R. Frostell A. Markey F. Schindler F. Ann. Biol. Clin. 1993; 51: 19-26PubMed Google Scholar). The BIAcore system, sensor chips CM5 (certified), the amine coupling kit, and the anti-GST binding kit were obtained from BIAcore, Inc. The buffer used for all experiments was 10 mm HEPES (pH7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 3.4 mm EDTA, and 0.005% (v/v) Surfactant P20. To immobilize IκBα, an anti-GST antibody was first immobilized on the chip surface via amine coupling using the kit provided by the sensor chip manufacturer. Next, GST-IκBα was injected across the surface, and approximately 350 response units were captured onto the surface by the antibody per binding experiment. Two GST-IκBα constructs were tested with similar results: GST-IκBαΔSRD and GST-IκBα. Various rel/NF-κB constructs were then injected across the chip surface, and binding was monitored. At the end of each run, the GST-IκBα and NF-κB were removed from the surface with 10 μl of 10 mm glycine at pH 2.2, leaving active antibody on the surface. Each surface was used multiple times. To detect nonspecific binding to the GST and the immobilized antibody, control runs were performed with only antibody on the chip surface and with GST immobilized via the antibody on the surface. No significant nonspecific binding was observed. All experiments were performed at 25 °C and at a flow rate of 40 μl/min. All sensorgrams reported have been blank subtracted for any bulk refractive index effects. All fluorescence polarization measurements were made using the Beacon 2000 Fluorescence Polarization System (PanVera Corp.). We used fluorescence polarization to determine the DNA binding affinities of several NF-κB dimers (33LeTilly V. Royer C.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7753-7758Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Serial dilutions of NF-κB were added to constant amounts of labeled DNA. The fluorescence polarization values were recorded once the system had reached equilibrium (approximately 50 min). All measurements were taken at 37 °C in 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5) and 50 mmNaCl. The fractional occupancy was calculated as described in Equation 1. K D was calculated as the concentration of NF-κB at 0.5 fractional occupancy, as follows,Fractional occupancy=P−PD/PND−PD(Eq. 1) where P is polarization in millipolarization units,P D is polarization of free DNA, and P ND is polarization of DNA saturated with NF-κB. In the presence of IκBα and DNA, NF-κB links two competing equilibrium processes (see Equation 2). If the dissociation constant of one process is known, the dissociation constant of the second process can be derived from a competition assay. This assay probes the shift in equilibrium of one reaction when in the presence of a competing inhibitor. Having characterized the affinity of NF-κB for a particular κB-DNA target site, we endeavored to determine its affinity for IκBα binding by a fluorescence polarization competition assay. To perform this competition assay, varying concentrations of IκBα were mixed with constant amounts of NF-κB and labeled DNA. The system was allowed to reach equilibrium (approximately 1 h). We observed an increase in polarization with increased IκBα concentration. This corresponds to the generation of free DNA in solution upon the addition of IκBα to the preformed NF-κB/DNA complexes. Control experiments were performed to check for any nonspecific DNA binding by IκBα. IκBα does not bind DNA even at extremely high concentrations (50 μm). The competition assay binding curves were analyzed for IC50values the concentration of IκBα at 0.5 fractional occupancy. TheK I value (the dissociation constant for the NF-κB/IκBα interaction) was derived using the following values according to Equation 5: the DNA binding affinity of NF-κB (K D), the IC50 value, [NF-κB]total, and [DNA]total, as follows,NF­κB+DNA ⇄ KD NF­κB/DNA+ IκB KI⇅KD=[NF­κB][DNA][NF­κB/DNA]PD−PP−PND=[NF­κB/DNA][DNA] NF­κB/IκB KI=[NF­κB][IκB][NF­κB/IκB](Eq. 2) where [NF-κB]total = [NF-κB] + [NF-κB/IκB] + [NF-κB/DNA], [DNA]total= [DNA] + [NF-κB/DNA], and [IκB]total = [IκB] + [NF-κB/IκB]. Solving for [NF-κB]total in terms of [NF-κB], [IκB]total, [DNA], KD, and KI yields the following expression,[NF­κB]total=[NF­κB]{(KI+[NF­κB])(KD+[NF­κB])+[IκB]total(KD+[NF­κB]+[DNA]total(KI+[NF­κB])}(KI+[NF­κB])(KD+[NF­κB])(Eq. 3) At the midpoint of the titration,[NF­κB]=KD and PD−PP−PND=1(Eq. 4) if [DNA]total and [NF-κB]total are constant and [IκB] is varied. Then, at the IC50 of the competition binding curve, the following holds true. KI=−2 KD2−2 KDIC50−[DNA]total KD+2 KD[NF­κB]total2 KD+[DNA]total−2[NF­κB]total(Eq. 5) For each NF-κB dimer, the K I values were calculated as an average of three individual experiments. Various ratios of [NF-κB]/[DNA] were tested, with similar results. There was less than a 20% error between individual experiments. All runs were performed in 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5) and 50 mmNaCl at 37 °C. 10% native polyacrylamide gels were prepared in 0.25× Tris borate EDTA. The gels were filtered and degassed. Individual or complexed proteins were prepared in 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 4% glycerol, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 50 mm NaCl. Reactions were allowed to reach equilibrium at room temperature for 1 h. Native gel loading buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 10% glycerol, and 1.25 mmβ-mercaptoethanol) was then added to each sample. The gels were run in 0.25× Tris borate EDTA for 1.5 h at 3 mA. To evaluate the contributions of the three segments within the RHR of NF-κB in complex formation with IκBα, a series of structure-based deletion mutants of the homodimers and of the heterodimer were prepared. Care was taken to ensure that the integrity of the three-dimensional fold of these mutants would remain intact. The flexible activation domain of p65, which follows the NLS, has been shown not to participate in the interaction with IκBα (3Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev.

All proteins have been expressed in E. coli and purified to near homogeneity, as shown in Fig. 1 C. We first determined the affinity of the wild type heterodimer (p50RHR/p65RHR) for the HIV-κB DNA using 0.1 nm labeled DNA and increasing amounts of the heterodimer. From the saturation binding curve, the equilibrium dissociation constant (K D) of the NF-κB p50/p65-κB DNA complex was observed as 4.7 nm (Fig. 2 A). We then performed a competition assay using the wild type p50RHR/p65RHR and IκBαΔSRD (IκBα with the amino-terminal signal response domain removed). These experiments show that IκBα binds the wild type heterodimer with an equilibrium dissociation constant (K I) of 3.0 nm (Fig. 2 A). In an effort to determine the contribution of the SRD of IκBα, we repeated the fluorescence polarization competition experiment using the full-length IκBα and IκBαΔSRD as glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins (GST-IκBα and GST-IκBαΔSRD). The inhibition curves resulting from the full-length GST-IκBα, GST-IκBαΔSRD, and IκBαΔSRD are nearly identical (Fig. 2 B). Further controls confirmed that GST does not interact nonspecifically with the NF-κB or the labeled DNA (data not shown). These results confirm that the SRD of IκBα does not contribute to binding of the NF-κB p50/p65 heterodimer. Therefore, we chose to use IκBαΔSRD in our assays for measuring the NF-κB/IκBα binding constants. We next investigated the role of the carboxyl-terminal acidic tail/PEST sequence of IκBα in the inhibition of DNA binding by the p50/p65 heterodimer. We performed the fluorescence polarization competition experiment previously described using a mutant IκBα with both the SRD and PEST sequence removed (IκBαΔSRDΔPEST). Even at a 150-fold excess of IκBαΔSRDΔPEST, only a slight decrease in the polarization was observed (Fig. 2 B). This result identifies the acidic tail/PEST sequence as the necessary element that confers DNA-inhibitory binding activity on IκBα. It is well understood that the nuclear localization of NF-κB dimers is mediated by the nuclear localization signals located at the carboxyl termini of the RHR. However, the exact mode of NLS masking by IκBα remains unclear. To delineate the role of NLSs of the NF-κB heterodimer, we have made three heterodimer variants in which the NLS is individually and doubly removed (p50RHR/p65RHRs, p50RHRs/p65RHR, and p50RHRs/p65RHRs,where s refers to the shortened RHR, with its NLS removed). As seen in Fig. 3 A, the mutant heterodimer with deleted p65 NLS (p50RHR/p65RHRs) has over 5-fold lower affinity for IκBα compared with that of the wild type heterodimer (K I ∼ 16.9 nm p50RHR/p65RHRsversus 3.0 nm p50RHR/p65RHR). On the other hand, p50RHRs/p65RHR binds IκBα with an affinity of 3.1 nm. When both the NLSs are removed, the heterodimer shows a 9-fold (K I ∼ 28.0 nm) defect compared with the wild type heterodimer (Table I). Clearly, the p65NLS is essential for IκBα binding. The role of the p50 NLS is not apparent from the p50RHRs/p65RHR binding profile, which looks similar to the wild type heterodimer. However, if the NLS of p50 was not involved in any contact with IκBα, we would expect the p50RHR/p65RHRs and the p50RHRs/p65RHRs binding profiles to be identical. The 1.6-fold defect in p50RHRs/p65RHRs binding affinity when compared with p50RHR/p65RHRs indicates that the p50NLS does in fact contribute to IκBα binding. Therefore, both the NLSs of p50 and p65 appear to be involved in direct interactions with IκBα. These results establish, for the first time, a specific role for the p50 subunit of the heterodimer in IκBα binding specificity. The p50 subunit is not, it seems, simply an inert participant in the complex formation by nature of its ability to dimerize with the p65 subunit.Table IKI and ΔG values calculated from the fluorescence polarization competition assaysDimerK IΔGnmkcal/molp50RHR/p65RHR3.0 ± 0.7−11.6p50RHRs/p65RHR3.1 ± 0.7−11.6p50RHR/p65RHRs16.9 ± 1.3−10.6p50RHRs/p65RHRs28.0 ± 2.3−10.3p50RHR/p65RHR(ΔL1)172.7 ± 25.9−9.2p65RHR/p65RHR82.1 ± 14.0−9.7p65RHRs/p65RHRs143.3 ± 11.2−9.3p50RHR/p50RHR181.3 ± 16.4−9.2p50RHRs/p50RHRs1518.3 ± 110.4−7.92Each K I value reported is an average of three individual experiments.

The K I values were calculated using the equations discussed under “Experimental Procedures.” The K D values (the DNA binding constants) of the various homo- and heterodimers were determined independently. In support of our results obtained from the fluorescence polarization competition assay, we have performed biomolecular interaction assays on wild type and shortened NF-κB proteins using BIAcore technology. The sensorgram shown in Fig. 3 B provides two important points: first, the nature of the interaction between the wild type heterodimer and IκBα is complex, and both the association and dissociation are multiphasic; and second, the p50RHRs/p65RHRs heterodimer is defective for IκBα binding when compared with the wild type heterodimer. The role of the p50NLS was further probed by using two truncated heterodimeric p50/p65 constructs, in which the amino-terminal domain of the p50 subunit was deleted (p50ddNLS/p65RHR and p50dd/p65RHR). As seen in Fig. 3 C, when the NLS of the p50 subunit is deleted (p50dd/p65RHR), the heterodimer becomes a poorer substrate for IκBα compared with the one with the NLS. Again, this result underscores the importance of the p50 NLS in IκBα binding. The involvement of the acidic tail of IκBα in the inhibition of DNA binding activity of NF-κB led researchers to speculate that the amino-terminal DNA binding domain of NF-κB is involved in contacting IκBα (30Tran K.

In order to investigate whether the amino-terminal DNA binding domain of p65 may be involved in interacting with IκBα, we constructed an NF-κB p50/p65 heterodimer in which a segment of 15 amino acids (residues 30–45 of p65) has been replaced by three glycine residues at loop L1 of p65. Four of the five residues that mediate direct DNA base-specific contacts, Arg33, Arg35, Tyr36, and Glu39 are located within this 15-amino acid segment. As expected, the mutant heterodimer binds to HIV-κB DNA with reduced affinity (237.8 nm). However, this affinity is high enough to perform the fluorescence polarization competition assay with IκBα. We were able to determine that IκBα binds to this mutant heterodimer with a KI of 172.7 nm (Table I). This indicates a 57-fold reduction in binding affinity compared with the wild type heterodimer, showing that the amino-terminal domain of the p65 subunit is involved in contacting IκBα. In vivo transfection followed by immunoprecipitation and qualitative DNA binding inhibition using a gel retardation assay showed that p65 homodimer can be retained in the cytoplasm by IκBα with high efficiency (25Ernst M.K.

We have now investigated the transcriptional regulation of the QR gene by antiestrogens. In transfection experiments employing the 5′-flanking (863-base pair) region of the human QR gene promoter with its electrophile/antioxidant response element (EpRE/ARE) or deleted or mutated constructs, we observe that antiestrogens induced an increase in QR gene promoter reporter activity in estrogen receptor (ER) negative breast cancer and endometrial cancer cells transfected with ER, and this induction by antiestrogens was repressed by estradiol. The stimulation of QR transcriptional activity required the 31-base pair electrophile-responsive region from the human QR gene promoter and a functional ER. Intriguingly, antiestrogens were stronger activators of the QR EpRE via the ER subtype ERβ than ERα. Oligonucleotide gel mobility and antibody shift assays reveal that the ER binds to the EpRE but is only a minor component of the proteins bound to the EpRE in ER-containing MCF-7 breast cancer cells. While binding of ERβ to the estrogen response element was weaker when compared with ERα, ERβ and ERα showed similar binding to the EpRE. Together these findings provide evidence that QR gene regulation by the antiestrogen-occupied ER is mediated by the EpRE-containing region of the human QR gene and indicate that the ER is one of the complex of proteins that binds to the EpRE. In addition, that ERβ is a more potent activator at EpRE elements than is ERα suggests that the different levels of these two receptors in various estrogen target cells could impact importantly on the antioxidant potency of antiestrogens in different target cells. These findings have broad implications regarding the potential beneficial effects of antiestrogens since EpREs mediate the transcriptional induction of numerous genes, including QR, which encode chemoprotective detoxification enzymes.

Phase 2 detoxification enzymes such as NAD(P)H:(quinone-acceptor) oxidoreductase (quinone reductase (QR)),1 glutathioneS-transferases (GSTs), epoxide hydrolase, and UDP-glucuronosyltransferases are induced in cells by electrophilic compounds and phenolic antioxidants (reviewed in Refs. 1Talalay P.

These widely distributed enzymes detoxify electrophiles, thereby protecting cells against the toxic and neoplastic effects of carcinogens. We have previously shown that increases in QR enzyme activity can be induced by low concentrations of antiestrogens in breast cancer cells (3Montano M.M. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2581-2586Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Induction of QR enzymatic activity showed unusual reversed pharmacology, being markedly up-regulated by antiestrogen and suppressed by estrogen in breast cancer cells. The electrophile response element (EpRE) motif has been identified in the regulatory region of the genes encoding QR and the GST-Ya subunit (GST-Ya) (4Favreau L.V. Pickett C.B. J. Biol.

Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2581-2586Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The human QR gene EpRE motif, unlike the EpRE in the rat QR gene and the GST-Ya gene, contains one copy of the perfect consensus sequence for AP1 binding (10Jaiswal A.K. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10647-10653Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Although band shift assays with the rat GST-Ya gene EpRE indicate that the major EpRE-interacting and -activating protein is not AP1 (12Favreau L.V. Pickett C.B. J. Biol.

Chem. 1992; 267: 13535-13539Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), band shift assays with the human QR gene EpRE and hepatoma cell extracts indicate a complex that was specifically competed by the 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) response element (TRE) (9Xie T. Belinsky M. Xu Y. Jaiswal A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6894-6900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The antiestrogen regulation of quinone reductase enzymatic activity represents a potentially important pharmacological mechanism for this group of anticancer drugs that had not been previously recognized. Thus, studies, now reported here, were conducted to further dissect the molecular mechanism(s) involved in antiestrogen induction of QR activity. Portions of the human QR gene promoter and 5′-flanking region including the EpRE-containing region were transfected into ER-negative breast cancer and endometrial cancer cells, and we show that the ER and the EpRE-containing region are responsible for mediating its antiestrogen responsiveness. We assess the response to various ligands in the presence of the ER subtypes, ERα or ERβ, and compare antiestrogen activation via ERα or ERβ at an EpRE site. Gel shift assays suggest that antiestrogen-mediated induction of QR gene transcriptional activity in MCF7 cells involves a direct transcriptional effect where both ERα and ERβ are components of the protein complex that binds the EpRE. These studies have broad implications regarding potential antiestrogen regulation of a variety of genes whose transcription is under the control of electrophile/antioxidant response elements.

In vitrotranscription and translation of the ERα was performed using the Promega TNT kit (Madison, WI). Briefly, 1 μg of ERα-BSII-SK+ (or ERα cDNA in pBluescript II SK+ vector; see Ref. 20Montano M.M. Ekena K. Krueger K.D. Keller A.L. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Mol.

For control lysates, pBluescript II SK+ vector lacking the ER cDNA was used in place of ER-BSII-SK+ in the reaction. The final reaction of 50 μl was incubated for 90 min at 30 °C. The translation efficiency of ERα and ERβ was checked by adding 4 μl of [35S]methionine (15 μCi/μl; ICN, Costa Mesa, CA) in parallel reactions and analyzing 1 μl of the lysate by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Nuclear extracts from MCF7 cells for use in the gel shift assays were prepared as described previously (21Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K.

The resultant double-stranded oligomer was gel-purified on a nondenaturing 10% polyacrylamide gel run in 0.5× TBE. The ability of extract protein(s) to bind to the EpRE was analyzed using standard gel mobility shift assays. Briefly, 2 μl (∼5 μg) of MCF7 nuclear extract was mixed with 1 ng of end-labeled EpRE oligomer or ERE in the presence of 0.4 μg/μl poly(dI-dC), 20 mm HEPES, 200 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, 1 μg/μl bovine serum albumin, 2.5% CHAPS and incubated at room temperature for 20 min. In gel shift assays where in vitrotranslated ER was used, 1 μl of the reticulocyte lysate containing translated ER was used in place of nuclear extracts. The specificity of binding was assessed by competition with excess unlabeled double-stranded EpRE or ERE, as well as with excess unlabeled double-stranded oligomers containing the consensus TRE (5′-CGC TTG ATG AGT CAG CCG GAA-3′) or mutated ERE (5′-AGC TAG TCA GAG CAC AGT GGA CTG ATC-3′) sequence. The nondenaturing gels used to analyze the protein-DNA complexes were run as described previously (22Kraus W.L. Montano M.M. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Mol.

The Flag antibody M2 was obtained from Sigma. As shown in Fig. 1, QR mRNA expression is markedly induced in ER-containing MCF7 breast cancer cells briefly exposed to the antiestrogens TOT and ICI 182,780. Although several QR mRNA species have been reported in certain cell lines, we were able to detect only one 2.7-kilobase mRNA species in MCF7 cells (Fig. 1). The 2.7-kilobase mRNA species corresponds to the most abundant and dioxin-inducible mRNA species detected in HepG2 hepatoma cells (23Jaiswal A.K. McBride O.W. Adesnik M. Nebert D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13572-13578Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A 4.2- and 1.9-fold increase in QR mRNA was detected in cells treated with the antiestrogens TOT and ICI 182,780 for 24 h, respectively. No increase in QR mRNA levels was evident in cells treated with the estrogen estradiol (E2; Fig. 1); E2 even appeared to slightly reduce the control level of QR mRNA in the cells. As expected for an estrogen receptor (ER)-mediated process, cotreatment with E2 diminished the TOT-induced increase in QR mRNA levels. The regulation of QR mRNA by estrogens and antiestrogens correlates well with the previously reported changes in QR enzymatic activity observed after treatment with these ligands (3Montano M.M. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2581-2586Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). To examine the possible transcriptional regulation of the QR gene by antiestrogen, a reporter construct that contains the 863-base pair 5′-flanking and promoter regions of the human QR gene upstream of the CAT gene (Fig. 2) was introduced into an ER-negative breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-231 cells. In cells cotransfected with an expression vector for the wild type ERα, TOT induced an increase in pNQO1-CAT 0.863 reporter activity (Fig. 3, left). E2inhibited the TOT-mediated, but not the TBHQ-mediated, increase in QR transcriptional activity. No increase in CAT activity was evident in cells after treatment with TPA, a known inducer of AP1 activity (24Piette J. Hirai S,. Yaniv M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cells that were co-transfected with the control expression vector lacking the ER cDNA (pCMV5), with an expression vector for a mutant ERα that has impaired activation function-2 activity (S554fs), or with an expression vector for a mutant ERα that has impaired DNA binding ability (DBDmut) did not show activation from pNQO1-CAT 0.863 in response to antiestrogens (Fig. 3), although the effect of TBHQ was still observed. Thus, antiestrogen-mediated activation of QR gene promoter activity requires a transcriptionally active ERα. Treatment with either TOT or TBHQ did not induce transcription from a deletion mutant of the pNQO1-CAT 0.863 reporter construct, denoted pNQO1-CAT-0.365, that lacks the base pair −366 to −863 portion of the 5′-flanking region (Fig. 3, right). As expected (10Jaiswal A.K. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10647-10653Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), this truncated construct has reduced basal promoter activity. Our results indicate that the region between kilobase pairs −0.863 and −0.365 of the QR gene is essential for induction by both TOT and TBHQ.Figure 3Antiestrogen induction of pNQO1-CAT reporter gene activity in estrogen receptor negative cells is mediated by the estrogen receptor.

Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10647-10653Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The EpRE motif (shown in Fig. 6) contains a TRE and a TRE-like element (see Fig. 2). The EpRE-containing region was introduced upstream of a heterologous promoter, thymidine kinase, and the CAT gene. Although this EpRE-containing construct showed significant basal CAT activity in 231 cells, TOT and TBHQ were able to induce transcription 2.2- and 3.4-fold, respectively, over basal levels (Fig. 4, left). Mutation of the perfect TRE element (middle portion of Fig. 4) reduced basal CAT activity and eliminated induction by TBHQ and TOT. Mutation of the TRE-like element (right portionof Fig. 4) also reduced basal activity and eliminated the TBHQ- and TOT-induced increase in QR gene transcriptional activity. TPA, which increases AP1 activity, did not induce an increase in EpRE-mediated CAT gene expression of the wild type (unmutated) gene construct in these cells (left portion of Fig. 4). This observation does not appear to be due to the absence of AP1 activity, because we have previously shown that TPA induced TRE-mediated CAT reporter gene activity in 231 cells (3Montano M.M.

ERβ exhibits lower transcriptional response to estradiol and TOT when compared with ERα in the context of several ERE-containing gene reporter constructs (16Mosselman S. Polman J. Dijkema R.

Science. 1997; 277: 1508-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (2062) Google Scholar). However, ERβ has been reported to show increased TOT agonism from reporter constructs containing an AP1 site (27Paech K. Webb P. Kuiper G.G. Nilsson S. Gustafsson J. Kushner P.J. Scanlan T.S. Science. 1997; 277: 1508-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (2062) Google Scholar). We thus were interested in examining ligand activation of ERβ and ERα from an EpRE, as compared with activation from an ERE. With a reporter construct containing EREs upstream of the promoter for the estrogen-regulated pS2 gene (Fig. 5 A), ERα and ERβ both showed stimulation by the estrogen, estradiol, and as expected, ERβ showed a lower transcriptional response. Interestingly, ERα was weakly stimulated by the antiestrogen TOT and by another antiestrogen, LY 117018 (LY) at this ERE-containing gene construct, whereas the antiestrogens failed to elicit ERβ transcriptional activity at this ERE-containing gene (Fig. 5 A). The transcriptional response of ERβ and ERα to these ligands was very different in the context of the QR gene promoter construct pNQO1-CAT 0.863. Of note, although antiestrogens stimulated QR activity via both ERα and ERβ, the magnitude of increase in QR gene transcriptional activity in response to TOT or LY 117018 was higher with ERβ than with ERα (Fig. 5 B), and no stimulation by estradiol was observed via ERβ or ERα at an EpRE. The antiestrogen-mediated increase in QR mRNA levels might occur through an ER-mediated transcriptional effect that could involve the binding of ER to the EpRE. Thus, gel shift assays (Fig. 6) were conducted to determine if the ER is part of the transcriptional complex that binds to the EpRE. Fig. 6 A shows the nucleotide sequence of the −476 to −437 EpRE motif from the QR gene and the ERE oligonucleotide containing one consensus ERE. The DNA-protein complexes detected in TOT-treated cells by gel shift assays with this ERE oligonucleotide were not different from complexes detected using nuclear extracts from untreated MCF7 cells (data not shown). Previous reports also indicate no detectable differences in protein-EpRE interactions using TBHQ-treatedversus untreated nuclear extracts from HepG2 cells (13Nguyen T. Pickett C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13535-13539Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Gel shift assays (Fig. 6 B) with the radiolabeled EpRE and nuclear extracts from MCF7 cells treated with antiestrogens revealed a shifted complex that was specifically competed by unlabeled EpRE (Fig. 6 B, lane 3) and by high concentrations (200× but not 50×) of ERE (lane 4 versus lane 6) but not by excess unlabeled TRE (lane 5), mutated ERE (lane 7), or mutated EpRE (mut 1 ormut 2 of Fig. 2; data not shown). Unlabeled EpRE was a more effective competitor than was unlabeled ERE (compare lanes 3 and 6 with a 50-fold excess of EpRE or ERE). These observations may reflect the fact that a portion of the EpRE (−465 to −453) resembles an ERE. All nucleotides from −465 to −453 of the EpRE are identical to the ERE (underlined nucleotides), except for the outermost 5′ and 3′ nucleotides (positions −465 and −453), where a different purine or a different pyrimidine is found, respectively. Therefore, at a sufficiently high concentration, the ERE oligonucleotide may be able to displace the EpRE from proteins that normally bind to it. A consistently observed but light supershifted band (SSB) was evident in the presence of a monoclonal antibody to the ER (lane 8). However, there are other proteins that interact with the EpRE and are not shifted by ER antibody. To further verify the binding of the ER to the EpRE, gel shift assays were also performed using unlabeled in vitro translated ER (Fig. 6 C). A DNA-protein complex was observed that was competed out by unlabeled EpRE (50×) or ERE (200×) (Fig. 6 C, lanes 4–6). Moreover, this complex was supershifted with ER antibody (Fig. 6 C, lane 7). This specific band was not seen with control lysate (ivt-CTRL, lanes 8–10) from in vitro transcription-translation reaction with the vector lacking the ER cDNA, confirming that the band observed in lane 4 can be attributed to ER binding to the radiolabeled EpRE. The major protein complex detected (lane 4) migrated similarly to the major DNA-protein complex detected in gel shift assays where 32P-ERE was used as the DNA template for binding of in vitro translated ER (lane 11). This 32P-ERE-protein complex was fully competed with excess radioinert ERE (lane 12) and was supershifted with ER antibody (lane 13). Thus, together with the results presented in Fig. 6 B, these gel shift assays indicate that the ER binds to the EpRE and is one of several proteins that interacts with the EpRE. The binding of ER to the EpRE appears to be much weaker than its binding to the ER, since equal cpm and ng amounts of radiolabeled32P-EpRE and 32P-ERE were used in the binding reactions, and the DNA-ER complex is much less intense with the32P-EpRE oligomer (Fig. 6 C). Because of higher transcriptional activation of the QR gene by ERβ when compared with ERα (as seen in Fig. 5 B), we examined the DNA binding ability of ERα and ERβ to the EpRE. For these experiments, we used Flag epitope-tagged ERβ. Our gel shift assays, using 32P-labeled EpRE or 32P-labeled ERE and nonradiolabeled ERα or ERβ prepared by in vitrotranscription and translation (Fig. 7), indicate that although ERβ showed much weaker binding with the ERE when compared with ERα, ERβ binding to the EpRE was comparable with that observed with ERα (Fig. 7). The presence of ERα and ERβ in the DNA-protein complex is indicated by the supershifted bands observed in the presence of ER antibody H222 or Flag antibody M2, respectively. Thus, the higher transcriptional activation from the EpRE by ERβ as compared with ERα cannot be attributed to differences in the relative EpRE binding ability of ERβ and ERα but perhaps to receptor-type specific interactions with other protein factors in the EpRE transcriptional complex. Antiestrogens induce an increase in QR mRNA in breast cancer cells, and our studies indicate that the regulation of QR activity by antiestrogens occurs at the transcriptional level and is mediated by the ER and an EpRE element in the QR gene. Gel shift analyses reveal that the ER can bind to the EpRE. Therefore, the antiestrogen-mediated increase in QR activity may occur through a direct transcriptional effect by the ER when bound to antiestrogens and/or may involve antiestrogen-ER enhancing the activity of other factors that interact with the EpRE. In contrast to the observations made with antiestrogens, TBHQ-mediated induction of QR gene transcriptional activity did not require the ER and occurred equally well in the presence of functionally inactive ER or in the absence of ER altogether. However, the DNA elements required for antiestrogen-mediated induction of QR gene transcriptional activity that we identified through deletion and mutational studies mapped identically with the elements required for TBHQ-mediated induction. The TRE and the TRE-like element in the EpRE were required for antiestrogen and TBHQ-mediated induction. However, no increase in QR gene transcriptional activity resulted from TPA treatment, which induces the synthesis and/or activity of AP1 transcription factors (24Piette J. Hirai S,. Yaniv M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3401-3405Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Although antiestrogens have been reported to affect gene transcription through an AP1 site in some cell types (28Webb P. Lopez G.N. Uht R.M. Kushner P.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 443-456Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we were not able to induce an increase in CAT activity from TRE-containing reporter constructs in MCF7 cells after antiestrogen treatment (3Montano M.M. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2581-2586Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). We were also not able to compete out interactions between the EpRE DNA elements and MCF7 nuclear factors with excess amounts of consensus TRE oligonucleotide. Therefore, although the EpRE contains a perfect TRE and two TRE-like elements, the major EpRE binding and activating protein factors in MCF7 breast cancer cells are probably not the AP1 transcription factors. However, our studies do not preclude the possibility that AP1 transcription factors are involved in EpRE-mediated transcriptional regulation in other systems, as has been reported in Hepa-1 liver tumor cells (9Xie T. Belinsky M. Xu Y. Jaiswal A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6894-6900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Since the antiestrogen-estrogen receptor-mediated increase in QR gene expression might involve the direct binding of ER to the EpRE, we looked by gel shift analyses for proteins in MCF-7 cells that interact with the EpRE and, in particular, sought to determine whether ER is one of these proteins. We observed a strong gel shift and a conspicuous complex formed between MCF-7 cell proteins and radiolabeled EpRE. A shift of a minor portion of the radiolabeled EpRE-protein complex was observed with antibody to the ER, indicating that the ER was capable of interacting with the EpRE. This was also verified in studies utilizingin vitro transcribed and translated ER. A transcriptional effect is supported also by the requirement for ER DNA binding ability in the activation of the QR gene by antiestrogens (Fig. 3). This interaction may reflect, in part, the similarity in nucleotide sequence between the ERE and the human QR EpRE motif. But our studies also indicated that there are other proteins besides ER that interact with the EpRE and are not shifted by ER antibody in MCF-7 cells. Our observations are consistent with several reports showing that EpRE-mediated chemoprotective gene expression involves the interaction of multiple proteins with the EpRE regulatory site (12Favreau L.V. Pickett C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19875-19881Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Wasserman W.W. Fahl W.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5361-5366Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar, 30Venugopal R. Jaiswal A.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14960-14966Crossref PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar). The direct interaction of the ER with the EpRE also appeared to be weaker than the interaction of the ER with the ERE. Thus, a direct transcriptional effect of the ER mediated through the EpRE is possible, because we see some ER interaction with the EpRE, but this interaction appears to be weak when compared with the interaction of other protein(s) with the EpRE, and the ER is only one of several proteins bound there. Several aspects of antiestrogen regulation of QR transcriptional activity cannot be attributed solely to ER binding to the EpRE and remain to be investigated. This is especially true in light of 1) our previous observation that the time course of induction of QR enzyme activity is relatively slow (with increases in QR mRNA first detectable at 12–16 h after antiestrogen treatment of MCF7 cells; Ref.3Montano M.M. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2581-2586Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), 2) our previous observation that antiestrogen activation of GST-Ya gene transcriptional activity is mediated through an EpRE, which is not homologous to the ERE (3Montano M.M. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2581-2586Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), and 3) the observation in the present studies that the interaction of the ER with the EpRE is weak and that the EpRE interacts with additional proteins. Clearly, the regulation by antiestrogen-liganded ER may be also attributable to changes in the levels and/or the activity of other factors. The factors that interact with the EpRE are only now being characterized (4, 5 12, 29, 30) and highlight the likely complexity of EpRE-mediated gene regulation. An intriguing possibility is that antiestrogens, and not estrogens, might promote an interaction of the ER with protein activators of QR transcriptional activity. It is clear that ligand activation of ER transcriptional activity is highly dependent on the nature of the response element. Antiestrogen ligands (TOT, LY 117018), which induce very little activity from ERβ at an ERE, can induce significant activity from ERβ at an EpRE and, as previously reported, from a TRE (27Paech K. Webb P. Kuiper G.G. Nilsson S. Gustafsson J. Kushner P.J. Scanlan T.S. Science. 1997; 277: 1508-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (2062) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that ERβ regulates transcription from an AP1 site by a direct interaction with Fos and Jun. However, our studies suggest that transcriptional activation of the QR gene by TOT is not mediated through Fos and Jun. Our studies indicate that the differential transcriptional activation of the QR gene by ERα and ERβ does not directly correlate with their EpRE binding ability, since this appeared to be similar. This would be consistent with antiestrogen regulation of QR transcriptional activity not being determined only by ER binding to the EpRE, with ERβ perhaps interacting more effectively with other protein regulators of QR gene activity than does ERα. We have now observed antiestrogen-mediated activation of EpRE enhancer activity in various promoter contexts, the QR gene promoter (as shown in this study) and the GST-Ya gene promoter (3Montano M.M. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2581-2586Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), as well as in the context of a heterologous promoter, the thymidine kinase gene promoter (this study). The induction of QR gene transcriptional activity by antiestrogens was also evident in more than one cell context. It is of note that tamoxifen has been reported to induce an increase in the mRNA levels of other phase II detoxifying enzymes in rat liver (31Hellriegel E.T. Matwyshyn G.A. Fei P. Dragnew K.H. Nims R.W. Lubet R.A. Kong A.T. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1996; 52: 1561-1568Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). These findings raise the intriguing possibility that antiestrogens might regulate, in several cellular contexts, the activity of numerous proteins that contain EpREs in their regulatory regions and thereby afford substantial chemoprotective benefit to estrogen receptor-containing cells. This activation by antiestrogens may be modulated by differences in the relative levels of ERα and ERβ in different target cells and by additional promoter-specific elements, as observed for several steroid hormone-regulated genes (11Montano M.M.

In this study, we examined the requirement of dynamin-mediated endocytosis for insulin-dependent signal transduction events in 3T3L1 adipocytes using adenoviral expression of a dominant interfering K44A/dynamin mutant. Our data demonstrate that inhibition of clathrin-mediated endocytosis does not impair either insulin receptor signaling or insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation. However, it does inhibit the clearance of GLUT4 from the cell surface, both in the basal state and following insulin stimulation, suggesting that dynamin may function in the regulation of GLUT4 endocytosis. Chemical reagents were purchased from Sigma except protease inhibitors aprotinin, pepstatin, leupeptin, and Pefabloc purchased from Boehringer Mannheim, and as indicated. Antibodies were purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY) except polyclonal Akt1 (C20) antibody from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), Akt2 antibody generously provided by Dr. Morris Birnbaum (Philadelphia, PA), phospho-Akt and phospho-p44/42 MAP kinase antibodies from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA), and polyclonal antibody against rat GLUT4 (IA02) which was obtained by immunizing a rabbit with GLUT4 carboxyl-terminal peptide, SATFRRTPSLLEQEVKPSTELEYLGPDEND, conjugated to glutathioneS-transferase. 3T3L1 adipocytes (American Type Tissue Culture, Rockville, MD) were grown and differentiated as described previously (30Olson A.L. Knight J.B. Pessin J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2425-2435Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified essential media (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum for 1–2 days post-differentiation and then infected with recombinant adenovirus for 48 h, unless otherwise indicated. Prior to use, cells were washed 2 times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and serum-starved in DMEM with 0.1% bovine serum albumin for at least 2 h. The K44A/dynamin expressing recombinant adenovirus was constructed using the method of Becker et al. (31Becker T.C. Noel R.J. Coats W.S. Gomez-Foix A.M. Alam T. Gerard R.D. Newgard C.B. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 43: 161-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). The shuttle vector pACCMVpLpA and the modified adenovirus type 5 (Ad5) genome plasmid pJM17 were generously provided by Dr. Christopher Newgard (University of Texas, Southwestern, Dallas, TX). The cDNA for the K44A/dynamin (generously provided by Dr. Sandra Schmid, Scripps Institute, La Jolla, CA) was subcloned into pACCMVpLpA using 5′ BamHI and 3′ HindIII sites. The pACCMV-K44A/dynamin I and pJM17 were co-transfected into 80% confluent human embryo kidney (HEK) 293 cells by the calcium-phosphate method. Successful homologous recombination and production of Ad5-K44A/dynamin resulted in cell lysis within 14–21 days. Lysates were collected, subjected to several freeze-thaw cycles, and single clones of recombinant adenovirus isolated through agarose overlay of serial dilutions. Midscale stocks of virus were generated by infecting 10-cm plates of subconfluent HEK293 cells with 15 μl of the single plaque isolate lysate. Midscale stocks were used to infect subconfluent HEK293 cells for 1 h at 37 °C. Virus was removed, and fresh media were replaced and the cells allowed to incubate for an additional 36–48 h. Prior to complete lysis, the cells were harvested, subjected to several freeze-thaw cycles, and these concentrated lysates used for adipocyte infection as described previously (32Gnudi L. Frevert E.U. Houseknecht K.L. Erhardt P. Kahn B.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Transferrin receptor internalization was determined by measuring the amount of acid-dissociable prebound ligand as described by Lamb et al.(33Lamb J.E. Ray F. Ward J.H. Kushner J.P. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8751-8758Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thirty-five-mm dishes of infected 3T3L1 adipocytes were incubated with 125I-transferrin (3 nm; 1 μCi/μg, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 4 °C for 3 h. The media were changed to remove unbound ligand, and internalization was initiated by the addition of 37 °C DMEM. At the indicated times, endocytosis was terminated by washing cells 3 times with ice-cold PBS. Acid-dissociable cell-surface ligand was determined by pooling consecutive 8-min washes with 1.5 ml and 1.0 ml of stripping buffer (0.5 m NaCl, 0.2m acetic acid). Acid-washed cells were solubilized in 1% SDS, and the amount of internalized ligand was determined by quantitation of the amount of radioactivity using a Packard Auto-gamma 5000 Series gamma counter (Meriden, CT). 3T3L1 cell lysates were prepared by scraping the cells into Lysis Buffer (30 mm Tris or 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm NaF, 2 mmNa4P2O7, 1 mmNa3VO4, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride or 100 μg/ml Pefabloc) and incubating with rotation for 10 min at 4 °C. Insoluble material was pelleted by microcentrifugation for 10 min at 4 °C. Protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay Reagent, and the lysates were either subjected to immunoprecipitation or placed into gel loading buffer (final concentration 5% SDS, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, 62.7 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 0.003% bromphenol blue). Shc was immunoprecipitated from whole cell lysates by incubation with 4 μg of polyclonal Shc antibody for 2 h at 4 °C. The resulting immune complexes were precipitated by incubation with protein A-Sepharose for 1 h at 4 °C. Pellets were washed three times in wash buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 50 mm NaF, 1 mmNa3VO4), two times in Tris-buffered saline (25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl), resuspended in gel loading buffer, and boiled at 100 °C for 5 min. Whole cell lysates or immunoprecipitates were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (SDS-PAGE), transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) or nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell, Dassel, Germany), and Western blotted as indicated. Dynamin II and IRS1 levels were quantitated using Adobe Photoshop and NIH Image software. PI 3-kinase activity was determined as described by Turinsky et al. (34Turinsky J. Nagel G.W. Elmendorf J.S. Damrau-Abney A. Smith T.R. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with the IRS1 antibody followed by incubation with protein G+-agarose. The immunoprecipitated lipid kinase activity was assessed by incubation with 40 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) plus 20 μg of phosphatidylinositol (Avanti Polar Lipids, Birmingham, AL) for 15 min at room temperature. The phosphorylated lipids were separated by thin layer chromatography, visualized by autoradiography, and quantitated by scraping and counting the radiolabeled phosphoinositides. Akt protein kinase activity was determined as described by Moule and Denton (35Moule S.K. Denton R.M. Am. J. Cardiol. 1997; 80: 41-49Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Cell lysates were prepared and subjected to immunoprecipitation with a polyclonal Akt antibody. Protein kinase activity was assessed by incubation of the immunoprecipitates with 20 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and 0.5 mg/ml histone 2B (Boehringer Mannheim) for 20 min at 30 °C. The extent of histone 2B phosphorylation was determined by separation on a 16% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, autoradiography, and quantitation by excision of the radiolabeled band followed by scintillation counting. The amount of 32P incorporation was normalized for the amount of Akt immunoprecipitated as determined by densitometric scanning of Akt immunoblots. Uninfected and adenovirus-infected 3T3L1 adipocytes were serum-starved in DMEM with 0.1% bovine serum albumin for 2 h and stimulated with 100 nm insulin for 30 min at 37 °C. Insulin was removed, and cells were washed twice with acidic buffer (5 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0, 140 mm sodium chloride), twice with PBS, and fresh starvation media were replaced. GLUT4 was allowed to internalize at 37 °C for the indicated times, and then plasma membrane sheets were harvested by the method of Robinson et al. (13Robinson L.J. Pang S. Harris D.S. Heuser J. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1181-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were washed in ice-cold PBS and incubated for 30 s in ice-cold 0.5 mg/ml poly-l-lysine/PBS. The cells were then rinsed 3 times with 1/3× KHMgE buffer (1× concentration, 70 mm KCl, 30 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 3 mm EGTA), placed in 1× KHMgE buffer with 1 mmDTT and 0.1 mm PMSF, and sonicated for 5–10 s using a microtip at setting 4.8 on a 550 Sonic Dismembrator (Fisher). For immunofluorescence, plasma membrane sheets were fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Science, Ft. Washington, PA) for 20 min at room temperature, placed into quench buffer (100 mm glycine in PBS), and washed 3 times in PBS. The membrane sheets were blocked for 30 min at room temperature in 5% donkey serum/PBS, incubated for 1 h with the GLUT4 antibody, followed by a second 1-h incubation with a LRSC-donkey anti-rabbit antibody. The plasma membrane sheets were washed, coverslipped with Vectashield (Vector Labs, Burlington, CA), and viewed on a Bio-Rad laser confocal microscope. For immunoblotting, unfixed plasma membrane sheets were washed several times in KHMgE buffer and collected with a cell scraper into detergent-free Lysis Buffer (see above). Lysates were homogenized for 10 s on ice with a pellet pestle motor (Kontes, Vineland, NJ). The resultant membrane lysates were subjected to protein determination, placed into Laemmli sample buffer without heating, and immunoblotted as described above. Differentiated 3T3L1 adipocytes represent an excellent model system to study GLUT4 trafficking since they share many of the characteristics of primary adipocytes, including movement of GLUT4 from intracellular stores to the plasma membrane in response to insulin (36Rea S. James D.E. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1667-1677Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Stephens J.M. Pilch P.F. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 529-546PubMed Google Scholar). To examine the potential role of dynamin in insulin signaling and GLUT4 translocation, we initially examined the expression of dynamin during 3T3L1 adipocyte differentiation. By using a dynamin II-specific antibody, we observed a 6–9-fold increase in dynamin expression during differentiation of 3T3L1 fibroblasts into adipocytes (Fig. 1 A, lanes 1–4). The expression of clathrin heavy chain was not significantly affected by adipocyte differentiation (Fig. 1 B, lanes 1–4). In contrast, GLUT4 expression was highly induced following 3T3L1 adipocyte differentiation (Fig. 1 C, lanes 1–4). Previous studies have demonstrated that expression of a GTPase-deficient dynamin such as K44A/dynamin I in mammalian cells inhibits clathrin-mediated endocytosis by functioning in a dominant interfering manner over endogenous dynamin I or dynamin II proteins, whereas wild-type dynamin has no effect (26Herskovits J.S. Burgess C.C. Obar R.A. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 565-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar, 27van der Bliek A.M. Redelmeier T.E. Damke H. Tisdale E.J. Meyerowitz E.M. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 553-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar, 38Damke H. Baba T. Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 915-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar). Due to the difficulty of quantitatively transfecting 3T3L1 adipocytes by standard methods, we generated a recombinant adenovirus encoding K44A/dynamin I (K44A) and infected cells for 48 h. Dynamin expression, as assessed by a dynamin I/II antibody, was markedly increased in K44A/dynamin adenovirus-infected 3T3L1 adipocytes compared with uninfected cells or cells infected with a LacZ-encoding adenovirus (LacZ) (Fig. 2 A, top panel, lanes 1–3). Immunoblotting of these extracts with a dynamin II-specific antibody demonstrated no significant change in endogenous dynamin expression (Fig. 2 A, middle panel, lanes 1–3). Since dynamin II expression was unchanged, the increase in dynamin I/II protein levels was due to the expression of K44A/dynamin I. Insulin receptor β (IRβ) expression was also unchanged in K44A/dynamin expressing cells compared with uninfected or LacZ (Fig. 2 A, bottom panel, lanes 1–3). Under these conditions, greater than 95% of the cell population was infected with adenovirus with no observable changes in cell morphology by light microscopy (data not shown). Having demonstrated increased expression of K44A/dynamin, we next determined its effect on clathrin-mediated endocytosis. This was assessed by examining the internalization of the transferrin receptor in uninfected, LacZ-, and K44A/dynamin-infected 3T3L1 adipocytes (Fig. 2 B). In control adipocytes approximately 70% of the cell-surface transferrin receptor was internalized over a 60-min period (squares). Adenovirus infection slightly reduced the extent of transferrin receptor endocytosis, with approximately 60% internalized over the same time course (circles). In contrast, expression of K44A/dynamin resulted in only 30% of the cell-surface transferrin receptors being internalized with a significant decrease in initial rate of internalization compared with uninfected or LacZ-infected cells (triangles). Thus, increased expression of K44A/dynamin results in an inhibition of transferrin receptor internalization and therefore functions in a dominant interfering manner to reduce coated vesicle endocytosis in 3T3L1 adipocytes. Several studies have suggested that endosome localized insulin receptor provides the major pathway leading to insulin signal transduction and biological responsiveness (39Di Guglielmo G.M. Baass P.C.

Since expression of K44A/dynamin in other cells lines has been shown to interfere with signaling events downstream of the epidermal growth factor and β-adrenergic receptors (28Zhang J. Barak L.S. Winkler K.E. Caron M.G. Ferguson S.S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27005-27014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 29Vieira A.V. Lamaze C. Schmid S.L. Science. 1996; 274: 2086-2089Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar), we investigated the insulin receptor signaling characteristics in 3T3L1 adipocytes expressing K44A/dynamin. The dose response for insulin-stimulated insulin receptor β subunit tyrosine autophosphorylation was similar in uninfected, LacZ-, and K44A/dynamin-expressing cells (Fig. 3 A). In each case, autophosphorylation of the insulin receptor was not observed in the absence of or following stimulation with 0.1 nm insulin (Fig. 3 A, lanes 1, 2, 6, 7, 11 and 12). Insulin receptor autophosphorylation in response to 1 nm insulin remained low (Fig. 3 A, lanes 3, 8 and 13) but became more readily observable at 10 and 100 nm insulin (Fig. 3 A, lanes 4, 5, 9, 10, 14 and 15). In contrast, tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS1 was significantly more sensitive to insulin, reflecting downstream amplification of insulin receptor kinase activity (Fig. 3 B). Tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS1 was clearly discernible at 0.1 nm insulin (Fig. 3 B, lanes 1, 2, 6, 7, 11 and 12) and increased in a dose-dependent manner up to 100 nm insulin (Fig. 3 B, lanes 3–5, 8–10and 13–15). Relative to uninfected and LacZ-expressing cells, K44A/dynamin overexpression had only a minor effect on IRS1 tyrosine phosphorylation in response to varying doses of insulin (Fig. 3 B, compare lanes 1–5 with lanes 6–10 and lanes 11–15). Tyrosine phosphorylation of the 52-kDa Shc adapter protein in response to insulin was also unaffected by K44A/dynamin expression (data not shown). To examine downstream insulin receptor signaling pathways, we next determined the effect of K44A/dynamin expression on the ERK family of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases (Fig. 4). Uninfected, LacZ-, and K44A/dynamin-expressing cells exhibited essentially identical insulin dose-response patterns when immunoblotted with a phospho-specific ERK1/ERK2 antibody (Fig. 4 A, lanes 1–15). Similarly, the time dependence of insulin-stimulated ERK activation was unaffected by adenovirus-mediated expression of K44A/dynamin (Fig. 4 B, lanes 1–18). These data are consistent with Shc tyrosine phosphorylation providing the predominant pathway for the insulin activation of ERK1 and ERK2. In contrast to Shc, the IRS family of docking proteins is thought to provide the major pathways leading to the metabolic actions of insulin (43Yenush L. White M.F. BioEssays. 1997; 19: 491-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). As observed in Fig. 3, insulin stimulation of IRS1 tyrosine phosphorylation was slightly attenuated following expression of K44A/dynamin compared with uninfected and LacZ-expressing cells. To examine further the potential effect of decreased IRS1 tyrosine phosphorylation, we performed PI 3-kinase assays in IRS1 immunoprecipitates from LacZ- and K44A/dynamin-expressing cells. Following insulin stimulation, IRS1-associated PI-3 kinase was decreased 25% in K44A/dynamin-expressing cells relative to the LacZ-expressing cells (Fig. 5,A and B). Since maximal activation of the PI-3 kinase may not be required for full biological responsiveness to insulin, we further examined the ability of insulin to stimulate Akt kinase activity. Akt is a serine-threonine kinase involved in the metabolic actions of insulin whose activity appears to be dependent upon PI-3 kinase (44Kohn A.D. Takeuchi F. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21920-21926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar, 45Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C. Toker A.

Akt activation is associated with phosphorylation on serine and threonine residues resulting in a characteristic decrease in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic mobility. Relative to unstimulated cells, insulin caused an Akt gel shift in the uninfected and both LacZ- and K44A/dynamin adenovirus-infected cells (Fig. 6 A). When insulin-stimulated Akt protein kinase activity was directly measured, no significant difference was found between the LacZ- and K44A/dynamin-expressing adipocytes (Fig. 6 B). To confirm these findings, we also examined the insulin dose and time dependence of Akt activation by using a phosphoserine-specific Akt antibody and"

Recent cloning of a cDNA encoding the human cyclase indicated that genes encoding cyclase-like proteins are conserved among Eucarya, Bacteria, and Archaea. The protein encoded by the Escherichia coli gene was overexpressed and shown to have the RNA 3′-phosphate cyclase activity (Genschik, P., Billy, E., Swianiewicz, M., and Filipowicz, W. (1997) EMBO J. 16, 2955–2967). Analysis of the requirements and substrate specificity of the E. coli protein, presented in this work, demonstrates that properties of the bacterial and human enzymes are similar. ATP is the best cofactor (K m = 20 μm), whereas GTP (K m = 100 μm) and other nucleoside triphosphates (NTPs) act less efficiently. The enzyme undergoes nucleotidylation in the presence of [α-32P]ATP and, to a lesser extent, also in the presence of other NTPs. Comparison of 3′-phosphorylated oligoribonucleotides and oligodeoxyribonucleotides of identical sequence demonstrated that the latter are at least 300-fold poorer substrates for the enzyme. The E. coli cyclase gene, namedrtcA, forms part of an uncharacterized operon containing two additional open reading frames (ORFs). The ORF positioned immediately upstream, named rtcB, encodes a protein that is also highly conserved between Eucarya, Bacteria, and Archaea. Another ORF, called rtcR, is positioned upstream of thertcA/rtcB unit and is transcribed in the opposite direction. It encodes a protein having features of ς54-dependent regulators. By overexpressing the N-terminally truncated form of RtcR, we demonstrate that this regulator indeed controls expression of rtcA and rtcB in a ς54-dependent manner. Also consistent with the involvement of ς54, the region upstream of the transcription start site of the rtcA/rtcBmRNA contains the −12 and −24 elements, TTGCA and TGGCA, respectively, characteristic of ς54-dependent promoters. The cyclase gene is nonessential as demonstrated by knockout experiments. Possible functions of the cyclase in RNA metabolism are discussed.

Another ORF, called rtcR, is positioned upstream of thertcA/rtcB unit and is transcribed in the opposite direction. It encodes a protein having features of ς54-dependent regulators. By overexpressing the N-terminally truncated form of RtcR, we demonstrate that this regulator indeed controls expression of rtcA and rtcB in a ς54-dependent manner. Also consistent with the involvement of ς54, the region upstream of the transcription start site of the rtcA/rtcBmRNA contains the −12 and −24 elements, TTGCA and TGGCA, respectively, characteristic of ς54-dependent promoters. The cyclase gene is nonessential as demonstrated by knockout experiments. Possible functions of the cyclase in RNA metabolism are discussed. polymerase chain reaction any of the four (A, G, C, U) nucleosides nucleoside 3′-phosphates nucleotide 5′,3′-bisphosphates nucleoside 5′,2′-bisphosphates α,β- and β,γ-methylene analogs of ATP β,γ-imido analog of ATP adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate)adenosine 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid open reading frame reverse transcription base pair(s). The 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate termini are produced during RNA cleavage by many different endoribonucleases. For most of the known enzymes, among them many secretory degradative nucleases such as RNases A or T1, cyclic phosphates are formed as intermediates that are subsequently opened into 3′-phosphomonoesters (1Blackburn P. Moore S. Boyer P. The Enzymes. XV. Academic Press, New York1982: 317-433Google Scholar, 2Takahashi K. Moore S. Boyer P. The Enzymes. XV. Academic Press, New York1982: 435-468Google Scholar). For some enzymes, such as tRNA-splicing endonucleases from Eucarya and Archaea, the cyclic phosphate is a final product of the cleavage reaction (4Gandini-Attardi D. Margarit I. Tocchini-Valentini G.P. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 3289-3297Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 5Thompson L.D. Daniels C.J. J. Biol.

In addition, the type I topoisomerase has recently been shown to have endoribonuclease activity yielding 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate termini (7Sekiguchi J. Shuman S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 89-97Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Like some protein enzymes, ribozymes such as hammerheads, hairpins, or the hepatitis delta ribozyme generate 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate and 5′-hydroxyl ends during the RNA cleavage reaction (8Symons R.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 641-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). That the 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate has an anabolic function in RNA metabolism emerged when it was found that eukaryotic RNA ligases require 2′,3′-cyclic ends for RNA ligation (9Konarska M. Filipowicz W.

This requirement applies to both of the known non-organellar RNA ligases, one ligating RNA ends by the 3′,5′-phosphodiester, 2′-phosphomonoester linkage and the other joining the ends by the ordinary 3′,5′-phosphodiester (reviewed in Refs. 18Filipowicz W.

In addition, the ligase generating the 3′,5′-phosphodiester, 2′-phosphomonoester linkage functions in splicing the unusual intron present in HAC1pre-mRNA in yeast (27Sidrauski C. Cox J.S. Walter P.

Interestingly, the only known cellular RNA ligase in eubacteria, which joins RNA ends via the 2′,5′-phosphodiester, also requires 2′,3′-cyclic ends for ligation (32Greer C.L. Javor B. Abelson J. Cell. 1983; 33: 899-906Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar,33Arn E.A. Abelson J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31145-31153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Another finding uncovering a potential role for the 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate in RNA metabolism was the demonstration that the spliceosomal U6 snRNA in many organisms has a cyclic 2′,3′-phosphodiester at the terminus. The mechanism and enzymes responsible for this modification and its biological function are not known (34Lund E. Dahlberg J.E. Science. 1992; 255: 327-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 35Tazi J. Forne T. Jeanteur P. Cathala G. Brunel C. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 1997; 272: 21989-21993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In light of the importance of cyclic termini in RNA metabolism, it was interesting to discover that endonucleolytic cleavage is not the only way to generate RNA molecules bearing 2′,3′-cyclic phosphates. Such molecules can also be produced by the action of the RNA 3′-terminal phosphate cyclase, an enzyme that catalyzes ATP-dependent conversion of a 3′-phosphate at the end of RNA to the 2′,3′-cyclic phosphodiester (11Filipowicz W. Konarska M. Gross H.J. Shatkin A.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1405-1418Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The cyclase has been purified from HeLa cells and its mechanism of action established (37Filipowicz W. Strugala K. Konarska M. Shatkin A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1316-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 38Reinberg D. Arenas J. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 6088-6097Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Vicente O.

The cyclization occurs in three steps: (a) Enzyme + ATP → Enzyme-AMP + PPi, (b) RNA-N3′p + Enzyme-AMP → RNA-N3′pp5′A + Enzyme, and (c) RNA-N3′pp5′A → RNA-N>p + AMP. Evidence for the initial two steps were the identification of the covalent cyclase-AMP intermediate complex (37Filipowicz W. Strugala K. Konarska M. Shatkin A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1316-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 38Reinberg D. Arenas J. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 6088-6097Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Vicente O.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2955-2967Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and the demonstration of the RNA-N3′pp5′A molecule accumulation when the ribose at the RNA 3′ terminus is replaced with the 2′-deoxy- or 2′-O-methylribose (37Filipowicz W. Strugala K. Konarska M. Shatkin A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1316-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Reaction (c) probably occurs non-enzymatically as the result of nucleophilic attack by the adjacent 2′-OH on the phosphorus in the phosphodiester linkage (40Filipowicz W. Vicente O. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 181: 499-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). To investigate the biological role of the cyclase, we have recently cloned a cDNA encoding the human enzyme (41Genschik P. Billy E. Swianiewicz M. Filipowicz W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2955-2967Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The cyclase mRNA was shown to be expressed in all tissues and cell lines analyzed. The protein is localized to the nucleus, consistent with its postulated role in RNA processing. The sequence of the human cyclase has no apparent motifs in common with any protein of known function. However, genes encoding proteins having strong similarity to the cyclase were identified in organisms belonging to all three kingdoms, Eucarya, Bacteria, and Archaea. The protein encoded by the Escherichia coli gene was overexpressed and purified and was shown to have RNA 3′-terminal phosphate cyclase activity (41Genschik P. Billy E. Swianiewicz M. Filipowicz W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2955-2967Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Conservation of the cyclase among eukaryotic and prokaryotic organisms suggests that the enzyme performs an important function in RNA metabolism. In this work, we describe the characterization of the E. coli cyclase and demonstrate that its gene forms part of a so far uncharacterized operon that belongs to the class of operons controlled by the alternative ς54 factor. Unless stated otherwise, all techniques for manipulation of DNA and RNA, commonly used buffers, and media were as described (42Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar, 43Ausubel F. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing, New York1990Google Scholar). E. coli strains YMC10 (thi-1 endA1 hsdR17 supE44 ΔlacU169 hutC k) and YMC22 (like YMC10, butrpoN::Tn10) (44Reitzer L.J. Magasanik B. Cell. 1986; 45: 785-792Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) and plasmid pTH7 were obtained from Drs. M. Carmona-Perez and B. Magasanik (MIT, Cambridge, MA). pTH7 contains the E. coli ς 54 (rpoN) gene cloned downstream of the tac promoter on a pBR322 derivative (45Hunt T.P. Magasanik B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 8453-8457Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The strain used for gene replacement, MC1061 (F- araD139Δ(ara-leu)7697Δ(lac)X74 galU galK strA), and plasmid pMAK705 (46Hamilton C.M. Aldea M. Washburn B.K. Babitzke P. Kushner S.R. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 4617-4622Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were obtained from Drs. S. Kushner (University of Georgia, Athens, GA) and J. Offengand (University of Miami, FL). pBluescript II KS+ and pREP4 were from Stratagene and Qiagen, respectively. Plasmid pRtcB, containing the rtcB gene and its flanking sequences, was obtained by cloning of the PCR1-amplified E. coli DNA fragment into the EcoRV site of pBluescript II KS+; oligonucleotides GGCACGACGGTTGCAATTATCAGG and CAGCGCAATCATCCTTTTCATC were used as amplification primers. Plasmids pRtcR and pRtcRΔN, expressing the RtcR activator and its N-terminally truncated version, respectively, were constructed as follows. ThertcR gene with flanking regions was amplified by PCR using as a template λ phage DD765 DNA (kindly provided by Drs. G. Plunkett and F. Blattner, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI) and cloned into pBluescript II KS+, yielding plasmid pKD4. HindIII and BamHI sites were introduced by oligonucleotide-directed PCR mutagenesis at the 5′ and 3′ ends of the rtcR gene, respectively, using pKD4 as a template. The PCR product was cloned intoHindIII and BamHI sites of the pHSG765 vector containing a chloramphenicol resistance marker (47Takeshita S. Sato M. Toba M. Masahashi W. Hashimoto-Gotoh T. Gene (Amst .). 1987; 61: 63-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar), yielding plasmid pRtcR. In this plasmid, the rtcR gene is expressed under the control of the lacZ promoter as a translational fusion with six amino acids of β-galactosidase at the N terminus. pRtcRΔN, expressing the N-terminally truncated mutant of RtcR, was constructed similarly except that the HindIII site was introduced 21 nucleotides upstream of the beginning of the region encoding the central domain of RtcR (the translation product starts with MTMITPLDFLKSG … ; the first L residue shown in italics corresponds to amino acid 179 of RtcR). Identity of inserts in pRtcB, pRtcR, and pRtcRΔN was verified by sequencing. Plasmid pMAK705cyc::Kmr used for gene disruption was constructed as follows. The 1,324-bpSmaI-HindIII fragment from pREP4, containing the kanamycin resistance gene, was first cloned intoSmaI-HindIII sites of pBluescript KS (Stratagene), yielding pBSKmr. Fragments corresponding to the 5′-flanking (620 bp) and 3′-flanking (669 bp) regions of the cyclase gene (obtained by PCR using the E. coli genomic DNA as a template and oligonucleotides TGCGCCATCGATCGCAATCATCCTTTTCATC and CTTACTTTGTCGACCTGGCACAAAAAGAGATG as the 5′-region-specific primers and oligonucleotides ATCTCTAGAGTAACCTGTTGCTGCTTAATC and GGTCGCGGATCCCTCATGCCATCTGCTGAC as the 3′-region-specific primers) were then cloned stepwise into pBSKmr, using theClaI-SalI and XbaI-BamHI sites, respectively, yielding pBScyc5′3′/Kmr. Finally, the 2.6-kilobase SalI-XbaI fragment from pBScyc5′3′/Kmr, encompassing the kanamycin resistance gene (Km r) and the rtcA gene upstream and downstream regions, was cloned into XbaI-SalI sites of pMAK705, yielding pMAK705cyc::Kmr. The cyclase was overexpressed as His-tagged protein in the E. coli strain BL21(DE3) and purified on an Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid column as described previously (41Genschik P. Billy E. Swianiewicz M. Filipowicz W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2955-2967Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Cyclase purity was >95% as judged after Coomassie Blue staining of the gel (41Genschik P. Billy E. Swianiewicz M. Filipowicz W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2955-2967Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was measured by the method of Bradford using the reagent obtained from Bio-Rad and bovine serum albumin as a standard. The oligoribonucleotide substrates, CCCCACCCCGp* and AAAAUAAAAGp*, were prepared as described previously (41Genschik P. Billy E. Swianiewicz M. Filipowicz W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2955-2967Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). For use in some experiments, the substrates were additionally purified on a 10% polyacrylamide, 8m urea gel. Aliquots of radioactive substrates were analyzed by digestion with RNase T2, nuclease P1, or calf intestine phosphatase (9Konarska M. Filipowicz W. Domdey H. Gross H.J. Nature. 1981; 293: 112-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), followed by TLC on cellulose plates in solvent A (see below). Over 90% of the label was always present as the terminal G3′p*. The E. coli 5 S rRNA (Boehringer Mannheim) and the in vitro transcribed human U14 snoRNA (kindly provided by F. Dragon of this laboratory) were 3′-terminally labeled using [5′-32P]pCp and T4 RNA ligase as described (41Genschik P. Billy E. Swianiewicz M. Filipowicz W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2955-2967Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Preparation of the unlabeled competitors, AAAAUAAAAG3′p (referred to as RNA3′p) and AAAATAAAAG3′p (referred to as DNA3′p), and their 3′-OH-terminated counterparts (referred to as RNA3′OH and DNA3′OH, respectively) as well as preparation of CCCCACCCCG3′p and (dN)npdN3′p (representing a mixture of 3′-phosphorylated oligodeoxyribonucleotides (n = 8–14); referred to as DNA3′p (m.n.)), was as described (41Genschik P. Billy E. Swianiewicz M. Filipowicz W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2955-2967Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). TLC was in solvent A (isobutyric acid:concentrated NH3:H2O (66:1:33)) or solvent B (saturated (NH4)2SO4:3 m sodium acetate:isopropyl alcohol (80:6:2)). Cyclase activity was assayed by the Norit method as described before (40Filipowicz W. Vicente O. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 181: 499-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 41Genschik P. Billy E. Swianiewicz M. Filipowicz W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2955-2967Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Unless indicated otherwise, 10-μl assays contained 30 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.6, 180 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.15 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm spermidine, 1.25 mmdithiothreitol, 0.005% Triton X-100, 5% glycerol, 0.2 mmATP, 30–90 fmol (10,000–25,000 cpm) of the substrate (either AAAAUAAAAGp* or CCCCACCCCGp*; both substrates yielded similar results), and 20–200 pg of the recombinant E. coli cyclase. Incubations were for 20 min at 25 °C. For pH optimum determination, a three-buffer system containing 0.1 m MES, 0.05m Tris, 0.05 m ethanolamine (48Ellis K.J. Morrison J.F. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 87: 405-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar) was used. The buffer was adjusted to the desired pH at 25 °C. Other details are indicated in the figure legends. K m values for ATP and GTP were calculated from Lineweaver-Burk plots. Assays were performed under standard conditions in the presence of five different concentrations of ATP (2.5–200 μm) or GTP (7.4 μm–1 mm). Velocities were calculated from the initial linear rates. Labeling of the cyclase with different [α-32P]NTPs was performed under cyclase assay conditions except that the AAAAUAAAAGp* substrate was omitted. Reactions (10 μl) contained 1.2 μm [α-32P]NTPs (specific activity 800 Ci/mmol) or 0.33 μm [α-32P]dATP (specific activity 3,000 Ci/mmol) and indicated amounts of the cyclase and were incubated at 25 °C. The reactions were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. Immediately before gel electrophoresis, samples were supplemented with respective unlabeled NTPs or dATP to a final concentration of 10 mm. For AMP release assays, 1.8 ng of the cyclase was first adenylylated under standard conditions in the presence of 1.7 μm[α-32P]ATP (specific activity 800 Ci/mmol), with no substrate added, for 2 h at 25 °C. The reactions were then diluted 7-fold with cyclase assay buffer, different amounts of competitors were added, and incubations were continued for 15 min at 25 °C. The reactions were analyzed as described above. Bacterial cultures were grown in LB medium containing, when appropriate, 100 mg/liter ampicillin, 20 mg/liter kanamycin, or 10 mg/liter chloramphenicol, to an A 600 of 1.0 (49Cases I. de Lorenzo V. Perez-Martin J. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 7-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). When required, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to 1 mm concentration for the last 30 min of growth. Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation. Total RNA was isolated with RNeasy spin columns (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations, followed by DNase treatment (20 min at 37 °C, 0.1 unit/μl RNase free DNase (Promega) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm MgCl2). The column fractionation and DNase treatment were repeated twice. After the second DNase treatment, the enzyme was inactivated by heating for 5 min at 72 °C, and RNA was directly used for cDNA synthesis. cDNA synthesis was performed in a 40-μl volume. Reactions contained the first-strand synthesis buffer for Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.), 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm of each dNTP, 2.5 μm random hexamers (Promega), 50 ng/ml RNA, and 100 units of RNase H− SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.). Incubations were for 12 min at 21 °C, followed by 45 min at 42 °C. Reverse transcriptase was inactivated by heating for 5 min at 95 °C. PCR reactions were performed in a 50-μl volume. They contained the native Taq polymerase buffer (Stratagene), 0.5 μm primers, 4 μl of the cDNA synthesis reaction, and 1.5 units of native Taq polymerase (Stratagene). In addition, reactions contained 2 nmol (∼50,000 cpm) of one of the primers that had been 5′-end labeled using [γ-32P]ATP (3,000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and T4 polynucleotide kinase and purified on a 20% acrylamide, 8 m urea gel. 21 PCR cycles were performed (1 min, 95 °C; 1 min, 65 °C; 1 min, 72 °C). Primers for the following genes were used: rtcA(TGAGCCTGTCGATGATAACC and AGCACCAGCGTACAACTTCC), rtcB(GTGAAGAGATCTACGTGACG and GATAACTTCCACCAGATCGC), rtcR N terminus (CGTTGGTCATCGATCGACTG and GCTTCTGCCAGCAGAAACCA),rtcR C terminus (GCATACGGTCGAAGAGATCG and TCTCTGGACCTTCACCCTGC), rpoN (AGGTTAACTTGCTCTCGCTC and GCCAAATGGTTGATCAAGAG), and ribosomal protein S5 (rpsE) gene (CAACGGATTTACCACGCTTGGCA and TTCCAGCAGCGATCCAGAAAGC). The unique specificity of each primer pair was verified using E. coli genomic DNA as a template. Furthermore, in additional control experiments, it has been demonstrated that formation of the RT-PCR products with all pairs of primers was dependent upon the reverse transcription step, indicating that RNA samples were not contaminated with chromosomal or plasmid DNA (data not shown). PCR reactions with different pairs of primers were always performed with the same batch of cDNA. Products of PCR reactions were separated on 2% agarose gels. Gels were dried on the DEAE-cellulose paper (Whatman) support and exposed to an x-ray film. It has been found with the N-terminal rtcR pair of primers that within an 18- to 24-cycle range, there is a linear relationship between the number of PCR cycles and the amount of amplified product. An oligodeoxynucleotide complementary tortcB mRNA, CCTTTGGTCCACATTTTTACC, was 5′-end32P-labeled and purified as described above. Annealing reactions contained 20 pmol of the primer and 20 μg of RNA in 160 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.7, 1 m NaCl, and 1 mm Na2-EDTA. After heating at 95 °C for 2 min and annealing overnight at 48 °C, the mixture was ethanol precipitated and dissolved in 20 μl of the first-strand synthesis buffer for Superscript II reverse transcriptase containing 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm of each dNTP, and 400 units of Superscript II reverse transcriptase. After 1 h at 42 °C, the reaction was processed for analysis on a 10% acrylamide, 8 m urea gel. Chromosomal insertion and excision steps with pMAK705cyc::km r, resulting in the replacement of the nearly complete rtcA (the remaining rtcA regions encode the 7 N-terminal and 34 C-terminal amino acids) by km r, were performed in the E. coli strain MC1061 as described (46Hamilton C.M. Aldea M. Washburn B.K. Babitzke P. Kushner S.R. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 4617-4622Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Southern blot analysis and PCR reactions, using primers specific for the cyclase coding and flanking regions, and for the kanamycin resistance gene, performed with DNA isolated from both the knockout and control MC1061 strains, confirmed that the gene replacement had taken place. A human cDNA clone (GenBank R61436) encoding RtcB-like protein was obtained from the I.M.A.G.E. Consortium (Livermore, CA). The clone was sequenced on both strands, using appropriate oligonucleotide primers. The sequence encoding 29 N-terminal amino acids missing in this clone was obtained by RT-PCR using sequence information derived from the highly conserved mouse cDNA clone (GenBank W42119) to design the forward PCR primer. Poly(A)+ RNA from HeLa cells, kindly provided by P. Pelczar of this laboratory, was used to generate single-stranded cDNA as described above. The PCR reaction was performed on 200 ng of cDNA using as a forward primer the oligonucleotide ATGAGTCGTAACTACAACGATG. This sequence encompasses the ATG initiation codon (shown in italics) and the adjacent 5′-untranslated region nucleotides of the mouse cDNA. The backward primer, ATCATTCACATAGAAAACACC, was complementary to the human cDNA sequence, 120 nucleotides downstream of the ATG codon. The PCR-amplified fragment was cloned into the EcoRV site in pBluescript II KS+, and the insert was sequenced. The sequence of the 5′-terminal part of the cDNA encoding human RtcB-like protein was further confirmed by inspection of two recent expressed sequence tag entries (GenBank AA090429 and AA 232068). Unless indicated otherwise, sequence management and analysis were performed with the GCG Wisconsin package of programs (Genetics Computer Group, Madison, WI) on the UNIX platform. Protein sequence alignments were performed with the ClustalW 1.5 program (50Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acid"

Voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels (VDCCs)1 are heteromultimeric complexes present in both neuronal and non-neuronal tissues, including heart and skeletal muscle (1Perez-Reyes E. Schneider T. Drug Dev.

VDCCs are minimally composed of three subunits: a pore-forming transmembrane α1 subunit, a hydrophilic intracellular β subunit, and a membrane-associated α2δ subunit; a transmembrane γ subunit is also found in skeletal muscle tissue. Multiple subtypes and/or splice variants of the α1, β, and α2δ subunits have been found (3Birnbaumer L. Campbell K.P. Catterall W.A. Harpold M.M. Hofmann F. Horne W.A. Mori Y. Schwartz A. Snutch T.P.

In heterologous expression studies, the α2δ subunit has been shown to increase α1 currents both by facilitating the assembly of α1 subunits at the cell surface (4Brust P.F. Simerson S. McCue A.F.

Gabapentin ((1-aminomethyl)cyclohexane acetic acid or Neurontin) is a structural analogue of GABA licensed as an adjunctive therapy for epilepsy (9Ramsay, R. E. (1994) Neurology 44, Suppl. 5, 23–30Google Scholar). Recent research suggests that gabapentin may also have clinical utility for anxiety (10Watson W.P. Little H.J. Br. J.

Although designed as a lipophilic GABA-mimetic, gabapentin does not have a high affinity for either GABAA or GABAB receptors (18Suman Chauhan N. Webdale L. Hill D.R. Woodruff G.N. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1993; 244: 293-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), GABA uptake sites, or the GABA-degrading enzyme GABA-transaminase (EC2.6.1.19) (19Macdonald, R. L., and Kelly, K. M.

However, there is some evidence that gabapentin indirectly modulates GABAergic pathways (21Gotz E. Feuerstein T.J. Lais A. Meyer D.K. Arzneimittelforschung. 1993; 43: 636-638PubMed Google Scholar, 22Loscher W. Honack D. Taylor C.P. Neurosci. Lett. 1991; 128: 150-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 23Honmou O.

Behavioral studies suggest a possible role for the glycine/N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor in the mechanism of action of gabapentin (18Suman Chauhan N. Webdale L. Hill D.R. Woodruff G.N. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1993; 244: 293-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Other reported biochemical actions of gabapentin include inhibition of the release of dopamine (26Reimann W. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1983; 94: 341-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), and noradrenaline, and serotonin (27Dooley D.J. Bartoszyk G.D. Hartenstein J. Reimann W. Rock D.M. Satzinger G. Golden Jubilee Conference and Northern European Epilepsy Meeting. Abstracts, University, 1986Google Scholar). A novel high affinity binding site for [3H]gabapentin in rat, mouse, and pig brains has been characterized (18Suman Chauhan N. Webdale L. Hill D.R. Woodruff G.N. Eur. J.

Pharmacol. 1993; 247: 341-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Recently, the [3H]gabapentin-binding protein was isolated from pig brain and identified as the α2δ subunit of VDCCs (29Gee N.S. Brown J.P. Dissanayake V.U.K. Offord J. Thurlow R. Woodruff G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5768-5776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1091) Google Scholar). None of the prototypic anticonvulsant drugs displace [3H]gabapentin binding from the α2δ subunit (18Suman Chauhan N. Webdale L. Hill D.R. Woodruff G.N. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1993; 244: 293-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 30Dissanayake V.U.K. Gee N.S. Brown J.P. Woodruff G.N. Br. J.

The rank order of potency of gabapentin, and S- and R-isobutyl GABA, at the [3H]gabapentin binding site mirrors their anticonvulsant activity in mice (31Taylor C.P. Vartanian M.G. Yuen P.W. Bigge C. Suman Chauhan N. Hill D.R. Epilepsy Res. 1993; 14: 11-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). However, electrophysiological studies have yielded conflicting data on the action of gabapentin at VDCCs (32Rock D.M. Kelly K.M. Macdonald R.L. Epilepsy Res. 1993; 16: 89-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 33Wamil, A. W., Mclean, M. J., Nashville, T. N., and Taylor, C. P. (1991) Neurology 41, Suppl. 1, 140 (abstr.)Google Scholar), and the relevance of the interaction of gabapentin at the α2δ subunit to the clinical utility of the drug is presently unclear. The α2δ subunit is derived from a single gene (34De Jongh K.S. Warner C. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14738-14741Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the product of which is extensively post-translationally modified. The polypeptide is cleaved to form disulfide-bridged α2 and δ peptides (35Jay S.D. Sharp A.H. Kahl S.D. Vedvick T.S. Harpold M.M. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3287-3293Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), both of which are heavily glycosylated (36Burgess A.J. Norman R.I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 178: 527-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Hydropathy analysis of the α2δ subunit from rabbit skeletal muscle predicts two putative transmembrane domains in the 145,000 M r α2polypeptide component and one in the 25,000 M rδ component (37Ellis S.B. Williams M.E. Ways N.R. Brenner R. Sharp A.H. Leung A.T. Campbell K.P. McKenna E. Koch W.J. Hui A. Schwartz A. Harpold M.M. Science. 1988; 241: 1661-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). However, a number of biochemical studies lend support to a single transmembrane model for the α2δ subunit in which the protein is anchored through a domain near the C terminus of the δ polypeptide (35Jay S.D.

The structural requirements for binding of [3H]gabapentin to the α2δ subunit are not known. Here, we describe the cloning of the porcine cerebral cortical α2δ cDNA and the expression of a series of C-terminal deletion mutants of the protein in COS-7 cells. We have examined the ability of these mutants to bind [3H]gabapentin, and we report on the expression of a soluble α2δ mutant that retains high affinity for [3H]gabapentin. Gabapentin, [3H]gabapentin (104 Ci/mmol), S-isobutyl GABA (PD144723), and R-isobutyl GABA (PD144550) were supplied by Parke-Davis Pharmaceutical Research (Division of Warner-Lambert Co., Ann Arbor, MI). pBluescript II SK (+) and Pfu DNA polymerase were obtained from Stratagene. The porcine cerebral cortex λgt10 cDNA library was from CLONTECH, Cambridge Bioscience (Cambridge, UK). The expression vector pcDNA3 was obtained from R&D Systems (Abingdon, UK). Tissue culture reagents, lipofectamine, and the 5′ RACE kit were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. COS-7 cells were from ATCC. Dialysis was performed in Slide-a-Lyzer cassettes obtained from Pierce & Warriner Ltd. (Chester, UK). Ultrafiltration devices were obtained from Amicon Ltd. (Stonehouse, Gloucestershire, UK). An oligo dT-primed λgt10 porcine cerebral cortical cDNA library was screened by ECL (Amersham) using a 2,381-bpHindIII fragment (coding sequence 268–2649) of the rabbit skeletal muscle α2δ clone (pcDNA3-Rab-α2δ-(+); supplied by Dr. Offord, Parke-Davis Pharmaceutical Research, Ann Arbor, MI) as the probe. A positive insert was identified and subcloned into pBluescript-SK-(+) to generate pB-PC-α2δ-1.1. The clone was sequenced on both strands, except for a 711-bp stretch at one end of the clone, which had a high degree of homology to mitochondrial C oxidase (41Xu X. Arnason U. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 148: 357-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). The α2δ coding region was homologous to the 3′ region of the human neuronal α2δ sequence (42Williams M.E. Feldman D.H. McCue A.F. Brenner R. Velicelebi G. Ellis S.B. Harpold M.M. Neuron. 1992; 8: 71-84Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar) but lacked 926 bp of 5′ coding sequence. The missing sequence was obtained by 5′-RACE using total RNA prepared from porcine cerebral cortex. RACE was performed across a BglI site unique in known α2δ sequences (rabbit (accession no. M21948) (37Ellis S.B. Williams M.E. Ways N.R. Brenner R. Sharp A.H. Leung A.T. Campbell K.P. McKenna E. Koch W.J. Hui A. Schwartz A. Harpold M.M.

Neuron. 1992; 8: 71-84Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar)). The sequence derived from the 5′ RACE product was used to design a primer (JB042, 5′-GGGGATTGATCTTCGATCGCG-3′) specific for the 5′-untranslated end of the cDNA. PCR was then performed with Pfu DNA polymerase using JB042 and a primer downstream of the BglI site (JB040, 5′-CTGAGATTTGGGGTTCTTTGG-3′). The PCR product was ligated to EcoRI linkers (5′-GGAATTCC-3′) and then digested withEcoRI and BglI. The 1,564-bp fragment (5′ portion of the α2δ cDNA) was gel-purified. Similarly, a 2,303-bp fragment (3′ portion of the α2δ cDNA) was isolated after digestion of pB-PC-α2δ-1.1 withBglI and EcoRI. The two fragments of α2δ cDNA were then ligated toEcoRI-digested pcDNA3 in a three-way ligation. A clone was picked with the full-length α2δ sequence in the positive orientation with respect to the cytomegalovirus promoter (pcDNA3-PC-α2δ-(+)). The PCR-derived 5′ α2δ sequence in this plasmid was sequenced on both strands. Any sequence within this Pfu-amplified region that resulted in the coding of a residue not present in the rat (43Kim H.L. Kim H. Lee P. King R.G. Chin H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

All differences were confirmed as genuine by this method. The α2δ subunit was purified from porcine brains as described by Gee et al. (29Gee N.S. Brown J.P. Dissanayake V.U.K. Offord J. Thurlow R. Woodruff G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5768-5776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1091) Google Scholar) up to, and including, the Sephacryl S400 step. The sample of partially purified α2δ subunits was then further purified on a 1-ml CuSO4 charged iminodiacetic acid-Sepharose column. Prior to each use, the column was recharged with CuSO4 following a modified version of the protocol described by Brown et al.(44Brown J.P. Dissanayake V.U.K. Briggs A.R. Milic M.R. Gee N.S. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 255: 236-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Briefly, the column was stripped of metal ions with 3 ml of 0.5m EDTA/NaOH, pH 8.0 (at 21 °C), washed with 20 ml of H2O, and then charged with 20 ml of 0.3 mCuSO4 before a second wash with 20 ml of H2O and equilibration in buffer A (750 mm NaCl, 0.08% Tween 20, 10 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.4 (at 21 °C)). The partially purified α2δ subunits obtained from the S400 chromatography was applied to this column at 0.5 ml/min. Breakthrough material was concentrated to ∼100 μl by ultrafiltration (10,000M r cut-off membrane) before separation by SDS- polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on an 8% preparative gel. The 145-kDa band was excised, and the peptide recovered from the gel by electroelution. Rabbits were immunized by Serotec (Oxford, UK). Anti-δ antibodies were raised by immunizing rabbits with a keyhole lympet hemocyanin-conjugated peptide, VEMEDDDFTASLSKQSC, corresponding to the start sequence of the δ polypeptide (residues 922–938, relative to the first residue of the mature α2polypeptide). Peptide synthesis and immunization protocols were performed by Genosys Biotechnologies Inc. (The Woodlands, TX). Purified pig brain α2δ (125 μg) was electrophoresed under reducing conditions on a single wide track 4–20% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel. After transfer onto nitrocellulose membrane, two thin horizontal strips corresponding to the α2 and δ polypeptides were excised with a razor blade. The strips were incubated with blocking buffer (2% milk powder, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5) for 30 min. Immune serum (1 ml) was diluted 5-fold in blocking buffer and incubated with the appropriate strip for 2 h at 4 °C. Strips were then washed three times (15 min each) with blocking buffer and eluted with 2 ml of 50 mm glycine/HCl, pH 2.3. The solution was neutralized with 0.4 ml of 1 m HEPES, pH 8.0. Aliquots of the affinity-purified antibodies were stored frozen at −70 °C. For mutants C (Δ251–1067 (i.e. residues 251 to 1067 deleted)), D (Δ446–1067), E (Δ597–1067), F (Δ780–1067), G (Δ922–1067), H (Δ943–1067), I (Δ960–1067), J (Δ995–1067), K (Δ1013–1067), L (Δ1040–1067), M (Δ1061–1067), and PCR-WT (3′-untranslated region deleted) amplifications were performed with an anchored 5′ primer (JB055, 5′-TGGCTTATCGAAATTAATACG-3′), which anneals at position 849–869 in pcDNA3-PC-α2δ-(+). For mutants A (Δ111–1067) and B (Δ229–1067), the anchored 5′ primer was 5′-AACTCCGGGGATTGATCTTCG-3′ (JB115), which anneals at position 947–967. The 3′ primer was designed to anneal internally to the α2δ coding sequence to generate the specified C-terminally truncated α2δ mutant. All 3′ primers had the following tail structure: a double stop codon followed by anEcoRI site (5′-CAGAATTCCTCATCA-N (18–21)-3′), whereN is the in-frame site-specific sequence complementary to the α2δ cDNA. Pfu DNA polymerase was used in the PCR reactions, and the products amplified with JB055 were blunt-end cloned into pBluescript-SK(+). The insert was then subcloned into the EcoRI site of pcDNA3. Products generated with JB115 were cloned directly into the EcoRV site of pcDNA3. Clones were partially sequenced to confirm primer regions and a positive orientation with respect to the cytomegalovirus promoter. The α2sequence (residues 1–921) was deleted utilizing the two-round PCR method (45Higuchi R. Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sninsky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Applications. Academic Press, Ltd., London1990: 177-183Google Scholar) employing Pfu DNA polymerase. The product was blunt-end cloned into pBluescript-SK-(+) and then directionally subcloned into pcDNA3 as described above. All media contained 50 units/ml penicillin and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + glutamax, 10% fetal bovine serum (gamma irradiated) in a 37 °C/5% CO2incubator and passaged by trypsinization. For transient expression experiments, 150-mm culture dishes were seeded with 3.9 × 106 cells and incubated for 16 h. Cells were then washed twice with 30 ml of optiMEM-1 and transfected (t= 0 h) with 30 μg of plasmid DNA by lipofectamine-mediated transfection in 21 ml of optiMEM-1. At t = 6 h, a further 21 ml of optiMEM-1 was added. At t = 24 h, the medium was replaced with 42 ml of optiMEM-1. At t = 48 h, the cells were washed twice with 30 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and then harvested in 3 ml of buffer A (1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 20% glycerol, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, at 4 °C) plus 0.1 mm phenymethylsulfonyl fluoride using a cell scraper. All subsequent operations were performed at 4 °C. The cells were tumbled on a Spiramix (Denley Instruments) for 30 min, centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 5 min, resuspended in 1 ml of buffer A, recentrifuged at 20,000 × g for 5 min, and finally resuspended in 400 μl of buffer A. Membrane preparations were stored at −70 °C until required. Spent tissue culture medium recovered at t = 24 and 48 h was ultracentrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h and then concentrated by ultrafiltration (10,000 M rcut-off) to approximately 1 ml. The concentrated sample was then extensively dialyzed against buffer A and stored at −70 °C until required. Samples of membranes (3 μg in 48 μl) were agitated for 2 h on a Spiramix at 4 °C in a total volume of 60 μl with a final concentration of either 1m NaCl or 10% ethylene glycol. Samples were ultracentrifuged at 100,000 × g for 2 h, and 20 μl of supernatant was removed for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The pellet was washed again for 10 min at 4 °C in 1 ml of the same buffer before ultracentrifugation at 100,000 ×g for 30 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was resuspended in 120 μl of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis loading buffer and boiled for 20 min; 40 μl was loaded onto the gel. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (46Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (217508) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. [3H]Gabapentin binding assays were performed as described previously (29Gee N.S.

For saturation analysis, incubations were performed in duplicate. All other incubations were performed in triplicate. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting were performed using the Novex gel and buffer system (Novex Europe, Frankfurt, Germany). Molecular weights were determined by reference to Kaleidoscope markers (Bio-Rad). Detection was performed using the ECL system (Amersham). A single positive clone was isolated from a λgt10 porcine cerebral cortical library. The EcoRI insert derived from the plaque comprised a 711-bp fragment with homology to mitochondrial C oxidase (41Xu X. Arnason U.

The missing 5′-coding sequence was obtained by a combination of 5′ RACE and standard PCR. A 3,273-bp open reading frame coding for a 1,091 residue protein was identified (Fig. 1).

The calculated M r of the α2δ subunit was 120,737, consisting of an α2 polypeptide of 104,337M r and an δ polypeptide of 16,400M r. Four putative hydrophobic domains were identified in the porcine sequence (Fig. 2) using the Kyte and Doolittle algorithm (47Kyte J. Doolittle F. J. Mol.

To determine whether a direct interaction of PI3K with GLUT4-containing vesicles (hereafter called GLUT4 vesicles) is important for the effect of insulin on GLUT4 translocation, we targeted constitutively active PI3K to GLUT4 vesicles. We fused the inter-Src homology region 2 of the regulatory p85α subunit of PI3K (iSH2) either to a C-terminal sequence of GLUT4 (G4c, amino acids 406–509) or to this region and the N-terminal tail of GLUT4 (G4n, amino acids 1–19), resulting in the fusion proteins iSH2-G4c and G4n-iSH2-G4c, respectively. Coexpression of the fusion proteins or untargeted iSH2 with the catalytic p110α subunit of PI3K (p110) in 3T3-L1 adipocytes by adenovirus-mediated gene transfer increased total PI3K activity in homogenates 5.0–6.7-fold over nontransduced cells or cells transduced with adenovirus encoding β-galactosidase. In contrast, PI3K activity in GLUT4 vesicles increased 11–13-fold with expression of either targeted construct and p110 but only 2-fold with the untargeted iSH2 and p110, indicating successful targeting of PI3K to GLUT4 vesicles. Both targeted and nontargeted constructs stimulated DNA synthesis to levels greater than insulin, demonstrating that both types of constructs had biologic activity in intact cells. Despite this, untargeted iSH2/p110 coexpression was more effective in stimulating 2-deoxyglucose uptake (6-fold) than either iSH2-G4c/p110 or G4n-iSH2-G4c/p110 coexpression (both 2-fold). Only iSH2/p110 coexpression led to a significant GLUT4 translocation to the plasma membrane. Insulin-stimulated glucose transport was unaffected by any construct. Thus, a direct interaction between PI3K and GLUT4 vesicles is either not required or not sufficient for GLUT4 translocation and stimulation of glucose transport. Constitutive activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) stimulates glucose transport and GLUT4 glucose transporter translocation to the plasma membrane in adipocytes.

Activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)1 plays a central role in the insulin-signaling cascades leading to metabolic as well as mitogenic cellular responses. Studies using either inhibitors such as wortmannin and LY294002 or dominant negative forms of PI3K have demonstrated that PI3K activation is necessary for many of the effects of insulin (1Cheatham B.

Chem. 1994; 269: 3568-3573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, more recent studies demonstrate that increased PI3K activity is at least partially sufficient to stimulate GLUT4 translocation, glucose transport, DNA synthesis, and actin rearrangement in 3T3-L1 adipocytes in the absence of insulin stimulation (4Frevert E.U. Kahn B.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 190-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 5Katagiri H. Asano T. Ishihara H. Inukai K. Shibasaki Y. Kikuchi M. Yazaki Y. Oka Y. J. Biol.

Other growth factors such as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) as well as cytokines activate PI3K, but they do not stimulate the same metabolic effects as insulin (8Isakoff S.J. Taha C. Rose E. Marcusohn J. Klip A. Skolnik E.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10247-10251Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 9Wiese R.J. Mastick C.C. Lazar D.F. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3442-3446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Thus, the mechanism(s) underlying the specificity of the effects of insulin is of great interest. This specificity might be explained by a distinct spatial distribution of the signaling events induced by different growth factors and cytokines. For example, while PDGF-stimulated PI3K activity resides primarily in the plasma membrane (PM), insulin-stimulated PI3K activity is found primarily in an intracellular membrane compartment, the “low density” microsomes (LDM) (10Kelly K.L. Ruderman N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4391-4398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Nave B.T. Haigh R.J. Hayward A.C. Siddle K. Shepherd P.R. Biochem.

J. 1996; 313: 125-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), and is associated with insulin-responsive substrates (IRSs). The LDM compartment consists of a wide range of membrane vesicles, up to ∼35% of which contain the insulin-responsive glucose transporter, GLUT4 (14Martin S. Tellam J. Livingston C. Slot J.W. Gould G.W. James D.E. J. Cell. Biol. 1996; 134: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Following insulin stimulation, GLUT4 is redistributed from the LDM to the plasma membrane, resulting in increased glucose transport (15Kahn B.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 1367-1374Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). The exact molecular mechanisms that result in translocation of GLUT4 vesicles are poorly understood. However, they are the subject of intense research, since there are no alterations in GLUT4 primary structure or protein expression in skeletal muscle of humans with obesity or type II diabetes, and evidence indicates that a defect in GLUT4-vesicle translocation and/or fusion with the PM may be a major factor underlying the insulin resistance associated with these states (15Kahn B.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 1367-1374Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 16King P.A. Horton E.D. Hirshman M.F. Horton E.S. J. Clin.

Hence, manipulating insulin signaling pathways might lead to new therapeutic approaches to overcome defective GLUT4 vesicle translocation/fusion and thus prevent or ameliorate insulin resistance. A compelling hypothesis for the mechanism of GLUT4 vesicle translocation is that PI3K activity associates directly with the GLUT4 vesicle, leading to translocation, possibly either by recruitment of downstream signaling molecules or other proteins or by generation of the highly charged phospholipid products of PI3K: phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate. A recent report indicates that insulin stimulates translocation of IRS-1 to the GLUT4 vesicle and that this is associated with stimulation of PI3K in the GLUT4 vesicle itself (18Heller-Harrison R.A. Morin M. Guilherme A. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10200-10204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Other reports do not find colocalization of the majority of IRS-1 or the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K with GLUT4 (10Kelly K.L. Ruderman N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4391-4398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Clark S.F. Martin S. Carozzi A.J. Hill M.M. James D.E. J. Cell.

Commun. 1998; 246: 282-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), although it is still possible that a small amount of IRS-1 and p85 could associate with the GLUT4 vesicle or that the association was missed due to its transient nature or to experimental methodologies, which cause dissociation of these proteins from the vesicles. Thus, we took a novel approach to test the hypothesis that the compartmentalization of PI3K activity in GLUT4 vesicles will augment GLUT4 translocation and glucose transport. We recently found that coexpression of the inter Src homology region 2 of the p85α subunit of PI3K (iSH2) with the catalytic p110α subunit of PI3K (p110) by adenovirus-mediated gene delivery in 3T3-L1 adipocytes stimulates PI3K activity in the LDM and cytosol to levels above insulin stimulation and increases GLUT4 translocation and glucose transport to ∼40% of the effect of insulin (4Frevert E.U. Kahn B.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 190-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In the current study, we targeted PI3K activity to GLUT4 vesicles to determine whether this would give the 15–20-fold stimulation of glucose transport seen with insulin (4Frevert E.U. Kahn B.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 190-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Since both the N-terminal and C-terminal domains of GLUT4 have been shown to play a role in the intracellular trafficking and targeting of GLUT4 (21Czech M.P. Chawla A. Woon C.-H. Buxton J. Armoni M.

Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1071-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), we fused to iSH2 either the two C-terminal membrane-spanning domains and the cytosolic C-terminal tail of GLUT4 (G4c, amino acids 406–509) or this region and in addition the N-terminal tail of GLUT4 (G4n, amino acids 1–19). This resulted in the fusion proteins iSH2-G4c and G4n-iSH2-G4c, respectively. Coexpression of these fusion proteins with p110 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes results in a dramatic increase of PI3K activity in GLUT4-containing vesicle as well as stimulation of DNA synthesis. However, the targeted expression of PI3K is less efficient in stimulating GLUT4 translocation and glucose transport than untargeted expression of PI3K. These results indicate that an increase in GLUT4 vesicle-associated PI3K activity is not required or not sufficient to stimulate GLUT4 translocation. The unique ability of insulin-stimulated-PI3K activity to trigger this translocation may be linked to localization in a different membrane subfraction of the LDM or may not require membrane association. 3T3-L1 cells (ATCC CCL 92.1, Rockville, MD) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 10% calf serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin (all from Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD) at 37 °C, 5% CO2.

Cells were used for experiments 10–20 days after the induction of differentiation and only if more than 90% of the cells showed fat droplets.

Gomez-Foix A.M. Alam T. Gerard R.D. Newgard C.B. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 43: 161-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). Briefly, the plasmids pACCMV.pLpA-iSH2, pACCMV.pLpA-iSH2-G4c, pACCMV.pLpA-G4n-iSH2-G4c, and pACCMV.pLpA-110 were each cotransfected with the plasmid pJM-17 into 293 cells as described above. Cell lysis indicating a recombination event, occurred 1–2 weeks following cotransfection. Several clones of recombinant virus were checked for the successful integration of the respective coding regions by Western blotting using lysate of transduced 293 cells. One clone for each of the constructs was amplified further in 293 cells. Purification of virus from 30–40 15-cm diameter plates by cesium chloride centrifugation resulted in high titer stocks of recombinant virus, typically 1–2 × 1010 pfu/ml as determined by limiting dilution. The recombinant adenovirus encoding β-galactosidase was provided by C. Newgard and amplified as described above. Transduction of differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes was performed overnight with constant agitation on a rocking platform in DMEM with 10% fetal calf serum. iSH2, iSH2-G4c, G4n-iSH2-G4c, and p110 encoding recombinant adenoviruses were used at 1 × 109 pfu/ml each, resulting in a total of 2 × 109 pfu/ml in cotransduction experiments. β-Galactosidase encoding recombinant adenovirus was used at 2 × 109 pfu/ml. Experiments were performed following an additional 24 h incubation in fresh media. With 109 pfu/ml of recombinant virus, transduction efficiency was >90% as assessed by galactosidase staining (4Frevert E.U. Kahn B.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 190-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Cotransduction with two viruses (each at 109 pfu/ml) simultaneously did not reduce either the percentage of cells transduced or the level of expression compared with cells transduced with one virus alone (4Frevert E.U. Kahn B.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 190-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). To generate a total membrane fraction and a cytosolic fraction, COS-7 or 3T3-L1 cells were incubated in DMEM with 0.1% calf serum for 18 h, stimulated or not with 100 nm insulin for the indicated time, homogenized by 20 strokes in a Potter homogenizer in PI3K lysis buffer (see below), and centrifuged at 180,000 × g for 75 min to yield total membranes (pellet) and cytosol (supernatant). In separate experiments, subcellular fractionation was performed by differential centrifugation as described previously (13Yang J. Clarke J.F. Ester C.J. Young P.W. Kasuga M. Holman G.D. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 125-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Following serum starvation as described above, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were or were not stimulated with 100 nm insulin for the indicated time, washed once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), scraped into ice-cold HES buffer (10 mm HEPES, 5 mm EDTA, 250 mm sucrose (pH 7.4), containing 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and leupeptin), homogenized by 20 strokes in a Potter homogenizer and centrifuged at 19,000 × g for 20 min. The pellet of this first spin was resuspended in HES and centrifuged again under the same conditions. The resulting pellet from this second spin was resuspended in HES, layered on a 1.12 m sucrose cushion, and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min. The resulting interphase was collected, washed in HES, and spun at 50,000 × g for 30 min to yield the PM fraction. The supernatant of the first spin was centrifuged at 41,000 ×g for 20 min. The resulting pellet was the high density microsome fraction, and the resulting supernatant was spun at 180,000 × g for 75 min to yield the low density microsome fraction (LDM) as the pellet and the cytosolic fraction as the supernatant. PM, high density microsome, and LDM fractions were resuspended in equal volumes of PI3K lysis buffer. This fractionation procedure has previously been characterized (4Frevert E.U. Kahn B.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 190-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Protein recoveries (μg/100-mm diameter well) and purity of membrane fractions were not altered by transduction with recombinant adenoviruses. GLUT4 vesicles were prepared as described previously (30Ross S.A. Scott H.M. Morris N.J. Leung W.Y. Mao F. Lienhard G. Keller S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3328-3332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Following incubation in DMEM containing 0.1% CS overnight, differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were or were not stimulated with 100 nm insulin for the indicated times, quickly washed with PBS, and placed on ice. The cells from one 100-mm diameter plate were scraped into 3.0 ml of ice-cold homogenization buffer (150 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 20 mm HEPES, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and leupeptin, pH 7.2) and homogenized using 20 strokes of a Potter homogenizer. Following a 20-min spin at 40,000 ×g, the supernatant (LDM/cytosol) was split into two tubes for immunoadsorption with either affinity-purified anti-vp165 antibody (30Ross S.A. Scott H.M. Morris N.J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 3328-3332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) or equal amounts of irrelevant rabbit IgG (Sigma), both bound to protein A on the surface of formaldehyde-fixed Staphylococcus aureus cells (10 μg of antibodies on 4 μl of S. aureus cells). After incubation for 2 h on a rotating wheel at 4 °C, the S. aureus cells were collected by centrifugation and washed three times in homogenization buffer and split into two tubes. One half was resuspended in 25 μl of PI3K lysis buffer (see below) and immediately used for the determination of PI3K activity; the other half was incubated in PI3K lysis buffer with 1% Nonidet P-40 for 1 h on ice, and the solubilized proteins were used for Western blotting. Glucose transport activity was determined as described (31Frost S.C. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 2646-2652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Following incubation in serum-free DMEM for 3 h, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were washed twice with PBS and incubated for 30 min with or without 100 nm insulin in glucose-free minimal essential medium. 2-[3H]Deoxy-d-glucose (0.33 μCi/35-mm-diameter well; NEN Life Science Products) was added to a final concentration of 100 μm for an additional 10 min. Transport was stopped by putting the cells on ice and adding 1:1 (v/v) ice-cold phloretin solution (82 mg/liter in PBS). Cells were washed three times with cold PBS, dried, and lysed in 1 n NaOH. Aliquots of this lysate were used for liquid scintillation counting and determination of DNA content as described previously (25Labarca C. Paigen K. Ann. Biochem. Exp. Med. (Calcutta). 1980; 102: 344-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (4553) Google Scholar). Total PI3K activity in membrane and cytosolic fractions was assayed as described for cytosol (32Lamphere L. Carpenter C.L. Sheng Z.F. Kallen R.G. Lienhard G.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: E486-E494PubMed Google Scholar), using the borate thin layer chromatography method described by Walsh et al.(33Walsh J.P. Caldwell K.K. Majerus P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 76: 4350-4354Google Scholar), which allows separation of phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate and phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate. Following overnight incubation in DMEM with 0.1% calf serum, cells were or were not stimulated with 100 nm insulin and homogenized directly in PI3K lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, 140 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol (pH 7.4), containing 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 μg/ml aprotinin and leupeptin, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol). Cytosol and total membranes were prepared as described under “Cell fractionation.” For determination of PI3K activity in PM and LDM fractions, cells were homogenized and fractionated in HES buffer as described above, and the fractions were resuspended in PI3K lysis buffer. For determination of PI3K activity in GLUT4 vesicles, vesicles were adsorbed to S. aureus cells, washed as described above, and resuspended in 25 μl of lysis buffer. Aliquots of fractions in a total volume of 25 μl of PI3K lysis buffer were allowed to warm to room temperature for 5 min and were then mixed with 25 μl of a lipid/ATP mix containing 500 μg/ml phosphatidylinositol, 80 μm ATP, 0.8 μCi/μl [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol; NEN Life Science Products), 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 12.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.015% Nonidet P-40. To inhibit some of the phosphoinositide 4-kinase activity in membrane fractions, adenosine was added to a final concentration of 200 μm(34Klippel A. Escobedo J.A. Hirano M. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2675-2685Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The reaction was stopped after 5 min by the addition of 80 μl 1n HCl, and the phospholipids were extracted with 160 μl of chloroform/methanol (1:1, v/v). Phosphatidylinositol monophosphate in 40 μl organic phase was separated by borate thin-layer chromatography on aluminum-backed Silica Gel 60 plates (EM Separations, Inc., Gibbstown, NJ; pretreated with a solution containing 25 mm trans-1,2-diaminocyclohexane-N, N, N′,N′-tetraacetic acid (CDTA,Sigma), 66% (v/v) ethanol, and 0.06 n NaOH and then dried for 1 h and baked at 110 °C for 15 min) in developing solution containing 37.5% (v/v) methanol, 30% (v/v) chloroform, 22.5% (v/v) pyridine (Sigma), 1.33% (v/v) formic acid, 1m boric acid, and 8.5 mm butylated hydroxytoluene (Sigma) and detected by autoradiography. Quantification of phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate was performed using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., model 425E). Under the conditions described above, activity was linear with time and proportional to protein concentration. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting was performed as described previously (35Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar, 36Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Following incubation in Tris-buffered saline (TBS), 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20, 5% (w/v) low fat dry milk for 2 h, the membranes were incubated with the primary antibody overnight (polyclonal anti-GLUT4 (C-terminal) provided by H. Haspel (Henry Ford Health Center, Detroit, MI), 1:400; polyclonal anti-GLUT4 (N-terminal) provided by G. Gould (University of Aberdeen, Scotland), 1:400). Membranes were washed in TBS, 0.05% Tween 20 (anti-N-terminal GLUT4) or TBS, 0.5% Tween 20 (anti-C-terminal GLUT4) for 15 min; incubated with horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody (1:2000 dilution in TBS, 0.05% Tween 20; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 1 h; and washed 25 min in TBS, 0.05% Tween 20; and bands were visualized using the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Blots and autoradiograms were scanned using an Agfa Studioscan II with transparency module, brightness and contrast were adjusted with the Agfa FotoLook software, and they were printed on a Linotronic 200P printer. DNA synthesis was determined as described previously (4Frevert E.U. Kahn B.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 190-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were transduced with adenoviruses. Cells were incubated in serum-free DMEM with 1% bovine serum albumin with or without 500 nm insulin for 17 h. The medium was replaced by DMEM and 1% bovine serum albumin with [3H]thymidine (0.25 μCi/16-mm diameter well) with or without 100 nm insulin. After an additional 1-h incubation, cells were washed two times with cold PBS and lysed in 0.1% SDS. Lysates were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, filtered through glass fiber filters (Whatman, GF/C), and washed with 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid. After a final rinse with ethanol, filters were dried, and tritium incorporation into the filtered material was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's two-tailed t test for unpaired comparisons utilizing Statview software. To test for expression of the inter-SH2-GLUT4 chimeras, the expression plasmids containing the fusion constructs iSH2-G4c and G4n-iSH2-G4c (Fig. 1 A) were transiently transfected in COS-7 cells, and lysates were used for Western blotting using antisera against either a C-terminal peptide of GLUT4 or an N-terminal peptide of GLUT4. As shown in Fig. 1 B, the C-terminal-specific GLUT4 antiserum detects immunoreactive bands of the expected molecular mass for both iSH2-G4c (42 kDa) and G4n-iSH2-G4c (45 kDa), while the N-terminal specific antiserum detects only G4n-iSH2-G4c.

HSF2 has been thought to be responsible for accumulation of HSP70 during hemin-induced differentiation of human K562 erythroleukemia cells because of accompanying acquisition of HSF2 DNA binding activity. However, there has not been any direct evidence for such a functional role of HSF2. The purpose of this study is to clarify the roles of HSF1 and HSF2 in HSP70 induction in hemin-treated K562 cells. We show here that a chimeric polypeptide of HSF2 and GAL4 DNA binding domain (GAL4-BD–HSF2) was unable to induce a GAL4 binding site-containing luciferase reporter gene in response to hemin and that exogenously overproduced HSF2 also failed to increase expression of a heat shock element-containing reporter. On the contrary, expression of a GAL4-BD–HSF1 chimeric protein responded to hemin treatment as well as to heat shock, and transiently overexpressed HSF1 caused hemin-responsive induction of the reporter gene in a dose-dependent manner. These results indicate that HSF1, rather than HSF2, primarily mediates the hemin-induced transcription of the hsp70 gene.

Cells synthesize increased levels of HSP70 upon various environmental stresses such as elevated temperatures, heavy metals, and amino acid analogs to cope with the deleterious circumstances (1Lindquist S. Craig E.A. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1988; 22: 631-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (4438) Google Scholar). The expression of HSP70 is also increased in mouse embryonal carcinoma cells (2Bensaude O. Morange M. EMBO J. 1983; 2: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), at the two-cell stage of embryogenesis (3Bensaude O. Babinet C. Morange M. Jacob F.

Heat shock factors (HSFs)1 are responsible for transcription of the hsp70 gene upon these stressful or other physiological conditions, and multiple HSF genes have been isolated in chicken (HSF1, HSF2, and HSF3), mouse (HSF1 and HSF2), and human (HSF1, HSF2, and HSF4) (6Rabindran S.K.

Whereas HSF1 and HSF3 are rapidly activated by various stresses and stimulate transcription of the hsp70 gene (11Sarge K.D. Murphy S.P. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell.

Human K562 erythroleukemia cells, established from a patient with chronic myelogenous leukemia in blast crisis (15Lozzio C.B. Lozzio B.B. Blood. 1975; 45: 321-334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), are multipotent stem cells and differentiate to erythroid cells by treatment with hemin or sodium butyrate or hydroxyurea (16Lozzio B.B.

Increased expression of HSP70 and constitutive DNA binding of HSF2 have also been reported in mouse spermatogenic cell types (22Sarge K.D. Park-Sarge O.K. Kirby J.D. Mayo K.E. Morimoto R.I. Biol. Reprod. 1994; 50: 1334-1343Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), embryonal carcinoma cells (23Murphy S.P. Gorzowski J.J. Sarge K.D. Phillips B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5309-5317Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), and postimplantation embryos from E8.5 to E15.5 (24Rallu M. Loones M. Lallemand Y. Morimoto R. Morange M. Mezger V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2392-2397Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). However, whether HSF2 mediates the transcriptional activation of the hsp70 gene under these non-stress conditions has been controversial for lack of direct evidence. We recently analyzed the functional domains of human HSF2 in K562 cells using chimeric constructs fused to the GAL4 DNA binding domain (GAL4-BD) and identified the transactivation domains and negative regulatory motifs (25Yoshima T. Yura T. Yanagi H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2580-2585Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Although chimeric constructs of HSF1 fused to GAL4-BD had been shown to respond to heat shock by activating transcription of the heat shock element (HSE)-containing reporter genes (26Zuo J. Rungger D. Voellmy R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4319-4330Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 27Shi Y. Kroeger P.E. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4309-4318Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 28Newton E.M. Knauf U. Green M. Kingston R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 839-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), all of the GAL4-BD–HSF2 chimeras failed to respond to hemin treatment. Such an unexpected behavior of HSF2 prompted us to investigate which HSF mediates the increased expression of HSP70 in hemin-treated K562 cells. Here, we report that, in K562 cells (ATCC CCL243), HSF1 but not HSF2 responds to hemin to activate transcription of the hsp70gene. GAL4-BD–HSF1 chimeric protein stimulated expression of a luciferase reporter gene containing GAL4 binding sites upon not only heat shock but also hemin treatment. Transiently overexpressed HSF1 increased expression of an HSE-containing reporter in response to hemin in a dose-dependent manner, but transient expression of HSF2 did not show any significant effects on the hemin response. Moreover, HSF2-overproducing stable transformants lacked hemin-responsive expression of HSP70 despite constitutive HSF2 DNA binding. These results suggest that HSF1 primarily mediates transcription of the hsp70 gene during hemin-induced differentiation of K562 cells. The fusion gene of HSF2N96 or HSF1N101 with GAL4-BD was inserted into a mammalian expression vector pCAGGS (29Niwa H. Yamamura K. Miyazaki J. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 108: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (4617) Google Scholar) as described previously (25Yoshima T. Yura T. Yanagi H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2580-2585Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). To construct HSF1+2N101, residues 215 to 378 of HSF1 were replaced with residues 204 to 354 of HSF2 by polymerase chain reaction. In HSF2+1N96, residues 210 to 321 of HSF1 were substituted for residues 199 to 327 of HSF2. HSF2 and HSF1 expression plasmids, pCAHSF2 and pCAHSF1, were constructed by ligation into pCAGGS (29Niwa H. Yamamura K. Miyazaki J. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 108: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (4617) Google Scholar) of the DNA fragments encoding human HSF1 and HSF2 prepared from phHSF2–1 (provided by R. E. Kingston) and phHSF1 (30Yoshima T. Yura T. Yanagi H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 240: 228-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), respectively. pCXHSF2 was constructed by insertion of the HSF2 fragment into pCXN2 (29Niwa H. Yamamura K. Miyazaki J. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 108: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (4617) Google Scholar) to generate HSF2-overproducing stable cell lines. The firefly luciferase reporter plasmid pGLHSE3 was constructed by insertion into pGL3-promoter vector (Promega) of three tandem repeats of an HSE-containing synthetic DNA, whose sequence was identical to that of the probe used in gel shift analysis (see below). GAL4 binding site-containing luciferase reporter plasmid pGLG4E5 was described previously (30Yoshima T. Yura T. Yanagi H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 240: 228-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Renilla luciferase expression plasmid pRLSV40 was purchased from Promega. K562 cells (ATCC CCL243) were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Transient transfection of K562 cells was done by electroporation. 5 × 106cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and suspended in 0.4 ml of PBS containing 30 μg of plasmids. After incubating for 10 min at room temperature, the cells were exposed to an electric pulse (300 V/cm, 500 microfarads) by using Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad). The electroporated cells were left at room temperature for 10 min and then incubated in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum in 5% CO2 at 37 °C for 48 h. Cells were harvested, washed twice with PBS, divided into two aliquots for luciferase assay and for preparation of cell extracts, and stored at –80 °C. Luciferase assays were performed by using Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instruction. K562 cells were transfected with 20 μg of linearized pCXHSF2 DNA as described above. Cells were cultured for 2 days at 37 °C, and neomycin-resistant cells were selected in medium containing 300 μg/ml of G418 for 4 days. Thereafter, the culture was diluted, and the selection was continued further for 2 weeks to obtain single cell-derived clones. Cell pellets were frozen at –80 °C and suspended in 20 mm HEPES containing 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 25% glycerol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin. After addition of NaCl to a final concentration of 0.42 m, the lysates were set on ice for 5 min and centrifuged for 15 min at 100,000 × g at 4 °C. The supernatants were used as whole cell extracts. Protein concentrations were determined by a protein assay kit (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Total RNA from K562 cells was prepared by using Isogen (Nippon Gene) and separated on a 1% agarose gel containing formaldehyde. The RNA was transferred onto a nylon membrane (DuPont NEN), hybridized with 32P-labeled humanhsp70 genomic DNA (SPD-925) (StressGen), grp78genomic DNA (nucleotides +3 to +593 prepared from HeLa genomic DNA by polymerase chain reaction), or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA (CLONTECH), washed in 0.2 × SSPE, 0.1% SDS at 42 °C, followed by autoradiography and quantification with a BioImaging analyzer BAS2000 (Fuji Film). Whole cell extracts (10 μg of protein) were mixed with 5 fmol of double-stranded32P-labeled oligonucleotide (5′–GATCCGGAGGTGAAACCCCTTGAATATTCTCGACCTGGCAGATC–3′) containing HSE of the human hsp70 promoter (–120 to –85) (31Morgan W.D. Williams G.T. Morimoto R.I. Greene J. Kingston R.E. Tjian R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 1129-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) in 25 μl of reaction buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 5% glycerol) containing 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The mixture was incubated for 20 min at room temperature, and 15 μl was loaded onto a 4% polyacrylamide gel in 0.15 × TAE. After electrophoresis at 250 V for 2 h at 4 °C, the gel was dried on DE81 paper and exposed to x-ray film. Gel shift assay using a probe containing a single GAL4 binding site was described previously (25Yoshima T. Yura T. Yanagi H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2580-2585Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Polyclonal rabbit antibodies raised against chicken HSF2 (αHSF2α and αHSF2δ) or chicken HSF1 (αHSF1γ) (kindly provided by A. Nakai) or human HSF1 (PA3–017) (Affinity BioReagents) were used. Whole cell extracts (20 μg of protein) were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (10% polyacrylamide), and proteins were electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham). The filters were blocked with 5% skim milk in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST) for 1 h at room temperature and incubated with primary antibodies (1:2000 dilution) in PBST containing 2% skim milk for 1 h at room temperature. After washing with PBST, the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat F(ab′)2 anti-rabbit antibody (1:2000 dilution) (Biosource) for 1 h at room temperature. Following washing with PBST again, signals were detected using ECL reagent (Amersham) and quantified with Intelligent Quantifier (Bio Image). Acquisition of HSE binding activity of HSF2 and transcription induction of the hsp70 gene were examined in hemin-treated K562 cells by Northern blotting, Western blotting, and gel mobility shift analysis (Fig. 1). mRNA levels of hsp70 increased 1.8-, 4.5-, and 10.3-fold by 15, 30, and 60 μm hemin treatment for 12 h, respectively, and 7.8-fold by heat shock (42 °C for 1 h) (Fig. 1 A, lanes 1–5). When K562 cells were treated with 60 μm hemin, 4.0-fold accumulation of hsp70 mRNA was observed at 6 h, and the maximum level (8.5-fold) was attained at 12 h (lanes 6, 8, and 9). The transcripts of grp78also increased 4.5–6.6-fold (lanes 1, 4, 6, and 9) with 60 μm hemin at 12 h. The maximum level of HSE binding was observed in the cells treated with 60 μm hemin for 12 h (Fig. 1 C, lanes 4 and 9), and the induction of the HSE binding activities was correlated well with the increase of hsp70 mRNA. These results were consistent with the observations reported previously (20Theodorakis N.G. Zand D.J. Kotzbauer P.T. Williams G.T. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 3166-3173Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 21Sistonen L. Sarge K.D. Phillips B. Abravaya K. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4104-4111Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). It has been reported that the amount of HSF2 is enhanced during hemin treatment (32Sistonen L. Sarge K.D. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2087-2099Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 33Leppa S. Pirkkala L. Saarento H. Sarge K.D. Sistonen L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15293-15298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). By Western blot analysis, we also confirmed increase of the HSF2 level in K562 cells upon treatment with 30 and 60 μm hemin for 12 h (Fig. 1 B). Moreover, increase of slower migrating forms of HSF1 was observed in the hemin-treated cells; the extent of mobility change seemed to depend on the hemin concentration (Fig. 1 B, lanes 1–4), as has been observed with HSF1 hyperphosphorylated upon heat shock (lane 5 and Ref. 11Sarge K.D. Murphy S.P. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1392-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). The upper band was observed between 3 and 24 h of hemin treatment (lanes 7–10). Because hyperphosphorylation has been shown to be required to render HSF1 transcriptionally competent (34Cotto J.J. Kline M. Morimoto R.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3355-3358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 35Xia W. Voellmy R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4094-4102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), these results raised the possibility that hemin induces HSF1 hyperphosphorylation leading to hsp70 transcription. To examine which HSF is involved in the hemin-induced HSE binding complexes, we treated cell extracts with specific antisera raised against HSF1 or HSF2 and performed gel mobility shift analysis. As shown in Fig. 2, only a small part of the HSE binding complexes induced by 30 or 60 μm hemin were recognized by HSF2 antiserum (lanes 2–4 and 9–11) under the conditions that caused complete supershift for overexpressed HSF2–HSE complex (lanes23–25) but not for heat shock-induced complex (lanes 16–18). On the other hand, almost all complexes observed in the hemin-treated cell extract were recognized by HSF1 antiserum (lanes 5–7 and 12–14) as well as those observed in the heat-shocked cell extract (lanes 19–21), although the supershift seemed to be somewhat limited as compared with that observed in the heat-shocked cell extract (compare lanes 13 and 20). These results clearly indicated that the hemin-induced HSE binding complexes consist of both HSF1 and HSF2, the majority being HSF1. We then examined which HSF is involved in the transcriptional activation induced in hemin-treated K562 cells by luciferase reporter assay. Constructs HSF2N96 and HSF1N101 have almost full-length of the coding regions of HSF2 and HSF1, respectively, except for their DNA binding domains that were replaced by GAL4-BD (30Yoshima T. Yura T. Yanagi H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 240: 228-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Constructs similar to HSF1N101 had been shown to respond to heat shock and activate transcription of appropriate reporter genes (26Zuo J. Rungger D. Voellmy R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4319-4330Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 27Shi Y. Kroeger P.E. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4309-4318Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 36Green M. Schuetz T.J. Sullivan E.K. Kingston R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3354-3362Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The heat shock regulatory domain of HSF1 was substituted for the corresponding region of HSF2 and vice versa, to yield chimeric constructs (Fig. 3 A). DNA binding activity of these constructs in K562 cells was confirmed by gel mobility shift assay using a single GAL4 binding site as a probe (Fig. 3 B). The transactivation activity of construct HSF2N96 was entirely repressed under normal conditions and was not induced significantly by exposure to hemin or heat shock (Fig. 3 A, lane 2). The chimeric construct HSF2+1N96 also showed little response to hemin or heat shock (lane 3). It is noteworthy that HSF2+1N96 containing the heat shock regulatory domain of HSF1, which had been shown to be able to confer heat responsiveness to a heterologous transactivation domain (28Newton E.M. Knauf U. Green M. Kingston R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 839-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), failed to activate transcription upon heat shock. As both constructs contain the negative regulatory 18-amino acid segment that suppresses the C-terminal transactivation domain of HSF2 (25Yoshima T. Yura T. Yanagi H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2580-2585Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), these results suggest that the negative segment of HSF2 is fully functional in hemin- or heat shock-treated K562 cells regardless of the regulatory domain of HSF1. On the other hand, construct HSF1N101 elevated the reporter expression 3- and 10-fold in response to hemin and heat shock, respectively (lane 4). Furthermore, construct HSF1+2N101 lacking the heat shock regulatory domain was deregulated and resulted in constitutive activation of the reporter (lane 5). Thus, HSF2 did not show any distinct response to hemin and heat shock, whereas HSF1 responded well to both stimuli, at least under the conditions that GAL4-BD was used as a DNA binding domain. To further address the involvement of HSF1 in hemin-induced transcription of thehsp70 gene, exogenous HSF1 or HSF2 was transiently expressed in K562 cells, and expression of the cotransferred HSE-containing luciferase gene was examined. As shown in Fig. 4 A, the reporter response of the HSF2-transfected cells was quite similar to that of the mock-transfected cells, which represents the response mediated by endogenous HSFs. In contrast, transiently expressed HSF1 markedly enhanced the reporter response not only to heat shock but to hemin treatment (30 and 60 μm) as well. When whole cell extracts prepared from the above transfected cells were examined by gel mobility shift analysis, the binding of transiently expressed HSF1 was markedly increased by treatment with either hemin or heat shock (Fig. 4 B, lanes 4 versus 6 and 7 versus 9). No such increase in binding was detected with the HSF2-expressing cells (lanes 4 versus 5 and 7 versus 8). The transient expression of HSF2 or HSF1 was confirmed by Western blotting, indicating increased amounts of each protein in the respective transfected cells (Fig. 4 B, lower panels). These results also suggest that HSF1, rather than HSF2, is activated to stimulate transcription of thehsp70 gene in hemin-treated K562 cells. As we failed to detect hemin responsiveness of the K562 cells that had been transiently transfected with expression plasmids for GAL4–HSF2 fusion protein or intact HSF2 (Figs. 3 and 4), stable HSF2 overexpression cell lines were established to exclude the possibility that the expression levels were insufficient in those transient expression systems. The HSF2 expression levels in the stable lines used were 53-fold (clone 86–1) and 37-fold (clone 86–5) higher than that of the wild-type K562 cells (Fig. 5 B). The overexpressed HSF2 resulted in constitutive HSE binding (Fig. 5 C, lanes 1–3). However, the amounts of hsp70 and grp78 transcripts were not significantly elevated in these cell lines (Fig. 5 A, lanes 1–3). Moreover, although the amount of HSF DNA binding increased further by hemin treatment (Fig. 5 C, lanes 4–12), the extent of stimulation of hsp70or grp78 transcription was not significantly higher than with the parent cells (WT) (Fig. 5 A, lanes 4–12). On the contrary, overexpression of HSF2 seemed to be rather inhibitory to hemin-induced activation of hsp70transcription (lanes 10–12). Thus, not only did the massive production of HSF2 fail to contribute to the hemin-induced activation of hsp70 transcription, but it was demonstrated that it can inhibit transcription perhaps by competing with HSF1 in binding to HSE on the hsp70 promoter. We have shown that HSF1 is primarily involved in transcriptional activation of the hsp70 gene in hemin-treated K562 cells. It has been thought that HSF2 is probably the transcription factor responsible for hsp70 expression during hemin-induced differentiation because DNA binding of HSF2 increases upon hemin treatment. However, transiently overexpressed GAL4-BD–HSF2 chimeric protein or intact HSF2 failed to respond to hemin and activate transcription of the reporter gene containing a GAL4 binding site or HSE, respectively (Fig. 4 A). Furthermore, in stably HSF2-overexpressing cells, the control or hemin-induced levels of hsp70 transcription was not significantly higher than in the mock-transfected cells (Fig. 5), despite the constitutive HSF2 binding to HSE (Figs. 2 and 5). On the other hand, GAL4-BD–HSF1 chimeric protein responded to both heat shock and hemin treatment and stimulated expression of the reporter gene (Fig. 3). Transiently overexpressed HSF1 also augmented the hemin-induced expression of the HSE-containing luciferase reporter in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4 A). In addition, the majority of hemin-induced HSE binding complexes was shown to be HSF1 (Fig. 2), which presumably was partially phosphorylated as observed in heat-shocked cells (Fig. 1 B). These results taken together strongly suggest that HSF1 but not HSF2 primarily mediates the hemin-induced transcriptional activation of thehsp70 gene in K562 cells. The results presented here are apparently inconsistent with the previous reports. Sistonen et al. (21Sistonen L. Sarge K.D. Phillips B. Abravaya K. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4104-4111Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) reported that the hemin-induced HSE binding complexes observed in gel mobility shift analysis completely disappear with HSF2 antiserum but are only slightly affected with HSF1 antiserum. They also found that overexpression of HSF2-α isoform, which had been shown to function as a transcription activator (37Goodson M.L. Park-Sarge O.-K. Sarge K.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5288-5293Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), enhanced hemin-induced heat shock gene expression (33Leppa S. Pirkkala L. Saarento H. Sarge K.D. Sistonen L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15293-15298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). It should be noted that HSF2 we used here was HSF2-α isoform but not β isoform, which had been reported to suppress hemin-induced expression of HSP70 (33Leppa S. Pirkkala L. Saarento H. Sarge K.D. Sistonen L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15293-15298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). These apparent contradictions might be explained on the basis of heterogeneity of K562 cells. Among the three known subtypes of K562 cells (38Dimery I.W. Ross D.D. Testa J.R. Gupta S.K. Felsted R.L. Pollak A. Bachur N.R. Exp. Hematol. 1983; 11: 601-610PubMed Google Scholar), we used B-subtype, which has a moderate responsiveness to hemin to differentiate. The HSF responsiveness to hemin probably varies among K562 cells maintained in different laboratories. As Sistonenet al. (32Sistonen L. Sarge K.D. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2087-2099Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) also observed slight but significant trimer formation and partial phosphorylation of HSF1 upon hemin treatment, it is likely that their cell line was barely able to activate HSF1 in response to hemin. The slightly activated HSF1 might be enough to stimulate hsp70 transcription. In any event, the findings that hsp70 transcription does not increase in HSF2-overexpressing K562 cells despite its constitutive DNA binding (Fig. 5 and Ref. 33Leppa S. Pirkkala L. Saarento H. Sarge K.D. Sistonen L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15293-15298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) suggest that the acquisition of HSF2 DNA binding activity is insufficient and that an additional regulatory step is required to activate transcription of heat shock genes as in the case of HSF1 (39Hensold J.O. Hunt C.R. Calderwood S.K. Housman D.E. Kingston R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1600-1608Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 40Price B.D. Calderwood S.K. Mol. Cell.

It is possible that the cell line we used lacks the activity to convert the DNA binding form of HSF2 to a transcriptionally competent state. Alternatively, HSF2 may not bind to HSE of thehsp70 promoter in our K562 cell line as seen in unstressed F9 cells (23Murphy S.P. Gorzowski J.J. Sarge K.D. Phillips B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5309-5317Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In any case, HSF2 activation may not be essential during differentiation of K562 cells because apparent hemoglobin synthesis was observed in our experimental conditions (data not shown). Proteasome inhibitors including peptide aldehydeN-acetyl-leucyl-leucyl-norleucinal and lactacystin induce HSF1 trimerization and hsp70 transcription (45Zhou M. Wu X. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24769-24775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), suggesting that accumulation of short-lived proteins that are normally degraded by proteasome induces hsp70 transcription via activation of HSF1. Interestingly, hemin can also inhibit ATP-dependent ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis at 25 μm (43Etlinger J.D. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4563-4568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,44Haas A.L. Rose I.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 6845-6848Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), which is comparable with what we employed to induce differentiation of K562 cells. It seems likely, therefore, that hemin can activate HSF1 through inhibiting proteolysis, leading tohsp70 transcription. Furthermore, the observation that GRP78 was induced by hemin with a kinetics similar to that of HSP70 induction can be explained by the recent finding that endoplasmic reticulum-resident chaperones (e.g. GRP78), as well as HSP70, are induced by various proteasome inhibitors (46Bush K.T. Goldberg A.L. Nigham S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9086-9092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). We thus conclude that the HSP70 induction in hemin-treated K562 cells is primarily mediated by HSF1, which is presumably activated upon accumulation of abnormal proteins resulting from inhibition of proteasome activity. Although we failed to demonstrate any positive contribution of HSF2 in hemin-induced hsp70 transcription in K562 cells, it remains quite possible that HSF2 plays some roles during early development and differentiation. Because the inability of HSF2 to activate transcription from promoters carrying HSE has also been reported with other systems, including embryonal carcinoma cells (23Murphy S.P. Gorzowski J.J. Sarge K.D. Phillips B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5309-5317Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and early embryos (24Rallu M. Loones M. Lallemand Y. Morimoto R. Morange M. Mezger V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2392-2397Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), some unknown steps or conditions must be required for HSF2 transactivation capability. We recently suggested that HSF2 is negatively regulated in K562 cells by unknown factor(s) interacting with the negative regulatory motif adjacent to the C-terminal transactivation domain of HSF2 (25Yoshima T. Yura T. Yanagi H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2580-2585Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The gel mobility shift analyses indicated that the presumptive factor(s) are able to interact with a DNA binding form of HSF2 (25Yoshima T. Yura T. Yanagi H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2580-2585Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Further characterization of this and other factor(s) would provide a promising approach in elucidating the mechanism of HSF2 activation.

PAX genes encode a group of transcription factors that have been isolated based on their homology to Drosophila segmentation genes (reviewed in Stuart et al. (2Stuart E.T. Kioussi C. Gruss P. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1993; 27: 219-236Google Scholar)). The protein products of PAXgenes contain a conserved 128-amino acid DNA-binding motif termed the paired-box domain, and are grouped into four classes on the basis of their structural similarity and pattern of expression (2Stuart E.T. Kioussi C. Gruss P. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1993; 27: 219-236Google Scholar).PAX2 is most similar in structure to PAX5 and PAX8 (reviewed in Stuart and Gruss (4Stuart E.T. Gruss P. Hum. Mol.

Each PAX gene is critically required for development of specific organs or tissues (2Stuart E.T. Kioussi C. Gruss P. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1993; 27: 219-236Google Scholar). PAX2 is expressed in the developing urogenital tract, spinal cord, midbrain, hindbrain, ear, and optic nerve (5Dressler G.R. Deutsch U. Chowdhury K. Nornes H.O. Gruss P.

Eccles M.R. Richards R.I. J. Med. Genet. 1997; 34: 213-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). As with many developmental genes, the timing and level of expression of PAX2 is critical for normal tissue development. Constitutive expression of Pax2 in transgenic mice results in multicystic and dysplastic kidneys in 18-day gestation fetuses and newborn pups (15Dressler G.R. Wilkinson J.E. Rothenpieler U.W. Patterson L.T. Williams-Simons L. Westphal H. Nature. 1993; 362: 65-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). In contrast, repression of Pax2 by antisense oligonucleotides in embryonic kidney organ culture inhibits condensation of mesenchyme cells and their subsequent conversion to epithelium (16Rothenpieler U.W. Dressler G.R. Development. 1993; 119: 711-720PubMed Google Scholar). Following differentiation, PAX2 expression is down-regulated in every tissue except gonads (5Dressler G.R. Deutsch U. Chowdhury K. Nornes H.O. Gruss P. Development. 1990; 109: 787-795PubMed Google Scholar, 6Nornes H.O. Dressler G.R. Knapik E.W. Deutsch U. Gruss P. Development. 1990; 109: 797-809PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, persistent expression of PAX2 in tissues wherePAX2 is normally down-regulated is associated with pathological conditions. For example, PAX2 is expressed in patients with multicystic dysplastic kidneys, a relatively common congenital kidney anomaly in children (17Winyard P.J.D. Risdon A. Sams V.R. Dressler G.R. Woolf A.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 451-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 18Feather S.A. Winyard P.J. Dodd S. Woolf A.S. Nephrol. Dial. Transplant. 1997; 12: 1354-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In addition,PAX2 expression accompanies regeneration of kidney tissue following toxic stress injury (19Groene H-J. Schwabe G.C. Walther C. Gruss P. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1993; 4: 465Google Scholar). Typically, it has been found that PAX2 expression accompanies high rates of cell division. PAX gene products have the potential for cellular transformation, and can be classified as proto-oncogenes (4Stuart E.T. Gruss P. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1995; 4: 1717-1720Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Deregulation and over expression of PAX genes promotes cell focus formation in vitroand tumorigenicity in nude mice (20Maulbecker C.C. Gruss P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2361-2367Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). PAX2 is expressed in Wilms' tumor (21Dressler G.R. Douglass E.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1179-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 22Eccles M.R. Wallis L.J. Fidler A.E. Spurr N.K. Goodfellow P.J. Reeve A.E. Cell Growth Differ. 1992; 3: 279-289PubMed Google Scholar, 23Eccles M.R. Yun K. Reeve A.E. Fidler A.E. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 146: 40-45PubMed Google Scholar), a childhood renal tumor of embryonic origin, and is also expressed in a proportion of renal cell carcinomas (24Gnarra J.R. Dressler G.R. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4092-4098PubMed Google Scholar), an adult cancer derived from proximal tubules. Antisense oligonucleotides against PAX2 have been shown to specifically inhibit renal cancer cell proliferation (24Gnarra J.R. Dressler G.R. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4092-4098PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, the above studies suggest that PAX2 gene expression is tightly controlled during development, and that in certain pathological states PAX2 is abnormally regulated. There is, however, little known about mechanisms of PAX2regulation. To facilitate the identification of cis- and trans-regulatory factors important for transcriptional regulation of PAX2, we have isolated the minimal humanPAX2 promoter. The basic features of this promoter were characterized, including three different transcription start sites, one from fetal kidney and two in Wilms' tumor. These start sites were located 686 bp1 (fetal kidney), 679 bp, and 804 bp (Wilms' tumor) upstream of the translational start. The human PAX2 promoter is GC-rich, TATA-less and CCAAT-less, with striking homology to the mousePax2 promoter. Our results suggest that the minimalPAX2 promoter is an evolutionally conserved constitutively active promoter that is modulated by distally located sequences. pRL-TK (Promega), a plasmid expressingRenilla luciferase, was included in each transfection at a ratio of 1:40 as an internal standard to normalize luciferase assay results within transfection experiments. WT1 expression constructs were gifted by Dr. Kiyoshi Miyagawa and contained four isoforms of murine WT1 cDNA, with and without the alternatively spliced exon 5, and the “KTS” amino acids in exon 9 (25Haber D.A. Sohn R.L. Buckler A.J. Pelletier J. Call K.M. Housman D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9618-9622Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). Each cDNA, including the entire coding region, plus 5′- and 3′-flanking sequences, was cloned into the XbaI site in the vector RcCMV (Invitrogen). WT1 expressed proteins were detectable from each construct by immunohistochemistry. 2K. Miyagawa, personal communication. The human PAX2 gene promoter was isolated from a genomic bacteriophage lambda clone, λ11a, which had previously been shown to contain approximately 10 kb of sequences upstream of PAX2 (26Sanyanusin P. Norrish J.H. Ward T.A. Nebel A. McNoe L.A. Eccles M.R. Genomics. 1996; 35: 258-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). A 2-kb BamHI DNA fragment was purified from clone λ11a, and subcloned into the BglII site of an engineered pGL2-basic vector (Promega), modified so that it contained a novel NcoI restriction site in the cloning cassette between the BglII and HindIII sites. Digestion of the pGL2-basic-PAX2 construct (called pGPxp1) withNcoI removed sequences downstream of the PAX2 ATG translation start site, creating the construct pGPxp2. Clone pGPxp17, which contains 4.2 kb of thePAX2 promoter and 5′-flanking sequences, was generated with the following steps. A 3-kb ApaI fragment was isolated from λ11a, and cloned into the ApaI site of pBluescript-KS (Stratagene) to create clone pBPpx16. Clone pGPxp2 was digested withKpnI and religated, removing 5′-sequences, in order to generate clone pGPxp3. A 2.9-kb KpnI fragment of PAX2 5′-flanking DNA was then removed from clone pBPxp16 and inserted in the 5′ to 3′ orientation into the KpnI site of pGPxp3, to generate clone pGPxp17 (now containing 4.2 kb of continuous sequence). Plasmid pGPxp2 was sequenced by constructingExoIII nested deletion clones (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). All sequencing was dideoxy chain termination sequencing of double stranded DNA (27Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52749) Google Scholar) using a Sequenase Version 2.0 kit (U. S. Biochemicals), or using an ABI 373 automated sequencer and dye terminators following the manufacturer's instructions. Riboprobes for RNase protection studies were the following fragments. A positive control SmaI-PstI fragment (+190 to +370) and a SmaI fragment (−290 to +190).PAX2 promoter fragments were subclones in either pGEM or pBluescript vectors. Labeled probes were generated as described previously (23Eccles M.R. Yun K. Reeve A.E. Fidler A.E. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 146: 40-45PubMed Google Scholar, 28Ward T.A. Nebel A. Reeve A.E. Eccles M.R. Cell Growth. Differ. 1994; 5: 1015-1021PubMed Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated from Wilms' tumors or human fetal kidneys of approximately 12–15 weeks of gestation using the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (29Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63228) Google Scholar). RNase protection assays were carried out essentially as described previously (30Ansubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Siedman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley Interscience, New York1989Google Scholar, 31Krieg P.A. Melton D.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 155: 397-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). Hybridization of riboprobes to RNA was done in a 30-μl reaction containing 5 × 104 to 1.3 × 105 cpm of probe and 15 or 30 μg of total sample RNA. All samples were made up to a 30-μg total RNA concentration with yeast tRNA. Control samples contained 30 μg of yeast tRNA alone. Transcription start sites were identified by 5′-RACE, using a modification (32Chen Z. Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 3Google Scholar) of the protocol from the 5′-AmpliFINDERTMRACE kit (CLONTECH). 5 pmol of aPAX2-specific primer 5R (5′-GCC CCC GCC CCC GGA AAA GGC AG-3′) was annealed to 4 μg of total RNA, in a solution containing 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA. The solution was denatured at 70 °C for 5 min, followed by incubation at 65 °C for 20 min. Reverse transcription was carried out at 42 °C for 1 h, followed by 51 °C for 30 min in a 40-μl volume containing 200 units of SuperScript IITM RNaseH− reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.). Remaining conditions and reagents were as described previously (30Ansubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Siedman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley Interscience, New York1989Google Scholar). Approximately one-fourth of the purified single-stranded cDNA was ligated at 22 °C for 16 h to 4 pmol of AmpliFINDER Anchor (CLONTECH) (5′-P-CAC GAA TTC ACT ATG CAT TCT GGA ACC TTC AGA GG-H3N-3′) in a solution containing 5 units of T4 RNA ligase, using the single-stranded ligation buffer supplied byCLONTECH. One μl of a 1:10-fold dilution of the ligated cDNA was used in a first round of PCR amplification in reactions containing 1 mm MgCl2, 62.5 μm dNTPs, 0.06 μm of each primer: anchor primer (5′-CTG GTT CGG CCC ACC TCT GAA GGT TCC AGA ATC GAT AG-3′), and PAX2-specific primer 5R, 1 unit of AmpliTaq GoldTM (Perkin-Elmer), and a final concentration of 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.3, 50 mm KCl. The PCR conditions consisted of one cycle of a 10-min activation at 95 °C, followed by 14 cycles of 20 s at 95 °C, 20 s at 68 °C, and 40 s at 72 °C. A second round of hemi-nested PCR was then carried out with 1 μl from the first PCR reaction in a solution containing 1 mm MgCl2, 62.5 μmdNTPs, 20 pmol of each primer: anchor primer, and 1R (5′- GAG CCG AGC GGC GCT GGC AGC TCT G-3′), 1 unit of Pwo polymerase (Boehringer Mannheim), and buffer to a final concentration of 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.85, 25 mm KCl, 5 mm (NH4)2SO4. The PCR conditions consisted of one cycle of 1 min at 95 °C, followed by 40 cycles of 20 s at 95 °C, 20 s at 68 °C, and 40 s at 72 °C. COS-7, NIH-3T3, 293, and MDCK cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). MDCK and 293 cells were previously shown to express PAX2endogenously. 3C. K. Stayner, H. E. Cunliffe, M. C. French, and M. R. Eccles, unpublished results. All four cell lines were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified environment with 5% CO2. Cells were cultured in either Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with high glucose (COS-7, 293, and NIH-3T3) or minimal essential medium with Earle's salts (MDCK), supplemented with either 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) (COS-7, 293, and MDCK) or 10% calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) for NIH-3T3 cells and 1% gentamycin sulfate. Transfections were carried out using FuGene 6 reagent (Boehringer Mannheim) in the presence of 10% serum without antibiotics as follows. Cells (5 × 105) were seeded into 60-mm dishes and transfected when approximately 50–60% confluent (for all cell types), 16–18 h later. Cells were harvested 24 h after transfection. Plasmid DNA for transient transfection was prepared using QIAGEN tips (QIAGEN, Chatsworth, CA), using the manufacturer's recommendations under sterile conditions. A total of 2.05 μg of DNA were used in transfections to analyze the PAX2 promoter deletion series of constructs. These reactions contained 2 μg of PAX2promoter-reporter firefly luciferase plasmid plus 0.05 μg of internal control Renilla luciferase plasmid. Alternatively, for co-transfection experiments a total of 4.05 μg of DNA were used. The reactions contained 1 μg of PAX2 promoter-reporter firefly luciferase plasmid and either 3 μg of pBluescript DNA (Stratagene) or 3 μg of WT1 expression plasmid, plus 0.05 μg of internal controlRenilla luciferase plasmid. The DNA solutions were combined at a 1:3 ratio with FuGene 6 reagent (e.g. 4.05 μg of DNA to 12 μl of FuGene 6) for transfection of each cell line. The cells were overlaid with this mixture, in a final volume of 2 ml of medium, for 24 h prior to lysis. Cell lysates were assayed for luciferase production using firefly and Renilla luciferase dual assay reagents (Promega) following the manufacturer's instructions. Transfections were done in duplicate or triplicate on a minimum of three separate occasions. Luminescence was measured with a BioOrbit 1253 luminometer. To identify potential cis-acting regulatory elements in the humanPAX2 gene promoter, genomic DNA encompassing PAX25′-flanking sequences was isolated from bacteriophage λ clone λ11a (26Sanyanusin P. Norrish J.H. Ward T.A. Nebel A. McNoe L.A. Eccles M.R. Genomics. 1996; 35: 258-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and used to generate clone pGPxp2 (see Fig. 1 A, and “Experimental Procedures”). The sequence from the insert of clone pGPxp2, which contained a 1.7-kb BamHI-NcoI fragment of thePAX2 5′-flanking region (Fig. 1 B) revealed a high GC content (68%), and was found to overlap with the longest previously isolated clone of the human PAX2 cDNA. Several inconsistencies in the sequence were identified between the sequence reported here and the PAX2 cDNA 5′-leader sequence that we previously reported (22Eccles M.R. Wallis L.J. Fidler A.E. Spurr N.K. Goodfellow P.J. Reeve A.E. Cell Growth Differ. 1992; 3: 279-289PubMed Google Scholar). These inconsistencies arose as a result of ambiguities in the sequence of the earlier cDNA clone, due to the very high GC content of this region. The ambiguities have now been resolved in this sequence. Consensus binding sites in thePAX2 promoter sequence were identified for transcription factors, such as PEA3, NF-IL6, NF-κB, EGR-1, and SP1 (Fig. 1 B). To localize the position of thePAX2 transcription start site(s), sequences of thePAX2 promoter between −290 and +370 including 5′-leader sequences of PAX2 mRNA, were analyzed by RNase protection analysis. Although human fetal kidneys were available as a source of tissue in which PAX2 transcripts were expressed, the scarcity of available kidneys precluded their use as a source of large quantities of RNA, as would be required for RNase protection experiments. In contrast, Wilms' tumor was thought to be a suitable tissue to provide large quantities of RNA, because Wilms' tumors recapitulate fetal kidney development, and PAX2 is expressed in Wilms' tumor tissue (22Eccles M.R. Wallis L.J. Fidler A.E. Spurr N.K. Goodfellow P.J. Reeve A.E. Cell Growth Differ. 1992; 3: 279-289PubMed Google Scholar). Because of the close relationship between Wilms' tumors and fetal kidney development, it was expected that thePAX2 transcription start site in Wilms' tumor would be identical to that in human fetal kidney. One Wilms' tumor was chosen that strongly expressed PAX2, as determined by Northern blot (data not shown). A SmaI-PstI fragment of the PAX2cDNA (refer to “Experimental Procedures”) was fully protected in RNase protection assays (Fig. 2 A) of Wilms' tumor RNA, indicating that there are no transcription start sites within this fragment. In contrast, a more distal SmaI fragment of PAX2, (refer to “Experimental Procedures”), including sequences beyond the 5′ end of the longest PAX2 cDNA clone (22Eccles M.R. Wallis L.J. Fidler A.E. Spurr N.K. Goodfellow P.J. Reeve A.E. Cell Growth Differ. 1992; 3: 279-289PubMed Google Scholar), was partially protected in RNase protection assays of Wilms' tumor RNA (Fig. 2 A). These experiments suggested that a potential transcription start site in Wilms' tumor RNA was located 124 nucleotides upstream from the start of the longest previous cDNA clone (Fig. 2 C, asterisk). A longer exposure of the gel revealed a second protected band at a higher molecular weight, out of range of the sequencing ladder, suggesting the presence of another possible start site in Wilms' tumor RNA (data not shown). To more precisely map the region of the putativePAX2 transcription start site in Wilms' tumor RNA, primer extension analysis and 5′-RACE were performed. Primer extension analysis using Wilms' tumor RNA was unsuccessful, possibly due to the high GC content of this region. 5′-RACE experiments however, yielded two tumor-specific PCR products. Wilms' tumor RNA, which had been primed with the PAX2-specific primer 5R (see Fig. 2 C), was reverse transcribed and amplified using a modified 5′-RACE protocol (see “Experimental Procedures”). Southern blots of the amplified products obtained from six separate PCR amplifications of the reverse transcribed Wilms' tumor RNA were hybridized using aPAX2-specific probe (4R). These studies indicated that several PAX2-related sequences had been amplified. The products of the 5′-RACE PCR reactions, which consistently revealed two bands of approximately 125 and 250 bp by Southern analysis, were subcloned and sequenced. From a total of 15 clones, 8/9 were identified that initiated from an adenosine (T1, +8, Figs. 1 B and 2 C). This start site lies within a sequence which is a direct match to an Initiator consensus sequence (Py Py A+1N(T/A) Py Py) as reported by Javahery et al. (34Javahery R. Khachi A. Lo K. Zenzie-Gregory B. Smale S.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 116-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar), and is at the optimal position of transcription initiation within this motif. Of the remaining six cloned PCR products, five were found to initiate from the distal transcription start site at −118 (T2). Two additional clones were obtained that initiated from intermediate sites between the proximal and distal transcription start sites, although these clones may represent incompletely reverse transcribed sequences. We next analyzed PAX2 transcription start sites in human fetal kidney RNA by 5′-RACE to verify whether the transcription start sites of the PAX2 gene in Wilms' tumor RNA corresponded with that in human fetal kidney. In six separate 5′-RACE PCR reactions using fetal kidney total RNA, a single PCR product of approximately 125–130 bp was reproducibly obtained, in comparison to the two bands from Wilms' tumor RNA (Fig. 2 B). This band of approximately 125 bp hybridized with a 4R oligonucleotide probe in a Southern blot (Fig. 2 B). The identity of the transcription start site was confirmed by subcloning and sequencing multiple clones of the single fetal kidney-specific PCR product. 10/10 clones indicated that the PAX2 transcription start site in human fetal kidney (Fig. 2 C, FK, +1) lies within a 5/7-bp match to the mammalian initiator consensus sequence (34Javahery R. Khachi A. Lo K. Zenzie-Gregory B. Smale S.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 116-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). The human and murine (35Ryan G. Steele-Perkins V. Morris J.F Rauscher III, F.J. Dressler G.R. Development. 1995; 121: 867-875Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)PAX2 promoter sequences were aligned for sequence comparison. Over the entire 1,690 bp of human PAX2 promoter there was approximately 80% homology with the mouse Pax2promoter. Less homology (approximately 67%) was observed between −1,010 and −460 in the human sequence relative to the transcription start, but greater homology (approximately 85%) was observed between −460 and +690 (alignment not shown). This high homology may indicate conserved mechanisms of regulation of PAX2 expression. Examples of the degree of sequence similarity between murine and human sequences are illustrated in Figs. 2 C and 4. The sequences immediately surrounding the human transcription start site were compared with the homologous region of the murinePax2 promoter (Fig. 2 C). The human fetal kidneyPAX2 transcription start site was located at precisely the 3′ end of a region containing multiple transcription start sites in mouse Pax2, the 5′ end of which is designated as +1 in the murine Pax2 promoter (Fig. 2 C, M1). To define the minimal DNA sequence required for PAX2 promoter activity, and to analyze DNA sequences important for regulation of PAX2 transcription, transient transfections were performed with a series of deleted DNA fragments encompassing the PAX2promoter, fused to the firefly luciferase reporter gene. The series of deleted promoter fragments used in the transfections is depicted in Fig. 3 A. Each promoter-reporter construct was transiently transfected into four different cell types, MDCK, NIH-3T3, 293, and COS-7 cells, in the presence of a constant amount of the internal control plasmid, pRL-TK. The resulting luciferase reporter gene activities were then measured and normalized to Renilla luciferase activity (Fig. 3 B). Higher levels of reporter gene expression were detected in COS-7 and 293 cells as compared with NIH-3T3 and MDCK cells (Fig. 3 B). In all cell lines, significant basal levels of promoter activity were seen with the construct pExoIII16b, which contains the fetal kidney start site, but not the upstream start site identified in Wilms' tumor. In comparison, a smaller fragment that did not contain the fetal kidney transcription start site had markedly less activity, although activity was not nil (Fig. 3 B). When 5′-flanking sequences were progressively added to the minimalPAX2 promoter-reporter constructs, a significant increase in activity was observed (Fig. 3 B). With each progressive addition of upstream sequences, a profile of promoter activity of the deletion constructs was obtained that was found to be similar in each cell line transfected (Fig. 3 B). When clone pGPxp17, which contained a total of 4.2 kb of continuous 5′-flanking sequences, was transfected into different cell types (see “Experimental Procedures”) there was no increase in activity as compared with pGPxp2, and no cell type specificity was conferred on the regulation of the PAX2 promoter by these sequences. To identify transcription factors important for regulating PAX2activity, we reasoned that the binding sites of such transcription factors would be conserved in both human and mouse PAX2promoter sequences. Consensus binding sites for transcription factors that were conserved between human and mouse sequences included an SP1 site, recognition motifs for NF-IL6, PEA3, and two putative EGR-1-like binding sites (see Figs. 1 and 4). Binding and repression of the mouse Pax2 gene promoter by the Wilms' tumor suppressor gene product, WT1 has previously been reported Ryan et al. (35Ryan G. Steele-Perkins V. Morris J.F Rauscher III, F.J. Dressler G.R. Development. 1995; 121: 867-875Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The corresponding putative WT1 binding sites in the human PAX2 promoter were highly conserved when compared with the WT1 binding sites in the murine promoter (Fig. 4). To determine whether WT1 was able to repress the human PAX2 promoter, NIH-3T3 cells were co-transfected with WT1 expression constructs (all four isoforms), and two PAX2promoter-reporter constructs. In NIH-3T3 cells, the PAX2promoter-reporter plasmid pGPxp2 was rep"
https://openalex.org/W1989163220,"Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) is a dimeric protein that exerts its effects through tyrosine kinase α- and β-receptors. The extracellular part of each receptor is composed of five Ig-like domains. Recombinant forms of α-receptor domains 1–4 (αRD1–4), 1–3 (αRD1–3), and 1 and 2 (αRD1–2) were prepared after expression in Chinese hamster ovary cells and were used to study the assembly of soluble ligand-receptor complexes. When incubated with micromolar concentrations of PDGF, both αRD1–3 and αRD1–4 formed complexes of 1:2 molar composition, i.e. one dimeric PDGF molecule bound two soluble receptors. αRD1–3, in contrast to αRD1–4, formed detectable 1:1 complexes under conditions of ligand excess. αRD1–4 displayed an increased ability to form 1:2 complexes as compared with αRD1–3 under conditions of limiting concentrations of ligand. We thus conclude that Ig-like domain 4-mediated receptor-receptor interactions contribute to 1:2 PDGF·αRD1–4 complex formation. Since αRD1–4 and αRD1–3 were equipotent in blocking binding of subnanomolar concentrations of PDGF to cell-surface receptors, we also conclude that this effect is predominantly achieved through formation of Ig-like domain 4-independent 1:1 ligand-receptor complexes. Finally, since αRD1–2 bound PDGF-BB with high affinity, whereas PDGF-AA was bound only with low affinity, we conclude that Ig-like domain 3 of the PDGF α-receptor contains epitopes of particular importance for PDGF-AA binding and that most of the PDGF-BB-binding epitopes reside in Ig-like domains 1 and 2."
https://openalex.org/W2047893395,"The activation of the gene for interstitial collagenase in myometrial smooth muscle cells is absolutely dependent upon the presence of serotonin. Our previous studies investigating the mechanisms of this induction demonstrated that the mRNAs of both interleukin-1 (IL-1) isoforms, IL-1α and IL-1β, are induced by serotonin and that the induction of IL-1 is required for the subsequent induction of collagenase. These data provided compelling evidence that serotonin-induced IL-1 acts via an autocrine loop in activating the collagenase gene. The experiments described here were designed to examine the potential role of each IL-1 isoform in collagenase production by using neutralizing antisera specific to each isoform of the cytokine. The antisera were examined for their ability to inhibit the serotonin-dependent production of the mRNA for collagenase and of the cytokines themselves. Neutralizing antiserum against IL-1α, but not against IL-1β, inhibited the induction of the mRNA for collagenase and of the mRNAs for both IL-1α and IL-1β. Western analysis indicated that detectable levels of IL-1α protein, but not that of IL-1β, are produced at the time of serotonin-dependent collagenase induction. In contrast, significant levels of IL-1β protein are detected only when bacterial lipopolysaccharide is added to the cells. Taken together, the results of our study indicate that IL-1α, but not IL-1β, plays an obligatory role in multiple serotonin-mediated gene regulations in the myometrial smooth muscle cell. In addition, the data suggest that IL-1β production has the potential for modifying myometrial function in pathological settings, particularly that of uterine infection. The activation of the gene for interstitial collagenase in myometrial smooth muscle cells is absolutely dependent upon the presence of serotonin. Our previous studies investigating the mechanisms of this induction demonstrated that the mRNAs of both interleukin-1 (IL-1) isoforms, IL-1α and IL-1β, are induced by serotonin and that the induction of IL-1 is required for the subsequent induction of collagenase.

The antisera were examined for their ability to inhibit the serotonin-dependent production of the mRNA for collagenase and of the cytokines themselves. Neutralizing antiserum against IL-1α, but not against IL-1β, inhibited the induction of the mRNA for collagenase and of the mRNAs for both IL-1α and IL-1β. Western analysis indicated that detectable levels of IL-1α protein, but not that of IL-1β, are produced at the time of serotonin-dependent collagenase induction. In contrast, significant levels of IL-1β protein are detected only when bacterial lipopolysaccharide is added to the cells. Taken together, the results of our study indicate that IL-1α, but not IL-1β, plays an obligatory role in multiple serotonin-mediated gene regulations in the myometrial smooth muscle cell. In addition, the data suggest that IL-1β production has the potential for modifying myometrial function in pathological settings, particularly that of uterine infection. lipopolysaccharide interleukin 1 receptor antagonist fetal bovine serum kilobase(s). After the delivery of its fetal contents is complete, the mammalian uterus undergoes a remarkable involution, in which all of the collagen that has accumulated during pregnancy is rapidly degraded and removed from the tissue (1Harkness R.D. Moralee B.E. J. Physiol. 1956; 132: 502-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The degradation of fibrillar collagens (Types I, II, and III) is mediated by interstitial collagenase, which catalyzes the initial cleavage in the collagen molecule (2Stricklin G.P. Bauer E.A. Jeffrey J.J. Eisen A.Z. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 1607-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). This cleavage allows further catabolism of the protein by other proteases. We have shown that interstitial collagenase is produced by the myometrial smooth muscle cells during the post-partum period, and not during pregnancy (3Blair H.C. Teitelbaum S.L. Ehlich L.S. Jeffrey J.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1986; 129: 111-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Given its crucial importance in uterine collagen degradation, regulation of the expression of this enzyme and its activity is of major importance to our understanding of the biology of the uterus. We have developed an in vitro system of primary myometrial smooth muscle cells to study the induction and regulation of interstitial collagenase (4Roswit W.T. Halme J. Jeffrey J.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1983; 225: 285-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In this cell culture system, we have shown that serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT), acting as a hormone, is an obligate inducer of interstitial collagenase (5Jeffrey J.J. Ehlich L.S. Roswit W.T. J. Cell. Physiol. 1991; 146: 399-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and that this induction represents an activation of the gene for the enzyme (6Wilcox B.D. Rydelek-Fitzgerald L. Jeffrey J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20752-20757Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This hormonal requirement for serotonin appears to be selective to the smooth muscle cells of the rat and the human (5Jeffrey J.J. Ehlich L.S. Roswit W.T. J. Cell. Physiol. 1991; 146: 399-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Of equal importance, we have shown that serotonin also induces the genes for interleukin-1α, interleukin-1β (7Wilcox B.D. Dumin J.A. Jeffrey J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29658-29664Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and of interleukin-6. 1J. Dumin, B. D. Wilcox, I. Otterness, and J. J. Jeffrey, manuscript in preparation.1J. Dumin, B. D. Wilcox, I. Otterness, and J. J. Jeffrey, manuscript in preparation. These serotonin-dependent inductions occur after the cells have been confluent for approximately 13 days, and we refer to these cells as “spontaneously active.” Until this time, even though the cells are exposed to a concentration of serotonin (∼5 μm) sufficient to saturate all known 5-HT receptors, none of these transcripts, nor collagenase protein, can be detected; we refer to these cells as “early cells.” Early cells, however, doproduce collagenase when bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS)2 is added to the medium, again only in the presence of serotonin (7Wilcox B.D. Dumin J.A. Jeffrey J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29658-29664Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One effect of LPS in these early cells is the induction of the mRNAs for both interleukin-1α and -β. This finding led us to investigate the role of these cytokines in spontaneously activated cells. Using the IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) in the spontaneously active cell setting, we demonstrated that IL-1 is required for the induction of interstitial collagenase, as well as of its own mRNA (7Wilcox B.D. Dumin J.A. Jeffrey J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29658-29664Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and that of both IL-6 mRNA and protein.1 These results indicate that IL-1, acting via an autocrine/paracrine mechanism, is an obligate intermediate in the serotonin-mediated production of collagenase. Since IL-1α and IL-1β mRNAs were induced by serotonin both in early and in spontaneously active cells, we wished to examine whether one or both isoforms of interleukin-1 are involved in these serotonin-dependent inductions. Interleukin-1 (IL-1) is a term used to describe two related polypeptides: IL-1α and IL-1β (8March C.J. Mosley B. Larsen A. Cerretti D.P. Braedt G. Price V. Gillis S. Henney C.S. Kronheim S.R. Grabstein K. Conlon P.J. Hopp D.V. Cosman D. Nature. 1985; 315: 641-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (1192) Google Scholar,9Gray P.W. Glaister D. Chen E. Goeddel D.V. Pennica D. J. Immunol. 1986; 137: 3644-3648PubMed Google Scholar). Both isoforms are synthesized from different genes as 31-kDa precursors. These precursors can then be cleaved by proteases to the mature form of 17 kDa. This cleavage is required for IL-1β to have biological activity and occurs by the IL-1 converting enzyme. In contrast, IL-1α has been shown to have biological activity both as the precursor and as a “mature” form, apparently resulting from a calpain cleavage (for a recent comprehensive review, see Ref. 10Dinarello C.A. Blood. 1996; 87: 2095-2147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Even though the two isoforms share a low amino acid homology, ranging between 20 and 30% (8March C.J. Mosley B. Larsen A. Cerretti D.P. Braedt G. Price V. Gillis S. Henney C.S. Kronheim S.R. Grabstein K. Conlon P.J. Hopp D.V. Cosman D. Nature. 1985; 315: 641-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (1192) Google Scholar), both IL-1α and IL-1β exert their biological activity via the type I IL-1 receptor (IL-1R), (9Gray P.W. Glaister D. Chen E. Goeddel D.V. Pennica D. J. Immunol. 1986; 137: 3644-3648PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, the two proteins have been shown to have very similar biological activities in many cell systems (11Dinarello C.A. Adv. Immunol. 1989; 44: 153-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (992) Google Scholar, 12Di Giovine F.S. Duff G.W. Immunol. Today. 1990; 11: 13-20Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 13Dinarello C.A. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 1314-1325Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Lisak R.P. Bealmear B. Ragheb S. J. Neuroimmunol. 1994; 55: 171-177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), one of which has been the ability of both forms of the cytokine to induce interstitial collagenase and other matrix metalloproteinases in a variety of mesenchymal cells (10Dinarello C.A. Blood. 1996; 87: 2095-2147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, a continuing biological conundrum has existed as to why two isoforms of IL-1 are produced, both of which appear to possess similar if not identical activity. Recently, several investigations have suggested that IL-1α is specifically important in a number of biological settings (14Lisak R.P. Bealmear B. Ragheb S. J. Neuroimmunol. 1994; 55: 171-177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 15West-Mays J.A. Strissel K.J. Sadow P.M. Fini M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell. Mol. Biol. 1995; 13: 602-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Of particular interest, a study by West-Mays et al. (15West-Mays J.A. Strissel K.J. Sadow P.M. Fini M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6768-6772Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), using rabbit corneal fibroblasts reported that the production of collagenase upon stimulation with phorbol esters has also been shown to require the establishment of an IL-1α autocrine loop for the induction of interstitial collagenase. In this study, however, the corneal cells do not produce IL-1β mRNA or protein, and accordingly the cells have no choice in cytokine isoform usage (17Fini W.E. Strissel K.J. Girard M.T. Mays J.W. Rinehart M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11291-11298Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In our own studies (7Wilcox B.D. Dumin J.A. Jeffrey J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29658-29664Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), interleukin-1 has been shown to be a critical intermediate, acting by way of an autocrine loop pathway, in the serotonin-induced gene activation of interstitial collagenase in myometrial smooth muscle cells. Furthermore, the temporal relationships between the regulation of IL-1α and the induction of interstitial collagenase are much more congruent than the analogous relationships between IL-1β and collagenase inductions. In the studies reported here, the differences in the potential of the two IL-1 isoforms to regulate serotonin-mediated induction of IL-1 and collagenase have been examined using isoform-specific antibodies. Mature rat and mouse IL-1α and IL-1β possess 78 and 89% identity, respectively (8March C.J. Mosley B. Larsen A. Cerretti D.P. Braedt G. Price V. Gillis S. Henney C.S. Kronheim S.R. Grabstein K. Conlon P.J. Hopp D.V. Cosman D. Nature. 1985; 315: 641-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (1192) Google Scholar, 9Gray P.W. Glaister D. Chen E. Goeddel D.V. Pennica D. J. Immunol. 1986; 137: 3644-3648PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, polyclonal isoform-specific anti-mouse IL-1 antibodies, which were selected for their neutralizing ability, were utilized. The mouse IL-1β antibody has been shown to inhibit the pyrogenic activity of rat IL-1β in vivo (18Long N.C. Otterness I. Kunkel S.L. Vander A.J. Kluger M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 259: R724-R728PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the IL-1α antibody, although only used in mouse studies in vivo (19Long N.C. Otterness I. Kunkel S.L. Vander A.J. Kluger M.J. Lomax P. Schonbaum E. Thermoregulation: Research and Clinical Applications. Karger, Basel1989: 78-84Google Scholar), has been shown to interact with rat IL-1α by Western blot analysis. 3I. Otterness, unpublished data.3I. Otterness, unpublished data. Also, commercially available rabbit polyclonal, isoform-specific antibodies to rat IL-1 were utilized in parallel with the antibodies described above. The results of experiments using both these neutralizing anti-mouse IL-1 antibodies, as well as commercially obtained anti-rat IL-1 antibodies indicate that, although both IL-1 mRNAs are inducedin vitro by the myometrial smooth muscle cells, only IL-1α is involved in serotonin-dependent collagenase production. Primary cultures of rat myometrial smooth muscle cells were prepared as described previously (20Halme J. Tyree B. Jeffrey J.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1980; 199: 51-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Uteri were obtained from 4-day post-partum Sprague-Dawley rats, minced, and washed free of blood. Uterine tissue was then incubated in 0.05% trypsin in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 30 mmHEPES, 200 units/ml penicillin, and 200 μg/ml streptomycin for 2 h at 37 °C. Tissue fragments were dissociated by forcing the tissue fragments through a fine-bore 10-ml pipette. Tissue was then centrifuged at 50 × g to remove debris. The remaining supernatant was centrifuged at 800 × g to pellet the cells. Cells were resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) that had been adsorbed with dextran-coated charcoal to remove serotonin (CS-FBS (5Jeffrey J.J. Ehlich L.S. Roswit W.T. J. Cell. Physiol. 1991; 146: 399-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 21Schatz F. Gurpide E. Endocrinology. 1983; 113: 1274-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar)), 30 mm HEPES, 200 units/ml penicillin, and 200 μg/ml streptomycin. For all experiments, cells were plated at approximately 100,000 cells per square cm of surface area in 75-cm2culture flasks and allowed to reach confluence, at which time 5 μm serotonin was added to the culture medium until spontaneous up-regulation of collagenase occurred (7Wilcox B.D. Dumin J.A. Jeffrey J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29658-29664Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Other additions to medium are described in detail for each experiment. Isoform-specific neutralizing antisera to mouse interleukin-1 were produced as described previously (18Long N.C. Otterness I. Kunkel S.L. Vander A.J. Kluger M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 259: R724-R728PubMed Google Scholar, 19Long N.C. Otterness I. Kunkel S.L. Vander A.J. Kluger M.J. Lomax P. Schonbaum E. Thermoregulation: Research and Clinical Applications. Karger, Basel1989: 78-84Google Scholar). The antibody against mouse IL-1α was generated in goats. The antibody against mouse IL-1β was produced in rabbits. Isoform-specific rabbit anti-rat antibodies for IL-1α and IL-1β were obtained from Endogen (Cambridge, MA), as was recombinant rat IL-1α. Recombinant murine IL-1α and IL-1β proteins were obtained from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN), which also provided the recombinant rat IL-1β. The isoform specific antisera and antibodies were added directly to cell cultures and allowed to preincubate for 15 min prior to addition of 5 μm serotonin. As a control for the antisera, rabbit non-immune serum was utilized. Cells were also cultured in the presence of 1:500 dilution of goat serum. This addition to the cell cultures had no effect on collagenase production. Statistical significance of the results was determined using a single variable ANOVA. The data presented are compiled from experiments in which the dilutions of antisera varied from 1:200 to 1:500. Poly(A+) RNA was isolated from primary cultures of myometrial smooth muscle cells. Cells were lysed and mRNA isolated directly from cell extracts by modification of a commercial kit (FastTrack™ kit, Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). Poly(A+) RNA samples were denatured with formaldehyde and formamide and electrophoresed on 1.3% agarose gels containing 0.66m formaldehyde for 1 to 2 h as described by Daviset al. (22Davis L.G. Dibner M.D. Battey J.F. Basic Methods in Molecular Biology. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., New York1986: 143-146Crossref Google Scholar). Poly(A+) RNA was transferred overnight to nitrocellulose filter by capillary blotting in 10 × SSC which contains 1.5 m NaCl, 0.15 m trisodium citrate. The blot is baked at 80 °C for 3 h and then prehybridized for 30 min in 4 × SSC, 50% deionized formamide, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 10% dextran sulfate, 200 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA, and 1 × Denhardt's solution which consists of 0.02% Ficoll, 0.02% polyvinylpyrrolidone, 0.02% bovine serum albumin. cDNA probes were radiolabeled with [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol) using the Random Primer Plus Extension Labeling System (NEN Life Science products Inc., Boston, MA). Autoradiographic signals were quantified by video capture and digital image processing using the BioImage system (BioImage/Millipore, Ann Arbor, MI). In all cases, the blots were simultaneously probed with a cDNA to mouse β-actin to provide controls for RNA loading. The variation in actin levels was always less than 15%; nevertheless, all values for specific hybridization were normalized to the values for actin. The interleukin-1α probe is a 2-kb cDNA to mouse IL-1α cloned from mouse DBA/2 P388D1 cells (pmIL1AcDNA; Lomedico et al. (23Lomedico P.T. Gubler U. Hellmann C.P. Dukovich M. Giri J.G. Pan Y-C.E. Collier K. Semionow R. Chua A.O. Mizel S.B. Nature. 1984; 312: 458-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar)). It was obtained through the American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD. The interleukin-1β probe is a 0.3-kb cDNA to rat IL-1β and was a generous gift of Dr. Richard Rohan, University of Maryland School of Medicine. The cDNA probe for rat collagenase is a 2.6-kb clone isolated from a rat osteoblastic cell cDNA library and contains the entire coding region for the active enzyme (UMRcase 54: Quinn et al. (24Quinn C.O. Scott D.K. Brinckerhoff C.E. Matrisian L.M. Jeffrey J.J. Partridge N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 22342-22347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). Conditioned medium harvested from cell cultures was collected, precipitated by ammonium sulfate to 60% saturation, and the precipitate resuspended in 200 μl of 0.05m Tris and 0.01 m calcium chloride and dialyzed overnight against the same buffer. Aliquots (100 μl) were then assayed on reconstituted [14C]glycine-labeled guinea pig skin type I collagen fibrils as described previously (25Nagai Y. Lapiere C.M. Gross J. Biochemistry. 1966; 10: 988-999Google Scholar, 26Jeffrey J.J. Roswit W.T. Ehlich L.E. J. Cell. Physiol. 1990; 143: 396-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Briefly, the pro-enzyme was activated by treatment with trypsin at 25 °C for 10 min. Trypsin action was then terminated by the addition of a 4-fold excess of soybean trypsin inhibitor for 15 min, and the resultant active enzyme was added to the collagen fibrils and incubated at 37 °C. After appropriate substrate digestion had occurred, 250 μl of 0.05 m Tris and 0.01 m calcium chloride was added and the samples were centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min. The radioactivity in the supernatants was determined by scintillation counting. The counts from solubilized collagen are proportional to the collagenase concentration in the medium (25Nagai Y. Lapiere C.M. Gross J. Biochemistry. 1966; 10: 988-999Google Scholar). For titer determination, Western analysis according to the method of Towbin et al. (27Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44644) Google Scholar) was employed. Purified IL-1 was analyzed for isoform specificity using goat anti-mouse IL-1α antisera and rabbit anti-mouse IL-1β antisera. The purified proteins were electrophoresed on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). Membranes were incubated overnight in 1:500 dilution of primary antisera. Alkaline phosphatase-conjugated rabbit anti-goat IgG (Sigma) or goat anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma) was used as secondary antibody at a working dilution of 1:1000 and developed using an alkaline phosphatase substrate kit (Bio-Rad). For detection of IL-1 in the myometrial cells, cultures were rinsed 3 times with phosphate-buffered saline. Cells from a single flask were then scraped into 300 μl of phosphate-buffered saline containing 2 mm EDTA and protease inhibitors (Complete, Mini, Boehringer Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany), subjected to 4 freeze-thaw cycles, and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were recovered and protein concentrations determined by the method of Smith et al.(28Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18349) Google Scholar). Approximately 50 μg of cell lysate protein were electrophoresed on 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). Membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with a 1:200 dilution of polyclonal rabbit anti-rat IL-1α or polyclonal rabbit anti-rat IL-1β (Endogen, Cambridge, MA). A 1:2500 dilution of alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma) was used as a secondary antibody. Membranes were washed and developed with an alkaline phosphatase substrate kit (Bio-Rad). In all experiments, rat myometrial smooth muscle cells were grown to confluence in the absence of serotonin. On day 7 of culture, cells were transferred to medium supplemented with 5 μM serotonin until spontaneous production of collagenase began, as confirmed by enzymatic analysis (cf. “Materials and Methods”). At that time, cells were transferred to serotonin-free medium for 4 days, at which time interstitial collagenase production was reduced to undetectable levels. The flasks were then randomly divided and treated as shown in Fig. 1, A and B, for 24 h. The data in Fig. 1, A and B, represent those obtained from five separate experiments. In all cases, cells were preincubated with antiserum for 15 min prior to the addition of serotonin. Control cells were preincubated with the appropriate non-immune serum at the same dilution of neutralizing antibody used. After 24 h, cells were harvested for mRNA isolation and Northern analysis (A). Conditioned medium was also assayed for collagenolytic activity (B). Cells cultured in the absence of serotonin produced basal levels of collagenase mRNA and activity. Addition of serotonin resulted in the expected massive increase in the production of interstitial collagenase and its mRNA. The serotonin-dependent induction of collagenase mRNA was essentially completely inhibited by addition of antiserum to IL-1α. Similar decreases in the enzymatic activity of collagenase in the culture medium were also observed with treatment of the anti-IL-1α antiserum. Conversely, antiserum to IL-1β did not affect the serotonin-mediated induction of collagenase mRNA or enzymatic activity. Cells cultured in the presence of serotonin and both neutralizing antisera showed a decrease in the levels of collagenase mRNA and in collagenase activity essentially equal to those obtained with anti-IL-1α alone. The data presented in Fig. 1,A and B, is a compilation of experiments in which titers of anti-IL-1 antibodies ranged from 1:200 to 1:500; little or no difference between these dilutions of antibodies was observed. Accordingly, no further titrations were performed, in view of the clear qualitative results obtained with the dilutions employed in the experiments performed. The single experiment depicted in Fig. 1 C represents the time course of the inhibition of collagenase mRNA production by the antisera to the two isoforms of interleukin-1. Cells cultured in the presence of the neutralizing antisera were harvested at 6, 12, and 24 h following incubation with each antiserum. Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated, and Northern analysis was performed. The cells that received medium containing serotonin and antiserum to IL-1α produced, at the very most, 25% of the maximal levels of serotonin-induced collagenase mRNA. In contrast, the induction of collagenase mRNA by cells cultured in serotonin and antiserum to IL-1β produced levels of collagenase mRNA essentially identical to those produced by cells cultured in serotonin only. Thus, a clear specificity for IL-1α appears to exist in the induction of collagenase mRNA. The neutralizing ability of anti-IL-1α has already been documented (18Long N.C. Otterness I. Kunkel S.L. Vander A.J. Kluger M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 259: R724-R728PubMed Google Scholar, 19Long N.C. Otterness I. Kunkel S.L. Vander A.J. Kluger M.J. Lomax P. Schonbaum E. Thermoregulation: Research and Clinical Applications. Karger, Basel1989: 78-84Google Scholar), but the ability of anti-IL-β to neutralize its cognate antigen has not been shown. Accordingly, we examined this issue, and the results of a typical experiments are shown in Fig. 2. This figure illustrates the ability of a 1:300 dilution of anti-IL-1β to inhibit the induction by IL-1β of interstitial collagenase mRNA production by cultured myometrial smooth muscle cells. Nearly complete inhibition was observed, indicating the efficacy of the antibody in neutralizing the activity of the cytokine. Uterine smooth muscle cells were isolated from the rat and cultured in serotonin-free medium until confluence was attained. At this time 5 μm serotonin was added to the medium, and the cells were cultured until they produced collagenase. At that point, the cells were transferred to serotonin-free medium for 4 days. Following the depletion of serotonin, cells were treated with isoform-specific neutralizing anti-IL-1 antisera for 24 h. As shown in Fig. 3, cells cultured in the presence of serotonin resulted in the induction of IL-1α mRNA, which was completely blocked by incubation with the neutralizing antiserum to IL-1α or with the combination of both IL-1α and IL-1β antisera. Cells cultured in the presence of serotonin and antisera to IL-1β displayed only a modest, indeed marginally significant, inhibition of IL-1α mRNA induction. Cultures to which preimmune serum was added displayed no observable effect on IL-1α mRNA levels. Essentially identical results were obtained from studies on the ability of isoform-specific antisera to modulate the levels of IL-1β mRNA (Fig. 4). Serotonin-induced increases in IL-1β mRNA levels were nearly completely inhibited by antiserum to IL-1α. On the other hand, cells that received serotonin and antiserum to the β-isoform produced nearly normal levels of IL-1β mRNA. Thus, these studies suggest that IL-1α regulates not only the expression of its own mRNA, but that of IL-1β as well. To ensure the fidelity of antiserum specificity, Western blot analysis was performed, using purified mouse IL-1α and IL-1β protein and their cognate antibodies (Fig. 5). IL-1α amounts were 0.5 (lane 1), 1 (lane 2), 5 (lane 3), and 10 (lane 4) ng. IL-1β antigen quantities were 0.5 (lane 5), 1 (lane 6), 5 (lane 7), and 10 (lane 8) ng. A 1:500 dilution of IL-1α antiserum or of IL-1β antiserum was used. All incubations and color development were identical for the two blots. The Western blot analysis using the neutralizing antiserum for IL-1α demonstrated no cross-reactivity with IL-1β protein; similarly, the antiserum to IL-1β failed to detect the IL-1α antigen. Interestingly, the IL-1β antiserum could detect its homologous antigen at a much higher sensitivity than did the IL-1α antibody. Quantitative scanning indicates that this “titer,” as determined by Western analysis for the IL-1β antiserum is approximately 10-fold higher than that of the IL-1α antiserum for its antigen. If the extent of these differences in sensitivity on Western blots is reflected in neutralizing potency, the modest effects of antiserum to IL-1β observed in these experiments should be considered as maximal and possibly nonspecific. In an attempt to confirm the results observed with the neutralizing anti-mouse antisera, anti-rat polyclonal antibodies, obtained from a commercial source (Endogen) were utilized. Although the potency of these antibodies was not as high as those of the antisera selected for neutralizing ability, the serotonin-mediated induction of IL-1α, IL-1β, and collagenase mRNA and collagenase activity were modestly inhibited by treatment with the anti-IL-1α antibody, consistent with the results obtained with the specific neutralizing antibodies, whereas no effect was ever observed with equivalent concentrations of anti-IL-1β (data not shown). Myometrial smooth muscle cells were grown to confluence and cultured in serotonin-free media supplemented with 100 ng/ml LPS, 5 μm serotonin, or the combination of both. When cells were verified as producing collagenase, cell cultures were rinsed and cells from a single flask were then scraped into 300 μl of phosphate-buffered saline containing 2 mm EDTA and protease inhibitors, subjected to 4 freeze-thaw cycles, and centrifuged as described under “Materials and Methods.” Supernatants were recovered and approximately 50 μg of cell lysate were examined by Western analysis for the presence of either IL-1α or IL-1β using rat isoform-specific antibodies. The results, gathered in Fig. 6, indicate that in lysates of cells spontaneously producing interstitial collagenase in the presence of serotonin, IL-1α could easily be detected, whereas immunoreactive IL-1β was present at very low levels, if at all. Interestingly, the form of IL-1α detected in these lysates is the unprocessed 31-kDa species, which has been shown to possess full biological activity (for review, see Ref. 10Dinarello C.A. Blood. 1996; 87: 2095-2147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, significant levels of IL-1β protein were found to be induced in parallel with its mRNA, but only when LPS (100 ng/ml) was added to spontaneously active cultures of myometrial smooth muscle cells (Fig. 6 A). In addition, under these conditions, only the non-processed, biologically inactive, 31-kDa form of IL-1β appears to be present and remains cell-associated. No signal was ever observed in the absence of serotonin. In addition, IL-1β was not detectable in the cell culture medium, although clearly seen in cell extracts, as shown in Fig. 6 B. Thus, although serotonin is required for the induction of both IL-1α and IL-1β mRNAs, only IL-1α protein appears to be translated at detectable levels under conditions in which interstitial collagenase is induced. Furthermore, interleukin-1β protein, when induced as a consequence of the presence of bacterial endotoxin, is only observed in an unprocessed, inactive, cell-associated form. Taken together with the immunoneutralization studies, it appears that IL-1α is the requisite isoform of the cytokine for the serotonin-mediated induction of interstitial collagenase. The results of this study demonstrate that IL-1α is a crucial intermediate for a number of serotonin-dependent inductions which occur in the myometrial smooth muscle cells. Primary cultures of rat myometrial smooth muscle cells incubated with antiserum specifically selected for its neutralizing ability to IL-1α resulted in a massive inhibition of collagenase mRNA levels and collagenase protein production. Addition of anti-IL-1β antiserum to cells failed to significantly affect collagenase mRNA or protein production. Furthermore, cells cultured in the presence of anti-IL-1α antiserum resulted in concomitant decreases in the mRNA levels for both IL-1α and IL-1β. The neutralizing antiserum to IL-1β, which has been previously documented to inhibit the in vivo activity of rat IL-1β– and confirmed in the present study to exhibit neutralizing capacity (Fig. 2), had, at most, only a slight inhibitory effect on collagenase mRNA or the mRNAs for either isoform of IL-1. In addition, we have shown in this study that the antiserum against IL-1β effectively neutralizes the ability of IL-1β to induce the production of collagenase by myometrial smooth muscle cells (Fig. 2). In addition, when the titers of these two antisera against their cognate antigens were determined by Western blot analysis, that of the IL-1β antiserum was found to be approximately 10 times higher than that of the IL-1α antibody. Assuming that the neutralizing capacity of the antisera parallel the titers indicated by Western blot, the effect of the IL-1α antiserum are, if anything, underestimated in the experiments described in this study. In addition to the above studies, we have found that the appearance of IL-1α protein (Fig. 6) in our cultured myometrial smooth muscle cells is consistent with both the time course of the induction of interstitial collagenase and the inhibition of collagenase production by the isoform-specific antiserum directed to IL-1α. Since the IL-1β antiserum had little or no effect, and because detection of the rat proteins was limited by the availability of reagents, we initially did not know if IL-1β is being produced by the myometrial smooth muscle cells. The immunochemical studies presented here now indicate that, indeed, IL-1β protein is not produced in our spontaneously active cell setting, even though mRNA levels are induced in these cells cultured with serotonin. Of considerable interest, however, is our ability to detect significant levels of IL-1β protein when LPS is added to the cell culture medium. It appears, however, that even under these conditions in the myometrial cell, IL-1β protein is produced but not processed or secreted (Fig. 6, A and B). Although at this point in our studies, no biological role for IL-1β can be identified, the notion that IL-1β is translated only under conditions of infection is of potential importance to the physiology and pathophysiology of pregnancy. Future studies will concentrate on determining the levels, biological activity of each protein, and to further examine the involvement of each isoform in the myometrial cells. These data, taken as a whole, indicate that IL-1α is a crucial intermediate not only for the serotonin-dependent production of collagenase, but also in the regulation of both IL-1α and of IL-1β themselves in the myometrial smooth muscle cell. Preliminary evidence recently obtained in this laboratory 4J. Dumin, J. L. Sanchez, B. D. Wilcox, and J. J. Jeffrey, unpublished data. indicate that several other serotonin-induced gene inductions are similarly mediated by interleukin-1. These include the genes for IL-6 and for two other members of the matrix metalloproteinase gene family: transin (stromelysin) and 92-kDa gelatinase (gelatinase B). Thus, in our overall model, the activity of serotonin, mediated initially by the 5-HT2A receptor subtype in myometrial cells (29Rydelek-Fitzgerald L. Wilcox B.D. Teitler M. Jeffrey J.J. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1992; 91: 67-74Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar), results in the activation of the gene for IL-1α, after which the induced IL-1α then proceeds to act via either an autocrine or paracrine mechanism to maintain a continuous source of IL-1α (7Wilcox B.D. Dumin J.A. Jeffrey J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29658-29664Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In our system, this interleukin-1 autocrine loop results in multiple gene inductions. The interleukin-1 autocrine loop was originally observed in human smooth muscle cells (30Warner S.J.C. Auger K.R. Libby P. J. Exp. Med. 1987; 165: 1316-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 31Warner S.J.C. Auger K.R. Libby P. J. Immunol. 1987; 139: 1911-1919PubMed Google Scholar). This feedback mechanism of IL-1 production has now been identified in several other cell types. In a study by Loppnow and Libby (32Loppnow H. Libby P. Exp. Cell Res. 1992; 198: 283-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), for example, IL-1 produced by vascular smooth muscle cells elicited an autocrine/paracrine effect on IL-1 levels in naive smooth muscle cells, although no other biological end point was identified in this study. One report, using rabbit corneal fibroblasts has shown an effect possibly analogous to that observed in our myometrial cell system (15West-Mays J.A. Strissel K.J. Sadow P.M. Fini M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6768-6772Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In this study, cells stimulated by either phorbol esters or cytochalasin B require the intermediate action of IL-1α in order for the cells to produce interstitial collagenase. A further similarity of this system to ours is that primary cultures of fibroblasts cannot sustain the IL-1α loop, whereas fibroblasts which have been passaged in culture do continuously produce IL-1α (15West-Mays J.A. Strissel K.J. Sadow P.M. Fini M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6768-6772Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). This transition-dependent production is potentially analogous to the time-dependent up-regulation of interstitial collagenase, IL-1, and IL-6 that occurs in our spontaneously active myometrial cells. These studies further suggest that the establishment of one or more autocrine/paracrine mechanisms of IL-1 induction may be regulated by a time-dependent developmental process, as yet undefined, which is required to sustain the induction of the cytokine. Finally, a recent study (33Singer C.F. Marbaix E. Kokorine I. Lemoine P. Donnez J. Eeckhout Y. Courtoy P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10341-10345Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) using human endometrial cells has shown that IL-1α, but not IL-1β or a variety of other cytokines, is responsible for the induction of interstitial collagenase in endometrial fibroblasts. Thus, there appears to be an accumulating body of evidence implicating IL-1α as a critical mediator of the induction of a variety of genes in biological systems. The myometrial smooth muscle system appears to be one of the emerging models in which only one IL-1 isoform, IL-1α, is utilized to mediate an important cellular process, namely tissue remodeling. It is possible that the myometrial cells when activated with other stimuli, such as bacterial endotoxin in the example described here, may utilize IL-1β for a different purpose. In summary, this study suggests that IL-1α and IL-1β have different roles in myometrial smooth muscle cells stimulated with serotonin and argues to the fact that the two isoforms, which were once thought to possess essentially the same biological activity, will eventually be identified as separately important regulators of cellular activity. We are indebted to Vera Gray for expert preparation of the myometrial smooth muscle cells utilized in this study."

We cloned a dihydropyridine receptor (named Fgα1S) from frog skeletal muscle, where excitation-contraction coupling has been studied most extensively. Fgα1S contains 5600 base pairs coding for 1688 amino acids. It is highly homologous with, and of the same length as, the C-truncated form predominant in rabbit muscle.

In EC1 coupling an action potential activates DHP receptors in the transverse tubular membrane, which somehow open ryanodine receptors in the sarcoplasmic reticulum to release Ca2+ and initiate muscle contraction. The skeletal muscle DHPr is a slowly activating L-type Ca2+channel (2Beam K.G. Adams B.A. Niidome T. Numa S. Tanabe T. Nature. 1992; 360: 169-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) that also controls Ca2+ release, working as a voltage sensor (3Rios E. Brum G.

How DHPrs interact with ryanodine receptors during EC coupling is still not clear. Most experiments on EC coupling have been done in frog skeletal muscle fibers, although the cDNAs of skeletal muscle DHPr have been cloned from rabbit (5Tanabe T. Takeshima H. Mikami A. Flockerzi V.

Gregg R.G. Genomics. 1994; 24: 608-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Functional differences exist between frog and mammalian skeletal muscle DHPrs. Seeking additional insights into the molecular basis of skeletal muscle EC coupling, we cloned and expressed a skeletal muscle DHPr from a frog. The frog DHPr (Fgα1S) was cloned from mRNA of skeletal muscle of Rana catesbeiana by combining RT-PCR with construction and screening of a cDNA library. The molecule has high homology with other DHPrs at transmembrane domains, voltage sensors (5Tanabe T. Takeshima H. Mikami A. Flockerzi V. Takahashi H. Kangawa K. Kojima M. Matsuo H. Hirose T. Numa S.

Neuron. 1993; 11: 1013-1021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Despite those conserved features, Fgα1S has also several differences with known DHPrs. The cloned rabbit skeletal muscle L-type Ca channel has been expressed in dysgenic myotubes (4Tanabe T. Beam K.G. Powell J.A. Numa S. Nature. 1988; 336: 134-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar) and in Xenopus oocytes (10Ren D. Hall L.M. J. Biol.

However, functional expression of this channel in mammalian cell lines has been difficult (11Perez-Reyes E. Kim H.S. Lacerda A.E. Horne W. Wei X.Y. Rampe D. Campbell K.P. Brown A.M. Birnbaumer L.

Neurosci. 1997; 17: 1243-1255Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In our hands, the functional expression of Fgα1S also occurred infrequently. In contrast, a chimera (named α1C-FSDI) of domain I of Fgα1S in a rabbit cardiac background was expressed easily and at high levels. Total RNA samples were isolated from the liver, cardiac, and skeletal muscle of a frog by the acid guanidinium-phenol-chloroform method (15Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63228) Google Scholar). Poly(A)+ RNA was purified from the total RNA by using the Mini-oligo(dT) cellulose spin kit (5 Prime → 3 Prime, Inc., Boulder, CO). Total RNA harvested from frog skeletal muscle was reverse transcribed using random primers. Based on the conserved amino acid sequences of known DHP receptors, two pairs of degenerate primers (C5/C6 and C12/J3) were synthesized for amplifying a cDNA segment (segment 7) between IIIS6 and IVS6 and a segment (segment 6) between IS1 and IIS3 of the channel molecule. Primer C5 (5′-CGCGGAATTC TT(T,C)ATGATGAA(C,T)AT(T,C,A)TT(T,C)GT-3′, with base degeneracy represented in parentheses) had an EcoRI restriction site at the 5′ end (bold) fused to the DNA sequence of FMMNIFV in IIIS6. Primer C6 (5′-CGG CGG ATCC ANAGCAT(A,G)TA(A,G)AA(A,G)CT(A,G,T)AT(A,G)AA-3′) had a BamHI site at the beginning fused to the cDNA sequence of FISFYML in IVS6. Primers C12 (5′-AT(A,C,T)GTNGA(A,G)TGGAA(G,A)CCNTT-3′) and J3 (5′-AA(A,G)CA(A,G)TC(A,G)AANC(G,T)(A,G)TT(A,G)AA-3′) were derived from the conserved amino acid sequences IVEWKPF at the beginning of domain IS1 and FNRFDCF in domain IIS3, respectively. Based on the cDNA sequences of cloned frog cDNA segments 6 and 7, nondegenerate primers (J4 and J5) were designed to amplify the cDNA (segment 9) between domains II and IV. Primer J4 (5′-GCC CTT GGT TTC CAG TCA TAT TTC-3′) corresponds to the amino acid sequence ALGFQSYF in IIS2, and J5 (5′-CAT ACC AAG GCT GAT GGT GTT CAG-3′) presents the cDNA sequence of LNTISLGM in IVS1. Control reactions were performed in the absence of reverse transcriptase to rule out possible contamination by genomic DNA. First-strand cDNA synthesis kits were from either Boehringer Mannheim or Pharmacia Biotech, Inc. PCR products were subcloned into pGEM-T vectors (Promega, Madison, WI). Because there are no conserved sequences at both C and N termini of known Ca channels, no gene-specific primers could be designed for RT-PCR. A frog skeletal muscle cDNA library was constructed instead, and the probes derived from RT-PCR clones (segments 6 and 7) were used to screen it and to obtain both 5′ and 3′ cDNAs. Double-stranded cDNA was synthesized using the Superscript Choice system for cDNA synthesis (Life Technologies, Inc.). The size-fractionated cDNA (>1 kb) was ligated into the λZAP Express vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The recombinant phage vectors packaged with a protein coat (Gigapack II Gold, Stratagene) were used to infect XL1-Blue-MRF′ bacteria (Stratagene) to construct the library. Positive clones pBK/5-13 (covering the 5′ untranslated region), pBK/5-8, pBK/5-10 (covering the 3′ untranslated region), and pBK/5-5 were obtained by screening the library. All cDNA clones were sequenced using the Sequenase 2.0 DNA sequencing kit (Amersham Corp.) and the ABI PRISM dye terminator cycle sequencing ready reaction kit (Perkin-Elmer). Sequence similarity searches of GenBank™ were performed with PCGENE (IntelliGenetics, Mountain View, CA) and DNASIS (Hitachi-Software, South San Francisco, CA). Based on suitable restriction enzyme sites (Fig. 1), RT-PCR clones (segments 6 and 9) and the library clones (5-13, 5-5, and 5-8) were ligated to obtain the full-length molecule (Fgα1S) in the mammalian expression vector pCR3.1 (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). Total RNA (20 μg) isolated from various frog tissues was separated on a 1% agarose-formaldehyde gel, transferred to Nytron BA-S-supported nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell), and cross-linked by baking for 2 h at 80 °C. The cDNA probe, including Fgα1S nucleotides 4859–5600, was cut out from clone pBK/5-8 by NotI and XmnI digestion. The probe was radiolabeled with [α-32P]dCTP using random primers (Ready to Go DNA labeling beads, Pharmacia). The membrane was hybridized with the probe for 24 h at 42 °C in 6 × SSC, 50% formamide, 0.5% SDS, 100 μg/ml sheared salmon sperm DNA, and 5 × Denhardt's solution. The high-stringency wash was performed in 0.5 × SSC and 0.1% SDS at 60 °C. X-ray film (X-Omat AR, Eastman Kodak Co.) was exposed to the membrane at −80 °C. Glyceraldehyde-3-P dehydrogenase probes were also used for hybridization to estimate relative total RNA for each tissue. cDNA coding for domain I of rabbit cardiac channel (α1C) at amino acid positions 165–422 was replaced by the corresponding cDNA segment from either Fgα1S or rabbit skeletal muscle α1S to obtain chimeras. 2The replaced segment starts in the middle of IS1 and ends in the middle of IS6. The replacement can be termed a full domain swap, however, because IS1 and IS6 are almost identical in the frog protein and rabbit α1C. The cDNA of α1C has unique restriction sites, MfeI at nucleotide 689 of IS1 and BamHI at nucleotide 1456 of IS6. These unique sites also appear at the corresponding positions of Fgα1S (491 and 1258, respectively). The cDNA (491–1258) was cut out from Fgα1S and then ligated into MfeI and BamHI predigested pCR3/α1C to produce the frog chimeric channel α1C-FSDI.MfeI and BamHI sites are not present at the corresponding positions of domain I of rabbit α1S, and the sites were introduced by PCR. The PCR product, which covers at 415–1185 of rabbit α1S, was cut by MfeI and BamHI and then ligated into pCR3/α1C to produce the rabbit chimeric channel α1C-RSDI. Large T-antigen-transformed human embryonic kidney cells (tsA201, a gift from Dr. M. M. Hosey, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL) were maintained in DMEM (Sigma) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Biowhittaker, Walkersville, MD), 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin (Sigma) at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Rabbit skeletal muscle α2/δ (in pMT2) was a gift from Dr. T. Tanabe (Tokyo Medical/Dental University, Tokyo, Japan). Rabbit cardiac α1C was carried in pCR3 and rat brain β2a in pCMV. Seven micrograms of each cDNA (total <25 μg) were used for transfection by calcium phosphate precipitation (16Ferreira G. Yi J. Rios E. Shirokov R. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 449-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Expression efficiency was defined as the fraction of cells that had Ca2+ currents among those selected and patched. Ionic currents were recorded by whole-cell patch clamp. Voltage clamping, pulse generation, and data acquisition were carried out with an Axopatch 200 A (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) and a 16-bit digital conversion card in a PC-compatible computer. The analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog routines were written by Ivan Stavrovsky in our laboratory. Pipettes were from borosilicate glass (Corning 7052; Garner Glass, Claremont, CA) heat polished to a tip outside diameter of 2–4 μm for a resistance of 2–4 MΩ. Ion currents were recorded with a pipette solution containing (in mm) 150 Cs+, 125 Asp−, 15 Cl−, 5 MgATP, 10 HEPES, and 10 EGTA, pH 7.6, adjusted by CsOH, and an external solution containing (in mm) 130 NaCl, 10 HEPES, and 10 Ca2+ or Ba2+, pH 7.3. Experiments were performed at 20–23 °C. Single, nonclustered cells were chosen for recording. Cells were pulsed from a holding potential of −90 mV. Asymmetric currents were obtained by subtraction of scaled control currents elicited with pulses from −130 to −100 mV. The composite cDNA sequence of Fgα1S was obtained by sequencing multiple overlapping clones. The sequence map of all clones is shown in Fig. 1. The 5′-end sequence, including an untranslated region, is present in the library clone 5-13. The 3′-end, including an untranslated region and a portion of the poly(A) tail, is covered by library clones 5-8 and 5-10. The cDNA sequences of the library clones (5-13, 5-5, 5-8, and 5-10) are equal to those of RT-PCR clones (segments 6, 7, and 9), with several single-base differences: 1) clone 5-13 has CGT780, whereas segment 6 and the full-length molecule have CGG780; both CGT and CGG encode arginine; 2) clones 5-13 and 5-5 have G876TA encoding valine, whereas segment 6 and the full-length cDNA have A876TA, encoding isoleucine; 3) clone 5-5 has T2151CT (serine), whereas segment 9 and the full-length cDNA have G2151CT (alanine) at this position; and 4) segment 7, clone 5-8, and the full-length cDNA have CTC4274, whereas clone 5-10 has CTT4274. Both CTC and CTT code for leucine. These single-base differences could be explained by polymorphism, also observed in α1 cDNA clones from rabbit skeletal muscle (5Tanabe T. Takeshima H. Mikami A.

The 5600-nucleotide cDNA sequence of Fgα1S and its amino acid sequence are available (GenBank™ accession number AF037625). The polyadenylation signal sequence, AATAAA (17Sambrook J Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed.

Translation of the deduced channel protein (1688 amino acids) starts at nucleotide 303 with the first methionine and ends at nucleotide 5367, which is followed by the stop codon TGA. Transmembrane domains and pore regions were deduced from an alignment of Fgα1S with rabbit cardiac (Rbα1C) (18Mikami A. Imoto K. Tanabe T. Niidome T. Mori Y. Takeshima H. Narumiya S. Numa S.

An alignment of the S4 segments of Fgα1S with rabbit and carp channels (Fig. 2 A) shows identical charges and almost perfect homology, consistent with the requirements for the voltage sensor of EC coupling and a voltage-operated ion channel. The pore regions of ion channels have been localized to the linkers between segments S5 and S6 (22Tomaselli G.F. Backx P.H. Marban E. Circ. Res. 1993; 72: 491-496Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Four glutamic acid residues at equivalent positions in pore regions have been demonstrated to determine the high-affinity Ca2+ binding in L-type channels (23Yang J. Ellinor P.T. Sather W.A. Zhang J.F. Tsien R.W. Nature. 1993; 366: 158-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar), and other cloned high-voltage-activated Ca2+channels also have these conserved glutamic acid residues at equivalent positions. The alignment of pore regions of Fgα1S, rabbit, and carp channels is shown in Fig. 2 B. Fgα1S has conserved sequences in those regions, as well as the critical glutamic acid residues. DHP binding affinity is an established criterion to distinguish L- and non-L-type Ca channels (24Tsien R.W. Lipscombe D. Madison D.V. Bley K.R. Fox A.P. Trends Neurosci. 1988; 11: 431-438Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1132) Google Scholar). The DHP binding site of L-type Ca channels appears to involve regions between transmembrane segments IIIS6 and IVS6, where residues Tyr1048, Ile1049, and Ile1052 in IIIS6 and Tyr1365, Met1366, Ile1372, and Ile1373 in IVS6 are critical (25Peterson B.Z. Tanada T.N. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5293-5296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Fgα1S has a sequence almost identical to other DHP receptors in the DHP binding regions, including all required residues at corresponding sites (Tyr1046, Ile1047, Ile1050, Tyr1352, Met1353, Ile1359, and Ile1360). The alignment of DHP binding regions of Fgα1S with rabbit and carp DHP receptors is shown in Fig. 2 C. Unlike cardiac cells, in skeletal muscle Ca2+ release is triggered by DHPrs without requirement for entry of extracellular Ca2+ (26Armstrong C.M. Bezanilla F.M. Horowicz P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 267: 605-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 27Endo M. Physiol. Rev. 1977; 57: 71-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar). A crucial molecular determinant of skeletal muscle type EC coupling is at the intracellular loop between domains II and III of rabbit α1S (28Tanabe T. Beam K.G. Adams B.A. Niidome T. Numa S. Nature. 1990; 346: 567-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). The II-III loop of Fgα1S has high (86%) homology with Rbα1S (Table I), suggesting that Fgα1S is a skeletal muscle-type voltage sensor. Skeletal muscle L-type Ca2+ channels are regulated by phosphorylation. In rat skeletal muscle fibers, both Ca2+ current and intramembranous charge movement are increased by PKA (29Garcia J. Gamboa-Aldeco R. Stefani E. Pflugers Arch. 1990; 417: 114-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), whereas in frog fibers, only Ca2+ currents are increased by PKA (29Garcia J. Gamboa-Aldeco R. Stefani E. Pflugers Arch. 1990; 417: 114-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) or cAMP (30Arreola J. Calvo J. Garcia M.C. Sanchez J.A. J. Physiol. 1987; 393: 307-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Serine 687, in the intracellular II-III loop of rabbit α1S, is a major PKA phosphorylation site in vitro (31Rohrkasten A. Meyer H.E. Nastainczyk W. Sieber M. Hofmann F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15325-15329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fgα1S has no Ser or Thr at the corresponding position. In intact rabbit skeletal muscle myotubes other putative PKA sites have been located at Ser1757 and Ser1854 at the C terminus of the full-length channel (32Rotman E.I. Murphy B.J. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16371-16377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Fgα1S, with a shorter C terminus, has no corresponding sites. By searching the derived amino acid sequence, we located a PKA phosphorylation site motif, RRXS (33Kemp B.E. Pearson R.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 342-346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar), at the intracellular I-II loop of Fgα1S (Ser424). To determine the tissue specificity of the cloned molecule, we carried out Northern blot analysis. Total RNA from frog heart, liver, and skeletal muscle tissues was hybridized with a cDNA probe derived from Fgα1S, covering the 3′-untranslated region and the diverse sequence of the C terminus. Despite the differences in glyceraldehyde-3-P dehydrogenase signal between lanes, the ethidium bromide staining gel (data not shown) indicated that approximately the same amount of total RNA was loaded on each lane. The blot revealed a single RNA band in skeletal muscle (Fig. 3), consistent with the result found in mammalian skeletal muscle (34Ellis S.B. Williams M.E. Ways N.R. Brenner R. Sharp A.H. Leung A.T. Campbell K.P. McKenna E. Koch W.J. Hui A. Schwartz A. Harpold M.M. Science. 1988; 241: 1661-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). There were no detectable transcripts in any of the other tissues, even using longer exposure times (data not shown). tsA201 cells were chosen as a functional expression system for the cloned frog channel because HEK cells have no endogenous L-type Ca2+ currents (35Berjukow S. Doring F. Froschmayr M. Grabner M. Glossmann H. Hering S. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 118: 748-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), and large T antigen-transformed HEK cells (tsA201) express rabbit cardiac calcium channels efficiently (16Ferreira G. Yi J. Rios E. Shirokov R. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 449-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In general, the functional expression of the wild-type clone was poor. Only in a few cells we obtained large, clearly extrinsic L-type Ca2+ currents. Nontransfected cells were patch clamped first as a control, and most had no detectable inward currents during depolarization. Three of 20 cells had small Ba2+ currents of 0.3 pA/pF. These currents were not sensitive to 5 μmextracellular Bay K (Table II), indicating the absence of endogenous L-type channels.Table IIExpression efficiency and current properties in cells transfected with Fgα1SDNA transfectionNo. of cellsCells with currentsIon carrierτ½I PmspA/pFNone203Ba2+0.3 ± 0.1Ba2+ + Bay K0.3 ± 0.1β2A405Ba2+0.4 ± 0.1Ba2+ + Bay K6.6 ± 0.81.1 ± 0.4β2A302Ba2+1.1 ± 1.0+α2/δBa2+ + Bay K8.0 ± 0.02.0 ± 1.3Fgα1S202Ba2+1.9 ± 1.2+β2ABa2+ + Bay K6.0 ± 1.53.0 ± 1.5Fgα1S303Ca2+3.9 ± 0.710.1 ± 4.7+β2A+ α2/δBa2+4.0 ± 0.520.2 ± 1.8One hundred forty cells were stable after whole-cell patching.

Cells transfected with β2a or β2a plus α2/δ were studied in search of L-type Ca2+ channel currents induced by transfection of auxiliary subunits. Five of 40 β2a-transfected cells patched had Bay K-sensitive currents. Fig. 4 A shows Ba2+currents from one of those. Peak and tail currents were increased three times by 5 μm Bay K (Table II). Two of 30 cells cotransfected with β2a plus α2/δ had Ba2+ currents that were increased by Bay K. On average, these currents were somewhat greater than those of the β2a-transfected cells (Table II). In conclusion, extrinsic auxiliary subunits induce the expression of DHP-sensitive endogenous current of very low amplitude. Fgα1S was cotransfected into tsA201 cells in different combinations with cDNAs of other auxiliary subunits (β2a from rat brain and α2δ from rabbit skeletal muscle). The frequency of cells with L-type currents was not increased compared with those transfected with auxiliary subunits only. However, the L-type current density was greater. Two of 20 Fgα1S- plus β2a-transfected cells patched had peak Ba2+ currents at least two times larger than the maximum observed in the 40 cells transfected with β2a alone. Bay K increased the amplitude of peak and tail currents in these cells (Fig. 4 B and Table II). Substitution of Ca2+ as current carrier reduced current amplitude substantially (data not shown). Again, most of the 30 Fgα1S plus β2a plus α2/δ cells patched had no evidence of L-type currents. However, in three of them Ba2+ current density was >5-fold greater than the largest currents recorded in Fgα1S plus β2a cells. As illustrated in Fig. 4, C1 and C2, and summarized in Table II, in those cells the current decreased ∼2-fold when Ca2+ was substituted for Ba2+ as current carrier. Half-times of activation of these currents (τ½) are listed in Table II. Against our expectations activation of current in the cells transfected with Fgα1S was much faster than in frog skeletal muscle, where τ½ at 20 °C is ∼70 ms at 0 mV (36Cota G. Nicola Siri L. Stefani E. J. Physiol. 1983; 338: 395-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Because functional expression of Fgα1S was so infrequent, we carried out additional expression tests with a chimera of Fgα1S and rabbit α1C. In rabbit channels domain I determines the slow activation kinetics (37Tanabe T. Adams B.A. Numa S. Beam K.G. Nature. 1991; 352: 800-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Because the currents induced by the full Fgα1S activated rapidly, neither domain I nor any other in the frog molecule was expected to make the activation of the chimeric construct slower. Still, we chose to splice domain I of Fgα1S to rabbit α1C (to make α1C-FSDI), because a similar chimera with DI from Rbα1S (named α1C-RSDI) should have slower kinetics, thus providing overall control of the procedures. In all cases, β2a cDNA was cotransfected with the α1 constructs. The expression efficiency of α1C was ∼80%. Ca2+ and Ba2+ currents are illustrated in Fig. 5 A. For IBa, the τ½ at +30 mV was ∼5 ms. Average τ½ values are plotted versus voltage in Fig. 6.Figure 6Kinetic properties of currents in cells transfected with α1C or its chimeras.
