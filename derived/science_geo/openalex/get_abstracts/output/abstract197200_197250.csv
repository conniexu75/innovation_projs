On the basis of published reports and of studies made in our laboratories, it is concluded that albomycin and grisein are chemically very similar and identical with respect to antimicrobial activity (5)."

https://openalex.org/W1976108452,"Research on new antibiotics is engaged in at present throughout the world with such intensity that one must be able to compare cultures of organisms producing such antibiotics, as well as the isolated substances themselves, if one is to avoid needless duplication and great confusion. As long as no international center exists where such comparisons can be made, only close collaboration among scientific laboratories can make possible these essential comparisons. The repetitions and the frequently unjustified creation of ""new species"" of antibiotic-producing organisms and of ""new antibiotics"" can be avoided only by close collaboration among the scientific workers throughout the world. The creation of an International Antibiotics Board is also highly essential at the present time."
