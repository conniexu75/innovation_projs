https://openalex.org/W1984662835,"WE wish to report a new series of chemical compounds effective against nematodes parasitic in the gastro-intestinal tract of mammals. Certain of these compounds possess an unusually broad anthelmintic spectrum which includes appreciable activity against certain species causing infections of economic importance for which there is, at present, no satisfactory treatment. These compounds (patent applications pending) have the general formula (I), where R
1 can be hydrogen, methyl or chlorine, while R
2 can be hydrogen, methyl, chlorine or fluorine. Lower activities are encountered when R
1 is a nitro-group, bromine or when R
2 is bromine. Numerous other variants are in course of examination."

Group A was kept in the original cold environment and the other group, B, was transferred to the hot environment of 92° ± 1° F."

For this reason we have devised a technique for preparing starch gels which remain transparent after staining."

https://openalex.org/W2004128594,"ALTHOUGH the part played by metals in non-enzymatic transaminations is known, its role in the enzymatic reaction of this type is still to be proved. Aluminium, nickel, copper and iron are known to catalyse the non-enzymatic reaction between an amino-acid and pyridoxal, or a keto-acid and pyridoxamine. Recently, Fasella et al.
1 have isolated the intermediates involved. This preliminary communication reports the possibility of iron (in its reduced state) being involved in the enzymatic transamination."

https://openalex.org/W1983371771,"DISAGGREGATION of amphibian embryos by agents which chelate calcium is succeeded by re-aggregation if the cells are returned to a medium containing calcium1. It is customary to consider that the removal of calcium from the environment of the cells is responsible for the loss of adhesion displayed in disaggregation. An attempt has been made to find out whether any organic material is removed from the embryos during disaggregation. Such organic material might lie on the cell surfaces or between the cells and assist in their adhesion, or it might be removed from within the cells during disaggregation. Batches of 250–260 late gastrulæ of Xenopus laevis were disaggregated in 0.001 M ethylene diamine tetraacetate at pH 8.03 in tris-hydrochloric acid buffer (0.001 M in tris) made up in calcium-free Holtfreter solution. The embryos were gently agitated on a rocker for 40 min. at 19–21° C., and at the end of this period the cells of the completely disaggregated embryos were allowed to settle. No evidence of cytolysis of the cells could be found. The supernatant was removed and centrifuged at 300–400 g for 10 min. A small number of intact cells, and a few yolk platelets probably of extracellular origin, formed the residue. The clear supernatant from this centrifugation was examined spectrophotometrically, and the absorption curve suggested the presence of nucleic acids. The preparation was frozen-dried."

https://openalex.org/W1969976471,"THE fluorescent substances formed by Microsporum species and Trichophyton schoenleini when attacking hair in vivo have not been identified; recently Wolf1, on the basis of in vitro studies of the growth of M. canis and M. gypseum on hair, has produced evidence indicating that one of the substances is a pteridine. It is felt that this conclusion should be accepted with reserve for the following reasons."
https://openalex.org/W2066983335,"DURING the course of some work on the blood parasites of birds1 (some of which has been or will shortly be published2) gametocytes of several species of Leucocytozoon were observed in the blood of seven species of birds. In the absence of reports of the incidence of this parasite in British birds since those of Seligman and Sambon3 (in grouse), Woodcock4 (in chaffinches and redpolls) and Coles5 (in thrush, blackbird, jay, pigeon, starling, moorhen and “many others”) it is thought that results from the present investigation (which took place between 1953 and 1955) might be of interest."
https://openalex.org/W2082965573,"DURING investigations on the synthesis of sucrose from glucose-1-phosphate and fructose by pea seed extracts it was observed that a glycolytic system was operating in the enzymic digests1,2. The pea extract had been partially purified by precipitation with ammonium sulphate (80 per cent saturation) and dialysis against phosphate buffer at pH. 7.0. It was found that there were differences in glycolytic activity when the enzymic digests were incubated under aerobic and anaerobic conditions."

Since then Layrisse and Arends3 and Junqueira and Wishart4 have reported the absence of Dia in 107 and in 150 pure blood Negroes, while Simmons5 has reported its absence in 80 eastern Polynesians, 162 Australian aborigines, 23 Papuans and 74 natives of New Britain."
https://openalex.org/W2006310349,"THE in vitro de-iodination of thyroxine has been reported in a variety of biological systems, including slices, homogenates, and extracts of mammalian organs1–3. In particular, a system present in rat liver has been fairly extensively investigated and a technique evolved whereby quantitative measurements of de-iodination can be readily obtained4. At the outset of the present work, this technique was employed to re-investigate the properties of the de-iodinating system of rat liver. The heat stability of the homogenate3 and the heat lability of the extract were confirmed, and the system shown to be inhibited by potassium cyanide. The rate of de-iodination was fastest at the beginning of the incubation period and fell off with time, levelling off after 1–2 hr. when 50–70 per cent de-iodination had occurred. Substrate specificity was not absolute, tri-iodothyronine being metabolized to a lesser extent. In all these respects the system used resembles that previously described by other workers4."

This communication is concerned with some relationships between testicular β-glucuronidase, lipase and esterase of the rat in artificial cryptorchidism."

https://openalex.org/W2045464567,"A PAPER1 from this laboratory described an improved method for the estimation of Oospora lactis Fres. (formerly known as Oidium lactis) in pressed bakers' yeast, using a medium consisting of ammonium succinate, mineral salts and agar. The method worked well with most yeasts, but one strain (Saccharomyces cerevisiae D.C.L. 557) prevented the growth of visible colonies of Oospora on the above medium. This effect has been further studied, and it has been found that the immediate cause of the inhibition was the presence in the medium of 2 × 10−2 M potassium (as the dihydrogen phosphate). This was demonstrated by excluding potassium from the medium, adding the phosphate as the sodium or ammonium salt. The mould then developed into dense colonies; these were not, however, quite so large as those grown on normal medium (containing potassium) in the absence of yeast. This reduction in size was due to the fact that Oospora required 3 × 10−4 M potassium ions for optimal growth on ammonium succinate, mineral salts, agar medium. When Yeast 557 was present, however, this concentration of potassium, added as sulphate or chloride to the medium (containing sodium or ammonium dihydrogen phosphate), inhibited the growth of the mould. The inhibition was largely overcome by the addition of 5 × 10−4 M aluminium (as ammonium alum) to the normal medium."

A blood agar medium incorporating aqueous spleen infusion was formulated for the isolation of pathogenic fungi at 37° C.2. The stimulatory effects of spleen extracts on the growth of micro-organisms in chemically defined culture media has been investigated by us."
