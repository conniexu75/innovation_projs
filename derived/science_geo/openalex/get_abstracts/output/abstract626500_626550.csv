To achieve superconductivity, the two layers of graphene need to be at a very precise angle with respect to each other. Yankowitz et al. now show that another experimental knob, hydrostatic pressure, can be used to tune the phase diagram of twisted bilayer graphene (see the Perspective by Feldman). Applying pressure increased the coupling between the layers, which shifted the superconducting transition to higher angles and somewhat higher temperatures.

Grinberg et al. analyzed Twitter data by matching Twitter accounts to specific voters to determine who was exposed to fake news, who spread fake news, and how fake news interacted with factual news (see the Perspective by Ruths). Fake news accounted for nearly 6% of all news consumption, but it was heavily concentrated—only 1% of users were exposed to 80% of fake news, and 0.1% of users were responsible for sharing 80% of fake news. Interestingly, fake news was most concentrated among conservative voters. Science , this issue p. 374 ; see also p. 348"

Jordão et al. combined high-throughput single-cell RNA sequencing and intravital microscopy to compile a transcriptional atlas of myeloid subsets in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a mouse model of MS. Microglia and other CNS-associated macrophages expanded and transformed into various context-dependent subtypes during EAE. Furthermore, dendritic cells and monocyte-derived cells, but not resident macrophages, played a critical role by presenting antigen to pathogenic T cells. This exhaustive characterization may inform future therapeutic targeting strategies in MS. Science , this issue p. eaat7554"
https://openalex.org/W2912003143,"Sleep may protect the brain from AD Two main proteins accumulate in the brain in Alzheimer's disease (AD), β-amyloid (Aβ) and tau. Aβ appears to instigate AD, but tau appears to drive brain damage and cognitive decline. Sleep deprivation is known to increase Aβ acutely and chronically. Now, Holth et al. show that chronic sleep deprivation strongly increases tau acutely over hours and also drives tau pathology spreading in the brains of mice and humans (see the Perspective by Noble and Spires-Jones). Thus, sleep appears to have a direct protective effect on a key protein that drives AD pathology. Science , this issue p. 880 ; see also p. 813"

Gu et al. designed a copper-based PCP with a ligand that contains phenothiazine-5,5-dioxide. The entrances to the porous cages changed size with temperature, when these functional groups underwent flipping motions. The change in gate size could lead to high selectivity for gas absorption and enabled the separation of oxygen from argon and of ethylene from ethane as well as long-term gas storage under ambient conditions.

https://openalex.org/W2950040155,"Distinct genetic forms of autism are hypothesized to share a common increase in excitation-inhibition (E-I) ratio in cerebral cortex, causing hyperexcitability and excess spiking. We provide a systematic test of this hypothesis across 4 mouse models (Fmr1-/y, Cntnap2-/-, 16p11.2del/+, Tsc2+/-), focusing on somatosensory cortex. All autism mutants showed reduced feedforward inhibition in layer 2/3 coupled with more modest, variable reduction in feedforward excitation, driving a common increase in E-I conductance ratio. Despite this, feedforward spiking, synaptic depolarization, and spontaneous spiking were largely normal. Modeling revealed that E and I conductance changes in each mutant were quantitatively matched to yield stable, not increased, synaptic depolarization for cells near spike threshold. Correspondingly, whisker-evoked spiking was not increased in vivo despite detectably reduced inhibition. Thus, elevated E-I ratio is a common circuit phenotype but appears to reflect homeostatic stabilization of synaptic drive rather than driving network hyperexcitability in autism."
https://openalex.org/W2915041973,"Genetic diversity arises from recombination and de novo mutation (DNM). Using a combination of microarray genotype and whole-genome sequence data on parent-child pairs, we identified 4,531,535 crossover recombinations and 200,435 DNMs. The resulting genetic map has a resolution of 682 base pairs. Crossovers exhibit a mutagenic effect, with overrepresentation of DNMs within 1 kilobase of crossovers in males and females. In females, a higher mutation rate is observed up to 40 kilobases from crossovers, particularly for complex crossovers, which increase with maternal age. We identified 35 loci associated with the recombination rate or the location of crossovers, demonstrating extensive genetic control of meiotic recombination, and our results highlight genes linked to the formation of the synaptonemal complex as determinants of crossovers."

Working in mice, Favuzzi et al. found that gene expression programs that define subsets of interneurons also define where on the postsynaptic partner those interneurons prefer to build a synapse. One class of interneurons prefers to synapse onto the cell body of pyramidal neurons, another class onto the dendrites, and yet another onto the axon initial segment. Science , this issue p. 413"

One useful trick is to shift hydrogen atoms around to interconvert C=C isomers selectively. However, this approach typically requires precious metals. Kapat et al. now report that more-abundant nickel can catalyze rapid conversion of terminal olefins into internal olefins with high selectivity for trans geometry. The odd-electron nickel complex relies on a radical mechanism to shuttle hydrogen to the terminal carbon from the saturated carbon adjacent to the double bond. Science , this issue p. 391"

The metal is adept at connecting aromatic rings to one another or to nitrogen centers. However, functional complexity can obstruct the reaction, necessitating laborious ligand optimization.

https://openalex.org/W2912961601,"Attack from the front Biomolecular substitution reactions are widely applied to compounds with carbon-halogen bonds. Typically, an incoming reactive group will attack the carbon from behind its bond with the halogen, causing the halogen to depart in the opposite direction. Zhang et al. now present an asymmetric catalytic substitution reaction that flips the script with an attack on the halogen from the front. Specifically, nitrogen and sulfur nucleophiles stripped bromine from a variety of carbon centers activated by electron-withdrawing groups. A chiral cationic catalyst then directed the carbon fragment back to form a carbon-sulfur or carbon-nitrogen bond enantioselectively. Science , this issue p. 400"
https://openalex.org/W2913252170,"Cold is better for polar predators Generally, biodiversity is higher in the tropics than at the poles. This pattern is present across taxa as diverse as plants and insects. Marine mammals and birds buck this trend, however, with more species and more individuals occurring at the poles than at the equator. Grady et al. asked why this is (see the Perspective by Pyenson). They analyzed a comprehensive dataset of nearly 1000 species of shark, fish, reptiles, mammals, and birds. They found that predation on ectothermic (“cold-blooded”) prey is easier where waters are colder, which generates a larger resource base for large endothermic (“warm-blooded”) predators in polar regions.

Hyun et al. explain how different signaling pathways control such variation in flowering. The perennial pathway requires a floral integrator limited to older shoots. The annual pathway, on the other hand, allows a photoperiodic response to incite flowering on young shoots.

https://openalex.org/W2912270846,"Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) are inefficient for a non-negligible part of the population, estimated around 25%. To understand this phenomenon in Sensorimotor Rhythm (SMR) based BCIs, data from a large-scale screening study conducted on 80 novice participants with the Berlin BCI system and its standard machine-learning approach were investigated. Each participant performed one BCI session with resting state Encephalography, Motor Observation, Motor Execution and Motor Imagery recordings and 128 electrodes. A significant portion of the participants (40%) could not achieve BCI control (feedback performance > 70%). Based on the performance of the calibration and feedback runs, BCI users were stratified in three groups. Analyses directed to detect and elucidate the differences in the SMR activity of these groups were performed. Statistics on reactive frequencies, task prevalence and classification results are reported. Based on their SMR activity, also a systematic list of potential reasons leading to performance drops and thus hints for possible improvements of BCI experimental design are given. The categorization of BCI users has several advantages, allowing researchers 1) to select subjects for further analyses as well as for testing new BCI paradigms or algorithms, 2) to adopt a better subject-dependent training strategy and 3) easier comparisons between different studies."

Utilizing a high-throughput, genome-wide screen for miRNAs and mRNAs that are differentially regulated in osteosarcoma (OS) cell lines, we report that miR-449a and miR-424, belonging to the miR-34 and miR-16 families, respectively, target the major S/G2 phase cyclin, cyclin A2 (CCNA2), in a bipartite manner. We found that the 3′-UTR of CCNA2 is recognized by miR-449a, whereas the CCNA2 coding region is targeted by miR-424. Of note, we observed loss of both miR-449a and miR-424 in OS, resulting in derepression of CCNA2 and appearance of aggressive cancer phenotypes. Ectopic expression of miR-449a and miR-424 significantly decreased cyclin A2 levels and inhibited proliferation rate, migratory potential, and colony-forming ability of OS cells. To further probe the roles of miR-449a and miR-424 in OS, we developed an OS mouse model by intraosseous injection of U2OS cells into the tibia bone of NOD-scid mice, which indicated that miR-449a and miR-424 co-expression suppresses tumor growth. On the basis of this discovery, we analyzed the gene expression of human OS biopsy samples, revealing that miR-449a and miR-424 are both down-regulated, whereas cyclin A2 is significantly up-regulated in these OS samples. In summary, the findings in our study highlight that cyclin A2 repression by miRNAs of the miR-16 and miR-34 families is lost in aggressive OS.

For instance, it has been reported that miR-15b and miR-16, which target the anti-apoptotic gene BCL2, are lost in gastric cancers, but the increase in BCL2 was more than what could be explained by the loss of miR-15/16, suggesting an additional mechanism of BCL2 regulation in cancers (20Xia L.

Subsequent studies demonstrating the down-regulation of BCL2 by miRNAs of the miR-34 family, including miR-34a and miR-449a, highlighted that the individual studies may not have completely discerned the contribution of multiple growth-inhibitory miRNAs in cell cycle regulation (7Chen J.

Overall, these results emphasize a lacuna in our understanding of simultaneous regulation of key cell cycle genes by miR-16 and miR-34 family miRNAs, and hence there is a need to address the combinatorial regulation of critical cell cycle genes by these tumor-suppressor miRNA families. In the present study, we set out to explore the key regulatory miRNAs and their target gene networks associated with the progression of osteosarcoma. We have focused on identifying the miRNAs that regulate the growth and proliferation of OS cells by targeting cell cycle–associated genes. In this study, we performed a high-throughput screening of genome-wide miRNAs as well as mRNAs, which are differentially regulated in two OS cell lines, U2OS and HAL, classified as aggressive and nonaggressive, respectively, based on their proliferative, invasive, and colony-forming capacities (23Lauvrak S.U.

In-depth analysis revealed a weak expression of miR-449a and miR-424 family miRNAs in aggressive osteosarcoma, in contrast to the expression of their putative target genes. Our results demonstrate that there is a simultaneous inhibition of miR-16 and miR-34 family miRNAs leading to derepression of their common target, CCNA2, in aggressive osteosarcoma, and restoration of these miRNAs results in suppression of CCNA2 and cancer-associated phenotypes. To identify the miRNAs regulating cell cycle and proliferation during oncogenesis, we compared their expression in two osteosarcoma cell lines, U2OS and HAL, which differ in their aggressiveness. We observed that the proliferation rate of U2OS cells was significantly higher than that of HAL cells (Fig. 1A). By comparing the miRNA expressions of U2OS and HAL retrieved from GEO (GSE28425), we attempted to identify the novel miRNAs regulating cell proliferation (Fig. 1B). From the microarray data analysis of 820 miRNAs, we found that 152 miRNAs were down-regulated, whereas 142 miRNAs were up-regulated, by more than 2-fold, in U2OS cells. From the list of 152 miRNAs, we selected 40 most down-regulated miRNAs for validation by individual real-time quantitative RT-PCR and observed that 18 miRNAs were significantly down-regulated in U2OS cells (Fig. 1C). Our strategy as described in Fig. 1B assumes that miRNAs which are down-regulated in aggressive osteosarcoma are more likely to regulate the expression of growth-supporting genes. Few of these miRNAs, including miR-181, miR-199, and miR-10b, have been previously documented for their tumor-suppressive role. Next, we obtained the mRNA microarray data of U2OS and HAL cell lines from GEO and listed top 50 cell cycle–associated genes that were up-regulated. To predict whether the up-regulated cell cycle–associated genes were the targets of the down-regulated miRNAs in U2OS cells, we used five different miRNA target prediction algorithms, namely TargetScan, miRanda, miRWalk, RNAhybrid, and RNA22. Thus, a pairwise matching of down-regulated miRNAs with up-regulated genes on the basis of predicted target binding sites identified several proto-oncogenes as putative targets of miRNAs down-regulated in U2OS (Fig. 1D). Individual qRT-PCR validation confirmed significant up-regulation of 16 cell cycle–associated genes, including CDK6 and CCNA2, in U2OS that were observed as common targets for several down-regulated miRNAs (Fig. 1, E and F). Microarray analysis of miRNA expression in differentially proliferating human OS cell lines, U2OS and HAL, revealed that miR-34c and miR-449a, and not other members of miR-34 family, figured in the list of significantly down-regulated miRNAs in U2OS, as reported previously (7Chen J.

The miR-34 family has six members, including miR-34a, miR-34b, miR-34c, miR-449a, miR-449b, and miR-449c, each of them sharing the same seed sequence GGCAGUG, and because microarray data sets may suffer from errors, we ascertained the levels of other members of miR-34 family (Fig. 2A). We observed that miR-449a, miR-449b, and miR-449c, transcribed in a cluster from chromosomal position 5q11.2, were significantly down-regulated in aggressive osteosarcoma, whereas polycistronic miRNAs miR-34b and miR-34c, transcribed in another cluster from chromosome 11q23.1, were moderately down-regulated (Fig. 2B). miR-449a is expressed across different tissue samples, and thus we selected it to understand its role in the regulation of cell proliferation in osteosarcoma. To study the effect of miR-449a in osteosarcoma, we transfected U2OS cells with synthetic mimic of mature miR-449a and performed a proliferation assay, where we observed that miR-449a significantly reduced the rate of cell proliferation (Fig. 2, C and D). To delineate the mechanism behind regulation of cell proliferation by miR-449a, we determined the cell cycle distribution of miR-449a–overexpressing U2OS cells and found that miR-449a leads to an accumulation of cells in the G1 phase (Fig. 2E). To clearly demonstrate a G1 accumulation, miR-449a mimic–transfected cells were treated with nocodazole to block the cells in G2/M phase, before evaluating the cell cycle distribution by flow cytometry. Nocodazole treatment markedly reduced the G1 phase population of control mimic–transfected cells by blocking the majority of cell population in the G2/M phase; however, the percentage of the G1 phase population was significantly higher in miR-449a mimic–transfected cells, thus demonstrating a G1 arrest caused by the overexpression of miR-449a. We next evaluated the rate of DNA synthesis by measuring the incorporation of nucleotide analog, 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU), in an immunofluorescence assay, where we observed that it was reduced to 34% in cells transfected with miR-449a mimic as compared with 60% in control cells (Fig. 2, F and G). Similarly, in the flow cytometry assay, BrdU-incorporating cells decreased from 38 to 24%, further establishing that miR-449a impedes S phase progression (Fig. 2H). Having identified that miR-449a is significantly down-regulated in aggressive osteosarcoma and that the overexpression of miR-449a in U2OS cells leads to a G1 arrest, S phase reduction, and slower proliferation rate, we focused on determining its target gene. Although CLIP-Seq or RNA-Seq would identify new targets of miR-449a that would elucidate its novel physiological functions, in this study, we focused on key cell cycle regulators. Utilizing a combination of five prediction algorithms, we identified several key cell cycle genes as putative targets of miR-449a (Fig. 1D). Of the total 10 growth-regulating genes that were predicted as targets of miR-449a by two or more algorithms, CCNE2, CCNA2, and CDK4 were most significantly down-regulated upon miR-449a overexpression in U2OS cells, whereas other putative growth-promoting target genes, including CCND1, GSK3B, and CDK6, did not show significant alteration (Fig. 2I). Additionally, we observed a significant decrease in cyclin A2 protein levels after miR-449a overexpression in U2OS cells (Fig. 2J). We now ascertained whether there is a pattern of expression of miR-449a in other aggressive OS cell lines. We tested the levels of miR-449a in OS cell lines displaying varying aggressiveness of cancer phenotypes; cell lines MG63, HOS, and U2OS are reported to be highly proliferating, whereas HAL and KPD are poorly proliferating OS cell lines (23Lauvrak S.U. Munthe E. Kresse S.H. Stratford E.W. Namløs H.M. Meza-Zepeda L.A. Myklebost O. Functional characterisation of osteosarcoma cell lines and identification of mRNAs and miRNAs associated with aggressive cancer phenotypes.Br. J. Cancer. 2013; 109 (24064976): 2228-223610.1038/bjc.2013.549Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). We observed that miR-449a was significantly down-regulated in the group of aggressively proliferating OS cells lines (i.e. U2OS, MG63, and HOS) compared with less proliferating OS cell lines, such as HAL and KPD (Fig. 2K). In contrast to miR-449a, CCNA2 displays an inverse pattern; it is up-regulated in aggressively proliferating OS cell lines (U2OS, MG63, and HOS), compared with HAL and KPD. Thus, we have observed down-regulation of miR-449a and up-regulation of CCNA2 as a common phenomenon in aggressively proliferating osteosarcomas. We focused on CCNA2 regulation by miR-449a, as the role of cyclin A2 has been well-established in mediating progression of cells through both G1/S and S/G2 phases of the cell cycle. In view of the fact that miR-449a is predicted to target several other cell cycle genes, including CCND1 and CDK6, we wanted to ascertain that CCNA2 down-regulation is a not an indirect effect caused by accumulation of cells in G1 phase due to targeting of other G1/S-regulating genes by miR-449a. To test whether the changes in cell cycle distribution were the reason for cyclin A2 decrease, we transfected asynchronous U2OS cells twice with either miR-449a or control mimic, and after 4 h, hydroxyurea was added to synchronize the transfected cells at the G1/S transition. We observed that after hydroxyurea treatment, miR-449a mimic– and control mimic–transfected cells displayed identical cell cycle distribution, but the levels of cyclin A2 were significantly reduced in miR-449a–transfected cells, ruling out that cell cycle changes are the reason for cyclin A2 decrease (Fig. 3, A and B). To further evaluate whether the CCNA2 gene is a direct target of miR-449a, we cloned 3′-UTR of CCNA2 carrying either the WT or mutated binding site of miR-449a in pmirGLO Dual-Luciferase reporter vector and assayed the effect of miR-449a overexpression on luciferase activity (Fig. 3C). When the WT CCNA2 3′-UTR was introduced into U2OS cells along with miR-449a mimic, it exhibited a significant reduction in the luciferase activity, but the mutation in the binding site at the 3′-UTR suppressed the inhibition of luciferase activity caused by miR-449a overexpression (Fig. 3D). Thus, miR-449a inhibits CCNA2 expression through direct interaction with its 3′-UTR. After determining the effect of miR-449a overexpression on cyclin A2 levels, we next assessed the effect of loss-of-function of miR-449a. We transfected U2OS cells with miR-449a mimic or single-stranded antisense inhibitor of miR-449a, alone or in combination, and evaluated the effect on CCNA2 expression. Transfection of miR-449a inhibitor alone led to a significant decrease of miR-449a levels and also suppressed the miR-449a increase observed after miR-449a mimic transfection (Fig. 3E). As expected, we observed a marked decrease in CCNA2 mRNA as well as protein levels after miR-449a overexpression, whereas inhibition of miR-449a only marginally increased CCNA2 levels (Fig. 3, F and G). However, transfection of miR-449a inhibitor reversed the CCNA2 down-regulation caused by miR-449a mimic expression, confirming that miR-449a regulates endogenous levels of CCNA2. We have previously shown that miR-449a overexpression leads to an accumulation in the G1 phase. However, when miR-449a inhibitor was transfected along with miR-449a mimic, the G1 block was suppressed, confirming that miR-449a overexpression was the cause of the observed G1 arrest (Fig. 3H). Similarly, the decrease in rate of DNA synthesis due to overexpression of miR-449a was reversed by miR-449a inhibitor (Fig. 3I). To verify the functional significance of miR-449a expression, we investigated the effect of miR-449a overexpression on various tumor-associated phenotypes of U2OS cells. We utilized in vitro transwell migration and invasion assays to assess the effects of miR-449a overexpression on cell migration and invasion ability. We observed that miR-449a overexpression inhibited the cell migration ability of U2OS cells (Fig. 4A, i and ii). Furthermore, the invasion of U2OS cells through a Matrigel-coated synthetic membrane was significantly suppressed upon miR-449a overexpression (Fig. 4B, i and ii). Next, we determined the effect of miR-449a on the clonogenic ability of U2OS cells after transfecting with miR-449a or control mimic followed by crystal violet staining and colony counting after 12 days. The ectopic expression of miR-449a led to a marked reduction in the colony-forming ability of U2OS cells (Fig. 4C, i and ii). Finally, we also performed a scratch-wound assay to demonstrate the role of miR-449a in modulating the healing ability of U2OS cells. The assay was carried out by scratching a wound in the monolayer of confluent miR-449a mimic– or control mimic–transfected U2OS cells and then monitoring the size of the wound for 48 h. It was found that control cells displayed an absolute healing of the wound within 48 h, whereas in miR-449a mimic–transfected cells, around two-thirds of the damaged region could be healed in the same duration (Fig. 4D, i and ii). Overall, we have established that the ectopic expression of CCNA2–regulating miRNA, miR-449a, intrudes on the oncogenic features of U2OS cells. Next, we wanted to evaluate the physiological role of miR-449a in the tumor microenvironment; growth factor deficiency, a characteristic of the tumor microenvironment, has been used to understand the adaptation of cancer cells and subsequent tumor progression (25Hanahan D. Coussens L.M. Accessories to the crime: functions of cells recruited to the tumor microenvironment.Cancer Cell. 2012; 21 (22439926): 309-32210.1016/j.ccr.2012.02.022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2916) Google Scholar, 26Vander Heiden M.G.

Thus, to determine the role of miR-449a in mediating quiescence in the tumor microenvironment, we analyzed the levels of miR-449a and CCNA2 in serum-starved and serum-resupplemented U2OS cells. Serum starvation was induced in U2OS cells by growing the cells in serum-free medium for 48 h and then resupplementing with fresh medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum for 24 h following starvation. Flow cytometry for propidium iodide–stained DNA established that serum starvation for 48 h led to an increase in the G0/G1 population, indicating cell cycle exit, whereas serum restimulation for 24 h resulted in cell cycle reentry, seen as a clear accumulation in the S phase (Fig. 4E). Interestingly, we observed that serum starvation in U2OS induces miR-449a expression, and serum restimulation restores the normal levels of the miRNA, whereas the expression of CCNA2 was inversely regulated during the same conditions (Fig. 4F, i and ii). Thus, the growth factor deficiency observed in the tumor microenvironment would result in miR-449a mediated repression of CCNA2, leading to cell cycle arrest. We have shown that miR-449a inhibits S phase progression and cell proliferation by targeting CCNA2. To further establish that the delay in S phase progression was primarily due to miR-449a–mediated down-regulation of CCNA2, we cloned the coding region of the CCNA2 gene, which lacks the site for miR-449a binding, into a retroviral vector. U2OS cells stably expressing CCNA2 were then transfected with miR-449a, followed by incubation with BrdU, to evaluate the rate of DNA synthesis. We found that the endogenous cyclin A2 protein levels were down-regulated in both samples transfected with miR-449a mimic, whereas the exogenously expressed CCNA2 remained unaffected upon miR-449a overexpression (Fig. 5A). Ectopic expression of miR-449a significantly reduced the population of BrdU-positive cells, but co-expression of miR-449a–resistant CCNA2 partially restored the DNA synthesis, demonstrating that the effect of miR-449a on the S phase progression was primarily due to down-regulation of CCNA2 (Fig. 5B). Apart from CCNA2, miR-449a is predicted to target other key cell cycle regulators, and we wanted to identify the protein whose inhibition is key for the observed cell cycl"

At d 7, all cell types presented cytoskeleton alignment perpendicular to the applied load independently of the use of MMC. MMC enhanced ECM deposition in all cell types. Gene expression analysis indicated that MMC and mechanical loading maintained TC phenotype, whereas tenogenic differentiation of BMSCs or transdifferentiation of dermal fibroblasts was not achieved.

https://openalex.org/W2888702454,"Background Gait analysis can be used to measure variations in joint function in patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA), and is useful when observing longitudinal biomechanical changes following Total Knee Replacement (TKR) surgery. The Cardiff Classifier is an objective classification tool applied previously to examine the extent of biomechanical recovery following TKR. In this study, it is further developed to reveal the salient features that contribute to recovery towards healthy function. Methods Gait analysis was performed on 30 patients before and after TKR surgery, and 30 healthy controls. Median TKR follow-up time was 13 months. The combined application of principal component analysis (PCA) and the Cardiff Classifier defined 18 biomechanical features that discriminated OA from healthy gait. Statistical analysis tested whether these features were affected by TKR surgery and, if so, whether they recovered to values found for the controls. Results The Cardiff Classifier successfully discriminated between OA and healthy gait in all 60 cases. Of the 18 discriminatory features, only six (33%) were significantly affected by surgery, including features in all three planes of the ground reaction force (p<0.001), ankle dorsiflexion moment (p<0.001), hip adduction moment (p = 0.003), and transverse hip angle (p = 0.007). All but two (89%) of these features remained significantly different to those of the control group after surgery. Conclusions This approach was able to discriminate gait biomechanics associated with knee OA. The ground reaction force provided the strongest discriminatory features. Despite increased gait velocity and improvements in self-reported pain and function, which would normally be clinical indicators of recovery, the majority of features were not affected by TKR surgery. This TKR cohort retained pre-operative gait patterns; reduced sagittal hip and knee moments, decreased knee flexion, increased hip flexion, and reduced hip adduction. The changes that were associated with surgery were predominantly found at the ankle and hip, rather than at the knee."

This analysis revealed high prevalence of macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae (MRMP) in Osaka during 2011 and 2014 with annual detection rates of MRMP strains between 71.4% and 81.8%. However, in 2015 and after, the detection rate of MRMP decreased significantly and did not exceed 50%. Genotyping of the p1 gene of these isolates showed that most of MRMP strains harbored type 1 p1 gene. In contrast, strains expressing p1 gene type 2 or its variant were largely macrolide-susceptible M. pneumoniae (MSMP) strains. There was a strong correlation between p1 gene genotype and the presence of mutations conferring macrolide resistance in M. pneumoniae isolated in Osaka. These results indicate that lower incidence of MRMP strains in Osaka from 2015 was associated with the relative increase of p1 gene type 2 lineage strains. During these experiments, we also isolated three M. pneumoniae strains that showed irregular typing pattern in the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analysis of the p1 gene. Two of these strains harbored new variants of type 2 p1 gene and were designated as type 2f and 2g. The remaining strain with an irregular typing pattern had a large deletion in the p1 operon."
https://openalex.org/W2913837964,"Introduction BMI is the most commonly used indicator to evaluate overweight and obesity, but it cannot distinguish changes in body composition. Over recent years, it has been demonstrated that bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) is a more accurate method for analyzing body composition. Bioelectrical impedance vector analysis (BIVA) has revealed its effectiveness as an indicator of nutritional status and hydration. Objective To assess the usefulness of bioimpedance analysis on the study of body composition in a group of children with overweight and obesity. Materials and methods Cross-sectional observational study. The anthropometric parameters of 167 (79 were older than 12 years) overweight and obese children were recorded. Their body composition was analyzed using BIA and BIVA, and was classified based on different criteria. Concordance was analyzed (intraclass correlation coefficient, Bland-Altman analysis and weighted Kappa coefficient). The BIVA of the subgroups was compared using the Mahalanobis distance and Hotelling’s T2. Statistical significance was considered for p<0.05. Results The BMI revealed that the majority of the assessed subjects were obese, although 12% had a normal percentage of fat mass (%FM). The classification by Z-BMI and Z-%FM significantly discriminate between subjects with different levels of adiposity. In children over the age of 12, the classification of fat mass index also discriminates significantly between obesity and non-obesity. As anticipated, in the tolerance ellipses, most of the individual vectors were situated in the left lower quadrant. Conclusions BIVA reflects differences in the bioelectric patterns of children who are classified as being overweight or obese (BMI) and who have different levels of %FM and FMI. BIVA permits a fast and easy monitoring of the evolution of the nutritional state and changes associated with body composition, and it identifies those children whose body compartments may be precisely estimated using traditional BIA methods."
https://openalex.org/W2911569837,"DNA damage–mediated activation of extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK) can regulate both cell survival and cell death. We show here that ERK activation in this context is biphasic and that early and late activation events are mediated by distinct upstream signals that drive cell survival and apoptosis, respectively. We identified the nuclear kinase mitogen-sensitive kinase 1 (MSK1) as a downstream target of both early and late ERK activation. We also observed that activation of ERK→MSK1 up to 4 h after DNA damage depends on epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), as EGFR or mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (MEK)/ERK inhibitors or short hairpin RNA–mediated MSK1 depletion enhanced cell death. This prosurvival response was partially mediated through enhanced DNA repair, as EGFR or MEK/ERK inhibitors delayed DNA damage resolution. In contrast, the second phase of ERK→MSK1 activation drove apoptosis and required protein kinase Cδ (PKCδ) but not EGFR. Genetic disruption of PKCδ reduced ERK activation in an in vivo irradiation model, as did short hairpin RNA–mediated depletion of PKCδ in vitro. In both models, PKCδ inhibition preferentially suppressed late activation of ERK. We have shown previously that nuclear localization of PKCδ is necessary and sufficient for apoptosis. Here we identified a nuclear PKCδ→ERK→MSK1 signaling module that regulates apoptosis. We also show that expression of nuclear PKCδ activates ERK and MSK1, that ERK activation is required for MSK1 activation, and that both ERK and MSK1 activation are required for apoptosis. Our findings suggest that location-specific activation by distinct upstream regulators may enable distinct functional outputs from common signaling pathways.

This study identified functional mechanisms of triclosan resistance (TCSR) in WW metagenomes, and assessed the frequency of TCSR in WW-derived and clinical isolates of Escherichia coli and Enterococcus spp. Metagenomic DNA extracted from WW was used to profile the microbiome and construct large-insert cosmid libraries, which were screened for TCSR. Resistant cosmids were sequenced and the TCSR determinant identified by transposon mutagenesis. Wastewater Enterococcus spp. (N = 94) and E. coli (N = 99) and clinical Enterococcus spp. (N = 146) and vancomycin-resistant E. faecium (VRE; N = 149) were collected and tested for resistance to triclosan and a comprehensive drug panel. Functional metagenomic screening revealed diverse FabV homologs as major WW TCSR determinants. Resistant clones harboured sequences likely originating from Aeromonas spp., a common WW microbe. The triclosan MIC90s for E. coli, E. faecalis, and E. faecium isolates were 0.125, 32, and 32 mg/L, respectively. For E. coli, there was no correlation between the triclosan MIC and any drug tested. Negative correlations were detected between the triclosan MIC and levofloxacin resistance for E. faecalis, and between triclosan and vancomycin, teicoplanin, and ampicillin resistance for E. faecium. Thus, FabV homologs were the major contributor to the WW triclosan resistome and high-level TCSR was not observed in WW or clinical isolates. Elevated triclosan MICs were not positively correlated with antimicrobial resistance to any drug tested."

We aimed to identify the distal, underlying, and proximal dietary and non-dietary factors associated with length-for-age (LFA) of infants and young children in Ethiopia. Methods We used a nationally representative sample of 2,932 children aged 6–23 months from the Ethiopian demographic and health survey (EDHS) conducted in 2016. Hierarchical regression analysis was done to identify the factors associated with LFA. Findings Pastoral residence (adjusted β (aβ) = -0.56, 95%CI = -0.82, -0.31, P<0.001) and poorest household wealth category (aβ = -0.57, 95%CI = -0.66, -0.48, P<0.001) were the basic factors negatively associated with LFA. Among underlying factors, maternal wasting (aβ = -0.43, 95%CI = -0.58, -0.28, P<0.001), and unimproved toilet facility (aβ = -0.48, 95%CI = -0.73, -0.23, P<0.001) were negatively associated with LFA. Proximal factors found positively associated with LFA were dietary diversity (aβ = 0.09, 95%CI = 0.043, 0.136, P<0.001), meal frequency (aβ = 0.04, 95%CI = 0.00, 0.08, P = 0.042), and vitamin A supplementation (aβ = 0.16, 95%CI = 0.03, 0.29, P = 0.020).

Conclusion LFA was associated with various influences at distal, underlying, and proximal levels. A multi-pronged approach, addressing the various factors comprehensively, would represent an important consideration to promote linear growth in early childhood in Ethiopia."
https://openalex.org/W2952094255,"Type IV secretion systems exist in a number of bacterial pathogens and are used to secrete effector proteins directly into host cells in order to change their environment making the environment hospitable for the bacteria. In recent years, several machine learning algorithms have been developed to predict effector proteins, potentially facilitating experimental verification. However, inconsistencies exist between their results. Previously we analysed the disparate sets of predictive features used in these algorithms to determine an optimal set of 370 features for effector prediction. This study focuses on the best way to use these optimal features by designing three machine learning classifiers, comparing our results with those of others, and obtaining de novo results. We chose the pathogen Legionella pneumophila strain Philadelphia-1, a cause of Legionnaires’ disease, because it has many validated effector proteins and others have developed machine learning prediction tools for it. While all of our models give good results indicating that our optimal features are quite robust, Model 1, which uses all 370 features with a support vector machine, has slightly better accuracy. Moreover, Model 1 predicted 472 effector proteins that are deemed highly probable to be effectors and include 94% of known effectors. Although the results of our three models agree well with those of other researchers, their models only predicted 126 and 311 candidate effectors."
https://openalex.org/W2914461011,"Interleukin-1 receptor–associated kinase 4 (IRAK4) is a key player in innate immune and inflammatory responses, performing a critical role in signal transduction downstream of Toll-like receptors and interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptors. Upon ligand binding and via its N-terminal death domain, IRAK4 is recruited to an oligomeric receptor that is proximal to the Myddosome signaling complex, inducing IRAK4 kinase domain dimerization, autophosphorylation, and activation. To date, all known IRAK4 structures are in the active conformation, precluding a good understanding of IRAK4’s conformational dynamics. To address this issue, here we first solved three crystal structures of the IRAK4 kinase domain (at ≤2.6 Å resolution), in its unphosphorylated, inactive state bound to either the ATP analog AMP-PNP or to one of the two small-molecule inhibitors JH-I-25 and JH-I-17. The structures disclosed that although the structure in complex with AMP-PNP is in an “αC-out” inactive conformation, those in complex with type I inhibitors assume an active “Asp–Phe–Gly (DFG)-in” and “αC-in” conformation. The ability of unphosphorylated IRAK4 to take on variable conformations prompted us to screen for small-molecule inhibitors that bind preferentially to unphosphorylated IRAK4, leading to the identification of ponatinib and HG-12-6. Solving the structures of unphosphorylated IRAK4 in complex with these two inhibitors, we found that they both bind as type II inhibitors with IRAK4 in a “DFG-out” conformation. Collectively, these structures reveal conformational flexibility of unphosphorylated IRAK4 and provide unexpected insights into the potential use of small molecules to modulate IRAK4 activity in cancer, autoimmunity, and inflammation.

IRAK4 is the most upstream kinase in this pathway and associates directly with MyD88, an essential interaction for Myddosome formation.

Taken together, these results make inhibition of IRAK4 an attractive therapeutic target. Although IRAK4 kinase activity is greatly enhanced upon phosphorylation (5Ferrao R. Zhou H. Shan Y. Liu Q. Li Q. Shaw D.E. Li X. Wu H. IRAK4 dimerization and trans-autophosphorylation are induced by myddosome assembly.Mol.

Phosphorylation-independent kinase activation is typically induced by the binding of an allosteric activator protein to induce adoption of the active conformation. Rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma kinases, cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), and the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family kinases are activated in this manner (16Hu J. Stites E.C. Yu H.

However, no structures of inactive conformations of IRAK4 have been solved, leaving the regulatory mechanism obscured. Here we present five crystal structures of the unphosphorylated IRAK4 kinase domain in complex with AMP-PNP and four small molecule inhibitors. These structures reveal that unphosphorylated IRAK4 can adopt different conformations depending on the bound small molecule, suggesting its conformational flexibility. We hypothesize that targeting these specific conformations will aid in the development of highly potent and selective small molecule IRAK4 inhibitors for a variety of indications. We expressed a construct containing the catalytically dead D311N mutant of IRAK4KD in insect cells and purified it to homogeneity as described previously (5Ferrao R. Zhou H. Shan Y. Liu Q. Li Q.

The protein was co-crystallized with the nonhydrolyzable ATP analog AMP-PNP and Mg2+, and we determined its structure at 2.6 Å resolution (Table 1). A single IRAK4KD-D311N molecule comprises the asymmetric unit, and the electron density for the bound AMP-PNP in the active site was clearly visible (Fig. S1, A and B). Surprisingly, the overall conformation of the unphosphorylated IRAK4KD bound to AMP-PNP (Fig. 1A) was immediately distinguishable from previously solved structure of the phosphorylated, AMP-PNP–bound IRAK4 and other IRAK4 structures in an active conformation (Fig. 1A) (5Ferrao R.

In the current unphosphorylated IRAK4 structure, the N-terminal end of the αC helix is translated away from the active site by ∼8 Å and rotated by ∼20° along its axis, positioning Glu233 toward the activation loop and breaking the catalytically important salt bridge between Glu233 and the active site residue Lys213 (“αC-out”) (Fig. 1, A and B).Table 1Crystallographic statisticsPDB code6EGF6EGD6EGE6EGA6EG9LigandAMP-PNPJH-I-17JH-I-25HG-12–6PonatinibConstructArg164–Ser460 (D311N)Arg164–Ser460 (D311N)Arg164–Ser460 (D311N)Arg164–Ser460 (WT, dephosphorylated)Arg164–Ser460 (WT, dephosphorylated)Structure determinationMolecular replacementMolecular replacementMolecular replacementMolecular replacementMolecular replacementData collectionBeamlineAPS 24-ID-CNSLS X25ANSLS X4AAPS 24-ID-CAPS 24-ID-ESpace groupP6322P21P21P6122P6122Cell dimensionsa, b, c (Å)135.2, 135.2, 126.471.6, 59.5, 75.670.9, 58.6, 76.184.6, 84.6, 429.084.9, 84.9, 433.9α, β, γ (°)90.0, 90.0, 120.090.0, 111.8, 90.090.0, 112.8, 90.090.0, 90.0, 120.090.0, 90.0, 120.0Wavelength (Å)0.981.100.980.980.98Resolution (Å)85.9–2.6 (2.7–2.6)44.3–2.1 (2.2–2.1)37.6–1.4 (1.5–1.4)73.3–2.5 (2.6–2.5)73.6–2.3 (2.4–2.3)CC½1 (0.76)1 (0.77)1 (0.85)1 (0.54)1 (0.71)Rmerge0.073 (1.73)0.053 (0.93)0.053 (0.92)0.210 (1.86)0.112 (2.32)Mean I/σI26.3 (2.1)21.2 (2.0)17.8 (2.4)21.7 (1.6)22.5 (1.9)Completeness (%)99.8 (99.4)99.3 (98.2)98.1 (94.9)99.4 (94.8)100.0 (100.0)Total reflections405,129 (40,265)228,850 (22,254)833,848 (79,412)1,143,455 (81,435)1,050,373 (82,983)Unique reflections21,291 (2,079)34388 (3,358)110,700 (10,742)32,497 (3,388)50,049 (4,233)Multiplicity19.0 (19.4)6.7 (6.6)7.5 (7.4)35.2 (24.0)21.0 (19.6)RefinementRwork/Rfree (%)20.5/22.918.4/22.917.8/20.227.2/29.821.0/24.6Average B-factor (Å2)87.756.832.578.354.0Proteins88.157.131.778.463.0Ligands86.444.921.773.156.9Root mean square deviationsBond lengths (Å)/angles (°)0.01/0.440.01/1.110.01/1.170.006/1.110.01/1.31Ramachandran plot, favored/outliers (%)96.4/0.096.6/0.098.7/0.097.5/0.098.0/0.0 Open table in a new tab The outward movement of the αC helix appears to be coupled to conformational changes in the activation loop and the Asp–Phe–Gly (DFG) motif. In phosphorylated IRAK4, the activation loop adopts an elongated conformation that is stabilized by a salt bridge between Arg334 and the phosphate group of pThr345 (Fig. 1, A and B). An additional water-mediated salt bridge forms between Arg310 and pThr345 (Fig. 1B). In unphosphorylated IRAK4, the majority of the activation loop is unresolved in the electron density map and therefore is most likely unstructured. The region of the activation segment immediately downstream of the DFG motif, Leu332–Lys338, assembles into a short α-helix (Fig. 1A). This α-helix packs into the remaining space vacated by the αC helix in the unphosphorylated conformation. Leu332, which is solvent-facing in the active conformation, is relocated to the core of the N-lobe, occupying the space where the critical Glu233 residue would be in the active conformation (Fig. 1B). In the phosphorylated IRAK4 structure, the Asp329 side chain of the DFG motif faces outward toward the solvent (Fig. 1C). In the current unphosphorylated structure, Asp329 has flipped toward the active site, where it coordinates a Mg2+ ion (Fig. 1C). The side chain of Phe330 is flipped toward the αC helix, where it packs against Leu302, Met237, and Cys240 to fill a site occupied by Val236 on the αC helix in phosphorylated IRAK4 (Fig. 1C). Despite the conformational changes, the DFG motif of AMP-PNP–bound IRAK4 is still considered in a “DFG-in” conformation that is more similar to the DFG-in conformation of the active kinase state than the “DFG-out” conformation of a type II kinase inhibitor–bound state (35Roskoski Jr., R. Classification of small molecule protein kinase inhibitors based upon the structures of their drug-enzyme complexes.Pharmacol. Res. 2016; 103 (26529477): 26-4810.1016/j.phrs.2015.10.021Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). The assembly of the regulatory spine (R-spine) is a hallmark of kinase domains in the active conformation (20Taylor S.S. Kornev A.P. Protein kinases: evolution of dynamic regulatory proteins.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2011; 36 (20971646): 65-7710.1016/j.tibs.2010.09.006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). The R-spine is a collection of four residues from the His–Arg–Asp (HRD) motif (RS1), the DFG motif (RS2), the αC helix (RS3), and the β4 strand (RS4). In the phosphorylated IRAK4 KD, the residues Leu248, Met237, Phe330, and His309 align into a rigid hydrophobic column (Fig. S1C), indicative of an active conformation. In the unphosphorylated IRAK4 KD, the outward movement of the αC helix serves to displace the RS3 residue Met237 from the R-spine (Fig. 2A). The combined rearrangements of the DFG motif and the αC helix in the unphosphorylated conformation result in the disassembly of the R-spine, confirming that the kinase is in an inactive conformation (Fig. 2A). In the current unphosphorylated IRAK4 structure, Mg2+ ion coordination is also distinct, with a single ion interacting with all three phosphate groups of AMP-PNP (Fig. 2B). The movement of the Asp329 side chain of the DFG motif toward the active site facilitates its coordination of the Mg2+ ion (Figs. 1B and 2B). Asn316 makes an additional contact with the Mg2+. Typically, an active, phosphorylated protein kinase requires two Mg2+ ions to catalyze the transfer of phosphate groups to substrate. The conformation of the unphosphorylated IRAK4 KD closely resembles the “CDK2/c-Src” inactive kinase conformation previously observed in the crystal structures of c-Src (PDB code 2SRC) (36Xu W. Doshi A. Lei M. Eck M.J. Harrison S.C. Crystal structures of c-Src reveal features of its autoinhibitory mechanism.Mol.

This inactive conformation is recognized as “αC-out” and has been exploited for type I1/2 inhibitors such as lapatinib (35Roskoski Jr., R.

Comparison of the current unphosphorylated IRAK4 KD bound to AMP-PNP with CDK2 and EGFR (in complex with ATP and AMP-PNP, respectively) shows a shared outward position of the αC helix (αC-out) (Fig. 3A). In all three kinases, the activation loop has assembled into a short inhibitory helix that packs into the active site, and the side-chain movement of the DFG Asp329 residue allows for the coordination of a single Mg2+ ion (Fig. 3A). The position of the Mg2+ ion is shared among all three kinases. These conformation-dependent differences in both the nucleotide conformation and Mg2+ coordination have been previously noted in both CDK2 (PDB code 1HCK) (39De Bondt H.L. Rosenblatt J. Jancarik J. Jones H.D. Morgan D.O. Kim S.H.

The DFG Asp residue also interacts with the catalytic lysine from strand β3 (Fig. 3A). In all three kinases, a rotation in the αC helix removes the critical glutamate residue from the active site. Instead, this αC glutamate points downwards toward the inhibitory helix (Fig. 3A). The overall conformation of the DFG motif and the inhibitory helix are closely shared among the inactive conformations of IRAK4, CDK2, and EGFR (Fig. 3B). Although IRAK4, c-Src, Abl, EGFR, and CDK2 are members of different kinase families (tyrosine kinase-like family for IRAK4; tyrosine kinase family for c-Src, Abl,"

We retrospectively evaluated pretransplant clinical and Doppler echocardiographic data of 839 consecutive LT recipients from 2009 to 2012 aged 18–60 years. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality at 4 years. The overall survival rate was 91.2%. In multivariate Cox analysis, reduced LV ejection fraction (LVEF, P = 0.014) and decreased transmitral E/A ratio(P = 0.022) remained significant prognosticators. In LVSF analysis, patients with LVEF≤60% (quartile [Q]1) had higher mortality than those with LVEF>60% (hazard ratio = 1.90, 95% confidence interval = 1.15–3.15, P = 0.012). In LVDF analysis, patients with an E/A ratio<0.9(Q1) had a 2.19-fold higher risk of death (95% confidence interval = 1.11–4.32, P = 0.024) than those with an E/A ratio>1.4(Q4). In combined LVDF and LVSF analysis, patients with an E/A ratio<0.9 and LVEF≤60% had poorer survival outcomes than patients with an E/A ratio≥0.9 and LVEF>60% (79.5% versus 93.3%, P = 0.001). Patients with an early mitral inflow velocity/annular velocity (E/e’ ratio)>11.5(Q4) and LV stroke volume index (LVSVI)<33mL/m2(Q1) showed worse survival than those with an E/e’ ratio≤11.5 and LVSVI ≥33mL/m2(78.4% versus 92.2%, P = 0.003).

https://openalex.org/W2913090449,"Tribbles 3 (TRB3) is a pseudokinase that has been found in multiple tissues in response to various stress stimuli, such as nutrient deprivation and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. We recently found that TRB3 has the potential to regulate skeletal muscle mass at the basal state. However, it has not yet been explored whether TRB3 regulates skeletal muscle mass under atrophic conditions. Here, we report that food deprivation for 48 h in mice significantly reduces muscle mass by ∼15% and increases TRB3 expression, which is associated with increased ER stress. Interestingly, inhibition of ER stress in C2C12 myotubes reduces food deprivation-induced expression of TRB3 and muscle-specific E3-ubiquitin ligases. In further in vivo experiments, muscle-specific TRB3 transgenic mice increase food deprivation-induced muscle atrophy compared with wild-type (WT) littermates presumably by the increased proteolysis. On the other hand, TRB3 knockout mice ameliorate food deprivation-induced atrophy compared with WT littermates by preserving a higher protein synthesis rate. These results indicate that TRB3 plays a pivotal role in skeletal muscle mass regulation under food deprivation-induced muscle atrophy and TRB3 could be a pharmaceutical target to prevent skeletal muscle atrophy.-Choi, R.

https://openalex.org/W2953065137,"Ultraviolet A (UVA) radiation is harmful for living organisms but in low doses may stimulate cell proliferation. Our aim was to examine the relationships between exposure to different low UVA doses, cellular proliferation, and changes in cellular reactive oxygen species levels. In human colon cancer (HCT116) and melanoma (Me45) cells exposed to UVA doses comparable to environmental, the highest doses (30–50 kJ/m2) reduced clonogenic potential but some lower doses (1 and 10 kJ/m2) induced proliferation. This effect was cell type and dose specific. In both cell lines the levels of reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide fluctuated with dynamics which were influenced differently by UVA; in Me45 cells decreased proliferation accompanied the changes in the dynamics of H2O2 while in HCT116 cells those of superoxide. Genes coding for proteins engaged in redox systems were expressed differently in each cell line; transcripts for thioredoxin, peroxiredoxin and glutathione peroxidase showed higher expression in HCT116 cells whereas those for glutathione transferases and copper chaperone were more abundant in Me45 cells. We conclude that these two cell types utilize different pathways for regulating their redox status. Many mechanisms engaged in maintaining cellular redox balance have been described. Here we show that the different cellular responses to a stimulus such as a specific dose of UVA may be consequences of the use of different redox control pathways. Assays of superoxide and hydrogen peroxide level changes after exposure to UVA may clarify mechanisms of cellular redox regulation and help in understanding responses to stressing factors."

Oscillations are thought to play a central role in neuronal computations because they provide an energy-efficient way to coordinate interactions within and between networks by creating alternating periods of increased and decreased neuronal excitability. Depending on the brain region and behavioral state, oscillations of distinct frequencies predominate, but many can coexist and interact in the same or different networks (Buzsáki et al., 2013Buzsáki G.

As oscillatory signals converge and diverge within and between neuronal networks, they undergo multiple nonlinear transformations (Hille, 2001Hille B. Ion Channels of Excitable Membranes.

Untangling dendrites with quantitative models.Science. 2000; 290: 744-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). In other fields such as electronics and acoustics, it has long been appreciated that applying a nonlinearity to the sum of two oscillations, S1 and S2, with frequencies f1 and f2, results in new oscillations. While these can occur at any combinations of integral multiples of the two input signals’ frequencies (n∙f1 + m∙f2), for weak nonlinearities the most conspicuous occur at f1 and f2 themselves (the “fundamental” frequencies), at double these frequencies (the second “harmonic” components), as well as at the sum of and difference between f1 and f2 (the “emergent” components). This process is known variously as frequency mixing, spectral mixing, or the heterodyne principle (Fessenden, 1902Fessenden, R.U.S. (1902). Wireless signaling (heterodyne principle). US patent 706,740, filed September 28, 1901, and granted August 12, 1902.Google Scholar, Poole, 2015Poole I. A Guide to Superheterodyne Radio Technology. Adrio Communications, 2015Google Scholar). In the following, we will adopt the term roots, rather than fundamentals, to refer to inputs, so that their abbreviations, R1 and R2, referring to the faster and slower of these oscillations, respectively, are not confused with our notation for frequency. We likewise denote the higher- and lower-frequency emergent components as E1 and E2 and the second harmonics of R1 and R2 as H1 and H2. If frequency mixing were expressed in neural activity, it would imply that not all oscillations present in local field potentials (LFPs) stem from the rhythmic activity of input neurons at corresponding frequencies. Instead, some frequency components would result from the nonlinear integration of convergent oscillatory signals by downstream neurons. Furthermore, recognizing when frequency mixing occurs would distinguish signals converging on a common target from those that are created by nonlinear interactions (mixing) or co-expressed in the LFP through volume conduction. Importantly, it was demonstrated that frequency mixing is expressed in the brain in response to artificial stimulation. In the primary somatosensory cortex, bilateral stimulation of vibrissae at different frequencies induced spectral peaks not only at the stimulated frequencies but also at their sum and difference (Ahrens et al., 2002Ahrens K.F. Levine H. Suhl H. Kleinfeld D. Spectral mixing of rhythmic neuronal signals in sensory cortex.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99: 15176-15181Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Furthermore, mixing was also seen between oscillations caused by rhythmic stimulation and an ongoing brain oscillation (Ahrens et al., 2002Ahrens K.F. Levine H. Suhl H. Kleinfeld D. Spectral mixing of rhythmic neuronal signals in sensory cortex.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99: 15176-15181Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Frequency mixing was also utilized to modulate neural activity in deep structures by applying high-frequency electric fields outside the brain, opening potential therapeutic applications (Grossman et al., 2017Grossman N. Bono D. Dedic N. Kodandaramaiah S.B. Rudenko A. Suk H.J. Cassara A.M. Neufeld E. Kuster N. Tsai L.H. et al.Noninvasive deep brain stimulation via temporally interfering electric fields.Cell. 2017; 169: 1029-1041.e16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Frequency mixing may also account for the generation of additional spectral components seen in the specialized electroreceptors of electric fish (Neiman and Russell, 2004Neiman A.B. Russell D.F. Two distinct types of noisy oscillators in electroreceptors of paddlefish.J. Neurophysiol. 2004; 92: 492-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In this study, varying temperature facilitated the identification of the two interacting oscillations by modulating their frequency. In contrast with these controlled conditions, however, spontaneous oscillations in LFPs are often transient and non-stationary in amplitude and frequency, hindering detection of frequency mixing. As a result, it remains unclear how widely mixing is expressed endogenously and whether emergent frequencies entrain neuronal activity. Thus, to address these questions, we introduce a new method to detect when mixing occurs and infer the identity of the original signals and emergent frequencies. As detailed below, this new method focuses on the analysis of phase rather than frequency relationships, allowing reliable detection of mixing. Using this approach, we show that frequency mixing is widely expressed in the brain and that emergent components entrain unit activity. We first describe frequency mixing for two signals. The presentation roughly follows that given in Ahrens et al., 2002Ahrens K.F. Levine H. Suhl H. Kleinfeld D. Spectral mixing of rhythmic neuronal signals in sensory cortex.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99: 15176-15181Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar but with a quadratic rather than step-function nonlinearity. This choice gives a simpler result, yielding six frequency components from the transformation of the two original signals. Note that this nonlinearity constitutes a second-order approximation to an arbitrary nonlinear function. The process is illustrated in Figure 1 for two signals with frequencies centered around 100 and 40 Hz, respectively. We assume that around the time of data measurement k (tk), signals S1 and S2, with higher and lower average frequency, respectively, are of the form:S(t−tk)=Akcos(2πfkt−φk)(Equation 1) where Ak, fk, and φk represent their instantaneous amplitude, frequency, and phase (Figure 1A). The amplitude and frequency of the signals fluctuate over time, independently of one another, but slowly enough that these instantaneous quantities are well defined and may be recovered through time-frequency analysis. We note that, for both single- and multi-component signals, identifying these signal properties and the conditions under which they exist in a meaningful sense is a long-standing problem still under investigation (Cohen et al., 1999Cohen L. Loughlin P. Vakman D. On an ambiguity in the definition of the amplitude and phase of a signal.Signal Processing. 1999; 79: 301-307Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar, Gabor, 1947Gabor D.

Signal Process. 2014; 62: 6171-6183Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Frequency mixing occurs when S1 and S2 are provided as input to a nonlinear activation function (Figure 1B) given by:Fs=B+Cs+Ds2(Equation 2) The constant B is set so that the resulting output oscillates around a mean of 0, and we omit it in the equations that follow. C defines a linear amplification factor, and D determines the magnitude of the quadratic nonlinearity. Expanding the result of F applied to S1 and S2 gives:FS1+S2=CS1+CS2+DS12+DS22+2DS1S2(Equation 3) Replacing the signals in Equation 3 by their full sinusoidal representation and applying the product-to-sum trigonometric identity yields a sum of six sinusoids (Figure 1C), namely, the “root” components, R1 and R2, at the input signal frequencies themselves, the harmonic components, H1 and H2, at twice the root frequencies, and the emergent components, E1 and E2, at the sum of and difference between the root frequencies, respectively. The amplitude and phase of the output components are similarly related to those of the inputs. Figure 1D lists these properties for sinusoids in the form of Equation 1. We next consider the task of identifying signal components consistent with the relationships predicted under frequency mixing, specifically when input signal properties are unknown and may fluctuate with time. Estimates of amplitude and phase across time and frequency can be obtained through wavelet analysis (see STAR Methods). Averaging amplitude over time samples gives a spectrum with peaks at expected frequencies (Figure 1E, left) for the roots (40 and 100 Hz), harmonics (80 and 200 Hz), and emergent components (60 and 140 Hz). Amplitude fluctuations across time at these peak frequencies are correlated, as expected (Figure 1E, right panels). However, frequency and amplitude are generally of limited utility for detecting the component relationships consistent with frequency mixing, particularly when input frequencies are unknown. Whereas resolving distinct frequency peaks in power spectra requires limited variability of the signal frequencies, to test the predicted frequency “correlations” (e.g., the correlation between the frequencies of R1 and E1), it is preferable that frequencies show more variability. A similar problem exists for spectral amplitudes. Moreover, unrelated signal artifacts may induce amplitude correlations across all frequencies. In contrast, as the phases of components continuously traverse their entire dynamic range, they provide an intrinsically richer expression of the components’ interdependence. Furthermore, as described below, frequency mixing predicts a peculiar and hitherto-undescribed phase relationship that cannot be explained by signal artifacts or other periodic waveforms with a complex harmonic structure. While the phase of a root signal is clearly related to that of its harmonic (Figure 1F), this relationship can also emerge from a range of phenomena such as waveform asymmetries (Cole and Voytek, 2017Cole S.R. Voytek B. Brain oscillations and the importance of waveform shape.Trends Cogn. Sci. 2017; 21: 137-149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) or cross-frequency coupling (Scheffer-Teixeira and Tort, 2016Scheffer-Teixeira R. Tort A.B. On cross-frequency phase-phase coupling between theta and gamma oscillations in the hippocampus.eLife. 2016; 5: e20515Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In contrast, for some triplets of frequency components, namely, those not including both a root signal with its harmonic, frequency mixing predicts an inherently 3-way phase relationship, specific to the particular triplet. These 3D phase distributions consist of parallel planar bands spaced and oriented distinctly for different combinations of component triplets (Figure 1G). The form of these distributions is such that the banding is only seen in the full 3D distribution and not in the 2D marginal distributions (Figure 1H). That is, while the phases of any two components are independent (Figure 1H), together they determine a limited set of possibilities for the phase of the third component (Figure 1G). Consider experimental data obtained at three frequencies, X-Y-Z, with the frequencies listed in descending order. We would like to determine whether or not a 3-way phase relationship exists between them and, if so, the component identities (e.g., E1, E2, H1, etc.) represented by X, Y, and Z. We thus face two problems: we first need a means of quantifying and distinguishing the predicted phase distributions under noisy conditions, and, second, we need a systematic mapping between the distinct phase distributions and component identities. We begin with the latter problem and describe how triplets of the components R1, R2, H1, H2, E1, and E2 allow a natural grouping that identifies them with their phase distributions. For all possible combinations of root frequencies, there exist 20 distinct ordered triplets, hereafter denoted triplet numbers, excluding triplets that include both a root and the harmonic of that root (Figure 2A, columns i and ii). Triplet numbers naturally fall into eight distinct classes based on the frequency relationship between components X, Y, and Z. For example, for triplet number 1, the component with the lowest frequency (Z, corresponding to the low emergent E2), is equal to the frequency of X minus the frequency of Y (corresponding to R1 and R2, respectively). The same relationship between components X, Y, and Z also occurs for triplets 2–6, even though the component identities of each triplet number are distinct. Below, we refer to these shared frequency relationships as triplet types (Figure 2A, columns iii and iv). Note that depending on the relative root frequencies, the same three components may occur in different order. For example, E2 (with frequency R1 minus R2) has a higher frequency than H2 (with frequency 2∙R2) only if the frequency of R1 > 3∙R2. Just as the triplet types share a relationship between component frequencies, they likewise share a relationship between phases that determines the form of the distribution. Figure 2B shows the eight representative phase distributions colored according to triplet type. Each of these three-way phase distributions shares the property, illustrated in Figures 1G and 1H, that while no relationship is apparent between the phases of any component pair (Figure 1H), a distinct pattern emerges when considering the triplet as a whole (Figure 1G). These eight distributions are readily detected and distinguished by computing their “volumetric” discrete Fourier transform, addressing the initial problem stated above. As each phase distribution consists of periodic planar densities, the large elements of its transform assume a linear arrangement, with elements corresponding to volumetric waves comprising the fundamental spatial frequency and harmonics of the distribution (Figure 2C). Because we are taking the transform of a real-valued function, the transform is symmetric across the origin and we can consider only the half-space of spatial frequencies with X-component positive. If we consider frequencies of −2 to 2 Hz in each spatial dimension, the transforms of the 8 triplet types are characterized by a single large coefficient, with the index of that coefficient specific to the triplet type (Figures 2A, column v, and 2D; Table S1). One caveat to this approach is that phase distributions with only pairwise relationships can also exhibit non-negligible power at the indices associated with the triplet types (Figure 2E). For 3-variable probability distributions, the 3-way relationship is given by the “interaction information,” which formally quantifies the multi-way dependence in the framework of information theory (Jakulin and Bratko, 2004Jakulin A. Bratko I. Quantifying and visualizing attribute interactions: an approach based on entropy.Entropy (Basel). 2004; 48: 1-30Google Scholar, McGill, 1954McGill W.J. Multivariate information transmission.Psychometrika. 1954; 19: 97-116Crossref Scopus (430) Google Scholar). While phase interaction information (pII) can be computed from the phase distributions by entropy approximation of the full and marginal distributions, it can also be accurately approximated in the spectral domain (see STAR Methods, Tables 2, and 3, Figures S1–S4). Below, we term this approximation “spectral-pII.” Importantly, because spectral-pII can be considered a parametric model (approximating key features of the data by a sparse representation in the spectral domain), it can be computed accurately with fewer data samples than interaction information (Figure S1).Table 1Total Recording SitesAmygdalaBFBNSTAcbStriatumAONOFCmPFCCortexn = 19n = 25n = 9n = 15n = 14n = 12n = 5n = 12n = 9Acb, nucleus accumbens; AON, anterior olfactory nucleus; BF, basal forebrain; BNST, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis; mPFC, medial prefrontal cortex; OFC, orbitofrontal cortex.

Cortex includes recordings from primary somatosensory, auditory, and visual cortices. Descriptions of variables and parameters involved in the spectral-pII computation is shown. Summary of the algorithm is shown. FFT, fast Fourier transform. The complete algorithm for estimating spectral-pII uses the phase samples for a given frequency triplet to compute a score for each of the eight triplet types. If statistically significant relative to distributions constructed from surrogate data (see STAR Methods and Figures S1 and S2), the largest of these scores determines the magnitude and type of the distribution. Computing spectral-pII for a “range” of frequency triplets yields clusters, with the clusters’ centroid corresponding to the average instantaneous frequency of the three related oscillatory signals. Clusters with large spectral-pII values (Figure 2F) are found to occur with the same centroids as pII (Figure 2G), computed for frequency mixing between 40- and 100-Hz input signals as in Figure 1 (the full set of simulation parameters are listed in Table S2). For other choices of root frequencies, the centroids of spectral-pII clusters shift position but remain restricted to one of eight planes affiliated with each of the eight triplet types (Figures 2A, column iv, 2H). The process of identifying frequency mixing in spontaneous neural data thus consists of (1) iteratively computing spectral-pII for all possible frequency triplets, (2) for each triplet, assessing significance of spectral-pII values based on distributions of surrogate data, (3) determining triplet type based on the largest of the eight spectral-pII scores, and (4) plotting significant spectral-pII values in 3D frequency space. A spectral-pII cluster of a particular triplet type identifies a set of possible root frequencies (Figure 2A, column vi), and root identities can be inferred by cross-referencing possibilities from multiple clusters. To test whether frequency mixing occurs in the brain, we obtained LFP and unit recordings from cortical and subcortical structures in rats (see Table 1). The data were segmented by behavioral state, including active waking (AW), slow-wave sleep (SWS), or in conditions of partial N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor blockade (MK-801, 0.1 mg/kg, i.p.). The latter state, which some consider a model of schizophrenia (Gonzalez-Burgos and Lewis, 2012Gonzalez-Burgos G. Lewis D.A. NMDA receptor hypofunction, parvalbumin-positive neurons, and cortical gamma oscillations in schizophrenia.Schizophr. Bull. 2012; 38: 950-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar), is particularly favorable to test the mixing model because it is associated with a stereotyped pattern of LFP activity (Hunt and Kasicki, 2013Hunt M.J. Kasicki S. A systematic review of the effects of NMDA receptor antagonists on oscillatory activity recorded in vivo.J. Psychopharmacol. (Oxford). 2013; 27: 972-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), including prominent high-frequency oscillations at ∼140 Hz. We first consider the case of the anterior olfactory nucleus (AON) under MK-801 (Figures 3A and 3B ). Similar results were obtained in the amygdala and related sites (Figure S5). We computed spectral-pII across all frequency triplets between 2 and 320 Hz, in 2-Hz increments, using 5,000 samples drawn from epochs where spectral power at 40, 100, and 140 Hz is moderate (Z score > 0; Figure 3B, red trace). Repeating this analysis on AON data obtained in four different experiments consistently revealed several prominent clusters of frequency triplets with high spectral-pII values: 6, 2, 2, 1, 1, and 1 of types 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, and 8, respectively (Figures 3C1–3C4). Many of these clusters are apparent without the Z score criteria. See Figure S5A for examples from four different rats. Several clusters with centroid coordinates that include 40 and 100 Hz exhibited an oblique shape (Figure 3C2, black arrow). The most pronounced of these, the type 1 cluster at 140,100,40, is consistent with 6 pairs of underlying roots for associated triplets 1–6. However, its shape suggests two in particular: Triplet-1 (R1,R2,E2), positing roots at 140 and 100 Hz, and Triplet-2 (R1,E2,R2), positing roots at 140 and 40 Hz. In both cases, variability in the frequency of the low root (R2) is expected to be negatively correlated with the frequency of the low emergent (E2), since E2 = R1-R2, giving rise to the oblique cluster shape. The observed data thus support frequency mixing occurring between a 140 Hz root signal, relatively stable in frequency, together with two more variable lower-frequency roots, around 40 or 100 Hz. To test this interpretation, we sorted our dataset and isolated periods where one of the mixing ty"

Decisions on, and funding for, TB prevention and care policies are decentralised to the provincial governments and therefore, tools to inform policy need to operate at this level. We describe the use of a mathematical model planning tool at provincial level in a high HIV and TB burden country, to estimate the impact on TB burden of achieving the 90-(90)-90 targets of the Stop TB Partnership Global Plan to End TB. “TIME Impact” is a freely available, user-friendly TB modelling tool. In collaboration with provincial TB programme staff, and the South African National TB Programme, models for three (of nine) provinces were calibrated to TB notifications, incidence, and screening data. Reported levels of TB programme activities were used as baseline inputs into the models, which were used to estimate the impact of scale-up of interventions focusing on screening, linkage to care and treatment success. All baseline models predicted a trend of decreasing TB incidence and mortality, consistent with recent data from South Africa. The projected impacts of the interventions differed by province and were greatly influenced by assumed current coverage levels. The absence of provincial TB burden estimates and uncertainty in current activity coverage levels were key data gaps. A user-friendly modelling tool allows TB burden and intervention impact projection at the sub-national level. Key sub-national data gaps should be addressed to improve the quality of sub-national model predictions."

The 2 types of thermogenic adipocytes, brown and beige, are thought to be of different origins but share functionally similar phenotypes. Here, we report that lysine-specific demethylase 2 (LSD2) regulates the expression of genes associated with lineage identity during the differentiation of brown and beige adipogenic progenitors in mice. In HB2 mouse brown preadipocytes, short hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown (KD) of LSD2 impaired formation of lipid droplet-containing adipocytes and down-regulated brown adipogenesis-associated genes. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that myogenesis-associated genes were up-regulated in LSD2-KD cells under adipogenic induction. In addition, loss of LSD2 during later phases of differentiation had no obvious influence on adipogenic traits, suggesting that LSD2 functions during earlier phases of brown adipocyte differentiation. Using adipogenic cells from the brown adipose tissues of LSD2-knockout (KO) mice, we found reduced expression of brown adipogenesis genes, whereas myogenesis genes were not affected. In contrast, when LSD2-KO cells from inguinal white adipose tissues were subjected to beige induction, these cells showed a dramatic rise in myogenic gene expression. Collectively, these results suggest that LSD2 regulates distinct sets of genes during brown and beige adipocyte formation.—Takase, R., Hino, S., Nagaoka, K., Anan, K., Kohrogi, K., Araki, H., Hino, Y., Sakamoto, A., Nicholson, T.

It could offer a methodology for answering questions related to texture measurements in PET imaging. The basic idea is to move a point source on a 3-D trajectory in the field of view, while continuously acquiring data. The reconstruction results in a 3-D activity concentration map according to the pathway of the point source. A 22Na calibration point source was attached to a high precision robotic arm system, where the 3-D movement was software controlled. 3-D activity distributions of a homogeneous cube, a sphere, a spherical shell and a heart shape were simulated. These distributions were used to measure uniformity and to characterize reproducibility. Two potential applications using the lesion simulation method are presented: evaluation in changes of textural properties related to the position in the PET field of view; scanner comparison based on visual and quantitative evaluation of texture features. A lesion with volume of 50x50x50 mm3 can be simulated during approximately 1 hour. The reproducibility of the movement was found to be >99%. The coefficients of variation of the voxels within a simulated homogeneous cube was 2.34%. Based on 5 consecutive and independent measurements of a 36 mm diameter hot sphere, the coefficient of variation of the mean activity concentration was 0.68%. We obtained up to 18% differences within the values of investigated textural indexes, when measuring a lesion in different radial positions of the PET field of view. In comparison of two different human PET scanners the percentage differences between heterogeneity parameters were in the range of 5-55%. After harmonizing the voxel sizes this range reduced to 2-16%. The general activity distributions provided by the two different vendor show high similarity visually. For the demonstration of the flexibility of this method, the same pattern was also simulated on a small animal PET scanner giving similar results, both quantitatively and visually. 3-D motion of a point source in the PET field of view is capable to create an irregular shaped activity distribution with high reproducibility."

Methods 104 PHIV and 100 BHIV young people aged 13–25 years completed a confidential tablet-based survey. Survey tools included the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) (anxiety sub-scale scores of 8–10 indicating mild and ≥11 moderate/severe symptoms in last 7 days), Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES) and HIV Stigma Scale (HSS) (short version, composite of disclosure, negative self-image and public attitudes sub-scales). Unadjusted Poisson regression models were fitted to explore factors associated with moderate/severe anxiety symptoms. Results PHIV and BHIV young people were of median age 15.5 [IQR 13.9–17.1] and 23.0 [21.0–24.3] years, having registered for HIV care a median 12.3 [10.3–14.4] and 0.9 [0.2–2.4] years previously; 97% (97/100) and 66% (65/99) respectively were on ART.

https://openalex.org/W2949932325,"Sepsis is a life threatening condition which produces multi-organ dysfunction with profound circulatory and cellular derangements. Administration of E.Coli endotoxin (LPS) produces systemic inflammatory effects of sepsis including disruption of endothelial barrier, and if severe enough death. Whole body periodic acceleration (pGz) is the headward-footward motion of the body. pGz has been shown to induce pulsatile shear stress to the endothelium, thereby releasing vascular and cardio protective mediators. The purpose of this study was to determine whether or not pGz performed as a pre-treatment or post-treatment strategy improves survival in a lethal murine endotoxin model.This study was designed as a prospective randomized controlled study in mice. pGz was performed in mice as pre-treatment (pGz-LPS, 3 days prior to LPS), post-treatment (LPS- pGz, 30 min after LPS) strategies or Control (LPS-CONT), in a lethal murine model of endotoxemia. Endotoxemia was induced with intraperitoneal injection of E.Coli LPS (40mg/kg). In a separate group of mice, a nonspecific nitric oxide synthase inhibitor (L-NAME) was provided in their drinking water and pGz-LPS and LPS-pGz performed to determine the effect of nitric oxide (NO) inhibition on survival. In another subset of mice, micro vascular leakage was determined. Behavioral scoring around the clock was performed in all mice at 30 min intervals after LPS administration, until 48 hrs. survival or death. LPS induced 100% mortality in LPS-CONT animals by 30 hrs. In contrast, survival to 48 hrs. occurred in 60% of pGz-LPS and 80% of LPS-pGz. L-NAME abolished the survival effects of pGz. Microvascular leakage was markedly reduced in both pre and post pGz treated animals and was associated with increased tyrosine kinase endothelial-enriched tunica interna endothelial cell kinase 2 (TIE2) receptor and its phosphorylation (p-TIE2). In a murine model of lethal endotoxemia, pGz performed as a pre or post treatment strategy significantly improved survival, and markedly reduced microvascular leakage. The effect was modulated, in part, by NO since a non-selective inhibitor of NO abolished the pGz survival effect."

This study aimed to understand the relationship between species richness and range-size distribution in relation to environmental factors. The present study tested the following: (1) altitudinal Rapoport’s rule, and a subsequent test on climatic and ambient energy hypotheses, (2) non-directional rescue effect, and a subsequent test on effect of environmental factors associated with the distribution of narrowest to widest-range species. Altitudinal species range-size distribution increased with increasing altitude and showed a negative relationship with climatic variables. These results support the altitudinal Rapoport’s rule and climatic hypothesis; however, they do not fully support the ambient energy hypothesis. Results from testing the non-directional rescue effect showed that the inflow intensity of species from both directions (high and low elevations) affected species richness. And we found that the species with intermediate range-size, rather than narrowest or widest range-size were the main cause of a mid-peak of species richness and the non-directional rescue effect. Additionally, the richness of species with intermediate range-size was highly related to minimum temperature, habitat heterogeneity, or primary productivity. Although altitudinal range-size distribution results were similar to the phenomenon of altitudinal Rapoport’s rule, the mid-peak pattern of species richness could not be explained by the underlying mechanism of Rapoport’s-rescue effect; however, the non-directional rescue effect could explain a mid-peak pattern of species richness along altitudinal gradient."
https://openalex.org/W2950682550,"It is often assumed that word reading proceeds automatically. Here, we tested this assumption by recording event-related potentials during a psychological refractory period (PRP) paradigm, requiring lexical decisions about written words. Specifically, we selected words differing in their orthographic neighborhood size-the number of words that can be obtained from a target by exchanging a single letter-and investigated how influences of this variable depend on the availability of central attention. As expected, when attentional resources for lexical decisions were unconstrained, words with many orthographic neighbors elicited larger N400 amplitudes than those with few neighbors. However, under conditions of high temporal overlap with a high priority primary task, the N400 effect was not statistically different from zero. This finding indicates strong attentional influences on processes sensitive to orthographic neighbors during word reading, providing novel evidence against the full automaticity of processes involved in word reading. Furthermore, in conjunction with the observation of an underadditive interaction between stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) and orthographic neighborhood size in lexical decision performance, commonly taken to indicate automaticity, our results raise issues concerning the standard logic of cognitive slack in the PRP paradigm."
https://openalex.org/W2912803457,"It was just like any other morning. I was at the bus stop, on my way to the lab where I was a postdoctoral fellow. But as I watched the people around me—headphones dangling from their ears, eyes cast down, unsmiling faces—something began to stir inside me. They looked unhappy. And, I realized, I was one of them. Suddenly, I could no longer continue with my work life. I turned around, went back to my flat, and booked a one-way ticket to fly home the next morning. I didn't know how long I would be away or what would come next. All I knew was that, even though I loved science and research, what I had been doing wasn't working.

Over the years, as I dealt with the pressures of finishing my Ph.D. and securing and starting my postdoc, I had grown more competitive. To prove that I was a valuable researcher, I pushed myself to be the first to generate sensational results and to publish in high-impact journals. Those who could have been collaborators became rivals I resented.

But the effect of this competitive streak was exactly the opposite of what I had hoped for. The pressure became overwhelming. When I encountered scientific problems, I thought I had to solve them myself instead of asking for help. I began to feel alone and lost. I became less and less productive. But the culture of academia—prizing competition and individual successes above all else—seemed to reinforce my approach. I was sure that this was not the right time to show any insecurities, so I persevered.

That day at the bus stop, I hit my breaking point. The race had to end.

I emailed my mentors, explaining that I had put myself second and the job first for too long. They came to meet with me that evening. They told me that I wasn't the first academic to feel that way, and that I wouldn't be the last. They agreed that I should take the time I needed to take care of myself. I had managed to put aside a small amount of savings, which could cover my expenses for a few months. So, with my mentors' support and an uncertain future, I left.

Back home, I spent time with family and friends and opened up about my struggles. At first, I was ashamed. But the more I talked about my demons, the more other people—including many friends who were early-career researchers—told me about their own. I also started to receive emails from my workmates. After a few lines asking how I was, many expressed worries about how they were managing the stress of academic life. Vulnerable researchers were poking their heads out of their shells. Our relationships deepened. I began to feel less alone. I had acknowledged that I was susceptible to the ups and downs of academic life—just like everyone else.

Three months after I left so suddenly, I was prepared to go back to work. I was excited to get back to the science that I loved, and I now had a foundation to be more open with my colleagues. I understood that we all struggle sometimes, and that vulnerability and collaboration can be more powerful than competition. It doesn't have to be a zero-sum game.

The first days were difficult. I had naively thought that, right away, everything would be different. But as soon as I was back in that workplace, I felt the stirrings of that old competitiveness. I focused on maintaining my new perspective and being patient as I readjusted. With a bit of time, I understood that, although the place and position were the same, I had changed. I hadn't just accepted my vulnerability; I had embraced it and opened up about it to my colleagues.

As a result, collaboration has replaced competition. Working with others and seeking help doesn't diminish my value or contributions; it means we can all win. Now, when I encounter problems in my work, I frequently discuss them with colleagues, knowing that considering multiple points of view often leads to solutions. I have become more productive. Working relationships are now genuine human ones. I no longer feel like one of the lonely, unhappy people at the bus stop.

https://openalex.org/W2915056849,"Riccardo Giacconi, one of the most charismatic and influential figures of astrophysics in the modern era, died on 9 December 2018. He was 87. Giacconi was a co-recipient of the 2002 Nobel Prize in Physics for “pioneering contributions to astrophysics, which have led to the discovery of cosmic x-ray sources.” His contributions to astronomy, however, span the entire electromagnetic spectrum, as he directed the development and operation of major space- and ground-based facilities, which have greatly expanded our scientific boundaries over the past 50 years.

Born in Genoa, Giacconi obtained his Ph.D. in physics from the University of Milan in 1954. He moved to the United States in 1956 and soon began work at American Science and Engineering (AS&E), a space startup company in Cambridge, Massachusetts. At the suggestion of physicist Bruno Rossi at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Giacconi started to develop an x-ray astronomy program. He directed a historic rocket flight in 1962, which led to the discovery of the first cosmic x-ray source, Scorpius X-1, and a diffuse isotropic x-ray background. Understanding the nature of this diffuse emission was one of Giacconi's lifelong scientific objectives. In 1970, his AS&E group built and launched the first x-ray satellite, Uhuru, which surveyed the entire sky and found hundreds of x-ray sources and the first evidence of black holes in pulsating x-ray binaries.

At the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Giacconi pushed x-ray astronomy to new heights by leading a group that developed and launched the first imaging x-ray telescope, the Einstein Observatory, in 1978. The Einstein Observatory carried focusing x-ray optics, realizing a concept of x-ray grazing incidence mirrors that Giacconi had developed in 1960 to vastly increase the sensitivity and angular resolution of detecting systems. The Einstein Observatory revealed myriad sources in the x-ray sky, including young stars, compact objects, active galaxies, and clusters of galaxies. X-ray observations have since become an essential tool for exploring the formation and evolution of the Universe.

By building the Einstein Observatory, Giacconi's group developed a new end-to-end model of operations. Observations could be painstakingly planned and scheduled. The data were pre-reduced and calibrated, then stored in a science archive that was publicly accessible worldwide. A seamless integration between all scientific and engineering aspects of the mission was also key to the design and construction of the observatory.

Giacconi forcefully pushed and expanded this model (“science system engineering”) and management strategy as he directed two more major observatories: The Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) in Baltimore, Maryland, from 1981 to 1993, and the European Southern Observatory (ESO) until 1999, during the construction of the Very Large Telescope (VLT) in Chile. He argued that this operational model was the best and most cost-effective way to empower the entire community, not just elite expert observers, with the flexible, powerful tools and archival data needed to explore the Universe.

Before leaving Cambridge for Baltimore, Giacconi and his lifelong collaborator, Harvey Tananbaum, set in motion the successor to the Einstein Observatory, NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory, which launched in 1999. The Chandra observatory's ability to produce sub-arcsecond images is still unique. Giacconi always thought that angular resolution of an x-ray telescope was the key to a wide range of scientific goals, particularly resolving the x-ray background in a large number of individual sources and distinguishing the extended halos associated with distant galaxy clusters.

I first met Giacconi in 1991. Then the first permanent director of STScI and a professor at Johns Hopkins University, he was looking for a Ph.D. student to find galaxy clusters in the new data from the German satellite ROSAT. Aided by Giacconi's methodological guidance and the supervision of astrophysicist Colin Norman, I discovered a new population of distant clusters. Our interactions intensified as we planned the Chandra Deep Field Survey, a very long x-ray exposure in a region of the sky that Giacconi had dreamed about for years. “We'll create glamour in this field,” he told me in 1998. As he envisioned, this has now become one of the most studied and data-rich fields in the sky, which has fueled hundreds of refereed publications.

Giacconi hired independent thinkers who could challenge him and complement his knowledge. It was not unusual for discussions to become heated; he believed that “a brutal intellectual confrontation” was essential to move things forward, with a mutual trust and a shared ownership of the project. In all these activities, whether running big observatories or solving scientific problems, methodology played a central role.

He encouraged his young collaborators to approach scientific problems without prejudices or prestructured expectations. He advised us to “listen to nature” and distrust those “who think they know more than nature.” His approach to scientific activities was always characterized by uncompromising intellectual integrity. In his autobiography Secrets of the Hoary Deep: A Personal History of Modern Astronomy , he reflected on the role that scientists should have in society by “spreading the light of reason” to counteract alarming irrational currents in the world.

In 1999, Giacconi moved back to the United States to become president of the Associated Universities, where he helped build the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA). He returned to Johns Hopkins in 2004, where he continued work on his self-proclaimed best idea: an x-ray telescope with an optical design optimized for wide and deep surveys. To his disappointment, it was never funded.

In 2014, after more than 60 years of setting astronomical observatories in motion, Giacconi decided that it was “time to rest.” He moved to La Jolla, California, to spend time with his wife, Mirella, for whom he always had words of admiration, and his beloved family. The astronomical community will miss his vision, indomitable spirit, and creativity when embarking on the next big project. His close collaborators will also sorely miss his unwavering friendship.
