(2) Two hundred and ten female mice castrated at 28-35 days behave much the same as non-breeding females. (3) Two hundred and forty-one males castrated at 28-35 days did not develop tumor, thus resembling non-castrated males. (4) Spontaneous tumors, never obtained in thousands of normal males of the stock used, may develop in castrated males which have received subcutaneous transplants of ovarian tissue (210 operated-four tumors)."

It is therefore with pleasure that I report on some impressions and experiences of a recent visit in central and southern Europe. The following brief account does not attempt to describe all important activities in the countries mentioned, nor does it list all of the leading workers in any one place. The visits which my wife and I made were unofficial, and the choice of itinerary was dictated by practical and personal considerations. Moreover, the comments which follow pertain more to the conditions under which scientific work is being prosecuted than to the researches themselves."
