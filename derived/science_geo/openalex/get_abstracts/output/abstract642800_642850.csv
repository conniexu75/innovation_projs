https://openalex.org/W2984784701,"There is growing interest in voxelated matter that is designed and fabricated voxel by voxel1-4. Currently, inkjet-based three-dimensional (3D) printing is the only widely adopted method that is capable of creating 3D voxelated materials with high precision1-4, but the physics of droplet formation requires the use of low-viscosity inks to ensure successful printing5. By contrast, direct ink writing, an extrusion-based 3D printing method, is capable of patterning a much broader range of materials6-13. However, it is difficult to generate multimaterial voxelated matter by extruding monolithic cylindrical filaments in a layer-by-layer manner. Here we report the design and fabrication of voxelated soft matter using multimaterial multinozzle 3D (MM3D) printing, in which the composition, function and structure of the materials are programmed at the voxel scale. Our MM3D printheads exploit the diode-like behaviour that arises when multiple viscoelastic materials converge at a junction to enable seamless, high-frequency switching between up to eight different materials to create voxels with a volume approaching that of the nozzle diameter cubed. As exemplars, we fabricate a Miura origami pattern14 and a millipede-like soft robot that locomotes by co-printing multiple epoxy and silicone elastomer inks of stiffness varying by several orders of magnitude. Our method substantially broadens the palette of voxelated materials that can be designed and manufactured in complex motifs."
https://openalex.org/W2988550413,"Chronic liver disease due to alcohol-use disorder contributes markedly to the global burden of disease and mortality1-3. Alcoholic hepatitis is a severe and life-threatening form of alcohol-associated liver disease. The gut microbiota promotes ethanol-induced liver disease in mice4, but little is known about the microbial factors that are responsible for this process. Here we identify cytolysin-a two-subunit exotoxin that is secreted by Enterococcus faecalis5,6-as a cause of hepatocyte death and liver injury. Compared with non-alcoholic individuals or patients with alcohol-use disorder, patients with alcoholic hepatitis have increased faecal numbers of E. faecalis. The presence of cytolysin-positive (cytolytic) E. faecalis correlated with the severity of liver disease and with mortality in patients with alcoholic hepatitis. Using humanized mice that were colonized with bacteria from the faeces of patients with alcoholic hepatitis, we investigated the therapeutic effects of bacteriophages that target cytolytic E. faecalis. We found that these bacteriophages decrease cytolysin in the liver and abolish ethanol-induced liver disease in humanized mice. Our findings link cytolytic E. faecalis with more severe clinical outcomes and increased mortality in patients with alcoholic hepatitis. We show that bacteriophages can specifically target cytolytic E. faecalis, which provides a method for precisely editing the intestinal microbiota. A clinical trial with a larger cohort is required to validate the relevance of our findings in humans, and to test whether this therapeutic approach is effective for patients with alcoholic hepatitis."

https://openalex.org/W2985791623,"Science-fiction movies portray volumetric systems that provide not only visual but also tactile and audible three-dimensional (3D) content. Displays based on swept-volume surfaces1,2, holography3, optophoretics4, plasmonics5 or lenticular lenslets6 can create 3D visual content without the need for glasses or additional instrumentation. However, they are slow, have limited persistence-of-vision capabilities and, most importantly, rely on operating principles that cannot produce tactile and auditive content as well. Here we present the multimodal acoustic trap display (MATD): a levitating volumetric display that can simultaneously deliver visual, auditory and tactile content, using acoustophoresis as the single operating principle. Our system traps a particle acoustically and illuminates it with red, green and blue light to control its colour as it quickly scans the display volume. Using time multiplexing with a secondary trap, amplitude modulation and phase minimization, the MATD delivers simultaneous auditive and tactile content. The system demonstrates particle speeds of up to 8.75 metres per second and 3.75 metres per second in the vertical and horizontal directions, respectively, offering particle manipulation capabilities superior to those of other optical or acoustic approaches demonstrated until now. In addition, our technique offers opportunities for non-contact, high-speed manipulation of matter, with applications in computational fabrication7 and biomedicine8."
https://openalex.org/W2985687430,"In rapidly adapting asexual populations, including many microbial pathogens and viruses, numerous mutant lineages often compete for dominance within the population1-5. These complex evolutionary dynamics determine the outcomes of adaptation, but have been difficult to observe directly. Previous studies have used whole-genome sequencing to follow molecular adaptation6-10; however, these methods have limited resolution in microbial populations. Here we introduce a renewable barcoding system to observe evolutionary dynamics at high resolution in laboratory budding yeast. We find nested patterns of interference and hitchhiking even at low frequencies. These events are driven by the continuous appearance of new mutations that modify the fates of existing lineages before they reach substantial frequencies. We observe how the distribution of fitness within the population changes over time, and find a travelling wave of adaptation that has been predicted by theory11-17. We show that clonal competition creates a dynamical 'rich-get-richer' effect: fitness advantages that are acquired early in evolution drive clonal expansions, which increase the chances of acquiring future mutations. However, less-fit lineages also routinely leapfrog over strains of higher fitness. Our results demonstrate that this combination of factors, which is not accounted for in existing models of evolutionary dynamics, is critical in determining the rate, predictability and molecular basis of adaptation."
https://openalex.org/W2985810153,"The cytochrome b6 f (cytb6 f ) complex has a central role in oxygenic photosynthesis, linking electron transfer between photosystems I and II and converting solar energy into a transmembrane proton gradient for ATP synthesis1-3. Electron transfer within cytb6 f occurs via the quinol (Q) cycle, which catalyses the oxidation of plastoquinol (PQH2) and the reduction of both plastocyanin (PC) and plastoquinone (PQ) at two separate sites via electron bifurcation2. In higher plants, cytb6 f also acts as a redox-sensing hub, pivotal to the regulation of light harvesting and cyclic electron transfer that protect against metabolic and environmental stresses3. Here we present a 3.6 A resolution cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the dimeric cytb6 f complex from spinach, which reveals the structural basis for operation of the Q cycle and its redox-sensing function. The complex contains up to three natively bound PQ molecules. The first, PQ1, is located in one cytb6 f monomer near the PQ oxidation site (Qp) adjacent to haem bp and chlorophyll a. Two conformations of the chlorophyll a phytyl tail were resolved, one that prevents access to the Qp site and another that permits it, supporting a gating function for the chlorophyll a involved in redox sensing. PQ2 straddles the intermonomer cavity, partially obstructing the PQ reduction site (Qn) on the PQ1 side and committing the electron transfer network to turnover at the occupied Qn site in the neighbouring monomer. A conformational switch involving the haem cn propionate promotes two-electron, two-proton reduction at the Qn site and avoids formation of the reactive intermediate semiquinone. The location of a tentatively assigned third PQ molecule is consistent with a transition between the Qp and Qn sites in opposite monomers during the Q cycle. The spinach cytb6 f structure therefore provides new insights into how the complex fulfils its catalytic and regulatory roles in photosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2988642342,"Climate change is causing widespread glacier retreat1, and much attention is devoted to negative impacts such as diminishing water resources2, shifts in runoff seasonality3, and increases in cryosphere-related hazards4. Here we focus on a different aspect, and explore the water-storage and hydropower potential of areas that are expected to become ice-free during the course of this century. For roughly 185,000 sites that are glacierized at present, we predict the potentially emerging reservoir storage volume and hydropower potential. Using a climate-driven glacier-evolution model5 and topographical analysis6, we estimate a theoretical maximal total storage and hydropower potential of 875 ± 260 cubic kilometres and 1,355 ± 515 terawatt-hours per year, respectively (95% confidence intervals). A first-order suitability assessment that takes into account environmental, technical and economic factors identifies roughly 40 per cent of this potential (355 ± 105 cubic kilometres and 533 ± 200 terawatt-hours per year) as possibly being suitable for realization. Three quarters of the potential storage volume is expected to become ice-free by 2050, and the storage volume would be enough to retain about half of the annual runoff leaving the investigated sites. Although local impacts would need to be assessed on a case-by-case basis, the results indicate that deglacierizing basins could make important contributions to national energy supplies in several countries, particularly in High Mountain Asia. Glacierized regions that are projected to become ice-free in this century could provide substantial water storage and hydroelectric power, according to this worldwide theoretical assessment."
https://openalex.org/W2988396051,"Gigantopithecus blacki was a giant hominid that inhabited densely forested environments of Southeast Asia during the Pleistocene epoch1. Its evolutionary relationships to other great ape species, and the divergence of these species during the Middle and Late Miocene epoch (16-5.3 million years ago), remain unclear2,3. Hypotheses regarding the relationships between Gigantopithecus and extinct and extant hominids are wide ranging but difficult to substantiate because of its highly derived dentognathic morphology, the absence of cranial and post-cranial remains1,3-6, and the lack of independent molecular validation. We retrieved dental enamel proteome sequences from a 1.9-million-year-old G. blacki molar found in Chuifeng Cave, China7,8. The thermal age of these protein sequences is approximately five times greater than that of any previously published mammalian proteome or genome. We demonstrate that Gigantopithecus is a sister clade to orangutans (genus Pongo) with a common ancestor about 12-10 million years ago, implying that the divergence of Gigantopithecus from Pongo forms part of the Miocene radiation of great apes. In addition, we hypothesize that the expression of alpha-2-HS-glycoprotein, which has not been previously observed in enamel proteomes, had a role in the biomineralization of the thick enamel crowns that characterize the large molars in Gigantopithecus9,10. The survival of an Early Pleistocene dental enamel proteome in the subtropics further expands the scope of palaeoproteomic analysis into geographical areas and time periods previously considered incompatible with the preservation of substantial amounts of genetic information."
https://openalex.org/W2983874376,"African swine fever (ASF) is a swine disease caused by a large, structurally complex, double-stranded DNA virus, African swine fever virus (ASFV). In domestic pigs, acute infection by highly virulent ASF viruses causes hemorrhagic fever and death. Previous work has suggested that ASFV pathogenesis is primarily mediated by host cytokines produced by infected monocytes and macrophages. To better understand molecular mechanisms mediating virus pathogenesis and immune evasion, we used transcriptome analysis to identify gene expression changes after ASFV infection in ex vivo swine macrophages. Our results suggest that the cytokines of TNF family including FASLG, LTA, LTB, TNF, TNFSF4, TNFSF10, TNFSF13B and TNFSF18 are the major causative cytokine factors in ASF pathogenesis via inducing apoptosis. Other up-regulated proinflammatory cytokines (IL17F and interferons) and down-regulated anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL10) may also significantly contribute to ASF pathogenesis and cause excessive tissue inflammatory responses. The differential expression of genes also indicates that ASFV could evade both the innate and adaptive immune responses by (i) inhibiting MHC Class II antigen processing and presentation, (ii) avoiding CD8+ T effector cells and neutrophil extracellular traps via decreasing expression of neutrophil/CD8+ T effector cell-recruiting chemokines, (iii) suppressing M1 activation of macrophages, (iv) inducing immune suppressive cytokines, and (v) inhibiting the processes of macrophage autophagy and apoptosis. These results provide novel information to further investigate and better understand the mechanism of pathogenesis and immune evasion of this devastating swine disease."

https://openalex.org/W2988232733,"The protection of telomere ends by the shelterin complex prevents DNA damage signalling and promiscuous repair at chromosome ends. Evidence suggests that the 3' single-stranded telomere end can assemble into a lasso-like t-loop configuration1,2, which has been proposed to safeguard chromosome ends from being recognized as DNA double-strand breaks2. Mechanisms must also exist to transiently disassemble t-loops to allow accurate telomere replication and to permit telomerase access to the 3' end to solve the end-replication problem. However, the regulation and physiological importance of t-loops in the protection of telomere ends remains unknown. Here we identify a CDK phosphorylation site in the shelterin subunit at Ser365 of TRF2, whose dephosphorylation in S phase by the PP6R3 phosphatase provides a narrow window during which the RTEL1 helicase can transiently access and unwind t-loops to facilitate telomere replication. Re-phosphorylation of TRF2 at Ser365 outside of S phase is required to release RTEL1 from telomeres, which not only protects t-loops from promiscuous unwinding and inappropriate activation of ATM, but also counteracts replication conflicts at DNA secondary structures that arise within telomeres and across the genome. Hence, a phospho-switch in TRF2 coordinates the assembly and disassembly of t-loops during the cell cycle, which protects telomeres from replication stress and an unscheduled DNA damage response."
https://openalex.org/W3101779923,"Astrophysical observations indicate that there is roughly five times more dark matter in the Universe than ordinary baryonic matter1, and an even larger amount of the Universe's energy content is attributed to dark energy2. However, the microscopic properties of these dark components remain unknown. Moreover, even ordinary matter-which accounts for five per cent of the energy density of the Universe-has yet to be understood, given that the standard model of particle physics lacks any consistent explanation for the predominance of matter over antimatter3. Here we present a direct search for interactions of antimatter with dark matter and place direct constraints on the interaction of ultralight axion-like particles (dark-matter candidates) with antiprotons. If antiprotons have a stronger coupling to these particles than protons do, such a matter-antimatter asymmetric coupling could provide a link between dark matter and the baryon asymmetry in the Universe. We analyse spin-flip resonance data in the frequency domain acquired with a single antiproton in a Penning trap4 to search for spin-precession effects from ultralight axions, which have a characteristic frequency governed by the mass of the underlying particle. Our analysis constrains the axion-antiproton interaction parameter to values greater than 0.1 to 0.6 gigaelectronvolts in the mass range from 2 × 10-23 to 4 × 10-17 electronvolts, improving the sensitivity by up to five orders of magnitude compared with astrophysical antiproton bounds. In addition, we derive limits on six combinations of previously unconstrained Lorentz- and CPT-violating terms of the non-minimal standard model extension5."
https://openalex.org/W2986968588,"Secondary active transporters, which are vital for a multitude of physiological processes, use the energy of electrochemical ion gradients to power substrate transport across cell membranes1,2. Efforts to investigate their mechanisms of action have been hampered by their slow transport rates and the inherent limitations of ensemble methods. Here we quantify the activity of individual MhsT transporters, which are representative of the neurotransmitter:sodium symporter family of secondary transporters3, by imaging the transport of individual substrate molecules across lipid bilayers at both single- and multi-turnover resolution. We show that MhsT is active only when physiologically oriented and that the rate-limiting step of the transport cycle varies with the nature of the transported substrate. These findings are consistent with an extracellular allosteric substrate-binding site that modulates the rate-limiting aspects of the transport mechanism4,5, including the rate at which the transporter returns to an outward-facing state after the transported substrate is released."
https://openalex.org/W2984666594,"Tumor cells must alter their antioxidant capacity for maximal metastatic potential. Yet the antioxidant adaptations required for ovarian cancer transcoelomic metastasis, which is the passive dissemination of cells in the peritoneal cavity, remain largely unexplored. Somewhat contradicting the need for oxidant scavenging are previous observations that expression of SIRT3, a nutrient stress sensor and regulator of mitochondrial antioxidant defenses, is often suppressed in many primary tumors. We have discovered that this mitochondrial deacetylase is specifically upregulated in a context-dependent manner in cancer cells. SIRT3 activity and expression transiently increased following ovarian cancer cell detachment and in tumor cells derived from malignant ascites of high-grade serous adenocarcinoma patients. Mechanistically, SIRT3 prevents mitochondrial superoxide surges in detached cells by regulating the manganese superoxide dismutase (SOD2). This mitochondrial stress response is under dual regulation by SIRT3. SIRT3 rapidly increases SOD2 activity as an early adaptation to cellular detachment, which is followed by SIRT3-dependent increases in SOD2 mRNA during sustained anchorage-independence. In addition, SIRT3 inhibits glycolytic capacity in anchorage-independent cells thereby contributing to metabolic changes in response to detachment. While manipulation of SIRT3 expression has few deleterious effects on cancer cells in attached conditions, SIRT3 upregulation and SIRT3-mediated oxidant scavenging are required for anoikis resistance in vitro following matrix detachment, and both SIRT3 and SOD2 are necessary for colonization of the peritoneal cavity in vivo. Our results highlight the novel context-specific, pro-metastatic role of SIRT3 in ovarian cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2985744267,"This paper proposes and tests a multilayer framework for simulating the network dynamics of inter-organizational coordination among interdependent infrastructure systems (IISs) in resilience planning. Inter-organizational coordination among IISs (such as transportation, flood control, and emergency management) would greatly affect the effectiveness of resilience planning. Hence, it is important to examine and understand the dynamics of coordination in networks of organizations within and across various systems in resilience planning. To capture the dynamic nature of coordination frequency and the heterogeneity of organizations, this paper proposes a multilayer network simulation framework enabling the characterization of inter-organizational coordination dynamics within and across IISs. In the proposed framework, coordination probabilities are utilized to approximate the varying levels of collaboration among organizations. Based on these derived collaborations, the simulation process perturbs intra-layer or inter-layer links and unveils the level of inter-organizational coordination within and across IISs. To test the proposed framework, the study examined a multilayer collaboration network of 35 organizations from five infrastructure systems within Harris County, Texas, based on the data gathered from a survey in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey. The results indicate that prior to Hurricane Harvey: (1) coordination among organizations across different infrastructure systems is less than the coordination within the individual systems; (2) organizations from the community development system had a low level of coordination for hazard mitigation with organizations in flood control and transportation systems; (3) achieving a greater level of coordination among organizations across infrastructure systems is more difficult and would require a greater frequency of interaction (compared to within-system coordination). The results show the capability of the proposed multilayer network simulation framework to examine inter-organizational coordination dynamics at the system level (e.g., within and across IISs). The assessment of inter-organizational coordination within and across IISs sheds light on important organizational interdependencies in IISs and leads to recommendations for improving the resilience planning process."
https://openalex.org/W2984037525,"The key objective of this research was to generate new evidence on outpatient antibiotic prescription rate and patterns in the private sector in India. We used 12-month period (May 2013 to April 2014) medical audit dataset from IQVIA (formerly IMS Health). We coded the diagnosis provided in the medical audit data to International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10) and the prescribed antibiotics for the diagnosis to Anatomic Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification of World Health Organization (ATC index-2016). We calculated and reported antibiotic prescription rate per 1,000 persons per year, by age groups, antibiotic class and disease conditions. Our main findings are—approximately 519 million antibiotic prescriptions were dispensed in the private sector, which translates into 412 prescriptions per 1,000 persons per year. Majority of the antibiotic prescriptions were dispensed for acute upper respiratory infections (J06) (20.4%); unspecified acute lower respiratory infection (J22) (12.8%); disorders of urinary system (N39) (6.0%); cough (R05) (4.7%); and acute nasopharyngitis (J00) (4.6%) and highest antibiotic prescription rates were observed in the age group 0–4 years. To conclude our study reports first ever country level estimates of antibiotic prescription by antibiotic classes, age groups, and ICD-10 mapped disease conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2984975897,"Tumor cells rely on glycolysis to meet their elevated demand for energy. Thereby they produce significant amounts of lactate and protons, which are exported via monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs), supporting the formation of an acidic microenvironment. The present study demonstrates that carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX), one of the major acid/base regulators in cancer cells, forms a protein complex with MCT1 and MCT4 in tissue samples from human breast cancer patients, but not healthy breast tissue. Formation of this transport metabolon requires binding of CAIX to the Ig1 domain of the MCT1/4 chaperon CD147 and is required for CAIX-mediated facilitation of MCT1/4 activity. Application of an antibody, directed against the CD147-Ig1 domain, displaces CAIX from the transporter and suppresses CAIX-mediated facilitation of proton-coupled lactate transport. In cancer cells, this “metabolon disruption” results in a decrease in lactate transport, reduced glycolysis, and ultimately reduced cell proliferation. Taken together, the study shows that carbonic anhydrases form transport metabolons with acid/base transporters in human tumor tissue and that these interactions can be exploited to interfere with tumor metabolism and proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W2986549997,"With the increase in the amount of text information in different real-life applications, automatic text-summarization systems become more predominant in extracting relevant information. In the current study, we formulated the problem of extractive text-summarization as a binary optimization problem, and multi-objective binary differential evolution (DE) based optimization strategy is employed to solve this. The solutions of DE encode a possible subset of sentences to be present in the summary which is then evaluated based on some statistical features (objective functions) namely, the position of the sentence in the document, the similarity of a sentence with the title, length of the sentence, cohesion, readability, and coverage. These objective functions, measuring different aspects of summary, are optimized simultaneously using the search capability of DE. Some newly designed self-organizing map (SOM) based genetic operators are incorporated in the optimization process to improve the convergence. SOM generates a mating pool containing solutions and their neighborhoods. This mating pool takes part in the genetic operation (crossover and mutation) to create new solutions. To measure the similarity or dissimilarity between sentences, different existing measures like normalized Google distance, word mover distance, and cosine similarity are explored. For the purpose of evaluation, two standard summarization datasets namely, DUC2001, and DUC2002 are utilized, and the obtained results are compared with various supervised, unsupervised and optimization strategy based existing summarization techniques using ROUGE measures. Results illustrate the superiority of our approach in terms of convergence rate and ROUGE scores as compared to state-of-the-art methods. We have obtained 45% and 5% improvements over two recent state-of-the-art methods considering ROUGE−2 and ROUGE−1 scores, respectively, for the DUC2001 dataset. While for the DUC2002 dataset, improvements obtained by our approach are 20% and 5%, considering ROUGE−2 and ROUGE−1 scores, respectively. In addition to these standard datasets, CNN news dataset is also utilized to evaluate the efficacy of our proposed approach. It was also shown that the best performance not only depends on the objective functions used but also on the correct choice of similarity/dissimilarity measure between sentences."
https://openalex.org/W2980019553,"Transposons have had a pivotal role in genome evolution1 and are believed to be the evolutionary progenitors of the RAG1-RAG2 recombinase2, an essential component of the adaptive immune system in jawed vertebrates3. Here we report one crystal structure and five cryo-electron microscopy structures of Transib4,5, a RAG1-like transposase from Helicoverpa zea, that capture the entire transposition process from the apo enzyme to the terminal strand transfer complex with transposon ends covalently joined to target DNA, at resolutions of 3.0-4.6 Å. These structures reveal a butterfly-shaped complex that undergoes two cycles of marked conformational changes in which the 'wings' of the transposase unfurl to bind substrate DNA, close to execute cleavage, open to release the flanking DNA and close again to capture and attack target DNA. Transib possesses unique structural elements that compensate for the absence of a RAG2 partner, including a loop that interacts with the transposition target site and an accordion-like C-terminal tail that elongates and contracts to help to control the opening and closing of the enzyme and assembly of the active site. Our findings reveal the detailed reaction pathway of a eukaryotic cut-and-paste transposase and illuminate some of the earliest steps in the evolution of the RAG recombinase."
https://openalex.org/W2984913756,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most frequently occurring and gravest primary tumor of the CNS in adults. The development of chemoresistance to temozolomide (TMZ), the first-line chemotherapy for GBM, is an important factor contributing to poor treatment outcomes. Down-regulation of O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) expression in GBM cells is an attractive strategy for overcoming TMZ resistance and improving outcomes. This study revealed that the nitric oxide (NO) donor S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP) exerts antitumorigenic effects on TMZ-sensitive and TMZ-resistant (TMZ-R) glioma cells. Pretreatment with SNAP not only induced apoptosis, mitochondrial dysfunction, and hypoxia-inducing factor 1, but also resensitized TMZ-R GBM cells to TMZ through down-regulation of MGMT expression. SNAP acted principally through post-translational modification of p53, phosphorylated N-myc downstream regulated gene 1, and MGMT protein stability in TMZ-R GBM cells. Additionally, when applied together, SNAP and TMZ enhanced the inhibition of tumor growth in vitro and in vivo. This study sheds new light on a potential strategy to overcome TMZ resistance in GBM and thus possesses the potential for prolonging survival of patients with GBM.-Tsai, C.-K., Huang, L.-C., Wu, Y.-P., Kan, I.-Y., Hueng, D.-Y.

https://openalex.org/W2983342917,"The social sciences are going through what has been described as a 'reproducibility crisis'1,2. Highly influential findings derived from accessible populations, such as laboratories and crowd-sourced worker platforms, are not always replicated. Less attention has been given to replicating findings that are derived from inaccessible populations, and recent high-profile replication attempts explicitly excluded such populations3. Pioneering experimental work4 offered a rare glimpse into banker culture and found that bankers, in contrast to other professionals, are more dishonest when they think about their job. Given the importance of the banking sector, and before academics or policy-makers rely on these findings as an accurate diagnosis of banking culture, an exploration of their generalizability is warranted. Here we conduct the same incentivized task with bankers and non-bankers from five different populations across three continents (n = 1,282 participants). In our banker studies in the Middle East and Asia Pacific (n = 148 and n = 620, respectively), we observe some dishonesty, although-in contrast to the original study4-this was not significantly increased among bankers primed to think about their work compared to bankers who were not primed. We also find that inducing non-banking professionals to think about their job does not have a significant effect on honesty. We explore sampling and methodological differences to explain the variation in findings in relation to bankers and identify two key points. First, the expectations of the general population regarding banker behaviour vary across jurisdictions, suggesting that banking culture in the jurisdiction of the original study4 may not be consistent worldwide. Second, having approached 27 financial institutions, many of which expressed concerns of adverse findings, we expect that only banks with a sound culture participated in our study. The latter introduces possible selection bias that may undermine the generalizability of any similar field study. More broadly, our study highlights the complexity of undertaking a high-fidelity replication of sensitive, highly publicized fieldwork with largely inaccessible populations resulting from institutional and geographical barriers. For policy-makers, this work suggests that caution should be exercised in generalizing the findings of the original study4 to other populations."
https://openalex.org/W2987531259,"The inhibitory co-receptor programmed cell death 1 (PD-1, Pdcd1) plays critical roles in the regulation of autoimmunity, anticancer immunity, and immunity against infections. Immunotherapies targeting PD-1 have revolutionized cancer management and instigated various trials of improved cancer immunotherapies. Moreover, extensive trials are underway to potentiate PD-1 function to suppress harmful immune responses. Here we found that both natural and synthetic glucocorticoids (GCs) up-regulate PD-1 on T cells without altering the expression levels of other co-receptors and cell surface molecules. GC-induced up-regulation of PD-1 depended on transactivation of PD-1 transcription mediated through the glucocorticoid receptor. We further found that a GC response element 2525 bp upstream of the transcription start site of Pdcd1 is responsible for GC-mediated transactivation. We also observed that in vivo administration of GCs significantly up-regulates PD-1 expression on tumor-infiltrating T cells. By analyzing T cells differing in PD-1 expression, we directly demonstrated that the amount of PD-1 on the cell surface correlates with its inhibitory effect. Accordingly, GCs potentiated the capacity of PD-1 to inhibit T cell activation, suggesting that this PD-1-mediated inhibition contributes, at least in part, to the anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects of GCs. In light of the critical roles of PD-1 in the regulation of autoimmunity, we expect that the potentiation of PD-1 activity may offer a promising therapeutic strategy for managing inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.

https://openalex.org/W2985996621,"The experience of aesthetic chills, often defined as a subjective response accompanied by goosebumps, shivers and tingling sensations, is a phenomenon often utilized to indicate moments of peak pleasure and emotional arousal in psychological research. However, little is currently understood about how to conceptualize the experience, particularly in terms of whether chills are general markers of intense pleasure and emotion, or instead a collection of distinct phenomenological experiences. To address this, a web-study was designed using images, videos, music videos, texts and music excerpts (from both an online forum dedicated to chills-eliciting stimuli and previous musical chills study), to explore variations across chills experience in terms of bodily and emotional responses reported. Results suggest that across participants (N = 179), three distinct chills categories could be identified: warm chills (chills co-occurring with smiling, warmth, feeling relaxed, stimulated and happy), cold chills (chills co-occurring with frowning, cold, sadness and anger), and moving chills (chills co-occurring with tears, feeling a lump in the throat, emotional intensity, and feelings of affection, tenderness and being moved). Warm chills were linked to stimuli expressing social communion and love; cold chills were elicited by stimuli portraying entities in distress, and support from one to another; moving chills were elicited by most stimuli, but their incidence were also predicted by ratings of trait empathy. Findings are discussed in terms of being moved, the importance of differing induction mechanisms such as shared experience and empathic concern, and the implications of distinct chills categories for both individual differences and inconsistencies in the existing aesthetic chills literature."
https://openalex.org/W2983833212,"Proteins of nuclear receptor subfamily 4 group A (NR4A), including NR4A1/NGFI-B, NR4A2/Nurr1, and NR4A3/NOR-1, are nuclear transcription factors that play important roles in metabolism, apoptosis, and proliferation. NR4A proteins recognize DNA response elements as monomers or dimers to regulate the transcription of a variety of genes involved in multiple biological processes. In this study, we determined two crystal structures of the NR4A2 DNA-binding domain (NR4A2-DBD) bound to two Nur-responsive elements: an inverted repeat and an everted repeat at 2.6-2.8 Å resolution. The structures revealed that two NR4A2-DBD molecules bind independently to the everted repeat, whereas two other NR4A2-DBD molecules form a novel dimer interface on the inverted repeat. Moreover, substitution of the interfacial residue valine 298 to lysine as well as mutation of DNA bases involved in the interactions abolished the dimerization. Overall, our structural, biochemical, and bioinformatics analyses provide a molecular basis for the binding of the NR4A2 protein dimers to NurREs and advance our understanding of the dimerization specificity of nuclear receptors."

Change detection technique was applied in order to classify variations among different surface cover aspects, during three successive stages between 1985 and 2017 (i.e., 1985 to 1999 (14 years), 1999 to 2013 (14 years), and 2013 to 2017 (4 years)), using two scenarios. During the first stage, significant urban sprawl (i.e., 3,200 ha) occurred on bare lands within the old oasis, while only 590 ha of the oasis’s vegetation area was occupied by urban cover. However, the final stage revealed rapid urban development (1,270 ha by 2017) within the oasis’s vegetation region, while no urban sprawl occurred on bare lands (area of 1,900 ha, same as that in 1999–2013). Vegetation cover of around 1,000 ha changed to the bare soil class, in addition to the areas that were occupied by the urban class (1,700 ha in total). The study provides quantitative information on the influence of urban development on the spatial changes in vegetation cover of the oasis, especially during recent decades."

Here, we report that MOV10 dramatically reduces the levels of intracellular HBV DNA, resulting in significant inhibition of both the HBV experimental strain and the clinical isolates. Mechanistic experiments revealed that MOV10 interacts with HBV RNA and blocks the early step of viral reverse transcription, thereby impairing viral DNA synthesis, without affecting viral gene expression and pregenomic RNA encapsidation. Moreover, mutation of the helicase domain of MOV10 caused loss of binding to HBV RNA and of the anti-HBV activity.

It is estimated that ~2 billion people have been exposed to HBV, with more than 10% becoming chronic carriers (1.Schweitzer A. Horn J. Mikolajczyk R.T. Krause G. Ott J.J. Estimations of worldwide prevalence of chronic hepatitis B virus infection: A systematic review of data published between 1965 and 2013.Lancet. 2015; 386 (26231459): 1546-155510.1016/S0140-6736(15)61412-XAbstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1811) Google Scholar). Chronic HBV infection greatly increases the risk of developing progressive liver diseases (2.Arzumanyan A. Reis H.M.

HBV-related liver diseases, including liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma, account for about 1 million deaths per year worldwide (3.Lavanchy D.

Hence, HBV infection represents a major threat to public health. hepatitis B virus covalently closed circular DNA cytomegalovirus pregenomic RNA polymerase quantitative PCR relaxed circular RNase H RNA immunoprecipitation single-stranded DNA. As the best-studied member of Hepadnaviridae, HBV has also been classified as a pararetrovirus, because HBV DNA genome is generated by reverse transcription of the pregenomic RNA (pgRNA) (4.Nassal M. Hepatitis B viruses: Reverse transcription a different way.Virus. Res. 2008; 134 (18339439): 235-24910.1016/j.virusres.2007.12.024Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). The synthesis of viral genomic DNA requires encapsidation of the 3.5-kb pgRNA into nascent nucleocapsid, which depends on viral polymerase (Pol) which selectively recognizes pgRNA via an RNA stem-loop structure called the 5′ɛ encapsidation signal. Following encapsidation, pgRNA is reverse transcribed by the co-packaged HBV Pol into a 3.2-kb partial dsDNA within viral nucleocapsid (5.Hirsch R.C. Lavine J.E. Chang L.J. Varmus H.E. Ganem D. Polymerase gene products of hepatitis B viruses are required for genomic RNA packaging as well as for reverse transcription.Nature. 1990; 344 (1690862): 552-55510.1038/344552a0Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). In addition to viral pgRNA and proteins, several host factors have been reported to regulate HBV DNA replication. For instance, heat shock protein 90 is incorporated into nucleocapsid and promotes viral DNA synthesis (6.Hu J. Toft D.O. Seeger C. Hepadnavirus assembly and reverse transcription require a multi-component chaperone complex which is incorporated into nucleocapsids.The EMBO J. 1997; 16 (9009268): 59-6810.1093/emboj/16.1.59Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). In contrast, human cytidine deaminase APOBEC3G functions as a host restriction factor by inhibiting HBV reverse transcription (7.Nguyen D.H. Gummuluru S. Hu J. Deamination-independent inhibition of hepatitis B virus reverse transcription by APOBEC3G.J.

It remains to be determined whether there exist other host factors which also modulate HBV reverse transcription. Human Moloney leukemia virus 10 (MOV10) protein is a 110-kDa RNA helicase. It contains seven conserved helicase motifs (I, Ia, II, III, IV, V, and VI) in its C terminus and is classified as a member of the helicase superfamily 1 based on the DEAG signature sequence in its motif II (9.Wang X. Han Y. Dang Y. Fu W. Zhou T. Ptak R.G. Zheng Y.H. Moloney leukemia virus 10 (MOV10) protein inhibits retrovirus replication.J. Biol.

MOV10 was initially identified as a putative GTP-binding protein in a transgenic mouse strain, which carried one copy of integrated proviral genome of Moloney leukemia virus located in the MOV-10 gene locus (10.Mooslehner K.

The cellular functions of MOV10 protein remained unknown until it was found to associate with argonaute proteins in the RNA-induced silencing complex, and thus is required for microRNA-guided mRNA cleavage (12.Meister G.

Besides the critical role in RNA silencing, several recent reports have uncovered additional functions of MOV10, including suppression of retrotransposition of endogenous retroelements and promoting the degradation of UPF1-regulated mRNA transcripts (13.Goodier J.L.

Increasing experimental evidence has shown that MOV10 plays an active role in viral replication. In the case of hepatitis D virus, MOV10 promotes viral replication through enhancing RNA-directed transcription (16.Haussecker D. Cao D. Huang Y. Parameswaran P. Fire A.Z. Kay M.A. Capped small RNAs and MOV10 in human hepatitis delta virus replication.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15 (18552826): 714-72110.1038/nsmb.1440Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). However, for the other viruses that have been tested, MOV10 acts as a host restriction factor. Ectopic expression of MOV10 represses replication of a number of retroviruses, although the antiviral activity of endogenous MOV10 remains inconclusive (17.Schoggins J.W. Wilson S.J. Panis M.

The antiretroviral activity of MOV10 is well-established for HIV type 1 (HIV-1) by three independent studies, which demonstrate that MOV10 is efficiently incorporated into HIV-1 virions and interferes with viral reverse transcription in the target cells (9.Wang X.

MOV10 has been further reported to inhibit retrotransposition of intracisternal a particles, an endogenous retrovirus in the mammalian genome (22.Lu C. Luo Z. Jäger S. Krogan N.J. Peterlin B.M. Moloney leukemia virus type 10 inhibits reverse transcription and retrotransposition of intracisternal a particles.J.

Although HBV is a DNA virus, replication of its DNA genome involves reverse transcription, which raises the possibility that MOV10 may also inhibit HBV infection. Indeed, in this study, we observed that MOV10 restricted HBV replication by reducing the level of intracellular viral DNA. Furthermore, our data showed that MOV10 targeted the early step of HBV reverse transcription. To investigate the effect of MOV10 on HBV replication, an overlength 1.1-mer HBV construct was co-transfected into HepG2 cells together with different amounts of MOV10-expressing plasmids, and with constant amount of GFP-expressing plasmids to normalize the transfection efficiency. Three days after transient transfection, the transfected cells were harvested and the expressions of MOV10 and GFP proteins were examined by immunoblotting with the respective antibodies (Fig. 1A). To determine HBV replication, we first measured the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) in the extracellular culture medium and found that MOV10 had no significant effect on the level of secreted HBsAg (Fig. 1B). Next, intracellular HBV DNA was extracted and subsequently analyzed by Southern blotting and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR), respectively. Interestingly, we found that overexpression of MOV10 reduced HBV DNA levels in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1, C and D). Because the data of qPCR were consistent with that of Southern blotting (Fig. 1, C and D), we employed qPCR method to detect HBV DNA in following experiments. Furthermore, we analyzed HBV DNA levels and the infectivity of released viral particles in the extracellular culture medium. We observed similar degree of inhibition by MOV10 (Fig. 1, E–G), suggesting MOV10 inhibits intracellular viral DNA synthesis, not virus release. Next, we investigated the impact of endogenous MOV10 knockdown on HBV replication. To this end, we established a stable HepG2 cell line that was transduced with MOV10 shRNA. The decrease of MOV10 in this cell line was confirmed by the results of Western blotting (Fig. 2A). We found that MOV10 depletion had no significant effect on secreted HBsAg level (Fig. 2B), whereas intracellular HBV DNA levels increased by about 2-fold (Fig. 2C), suggesting endogenous MOV10 suppresses HBV replication. To answer whether above findings were reproducible in other hepatoma cell lines, we performed the same experiments in Huh7 cells and observed similar inhibitory effect of MOV10 on HBV DNA replication (Fig. S1, A–G), which supports that MOV10-mediated inhibition of HBV is not cell type–specific. Finally, we examined the anti-HBV activity of MOV10 with four more HBV-expressing DNA constructs which were cloned from the sera of chronic hepatitis B patients. These four HBV-expressing DNA constructs carry 1.3-mer the HBV genomes of two major different genotypes, B (HBV-B) and C (HBV-C), and the DNA construct pCMV-HBV we tested in the above experiments contains the HBV genome of genotype D. The results showed that MOV10 reduced the intracellular DNA levels of all four clinical HBV isolates (Fig. 3). Taken together, these data indicate that MOV10 restricts HBV replication by reducing the level of intracellular viral DNA. We next asked whether the RNA helicase activity of MOV10 is required for the inhibition of HBV replication. Among the seven conserved helicase motifs of MOV10, motif I and motif II are Walker A (GKT) and Walker B (DEAG) motifs, respectively. These two motifs are essential for the ATPase activity (23.Singleton M.R. Dillingham M.S. Wigley D.B. Structure and mechanism of helicases and nucleic acid translocases.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2007; 76 (17506634): 23-5010.1146/annurev.biochem.76.052305.115300Crossref PubMed Scopus (956) Google Scholar), thus mutating either of them inactivates the helicase activity of MOV10 (15.Gregersen L.H. Schueler M. Munschauer M. Mastrobuoni G. Chen W. Kempa S. Dieterich C. Landthaler M. MOV10 is a 5′ to 3′ RNA helicase contributing to UPF1 mRNA target degradation by translocation along 3′ UTRs.Mol.

Accordingly, two MOV10 helicase mutants, MOV10 (KR) and MOV10 (EQ), were generated by changing the amino acids Lys-531 and Glu-647 to Arg and Gln, respectively (Fig. 4A). Expression of these two MOV10 mutants was confirmed by immunoblotting (Fig. 4B). Analysis of intracellular HBV DNA revealed that anti-HBV activities of both MOV10 mutants were attenuated compared with the WT MOV10, with the MOV10 (EQ) mutant exhibiting relatively stronger anti-HBV activity than the MOV10 (KR) mutant (Fig. 4C). This observation is in agreement with previous reports showing significantly reduced activities of these two mutants against HIV-1 and LINE-1 (14.Li X. Zhang J. Jia R. Cheng V. Xu X. Qiao W. Guo F. Liang C. Cen S. The MOV10 helicase inhibits LINE-1 mobility.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288 (23754279): 21148-2116010.1074/jbc.M113.465856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 24.Izumi T. Burdick R. Shigemi M. Plisov S. Hu W.S. Pathak V.K.

Virol. 2013; 87 (23926332): 11047-1106210.1128/JVI.02070-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We next determined which step of HBV replication was inhibited by MOV10. MOV10 has been reported to regulate gene expression (12.Meister G. Landthaler M. Peters L. Chen P.Y. Urlaub H. Lührmann R. Tuschl T. Identification of novel argonaute-associated proteins.Curr. Biol. 2005; 15 (16289642): 2149-215510.1016/j.cub.2005.10.048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 15.Gregersen L.H. Schueler M. Munschauer M. Mastrobuoni G. Chen W.

Therefore, it may exert its antiviral activity by directly reducing viral RNA levels. To test this possibility, we co-transfected HepG2 cells with the 1.1-mer HBV construct along with the MOV10-expressing plasmid, or control vector. Three days after transfection, the total RNA of transfected cells were extracted and the levels of viral RNAs were measured by qPCR. The data showed that MOV10 had no significant effect on the levels of the total and the 3.5 kb HBV RNA (Fig. 5A). We next analyzed viral protein expression by Western blotting and detected no significant difference in the hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg) expression (Fig. 5B), which is consistent with the observation that MOV10 did not affect the levels of secreted HBsAg (Figs. 1B and 2B), suggesting that MOV10 does not affect the expression of viral proteins. Next, we examined whether MOV10 affects HBV pgRNA encapsidation. To specifically detect the effect of MOV10 on pgRNA encapsidation, 1 day after transfection, we treated the cells with 100 μm lamivudine to block viral reverse transcription, the step following pgRNA encapsidation. Three days after transfection, we extracted and analyzed total viral RNAs and encapsidated pgRNAs, respectively. The qPCR results showed that the encapsidation efficiency was not changed by MOV10 overexpression (Fig. 5C), suggesting MOV10 inhibits HBV genome replication downstream of pgRNA encapsidation, either by blocking viral DNA synthesis, or promoting degradation of the synthesized HBV DNA. To determine whether MOV10 accelerates the degradation of HBV DNA, we treated the transfected cells at day 3 after transfection with high dose of lamivudine (100 μm) to block further DNA synthesis. Then, we measured the intracellular HBV DNA levels at different time points as indicated (Fig. 5D). Our data showed that the decay kinetics of HBV DNA remained the same, regardless of MOV10 expression (Fig. 5D). In summary, these data support that MOV10 reduces intracellular HBV DNA levels through inhibiting viral DNA synthesis. Next, we examined which step of viral DNA synthesis was affected by MOV10. The synthesis of HBV genomic DNA is initiated by reverse transcription of viral pgRNA into minus-strand DNA, followed by copying minus-strand DNA into the plus-strand DNA (25.Nassal M. HBV cccDNA: Viral persistence reservoir and key obstacle for a cure of chronic hepatitis B.Gut. 2015; 64 (26048673): 1972-198410.1136/gutjnl-2015-309809Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). To specifically measure the effect of MOV10 on viral reverse transcription, we employed an RH-defective polymerase HBV mutant, which is unable to degrade the pgRNA during reverse transcription, resulting in accumulation of nascent minus-strand DNA and the absence of plus-strand DNA (7.Nguyen D.H. Gummuluru S. Hu J. Deamination-independent inhibition of hepatitis B virus reverse transcription by APOBEC3G.J. Virol. 2007; 81 (17314171): 4465-447210.1128/JVI.02510-06Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). We co-transfected HepG2 cells with WT or RH-defective polymerase mutant together with control or MOV10-expressing plasmids. Three days after transfection, intracellular viral DNA was extracted and analyzed by Southern blotting and qPCR, respectively. Consistent with previous report (7.Nguyen D.H. Gummuluru S. Hu J. Deamination-independent inhibition of hepatitis B virus reverse transcription by APOBEC3G.J. Virol. 2007; 81 (17314171): 4465-447210.1128/JVI.02510-06Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), RH-defective polymerase mutant synthesized double-strand DNA-RNA hybrids, which migrate between ssDNA and relaxed circular (RC) DNA (Fig. 6A). MOV10 reduced levels of intracellular minus-strand DNA by about 3-fold, which is similar to its effect on the synthesis of WT HBV DNA (Fig. 6, A and B). Furthermore, to examine the effect of MOV10 on elongation of minus-strand DNA synthesis, we analyzed extracted intracellular minus-strand DNA by qPCR with different sets of primers (Fig. 6C). The data of qPCR analysis with different sets of primers showed similar reduction of HBV DNA (Fig. 6C), suggesting MOV10 blocks very early steps of viral reverse transcription, not elongation of minus-strand DNA. Because our data suggest that MOV10 inhibits HBV DNA synthesis at the reverse transcription step, we investigated whether MOV10 interacts with viral Pol or viral RNA. We first examined the interaction between MOV10 and viral Pol by performing immunoprecipitation. Human cytidine deaminase APOBEC3G, which has been reported to interact with HBV Pol (26.Nguyen D.H. Hu J. Reverse transcriptase– and RNA packaging signal–dependent incorporation of APOBEC3G into hepatitis B virus nucleocapsids.J. Virol. 2008; 82 (18480459): 6852-686110.1128/JVI.00465-08Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), was used as a positive control. Our data did not show any detectable interaction between MOV10 and HBV Pol, whereas APOBEC3G co-precipitated with Pol, as expected (Fig. 7A). We next investigated whether MOV10 binds to HBV RNA by conducting RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) analysis. We used anti-MOV10 antibody and anti-Flag antibody to precipitate endogenous and FLAG-tagged MOV10, respectively. Co-immunoprecipitated RNA was extracted and analyzed by qPCR. These results showed that both endogenous and exogenous MOV10 associated with HBV RNA (Fig. 7, B and C). Furthermore, we also performed RIP assay to assess the interaction of MOV10 mutants, MOV10 (KR), and MOV10 (EQ), with HBV RNA. Interestingly, these two mutants, with attenuated anti-HBV activities, also have decreased HBV RNA–binding capacity compared with WT MOV10. Consistent with their relative anti-HBV activities, the MOV10 (EQ) mutant had stronger interaction with viral RNA compared with the MOV10 (KR) mutant (Fig. 7C). Finally, we tested anti-HBV activity of MOV10 in HepG2-hNTCP cells. We transduced HepG2-hNTCP cells with lentivirus expressing MOV10 or MOV10 shRNA to establish the MOV10-overexpressing or knockdown cell lines. The expression of MOV10 in these cell lines was examined by immunoblotting (Fig. 8A). Then, the equivalent amounts of HBV virions were used to infect these cell lines. One week after infection, intracellular HBV DNA in infected cells was extracted and analyzed by qPCR. The results showed that HBV DNA was reduced by about 70% in the MOV10-overexpressing cell line (Fig. 8B). In contrast, HBV replication was increased by about 3-fold upon MOV10 knockdown (Fig. 8B). Interestingly, we also observed a moderate effect of MOV10 on the levels of HBsAg and viral RNA (Fig. 8, C and D). Then, we measured HBV covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) and found that the effect of MOV10 on HBsAg and viral RNA was mainly attributed to its effect on cccDNA formation (Fig. 8E), which indicates MOV10 also plays a role at early stage of the HBV life cycle. RNA helicases play an important role in the host innate response against viral infection (19.Ranji A. Boris-Lawrie K. RNA helicases: Emerging roles in viral replication and the host innate response.RNA Biol. 2010; 7 (21173576): 775-78710.4161/rna.7.6.14249Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar).

In the present study, we have identified another RNA helicase MOV10, which restricts HBV replication. Our data show that MOV10 represses HBV replication by dramatically reducing the intracellular viral DNA levels. In addition to the genotype D strain, which is commonly used in HBV research, four HBV strains (two genotype B and two genotype C), which were cloned from the sera of chronic hepatitis B patients, were used to test the anti-HBV activity of MOV10. Our results demonstrate that MOV10 possesses broad activity against different HBV genotypes. In this study, we also tried to identify the stages of the HBV replicative cycle that are affected by MOV10. We first examined the effect of MOV10 on viral gene expression. Our data show that MOV10 has no significant effect on the expressions of HBV RNAs and viral proteins, which is similar to the findings with intracisternal a particles and HIV-1 (9.Wang X. Han Y.

However, it is worthy to note that we used co-transfected GFP gene instead of endogenous GAPDH as the internal control. In some of our experiments, we observed slight decrease of viral and GFP expression in MOV10 overexpressing cells (data not shown). This minor effect could simply result from different transfection efficiency. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that MOV10 nonspecifically affects both exogenous HBV and GFP levels. Similarly, Burdick et al. (21.Burdick R. Smith J.L. Chaipan C. Friew Y. Chen J. Venkatachari N.J. Delviks-Frankenberry K.A. Hu W.S. Pathak V.K. P body-associated protein Mov10 inhibits HIV-1 replication at multiple stages.J.

In any case, the primary inhibitory effect of MOV10 on HBV DNA production does not result from affecting viral gene expression. Next, we examined the effect of MOV10 on encapsidation of viral pgRNA as well as stability of synthesized HBV DNA. Our data show that both processes are not affected by MOV10. Moreover, by utilizing an RH-defective HBV mutant, we show that MOV10 reduces levels of minus-strand viral DNA, suggesting that MOV10 reduces the intracellular viral DNA levels most likely by interfering with viral reverse transcription. The exact mechanism of MOV10-mediated inhibition of reverse transcription remains unclear. It is possible that MOV10 exerts its effect by steric hindrance or structure changes in viral RNA as prop"

Despite the expanding cadre of characterized cellular adaptations to ER stress, knowledge of the effects of ER stress on cellular physiology remains incomplete. We investigated the impact of ER stress on ER and inner nuclear membrane protein quality control mechanisms in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We analyzed the turnover of substrates of four ubiquitin ligases (Doa10, Rkr1/Ltn1, Hrd1, and the Asi complex) and the metalloprotease Ste24 in induced models of ER stress. ER stress did not substantially impact Doa10 or Rkr1 substrates. However, Hrd1-mediated destruction of a protein that aberrantly engages the translocon (Deg1-Sec62) and substrates with luminal degradation signals was markedly impaired by ER stress; by contrast, Hrd1-dependent degradation of proteins with intramembrane degrons was largely unperturbed by ER stress. ER stress impaired the degradation of one of two Asi substrates analyzed and caused a translocon-clogging Ste24 substrate to accumulate in a form consistent with persistent translocon occupation. Degradation of Deg1-Sec62 in the absence of stress and stabilization during ER stress were independent of four ER stress–sensing pathways. Our results indicate ER stress differentially impacts degradation of protein quality control substrates, including those mediated by the same ubiquitin ligase. These observations suggest the existence of additional regulatory mechanisms dictating substrate selection during ER stress.

https://openalex.org/W2892180700,"Repeated quantitative measurement of bacterial DNA on whole blood has been shown to be a promising method for monitoring bloodstream infection (BSI) with selected bacterial species. To enable broad use of this method, we developed a quantitative droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) method for 16S rDNA. It was validated with species-specific ddPCRs for Staphylococcus aureus (nuc), Streptococcus pneumoniae (lytA), and Escherichia coli (uidA) on spiked whole blood samples and on repeated whole blood samples (days 0, 1–2, 3–4, 6–8, and 13–15) from 83 patients with BSI with these pathogens. In these patients, 16S rDNA and species-specific DNA were detected in 60% and 61%, respectively, at least at one time-point. The highest positivity rates were seen in S. aureus BSI, where 92% of the patients were 16S rDNA-positive and 85% nuc-positive. Quantitative 16S rDNA and species-specific DNA showed strong correlations in spiked samples (r = 0.98; p < 0.0001) and clinical samples (r = 0.84; p < 0.0001). Positivity for 16S rDNA was rapidly cleared in patients with S. pneumoniae and E. coli BSI, but more slowly and sometimes persisted, in those with S. aureus BSI. The initial 16S rDNA load was higher in BSI patients with sepsis (Sepsis-3 definition) than without sepsis (median 2.38 vs. 0 lg10 copies/mL; p = 0.031) and in non-survivors than in survivors (median 2.83 vs. 0 lg10 copies/mL; p = 0.006). 16S rDNA ddPCR appears to be a promising method for bacterial DNA monitoring during BSI. The clinical value of such monitoring should be further studied."
https://openalex.org/W2987872789,"Anurans exhibit limited dispersion ability and have physiological and behavioural characteristics that narrow their relationships with both environmental and spatial predictors. So, the relative contributions of environmental and spatial predictors in the patterns of taxonomic and functional anuran beta diversity were examined in a metacommunity of 33 ponds along the coast of south Brazil. We expected that neutral processes and, in particular, niche-based processes could have similar influence on the taxonomic and functional beta diversity patterns. Distance-based methods (db-RDA) with variation partitioning were conducted with abundance data to examine taxonomic and functional facets and components (total, turnover and nestedness) in relation to environmental and spatial predictors. Processes determining metacommunity structure differed between the components of beta diversity and among taxonomic and functional diversity. While taxonomic beta diversity was further accounted by both environmental and spatial predictors, functional beta diversity responded more strongly to spatial predictors. These two contrasting patterns were different to what we had predicted, suggesting that while there is a taxonomic turnover mediated by environmental filters, the spatial distance promotes the trait dissimilarity between sites. In addition, our data confirm that neutral and niche-based processes operate on anuran metacommunities even at short geographic scales. Our results reinforce the idea that studies aiming to evaluate the patterns of structure in metacommunities should include different facets of diversity so that better interpretations can be achieved."
https://openalex.org/W2985568596,"Selaginella tamariscina (Beauv.) spring, a primitive vascular resurrection plant, can survive extreme drought and recover when water becomes available. To identify drought-inducible genes and to clarify the molecular mechanism of drought tolerance, a comparative transcriptional pattern analysis was conducted between S. tamariscina and Selaginella moellendorffii Hieron (drought sensitive). 133 drought related genes were identified, including 72 functional genes and 61 regulatory genes. And several drought responsive reactions, such as antioxidant activity, osmotic balance, cuticle defense and signal transduction were highlighted in S. tamariscina under drought. Notably, besides peroxidase, catalase and L-ascorbate oxidase genes, DEGs associated with phenylalanine metabolism and polyamine catabolism could be alternative ways to enhance antioxidant ability in S. tamariscina. DEGs related to soluble carbohydrate metabolism, late embryogenesis abundant protein (LEA) and aquaporin protein (AQP) confirmed that osmotic adjustment could resist drought during desiccation. DEGs involved in xyloglucan metabolic process, pectin metabolic process and cutin biosynthesis may also contribute to drought tolerance of S. tamariscina by cuticle defense. Drought-responsive genes encoding protein kinases, calcium sensors, transcription factors (TFs) and plant hormones also help to drought resistance of S. tamariscina. The preliminary validation experiments were performed and the results were consistent with our hypothetical integrated regulatory network. The results of this study provide candidate resurrection genes and an integrated regulatory network for further studies on the molecular mechanisms of stress tolerance in S. tamariscina."

Having incidentally discovered that overexpression of plasma membrane Na+/H+ exchanger 1 (NHE1) induces cell death in iPSCs, we investigated the mechanism of NHE1-induced cell death. Doxycycline-induced NHE1 overexpression arrested cell growth, and nearly all cells were killed by a necrotic process within 72 h. NHE1 overexpression led to sustained activation of Rho-associated coiled-coil kinase (ROCK), accompanied by dramatic changes in cell shape, cell elongation, and swelling of peripheral cells in iPSC colonies, as well as marked stress fiber formation. The ROCK inhibitor Y27632 reduced NHE1-induced cell death. ROCK-dependent phenotypes were suppressed by a loss-of-function mutation of NHE1 and inhibited by an inhibitor of NHE1 activity, indicating that NHE1-mediated transport activity is required. Moreover, ROCK was activated by trimethylamine treatment–mediated cytosolic alkalinization and accumulated in the plasma membrane near NHE1 in peripheral iPSCs of cell colonies. By contrast, cell death did not occur in mesendoderm-like cells that had differentiated from iPSCs, indicating that the NHE1-mediated effects were specific for iPSCs. These results suggest that NHE1 overexpression specifically induces death of iPSCs via sustained ROCK activation, probably caused by an increase in local pH near NHE1.

Women in Brazil are also affected by interpersonal violence. We aimed to estimate the lifetime prevalence of three forms of interpersonal violence against women (IPVAW) and to identify sociodemographic factors associated with IPVAW in one urban Brazilian city. Methods Using a cross-sectional design, we interviewed women aged ≥18 years in the urban Brazilian city, Maringá, who currently have or have had an intimate partner. The 13-item WHO Violence Against Women instrument was used to ask participants about their experiences with intimate partner violence, categorized into psychological, physical and sexual violence. We estimated associations between IPVAW and sociodemographic characteristics using generalized linear models. Results and conclusions Of the 419 women who were enrolled and met inclusion criteria, lifetime prevalence of IPVAW was 56%. Psychological violence was more prevalent (52%) than physical (21%) or sexual violence (13%). Twenty-eight women (6.4%) experienced all three forms of IPVAW. Women were more likely to experience violence if they were employed, did not live with their partner or had 4 or more children. Educational level, household income, age and race were not significantly associated factors. Our findings highlight a high prevalence of IPVAW in a community in southern Brazil."

We surveyed 27 green roofs and the adjacent ground habitat in six major cities in the southeastern United States. We found a total of 18 species of land snails, with three considered to be non-native or invasive species. The majority of land snails encountered in surveys are widespread, generalist species, typically adapted to open habitats. Twelve of the land snails encountered are “greenhouse” species that are very commonly transported via the horticultural trade. Therefore, we infer that at least some land snail species are introduced to green roofs via initial green roof installation and associated landscaping. The major determinants of snail species richness and abundance are the size of each roof and the quality of green roof maintenance regime."

Methods Twenty-one subjects affected by epiretinal membrane with surgical indication for pars-plana vitrectomy underwent treatment with 1 drop 3 times/day of a solution of citicoline 2%, 0.2% high molecular weight hyaluronic acid and 0.01% benzalkonium chloride (OMK1, Omikron Italia s.r.l., Rome, Italy) 14 days before surgery and 2 hours prior to surgery. Five additional patients served as controls and received an OMK1 vehicle solution without citicoline. The vitreous samples were taken at the beginning of the pars-plana vitrectomy and analyzed for qualitative/quantitative determination of vitreous concentration of citicoline and its metabolites by means of high performance liquid chromatography. Results The overall mean concentration of citicoline in patients treated with citicoline 2% solution was 406.72 ± 52.99 μg/mL, while the mean concentration of choline, cytidine and uridine was 180.88 ± 41.49 μg/mL, 44.45 ± 10.19 μg/mL and 330.41 ± 75.8 μg/mL, respectively. The concentration of citicoline in phakic eyes (n = 13, 366.61 ± 129.61 μg/mL) was lower compared to that found in pseudophakic eyes (n = 8, 435.89 ± 131.42 μg/mL) and the difference was not statistically significant. The concentration of citicoline in the control eyes was 45.66 ± 26.36 μg/mL, while the concentration of choline, cytidine and uridine were 17.21 ± 9.93 μg/mL, 6.24 ± 3.6 μg/mL and 172.80 ± 99.76 μg/mL, respectively. Conclusion Citicoline can reach the human vitreous in high concentration when administered in ophthalmic solution. This evidence contributes to the build-up of the pyramid of the evidences required for determining the role of citicoline administered in ophthalmic formulation in retinal and optic nerve neurodegenerative diseases."

In the current study, we aimed to clarify the clinical significance of UMOD in ANCA-associated glomerulonephritis (AAG). Materials and methods Sixty-one biopsy-proven AAG patients were included in this study. UMOD was measured using ELISA. The relationships between serum UMOD (sUMOD) levels and various clinicopathological findings were evaluated. Results AAG was classified into four categories (focal, crescentic, mixed, and sclerotic). In addition, tubulointerstitial lesions were classified as mild, moderate, and severe. The levels of sUMOD and urinary UMOD (uUMOD) were correlated with each other. A negative correlation between sUMOD levels and serum Cr levels, and positive correlation between sUMOD levels and eGFR were found. Patients in the high sUMOD group were associated with low serum Cr levels, focal classification, and mild tubulointerstitial injury compared to the low sUMOD group. Comparing the characteristics among histopathological classes, patients in the focal class had the best renal function and the highest levels of uUMOD/Cr and sUMOD. The focal class had significantly better renal survival compared with the severe histopathological classes (crescentic, mixed, and sclerotic). In univariate logistic regression analyses, prognostic factors for severe histopathological classes were low uUMOD/Cr, high serum Cr, and low sUMOD. Multivariate analyses revealed that low sUMOD predicted severe histopathological classes independent of serum Cr. The mean levels of sUMOD were significantly different between the focal class and severe histopathological classes, with a sensitivity of 70.6% and specificity of 90.0% (cut-off 143 ng/ml, AUC 0.80) by ROC curves. Conclusion Low sUMOD levels were associated with severe clinicopathological findings and might be considered as a risk factor for end stage renal disease in AAG."

Studies have explored the association between infants delivered by caesarean section and their later life risk of obesity, in many countries outside Africa. As a result of the increasing caesarean section and obesity rates in South Africa, we investigated the association in this country.This was a retrospective analysis of data that were collected from a prospective South African birth cohort (Birth to Twenty Plus), established in 1990. A total of 889 young adults aged 21-24 years were included in the analysis. Poisson regression models were fitted to assess the association between mode of delivery and early adulthood obesity.Of the 889 young adults, 106 (11.9%) were obese while 72 (8.1%) were delivered by caesarean section; of which 14 (19.4%) were obese. Caesarean section delivery was significantly associated with obesity in young adults after adjusting for potential confounders like young adults' sex and birth weight, mothers' parity, and education (incidence rate ratio 1.64, 95% CI 1.01-2.68, p = 0.045).The association of caesarean section with early adulthood obesity should be interpreted with caution because data on certain key confounding factors such as mothers' pre-pregnancy body mass index and gestational diabetes were not available. Further research from Africa, with larger sample sizes and databases with useful linking of maternal and infant data, should be conducted."

To overcome this, genotype-matched vaccines have been proposed. To date, this approach has never been tested against genotype XII strains. In this study, we generated and assessed the protection against genotype XII challenge of two chimeric NDV vaccine strains (rLS1-XII-1 and rLS1-XII-2). The rLS1-XII-1 virus has the complete fusion protein (F) and the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) open reading frames replaced with those from genotype XII strain NDV/peacock/Peru/2011 (PP2011) in a recombinant LaSota (rLS1) backbone. In rLS1-XII-2 virus, cytoplasmic tails of F and HN proteins were restored to those of rLS1. In vitro evaluation showed that rLS1-XII-2 and the parental rLS1 strains replicate at higher efficiencies than rLS1-XII-1. In the first vaccine/challenge experiment, SPF chickens vaccinated with rLS1-XII-1 virus showed only 71.3% protection, whereas, rLS1 and rLS1-XII-2 vaccinated chickens were fully protected. In a second experiment, both rLS1-XII-2 and the commercial vaccine strain LaSota induced 100% protection. However, rLS1-XII-2 virus significantly reduced viral shedding, both in the number of shedding birds and in quantity of shed virus. In conclusion, we have developed a vaccine candidate capable of fully protecting chickens against genotype XII challenges. Furthermore, we have shown the importance of cytoplasmic tails in virus replication and vaccine competence."

We present the establishment of a co-culture model using primary equine bronchial epithelial cells (EBECs) and equine bronchial fibroblasts (EBFs). EBFs at passage between 4 and 8 were seeded on the bottom of 24-well plates and treated with mitomycin C at 80% confluency. Then, freshly isolated (P0) or passaged (P1) EBECs were seeded on the upper surface of membrane inserts that had been placed inside the EBF-containing well plates and grown first under liquid-liquid interface (LLI) then under air-liquid interface (ALI) conditions to induce epithelial differentiation. Morphological, structural and functional markers were monitored in co-cultured P0 and P1 EBEC monolayers by phase-contrast microscopy, scanning and transmission electron microscopy, hematoxylin-eosin, immunocytochemistry as well as by measuring the transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and transepithelial transport of selected drugs. After about 15–20 days of co-culture at ALI, P0 and P1 EBEC monolayers showed pseudo-stratified architecture, presence of ciliated cells, typically honeycomb-like pattern of tight junction protein 1 (TJP1) expression, and intact selective barrier functions. Interestingly, some notable differences were observed in the behaviour of co-cultured EBECs (adhesion to culture support, growth rate, differentiation rate) as compared to our previously described EBEC mono-culture system, suggesting that cross-talk between epithelial cells and fibroblasts actually takes place in our current co-culture setup through paracrine signalling. The EBEC-EBF co-culture model described herein will offer the opportunity to investigate epithelial-mesenchymal cell interactions and underlying disease mechanisms in the equine airways, thereby leading to a better understanding of their relevance to pathophysiology and treatment of equine and human asthma."
https://openalex.org/W2984458407,"Domestic dogs share the same environment as humans, and they represent a valuable animal model to study naturally-occurring human disease. Platelet proteomics holds promise for the discovery of biomarkers that capture the contribution of platelets to the pathophysiology of many disease states, however, canine platelet proteomic studies are lacking. Our study objectives were to establish a protocol for proteomic identification and quantification of the thrombin-activated canine platelet secretome (CAPS), and to compare the CAPS proteins to human and murine platelet proteomic data. Washed platelets were isolated from healthy dogs, and stimulated with saline (control) or gamma-thrombin (releasate). Proteins were separated by SDS-page, trypsin-digested and analyzed by liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry (MS). CAPS proteins were defined as those with a MS1-abundance ratio of two or more for releasate vs. unstimulated saline control. A total of 1,918 proteins were identified, with 908 proteins common to all dogs and 693 characterized as CAPS proteins. CAPS proteins were similar to human and murine platelet secretomes and were highly represented in hemostatic pathways. Differences unique to CAPS included replacement of platelet factor 4 with other cleavage products of platelet basic protein (e.g. interleukin-8), novel proteins (e.g. C-C motif chemokine 14), and proteins in relatively high (e.g. protease nexin-1) or low (e.g. von Willebrand factor) abundance. This study establishes the first in-depth platelet releasate proteome from healthy dogs with a reference database of 693 CAPS proteins. Similarities between CAPS and the human secretome confirm the utility of dogs as translational models of human disease, but we also identify differences unique to canine platelets. Our findings provide a resource for further investigations into disease-related CAPS profiles, and for comparative pathway analyses of platelet activation among species."
https://openalex.org/W2988495032,"The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of neuromuscular electrical stimulation training for 12 weeks on the abdominal muscle size in trained athletes. Male collegiate track and field athletes participated in the present study and were randomly allocated to either training or control groups. Eleven participants of the training group completed a 60-session training program over a 12-week period (23 min/session, 5 days/week) involving neuromuscular electrical stimulation (mostly 20 Hz) for the abdominal muscles in addition to their usual training for the own events. The participants of the control group (n = 13) continued their usual training. Before and after the intervention period, cross-sectional areas of the rectus abdominis and abdominal oblique muscles (the internal and external obliques and transversus abdominis) and subcutaneous fat thickness were measured with magnetic resonance and ultrasound imaging. There were no significant changes in cross-sectional area of the rectus abdominis or abdominal oblique muscles or in subcutaneous fat thickness in the training or control groups after the intervention period. The change in cross-sectional area of the rectus abdominis in each participant was not significantly correlated with pre-training cross-sectional area and neither was the mean value of fat thickness at pre- and post-training. These results suggest that low-frequency (20 Hz) neuromuscular electrical stimulation training for 12 weeks is ineffective in inducing hypertrophy of the abdominal muscles in trained athletes, even when they have a thin layer of subcutaneous fat."
https://openalex.org/W2988903046,"Multi-stakeholder platforms have become mainstream in projects, programmes and policy interventions aiming to improve innovation and livelihoods systems, i.e. research for development interventions in low- and middle-income contexts. However, the evidence for multi-stakeholder platforms’ contribution to the performance of research for development interventions and their added value is not compelling. This paper focuses on stakeholder participation as one of the channels for multi-stakeholder platforms’ contribution to the performance of research for development interventions, i.e. stakeholder participation. It uses a quantitative approach and utilizes descriptive statistics and ARIMA models. It shows that, in three Ugandan multi-stakeholder platform cases studied, participation increased both in nominal and in unique terms. Moreover, participation was rather cyclical and fluctuated during the implementation of the research for development interventions. The study also shows that, in addition to locational and intervention factors such as type of the area along a rural–urban gradient targeted by the intervention and human resources provided for multi-stakeholder platform implementation, temporal elements such as phases of research for development intervention objectives and the innovation development process play significant roles in influencing participation. The study concludes that contribution of multi-stakeholder platforms to the performance of research for development projects, programs, policies and other initiatives is constrained by locational and temporal context and conditional on the participation requirements of the objectives pursued by research for development intervention."
https://openalex.org/W2989301777,"The Colorado Potato Beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata, is a major agricultural pest of solanaceous crops in the United States. Historically, a multitude of insecticides have been used to control problematic populations. Due to increasing resistance to insecticides, novel compounds and methodologies are warranted for the control of beetle populations. Mixed-isomer conjugated linoleic acid has been studied in-depth for its beneficial properties to mammalian systems. At the same time, studies have demonstrated that conjugated linoleic acid can manipulate fatty acid composition in non-mammalian systems, resulting in embryo mortality. Consequently, experiments were conducted to assess the effects of foliar-applied conjugated linoleic acid on larval growth, embryogenesis, and feeding preference in Colorado potato beetle. Both maternal and deterrent effects of dietary conjugated linoleic acid were assessed. Conjugated linoleic acid demonstrated desirable insecticidal properties, including increased larval mortality, slowed larval development, antifeedant effects, and decreased egg viability after maternal ingestion."
https://openalex.org/W2796337209,"Human visual perception is a complex, dynamic and fluctuating process. In addition to the incoming visual stimulus, it is affected by many other factors including temporal context, both external and internal to the observer. In this study we investigate the dynamic properties of psychophysical responses to a continuous stream of visual near-threshold detection tasks. We manipulate the incoming signals to have temporal structures with various characteristic timescales. Responses of human observers to these signals are analyzed using tools that highlight their dynamical features as well. Our experiments show two opposing biases that shape perceptual decision making simultaneously: positive recency, biasing towards repeated response; and adaptation, entailing an increased probability of changed response. While both these effects have been reported in previous work, our results shed new light on the timescales involved in these effects, and on their interplay with varying inputs. We find that positive recency is a short-term bias, inversely correlated with response time, suggesting it can be compensated by afterthought. Adaptation, in contrast, reflects trends over longer times possibly including multiple previous trials. Our entire dataset, which includes different input signal temporal structures, is consistent with a simple model with the two biases characterized by a fixed parameter set. These results suggest that perceptual biases are inherent features which are not flexible to tune to input signals."
https://openalex.org/W2986834687,"Latitudinal diversity gradients are well-known for plants and animals, but only recently similar patterns have been described for some specific microbial communities in distinct habitats. Although microbial diversity is well-investigated worldwide, most of the studies are spatially too restricted to allow general statements about global diversity patterns. Additionally, methodological differences make it hard and often impossible to compare several studies. This study investigated the cyanobacterial diversity in tidal flats along geographical and ecological gradients based on high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA gene fragments (Illumina MiSeq) and environmental data on a large spatial scale from the subtropics to the Arctic. Latitude and strongly correlated environmental parameters (e.g. temperature) were identified as important drivers of cyanobacterial diversity on global scale resulting in a latitudinal diversity gradient similar to that known from plants and animals. Other non-correlated parameters (e.g. grain size) were shown to be more important on local scales, although no consistent pattern occurred across different locations. Among a total number of 989 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) only one cosmopolitan (classified as Coleofasciculus chthonoplastes), but many location-specific and putative endemic ones (78%) were detected. High proportions of rare members of the community (up to 86%) were found in all samples. Phylogenetic beta diversity was shown to be influenced by the developmental stage of the mat community becoming increasingly similar with increasing stabilization."
