https://openalex.org/W1597579132,"The recent electrophoretic experiments of Pauling, Itano, Singer, and Wells (1) have demonstrated that the hemoglobins of normal Negroes and of sickle-cell anemics are unlike; in a buffer of suitable pH the two components of a mixture of these hemoglobins migrate in opposite directions. On the basis of the difference in their isoelectric points, it was concluded that the hemoglobin of sickle-cell anemics has 2 to 4 more net positive charges per molecule than normal hemoglobin. There is evidence that the composition of the heme moiety is the same in both proteins; one hypothesis which has been advanced to explain the dissimilarity of the two hemoglobins assumes a difference in the number or kind of ionizable groups in the molecules, that is, in the acidic or basic amino acids of the globin. Thus, the observed difference in charge might result from a small decrease in the number of acidic amino acids or a small increase in the number of basic amino acids in the molecule of sickle-cell hemoglobin relative to that of normal hemoglobin or from relatively large alterations in amino acid content in which the charges were almost compensated. 

The object of the present study was to determine the amino acid composition of the two hemoglobins in order to ascertain the validity of this hypothesis. The analysis was made by means of the methods of starch chromatography which have recently been developed by Moore and Stein (2-6). The hydrolysates of two independently prepared samples of normal carbonmonoxyhemoglobin (to be referred to as N-Hb) and one sample of sickle-cell anemia hemoglobin (SC-Hb) have been analyzed. Approximately ten to fifteen individual determinations of each of seventeen amino acids and ammonia have been made by means of about 70 starch chromatograms."

https://openalex.org/W36800306,"Serological reactions are becoming increasingly important in the development of quantitative methods for the determination and characterization of native proteins. These reactions provide a basis for analytical methods that combine high sensitivity with a high degree of specificity. In contrast to conventional methods, which distinguish different proteins by their chemical and physical properties, serological methods reveal likeness or difference in structure. In the preceding paper, Polis, Shmukler, and Custer (1) have described the isolation of a crystalline albumin present in trace amounts in the whey of cow’s milk. They reported that this crystalline milk albumin exhibited physical and chemical properties attributable to crystalline bovine serum albumin. Our report describes the application of the Schultz-Dale (2, 3) technique to establish the identity of these two proteins. EXPERIMENTAL"

and solutions often reveal increased spectral detail of use in analytical
procedures and molecular structure studies. Nevertheless, while qualitative
observations of the influence of liquid air temperatures upon optical
properties were undertaken very early, investigations of the
absorption and fluorescence of organic compounds at the temperature
of liquid nitrogen (-195.6°; 77.4 °K.) and below have appeared only
sporadically. Because of the potential usefulness of the technique we have undertaken a systematic study of the low temperature spectra
of substances of biochemical interest. The present paper discusses the
methods employed; subsequent papers will deal with the experimental
results. In this work, we have emphasized the wave-length location of
absorption bands and the accurate determination of relative optical densities
rather than precision in the determination of absolute optical densities,
thus permitting the use of simpler methods than would otherwise be
necessary."
