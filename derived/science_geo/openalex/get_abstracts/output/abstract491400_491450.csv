https://openalex.org/W2022211348,"Translocator protein of 18 kDa (TSPO) is a highly conserved, ubiquitous protein localized in the outer mitochondrial membrane, where it is thought to play a key role in the mitochondrial transport of cholesterol, a key step in the generation of steroid hormones. However, it was first characterized as the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor because it appears to be responsible for high affinity binding of a number of benzodiazepines to non-neuronal tissues. Ensuing studies have employed natural and synthetic ligands to assess the role of TSPO function in a number of natural and pathological circumstances. Largely through the use of these compounds and biochemical associations, TSPO has been proposed to play a role in the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP), which has been associated with cell death in many human pathological conditions. Here, we critically assess the role of TSPO in the function of the PTP through the generation of mice in which the Tspo gene has been conditionally eliminated. Our results show that 1) TSPO plays no role in the regulation or structure of the PTP, 2) endogenous and synthetic ligands of TSPO do not regulate PTP activity through TSPO, 3) outer mitochondrial membrane regulation of PTP activity occurs though a mechanism that does not require TSPO, and 4) hearts lacking TSPO are as sensitive to ischemia-reperfusion injury as hearts from control mice. These results call into question a wide variety of studies implicating TSPO in a number of pathological processes through its actions on the PTP.

Structural analysis has suggested that it consists of five transmembrane α helices forming a channel-like structure that may accommodate the import of lipophilic molecules into mitochondria (1Fan J. Lindemann P. Feuilloley M.G. Papadopoulos V. Structural and functional evolution of the translocator protein (18 kDa).Curr. Mol. Med. 2012; 12: 369-386PubMed Google Scholar). The C-terminal, cytosolic domain of TSPO contains a high affinity cholesterol recognition sequence, and TSPO has been suggested to play an important role in facilitating the transport of cholesterol from the OMM to the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) (2Papadopoulos V. Miller W.L. Role of mitochondria in steroidogenesis.Best Pract. Res. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2012; 26: 771-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 3Miller W.L. Steroid hormone synthesis in mitochondria.Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2013; 379: 62-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial transport of cholesterol is necessary for its metabolization to pregnenolone (the precursor of all steroid hormones and the rate-limiting step in steroidogenesis) via the activity of cytochrome P450 cholesterol side chain cleavage enzyme (4Miller W.L. Auchus R.J. The molecular biology, biochemistry, and physiology of human steroidogenesis and its disorders.Endocr. Rev. 2011; 32: 81-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (1382) Google Scholar). TSPO is particularly abundant in cells and tissues where active steroidogenesis takes place (adrenals, gonads, and brain), and its role in steroidogenesis has been extensively investigated (2Papadopoulos V. Miller W.L. Role of mitochondria in steroidogenesis.Best Pract. Res. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2012; 26: 771-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 4Miller W.L. Auchus R.J. The molecular biology, biochemistry, and physiology of human steroidogenesis and its disorders.Endocr. Rev. 2011; 32: 81-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (1382) Google Scholar). TSPO gene disruption in Leydig cells suppressed intramitochondrial cholesterol transport and steroid production, whereas overexpression of exogenous TSPO in cells devoid of the protein induced cholesterol uptake and transport (5Papadopoulos V. Amri H. Li H. Boujrad N. Vidic B. Garnier M. Targeted disruption of the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor gene inhibits steroidogenesis in the R2C Leydig tumor cell line.J. Biol.

A second isoform of TSPO (TSPO2) has also been identified that is exclusively localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (6Fan J. Rone M.B. Papadopoulos V.

The role of TSPO in steroidogenesis has been unexpectedly challenged by conditional elimination of TSPO in Leydig cells in mice, which was not followed by the expected effects on synthesis of steroid hormones (7Morohaku K.

The identification of TSPO was through its ability to bind benzodiazepines, leading to its initial characterization as the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (8Le Fur G. Vaucher N. Perrier M.L.

U.S.A. 1987; 84: 2256-2260Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar), and these compounds have been used extensively to characterize TSPO function both in vitro and in vivo. Endogenous ligands include cholesterol and porphyrins (protoporphyrin (PP) IX, mesoporphyrin IX, deuteroporphyrin (DP) IX, and hemin), whereas synthetic ligands classically include 1-(2-chlorophenyl)-N-methyl-N-(1-methylpropyl)isoquinoline-3-carboxamide (PK11195) and 4-chlorodiazepam (Ro5-4864) (8Le Fur G. Vaucher N. Perrier M.L. Flamier A. Benavides J. Renault C. Dubroeucq M.C. Guérémy C. Uzan A.

Both endogenous and synthetic ligands exhibit nanomolar affinity for TSPO when tested in vitro, but the former bind exclusively TSPO across all species and show high levels of stereoselectivity, whereas binding of the latter differs between species (12Scarf A.M.

Med. 2012; 12: 488-493PubMed Google Scholar). The distinctive properties of the two sets of ligands suggest that their binding sites are not identical. For example, although cholesterol clearly binds to the C terminus of TSPO (13Li H. Papadopoulos V.

Forte M.A. The mitochondrial permeability transition from in vitro artifact to disease target.FEBS J. 2006; 273: 2077-2099Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). A great deal is now understood about the regulation of the PTP, whose opening requires the presence of matrix Ca2+, which is an essential permissive factor, and of additional agents or conditions that are collectively termed “inducers” (28Gunter T.E. Pfeiffer D.R. Mechanisms by which mitochondria transport calcium.Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: C755-C786Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Under the conditions used in most in vitro studies, opening of the PTP is accompanied by depolarization, Ca2+ efflux, depletion of matrix pyridine nucleotides, matrix swelling, cristae unfolding, OMM rupture, and release of intermembrane space (IMS) proteins, including cytochrome c, Smac/Diablo, and AIF (27Bernardi P. Krauskopf A. Basso E. Petronilli V. Blachly-Dyson E. Di Lisa F. Forte M.A. The mitochondrial permeability transition from in vitro artifact to disease target.FEBS J. 2006; 273: 2077-2099Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). Consequently, persistent opening of the PTP has been associated with the cell death associated with many human pathological conditions (27Bernardi P. Krauskopf A. Basso E. Petronilli V.

It has also been demonstrated that transient PTP openings without detrimental consequences on cell survival can occur both in isolated mitochondria and in situ in response to physiological signals (29Ichas F.

The permeability transition pore as a Ca2+ release channel: new answers to an old question.Cell Calcium. 2012; 52: 22-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar for a recent review). Although convincing insights into the molecular composition of the PTP have been obtained only recently (37Giorgio V. von Stockum S. Antoniel M. Fabbro A. Fogolari F. Forte M. Glick G.D. Petronilli V. Zoratti M. Szabó I. Lippe G. Bernardi P. Dimers of mitochondrial ATP synthase form the permeability transition pore.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Physiol. 2013; 4: 95Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), previous biochemical attempts to define core constituents of the pore resulted in the persistent hypothesis that key molecular constituents include the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) in the OMM, the adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT) in the IMM, and the regulatory protein cyclophilin D (CyPD) in the matrix (39Zamzami N. Kroemer G. The mitochondrion in apoptosis: how Pandora's box opens.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 67-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar). TSPO has been included in such models of the PTP because it can be co-purified with the putative pore components, VDAC and ANT (40McEnery M.W. Snowman A.M. Trifiletti R.R. Snyder S.H. Isolation of the mitochondrial benzodiazepine receptor: association with the voltage-dependent anion channel and the adenine nucleotide carrier.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1992; 89: 3170-3174Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). Involvement of TSPO in the “PTP pore complex” was also tested following treatment of mitochondria and cells with both endogenous and synthetic TSPO ligands. These studies suggested that TSPO ligands, such as PK11195, Ro5-4864, and PP IX, affect PTP opening, although the potency depended on the experimental setting and on the concentration used (varying from nanomolar to micromolar and in some cases switching from inhibition to activation) (16Pastorino J.G.

U.S.A. 1993; 90: 1374-1378Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). In addition, PK11195 was originally classified as an antagonist of TSPO, and Ro5-4864 was classified as an agonist (8Le Fur G. Vaucher N. Perrier M.L. Flamier A. Benavides J. Renault C. Dubroeucq M.C. Guérémy C. Uzan A.

Descatoire V. Sutton A. Fau D. Maulny B. Vadrot N. Feldmann G. Berthon B. Tordjmann T. Pessayre D.

The role of TSPO in PTP function was further muddled by the demonstration that the same compounds could inhibit PTP and/or protect cells from apoptosis and that individual TSPO ligands can have the opposite effect on the same cell. For example, Ro5-4864 and PK11195 can either stimulate or inhibit apoptosis, respectively, with the addition of Ro5-4864 overcoming the antiapoptotic effect of PK11195 (43Bono F. Lamarche I.

Furthermore, these studies have also clearly demonstrated that CyPD is a key regulator of the PTP and the target of the PTP-inhibitory action of cyclosporin A (CsA) but not an essential component of the pore (48Baines C.P.

https://openalex.org/W1980942602,"A new notosuchian crocodyliform from the Late Cretaceous Bauru Group found in the southeastern State of São Paulo (Brazil) is described here. The new taxon, Caipirasuchus stenognathus, is referred as a new species of the recently erected genus Caipirasuchus within the clade Sphagesauridae based on a phylogenetic analysis of basal mesoeucrocodylians. Caipirasuchus stenognathus is represented by an almost complete skull and lower jaw that has autapomorphic characters that distinguish it from other species of Sphagesauridae. These autapomorphies include: maxilla forming part of the orbital margin (absence of lacrimal-jugal contact), nasal with smooth depressions on the posterior region close to the contact with the maxilla and lacrimal, postorbital with posterior palpebral facet that extends posteriorly underneath the ear-flap groove, and a distinct anterior process of the medial flange of the retroarticular process. Additionally, the new taxon lacks autapomorphic features described in other sphagesaurids. The phylogenetic analysis results in a monophyletic genus Caipirasuchus, that is the sister group of a clade fomed by Sphagesaurus huenei, Caryonosuchus pricei, and Armadillosuchus arrudai. Sphagesaurids also include a basal clade formed by Adamantinasuchus navae and Yacarerani boliviensis. Other notosuchian taxa, such as Mariliasuchus amarali, Labidiosuchus amicum, Notosuchus terrestris, and Morrinhosuchus luziae are successive sister taxa of Sphagesauridae, forming a clade of advanced notosuchians that are restricted to the Late Cretaceous of South America. These results contrast with most previous phylogenetic hypotheses of the group that depicted some members of Sphagesauridae as more closely related to baurusuchids, or found Asian (e.g., Chimaerasuchus) or African (Malawisuchus, Pakasuchus) forms nested within advanced notosuchians that are, according to our analysis, endemic of the Late Cretaceous of South America."
https://openalex.org/W2800440062,"Fatty acid-binding proteins (FABPs) are a widely expressed group of calycins that play a well established role in solubilizing cellular fatty acids. Recent studies, however, have recast FABPs as active participants in vital lipid-signaling pathways. FABP5, like its family members, displays a promiscuous ligand binding profile, capable of interacting with numerous long chain fatty acids of varying degrees of saturation. Certain ""activating"" fatty acids induce the protein's cytoplasmic to nuclear translocation, stimulating PPARβ/δ transactivation; however, the rules that govern this process remain unknown. Using a range of structural and biochemical techniques, we show that both linoleic and arachidonic acid elicit FABP5's translocation by permitting allosteric communication between the ligand-sensing β2 loop and a tertiary nuclear localization signal within the α-helical cap of the protein. Furthermore, we show that more saturated, nonactivating fatty acids inhibit nuclear localization signal formation by destabilizing this activation loop, thus implicating FABP5 specifically in cis-bonded, polyunsaturated fatty acid signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2055591390,"Follicle-stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR), a G-protein coupled receptor, is an important drug target in the development of novel therapeutics for reproductive indications. The FSHR extracellular domains were observed in the crystal structure as a trimer, which enabled us to propose a novel model for the receptor activation mechanism. The model predicts that FSHR binds Asnα(52)-deglycosylated FSH at a 3-fold higher capacity than fully glycosylated FSH. It also predicts that, upon dissociation of the FSHR trimer into monomers, the binding of glycosylated FSH, but not deglycosylated FSH, would increase 3-fold, and that the dissociated monomers would in turn enhance FSHR binding and signaling activities by 3-fold. This study presents evidence confirming these predictions and provides crystallographic and mutagenesis data supporting the proposed model. The model also provides a mechanistic explanation to the agonist and antagonist activities of thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor autoantibodies. We conclude that FSHR exists as a functional trimer."
https://openalex.org/W2095417713,"Light exposure can influence sleep and circadian timing, both of which have been shown to influence weight regulation. The goal of this study was to evaluate the relationship between ambient light, sleep and body mass index. Participants included 54 individuals (26 males, mean age 30.6, SD = 11.7 years). Light levels, sleep midpoint and duration were measured with wrist actigraphy (Actiwatch-L) for 7 days. BMI was derived from self-reported height and weight. Caloric intake was determined from 7 days of food logs. For each participant, light and activity data were output in 2 minute epochs, smoothed using a 5 point (10 minute) moving average and then aggregated over 24 hours. The mean light timing above 500 lux (MLiT500) was defined as the average clock time of all aggregated data points above 500 lux. MLiT500 was positively correlated with BMI (r = 0.51, p<0.001), and midpoint of sleep (r = 0.47, p<0.01). In a multivariable linear regression model including MLiT500 and midpoint of sleep, MLiT500 was a significant predictor of BMI (B = 1.26 SE = 0.34, β = 0.53 p = 0.001, r2Δ = 0.22). Adjusting for covariates, MLiT500 remained an independent predictor of BMI (B = 1.28 SE = 0.36, β = 0.54, p = 0.002, r2Δ = 0.20). The full model accounted for 34.7% of the variance in BMI (p = 0.01). Exposure to moderate levels of light at biologically appropriate times can influence weight, independent of sleep timing and duration."

Enriched viral nucleic acid was converted to double-stranded DNA and subjected to Illumina MiSeq sequencing. The resulting short reads were processed with a novel iterative Python algorithm SLIM for the identification of sequences with homology to known viruses. De novo assembly was then used to generate full viral genomes. The sensitivity of this process was demonstrated with a set of fecal samples from HIV-1 infected patients. A quantitative assessment of the mammalian, plant, and bacterial virus content of this compartment was generated and the deep sequencing data were sufficient to assembly 12 complete viral genomes from 6 virus families. The method detected high levels of enteropathic viruses that are normally controlled in healthy adults, but may be involved in the pathogenesis of HIV-1 infection and will provide a powerful tool for virus detection and for analyzing changes in the fecal virome associated with HIV-1 progression and pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2009627530,"Glucocorticoids act on the glucocorticoid receptor (NR3C1) to repress inflammatory gene expression. This is central to their anti-inflammatory effectiveness and rational improvements in therapeutic index depend on understanding the mechanism. Human pulmonary epithelial A549 cells were used to study the role of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphatase, dual-specificity phosphatase 1 (DUSP1), in the dexamethasone repression of 11 inflammatory genes induced, in a MAPK-dependent manner, by interleukin-1β (IL1B). Adenoviral over-expression of DUSP1 inactivated MAPK pathways and reduced expression of all 11 inflammatory genes. IL1B rapidly induced DUSP1 expression and RNA silencing revealed a transient role in feedback inhibition of MAPKs and inflammatory gene expression. With dexamethasone, which induced DUSP1 expression, plus IL1B (co-treatment), DUSP1 expression was further enhanced. At 1 h, this was responsible for the dexamethasone inhibition of IL1B-induced MAPK activation and CXCL1 and CXCL2 mRNA expression, with a similar trend for CSF2. Whereas, CCL20 mRNA was not repressed by dexamethasone at 1 h, repression of CCL2, CXCL3, IL6, and IL8 was unaffected, and PTGS2 repression was partially affected by DUSP1 knockdown. At later times, dexamethasone repression of MAPKs was unaffected by DUSP1 silencing. Likewise, 6 h post-IL1B, dexamethasone repression of all 11 mRNAs was essentially unaffected by DUSP1 knockdown. Qualitatively similar data were obtained for CSF2, CXCL1, IL6, and IL8 release. Thus, despite general roles in feedback inhibition, DUSP1 plays a transient, often partial, role in the dexamethasone-dependent repression of certain inflammatory genes. Therefore this also illustrates key roles for DUSP1-independent effectors in mediating glucocorticoid-dependent repression."
https://openalex.org/W1992778334,"The lateral habenula (LHb) plays an important role in learning driven by negative outcomes. Many drugs of abuse, including ethanol, have dose-dependent aversive effects that act to limit intake of the drug. However, the role of the LHb in regulating ethanol intake is unknown. In the present study, we compared voluntary ethanol consumption and self-administration, yohimbine-induced reinstatement of ethanol seeking, and ethanol-induced conditioned taste aversion in rats with sham or LHb lesions. In rats given home cage access to 20% ethanol in an intermittent access two bottle choice paradigm, lesioned animals escalated their voluntary ethanol consumption more rapidly than sham-lesioned control animals and maintained higher stable rates of voluntary ethanol intake. Similarly, lesioned animals exhibited higher rates of responding for ethanol in operant self-administration sessions. In addition, LHb lesion blocked yohimbine-induced reinstatement of ethanol seeking after extinction. Finally, LHb lesion significantly attenuated an ethanol-induced conditioned taste aversion. Our results demonstrate an important role for the LHb in multiple facets of ethanol-directed behavior, and further suggest that the LHb may contribute to ethanol-directed behaviors by mediating learning driven by the aversive effects of the drug."

Here, we define Group B Streptococcus (GBS)-mediated activation of the Nod-like receptor-P3 (NLRP3) inflammasome in macrophages. NLRP3 activation requires GBS expression of the cytolytic toxin, β-hemolysin, lysosomal acidification, and leakage. These processes allow the interaction of GBS RNA with cytosolic NLRP3. The present study supports a model in which GBS RNA, along with lysosomal components including cathepsins, leaks out of lysosomes and interacts with NLRP3 to induce IL-1β production."
https://openalex.org/W1493497001,"The classical cadherin·β-catenin·α-catenin complex mediates homophilic cell-cell adhesion and mechanically couples the actin cytoskeletons of adjacent cells. Although α-catenin binds to β-catenin and to F-actin, β-catenin significantly weakens the affinity of α-catenin for F-actin. Moreover, α-catenin self-associates into homodimers that block β-catenin binding. We investigated quantitatively and structurally αE- and αN-catenin dimer formation, their interaction with β-catenin and the cadherin·β-catenin complex, and the effect of the α-catenin actin-binding domain on β-catenin association. The two α-catenin variants differ in their self-association properties: at physiological temperatures, αE-catenin homodimerizes 10× more weakly than does αN-catenin but is kinetically trapped in its oligomeric state. Both αE- and αN-catenin bind to β-catenin with a Kd of 20 nM, and this affinity is increased by an order of magnitude when cadherin is bound to β-catenin. We describe the crystal structure of a complex representing the full β-catenin·αN-catenin interface. A three-dimensional model of the cadherin·β-catenin·α-catenin complex based on these new structural data suggests mechanisms for the enhanced stability of the ternary complex. The C-terminal actin-binding domain of α-catenin has no influence on the interactions with β-catenin, arguing against models in which β-catenin weakens actin binding by stabilizing inhibitory intramolecular interactions between the actin-binding domain and the rest of α-catenin."
https://openalex.org/W1979795867,"In addition to the classical nuclear receptor pathway, there is a nongenomic pathway in the cell membrane that regulates gene expression in animal steroid hormone signaling; however, this mechanism is unclear. Here, we report that the insect steroid hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) regulates calcium influx via phospholipase Cγ1 (PLCG1) to modulate the protein kinase C phosphorylation of the transcription factor ultraspiracle (USP1) in the lepidopteran insect Helicoverpa armigera. The PLCG1 mRNA levels are increased during the molting and metamorphic stages. The depletion of PLCG1 by RNA interference can block 20E-enhanced pupation, cause larvae death and pupation defects, and repress 20E-induced gene expression. 20E may induce the tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCG1 at the cytosolic tyrosine kinase (Src) homology 2 domains and then determine the migration of PLCG1 toward the plasma membrane. The G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) inhibitor suramin, Src family kinase inhibitor PP2, and the depletions of ecdysone-responsible GPCR (ErGPCR) and Gαq restrain the 20E-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCG1. PLCG1 participates in the 20E-induced Ca(2+) influx. The inhibition of GPCR, PLC, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor, and calcium channels represses the 20E-induced Ca(2+) influx. Through calcium signaling, PLCG1 mediates the transcriptional activation driven by the ecdysone-response element. Through PLCG1 and calcium signaling, 20E regulates PKC phosphorylation of USP1 at Ser-21 to determine its ecdysone-response element binding activity. These results suggest that 20E activates PLCG1 via the ErGPCR and Src family kinases to regulate Ca(2+) influx and PKC phosphorylation of USP1 to subsequently modulate gene transcription for metamorphosis."
https://openalex.org/W2036223851,"Trichoderma reesei cellobiohydrolase I (TrCel7A) is a molecular motor that directly hydrolyzes crystalline celluloses into water-soluble cellobioses. It has recently drawn attention as a tool that could be used to convert cellulosic materials into biofuel. However, detailed mechanisms of action, including elementary reaction steps such as binding, processive hydrolysis, and dissociation, have not been thoroughly explored because of the inherent challenges associated with monitoring reactions occurring at the solid/liquid interface. The crystalline cellulose Iα and IIII were previously reported as substrates with different crystalline forms and different susceptibilities to hydrolysis by TrCel7A. In this study, we observed that different susceptibilities of cellulose Iα and IIII are highly dependent on enzyme concentration, and at nanomolar enzyme concentration, TrCel7A shows similar rates of hydrolysis against cellulose Iα and IIII. Using single-molecule fluorescence microscopy and high speed atomic force microscopy, we also determined kinetic constants of the elementary reaction steps for TrCel7A against cellulose Iα and IIII. These measurements were performed at picomolar enzyme concentration in which density of TrCel7A on crystalline cellulose was very low. Under this condition, TrCel7A displayed similar binding and dissociation rate constants for cellulose Iα and IIII and similar fractions of productive binding on cellulose Iα and IIII. Furthermore, once productively bound, TrCel7A processively hydrolyzes and moves along cellulose Iα and IIII with similar translational rates. With structural models of cellulose Iα and IIII, we propose that different susceptibilities at high TrCel7A concentration arise from surface properties of substrate, including ratio of hydrophobic surface and number of available lanes."

Here we evaluated the capability of MAL3-101, a synthetic HSP70 inhibitor, to limit proliferation and survival of various MCC cell lines. Remarkably, MAL3-101 treatment resulted in considerable apoptosis in 5 out of 7 MCC cell lines. While this effect was not associated with the viral status of the MCC cells, quantitative mRNA expression analysis of the known HSP70 isoforms revealed a significant correlation between MAL3-101 sensitivity and HSC70 expression, the most prominent isoform in all cell lines. Moreover, MAL3-101 also exhibited in vivo antitumor activity in an MCC xenograft model suggesting that this substance or related compounds are potential therapeutics for the treatment of MCC in the future."

Integrated assessments of ocean health are needed to understand the condition of a range of benefits that humans derive from marine systems and to evaluate where attention should be focused to improve the health of these systems. Here we describe the first such assessment for Brazil at both national and state levels. We applied the Ocean Health Index framework, which evaluates ten public goals for healthy oceans. Despite refinements of input data and model formulations, the national score of 60 (out of 100) was highly congruent with the previous global assessment for Brazil of 62. Variability in scores among coastal states was most striking for goals related to mariculture, protected areas, tourism, and clean waters. Extractive goals, including Food Provision, received low scores relative to habitat-related goals, such as Biodiversity. This study demonstrates the applicability of the Ocean Health Index at a regional scale, and its usefulness in highlighting existing data and knowledge gaps and identifying key policy and management recommendations. To improve Brazil's ocean health, this study suggests that future actions should focus on: enhancing fisheries management, expanding marine protected areas, and monitoring coastal habitats."
https://openalex.org/W2027005522,"Fynomers are small binding proteins derived from the human Fyn SH3 domain. Using phage display technology, Fynomers were generated inhibiting the activity of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-17A (IL-17A). One specific Fynomer called 2C1 inhibited human IL-17A in vitro with an IC50 value of 2.2 nm. Interestingly, when 2C1 was genetically fused to the Fc part of a human antibody via four different amino acid linkers to yield bivalent IL-17A binding proteins (each linker differed in length), the 2C1-Fc fusion protein with the longest linker displayed the most potent inhibitory activity. It blocked homodimeric IL-17A with an IC50 value of 21 pm, which corresponds to a hundredfold improved IC50 value as compared to the value obtained with monovalent Fynomer 2C1. In contrast, the 2C1-Fc fusion with the shortest linker showed only an ∼8-fold improved IC50 value of 260 pm. Furthermore, in a mouse model of acute inflammation, we have shown that the most potent 2C1-Fc fusion protein is able to efficiently inhibit IL-17A in vivo. With their suitable biophysical properties, Fynomer-Fc fusion proteins represent new drug candidates for the treatment of IL-17A mediated inflammatory conditions such as psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, or rheumatoid arthritis."
https://openalex.org/W2073802241,"Individual wintering strategies and patterns of winter site fidelity in successive years are highly variable among seabird species. Yet, an understanding of consistency in timing of movements and the degree of site fidelity is essential for assessing how seabird populations might be influenced by, and respond to, changing conditions on wintering grounds. To explore annual variation in migratory movements and wintering areas, we applied bird-borne geolocators on Thick-billed Murres (Uria lomvia, n = 19) and Common Murres (U. aalge, n = 20) from 5 colonies in the Northwest Atlantic for 2–4 consecutive years. Thick-billed Murres ranged widely and among-individual wintering strategies were highly variable, whereas most Common Murres wintered relatively near their colonies, with among-individual variation represented more by the relative use of inshore vs. offshore habitat. Within individuals, some aspects of the wintering strategy were more repeatable than others: colony arrival and departure dates were more consistent by individual Common than Thick-billed Murres, while the sizes of home ranges (95% utilization distributions) and distances travelled to wintering area were more repeatable for both species. In consecutive years, individual home ranges overlapped from 0–64% (Thick-billed Murres) and 0–95% (Common Murres); and the winter centroids were just 239 km and 169 km apart (respectively). Over the 3–4 year timescale of our study, individuals employed either fixed or flexible wintering strategies; although most birds showed high winter site fidelity, some shifted core ranges after 2 or 3 years. The capacity among seabird species for a combination of fidelity and flexibility, in which individuals may choose from a range of alternative strategies, deserves further, longer term attention."

The objective of this study was to elucidate the association between copy number variation (CNV) and gene expression in colorectal cancer (CRC) samples and their corresponding non-cancerous tissues. Sixty-four paired CRC samples from the same patients were subjected to CNV profiling using the Illumina HumanOmni1-Quad assay, and validation was performed using multiplex ligation probe amplification method. Genome-wide expression profiling was performed on 15 paired samples from the same group of patients using the Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST array. Significant genes obtained from both array results were then overlapped. To identify molecular pathways, the data were mapped to the KEGG database. Whole genome CNV analysis that compared primary tumor and non-cancerous epithelium revealed gains in 1638 genes and losses in 36 genes. Significant gains were mostly found in chromosome 20 at position 20q12 with a frequency of 45.31% in tumor samples. Examples of genes that were associated at this cytoband were PTPRT, EMILIN3 and CHD6. The highest number of losses was detected at chromosome 8, position 8p23.2 with 17.19% occurrence in all tumor samples. Among the genes found at this cytoband were CSMD1 and DLC1. Genome-wide expression profiling showed 709 genes to be up-regulated and 699 genes to be down-regulated in CRC compared to non-cancerous samples. Integration of these two datasets identified 56 overlapping genes, which were located in chromosomes 8, 20 and 22. MLPA confirmed that the CRC samples had the highest gains in chromosome 20 compared to the reference samples. Interpretation of the CNV data in the context of the transcriptome via integrative analyses may provide more in-depth knowledge of the genomic landscape of CRC."

Here, we investigated anti-inflammatory and proresolving actions of RvD1 after oral administration. RvD1 rapidly accumulated in the mouse plasma after oral delivery and dose-dependently (1–100 ng/mouse) reduced leukocyte infiltration in zymosan A-induced acute peritonitis. Using mathematical resolution indices, RvD1 reduced Ψmax by ~50%, shortened the resolution interval by 3 h, and significantly reduced total leukocyte (by ~30–45%) and polymorphonuclear neutrophil (by ~40–55%) accumulation when administered at the peak of peritonitis. RvD1 also improved course and outcome of severe peritonitis, shifting it toward resolution. In peritoneal macrophages (MΦs) from the resolution phase of peritonitis, RvD1 down-regulated (by 2- to 3-fold) select genes that control gene transcription, namely coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1 (CARM1), and downstream genes, such as colony-stimulating factor 3, intercellular adhesion molecule 1, and monocyte inflammatory protein 2, which promote neutrophil infiltration and reduce MΦ phagocytosis. Congruently, CARM1 knockdown in human and murine MΦs induced a proresolving phenotype, recapitulating in vivo actions of RvD1. These results establish novel properties of RvD1 and demonstrate that RvD1 modifies the transcription control machinery in MΦs, as part of its mechanisms of action during the resolution of acute inflammation.—Recchiuti, A., Codagnone, M., Pierdomenico, A.

The objectives of this study were to examine the molecular mechanisms by which embelin inhibited human pancreatic cancer cell growth in vitro, and xenografts in Balb C nude mice, and pancreatic cancer cell growth isolated from KrasG12D transgenic mice. XTT assays were performed to measure cell viability. AsPC-1 cells were injected subcutaneously into Balb c nude mice and treated with embelin. Cell proliferation and apoptosis were measured by Ki67 and TUNEL staining, respectively. The expression of Akt, and Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) and their target gene products were measured by the immunohistochemistry, and Western blot analysis. The effects of embelin on pancreatic cancer cells isolated from 10-months old KrasG12D mice were also examined. Embelin inhibited cell viability in pancreatic cancer AsPC-1, PANC-1, MIA PaCa-2 and Hs 766T cell lines, and these inhibitory effects were blocked either by constitutively active Akt or Shh protein. Embelin-treated mice showed significant inhibition in tumor growth which was associated with reduced expression of markers of cell proliferation (Ki67, PCNA and Bcl-2) and cell cycle (cyclin D1, CDK2, and CDK6), and induction of apoptosis (activation of caspase-3 and cleavage of PARP, and increased expression of Bax). In addition, embelin inhibited the expression of markers of angiogenesis (COX-2, VEGF, VEGFR, and IL-8), and metastasis (MMP-2 and MMP-9) in tumor tissues. Antitumor activity of embelin was associated with inhibition of Akt and Shh pathways in xenografts, and pancreatic cancer cells isolated from KrasG12D mice. Furthermore, embelin also inhibited epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by up-regulating E-cadherin and inhibiting the expression of Snail, Slug, and ZEB1. These data suggest that embelin can inhibit pancreatic cancer growth, angiogenesis and metastasis by suppressing Akt and Shh pathways, and can be developed for the treatment and/or prevention of pancreatic cancer."

A total of 51 tagSNPs were characterized using the Sequenom platform through multiplexed amplification followed by mass-spectrometric product separation or allelic discrimination using real-time PCR. Seven tagSNPs were implicated in CRC development: the rs689466 in COX-2 gene, the rs1346271 and rs1426945 in 15-PGDH, the rs6439448 and rs7616492 in PGT and rs1751051 and rs1751031 in MRP4 coding genes. Upon a stratified analysis a measurable gene-environment interaction was noticed between rs689466 and smoking habits, with individuals ever-smokers carriers of rs689466 GG homozygous genotype having a nearly 6-fold increased susceptibility for CRC onset (95%CI: 1.49-22.42, P = 0.011). Furthermore, the multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) analysis identified an overall four-factor best gene-gene interactive model, including the rs1426945, rs6439448, rs1751051 and rs1751031 polymorphisms. This model had the highest cross-validation consistency (10/10, P<0.0001) and an accuracy of 0.6957 and was further associated with a 5-fold increased risk for CRC development (95%CI: 3.89-7.02, P<0.0001). In conclusion, specific low penetrance genes in the pro-carcinogenic PGE2 pathway appear to modulate the genetic susceptibility for CRC development. A clearer understanding on CRC etiology through the identification of biomarkers of colorectal carcinogenesis might allow a better definition of risk models that are more likely to benefit from targeted preventive strategies to reduce CRC burden."
https://openalex.org/W1996915538,"Defects in mitochondrial genome can cause a wide range of clinical disorders, mainly neuromuscular diseases. Presently, no efficient therapeutic treatment has been developed against this class of pathologies. Because most of deleterious mitochondrial mutations are heteroplasmic, meaning that wild type and mutated forms of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) coexist in the same cell, the shift in proportion between mutant and wild type molecules could restore mitochondrial functions. Recently, we developed mitochondrial RNA vectors that can be used to address anti-replicative oligoribonucleotides into human mitochondria and thus impact heteroplasmy level in cells bearing a large deletion in mtDNA. Here, we show that this strategy can be also applied to point mutations in mtDNA. We demonstrate that specifically designed RNA molecules containing structural determinants for mitochondrial import and 20-nucleotide sequence corresponding to the mutated region of mtDNA, are able to anneal selectively to the mutated mitochondrial genomes. After being imported into mitochondria of living human cells in culture, these RNA induced a decrease of the proportion of mtDNA molecules bearing a pathogenic point mutation in the mtDNA ND5 gene."
https://openalex.org/W2002133468,"As species evolve, they become adapted to their local environments. Detecting the genetic signature of selection and connecting that to the phenotype of the organism, however, is challenging. Here we report using an integrative approach that combines DNA sequencing with structural biology analyses to assess the effect of selection on residues in the mitochondrial DNA of the two species of African elephants. We detected evidence of positive selection acting on residues in complexes I and V, and we used homology protein structure modeling to assess the effect of the biochemical properties of the selected residues on the enzyme structure. Given the role these enzymes play in oxidative phosphorylation, we propose that the selected residues may contribute to the metabolic adaptation of forest and savanna elephants to their unique habitats."
https://openalex.org/W2002477792,"High-throughput molecular analysis has become an integral part in organismal systems biology. In contrast, due to a missing systematic linkage of the data with functional and predictive theoretical models of the underlying metabolic network the understanding of the resulting complex data sets is lacking far behind. Here, we present a biomathematical method addressing this problem by using metabolomics data for the inverse calculation of a biochemical Jacobian matrix, thereby linking computer-based genome-scale metabolic reconstruction and in vivo metabolic dynamics. The incongruity of metabolome coverage by typical metabolite profiling approaches and genome-scale metabolic reconstruction was solved by the design of superpathways to define a metabolic interaction matrix. A differential biochemical Jacobian was calculated using an approach which links this metabolic interaction matrix and the covariance of metabolomics data satisfying a Lyapunov equation. The predictions of the differential Jacobian from real metabolomic data were found to be correct by testing the corresponding enzymatic activities. Moreover it is demonstrated that the predictions of the biochemical Jacobian matrix allow for the design of parameter optimization strategies for ODE-based kinetic models of the system. The presented concept combines dynamic modelling strategies with large-scale steady state profiling approaches without the explicit knowledge of individual kinetic parameters. In summary, the presented strategy allows for the identification of regulatory key processes in the biochemical network directly from metabolomics data and is a fundamental achievement for the functional interpretation of metabolomics data."
https://openalex.org/W1968969429,"Avian leukosis is a neoplastic disease caused in part by subgroup J avian leukosis virus J (ALV-J). Micro ribonucleic acids (miRNAs) play pivotal oncogenic and tumour-suppressor roles in tumour development and progression. However, little is known about the potential role of miRNAs in avian leukosis tumours. We have found a novel tumour-suppressor miRNA, gga-miR-375, associated with avian leukosis tumorigenesis by miRNA microarray in a previous report. We have also previously studied the biological function of gga-miR-375; Overexpression of gga-miR-375 significantly inhibited DF-1 cell proliferation, and significantly reduced the expression of yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) by repressing the activity of a luciferase reporter carrying the 3'-untranslated region of YAP1. This indicates that gga-miR-375 is frequently downregulated in avian leukosis by inhibiting cell proliferation through YAP1 oncogene targeting. Overexpression of gga-miR-375 markedly promoted serum starvation induced apoptosis, and there may be the reason why the tumour cycle is so long in the infected chickens. In vivo assays, gga-miR-375 was significantly downregulated in chicken livers 20 days after infection with ALV-J, and YAP1 was significantly upregulated 20 days after ALV-J infection (P<0.05). We also found that expression of cyclin E, an important regulator of cell cycle progression, was significantly upregulated (P<0.05). Drosophila inhibitor of apoptosis protein 1 (DIAP1), which is related to caspase-dependent apoptosis, was also significantly upregulated after infection. Our data suggests that gga-miR-375 may function as a tumour suppressor thereby regulating cancer cell proliferation and it plays a key role in avian leukosis tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2057169499,"The integrity of structural connectivity in a functional brain network supports the efficiency of neural processing within relevant brain regions. This study aimed to quantitatively investigate the short- and long-range fibers, and their differential roles in the lower cognitive efficiency in aging and dementia. Three groups of healthy young, healthy older adults and patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) participated in this combined functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) study on prospective memory (PM). Short- and long-range fiber tracts within the PM task engaged brain networks were generated. The correlation between the fMRI signal change, PM performance and the DTI characters were calculated. FMRI results showed that the PM-specific frontal activations in three groups were distributed hierarchically along the rostrocaudal axis in the frontal lobe. In an overall PM condition generally activated brain network among the three groups, tractography was used to generate the short-range fibers, and they were found impaired in both healthy older adults and AD patients. However, the long-range fiber tracts were only impaired in AD. Additionally, the mean diffusivity (MD) of short-range but not long-range fibers was positively correlated with fMRI signal change and negatively correlated with the efficiency of PM performance. This study suggests that the disintegrity of short-range fibers may contribute more to the lower cognitive efficiency and higher compensatory brain activation in healthy older adults and more in AD patients."
https://openalex.org/W2049910359,"Background The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF), a major pay-for-performance programme in the United Kingdom, on prescribing of long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARC) in primary care. Methods Negative binomial interrupted time series analysis using practice level prescribing data from April 2007 to March 2012. The main outcome measure was the prescribing rate of long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARC), including hormonal and non hormonal intrauterine devices and systems (IUDs and IUSs), injectable contraceptives and hormonal implants. Results Prescribing rates of Long-Acting Reversible Contraception (LARC) were stable before the introduction of contraceptive targets to the QOF and increased afterwards by 4% annually (rate ratios = 1.04, 95% CI = 1.03, 1.06). The increase in LARC prescribing was mainly driven by increases in injectables (increased by 6% annually), which was the most commonly prescribed LARC method. Of other types of LARC, the QOF indicator was associated with a step increase of 20% in implant prescribing (RR = 1.20, 95% CI = 1.09, 1.32). This change is equivalent to an additional 110 thousand women being prescribed with LARC had QOF points not been introduced. Conclusions Pay for performance incentives for contraceptive counselling in primary care with women seeking contraceptive advice has increased uptake of LARC methods."
https://openalex.org/W1979332019,"Tuberculosis is characterized by severe immunosuppression of the host macrophages, resulting in the loss of the host protective immune responses. During Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, the pathogen modulates C-C Chemokine Receptor 5 (CCR5) to enhance IL-10 production, indicating the possible involvement of CCR5 in regulation of the host immune response. Here, we found that Mycobacterium infection significantly increased CCR5 expression in macrophages there by facilitating the activation of its downstream signaling. These events culminated in up-regulation of the immunosuppressive cytokine IL-10 production, which was further associated with the down-regulation of macrophage MHC-II expression along with the up-regulation of CCR5 expression via engagement of STAT-3 in a positive feedback loop. Treatment of macrophages with CCR5 specific siRNA abrogated the IL-10 production and restored MHCII expression. While, in vivo CCR5 silencing was also effective for the restoration of host immune responses against tuberculosis. This study demonstrated that CCR5 played a very critical role for the immune subversion mechanism employed by the pathogen."

https://openalex.org/W2078696627,"When accidentally introduced in a new location, a species does not necessarily readily become invasive, but it usually needs several years to adapt to its new environment. In 2009, a national mosquito survey (MODIRISK) reported the introduction and possible establishment of an invasive mosquito species, Aedes j. japonicus, in Belgium. First collected in 2002 in the village of Natoye from a second-hand tire company, then sampled in 2003 and 2004, the presence of adults and larvae was confirmed in 2007 and 2008. A repeated cross-sectional survey of Ae. j. japonicus was then conducted in 2009 in Natoye to study the phenology of the species on two different sites using three kinds of traps: Mosquito Magnet Liberty Plus traps, BG sentinel traps and CDC Gravid traps. An analysis of the blood meals was done on females to assess the epidemiological risks. Five species of mosquitos were caught using the different kind of traps: Culex pipiens, Cx. torrentium, Anopheles claviger, Aedes geniculatus and Ae. j. japonicus, Cx. pipiens being the most abundant. The CDC gravid traps gave the best results. Surprisingly Ae. j. japonicus was only found on one site although both sites seem similar and are only distant of 2.5 km. Its population peak was reached in July. Most of the engorged mosquitoes tested acquired blood meals from humans (60%). No avian blood meals were unambiguously identified. Larvae were also collected, mostly from tires but also from buckets and from one tree hole. Only one larva was found in a puddle at 100 m of the tire storage. A first local treatment of Ae. j. japonicus larvae population was done in May 2012 using Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. israelensis (Bti) and was followed by preventive actions and public information. A monitoring is also presently implemented."
https://openalex.org/W2154775170,"Mono- and digalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG and DGDG) are the most abundant lipids of photosynthetic membranes (thylakoids). In Arabidopsis green tissues, MGD1 is the main enzyme synthesizing MGDG. This monotopic enzyme is embedded in the inner envelope membrane of chloroplasts. DGDG synthesis occurs in the outer envelope membrane. Although the suborganellar localization of MGD1 has been determined, it is still not known how the lipid/glycolipid composition influences its binding to the membrane. The existence of a topological relationship between MGD1 and “embryonic” thylakoids is also unknown. To investigate MGD1 membrane binding, we used a Langmuir membrane model allowing the tuning of both lipid composition and packing. Surprisingly, MGD1 presents a high affinity to MGDG, its product, which maintains the enzyme bound to the membrane. This positive feedback is consistent with the low level of diacylglycerol, the substrate of MGD1, in chloroplast membranes. By contrast, MGD1 is excluded from membranes highly enriched in, or made of, pure DGDG. DGDG therefore exerts a retrocontrol, which is effective on the overall synthesis of galactolipids. Previously identified activators, phosphatidic acid and phosphatidylglycerol, also play a role on MGD1 membrane binding via electrostatic interactions, compensating the exclusion triggered by DGDG. The opposite effects of MGDG and DGDG suggest a role of these lipids on the localization of MGD1 in specific domains. Consistently, MGDG induces the self-organization of MGD1 into elongated and reticulated nanostructures scaffolding the chloroplast membrane.—Sarkis, J., Rocha, J., Maniti, O., Jouhet, J., Vié, V., Block, M.

https://openalex.org/W2004638675,"βArrestin proteins shuttle between the cytosol and nucleus and have been shown to regulate G protein-coupled receptor signaling, actin remodeling, and gene expression. Here, we tested the hypothesis that βarrestin1 regulates actin remodeling and cell migration through the small GTPase Rac. Depletion of βarrestin1 promotes Rac activation, leading to the formation of multipolar protrusions and increased cell circularity, and overexpression of a dominant negative form of Rac reverses these morphological changes. Small interfering RNA library screen identifies RasGRF2 as a target of βarrestin1. RasGRF2 gene and protein expression levels are elevated following depletion of βarrestin1, and the consequent activation of Rac results in dephosphorylation of cofilin that can promote actin polymerization and formation of multipolar protrusions, thereby retarding cell migration and invasion. Together, these results suggest that βarrestin1 regulates rasgrf2 gene expression and Rac activation to affect membrane protrusion and cell migration and invasion."

HCV RNA synthesis is likely initiated de novo, a process that necessitates a single nucleotide that acts as a primer and an incoming nucleotide substrate that binds to the 3′ terminus of the RNA template (20Kao C.C.

Biochemical data have shown that the initiation complex composed of a ssRNA template and the bound nucleotides is fragile and frequently dissociates (13Liu Y. Jiang W.W. Pratt J. Rockway T. Harris K. Vasavanonda S. Tripathi R. Pithawalla R. Kati W.M. Mechanistic Study of HCV Polymerase Inhibitors at Individual Steps of the Polymerization Reaction.Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 11312-11323Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In contrast, the elongation of RNA synthesis is highly processive and the corresponding complexes with dsRNA are stable over protracted periods of time. Binding of the ssRNA template, formation of a productive initiation complex which may require sliding along the RNA template, and the transition to elongation once initiation has commenced, are three different dynamic events of which little is known. In attempts to visualize the association-dissociation dynamics of HCV-NS5B, the possible sliding and overall interaction between HCV NS5B and its RNA template in binary complexes, and the overall role of mutations and finger loop inhibitors in both dynamic processes described above, we resorted to single molecule Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (SM-FRET) (28Abbondanzieri E.A.

We found that binding of the enzyme to RNA resulted in highly dynamic binary complexes giving rise to FRET fluctuations extending to a few seconds. Mutations at positively charged residues that constitute the template entrance and the interior of the RNA binding channel decreased the FRET fluctuations. The presence of a finger loop inhibitor caused similar reductions in FRET fluctuations, while a resistant mutant enzyme preserved the fluctuating FRET trajectories under these conditions (presence of finger loop inhibitor). The combined data suggest conformational changes of HCV NS5B can translate in lateral, random motions along the ssRNA template. These findings provide novel mechanistic insight for HCV RNA synthesis and its inhibition. DNA and RNA oligonucleotides were purchased from Trilink (San Diego, CA). The coding sequence for HCV NS5B (genotype 1b, BK strain) was cloned into the bacterial expression vector pet21b. The hydrophobic region at the C terminus was removed (Δ21), and a hexa-histidine tag was introduced to facilitate protein purification (20Kao C.C. Del Vecchio A.M. Zhong W.

Mutant enzymes were generated via site-directed mutagenesis using the Stratagene QuikChange kit according to the manufacturer's protocol. Sequencing was conducted at the Genome Quebec Innovation Center. Fluorescence single molecule experiments were carried out using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM). The TIRF microscope consisted of an inverted microscope (IX71, Olympus) equipped with a laser-based TIRFM illumination module (IX2-RFAEVA-2, Olympus) coupled to a diode-pumped solid-state green laser (532 nm, CrystaLaser). The beam position was adjusted using the illuminator to attain total internal reflection through an oil-immersion objective (N.A. 1.45, Olympus PlanApo N 60×). Fluorescence emission was collected through the objective and images were captured with an EMCCD camera (CascadeII:512B, Photometrics, Roper Scientific). Emission was chromatically separated using dichroic mirrors (640dcxr, Chroma) with the Donor and Acceptor emission filtered through band pass filters (HQ590/70 M and HQ685/80M, respectively, Chroma) before being captured by the EMCCD camera. The camera was controlled using Image-Pro Plus 5.1 (Media Cybernetics), capturing 8-bit 512 × 512 pixel images with an exposure time of 200 ms, a conversion gain of 3, and multiplication gain of 4095. Excitation was carried out at a full power setting (25 milliwatt) with a power output of 6.6 milliwatt measured from the objective. Glass coverslips were functionalized with a mixture of polyethylene glycol (PEG) and biotin-PEG in order to prevent nonspecific adsorption of DNA:RNA hybrids and NS5B proteins. Following streptavidin incubation, 100 pm of annealed DNA:RNA hybrid were immobilized on PEG-coated glass coverslips via biotin-streptavidin interactions. Flow chambers were prepared with a predrilled polycarbonate film with an adhesive gasket, which was assembled on top of the PEG-treated surface, yielding a chamber with a total volume of 8 μl. Silicone ports were glued on top of the chamber. To increase Cy3 and Cy5 photostability all experiments were run under a constant flow of an oxygen scavenger solution consisting of β-mercaptoethanol 1% v/v, β-D(+)glucose 3% w/v, glucose oxidase 0.1 mg/ml, and catalase 0.02 mg/ml. Solutions were 10 mm in HEPES buffer pH 7.3 and 20 mm in NaCl with various concentrations of NS5B. All experiments were conducted at room temperature (22–23 °C). Ensemble fluorescence experiments were conducted and apparent FRET efficiencies were determined. Note that apparent FRET here is given by IA/(IA+ID)), where IA and ID are the intensities of acceptor and donor, respectively, measured at their peaks. A 200 nm solution of duplex DNA:RNA (RA20) hybrid in 10 mm HEPES and 20 mm NaCl at pH 7.3 was excited at 514 nm. Control experiments were conducted on a doubly labeled (3′Cy3, 5′Cy5) 20mer ssRNA, whose sequence is identical to the 3′ overhang in RA20 with increasing NS5B concentrations. Single molecule FRET experiments were conducted on RS20 (cytidylate terminated overhang with dye tethered to base 20 via a succinimide linker), RDS20 (cytidylate terminated overhang with internally labeled deoxycytidine (base 19)), and RA22 (adenylate terminated overhang) with 10 nm NS5B. These results were compared with those obtained with RA20. All enzymatic reactions were performed in a buffer containing 40 mm HEPES pH8, 1 mm DTT, 15 mm NaCl, and 0.5 mm EDTA. The concentration of NS5B was 1 μm while the concentration of the RNA template was 500 μm. Nucleotides were present at 100 μm with the exception of ATP, which was present at 100 nm to allow for incorporation of the radiolabeled nucleotide [α-32P]ATP, of which 1 μCi was added. Reactions were initiated with the addition of 1.25 mm MnCl2 and MgCl2 and were incubated at room temperature for 45 min. Reactions were stopped with the addition of 2× volume of formamide. Samples were heat-denatured for 5 min at 95 °C and resolved on a 20% polyacrylamide-7 m urea gel. Visualization of product bands was performed using a phosphorimager (Bio-Rad Molecular Imager FX). For studies involving the inhibitor, concentrations up to 25 μm were tested. To study the interaction dynamics of HCV NS5B with its ssRNA template, we designed a FRET assay that relies on nucleic acid substrates containing both acceptor and donor fluorophores. This approach helps to bypass technical difficulties in obtaining homogenously labeled enzyme at sufficient yields. The nucleic acid is composed of an 18 base pair DNA:RNA hybrid duplex and a ssRNA overhang that provides the binding site for NS5B (Fig. 2a). We devised RNA templates of varying sequence, length (Fig. 2b), and structure (Fig. 2c), that were labeled with a donor Cy3 fluorophore at the 3′-end unless otherwise stated. Dye functionalization strategies were surveyed to ensure that little or no perturbation to the donor fluorophore resulted from the labeling position/chemistry utilized. The various different functionalizations did not introduce any differences in our single molecule results (see Fig. 3 and also text below). An acceptor Cy5 fluorophore was attached at the 5′-end of the complementary DNA strand, at the junction of the DNA:RNA hybrid and the ssRNA template overhang. The DNA strand also bears a biotin at the 3′-end, enabling immobilization of the hybrid duplex onto a polyethyleneglycol-coated glass coverslip via biotin-streptavidin interactions (Fig. 2d). Assembled flow chambers allowed delivery of NS5B enzyme to its immobilized substrate.FIGURE 3Chemical structure of the various dye conjugates utilized, Cy3 appears in green and Cy5 in red. Conjugate a utilized in RAn is an internal Cy3 tethered to the phosphate backbone (internal amidite). Conjugate b utilized in RS20 is a cytidylate terminated 3′ overhang with Cy3 tethered to the phosphate at position 3′ of the ribose via a succinimide linker. Conjugate c (a deoxycytidine internally labeled) is utilized in RDS20. d corresponds to the biotin conjugation at the 3′-end of the DNA strand, and e corresponds to the Cy5 conjugate at the 5′-end of the DNA strand.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) With our design, we intended to monitor potential FRET fluctuations between the Cy3 dye and the Cy5 dye upon binding of purified HCV NS5B. We additionally expected to follow dynamics (sliding and/or wrapping) of the enzyme along the RNA template by monitoring once again FRET fluctuations over time for binary-RNA complexes. Single DNA:RNA duplexes were visualized on a CCD camera following excitation of the Cy3 tag with a 532 nm evanescent field generated in a total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscope setup (34Roy R. Hohng S. Ha T. A practical guide to single-molecule FRET.Nature Methods. 2008; 5: 507-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (1494) Google Scholar). Fluorescence intensity time trajectories of single DNA:RNA duplexes were acquired for periods of up to 300 s, or until acceptor photobleaching occurred. FRET time trajectories and associated single molecule FRET distributions were calculated for all molecules under a given set of conditions. The collection of individual FRET time trajectories was used next to construct ensemble FRET distributions. We initially monitored the effects of the addition of NS5B to 14, 20, and 26 base-long ssRNA templates that are represented by the 3′ RNA overhang region of the nucleic acid. In the absence of enzyme, we observed decreasing average FRET values for RAn sequences with increasing overhang length n. Such a result is expected, given the increasing number of bases separating the donor and acceptor dyes, and, in turn, the increasing conformational flexibility (37Murphy M.C. Rasnik I. Cheng W. Lohman T.M. Ha T. Probing Single-Stranded DNA Conformational Flexibility Using Fluorescence Spectroscopy.Biophys. J. 2004; 86: 2530-2537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). Experiments recorded with 10 nm NS5B showed a marked increase of the average FRET from 0.40 to 0.50 for RA26, and from 0.50 to 0.75 for RA20, while only a broadening of the FRET distribution was recorded for RA14 with increasing concentrations of NS5B (<FRET> ∼0.70) (Fig. 4, a–c). The increase in FRET efficiency shows that binding of NS5B to the RNA overhang reduces the distance between donor and acceptor (see also “Discussion”). Ensemble fluorescence experiments performed with either the DNA:RNA duplex bearing the ssRNA overhang (RA20) or with a 20mer ssRNA of identical sequence to the overhang section in RA20, showed similar FRET changes (Fig. 5, a and b and text therein). We therefore rule out that the 18 base pair DNA:RNA duplex segment contributes to NS5B binding. These observations are consistent with the reported narrow binding tunnel associated with the closed conformation of NS5B, which is unable to accommodate a double stranded segment (7Lohmann V. Körner F. Herian U. Bartenschlager R.

To confirm the assignment of an increase in FRET to enzyme binding events we performed a single molecule experiment where we started imaging single RA20 strands immediately before enzyme addition and continued monitoring through the arrival of HCV NS5B. As can be observed in Fig. 6a, the FRET value increased, within one data point, from a value of 0.50 before to ca. 0.70 after the arrival of HCV NS5B. This is also reflected in the two peaks recorded for the single molecule FRET distribution and displayed in Fig. 6b. The lower FRET peak resulting from the period before protein arrival, the higher FRET one arising from the period recorded following protein arrival and until photobleaching of the acceptor dye. Similar trajectories were recorded for all the molecules imaged, resulting in the ensemble FRET distribution displayed in Fig. 6c. To determine whether one or multiple proteins are bound to the RNA template we conducted single molecule experiments with increasing NS5B concentrations up to 1 μm. Fig. 4d displays ensemble FRET distribution results for RA20. At 5 nm NS5B (Fig. 4d, the histogram in cyan), we observed a bimodal distribution arising from two different populations. Of the 255 trajectories analyzed, 8 molecules (∼3% of the population) were observed displaying FRET values of 0.50, which is consistent with the FRET values of free substrates. 232 molecules (∼91%) were recorded with FRET values of 0.75, which is indicative for a binary NS5B-RNA complex. We further detected rapid (within two consecutive data points) increases in FRET values from 0.50 to 0.75 in 3 molecules and an equivalent decrease in 10 molecules (∼5%), and we were able to see both a drop and increase in FRET only in 2 molecules (<1%) (see also next section for traces with increase and decrease in intensity). We assign the FRET increase and decrease to NS5B association and dissociation events, respectively (see previous paragraph). At 10 nm NS5B concentrations, a single population of molecules was observed with high FRET values stable over time and typically centered at ∼0.75 that we assign to the dominant presence of a binary NS5B-RNA complex involving a single protein bound to the 3′ RNA overhang. Under these conditions most molecules display a narr"

However, in very nutrient-poor ecosystems, enhanced N input can, in the short-term, promote diversity. Mediterranean Basin ecosystems are nutrient-limited biodiversity hotspots, but no information is available on their medium- or long-term responses to enhanced N input. Since 2007, we have been manipulating the form and dose of available N in a Mediterranean Basin maquis in south-western Europe that has low ambient N deposition (<4 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)) and low soil N content (0.1%). N availability was modified by the addition of 40 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) as a 1∶1 NH4Cl to (NH4)2SO4 mixture, and 40 and 80 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) as NH4NO3. Over the following 5 years, the impacts on plant composition and diversity (richness and evenness) and some ecosystem characteristics (soil extractable N and organic matter, aboveground biomass and % of bare soil) were assessed. Plant species richness increased with enhanced N input and was more related to ammonium than to nitrate. Exposure to 40 kg NH4+-N ha(-1) yr(-1) (alone and with nitrate) enhanced plant richness, but did not increase aboveground biomass; soil extractable N even increased under 80 kg NH4NO3-N ha(-1) yr(-1) and the % of bare soil increased under 40 kg NH4+-N ha(-1) yr(-1). The treatment containing less ammonium, 40 kg NH4NO3-N ha(-1) yr(-1), did not enhance plant diversity but promoted aboveground biomass and reduced the % of bare soil. Data suggest that enhanced NHy availability affects the structure of the maquis, which may promote soil erosion and N leakage, whereas enhanced NOx availability leads to biomass accumulation which may increase the fire risk. These observations are relevant for land use management in biodiverse and fragmented ecosystems such as the maquis, especially in conservation areas."

Blood samples were collected before the series of treatments and after 10, 20 and 30 treatments. After 10 and 20 treatments we observed lower red blood cell counts and hematocrit and hemoglobin levels compared to baseline (p<0.05) and the control group (p<0.05). Additionally we observed an increase in hemoglobin concentration in plasma (p<0.05), and bilirubin after 10 and 20 treatments, and a decrease in plasma concentration of haptoglobin after 10, 20 and 30 treatments (p<0.05). The number of leukocytes was higher after 10 and 20 WBC treatments compared to baseline and the CON group. EPO concentration in plasma was elevated and the concentration of IL-3 was lower after 10, 20 and 30 WBC treatments. The decrease in indices of the erythrocytic system, plasma hemoglobin and bilirubin, with a simultaneous decrease in haptoglobin concentrations after 10 and 20 WBC treatments, may be due to increased intravascular hemolysis. At the same time there was a small, but statistically significant increase in the concentration of EPO stimulated erythropoiesis which could facilitate a return of erythrocytic system indices to initial levels after 30 WBC treatments. Changes in the white blood cell system showed transient mobilization of this system under the influence of WBC."

Nonmammalian cartilage has also been studied as a potential source of angiogenesis inhibitors. Lee and Langer were the first to demonstrate that an extract of shark cartilage could significantly inhibit tumor neovascularization (14Lee A. Langer R. Shark cartilage contains inhibitors of tumor angiogenesis.Science. 1983; 221: 1185-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Since then, several laboratories have isolated partially purified fractions from this type of cartilage which have been shown to inhibit at least one of the processes associated with angiogenesis. For example, U995, a fraction containing 10- and 14-kDa peptides isolated from the blue shark, Prionace glauca, interfered with human umbilical vein endothelial cell proliferation and migration (15Sheu J.R. Fu C.C. Tsai M.L. Chung W.J.

SCF2, a glycosaminoglycan whose principal component is keratan sulfate, is a 10-kDa proteoglycan that has been reported to inhibit EC proliferation in vitro, as well as tumor-induced angiogenesis in the cornea of rabbits and angiogenesis in CAM assays in vivo (1Liang J.H. Wong K.P. The characterization of angiogenesis inhibitor from shark cartilage.Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2000; 476: 209-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). SCAIF80, an 80-kDa protein isolated from shark cartilage, has been shown to significantly suppress EC proliferation and migration in a dose-dependent matter in vitro (16Shen X.R. Ji D.M. Hu Y.Q. Jia F.X. Wang L. Chu Z.Y. Ren D.M. SCAIF80, a novel inhibitor of angiogenesis, and its effect on tumor growth.Sheng Wu Hua Xue Yu Sheng Wu Wu Li Xue Bao. 2001; 33: 99-104PubMed Google Scholar), and SCP1, a 13.7-kDa protein with sequence similarities to parvalbumin, was reported to inhibit angiogenesis in the rat aortic ring assay (17Rabbani-Chadegani A.

Matrix proteinase inhibition by AE-941, a multifunctional antiangiogenic compound.Anticancer Res. 2001; 21: 145-155PubMed Google Scholar) isolated from Squalus acanthias cartilage, has been shown to inhibit angiogenesis in vitro in the rat aortic ring vessel assay (19Béliveau R.

Metastasis. 2002; 19: 145-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In addition, the shark tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 3 (sTIMP-3), has been cloned and characterized from the cloudy dogfish, Scyliorhinus torazame (21Kim J.T. Kim M.S. Bae M.K. Song H.S. Ahn M.Y. Kim Y.J. Lee S.J. Kim K.W. Cloning and characterization of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-3 (TIMP-3) from shark, Scyliorhinus torazame.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1517: 311-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). It was later shown to inhibit migration and tube formation in bovine aortic endothelial cells (22Kang J.A. Kim J.T. Song H.S.

Having demonstrated its ability to inhibit angiogenesis in vivo, we determined that MATN-1 exerted this suppression of neovascularization by inhibiting angiogenesis growth factor-driven capillary endothelial cell proliferation and migration. These studies were supported by both in vitro gain-of-function studies and in vivo loss-of-function experiments using MATN-1 KO mice. MATN-1, formerly known as cartilage matrix protein, is an abundant component of cartilage (23Paulsson M. Heinegård D. Radioimmunoassay of the 148-kilodalton cartilage protein: distribution of the protein among bovine tissues.Biochem. J. 1982; 207: 207-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). A modular protein, MATN-1 mediates interactions between a variety of matrix components (24Neame P.J. Tapp H. Azizan A. Noncollagenous, nonproteoglycan macromolecules of cartilage.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 1327-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and, as a structural protein, it binds to biglycan and decorin (25Wiberg C. Klatt A.R. Wagener R. Paulsson M. Bateman J.F.

To our knowledge, this report is the first to document the ability of this structural protein to suppress new capillary growth in vivo and suggests that its targeting may be of potential clinical significance. The chondrocranium cartilage of the spiny dogfish (S. acanthias) was harvested and scraped free of muscle and connective tissue as described previously (4Moses M.A. Sudhalter J. Langer R. Identification of an inhibitor of neovascularization from cartilage.Science. 1990; 248: 1408-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar, 14Lee A. Langer R. Shark cartilage contains inhibitors of tumor angiogenesis.Science. 1983; 221: 1185-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The prepared cartilage (250 g) was homogenized and extracted in 4 liters of a 2 m NaCl, 0.01 m HEPES, 3 mm EDTA, 0.02% NaN3 extraction buffer for 4 days under constant agitation, utilizing a modification of a previous procedure (4Moses M.A. Sudhalter J. Langer R. Identification of an inhibitor of neovascularization from cartilage.Science. 1990; 248: 1408-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). The extraction solution was filtered with gauze, centrifuged at 6500 × g for 2 h to remove particulates, then concentrated using a Vivacell 250 (Sartorius Stedim Biotech) to a final volume of ∼5 ml. The concentrated cartilage extract had a final protein concentration of 7.8 mg/ml. All procedures were performed at 4 °C. A 40-mg sample of concentrated cartilage extract, dialyzed against Bio-Gel A-1.5m buffer (4 m guanidine HCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.6) (Bio-Rad 151-0450, per manufacturer's instructions) overnight, was applied to a Bio-Gel A-1.5m Sepharose size exclusion column (5 × 50) at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min; fractions were collected every 5 min. Fractions were screened for their ability to inhibit both EC proliferation and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity (Fig. 1A). Given that cartilage had already been reported to contain an antiangiogenic activity that was identified as being an MMP inhibitor (4Moses M.A. Sudhalter J. Langer R. Identification of an inhibitor of neovascularization from cartilage.Science. 1990; 248: 1408-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar), fractions were screened for both of these activities to identify a novel inhibitor of neovascularization. Fractions 22–34 from the column were enriched in the ability to inhibit EC proliferation and were pooled, dialyzed overnight to remove the guanidine HCl, and then applied to a Bio-Rex 70 column (Bio-Rad) and fractionated, as previously described by us (4Moses M.A. Sudhalter J. Langer R. Identification of an inhibitor of neovascularization from cartilage.Science. 1990; 248: 1408-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Fractions 2 and 5 (Fig. 1B), which contained the antiproliferative activity, were pooled and dialyzed to remove excess salts, then subjected to electrophoresis on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad) or 12% Bis-Tris NU-PAGE gels (Invitrogen) run under denaturing conditions followed by visualization by either silver or SYPRO Ruby (Invitrogen) staining (29Roy R. Louis G. Loughlin K.R. Wiederschain D. Kilroy S.M. Lamb C.C. Zurakowski D.

Cancer Res. 2008; 14: 6610-6617Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Protein bands were excised from the gel, subjected to tryptic digestion, and analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (Perceptive STR, Applied Biosystems) to determine the molecular masses of the proteins and for peptide mapping of the tryptic digests using a 337-nm wavelength laser for desorption and the reflectron mode of analysis. Using the MSFit and SEQUEST (30MacCoss M.J. Wu C.C. Yates 3rd, J.R. Probability-based validation of protein identifications using a modified SEQUEST algorithm.Anal. Chem. 2002; 74: 5593-5599Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar) search programs, the peptide maps generated were searched against a FASTA database of public domain proteins constructed of protein entries in the nonredundant database held by the NCBI and Swiss Protein Database. Peptide matches identified by MSFit were filtered according to their MOWSE (molecular mass search) score, percentage of masses matched, molecular mass, and number of observations of peptides and proteins. The cMATN-1 gene was cloned using a pcDNA3.1 vector with cMATN-1 insert (31Zhang Y. Chen Q. Changes of matrilin forms during endochondral ossification: molecular basis of oligomeric assembly.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32628-32634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and primers specific for the mature form of chick MATN-1. The human MATN-1 (hMATN-1) gene was cloned from normal adult human lung and trachea first strand cDNA (Biochain Institute, Inc., Hayward, CA). For the cloning of both the chick and human MATN-1 into the pPICZαC expression plasmid, the cDNAs for MATN-1 were amplified by PCR using two primers that covered the translation start codon (primer 1) and the stop codon (primer 2) of cartilage matrix protein cDNA, respectively. The two primers were designed in such a way that primer 1 contained a XhoI site and primer 2 contained a polyhistidine tag (to aid in purification) and a XbaI site (for hMATN-1, primer 1, 5′-CCGCTCGAGATGAGGGTCCTCTCTGGCA-3′; primer 2, 5′-GCTCTAGATCAATGATGATGATGATGATGTTAGACAACTGTGTTC-3′; for cMATN-1, primer 1, 5′-CCGCTCGAGAAAAGACCTCCTCAGCCCAGAGG-3′; primer 2, 5′-GCTCTAGATCAATGATGATGATGATGATGGATGATCTTATTCTC-3′). The full-length MATN-1 PCR products were subcloned into pCR4-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). After confirmation of the sequence, the MATN-1 genes were ligated into the yeast expression vector pPICZαC (Invitrogen). Linearized vectors (PmeI) were electroporated into the yeast Pichia pastoris for expression (Invitrogen), and integrants were selected by culturing on YPDS (2% peptone, 1% yeast extract, 2% glucose, 1 m sorbitol, 2% agar) plates with 100 μg/ml zeocin (Invitrogen) for 3 days. Successful insertion of chick and human genes of interest into the Pichia genome were verified by PCR using Pichia-specific primers, which also verified that recombination occurred at the correct site. Expression of the gene of interest is under the control of the methanol-inducible AOX1 promoter. Five Pichia clones each of cMATN-1 and hMATN-1 were tested for their expression levels and the clones from each set expressing the highest amount of protein were chosen for subsequent studies. The expression conditions were as follows: 25-ml overnight cultures were grown at 30 °C in yeast extract peptone dextrose medium (YPD, 1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% dextrose) containing 100 μg/ml zeocin. Cell pellets were collected after 24 h by centrifugation at 1500 × g. Cultures were induced to express the recombinant proteins by resuspending the cell pellets in 250 ml of buffered methanol-complex medium (BMMY, 2% peptone, 1% yeast extract, 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.0, 1.34% yeast nitrogenous base, 1% methanol) and allowed to grow for 24 h at 30 °C with constant shaking. Medium containing the secreted expressed protein was cleared of cell content by centrifugation at 5000 × g. Expressed recombinant chicken and human MATN-1 proteins were initially purified from the yeast media using histidine affinity binding to a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose resin (Qiagen) under native conditions. Expressed protein in 800 ml of pooled, cleared medium was allowed to bind to 5 ml of resin in a prepacked column by gravity flow at 4 °C. The resin was washed with 50 ml (10 volumes) of buffer containing 10 mm imidazole (50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, pH 8.0) to reduce nonspecific binding. Protein was then eluted using 25 ml (5 volumes) of elution buffer containing 100 mm imidazole (50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 100 mm imidazole, pH 8.0) and concentrated by centrifugation using membrane concentrators with 10-kDa molecular mass cutoff (Centriprep, Amicon, Beverly, MA). Purity was confirmed by silver staining of SDS-polyacrylamide gels and tandem mass spectrometry. Capillary ECs, isolated from bovine adrenal cortex, were a kind gift from Dr. Judah Folkman and Catherine Butterfield (Boston Children's Hospital). Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Invitrogen) containing 10% calf serum (HyClone) and 3 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) in 10% CO2 at 37 °C, as previously reported (4Moses M.A. Sudhalter J. Langer R. Identification of an inhibitor of neovascularization from cartilage.Science. 1990; 248: 1408-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar).

Briefly, capillary ECs were plated on pregelatinized 96-well plates at a density of 2000 cells/well in DMEM supplemented with 5% calf serum and allowed to attach for 24 h. The next day, cells were treated with fresh medium with or without 1 ng/ml bFGF and challenged with the test proteins at various concentrations. All samples were tested in duplicate. Control wells contained cell treated with medium alone or medium with bFGF. After 72 h, the medium was removed, and the cells were lysed in buffer containing Triton X-100 and the phosphatase substrate p-nitrophenyl phosphate. After a 2-h incubation at 37 °C, NaOH was added to each well to terminate the reaction, and cell density was determined by colorimetric analysis using a SpectraMax 190 multiwell plate reader (Molecular Devices). All samples were tested in duplicate in at least three independent experiments. Capillary EC migration was studied using a modified Boyden chamber as previously described (4Moses M.A. Sudhalter J.

The upper half of Transwell (8-μm pore; Costar) membranes were coated with fibronectin (10 μg/ml; BD Biosciences) overnight at 4 °C to facilitate cell adhesion. Coated membranes were rinsed with PBS and allowed to air dry immediately before use. Cells were detached by trypsinization and resuspended at a final concentration of 0.5 × 106 cells/ml in serum-free DMEM containing 0.1% BSA. Cells were added to the upper chamber of the Transwell and allowed to migrate toward the bottom chamber containing DMEM, or DMEM supplemented with the chemoattractant bFGF for 4 h in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2. Transwell filters were rinsed once with PBS and fixed and stained using a Diff-Quik kit (Baxter) following the manufacturer's protocol. Stained filters were cut out of the chamber and mounted onto slides using Permount (Sigma). The number of migrated cells were counted (three fields from each membrane were captured using a 10× objective), and images were captured with a CCD camera using SPOT software. Total migration/membrane was quantified from the captured images using Scion Image software (National Institutes of Health). All experiments were run in triplicate. MMP inhibitory activity was assessed using a quantitative [C14]collagen film assay, as described previously (4Moses M.A. Sudhalter J. Langer R.

Three-day-old chick embryos were removed from their shells and incubated in plastic Petri dishes for 3 days. On embryonic day 6, samples and controls were mixed into methylcellulose and allowed to dry. The discs were applied to the surfaces of developing CAMs, above the dense subectodermal plexus. After an incubation of 48 h, the eggs were examined for vascular reactions under a dissecting scope and photographed. All samples were tested in triplicate for each treatment. Animals were studied at Coro Center Facilities of Rhode Island Hospital. National Institutes of Health guidelines for the care and use of animals were observed, and the study was approved by Rhode Island Hospital IACUC. Six- to 8-week-old male mice were used in the experiments. MATN-1−/− (n = 5) mice and WT mice (n = 5) of the same genetic background (C57BL/6J) were genotyped using PCR. The animals were used to create fracture models as described previously (1Liang J.H. Wong K.P. The characterization of angiogenesis inhibitor from shark cartilage.Adv. Exp. Med.

In brief, animals were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of a ketamine (Bioniche Pharma) and medetomidine (Orion Corporation, Espoo, Finland) mixture (75 ±1 mg/kg). The animals were prepared for surgery by shaving and scrubbing of both hind limbs. A longitudinal short incision was made at the knee, and a 0.5-mm hole was drilled above the tibial tuberosity. A 30-gauge stainless-steel needle (Hamilton, Reno, NV) was introduced into the intramedullary canal of the tibia. The wound was closed, and the procedure was repeated on the contralateral side.

Hgf treatment stimulates the selective association of active Gsk3 with Lrp5/6. In contrast, Akt-phosphorylated inactive Gsk3 is excluded from this association. Hgf stimulates β-catenin stabilization and nuclear accumulation and protects against epithelial cell apoptosis in an Lrp5/6-dependent fashion. In vivo, the increase in Lrp5/6 phosphorylation and β-catenin stabilization in the first 6–24 h after renal ischemic injury was significantly reduced in mice lacking Met receptor in the renal proximal tubule.

Cell confluence regulates hepatocyte growth factor-stimulated cell morphogenesis in a β-catenin-dependent manner.Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 26: 9232-9243Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), the mechanism by which Gsk3 is inhibited as a result of Wnt signaling is still under debate. The conventional hypothesis suggests that Gsk3 is directly inhibited by the C terminus of Lrp5/6 (11Mi K. Dolan P.J. Johnson G.V. The low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 6 interacts with glycogen synthase kinase 3 and attenuates activity.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 4787-4794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) while a more recent study suggests that Gsk3 is sequestered into multi-vesicular bodies and hence prevented from phosphorylating (and degrading) β-catenin (12Taelman V.F. Dobrowolski R. Plouhinec J.L. Fuentealba L.C. Vorwald P.P. Gumper I. Sabatini D.D. De Robertis E.M. Wnt signaling requires sequestration of glycogen synthase kinase 3 inside multivesicular endosomes.Cell. 2010; 143: 1136-1148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). β-catenin activates gene transcription leading to various cellular processes including epithelial cell survival and morphologic changes. A critical early event in canonical Wnt signaling is the phosphorylation of the highly homologous Wnt co-receptors Lrp5 and 6. The intracellular domain (ICD) of Lrp 6 consists of five PPS/TP repeats (S1490, T1530, T1572, S1590, S1607) juxtaposed with sites phosphorylated by casein kinase-1 (CK1). Together these sites are called PPSPXS motifs, and they are highly conserved among species and between the Lrp5 and 6 proteins (13Niehrs C. Shen J. Regulation of Lrp6 phosphorylation.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2010; 67: 2551-2562Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). It has been shown that these motifs act synergistically to initiate downstream Wnt signaling and that phosphorylation of one site alone is not enough (14MacDonald B.T. Yokota C. Tamai K. Zeng X. He X. Wnt signal amplification via activity, cooperativity, and regulation of multiple intracellular PPPSP motifs in the Wnt co-receptor LRP6.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 16115-16123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Lrp6 phosphorylation can be mediated by multiple kinases depending on the activating stimulus and cellular context (13Niehrs C. Shen J. Regulation of Lrp6 phosphorylation.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2010; 67: 2551-2562Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Zeng et al. identified Gsk3 and casein kinase 1 (CK1) as dual kinases that mediate Wnt-dependent Lrp6 phosphorylation (15Zeng X. Tamai K. Doble B. Li S. Huang H. Habas R. Okamura H. Woodgett J. He X. A dual-kinase mechanism for Wnt co-receptor phosphorylation and activation.Nature. 2005; 438: 873-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). They showed that different cellular pools of Gsk3 exist with an active membrane pool that stimulates Lrp6 phosphorylation, and a cytosolic pool that is subsequently inhibited to prevent β-catenin phosphorylation and ubiquitination. In addition to Gsk3 and CK1, G protein-coupled receptor kinases (Grk5/6) have also been shown to phosphorylate PPS/TPXS motifs in a Wnt-dependent fashion (16Chen M. Philipp M. Wang J. Premont R.T. Garrison T.R. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Chen W. G Protein-coupled receptor kinases phosphorylate LRP6 in the Wnt pathway.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 35040-35048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), while protein kinase A (PKA) and PFTAIRE protein kinase 1 (Pftk1) can phosphorylate these motifs in a Wnt-independent fashion (17Wan M. Yang C. Li J. Wu X. Yuan H. Ma H. He X. Nie S. Chang C. Cao X.

Cell. 2009; 17: 788-799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Recently, mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) have also been shown to phosphorylate Lrp6 following fibroblast growth factor (Fgf) stimulation. (19ervenka I. Wolf J. Mašek J. Krejci P. Wilcox W.R. Kozubík A. Schulte G. Gutkind J.S. Bryja V. Mitogen-activated protein kinases promote WNT/β-catenin signaling via phosphorylation of LRP6.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2011; 31: 179-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated that Hgf stimulation of subconfluent renal TECs leads to Akt-mediated inhibition of Gsk3 (10Ishibe S. Haydu J.E. Togawa A. Marlier A. Cantley L.G. Cell confluence regulates hepatocyte growth factor-stimulated cell morphogenesis in a β-catenin-dependent manner.Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 26: 9232-9243Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In the current study, we further investigated the cross-talk between these pathways and its significance. Our data show that Hgf stimulates Lrp5/6 phosphorylation at three activation sites in a Wnt-independent manner. This phosphorylation is mediated by Gsk3 utilizing a previously unidentified mechanism in which active Gsk3 is selectively recruited to Lrp5/6. This phosphorylation leads to β-catenin stabilization and nuclear accumulation, and is required for the anti-apoptotic effects of Hgf. Consistent with these in vitro findings, in vivo studies show that there is a Met-dependent increase in Lrp5/6 phosphorylation and β-catenin stabilization after renal ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury in mice. Our results highlight a novel mechanism of Hgf-dependent transactivation of canonical Wnt signaling that identifies a Wnt-independent pathway for in vitro and in vivo Lrp5/6 activation.

Antibodies to phospho-Lrp6 Thr-1572 and Ser-1607 were obtained from Millipore, while anti-phospho-Gsk3-β-Tyr-216 and anti-E-cadherin antibodies were from BD Biosciences. Recombinant mouse Wnt3a and Dickkopf-related protein 1 (Dkk-1) were purchased from R&D Systems. Recombinant human HGF and lithium chloride were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. The Gsk-3 inhibitor BIO IX and Met kinase inhibitor-II were purchased from Calbiochem. Met inhibitor PHA-665752 and Gsk3 inhibitor CHIR-99021 were purchased from Selleck Chemicals. For Western blotting after immunoprecipitation experiments, light-chain-specific anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibodies were obtained from Jackson Immunoresearch. For all other experiments secondary antibodies were purchased from Invitrogen. EDTA-free protease and phosphatase inhibitor mixture was obtained from Thermo Scientific. Cells were counted using a hemocytometer. Low, medium and high confluency cells were plated at 2.1 × 103/cm2, 4.2 × 104/cm2, and 4.2 × 105 cells/cm2, respectively. Experiments were performed 24 h after plating (cell morphology as shown in Fig. 2A). Cells were serum starved for 24 h, followed by Hgf (40 ng/ml) or Wnt3a (50 ng/ml) stimulation for the indicated time. Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-Hcl, 150 mm NaCl, 1.0% deoxycholic acid, 0.1% SDS, 1.0% Triton X-100, and 2 mm EDTA), insoluble material removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant protein content determined using the Bradford assay. For co-immunoprecipitation experiments, cell were lysed in Nonidet P-40 buffer (50 mm Tris-Hcl, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 1% Nonidet P-40) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors, pre-cleared with protein G-PLUS or protein A-agarose beads (1:1 slurry in PBS; Santa Cruz) for 45 min. 0.5–1.0 mg of cell lysate was immunoprecipitated with the appropriate antibody overnight, washed ×3 in ice-cold Nonidet P-40 buffer and precipitated proteins separated using 7.5–10% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), electrophoretically transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore), immunoblotted with the appropriate antibody overnight, and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) or West Femto Maximum Sensitivity Substrate (Thermo Scientific). Quantification of ECL signals was performed using NIH Image J software. For protein lysates from mice, kidneys were harvested at 6 and 24 h after IRI surgery and immediately flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Tissue was homogenized in RIPA buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors using a Dounce homogenizer while being kept on ice (4 °C) throughout. MPT cells were lysed and total RNA isolated using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen Valencia, CA). One microgram of RNA was reverse transcribed using random hexamer primers (SuperScript II, Invitrogen), and PCR was performed using REDTaq DNA Polymerase (Sigma) followed by visualization of amplified DNA through agarose gel electrophoresis. Cells were trypsinized, washed with ice-cold PBS, centrifuged, and the manufacturer's protocol (NE-PER Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction Reagents, Thermo Scientific) was followed. Fresh protease and phosphatase inhibitors were added to the manufacturer's reagents. The cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts were analyzed by Western blot. To induce apoptosis, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) at 250 mm concentration (22Liu J. Wang Y. Du W. Liu W. Liu F. Zhang L. Zhang M. Hou M. Liu K. Zhang S. Yu B. Wnt1 inhibits hydrogen peroxide-induced apoptosis in mouse cardiac stem cells.PloS one. 2013; 8: e58883Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) in serum-free media was added to the cells after 90 min of stimulation with either vehicle or Hgf. Cells were cultured for 2 h followed by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining based on the manufacturer's protocol (Roche). Briefly the cells were washed, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, and stained. TUNEL-positive cells were imaged using a Nikon microscopy system and counted in eight randomly selected fields per well at ×40. Results are expressed as the percentage of total (DAPI-positive) cells counted that were apoptotic (TUNEL-positive). An average of the 10 fields per condition in three experiments was used for quantification. Lentivirus containing shRNA against the Lrp5 and 6 proteins and control (scrambled) shRNA were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. MPT cells were plated on 48-well dishes 1 day before infection. Polybrene (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 5 μg/ml and lentivirus particles were added into FBS/antibiotic-free DMEM and left for overnight culture. A concentration of 100 infectious units (IFU) of virus per cell was used. On day 2 following transduction, the medium was replaced with DMEM supplemented with FBS and 10 μg/ml of puromycin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Untransduced dead cells were removed on day 3, and live cells were further expanded and maintained to generate stable cell lines. Metfl/fl mice (23Huh C.G. Factor V.M. Sánchez A. Uchida K.

Nephrol. 2014; 25: 329-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Sham animals underwent midline ventral incision without clamping. The mice were sacrificed after 6 h or 1 day for kidney harvest. All mouse experiments were conducted under a protocol approved by the Yale IACUC. The data between two groups were compared using the Student's two-tailed t test. Significance was determined at p < 0.05, and the error bars represent standard deviations. Treatment of non-confluent cultured MPT cells with Hgf (40 ng/ml) for 10 min lead to activation of the Met receptor and an approximately 2-fold increase in phosphorylation of Lrp6 at Ser-1490, with no change in the total amount of Lrp5 and -6 (Fig. 1A, quantification in Fig. 1B). The phosphorylation peaked within 5–10 min of stimulation and declined over the next 60 min (Fig. 1C). Similarly, Met activation resulted in phosphorylation of Lrp6 at Thr-1572 and Ser-1607 (Fig. 1D, quantified in E) at this early time point. Of note, PCR revealed that MPT cells express the mRNA for both Lrp5 and Lrp6 (data not shown), and the commercial antibodies used do not distinguish between the phosphorylated forms of the two proteins. Individual knockdown of Lrp6 or Lrp5 suggests that the homologous phosphorylation motifs on the Lrp5 protein (Ser-1502, Thr-1577, and Ser-1608) are also activated by Hgf (data not shown). As expected, treatment of MPT cells with Wnt3a (50 ng/ml for 10 min) induced phosphorylation of these same motifs on Lrp6 (Fig. 1F). Our in vivo data have shown that renal collecting duct cells also express high levels of the Met receptor (25Ishibe S. Karihaloo A. Ma H. Zhang J. Marlier A. Mitobe M. Togawa A. Schmitt R. Czyczk J. Kashgarian M. Geller D.S. Thorgeirsson S.S. Cantley L.G. Met and the epidermal growth factor receptor act cooperatively to regulate final nephron number and maintain collecting duct morphology.Development. 2009; 136: 337-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Similar to MPT cells, Hgf stimulation of collecting duct derived mIMCD-3 cells induced Lrp5/6 phosphorylation within 10 min (Fig. 1G). We have previously shown that both Hgf signaling and expression of epithelial differentiation markers are regulated by cell confluency (10Ishibe S. Haydu J.E. Togawa A. Marlier A. Cantley L.G. Cell confluence regulates hepatocyte growth factor-stimulated cell morphogenesis in a β-catenin-dependent manner.Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 26: 9232-9243Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 26Hader C. Marlier A. Cantley L. Mesenchymal-epithelial transition in epithelial response to injury: the role of Foxc2.Oncogene. 2010; 29: 1031-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). To determine the impact of confluency on Hgf-stimulated phosphorylation of Lrp5/6, MPT cells were plated at low, medium, and high confluency (representative images in Fig. 2A). At low confluency the cells express low levels of E-cadherin and Lrp6, but respond in a robust fashion to Hgf with Met activation, Erk activation and Lrp6 phosphorylation at Ser-1490 (Fig. 2B, quantified in C). At medium confluency, both total Lrp5/6 expression and phosphorylation are increased in unstimulated cells, with no significant increase in the ratio of phosphorylated Lrp5/6 to total Lrp5/6 following Hgf stimulation. At high confluency Hgf-stimulated Met activation and signaling were completely suppressed, with no change in Lrp5/6 phosphorylation. Hgf-mediated phosphorylation of Lrp6 at Thr-1572 and Ser-1607 demonstrate a similar confluency-dependent pattern (Fig. 2D). These findings, coupled with our previous demonstration that Hgf-mediated inhibition of cytosolic Gsk3 occurs only in subconfluent cells (10Ishibe S. Haydu J.E. Togawa A. Marlier A. Cantley L.G. Cell confluence regulates hepatocyte growth factor-stimulated cell morphogenesis in a β-catenin-dependent manner.Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 26: 9232-9243Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), suggest that Hgf/Met signaling specifically transactivates Wnt signaling in low confluency, de-differentiated epithelial cells, reminiscent of sub-lethally injured cells after AKI. This pathway is apparently suppressed as cells become more differentiated and confluent, resembling the healthy, uninjured epithelial cells of the renal tubule. Subsequent cell-based experiments were performed under low confluency conditions. The rapid increase in Lrp5/6 phosphorylation following Hgf stimulation suggested that Wnt expression/secretion may not be required for this pathway of Lrp5/6 activation. To confirm this, serum starved MPT cells were incubated with the extracellular Wnt-antagonist Dickkopf-1 (Dkk-1, 0.1 μg/ml) followed by stimulation with Hgf or Wnt3a. Treatment with exogenous Wnt3a resulted in the expected increase in Lrp5/6 phosphorylation, with Dkk-1 pretreatment inhibiting this effect by ∼70% (Fig. 3A, quantified in B). In contrast, Hgf-stimulated Lrp5/6 phosphorylation was not inhibited by Dkk-1 (Fig. 3A, quantified in B). Of note, incubation of control cells with Dkk-1 resulted in a modest but significant decrease in basal Lrp5/6 phosphorylation. To determine if Hgf-stimulated Lrp5/6 phosphorylation required activation of the Met receptor, MPT cells were preincubated with the specific Met kinase inhibitor PHA-665752 (0.2 μm) followed by stimulation with Hgf. Met inhibition reduced Hgf-stimulated Lrp6 phosphorylation at Ser-1490, Thr-1572, and Ser-1607 by greater than 90% (Fig. 3, C–F). These findings were reproduced with a separate Met inhibitor, Met inhibitor-II (0.5 μm, data not shown) and demonstrate that Hgf stimulation of Lrp5/6 is Wnt-independent and requires activation of the Met receptor. We subsequently proceeded to define the mechanism of this phosphorylation. We did not detect co-immunoprecipitation of Met with Lrp5/6. In light of the evidence that Gsk3 can phosphorylate Lrp5/6 (15Zeng X. Tamai K. Doble B. Li S. Huang H. Habas R. Okamura H. Woodgett J. He X. A dual-kinase mechanism for Wnt co-receptor phosphorylation and activation.Nature. 2005; 438: 873-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar), MPT cells were stimulated with Hgf ± pre-incubation with the specific Gsk3 inhibitor BioIX (27Sato N. Meijer L. Skaltsounis L. Greengard P. Brivanlou A.H. Maintenance of pluripotency in human and mouse embryonic stem cells through activation of Wnt signaling by a pharmacological GSK-3-specific inhibitor.Nature Med. 2004; 10: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1728) Google Scholar). Hgf-stimulated Lrp6 phosphorylation at Ser-1490 was inhibited by BIO IX (Fig. 4A, quantified in B) in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4C). BioIX also reduced the basal phosphorylation of Lrp5/6 by ∼25% (Fig. 4, A, C, quantified in B). This is similar to the effect seen with Dkk-1 (Fig. 3A), and consistent with the possibility that MPT cells express a Wnt ligand that weakly activates Gsk3-dependent Lrp5/6 phosphorylation at baseline. Taking into account the inhibition of basal phosphorylation, there was an 80% decrease in the Hgf-stimulated phosphorylation of Lrp5/6 following BIO IX treatment (10 μm). To confirm that Hgf-mediated phosphorylation of Lrp5/6 was dependent on active Gsk3, two other Gsk3 inhibitors, CHIR-99021 and lithium chloride (LiCl), were tested and also found to inhibit Hgf-stimulated phosphorylation of Ser-1490 in a dose-dependent fashion (data not shown). Gsk3 inhibition also reduced Hgf-dependent Lrp6 phosphorylation at Thr-1572 and Ser-1607 to a comparable degree (data not shown). Gsk3 is believed to be constitutively active, with substrate specificity regulated by both phosphorylation and cellular compartmentalization. Activation of Gsk3 can occur via Src family kinase phosphorylation of Gsk3β at tyrosine 216 (28Hartigan J.A. Xiong W.C. Johnson G.V.

In contrast, stimulation with Hgf has been shown to inhibit Gsk3 via PI3K/Akt dependent phosphorylation at serine 9 (10Ishibe S. Haydu J.E. Togawa A. Marlier A. Cantley L.G.

Hemmings B.A. Inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3 by insulin mediated by protein kinase B.Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4364) Google Scholar). Neither of these sites are thought to be utilized during canonical Wnt signaling (31Ding V.W. Chen R.H. McCormick F.

Examination of the phosphorylation state of Gsk3 in whole cell lysates confirmed that inhibitory phosphorylation at serine 9 was significantly increased by Hgf whereas activating phosphorylation of Gsk3β at Tyr-216 and Gsk3α at Tyr-279 was unchanged (Fig. 4D).

These experiments revealed basal association of Lrp5/6 and Gsk3, with a significant increase in association following stimulation with Hgf (Fig. 4E, quantified in F). Surprisingly, despite the increase in serine 9 phosphorylation of Gsk3 detected in Hgf-stimulated whole cell lysates, there was no detectable serine 9 phosphorylated Gsk3 found in Hgf-stimulated Lrp5/6 immunoprecipitates.

Because homocysteine (Hcy) metabolic imbalance is considered a risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases, we investigated whether maternal Vitamin B deficiency during early development alters the offspring's methionine-homocysteine metabolism in their brain. To this end, the dams were submitted to experimental diet one month before and during pregnancy or pregnancy/lactation. After birth, the offspring were organized into the following groups: control (CT), deficient diet during pregnancy and lactation (DPL) and deficient diet during pregnancy (DP). The mice were euthanized at various stages of development. Hcy, cysteine, glutathione (GSH), S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), folate and cobalamin concentrations were measured in the plasma and/or brain. At postnatal day (PND) 0, total brain of female and male offspring exhibited decreased SAM/SAH ratios. Moreover, at PND 28, we observed decreased GSH/GSSG ratios in both females and males in the DPL group. Exposure to a Vitamin B-deficient diet during the ontogenic plasticity period had a negative impact on plasma folate and brain cortex SAM concentrations in aged DPL males. We also observed decreased plasma GSH concentrations in both DP and DPL males (PND 210). Additionally, this manipulation seemed to affect the female and male offspring differently. The decreased plasma GSH concentration may reflect redox changes in tissues and the decreased brain cortex SAM may be involved in changes of gene expression, which could contribute to neurodegenerative diseases over the long term."
https://openalex.org/W2320466941,"Efficient therapeutics and early detection has helped to increase breast cancer survival rates over the years. However, the recurrence of breast cancer remains to be a problem and this may be due to the presence of a small population of cells, called tumor initiating cells (TICs). Breast TICs are resistant to drugs, difficult to detect, and exhibit high self-renewal capabilities. In this study, layer by layer (LBL) small interfering RNA (siRNA) nanovectors (SNVs) were designed to target breast TICs. SNVs were fabricated using alternating layers of poly-L-lysine and siRNA molecules on gold (Au) nanoparticle (NP) surfaces. The stability, cell uptake, and release profile for SNVs were examined. In addition, SNVs reduced TIC-related STAT3 expression levels, CD44+/CD24-/EpCAM+ surface marker levels and the number of mammospheres formed compared to the standard transfection agent. The data from this study show, for the first time, that SNVs in LBL assembly effectively delivers STAT3 siRNA and inhibit the growth of breast TICs in vitro."

The cytoplasmic tail of β-integrin (PAT-3) is associated with a conserved four-protein complex that includes UNC-112 (kindlin), PAT-4 (integrin-linked kinase), PAT-6 (α-parvin/actopaxin), and UNC-97 (PINCH). The proper localization of UNC-112 to muscle integrin adhesion sites requires PAT-4. A recent report (Qadota, H., Moerman, D. G., and Benian, G. M.

Chem. 287, 28537–28551) suggests a possible molecular mechanism for this requirement: that UNC-112 exists in closed inactive and open active conformations, and conversion to the open active form is promoted by binding to PAT-4 (ILK). Previously, we also reported identification of a single missense mutation in UNC-112, D382V, which abolishes both binding to PAT-4 and normal localization to integrin adhesion sites in vivo. In this report, we describe isolation and characterization of PAT-4 missense mutations that permit binding with UNC-112 D382V and place nine affected residues on a homology model of PAT-4. These nine residues cluster in two regions on the surface of PAT-4, do not overlap the likely binding surface for PAT-6 (α-parvin), and therefore may reside along the interaction surface of PAT-4 for UNC-112 (kindlin). We also show that one of these PAT-4 mutations restores the ability of UNC-112 D382V to localize to integrin adhesions and participate in complex formation. Caenorhabditis elegans striated muscle cells attach to basement membrane and transmit the force of muscle contraction through integrin adhesion complexes.

Chem. 287, 28537–28551) suggests a possible molecular mechanism for this requirement: that UNC-112 exists in closed inactive and open active conformations, and conversion to the open active form is promoted by binding to PAT-4 (ILK). Previously, we also reported identification of a single missense mutation in UNC-112, D382V, which abolishes both binding to PAT-4 and normal localization to integrin adhesion sites in vivo. In this report, we describe isolation and characterization of PAT-4 missense mutations that permit binding with UNC-112 D382V and place nine affected residues on a homology model of PAT-4. These nine residues cluster in two regions on the surface of PAT-4, do not overlap the likely binding surface for PAT-6 (α-parvin), and therefore may reside along the interaction surface of PAT-4 for UNC-112 (kindlin). We also show that one of these PAT-4 mutations restores the ability of UNC-112 D382V to localize to integrin adhesions and participate in complex formation."

This report examines the effect of cholecystokinin (CCK) on plasma cholesterol level and intestinal cholesterol absorption using the in vivo models of C57BL/6 wild-type and low density lipoprotein receptor knock-out (LDLR−/−) mice. These data were supported by in vitro studies involving mouse primary intestinal epithelial cells and human Caco-2 cells; both express CCK receptor 1 and 2 (CCK1R and CCK2R). We found that intravenous injection of [Thr28,Nle31]CCK increased plasma cholesterol levels and intestinal cholesterol absorption in both wild-type and LDLR−/− mice. Treatment of mouse primary intestinal epithelial cells with [Thr28,Nle31]CCK increased cholesterol absorption, whereas selective inhibition of CCK1R and CCK2R with antagonists attenuated CCK-induced cholesterol absorption. In Caco-2 cells, CCK enhanced CCK1R/CCK2R heterodimerization. Knockdown of both CCK1R and CCK2 or either one of them diminished CCK-induced cholesterol absorption to the same extent. CCK also increased cell surface-associated NPC1L1 (Niemann-Pick C1-like 1) transporters but did not alter their total protein expression. Inhibition or knockdown of NPC1L1 attenuated CCK-induced cholesterol absorption. CCK enhanced phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and Akt phosphorylation and augmented the interaction between NPC1L1 and Rab11a (Rab-GTPase-11a), whereas knockdown of CCK receptors or inhibition of G protein βγ dimer (Gβγ) diminished CCK-induced PI3K and Akt phosphorylation. Inhibition of PI3K and Akt or knockdown of PI3K diminished CCK-induced NPC1L1-Rab11a interaction and cholesterol absorption. Knockdown of Rab11a suppressed CCK-induced NPC1L1 translocation and cholesterol absorption. These data imply that CCK enhances cholesterol absorption by activation of a pathway involving CCK1R/CCK2R, Gβγ, PI3K, Akt, Rab11a, and NPC1L.

https://openalex.org/W2047005446,"Rhodopsin undergoes rearrangements of its transmembrane helices after photon absorption to transfer a light signal to the G-protein transducin. To investigate the mechanism by which rhodopsin adopts the transducin-activating conformation, the local environmental changes in the transmembrane region were probed using the cysteine S-H group, whose stretching frequency is well isolated from the other protein vibrational modes. The S-H stretching modes of cysteine residues introduced into Helix III, which contains several key residues for the helical movements, and of native cysteine residues were measured by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. This method was applied to metarhodopsin IIa, a precursor of the transducin-activating state in which the intramolecular interactions are likely to produce a state ready for helical movements. No environmental change was observed near the ionic lock between Arg-135 in Helix III and Glu-247 in Helix VI that maintains the inactive conformation. Rather, the cysteine residues that showed environmental changes were located around the chromophore, Ala-164, His-211, and Phe-261. These findings imply that the hydrogen bond between Helix III and Helix V involving Glu-122 and His-211 and the hydrophobic packing between Helix III and Helix VI involving Gly-121, Leu-125, Phe-261, and Trp-265 are altered before the helical rearrangement leading toward the active conformation."
https://openalex.org/W2066392888,"Retinal detachment is the physical separation of the retina from the retinal pigment epithelium. It occurs during aging, trauma, or during a variety of retinal disorders such as age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, retinopathy of prematurity, or as a complication following cataract surgery. This report investigates the role of fibulin 2, an extracellular component, in retinal detachment. A major mechanism for detachment resolution is enhancement of cellular adhesion between the retina and the retinal pigment epithelium and prevention of its cellular migration. This report shows that fibulin 2 is mainly present in the retinal pigment epithelium, Bruch membrane, choriocapillary, and to a lesser degree in the retina. In vitro studies revealed the presence of two isoforms for fibulin 2. The small isoform is located inside the cell, and the large isoform is present inside and outside the cells. Furthermore, fibulin 2 is post-translationally modified by tyrosine sulfation, and the sulfated isoform is present outside the cell, whereas the unsulfated pool is internally located. Interestingly, sulfated fibulin 2 significantly reduced the rate of cellular growth and migration. Finally, levels of fibulin 2 dramatically increased in the retinal pigment epithelium following retinal detachment, suggesting a direct role for fibulin 2 in the re-attachment of the retina to the retinal pigment epithelium. Understanding the role of fibulin 2 in enhancing retinal attachment is likely to help improve the current therapies or allow the development of new strategies for the treatment of this sight-threatening condition."
https://openalex.org/W1989978481,"In this paper, we present algorithms to find near-optimal sets of epidemic spreaders in complex networks. We extend the notion of local-centrality, a centrality measure previously shown to correspond with a node's ability to spread an epidemic, to sets of nodes by introducing combinatorial local centrality. Though we prove that finding a set of nodes that maximizes this new measure is NP-hard, good approximations are available. We show that a strictly greedy approach obtains the best approximation ratio unless P = NP and then formulate a modified version of this approach that leverages qualities of the network to achieve a faster runtime while maintaining this theoretical guarantee. We perform an experimental evaluation on samples from several different network structures which demonstrate that our algorithm maximizes combinatorial local centrality and consistently chooses the most effective set of nodes to spread infection under the SIR model, relative to selecting the top nodes using many common centrality measures. We also demonstrate that the optimized algorithm we develop scales effectively."
https://openalex.org/W2033010289,"This work is the first attempt to quantify the overall effects of a 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) vaccination programme in the Dutch population taking into account all the direct and indirect effects of the vaccine on invasive pneumococcal disease. Using available Dutch data, a dynamic transmission model for the spread of pneumococci and potential subsequent invasive pneumococcal disease has been adapted to the Dutch setting. Overall, invasive pneumococcal disease cases in the Netherlands are predicted to decrease from a pre-vaccination level of 2623 cases annually to 2475, 2289, 2185, 2179, and 2178 cases annually 5-, 10-, 20-, 30-, and 40-years, respectively, post-vaccination. Therefore, vaccination with PCV13 in the Netherlands is predicted to lower invasive pneumococcal disease cases per year by up to 445 cases in the medium- to long-term. The results are quite robust for the sensitivity analyses performed on the parameters that regulate herd immunity and competition between vaccine and non-vaccine types."
https://openalex.org/W1969264613,"The telomere capping protein TRF1 is a component of the multiprotein complex “shelterin,” which organizes the telomere into a high order structure. Besides telomere maintenance, telomere-associated proteins also have nontelomeric functions. For example, tankyrase 1 and TRF1 are required for the maintenance of faithful mitotic progression. However, the functional relevance of their centrosomal localization has not been established. Here, we report the identification of a TRF1-binding protein, TAP68, that interacts with TRF1 in mitotic cells. TAP68 contains two coiled-coil domains and a structural maintenance of chromosome motifs and co-localizes with TRF1 to telomeres during interphase. Immediately after nuclear envelope breakdown, TAP68 translocates toward the spindle poles followed by TRF1. Dissociation of TAP68 from the telomere is concurrent with the Nek2A-dependent phosphorylation at Thr-221. Biochemical characterization demonstrated that the first coiled-coil domain of TAP68 binds and recruits TRF1 to the centrosome.

Although significant divergence has occurred in these proteins across species, there are also extensive levels of conservation. For example, in fission yeast, duplex telomeric DNA repeats are bound by Taz1p, a homologue of the human telomeric repeat binding factor proteins (7Cooper J.P. Nimmo E.R. Allshire R.C. Cech T.R.

Interestingly, the chromatin association of TRF1 is regulated by key mitotic kinase PLK1 during mitosis (12Nishiyama A. Muraki K. Saito M. Ohsumi K. Kishimoto T. Ishikawa F.

Two related poly(ADP)-ribose polymerases that were originally identified as TRF1-interacting proteins, tankyrase 1 and 2, inhibit the binding of TRF1 to telomeres (14Smith S. de Lange T. Tankyrase promotes telomere elongation in human cells.Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1299-1302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Tankyrase 1 and 2 are nearly identical in amino acid sequence and form homo- and heterodimers, suggesting that they are functionally similar (15Riffell J.L. Lord C.J. Ashworth A. Tankyrase-targeted therapeutics: expanding opportunities in the PARP family.Nat. Rev. Drug. Discov. 2012; 11: 923-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). In addition to their telomeric functions, telomere-associated proteins also have nontelomeric functions. For example, TRF1 expression correlates with stem cell pluripotency (16Schneider R.P.

The spindle pole localization of TRF1 has been reported more than 10 years ago (4Nakamura M. Zhou X.Z. Kishi S. Kosugi I. Tsutsui Y. Lu K.P.

Later, it was reported that TRF1 interacts with spindle assembly checkpoint protein Mad1 and key mitotic kinase NEK2A (NIMA-related kinase 2) (18Prime G. Markie D.

Tankyrase localizes to mitotic spindle poles during mitosis and is required for normal spindle formation and sister chromatid segregation through as yet unclear mechanisms (25Chang P. Coughlin M. Mitchison T.J. Tankyrase-1 polymerization of poly(ADP-ribose) is required for spindle structure and function.Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 1133-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). In addition, poly(ADP-ribose) is required for spindle assembly and structure (26Chang P. Jacobson M.K. Mitchison T.J.

Similar to TRF1, the function of tankyrase 1 is also regulated by PLK1 (Polo-like kinase 1)-mediated phosphorylation (28Ha G.H. Kim H.S. Go H. Lee H. Seimiya H. Chung D.H. Lee C.W.

Centrosome is the major microtubule organization center and is essential for the correct assembly of bipolar spindle in animal cells. Aberrations in the number and structure of the centrosome lead to genomic instability and have been characterized in a variety of solid tumors as well as leukemias and lymphomas (29Nigg E.A.

Although the mitotic role of TRF1 is well established, the mechanism by which TRF1 and its complex is recruited and tethered to the centrosome in vertebrates is unknown. In this study, we aimed to assess the mechanism by which the telomere-associated proteins regulate chromosome stability using a proteomic analysis to isolate TRF1-interacting proteins during mitosis. A protein of unknown function was identified and was designated as TAP68 (TRF1-associated protein of 68 kDa). Biochemical analysis demonstrated the direct interaction between TRF1 and TAP68. These two proteins co-localize on telomere in interphase and at mitotic spindle poles in mitosis. The spindle pole localization of TRF1 depends on TAP68. We further demonstrated that phosphorylation of TAP68 at residues Thr-221 and Thr-457 by kinase NEK2A and PLK1 coordinates TRF1 translocation from telomere to spindle pole. Together, our data reveal TAP68 plays a regulatory role in TRF1 localization to centrosomes and uncover the novel mechanism of telomeric protein in the regulation of accurate mitotic progression.

All MALDI spectra were externally calibrated using a standard peptide mixture (Sigma). Some post-source decay spectra were acquired on a TofSpec SE MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Micromass, Manchester, UK).

The coding region of TAP68 was isolated from a human testis cDNA library (BD Biosciences) using temperature-gradient PCR with the following primers: sense, 5′-CCCGATCTGCTCAACTTCAA-3′, and antisense, 5′-CTACTCAGCCAGGCTGTTGC-3′. The thermo-cycling conditions were as follows: 1 cycle at 95 °C for 3 min; 30 cycles at 94 °C for 45 s, 50–62 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 90 s; and 1 cycle at 72 °C for 10 min. The candidate fragment was cloned into the pMD18-T vector (Takara Biotechnology, Dalian, China) and completely sequenced. The clone with the correct insert was utilized as the template for PCR amplification with the high fidelity DNA polymerase, Pyrobest (Takara Biotechnology), and the target fragment was inserted into pEGFP-C2 by blunt-end cloning (BD Biosciences). All plasmid constructs were sequenced for verification. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried using a standard PCR technique. Both TRF1 and TAP68 coding regions were found to be identical to the sequences detected in NCBI GenBankTM (accession numbers U40705 and NM_007032, respectively). The anti-TAP68 antibody was generated after immunization of two rabbits with purified His-tagged TAP68 protein. The rabbit IgG fraction was purified using affinity beads coupled with full-length TAP68 protein as described previously (33Yao X. Anderson K.L. Cleveland D.W. The microtubule-dependent motor centromere-associated protein E (CENP-E) is an integral component of kinetochore corona fibers that link centromeres to spindle microtubules.J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 435-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). In some cases, mouse IgG from TAP68-immunized mice was used for immunofluorescence and Western blot analyses. The specificity of the TAP68 antibodies was verified using Western blot analysis of HeLa cell lysates. The other antibodies used in this study were as follows: rabbit polyclonal anti-TRF1 antibodies (Novus Biologicals, Inc.); Cy5-conjugated NuMA antibody (Novus Biologicals, Inc.); mouse monoclonal anti-γ-tubulin (TUB2.1; Cy5-conjugated; Sigma); β-tubulin GTU-88 antibodies (Sigma); mouse monoclonal anti-GFP antibody (BD Biosciences); anti-tankyrase 1 antibody (BD Biosciences); anti-FLAG M2 gel and mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP; Sigma); HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody and Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA); FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch); rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Both the His-tagged wild-type and phosphomutant TAP68 proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLys and purified as described previously (34Zhou R. Guo Z. Watson C. Chen E. Kong R. Wang W. Yao X. Polarized distribution of IQGAP proteins in gastric parietal cells and their roles in regulated epithelial cell secretion.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1097-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The fusion proteins bound to nickel beads were suspended in phosphorylation buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgSO4, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm EGTA) prior to use. To verify whether Thr-221 is a substrate for NEK2A or Thr-457 is a substrate for PLK1, 2 μg of purified His-TAP68 fusion proteins, both wild-type and mutants, were incubated with 1 unit of active Nek2A or PLK1 (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) in kinase buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μm ATP, and 5 μCi of [32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in a total volume of 30 μl. Kinase reactions were carried out at 30 °C for 30 min and terminated by the addition of 10 μl of 4× SDS-PAGE sample buffer and separated by 6–16% gradient SDS-PAGE. The gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, dried, and quantified using a PhosphorImager (GE Healthcare). For immunofluorescence, HeLa cells were grown onto sterile, acid-treated 18-mm coverslips in 24-well plates (Corning Glass, Corning, NY) and maintained in DMEM with 10% FBS until nearly 80% confluence. Cells were rinsed for 1 min with PHEM buffer (100 mm PIPES, 20 mm HEPES, pH 6.9, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, and 4 m glycerol) and permeabilized for 1 min with PHEM plus 0.2% Triton X-100 as described previously (33Yao X. Anderson K.L. Cleveland D.W. The microtubule-dependent motor centromere-associated protein E (CENP-E) is an integral component of kinetochore corona fibers that link centromeres to spindle microtubules.J.

Aurora B kinase activation requires survivin priming phosphorylation by PLK1.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2011; 3: 260-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Extracted cells were then fixed in freshly prepared 4% paraformaldehyde plus 0.05% glutaraldehyde in PHEM and rinsed three times in PBS. After the cells were blocked with 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS (TPBS) containing 1% BSA, they were incubated with various primary antibodies in a humidified chamber for 1 h followed by three washes to remove unbound antibody. Monoclonal antibodies bound to γ-tubulin and β-tubulin were visualized using rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). DNA was stained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, Sigma). Slides were examined with an Axiovert-200 fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss, Göttingen, Germany) with a ×63 1.40 NA PlanApo objective, and the images were captured by AxioVision 3.0 software and analyzed with Image-5 (Carl Zeiss). For co-immunoprecipitation experiments, the FLAG-tagged TRF1 construct was co-transfected with GFP-tagged TAP68 constructs or GFP vector alone (20 μg/dish) into human 293T cells using calcium phosphate. After 4 h, fresh medium was added. The cells were detached from the dishes by flushing with cold PBS 36 h after transfection, harvested by centrifugation, and lysed in pre-cooled lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin). After incubation for 30 min on a shaker at 4 °C, detergent-insoluble debris was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min. Cell lysates were further treated with λ-phosphatase (New England Biolabs) for 30 min at 30 °C after incubation and centrifugation at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C for 15 min. Cleared lysates were transferred to a new tube and incubated on a rocking platform at 4 °C for 4 h with either 10 μl of FLAG-M2-coupled agarose beads or 10 μl of protein A/G coupled with 10 μg of anti-GFP antibody. After the beads were washed three times with lysis buffer and two times with PBS, proteins were eluted with 50 μl of Laemmli loading buffer and resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE. Separated proteins were subsequently transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane for Western blot analysis with either GFP or FLAG monoclonal antibodies. The siRNA sequence used for silencing TAP68 corresponds to the coding region 336–354 (relative to the start codon). As a control, either a duplex targeting cyclophilin or scrambled sequence was used (36Lou Y. Yao J. Zereshki A. Dou Z. Ahmed K. Wang H. Hu J. Wang Y. Yao X. NEK2A interacts with MAD1 and possibly functions as a novel integrator of the spindle checkpoint signaling.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20049-20057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The 21-mer oligonucleotide RNA duplexes were synthesized by Dharmacon Research, Inc. (Boulder, CO). Double thymidine synchronized cells were transfected with siRNA oligonucleotides using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen). The efficiency of the siRNA oligonucleotide on TAP68 protein knockdown was assessed by Western blot analysis after 48–72 h. 2 × 106 interphase HeLa cells were used and incubated with 10× v/v of microtubule-stabilizing buffer (PEM buffer) solutions, which contained 5 mm PIPES, pH 7.2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm NaCl, 1 mm PMSF, 2 mg/ml aprotinin, 2 mg/ml pepstatin A, 2 mg/ml leupeptin, at room temperature for 5 min and centrifuged at 2500 × g for 2 min to collect the cells. Cell pellets were re-dissolved in pre-cold 4 °C hypotonic solutions (PEM buffer plus 0.1% digitonin) (Sigma) and sonicated for four bursts at setting level 2 for 5 s each in a 4 °C ice bath with a BILON92 sonicator (Shanghai Bilon Instruments Co. Ltd., Shanghai, China) and sonicated on ice for four bursts of 5 s each by using a probe-tip sonicator BILON92. The homogenates were further centrifuged at 4 °C, 15,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatants (cytoplasm portion) and cell pellets (nuclei portion) were transferred separately to pre-cooling Eppendorf tubes and ready for further Western blot assay. For immunoelectron microscopy, HeLa cells were grown onto sterile, acid-treated 18-mm coverslips in 6-well plates (Corning Glass, Corning, NY) and maintained in DMEM with 10% FBS until nearly 75% confluent. After removing the medium, cells were washed for 1 min with PHEM buffer (100 mm PIPES, 20 mm HEPES, pH 6.9, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 4 m glycerol) and then incubated with PHEM buffer containing 1% digitonin to perforate the cell membrane for 5 min at room temperature. The extracted cells were pre-fixed in a freshly prepared 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.05% glutaraldehyde PHEM buffer for 10 min and rinsed with PBS three times for 5 min each. After blocking with PBST (0.05% Tween 20 in phosphate saline buffer, PBS) containing 1% BSA, cells were incubated with primary anti-TAP68 antibody at room temperature for 1 h. After washing three times with PBST for 3 min each, cells were incubated with colloidal gold particles conjugated with secondary antibody at room temperature for 1 h. Cells were fixed with 1% glutaraldehyde in PBS for 20 min and washed three times again with PBS. These cells were then treated with 2% osmium tetroxide for 30 min and dehydrated through graded ethanols (10, 20, 40, 60, and 80% and two times at 100%, 5 min in each) and 100% acetone (three times) over 10 min. Cells were then detached from the coverslips and embedded in acetone-Epon 812 (Sigma) overnight at 30 °C. After ultrathin sections were prepared, they were stained with lead acetate uranium and examined and photographed using a transmission electron microscope (JEOL 1200, Peabody, MA). All experiments were performed at least three times or more. The percentages of mitotic cells in bipolar, tripolar, and tetrapolar spindles were presented as means ± S.D. The independent t test was performed to compare the differences of percentage of mitotic cells in bipolar, tripolar, and tetrapolar spindles between the cells treated with TAP68 siRNA and control siRNA. Statistical analysis was considered significant when the two-sided p value was <0.05, using SPSS 15.0 statistics software (SPSS Inc., Chicago). To further understand the role of TRF1 in mitotic regulation, soluble TRF1 and its potential binding partners were immunoprecipitated with an anti-TRF1 antibody from the lysates of mitotic HeLa cells because the TRF1-tankyrase 1 complex undergoes dynamic redistribution from the telomere to the centrosome upon the onset of mitosis (17Nakamura M. Zhou X.Z. Kishi S. Lu K.P. Involvement of the telomeric protein Pin2/TRF1 in the regulation of the mitotic spindle.FEBS Lett. 2002; 514: 193-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar)."
https://openalex.org/W1997831025,"The factor VIII (FVIII) crystal structure suggests a possible bonding interaction of His(281) (A1 domain) with Ser(524) (A2 domain), although the resolution of the structure (∼4 Å) does not firmly establish this bonding. To establish that side chains of these residues participate in an interdomain bond, we prepared and examined the functional properties of a residue swap variant (H281S/S524H) where His(281) and Ser(524) residues were exchanged with one another and a disulfide-bridged variant (H281C/S524C) where the two residues were replaced with Cys. The latter variant showed efficient disulfide bonding of the A1 and A2 domains. The swap variant showed WT-like FVIII and FVIIIa stability, which were markedly reduced for H281A and S524A variants in an earlier study. The disulfide-bridged variant showed ∼20% increased FVIII stability, and FVIIIa did not decay during the time course measured. This variant also yielded 35% increased thrombin peak values compared with WT in a plasma-based thrombin generation assay. Binding analyses of H281S-A1/A3C1C2 dimer with S524H-A2 subunit yielded a near WT-like affinity value, whereas combining the variant dimer or A2 subunit with the WT complement yielded ∼5- and ∼10-fold reductions, respectively, in affinity. Other functional properties including thrombin generation potential, FIXa binding affinity, Km for FX of FXase complexes, thrombin activation efficiency, and down-regulation by activated protein C showed similar results for the two variants compared with WT FVIII. These results indicate that the side chains of His(281) and Ser(524) are in close proximity and contribute to a bonding interaction in FVIII that is retained in FVIIIa."
https://openalex.org/W2007331786,"The glycoprotein hormones are all structurally related heterodimers consisting of an α-subunit and a ligand-specific β-subunit that confers their unique biological activity. Crystal structures showed how the β-subunit surrounds a part of the α-subunit, and we showed the existence of the two mechanisms responsible for that assembly. In human choriogonadotropin, the β-subunit is folded before the subunits dock, and the α-subunit becomes incorporated into the dimer by a mechanism we termed ""threading,"" passing between parts of the preassembled β-subunit. Here, we show that the human lutropin β-subunit is not folded completely prior to its interaction with the α-subunit and show that docking of the subunits enables the α-subunit to serve as a chaperone to the β-subunit. Based on data described here, we propose that the α-subunit facilitates formation of the human lutropin β-subunit by two mechanisms. First, the cystine knot of the α-subunit potentiates formation of the β-subunit cystine knot, and second, contacts between α-subunit loop 2 and a hydrophobic tail in the β-subunit facilitate formation of the seatbelt latch disulfide, which stabilizes the heterodimer. The primary influence of the α-subunit was seen when the hydrophobic tail was present or absent, but the secondary mechanism was required only when the hydrophobic tail of the β-subunit was present. During the evolution of human choriogonadotropin, neither of these α-subunit roles was necessary for folding of the β-subunit. The complex mechanism for lutropin assembly may be required to provide an additional control on its positive feedback function in vertebrate reproduction."
