https://openalex.org/W2017879489,"Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) mediates endothelial cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and vascular permeability via the endothelial cell receptors, KDR/Flk-1 and Flt-1. Recently, a gene encoding a polypeptide with about 25% amino acid identity to mammalian VEGF was identified in the genome of Orf virus (OV), a parapoxvirus that affects sheep and goats and occasionally, humans, to generate lesions with angiogenesis. In this study, we examined the biological activities and receptor of OV-derived NZ-7 VEGF (VEGF-E). VEGF-E was found to be a dimer of about 20 kDa with no basic domain nor affinity for heparin column, similar to VEGF121 subtype. VEGF121 has 10–100-fold less endothelial cell mitotic activity than VEGF165 due to lack of a heparin-binding basic region. Interestingly, however, VEGF-E showed almost equal levels of mitotic activity on primary endothelial cells and vascular permeability activity as VEGF165. Furthermore, VEGF-E bound KDR/Flk-1 (VEGFR-2) and induced its autophosphorylation to almost the same extent as VEGF165, but did not bind Flt-1 (VEGFR-1) nor induce autophosphorylation of Flt-1. These results indicate that VEGF-E is a novel type of endothelial growth factor, utilizing only one of the VEGF receptors, and carrying a potent mitogenic activity without affinity to heparin.

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF),1 also known as vascular permeability factor has a potent mitotic activity specific to vascular endothelial cells and a significant vascular permeability activity (1Risau W. Sariola H. Zerwes H.G. Sasse J. Ekblom P. Kemler R. Doetschman T. Development. 1988; 102: 471-478PubMed Google Scholar, 2Folkman J. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1990; 82: 4-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (4409) Google Scholar). A wide variety of studies strongly suggest that VEGF plays an important role in most of the pathological angiogenesis associated with diseases such as diabetic retinopathy, rheumatoid arthritis, and solid tumors (3Ferrara N. Houck K.A. Jakeman L.B. Winer J. Leung D.W. J. Cell. Biochem. 1991; 47: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar, 4Shibuya M. Adv.

Recently, several VEGF-related genes have been isolated and characterized. Placenta growth factor is suggested to be involved in the growth and maintenance of placental tissue, and VEGF-C was shown to carry a lymphangiogenic activity different from VEGF (6Maglione D. Guerriero V. Viglietto G. Delli-Bovi P. Persico M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9267-9271Crossref PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar, 7Kukk E. Lymboussaki A. Taira S. Kaipainen A. Jeltsch M. Joukov V. Alitalo K. Development. 1996; 122: 3829-3837PubMed Google Scholar). VEGF-D is also suggested to have an activity similar to VEGF-C (8Achen M.G. Jeltsch M. Kukk E. Makinen T. Vitali A. Wilks A.F. Alitalo K. Stacker S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 548-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (1017) Google Scholar). However, other genes such as VEGF-B and NZ-type VEGFs encoded in the open reading frames of Orf virus NZ-2 and NZ-7 strains are not well characterized (9Lyttle D.J. Fraser K.M. Fleming S.B. Mercer A.A. Robinson A.J. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 84-92Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Human VEGF has at least four subtypes due to an alternative splicing, VEGF121, VEGF165, VEGF189, and VEGF206 (10Tischer E. Mitchell R. Hartman T. Silva M. Gospodarowicz D. Fiddes J.C. Abraham J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11947-11954Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Houck K.A. Ferrara N. Winer J. Cachianes G. Li B. Leung D.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1806-1814Crossref PubMed Scopus (1236) Google Scholar). Among these, VEGF165 has the most potent biological activity and is the most abundant subtypein vivo with a few exceptions such as in placenta. VEGF121 is also well expressed in many normal and pathological tissues, however, its biological activity has been shown to be 10–100-fold weaker than that of VEGF165. The only difference between these two VEGF subtypes is that VEGF165carries an exon 7-derived 44-amino acid stretch near the carboxyl-terminal region, which is enriched with basic amino acid residues and has affinity for heparin and heparan sulfates (12Keyt B.A. Nguyen H.V. Berleau L.T. Duarte C.M. Park J. Chen H. Ferrara N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5638-5646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Since VEGF165 but not VEGF121 has affinity for cell surface and since a low concentration of heparin could augment the biological activity of VEGF, this basic stretch is considered to be crucial for generation of strong mitotic signals via VEGF165 (13Houck K.A. Leung D.W. Rowland A.M. Winer J. Ferrara N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26031-26037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Cohen T. Gitay-Goren H. Sharon R. Shibuya M. Halaban R. Levi B.-Z.

Cell. 1993; 4: 1317-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (962) Google Scholar). VEGF binds two endothelial cell-specific receptors, Flt-1 and KDR/Flk-1 tyrosine kinases (16Shibuya M. Yamaguchi S. Yamane A. Ikeda T. Tojo A. Matsushime H. Sato M. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 519-524PubMed Google Scholar, 17de Vries C. Escobedo J.A. Ueno H. Houck K. Ferrara N. Williams L.T.

Cell. 1993; 72: 835-846Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1761) Google Scholar). In addition, the exon 7-derived basic stretch in VEGF165 has been shown to bind a 130-kDa cell surface molecule (20Soker S. Fidder H. Neufeld G. Klagsbrun M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5761-5767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Thus, this molecule might also play a role in VEGF signaling, although the mechanism of this action has yet to be elucidated. We are interested in Orf virus NZ strain-encoded VEGFs since the possible gene products have only about 25% amino acid identity with VEGF and have no apparent basic domain, but seem to be involved in the process of pathological angiogenesis in virus-infected lesions. OV is a linear double-stranded DNA virus and a member of the parapoxvirus genus of the Poxvirus family. It causes contagious pustular dermatitis in sheep and goats and is transmissible to humans by direct contact. Lesions appear after an incubation period of approximately 1 week as hemorrhagic bullae. They may reach several centimeters in diameter, but fade spontaneously after several weeks. Histologically, the lesions are highly vascular and edematous showing an increase in the number of vessels by proliferation of endothelial cells, and contain severe inflammatory infiltrates of mixed character. Viral particles were, however, found only in the cytoplasm of degenerating keratinocytes (21Yeh H.P. Soltani K. Arch. Dermatol. 1974; 109: 390-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 22McKeever D.J. Jenkinson D.M. Hutchison G. Reid H.W. J. Comp. Pathol. 1988; 99: 317-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The lesions induced in sheep and humans after infection with OV show extensive dermal vascular responses which are likely to be a direct effect of the expression of the VEGF-like gene (9Lyttle D.J. Fraser K.M. Fleming S.B. Mercer A.A. Robinson A.J. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 84-92Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Robinson A.J. Balassu T.C. Vet. Bull. 1981; 51: 771-781Google Scholar). In this study we characterized an OV NZ-7-derived VEGF-like sequence, and found that this gene product utilizes only one of the VEGF receptors, KDR/Flk-1, but shows a potent endothelial cell growth stimulatory activity and vascular permeability activity similar to those of VEGF165 without the heparin-binding region. These results clearly indicate that the NZ-7-derived protein is a new type of VEGF family in the biochemical point of view. Its exonless cDNA structure in the viral genome suggests a phylogenetic origin in vertebrate genome. Since VEGF-A to -D have already been described, we propose the name, “VEGF-E” for this protein. Sf9 cells were purchased from Invitrogen (California) and cultured in EX-Cell 400 medium (JRH Biosciences, Lenexa, KS). NIH3T3 cell lines overexpressing human Flt-1 (NIH3T3-Flt-1) or human KDR/Flk-1 (NIH3T3-KDR) were used for ligand binding and signal transduction studies. Parental NIH3T3 cells were used for PDGF and FGF stimulation assays. NIH3T3-KDR cells and NIH3T3-Flt-1 cells were established as described previously (24Sawano A. Takahashi T. Yamaguchi S. Aonuma M. Shibuya M. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 213-221PubMed Google Scholar). These cell lines as well as parental NIH3T3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Nissui, Tokyo) supplemented with 10% calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 40 μg/ml kanamycin, and 200 μg/ml G418 sulfate (Geneticin; Life Technologies, Inc., Grand Island, NY). NIH3T3 cell lines overexpressing Flt-4, another member of the VEGF receptor gene family, were kindly provided by Dr. K. Alitalo (University of Helsinki, Finland) and cultured in DMEM containing 10% calf serum and 200 μg/ml geneticin G418 medium. Sinusoidal endothelial cells were isolated from rat liver as described previously and grown in endothelial growth-UV medium (Kurabo, Osaka) supplemented with VEGF (10 ng/ml) (25Yamane A. Seetharam L. Yamaguchi S. Gotoh N. Takahashi T. Neufeld G. Shibuya M. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2683-2690PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant human VEGF165 was prepared as described (24Sawano A. Takahashi T. Yamaguchi S. Aonuma M. Shibuya M. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 213-221PubMed Google Scholar) and recombinant human VEGF121 was obtained from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Human PDGF B/B was obtained from Boehringer Mannheim (Germany) and recombinant human basic FGF was obtained from R&D. The nucleotide sequence of the open reading frame identified in the genome of Orf virus NZ-7 strain (9Lyttle D.J. Fraser K.M. Fleming S.B. Mercer A.A. Robinson A.J. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 84-92Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was synthesized and used for this study. To facilitate oligonucleotide synthesis, three point mutations without change of amino acid sequences were introduced and PstI and KpnI restriction enzyme cleavage sites were generated at codon 65/66 and codon 111, respectively. The three portions were independently synthesized with or without polymerase chain reaction and finally joined to establish the full-length cDNA for NZ-7-derived protein (tentatively designated as VEGF-E) on pUC 18 vector. Polyclonal antisera against VEGF-E were raised in rabbits using a carboxyl-terminal 20-amino acid sequence as antigen. The antiserum to peptide specifically recognized VEGF-E by Western blot analysis. Polyclonal antibody against the amino-terminal region of the human Flt-1 was kindly provided by Dr. K. Ohsumi (Mitsubishi-Yuka BCL, Tokyo, Japan). Anti-human KDR/Flk-1 rabbit antiserum (B2) was prepared by using a synthetic oligopeptide for human KDR/Flk-1 residue numbers 1295 to 1317 as previously reported (26Takahashi T. Shibuya M. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2079-2089Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). A monoclonal antibody specific to phosphotyrosine (PY20) was obtained from ICN Biochemicals (Costa Mesa, CA). Anti-PLCγ and anti-phospho mitogen-activated protein kinase antibodies were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY) and from Promega (Madison, WI), respectively. Secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase were purchased from Amersham (Arlington Heights, IL). The full-length coding region for the VEGF-E was subcloned into the BamHI-EcoRI site on the multi-cloning region of pVL1393, designated as pVEGF-E. This plasmid was used for cotransfection into Sf9 cells along with linearized Baculovirus DNA “BaculoGold” (Phamingen, San Diego, CA). Amplification of the recombinant viruses was carried out at 3-day intervals. The titer of the recombinant viruses was checked by agarose gel titration. Sf9 cells grown in serum-free Ex-Cell 400 medium (JRH Biosciences, KS) were used for a large scale preparation of VEGF-E protein, and were infected with viruses at a multiplicity of infection of about 10. One h after infection, the supernatant was removed and fresh serum-free medium was added to the culture plates. Three days after infection, the supernatant was collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE on a 12% gel followed by Western blotting using anti-VEGF-E antiserum. About 150 ml of the supernatant of VEGF-E recombinant virus-infected Sf9 cells was collected, concentrated, and dialyzed to 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, containing 10 mm NaCl and 20% glycerol. The sample was applied to a cation-exchange S-P column (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden). Proteins bound were eluted with 10 mmNaCl-containing 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0). VEGF-E was eluted as a more than 80% pure protein after most bulk proteins in the sample were eluted in the flow-through fraction. For detection of VEGF-E protein, aliquots of fractions were analyzed by Western blotting using anti-VEGF-E antiserum and by silver staining. The purity of VEGF-E was above 80%. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) (Morinaga, Tokyo) were grown in HUVE culture medium (Morinago, Tokyo) and used for endothelial cell growth assay. HUVEC were seeded at 1000 cells/well on 96-well plates in growth factor-free HUVE culture medium. Four h after plating, growth factor (VEGF-E, VEGF165, or VEGF121) containing medium was added After 4 days, the cell numbers were determined using a Coulter counter or the MTT (cell proliferation) assay (Sigma). For MTT assay, 20 μl of 1 mg/ml 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazolo-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT, Sigma) was added to each well. After the wells were incubated with MTT for 4 h at 37 °C, the supernatant was removed completely from each well, then, 150 μl of dimethyl sulfoxide was added and OD540 values of the samples were determined. Rat liver non-parenchymal cells, which contain about 90% sinusoidal endothelial cells, were prepared by perfusion of rat liver with collagenase followed by differential centrifugation (25Yamane A. Seetharam L. Yamaguchi S. Gotoh N. Takahashi T. Neufeld G. Shibuya M. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2683-2690PubMed Google Scholar). Nonparenchymal cell fractions (NP cells) were grown in endothelial cell growth-UV medium (Kurabo, Japan) without growth factor, or with growth factors VEGF165 or VEGF-E. Vascular permeability activity of VEGF-E was determined using the Miles assay (27MiLes A.A. Miles E.M. J. Physiol. 1952; 118: 228-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Anesthetized guinea pigs were shaved on the back and injected intracardinally with 1 ml of 0.5% Evans Blue (Sigma). About 30 min later, 200 μl of several samples or control phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) were injected intracutaneously into the back of the guinea pig. After 30 min, leakage of dyes was detected by the presence of blue spots at the injection sites. Iodination of growth factors was performed essentially as described previously (28Seetharam L. Gotoh N. Maru Y. Neufeld G. Yamaguchi S. Shibuya M. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 135-147PubMed Google Scholar). The specific activity of the product 125I-VEGF165 was 100,000 cpm/ng and that of 125I-VEGF-E was 70,000 to 80,000 cpm/ng. NIH3T3-Flt-1 and NIH3T3 KDR/Flk-1 cells were seeded at 1 × 105cells/well on 24-well collagen-coated plates 24 h prior to experimental use. The cells were preincubated with binding buffer (DMEM, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), 0.1% BSA) at 4 °C for 30 min. Then the medium was replaced with 0.3 ml of binding medium (DMEM, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), 0.5% BSA) containing radiolabeled ligands, and the binding reactions were allowed to proceed at 4 °C for 90 min. All experiments were determined in triplicate wells. After incubation, the cells were washed three times with ice-cold binding buffer then twice with ice-cold PBS containing 0.1% BSA. Subsequently, the cells were solubilized by the addition of 0.5 ml of 0.5n NaOH per well at 37 °C for 10 min, followed by an additional wash with 0.5 ml of PBS per well, and the radioactivity was counted in a γ-counter. Values were analyzed according to Scatchard's procedure (29Scatchard G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1949; 51: 660-672Crossref Scopus (17806) Google Scholar, 30Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (7771) Google Scholar). Competition assay was done by incubating the cells with fixed (125I-VEGF165 1 ng/ml; 125I-VEGF-E 1 to 2 ng/ml) and increasing concentrations of unlabeled ligands. Nonspecific binding was determined by parallel binding assay with NIH3T3-neo cells or by competition assay in the presence of excess unlabeled ligands with NIH3T3-Flt-1 or NIH3T3-KDR/Flk-1. Forin vivo phosphorylation, NIH3T3-Flt-1 cells were grown to near confluence, and starved overnight in 0.1% serum-containing medium and stimulated at 37 °C with 10 ng/ml VEGF165, VEGF-E, or BSA for 5 min. In the case of NIH3T3-KDR/Flk-1, the cells were stimulated after being starved overnight in 0.5% serum medium because of the relatively strong autophosphorylation of KDR/Flk-1. The cells were washed in ice-cold PBS with 0.1 mmNa3VO4 twice and lysed in 1% Triton X-100 lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 2% aprotinin, 1 mm PMSF, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mmNa4P2O7, and 2 mmNa3VO4). The lysates were clarified by centrifugation (15,000 rpm × 10 min). Protein concentrations were measured using Bio-Rad protein assay (Richmond, CA) and the same amounts of protein of each sample were used for analysis. For immunoblotting, the cell lysates were subjected to 7.5% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose sheet. The blots were incubated with a blocking solution (5% BSA containing washing buffer (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.3% Tween 20)) and probed with the primary antibody diluted in the blocking solution. The signal was visualized using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham) according to the manufacture's instructions. For immunoprecipitation, cell lysates were incubated with the primary antibody at 4 °C overnight. The resulting immune complexes were collected by precipitation with protein A (for anti-KDR/Flk-1 antiserum) or protein G (for anti-PLC-γ antibodies) Sepharose beads (Pharmacia). The immunoprecipitates were then washed three times with 1% Triton X-100 lysis buffer. For the experiments involving complex formation, 0.1% Triton X-100 lysis buffer was used for washing. Samples were then separated by electrophoresis on 7.5% polyacrylamide gels and analyzed as above with appropriate antibodies, anti-receptors, or anti-phosphotyrosine (PY20) from ICN Biochemicals (Costa Mesa, CA). NIH3T3 cells were seeded at 7 × 104 cells per 3.5-cm plate in 1% serum containing DMEM. Four h after plating, 10 ng/ml growth factor (PDGF-B/B, basic FGF or VEGF-E) containing medium was added. After the 4-day culture, the cells were detached with 0.5% trypsin and the cell numbers were counted. Recombinant human VEGF165 or purified VEGF-E was mixed with cold liquid Matrigels and injected subcutaneously into the flanks of 6-week-old ICR and BALB/c nude male mice. Five days after injection, animals were sacrificed and the gels were recovered. The gels were observed macroscopically and under stereoscopic microscope. For histological examination, the gels were fixed in 4% formalin and embedded in paraffin. Sections of gels were either stained with hematoxylin and eosin or reacted with a mouse biotinylated monoclonal antibody (diluted 1:1000) to von Willebrand factor (Dakopatts, Glostrup, Denmark). After applying the biotinylated antibody, the immunoreaction was visualized by the avidin-peroxidase method and by a light counter-staining with hematoxylin and eosin. To examine the biological and biochemical features of VEGF-E, we synthesized its cDNA as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and prepared its gene product on a large scale using Baculovirus system. Detection of the proteins was carried out using a rabbit antiserum against the carboxyl-terminal peptide of VEGF-E (Fig. 1 B). VEGF-E is predicted to be a 149-amino acid protein including a signal peptide of about 20 amino acids, and its overall structure without the basic amino acid cluster region is similar to the shortest subtype of VEGF, VEGF121 (Fig. 1 A). As expected from the structural similarity to VEGF121, VEGF-E did not show any affinity for the heparin column (data not shown). In addition, VEGF-E had only a weak affinity for the cation exchange column, thus, we purified it by using S-P column under acidic (pH 6.0) conditions as shown in Fig. 2. The elution pattern of VEGF-E showed a double band of 22 and 24 kDa, the former was 2–3-fold more intense than the latter based on immunoblotting. The difference of these two forms could be due to a minor difference of glycosylation. The silver staining for the 24-kDa VEGF-E was very faint. Repeated experiments suggest that this form is rather resistant to this staining. The VEGF family belongs to the VEGF-PDGF supergene family, all the members of which have a dimer structure under natural conditions. Using reducing and nonreducing conditions, we found that VEGF-E exists as a homodimer of 44 kDa in the absence of reducing reagent, while it is separated to the 22–24-kDa monomer in the presence of a high concentration of dithiothreitol (Fig. 1 B). These results indicate that the basic structure of VEGF-E is consistent with that of a member of the VEGF-PDGF supergene family. Since an important characteristic of VEGF is endothelial cell-specific growth stimulatory activity, we examined the effect of VEGF-E on the proliferation of HUVEC as well as rat liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (25Yamane A. Seetharam L. Yamaguchi S. Gotoh N. Takahashi T. Neufeld G. Shibuya M. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2683-2690PubMed Google Scholar). Although the structural similarity between VEGF-E and VEGF121 is only 25% at the amino acid level, unexpectedly, VEGF-E showed a potent mitotic activity and stimulated the growth of these two types of endothelial cells to almost the same degree as VEGF165(Fig. 3). Cell numbers at 1 ng/ml VEGF-E corresponded to those at 0.8 ng/ml VEGF165 and at 10 ng/ml VEGF121. The maximum number of cells stimulated with VEGF121 was one-half that with VEGF165 and VEGF-E. Furthermore, VEGF-E induced an elongated morphology of rat sinusoidal endothelial cells to a degree comparable to that with VEGF165 (Fig. 4).Figure 4Mitotic and morphological activity of VEGF-E on rat liver sinusoidal endothelial cells. Rat liver sinusoidal endothelial cells were cultured with various concentrations of VEGF165 (right panels), VEGF-E (left panels), or without growth factor (upper panel) for 4 days. VEGF-E showed mitotic activity in a dose-dependent manner on both endothelial cells equal to VEGF165 and induced morphological change same as VEGF165.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To examine the effect of VEGF-E upon vascular permeability, we carried out the Miles assay using guinea pigs and Evans Blue dye as a marker. As shown in Fig. 5, 20 ng of VEGF165 was sufficient to saturate the release of dye from the capillary. The same concentration of VEGF-E exerted comparable vascular permeability factor activity as VEGF165. The margin of the blue spots generated with VEGF-E was more diffuse than those with VEGF165, probably due to little, if any, affinity of VEGF-E to the heparin or heparan sulfate of matrix or mesenchymal cell surface. VEGF121 (20 ng/0.2 ml) gave only a weak spot (data not shown). Control experiments using the conditioned medium of insect cells or PBS did not show any vascular permeability factor activity. To examine why VEGF-E has comparable biological activities to VEGF165, we examined the receptors specific to VEGF-E. Since VEGF binds both the Flt-1 tyrosine kinase and a related kinase KDR/Flk-1 at high affinity (17de Vries C. Escobedo J.A. Ueno H. Houck K. Ferrara N. Williams L.T.

A. 1993; 90: 7533-7537Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar), we carried out competition experiments using 125I-labeled VEGF and unlabeled VEGF-E. Since the full-length Flt-1 and KDR/Flk-1 receptors separately expressed in culture cells are better materials for binding competition experiments, we used human Flt-1-overexpressing NIH3T3 cells (NIH3T3-Flt-1), human KDR/Flk-1-overexpressing cells (NIH3T3-KDR/Flk-1), and control cells carrying the vector alone (NIH3T3-neo). As indicated in Fig. 6 A, VEGF-E competed the binding of 125I-VEGF to NIH3T3-KDR/Flk-1. Competition of VEGF-E for binding of125I-VEGF to KDR/Flk-1 showed a kinetics very similar to that of unlabeled VEGF. Surprisingly, however, even a 1,000-fold excess of VEGF-E could not inhibit the binding of 125I-VEGF to the Flt-1 receptor (Fig. 6 B). As a positive control, unlabeled VEGF competed the binding of 125I-VEGF to NIH3T3-Flt-1 and NIH3T3-KDR/Flk-1 (Fig. 6, A and B). These results strongly suggest that VEGF-E can bind to KDR/Flk-1 but not to Flt-1. To more directly examine the receptor molecule(s) for VEGF-E, an aliquot of the purified VEGF-E was labeled with 125I and used for the binding assay. As expected, the 125I-labeled VEGF-E bound NIH3T3-KDR/Flk-1 cells but neither NIH3T3-Flt-1 nor NIH3T3-neo cells (Fig. 6, C and D). The binding of 125I-VEGF-E to KDR/Flk-1 was competed by unlabeled VEGF-E to the same degree as that of unlabeled VEGF (Fig. 6 D). A Scatchard analysis indicated that the K d for the binding of VEGF-E to KDR/Flk-1 was about 330 pm (Fig. 6 E). This K d value indicates that the affinity of VEGF-E for KDR/Flk-1 is almost the same as that of VEGF165 for KDR/Flk-1 under our experimental conditions (our VEGF165 K d is 300 pm, and other groups have reported a VEGF165 K d of 400–800 pm) (24Sawano A. Takahashi T. Yamaguchi S. Aonuma M. Shibuya M. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 213-221PubMed Google Scholar, 32Waltenberger J. Claesson-Welsh L. Siegbahn A. Shibuya M. Heldin C.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26988-26995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results indicate that VEGF-E binds KDR/Flk-1 but not Flt-1 as the receptor on the cell surface. To further examine KDR/Flk-1 as the receptor for VEGF-E, we tested whether VEGF-E could stimulate intracellular signaling from KDR/Flk-1. The first event for the signal transduction from receptor tyrosine kinase is the autophosphorylation of the receptor molecules on tyrosine. NIH3T3-KDR/Flk-1 cells were serum-starved overnight and then stimulated with VEGF165, VEGF-E, or fetal bovine serum. As shown in Fig. 7 A, both VEGF165 and VEGF-E clearly stimulated autophosphorylation of KDR/Flk-1 based on the immunoprecipitation with anti-KDR/F"
https://openalex.org/W2011761299,"We screened a Xenopus laevis oocyte cDNA expression library with a Src homology 3 (SH3) class II peptide ligand and identified a 1270-amino acid-long protein containing two Eps15 homology (EH) domains, a central coiled-coil region, and five SH3 domains. We named this protein Intersectin, because it potentially brings together EH and SH3 domain-binding proteins into a macromolecular complex. The ligand preference of the EH domains were deduced to be asparajine-proline-phenylalanine (NPF) or cyclized NPF (CX 1–2NPFXXC), depending on the type of phage-displayed combinatorial peptide library used. Screens of a mouse embryo cDNA library with the EH domains of Intersectin yielded clones for the Rev-associated binding/Rev-interacting protein (RAB/Rip) and two novel proteins, which we named Intersectin-binding proteins (Ibps) 1 and 2. All three proteins contain internal and C-terminal NPF peptide sequences, and Ibp1 and Ibp2 also contain putative clathrin-binding sites. Deletion of the C-terminal sequence, NPFL-COOH, from RAB/Rip eliminated EH domain binding, whereas fusion of the same peptide sequence to glutathione S-transferase generated strong binding to the EH domains of Intersectin. Several experiments support the conclusion that the free carboxylate group contributes to binding of the NPFL motif at the C terminus of RAB/Rip to the EH domains of Intersectin. Finally, affinity selection experiments with the SH3 domains of Intersectin identified two endocytic proteins, dynamin and synaptojanin, as potential interacting proteins. We propose that Intersectin is a component of the endocytic machinery.

The EH1 domain has recently been described as a protein interaction module involved in endocytosis (1Di Fiore P.P. Pelicci P.G. Sorkin A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 411-413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The domain was first discovered in Eps15, a tyrosine kinase phosphorylation substrate of the epidermal growth factor receptor (2Wong W.T. Schumacher C. Salcini A.E. Romano A. Castagnino P.

Eps15 is a ∼145,000 Da protein with three EH repeats and has been shown to be a component of endocytic vesicle intermediates (3Carbone R. Fre S. Iannolo G. Belleudi F. Mancini P. Pelicci P.G.

Biochemical analysis of the Eps15 EH domains have shown that they are likely involved in protein-protein interactions: far-Western blotting and affinity chromatography experiments demonstrate that a number of cellular proteins can bind to the Eps15 EH fusion protein (2Wong W.T. Schumacher C. Salcini A.E. Romano A. Castagnino P. Pelicci P.G. Di Fiore P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Within the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome there are five EH domain-containing proteins, two of which, Pan1 and End3, have been shown to have roles in endocytosis (7Benedetti H. Raths S. Crausaz F.

Another protein interaction module is the Src homology 3 (SH3) domain. This domain is 50–70 amino acids long and is present in numerous signal transduction and cytoskeletal proteins (10Cohen G.B.

Examination of the ligand specificity of SH3 domains has revealed that they recognize proline-rich sequences containing the core peptide sequence PXXP (12Ren R. Mayer B.J. Cicchetti P. Baltimore D.

Interactions between SH3 domains and PXXP sequence-containing proteins have also been shown to contribute to synaptic vesicle endocytosis. For example, amphiphysin I, amphiphysin II, and endophilin are SH3 domain-containing proteins that are enriched in the nerve terminal and that interact through their SH3 domains with proline-rich sequences in dynamin and synaptojanin (18David C.

An interesting connection between SH3 domain- and EH domain-mediated interactions has been revealed by the observation that the 170-kDa alternative splice variant of synaptojanin (19McPherson P.S.

During the course of our investigations into SH3 domains and peptide ligands, we found that we could screen cDNA expression libraries with synthetic peptide ligands of SH3 domains and isolate cDNAs encoding SH3 domain-containing proteins (29Sparks A.B. Hoffman N.G. McConnell S.J. Fowlkes D.M. Kay B.K. Nat. Biotech. 1996; 14: 741-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). We have screened cDNA expression libraries of a 16-day-old mouse embryo, human prostate, and human hematopoietic cells and identified 18 different SH3 domain containing cDNAs, 10 of which are novel. We have named this approach cloning of ligand targets (COLT) (29Sparks A.B. Hoffman N.G. McConnell S.J. Fowlkes D.M. Kay B.K. Nat. Biotech. 1996; 14: 741-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). In this report, we describe the structure and molecular recognition properties of a novel protein isolated in a COLT screen of a Xenopus laevis oocyte cDNA library. We have named this protein Intersectin, because it potentially brings several proteins together into a macromolecular complex through its two EH and five SH3 domains. Evidence is presented in support of the interaction of Intersectin with two protein components of the endocytic machinery, dynamin and synaptojanin, as well as several novel putative clathrin-binding proteins. AXenopus laevis oocyte cDNA λzapII library (courtesy of Dr. Alan Wolffe, National Institutes of Health) was screened by COLT (29Sparks A.B. Hoffman N.G. McConnell S.J. Fowlkes D.M. Kay B.K. Nat. Biotech. 1996; 14: 741-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) with a biotinylated Src SH3 class II binding peptide, biotin-SGSGILAPPVPPRNTR-NH2. A single binding isolate was recovered from a screen of ∼104 plaques, rescued (30Short J.M. Fernadez J.M. Sorge J.A. Huse W.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7583-7600Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar), and sequenced. The insert was used to screen a X. laevistadpole cDNA λzapII library (courtesy of Dr. Doug DeSimone, University of Virginia) by molecular hybridization. Positive clones were rescued and sequenced, to generate a full-length coding region. Glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusions to the individual EH domains of Intersectin were generated by amplifying the appropriate regions from the cDNA sequence by polymerase chain reaction (31Saiki R.K. Gelfand D.H. Stoffel S. Scharf S.J. Higuchi R. Horn G.T. Mullis K.B. Erlich H.A. Science. 1988; 239: 487-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (13495) Google Scholar) and subcloning them into pGEX2TK (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). GST fusion protein was purified according to the manufacturer's instructions. The peptide ligand preferences of both EH domains were determined by screening (32Sparks A. Adey N. Cwirla S. Kay B. Kay B.K. Winter J. McCafferty J. Phage Display of Peptides and Proteins: A Laboratory Manual. Academic Press, San Diego1996: 227-253Crossref Google Scholar) two different bacteriophage M13 libraries: an X 9 library displayed on the major (pVIII) capsid protein (33Felici F. Castagnoli L. Musacchio A. Jappelli R. Cesareni G. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 301-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar), and anX 10C library displayed on a minor (pIII) capsid protein. Each combinatorial peptide library contained over 200 million clones, where X is any amino acid encoded by NN(G/T) codons. The primary structures of the peptides displayed by binding phage were determined by DNA sequencing. A λEXlox mouse 16-day-embryo cDNA expression library (Novagen, Madison, WI) was screened according to a published protocol (34Yamabhai M. Kay B.K. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 247: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Plasmids bearing the cDNA inserts were rescued from the isolated λ phage by Cre-mediated excision, and the inserts were sequenced by fluorescent dideoxynucleotide sequencing. Various peptide sequences were fused genetically to the N terminus of secreted alkaline phosphatase (AP) using published methods (34Yamabhai M. Kay B.K. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 247: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Microtiter plate wells, coated with approximately 1 μg of GST fusions to EH domains of Intersectin, End3p, or Pan1p, were incubated with different peptide-AP fusions for 1 h. After washing, the amount of enzyme retained in the wells is measured with a colorimetric assay using p-nitrophenyl phosphate and a microtiter plate spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) at a wavelength of 405 nm. To evaluate the relative binding strength of various peptides for the EHa domain, a competition assay was used. Microtiter plate wells, coated with approximately 2 μg of GST fused to EHa, were incubated with an AP fusion to the peptide sequence DCTNPFRSCWR, along with individual peptides at varying concentrations. The following synthetic peptides were purchased (Research Genetics, Huntsville, AL): NPF1 (Ac-PSTNPFVAA-CONH2), NPF2 (Ac-SSTNPFWTN-CONH2), NPF3 (Ac-VSSNPFMTG-CONH2), NPFL-COOH (Ac-GSSSTNPFL-COOH), NPFL-CONH2 (Ac-GSSSTNPFL-CONH2), and cyclized NPF (biotin-GSGSDCTNPFRSCWR-CONH2; intramolecular disulfide bond). The peptides were >75% pure, and their identities were confirmed by mass spectroscopy. Adult rat brains were homogenized at 1:10 (weight:volume) in 20 mm HEPES-OH (pH 7.4) containing 0.83 mmbenzamidine, 0.23 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin followed by centrifugation for 5 min at 800 × g max. The resulting postnuclear supernatants were incubated with 1% Triton X-100 for 1 h at 4 °C, and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 180,000 × g max for 1 h. The soluble supernatant (1 mg of protein) was incubated overnight at 4 °C with various GST fusion proteins (∼25 μg of each fusion protein) coupled to glutathione-Sepharose. Samples were then washed extensively in 20 mm HEPES-OH (pH 7.4) containing 0.83 mm benzamidine, 0.23 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1% Triton X-100; bound proteins were then eluted with SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The samples were then processed for Western blot analysis with antibodies against dynamin (18David C. McPherson P.S. Mundigl O. De Camilli P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 331-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar), synaptojanin145 (35McPherson P.S. Takei K. Schmid S.L. De Camilli P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30132-30139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or synaptojanin170(19McPherson P.S. Garcia E.P. Slepnev V.I. David C. Zhang X. Grabs D. Sossin W.S. Bauerfeind R. Nemoto Y. De Camilli P. Nature. 1996; 379: 353-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). In a COLT screen (29Sparks A.B. Hoffman N.G. McConnell S.J. Fowlkes D.M. Kay B.K. Nat. Biotech. 1996; 14: 741-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) of a Xenopus laevis oocyte cDNA expression library with a Src SH3 class II peptide ligand probe, we isolated a single reactive cDNA clone. Upon sequencing, we determined that the clone encoded a segment of a protein with five SH3 domains at its C terminus. To isolate the full-length version of this mRNA, we probed a tadpole cDNA library by nucleic acid hybridization and recovered several full-length and overlapping clones. Fig. 1 A portrays the amino acid sequence of the protein that we have named Intersectin, to suggest its possible role as an adaptor or scaffold molecule. The 1270-amino acid-long protein (predicted molecular mass, 143,581 Da) has two EH domains, a central coiled-coil region, and five C-terminal SH3 domains (Fig. 1 B). The two Intersectin EH domains are 38% identical to each other and ∼45% similar to EH domains identified in the genomes of yeast, nematode, and mouse. BLAST searches of GenBankTM show Intersectin to be a novel protein, with the greatest similarity to two human (SH3P17 and SH3P18) and two fly proteins (Dap160–1 and Dap160–2). Although SH3P17 and SH3P18 protein sequences are not full-length (29Sparks A.B. Hoffman N.G. McConnell S.J. Fowlkes D.M. Kay B.K. Nat. Biotech. 1996; 14: 741-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), they share 84–85% amino acid identity with Intersectin, with the highest level of matching between the SH3 domains (98% for SH3P17 and 90% for SH3P18). The fly proteins, referred to as dynamin-associated proteins (Daps), Dap160–1 and Dap160–2, are alternatively spliced products that are very similar to Intersectin, except that they contain four instead of five SH3 domains (36Roos J. Kelly R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19108-19119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Even though the human cDNA clones are incomplete, we propose that Intersectin, SH3P17, SH3P18, and Dap160 are encoded by homologous genes or members of a gene family in frogs, humans, and flies. Based on earlier experiments demonstrating that EH domains of Eps15 and Eps15R could react with numerous proteins in far Western blots (2Wong W.T. Schumacher C. Salcini A.E. Romano A. Castagnino P. Pelicci P.G. Di Fiore P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9530-9534Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that the Intersectin EH domains would have the capacity to interact with short peptide ligands. Therefore, each EH domain was subcloned into pGEX2T to generate GST fusions that were used to screen phage-displayed combinatorial peptide libraries (37Cwirla S.E. Peters E.A. Barrett R.W. Dower W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6378-6382Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar, 38Devlin J.J. Panganiban L.C. Devlin P.E. Science. 1990; 249: 404-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar, 39Scott J.K. Smith G.P. Science. 1990; 249: 386-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (1894) Google Scholar). Fig. 2, A and B, lists the amino acid sequences of phage that were affinity selected from the 9-mer library (33Felici F. Castagnoli L. Musacchio A. Jappelli R. Cesareni G. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 301-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar) with the EHa and EHb domains of Intersectin, respectively. Both domains selected peptides with the tripeptide consensus, asparagine-proline-phenylalanine (NPF), although phage selected with the EHa domain tended to bind better to EHa than EHb, and vice versa. Interestingly, NPF was also identified in affinity selection experiments with the EH domains of Eps15 and Eps15R (6Salcini A.E. Confalonieri S. Doria M. Santolini E. Tassi E. Minenkova O. Cesareni G. Pelicci P.G. Di Fiore P.P. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2239-2249Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), suggesting that the EH domains of Intersectin, Eps15, and Eps15R have similar or equivalent peptide specificity. We next performed affinity selection experiments with a second combinatorial peptide library, displayed on the minor capsid protein pIII. We isolated three different peptides with the NPF motif; however, in this case, the NPF sequences were flanked on each side by cysteines (Fig. 2 C). The presence of the cysteines suggested to us that conformational constraint, provided by intramolecular disulfide bonds, may enhance the binding of the NPF tripeptide to the Intersectin EH domains. To explore this possibility, we fused different peptide sequences to a secreted form of the Escherichia coli AP protein (34Yamabhai M. Kay B.K. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 247: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Fusion of the sequence DCTNPFSCWR to the N terminus of AP yielded a protein capable of binding strongly to microtiter plate wells coated with GST fusions to the EH domains of Intersectin, Eps15, but not of the yeast proteins End3p and Pan1p (Fig. 3). When the same peptide sequence was fused to AP, but with serine replacing the cysteines, binding was abolished. These results demonstrate that the structural conformation of NPF-bearing peptides, provided by intramolecular disulfide bonds, contributes to binding. This conclusion is supported by the inability of two peptide ligands, isolated from the pVIII library (Fig. 2), to bind the EH domains when fused to AP (Fig. 3). Two reasons may potentially account for the apparent differences in the selection outcomes from the pVIII and pIII phage-displayed libraries. First, due to the higher display valency of the major capsid protein (2500 copies versus 5), weak interactions may be preserved during selection due to avidity effects. Second, the major capsid protein may have contributed a structural conformation to the NPF peptide, optimizing its binding to the Intersectin EH domains. The major coat protein adopts a near-crystalline state (40Glucksman M.J. Bhattacharjee S. Makowski L. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 455-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 41Kishchenko G. Batliwala H. Makowski L. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 241: 208-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), which influences the structure of attached peptides (42Petrenko V.A. Smith G.P. Gong X. Quinn T. Protein Eng. 1996; 9: 797-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). To learn what proteins may interact with the EH domains of Intersectin, we initially screened the frog oocyte cDNA expression library with the two EH domains of Intersectin, fused separately to bacterial AP (34Yamabhai M.

However, screening a 16-day mouse embryo cDNA library, which we have used extensively (29Sparks A.B. Hoffman N.G. McConnell S.J. Fowlkes D.M. Kay B.K. Nat. Biotech. 1996; 14: 741-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), yielded four reactive clones (Fig. 4 A). They comprised three different, incomplete sequences: two were novel, and the other was identified as the murine homolog of the Rev-associated binding/Rev-interacting protein (RAB/Rip) (43Bogerd H.P. Fridell R.A. Madore S. Cullen B.R. Cell. 1995; 82: 485-494Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 44Fritz C.C. Zapp M.L. Green M.R. Nature. 1995; 376: 530-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). We have named the two novel mouse proteins Intersectin-binding proteins (Ibps), Ibp1 and Ibp2. All three predicted proteins carried three to four copies of the tripeptide NPF, agreeing with the outcome of the experiments with the combinatorial peptides. Interestingly, not only is the spacing of the NPF motifs comparable between the three proteins, but they also shared similar C-terminal sequences (i.e. TNPFL-COOH or TNPFLL-COOH). Although both EH domains of Intersectin interact with the three proteins, in general the EHa domain binds more strongly than EHb. Sequence analysis of Ibp1 and Ibp2 revealed a number of interesting features. First, both proteins have a 66-amino acid segment of primary structural similarity that includes two of the internal NPF motifs (Fig. 4, double-underlined residues). This segment is also present in MP90 (Fig. 4 B), a mitotic phosphoprotein (45Stukenberg P.T. Lustig K.D. McGarry T.J. King R.W. Kuang J. Kirschner M.W. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 338-348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), and a nematode protein of unknown function, T040C10.2 (not shown). Second, within the 66-amino acid segment is the sequence LV(D/N)LD (Fig. 4, italicized), which resembles the consensus sequence L(L/I)(D/E/N)(L/F)(D/E), recently delineated for clathrin binding (46Goodman Jr., O.B.

Neurochem. 1998; 70: 2369-2376Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Third, Ibp1 has a 25-amino acid segment in common with MP90 (Fig. 4, dotted underlining). Within this segment is the tripeptide DPW, which is present two, three, and nine times in Ibp1, Ibp2, and MP90, respectively. It should also be noted, that in the EH domain-containing protein, Eps15 (49Fazioli F. Minichiello L. Matoskova B. Wong W.T. Di Fiore P.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5814-5828Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), which has been shown to be involved in endocytosis (3Carbone R. Fre S. Iannolo G. Belleudi F. Mancini P. Pelicci P.G.

Chem. 1996; 271: 12111-12116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), there are 10 copies of a similar tripeptide sequence, DPF. The superficial similarity of the DPW and DPF motifs to NPF suggests that they may also serve as ligand sites for a protein interaction module(s). Fourth, an 81-amino acid segment (Fig. 4, A and B, single-underlined) is shared between Ibp2 and MP90. Examination of GenBank has revealed that this 81-amino acid segment is part of a larger (i.e. ∼140 amino acids) conserved element, present at the N terminus of at least 12 proteins. 2B. K. Kay, M. Yamabhai, B. Wendland, and S. D. Emr, submitted for publication. The function of all of these proteins with the ∼140-amino acid conserved element is unknown, except that there is some weak similarity to a region within the clathrin assembly protein AP180 (53Jones H. Hooley R. Plant Physiol. 1997; 113: 663Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The colinear similarity between the Ibp1, Ibp2, MP90, and T040C10.2 proteins suggests that they are likely related in cellular function. To evaluate whether the internal or C-terminal NPF repeats within the RAB/Rip protein were responsible for binding to the EHa domain, a simple truncation experiment was performed. As seen in Fig. 5 A, although EHa bound to GST-RAB/Rip when blotted to a membrane, it failed to bind to GST- RAB/Rip when it lacked 5 amino acids (TNPFL) at its C terminus. Conversely, binding was robust when TNPFL was fused to the C terminus of GST. Because the binding of the EHa-AP to the GST-RAB/Rip and GST-TNPFL fusions appeared equivalent, we hypothesized that the EH domains of Intersectin interact principally with the C-terminal TNPFL sequence within RAB/Rip. This hypothesis was tested with synthetic peptides. Peptides corresponding to the four NPF motifs of RAB/Rip were tested for their ability to compete the binding of an AP fusion protein to the EHa domain of Intersectin. Fig. 6demonstrates that the IC50 value for the C-terminal NPFL-COOH peptide of RAB/Rip is 40 μm, whereas the IC50 values for the three internal motifs are 600–1000 μm. Thus, the C-terminal peptide sequence of RAB/Rip is a much better ligand than its internal peptides, even though they are all the same length (i.e. 9-mers). The importance of the carboxylate group in the C-terminal NPFL-COOH peptide is underscored by the observation that same sequence, but with a carboxamide instead of a carboxylate group, has an IC50 value of 300 μm. Finally, by comparison a cyclized NPF peptide, isolated from a phage-displayed combinatorial peptide library (Fig. 2 C, asterisk), is the best ligand, with an approximate IC50 of 3 μm. Similar results were obtained with the EHb domain (data not shown). When the NPFLX 0–1-COOH motif was used to search GenBank, we came across the MP90 protein (Fig. 4 B). This protein, with an apparent molecular mass of 90,000 Da, was originally identified in a screen for X. laevis mitotic phosphoproteins (45Stukenberg P.T. Lustig K.D. McGarry T.J. King R.W. Kuang J. Kirschner M.W. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 338-348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). To confirm that MP90 potentially interacted with the EH domains of Intersectin, we tested whether or not MP90 could be selected from a mixture of two labeled components. Fig. 5 B demonstrates that GST fusions to either EHa or EHb, but not Src SH3, could bind specifically to MP90. Based on the occurrence of the NPF motif at the C terminus of the RAB, Ibp1, Ibp2, and MP90 proteins, we wondered how close the motif needed to be at the C terminus to bind well to the Intersectin EHa domain. In Fig. 7, the NPF motif is successively displaced from the C terminus of a fusion to GST by the insertion of variable numbers of alanine residues. Although there is strong binding to GST-TNPFL, binding is reduced with the insertion of one alanine and absent with the insertion of two or more alanines at the C terminus. Thus, even though the fusion proteins are present in equivalent amounts, binding by the Intersectin EHa domain requires that the motif be NPFL-COOH or NPFLX-COOH. Future experiments will address the precise requirements of the ligand for a free carboxylate group, now that the three-dimensional structure of one EH domain has been determined (54de Beer T. Carter R.E. Lobel-Rice K.E. Sorkin A. Overduin M. Science. 1998; 28: 1357-1360Crossref Scopus (110) Google Scholar). To characterize the protein-protein interaction specificity of the SH3 domains of Intersectin, combinatorial peptide libraries were screened with the SH3A domain. 3B. K. Kay, N. G. Hoffman, and N. L. Hardison, unpublished results. When the peptide sequences were used to search GenBank by computer, we found related sequences in the guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Ras, Son-of-sevenless, and dynamin. Thus, we decided to determine whether SH3A and the other SH3 domains of Intersectin would affinity select dynamin from rat brains, which are a rich source of well characterized endocytic proteins. As seen in Fig. 8, the SH3A, B, C, and E domains of Intersectin could individually, and quantitatively, recover dynamin and the 145-kDa isoform of synaptojanin (synaptojanin145). The 170-kDa isoform of synaptojanin (synaptojanin170) could be recovered by only the SH3A, C, and E domains. Because the recovery of these proteins from the rat brain extracts could be due to either direct or indirect interactions, the five SH3 domains were used in far-Western blotting experiments of the extracts. The SH3A domain bound synaptojanin145 and dynamin strongly, whereas weak binding was evident for SH3C and SH3E domains, and no binding was evident for the SH3B and SH3D domains (data not shown). Based on these in vitro data, we propose that Intersectin interacts with multiple components of the endocytic machinery in a manner to be defined in future experiments. We report the sequence and initial characterization of a novel protein, Intersectin, from frog, which likely serves as an scaffold protein in endocytosis. Intersectin represents the first protein reported with both EH and SH3 domains, two protein interaction modules that recognize NPF and PXXP motifs, respectively, in other proteins. Comparison of frog Intersectin to GenBank and The Institute for Genomic Research data bases has identified several cDNA entries, which are extremely similar and are likely members of a gene family. This family consists of DAP160, a protein (36Roos J. Kelly R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19108-19119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) recently identified in Drosophila melanogaster, and human Intersectin, which has recently been discovered in the human genome on chromosome 21. 4Guipponi, M., Scott, H. S., Chen, H., Schebesta, A., Rossier, C., and Antonarakis, S. E. (1998) Genomics, in press. As a means of understanding the cellular function of Intersectin, we have identified three mouse proteins (i.e. RAB/Rip, Ibp1, Ibp2) that bind to the EH domains of Intersectin. Although each of the proteins contains three or four NPF motifs, interestingly, there is a NPF at their C termini. Several lines of evidence suggest that the C-terminal motif is the major site of interaction between these proteins and Intersectin. First, removal of the C-terminal six amino acids of RAB/Rip destroyed binding to Intersectin, whereas grafting the same sequence to GST generated a strong interaction on blots. Second, a computer search of GenBank for other proteins with the same C-terminal sequence successfully predicted that the Xenopus laevismitotic phosphoprotein, MP90 (45Stukenberg P.T. Lustig K.D. McGarry T.J. King R.W. Kuang J. Kirschner M.W. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 338-348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), could bind to both EH domains of Intersectin in vitro. Third, a synthetic peptide, corresponding to the C-terminal NPF motif of RAB/Rip, competed the interaction between a peptide ligand and the EHa domain 15–25-fold better than peptides corresponding to the internal NPF motifs. Fourth, the ability of the C-terminal peptide to compete in the same assay is 7-fold better when the peptide has a free carboxylate versusa carboxamide group. Fifth, the EHa domain only binds to GST fusions bearing the NPF motif when the motif is within two residues of the carboxylate group. Thus, it appears that the free carboxylate group from the C terminus contributes to binding, much like it does for PDZ ligands (55Saras J. Heldin C.H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 455-458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Because the motif NPFXD has been independently shown to be a endocytosis signal in Saccharomyces cerevisiae(56Tan P.K. Howard J.P. Payne G.S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1789-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), it will be interesting to learn whether or not acidic amino acids can substitute for the C-terminal carboxylate in peptide ligands for EH domains. We hypothesize that Intersectin is a new component of the endocytic machinery. Sequence analysis of the three Intersectin interacting proteins (i.e. Ibp1, Ipb2, and MP90) has revealed the presence of putative clathrin-binding sites (46Goodman Jr., O.B. Krupnick J.G.

In addition, a rat protein, Epsin, which appears to be the homolog of mouse Ibp1, has been cloned very recently and shown to bind to clathrin and its adaptor, AP-2 (57Chen H. Fre S. Slepnev V. Capua M. Takei K. Butler M. Di Fiore P. De Camilli P. Nature. 1998; 394: 793-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Thus, it would appear that Intersectin has the potential to bind to clathrin-coated pits or vesicles in cells through its EH domains. Analysis of the SH3 domains of Intersectin has shown that dynamin and synaptojanin are potential interacting proteins as well. Both proteins have large proline-rich domains that have been shown to bind SH3 domain-containing proteins (21Ramjaun A.R. Micheva K.D. Bouchelet I. McPherson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16700-16706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 24Ringstad N. Nemoto Y. De Camilli P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8569-8574Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) of the endocytic machinery. Independent analysis of the SH3 domains of Dap160 has revealed that they bind dynamin and synaptojanin as well, along with several other novel proteins (36Roos J. Kelly R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19108-19119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Furthermore, immunofluorescent detection of Dap160 in neurons has revealed that the protein co-localizes with dynamin in zones of endocytosis at the membrane of the nerve terminus (36Roos J. Kelly R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19108-19119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Although it is possible that the two EH domains of Intersectin interact with different proteins, we hypothesize that the EHa domain, which appears to have stronger binding properties than the EHb domain, binds to the C termini of target proteins and that the EHb domain binds to internal NPF sites. From experiments comparing the binding properties of linear and cyclized NPF-containing peptides, we suspect that the tertiary structure of the protein strongly influences the binding of the internal NPF sites. A bivalent interaction could be quite stable due to avidity effects. Such a multivalent arrangement may be quite common, as most EH domain containing proteins have multiple EH domains, and interacting proteins may contain multiple ligand sites (58Wendland B. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 71-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). For example, synaptojanin170 has three NPF repeats that interact with the EH domains of Eps15, and this interaction may help recruit synaptojanin170 to clathrin-coated pits (27Haffner C. Takei K. Chen H. Ringstad N. Hudson A. Butler M.H. Salcini A.E. Di Fiore P.P. De Camilli P. FEBS Lett. 1997; 419: 175-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 28McPherson P.S. de Heuvel E. Phillie J. Wang W. Sengar A. Egan S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 244: 701-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). We suspect the interactions of Intersectin with dynamin and synaptojanin may also be based on multivalent interactions, because both proteins have large proline-rich domains. Future experiments will map the sites of interaction and verify that they occur in vivo. We thank Drs. Alan Wolffe (National Institutes of Health) and Doug DeSimone (University of Virginia) for cDNA libraries and Drs. Todd Stukenberg and Marc Kirschner (Harvard University) for MP90 cDNA clones.

Thus, signaling pathways involving PI 3-kinase may modulate the ERK pathway. This study examines the involvement of Ras, MEK, and ERK1 and -2 in Elk-1-mediated transcriptional activation of c-fos in response to GH and possible sensitivity of this pathway to the PI 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin. Potential roles for JNK and p38 in mediating GH-induced Elk-1 phosphorylation were also investigated. Stocks of 3T3-F442A cells were provided by Dr. H. Green (Harvard University) and Dr. M.

Lipofectamine was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc., and luciferin was from Promega. The ECL detection system and Rediprime™ kit were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. 3T3-F442A fibroblasts were grown to confluence in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 4.5 g/liter glucose and 8–9% calf serum in an atmosphere of 10% CO2/90% air at 37 °C. CHO-GHR cells were grown in Ham's-F12 medium containing 0.5 mg/ml G418 and 10% fetal calf serum in an atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% air. All media were supplemented with 1 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 μg/ml amphotericin. Prior to treatment, cells were deprived of serum for 16–18 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 4.5 g/liter glucose or Ham's F-12 medium containing 1% bovine serum albumin. Cells were preincubated with inhibitor or vehicle (Me2SO, 0.2% final concentration, or ethanol) for 1 h prior to treatment with GH or other agents. Unless otherwise indicated, the final concentration of the MEK inhibitor was 100 μm, and GH was used at a concentration of 500 ng/ml (22 nm). This concentration of GH is within the physiological range for circulating rodent GH (27Tannenbaum G.S. Martin J.B.

Alexander-Bridges, Harvard University), which were labeled with32P using a Rediprime kit from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Membranes were subjected to autoradiography and/or phosphor imaging, and quantification was performed using Multi-Analyst/PC Molecular Imager software (Bio-Rad). 3T3-F442A cells were stably transfected with a GH-responsive luciferase reporter plasmid driven by the region of the c-fos promoter from −379 to +1 with a mutation in the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein binding site (mC/E) (32Harvat B.L. Wharton W. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 955-964PubMed Google Scholar) (provided by Dr. W. Walton, Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, FL) and RSV-neo (from Dr. Nils Billestrup, Hagedorn Laboratory). Pooled clones were generated and maintained as described previously (4Liao J. Hodge C. Meyer D. Ho P.S. Rosenspire K. Schwartz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25951-25958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Cells were deprived of serum overnight and incubated with GH for 4 h. Cell lysates were prepared in reporter lysis buffer (100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.8, 0.2% Triton X-100, 1 mmdithiothreitol), and luciferase (Promega) or β-galactosidase (Tropix) activity was measured using a Wallac-Berthold Autolumat luminometer or an MGM Opticomp luminometer. Analysis of variance with factorial Scheffe F-test was used to analyze data. A value of p< 0.05 was considered significant. For control experiments, the plasmids Spi tkluc and RSV-β-gal were transiently co-transfected into CHO cells expressing GHR-(1–454), and luciferase values were measured as above. Spi tkluc containing eight copies of the spi 2.1 gene (−147/−102) upstream of a luciferase reporter gene was constructed as follows: the CAT gene was excised from Spi tkCATAn (from S. Berry, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN (33Yoon J.B. Towle H.C. Seelig S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4284-4289Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) withXhoI/SssT1, leaving the Spi tk backbone. A 2.7-kilobase pair XhoI/SstI fragment containing the luciferase gene was excised from tkluc and then ligated into the Spi tk vector backbone to create Spi tkluc. An expression-reporter system was used to measure Elk-1-mediated transcriptional activation. The expression plasmid Gal4/ElkC (34Hill C.S. Marais R. John S. Wynne J. Dalton S. Treisman R. Cell. 1993; 73: 395-406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar) encodes a fusion protein containing the Elk-1 transactivation domain fused to the Gal4 DNA binding domain. The control plasmid Gal4 (1–147) (35Ptashne M. Nature. 1988; 335: 683-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar, 36Sadowski H.B. Gilman M.Z.

The reporter plasmid, 5× Gal/Luc (37Cox A.D. Garcia A.M. Westwick J.K. Kowalczyk J.J. Lewis M.D. Brenner D.A. Der C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19203-19206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) contains five copies of the Gal4 binding site upstream of luciferase cDNA. The plasmids Gal4/ElkC and 5× Gal/Luc were provided by Dr. C. Der (University of North Carolina), and Gal4 (1–147) was received from Dr. M. Ptashne (Harvard University). CHO cells expressing GHR-(1–454) were plated on 35-mm plates and transiently co-transfected using calcium phosphate with 1 μg of Gal4/ElkC or Gal4(1–147) DNA, 1 μg of Gal/Luc DNA, and 0.1 μg of RSV β-galactosidase DNA (provided by Dr. M. Uhler, University of Michigan). At 44–48 h after transfection, cells were deprived of serum for 16–18 h and treated as indicated. Luciferase assays were performed as described above, and luciferase values from experiments evaluating transcriptional activation were normalized to β-galactosidase activity. The cDNA for Elk-1 (from Dr. R. Treisman, Imperial Cancer Research Fund, London) was inserted into the vector pcDNA3 downstream of a CMV promoter to generate CMV-Elk-1 (38Sugimoto T. Stewart S. Guan K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29415-29418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In experiments evaluating Elk-1 phosphorylation, CMV-Elk-1 or pcDNA3 was transiently transfected into CHO cells expressing GHR-(1–454) using calcium phosphate. Other plasmids were co-transfected with CMV-Elk-1 as follows. The plasmids pZIP-ras(WT), pZIP-ras(15A), and the vector pZIP-NeoSV(x)1 (39Chen S.Y. Huff S.Y. Lai C.C. Der C.J. Powers S. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2691-2698PubMed Google Scholar, 40Der C.J. Pan B.T. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 3291-3294Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) provided by Dr. C. Der (University of North Carolina) were each used at 30 μg/100-mm plate. The plasmid encoding MAP kinase phosphatase-1 (MKP-1) (41Holt K.H. Kasson B.G. Pessin J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 577-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) was from Dr. J. Pessin (University of Iowa). The CLDN vector, used as a control, was recovered by excising theEcoRI/BamHI fragment containing the MKP-1 sequence. Klenow was then used to generate blunt ends, which were ligated with T4 ligase. Both MKP-1 and CLDN were used at 5 μg/100-mm plate. 26 h after transfection, the cells were incubated in medium containing 0.5% fetal calf serum for 16 h and were then incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 4.5 g/liter glucose and 1% bovine serum albumin for 5 h prior to treatment as indicated. Cells were lysed and immunoblotted as described. Polyclonal antibodies against a peptide corresponding to residues 379–392 of Elk-1 phosphorylated on Ser-383 (α-P-Elk-1), and polyclonal antibodies against the corresponding nonphosphorylated Elk-1 peptide (αElk-1) were purchased from New England Biolabs. Antibodies to dually phosphorylated ERK1 and ERK2 (α-P-ERK), and dually phosphorylated JNK (α-P-JNK) were purchased from Promega. According to the manufacturer, the α-P-JNK antibodies cross-react with phosphorylated ERK1 and -2. Antibodies to JNK and p38 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibodies recognizing MEK1 and MAPKAP kinase-2 were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Antibodies to nonphosphorylated ERK1/ERK2 and to MEK1/MEK2 were made as described (42Zheng C.F. Guan K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19947-19952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Following treatment, cells were washed three times with PBSV buffer (10 mm Tris, 150 mmsodium phosphate, 100 μm Na3VO4, pH 7.4). For analysis of ERKs and Elk-1, cells were scraped in 0.5 ml of 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, containing 250 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml each aprotinin and leupeptin. In assays for JNK phosphorylation, cells were lysed in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5 containing 150 mmNaCl, 1.5 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, and 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg each of aprotinin and leupeptin, 100 mm NaF, and 0.5 mmNa4P2O7. Cell lysates were analyzed on 7.5% polyacrylamide gels for Elk-1, 12% polyacrylamide gels for JNK, and 5–12% gradient polyacrylamide gels for ERK1 and -2. Western blot analysis was performed as described (43Campbell G.S. Christian L.J. Carter-Su C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7427-7434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with the indicated antibodies. Enhanced chemiluminescence was used for detection. The apparent M r indicated are based on the migration of prestained molecular weight standards (Life Technologies, Inc.). Membranes were stripped by submerging them in 100 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7 at 50 °C for 30 min with shaking. MAP kinase assays were performed with myelin basic protein as substrate as described previously (16Campbell G.S. Pang L. Miyasaka T. Saltiel A.R. Carter-Su C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6074-6080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). MEK activity was measured as described previously (14VanderKuur J.A. Butch E.R. Waters S.B. Pessin J.E. Guan K.-L. Carter-Su C. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 4301-4307Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell lysates were incubated for 2 h with an antibody recognizing both MEK1 and -2 (1:1000 dilution). Immune complexes were collected on protein A-agarose during a 1-h incubation with rotation at 4 °C; washed three times with 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1% Triton X-100, 137 mm NaCl, and 2 mm EGTA; and washed once with 25 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.25% β-mercaptoethanol. The immobilized MEK preparation was then incubated with 0.3 μg of ERK/sample in kinase buffer (90 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mm magnesium acetate, and 250 μmATP) for 30 min at 30 °C. Triplicate aliquots (10 μl) of each sample were incubated with 30 μl of kinase buffer containing 20 μg of myelin basic protein and 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 30 min. Samples were spotted on p81 Whatman filter paper, washed with 1% phosphoric acid, and counted. Assays for p38 utilized its substrate MAPKAP kinase-2. Antibody to MAPKAP kinase-2 (5 μg/sample) was used for immunoprecipitation, and MAPKAP kinase-2 activity was measured in an in vitro kinase assay using MAPKAP kinase-2 substrate peptide (250 μmol/sample) as described (44Stokoe D. Caudwell B. Cohen P.T. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 843-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). JNK activity was assayed using lysates from 3T3-F442A cells that were incubated with glutathioneS-transferase-Jun (from B. Margolis, University of Michigan) complexed to glutathione beads for 3 h. Beads were washed twice with wash buffer (140 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA) and 1% Triton-100 and twice with wash buffer without Triton X-100. Beads were incubated for 20 min at 30 °C with 10 μCi/sample [γ-32P]ATP in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl, 1 mmEDTA, 40 μm ATP. They were then washed and boiled, and eluted proteins were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using a 12% polyacrylamide gel. GH has been shown to promote c-fos gene expression (2Gurland G. Ashcom G. Cochran B.H. Schwartz J. Endocrinology. 1990; 127: 3187-3195Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 45Sumantran V.N. Tsai M.-L. Schwartz J. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 2016-2024Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) as well as activation of Ras, Raf, MEK, and ERK1 and -2 in 3T3-F442A fibroblasts (14VanderKuur J.A. Butch E.R. Waters S.B. Pessin J.E. Guan K.-L. Carter-Su C. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 4301-4307Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 15Winston L.A. Bertics P.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1992; 267: 6074-6080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether the MEK/ERK pathway contributes to GH-stimulated c-fos expression, the MEK inhibitor PD098059 was used to block activation of the MEK/ERK pathway. PD098059 suppresses MEK activation by binding inactive MEK and preventing its phosphorylation by upstream kinases (46Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3242) Google Scholar). The GH-promoted increase in endogenous c-fos expression detected after 30 min (Fig. 1 A, lane 2, top) was progressively inhibited by increasing concentrations of MEK inhibitor (Fig. 1 A, lanes 3–5). When normalized to GAPDH expression, which is unaffected by GH or PD098059 treatment, expression of c-foswas attenuated an average of 31, 69, and 84% with 25, 50, and 100 μm PD098059, respectively (n = 2). To determine whether blocking MEK activation decreases GH-induced activation of the c-fos promoter, PD098050 was added to 3T3-F442A fibroblasts stably transfected with a plasmid (mC/E) containing a GH-responsive c-fos promoter fragment (−379/+1) upstream of a luciferase reporter gene (Fig. 1 B). GH produced a greater than 4-fold stimulation of reporter expression (Fig. 1 B). Pretreatment of cells with 100 μmMEK inhibitor resulted in an 80% reduction in GH-promoted transcriptional activation through the c-fos promoter (Fig. 1 B, left). This degree of reduction corresponds well with the 84% decrease in endogenous c-fos expression observed with 100 μm PD098059 (Fig. 1 A). In contrast, PD098059 did not reduce reporter expression mediated by eight tandem copies of the GH-responsive promoter of the spi 2.1 gene (Fig. 1 B, right), indicating some specificity of the MEK inhibitor for the pathway leading to expression of the c-fos promoter. The SRE, which mediates GH-promoted expression of c-fos (3Meyer D.J. Stephenson E.W. Johnson L. Cochran B.H. Schwartz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Hermann E.M. Koornneef I. Kruijer W. Kramer Y.M. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 6: 179-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). To assess whether MEK is involved in the expression of SRE-regulated genes other than c-fos, the effect of PD098059 on the expression of egr-1 and junB was examined (Fig. 2). In 3T3-F442A cells, GH stimulated expression of both egr-1 and junB (Fig. 2,A and B, top, lane 2). In two experiments in which mRNA levels were normalized to GAPDH mRNA levels, expression of egr-1 and junB was inhibited by pretreatment with PD098059 (Fig. 2,lanes 3–5). Pretreatment of cells with 50 μm PD098059 decreased GH-promoted expression of egr-1 by 35% and junB by 43%, and 100 μm PD098059 decreased the expression of egr-1by 61% and junB by 55%. To verify that PD098059 effectively blocks GH-stimulated activation of MEK and ERK, 3T3-F442A fibroblasts were preincubated with PD098059 for 1 h prior to GH addition (Fig. 3). The activity of ERK1 and -2 was assessed by Western blot analysis with an antibody (α-P-ERK) specific for dually phosphorylated, activated ERK1 and ERK2. GH treatment for 5 min increased levels of phosphorylated ERK1 and -2 (Fig. 3 A, top, lanes 4 and 5 versus lanes 2 and 3). The addition of increasing concentrations of PD098059 progressively lowered levels of dually phosphorylated ERK1 and ERK2 in GH-treated cells (Fig. 3 A, top, lanes 6–11). In five separate experiments, ERK phosphorylation was inhibited 47% with 25 μm, 77% with 50 μm, and 101% with 100 μm PD098059. Levels of nonphosphorylated ERK were not affected by treatment with PD098059 (lane 1 versus lane 2, bottom). To provide additional evidence that the MEK inhibitor attenuates GH-promoted MAP kinase activity, MAP kinase activity was directly examined in 3T3-F442A lysates using an in vitro kinase assay with myelin basic protein as substrate. GH increased MAP kinase activity almost 2-fold (Fig. 3 B). PD098059 reduced GH-stimulated MAP kinase activity at concentrations (25, 50, and 100 μm) that inhibit GH-induced phosphorylation of ERK1 and ERK2 (Fig. 3 B). PD098059 decreased basal MAP kinase activity slightly (8%, data not shown). MEK activity was measured using MEK that was immunoprecipitated from 3T3-F442A cell lysates with antibodies that recognize MEK1 and MEK2 (Fig. 3 C). MEK immunoprecipitates were used in an in vitro kinase assay containing a glutathione S-transferase-ERK fusion protein (14VanderKuur J.A. Butch E.R. Waters S.B. Pessin J.E. Guan K.-L. Carter-Su C. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 4301-4307Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and myelin basic protein. GH stimulated an 11-fold increase in MEK activity, which was reduced approximately 75% when cells were pretreated"
https://openalex.org/W2077925191,"Abstract It is now known that caspase-3-like protease activation can promote Bcl-2 cleavage and mitochondrial cytochromec release and that these events can lead to further downstream caspase activation. NO has been proposed as a potent, endogenous inhibitor of caspase-3-like protease activity. Experiments were carried out to determine whether NO could interrupt Bcl-2 cleavage or cytochrome c release by the inhibition of caspase activity linking these events. NO inhibited the capacity of purified caspase-3 to cleave recombinant Bcl-2. Both Bcl-2 cleavage and cytochrome c release were inhibited in tumor necrosis factor α- and actinomycin d-treated MCF-7 cells exposed to NO donors. The NO-mediated inhibition of Bcl-2 cleavage and cytochrome c release occurred in association with an inhibition of apoptosis and caspase-3-like activation. Thus, NO suppresses a key step in the positive feedback amplification of apoptotic signaling by preventing Bcl-2 cleavage and cytochromec release."
https://openalex.org/W2051508079,"During late stages of breast cancer progression, tumors frequently acquire steroid hormone resistance with concurrent amplification of growth factor receptors; this alteration predicts a poor prognosis. We show here that following treatment with the progestin, R5020, breast cancer cells undergo a “biochemical shift” in the regulation of epidermal growth factor (EGF)-stimulated signaling pathways: R5020 potentiates the effects of EGF by up-regulating EGFR, c-ErbB2 and c-ErbB3 receptors, and by enhancing EGF-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of signaling molecules known to associate with activated type I receptors. Independently of EGF, R5020 increases Stat5 protein levels, association of Stat5 with phosphotyrosine-containing proteins, and tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK2 and Shc. Furthermore, progestins “prime” breast cancer cells for growth signals by potentiating EGF-stimulated p42/p44 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), p38 MAP kinase, and JNK activities. Although the levels of cyclin D1, cyclin E, and p21WAF1, are up-regulated by R5020 alone, they are synergistically up-regulated by EGF in the presence of R5020. Up-regulation of cell cycle proteins by EGF is blocked by inhibition of p42/p44 MAPK only in the presence of R5020, supporting a shift in the regulation of these cell cycle mediators from MAPK-independent to MAPK-dependent pathways. In summary, progesterone selectively increases the sensitivity of key kinase cascades to growth factors, thereby priming cells for stimulation by latent growth signals. These data support a model in which breast cancer cell growth switches from steroid hormone to growth factor dependence.

Estradiol and progesterone are involved in breast cancer development, but at the time of diagnosis only one-third of tumors are steroid hormone-dependent. As they progress, these tumors often acquire steroid hormone resistance, yet retain nuclear steroid receptors. Indeed, nuclear receptor loss or mutation accounts for only 10–20% of steroid hormone-resistant tumors (1Encarnacion C.A. Ciocca S.R. McGuire W.L. Clark G.M. Fuqua S.A.W. Osborne C.K. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1993; 26: 237-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Thus, it has been postulated that in the majority of resistant tumors, control over growth is assumed by locally acting autocrine or paracrine peptide growth factors. As a result, invasive cancers with the worst prognosis are those that are growth factor receptor positive and steroid hormone resistant (2Elledge R.M. McGuire W.L. Osborne C.K. Semin.

Growth factors regulate cell growth by activating intracellular signal transduction pathways after binding to high affinity tyrosine kinase receptors on the cell surface. Steroid hormone receptors are ligand-activated nuclear transcription factors. Herein, we sought to understand how these two separate pathways converge to regulate breast cancer cell growth. The mechanisms by which growth factors stimulate cell proliferation are complex. Growth factors induce receptor dimerization and activation of intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity. Autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues located in the cytoplasmic domain of the receptors stimulates binding of specific regulatory proteins via their SH21 and SH3 domains, which then activate Ras, triggering downstream protein Ser/Thr kinase cascades (Fig. 1, reviewed in Refs. 3Blenis J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5889-5892Crossref PubMed Scopus (1158) Google Scholar and 4Crews C.M. Erikson R.L. Cell. 1993; 74: 215-217Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Specifically, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) stimulation by either EGF or transforming growth factor-α leads to Ras activation. Ras simultaneously activates cytoplasmic Ser/Thr protein kinases from both the MEK kinase (MEKK) and Raf families (5Lange-Carter C.A. Johnson G.L. Science. 1994; 265: 1458-1461Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). MEKK and Raf can independently phosphorylate and activate a unique class of dual specificity Ser/Thr-Tyr kinases known as MAPK kinases (MEKs/MKKs), leading to activation of a family of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) (6Lange-Carter C.A. Pleiman C.M. Gardner A.M. Blumer K.J. Johnson G.L. Science. 1993; 260: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar). Expression of activated MEKK has been shown to lead to selective activation of a MAPK-related protein kinase, termed Jun kinase (JNK), also known as stress-activated protein kinase (7Minden A. Lin A. McMahon M. Lange-Carter C. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Johnson G.L. Karin M. Science. 1994; 266: 1719-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar). Isoforms of JNK, and a more recently described MAPK termed p38, are activated in response to stress, such as UV-irradiation and heat shock (8Derijard B. Hibi M. Wu I.H. Barrett T. Su B. Deng T. Karin M. Davis R.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 1025-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2955) Google Scholar, 9Kyriakis J.M. Banerjee P. Nikolakaki E. Dai T. Rubie E.A. Ahmad M.F. Avruch J. Woodgett J.R. Nature. 1994; 369: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (2413) Google Scholar, 10Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24313-24316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar). Like MEKK, Raf, and MAPK, however, p38 and JNK are also activated in response to growth factors, including EGF. One consequence of activation of MAP kinase cascades is the modulation of the phosphorylation state, and thus the activity of several nuclear transcription factors that in turn regulate genes (3Blenis J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5889-5892Crossref PubMed Scopus (1158) Google Scholar, 4Crews C.M. Erikson R.L. Cell. 1993; 74: 215-217Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). The various MAPK family members play a complex role in the determination of cell growth, differentiation, and programmed cell death; the cellular decision is thought to involve a balance among competing MAPK pathways (11Denhardt D.T. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 729-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). EGFR signaling is also mediated by signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs), which, following phosphotyrosine-dependent dimerization, bypass classical kinase cascades, and enter the nucleus to regulate genes directly (12Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3377) Google Scholar). Little is known about the role of steroid hormones in modulating either the MAPK or STAT pathways. EGF is a major regulator of breast cancers that have become steroid hormone-resistant. EGFR (c-ErbB1) expression is significantly associated with the loss of steroid hormone sensitivity in breast cancer (13Nicholson R.I. McClelland R.A. Gee J.M. Manning D.L. Cannon P. Robertson J.F. Ellis I.O. Blamey R.W. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1994; 29: 117-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), and correlates with high disease recurrence rates and decreased patient survival. The HER-2/Neu (c-ErbB2) oncogene shares extensive homology with EGFR, suggesting that these receptors, although distinct, signal via similar mechanisms. The Neu receptor is stimulated by a family of closely related growth factors called heregulins or Neu differentiation factors that are present in breast cancer cell-conditioned medium and in serum (14Lupu R. Cardillo M. Cho C. Harris L. Hijazi M. Perez C. Rosenberg K. Yang D. Tang C. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1996; 38: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Gene amplification of c-ErbB2 receptors is one of the most common occurrences in breast cancers (15Dickson R.B. Lippman M.E. Cellular and Molecular Biology of Breast Cancer. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Boston1992Google Scholar) and is also correlated with shortened survival (2Elledge R.M. McGuire W.L. Osborne C.K. Semin. Oncol. 1992; 19: 244-253PubMed Google Scholar). Heterodimerization between EGFR and c-ErbB2 receptors is induced by EGF, and these heterodimers exhibit highly increased affinity for EGF compared with EGFR homodimers (16Wada T. Qian X.L. Greene M.I. Cell. 1990; 61: 1339-1347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Additional members of the type I growth factor receptor family include the less well defined c-ErbB3 and c-ErbB4 receptors, which are also expressed in breast cancer (17Rajkumar T. Gullick W.J. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1994; 29: 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). These receptors differ most in their C-terminal intracellular domains, predicting differences in signal transduction elicited by each receptor subtype. For example, the c-ErbB3 receptor has very weak intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity compared with the other three family members (18Gullick W.J. Cancer Surv. 1996; 27: 339-349PubMed Google Scholar). However, each receptor can engage in heterodimer formation with all other family members, presumably leading to activation of selected downstream signaling pathways (19Pinkas-Kramarski R. Soussan L. Waterman H. Levkowitz G. Alroy I. Klapper L. Lavi S. Seger R. Ratzkin B.J. Sela M. Yarden Y. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2452-2467Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). Several studies have documented transcriptional and/or proliferative synergy between EGF and progesterone or estrogens (20Modiano J.F. Kokai Y. Weiner D.B. Pykett M.J. Nowell P.C. Lyttle C.R. J. Cell. Biochem. 1991; 45: 196-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 21Krusekopf S. Chauchereau A. Milgrom E. Henderson D. Cato A.C. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1991; 40: 239-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and have shown that progesterone up-regulates EGFR expression on the cell surface (20Modiano J.F. Kokai Y. Weiner D.B. Pykett M.J. Nowell P.C. Lyttle C.R. J. Cell. Biochem. 1991; 45: 196-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 22Murphy L.J. Sutherland R.L. Stead B. Murphy L.C. Lazarus L. Cancer Res. 1986; 46: 728-734PubMed Google Scholar, 23Chrysogelos S.A. Dickson R.B. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1994; 29: 29-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 24Sarup J.C. Rao K.V. Fox C.F. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 5071-5078PubMed Google Scholar). For example, progestins but not estrogens, androgens, or glucocorticoids cause a 2–3-fold increase in EGFR number (22Murphy L.J. Sutherland R.L. Stead B. Murphy L.C. Lazarus L. Cancer Res. 1986; 46: 728-734PubMed Google Scholar) and a 6-fold increase in EGF mRNA levels (25Murphy L.C. Murphy L.J. Dubik D. Bell G.I. Shiu R.P. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 4555-4560PubMed Google Scholar) in human breast cancer cells. In addition to increasing high affinity EGFR numbers, progesterone effects the phosphorylation state of EGF and c-ErbB2 receptors; in the presence of phosphatase inhibitors, phosphorylation of both receptors is increased severalfold by progesterone (20Modiano J.F. Kokai Y. Weiner D.B. Pykett M.J. Nowell P.C. Lyttle C.R. J. Cell. Biochem. 1991; 45: 196-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Progesterone receptor (PR) levels are reportedly down-regulated by EGF, as measured by equilibrium progesterone binding studies (24Sarup J.C. Rao K.V. Fox C.F. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 5071-5078PubMed Google Scholar), indicating bi-directional effects of each agent on the receptor of the other. Up-regulation of EGFR by progesterone in conjunction with down-regulation of PR by EGF suggests the existence of a regulatory loop in which loss of steroid hormone responsiveness parallels gain of growth factor-dependent proliferation, as is observed during breast tumor progression (13Nicholson R.I. McClelland R.A. Gee J.M. Manning D.L. Cannon P. Robertson J.F. Ellis I.O. Blamey R.W. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1994; 29: 117-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 14Lupu R. Cardillo M. Cho C. Harris L. Hijazi M. Perez C. Rosenberg K. Yang D. Tang C. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1996; 38: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Indeed, we have recently demonstrated that progesterone pretreatment sensitizes T47D breast cancer cells to the proliferative effects of EGF (26Groshong S.D. Owen G.I. Grimison B. Schauer I.E. Todd M.C. Langan T.A. Sclafani R.A. Lange C.A. Horwitz K.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1593-1607Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). We therefore sought to define the molecular mechanisms involved in cross-talk between progesterone- and EGF-mediated signaling. Our data demonstrate that these two signaling pathways are integrated; progesterone enhances the effects of EGF in breast cancer cells via selective amplification of signaling cascades that are activated by type I growth factor receptors. Monoclonal PR-negative T47D-Y breast cancer cells and T47D-YB cells stably expressing the PR B-receptors were previously described (27Sartorius C.A. Groshong S.D. Miller L.A. Powell R.L. Tung L. Takimoto G.S. Horwitz K.B. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3868-3877PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were routinely seeded at 1 × 106 cells/dish, cultured in 10-cm dishes, and incubated in 5% CO2 at 37 °C in a humidified environment as described (27Sartorius C.A. Groshong S.D. Miller L.A. Powell R.L. Tung L. Takimoto G.S. Horwitz K.B. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3868-3877PubMed Google Scholar). For signal transduction experiments in which cells were treated with EGF (30 ng/ml) or heregulin (10 ng/ml), cultures were placed in serum-free media for 16–18 h prior to growth factor addition. Antibodies for type I growth factor receptors (c-ErbB2 and c-erbB3) were obtained from NeoMarkers (Fremont, CA). EGFR antiserum was kindly provided by Roger Davis (Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Univeristy of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA). Anti-phosphotyrosine (4G10) monoclonal antibody, and STAT5, JAK2, p70S6K, and cyclin D1 polyclonal antisera were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY); Cbl and p21WAF1 antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA); Shc antiserum was from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY); phospho-specific and total MAPK antisera, phospho-specific p38, JNK, and AKT polyclonal antisera, and the MEK1 inhibitor (PD98059) were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA); cyclin E polyclonal antiserum was from Pharmingen (San Diego, CA). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Bio-Rad. Human recombinant EGF was purchased from Collaborative Biomedical Products (Bedford, MA). R5020 was obtained from NEN Life Science Products Inc. (Boston, MA). Cells growing on 10-cm dishes were washed with 5 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed by scraping in 1 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 2 mmMgCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol) supplemented with protease inhibitors (1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 20 μg/ml aprotinin). Cells in lysis buffer were further broken by passing the lysate through a 26-gauge needle, 6 times. Nuclei were cleared from the lysates by centrifugation at 1,000 rpm in a refrigerated Microfuge for 5 min. The pellet was discarded and membranes contained in the supernatant were collected by centrifugation for an additional 30 min at 15,000 rpm. The supernatant was discarded and the resulting membrane pellet was resuspended in 100–200 μl of lysis buffer and sheared through a 28-gauge needle, 6 times. Protein concentrations in each lysate were determined using the Bradford reagent and equal amounts of protein were loaded onto 8% SDS-PAGE gels and subjected to protein immunoblotting. Cells in 10-cm dishes were washed twice with 4 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed by scraping in extraction buffer (EB: 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm sodium fluoride, aprotinin (20 μg/ml), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 mm Na3VO4). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation for 10 min at maximum speed and equal amounts of soluble protein (1 mg/ml) were immunoprecipitated with anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody (4G10; 4 μg/mg protein) by constant rotation at 4 °C for 2 h to overnight. Immuno complexes were captured by adding 30 μl of washed protein A (insoluble formalin-fixed Staph-A derived sorbin; Sigma) that had been preincubated with rabbit anti-mouse antibody. Protein-sorbin containing reactions were incubated by constant rotation at 4 °C for an additional 2 h and then collected by centrifugation at 8,000–10,000 × g for 3 min. Immunoprecipitates (pellets) were washed once in EB (1 ml), twice in PAN (10 mm PIPES (pH 7.0), 100 mm NaCl, and 20 μg/ml aprotinin) containing 0.25% Nonidet P-40, and twice in PAN without Nonidet P-40. Washed pellets were resuspended in 60 μl of PAN and 30 μl of 3 times Laemmli sample buffer, boiled for 3 min, and subjected to 8% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. For detection of activated kinases, cells on 10-cm dishes were washed twice in 4 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and lysed by scraping in EB as described above. For detection of nuclear proteins (p21WAF1, cyclin D1, and cyclin E), cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% (w/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 1% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 200 μmNa3VO4, 0.1% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation for 10 min at maximum speed in a refrigerated Microfuge. Soluble protein in clarified lysates was quantified using the Bradford reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) and equal amounts of protein were loaded onto SDS-PAGE gels (10% for MAP kinases; 12% for p21WAF1 and cyclins) and subjected to immunoblotting. Because progestins can sensitize T47D breast cancer cells to the proliferative effects of EGF (26Groshong S.D. Owen G.I. Grimison B. Schauer I.E. Todd M.C. Langan T.A. Sclafani R.A. Lange C.A. Horwitz K.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1593-1607Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), and are known to increase expression of EGFR in certain breast cancer cell lines (22Murphy L.J. Sutherland R.L. Stead B. Murphy L.C. Lazarus L. Cancer Res. 1986; 46: 728-734PubMed Google Scholar,24Sarup J.C. Rao K.V. Fox C.F. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 5071-5078PubMed Google Scholar, 25Murphy L.C. Murphy L.J. Dubik D. Bell G.I. Shiu R.P. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 4555-4560PubMed Google Scholar), we tested the effects of the progestin, R5020, on the expression of members of the type I growth factor receptor family in PR-positive T47D-YB cells and their PR-negative T47D-Y progenitors (27Sartorius C.A. Groshong S.D. Miller L.A. Powell R.L. Tung L. Takimoto G.S. Horwitz K.B. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3868-3877PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). T47D-YB cells were treated with a single dose of R5020 (20 nm) or vehicle for 0–72 h and the levels of EGFR, c-ErbB2, or c-ErbB3 receptors in purified membrane preparations were determined by Western blotting using specific antisera (Fig. 2 A). R5020 increased the expression of all three receptors, beginning at 8 h for EGFR, and 24 h for c-ErbB2 and c-ErbB3 receptors. Peak levels, reached between 36 and 48 h, ranged from 18–20-fold over controls for EGFR, 11–14-fold for c-ErbB2, and 8–10-fold for c-ErbB3 over several independent experiments (Fig. 2 B). c-ErbB4 receptor levels did not change in response to R5020 (not shown). Surprisingly, while EGFR were unresponsive to R5020 treatment in the PR-negative T47D-Y cells, the progestin increased both c-ErbB2 and c-ErbB3 levels in these cells by 2–3- and 3–4-fold, respectively, at 48 h (Fig. 2 C). Nongenomic effects of progesterone are well described (28Wasserman W.J. Pinto L.H. O'Connor C.M. Smith L.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 1534-1536Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 29Waldegger S. Beisse F. Apfel H. Breit S. Kolb H.A. Haussinger D. Lang F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1266: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 30Turner K.O. Meizel S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 213: 774-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 31Baldi E. Krausz C. Forti G. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1995; 265: 1376-1380Google Scholar), although their underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Since progesterone increases the levels of type I growth factor receptors, we asked whether intracellular signals originating at activated tyrosine kinase receptors were also amplified by progesterone. T47D-YB cells were treated or not with R5020 for 48 h to up-regulate type I receptors. Phosphotyrosine-containing proteins were then immunoprecipitated from control or EGF-stimulated (5 min) cells and visualized with phosphotyrosine (Tyr(P)) antisera (Fig. 3 A). R5020 pretreatment, followed by short-term (3–5 min) EGF treatment, increased the tyrosine phosphorylation of several signaling proteins known to associate with activated tyrosine kinase receptors (compare lanes 2 and 4), including the SH2/SH3 domain-containing proteins, Cbl (reviewed in Ref. 32Langdon W.Y. Aust. N. Z. J. Med. 1995; 25: 859-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and p66 and p52 isoforms of Shc (reviewed in Ref. 33Bonfini L. Migliaccio E. Pelicci G. Lanfrancone L. Pelicci P.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 257-261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). To confirm this, proteins present in Tyr(P) immunoprecipitates were independently identified using specific antisera (Fig. 3 B). As shown, tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGFR, Cbl, and p52 and p46 Shc isoforms was dependent on receptor stimulation by EGF, but was greatly increased in R5020-pretreated cells (Fig. 3, A and B). The p66 Shc isoform was weakly detected in Shc immunoblots of Tyr(P) immunoprecipitates (not shown), but clearly visible in Tyr(P) Western blots (Fig. 3 A). p66 Shc was weakly, but reproducibly phosphorylated by R5020 alone (lane 3). R5020 alone does not affect the levels of total Cbl or Shc proteins in T47D-YB cells, as indicated by immunoblotting of whole cell lysates (Fig. 3 C). Thus, in the presence of R5020, these proteins undergo increased phosphorylation on tyrosine, without changes in expression levels. The increased presence of signaling molecules in Tyr(P) immunoprecipitates from cells treated with both R5020 and EGF (Fig. 3, A and B, lane 4) suggests that up-regulated type I receptors are functional and that concentrations of downstream components of the signaling pathway are not limiting. Additionally, a Tyr(P)-containing protein of approximately 120 kDa was present in Tyr(P) immunoprecipitates from cells treated either with R5020 alone, or with EGF. This band was subsequently identified as the soluble protein tyrosine kinase, JAK2 (Fig. 3 A, lane 3). We therefore tested Tyr(P) immunoblots for Stat5, a downstream effector of JAK2 (Fig. 3 B). Stat5 is activated by cytokines and growth factors in a variety of cell types (12Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3377) Google Scholar), and is particularly important during breast tissue development (34Liu X. Robinson G.W. Wagner K.U. Garrett L. Wynshaw-Boris A. Hennighausen L. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar, 35Udy G.B. Towers R.P. Snell R.G. Wilkins R.J. Park S.H. Ram P.A. Waxman D.J. Davey H.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7239-7244Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Stat5 was present in Tyr(P) immunoprecipitates not only from cells treated with EGF (lane 2), but also from cells treated with R5020 alone (lane 3); the effects of both treatments together were additive (lane 4). Thus, progesterone can activate JAK2 independently of exogenously added growth factors and leads to the association of Stat5 with phosphotyrosine-containing proteins (Fig. 3 B). Regulation of STAT proteins by progestins is addressed in the accompanying report (36Richer J.K. Lange C.A. Manning N.G. Owen G. Powell R. Horwitz K.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31317-31326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Progesterone did not increase Tyr(P)-containing proteins present in Tyr(P) immunoprecipitations from EGF-treated PR-negative T47D-Y cells, or from T47D-YB cells treated with the PR antagonist, RU486, indicating that R5020-induced changes in Tyr(P)-containing proteins are PR-dependent (not shown). The up-regulation of type I receptors and increased tyrosine phosphorylation of several signaling molecules by progesterone suggested that the cells may be sensitized to the actions of growth factors by the steroid hormone. To test this, we examined the activation of MAP kinase family members. T47D-YB cells were pretreated with R5020 for 48 h and then treated for 5–120 min with either EGF (Fig. 4 A) or the 1B isoform of heregulin, a family of ligands known to act directly on both c-ErbB3 and c-ErbB4 receptors, and indirectly on c-ErbB2 receptors via heterodimerization (37Carraway III, K.L. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1994; 78: 5-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar, 38Earp H.S. Dawson T.L. Li X. Yu H. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1995; 35: 115-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4 B). The activity of the classical MAPKs, p42 and p44, was determined by immunoblotting whole cell extracts with highly specific antisera for the active, Thr/Tyr-phosphorylated forms of p42 and p44 MAPK (39Sturgill T.W. Ray L.B. Erikson E. Maller J.L. Nature. 1988; 334: 715-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). A separate antiserum against total MAPK was used to visualize both the active and inactive forms; phosphorylation/activation causes a slight up-shift in MAPK mobility measured using the anti-total MAPK serum (Fig. 4 A). While long-term treatment with R5020 alone had little or no effect on MAPK activity, pretreatment with the progestin greatly increased the ability of EGF to stimulate MAPK activity. Specifically, in R5020-pretreated cells, EGF (5 min) caused a 16–20-fold increase in p42 activity and a 2.5–6-fold increase in p44 activity above that stimulated by EGF alone, as measured by densitometry of independent immunoblots. In contrast, the relative abundance of total MAPK remained essentially unchanged by all the treatment regimens. Compared with EGF, the activity of MAPK in response to heregulin was minimally affected by R5020 (Fig. 4 B). At most, R5020 increased p42 MAPK activity in response to heregulin at 30 and 120 min by 2–4-fold. R5020 pretreatment did not affect the magnitude of MAPK activation by either EGF or heregulin in T47D-Y cells, which lack detectable PR (Fig. 4 C). Although activation of the MAPK-related enzymes, p38 and JNK, by stress-producing agents and growth factors including EGF has been well documented (8Derijard B. Hibi M. Wu I.H. Barrett T. Su B. Deng T. Karin M. Davis R.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 1025-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2955) Google Scholar, 9Kyriakis J.M. Banerjee P. Nikolakaki E. Dai T. Rubie E.A. Ahmad M.F. Avruch J. Woodgett J.R. Nature. 1994; 369: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (2413) Google Scholar) the role of these kinases in the determination of cellular responses to these agents remains controversial (10Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24313-24316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar) and effects of steroid hormones on the activity of these enzymes have not been described. To determine if progesterone can alter the ability of EGF to stimulate p38s and JNKs (several isoforms exist), T47D-YB cells were pretreated with R5020 for 48 h and then treated with EGF for 5–30 min (Fig. 5 A). R5020 markedly increased the activation of the p38 kinase in response to EGF; the activity of JNK isoforms 1 and 2 were also modestly increased by R5020. Thus, in independent experiments, R5020 enhanced the ability of EGF to activate p38 MAP kinase 6–8-fold, and JNK 3–4-fold, above that in EtOH/EGF-treated controls (15 min). In contrast to activ"

This report describes a general strategy for engineering the display of chemically defined oligosaccharides on cell surfaces that combines the concepts of metabolic engineering and selective chemical reactivity. Using a recently described method (Mahal, L. K., Yarema, K. J., and Bertozzi, C. R. (1997) Science 276, 1125–1128), we delivered a uniquely reactive ketone group to endogenous cell surface sialic acid residues by treating cells with the ketone-bearing metabolic precursor N-levulinoylmannosamine (ManLev). The ketone undergoes highly selective condensation reactions with complementary nucleophiles such as aminooxy and hydrazide groups. The detailed quantitative parameters of ManLev metabolism in human and nonhuman-derived cell lines were determined to establish a foundation for the modification of cell surfaces with novel epitopes at defined cell-surface densities. Ketones within the glycoconjugates on ManLev-treated cells were then reacted with synthetic aminooxy and hydrazide-functionalized carbohydrates. The remodeled cells were endowed with novel lectin binding profiles as determined by flow cytometry analysis. The simplicity and generality of this method make it well suited for use in the study of carbohydrate-mediated cell surface interactions. The development of chemical strategies for decorating cells with defined carbohydrate epitopes would greatly facilitate studies of carbohydrate-mediated cell surface interactions. This report describes a general strategy for engineering the display of chemically defined oligosaccharides on cell surfaces that combines the concepts of metabolic engineering and selective chemical reactivity. Using a recently described method (Mahal, L. K., Yarema, K. J., and Bertozzi, C. R.

It has been known for several decades that the cell surface is richly decorated with a dense covering of complex oligosaccharides. Even before many of the specific biological functions of these carbohydrates were elucidated, it was apparent that remodeling the molecular landscape of the cell surface transformed the behavior of cells (1Atkinson P.H. Hakimi J. Alterations in Glycoproteins of the Cell Surface. Plenum Press, New York1980Crossref Google Scholar, 2Hynes R.O. Cell. 1974; 1: 147-156Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The discovery of their participation in cell-cell recognition events has brought cell surface glycoconjugates to the forefront of biological research in recent years. Numerous cell surface oligosaccharides have been sequenced and their interactions with receptors on opposing cells are understood in some molecular detail (3Feizi T. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 701-710Crossref Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 4Carver J.P. Pure Appl. Chem. 1993; 65: 763-770Crossref Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 5Dwek R.A.

U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12086-12093Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the interactions of cell surface oligosaccharides with protein receptors in solution and on opposing cells remain difficult to study at the molecular level in comparison to protein-protein interactions on cell surfaces. The lag in carbohydrate research can be attributed, in part, to the difficulty in controlling the presentation of well defined carbohydrate epitopes on cell surfaces (for a perspective, see Ref. 8Yarema K.J. Bertozzi C.R. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1998; 2: 49-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). While cell surface oligosaccharide structures can be conservatively altered by the introduction, overexpression, or deletion of genes encoding specific glycosyltransferases (9Stanley P. Ioffe E.

A. 1995; 92: 8670-8674Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), the complexities of oligosaccharide biosynthesis impose some limitations on the use of genetic methods for modulating the structures of cell surface oligosaccharides. As a consequence, alternative methods for decorating cells with chemically defined oligosaccharides are the subject of much recent attention (18Mahal L.K. Bertozzi C.R. Chem. Biol. 1997; 4: 415-422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Owing to advances in methodology for the chemical and enzymatic synthesis of oligosaccharides during the last two decades, virtually any oligosaccharide structure is now accessible in chemical quantities and in homogeneous form. Therefore, methods for modulating the display of cell surface oligosaccharides that exploit the availability of synthetic molecules are increasingly valuable tools for biological research. An appealing strategy for controlling the display of oligosaccharide epitopes on cell surfaces is through the selective covalent attachment of chemically defined carbohydrate structures onto native glycoconjugates. One of the earliest examples of this approach, reported by Tolvanen and Gahmberg (19Tolvanen M. Gahmberg C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9546-9551Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Gahmberg C.G. Tolvanen M. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 32-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), involved the treatment of cells with the mild oxidant sodium periodate to introduce aldehyde groups onto native oligosaccharides. The aldehydes were then condensed with glycosylhydrazines derived from treatment of free sugars with anhydrous hydrazine. Although the glycosylhydrazone products were released from the cells by glycosidic bond hydrolysis after several hours, the adducts were sustained long enough to perform lectin binding studies. With the aim of avoiding chemical reagents and oxidants that might harm cells, Palcic and co-workers (21Srivastava G. Kaur K.J. Hindsgaul O. Palcic M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22356-22361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Tsuboi S. Isogai Y. Hada N. King J.K. Hindsgaul O. Fukuda M. J. Biol.

Synthetic analogs of GDP-fucose bearing additional carbohydrates appended to C-6 were enzymatically transferred by the enzyme onto cells expressing suitable glycosyl acceptor sites. Here we report an alternative approach to cell surface glycoform engineering that involves the introduction of a uniquely reactive functional group into cell surface glycoconjugates using endogenous metabolic processes (27Bernacki R.J. Korytnyk W. Horowitz M.I. The Glycoconjugates. IV. Academic Press, New York1982: 245-263Crossref Google Scholar, 28Schultz A.M. Mora P.T. Carbohydr.

Bernacki R.J. Sharma M. Dodson-Simmons O. Korytnyk W. Carbohydr. Res. 1995; 276: 99-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The unique functional group is then chemically elaborated with synthetic carbohydrate epitopes of defined structure. The highly selective condensation reactions of aminooxy or hydrazide groups with ketones, affording the corresponding oximes or hydrazones, are well suited for this strategy as these functional groups are chemically orthogonal to native cell surface moieties (23Muir T.W. Structure. 1995; 3: 649-652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 24Lemieux, G. A., and Bertozzi, C. R. (1998) Trends Biotech., in pressGoogle Scholar, 25Rotenberg S.A.

Cerami A. Science. 1986; 232: 1629-1632Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we exploited the intrinsic substrate promiscuity of the enzymes in the sialoside biosynthetic pathway (32Kayser H. Zeitler R. Kannicht C. Grunow D. Nuck R. Reutter W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16934-16938Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Keppler O.T. Stehling P. Herrmann M. Kayser H. Grunow D. Reutter W. Pawlita M. J. Biol.

Virol. 1997; 71: 5922-5931Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) for the delivery of ketones into endogenous cell surface glycoconjugates. We have recently shown that N-levulinoylmannosamine (ManLev),1 an unnatural derivative of ManNAc, is converted to N-levulinoyl sialic acid (SiaLev) in human cell lines, resulting in the expression of chemically accessible ketones within cell surface glycoconjugates (Fig. 1) (35Mahal L.K. Yarema K.J. Bertozzi C.R. Science. 1997; 276: 1125-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). The detailed quantitative parameters of ManLev metabolism are presented in this report, along with application to the cell surface glycoform engineering strategy depicted schematically in Fig. 1. Carbohydrates bearing either an aminooxy or hydrazide group were condensed with ketone groups endogenous to unnatural sialic acid residues on ManLev-treated cells, and the remodeled cells gained the ability to bind a lectin specific for the attached epitopes. Tunicamycin, benzyl 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-α-d-galactopyranoside (α-BnGalNAc), FITC-labeled avidin, biotin hydrazide (BH), demecolcine, colchicine, camptothecin, sodium azide, trypsin-EDTA, and sialidase (Clostridium perfringes, Type V) were purchased from Sigma. RPMI 1640 media was from Life Technologies, Inc., DME media was from CellGro, FCS and newborn calf serum were from Hyclone or BioWhittaker, and penicillin-streptomycin (P/S) was from Fisher. All reagents used in chemical syntheses were obtained from commercial suppliers and were used without further purification. NMR spectra were recorded on Bruker AMX-400 or AMX-300 spectrometers, mass spectral data were obtained at the University of California Berkeley Mass Spectrometry Facility, and combustion analyses were obtained at the University of California Berkeley Microanalytical Facility. To a solution of levulinic acid (2.85 ml, 27.8 mmol) in anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (77 ml) was added 4.2 ml of triethylamine (30.2 mmol). The mixture was stirred at room temperature under N2. After 30 min, 3.31 ml (25.5 mmol) of isobutyl chloroformate were added dropwise by syringe. The reaction was stirred under N2 for 3 h during which time a white precipitate formed. The crude levulinic acid isobutyl carbonic anhydride was used directly in the next step. To a solution of 5.00 g (23.2 mmol) of mannosamine hydrochloride in 154 ml of 5:4 H2O/tetrahydrofuran was added 3.6 ml (25.5 mmol) of triethylamine. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 5 min, after which the crude solution of levulinic acid isobutyl carbonic anhydride was added dropwise. After 24 h, the solvent was removedin vacuo.

The mixture was stirred at room temperature under a N2 atmosphere. After 30 min, 1.80 ml (14 mmol) of isobutyl chloroformate was added dropwise by syringe. The reaction was stirred under N2 for 5 h during which time a white precipitate formed. The crude product was used directly in the next step. To a solution of 3.0 g (14 mmol) of glucosamine hydrochloride in 70 ml of 4:3 H2O/tetrahydrofuran was added 2.7 ml (15 mmol) of diisopropylethylamine. The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 1 h, after which the crude solution of levulinic acid isobutyl carbonic anhydride was added dropwise by syringe. After 22 h, the solvent was removed in vacuo.

The compound was characterized as a mixture of anomers; 1H NMR (300 MHz, D2O): δ 2.19 (s, 6), 2.50–2.54 (m, 4), 2.81–2.90 (m, 4), 3.40–3.89 (m, 12), 4.68 (d, 1, J = 8.2 Hz), 5.14 (d, 1, J = 3.4 Hz); 13C NMR (100 MHz): δ 29.2, 29.3, 29.6, 38.2, 54.0, 56.7, 60.8, 60.6, 70.1, 70.6, 71.6, 73.8, 75.9, 90.9, 94.9, 175.6, 213.9; high resolution mass spectrum (FAB+) calculated for C11H20NO7 (MH+) 278.1240, found 278.1238. A solution of peracetylated β-O-allyl lactose (1.0 g, 1.5 mmol) in 15 ml of acetone was cooled to −78 °C and ozone gas was bubbled through the solution until it was saturated. The solution was then purged with N2 for 5.0 min and Jones' reagent (2.0m CrO3/H2SO4 in H2O) was added until an orange color persisted. The reaction was warmed to room temperature, and after 1.5 h ethanol (6.0 ml) was added to quench the excess oxidant. The reaction mixture was filtered and the eluate was diluted with ethyl acetate. The solution was washed with copious amounts of saturated NaHCO3. The aqueous layers were combined, acidified to pH 3.0, and extracted with CH2Cl2. The organic layer was dried over MgSO4 and the solvent was removedin vacuo to afford 0.54 g (52%) of the corresponding carboxylic acid. Without further purification, a solution of the acid (0.480 g, 0.692 mmol) in dry CH2Cl2 (6.9 ml) and anhydrous diisopropylethylamine (four drops) was treated with oxalyl chloride (66 μl, 0.761 mmol). The reaction mixture was stirred under N2 for 4.0 h at which time an additional 66 μl of oxalyl chloride was added. After 2.5 h, the solvent was removedin vacuo affording the crude acid chloride as a yellow foam. The acid chloride was dissolved in 7.0 ml of CH2Cl2 and hydrazine hydrate (0.325 ml, 10.4 mmol) was added to the solution. The reaction was stirred overnight and another 0.700 ml of hydrazine hydrate was added. The reaction was stirred for 2.0 days after which the solvent was removed in vacuo. The product, Lac-NHNH2, was purified by high performance liquid chromatography on an aminopropyl silica gel column eluting with a gradient of water (0–50% over 70 min) in acetonitrile to yield 0.188 g (65%) as a white solid; R F = 0.28 (5:3:2 BuOH/AcOH/H2O); 1H NMR (400 MHz, D2O): δ 3.34–3.83 (m, 10), 3.88 (app. d, 1,J = 3.2), 3.93 (dd, 1, J = 2.1, 12.3), 4.26 (d, 1, J = 15.3), 4.38 (d, 1, J = 15.3), 4.42 (d, 1, J = 7.8), 4.49 (d, 1,J = 7.9); 13C NMR (100 MHz): δ 60.0, 61.1, 67.7, 68.6, 71.0, 72.6, 72.7, 74.2, 75.0, 75.4, 78.2, 102.4, 103.0, 170.5. FAB-MS calculated for C14H27O12N2, 415; found: 415 (M+H). Unless otherwise specified, Jurkat cells were grown in RPMI 1640 media supplemented with 5.0% FCS, 100 unit/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin (P/S), HL-60 cells, D1B, and S49 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 media supplemented with 10% FCS and P/S, and COS-7 and HeLa cells were grown in DME media supplemented with 10% FCS and P/S. In all cases, cells were incubated in a 5.0% carbon dioxide, water-saturated incubator at 37 °C. Typically, cells were grown in 6-well polystyrene tissue culture plates, seeded at cell densities between 250,000 and 500,000 cells per well in 2.0 ml of media (cell quantification was by Coulter counter or by hemacytometer). When larger quantities of cells were required, 10-cm tissue culture plates or T-25 flasks were used to culture up to 1.0 × 107 cells (in 10 ml of media). When appropriate, cells were supplemented with ManLev, ManNAc, GlcLev, or GlcNAc by adding the appropriate volume of a 0 to 500 mmsolution of the compound (dissolved in PBS and filter sterilized). For experiments requiring periodic monitoring of cell surface ketones over prolonged time periods, approximately one-half of the cells (∼1.0 ml, or 250,000 cells) were removed from each culture on a daily basis and replaced with fresh media (supplemented with monosaccharides as appropriate). The removed cells were analyzed for the presence of cell surface ketones by flow cytometry as described below. For all the experiments described herein, the HL-60 and Jurkat cells were grown in suspension and the HeLa cells were grown under adherent conditions. The HeLa cells were trypsinized with Trypsin-EDTA (PBS, pH 7.4) and resuspended in DME media before analysis by flow cytometry. Jurkat, HL-60, or HeLa cells (1.0 × 105 to 2.0 × 106, depending on the experiment) were washed two times in 1.0 to 10 ml of biotin buffer (PBS, pH 6.5 with 0.1% newborn calf serum) and then resuspended in 0.4–1.6 ml of biotin buffer. The washed cells were added to 100–400 μl of 5.0 mm biotin hydrazide (BH, dissolved in PBS) to give a final concentration of 1.0 mm BH. Cell/BH mixtures were incubated at room temperature for 1.5 to 2.0 h. After BH labeling was complete, ice-cold buffers were used for subsequent steps and the cells were maintained continuously on ice to prevent membrane recycling (36Dunn W.A. Hubbard A.L. Aronson Jr., N.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 5971-5978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Matlin K.S. Simons K. Cell. 1983; 34: 233-243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). BH-labeled cells were washed twice in avidin buffer (PBS, pH 7.4, with 0.1% newborn calf serum and 0.1% sodium azide). The cells were resuspended in 100 μl of avidin buffer and added to 100 μl of 11.2 μg/ml FITC-labeled avidin (generally, FITC-avidin at a final concentration of 5.6 μg/ml was used for 10 min although varying the avidin concentration from 0.5 to 50 μg/ml and the time from 5.0 to 20 min had no affect on the flow cytometry signal). The cells were incubated with FITC-avidin in the dark, then washed twice with avidin buffer, resuspended in 300 μl of avidin buffer, and subjected to analysis by flow cytometry (Coulter EPICS™ XL-MCL (Coulter, Miami, FL) using a 488-nm argon laser). HeLa cells had significantly higher background levels of fluorescence than either Jurkat or HL-60 cells. Deliberate mild over-trypsinization of the cells (i.e. for 5.0 min compared to the ∼2.0 min minimally required) increased fluorescence for control cells from 6–10 to 25–30 units, and for ManLev-treated cells by a similar amount (i.e. from 277 units to 295 units in a representative experiment). Thus, the higher background fluorescence observed with HeLa cells may result from trypsinization. It should be noted that subjecting cells to trypsin for longer time periods (10–20 min) eventually reduced the ketone-derived fluorescent signal to background levels. Furthermore, trypsin-mediated reduction of fluorescence is cell line dependent with COS-7 cells showing the greatest sensitivity, HeLa cells intermediate sensitivity, and Jurkat cells the least sensitivity of the cells tested. For quantification of native cell surface sialic acid levels, Jurkat cells were first grown in the presence and absence of ManLev or ManNAc (up to 20 mm) for 72 h. The cells (1.0 × 106) were then digested with sialidase (C. perfringes, 0.2 units) and the supernatant containing the liberated sialic acid was analyzed without further purification by high-pH anion exchange chromatography on a CarboPac PA-1 column with pulsed amperometric detection using a Dionex high performance liquid chromatography system. The elution gradient was similar to that reported by Potvin et al. (38Potvin B. Raju T.S. Stanley P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30415-30421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar): 20 mm NaOAc (in 100 mm NaOH) for 10 min followed by a gradient from 20 to 280 mm NaOAc (in 100 mm NaOH) over 20 min. Cells were incubated with various concentrations of ManLev or ManNAc for 6 days. Cells (2.0 × 105 per sample) were washed with PBS and resuspended in 0.5 ml of a 30 nm solution of FITC-labeledRicinus communis agglutinin (FITC-RCA120, Sigma, in avidin buffer). Cells were incubated on ice with FITC-RCA120 for 15 min, washed twice with avidin buffer, and analyzed by flow cytometry. ManNAc and ManLev (500 mm solutions in PBS) were premixed to give various concentrations of each monosaccharide. Specifically, either 20 or 80 μl of ManLev (to give a final concentration of 5.0 or 20 mm, respectively) was combined with one of several volumes of ManNAc (0 to 20 μl; to give a final concentration of ManNAc between 0 and 5.0 mm). The volume of the ManLev/ManNAc mixtures was adjusted to 100 μl with PBS and added to 250,000 HL-60 or Jurkat cells or to 100,000 HeLa cells, each suspended in 1.9 ml of fresh media. Cells were incubated for 2 days in 6-well tissue culture plates and analyzed by flow cytometry as described above. A similar experiment was also performed using Jurkat cells with a wider range of ManLev concentrations (1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 30 mm). ManLev (200 μl of 0 to 400 mm solutions in PBS) was added to 1.8 ml of HL-60 or Jurkat cells in 6-well tissue culture plates to give ManLev concentrations ranging between 0 and 40 mm. At 24-h intervals, cells were counted and an aliquot was removed for BH labeling, FITC-avidin staining, and analysis by flow cytometry. The volume of cells removed from each individual sample was adjusted to retain 250,000 cells in the continuing culture. Because the doubling time of both cell lines was slightly greater than 24 h (26 ± 2 h), the volume of cells removed ranged from 0.7 to 1.0 ml. An equivalent volume of ManLev containing (at the appropriate concentration) media was added to each culture to replace the removed cells. Cultures of HeLa cells were similarly cultured and assayed, but were initially seeded at 150,000 and 300,000 cells per sample (with a full range of ManLev concentrations (0 to 40 mm) for each cell dilution). The culture containing 300,000 cells was analyzed on the first, third, and fifth day after addition of ManLev by trypsinizing the cells, resuspending in 2.0 ml of media, removing 1.5 ml of cells (and adding back 1.5 ml of media with the appropriate ManLev concentration) for analysis by flow cytometry. The culture containing 150,000 cells was likewise analyzed, but on the second, fourth, and sixth day. The time-dependent depletion of cell surface ketones and the effect of cell growth inhibitors were explored using Jurkat cells that had been incubated with 5 mm ManLev for 6 days to achieve high levels of ketone expression. ManLev was removed from 5.0 ml of cells (∼2 × 106) at t = 0 and 12 h and the cells were resuspended in 5.0 ml of fresh media. Aliquots of cells (0.5 ml) from the 0 and 12-h time points were removed and analyzed by flow cytometry at 24-h intervals for 4 days. In parallel, Jurkat cells were exposed to cytostatic agents. Demecolcine, colchicine, and camptothecin were found to cause cell death before the ketone-specific signal diminished to background levels in control cells, and were therefore deemed unsuitable for the experiment. However, inhibition of cell growth with minimal toxicity (<15% cell death as determined by trypan blue staining) was achieved by adding 50 μg/ml sodium azide to the growth media subsequent to removal of ManLev (39Slamenová D. Gabelová A. Mutat. Res. 1980; 71: 253-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). At the end of 4 days the remaining cells (∼1.0 ml) were tested for viability by trypan blue staining. The rate of ketone depletion resulting from simple dilution due to cell division was predicted by determining cell growth rates experimentally and assuming that cell surface ketone density was reduced in proportion to total membrane surface area, and therefore, total cell number. The total number of ketones per cell was estimated by quantifying the number of cell surface-associated avidin molecules by Scatchard analysis with35S-labeled avidin. HL-60, HeLa, and Jurkat cells were grown in 0, 5, 10, 15, or 20 mm ManLev for 4 days (starting with 1.5 × 106 cells, resulting in 1.0 to 1.5 × 107 cells by the fourth day). The cells were then labeled with biotin hydrazide (as described above) and a portion of the cells (∼250,000) were stained with FITC-avidin and analyzed by flow cytometry. The remainder of the cells (in avidin buffer) were divided into 250-μl aliquots (0.75 to 1.5 × 106cells/aliquot). An equal volume (250 μl) of 35S-labeled streptavidin (200–2,000 Ci/mmol, supplemented with cold streptavidin to 5.9 Ci/mmol (8.45 × 10−7m) for HL-60 and Jurkat cells and to 1.19 Ci/mmol (4.2 × 10−6m) for HeLa cells) was diluted serially 1.5-fold for the HL-60 and Jurkat cells and 1.25-fold for HeLa cells. The35S-labeled streptavidin/cell mixtures were incubated on ice for 15 min, washed five times with cold avidin buffer, resuspended in 1.5 ml of avidin buffer, and added to 9.0 ml of Packard Ultima Gold LSC mixture. Disintegrations per minute were determined by scintillation counting. Analysis of the data was performed by the method of Scatchard (40Scatchard G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1949; 51: 660-672Crossref Scopus (17806) Google Scholar). Incubation of Jurkat cells (2.0 ml) with 5.0 mm ManLev was initiated at 4-h intervals with 250,000, 280,000, 315,000, 350,000, 400,000, and 450,000 cells att = 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20 h, respectively. Cells were then analyzed for cell surface ketones by BH labeling and FITC-avidin staining followed by flow cytometry analysis att = 24 h, and every 24 h thereafter. After removal of cells at each time point, the volume of the continuing cell culture was adjusted by addition of fresh media to maintain 250,000 cells, as described previously. Cells were incubated with ManLev for 300 h, then the ManLev was removed from the media or (in separate experiments) maintained with the addition of 5 mm ManNAc. In eithe"

Like progesterone receptors (PR), Stat5a and 5b are required for normal mammary gland growth and differentiation. These two proteins are up-regulated during pregnancy, a period dominated by high levels of progesterone. We now show that progestin treatment of breast cancer cells regulates Stat5a and 5b, Stat3, and Stat1 protein levels in a PR-dependent manner. In addition, progestin treatment induces translocation of Stat5 into the nucleus, possibly mediated by the association of PR and Stat5. Last, progesterone pretreatment enhances the phosphorylation of Stat5 on tyrosine 694 induced by epidermal growth factor. Functional data show that progestin pretreatment of breast cancer cells enhances the ability of prolactin to stimulate the transcriptional activity of Stat5 on a β-casein promoter. Progesterone and epidermal growth factor synergize to control transcription from p21WAF1 and c-fospromoters. These data demonstrate the convergence of progesterone and growth factor/cytokine signaling pathways at multiple levels, and suggest a mechanism for coordination of PR and Stat5-mediated proliferative and differentiative events in the mammary gland.

Progesterone, acting through progesterone receptors (PR),1 is important in the control of breast cell proliferation and differentiation (1Clarke C.L. Sutherland R.L. Endocr. Rev. 1990; 11: 266-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). Mice lacking PR exhibit incomplete mammary gland ductal branching and failure of lobulo-alveolar development (2Lydon J.P. DeMayo F.J. Funk C.R. Mani S.K. Hughes A.R. Montgomery Jr., C.A. Shyamala G. Conneely O.M. O'Malley B.W. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2266-2278Crossref PubMed Scopus (1504) Google Scholar). Interestingly, similar disruptions of mammary gland development and lactation are observed in mice upon deletion of several other genes including cyclin D1 (3Sicinski P. Donaher J.L. Parker S.G.

Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 414-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar) and most recently, two members of the STAT (signal transducers and activators of transcription) family, Stat5a (6Liu X. Robinson G.W. Wagner K. Garrett L. Wunshaw-Boris A. Hennighausen L. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar) and Stat5b (7Udy G.B. Towers R.P. Snell R.G. Wilkens R.J. Park S.H.P. Ram P.A. Waxman D.J. Davey H.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7239-7243Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar). It is evident that the products of these genes are involved in pathways that influence the mammary gland; however, it remains to be determined whether they function in distinct or convergent pathways. STAT family members are latent cytoplasmic transcription factors activated via diverse cell surface signaling molecules (8Darnell J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3356) Google Scholar). Although Stat5 is functional in many cell types, Stat5a-deficient mice are normal except for lack of proliferative mammary lobulo-alveolar outgrowth, as well as inability of females to lactate, thus demonstrating a mandatory and specific role for this STAT in both processes (6Liu X. Robinson G.W. Wagner K. Garrett L. Wunshaw-Boris A. Hennighausen L. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar). The role of Stat5a (originally identified as mammary gland factor in extracts from lactating mice) as a mediator of prolactin-induced transcription of milk protein genes during lactation is well documented (9Wakao H.F. Gouilleux F. Groner B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2182-2191Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). Stat5b-deficient mice show a phenotype mainly in sexual dimorphism of growth rates and liver gene expression; however, females also have impaired mammary gland development. Stat5b−/− females consistently abort their pups, a problem that can be overcome by progesterone administration during pregnancy (7Udy G.B. Towers R.P. Snell R.G. Wilkens R.J. Park S.H.P. Ram P.A. Waxman D.J. Davey H.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7239-7243Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar). In relation to progesterone action, both Stat5a and 5b are particularly interesting since mRNA and protein levels rise during pregnancy (10Philp J.A.S. Burdon T.G. Watson C.J. FEBS Lett. 1996; 396: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), a period dominated by high levels of progesterone. STATs are known to be activated by the ligand-induced intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity of members of the growth factor receptor family or by cytokine receptors that lack intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity, but associate with soluble tyrosine kinases known as Janus kinases (JAKs), as reviewed in Refs. 11Leaman D.W.

Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 222-227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar. Phosphorylation of a tyrosine residue (tyrosine 694 in Stat5) conserved in all STAT family members induces their dimerization, which is followed by translocation into the nucleus, DNA binding, and regulation of numerous genes involved in growth and differentiation (8Darnell J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3356) Google Scholar). In the lactating mammary gland, the cytokine prolactin, acting via prolactin receptors and JAK2, induces phosphorylation of Stat5a and 5b, which then bind sites on the promoters of mammary-specific genes such as β-casein. In addition, growth factors such as epidermal growth factor (EGF) can also stimulate Stat5, as well as Stat1 and Stat3, which then bind to STAT sites on the promoters of growth regulatory genes such as p21WAF1(13Xie W. Su K. Wang D. Paterson A.J. Kudlow J. Anticancer Res. 1997; 17: 2627-2634PubMed Google Scholar, 14Ruff-Jamison S. Chen K. Cohen S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Science. 1993; 261: 1739-1743Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). Despite conflicting in vivo and in vitro data regarding the proliferative versus growth inhibitory role of progesterone in the breast, the lack of mammary gland ductal branching and failure of lobulo-alveolar development observed in the PR-knockout mouse (2Lydon J.P. DeMayo F.J. Funk C.R. Mani S.K. Hughes A.R. Montgomery Jr., C.A. Shyamala G. Conneely O.M. O'Malley B.W. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2266-2278Crossref PubMed Scopus (1504) Google Scholar) demonstrates that PR must play a proliferative role during development. Interestingly, in vitro, progestins stimulate breast cancer cells to progress through one round of cell division accompanied by the induction of cyclin D1, p21WAF1, EGF, EGFR, c-myc, and c-fos. This is followed by growth arrest at the G1/S phase of the second cycle (17Musgrove E.A. Lee C.S. Sutherland R.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5032-5043Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Groshong S. Owen G.I. Grimison B. Schauer I.E. Todd M.C. Langan T.A. Sclafani R.A. Lange C.A. Horwitz K.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1593-1607Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 19Musgrove E.A. Lee C.S.L. Cornish A.L. Swarbrick A. Sutherland R.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 54-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). We have proposed that progesterone-arrested cells are poised to respond to secondary proliferative or differentiative signals ((18) and the accompanying paper (20Lange C.A. Richer J.K. Shen T. Horwitz K.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31308-31316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar)). There is considerable evidence that progesterone and EGF have complementary effects on the mammary gland. Like progestins and PR, EGF and EGFR are required in the proliferative phase of mammary gland development (21Coleman S. Silberstein G.B. Daniel C.W. Dev. Biol. 1988; 127: 304-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 22Edery M. Pang K. Larson L. Colosi T. Nandi S. Endocrinology. 1985; 117: 405-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Mice carrying a spontaneous mutation resulting in a critical amino acid substitution in the kinase domain of the EGFR have underdeveloped ductal trees and impaired lactation (23Fowler K.J. Walker F.

Chem. 1998; 273: 31308-31316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Since STAT proteins are downstream effectors of EGFR (13Xie W. Su K. Wang D. Paterson A.J. Kudlow J. Anticancer Res. 1997; 17: 2627-2634PubMed Google Scholar, 14Ruff-Jamison S. Chen K. Cohen S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Science. 1993; 261: 1739-1743Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar) we postulated that cross-talk between progesterone and EGF occurs at the level of STATs. That steroid hormone and growth factor signaling pathways converge at STAT proteins is suggested by the recent report of a functional interaction between glucocorticoid receptors (GR) and Stat5 in which GR act as coactivators for Stat5-mediated induction of the β-casein promoter by glucocorticoids and prolactin (26Stocklin E. Wissler M. Gouilleux F. Groner B. Nature. 1996; 383: 726-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). Conversely, Stat3 can act as a coactivator of GR-mediated transcription on a mouse mammary tumor virus promoter in the presence of interleukin-6 and dexamethasone (27Zhang Z. Jones S. Hagood J.S. Fuentes N.L. Fuller G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30607-30610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). We now report that progestin treatment of breast cancer cells up-regulates Stat5 and Stat3 protein levels in a PR-dependent manner. In addition, progestin treatment induces translocation of Stat5 into the nucleus, possibly mediated by the physical association of PR and Stat5 proteins. Functional data show that progestin treatment of breast cancer cells enhances the ability of prolactin to stimulate the transcriptional activity of Stat5 on a β-casein promoter, and synergizes with EGF to control transcription of the p21WAF1 and c-fos promoters. These data demonstrate the regulation of a key growth factor signaling molecule by progesterone and suggest a mechanism for coordination of PR and Stat5-mediated proliferative and/or differentiative events in the mammary gland. The wild type PR-positive T47Dco breast cancer cell line and its clonal derivatives T47D-Y, T47D-YA, and T47D-YB, have been described (28Sartorius C.A. Groshong S.D. Miller L.A. Powell R.L. Tung L.

The stock medium consists of Eagle's minimum essential medium with Earle's salts (MEM), containingl-glutamine (292 μg/liter) buffered with sodium bicarbonate (2.2 g/liter), insulin (6 ng/ml), and 5% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT) without antibiotics. For routine subculturing, cells are diluted 1:20 into new flasks once per week, and medium replaced every 2–3 days. Cells are harvested by incubation in Hank's-EDTA for 10 min at 37 °C. For time course experiments, cells are plated at 1 million cells per plate in MEM with supplements described above and were treated with 10 nm progesterone (Sigma) or R5020 (NEN Life Science Products Inc., Boston, MA). Cells were harvested at specified time points in RIPA buffer (10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% deoxycholic acid, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm PMSF, 50 mmsodium fluoride, 200 μm Na3VO4, and one Complete Protease Inhibitor Mixture tablet (Boehringer Mannheim, GmbH Germany) per 50 ml). EGF (Collaborative Biomedical Products, Bedford, MA) was used at 10 nm and prolactin (Sigma) at 5 μg/ml. Protein extracts were equalized to 100 μg by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad), resolved by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose. Equivalent protein loading was confirmed by Ponceau S staining. Following incubation with the appropriate antibodies, protein bands were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham, Arlington Heights, IL) and quantitated using a Molecular Dynamics Series 300 Computing Densitometer and Molecular Dynamics ImageQuant Program. The following antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA: Stat5 C-17 (recognizes both Stat5a and 5b isoforms); Stat3 (C-20); JAK2 (HR-758); and p21 (C-18). Anti-phosphotyrosine (monoclonal 4G10), anti-human Stat5A, and anti-human Stat5B (specific for the Stat5a or 5b isoform), anti-phospho-Stat5 (specific for Tyr-694) and anti-human cdc2 kinase (PSTAIR) were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY. The anti-PR monoclonal antibody AB-52 was produced in our laboratories. Breast cancer cells stably expressing either the PR-A (T47D-YA) or PR-B (T47D-YB) isoform were treated for 12 or 24 h with 10 nm progesterone or ethanol vehicle. Total RNA was isolated by ultracentrifugation of guanidinium isothiocyanate lysates through a CsCl cushion (29Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1976; 18: 5294-5299Crossref Scopus (16648) Google Scholar). RNA (30 μg) from each treatment group was transferred to a Hybond nylon membrane (Amersham) and hybridized sequentially with the cDNA inserts described below labeled by random priming with [32P]dCTP using the Mega-Prime DNA Labeling Kit (Amersham). The membrane was stripped in boiling 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS between hybridizations. A 2-kilobase insert was removed from a cDNA clone encoding fatty acid synthetase by restriction digest with EcoRI and HindIII followed by gel isolation and purification. The cyclin D1 cDNA was a 1.1-kilobase fragment removed from the vector by restriction digest with XbaI and HindIII. The Stat5a cDNA probe consisted of a 2.3-kilobase fragment cut from the vector by EcoRI digest. Last, a glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA probe representing a non-regulated gene served as a control for RNA loading. Fatty acid synthetase clone pG8 (30Chalbos D. Westley B. May F. Alibert C. Rochefort H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 965-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) was obtained from D. Chalbos, INSERM, Montpellier, France; the cyclin D1 cDNA in a modified pUC19 vector was obtained from A. Arnold, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, via R. Sclafani, University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, Denver, CO; Stat5a cDNA in pcDNA3 vector was obtained from A. D'Andrea, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, via A. Kraft, University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, Denver, CO. Cells in 10-cm dishes were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed by scraping in extraction buffer (EB: 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 2 mm Na3VO4, and 1 mmPMSF). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation for 10 min at maximum speed in a Savant (μSpeedfuge SFR13K) bench-top centrifuge and equal amounts of protein (1 mg/ml) were immunoprecipitated with the anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody 4G10 (4 μg/mg) by rotation at 4 °C for 2 h to overnight. Immuno complexes were captured by adding 30 μl of washed protein A ((insoluble formalin-fixed StaphA-derived Sorbin (Sigma)) that had been preincubated with rabbit anti-mouse antibody, incubated by constant rotation at 4 °C for an additional 2 h, then collected by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 3 min in a Savant bench-top centrifuge. Immunoprecipitates were washed twice in EB (1 ml), twice in PAN (10 mm PIPES (pH 7.0), 100 mm NaCl) containing 0.25% Nonidet P-40, and twice in PAN without Nonidet P-40. Washed pellets were resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer, boiled for 3 min, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. To facilitate immunoprecipitation studies, hPR1, the full-length PR-B cDNA cloned into the mammalian expression vector pSG5 from P. Chambon (Strasbourg, France) (31Kastner P. Krust A. Turcotte B. Stropp U. Tora L. Gronemeyer H. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1603-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1323) Google Scholar), was modified to disrupt the stop codon and add a carboxyl-terminal flag epitope consisting of amino acids DYKDDDDK. To verify that the FLAG epitope-tagged PRB (PRB:f) was expressed and functional in vivo, HeLa cells were co-transfected with PRB:f and the PRE2-TATAtk-CAT reporter using calcium phosphate precipitation as described previously (32Sartorius C.A. Tung L. Takimoto G.S. Horwitz K.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9262-9266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and treated with the synthetic progestin R5020. The chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity produced by the PRB:f was equal to that of wild-type hPR1 (data not shown). A stable cell line expressing PRB:f was established by co-transfecting HeLa cells with 4.5 μg of PRB:f plasmid and 0.5 μg of a plasmid encoding the neomycin resistance gene, pSV2neo. DNA precipitate was removed 18 h later, and cells were grown in MEM + 5% fetal bovine serum containing 700 μg/ml of the neomycin analog G418 (Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) to kill non-transfected cells. Surviving neomycin-resistant colonies were expanded and cells were analyzed by immunoblotting and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assay for clones expressing high levels of functional PRB:f. For co-immunoprecipitations, wild type HeLa and HeLa PRB:f were cultured in MEM supplemented with 5% twice charcoal-stripped heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. Cells were treated with progesterone or R5020 (10 nm) for 1 h. Nuclear extracts were prepared according to the methods described in Ref. 33Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9150) Google Scholar. After harvesting in Hanks'; EDTA, cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline then resuspended in 5 packed cell volumes of buffer A (10 mm (pH 7.9) at 4 °C, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 10 mm KCl, and 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 mm PMSF, one complete protease inhibitor mixture tablet (Boehringer Mannheim, GmbH Germany) per 50 ml of buffer) and allowed to stand at 4 °C for 10 min. The cells were collected by centrifugation at 2,000 rpm for 10 min, then resuspended in two packed cell volumes of buffer A and lysed by 10 strokes of a Kontes all glass Dounce homogenizer (B type pestle). The homogenate was centrifuged for 10 min at 2,000 rpm to pellet the nuclei. The supernatant was removed and the pellet subjected to a second centrifugation at 25,000 × g for 20 min (Beckman Optima Le-80K Ultracentrifuge, 70.1 Ti rotor) to remove residual cytoplasmic material. The pellet was resuspended in 3 ml of buffer C per 5 × 108 cells and re-homogenized as above. Buffer C consisted of 20 mm Hepes, 25% (v/v) glycerol, 0.42m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm PMSF, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors. The homogenate was mixed by rotation for 30 min at 4 °C then centrifuged for 30 min at 25,000 × g. The resulting clear supernatant was dialyzed at 4 °C for 5 h to overnight in 20 mmHepes (pH 7.9), 20% glycerol, 0.1 m KCl, 0.2 mEDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm PMSF, and protease inhibitors. One mg of nuclear extract was incubated with 100 μl of a 50% slurry of Anti-Flag M2 Affinity Gel (Eastman Kodak, New Haven, CT) at 4 °C for 4 h. The anti-Flag resin was then washed twice with TEDG containing 0.1 m NaCl, twice with TEDG containing 0.3 m KCl, and twice with TEDG containing 0.1m NaCl and 0.1% Nonidet P-40, using 1 ml of buffer for each wash. The PRB:f protein was then eluted by competition with 0.2 mg/ml Flag peptide (N-DYKDDDDK-C) (Eastman Kodak) in 200 μl of TEDG containing 0.3 m KCl and 0.1% Nonidet P-40, for 30 min at 4 °C. Laemmli sample buffer was added to the eluate, and proteins were resolved by 7.5% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and identified by immunoblotting. PR positive breast cancer cells plated at 1 million cells per 10-cm dish in MEM supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum were treated with 10 nm R5020 or ethanol vehicle for 48 h prior to transfection. Cells were then transiently transfected with 3 μg of β-casein −2300/+490 promoter in the luciferase reporter plasmid pGL2-E (provided by Paul A. Kelly, Molecular Endocrinology, INSERM, Paris, France), 3 μg of the β-galactosidase expression plasmid pCH110 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to check transfection efficiency, and Bluescript carrier plasmid (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) for a total of 20 μg of DNA using calcium phosphate precipitation as described previously (32Sartorius C.A. Tung L. Takimoto G.S. Horwitz K.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9262-9266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Three hours after transfection, the medium was aspirated and the cells were shocked with 2 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 20% glycerol. Cells were then washed twice with serum-free MEM to remove the glycerol and 10 ml of MEM containing 5% charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum was added for 18 h. Cells were then treated with either 10 nm R5020 or 5 μg/ml prolactin in triplicate dishes, and harvested 24 h after hormone addition in 300 μl of lysis solution (Analytical Luminescence Laboratories, Ann Arbor, MI), and 100 μl of lysate was analyzed for luciferase activity using the Enhanced Luciferase Assay Kit and a Monolight 2010 Luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratories, Ann Arbor, MI) as described by the manufacturer. In experiments using the T47D-YB breast cancer cells to study the effects of progesterone plus EGF in combination on STAT site containing promoters p21WAF1 and c-fos, the transfection protocol was as described above except cells were transfected 24 h after plating and treated with ethanol vehicle, progesterone, EGF, or both hormones together 18 h after glycerol shocking. Cells were harvested 24 h after hormone treatment. The −2320-base pair p21 promoter construct, a gift of A. Kraft and J. Biggs, Division of Oncology, University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, Denver, CO, was cloned into a pA3-LUC vector as described previously (34Owen G.I. Richer J.K. Tung L. Takimoto G. Horwitz K.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10696-10701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). The c-fos promoter, c-fos-81TK-luc, containing two copies of the −357/−276 promoter linked to a minimal (81 base pairs) thymidine kinase promoter was obtained from A. Gutierrez-Hartmann, Division of Endocrinology, University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, Denver, CO (35Guthridge C.J. Eidlen D. Arend W.P. Gutierrez-Hartmann A. Smith M.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1118-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), and was modified from c-fos-TK-luc (36Chen W.S. Lazar C.S. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. Gill G.N. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1987; 328: 820-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). To examine the effects of progestins on STAT protein levels, PR-positive T47Dco breast cancer cells were treated with progesterone (not shown), 10 nm R5020, or ethanol vehicle (Fig. 1 A) and cells were harvested 8–72 h later. Total Stat5 protein present in whole cell lysates was detected using a polyclonal antibody that cross-reacts with both Stat5a and 5b. Stat5 protein levels were elevated by 8 h and remained elevated until 72 h after R5020 treatment with increases of 4–7-fold (Fig. 1 A). To test the PR dependence of this effect, the experiment was repeated using PR-negative T47D-Y cells (28Sartorius C.A. Groshong S.D. Miller L.A. Powell R.L. Tung L. Takimoto G.S. Horwitz K.B. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3668-3877PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 B). In the absence of PR, R5020 did not up-regulate Stat5. The two isoforms of Stat5, Stat5a and Stat5b, share 96% similarity at the protein level (Fig. 2). Aside from the non-conserved 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions, the main difference between the two isoforms is in the COOH terminus. The last 8 amino acids of the two isoforms are completely divergent, and Stat5a is 7 amino acids longer than Stat5b (37Liu X. Robinson G.W. Gouilleux F. Groner B. Henninghausen L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8831-8835Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). To determine which of the two isoforms are regulated by PR, T47Dco cells were treated with or without R5020 for 8–60 h. Protein blots of whole cell lysates were probed with antibodies that recognize epitopes unique to Stat5a or Stat5b, as well as with an antibody that recognizes both isoforms (Fig. 2 A). This study shows that both the longer (95 kDa) Stat5a and the shorter (92 kDa) Stat5b isoform are up-regulated by progestin treatment. Stat5a was below detectable levels in the absence of R5020 (Fig. 2 A). Note that a nonspecific (NS) protein migrating just above the 95-kDa Stat5a is recognized by Stat5a antibody, but is not regulated by R5020 and serves as a loading control. Similar studies using anti-Stat3 (Fig. 2 B) and anti-Stat1 (Fig. 2 C) antibodies show that these STAT family members are also progestin regulated. While Stat3 is clearly up-regulated by progestin treatment, Stat1 is slightly down-regulated. The same blot, after probing with anti-Stat1 antibody, was stripped and reprobed with antibody recognizing total Stat5, which showed that Stat5 was again strongly up-regulated as in Figs. 1 and 2 A (data not shown). To determine whether progesterone, via PR, up-regulates Stat5a mRNA levels, total RNA was isolated from two T47Dco breast cancer cell lines stably expressing either the PR-A or PR-B isoform (28Sartorius C.A. Groshong S.D. Miller L.A. Powell R.L. Tung L. Takimoto G.S. Horwitz K.B. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3668-3877PubMed Google Scholar) that had been treated with progesterone or vehicle for 12 or 24 h (Fig. 3). Northern blot analysis demonstrates hormone-dependent induction of Stat5a message at 12 and 24 h following progestin treatment (Fig. 3). Interestingly, Stat5a appears to be more strongly induced by the PR-B than the PR-A isoform (compare lanes 2 and 4; 6 and 8). In contrast, the same Northern blot hybridized"

The excessive production of TNFα is prevented by the so-called “macrophage-deactivating factors.” This study examines the role of two structurally related neuropeptides, the vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and the pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating peptide (PACAP), as inhibitors of TNFα. Both VIP and PACAP inhibit TNFα production from lipopolysaccharide-stimulated RAW 246.7 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Although the activated cells express mRNA for all three VIP/PACAP receptors, agonist and antagonist studies indicate that the major receptor involved is VIP1R. VIP/PACAP inhibit TNFα gene expression by affecting both NF-kB binding and the composition of the cAMP responsive element binding complex (CREB/c-Jun). Two transduction pathways, a cAMP-dependent and a cAMP-independent pathway, are involved in the inhibition of TNFα gene expression and appear to differentially regulate the transcriptional factors involved. Because TNFα plays a central role in various inflammatory diseases such as endotoxic shock, multiple sclerosis, cerebral malaria, and various autoimmune conditions, the down-regulatory effect of VIP/PACAP may have a significant therapeutic potential.

Macrophages are widely recognized as cells that play a central role in the regulation of immune and inflammatory activities, as well as tissue remodeling. The execution of these activities is mediated by complex and multifactorial processes involving macrophage products (1Laskin D.L. Pendino K.J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1995; 35: 655-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). In response to antigens such as LPS,1 macrophages secrete proinflammatory cytokines and oxidants such as TNFα, IL-6, IL-1β, IL-12, and nitric oxide (1Laskin D.L. Pendino K.J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1995; 35: 655-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). TNFα and IL-6 are important macrophage secretory products that contribute to pathophysiological changes associated with several acute and chronic inflammatory conditions, including septic shock, autoimmune diseases, wasting, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and respiratory distress syndrome (2Beutler B. Cerami A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1989; 7: 625-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1498) Google Scholar, 3Van Snick J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1990; 8: 253-278Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Vassalli P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1992; 10: 411-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (1810) Google Scholar). A number of regulatory molecules termed macrophage-deactivating factors have been the focus of considerable research (5Kunkel S.L. Spengler M. May M.A. Spengler R. Larrick J. Remick D. J. Biol.

These molecules are believed to prevent the excessive production of proinflammatory mediators, including TNFα and IL-6. Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) are two multifunctional neuropeptides whose primary immunomodulatory function is anti-inflammatory in nature. VIP and PACAP inhibit several macrophage functions, including phagocytosis, respiratory burst, and chemotaxis (reviewed in Ref. 10De la Fuente M. Delgado M. Gomariz R.P. Adv. Neuroimmunol. 1996; 6: 75-91Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), as well as LPS-induced IL-6 production (11Martinez C. Delgado M. Pozo D. Leceta J. Calvo J.R. Ganea D. Gomariz R.P. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1998; 63: 591-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have recently demonstrated that VIP and PACAP protect mice from endotoxic shock presumably through the inhibition of TNFα and IL-6 production. 2Delgado, M., Martinez, C., Pozo, D., Leceta, J., Calvo, J. R., Ganea, D., and Gomariz, R. P. (1998) J. Immunol., in press. VIP was also reported to suppress TNFα production in human peripheral blood cells (12Hernanz A. Tato E. De la Fuente M. de Miguel E.

Immunol. Lett. 1998; 60: 57-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Both VIP and PACAP interact with a family of three VIP/PACAP receptors, VIP1R, and VIP2R, which exhibit similar affinities for the two neuropeptides and activate primarily the adenylate cyclase system, and PACAP-R, which exhibits a 2–3 orders of magnitude higher affinity for PACAP than for VIP and activates both the adenylate cyclase and phospholipase C systems (reviewed in Ref. 14Rawling S.R. Hezareh M. Endocr. Rev. 1996; 17: 4-29PubMed Google Scholar). Peritoneal macrophages have been described to possess VIP1R and PACAP-R (15Segura J.J. Guerrero J.M. Goberna R. Calvo J.R. Regul.

Pendino K.J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1995; 35: 655-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). TNFα synthesis is controlled at several levels. Whereas post-transcriptional, translational, and post-translational mechanisms play important roles, TNFα transcription appears to be the primary regulatory site. Although the TNFα promoter contains a complex array of transactivating binding sites, the kB and CRE elements appear essential for maximal TNFα transcription (18Collart M.A. Baeuerle P. Vassalli P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1498-1506Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Shakhov A.N. Collart M.A. Vassalli P. Nedospasov S.A. Jongeneel C.V. J. Exp.

To further understand the molecular mechanism through which VIP and PACAP attenuate the inflammatory response, we have examined the effects of both neuropeptides on TNFα protein and mRNA levels in LPS-activated Raw 264.7 macrophages and sought the specific receptor, the intracellular signal pathway, as well as the possible nuclear factors involved. Synthetic VIP, PACAP38, VIP1–12, and VIP10–28 were purchased from Novabiochem (Laufelfingen, Switzerland). The VIP1R-antagonist (Ac-His1,d-Phe2,Lys15,Arg16,Leu27)VIP(3-7)-GRF(8-27) and the VIP1R-agonist (Lys15,Arg16,Leu27)VIP(1-7)-GRF(8-27) were kindly donated by Dr. Patrick Robberecht (Universite Libre de Bruxelles, Belgium). The VIP2R-agonists Ro 25-1392 Ac-(Glu8,O-CH3-Tyr10,Lys12,Nle17,Ala19,Asp25,Leu26,Lys27,28)-VIP cyclo(21-25) and Ro 25–1553 Ac-(Glu8,Lys12,Nle17,Ala19,Asp25,Leu26,Lys27,28,Gly29,30,Thr31)-VIP cyclo(21-25) were generous gifts from Drs. Ann Welton and David R. Bolin (Hoffmann-La Roche). The PACAP-R agonist maxadilan was a generous gift from Dr. Ethan A. Lerner (Massachusetts General Hospital, Charlestown, MA). The lipophilic VIP agonist stearyl-norleucine17 VIP (SNV) and antagonist stearyl-norleucine17 neurotensin-VIP hybrid (SANV) were previously described (22Gozes I. Lilling G. Glazer R. Ticher A. Ashkenazi I.E. Davidson A. Rubinraut S. Fridkin M. Brenneman D.E. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1995; 273: 161-167PubMed Google Scholar). The PACAP-R-antagonist PACAP6–38, secretin, and glucagon were obtained from Peninsula Laboratories (Belmont, CA). LPS (from E. coli055:B5), calphostin C, and forskolin were purchased from Sigma, and N-[2-(p-bromocinnamyl-amino)ethyl]-5-iso-quinolinesulfonamide (H89) from ICN Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Costa Mesa, CA). Antibodies against CREB, p50, p65, and c-Jun were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). The murine macrophage cell line Raw 264.7 (ATCC, Manassas, VA) was grown as recommended by ATCC. The cells were seeded in flat bottom 96-well microtiter plates (Corning Glass, Corning, NY) at 8 × 104 cells/well in a final volume of 200 μl. 24 h later the monolayers were washed twice in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without serum, and 200 μl of 10% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium was added to each well. The cells were stimulated with LPS in the presence or absence of VIP or PACAP38. Cell-free supernatants were harvested at designated time points and assayed for TNFα production by ELISA. The amount of soluble TNFα was determined by using a murine TNFα ELISA assay with capture Ab (clone MP6-XT22) and detection Ab (biotinylated clone MP6-XT3) with murine TNFα (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) as standard. The ELISA is specific for murine TNFα (does not cross-react with human or rat TNFα, or with other murine cytokines such as IL-10, IL-6, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-1α, IL-1β, and interferon-γ). The sensitivity of the assay is 10 pg TNFα/ml. Northern blot analysis was performed according to standard methods. The cells (2 × 106 cells/ml) were stimulated with LPS (1 μg/ml) in the absence or presence of VIP or PACAP38 (10−8m) for different time periods, and total RNA was isolated with Ultraspec RNA reagent (Biotecx Labs, Houston, TX) as recommended by the manufacturer. 20 μg of total RNA were electrophoresed on 1.2% agarose-formaldehyde gels, transferred to S&S Nytran membranes (Schleicher & Schuell), and UV cross-linked. The TNFα probe oligonucleotide 5′-TTGACCTCAGCGCTGAGTTGGTCCCCCTTCTCAGCTGGAAGACT-3′ was designed based on the published murine TNFα sequence (23Fransen L. Mueller R. Marmenout A. Tavernier J. Van der Heyden J. Kawashima E. Collet A. Tizard R. Van Heuverswyn H. Van Vliet A. Ruyssachaert M.R. Fiers W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 4417-4429Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The following murine 18 S rRNA oligonucleotide 5′-CCAAGGACAGGGCCTCGAAAGAGTCCTGTA-3′ was used as control. The membranes were prehybridized for 16 h at 42 °C, followed by hybridization at 60 °C for 16 h with the appropriate probes. The prehybridization and hybridization buffers were purchased from 5 Prime → 3 Prime, Inc. (Boulder, CO). 2 μg of total RNA from unstimulated and LPS-stimulated Raw 264.7 cells was reverse transcribed and 3 μl of cDNA was amplified with specific primers. The primers for VIP2R and PACAP-R were designed based on published murine pancreatic VIP2R (24Inagaki N. Yoshida H. Mizuta M. Gonoi T. Miyazaki J.I. Seino S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Neuroimmunol. 1996; 68: 27-38Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The designated primers sequences are as follows: VIP1R sense, 5′-CCTTCTTCTCTGAGCGGAAGTACTT-3′ and antisense, 5′-CCTGCACCTCACCATTGAGGAAGCAG-3′; VIP2R sense, 5′-GTCAAGGACAGCGTGCTCTACTCC-3′ and antisense, 5′-CCCTGGAAGGAACCAACACATAAG-3′; PACAP-R sense, 5′-CAAG AAGGAGCAAGCCATGTGC-3′ and antisense, 5′-CATCGAGTAATGGGGGAAGGG-3′; β-actin sense, 5′-GATGGTGGGTATGGGTCAGGGG-3′ and antisense, 5′-GCTCATTGCCGATAGTGATGACCT-3′. The expected sizes for the amplified fragments are: 450 bp for VIP1R, 572 bp for VIP2R, 317 bp for PACAP-R, and 660 bp for β-actin. The PCR conditions were: denaturation 94 °C, 45 s, annealing 55 °C, 45 s, primer extension 72 °C, 90 s for 35 cycles. The PCR products were size separated in 2% agarose gels. Nuclear extracts were prepared by the mini-extraction procedure of Schreiber et al. (28Schreiber E. Metthias P. Muller M.M. Shaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3918) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Raw 264.7 cells were plated at a density of 107 cells/well in 6-well plates, stimulated and washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and 0.1% bovine serum albumin. The cell pellets were homogenized with 0.4 ml of buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 5 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 1 mm NaN3). After 15 min on ice, Nonidet P-40 was added to a final 0.5% concentration, and nuclei were isolated by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 40 s. Pelleted nuclei were washed once with 0.2 ml of ice-cold buffer A and lysed by incubation for 30 min on ice in 0.1 ml of buffer C (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.4 m NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 25% glycerol, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 mm NaN3). Supernatants containing nuclear proteins were harvested by centrifugation for 10 min at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C, the protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method, and aliquots were stored at −80 °C for use in electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs). Oligonucleotides corresponding to the proximal (−510 bp) kB3 (5′-CAAACAGGGGGCTTTCCCTCCTC-3′) and CRE (5′-TCCACATGAGATCATGGTTT-3′) (−106 bp) motif of the TNFα promoter (19Shakhov A.N.

Binding reaction mixtures (15 μl) containing: 0.5–1 ng of DNA probe, 5 μg of nuclear extract, 2 μg of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC), and binding buffer (50 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) were incubated on ice for 15 min, followed by the addition of the probe. After 20 min of incubation at room temperature, the samples were loaded onto 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel and electrophoresed in TGE buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.38 m glycine, and 2 mm EDTA), followed by transfer and autoradiography. In competition and antibody supershift experiments, nuclear extracts were incubated for 15 min at room temperature with antibody (1 μg) or competing oligonucleotide (50-fold excess) before the addition of the labeled probe. JNK activity was determined using a stress-activated protein kinase/JNK assay kit (New England BioLabs, Inc., Beverly, MA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, Raw 264.7 cell lysates, prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions, were incubated with an N-terminal c-Jun (1–89) fusion protein bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads to selectively isolate JNK, followed by a kinase reaction in the presence of cold ATP. Proteins were resolved on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels, and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. c-Jun phosphorylation at Ser63was selectively analyzed by immunoblotting using a phospho-specific c-Jun antibody and chemiluminescent detection. All values are expressed as the mean ± S.D. of the number of experiments performed in duplicate, as indicated in the corresponding figures. Comparisons between groups were made using the Student's t test followed by Scheffe's F-test, with p < 0.05 as the minimum significant level. To investigate whether VIP/PACAP inhibit TNFα release, Raw 264.7 murine macrophages were stimulated with different concentrations of LPS in the absence or presence of various doses of VIP or PACAP, and the amount of TNFα released in the culture supernatants was assayed by ELISA at different time periods. VIP and PACAP inhibit the TNFα production by LPS-stimulated cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner, showing maximal effects at 10−8m after 6 h of incubation (Fig. 1). Next we investigated whether the inhibitory effects of VIP/PACAP could be related to occupancy of specific receptors. First, we compared the effect of VIP/PACAP to secretin, glucagon, and the VIP- and PACAP-fragments VIP1–12, VIP10–28, and PACAP6–38. TNFα production was inhibited by secretin only at 10−7m, whereas no effect was observed with various concentrations of glucagon (10−9-10−7m) (Fig. 2 A). The two VIP fragments and PACAP6–38 failed to inhibit TNFα production, suggesting that intact VIP and PACAP molecules are required for their inhibitory activity (Fig. 2 A). To determine which of the VIP/PACAP receptors were involved, we used specific receptor agonists and antagonists. We investigated the effect of a newly described VIP1R-agonist (29Gourlet P.

Peptides. 1997; 18: 1539-1545Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), of two VIP2R agonists (Ro 25-1392 and Ro 25-1553) (30Gourlet P. Vertogen P. Vandermeers A. Vandermeers-Piret M.C. Rathe J.

Ther. 1997; 281: 629-633PubMed Google Scholar), and of maxadilan, a specific PACAP-R agonist (32Moro O. Lerner E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 966-970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) on the LPS-induced TNFα production. VIP1R, VIP2R, and PACAP-R agonists inhibited TNFα release (Fig. 2 B). The VIP1R agonist exhibited a similar potency as VIP/PACAP (60% inhibition), whereas maxadilan and the two Ro compounds were much less efficient (22–26% inhibition) (Fig. 2 B). In addition, we investigated the ability of PACAP6–38, an antagonist specific for PACAP-R and VIP2R (33Gourlet P. Vandermeers-Piret M.C. Rathe J. De Neef P. Robberecht P. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 287: 7-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and of a specific VIP1R-antagonist (34Gourlet P. De Neef P. Cnudde J. Waelbroeck M. Robberecht P. Peptides. 1997; 18: 1555-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), to reverse the effects of VIP and PACAP. Increasing concentrations of the antagonists (10−6-10−8m) were added simultaneously with a fixed concentration of VIP or PACAP (10−8m). The inhibitory effects of VIP and PACAP were reversed by the VIP1R-antagonist in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2 C). In contrast, PACAP6–38 did not reverse the inhibitory effect of VIP or PACAP (Fig. 2 D). Neither the VIP1R-antagonist nor PACAP6–38 significantly affected TNFα levels (Fig. 2, C and D legends). Furthermore, the simultaneous addition of VIP or PACAP and VIP1R-agonist did not result in an additive effect on TNFα release (Fig. 2 E). Together these results confirm the specificity of the VIP and PACAP inhibitory activity and suggest that both neuropeptides exert their action through binding to VIP1R. Finally, the simultaneous addition of VIP with maxadilan and/or Ro 25-1553 did not result in significant differences in comparison with samples treated with VIP alone; however, a small but statistically significant difference was observed when the cells were preincubated for 15 min with PACAP-R and/or VIP2R agonists before the addition of VIP (Fig. 2 F). The fact that VIP1R, VIP2R, and PACAP-R agonists inhibit TNFα production suggests that Raw 264.7 cells express all three receptors. To test this possibility, we investigated the expression of VIP1R, VIP2R, and PACAP-R mRNA by reverse transcription-PCR in unstimulated and LPS-stimulated Raw 264.7 cells. Both VIP1R- and PACAP-R-specific fragments were amplified from unstimulated and stimulated macrophages, whereas VIP2R fragments were only detected in stimulated cells (Fig. 3). These results indicate that LPS-stimulated Raw 264.7 cells express VIP1R, VIP2R, and PACAP-R mRNA. cAMP but not protein kinase C involvement. To study the second messengers involved in the inhibitory activity of VIP and PACAP, we investigated the effects of calphostin C (a protein kinase C inhibitor) (35Kobayashi E. Nakno H. Morimoto M. Tamaoki T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 159: 548-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar) and of H89 (a protein kinase A inhibitor) (36Chijiwa T. Mishima A. Hagiwara M. Sano M. Hayashi K. Inoue T. Naito K. Toshioka T. Hidaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5267-5272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) on the inhibition of TNFα. High concentrations (100 nm) of calphostin C inhibited TNFα production in LPS-treated cells (Fig. 4 C); however, in the 1–10 nm concentration range, calphostin C did not affect TNFα production in LPS-stimulated cells and did not reverse the inhibitory effect of VIP or PACAP (Fig. 4, A and B). In contrast, H89 partially reversed the inhibitory effect of VIP and PACAP (Fig. 4, A and B). These results suggest that the inhibitory effect of VIP/PACAP is mediated, at least partially, through increases in intracellular cAMP. The partial reversal of the inhibitory effect of VIP on TNFα production by H89 suggests the involvement of an additional cAMP-independent transduction pathway. To address this question, we used a lipophilic VIP agonist (SNV) and a lipophilic VIP antagonist (SANV) previously developed for the neurotrophic action of VIP, which act through cAMP-independent pathways (22Gozes I. Lilling G. Glazer R. Ticher A. Ashkenazi I.E. Davidson A. Rubinraut S. Fridkin M. Brenneman D.E. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1995; 273: 161-167PubMed Google Scholar). SNV inhibits TNFα production, although less efficiently than VIP or PACAP (Fig. 5 A), and the inhibitory activity is not reversed by H89 (Fig. 5 B). This suggests the existence of a second cAMP-independent pathway in the transduction of the VIP signaling in macrophages. To further substantiate this possibility, we investigated whether SNV contributes to the inhibition of TNFα by forskolin or prostaglandin E2(PGE2), two strict cAMP-inducing agents. Although SNV did not significantly affect the VIP/PACAP inhibitory effect, it increased the inhibitory action of forskolin and PGE2 (Fig. 5 C). The effect is additive, and not synergistic, suggesting that the two pathways are probably not connected. In addition, we investigated the effect of the antagonist SANV on the inhibition of TNFα production by VIP, PACAP, forskolin, PGE2, and 8-Br-cAMP. SANV partially reverses the inhibitory effect of VIP, PACAP, forskolin, PGE2, and 8-Br-cAMP (Fig. 5 D), suggesting that SANV acts on a messenger downstream from cAMP. To determine whether the VIP/PACAP affect TNFα transcription, Raw 264.7 cells were stimulated with LPS in the presence or absence of 10−8m VIP or PACAP for 1.5, 3, and 6 h, and total RNA was prepared and subjected to Northern blot analysis. Although no TNFα mRNA is detectable in unstimulated cells, time-dependent increasing levels of TNFα mRNA are present in LPS-stimulated cells (Fig. 6). At all three time points, VIP and PACAP significantly reduced the levels of specific TNFα mRNA (Fig. 6). These results indicate that both neuropeptides exert their action at a transcriptional level. Activation and nuclear translocation of members of the NF-kB/c-Rel family constitutes the hallmark of macrophage stimulation by proinflammatory cytokines and bacterial products (37Baeuerle P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4602) Google Scholar). To investigate whether VIP/PACAP affect NF-kB nuclear translocation, we used electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Stimulation of Raw 264.7 cells with LPS led to strong NF-kB binding compared with unstimulated cells, and treatment with VIP or PACAP significantly reduced the binding (Fig. 7 A). The binding specificity was confirmed by using homologous (NF-kB) and nonhomologous (CRE) oligonucleotides as competitors (Fig. 7 B). Furthermore, monospecific anti-p50 and anti-p65 Abs used in supershift experiments indicated that the LPS-induced kB binding complex was composed primarily of p50/p65 heterodimers (Fig. 7 C). Recently, it has been established that the CRE site in the TNFα promoter is required for optimal transcription of the TNFα gene in monocytes (20Yao J. Mackman N. Edgington T.S. Fan S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17795-17801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). The CRE binding activity is constitutively expressed in unstimulated Raw 264.7 cells, and treatment with LPS in the presence or absence of VIP/PACAP does not affect the binding (Fig. 8 A). The specificity of the CRE binding activity was confirmed with homologous (CRE) or nonhomologous (NF-kB) oligonucleotides as competitors (Fig. 8 A). Antibody supershift experiments were performed to determine the composition of the CRE binding complexes. In unstimulated cells, the majority of the complex was supershifted by an anti-CREB Ab, whereas no supershift was observed using an anti-c-Jun Ab (Fig. 8 B). In contrast, a major supershift by the anti-c-Jun Ab was evident in cells treated with LPS (Fig. 8 B), indicating the presence of c-Jun in the CRE binding complexes. Treatment of LPS-stimulated cells with VIP or PACAP led to complexes similar to those from unstimulated cells, containing CREB and minor amounts, if any, of c-Jun (Fig. 8 B). Phosphorylation of c-Jun at Ser63 and Ser73 by JNK after LPS stimulation is essential for the binding of the c-Jun protein to the CRE site (38Smeal T. Binetruy B. Mercola D. Grover-Bardwick A. Heidecker G. Rapp U.R. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3507-3513Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 39Hambleton J. Weinstein S.L. Lem L. DeFranco A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Because VIP and PACAP reduce c-Jun in the CRE binding complexes, we investigated whether VIP inhibits JNK activity. Unstimulated and LPS-stimulated cells were incubated with or without VIP for 1–6 h, and the presence of phosphorylated c-Jun was determined by Western blot. LPS-stimulated cells express high levels of phosphorylated c-Jun in comparison with unstimulated cells (Fig. 9). VIP reduces the expression of c-Jun in a time-dependent manner, with the highest effect at 2 and 3 h after stimulation (Fig. 9). Because the inhibitory effect of VIP on TNFα production is mediated primarily through VIP1R and cAMP, we determined the effect of the VIP1R antagonist and of the protein kinase A inhibitor H89 on the changes induced by VIP in kB and CRE binding complexes. The inhibitory activity of VIP on LPS-mediated NF-kB binding was completely reversed by the VIP1R-antagonist (Fig. 10 A, lane 4), and only partially by H89 (Fig. 10 A, lane 3). However, both the VIP1R antagonist and H89 reversed the changes in the composition of the CRE binding complexes induced by VIP. In the presence of either VIP1R antagonist or H89 the supershift patterns returned to the patterns observed for LPS-"
https://openalex.org/W2084340821,"The antimalarial quinolines are believed to work by blocking the polymerization of toxic heme released during hemoglobin proteolysis in intraerythrocytic Plasmodium falciparum. In the presence of free heme, chloroquine and quinidine associate with the heme polymer. We have proposed that this association of the quinoline-heme complex with polymer caps the growing heme polymer, preventing further sequestration of additional heme that then accumulates to levels that kill the parasite. In this work results of binding assays demonstrate that the association of quinoline-heme complex with heme polymer is specific, saturable, and high affinity and that diverse quinoline analogs can compete for binding. The relative quinoline binding affinity for heme polymer rather than free heme correlates with disruption of heme polymerization. Mefloquine, another important antimalarial quinoline, associated with polymer in a similar fashion, both in cultured parasites and in the test tube. In parasite culture, blocking heme release with protease inhibitor was antagonistic to mefloquine action, as it is to chloroquine action. These data suggest a common mechanism for quinoline antimalarial action dependent on drug interaction with both heme and heme polymer."
https://openalex.org/W2052413452,"Expression of the MRP1 gene encoding the GS-X pump and of the γ-GCSh gene encoding the heavy (catalytic) subunit of the γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase is frequently elevated in many drug-resistant cell lines and can be co-induced by many cytotoxic agents. However, mechanisms that regulate the expression of these genes remain to be elucidated. We report here that like γ-GCSh, the expression of MRP1 can be induced in cultured cells treated with pro-oxidants such astert-butylhydroquinone, 2,3-dimethoxy-1,4-naphthoquinone, and menadione. Intracellular reactive oxygen intermediate (ROI) levels were increased in hepatoma cells treated withtert-butylhydroquinone for 2 h as measured by flow cytometry using an ROI-specific probe, dihydrorhodamine 123. Elevated GSH levels in stably γ-GCSh-transfected cell lines down-regulated endogenous MRP1 and γ-GCShexpression. ROI levels in these transfected cells were lower than those in the untransfected control. In the cell lines in which depleting cellular GSH pools did not affect the expression of theMRP1 and γ-GCSh genes, only minor increased intracellular levels of ROIs were observed. These results suggest that intracellular ROI levels play an important role in the regulation of MRP1 and γ-GCSh expression. Our data also suggest that elevated intracellular GSH levels not only facilitate substrate transport by the MRP1/GS-X pump as previously demonstrated, but also suppress MRP1 and γ-GCShexpression."

However, the functional roles of the other Ig-like domains have not yet been made clear. In this study, we constructed various deletion mutants of the extracellular Ig-like domains of KDR and examined their binding affinity with VEGF using a BIAcore biosensor. Based on the results of this study, we discuss the functions of the Ig-like domains of KDR in ligand binding. cDNA encoding a fusion protein consisting of a deletion mutant of the extracellular domain of KDR and amino acids 234–460 of the human IgG heavy chain (25Kabat E.A. Wu T.T. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1971; 190: 382-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) (denoted Fc) was cloned under the polyhedrin promoter (XbaI-NotI site) in the baculovirus transfer vector pVL1393 (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA). The EcoRI 2.8-kb fragment of BCMGSneo-KDR (26Sawano A. Takahashi T. Yamaguchi S. Aonuma M. Shibuya M. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 213-221PubMed Google Scholar) covering the extracellular domain of KDR was inserted into the EcoRI site of pUC18. Then the XhoI site of the plasmid, located at 12 base pairs upstream of the open reading frame of the KDR, was converted to an XbaI site by digestion with XhoI followed by treatment with Klenow fragment and ligation with the XbaI linker (5′-CTCTAGAG-3′). The resulting plasmid was named pKDR-Xb. The mutant KDR gene was constructed using the KDR gene downstream of theXbaI site of pKDR-Xb, the Fc gene carried by pAMo-Fc (27Yago T. Tsukuda M. Tajima H. Nishi T. Kurata-Miura K. Ohkubo J. Minami M. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 707-714PubMed Google Scholar), and synthetic oligonucleotides or PCR-amplified fragments, which were parts of the KDR gene. The amino acids encoded by the 7N-, 6N-, 5N-, 4N-, 3N-, 2N-, and 1N-KDR genes are 1–738, 1–638, 1–518, 1–393, 1–294, 1–194, and 1–104, respectively. PCR was performed using the 7N-KDR gene as a template and synthetic oligonucleotides (5′-ATCCCGGGTACCTTCTAGAGTCGAGGT-3′ and 5′-TGTCCCCTGCAAGTAGATCTAAGAGTTGTA-3′) as primers, and the amplified fragment was digested with XbaI and BglII. With the resulting 160-base PCR fragment, which encodes Met−22 to Leu30, the 370-baseXbaI-BglII fragment of the 7N-, 5N-, and 4N-KDR genes, encoding Met−22 to Arg103, was replaced to construct the 7Δ1N-, 5Δ1N-, and 4Δ1N-KDR genes, respectively. PCR was performed using the 5N-KDR gene as a template and synthetic oligonucleotides (5′-TGAAAGTTACAGATCTATTATGTACATA-3′ and 5′-CATGAGGGTGTCCTTGGGTTTTGG-3′) as primers, and the amplified fragment was digested withBglII and HincII. With the resulting 1.0-kb PCR fragment, which encodes Ser192 to Val514, the 1.2-kb BglII-HincII fragment of the 5Δ1N-KDR gene, encoding Arg31 to Val442, was replaced to construct the 5Δ1–2N-KDR gene. PCR was performed using the 4N-KDR gene as a template and the synthetic oligonucleotides used for the construction of the 5Δ1–2N-KDR gene as primers, and the amplified fragment was digested with BglII and NotI. With the resulting 1.3-kb PCR fragment, which encodes Ser192 to the carboxyl terminus of the 4N-KDR protein, the 1.5-kbBglII-NotI fragment of the 4Δ1N-KDR gene, encoding Arg31 to the carboxyl terminus of the 4N-KDR protein, was replaced to construct the 4Δ1–2N-KDR gene. The 4N-, 4Δ1N-, and 4Δ1–2N-KDR genes and all of the other mutant KDR genes contained the linker coding for Gly-Thr and Tyr-Val-Arg- Ser-Gly-Thr between KDR and Fc, respectively. The 5Δ1–2N- and 4Δ1–2N-KDR genes contained the linker coding for Arg at the deletion site in the extracellular domain. The mutant KDR proteins translated from these genes are shown in Fig. 1. To construct the recombinant baculovirus containing the mutant KDR cDNA, the transfer vector was cotransfected with BaculoGold viral DNA (Pharmingen) into Sf9 cells as described (28O'Reilly D.R. Miller L.K. Luckow V.A. Baculovirus Expression Vectors: A Laboratory Manual. Freeman, New York1992Google Scholar). Then the recombinant virus was prepared from the supernatant and purified by plaque purification as described (28O'Reilly D.R. Miller L.K. Luckow V.A. Baculovirus Expression Vectors: A Laboratory Manual. Freeman, New York1992Google Scholar). Confluent monolayers of Sf21 cells grown in serum-free medium Ex-Cell 400 (JRH Biosciences, Lenexa, KS) were infected with the recombinant virus (multiplicity of infection = 10) and then incubated at 27 °C for 72 h. The culture medium of the recombinant baculovirus-infected Sf21 cells was applied to a protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column (1.5 ml) that had been pre-equilibrated in PBS. The column was washed with 10 bed volumes of PBS and then eluted with 0.1 m glycine-HCl, pH 3.0, fractions of 1 ml being collected. The pH of the sample thus eluted was adjusted immediately to 7.0 with 2 m Tris followed by dialysis against PBS. VEGF165 was expressed by baculovirus-infected insect cells as described previously (26Sawano A. Takahashi T. Yamaguchi S. Aonuma M. Shibuya M. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 213-221PubMed Google Scholar). The culture supernatant was applied to a heparin-Sepharose CL-6B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column. The bound proteins were eluted with a gradient of 0–1 m NaCl in 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.3. Each fraction was analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and the positive fractions were pooled and then dialyzed against 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.3, containing 1 m (NH4)2SO4. A sample was applied to a butyl-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column, and the bound proteins were eluted with a gradient of 1–0m (NH4)2SO4. The positive fractions were pooled and then dialyzed against PBS. The purity of the VEGF thus obtained was above 90%. The mutant KDR proteins were diluted to 0.2–10 μg/ml with PBS. Aliquots (50 μl) were applied to the surface of methanol-treated 96-well plates (MultiScreen-IP, Millipore, Bedford, MA) for 12 h at 4 °C. The plates were then washed with PBS, and nonspecific sites were blocked with PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin for 30 min at 25 °C. An aliquot (50 μl) of 4 ng/ml 125I-labeled VEGF (1,200–1,800 Ci/mmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added to each well followed by incubation for 1.5 h at 25 °C. The wells were washed with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 and then with PBS and then dried at 50 °C. An aliquot (10 μl) of Microscinti-O (Packard, Meriden, CT) was added to each well, and then the bound125I-labeled proteins were quantified with TopCount (Packard). Competition was examined by incubating 50 μl of 4 ng/ml125I-labeled VEGF and 50 μl of 0.02–10 μg/ml mutant KDR proteins on plates coated with 0.2 μg of 7N-KDR protein. All experiments were performed at 25 °C using HBS buffer comprising 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, and 0.005% (v/v) surfactant P20. VEGF was coupled to a CM-5 biosensor chip by amine coupling using an amine coupling kit (Pharmacia Biosensor Ltd., Uppsala, Sweden) with the following modifications. VEGF was diluted to 2 and 4 μg/ml with 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 6.0; after immobilization, the surfaces were conditioned with 0.1 m glycine-HCl, pH 1.5, for 4 min. This gave 770 and 1,390 response units, respectively. The KDR proteins were diluted to 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 μmwith HBS buffer. For the 3N-, 2N-, 1N-, 5Δ1–2N-, and 4Δ1–2N-KDR proteins, 3 and 4 μm solutions were also prepared. Each sample was injected over the VEGF surface at a flow rate of 20 μl/min. Sensorgrams were recorded and normalized as to a base line of 0 response units. An equivalent volume of each protein dilution was also injected over an activated and ethanolamine-quenched surface for determination of the bulk refractive index background. At the end of each cycle, bound KDR was removed by injecting 5 μl of 50 mm HCl at a flow rate of 20 μl/min to regenerate the chip. To determine the association and dissociation rate constants (k on and k off, respectively), the sensorgrams were analyzed by nonlinear least squares curve fitting using BIAevaluation 2.1 software (Pharmacia Biosensor). The equation R = R 0exp(−k off(t −t 0)) was used for the dissociation phase, wheret 0 is the start time for dissociation and R 0 is the response at the start of the dissociation. k on was calculated using the model A + B = AB and by fitting the data to the equationR = R eq(1 − exp(−k on C +k off(t −t 0))), where C is the molar concentration of the analyte and R eq is the steady-state response level. The final k off and k on values were calculated from the means of these values for each doublet injection of an injection series. The apparent K d value was determined from the ratio of these final kinetic constants (k off/k on). Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (29Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. SDS-PAGE was performed with a ready made 5–20% (w/w) polyacrylamide gradient gel (ATTO Corp., Tokyo, Japan) according to the method of Laemmli (30Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar), and the gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. To examine the binding sites and characteristics of the Ig-like domains in the extracellular region of KDR, a set of Ig-like domain deletions was constructed as fusions with the Fc portion of a human IgG (Fig. 1) and expressed in baculovirus-infected insect cells. We chose the deletion junction of KDR based on the putative Ig-like domains of the murine counterpart Flk-1 (11Matthews W. Jordan C.T. Gavin M. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Lemischka I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad . Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9026-9030Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). All of the recombinant KDR proteins could be highly purified from the culture medium using a protein G-Sepharose column (Fig. 2). We also analyzed the proteins by nonreducing gel electrophoresis and confirmed that all constructs migrated as dimeric proteins (data not shown). The apparent molecular masses of the proteins shown in Fig. 1 were estimated from the results of SDS-PAGE analysis. We examined the region of the receptor responsible for VEGF binding by means of a solid phase binding assay. The KDR proteins were fixed on plastic plates, and then the bound125I-VEGF was measured (Fig. 3). The 7N- and 6N-KDR proteins bound to the ligand in almost the same manner. However, the 5N- and 4N-KDR proteins bound with lower affinity than the 7N form, and the 3N-, 2N-, and 1N-KDR proteins showed almost undetectable binding with this method. The first Ig-like domain of 7N-, 5N-, and 4N-KDR was dispensable for binding to the ligand. High affinity binding ability rather tended to be obtained on removal of this domain. Deletion of the first and second Ig-like domains from 4N-KDR led to undetectable binding to the ligand. This effect was almost the same when the mutant KDR had the fifth Ig-like domain. To confirm that the binding characteristics of the mutant KDR proteins were not caused by the efficiency of their immobilization on the plastic plate, each KDR protein was added as a competitor in the binding assay system with the 7N form fixed on the plastic plate and125I-VEGF (Fig. 4). The 7N-, 6N-, 5N-, and 4N-KDR proteins blocked the ligand binding, the IC50 values being 45, 79, 210, and 790 ng/ml (0.18, 0.34, 1.17, and 5.34 μm), respectively. Deletion of the first Ig-like domain from the amino termini of the 7N-, 5N-, and 4N-KDR proteins caused slightly stronger inhibition (IC50 = 0.10, 0.70, and 2.28 μm, respectively). The 3N-, 2N-, 1N-, 5Δ1–2N-, and 4Δ1–2N-KDR proteins at concentrations up to 5 μg/ml did not block the ligand binding significantly. Consequently, in this assay system the binding characteristics of the KDR proteins were essentially the same as those observed with the plate-fixed method described above. VEGF was immobilized directly to a carboxylated dextran matrix chip through the primary amine group on VEGF, and the mutant KDR proteins were injected over the VEGF surface. Representative sensorgrams are shown in Fig. 5. The effects of deletion of the Ig-like domains of KDR on VEGF binding observed in this experiment (Fig. 5, A–D) were essentially consistent with those with the competitive binding assay described above. However, the binding of 3N-, 4Δ1–2N-, and 5Δ1–2N-KDR, which was not detected with the plate-fixed method or the competitive binding assay described above, was observed in this system with high concentrations of the analytes (Fig. 5, E and F). The binding of the 2N- and 1N-KDR proteins was not detected with concentrations up to 4 μm (Fig. 5 E). These results suggest that the third Ig-like domain is critical for VEGF binding. The kinetic parameters analyzed in the sensorgrams are summarized in Table I. With extension of the COOH-terminal deletion of the extracellular region, theK d value increased gradually. In the cases of the 6N-, 5N-, and 4N-KDR proteins, the decreases in k on were of the same order of magnitude; however, the increase in k off was affected greatly, especially when the deletion extended to the sixth or fifth Ig-like domain. Thus, the increase in K d on deletion of the COOH-terminal two or three Ig-like domains was mainly the result of an increase in k off. As for 3N-KDR, theK d value of which was about 15-fold higher than that of 4N-KDR, the reduction in the ligand affinity was attributed mainly to the 10-fold reduction in k on. The kinetic parameters were also affected by deletion of the NH2-terminal Ig-like domains. On removal of the first Ig-like domain from the 7N-, 5N-, and 4N-KDR proteins,k on increased slightly. However, deletion of the NH2-terminal two domains caused a 10-fold decrease in k on. k off was also influenced by the NH2-terminal deletion, but the effect differed among the mutant KDR proteins. On deletion of the first Ig-like domain, k off of the 7N- and 5N-KDR proteins increased, but it decreased in the case of 4N-KDR. The increase in k off on deletion of the NH2-terminal two Ig-like domains from 5N-KDR was more than that in the case of 4N-KDR. Taking all of the facts together we conclude that the second and fourth domains contribute by maintaining the high association rate of the receptor-ligand interaction, and the NH2-terminal domain has a slightly negative effect on the association. The downstream region, especially the fifth and sixth Ig-like domains, is important for retention of VEGF bound to the receptor molecule.Table IKinetic constants for the interaction of the mutant KDR proteins with VEGFKDR variant7N6N5N4N3N2N1N7Δ1N5Δ1N4Δ1N5Δ1–2N4Δ1–2Nk on × 10−4(m−1 · s−1)6.645.955.173.150.30NDND8.436.465.750.440.63k off × 105(s−1)1.272.8012.742.263.2NDND2.7013.435.559.264.1K d(nm)0.190.472.4613.4211NDND0.322.076.17135102The kinetic constants were determined using the BIAcore system as described under “Experimental Procedures.” ND, no specific binding detected. Open table in a new tab The kinetic constants were determined using the BIAcore system as described under “Experimental Procedures.” ND, no specific binding detected. We constructed various truncated mutants of the extracellular Ig-like domains of VEGF receptor KDR to gain an insight into the structure/function relationship of VEGF binding. The KDR variants were fused with the Fc portion of a human IgG. The receptor-ligand interactions were analyzed by means of three assay systems: a solid phase binding assay, a competitive solid phase binding assay, and analysis of the binding using a BIAcore biosensor. Essentially identical results were obtained with these systems. With the BIAcore biosensor assay, we can analyze the rates of association and dissociation of two molecules; therefore, it is useful for characterizing a receptor-ligand interaction. This work is the first to involve the BIAcore system for identifying the ligand binding sites of a receptor. The apparent K d value determined from the ratio of k on and k off(k off/k on) of 7N-KDR, having the full-length extracellular domain, was 0.19 nm(Table I), which was within the range reported for membrane-bound full-length KDR (10Terman B.I.

Therefore, the properties of the truncated KDR variants on the ligand binding observed in the assay system must reflect those of the intact KDR. Based on the results of our study, the deduced function of the Ig-like domains of KDR in VEGF binding is summarized in Fig. 6. We showed that 3N-KDR, composed of the first three NH2-terminal Ig-like domains, and 4Δ1–2N-KDR, which has only the third and fourth domains, could bind to VEGF with 1,000-fold lower affinity than 7N-KDR. However, removal of the third domain abolished completely the receptor's ability to bind to the ligand. Therefore, the third domain is critical for minimal ligand binding under those experimental conditions (Fig. 6). Fuh et al. (24Fuh G. Li B. Crowley C. Cunningham B. Wells J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11197-11204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) reported that the second and third domains of KDR were sufficient for high affinity binding, and the mutant KDR, which has only the NH2-terminal two domains, could bind to the ligand with more than 1,000-fold decrease in affinity. The difference between our results and theirs might be because of the different definitions of the domains. The second and third domains of their mutant KDR contained an additional 9 and 22 amino acids, respectively, on the COOH terminus of each domain in our definition. In addition, it might be attributed to the difference of the post-translational modifications of the KDR proteins because they used the mutant KDR proteins expressed by the human kidney 293 cell lines, whereas we used insect cell-produced KDR proteins. From the results of kinetic analysis of the receptor-ligand interaction, we found that the second and fourth domains play major roles by maintaining the high association rate of the interaction (Fig. 6). Davis-Smyth et al. (19Davis-Smyth T. Chen H. Park J. Presta L.G. Ferrara N. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4919-4927Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) suggested that specific ligand-binding determinants of KDR are located in the second Ig-like domain. In addition to the domain, the fourth domain might also be required for primary recognition of the ligand, and both domains might determine the ligand specificity. Because removal of the first Ig-like domain resulted in an increase in the k on value, it is possible that this domain partially shields the ligand recognition domain and thus regulates the association rate of ligand binding (Fig. 6). Deletion of the downstream Ig-like domains caused decreases in the affinity with VEGF, which was mainly the result of an increase in the dissociation rate. Thus, these Ig-like domains, especially the fifth and sixth ones, play major roles in retention of VEGF bound to the receptor molecule (Fig. 6). It should be noted that removal of the first Ig-like domain also influenced the dissociation rate, but the effect differed according to the COOH-terminal structure of the mutant KDR; that is, the rate of increase in thek off value decreased gradually with extension of the COOH-terminal deletion (Table I). The first domain might also be involved in the regulation of the ligand dissociation together with the fifth and sixth domains. It might be possible that the conformation of the first domain differs among the mutant KDR proteins. Domain deletion studies on another VEGF receptor, Flt-1, indicated previously that the fourth domain and a region further downstream contribute to receptor dimer formation (20Barleon B. Totzke F.

Chem. 1998; 273: 11197-11204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) reported that dimerized forms of KDR bound to VEGF about 100-fold more tightly than the corresponding monomeric forms. As 5N-KDR binds about 100-fold more tightly than 3N-KDR (Table I), the fourth to fifth Ig-like domains of KDR must also be involved in receptor dimerization. The mutant KDR proteins used in this study form dimers through disulfide bonds in the Fc portion. However, the mutant KDR lacking the downstream Ig-like domains could not form tightly associated dimeric molecules at the KDR portion; therefore, VEGF bound to the receptor might easily be released from the molecule. To identify more precisely the region that contributes to receptor dimerization of KDR we need to analyze the structures of a series of deletion mutants not fused with an IgG. In this study, we characterized the Ig-like domains within the extracellular region of KDR on VEGF binding and could roughly classify them based on the results of ligand binding analysis. Further dissection of the extracellular domain by means of internal deletions should make it possible to define more precisely the receptor-ligand interaction. Alternatively, crystallization of the recombinant KDR proteins and the KDR-VEGF complexes may provide molecular insights into the binding of VEGF to KDR.

Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)1 is the prototype member of a superfamily of growth factors, which have many roles in growth regulation, wound healing, immunity, and development. Most notably, TGF-β is a potent growth inhibitor for many cell types and induces a variety of extracellular matrix proteins and adhesion receptors (2Derynck R. Choy L. Thomson A.W. The Cytokine Handbook. 3rd Ed. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1998: 593-636Google Scholar). The current model for TGF-β signaling invokes the binding of ligand to the type II TGF-β receptor, which results in the recruitment, phosphorylation, and concomitant activation of type I TGF-β receptors. The activated type I receptor then phosphorylates Smad2 or Smad3, which is then released from the receptor and forms a complex with Smad4. This complex then translocates to the nucleus where it interacts with transcription factors and regulates gene expression (3Heldin C.-H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3357) Google Scholar). Although Smads clearly act as effectors of TGF-β receptor signaling, several lines of evidence indicate that other factors are probably involved in TGF-β signal transduction. The ability of a dominant negative type II receptor to inhibit TGF-β-mediated growth inhibition but not extracellular matrix production suggests that the pathways leading to these effects of TGF-β are distinct and separable (4Chen R.-H. Ebner R. Derynck R. Science. 1993; 260: 1335-1338Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar) and may be differentially regulated via quantitatively different thresholds of signaling (5Feng X.-H. Derynck R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13123-13129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Consistent with this notion, specific residues on the type I (6Saitoh M.

The Smads have been found to mediate both the extracellular matrix and the antimitogenic signaling pathways (3Heldin C.-H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P.

Thus, although the basis for distinction between these pathways is not well understood, it is possible that other proteins interacting directly with the receptors are involved in this differential regulation. In addition to Smads, other proteins have been identified that interact with the TGF-β receptors. Two-hybrid screening approaches resulted in the cloning of FKBP-12 (10Wang T. Donahoe P.K. Zervos A.S. Science. 1994; 265: 674-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar) and the α subunit of farnesyltransferase (11Kawabata M. Imamura T. Miyazono K. Engel M.E. Moses H.L. J. Biol.

Science. 1996; 271: 1120-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), which interact with the type I receptor, and TRIP-1, a WD40 repeat-containing protein, which interacts with the type II receptor (1Chen R.H. Miettinen P.J. Maruoka E.M. Choy L. Derynck R. Nature. 1995; 377: 548-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). However, farnesyltransferase activity has since been shown to be dispensable for TGF-β signaling, and TGF-β does not affect the activity of this enzyme (13Ventura F. Liu F. Doody J. Massagué J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13931-13934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar); therefore the functional significance of the interaction of α subunit of farnesyltransferase with TGF-β receptors is unknown. FKBP-12 has been found to have an inhibitory effect on signaling through TGF-β family type I receptors (14Wang T. Li B.-Y. Danielson P.D. Shah P.C. Rockwell S. Lechleider R.J. Martin J. Manganaro T.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3866-3876Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) and can inhibit phosphorylation of the type I receptor by the type II TGF-β receptor (15Chen Y.-G. Liu F. Massagué J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3866-3876Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). No function for TRIP-1 has as yet been reported. Unlike α subunit of farnesyltransferase and FKBP-12, TRIP-1 does not appear to have any enzymatic function, a common phenomenon among WD40 repeat-containing proteins (16Neer E.J. Schmidt C.J. Nambudripad R. Smith T.F. Nature. 1994; 371: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (1299) Google Scholar). WD40 repeats, first recognized in the β-subunit of heterotrimeric G proteins (17Fong H.K. Hurley J.B. Hopkins R.S. Miake-Lye R. Johnson M.S. Doolittle R.F. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 2162-2166Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar), have been identified in many proteins involved in diverse functions, such as transcriptional regulation, RNA processing, signal transduction, cell cycle progression, and vesicular trafficking (16Neer E.J. Schmidt C.J. Nambudripad R. Smith T.F. Nature. 1994; 371: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (1299) Google Scholar). These proteins are often found in multi-subunit protein complexes, and it has been proposed that the WD40 repeats are important for protein-protein interactions. The crystal structure of Gβγ has revealed the three-dimensional structure of the WD40 repeat units in Gβ as forming a β-propeller structure, with each propeller blade being formed from a four-strand β-sheet (18Sondek J. Bohm A. Lambright D.B. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1996; 379: 369-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies suggest that other WD40 repeat proteins are also likely to form similar propeller structures (19Garcia-Higuera I. Fenoglio J. Li Y. Lewis C. Panchenko M.P. Reiner O. Smith T.F. Neer E.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13985-13994Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). TRIP-1 interacts with the type II TGF-β receptor both in vivo and in vitro but does not interact with the closely related type II activin receptor. The kinase activity, and therefore, presumably, autophosphorylation of the receptor greatly enhance this interaction, and TRIP-1 is a substrate of the receptor kinase. TRIP-1 can be found in the ligand-bound complex of type I and II receptors but does not interact directly with the type I receptors (1Chen R.H. Miettinen P.J. Maruoka E.M. Choy L. Derynck R. Nature. 1995; 377: 548-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Recently, another WD40 repeat-containing protein has been identified that interacts with TGF-β receptors. Bα, a subunit of protein phosphatase 2A, interacts with type I TGF-β receptors and potentiates the anti-mitogenic signaling pathway in a receptor-dependent manner. 2Griswold-Prenner, I., Kamibayashi, C., Maruoka, E. M., Mumby, M. C., and Derynck, R. (1998) Mol. Cell Biol., in press. However, Bα has little or no effect on PAI-1 expression induced by the activated receptor complex, suggesting that Bα preferentially regulates the antimitogenic signaling pathway and does not modulate all TGF-β effects equally. In this report, we have examined the role of TRIP-1 in TGF-β signaling and have found that TRIP-1 acts to inhibit signal transduction by the activated TGF-β receptor complex. Furthermore, TRIP-1, like Bα, exhibits selectivity with respect to its effects on signaling. The full-length, Glu-tagged human TRIP-1 cDNA cloned in the expression vector pRK5 (pTRIP-1G) was described previously (1Chen R.H. Miettinen P.J. Maruoka E.M. Choy L. Derynck R. Nature. 1995; 377: 548-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). To create N-terminal- and C-terminal-deleted mutant versions (ΔN or ΔC) of TRIP-1, which are missing amino acids 1–95 and 227–325, respectively, PCR primers were designed to enable amplification and cloning of specific subregions of the coding sequence, as follows: ΔN, 5′-CGGAATTCATGGTCCGGACCTGCGGTTTTGA and 5′-GCGGCCAAGCTTCTGCAGTT; ΔC, 5′-TTCTATCGATTGAATTCAGC and 5′-GCTCTAGAAAAGTCTTCTGATGTTCAAG. After amplification using the pTRIP-1G plasmid as a template, the ΔN PCR product, which was designed so as to include the sequence for the C-terminal Glu epitope tag from pTRIP-1G, was digested with EcoRI and PstI and cloned into pRK5, whereas the ΔC PCR product was digested withEcoRI and XbaI and cloned into pRK5-glu, which supplied an in-frame C-terminal Glu epitope tag (1Chen R.H. Miettinen P.J. Maruoka E.M. Choy L. Derynck R. Nature. 1995; 377: 548-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). For creation of the middle-deleted ΔM plasmid, which is missing amino acids 97–226, pTRIP-1G was digested with MroI, the intervening piece of DNA was removed by agarose gel electrophoresis, and the remaining DNA was purified from the gel and re-ligated. To generate the ΔMC construct, in which amino acids 104–325 are deleted, the ΔM construct was digested with MroI and XbaI, the insert was removed, and the synthetic oligonucleotides 5′-CCGGACCTGCGGTTTTGACTTT and 5′-CTAGAAAGTCAAAACCGCAGGT, which were annealed into a single piece of double-stranded DNA encoding amino acids 98–103, were cloned in place of the insert. To generate the ΔNC construct, in which amino acids 1–90 and 227–325 are deleted, the ΔC construct was digested withMroI and EcoRI, the insert removed, and the synthetic oligonucleotides 5′-AATTCATGAAGACCAATTCGGCTCT and 5′-CCGGACAGCCGAATTGGTCTTACTG, which were annealed into a single piece of double-stranded DNA encoding amino acids 91–96, were cloned in place of the insert. To generate the ΔNM construct, in which amino acids 1–226 are deleted, the ΔN construct was digested with MroI, the insert was removed, and the remaining plasmid was religated. To substitute a Myc epitope tag (21Evan G. Lewis G. Ramsay G. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3610-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2166) Google Scholar) in place of the Glu tag in all the above plasmids, each was cut with EcoRI and XbaI, yielding a fragment containing the coding region without the epitope tag, which was then cloned into the EcoRI and XbaI sites of pRK5-Myc, a plasmid that supplied an in-frame C-terminal Myc tag. The Myc-tagged TRIP-1 proteins are denoted by “-Myc.” To generate the ΔWD-Myc construct, the sequences encoding the regions of TRIP-1 between WD40 repeats 2 and 3 and repeats 4 and 5 were cloned by PCR amplification with two sets of primers: 5′-CTTAGGTACCGGAAAGCAGCTGGCCCTT-3′ and 5′-ATGCTGCAGCCATGGATCTAGAATCTTCATGTAGGGCTCA-3′, which amplify the region corresponding to amino acids 83–142, and 5′-ACGAATTCATGCCATGGACAACTCTTGAACATCAG and 5′-GTACTGCAGTTCGAAGTACTGTCTTCCAAACTCTTCTTC corresponding to amino acids 218–280 plus 317–320. The short region of the first 6 amino acids of TRIP-1, preceding the first WD40 repeat, plus 7 amino acids between repeats 1 and 2 (amino acids 40–46), was encoded by the synthetic oligonucleotides 5′-AATTCATGAAGCCGATCCTACTGGTTAACGGTGAGAGGCTGGGTAC and 5′-CCAGCCTCTCACCGTTAACCAGTAGGATCGGCTTCATG. Following amplification of the upstream segment corresponding to amino acids 83–142 and cloning into the KpnI and PstI sites of pUC19, the latter two annealed oligos were cloned into the EcoRI and KpnI sites to create the Δ7 plasmid. The downstream inter-WD40 repeat region (amino acids 218–280 plus 317–320) was cloned into the EcoRI and PstI sites of pBluescriptIISK+, yielding the Δ8 plasmid. The Δ7 insert was then removed by EcoRI and NcoI digestion of the Δ7 plasmid and cloned into the corresponding EcoRI and NcoI sites of the Δ8 plasmid, thus creating the Δ9 plasmid. The TRIP-1-Myc plasmid was then digested with EcoRI and BstBI, removing the entire TRIP-1 coding sequence except for the last 5 amino acids of TRIP-1 and the epitope tag. TheEcoRI/BstBI fragment from the Δ9 plasmid was then inserted into this linearized vector to create the ΔWD-Myc construct, which contains all the non-WD40 repeat residues of TRIP-1 with the exception of 8 residues between repeats 3 and 4 (amino acids 176–183). The C-terminal Flag-tagged type II TGF-β receptor was described previously (22Chen R.-H. Derynck R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22868-22874Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as were the expression plasmids for Smads 3 and 4 (9Zhang Y. Feng X.-H. Wu R.-Y. Derynck R. Nature. 1996; 383: 168-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar). The type I receptor mutant, T202D, was derived from the rat R4 type I TGF-β receptor (23He W. Gustafson M. Hirobe S. Donahoe P. Dev. Dynamics. 1993; 196: 133-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) and contained a mutation of threonine 202 to an aspartic acid, resulting in a constitutively active receptor kinase that signaled in a ligand-independent manner 3X.-H. Feng and R. Derynck, unpublished data. similar to the analogous mutation in the human type I receptor TβRI, T204D (24Wieser R. Wrana J. Massagué J.

Mink lung epithelial cell lines (Mv1Lu; CCl-64, American Type Culture Collection, and the mutant derivative cell line DR26, provided by Dr. J. Massagué), were maintained in minimal essential Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% non-essential amino acids, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin solution, at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. The human keratinocyte cell line HaCaT (provided by Dr. N. Fusenig (25Boukamp P. Petrussevska R.T. Breitkreutz D. Hornung J. Markham A. Fusenig N.E. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 761-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (3491) Google Scholar)) and COS-1 cells (CRL 1650, American Type Culture Collection) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% FBS and 1% penicillin-streptomycin solution, in a 37 °C humidified incubator with 5% CO2. HaCaT cells were plated at 1.8 × 105 cells/well of 6-well dishes 2 days prior to transfection. Transfection was by the LipofectAMINE method (Life Technologies, Inc.), using per well 0.8 μg of expression construct, 0.4 μg of pSVβgal, and 0.4 μg of reporter DNA, and 4 μl of LipofectAMINE reagent. Transfection of mink lung epithelial cell lines was performed via an electroporation method as described (26Feng X.-H. Filvaroff E.H. Derynck R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24237-24245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), except that the plasmid pSVβgal was used in place of pRKβGAL, for normalization of transfection efficiency. Typically, 5 μg each of reporter, pSVβgal, and pBluescriptIISK+ were transfected along with 25 μg of expression construct. When the quantity of expression construct was less than 25 μg, it was brought up to 25 μg with additional pRK5 plasmid. After transfection, the cells were allowed to recover for 4–18 h in regular growth medium, after which they were transferred to the same medium but with 0.2% rather than 10% FBS, whereas some wells were treated with TGF-β. 2 days after transfection, the cells were harvested into reporter lysis buffer (Promega). Luciferase activity of the lysates was analyzed using Analytic Luminescence Laboratory assay reagents and luminometer Monolight 2010. β-Galactosidase activity in the same lysates was analyzed using the Galacto-Light Plus reagents from Tropix. Values were derived from duplicate or triplicate determinations, and all experiments were performed at least three times. COS-1 cells were plated the day before transfection at a density of approximately 1.2 × 106cells/10-cm dish. Cells were transfected via the LipofectAMINE method, using per dish 20 μl of the reagent and 5 μg of DNA. Approximately 32 h post-transfection, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and placed in 3 ml/dish of a labeling medium, consisting of cysteine- and methionine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% dialyzed FBS and 0.5 mCi of EasyTag Express Labeling mix (NEN Life Science Products). After overnight incubation, lysates were prepared and precleared with protein A-Sepharose saturated with rabbit anti-mouse IgG (Jackson Laboratories) as described (22Chen R.-H. Derynck R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22868-22874Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation and sequential immunoprecipitation was performed as described (22Chen R.-H. Derynck R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22868-22874Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using an anti-Myc monoclonal 9E10 (provided by Dr. J. M. Bishop, University of California, San Francisco) or an anti-Flag M2 monoclonal antibody (Kodak). Immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. The two best characterized responses to TGF-β receptor activation are the induction of extracellular matrix protein genes and growth inhibition. Both responses can be used to evaluate receptor function using transient transfection assays, whereby the levels of luciferase expression, directed from defined promoters, are measured in response to TGF-β. Transcription of a luciferase reporter from the PAI-1 promoter segment is frequently used to measure induction of extracellular matrix protein synthesis (27Keeton M.R. Curriden S.A. van Zonneveld A.J. Loskutoff D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23048-23052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Wrana J.L. Cárcamo J. Attisano L. Cheifetz S. Zentella A. Lopez C.F. Massagué J. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1992; 57: 81-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), whereas the inhibitory effect of TGF-β on cell proliferation can be conveniently assessed by the decrease of luciferase expression from the cyclin A promoter (26Feng X.-H. Filvaroff E.H. Derynck R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24237-24245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). To determine whether TRIP-1 plays a role in TGF-β signaling, we used these transient transfection assays to assess the effect of increased TRIP-1 expression from an expression plasmid on luciferase expression from a cotransfected luciferase reporter plasmid, in the absence or presence of TGF-β. Transcription of the PAI-1-luciferase reporter p800luc, which increases in response to TGF-β treatment (27Keeton M.R. Curriden S.A. van Zonneveld A.J. Loskutoff D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23048-23052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was measured in the presence or absence of a cotransfected TRIP-1 expression plasmid. As shown in Fig. 1 A, increased TRIP-1 expression inhibited transcription from the PAI-1 promoter and strongly repressed its stimulation by TGF-β in the human HaCaT keratinocyte cell line. Similar data were obtained in Mv1Lu cells (data not shown and Figs. 3, 4, 6, and 7). The moderate inhibition of transcription from the PAI-1 promoter in the absence of exogenous TGF-β was not due to a general inhibition of transcription, because the luciferase expression levels were normalized to an internal control (β-galactosidase expression), and, furthermore, TRIP-1 overexpression did not result in a similar decrease in β-galactosidase expression (data not shown). In contrast to the effect of TRIP-1 on expression from the PAI-1 promoter, the luciferase expression from the cyclin A promoter was not significantly affected by increased TRIP-1 expression (Fig. 1 B). Our results therefore indicate that TRIP-1 expression inhibits the TGF-β response, but selectively affects the induction of PAI-1 gene expression and not the expression from the cyclin A promoter. This differential responsiveness may reflect a selectivity for the gene induction response, without affecting the growth inhibitory response.Figure 3The inhibition of the PAI-1 response, induced by an activated type I TGF-β receptor, by TRIP-1 depends to a large extent on the type II TGF-β receptor. Wild-type Mv1Lu (A) or type II receptor-deficient DR26 cells (B) were transfected with the p800luc reporter plasmid with or without the T202D type I TGF-β receptor and/or TRIP-1 expression plasmids.

Cells were metabolically 35S-labeled, and immunoprecipitations (I.P.) of cell lysates were carried out with anti-Myc or anti-Flag antibodies or sequentially with anti-Myc and then anti-Flag antibodies.

For this purpose we used the cell line DR26, a mutant cell line derived from Mv1Lu cells, which lacks functional type II receptors (29Laiho M. Weis M.B. Massagué J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18518-18524Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In DR26 cells, TRIP-1 caused a moderate inhibition of the transcription from the PAI-1 promoter (Fig. 2), but this decrease was less than the TRIP-1-mediated inhibition of PAI-1 expression in wild-type Mv1Lu cells in the absence of TGF-β. Introduction of the type II receptor by transfection resulted not only in the acquisition of TGF-β responsiveness but also in a strong inhibition of PAI-1 expression (Fig. 2). These data indicate that TRIP-1 strongly inhibits the TGF-β-induced PAI-1 expression and suggest that although the inhibitory effect of TRIP-1 in wild-type cells depends in part on a functional TGF-β receptor complex, there is an additional receptor-independent inhibition. However, the effect of TRIP-1 in wild-type Mv1Lu cells without TGF-β treatment may be due in part to a decrease in autocrine signaling by endogenous TGF-β, consistent with previous observations (30McCaffrey T.A. Falcone D.J. Brayton C.F. Agarwal L.A. Welt F.G. Weksler B.B. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 441-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Because TRIP-1 interacts with the type II but not the type I receptor (1Chen R.H. Miettinen P.J. Maruoka E.M. Choy L. Derynck R. Nature. 1995; 377: 548-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), the possibility exists that TRIP-1 expression might not inhibit PAI-1 expression induced by a constitutively activated type I TGF-β receptor. Indeed, a mutant TβRI type I receptor has been described in which Thr at position 204 has been replaced by Asp, i.e. the T204D mutant (24Wieser R. Wrana J. Massagué J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2199-2208Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar), thus resulting in increased activity. However, whereas this mutant type I receptor has a higher basal activity than the wild-type I receptor, ligand binding to the type II receptor and subsequent transphosphorylation of type I by the type II receptor still enhances its activity considerably (24Wieser R. Wrana J. Massagué J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2199-2208Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar, 31Luo K. Lodish H.F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4485-4496Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Thus, we expressed the mutated TβRI (T202D for the rat version of TβRI) into Mv1Lu cells and assessed the effect of TRIP-1 on the PAI-1 response. As shown in Fig. 3 A, the T202D type I receptor induced a ligand-dependent response, and TRIP-1 expression exhibited a strong inhibition of transcription from the PAI-1 promoter in these cells. Because this inhibition may be due to the dependence of the signaling by the mutant TβRI on functional type II receptors, consistent with previous findings (31Luo K. Lodish H.F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4485-4496Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), we assessed the effect of TRIP-1 on induction of the PAI-1 response in the type II receptor-defective DR26 cells. In these cells, the activated type I receptor exhibited ligand independence and could therefore be considered to be independent of the type II receptor for its action. Under these conditions, the ability of TRIP-1 to inhibit signaling to PAI-1 was severely curtailed (Fig. 3 B), suggesting that the inhibitory activity of TRIP-1 depends to a considerable extent on a functional type II receptor and TGF-β receptor complex. We next examined the ability of TRIP-1 to inhibit the induction of transcription from the PAI-1 promoter by Smad3 and 4, which act as effectors of TGF-β signaling following receptor activation (3Heldin C.-H.

Lens epithelial cells express relatively low levels of αA, but in differentiated fiber cells, αA is the most abundant soluble protein. The lenses of αA-knock-out mice develop opacities at an early age, implying a critical role for αA in the maintenance of fiber cell transparency. However, the function of α-crystallin in the lens epithelium is unknown. To investigate the physiological function of αA in lens epithelial cells, we used the following two systems: αA knock-out (αA(−/−)) mouse lens epithelial cells and human lens epithelial cells that overexpress αA. The growth rate of αA(−/−) mouse lens epithelial cells was reduced by 50% compared with wild type cells. Cell cycle kinetics, measured by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis of propidium iodide-stained cells, indicated a relative deficiency of αA(−/−) cells in the G2/M phases. Exposure of mouse lens epithelial cells to physiological levels of UVA resulted in an increase in the number of apoptotic cells in the cultures. Four hours after irradiation the fraction of apoptotic cells in the αA(−/−) cultures was increased 40-fold over wild type. In cells lacking αA, UVA exposure modified F-actin, but actin was protected in cells expressing αA. Stably transfected cell lines overexpressing human αA were generated by transfecting extended life span human lens epithelial cells with the mammalian expression vector construct pCI-neoαA. Cells overexpressing αA were resistant to UVA stress, as determined by clonogenic survival. αA remained cytoplasmic after exposure to either UVA or thermal stress indicating that, unlike other sHSPs, the protective effect of αA was not associated with its relocalization to the nucleus. These results indicate that αA has important cellular functions in the lens over and above its well characterized role in refraction. αA-Crystallin (αA) is a member of the small heat shock protein (sHSP) family and has the ability to prevent denatured proteins from aggregating in vitro.

Evol. 1993; 10: 103-126PubMed Google Scholar, 2Ingolia T.D. Craig E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 2360-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar) suggest that during evolution α-crystallin may have been recruited as a refractive protein in the lens through a gene-sharing mechanism involving duplication of an ancestral sHSP gene (3Sax C.M. Piatigorsky J. Adv. Enzymol . Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1994; 69: 155-201PubMed Google Scholar). Like other sHSPs, αA and αB polypeptides can act as molecular chaperones in vitro, preventing protein aggregation induced by heat and other stresses (4Horwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10449-10453Crossref PubMed Scopus (1738) Google Scholar). The two subunits are differentially distributed within the lens with αA maximally expressed in the lens fibers and αB highest in the epithelium (3Sax C.M. Piatigorsky J. Adv. Enzymol . Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1994; 69: 155-201PubMed Google Scholar). Of the two subunits, αA expression is considered to be more lens-specific but only αB expression is induced by stress (3Sax C.M. Piatigorsky J. Adv. Enzymol . Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1994; 69: 155-201PubMed Google Scholar, 5Klemenz R. Frohli E. Steiger R.H. Schafer R. Aoyama A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3652-3656Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). At present, the tertiary and quaternary structures, in vivo functions, and mechanism of chaperone action of the α-crystallin aggregates are largely enigmatic. α-Crystallin is the most abundant soluble protein in the lens and plays an important role in establishing the refractive index of the cytoplasm. However, the extralenticular expression of α-crystallins, their autokinase activity, phosphorylation patterns, association with neurodegenerative diseases, and ability to protect against heat shock argue for a more generalized cellular function of α-crystallins, over and above their role in image formation (3Sax C.M. Piatigorsky J. Adv. Enzymol . Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1994; 69: 155-201PubMed Google Scholar, 5Klemenz R. Frohli E. Steiger R.H. Schafer R. Aoyama A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Current understanding of the cellular functions of molecular chaperones is based largely on the roles of the HSP60 and HSP70 chaperone families in protein translocation, folding, and assembly (11Hartl F.U. Nature. 1996; 381: 571-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (3101) Google Scholar, 12Ellis R.J. The Chaperonins. Academic Press, New York1996Google Scholar). Members of these families play vital roles in normal growth and development and prevent stress-induced denaturation of other proteins. A key element of their function is their ability to prevent improper protein associations by binding to transiently exposed hydrophobic protein surfaces. Although sHSPs are also believed to be important for normal cell growth and differentiation (for example, HSP27 protects cells during stress by preserving actin microfilaments and preventing apoptotic cell death (13Arrigo A-P.

Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994: 335-373Google Scholar, 14Mehlen P. Schulze-Ostoff K. Arrigo A.-P. J. Biol.

Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 273-279PubMed Google Scholar)), little information is available regarding the cellular functions of this family in general and α-crystallins in particular. Because of its location on the optic axis of the eye, the lens is exposed to solar ultraviolet radiation (UVA and UVB). UV irradiation generates photooxidative stress within the tissue and is thought to be one of the factors contributing to deleterious age- and cataract-induced changes in the lens. Much of the UV radiation entering the eye is blocked by the cornea, but about 0.001 W/cm2 of UVA reaches the lens epithelium. Chronic exposure of animal models to this irradiance produces lens opacities in vivo (16Zigman S. Paxia T. McDaniel T. Lou M.F. Yu N.-T. Invest. Ophthalmol. & Visual Sci. 1991; 32: 1723-1732PubMed Google Scholar). UVA-induced lens opacification is thought to result from the generation of reactive oxygen species such as singlet oxygen, superoxide, hydrogen peroxide, and hydroxyl radicals (16Zigman S. Paxia T. McDaniel T. Lou M.F. Yu N.-T. Invest. Ophthalmol. & Visual Sci. 1991; 32: 1723-1732PubMed Google Scholar). Since α-crystallin has been found to prevent both UV- and singlet oxygen-induced aggregation of proteins in vitro, it may also protect lens proteins from photooxidative changes in vivo (17Borkman R.F. Knight G. Obi B. Exp. Eye Res. 1996; 62: 141-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 18Andley U.P. Mathur S. Griest T.A. Petrash J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31973-31980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Additionally, studies on cultured mammalian cells indicate that the overexpression of αA in mammalian cells confers increased thermoresistance on these cells, suggesting a relationship between the in vitromolecular chaperone activity and in vivo thermoprotection (19van den Ijssel P.R.L.A. Overkamp P. Knauf U. Gaestel M. de Jong W.W. FEBS Lett. 1994; 355: 54-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Although the physiological significance of its thermoprotective property is not known, αA may promote the survival of cells (such as those in the lens epithelium) that are proximal to sources of environmental stress. Recent studies on mice deficient in αA have demonstrated a critical role for this protein in the maintenance of lens transparency (20Brady J.P. Garland D. Douglas-Tabor Y. Robison Jr., W.G. Groome A. Wawrousek E.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 884-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Lenses of αA(−/−) mice are smaller in size and develop opacities as a result of the presence of inclusion bodies in the fiber cells. The inclusion bodies contain both αB-crystallin and HSP25 (21Wawrousek E.F. Brady J.P. Invest. Ophthalmol. & Visual Sci. 1997; 38 (Abstr. 2733): 586PubMed Google Scholar). This observation suggests that one function of αA in the lens may be to ensure the solubility of other important chaperones. In the current work, we have investigated the in vivo functions of αA using lens epithelial cells from normal and αA(−/−) mice. We have also investigated the effect of overexpression of αA in extended-life span human lens epithelial cells. Our results demonstrate a critical role for αA in lens cell growth. We also show that a photoprotective phenotype can be conferred on lens epithelial cells in culture by the expression of αA-crystallin. Mouse and human lens epithelial cell cultures were used in this study. The wild type mouse strain was the 129SvJ mouse. αAKO-127 αA(−/−) mice were made by targeted disruption of the αA gene (20Brady J.P. Garland D. Douglas-Tabor Y. Robison Jr., W.G. Groome A. Wawrousek E.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 884-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Mouse lenses were obtained from 6- to 12-week-old mice. Capsule epithelia of wild type and αA(−/−) lenses were dissected and cultured in 20% fetal bovine serum in Eagle's minimum essential medium in 24-well tissue culture plates (Falcon). Cells were passaged using trypsin-EDTA and plated in 35-mm plates. In some experiments, cells were grown on sterile glass coverslips (with or without collagen coating) to facilitate microscopic examination. Cultures were fed twice weekly. Human lens epithelial cells with extended life span (HLE B-3 cells) have been described previously (22Andley U.P. Rhim J.S. Chylack L.T. Fleming T.P. Invest. Ophthalmol. & Visual Sci. 1994; 35: 3094-3102PubMed Google Scholar). They were derived from an infant human lens epithelial culture by Ad12-SV40 hybrid virus infection and propagated through at least 11 passages. After passage 11, HLE B-3 cells cease to produce αA (as determined by Western blot) (23Fleming T.P. Song Z. Andley U.P. Invest. Ophthalmol. & Visual Sci. 1998; 39: 1387-1398PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, αA cDNA can be reintroduced into these cells by cDNA transfection, and stably transfected cell lines expressing different amounts of αA can be generated. The HLE B-3 cells were cultured in 20% fetal bovine serum in Eagle's minimum essential medium according to published procedures (22Andley U.P. Rhim J.S. Chylack L.T. Fleming T.P. Invest. Ophthalmol. & Visual Sci. 1994; 35: 3094-3102PubMed Google Scholar, 23Fleming T.P. Song Z. Andley U.P. Invest. Ophthalmol. & Visual Sci. 1998; 39: 1387-1398PubMed Google Scholar). A full-length cDNA clone containing the complete coding sequence of the αA gene was taken from the vector pDirect (18Andley U.P. Mathur S. Griest T.A. Petrash J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31973-31980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The αA cDNA was cloned into the XbaI and SalI site of the mammalian expression vector, pCI-neo (Promega). This vector utilized the cytomegalovirus immediate-early enhancer/promoter region for strong constitutive expression of the αA gene. The neor marker allowed for stable transfectants to be isolated. The pCI-neoαA was stably transfected into HLE B-3 cells by standard calcium phosphate protocols. Two days post-transfection, the cells were trypsinized and subcultured 1:3, and geneticin was added for colony selection. Geneticin-resistant colonies were isolated, and individual colonies were expanded into mass cultures. Cultures were examined by Western blot for the expression of αA and compared with mock-transfected cells (cells transfected with vector lacking αA insert). The transfection efficiency as determined by Western blot analysis was found to be 10–20% in different transfection assays. The antibodies used for Western blot analysis of αA were a polyclonal antiserum to bovine lens α-crystallin (at a dilution of 1:1000) or a monoclonal antiserum to bovine αA (at a dilution of 1:100). For Western blotting analysis of αB, a polyclonal antiserum raised against the 21-amino acid C-terminal peptide of human αB was used at a dilution of 1:1000. Immune complexes were detected using 125I-protein A. Western blotting was used to examine the expression of αA and αB in primary mouse lens epithelial cultures, to confirm the lack of endogenous αA in untransfected HLE-B3 cells after passage 11 and, in stably transfected HLE B-3 cells, to select those cell lines expressing the highest levels of αA. The latter were used to determine the effect of physiological levels of UVA stress as a function of αA expression level. Cells were exposed to levels of UVA radiation comparable to in vivo levels (24Zigman S. Optom. Vision Sci. 1995; 72: 899-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Cells were washed twice with PBS containing CaCl2 and MgCl2, and a layer of PBS was added to the controls and cells to be irradiated. UVA radiation at 365 nm was obtained from a Hg-Xe arc lamp using a monochromator, focusing lens, and beam turner to give a fluence rate of 0.007 W/cm2 and a total fluence of 37.8 J/cm2 unless indicated otherwise (25Andley U.P. Lewis R.M. Reddan J.R. Kochevar I.E. Invest. Ophthalmol. & Visual Sci. 1994; 35: 367-373PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were either processed immediately or incubated for up to 20 h after irradiation in normal tissue culture medium. In some experiments, UVB radiation (302 nm, total fluence 0.02 J/cm2) or heat treatment (45 °C, 30 min) was also used as a stress inducer. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, pH 7.4, for 30 min, permeabilized for 30 min in 0.1% Triton X-100/PBS at room temperature, and washed for 20 min in PBS as described previously (26Bassnett S. Mataic D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 37-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Apoptotic nuclei were detected using a TUNEL-labeling reaction according to the manufacturer's instructions (Boehringer Mannheim). This reaction utilizes fluorescein-labeled nucleotides that are incorporated at the 3′-OH ends of DNA molecules by the enzyme terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase. In some cases, fixed and permeabilized cells were pretreated with DNase I (Boehringer Manneheim, 50 μg/ml in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.6) for 10 min at room temperature as a positive control. In each experiment, some samples were labeled with the mix lacking the terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase enzyme, as a negative control. To determine the proportion of apoptotic cells in a culture, cells were co-labeled with 4′,6-damidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), a DNA-binding fluorophore which fluoresces in the UV region. TUNEL-positive nuclei and DAPI-labeled nuclei were visualized using a fluorescence microscope (Axioskop; Zeiss). Images were recorded on a cooled CCD camera (Photometrix), and the number of TUNEL-positive nuclei and total nuclei were counted using image analysis software (Metamorph; Universal Imaging Corp.). HLE B-3 cells overexpressing varying levels of αA and untransfected or mock-transfected controls were used to compare the effect of αA expression on long term cell survival of cells exposed to UVA stress. Cell survival was determined by the relative colony-forming ability of the cells when plated at low densities (25Andley U.P. Lewis R.M. Reddan J.R. Kochevar I.E. Invest. Ophthalmol. & Visual Sci. 1994; 35: 367-373PubMed Google Scholar). Here, survival is defined as the long term reproductive potential of the cells and does not refer to individual cell death. Cells were exposed to various fluences of UVA radiation. Immediately after irradiation, cells were trypsinized, and approximately 8 × 103 cells per ml were suspended in culture medium. An aliquot of the suspension was counted using a Coulter counter, and cells were diluted to 200 cells/ml. Colony-forming ability was determined by plating 200, 100, and 50 cells per well in a 24-well plate containing 1 ml of tissue culture medium. The cultures were allowed to incubate undisturbed for 7–10 days. Colonies formed were stained with 0.5% methylene blue and counted. The surviving fraction at each UVA fluence was calculated as the ratio of the colony-forming abilities of the irradiated and non-irradiated controls. Wild type or αA(−/−) lens epithelial cells in passage 1 or 2 were subcultured in 24-well plates (2 × 103 cells per well) for a period of 2 weeks. Cultures were fed twice weekly. Cell numbers were measured on specific days after trypsinization using a Coulter counter (27Andley U.P. Walsh A. Kochevar I.E. Reddan J.R. Curr. Eye Res. 1990; 9: 1099-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Wild type or αA(−/−) cells (106 cells) were washed with PBS, and cell pellets were labeled for 30 min on ice with propidium iodide (50 μg/ml) in 0.1% sodium citrate containing 0.3% Nonidet P-40 and 20 μg/ml ribonuclease A, pH 8.3. The percentage of cells in each phase of the cell cycle was determined by a flow cytometer (Becton-Dickinson FACScan) using the Cell Quest software. Flow cytometry was also used to determine the effect of UVA radiation on cell death in HLE B-3 cells overexpressing various levels of αA-crystallin. Cells exposed to UVA radiation were labeled with propidium iodide and a plot of forward light scatter (cell size) versus the side scatter (cell surface area) was determined using the FACScan. Immunofluorescence was carried out as described previously (26Bassnett S. Mataic D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 37-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS for 30 min at room temperature and then permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100 for 30 min. Nonspecific binding was blocked by incubation in 10% normal goat serum for 30 min. To visualize the distribution of αA, cells were incubated overnight at 4 °C in a 1:100 dilution of a monoclonal antibody raised against bovine αA. A lissamine rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG was used as the secondary antibody. To visualize the organization of F-actin, fixed and permeabilized cells were incubated in a 1:50 dilution in PBS of a fluorescein phalloidin (Molecular Probes Inc.) methanolic stock solution (100 units/ml of methanol). Cells were stained with fluorescein phalloidin for 20 min, washed 3 times for 5 min in PBS, and viewed. Lens epithelial cells were viewed using a Zeiss LSM 410 confocal microscope equipped with an argon-krypton laser. To study the effect of αA expression on lens epithelial cell function, cultured human and mouse lens epithelial cells were utilized. Since primary cultures of human cells cannot be propagated for more than three passages, we chose to use the SV40-immortalized human lens epithelial cell line HLE B-3, as a model system. HLE B-3 cells do not express αA after passage 11. This allows the effect of αA expression to be examined in transfection experiments against a null background. However, one limitation of this approach is that late passage HLE B-3 cells may differ from normal epithelial cells in ways other than the level of αA expression. For this reason we also chose to examine an alternative murine model. Gene knock-out technology has been used recently to create αA-deficient mice (20Brady J.P. Garland D. Douglas-Tabor Y. Robison Jr., W.G. Groome A. Wawrousek E.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 884-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar), and primary cultures of lens capsule-epithelial explants from these animals were therefore used in the present studies. αA is the major soluble protein of lens fiber cells. Immunofluorescence microscopy of lens slices from wild type mice confirmed the high levels of expression of αA in the lens fiber cells (data not shown). In these preparations the level of αA immunostaining in the lens epithelium was comparably high. In αA(−/−) lenses, αA immunofluorescence was undetectable in either the fibers or epithelium, confirming the efficacy of the αA gene deletion (data not shown). The lack of αA immunofluorescence in the αA(−/−) lenses also demonstrated the specificity of the monoclonal antibody used in these studies. The differences in αA expression between wild type and αA(−/−) lenses were conserved in primary cell cultures derived from these lenses (Fig. 1, A and B, respectively). Interestingly, although there was strong αA immunostaining in primary epithelial cell cultures from wild type lenses, αA was not evenly dispersed in the cytoplasm. In wild type cells, αA was localized in discrete cytoplasmic patches of 5–20 μm in diameter (Fig. 1 A). As expected, there was no evidence of αA expression in αA(−/−) cells (Fig. 1 B). Although both cell types contained well organized actin stress fibers and had similar overall morphologies, the αA(−/−) cells were consistently larger than wild type cells. This observation was confirmed independently by FACS analysis (data not shown). The absence of αA protein from primary epithelial cultures derived from αA(−/−) lenses was confirmed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 2). In wild type cultures, a prominent immunoreactive band was detected at the expected molecular mass of ∼21 kDa. This band was absent from the primary culture of αA(−/−) cells. A second, higher molecular weight band, at ∼24 kDa in the wild type cultures, may represent the αA insert protein (28King C.R. Piatigorsky J. Cell. 1983; 32: 707-712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). In the lens, α-crystallin exists as a high molecular weight complex of two polypeptides, αA and αB. Because αA and αB can each act as a molecular chaperone (4Horwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10449-10453Crossref PubMed Scopus (1738) Google Scholar) and because the expression of αA has been shown to influence the expression and distribution of αB (20Brady J.P. Garland D. Douglas-Tabor Y. Robison Jr., W.G. Groome A. Wawrousek E.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 884-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar), we also tested the cultured cells for the presence of αB (Fig. 2). Approximately equal amounts of αB were present in the αA(−/−) and wild type cultures. In primary cell cultures, capsule epithelial explants from αA(−/−) and wild type mouse lenses showed lens epithelial cell outgrowth within 3–4 days (Fig. 3,A and B). Cells harvested from wild type cells and αA(−/−) cells showed similar attachment efficiencies (50–60%) when subcultured. When cell growth was monitored over a period of 11 days, αA(−/−) grew significantly more slowly than wild type controls. In medium containing 10 or 20% serum, the growth rate for αA(−/−) cells was approximately 50% that of wild type cells (Fig. 3, C and D). In 5% serum, cell growth was substantially diminished for both the αA-deficient and wild type cells (Fig. 3 E). The finding that primary cultures of αA(−/−) lens epithelial cells had a slower growth rate than wild type cells suggested that the molecular chaperone αA may affect cell cycle kinetics. To explore this further, propidium iodide-labeled cells from primary cultures of wild type and αA(−/−) lens epithelial cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. Compared with wild type cells, where 15% of the cells were in the G2/M phases, only 2% of αA(−/−) cells were in the G2/M phases (Fig. 4). Since the number of cells in S phase was similar for both cell types (5–6%), this result indicates that αA(−/−) cells are blocked after S phase of the cell cycle. The inhibition of cell growth observed in αA(−/−) cultures (Fig. 3) could also be explained by increased levels of apoptosis in these cultures. In this regard it is interesting to note that other sHSPs and HSP70 have been found to protect cells from apoptosis induced by a variety of stresses. To determine whether the rate of apoptosis differed between wild type and αA(−/−) lens epithelial cells, we used a TUNEL assay of cells cultured under normal or UVA stress conditions. TUNEL-labeled nuclei were not observed in untreated wild type control cells (Fig. 5 A) but were present at low levels (0.2%) in untreated αA(−/−) cells (Fig. 5 C). Lens epithelial cells are exposed to UVA radiation (∼0.001 W/cm2) in vivo on a daily basis, and UVA radiation has been found to produce lens opacities in animal models. We therefore examined the effect of UVA radiation (0.007 W/cm2for 90 min, giving a total fluence of 37.8 J/cm2) on apoptosis in primary cultures of wild type and αA(−/−) lens epithelial cells. Four hours after UVA irradiation, the major morphological change in wild type cells was the formation of rings of F-actin around the cell nuclei (Fig. 5 B). Previous studies on skin fibroblasts exposed to UVA radiation have shown a similar redistribution of actin into perinuclear rings (29Zamansky G.B. Nguyen U. Chou I.-N. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1992; 22: 296-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). TUNEL-positive nuclei were rarely observed in irradiated wild type cells. In contrast, TUNEL-positive nuclei were commonly observed in irradiated αA(−/−) cultures (Fig. 5 D). A characteristic of the TUNEL-positive αA(−/−) cells was that actin was either absent from these cells or clumped around the apoptotic nuclei (Fig. 5 D). To quantitate the effect of UVA exposure on apoptosis of wild type and αA(−/−) cells, we counterstained the cultures with DAPI. This allowed the total number of cells in any field to be counted and the proportion of TUNEL-positive cells to be determined. In αA(−/−) cultures, TUNEL-positive cells were occasionally observed even under normal conditions. UVA radiation induced apoptotic cell death in αA(−/−) cells with a maximal effect observed 4 h after UVA treatment. The effect on wild type cells was significantly less (Fig. 6). The αA(−/−) cells had significantly higher number of TUNEL-positive cells 4 h after UVA exposure. This phenomenon was not observed in the wild type cells (Fig. 6). Cultures were exposed to UVA radiation and incubated in medium for different times after exposure. Four hours after UVA exposure, the UVA-treated αA(−/−) cells had 40 times as many apoptotic cells as the wild type UVA-treated cells. The number of apoptotic cells increased from 0.21 ± 0.1% for the wild type to 8.05 ± 0.08% for the αA(−/−) cells. Twenty hours after UVA exposure, TUNEL-positive nuclei in the αA(−/−) cells had decreased. The HLE B-3 cells (passage 12) used for transfection had no detectable levels of αA-crystallin by Western blot analysis (Fig. 7 A)."

This control of transcription is mediated partially through the competition of the individual ς factors for the core enzyme and is a major part of global gene regulation in bacteria (5Zhou Y. Gross C.A. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 7128-7137Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Elucidation of the structural characteristics of the core RNA polymerase-ς factor binding interaction will be very beneficial in fully understanding this aspect of regulation. As the number of identified ς factors increased, it became apparent that they shared several regions of amino acid sequence similarity (1Helmann J.D. Chamberlin M.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 839-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar,6Gribskov M. Burgess R.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 6745-6763Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 7Lonetto M. Gribskov M. Gross C.A. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 3843-3849Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). Work has been ongoing to assign specific functions to these conserved regions (8Waldburger C. Susskind M.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 1489-1500Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 9Dombrowski A.J. Walter W.A. Gross C.A.

Burgess R.R. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7728-7734Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Deletion analysis of ς70identified a segment of the protein that overlaps region 2.1 (residues 361–390) as being necessary and sufficient for core binding (12Lesley S.A. Burgess R.R. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7728-7734Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). A mutation in a homologous region of Bacillus subtilisςE has also been shown to affect core binding (13Shuler M.F. Tatti K.M. Wade K.H. Moran Jr., C.P. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3687-3694Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, recent findings of core binding mutations in other conserved and nonconserved regions of ς32 have led to the idea of multiple binding sites for the ς subunit on the core enzyme (14Joo D.M. Ng N. Calendar R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4907-4912Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 15Zhou Y.N. Walter W.A. Gross C.A. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 5005-5012Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Joo D.M. Nolte A. Calendar R. Zhou Y.N. Jin D.J. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1095-1102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To date, little is known about the location of the ς binding sites on the core subunits. There have been two observations that have identified deletions in the β or β′ subunits that produce subunits still capable of forming core enzyme structures but not holo. First, a β subunit truncation, missing approximately 200 amino acids (aa)1 of the C terminus, was shown by glycerol gradient centrifugation to migrate with the other core subunits but was never seen in the ς-containing fractions (17Glass R.E. Honda A. Ishihama A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1986; 203: 492-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Second, when immunoprecipitation assays were performed using reconstituted RNA polymerase containing β′ deletion mutants missing aa 201–477, the core subunits were recovered in the same fraction but lacked ς (18Luo J. Sharif K.A. Jin R. Fujita N. Ishihama A. Krakow J.S. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 819-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). This idea that ς binding is affected by perturbations of the C terminus of β and the N terminus of β′ is consistent with experiments showing that these two subunit termini are physically close together and can be fused through a flexible linker and still form a functional enzyme (19Severinov K. Mooney R. Darst S.A. Landick R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24137-24140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Recent protein-protein footprinting data have identified a similar region on β′ and two new sites on β for possible interactions with the ς70subunit (20Owens J.T. Miyake R. Murakami K. Chmura A.J. Fujita N. Ishihama A. Meares C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6021-6026Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The β and β′ subunits each contain regions that have high sequence homology with the two largest subunits of eukaryal polymerases (21Allison L.A. Moyle M. Shales M. Ingles C.J. Cell. 1985; 42: 599-610Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 22Sweetser D. Nonet M. Young R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Genet. 1989; 215: 266-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Some of these conserved regions may act as interaction domains. We define an interaction domain as the minimal region of a protein that can independently fold to form the secondary and tertiary structure required to interact with another protein, DNA, RNA, or ligand. Interaction domains will always be larger than the actual binding site, the amino acids in direct contact with the binding partner. Therefore, additional work will be needed to identify the critical residues involved in making binding contacts. Severinovet al. (24Severinov K. Mustaev A. Kashlev M. Borukhov S. Nikiforov V.

This indicates that the properties of the protein do not require the entire intact length of the subunit but rather can be generated with smaller domain modules. In this study, we set out to map the protein-protein interaction domains on both β and β′ required for the binding of ς70. Chemical and enzymatic cleavage as well as PCR methods were used to generate fragments of β and β′ for use in mapping the interaction domains. Using far-Western blotting and nickel nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni2+-NTA) co-immobilization assays (27Kaelin Jr., W.G. Krek W. Sellers W.R. DeCaprio J.A. Ajechenbaum F. Fuchs C.S. Chittenden T. Li Y.

Biol. 1997; 270: 648-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), we were able to map a strong specific binding site for ς70 to the N terminus of β′. This report shows that this binding site is located within a span of residues (260–309) that overlaps conserved region B of β′ (23Jokerst R.S. Weeks J.R. Zehring W.A. Greenleaf A.L. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 215: 266-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Plasmid characteristics are described in Table I. An overexpression vector for C-terminal hexahistidine (His6)-tagged β′ (pTA500) was constructed by removing theXbaI-HindIII fragment from pRL663 and placing it in pET28b (Novagen) (31Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6005) Google Scholar). N-terminally His6-tagged β′ was expressed from pTA499 that was constructed using PCR to place the His6 tag on the N terminus of a fragment that overlapped the NruI site of β′. This fragment was placed into the pET28b vector followed by the insertion of the C-terminal portion of the gene on a NruI-HindIII fragment from pRL663. The C-terminal His6 tag from the pRL663 fragment was removed by replacement of the RsrII-HindIII fragment with a PCR product coding for the wild type C terminus. pTA501 was constructed by creating an N-terminal His6 tag via PCR for a fragment of β, which overlapped the KpnI site of β. The fragment was placed into the pET28b vector. The C terminus of the gene was added by insertion of a KpnI-HindIII fragment containing the wild type coding sequence. pTA502, coding for the C-terminal His6-tagged β subunit, was derived using PCR to insert a N-terminal NcoI site onto a fragment overlappingKpnI. The C-terminal His6-containing fragment was inserted on a KpnI-HindIII fragment from pRL706 (19Severinov K. Mooney R. Darst S.A. Landick R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24137-24140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Vectors expressing unmodified fragments of β′ were obtained by PCR cloning of the desired fragment and placement of the fragment into either pET21a (Novagen) for pTA528, pTA530, pTA535, and pTA536 or pET24a (Novagen) for pTA519 using NdeI and XhoI restriction sites. pTA522–525, pTA531, and pTA533 were all created by amplifying the specified β′ region via PCR and inserted into a pET21a derivative that had been modified to fuse a N-terminal His6 and heart muscle kinase (HMK) recognition site to the expressed proteins. pTA532 and pTA534 were constructed in the same fashion with the exception that the His6-HMK vector derivative was constructed from pET28b. pTA547–549 were created by inserting the fragments, N-terminally truncated via PCR, that overlapped the SnaBI site of β′ into pET24a. The C-terminal coding region of the gene was inserted on aSnaBI-HindIII fragment from pTA500. pTA546 was created by fusing a C-terminal His6 tag directly after residue 309 via PCR. The fragment was placed into the pET24a vector using NdeI and XhoI sites. To use ς70 as a radioactive probe, the HMK site was fused to the N terminus of ς70 along with a His6purification tag. pHMK-His6-ς70 was created by placing the ς70 gene into a derivative of pET28b vector that contained the N-terminal His6 and HMK fusion and adds a total of 13 extra aa (MHHHHHHARRASV) to the N terminus of ς70. All products created by PCR were sequenced to ensure that no mutations had been introduced.Table IPlasmid listPlasmidSubunitResiduesModificationsRef.pTA499β′1–1407N-terminal His6This workpTA500β′1–1407C-terminal His6This workpTA501β1–1342N-terminal His6This workpTA502β1–1342C-terminal His6This workpTA515β′1–260NoneThis workpTA516β′1–280NoneThis workpTA517β′1–300NoneThis workpTA518β′1–309NoneThis workpTA519β′150–309NoneThis workpTA522β′1–260N-terminal His6-HMKThis workpTA523β′1–280N-terminal His6-HMKThis workpTA524β′1–300N-terminal His6-HMKThis workpTA525β′1–309N-terminal His6-HMKThis workpTA528β′60–309NoneThis workpTA530β′100–309NoneThis workpTA531β′33–309N-terminal His6-HMKThis workpTA532β′60–309N-terminal His6-HMKThis workpTA533β′100–309N-terminal His6-HMKThis workpTA534β′150–309N-terminal His6-HMKThis workpTA535β′178–309NoneThis workpTA536β′200–309NoneThis workpTA537β′178–309N-terminal His6-HMKThis workpTA538β′200–309N-terminal His6-HMKThis workpTA540β′260–1407C-terminal His6This workpTA546β′260–309C-terminal His6This workpTA547β′270–1407C-terminal His6This workpTA548β′280–1407C-terminal His6This workpTA549β′290–1407C-terminal His6This workpRL663β′1–1407C-terminal His630pRL706β1–1342C-terminal His619pHMK-His6-ς70ς701–618N-terminal His6-HMKThis workpLN12ς701–618None35Characteristics of subunits and subunit fragments used in binding assays Open table in a new tab Characteristics of subunits and subunit fragments used in binding assays Plasmids were transformed into BL21(DE3) (Novagen) for expression (31Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6005) Google Scholar). The cells were grown in 1-liter cultures at 37 °C in LB medium with either 100 μg/ml ampicillin or 50 μg/ml kanamycin. The cultures were grown to an A 600between 0.6 and 0.8 and then induced with 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Three hours after induction, the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 8,000 ×g for 15 min and frozen at −20 °C until use. The cells were thawed and resuspended in 10 ml of lysis buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 0.3 m KCl, 10 mm EDTA, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and lysozyme was added to 100 μg/ml. The cells were incubated on ice for 15 min then sonicated three times in 60-s bursts. The recombinant protein in the form of inclusion bodies was separated from the soluble lysate by centrifugation at 27,000 ×g for 15 min. The inclusion body pellet was resuspended, by sonication, in 10 ml of lysis buffer + 2% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate. The mixture was centrifuged at 27,000 × g for 15 min and the supernatant discarded. The deoxycholate-washed inclusion bodies were resuspended in 10 ml deionized water and centrifuged at 27,000 × g for 15 min. The water wash was repeated, and the inclusion bodies were aliquoted into 1-mg pellets and frozen at −20 °C until use. ς70 inclusion bodies were solubilized, refolded, and purified according to a variation of the procedure of Gribskov and Burgess (32Gribskov M. Burgess R.R. Gene (Amst.). 1983; 26: 109-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The inclusion bodies were solubilized by resuspension in 6 m guanidine HCl. The proteins were allowed to refold by diluting the denaturant 64-fold with buffer A (50 mmTris-HCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 5% (v/v) glycerol) in 2-fold steps over 2 h. One gram of DE52 resin (Whatman) was added and mixed with slow stirring for 24 h at 4 °C. The resin was then collected in a 10-ml column, washed, and the protein eluted with a gradient from 0.1 to 1 m NaCl in buffer A. The ς70 fractions were pooled and dialyzed overnight against 1 liter of storage buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.1 m NaCl, 0.1 mm DTT, and 50% (v/v) glycerol) and stored at −20 °C. Whole cell lystates were prepared as follows. Cells containing truncated β′ expression plasmids were grown to anA 600 of 0.6–0.8 and induced with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. The cells were grown for an additional 30 min. A 200-μl sample was removed and sonicated 3 × 30 s. 20 μl of glycerol and 20 μl of SDS-sample buffer were added and heated for 2 min at 95 °C then stored at −20 °C until use. β and β′ inclusion bodies were subjected to chemical or enzymatic cleavage (see below) and then purified by nickel affinity chromatography as follows. The cleavage reaction was loaded onto 300 μl of Ni2+-NTA resin (Qiagen) in a Bio-Rad mini-column. The resin had been pre-equilibrated with buffer B (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.9, 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm imidazole, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, and 10% (v/v) glycerol) + 8 m urea. The protein bound resin was washed with 10 column volumes of buffer B + 8 m urea followed by 10 column volumes of buffer B to allow refolding. The resin was then washed with 500 μl of buffer B + 40 mm imidazole. The protein was eluted with 500 μl of buffer B + 200 mm imidazole. The eluted fractions were stored at −20 °C. 1 mg of inclusion body protein was resuspended in 1 ml of buffer B + 8 m urea. DTT was added to 5-fold molar excess over the thiol groups in the protein. The mixture was incubated for 15 min at 37 °C to reduce any disulfide bonds. NTCB was added to 5-fold molar excess over total sulfhydryl groups. The pH was adjusted to 9.5 with NaOH. The reaction mixture was incubated for 2 h at room temperature. The cleavage mixture was diluted 1:10 in buffer B + 8 m urea and loaded onto a Ni2+-NTA column as described above. 1 mg of inclusion body protein was resuspended in 1 ml of buffer B plus 8 m urea. Five-hundred microliters of the solubilized protein were added to 500 μl of hydroxylamine cleavage solution (0.4 m CHES, pH 9.5, 4 m hydroxylamine HCl) and incubated 2 h at 42 °C. β-Mercaptoethanol was added to 0.1 m and incubated 10 min at 37 °C. The mixture was diluted 1:10 in buffer B + 8 m urea and loaded onto a Ni2+-NTA column as described above. 1 mg of inclusion body protein was resuspended in 100 μl of buffer B + 8 m urea and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. Thermolysin was added at protein:protease ratios of 4,000:1, 8,000:1, and 16,000:1 (w/w). Reactions were carried out for 30 min at room temperature. The reactions were loaded onto a Ni2+-NTA column as described above. 1 mg of inclusion body protein was resuspended in 1 ml of buffer B + 8 m urea and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. The mixture was diluted to 4 m urea by adding an equal volume of buffer B. Trypsin was added at protein:protease ratios of 4,000:1, 8,000:1, and 16,000:1 (w/w). Digestion was performed at room temperature for 30 min. The reactions were loaded onto a Ni2+-NTA column as described above. Inclusion body proteins that were resuspended in buffer B + 8 m urea were spotted directly onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell) using a Schleicher & Schuell “MINIFOLD” dot blot apparatus. The wells were washed three times with buffer B. The nitrocellulose was blocked by incubation in HYB buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 200 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm ZnCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.5% (v/v) Tween 20, 1% (w/v) non-fat dry milk) for 16 h at 4 °C. Protein cleavage fragments or whole cell lysates were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). The proteins were electrophoretically transferred onto 0.05-μm nitrocellulose. The nitrocellulose was blocked by incubating in HYB buffer for 16 h at 4 °C. Labeling of ς70 was done in a 100-μl reaction volume. 50 μl of 2 × kinase buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 200 mm NaCl, 24 mm MgCl2, 2 mm DTT, and 50% (v/v) glycerol) was added to 50 μg of ς70 protein. 240 units of cAMP-dependent kinase-catalytic subunit (Promega) was added, and the total volume was brought up to 99 μl with deionized water. One microliter of [γ-32P]ATP (0.15 mCi/μl) was added. The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The reaction mixture was then loaded onto a Biospin-P6 column (Bio-Rad) pre-equilibrated with 1 × kinase buffer and spun at 1,100 ×g for 4 min. The flow-through was collected and stored at −20 °C. The blocked nitrocellulose was incubated in 10 ml of HYB buffer with 4 × 105 cpm/ml32P-labeled ς70 for 3 h at room temperature. The blot was washed three times with 10 ml of HYB buffer for 3 min each. The blot was then dried and exposed to film or PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). One milligram of His6-tagged, truncated β′ was solubilized in 1 ml of buffer C (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm imidazole, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, and 10% (v/v) glycerol) + 8 m urea. Twenty micrograms of the protein solution were loaded onto 150 μl of Ni2+-NTA resin. The column was washed with 15 column volumes of buffer C + 8 m urea, followed by a 15-column volume wash with buffer C to allow refolding. Then 30 μg of native ς70 were loaded onto the column. The column was washed with 20 volumes of buffer C. The bound proteins were eluted with 300 μl of buffer C + 250 mm imidazole. Samples from the ς70 flow-through, wash, and elution fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Previously we developed a method that could be used to map antibody epitopes using histidine-tagged purification of partially cleaved proteins (35Rao L. Jones D.P. Nguyen L.H. McMahan S.A. Burgess R.R. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 241: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). To apply this method for mapping the protein-protein interactions of ς70 on β or β′, we needed to determine whether ς70 could bind to individual β and β′ subunits outside of the core enzyme complex. Far-Western assays of dot blots were used to assess the binding. Inclusion body proteins of β and β′ were separately solubilized in urea and spotted onto nitrocellulose. Bovine serum albumin (BSA) was spotted as a control for nonspecific binding. The nitrocellulose was blocked and the denaturant washed away. The blot was then probed with 32P-labeled ς70. Both β and β′ subunits bound ς70, the BSA control did not (Fig. 1). Identical dot blots were probed with control solutions lacking either the kinase or ς70 to ensure that the signal was not due to nucleotide binding or phosphorylation of the β or β′ subunits. Neither control blot produced a detectable signal (data not shown). Thus, both β and β′ subunits can individually bind ς70. We performed an additional test to assess the specificity of the far-Western analysis using ς70 as a probe. A cell lysate from a log phase culture was separated by SDS-PAGE, blotted onto nitrocellulose, and probed with ς70. The only strong signal produced had the same mobility as β and β′ (Fig. 2 B, lanes C and L). The absence of other strong signals indicates that ς70 is not binding nonspecifically to β and/or β′. Minor bands were observed as expected, since there are other proteins that have been shown to interact with ς70 (activators, anti-ς, etc.) (36Ishihama A. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 2483-2489Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Jishage M. Ishihama A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4953-4958Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). To map the ς70interaction sites on β and β′, we performed far-Western analysis of chemical cleavage products of the two large subunits (Fig. 3). The amino acid sequences of both were analyzed using MacVector software (Oxford Molecular Group) to identify specific chemical cleavage sites. Based on this analysis, cleavage reagents were chosen that produced an array of products following partial digestion that provide the highest resolution for mapping. Both N- and C-terminal His6-tagged constructs of β and β′ were subjected to cleavage under denaturing conditions. The products of the cleavage reaction were purified under denaturing conditions using Ni2+-NTA resin to isolate cleavage fragments containing a His6 tag. These purified fragments were then identified based on their mobility in SDS-PAGE, and their exact size was determined based on the cleavage site which produced them (Fig. 3 A). When the cleavage fragments were fractionated by SDS-PAGE, they produced a ladder of descending sized fragments with a common end (either N or C terminus depending on the placement of the His6 tag). The use of both N- and C-terminally His6-tagged fragments allows the positive identification of both the N and C termini of the interaction domain. The ς70 probe will only bind the fragments that have an intact interaction domain. The N-terminally His6-tagged β′ ladders produced by hydroxylamine and NTCB cleavage both contained several fragments that retained the ability to bind ς70(Fig. 3 B, lanes 3 and 7). Thus, a large portion of the C terminus of β′ can be removed without affecting ς70 binding. The smallest fragment to bind ς70 was the 1–309 aa fragment of β′ in the hydroxylamine ladder (Fig. 3 B, lane 3). In the C-terminally His6-tagged ladders, only full-length β′ bound ς70 (Fig. 3 B, lanes 4 and 8). These results indicated that a strong specific binding site is located within amino acids 1–309 of β′ (β′1–309). The β fragment ladders failed to produce signals strong enough to effectively map the interaction domain. For the remainder of this study, we will focus only on mapping the ς70-β′ interaction domain. The resolution of chemical cleavage mapping was relatively low due to the limited number of cleavage sites on β′ for the reagents available. To increase the number of proteolytic fragments that could be used in mapping, we used enzymatic cleavage. Specificity of cleavage by many proteases is not as limited as with chemical cleavage reagents. Therefore, there are many more sites of cleavage and more fragments are produced. Partial digests of N- and C-terminally His6-tagged β′ were conducted using trypsin and thermolysin. The fragments were again purified, blotted, and probed with ς70. However, even with the increased number of fragments, the interaction domain could not be narrowed from its previous length of 1–309 aa (data not shown). In trying to define this binding site more precisely, we made various truncated fragments using PCR. Using the β′1–309 fragment as a starting point, we made constructs that were truncated at either the N or C terminus. DNA coding for the truncated fragments was cloned into overexpression plasmids. When cells containing these plasmids had been grown to anA 600 of 0.6, expression was induced. The cells were only allowed to grow for 30 min after induction. A whole cell lysate from each culture was made and used for far-Western blotting assays (Fig. 4). Short expression times kept the expression level of the induced protein comparable with the other proteins in the lysate. The use of the whole cell lysate in far-Western blotting assays was an internal control to ensure binding was specific for the protein of interest. This also meant that the various proteins would not have to be purified and could be expressed without purification tags. When constructs were made where the C terminus of β′1–309 was truncated beyond amino acid 300, the binding of ς70 was lost (Fig. 4 A). However, the N terminus of the same fragment could be truncated up to 60 aa without diminishing the signal (Fig. 4 B). β′100–309 still showed binding, but at a lower level, and β′150–309 did not bind ς70. These results narrowed the ς70 binding site to β′60–309. Western blot experiments using anti-β′ monoclonal antibodies were done to ensure that the protein fragments were being transferred to the nitrocellulose and that they were fragments of β′ (data not shown). Ni2+-NTA co-immobilization assays were used to confirm and extend the results that had been produced using far-Western blotting. The proteins to be assayed for binding ς70 were fused to His6 purification tags and overexpressed in the form of inclusion bodies. The inclusion body protein was solubilized with 8 m urea and loaded onto Ni2+-NTA resin. The denaturant was washed away allowing the proteins to refold while still remaining bound to the resin. Native ς70 was then loaded onto the column. The column was washed, and the bound proteins were then eluted with imidazole. Any truncated protein that contained the interaction domain for ς70 would cause ς70 to be bound and to be in the eluted fraction. The results of the these binding experiments are consistent with the far-Western blotting experiments in respect to defining the C-terminal boundary of the domain. β′1–309bound ς70, while β′1–300 and β′1–280 did not bind ς70 (Fig. 5 A–C). Refolded β′1–309 without a His6 tag was mixed with ς70 and passed over the Ni2+-NTA to ensure the complex was not nonspecifically binding to the column. The complex passed through the column and was not seen in the eluted fraction (Fig. 5 D"

Ammonium transporters whose activity can be probed with [14C]methylammonium have been described in several organisms including some cyanobacteria, and amtgenes encoding ammonium/methylammonium permeases have been recently identified in yeast, Arabidopsis thaliana, and some bacteria. The unicellular cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 exhibited a [14C]methylammonium uptake activity that was inhibited by externally added ammonium.

Ammonium is a key compound in the assimilation of nitrogen in numerous biological systems because it is the inorganic form of nitrogen that is incorporated, usually via the glutamine synthetase/glutamate synthase cycle, into carbon skeletons. Ammonium present in the environment can be assimilated by many bacteria, yeast, fungi, algae, and higher plants. Ammonium solutions always contain ammonia (pK a [ammonium/ammonia], 9.25), which can diffuse through biological membranes (1Kleiner D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 639: 41-52Crossref Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 2Kleiner D. Bakker E.P. Alkali Cation Transport Systems in Prokaryotes. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1993: 379-396Google Scholar). Diffusion of ammonia followed by trapping of intracellular ammonium by glutamine synthetase can represent a significant process for nitrogen acquisition, especially in organisms like some bacteria, which can grow in alkaline media. This process would be less important in fungi that grow in acidic media. On the other hand, there is evidence for the presence of ammonium transport systems in numerous organisms (2Kleiner D. Bakker E.P. Alkali Cation Transport Systems in Prokaryotes. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1993: 379-396Google Scholar). The first report of active ammonium uptake, by Hackette et al. (3Hackette S.L. Skye G.E. Burton C. Segel I.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 4241-4250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), concerned the fungus Penicillium chrysogenum. These authors introduced the use of [14C]methylammonium as a probe for the activity of the ammonium permease, a technique that has proven useful to study ammonium transport in many other biological systems including bacteria (4Stevenson R. Silver S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1977; 75: 1133-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) (the pK a of methylammonium/methylamine is 10.65). Bacterial ammonium/methylammonium permeases are commonly repressed by high concentrations of ammonium in a process that, in the enterobacteria, involves the nitrogen control Ntr system (Refs. 5Servı́n-González L. Bastarrachea F. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1984; 130: 3071-3077PubMed Google Scholar and 6Jayakumar A. Schulman I. MacNeil D. Barnes E.M. J.

A gene, amtA, putatively involved in ammonium transport has been described in Escherichia coli (8Faniby J.M. Jayakumar A. Chinault A.C. Barnes E.M. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1991; 137: 983-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), but it rather appears to be involved in cysteine synthesis and has been renamed ascysQ (9Neuwald A.F. Krishman B.R. Brikun I.

On the other hand, genes encoding ammonium/methylammonium permeases have been characterized in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (MEP genes (10Marini A.-M. Vissers S. Urrestarazu A. André B.

Cyanobacteria are organisms that belong to the bacteria (or eubacteria) group (20Giovannoni S.J. Turner S. Olsen G.J. Barns S. Lane D.J. Pace N.R. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 3584-3592Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar) and are characterized by their ability to perform oxygenic photosynthesis. Sources of nitrogen used by many cyanobacteria include nitrate, dinitrogen, urea, and ammonium (21Flores E. Herrero A. Bryant D.A. The Molecular Biology of Cyanobacteria. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1994: 487-517Crossref Google Scholar). In cyanobacteria, incorporation of ammonium into carbon skeletons takes place mainly through the glutamine synthetase/glutamate synthase cycle (Ref. 22Meeks J.C. Wolk C.P. Thomas J. Lockau W. Shaffer P.W. Austin S.M. Chien W.-S. Galonsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 7894-7900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; reviewed in Ref. 21Flores E. Herrero A. Bryant D.A. The Molecular Biology of Cyanobacteria. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1994: 487-517Crossref Google Scholar). The pH values of cyanobacterial growth media are usually above neutral (23Rippka R. Deruelles J. Waterbury J.B. Herdman M. Stanier R.Y. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1979; 111: 1-61Crossref Google Scholar). Diffusion of ammonia through cyanobacterial cytoplasmic membranes has been demonstrated (24Ritchie R.J. Gibson J. J. Membr. Biol. 1987; 95: 131-142Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and can provide, pulled by glutamine synthetase, a mechanism for the net uptake of ammonium (see e.g. Ref. 25Boussiba S. Plant Cell Physiol. 1989; 30: 303-308Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Expression of an ammonium/methylammonium transport activity in some cyanobacterial strains, including Synechococcus sp. PCC 7942,Anabaena azollae, and Anabaena variabilis, has also been reported (26Boussiba S. Dilling W. Gibson J. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 160: 204-210Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Rai A.N. Rowell P. Stewart W.D.P. Arch. Microbiol. 1984; 137: 241-246Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In Synechococcus sp. PCC 7942, the ammonium/methylammonium transport activity is repressed by growth in ammonium-containing medium (28Boussiba S. Gibson J. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1987; 43: 289-293Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar) and requires an intactntcA gene to be expressed (29Vega-Palas M.A. Madueño F. Herrero A. Flores E. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 643-647Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NtcA is a cyanobacterial transcriptional regulator, homologous to Crp from E. coli, that activates the expression of ammonium-repressible genes in the absence of ammonium (30Vega-Palas M.A. Flores E. Herrero A. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 1853-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 31Luque I. Flores E. Herrero A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2862-2869Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The DNA target to which NtcA binds in the promoter of the regulated genes has been characterized in Synechococcus sp. PCC 7942 and contains the sequence signature GTAN8TAC located about 22 bp1 upstream from a −10, Pribnow box in the form TAN3T (31Luque I. Flores E. Herrero A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2862-2869Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). This promoter structure for NtcA-regulated genes is predicted to be valid for other cyanobacteria as well, because the putative helix-turn-helix motif for binding to DNA is identical in the NtcA polypeptides from different sources, including Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 and Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 (32Frı́as J.E. Mérida A. Herrero A. Martı́n-Nieto J. Flores E. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 5710-5713Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The whole sequence of the chromosome of the unicellular cyanobacteriumSynechocystis sp. PCC 6803 has been determined (33Kaneko T. Sato S. Kotani H. Tanaka A. Asamizu E. Nakamura Y. Miyajima N.

In this work, we show that the three putativeamt genes of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 actually provide the cells with the capability to take up [14C]methylammonium from the extracellular medium and are subjected to repression by ammonium. Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803 was grown axenically in BG11 (nitrate-containing) medium (23Rippka R. Deruelles J. Waterbury J.B. Herdman M. Stanier R.Y. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1979; 111: 1-61Crossref Google Scholar) or in BG110 (nitrogen-free) medium supplemented with 5 mm NH4Cl and 10 mm TES-NaOH buffer (pH 7.5). For plates, the medium was solidified with 1%, separately autoclaved agar (Difco). Cultures were grown at 30 °C in the light with shaking (80–90 rpm) for liquid cultures.Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 mutants carrying gene-cassette C.K3 (34Elhai J. Wolk C.P. Gene. 1988; 68: 119-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar) were routinely grown in medium supplemented with 30–50 μg of Km·ml−1, and mutants carrying gene-cassette C.C1 (34Elhai J. Wolk C.P. Gene. 1988; 68: 119-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar) were grown in medium supplemented with 10–80 μg of Cm·ml−1. Other cyanobacterial strains used in this work (Anabaena sp. PCC 7120, Nostoc sp. PCC 7107,Nostoc sp. PCC 7413, Calothrix sp. PCC 7601,Fischerella muscicola UTEX 1829, Pseudanabaenasp. PCC 6903, and Synechococcus sp. PCC 7942) were grown in BG11 medium. Cultures used for RNA isolation and for some of the uptake assays shown in Fig. 1, as indicated, were grown in BG11C (BG11 supplemented with 0.84 g·l−1 NaHCO3) or BG110C medium supplemented with 15 mmNH4Cl and 30 mm TES-NaOH buffer (pH 7.5) bubbled with a mixture of CO2 (1.5% v/v) and air. To achieve nitrogen starvation of cultures, nitrate-grown cells (ammonium-grown cells in the experiment shown in Fig. 7) were harvested at room temperature, washed with and resuspended in BG110medium (or BG110C medium, in the case of cultures used for RNA isolation), and incubated for 6 h under culture conditions. Cyanobacterial cell mass was estimated by measuring the concentration of Chl of the cultures. Chl was determined in methanolic extracts (35Mackinney G. J. Biol. Chem. 1941; 140: 315-322Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar).Figure 7Time course of expression of the amt1gene in response to nitrogen starvation in Synechocystissp. PCC 6803. Total RNA, isolated from cells grown with ammonium (NH4+) or grown with ammonium and incubated for the indicated times in the absence of any nitrogen source, was hybridized with a PCR-generated probe of amt1. Sizes in kilobases of some size markers are indicated on the left.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) E. coli strains DH5α, GM48, and BL21 were grown in LB medium with, when necessary, 50 μg of Ap·ml−1, 50 μg of Km·ml−1, or 25 μg of Cm·ml−1. Wild-type or mutantSynechocystis cells grown in nitrate- or ammonium-containing medium or incubated in the absence of any nitrogen source for 6 h were harvested by low speed centrifugation at room temperature, washed with 20 mm KH2PO4, 10 mm NaHCO3-NaOH buffer (pH 7.1) and resuspended in the same buffer. After a preincubation at 30 °C in the light (100 watt·m−2, white light) for 5 to 30 min, the assays were started by mixing the suspension of cells (4 to 15 μg of Chl·ml−1) with a solution of [14C]CH3NH2·HCl (50 μCi·μmol−1; ICN Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) in phosphate-bicarbonate buffer. After incubation for the time periods indicated in each experiment, 0.1- to 1-ml samples were filtered (0.45-μm pore size Millipore HA filters were used) and washed with 2 to 5 ml of phosphate-bicarbonate buffer. The filters carrying the cells were then immersed in scintillation mixture, and their radioactivity was measured. Retention of radioactivity by boiled cells was used as a blank. In some experiments, as indicated, 1 mml-methionine-d,l-sulfoximine was added to the cell suspension 25 min before the assay was started. Filters containing cells that had been used in uptake assays as described above were immediately immersed in 2 or 3 ml of boiling water and incubated at 100 °C for 5 min. The filters were removed, and the resulting suspensions were centrifuged. Samples from the supernatants were lyophilized and dissolved in a small volume of water. Metabolites present in these samples were resolved by thin layer chromatography using 0.1-mm cellulose plates (20 by 20 cm; Merck). The solvent used was isopropanol/formic acid/water (40:2:10, v/v) (26Boussiba S. Dilling W. Gibson J. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 160: 204-210Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting radioactive areas were quantified in an InstantImager scanner for β particles (Packard). To calculate the intracellular concentration of [14C]methylammonium, an intracellular volume of 125 μl·mg−1 Chl was assumed (36Ihlenfeldt M.J.A. Gibson J. Arch. Microbiol. 1975; 102: 13-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 37Raboy B. Padan E. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 3287-3291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Isolation of genomic DNA from cyanobacteria was carried out as described previously (38Cai Y. Wolk C.P. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 3138-3145Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar), except for strain UTEX 1829 cells, which were frozen with liquid air and broken by grinding with glass beads in a mortar. Isolation of total RNA from Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 was made as described previously (39Garcı́a-Domı́nguez M. Florencio F.J. Plant Mol.

Maniatis T Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). DNA fragments corresponding to strain PCC 6803 ORFs sll0108, sll1017, and sll0537 (33Kaneko T. Sato S. Kotani H. Tanaka A. Asamizu E. Nakamura Y. Miyajima N. Hirosawa M. Sugiura M. Sasamoto S.

DNA Res. 1996; 3: 109-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2133) Google Scholar) were amplified by PCR as described previously (41Montesinos M.L. Herrero A. Flores E. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 853-862Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The primers used (see Fig. 4 below) were: Tr18, 5′-GCCCATTTCCAGAAGGATTGCCCG-3′; Tr19, 5′-GGAATCAGTTTCCTTAACAAAGCC-3′; Tr2a, 5′-GGGAGTTGATTTAGTATAGGCGATG-3′; Tr2b, 5′-TTACTAACGGTGTCCA ACCGGCG-3′; Tr3a, 5′-GTTTTCTGCCTACTTATTGGTGGCG-3′; and Tr3b, 5′-CTACGGTGGTGCCGGGCTTCAAAGG-3′. PCR products were cloned in pGEM-T vector (Promega). Plasmids containing PCR products generated with primers Tr18-Tr19, Tr2a-Tr2b, and Tr3a-Tr3b were named pCSX23, pCSX53, and pCSX52, respectively. Plasmid pCSX23 was digested with ApaI and PstI to isolate the insert that was then cloned between the ApaI and PstI sites of pBluescript SK(+), generating plasmid pCSX46. The 1.1-kb Kmr gene-cassette C.K3 (34Elhai J. Wolk C.P. Gene. 1988; 68: 119-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar) excised withSmaI was inserted into a unique HincII site that is present in the strain PCC 6803-derived insert of pCSX46 to generate plasmids pCSX47a and pCSX47b (both orientations). The 1.9-kb Cmr gene-cassette C.C1 (34Elhai J. Wolk C.P. Gene. 1988; 68: 119-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar) digested with HincII was inserted into the unique MscI site of pCSX53 and into the unique MscI site of pCSX52 (these MscI sites are present in the strain PCC 6803-derived inserts of the plasmids), rendering plasmids pCSX57 and pCSX56, respectively. The orientation of C.C1 in the inserts of pCSX56 and pCSX57 was not determined. Sequences of the inserts of pCSX23, pCSX53, and pCSX52 were verified by using aT7Sequencing kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and [α-35S]thio-dATP. Transformation of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 with pCSX47a, pCSX47b, pCSX56, or pCSX57 as well as transformation of insertional mutant strain CSX47a with pCSX56 or pCSX57 was carried out as described previously (41Montesinos M.L. Herrero A. Flores E. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 853-862Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transformants were selected in BG11 solid medium supplemented with 30 μg of Km·ml−1 or 10 μg of Cm·ml−1. Kmr and Cmrtransformants were then grown in medium supplemented with 50 μg of Km·ml−1 or 20–80 μg of Cm·ml−1. To test whether the resulting mutant strains were homozygous for the mutant chromosomes, PCR amplification with genomic DNA from the mutants as templates and the corresponding primers was carried out; additional testing was made by hybridization. Southern analysis was carried out as described previously (41Montesinos M.L. Herrero A. Flores E. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 853-862Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using GeneScreen Plus membranes (DuPont). For Northern blots, 10 to 15 μg of RNA were loaded/lane and electrophoresed in 1% agarose denaturating formaldehyde gels. Transfer to nylon membranes (Hybond N-plus, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; GeneScreen Plus, NEN Life Science Products), prehybridization, and washes were carried out following the manufacturer's recommendations; hybridization was performed at 42 °C in the presence of 50% formamide, 5× SSPE (1× SSPE is 0.18m NaCl, 10 mm sodium phosphate, and 1 mm EDTA (pH 7.4)), 5× Denhardt's solution (40Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), 0.1% SDS, and 50 μg of herring sperm DNA·ml−1. Filters were washed twice at room temperature with 2× SSPE and 0.1% SDS for 10 min and once with 1× SSPE and 0.1% SDS at 65 °C for 15 min. Total cpm of radioactive areas in Northern blot hybridizations were determined with an InstantImager scanner. DNA probes used in the hybridizations were obtained by PCR using pCSX23, pCSX53, and pCSX52 as templates and the corresponding oligonucleotides as primers.

Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 477-486Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), 15 μg of RNA from strain PCC 6803 was partially hydrolyzed by incubation in 125 mm NaOH for 30 min at 0 to 4 °C and labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase (Boehringer Mannheim) and [γ-32P]dATP (43Apte S.K. Haselkorn R. Plant Mol. Biol. 1990; 15: 723-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Hybridization was performed at 65 °C in a solution containing: 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, 0.2% Ficoll, 0.1% sodium pyrophosphate, 1% SDS, 1 m NaCl, and 100 μg·ml−1 yeast tRNA (Boehringer) (44Fellay R. Perret X. Viprey V. Broughton W.J. Brenner S. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 657-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Filters were washed twice at 65 °C for 30 min with 1× SSC and 1% SDS and once at room temperature for 15 min with SSC 0.2× (1× SSC is 0.15m NaCl and 15 mm sodium citrate (pH 7.0)). Radioactivity of bands in filters was quantified with an InstantImager scanner. A 525-bp fragment putatively containing the promoter region of ORF sll0108 was amplified using primers Am1 (5′-GGGAGCCACTAAAGTTCACAGG-3′; corresponds to positions −236 to −215 with respect to the translational start of ORFsll0108) and Am2 (5′-CGGCTATCAAAATCCAGATGGC-3′; complementary to nucleotides +289 to +268 with respect to the translational start of ORF sll0108). The PCR product was cloned in pGEM-T vector, rendering plasmid pCSX49. This plasmid was used to generate dideoxy-sequencing ladders for primer extension analysis. Oligonucleotides used for primer extension were Am2 (see above) and Am3 (5′-GGAACACAGGCCAACCAGGGAG-3′; complementary to nucleotides +146 to +125 with respect to the translational start of ORFsll0108). Oligonucleotides were end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase (Boehringer Mannheim) and [γ-32P]dATP as described (45Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing and Wiley Interscience, New York1998: 4.8.1-4.8.5Google Scholar) and annealed with 50 μg of total RNA from Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 in the presence of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 150 mmKCl and 1 mm EDTA. Annealing mixtures were incubated first at 85 °C for 10 min for denaturation of RNA and then at 50 °C for 3 h for annealing. The extension reactions were carried out at 47 °C for 1 h in a final volume of 45 μl containing the whole annealing reaction, 0.15 μg·μl−1 actinomycin D, 0.75 mm each deoxynucleoside triphosphate, 0.15 units·μl−1 avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Boehringer Mannheim), and buffer (Boehringer Mannheim). Reaction mixtures were then treated with RNase A (DNase-free, Boehringer Mannheim) and extracted with phenol, and the DNA was precipitated with sodium acetate and ethanol and resuspended in formamide loading dye. These preparations were loaded onto 6% polyacrylamide sequencing gels next to the corresponding dideoxy-sequencing ladders. A 382-bp fragment putatively containing the promoter region of ORF sll0108 was amplified by PCR using pCSX49 as template and primers Am1 and Am3 (see above and Fig. 8 A). This fragment was digested with BstXI, and the resulting 138- and 244-bp fragments were isolated and used in nonradioactive band-shift assays. Binding assays were carried out in a final volume of 20 μl containing 6 mm HEPES-NaOH buffer (pH 8.0), 7 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 42.5 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.375 mm MgCl2, 0.0025% gelatin, 0.001% Tween 20, 0.05 μg·μl−1 bovine serum albumin, 8% glycerol, 75–100 ng of the DNA fragment to be tested, 75 ng of a control DNA fragment, and 5 μl of a diluted E. coli BL21 extract in which the NtcA protein from Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 had been overproduced from the isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside-inducible promoter of vector pQE9 (Quiagen, Inc). 3A. M. Muro-Pastor, A. Herrero, and E. Flores, unpublished data. Extract of E. coli BL21 was prepared according to the manufacturer's recommendations, and 1:100 and 1:200 dilutions of an extract containing 56.8 μg·μl−1 total protein were used in the experiments. The DNA fragment used as nonrelated, control DNA was a 223-bp fragment of pBluescript SK(+) obtained by PCR amplification using the Universal M13 –20 and Reverse primers. Assay mixtures were incubated at room temperature for 30 min, loaded in a nondenaturing 6% polyacrylamide gel, and electrophoresed at 200 V. Gels were stained with ethidium bromide for visualization of DNA bands. Glutamine synthetase activity was measured by using the γ-glutamyltransferase assay as described previously (46Shapiro B.M. Stadtman E.R. Methods Enzymol. 1970; 17: 910-922Crossref Scopus (504) Google Scholar). One activity unit corresponds to one μmol of γ-glutamylhydroxamate produced/min. The cellular activity level of uptake of [14C]methylammonium in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 was higher in cells starved for nitrogen than in nonstarved cells (grown with either nitrate or ammonium). Additionally, growth in CO2-enriched air allowed higher [14C]methylammonium uptake activities (Fig. 1). Determination of the rate of [14C]methylammonium uptake in 1-min assays using a range of substrate concentrations from 1 to 75 μm showed one kinetic component with the following parameters: K s, 2.7 μm; V max, 169 nmol·min−1.(mg of Chl)−1. Methylammonium does not serve as a nitrogen source in strain PCC 6803 (not shown), and as is the case in some other cyanobacteria (26Boussiba S. Dilling W. Gibson J. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 160: 204-210Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Rai A.N. Rowell P. Stewart W.D.P. Arch. Microbiol. 1984; 137: 241-246Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar), intracellular radioactivity derived from [14C]methylammonium was distributed into two metabolites (Fig. 2). One of these metabolites was identified as methylammonium itself by co-chromatography with authentic [14C]methylammonium. Production of the second metabolite was hampered (96.4 and 97.5% inhibition in two independent experiments, respectively) by"

Copper homeostasis is important because copper is required in trace amounts for the normal functioning of many biological processes but is toxic in excess due to its redox properties (1Danks D.M.

In Menkes' disease, which is a copper deficiency disorder, many of the biochemical and clinical symptoms are attributable to reduced levels of critical copper-requiring enzymes. The clinical features of Wilson's disease stem from an accumulation of hepatic copper to toxic levels (1Danks D.M. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.M. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Basis of Inherited Disease. 7th Ed. 1. McGraw-Hill, New York1995: 2211-2235Google Scholar). Both MNK and WND belong to the family of cation-transporting P-type ATPase proteins and function to transport copper across cellular membranes. MNK is expressed in most tissues except the liver (3Chelly J. Tümer Z. Tønnesen T. Petterson A. Ishikawa-Brush Y. Tommerup N. Horn N. Monaco A.P. Nat. Genet. 1993; 3: 14-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar, 5Vulpe C. Levinson B. Whitney S. Packman S. Gitschier J. Nat. Genet. 1993; 3: 7-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (1227) Google Scholar), whereas WND is expressed predominantly in the liver and at lower levels in a number of other tissues (6Tanzi R.E. Petrukhin K. Chernov I. Pellequer J.L. Wasco W. Ross B. Romano D.M. Parano E. Pavone L. Brzustowicz L.M. Devoto M. Peppercorn J. Bush A.I. Sternlieb I. Pirastu M. Gusella J.F. Evgrafov O. Penchaszadeh G.K.

Genet. 1995; 33: 233-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), at the level of the whole organism these two proteins appear to have distinct roles in copper transport and homeostasis (10Kuo Y.-M. Gitschier J. Packman S. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 1043-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). A wide range of mutations within the ATP7A and ATP7B genes have been described in patients with Menkes' (11Das S. Levinson B. Whitney S. Vulpe C. Packman S. Gitschier J. Am. J. Hum.

Genet. 1995; 9: 210-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar), respectively. In addition, patients with these disorders exhibit a diversity of phenotypes with respect to disease severity (13Tümer Z. Horn N. J. Med. Genet. 1997; 34: 265-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 15DiDonato M. Sarkar B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1360: 3-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), and there is currently no useful genotype/phenotype correlation. There is also no formal evidence that mutations in these genes are solely responsible for the copper transport defect and the diverse phenotypes of Menkes' and Wilson's disease patients. A diagnostic feature of Menkes' disease is that cultured cells from patients hyperaccumulate copper (16Horn N. Lancet. 1976; 1: 1156-1158Abstract PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 17Goka T.J.

Cotton R.G.H. Biochem. Genet. 1980; 18: 117-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and show increased retention of 64Cu, which provides evidence for defective copper efflux (13Tümer Z. Horn N. J. Med. Genet. 1997; 34: 265-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 19Camakaris J. Danks D.M. Phillips M. Herd S. Mann J.R. Sorensen J.R.J. Inflammatory Diseases and Copper. Humana Press, Clifton, NJ1982: 85-96Crossref Google Scholar). To determine whether the proteins expressed from the MNK and WND cDNAs could correct the abnormal copper metabolism of such cells, a human skin fibroblast cell strain, Me32a, from a patient with classical Menkes' disease was immortalized. Transfection of the cDNAs encoding the MNK and WND proteins into these cells led to restoration of copper efflux by these cells. However, although both proteins were localized to a perinuclear region that was consistent with the TGN1 in basal copper levels, their intracellular location differed in the presence of elevated copper levels. This report represents the first demonstration of the correction of the copper accumulation and retention phenotype of cultured fibroblasts from a Menkes patient by the Menkes protein, as well as by the closely related Wilson protein. Cells were maintained in basal medium (1.5 μm copper), which consisted of Eagle's basal medium (BME, Trace Biosciences) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS, Trace Biosciences),l-proline at a final concentration of 20 mm,and 0.2% (w/v) bicarbonate. The Me32a primary cell strain was derived from a skin biopsy that was taken from a patient with classical Menkes' disease and showed a copper accumulation phenotype typical of this disease. 2J. Camakaris, unpublished results. Immortalization of this cell line by SV40 gene transfer was carried out as described previously (20DeSilva R. Zahra D.G. Duncan E.L. Reddel R.R. Methods Cell Sci. 1995; 17: 75-81Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar) except that the plasmid pRSV-T22 3P. Bonnefin, A. Englezou, and R. R. Reddel, unpublished results. was used, which contains a single nucleotide substitution in codon 203 (His → Gln) that renders the large T antigen replication incompetent. The resulting cell line was designated Me32a-T22/2L, and DNA fingerprinting analysis confirmed that this line was derived from the original parental cell strain. The SV40-immortalized normal human fibroblasts GM639, GM847, and GM2069 SV9 (Coriell Institute, Camden, NJ) were employed as controls. The immortalized cell line, Me32a-T22/2L, was transfected with either the expression vector (pCMB77) alone or with pCMB117 or pCMB98, both of which carry the human MNK (21La Fontaine S. Firth S.D. Lockhart P.J. Brooks H. Parton R.G. Camakaris J. Mercer J.F.B. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 1293-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and mouse WND 4M. B. Theophilos and J. F. B.

Liposome-mediated transfection was carried out using Superfect reagent (Qiagen) and recommended protocols, followed by selection in G418 (Life Technologies Inc.) for 2 weeks. Screening of G418-resistant transfectants for those that expressed the MNK or WND proteins was carried out by indirect immunofluorescence. Total RNA was prepared from the Me32a fibroblast cell strain as described previously (23Paynter J.A. Camakaris J. Mercer J.F.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 190: 149-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Five overlapping cDNA fragments spanning the 4.5-kb MNK coding region were generated by RT-PCR using Reverse Transcriptase AMV (Boehringer Mannheim) and recommended protocols. The primers employed for RT-PCR and subsequent nucleotide sequence analysis of the resultant RT-PCR products were designed from the previously published sequence of the MNK cDNA (4Mercer J.F.B. Livingston J. Hall B.K. Paynter J.A. Begy C. Chandrasekharappa S. Lockhart P. Grimes A. Bhave M. Siemenack D. Glover T.W. Nat.

DNA sequencing was carried out using the Thermo Sequenase kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). All other DNA manipulations were carried out using standard techniques (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Western blot analysis was carried out as described previously (25La Fontaine S. Firth S.D. Lockhart P.J. Paynter J.A. Mercer J.F.B. Plasmid. 1998; 39: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The primary antibody consisted of sodium sulfate precipitated preparations of anti-MNK (21La Fontaine S. Firth S.D. Lockhart P.J. Brooks H. Parton R.G. Camakaris J. Mercer J.F.B. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 1293-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) or anti-WND4 antibodies directed against the N termini of the human MNK and mouse WND proteins, respectively. Immunofluorescence analysis of cells was carried out essentially as described previously (21La Fontaine S. Firth S.D. Lockhart P.J. Brooks H. Parton R.G. Camakaris J. Mercer J.F.B. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 1293-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 26Petris M.J. Mercer J.F.B. Culvenor J.G. Lockhart P. Gleeson P.A. Camakaris J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6084-6095Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). In general, for screening of G418-resistant clones, cells were cultured and stained in 96-well microtitre plates. Otherwise, cells were cultured on 13-mm glass coverslips for 48 h. Where appropriate, CuCl2 was added to the growth medium to a final concentration of 189 μm for 2–3 h, unless otherwise specified. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 10 min, permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min, and quenched with 0.1 methanolamine. Nonspecific binding was blocked by incubation in 1% gelatin in PBS overnight, followed by incubation with the primary and secondary antibodies. The primary antibodies were the same as those employed for Western blot analysis. Cells were cultured in basal medium and then transferred to BME supplemented with 2% FCS and trace amounts of 64Cu (as CuCl2; Australian Radioisotopes, Lucas Heights, NSW, Australia). The total copper concentration was 0.5 μm. For accumulation studies, cells were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C, washed twice in cold BME, and harvested by dissolution in 0.1% SDS. For retention experiments, cells were treated in the same way except that after the BME washes they were incubated at 37 °C for a further 24-h period in BME containing 2% FCS but lacking64Cu. The cells then were washed twice in cold BME and harvested in 0.1% SDS. Following accumulation and retention experiments, the amount of 64Cu in the cell lysates was estimated using an LKB-Wallac Ultragamma counter. The amount of protein in the cell extracts was estimated using a previously described protein assay (27Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). MNK protein was not detectable in Me32a cells. 5L. Ambrosini and J. F. B. Mercer, unpublished results. MNK mRNA levels in these cells were too low to be detected by Northern blot analysis (4Mercer J.F.B. Livingston J. Hall B.K. Paynter J.A. Begy C. Chandrasekharappa S. Lockhart P. Grimes A. Bhave M. Siemenack D. Glover T.W. Nat. Genet. 1993; 3: 20-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar) but could be detected by RT-PCR. Therefore, RT-PCR was used to amplify the cDNA comprising the MNK coding region as five overlapping fragments. The nucleotide sequence of all but approximately 1 kb of the coding region was determined. A mutation was identified within the MNK cDNA sequence derived from the Me32a cells and comprised a deletion of four base pairs within exon 6. This exon encodes the region of the MNK protein between metal binding sites five and six. The mutation leads to the incorporation of a premature termination codon, 36 base pairs downstream from the four base deletion and would lead to the production of a truncated MNK protein, consistent with the failure to detect the MNK protein by Western blot analysis of Me32a cells. The Me32a cell strain was immortalized by SV40 gene transfer and then designated Me32a-T22/2L. The 4.6-kb cDNAs encoding either human MNK (21La Fontaine S. Firth S.D. Lockhart P.J. Brooks H.

Plasmid. 1998; 39: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) or mouse WND4 proteins were cloned into a mammalian expression vector, pCMB77, which was derived by modifying the vector pCMB43 (25La Fontaine S. Firth S.D. Lockhart P.J. Paynter J.A. Mercer J.F.B. Plasmid. 1998; 39: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) to include an internal ribosome entry site. 6M. J. Petris, unpublished results. The resultant plasmids, pCMB117 (encoding MNK) and pCMB98 (encoding WND), were linearized and transfected into Me32a-T22/2L. Following G418 selection, clones that expressed the proteins were identified by immunofluorescence analysis. Two independently derived clones that expressed MNK (A12-H9 and C3-C1) and two that expressed WND (WND-2 and WND-16) were chosen for further analysis. To determine the MNK and WND protein expression levels in the clones, Western blot analysis was carried out using anti-MNK (21La Fontaine S. Firth S.D. Lockhart P.J. Brooks H. Parton R.G. Camakaris J. Mercer J.F.B. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 1293-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) or anti-WND4 antibodies, respectively, that were directed against the N-terminal region of the proteins. Clones A12-H9 and C3-C1 produced a protein band of the expected size (approximately 178 kDa), which was comparable in size with that produced by the normal human control fibroblasts (Fig. 1 A). This MNK product was not detected in the untransfected Me32a-T22/2L parental cell line or in this cell line transfected with the vector alone, Me32a-T22/2L (pCMB77). The lower molecular mass bands most likely represented degradation products because they were not consistently observed. In clones WND-2 and WND-16 and in the mouse liver sample, the anti-WND antibodies detected a band of approximately 165 kDa (Fig. 1 B), which is the expected size of the WND protein (28Hung I.H. Suzuki M. Yamaguchi Y. Yuan D.S. Klausner R.D. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21461-21466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). This band was not detected in the parental cell line, Me32a-T22/2L (pCMB77), or in the control fibroblasts. Note that the anti-WND antibodies were specific for mouse WND and would not cross-react with any endogenously expressed human WND in these cells. However, human WND mRNA could not be detected in the control fibroblasts by Northern blot analysis using a human WND cDNA probe (data not shown). To determine whether the expressed proteins could correct the copper transport abnormality of the Menkes fibroblasts, copper transport studies were carried out. Following a 24-h period in medium containing trace amounts of 64Cu, the parental Me32a-T22/2L and Me32a-T22/2L (pCMB77) cell lines accumulated approximately 2-fold more copper than the control fibroblasts GM847 and GM2069 SV9 (Table I). The MNK-expressing clones showed a decreased accumulation of copper to levels that were significantly lower than those of both the Menkes and the control cell lines. Copper accumulation by the WND-expressing clone, WND-16, was reduced compared with the Menkes fibroblasts but was comparable with the control fibroblasts (Table I). After a further 24 h in medium without64Cu, the amount of 64Cu that was retained within the cells was measured as an indirect measure of copper efflux. The results showed that the MNK and WND clones and the control fibroblasts retained substantially less copper than the Me32a-T22/2L and Me32a-T22/2L (pCMB77) cell lines (Table I).Table ICopper accumulation and retention by MNK- and WND-expressing clonesCell LineCopper accumulation1-aValues for accumulation represent the amount of copper accumulated in cells after 24 h in 64Cu-containing medium, expressed as the means ± S.E. of four independent measurements.

Open table in a new tab Immunofluorescence analysis was used to assess the intracellular distribution of the MNK and WND proteins in the Menkes fibroblasts, both in basal medium and in medium with elevated copper levels (189 μm). In the MNK-expressing clones, the MNK protein was located in the perinuclear region (Fig. 2), similar to the endogenously expressed MNK in the control fibroblast line, GM847 (Fig. 2). This result was consistent with a TGN location as previously reported for MNK (21La Fontaine S. Firth S.D. Lockhart P.J. Brooks H. Parton R.G. Camakaris J. Mercer J.F.B. Hum. Mol.

In the presence of elevated extracellular copper, MNK in both the normal control (GM847) and in the transfected fibroblasts was redistributed to the cytoplasm and plasma membrane (Fig. 2), again consistent with previous studies of MNK in CHO cells (21La Fontaine S.

In the WND-expressing clones, WND also was located in the perinuclear region consistent with previous studies indicating a TGN location for WND (28Hung I.H. Suzuki M. Yamaguchi Y. Yuan D.S.

However, in contrast to MNK, WND did not relocalize with elevated copper levels but remained predominantly within the perinuclear region (Fig. 3), even after prolonged (24 h) incubation in elevated copper levels. This result was not likely to be due to an abnormality of the cDNA-derived WND protein because WND expressed from the same expression plasmid in CHO cells was redistributed to a cytoplasmic compartment with elevated copper conditions4 as previously observed with endogenously expressed WND in HepG2 cells (28Hung I.H.

Consistent with the Western blot data, the antibodies did not detect any WND protein in the normal control fibroblasts (GM847) or in the parental Menkes fibroblasts. A definitive biochemical diagnosis for Menkes' disease is based on increased accumulation and retention of copper in cultured cells from Menkes patients, which are indirect indicators of defective copper efflux (13Tümer Z. Horn N. J. Med. Genet. 1997; 34: 265-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 16Horn N. Lancet. 1976; 1: 1156-1158Abstract PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 17Goka T.J. Stevenson R.E.

The cell strain Me32a was obtained from a patient with classical Menkes' disease and showed a copper accumulation and retention phenotype that was typical of the disease. In this study the cDNA-derived MNK protein was able to restore copper transport activity by this cell line. This report represents the first demonstration that the expression of this protein alone was able to correct the copper accumulation and retention defect of Menkes fibroblasts. WND did not appear to be endogenously expressed in fibroblasts, but the expression of this protein from a cDNA construct also led to correction of the copper transport defect of these cells, although there were differences in the kinetics of copper transport compared with MNK. There was an obvious difference between the parental Menkes fibroblasts and the MNK- and WND-expressing clones in the amount of copper that had accumulated over 24 h and in the amount that was subsequently retained during the 24-h chase period. For the MNK clones, the reduction in copper accumulation to levels below normal may have been due to the expression of the cDNA-derived MNK above the normal level, as indicated by immunofluorescence (Fig. 2). Increased expression of MNK was shown to result in enhanced copper efflux (32Camakaris J. Petris M.J. Bailey L. Shen P. Lockhart P. Glover T.W. Barcroft C.L. Patton J. Mercer J.F.B. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1995; 4: 2117-2123Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The difference in the copper accumulation phenotype between the MNK and WND clones may relate to a greater efficiency of copper efflux by MNK, which would result in a significantly reduced pool of copper in the MNK clones by the end of the accumulation period. The apparently lower retention of copper by WND-16, compared with the MNK clones, then may be explained by a higher proportion of copper in these cells that was available for efflux during the 24-h efflux period. The copper accumulation and retention properties of the transfected clones were consistent with preliminary experiments that assessed the copper resistance of these clones. When cells were exposed to a medium copper concentration of 125 μm for 48 h, cell viability of the untransfected and vector-transfected Menkes fibroblasts was 3–4-fold lower than that of the normal control fibroblasts and the Menkes fibroblasts that expressed MNK and WND (data not shown). The current evidence suggests that in basal copper levels, MNK is located in the TGN (26Petris M.J. Mercer J.F.B. Culvenor J.G. Lockhart P. Gleeson P.A. Camakaris J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6084-6095Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar, 29Dierick H.A. Adam A.N. Escara-Wilke J.F. Glover T.W. Hum. Mol.

A. 1997; 93: 14030-14035Crossref Scopus (195) Google Scholar), where presumably it transports copper into the TGN lumen for incorporation into lysyl oxidase and other secreted cuproenzymes. Recent studies with MNK-overexpressing CHO cells also suggested that MNK constitutively recycles between the TGN and the plasma membrane from where copper is effluxed from the cell (26Petris M.J. Mercer J.F.B. Culvenor J.G. Lockhart P. Gleeson P.A. Camakaris J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6084-6095Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). However, with increased intra- and extracellular copper levels, the steady state distribution of MNK shifts toward the plasma membrane, presumably to increase the efficiency of removal of the excess copper from the cell (26Petris M.J. Mercer J.F.B. Culvenor J.G. Lockhart P. Gleeson P.A. Camakaris J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6084-6095Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). The association of cDNA-derived MNK with vesicles within the cell and with the TGN and plasma membrane was confirmed at an ultrastructural level in CHO cells (21La Fontaine S. Firth S.D. Lockhart P.J. Brooks H. Parton R.G. Camakaris J. Mercer J.F.B. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 1293-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 26Petris M.J. Mercer J.F.B. Culvenor J.G. Lockhart P. Gleeson P.A. Camakaris J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6084-6095Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). Using the same MNK cDNA construct, the results obtained in this study demonstrating MNK location and its response to elevated extracellular copper levels in Menkes fibroblasts were consistent with previous data obtained with CHO cells. The greater efficiency of copper efflux resulting from MNK expression compared with efflux resulting from WND expression in the same cell type may relate to the ability of MNK to recycle between the TGN and plasma membrane in basal medium, as demonstrated in CHO cells (26Petris M.J. Mercer J.F.B. Culvenor J.G. Lockhart P. Gleeson P.A. Camakaris J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6084-6095Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). This study showed that, albeit in elevated copper conditions, MNK in the Menkes fibroblasts was able to localize to the plasma membrane, which suggested that it retained similar properties in CHO cells and in fibroblasts. Therefore, based on the copper transport studies and intracellular distribution in the absence and presence of elevated copper, we concluded that the cDNA-expressed Menkes protein was fully functional in the Menkes fibroblasts, and alone could correct the copper efflux defect of these cells. The WND protein also restored copper efflux by the Menkes cells but did not display the copper-induced redistribution pattern exhibited by MNK. Despite an apparent lack of endogenously expressed WND in fibroblasts, the cDNA-expressed WND protein had a perinuclear location that was consistent with localization to the TGN, as previously demonstrated in human hepatoma cells (28Hung I.H.

The presence of WND at the TGN is consistent with a role for this protein in the delivery of copper to ceruloplasmin (34Terada K. Nakako T. Yang X.-L. Iida M. Aiba N. Minamiya Y. Nakai M. Sakaki T.

A smaller 140-kDa form of WND has been localized to a cytosolic compartment (31Yang X.-L. Miura N. Kawarada Y. Terada K. Petrukhin K. Gilliam T.C. Sugiyama T. Biochem.

A. 1998; 95: 6004-6009Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), and was consistent with WND-specific cytosolic staining in HepG2 cells noted by Hung et al. (28Hung I.H. Suzuki M. Yamaguchi Y. Yuan D.S. Klausner R.D. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21461-21466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). This finding suggested an unexpected role for WND in the delivery of copper to proteins involved in energy-generating processes within the cell (33Lutsenko S. Cooper M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6004-6009Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In the present study only the TGN-localized 165-kDa form of WND was identified. There have been conflicting reports on the effect of copper on the intracellular distribution of WND in HepG2 cells, with one study reporting an absence of copper-induced redistribution of WND (31Yang X.-L. Miura N. Kawarada Y. Terada K. Petrukhin K. Gilliam T.C. Sugiyama T. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 897-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), whereas a different group reported copper-induced movement of WND to a cytoplasmic vesicular compartment but not to the plasma membrane as observed with MNK (28Hung I.H. Suzuki M. Yamaguchi Y. Yuan D.S. Klausner R.D. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21461-21466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). However, copper ATPase activity has been detected in the plasma membrane fraction of rat hepatocytes (37Dijkstra M. Veld G.I.T. Berg G.J.V.D. Muller M. Kuipers F. Vonk R.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 412-416Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the presence of WND at the plasma membrane of LEC rat hepatocytes was reported following in vivo experiments that involved direct injection of a WND expression plasmid into LEC rat livers (35Nagano K. Nakamura K. Urakami K.-I. Umeyama K. Uchiyama H. Koiwai K. Hattori S. Yamamoto T. Matsuda I. Endo F. Hepatology. 1998; 27: 799-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). These results are consistent with a role for WND in the secretion of copper into bile and therefore with its presence at the biliary cannalicular membrane, which is a polarized surface. Therefore, it is likely that the inability to detect WND at the plasma membrane of HepG2 cells may be due to the lack of polarization of these cells in culture. In this study, the fact that WND may not be normally expressed in fibroblasts and/or the lack of polarization of these cells may account for the observed failure of copper to induce the relocalization of WND to the plasma membrane in the Menkes fibroblasts. However, because the WND-expressing fibroblasts demonstrated an enhanced capacity for copper efflux, it is possible that a low basal level of WND recycling between the TGN and either the plasma membrane or another cellular compartment may have been occurring, which was sufficient to reduce the copper accumulation and restore copper efflux by these cells but was not sufficient to enable detection by immunofluoresence. Alternatively, copper may be transported by WND into the TGN lumen and eliminated from the cell in a protein-bound form via the secretory pathway. If WND is not normally expressed in fibroblasts, then the apparent failure of WND to respond to elevated copper may be due to a lack of either the appropriate trafficking components that are required to specifically interact with WND or intracellular targets for WND-containing vesicles. The Menkes and Wilson proteins have similar structures and perform similar functions, although in different cell types. The data presented in this study were consistent with a common ability of both MNK and WND to translocate copper across cellular membranes and represents the first report of the expression and function of these two proteins in the same cell type. Under these conditions, WND activity could at least partially substitute for MNK function, although the pathway for elimination of copper from the cell may differ for the two proteins. Although the relocalization studies were carried out using copper concentrations that were significantly higher than those employed for the copper accumulation and retention studies, the difference in MNK and WND distribution in elevated copper may reflect differences in the way that the two proteins transport copper within the cell.

We identified a cDNA encoding p22 HBP, and sequence analysis revealed that p22 HBP comprises 190 amino acid residues (M r 21,063) and has no homology to any other known heme-binding protein. The p22 HBP mRNA (∼1.0 kilobases) is ubiquitously expressed in various tissues and is extremely abundant in the liver. cDNA allows for expression of active p22 HBP, with a high affinity for 55Fe-hemin, with aK d of 26 ±1.8 nm. TheB max of hemin binding to p22 HBP was 0.55 ± 0.021 mol/mol of protein, a value consistent with one heme molecule binding per molecule of protein. The order of potency of different ligands to compete against 55Fe-hemin binding to p22 HBP was hemin = protoporphyrin IX > coproporphyrin III > bilirubin > palmitic acid > all-trans-retinoic acid. Treatment of mouse erythroleukemia (MEL) cells with dimethyl sulfoxide or hemin resulted in an increase in p22 HBP mRNA. The immunoblot analysis showed that p22 HBP increased with time in dimethyl sulfoxide- and hemin-induced MEL cells. Conversely, transfer of antisense oligonucleotides to p22 HBP cDNA resulted in a decrease of p22 HBP in dimethyl sulfoxide-treated MEL cells, and the heme content in these cells decreased to 66–71% of sense oligonucleotides-transferred cells. Thus, this newly identified heme-binding protein, p22 HBP, may be involved in heme utilization for hemoprotein synthesis and even be coupled to hemoglobin synthesis during erythroid differentiation.

Heme regulates protein syntheses transcriptionally and translationally. The first enzyme of heme biosynthetic pathway, ALAS1 consists of two gene products. The housekeeping-type ALAS (ALAS-1) was down-regulated at levels of transcription and translocation into the mitochondrion by hemin (1Yamamoto M. Kure S. Engel J.D. Hiraga K. J. Biol.

Cells are equipped with a sensing system to monitor changes in size of the uncommitted heme pool. Although such a system has not been identified, identification of uncommitted heme is one approach to elucidate cellular regulation by heme. Conditions of uncommitted heme may be linked to cytosolic heme-binding proteins because heme is not so soluble in aqueous solutions at body pH and tends to form large aggregates at concentrations as low as 10−7m (9Granick S. Beale S.I. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1978; 46: 33-203PubMed Google Scholar). Several heme-binding and heme-transport proteins from the cytosol have been isolated. FABP constituting 3–5% of the total cytosolic proteins has an affinity for heme that is 10-fold higher than that for oleic acid (9Granick S. Beale S.I. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol.

Once the enzyme bound to the blue dye, it was not released from the dye even after washing with solution containing more than 1 m NaCl and nonionic detergents such as Triton X-100 and Nonidet P-40. There are reports that heme-binding proteins (20Hrkal Z. Cabart P. Kalousek I. Biomed. Chromatogr. 1992; 6: 212-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 21Cornego J. Beale S.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11915-11921Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and enzymes of chlorophyll biosynthesis (22Schon A. Krupp G. Gough S. Berry-Lowe S. Kannangara C.G. Soll D. Nature. 1986; 322: 281-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 23Walker C.J. Castelfranco P.A. Whyte B.J. Biochem. J. 1991; 276: 691-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) can bind to blue dye. Although mechanisms involved in such binding to proteins interacted with heme and porphyrins are unclear, it is considered that chromatography on blue Sepharose would be useful for purifying proteins interacting with heme and porphyrins. We purified three major proteins from the cytosol of mouse liver. Although two of them have been reported (24Xu X. Stambrook P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30268-30273Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Mainwaring G.W. Williams S.M. Foster J.R. Tugwood J. Green T. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 297-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), the third was a heretofore unrecognized heme-binding protein with a molecular mass of 22 kDa, termed as p22 HBP. Molecular cloning and functional expression showed that p22 HBP binds heme, protoporphyrin, and coproporphyrin, with relatively high affinities. Induction of the protein in Me2SO- or hemin-treated MEL cells undergoing erythroid differentiation was also noteworthy. [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mol),55FeSO4 (60 mCi/mg) and nylon membranes were obtained from Amersham. 55Fe-hemin was prepared, as described previously and dissolved in Me2SO (26Taketani S. Kohno H. Furukawa T. Tokunaga R. J. Biochem. 1995; 117: 875-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The specific radioactivity of 55Fe-heme was 1.06 × 106 dpm/nmol heme. Restriction endonuclease and other nucleic acid-modifying enzymes were from Toyobo Co. and Takara Shuzo Co. A 5′-RACE cDNA library from mouse liver mRNA was fromCLONTECH. Blue Sepharose CL-6B, EAH-Sepharose CL-6B, and pGEX-4T-1 were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Protoporphyrin IX and coproporphyrin III were from Porphyrin Products Co. Hemin-bound Sepharose were prepared by incubation of hemin with EAH-Sepharose CL-6B by the method of Olsen (27Olsen K.W. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 109: 250-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Amino acid sequencing was carried out using a Hewlett Packard Protein Sequencer G1000A. All other chemicals used were of analytical grade. All procedures for the purification of p22 HBP was done at 4 °C. Solution containing 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 150 mm NaCl was designated as Solution A. Fresh mice livers (20 g) were minced and homogenized in 6 volumes of Solution A with 6 strokes of a Teflon pestle in a glass homogenizer. After crude lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min to remove nuclei and mitochondria, cytosol was separated from the postmitochondrial supernatant by ultracentrifugation at 105,000 ×g for 1 h. Then, to the obtained cytosolic fraction, 10% Triton X-100 solution was added at the final concentration of 1%. The resulting samples (865 mg of protein) were applied to a column of blue Sepharose CL-6B (1.5 × 5.0 cm) that was equilibrated with Solution A containing 1% Triton X-100. The column was washed with 500 ml of Solution A containing 1% Triton X-100 and 1 m NaCl at a flow rate of 30 ml/h. The proteins were eluted with Solution A containing 1% sodium cholate and 1 m NaCl. Fractions containing proteins were collected, concentrated using an Amicon YM-10 membrane, and dialyzed with Solution A for 16 h. Amounts of protein in the final preparation were 0.23 mg. For chromatography on hemin-Sepharose CL-6B, eluates of blue Sepharose were applied to a small column of hemin-Sepharose (1.0 × 2.0 cm) equilibrated with Solution A containing 0.5% Tween 20, after which the column was washed with 100 ml of Solution A containing 1 m NaCl. The proteins were eluted from the column with 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0. Fractions containing proteins were collected and dialyzed against Solution A for 16 h. Protein concentration was determined by the method of Lowry et al. (28Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To identify the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the obtained proteins, the proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad), as described (29Taketani S. Yoshinaga T. Furukawa T. Kohno H. Tokunaga R. Nishimura K. Inokuchi H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 760-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). After staining the proteins, parts of the filter corresponding to molecular masses of 26, 24, and 22 kDa (see Fig. 1) were cut out and directly sequenced. A primer (5′-GT-CTC-CAC-(G/A)CT-(G/A/T/C)CC-(G/A)AA-3′) complementary to amino acid sequence (FGSVET) was prepared, and PCR was carried out using as a template 5′-RACE mouse liver cDNA library. The PCR products were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, purified, and ligated to pGEM-T vector (Promega), and then the insert was examined by DNA sequencing (30Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5436-5467Crossref Scopus (52865) Google Scholar). To isolate full-length cDNA, the MEL cell cDNA library in λgt11 (29Taketani S. Yoshinaga T. Furukawa T. Kohno H. Tokunaga R. Nishimura K. Inokuchi H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 760-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) was screened with the radiolabeled partial fragment of p22 HBP cDNA. Five positive plaques were isolated from 1.5 × 105 plaques, and the longest insert (1.0 kbp) of clone 5 was cut out and subcloned into a pBluescript vector for sequencing. The cDNA corresponding to mouse p22 HBP was subcloned into BamHI-NotI site of an expression vector pGEX-4T-1 in the correct reading frame. p22 HBP was expressed as GST fusion protein in Escherichia coli JM109 and purified on glutathione-Sepharose beads, according to the method of Self and Hall (31Self A.J. Hall A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 258: 3-10Crossref Scopus (167) Google Scholar). To prepare heme-free GST fusion protein, the protein solution, adjusted to pH 5.0 by adding 1 m acetic acid, was passed through DEAE-cellulose (DE52, Whatman Co.) (1.5 × 5.0 cm) equilibrated with 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0. The resulting solution containing the proteins was dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 150 mmNaCl and 0.3% Tween 20 (TBS-T) at 4 °C for 16 h. The amount of bound55Fe-hemin to the purified GST-p22 HBP was determined as follows. The GST (2.5 μg) or GST-p22 HBP (2.5 μg) in TBS-T containing 1 mg/ml rabbit γ-globulin was incubated with 0–300 nm55Fe-hemin at 4 °C for 20 min, after which the sample was mixed with 50 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads. After washing the beads five times with TBS-T, the proteins were eluted with TBS-T containing 20 mm glutathione. To determine the degree of nonspecific binding, parallel experiments were carried out with a 100-fold excess of nonradioactive hemin. The radioactivities in the eluted samples were counted in a Packard liquid scintillation spectrophotometer. The native p22 HBP was also expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) strain as follows. The cDNA for p22 HBP was subcloned intoNdeI-EcoRI site of an expression vector pAR-HF, as described (32Furukawa T. Kohno H. Tokunaga R. Taketani S. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). p22 HBP was purified using blue Sepharose, as described above. For binding of hemin to p22 HBP, the purified p22 HBP (100 μg) in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, was incubated with 20 μm hemin at 4 °C for 20 min. The sample was loaded onto a column of DEAE-cellulose (1.0 × 2.0 cm) equilibrated with 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, the column was washed with 10 ml of the above solution and the protein was eluted with 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 150 mm NaCl. MEL cells (clone 745A) were grown in DMEM supplemented with 7% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. To induce erythroid differentiation, cells at an initial density of 1 × 105/ml were grown for 3 days in medium containing 2% Me2SO or 100 μm hemin. Mouse macrophage RAW 264.7 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, as described (32Furukawa T. Kohno H. Tokunaga R. Taketani S. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). A mouse multiple tissue Northern blot membrane was purchased from CLONTECH Co. Total RNA was isolated from MEL cells and RAW264.7 cells, as described previously (29Taketani S. Yoshinaga T. Furukawa T. Kohno H. Tokunaga R. Nishimura K. Inokuchi H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 760-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). 10 μg of RNA were applied to a 1% agarose-formaldehyde gel, electrophoresed, and transferred onto a nylon membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Hybond N+) for hybridization with DNA probes. The filters were hybridized and washed as described (29Taketani S. Yoshinaga T. Furukawa T. Kohno H. Tokunaga R. Nishimura K. Inokuchi H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 760-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The mRNA concentration was quantified by densitometry using an Advantec DMC-33c densitometer. Antibodies against p22 HBP were prepared by injecting a rabbit with 0.5 mg of the purified GST-p22 HBP fusion protein in Freund's complete adjuvant. After three subsequent injections at 2-week intervals, the resulting antisera were collected and antibodies were purified as described (29Taketani S. Yoshinaga T. Furukawa T. Kohno H. Tokunaga R. Nishimura K. Inokuchi H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 760-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Antibodies for ferrochelatase and MSP23 were prepared, as described (16Ishii T. Kawane T. Taketani S. Bannai S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 216: 970-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 29Taketani S. Yoshinaga T. Furukawa T. Kohno H. Tokunaga R. Nishimura K. Inokuchi H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 760-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). For immunoblotting, cells were lysed with Laemmli's sample buffer (33Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207856) Google Scholar). The lysate was then sonicated and boiled for 1 min. After the proteins had been resolved by SDS-PAGE on 12% gel, the protein in the gel were electroblotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Conditions of immunoblotting and detection of the cross-reacted antigen were as described (29Taketani S. Yoshinaga T. Furukawa T. Kohno H. Tokunaga R. Nishimura K. Inokuchi H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 760-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Phosphorothioate sense (5′-ATGTTGGGCATGATCAGG-3′) oligonucleotides, which were identical to nucleotide positions 58–75 of p22 HBP cDNA, and antisense (5′-CCTGATCATGCCCAACAT-3′) oligonucleotides were synthesized and purified. MEL cells (5 × 105) treated with 2% Me2SO for 16 h were collected and rinsed twice with serum-free DMEM. Phosphorothionate sense or antisense oligonucleotides (5 μm) were transfected into the cells, using a DOTAP Liposomal Transfection Reagent (Boehringer Mannheim GmbH) (34Bertram J. Killian M. Brysch W. Schlingensiepen K.-H. Kneba M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 200: 661-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). After a 6-h transfection, the medium was changed to DMEM containing 7% fetal calf serum, 2% Me2SO, and antibiotics. The cells were further cultured for 24 or 48 h and then collected. The heme content in the cells were estimated as described previously (29Taketani S. Yoshinaga T. Furukawa T. Kohno H. Tokunaga R. Nishimura K. Inokuchi H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 760-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). After blue Sepharose CL-6B chromatography of mouse hepatic cytosolic protein, three major bands, 22, 24, and 26 kDa, appeared on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1). To determine of these proteins would bind to heme, eluates of blue Sepharose were loaded to hemin-bound Sepharose, the column was washed with Solution A containing 1 m NaCl, and proteins were eluted with the solution at pH 5.0. All proteins were bound to hemin-Sepharose. Thus, three proteins with relatively low molecular weights that were tightly bound to blue dye could bind to heme. We then analyzed the N-terminal amino acid sequences of three proteins. The protein with a molecular mass of 22 kDa had the following amino acid sequence: (NH2)-N-S-L-F-G-S-V-E-T-W-. When we searched for the above sequence in the GenBankTM Data Bank, we found no homology with any known proteins. The 26 and 24 kDa proteins showed the sequence of (NH2)-V-L-E-L-Y-L-D-L-L-S- and (NH2)-P-P-Y-T-I-V-Y-F-P-V-, respectively. The latter sequences perfectly matched with GST-P1 (24Xu X. Stambrook P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30268-30273Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the former was with mouse GST-T1 (25Mainwaring G.W. Williams S.M. Foster J.R. Tugwood J. Green T. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 297-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). We then prepared a primer complementary to amino acid sequence positions 4–9 (FGSVET) and obtained a 112-bp partial cDNA fragment (clone 20) corresponding to a 22-kDa protein by the 5′-RACE PCR amplification method, using a mouse liver 5′-RACE cDNA library. The nucleotide sequence of clone 20 showed no homology to known sequences. We termed this 22-kDa heme-binding protein, p22-HBP. We then isolated the full-length cDNA. p22 HBP cDNA proved to be a 1033-bp insert with an open reading frame of 630 bp, which encodes a polypeptide of 190 amino acids with a molecular weight of 21,063 (Fig. 2). The amino acid sequence of the N terminus of purified p22 HBP coincided with the deduced amino acid sequence at position 7–16. The overall structure of the deduced amino acid sequence suggested that the protein is soluble. A search of the EMBL and GenBankTM Data Banks indicated that the amino acid sequence was not similar to any known proteins. While p22 HBP did not have a heme-regulated motif (3Lathrop J.T. Timko M.P. Science. 1993; 259: 522-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), an amino acid segment spanning amino acid positions 73–82 exhibited a hydrophobic region, suggesting that this region may be involved in heme-binding (35Shin W.S. Yamashita H. Hirose M. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 81-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 shows RNA blots of p22 HBP in mouse tissues. p22 HBP mRNA was ubiquitously expressed in various tissues. The extremely high level of expression in liver may reflect the requirement for p22 HBP in tissues where heme metabolism is high. Although faint bands were visible with testis or skeletal muscle RNA samples in the exposure given in Fig. 3, extended exposures revealed the same RNA species in these tissues. When the GST-p22 HBP was expressed in E. coli and purified by glutathione-Sepharose, the purified protein had a yellow color. Fig. 4 shows absorption spectrum of the recombinant p22 HBP after incubation with hemin in vitro. The peak in the Soret region of bound hemin to the protein at 408 nm shifted from that of unbound hemin at 397 nm. This spectrum resembled the spectra of major heme-binding proteins including GSTs, albumin, and HBP23 (a rat homologue to MSP23) (14Iwahara S. Satoh H. Song D.-X. Webb J. Burlingame A.L. Nagae Y.

Scatchard plots revealed that 55Fe-hemin binding to the GST-p22 HBP fusion protein had an affinity of K d = 26 ±1.8 nm. B max of the binding site in the GST-p22 HBP was 0.55 ± 0.021 pmol/pmol of protein (Fig. 5). The parasite GST expressed by pGEX-4T-1, used as control, did not bind hemin. Protoporphyrin IX and coproporphyrin III competed against 55Fe-hemin binding (40 nm) to the GST-p22 HBP with 50% inhibitory concentration of 22 and 75 nm, respectively (Fig. 6). High concentrations (>1 μm) of bilirubin, all-trans-retinoic acid, and palmitic acid were required for the 50% inhibition. These results indicate that porphyrin compounds as well as hemin can bind to p22 HBP.Figure 5Effect of hemin concentration on binding of55Fe-hemin to GST-p22 HBP fusion protein. Purified GST-p22 HBP fusion protein (2.5 μg) was incubated at 4 °C for 20 min with increasing concentrations of 55Fe-hemin (1,060 dpm/pmol heme) prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures.” To isolate the heme-p22 HBP complex, glutathione-Sepharose (50 μl) was added, and the preparation was mixed. After washing the beads, protein was eluted with solution containing 20 mm glutathione. The radioactivities in the eluted samples were determined. Specific binding (•) was calculated by subtracting nonspecific (- - -) from total binding of radioactive hemin (○). The amount of hemin bound to GST expressed by pGEX-4T-1 is also shown (▪).

Yoshinaga T. Furukawa T. Kohno H. Tokunaga R. Nishimura K. Inokuchi H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 760-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To examine involvement of p22 HBP in heme biosynthesis, total RNA was obtained from MEL cells at various periods after Me2SO treatment, and RNA blots were carried out using p22 HBP cDNA as a probe. As shown in Fig. 7 A, p22 HBP mRNA corresponding to about 1.0 kbp increased gradually with time up to 72 h. Hemin is an inducer of erythroid differentiation of MEL cells (38Beaumont C. Deybach J.-C. Grandchamp B. Da Silva V. De Verneuil H. Nordmann Y. Exp. Cell Res. 1984; 154: 474-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). We next examined the induction of p22 HBP mRNA in MEL cells treated with 100 μm hemin. Treatment of cells with hemin resulted in an increase in hemoglobin synthesis, similar to findings in MEL cells treated with Me2SO. p22 HBP mRNA increased with time, similar to the case of Me2SO-treated cells, but at 72 h the level of the RNA slightly decreased (Fig. 7 B). Thus, the p22 HBP mRNA was induced during MEL cell differentiation. As HBP23, a rat homologue to MSP23, was induced by treatment of rat primary cultured hepatocytes with hemin (39Immenschuh S. Iwahara S. Satoh H. Nell C. Katz N. Müller-Eberhard U. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13407-13411Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), we compared changes in p22 HBP in Me2SO- or hemin-treated MEL cells with those of MSP23. Fig. 8 shows immunoblot analysis of p22 HBP and MSP23 during MEL cell differentiation. The density of p22 HBP with a molecular mass of 22 kDa markedly increased with time by treatment with Me2SO, whereas MSP23 with a molecular mass of 23 kDa remained unchanged in cells for 72 h (Fig. 8 A). An increase in p22 HBP was also observed during hemin-induced differentiation of MEL cells but was absent in case of MSP23 (Fig. 8 B). The magnitudes of the induction of p22 HBP in Me2SO- and hemin-induced MEL cells were about 6-fold and 5-fold, respectively, at 72 h. Ferrochelatase with a molecular mass of 41 kDa is induced with concomitant increases in heme biosynthesis (29Taketani S. Yoshinaga T. Furukawa T. Kohno H. Tokunaga R. Nishimura K. Inokuchi H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 760-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and was increased prior to the increase of p22 HBP during Me2SO- and hemin-induced differentiation. Treatment of nonerythroid mouse macrophage RAW 264.7 cells with 100 μm hemin did not result in the induction of p22 HBP protein and its mRNA (data not shown). Therefore, p22 HBP seems to be markedly induced during erythroid differentiation. Expression of p22 HBP in MEL cells with oligonucleotides was estimated by immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 9 A, p22 HBP in cells transfected with sense-oligonucleotides was similar to that in control cells, whereas the protein in cells transfected with antisense oligonucleotides was markedly reduced compared with control cells. We finally examined effects of sense or antisense oligonucleotides on heme content during Me2SO-induced differentiation of MEL cells. The heme contents in cells transfected with antisense oligonucleotides, followed by treatment with 2% Me2SO for 24 and 48 h, decreased to"
https://openalex.org/W2067532663,"The ATP-dependent potassium (KATP) channel in the pancreatic β-cell is a complex of two proteins, the pore-forming Kir6.2 and the sulfonylurea receptor type 1 (SUR1). Both subunits are required for functional KATP channels because expression of Kir6.2 alone does not result in measurable currents. However, truncation of the last 26 or 36 amino acids of the C terminus of Kir6.2 enables functional expression of the pore-forming protein in the absence of SUR1. Thus, by using the truncated form of Kir6.2, expressed in the absence and presence of SUR1, it has been shown that the site at which ATP mediates channel inhibition is likely to be situated on Kir6.2. We have now examined the effects of long chain acyl-CoA (LC-CoA) esters on the C-terminally truncated mouse Kir6.2Δ365–390 (Kir6.2ΔC26) in inside-out patches isolated from Xenopus laevis oocytes. LC-CoA esters, saturated (C14:0, C16:0) and unsaturated (C18:1), increased Kir6.2ΔC26 currents, whereas short and medium chain CoA esters (C3:0, C8:0, C12:0) were unable to affect channel activity. The LC-CoA esters were also able to counteract the blocking effect of ATP on Kir6.2ΔC26. The stimulatory effect of the esters could be explained by the induction of a prolonged open state of Kir6.2ΔC26. In the presence of the esters, channel open time was increased approximately 3-fold, which is identical to what was obtained in the native mouse KATP channel. Coexpression of SUR1 together with Kir6.2ΔC26 did not further increase the ability of LC-CoA esters to stimulate channel activity. We conclude that Kir6.2 is the primary target for LC-CoA esters to activate the KATP channel and that the esters are likely to induce a conformational change by a direct interference with the pore-forming subunit, leading to openings of long duration.

ATP-sensitive potassium channel long chain acyl-CoA picosiemens not significant. The ATP-sensitive potassium channel (KATP1 channel) couples glucose metabolism to electrical activity and insulin secretion in the pancreatic β-cell. The metabolic regulation of the channel is thought to be mediated by changes in intracellular concentrations of ATP and ADP, which inhibit and stimulate channel activity, respectively (1Berggren P.O. Larsson O. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1994; 22: 12-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Thus, stimulation of the β-cell with glucose leads to an increased ATP/ADP ratio resulting in inhibition of KATPchannel activity, an effect which induces depolarization and activation of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels, thereby triggering insulin secretion. This implies that agents capable of modulating the activity of the channel may also affect fuel-induced insulin secretion. Recently, we discovered a new group of substances acting as KATP channel openers (2Larsson O. Deeney J.T. Bränström R. Berggren P.O. Corkey B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10623-10626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). It consists of long chain acyl-CoA (LC-CoA) esters that are endogenous substances found in many cells, including the pancreatic β-cell. The LC-CoA esters are very potent activators of the β-cell KATP channel, inducing a severalfold increase in channel activity (2Larsson O. Deeney J.T. Bränström R. Berggren P.O. Corkey B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10623-10626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Both saturated and unsaturated LC-CoA esters induce a rapid and reversible action on the KATP channel, whereas no stimulatory effect could be obtained with short chain CoA esters. We could not obtain an increased channel activity by administration of the fatty acid alone, nor following addition of the CoA-SH moiety. We have also shown that the LC-CoA esters are able to counteract the blocking effect of ATP. Thus, at a concentration of ATP that fully blocks channel activity, addition of LC-CoA ester reverses the nucleotide-induced inhibition (2Larsson O. Deeney J.T. Bränström R. Berggren P.O. Corkey B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10623-10626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 3Bränström R. Corkey B.E. Berggren P.O. Larsson O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17390-17394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The effects of the esters also appear to be specific for the KATP channel, in that at least two other potassium channels are unaffected by the esters, the large-conductance K+ channel and the 8 pS K+ channel described in the β-cell (2Larsson O. Deeney J.T. Bränström R. Berggren P.O. Corkey B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10623-10626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). This indicates that the KATP channel is a sensitive target for LC-CoA esters, and because of their ability to reverse the blocking effect of ATP, the esters may counteract glucose-induced depolarization of the β-cell membrane potential. The β-cell KATP channel is a complex of two proteins, the pore-forming protein Kir6.2 and the sulfonylurea receptor SUR1 (4Inagaki N. Gonoi T. Clement 4th., J.P. Namba N. Inazawa J. Gonzalez G. Aguilar-Bryan L. Seino S. Bryan J. Science. 1995; 270: 1166-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1623) Google Scholar). The SUR1 acts as a regulator of KATP channel activity, conferring sensitivity to sulfonylureas, diazoxide, and ADP (5Aguilar-Bryan L. Nichols C.G. Wechsler S.W. Clement J.P., IV Boyd III, A.E. Gonzalez G. Herrera-Sosa H. Nguy K. Bryan J. Nelson D.A. Science. 1995; 268: 423-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (1288) Google Scholar). Kir6.2 does not appear to express functional KATP currents alone. However, the C-terminally truncated form of Kir6.2, in which the last 26 or 36 amino acids have been deleted, forms functional channels (6Tucker S.J. Gribble F.M. Zhao C. Trapp S. Ashcroft F.M. Nature. 1997; 387: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). By using the truncated form of Kir6.2, it was recently shown that the primary site at which ATP acts to mediate KATP channel inhibition is located on Kir6.2 (6Tucker S.J. Gribble F.M. Zhao C. Trapp S. Ashcroft F.M. Nature. 1997; 387: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have examined the effects of LC-CoA esters on the C-terminally truncated mouse Kir6.2Δ365–390 (Kir6.2ΔC26). We show that LC-CoA esters activate the KATP channel by interacting at a binding site situated on the pore-forming subunit Kir6.2. The stimulatory effect was achieved by saturated and unsaturated LC-CoA esters and characterized by openings of long duration. Electrophysiological studies on the native KATP channel were performed on excised patches from β-cells isolated from adult obese mice (ob/ob). The animals were obtained from a local colony (7Hellman B. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1965; 131: 541-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) and were fasted for 24-h before decapitation. Islets were isolated by a collagenase technique (8Lacy P.E. Kostianovsky M. Diabetes. 1967; 16: 35-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (2499) Google Scholar). Collagenase was obtained from Boehringer Mannheim (Mannheim, Germany). A cell suspension was prepared as described earlier (9Lernmark A. Diabetologia. 1974; 10: 431-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). The cells were maintained for 1–3 days in RPMI 1640 culture medium (Flow Laboratories, Irvine, UK), containing 11 mm glucose, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine calf serum and antibiotics (100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 60 μg/ml gentamycin). The cells were seeded into Petri dishes (Nunc, Roshilde, Denmark) and incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2. For collection of oocytes, extra large female Xenopus laeviswere anaesthetized with 3-aminobenzoic acid methyl ester (1.5 g/liter of water, Sigma). Oocytes were removed from one ovary by laparotomy, the incision was sutured, and the animal was allowed to recover. Oocytes, stage V-VI, were defolliculated using collagenase A and injected using an Eppendorf transjector (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) with 0.5–5 ng of mRNA/50 nl of sterile RNase-free water, encoding Kir6.2ΔC26 or Kir6.2ΔC26 together with SUR1. Control oocytes were injected with 50 nl of sterile water alone. Oocytes were maintained in culture at a temperature of 19 °C, and experiments were performed 2–5 days after injection. The cDNAs of mouse Kir6.2 (GenBank accession number D50581) and hamster SUR1 (GenBank accession number L40623) were subcloned into pBluescript II SK (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), creating pB.mKir6.2 and pB.SUR1, respectively. Plasmid pB.mKir6.2Δ365–390 was generated by introducing a stop codon (R365Stop) into pB.mKir6.2 by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Capped mRNA was synthesized by in vitro transcription from linearized plasmids employing the mMESSAGE mMACHINE kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). The purified mRNA was dissolved in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and stored in aliquots at −80 °C until use. The standard extracellular solution contained (in mm) 138 NaCl, 5.6 KCl, 1.2 MgCl2, 2.6 CaCl2, and 5 HEPES-NaOH at pH 7.4. The intracellular solution (i.e. the bath solution) consisted of (in mm) 125 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 10 EGTA, 25 KOH, and 5 HEPES-KOH at pH 7.4. Recordings of channel activity in symmetrical K+ solutions were done with a pipette solution containing (in mm) 140 KCl, 1.2 MgCl2, 2.6 CaCl2, 5 HEPES-KOH at pH 7.4, and an internal (bath) solution consisting of (in mm) 110 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 30 KOH, 10 EGTA, 5 HEPES-KOH at pH 7.15. ATP was added as the Mg2+ salt to the “intracellular” solution as indicated in text and figures. ADP was added as Na+salt, and Mg2+ was added to maintain excess of Mg2+. cis-9-Monounsaturated oleoyl-CoA (C18:1), palmitoyl-CoA (C16:0), myristoyl-CoA (C14:0), lauroyl-CoA (C12:0), octanoyl-CoA (C8:0), and malonyl-CoA (C3:0) were prepared as stock solutions in deionized water (Millipore) and then added to the intracellular solution at the final concentrations indicated in the figures. Nucleotides and CoA esters were from Sigma. All reagents were of analytical grade. Excised inside-out patches from transfected oocytes were used to study the effects of the CoA esters on Kir6.2ΔC26 activity. This type of recording mode allows free access to the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane, making it easy to vary the intracellular composition. Pipettes were pulled from alumina or borosilicate glass (Hilgenberg, Malsfeld, Germany). Filled with standard extracellular solution, the electrodes had resistances between 1–5 megohm. Recordings were made using an Axon patch-clamp amplifier (Axopatch 200, Axon Instrument, CA). During the experiment, the current signal was stored on magnetic tape using a VCR (Sony-200, Sony, Tokyo, Japan). Channel records are displayed according to the convention that upward deflections denote outward currents and vice versa. The experiments were carried out at 20–22 °C. Records were filtered at 1 kHz (−3 dB value, 8 pole Bessel filter, Frequency Devices, Haverhill, MA), digitized at 5 kHz using an Axon instrument analogue digital converter (TL-1), and stored in a computer. A filter frequency of 1 kHz, used for single channel analysis, appeared optimal because an increased filter setting (5 kHz) did not significantly affect mean open time (data not shown). Digitized segments of current records (30 s) were also used to determine channel activity using in-house software. The mean current (iX) was calculated according to the following equation, iX=∑j=1N (Ij−IB)/N(Eq. 1) where N is the number of samples,Ij is the current registered in samplej and IB is the value of a user-defined baseline (10Larsson O. Ämmälä C. Bokvist K. Fredholm B. Rorsman P. J. Physiol. 1993; 463: 349-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The analysis of channel open time was restricted to segments of the experimental records containing a maximum of three active channels. Using the method of maximum likelihood (11Colquhoun D. Sigworth F.J. Sakmann B. Neher E. Single-Channel Recording. Plenum Press, New York1983: 191-263Crossref Google Scholar), the kinetic constants were derived by approximation of the data to exponential functions. Data are presented as means ± S.E. Effects on channel activity were compared using Student's t-test or ANOVA for multiple groups, and p values less than 0.05 were considered significant. LC-CoA esters activate the KATP channel in a similar way as Mg-ADP (3Bränström R. Corkey B.E. Berggren P.O. Larsson O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17390-17394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 10Larsson O. Ämmälä C. Bokvist K. Fredholm B. Rorsman P. J. Physiol. 1993; 463: 349-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Thus, the ability to counteract the blocking effect of ATP, prevent channel run down, and increase channel open time without affecting single channel conductance are characteristics shared by the two compounds (2Larsson O. Deeney J.T. Bränström R. Berggren P.O. Corkey B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10623-10626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 3Bränström R. Corkey B.E. Berggren P.O. Larsson O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17390-17394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The stimulatory action of Mg-ADP has been shown to be conferred to the nucleotide-binding folds of SUR1 (12Nichols C.G. Shyng S.L. Nestorowicz A. Glaser B. Clement J.P., IV Gonzalez G. Aguilar-Bryan L. Permutt M.A. Bryan J. Science. 1996; 272: 1785-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar) because mutations in these domains fully abolish the effect of Mg-ADP in cells co-expressing Kir6.2 and SUR1 (13Gribble F.M. Tucker S.J. Ashcroft F.M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1145-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Accordingly, in cells expressing the truncated Kir6.2, in the absence of SUR1, no stimulatory effect of ADP is obtained (6Tucker S.J. Gribble F.M. Zhao C. Trapp S. Ashcroft F.M. Nature. 1997; 387: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). As seen in Fig. 1 A, 1 μmpalmitoyl-CoA increased native KATP channel activity. While our earlier studies on the native KATP channel have shown that LC-CoA interacts with the channel complex at a binding site separate from that of ADP (3Bränström R. Corkey B.E. Berggren P.O. Larsson O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17390-17394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), we tested whether the stimulatory action of the esters was mediated by an effect on Kir6.2ΔC26. Interestingly, upon addition of 1 μm palmitoyl-CoA, a significant increase in Kir6.2ΔC26 channel activity was observed (Fig. 1 B). The presence of the LC-CoA ester induced an approximately 3.5-fold increase in mean Kir6.2ΔC26 (p< 0.05; n = 9). In oocytes coexpressing Kir6.2ΔC26 and SUR1, a similar extent of increased channel activity was obtained upon addition of 1 μm palmitoyl-CoA (Fig. 1 C). This strongly indicates that the site where LC-CoA esters bind to exert their stimulatory action on KATP channel activity is conferred to Kir6.2. The stimulatory effect was relatively slow in onset, comparable with what was seen in the native KATPchannel and in oocytes coexpressing SUR1 and Kir6.2ΔC26. In oocytes injected with 50 nl H2O, no effect of LC-CoA esters on channel activity was obtained (Fig. 1 D), showing that the stimulatory effect of the esters cannot be explained by activation of endogenous channels present in the oocyte. We have previously reported that the stimulatory effect of LC-CoA esters are dependent on chain length (2Larsson O. Deeney J.T. Bränström R. Berggren P.O. Corkey B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10623-10626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In accordance with these findings, the effects of the esters on Kir6.2ΔC26 channel activity were also chain length-dependent. Thus, whereas addition of oleoyl-CoA induced a significant increase in channel activity (Fig. 2 A), no effect of malonyl-CoA (C3:0), octanoyl-CoA (C8:0), or lauroyl-CoA (C12:0) ester on Kir6.2ΔC26 currents could be obtained (Fig. 2,B-D). Thus, ATP blocked Kir6.2ΔC26 currents, whereas both saturated (palmitoyl-CoA; C16:0, myristoyl-CoA; C14:0) and unsaturated (oleoyl-CoA; C18:1) LC-CoA esters stimulated the activity of Kir6.2ΔC26 (Fig. 2 E). Taken together, these actions of the different acyl-CoA esters on Kir6.2ΔC26 currents are virtually identical to what we have reported on KATP channel activity from the mouse pancreatic β-cell (2Larsson O. Deeney J.T. Bränström R. Berggren P.O. Corkey B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10623-10626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In agreement with earlier studies, inclusion of 0.1 mm ADP, known to stimulate native channel activity, did not affect the activity of Kir6.2ΔC26 (Fig. 2 E). Next, we recorded Kir6.2ΔC26 currents from giant inside-out patches excised from Xenopus oocytes in symmetrical concentrations of potassium. We then applied a series of voltage ramps from −80 mV to +80 mV, in the absence and presence of LC-CoA ester. As seen in Fig. 3 A, left, application of 1 μm palmitoyl-CoA to the intracellular solution increased Kir6.2ΔC26 currents. The associated current-voltage relationship of the macroscopic currents shows an increase in current at both positive and negative potentials after addition of the ester (Fig. 3 A, right). To further characterize rectification properties of Kir6.2ΔC26, we analyzed the single channel current-voltage relationship at potentials between −80 mV and +80 mV, as shown in Fig. 3 B. The single channel slope conductance, assessed from fitting a straight line between Vm −80 to +20 mV, was estimated to 65.4 ± 1.6 pS (n = 5) in control solution and to 63.8 ± 1.6 pS (n = 3;n.s.) in the presence of the LC-CoA ester. These values of single channel conductance are in good accordance with earlier studies (6Tucker S.J. Gribble F.M. Zhao C. Trapp S. Ashcroft F.M. Nature. 1997; 387: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). At positive potentials, palmitoyl-CoA did not affect rectification, and it is therefore highly unlikely that stimulatory effects of LC-CoA esters result from an alteration in inward rectification. Furthermore, it should be noted that the LC-CoA ester-induced increase in KATP channel activity is as efficient in the absence of internal Na+ or Mg2+ (3Bränström R. Corkey B.E. Berggren P.O. Larsson O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17390-17394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), ions known to cause inward rectification (14Horie M. Irisawa H. Noma A. J. Physiol. 1987; 387: 251-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 C, shows single channel activity for inward currents in the absence and presence of LC-CoA ester, on an expanded time scale. Our data strongly suggest that not only the inhibitory action of ATP is conferred to Kir6.2, but that Kir6.2 also possesses an intrinsic LC-CoA stimulatory site. We therefore examined whether ATP-induced inhibition of Kir6.2ΔC26 currents could be counteracted by applying LC-CoA esters. As shown in Fig. 4 A, addition of 1 mm ATP almost fully blocked currents through Kir6.2ΔC26. Addition of 1 μm LC-CoA was able to reverse the ATP-induced block of Kir6.2ΔC26 activity. Thus, following addition of 1 μm LC-CoA esters, Kir6.2ΔC26 currents increased to 350 ± 80% in the continued presence of 1 mm ATP, as compared with the activity observed in the presence of only ATP (n = 4; p < 0.01). These results cannot be explained by ATP losing its inhibitory effect with time because in control experiments, ATP was able to suppress Kir6.2ΔC26 currents for several minutes (Fig. 4 B). Compiled data of the stimulatory effect of LC-CoA in the presence of ATP are shown in Fig. 4 C. It is clear that LC-CoA esters are unable to fully neutralize the inhibitory effect of ATP. We have previously reported that LC-CoA esters induce a distinct open state of the KATP channel, characterized by openings of long duration (3Bränström R. Corkey B.E. Berggren P.O. Larsson O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17390-17394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). To investigate whether this effect is conferred to Kir6.2, we made a detailed study on Kir6.2ΔC26 open time kinetics for outward currents and compared the obtained results to the kinetics observed in the native KATP channel. Fig. 5 shows the effects on open time distribution of Kir6.2ΔC26 and native KATP currents during control and following exposure of the patches to Mg-ADP and LC-CoA esters, respectively. In control solution, absence of adenine nucleotides and acyl-CoA esters, Kir6.2ΔC26 channel activity consisted of very short openings (Fig. 5 A, inset). The distribution of openings was best described by a single exponential with a time constant (τ) of 5.1 ms. In comparison, the native KATP channel exhibited slightly longer openings, well fitted by a single exponential function with a resulting τ of 17.1 ms (Fig. 5 A, right). Addition of 100 μm Mg-ADP did not affect Kir6.2ΔC26 channel kinetics (Fig. 5 B, left), whereas the native KATP channel exhibited a typical pattern of short and long openings (10Larsson O. Ämmälä C. Bokvist K. Fredholm B. Rorsman P. J. Physiol. 1993; 463: 349-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In the latter case, the distribution of openings was best fitted using a two-exponential function. Analysis of the observed time constants resulted in τ1 of 17.7 ms and τ2 of 161.2 ms, where the slow component comprised 27%. The effects of Mg-ADP on native channels correspond well to our earlier studies and confirm the fact that the stimulatory action of Mg-ADP is not conferred to Kir6.2 (6Tucker S.J. Gribble F.M. Zhao C. Trapp S. Ashcroft F.M. Nature. 1997; 387: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar, 10Larsson O. Ämmälä C. Bokvist K. Fredholm B. Rorsman P. J. Physiol. 1993; 463: 349-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The presence of LC-CoA esters induced two types of Kir6.2ΔC26 channel openings, short openings, similar to those observed under control conditions, and long openings, occasionally lasting up to 50 ms (Fig. 5 C, left). Consequently, open time distribution was best described as the sum of two exponentials with τ1 of 5.9 ms and τ2of 17.2 ms, respectively. The slow component comprised approximately 29% of the channel opening during these experimental conditions. Similar results were obtained using the native KATPchannel, with the exception that the time constants were longer, τ1 22.5 ms and τ2 149.5 ms, respectively. Thus, LC-CoA esters activate both Kir6.2ΔC26 and native KATP channel currents, probably by promoting a conformational change of the channel protein that results in the induction of a long lasting open state. We further analyzed mean open time in Kir6.2ΔC26 and native channels, respectively (Fig. 6). In the absence of nucleotides and acyl-CoA, mean open time for Kir6.2ΔC26 was estimated to 5.4 ± 0.9 ms (n = 4). The corresponding value for the native channel was 22.8 ± 3.1 ms (n = 5). Thus, Kir6.2ΔC26 currents exhibited a mean open time approximately four times faster than what we observed in the native channel (p < 0.01). No effect of Mg-ADP on Kir6.2ΔC26 mean open time could be observed, whereas the nucleotide increased native KATP mean open time approximately 3-fold, to 68.0 ± 4.2 ms (n = 3; p < 0.01), well in agreement with earlier reports (3Bränström R. Corkey B.E. Berggren P.O. Larsson O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17390-17394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 10Larsson O. Ämmälä C. Bokvist K. Fredholm B. Rorsman P. J. Physiol. 1993; 463: 349-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). As expected from the results obtained on open time kinetics, Kir6.2ΔC26 mean open time increased from 5.4 ± 0.9 ms in the absence to 14.3 ± 2.6 ms (n = 3; p < 0.01) in the presence of LC-CoA. This relative increase is similar to what we found in native channels, from 22.8 ± 3.1 ms to 61.6 ± 4.5 ms (n = 3; p < 0.01) (3Bränström R. Corkey B.E. Berggren P.O. Larsson O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17390-17394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Thus, LC-CoA esters induce an approximately 3-fold increase in mean open time in both Kir6.2ΔC26 and native KATP channel currents. The molecular background to the faster kinetic properties of Kir6.2ΔC26, as compared with the native KATP channel, is not clear. In preliminary studies, we found that coexpression of Kir6.2ΔC26 with SUR1 normalizes open time kinetics and thus, that the SUR moiety affects channel gating. Indeed, differences in burst duration and interburst interval observed in the β-cell KATP (Kir6.2 and SUR1) channel and following combination of Kir6.2 with SUR2, expressed in heart and skeletal muscle, point to the influence of the SUR moiety on channel gating properties. However, single channel conductance, inward rectification, and mean channel open and closed times within bursts are similar in Kir6.2/SUR1 and Kir6.2/SUR2 (15Inagaki N. Gonoi T. Clement J.P. Wang C.Z. Aguilar-Bryan L. Bryan J. Seino S. Neuron. 1996; 16: 1011-1017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar). It is, therefore, reasonable to assume that these properties of ion conductance are determined by the pore-forming subunit. Taken together, we speculate that the difference in kinetics between the truncated Kir6.2 and native KATP channel activity is caused by the C-terminal truncation of Kir6.2 in combination with the absence of SUR1. It is important to note that the relative increase in channel activity, following addition of LC-CoA ester, is virtually identical in Kir6.2ΔC26 and native channels. This strongly supports the notion that the stimulatory effects of the esters on KATP channel activity is conferred to Kir6.2. Our earlier studies have shown that LC-CoA esters are potent activators of KATP channel activity in the mouse pancreatic β-cell and that CoA esters interact at a binding site different from that of ADP. We have earlier proposed that this binding site could be conferred to SUR1 (3Bränström R. Corkey B.E. Berggren P.O. Larsson O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17390-17394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), based on the fact that the site of action of all other channel openers at that time were acting at SUR1 and that the changes in channel open time kinetics after inclusion of ADP, diazoxide, or LC-CoA esters exhibited a striking similarity. We now show that the esters directly activate Kir6.2ΔC26 and, thus, that the binding site of LC-CoA is conferred to the pore-forming subunit. Our data also show that the stimulatory effect of LC CoA esters does not involve alterations in inward rectification of Kir6.2ΔC26 currents nor affects single channel conductance. The relative increase in channel activity, induced by LC-CoA, is identical to what was found in the native channel although Kir6.2ΔC26 channel kinetics are significantly faster compared with native mouse KATPchannels. We therefore suggest that the site where LC-CoA esters exert their stimulatory action on KATP channel activity is located on Kir6.2. Because Kir6.2 is thought to constitute the pore-forming subunit of KATP channels found in brain, smooth-, cardiac-, and skeletal muscle (16Sakura H. Ämmälä C. Smith P.A. Gribble F.M. Ashcroft F.M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 338-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar), as well as in pancreatic α- and δ-cells (17Suzuki K. Fujiwara K. Inagaki N. Seino S. Takata K. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1440-1444Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), we postulate that LC-CoA esters also activate KATP channels present in these cells. It is therefore plausible that the stimulatory effect of LC-CoA esters on the inward rectifier Kir6.2 constitutes an important mechanism by which KATP channel activity is increased in several cell types."
https://openalex.org/W2163382999,"Scavenger receptor, class B, type I (SR-BI) is a cell surface glycoprotein that mediates selective uptake and efflux of sterols from high density lipoproteins (HDL) to cells. A Chinese hamster ovary cell line that is deficient in functional LDL receptors, but has high expression levels of recombinant SR-BI (ldlA7-SR-BI), was used to examine the effect of SR-BI on the trafficking of sterols between lipoproteins and cells. To monitor the fate of sterols transported by SR-BI into cells, we measured the incorporation of [14C]oleate into cholesterol esters by acyl-CoA:cholesteryl acyltransferase in the endoplasmic reticulum. We show that incubation of ldlA7-SRBI cells with either LDL or HDL resulted in an equally dramatic increase in the formation of [14C]oleate-labeled cholesterol esters. The lipoprotein-stimulated, SR-BI-dependent increase in cholesterol esterification was inhibited by chloroquine. The uptake of sterols and their incorporation into cholesterol esters by SR-BI from LDL was largely a selective process. The addition of free cholesterol to ldlA7-SRBI cells also stimulated cholesterol ester formation in a chloroquine-sensitive fashion. We also show that SR-BI mediates the efflux of endogenously synthesized sterols from the cell membrane. From these studies we conclude that, in the absence of the LDL receptor, overexpression of SR-BI can mediate significant transport of sterols between lipoproteins and the endoplasmic reticulum of cells.

To monitor the fate of sterols transported by SR-BI into cells, we measured the incorporation of [14C]oleate into cholesterol esters by acyl-CoA:cholesteryl acyltransferase in the endoplasmic reticulum. We show that incubation of ldlA7-SRBI cells with either LDL or HDL resulted in an equally dramatic increase in the formation of [14C]oleate-labeled cholesterol esters. The lipoprotein-stimulated, SR-BI-dependent increase in cholesterol esterification was inhibited by chloroquine. The uptake of sterols and their incorporation into cholesterol esters by SR-BI from LDL was largely a selective process. The addition of free cholesterol to ldlA7-SRBI cells also stimulated cholesterol ester formation in a chloroquine-sensitive fashion. We also show that SR-BI mediates the efflux of endogenously synthesized sterols from the cell membrane. From these studies we conclude that, in the absence of the LDL receptor, overexpression of SR-BI can mediate significant transport of sterols between lipoproteins and the endoplasmic reticulum of cells. scavenger receptor, class B, type I acyl-CoA:cholesteryl acyltransferase bovine serum albumin Chinese hamster ovary Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium endoplasmic reticulum high density lipoprotein low density lipoprotein LDL receptor-related protein newborn calf lipoprotein-deficient serum phosphate-buffered saline. Scavenger receptor, class B, type I (SR-BI)1 is an ∼82-kDa, palmitylated, cell surface glycoprotein that binds high density and low density lipoproteins (HDL and LDL) with high affinity (1Acton S.L.

Expression of SR-BI in cultured cells is associated with the selective transfer of lipid, but not apoproteins from HDL to cells (1Acton S.L. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T. Xu S. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M. Science. 1996; 271: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (2011) Google Scholar). SR-BI is expressed at high levels in the liver and in the major steroid-producing regions of the adrenal gland (zona fasiculata and zona reticularis), ovary (corpus luteum), and testes (interstitial cells) of rodents (4Landschulz K.T.

This tissue pattern of expression and regulation of SR-BI in rodents is consistent with SR-BI being the functionally well characterized HDL receptor that mediates uptake of cholesterol esters in steroidogenic tissues and the liver (8Balasubramaniam S.

The phenotype of mice lacking functional SR-BI (SR-BI −/− mice) confirms the central role of this receptor in HDL metabolism of rodents;SR-BI −/− mice accumulate large, cholesterol ester-rich HDL particles in their plasma and have a greater than 2-fold increase in plasma HDL-cholesterol levels (12Rigotti A.

The mechanism by which SR-BI delivers cholesterol esters to cells is unknown, but it appears different from the well characterized LDL receptor endocytic pathway (13Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Science. 1986; 232: 34-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (4383) Google Scholar). LDL binds to LDL receptors, which are clustered in coated pits on the cell surface. The lipoprotein particles, together with the receptors, are taken up and delivered to endosomes, where the receptors and ligands dissociate, and the receptors are recycled to the cell surface. LDL particles are then transported to lysosomes, where the protein components of the lipoproteins are degraded and the cholesterol esters are hydrolyzed by acid lipase. Free cholesterol released from the particle is transported across the lysosomal membrane, a process that requires NPC1, the gene defective in the lysosomal storage disease Nieman-Pick, type C (14Carstea E.D. Morris J.A. Coleman K.G. Loftus S.K. Zhang D. Cummings C. Gu J. Rosenfeld M.A. Pavan W.J. Krizman D.B. Nagle J. Polymeropoulos M.H. et al.Science. 1997; 277: 228-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (1230) Google Scholar). The lipoprotein-derived cholesterol that enters the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is re-esterified by acyl-CoA:cholesteryl acyltransferase (ACAT) and stored as cholesterol esters in lipid droplets within the cell (15Chang T.Y. Chang C.C.Y. Cheng D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 613-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). In contrast to the LDL receptor, SR-BI is concentrated in caveolae, which are cholesterol- and sphingomyelin-rich microdomains of the cell surface membrane (3Babitt J. Trigatti B. Rigotti A. Smart E.J. Anderson R.G.W. Xu S. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13242-13249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 16Anderson R.G.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 199-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (1727) Google Scholar). HDL binds to SR-BI with high affinity, and this binding is associated with the uptake of cholesterol esters from the lipoprotein without the concomitant degradation of apolipoproteins, by a mechanism that remains poorly understood (1Acton S.L. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T. Xu S. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M. Science. 1996; 271: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (2011) Google Scholar). The fate of the lipids that are transported by SR-BI into cells has not been clearly delineated. Specifically, it has not been shown whether lipoprotein-derived lipids transported by SR-BI are substrates for ACAT. In this study we have examined the ligand-binding characteristics of SR-BI and determined if sterols internalized by SR-BI are transported from the cell surface to the ER for esterification by ACAT (15Chang T.Y. Chang C.C.Y. Cheng D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 613-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). We show that SR-BI expression is associated with a dramatic increase in lipoprotein-stimulated cholesterol esterification. We also show that LDL, which binds SR-BI with high affinity (2Acton S.L. Scherer P.E. Lodish H.F. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21003-21009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Calvo D. Gomez-Coronado D. Lasuncion M.A. Vega M.A. Aterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 2341-2349Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), is as effective as HDL in stimulating cholesterol esterification in an SR-BI-dependent manner in cells lacking a functional LDL receptor. The SR-BI-mediated uptake of lipids from LDL is largely selective and is not associated with significant degradation of the protein components of the lipoprotein particles. We also show that SR-BI expression allows free, nonlipoprotein-associated cholesterol to enter cells and to stimulate cholesterol esterification. Thus, SR-BI-mediated cholesterol uptake is not limited to cholesterol contained in lipoproteins. The SR-BI-mediated stimulation of cholesterol esterification by nonlipoprotein cholesterol as well as by LDL and HDL required the maintenance of acidic compartments in the cell; esterification is inhibited by the addition of chloroquine, whether the cholesterol is provided as free cholesterol or as part of a lipoprotein particle. Finally, we demonstrate that SR-BI mediates the efflux of endogenously synthesized sterols to LDL as well as to HDL. The mouse SR-BI cDNA (kindly provided by Monty Krieger, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA) was subjected to restriction digestion usingXhoI and HindIII and subcloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells that lack LDL receptor activity (ldlA7 cells) (18Kingsley D.M. Krieger M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 5454-5458Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) were stably transfected with pcDNA3-SRBI (ldlA7-SRBI) using the MBS mammalian transfection kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Clones were screened for expression of SR-BI employing immunoblot analysis using polyclonal rabbit antipeptide antibodies directed against the last 14 amino acids of the COOH terminus of murine SR-BI (IgG-SRBI). A subclone of the cell line with the highest expression of immunodetectable SR-BI (ldlA7-SRBI) and two other independently isolated subclones (ldlA7-SRBIa and ldlA7-SRBIb) were selected for further study. Immunofluorescence studies were performed by incubating the cells with either IgG-SRBI or an affinity-purified rabbit anti-human caveolin-1 polyclonal antibody (Transduction Laboratory, Lexington, KY) and then with fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA) (4Landschulz K.T. Pathak R.K. Rigotti A. Krieger M. Hobbs H.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 984-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). The ldlA7-SRBI cells were maintained in 100-mm dishes in medium A (1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) and Ham's F-12 medium with 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate), supplemented with 5% (v/v) fetal calf serum and 0.25 mg/ml Geneticin® (G418 sulfate, Life Technologies, Inc.). The ldlA7 and ldlA7-SRBI cells were plated at a cell density of 70,000 cells/well in six-well plates in medium A with 5% (v/v) fetal calf serum. On day 2, the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and refed with medium A containing 5% (v/v) newborn calf lipoprotein-deficient serum (NCLPPS). Membranes were prepared from cultured cells (4Landschulz K.T. Pathak R.K. Rigotti A. Krieger M. Hobbs H.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 984-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar), and aliquots (50 μg of protein) were subjected to 6.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis prior to transfer to nitrocellulose (Hybond C, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Immunoblotting was performed as described previously (4Landschulz K.T. Pathak R.K. Rigotti A. Krieger M. Hobbs H.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 984-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar) using IgG-SRBI (1:5000), IgG-638 (1:5000), a rabbit polyclonal anti-bovine LDL receptor antibody (19Herz J. Kowal R.C. Ho Y.K. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21355-21362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), IgG-377 (1:1000), a rabbit anti-mouse LDL receptor-related protein (LRP) antibody (20Willnow T.E. Armstrong S.A. Hammer R.E. Herz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4537-4541Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), or anti-caveolin-1 antibody (1:4000). After incubation with the primary antibody, the bound IgG was detected using horseradish peroxidase-coupled donkey anti-rabbit IgG and the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (4Landschulz K.T. Pathak R.K. Rigotti A. Krieger M. Hobbs H.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 984-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). The filters were exposed to Kodak DuPont NEF 496 film at room temperature for the indicated times. The relative intensities of the bands were determined using a Hewlett-Packard Scan Jet 3c/T scanner (Hewlett-Packard Co., Palo Alto, CA) and NIH Image version 1.59 software. Human HDL (density (d) = 1.09–1.21 g/liter) and LDL (d = 1.04–1.063 g/liter) was prepared by zonal centrifugation (21Chung B.H. Segrest J.P. Ray M.J. Brunzell J.D. Hokanson J.E. Krauss R.M. Beaudrie K. Cone J.T. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 128: 181-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). The lipoproteins were delipidated and 50 μg was subjected to 4–15% SDS-polyacrylamide gradient gel electrophoresis and stained using Coomassie Blue or silver stain reagents; the lipoproteins used for the experiments described in this paper contained no detectable apolipoprotein E (data not shown). The total cholesterol (cholesterol/HP system pack, Boehringer Mannheim) and protein mass (22Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) of the lipoproteins were measured; the mass ratios of cholesterol to protein were ∼1:4 for HDL, and 1:1.3 for LDL. The lipoproteins were iodinated using the iodine monochloride method (23Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar), and the specific activity ranged from 75 to 100 cpm/ng protein. All lipoproteins were dialyzed extensively against 150 mm NaCl and 0.24 mm sodium EDTA, pH 7.4, before being used. To measure SR-BI-mediated stimulation of cholesterol esterification, the cells were grown as described previously except that 10 μm sodium compactin (Sigma) and 100 μm sodium mevalonate (Sigma) were added to the medium on day 2. On day 3, the cells were washed three times with PBS and incubated in 2 ml of DMEM containing 2 mg/ml fatty-acid-free bovine serum albumin (BSA) prior to addition of varying concentrations of HDL, LDL, or cholesterol. After a 5-h incubation with lipoproteins, the cells were pulsed with 0.2 mm[14C]oleate (∼10,000 dpm/nmol) (NEN Life Science Products) for 2 h. Then the cells were washed three times with buffer A (50 mm Tris, 0.9% NaCl, and 0.2% BSA, pH 7.4), and once with buffer B (50 mm Tris and 0.9% NaCl, pH 7.4). The lipids were extracted twice from the cell monolayer and analyzed by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) (Silica Gel G, Machete-Nagel, Dueren, Germany) (23Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar). The cells were dissolved in 1 ml of 0.1 nNaOH, and the protein was quantitated using the Lowry method (22Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ldlA7 and ldlA7-SRBI cells were incubated with125I-LDL in medium A supplemented with 2 mg/ml fatty-acid-free BSA for 5 h and pulsed with 0.2 mm [14C]oleate for 2 h. The medium was removed, and the proteins were precipitated using trichloroacetic acid. The supernatant was extracted with chloroform and oxidized with hydrogen peroxide. An aliquot was counted to determine the amount of acid-soluble material formed by the cells (which is mostly [125I]iodotyrosine) (23Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar). The degradation activity, representing the cell-dependent proteolysis, is expressed in micrograms of 125I-labeled, acid-soluble protein formed per mg of total cell protein. The cell monolayers were washed, and lipids were extracted and analyzed by TLC as described above. Cells were maintained as described above except that on day 2 the medium was removed and the cells were washed twice with PBS and refed with medium A containing 5% NCLPPS serum. A total of 5 μCi of [3H]cholesterol, 5 μCi of [14C]acetate (NEN Life Science Products), or 40 μm compactin and 1 mm[3H]mevalonate (140 dpm/pmol) was added to each well (24Ho Y.K. Faust J.R. Bilheimer D.W. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Exp. Med. 1977; 145: 1531-1549Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar,25Faust J.R. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1979; 192: 86-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). After 24 h the cells were washed three times with buffer A and once with buffer B prior to incubation in DMEM with 2 mg/ml fatty acid-free BSA and either HDL or LDL in the concentrations indicated. The medium was removed and the cells were washed twice with PBS prior to being lysed by adding 1 ml of 0.1 n NaOH. Aliquots of the medium and [3H]cholesterol-labeled cells were analyzed using β-scintillation counting. For the [14C]acetate and [3H]mevalonate-labeled cells, aliquots of the medium and cells were analyzed exactly as described (24Ho Y.K. Faust J.R. Bilheimer D.W. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Exp. Med. 1977; 145: 1531-1549Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 25Faust J.R. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1979; 192: 86-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). To study the role of SR-BI independently of the LDL receptor, we expressed recombinant mouse SR-BI (1Acton S.L. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T. Xu S. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M. Science. 1996; 271: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (2011) Google Scholar) in CHO cell lines devoid of functional LDL receptors (ldlA7 cells) (18Kingsley D.M. Krieger M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 5454-5458Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence studies were performed using IgG-SRBI and an anti-caveolin antibody. A similar linear punctate pattern of staining was seen on the cell surface of the SR-BI-expressing cells using both antibodies (data not shown), which is consistent with SR-BI being located in caveolae, as has been described previously (3Babitt J. Trigatti B. Rigotti A. Smart E.J. Anderson R.G.W. Xu S. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13242-13249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Immunoblot analyses of membrane fractions from the parental cell line (CHO-7) (lane 1), ldlA7 cells (lane 2), and subclones of stably transformed ldlA7 cells expressing variable amounts of SR-BI (lanes 3–5) were performed using IgG-SRBI (Fig. 1,top panel). Low levels of SR-BI were present in the CHO-7 and ldlA7 cells. The levels of immunodetectable SR-BI were up to 75-fold higher in the ldlA7-SRBI cells (lane 3) than in the ldlA7 cells. Two other ldlA7-SRBI subclones that expressed lower amounts of SR-BI are shown in lanes 4 and 5. A doublet was apparent in one of the subclones (lane 5), but was not seen in the other SR-BI-expressing cell lines. The slightly smaller immunoreactive band in the ldlA7-SRBIb cells (lane 5) likely represents SR-BI protein that has not been fully glycosylated. As expected, immunoreactive LDL receptor was present in the wild-type CHO-7 cells (lane 1, second panel); no LDL receptor was detected in any of the other cell lines even after a prolonged exposure of the blot to film. As a control, all of the cell lines expressed similar amounts of LRP (20Willnow T.E. Armstrong S.A. Hammer R.E. Herz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4537-4541Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), another cell surface receptor. Increased levels of expression of SR-BI were not associated with any changes in the steady state levels of caveolin-1, a structural protein of caveolae (bottom panel). Although it was shown previously that SR-BI mediates selective transport of lipids from HDL into cells (1Acton S.L. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T. Xu S. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M. Science. 1996; 271: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (2011) Google Scholar), the intracellular fate of the lipoprotein-derived lipids has not been defined. To determine if SR-BI expression increases the delivery of sterols from lipoproteins to the ER for cholesterol esterification, ldlA7 and ldlA7-SRBI cells were incubated with increasing amounts of human HDL or LDL for 5 h, followed by a 2-h incubation with [14C]oleate. The total mass of cholesterol converted to cholesterol ester within the 2 h interval was measured by thin layer chromatography (TLC) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Almost no increase in esterification was seen in the ldlA7 cells after the addition of either LDL or HDL (Fig. 2,panel A). In contrast, addition of LDL or HDL to the ldlA7-SRBI cells resulted in a dramatic increase in esterification (panel B). For any given amount of lipoprotein mass added to the medium, the amount of cholesterol esters formed was higher with LDL than with HDL. When the same data was replotted as a function of the amount of total cholesterol added to the cells (panel C), a similar response curve was seen with LDL and HDL. Uptake of [14C]oleate (1300 versus 1200 pmol/mg) and incorporation into triglycerides (34,500 versus 36,000 pmol/mg) and phospholipids (59,000 versus 54,000 pmol/mg) were not significantly different between ldlA7 and ldlA7-SRBI with both LDL and HDL. Thus, in the absence of the LDL receptor, SR-BI expression is associated with an increase in lipoprotein-stimulated cholesterol esterification, and LDL is as effective as HDL as a sterol donor. Data for this experiment, as well as all the other experiments described in this paper were generated using the ldlA7-SRBI cells. To ensure that the observations made were not a clone-specific artifact, every experiment was repeated in the ldlA7-SR-BIa and ldlA7-SRBIb cells; similar results were obtained, and the magnitude of the changes was proportional to the amount of SR-BI protein expressed (Fig. 1). A time course of the lipoprotein-stimulated incorporation of [14C]oleate into cholesterol esters in the ldlA7-SRBI cells is shown in Fig. 3. Cells were incubated with 100 μg of protein/ml of either HDL or LDL for the indicated time periods, after which the cells were labeled with [14C]oleate for an additional 2 h. Cells incubated with [14C]oleate in the absence of lipoproteins had a low level of [14C]oleate incorporation (∼50 pmol/2 h/mg), which did not change with time (data not shown). A small increase in cholesterol esterification was seen in the ldlA7 cells incubated with either LDL or HDL (panel A), which is likely due to the low levels of SR-BI present in these cells (see Fig. 1). In the ldlA7-SRBI cells, a linear increase in cholesterol esterification began 1 h after the addition of either LDL or HDL (panel B). To determine the effect of SR-BI expression on the amount of cellular cholesterol, we measured the level of total cholesterol in the ldlA7 and ldlA7-SRBI cells after incubation with media alone or the addition of either LDL or HDL (100 μg/ml). The level of total cellular cholesterol was 1.4-fold higher in the ldlA7-SRBI cells than the ldlA7 cells with no addition of lipoproteins (13.5 versus 9.5 μg of cholesterol/mg). No significant change in the level of cholesterol was seen in the ldlA7 cells after the addition of LDL and HDL. In the ldlA7-SRBI cells there was a ∼1.5- and 1.8-fold increase in total cellular cholesterol content after addition of HDL and LDL, respectively. The pathway by which SR-BI expression stimulates lipoprotein-associated cholesterol esterification was probed using chloroquine, a weak base that accumulates in acidic compartments and neutralizes their pH (26De Duve C. De Barsy T. Poole B. Trouet A. Tulkens P. Van Hoof F. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1974; 23: 2495-2531Crossref PubMed Scopus (1549) Google Scholar). Cells were preincubated for 15 min with chloroquine prior to the addition of 100 μg of protein/ml HDL or LDL for 5 h. The cells were then pulsed with [14C]oleate for 2 h. A dose-dependent decrease in lipoprotein-associated cholesterol esterification was seen with the addition of increasing amounts of chloroquine to the cells (Fig. 4). Lipoprotein-stimulated cholesterol esterification was completely blocked at 50 μmchloroquine (panel B), which is similar to the level at which this drug inhibits uptake of LDL by the LDL receptor (27Goldstein J.L. Brunschede G.Y. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 7854-7862Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To ensure that chloroquine did not inhibit ACAT activity, the cells were incubated with 25-hydroxycholesterol for 5 h and then pulsed with [14C]oleate for 2 h in the presence or absence of 50 μm chloroquine; the amount of cholesterol esters formed was nearly identical in the two sets of cells (panel C). These data are consistent with SR-BI-dependent stimulated cholesterol esterification requiring the maintenance of some acidic compartment(s) within the cell. Previously, Acton et al. (1Acton S.L. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T. Xu S. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M. Science. 1996; 271: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (2011) Google Scholar) showed that uptake of cholesterol from HDL via SR-BI was not coupled to degradation of the protein component. To determine if SR-BI mediates selective uptake of lipid from LDL as well as HDL, we repeated the esterification experiments using 125I-labeled LDL (Fig. 5). In CHO-7 cells, LDL-stimulated esterification was completely inhibited by 50 μmchloroquine (Fig. 5, panel A). These cells, which are the parental cell line for the ldlA7 cells, express both the LDL receptor and SR-BI (Fig. 1). In contrast, no esterification of cholesterol was seen in the LDL receptor-deficient ldlA7 cells in the presence or absence of chloroquine (data not shown). In the ldlA7-SRBI cells, which lack LDL receptors but have supraphysiologic levels of SR-BI, the level of LDL-stimulated cholesterol esterification was high (panel B) and markedly reduced with the addition of chloroquine. The degradation of the protein component of the LDL was measured in the same experiments. In CHO-7 cells, degradation of125I-lipoprotein was reduced by addition of chloroquine (panel C), but there still was an unexpectedly high level of residual degradation in these cells. To confirm that our lipoprotein particles were not denatured, parallel experiments were performed in cultured human fibroblasts and CHO-KI cells, the parental cell line of the CHO-7 cells. A complete inhibition of 125I-LDL degradation was seen with addition of 50 μm chloroquine (data not shown). Therefore, the relative resistance of the CHO-7 cells to LDL degradation by chloroquine was cell-specific, and not due to an artifact associated with lipoprotein labeling. CHO-7 cells, unlike CHO-K1 cells, have been adapted to grow in NCLPPS (28Metherall J.E. Goldstein J.L. Luskey K.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15634-15641Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which may have selected for an alternative, yet-to-be-defined lipid uptake mechanism. In contrast to the parental cell line (CHO-7), the ldlA7 cells did not degrade 125I-LDL in the absence or presence of chloroquine (data not shown). Low levels of 125I-LDL degradation were seen in the ldlA7-SRBI cells (panel D), which was completely blocked by chloroquine. The ratio of cholesteryl [14C]oleate formation to LDL degradation in the ldlA7-SRBI cells (without chloroquine) was 2.9, whereas in the CHO-7 cells it was 0.9. The same experiments were performed using HDL, and no degradation was seen in either the ldlA7 or ldlA7-SRBI cells (data"

The bipartite targeting sequence of diatom nuclear-encoded plastid proteins contains an endoplasmic reticulum signal sequence and, based on sequence comparison, a transit peptide-like domain similar to that which targets proteins into the plastids of higher plants. By performing heterologous import experiments using the precursor of the γ subunit of the chloroplast ATPase from the diatom Odontella sinensis we were able to show that protein import into diatom plastids is at least a two-step event. We demonstrate that the first step involves co-translational transport through endoplasmic reticulum membranes and that there is an additional targeting step which is similar to the import of precursor proteins into chloroplasts of higher plants and green algae indicating that the transit peptide-like domain of the diatom precursor is functionally equivalent to the respective targeting signal of higher plants. Our results suggest that the transit peptide depending targeting mechanism in plastids has apparently remained relatively unchanged over the course of evolution, with only the peptidase cleavage site significantly modified.

Eukaryotic cells consist of a variety of different membrane bound compartments. The pathways for intracellular protein transport across these membranes has been the focus of considerable interest in recent years. In contrast to animal and fungal cells, plants have developed unique protein transport mechanisms for nuclear-encoded proteins which are imported into the chloroplasts.

Chloroplasts are thought to have originated by endosymbiotic uptake of a photosynthetic prokaryote, presumably a common ancestor to extant cyanobacteria, by a eukaryotic host. There was subsequent limited genetic degeneration of the endosymbiont, which included a massive transfer of genes into the nucleus of the host cell (5Whatley J.M. John P. Whatley F.R. Proc. Roy. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1979; 204: 165-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 6Palmer J.D. Nature. 1993; 364: 762-763Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 7Cavalier-Smith T. Arai R. Kato M. Doi Y. Biodiversity and Evolution. National Science Museum Foundation, Tokyo, Japan1995: 75-115Google Scholar). In land plants and green algae the transferred genes are transcribed in the nucleus, translated as precursors in the cytosol and post-translationally imported into the plastids (3Kermode A.R. Crit. Rev. Plant Sci. 1996; 15: 285-423Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The precursors differ from the mature proteins by N-terminal sequence extensions which are responsible for correct targeting and are removed by a plastid located peptidase after the import process (8Smeekens S. Bauerle C. Hagemann J. Keegstra K. Weisbeek P. Cell. 1986; 46: 365-375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 9Van der Vere P.S. Bennet T.M. Oblong J.E. Lamppa G.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7177-7181Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). These so-called transit peptides can be highly variable with respect to their amino acid sequence, but contain certain diagnostic features like an exceptionally high degree of hydroxylated amino acids, mainly serine and threonine. The precursors also contain the cleavage site of the transit peptide, which shows typical consensus motifs in land plants and in Chlamydomonas (10von Heijne G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1990; 2: 604-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 11Gavel Y. von Heijne G. FEBS Lett. 1990; 261: 455-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 12Franzén L.G.

While considerable insight has been gained into the protein import process into “typical” plastids from green algae and land plants, which have two envelope membranes, far less is known about groups of algae having additional membranes surrounding the plastid. Chromophytic algae possess plastids with four surrounding membranes. This feature is thought to reflect the evolution of these organisms by secondary endosymbiosis, i.e. by uptake of a photosynthetic eukaryote by a eukaryotic heterotrophic host cell (13Gibbs S.P. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1981; 361: 193-207Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Cavalier-Smith T. Round F.E. Chapman D.J. Progress in Phycological Research. Biopress, Bristol1986: 309-347Google Scholar). Strong evidence for the theory of secondary endosymbiosis comes from the finding of eukaryotic DNA between the two double membranes in cryptophytes, the so-called nucleomorph, which is thought to be the remnant of the nucleus of the endosymbiont (15Ludwig M. Gibbs S.P. Protoplasma. 1985; 127: 9-20Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 16McFadden G.I. Gilson P. Trends Ecol. Evol. 1995; 10: 12-17Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The final result is that the inner two membranes appear to correspond to the envelope membranes of higher plant plastids, the next membrane being the remnant of the endosymbiont′s plasma membrane, while the outermost membrane is continuous with the cellular endoplasmic reticulum. So far, only a few sequences of genes of nuclear-encoded plastid proteins of chromophytic algae have been published. All of those protein sequences show a bipartite presequence: an N-terminal domain with features of signal peptides for co-translational transport at ER1 membranes is followed by a second domain with structural similarities to transit peptides of green algae and higher plants (17Grossman A.R. Manadori A. Snyder D. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1990; 224: 91-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 18Pancic P.G. Strotmann H. FEBS Lett. 1993; 320: 61-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 19Kroth-Pancic P.G. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 27: 825-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 20Liaud M.-F. Brandt U. Scherzinger M. Cerff R. J. Mol. Evol. 1997; 44: 28-37Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this paper we report on experiments demonstrating that the first domain of the presequence of the γ subunit of the chloroplast ATPase from the diatom Odontella sinensis is necessary for co-translational import of pre-γ into canine microsomes, while the second domain enables the post-translational transport of the diatom preprotein into plastids from land plants. We were able to show thatin vitro the general plastid import features between higher plant and diatom precursors are comparable, while the respective stromal peptidase cleavage site might be significantly different. TheatpC gene was derived from a cDNA library of the diatomO. sinensis inserted as EcoRI, XhoI fragment in the vector λ ZAPII (18Pancic P.G. Strotmann H. FEBS Lett. 1993; 320: 61-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The atpC gene from spinach was kindly provided by Prof. R. G. Herrmann (Munich). All genes needed for in vitro translation were cloned into vectors SP72 and SP73 from Promega (Heidelberg) in such a way that the SP6 promotor could be utilized for transcription. PCR reactions were performed using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) or the Long-Expand kit (Boehringer, Mannheim) according to the manufacturer′s instructions. All mutations/modifications were verified by double-strand sequencing using the T7 sequencing kit from Pharmacia (Freiburg). Deletion of the signal sequence encoding domain of theOdontella atpC gene was achieved by PCR resulting in the “TOMO” clone (T = transit peptide, O = Odontella, M = mature protein). The forward primer was 5′-CTCGGATCCTGCTTTCATGGCGCAGCCCGCTGCCTTCACC-3′ (BamHI) and the reverse primer 5′-CACCATGTCGCATGCAACGC-3′ (SphI). For deletion of the signal peptide domain and the first 9 amino acids of the transit peptide domain of Odontella γ (ToMoΔ9) the forward primer 5′-CTCGGATCCAAAATGAGCCCCGCTGTCGGTGGTGCCACCAGC-3′ was employed. The PCR products were ligated into the originalatpC/Bluescript construct after cutting withBamHI and SphI and purifying vector DNA containing the partial atpC gene. The deletion of the transit domain of the presequence (construct SOMO) was achieved by full circle PCR and insertion of SalI restriction sites flanking the transit peptide (primers 5′-CGCGTCGACAGCAGCAGCGGAGGCGAG-3′ and 5′-GTGGTCGACGGAAAGGCCAATGCCATC-3′). After the PCR reaction the product was cut with SalI and ligated intramolecularly. To modify the transit domain processing site of the TOMO protein from IVM to IVC (TOMO-IVC) we cloned a MstI site into the encoding area of the processing site by full circle PCR (primers 5′-GCACACAATGGTGGCGCGGTTGCG-3′ and 5′-GCAGGAAAGGCCAATGCCATCCGT-3′). The result was an exchange of the amino acids methionine and aspartate at positions −1 and +1 by cysteine and alanine. The fusion proteins TOMSand TSMO (see Fig. 1 for description) were obtained by using the naturally occurring restriction sitesMstI and BstXI of the spinach atpCgene and the TOMO clone at the 5′ end of the transit domain ending regions. Fusing the transit peptide encoding fragment of the spinach atpC gene and the mature protein encoding fragment of TOMO-IVC of Odontella after digestion with MstI resulted in the TSMO protein. For constructing the TOMS protein we first inserted aBstXI site into the atpC gene of spinach with the primers 5′-TGCCATCACAATGGGGTTTGTTGGGGAGGGTGG-3′ and 5′-AACCCCATTGTGATGGCAAACCTCCGTGAGCTACGA-3′ by full circle PCR. After digestion of the resulting TSMS-IVM and the TOMO clone with BstXI and ScaI and ligation, the fusion clone TOMS was obtained. The protein TSMOMS contains 77 amino acids of the N terminus of the mature diatom γ subunit and was derived from the constructs encoding TSMO and the spinachatpC gene by exchanging the 5′-encoding sequence using theBstEII restriction site. The resulting chimeric spinach protein has the first 77 amino acids of the diatom mature protein instead of the first 81 amino acids of the mature spinach sequence. Chloroplasts were isolated from pea seedlings (grown for 8–12 days) or young spinach leaves based on a rapid isolation method for intact plastids (21Mills W.R. Joy K.W. Planta. 1980; 148: 75-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Pea or spinach leaves were homogenized in a Waring blender three times for 2 s, filtrated, and centrifuged for 1 min at 2,500 × g at 4 °C. Intact plastids were obtained after a second centrifugation for 2 min through a 40% Percoll cushion (2 mm EDTA, 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm MnCl2, 50 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.5, 0.33 m sorbitol, 40% Percoll) and washed twice in 50 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.5, 0.33m sorbitol. After import reaction the plastids were purified directly in 1.5-ml microtubes by additional centrifugation through a 40% Percoll cushion (15 s, 3,000 × g). Fractionation of the plastids was achieved by osmotic rupture in 10 mm Tricine, pH 7.5, for 10 min on ice and centrifugation for 30 s at 3,000 ×g. The supernatant, which contained the stromal proteins, was treated with one-fourth volume of 3 m trichloroacetic acid for 30 min on ice to precipitate the proteins. After resuspension in 0.1 m dithiothreitol, 0.1 mNa2CO3 the fraction was centrifuged for 10 min at 19,000 × g and was subsequently prepared for SDS-PAGE. DNA templates of the different atpCconstructs were transcribed and translated in a coupled reticulocyte transcription/translation system (TNT system, Promega, Heidelberg) using [35S]methionine (SJ1015 Amersham, Braunschweig). Co-translational import was obtained by adding canine pancreatic microsomes (Promega, Heidelberg) to the TNT expression reaction according to the manufacturer′s description. Different amounts of microsomes per translation reaction were tested, optimum conditions were achieved by adding about 6 units of microsomes to 25 μl of translation reaction, depending on the quality of the individual charge of microsomes. Not imported proteins were digested by the proteases thermolysin (25 μg/ml, 2 mm Ca2Cl), protease K (25 μg/ml), or trypsin (50 μg/ml) for 30 min on ice. For plastid import reactions according to Ref. 22Flügge U.I. Fischer K. Gross A. Sebald W. Lottspeich F. Eckerskorn C. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 39-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, radiolabeled translation reaction (maximum 2.5% of the final volume), 2 mm ATP, one-third volume of import buffer (750 mm sorbitol, 150 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 8, 30 mm methionine, 75 mm potassium gluconate, 6 mm MgCl2, and 0.6% bovine serum albumin) and isolated chloroplasts (75 μg of chlorophyll/400 μl) were used. The import reaction was performed for 25 min at 25 °C. After the translocation reaction external proteins were digested with thermolysin (50 μg/ml) after adding 2 mmCaCl2 (final concentration) for 30 min on ice as an option. The degradation was stopped with 2.5 mm EGTA (final concentration), followed by purifying the plastids by centrifugation through a Percoll cushion and an immediate denaturation step of the samples in sample buffer for 3 min at 90 °C. Samples were analyzed by 10 and 12% SDS-PAGE (23Fling S.P. Gregersen D.S. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 155: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). For visualization of radiolabeled bands the gels were fixed in 30% ethanol, 10% acetic acid and soaked in Amplify (Amersham, Braunschweig) before drying. For Western blots proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and signals were visualized by using the ECL system from Boehringer (Mannheim). Presequences of diatom nuclear-encoded plastid proteins have two distinct domains, which are structurally similar to signal peptides and transit peptides. The gene encoding the γ subunit of the chloroplast ATPase (atpC) (18Pancic P.G. Strotmann H. FEBS Lett. 1993; 320: 61-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) was utilized to demonstrate the specific function of these domains. A series of gene constructs were made, including the deletion of the signal peptide domain, the transit peptide domain or both, from the γ presequence of Odontella (proteins TOMO, SOMO, and MO, see Fig. 1 for nomenclature). Also a part of the transit peptide domain has been deleted (TOMOΔ9). Special care was taken to preserve the nucleotide positions around the ATG codon in order to maintain maximum translation efficiency according to the rules by Kozak (24Kozak M. Microbiol. Rev. 1983; 47: 1-45Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The diatom transit peptide domain was also fused with the mature γ subunit from spinach (TSMO) and vice versa (TOMS). Additionally the first 81 amino acids of the mature γ subunit from spinach were exchanged for the first 77 amino acids region from the diatom protein (TSMOMS). In vitro translation of the gene for the entire γ precursor of Odontella resulted in a protein with an apparent molecular mass of about 42 kDa as estimated by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2, lane Tr). When canine microsomal vesicles were present during the translation reaction an additional band of about 1.5 kDa smaller than the original protein was observed (Fig. 2, lane 1). After incubation of the microsomal vesicles with different proteases (proteinase K, trypsin, or thermolysin) the lower band remained intact, while the upper band was degraded (Fig. 2, lanes 2 and 3). This indicates that the γ preprotein has been imported into the microsomal vesicles and has been processed to a protein about 1.5 kDa smaller by cleavage of the signal peptide. The same results were obtained using theatpC gene from the diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum and the fcpA gene from O. sinensis (data not shown). The addition of Triton X-100 at a final concentration of 0.5% to the microsomes after the translation reaction and prior to addition of protease resulted in a total degradation of all synthesized proteins (Fig. 2, lane 5). To get a more precise estimation of the size of the imported protein we used a modified γ subunit protein as size standard. This protein (TOMO) did not contain the signal peptide domain and had a methionine one amino acid position away from the calculated signal peptidase processing site (Gln17 → Met). Fig. 2 (lane 4) shows that the size of this protein is very similar to the size of the pre-γ protein which had been imported and processed within the microsomes. Using 9 or 12% SDS gels there was no visible migration difference between these two bands. This clearly demonstrates that the processing of the γ precursor by the signal peptidase within the microsomal vesicles occurs at the position that had been calculated by the method of von Heijne (25von Heijne G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 4683-4690Crossref PubMed Scopus (3693) Google Scholar). Additional experiments showed that the γ TOMO precursor, which does not have a signal peptide, was not imported into the microsomes (data not shown), further indicating that the import reaction of pre-γ into the microsomes is specific and dependent on the signal peptide domain. So far there is no definitive proof that the transit peptide-like domain of chromophytic presequences indeed is related to higher plant transit peptides other than structural data. To test the functional similarity between the second domain of the diatom γ presequence and transit peptides of higher plants, the diatom γ precursor protein was post-translationally imported into isolated plastids of spinach and pea. After the import reactions plastids were incubated with the protease thermolysin and subsequently purified on Percoll cushions. To localize the imported proteins within the plastids they were broken osmotically and separated into thylakoid and stroma fractions (Fig. 3 A). The complete precursor as well as the different constructs described above were translatedin vitro and added to isolated pea plastids. Using the TOMO protein for the import reaction we obtained a new band of about 32 kDa on SDS-PAGE gels which was protease protected. This protein accumulated primarily in the stromal fraction indicating that the diatom γ protein was not incorporated into the pea chloroplast ATPase. Successful protein import was only observed for the TOMO protein. A very weak import was detectable using the complete γ precursor (Fig. 3 B). A deletion of the signal peptide domain together with 10 amino acids of the transit peptide domain did not result in a decreased import efficiency, while no import was observed after deletion of the transit peptide only (SOMO, Fig. 3 B) or the complete presequence (MO, not shown). This indicates that the transit peptide domain is responsible and necessary for import of the diatom preprotein into higher plant plastids. Generally, within the translation reactions we obtained additionally labeled proteins of lower molecular masses. These represent shorter proteins, which derive from internal translation initiation within the coding sequence of theatpC gene. This was clearly confirmed by comparison of the apparent molecular masses of these bands with calculated molecular masses of hypothetical proteins starting at the individual methionines within the γ sequence. For instance, translation starting from the second methionine of the γ precursor at position 55, directly at the cleavage site of the stromal peptidase in diatom plastids, results in a protein showing the same migration on SDS-PAGE gels as the mature γ protein isolated from diatom plastids (Fig. 5, lanes Tr and 2).Figure 5Comparison of the size of the diatom γ subunit imported into pea plastids with mature protein from diatom plastids.

The import reaction could be driven either by the addition of ATP or by illumination of the plastids (Fig. 4). Even in the absence of light or ATP very low import rates have been observed due to low amounts of ATP carried over from the ATP regenerating system of the translation reaction. A complete inhibition of the import reaction was observed after removal of the residual ATP by addition of glucose and hexokinase (Fig. 4, lane 5). Maximum import was achieved after an incubation period of 20 min (data not shown). The size of the imported γ protein within the pea plastids was approximately 3–4 kDa smaller than the size of the mature protein from diatom plastids (26Pancic P.G. Kowallik K.V. Strotmann H. Bot. Acta. 1990; 103: 274-280Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). This indicates that the protein was incorrectly processed by the stromal peptidase or degraded by another protease in the heterologous pea plastids. This size difference was also confirmed by running the imported protein and an extract of diatom plastid proteins on the same SDS-PAGE gel, followed by a Western blot using an antiserum against the γ subunit from Odontella (Fig. 5, lane 2). To exclude the possibility that the protein was degraded on the C-terminal end, theatpC gene was modified in such a way that 191 amino acids from the C-terminal of the γ preprotein had been deleted. Again the identical misprocessing event occurred (data not shown), indicating that the diatom γ protein within the pea plastids is cleaved somewhere in the N-terminal part of the mature protein. A comparison of the stromal peptidase cleavage sites of the few chromophytic sequences known so far and the consensus sequence of higher plants indicates several differences (Table I). All chromophytic nuclear-encoded plastid protein sequences analyzed to date have a methionine residue in position −1. One possible reason for the misprocessing may be that the pea stromal peptidase does not recognize the diatom cleavage site and cleaves somewhere else within the protein. A motif (VAAA), which matches the higher plant plastid peptidase consensus cleavage site ((I/V)-X-(A/C)↓X) is found about 30 amino acids from the start of the mature protein (positions 27 to 30 of the mature protein). On the other hand, it is also plausible that two processing steps may occur, one at the original cleavage site and another at the erroneous processing site. To distinguish between one or two cleavage steps, the stromal peptidase cleavage site of the γ precursor was modified to match the higher plant consensus by changing the methionine residue at position −1 in the Odontella γ cleavage site to a cysteine resulting in a IVC↓A motif. Import experiments with this construct revealed the similar import efficiencies as well as the same processing pattern as the TOMO protein (data not shown). This result indicates that the misprocessing of diatom pre-γ in pea plastids does not depend on whether there is a possibly functional cleavage site available or not. However, it cannot answer the question how many steps are involved in processing the diatom γ precursor in the pea plastids.Table ICleavage sites of stromal peptidases in chromophytes, green algae and higher plantsOrganismPreproteinCleavage site1-aFilled arrows, cleavage site determined by N-terminal sequencing; open arrows, putative cleavage site by similarity to homologous proteins.O. sinensis 1-bγ Subunit of chloroplast ATPase from Odontella(18).γI V M ⬇ DO. sinensis 1-cPhosphoribulokinase from Odontella (Weyrauch and Kroth, GenBank number Y08610).PRKL N M ⇓ AO. sinensis 1-dFucoxanthin-chlorophyll a/c-binding protein fromOdontella (19).FCPT N M ⇓ AP. tricornutum 1-eFucoxanthin-chlorophyll a/c-binding protein fromPhaeodactylum (31).FCPT N M ⬇ AMacrocystis pyrifera 1-fFucoxanthin-chlorophyll a/c-binding protein fromMacroycystis (47).FCPM K M ⇓ SPyrenomonas salina 1-gGlyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase fromPyrenomonas (20).GAPDH1-gGlyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase fromPyrenomonas (20).P V M ⇓ ALand plants1-hAccording to Ref. 11.ConsensusI/V X A/C ⬇ AChlamydomonas reinhardtii 1-iAccording to Ref. 12.ConsensusI/V X A ⬇ X1-a Filled arrows, cleavage site determined by N-terminal sequencing; open arrows, putative cleavage site by similarity to homologous proteins.1-b γ Subunit of chloroplast ATPase from Odontella(18Pancic P.G.

Open table in a new tab To elucidate whether the recognition site of the diatom γ presequence can be cleaved by the pea plastid protease, new constructs were made by using the gene for the γ TOMO protein and the gene for the γ-precursor of spinach (TSMS) and exchanging the regions encoding the transit peptides resulting in the preproteins TSMO and TOMS. Both constructs were translated in vitro and the gene products were added to isolated pea plastids. Fig. 6 shows that in the case of TSMO the protein again is misprocessed to 32 kDa. Therefore the recognition site for the misprocessing step must be within the mature part of the diatom protein. The TOMS protein also gets imported and the proteolytic processing leads to the expected size of 35 kDa, indicating that processing had occurred between transit peptide and mature protein. This confirms that the diatom transit peptide domain is capable of correctly targeting other proteins into pea plastids; it also confirms that the signal for misprocessing is not within the presequence of the diatom pre-γ. Additionally, since the TOMS protein was processed correctly, it shows that the diatom processing site for the stromal peptidase can be recognized and processed by the pea enzyme. This indicates that in the case of misprocessing of the TOMO protein two processing steps might occur. Further evidence for the localization of the erronous processing site was given by the construct TSMO/MS, in which the first 77 amino acids of the mature part of the spinach γ preprotein were substituted by the respective part of the Odontellasequence. After adding this preprotein to isolated pea plastids we again observed misprocessing of the precursor to 32 kDa, while the native spinach preprotein gets processed correctly to 35 kDa (Fig. 6). This demonstrates that the modified γ subunit from spinach acquired the signal for the processing step and that this signal must be within the first 77 amino acids of the mature diatom protein. Plastids of diatoms as well as other chlorophyll c-containing algae classified as the kingdom Chromista by Cavalier-Smith (14Cavalier-Smith T. Round F.E. Chapman D.J. Progress in Phycological Research. Biopress, Bristol1986: 309-347Google Scholar) are surrounded by two pairs of membranes. This complex membranous system must have been a challenge for the eukaryotic host cells harboring such plastids assuming that the extent of protein traffic into the diatom plastids is similar to chloroplasts of higher plants. It is unknown how those organisms manage to transport a variety of substances across four instead of two membranes and whether existing systems have been extended or new systems have been invented to fulfill this goal. One key to answer these questions are genes of plastid proteins that have been transferred to the nucleus of the host during evolution, since those genes are translated as preproteins and carry the targeting information for the correct transport pathway directly within their N-terminal presequences. In chromophytic algae ribosomes have been observed to be attached to the cytosolic side of the outermost plastid membrane, and the outer two membranes are continuous with the nuclear envelope and cytoplasmic ER; therefore the outer membranes have been referred to as “chloroplast” ER (27Gibbs S.P. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1981; 72: 49-99Crossref Scopus (115) Google Scholar). It has been proposed earlier that protein targeting into the plastids might involve a passage through rough ER membranes (28Gibbs S.P. J. Cell Sci. 1979; 35: 253-266PubMed Google Scholar). The first part of the N-terminal presequences indeed reveal striking similarities to signal peptides for co-translational transport through ER membranes (29von Heijne G. BioEssays. 1994; 17: 25-30Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar) like a positively charged lysine residue in position 2 followed by a very hydrophobic stretch of 10 to 15 amino acids. Cleavage sites for eukaryotic signal peptidases were usually predicted around positions 15–18 using the method of von Heijne (25von Heijne G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 4683-4690Crossref PubMed Scopus (3693) Google Scholar). Typical signal peptide characteristics are also found on the N-terminal presequence of diatom ER lumen proteins, such as the luminal binding protein (BiP) (30Apt K.E. Sukenik A. Grossman A.R. Plant Physiol. 1995; 109: 339Google Scholar). Investigations on FCP-preproteins of the diatom P. tricornutum (31Bhaya D. Grossman A.R. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1991; 229: 400-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) showed that the precursor was successfully imported into canine microsomes, indicating that transport through ER membranes might be the initial import step into diatom plastids. However, because of the very small second domain of the FCP presequence (about 15 amino acids) it was not clear whether the precursor had been processed to an intermediate or to the mature form of the protein, leaving the question open whether one or two steps might be involved in plastid targeting. For this reason we chose the γ subunit of chloroplast ATPase, since this protein has the longest transit peptide domain (40 amino acids) known so far in chromophytic preproteins. This study shows that the diatom pre-γ can be imported co-translationally in canine microsomes and is processed to an intermediate size protein of about the molecular mass expected from the location of the predicted signal peptidase cleavage site, therefore clearly indicating that the import pathway in chromophytic plastids consists of at least two steps. With respect to these results one would expect that other preproteins, such as FCP's, are also processed this way to an intermediate size after the co-translational transport, but contain a transit-peptide-like domain that is much shorter. The demonstrated ability of the transit peptide domain of the diatom pre-γ to facilitate the import of the γ subunits fromOdontella as well as from spinach into pea and spinach plastids confirms the functional similarity of this domain with the respective domain of higher plant plastids, indicating a phylogenetic relationship between the import machinery of those organisms. Chromophytic algae are thought to have evolved by endosymbiotical uptake of a red algal ancestor (32Cavalier-Smith T. Biol. J. Linn. Soc. 1982; 17: 289-306Crossref Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 33Reith M. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 46: 549-575Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar) based on comparative analyses of the plastid genomes of a red alga and a diatom (34Reith M. Munholland J. Plant Mol. Biol. Rep. 1995; 13: 333-335Crossref Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 35Kowallik K.V. Stoebe B. Schaffran I. Kroth-Pancic P.G. Freier U. Plant Mol. Biol. Rep. 1995; 13: 336-342Crossref Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Red algae have plastids with two surrounding membranes and it has been shown that the presequence of the nuclear-encoded plastid proteins from red algae are similar to higher plant transit peptides and are able to direct the import of proteins post-translationally into isolated pea plastids (36Apt K.E. Hoffman N.E. Grossman A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16208-16215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore it seems reasonable to assume that after secondary endosymbiosis, chromophytic algae have retained this protein import system and functionally connected it with a co-translational transport system via the ER system. Two other alga groups, which have evolved independently by secondary endosymbiosis (37McFadden G.I. Gilson P. Waller R.F. Arch. Protistenkd. 1995; 145: 231-239Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar), the euglenophytes and some dinoflagellates, have plastids with three surrounding membranes. Here also, the pathway of nucleus-encoded plastid proteins remains dubious. Presequences of nuclear-encoded plastid proteins of these organisms are also found to have a bipartite structure (38Kishore R. Muchhal U.S. Schwartzbach S.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11845-11849Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 39Shigemori Y. Inagaki J. Mori H. Nishimura M. Takahashi S. Yamamoto Y. Plant Mol.

ForEuglena there is evidence that precursor proteins might be translated at cytosolic ER membranes first and subsequently get transported to the plastids via the Golgi system (41Osafune T. Schiff J.A. Hase E. Exp. Cell Res. 1991; 193: 320-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 42Sulli C. Schwartzbach S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13084-13090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The general presence of N-terminal signal peptide domains in precursors of nucleus-encoded plastid proteins of cells with three- or four-membrane plastids indicates that after secondary endosymbiosis and subsequent transfer of the respective genes to the nucleus of the host cell, the pathway across the ER membranes was utilized to target proteins into the newly acquired plastids. According to Whatleyet al. (43Whatley J.M. John P. Whatley F.R. Proc. Roy. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1979; 204: 165-187Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) the outermost membrane of chromophytic plastids is a result of a fusion of the host ER membranes/nucleus membrane with the outermost membrane surrounding the endosymbiont. This process during evolution may have made it unnecessary for chromophytic algae to transport proteins through the cell via the ER/Golgi system, but to translate them directly at the surrounding membranes. It is difficult to understand how the two import steps we have characterized may explain the complete transfer of proteins across the four surrounding membranes, since neither process can account for the passage of proteins from the ER lumen through the second membrane and the eventual contact with the third membrane. One possible explanation might be that there are pores in one or two membranes which are large enough for larger proteins to pass. Another explanation might be a vesicular transport system. In a variety of chromophytic algae vesicular or reticular structures have been found by electron microscopy to be present between the second and third membrane (for review see Ref. 27Gibbs S.P. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1981; 72: 49-99Crossref Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Gibbs (28Gibbs S.P. J. Cell Sci. 1979; 35: 253-266PubMed Google Scholar) has previously proposed that those structures might be involved in substrate transport and possibly protein import. It is not known if there are any recognition sites for vesicular transport within the preprotein sequences. Such regions could be identified by deletion of domains within the presequence or the mature protein. Since in vitro systems with complex plastids are difficult to manipulate (44Wittpoth C. Kroth P.G. Weyrauch K. Kowallik K.V. Strotmann H. Planta. 1998; 206: 79-85Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar) future work must include in vivo experiments, using the newly developed techniques for genetic transformation of diatoms (45Dunahay T.G.

https://openalex.org/W2079281555,"The complex of the translocase mitochondrial outer membrane (TOM), mediates recognition, unfolding, and translocation of preproteins. We have used a combination of biochemical and electrophysiological methods to study the properties of the preprotein-conducting pore of the purified TOM complex. The pore is cation-selective and voltage-gated. It shows three main conductance levels with characteristic slow and fast kinetics transitions to states of lower conductance following application of transmembrane voltages. These electrical properties distinguish it from the mitochondrial voltage-dependent anion channel (porin) and are identical to those of the previously described peptide-sensitive channel. Binding of antibodies to the C terminus of Tom40 on the intermembrane space side of the outer membrane modifies the channel properties and allows determination of the orientation of the channel within the lipid bilayer. Mitochondrial presequence peptides specifically interact with the pore and decrease the ion flow through the channel in a voltage-dependent manner. We propose that the presequence-induced closures of the pore are related to structural alterations of the TOM complex observed during the various stages of preprotein movement across the mitochondrial outer membrane."

Proteases of the caspase family are regarded as important physiological signal transducers and executioners of apoptosis induced by a variety of exogeneous stimuli (1Nagata S. Cell. 1997; 88: 355-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4536) Google Scholar). Apoptotic signals emanating from TNF1 receptor type 1 (p55–60) are linked via receptor-associated, death domain-containing adaptor proteins to Flice/Mach (caspase 8) as the receptor proximal protease and presumed initiator of a caspase cascade. TNF-mediated cellular activation also encompasses the generation of lipid second messengers, one of which, ceramide, potentially acts as lipid anchor and has been implicated as an important mediator of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (2Hannun Y.A. Science. 1996; 274: 1855-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1487) Google Scholar, 3Krönke M. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1997; 8: 103-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 4Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M.

A functional linkage between these two pathways at multiple levels is emerging. Thus, a role of ceramide in the activation of caspase 3 (CPP32) has been proposed (1Nagata S. Cell. 1997; 88: 355-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4536) Google Scholar, 6Mizushima N. Koike R. Kohsaka H. Kushi Y. Handa S. Yagita H. Miyasaka N. FEBS Lett. 1996; 395: 267-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). More recently, ceramide generation has been placed downstream of Crm-A and Z-VAD-fmk-sensitive caspases, suggestive of a caspase-dependent regulation of intracellular ceramide levels (7Dbaibo G.S. Perry D.K. Gamard C.J. Platt R. Poirier G.G. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 481-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 8Pronk G.J. Ramer K. Amiri P. Williams L.T. Science. 1996; 271: 808-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). The potential relationship between caspases and the various enzymes involved in ceramide generation or metabolism and the respective role of the latter during TNF-induced apoptosis is presently unknown. This is in part related to the fact that, with the exception of acidic and neutral sphingomyelinases (aSMase and nSMase, respectively) (9Schuchman E.H. Suchi M. Takahashi T. Sandhoff K. Desnick R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8531-8539Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Tomiuk S. Hofmann K. Nix N. Zumbansion M. Stoffel W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3638-3643Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), the cellular enzymes regulating ceramide levels are not yet molecularly defined. Moreover, they are located in different cellular compartments (11Liu P. Anderson R.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27179-27185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 12Jeckel D. Karrenbauer A. Burger K.N. van Meer G. Wieland F. J.

This may not only influence their accessibility by upstream regulators, e.g. caspases, but also has implications for potential immediate targets of locally produced, compartmentalized ceramide. Indeed, the existence of distinct signal-transducing pools of sphingomyelin was recently suggested (15Zhang P. Liu B. Jenkins G.M. Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9609-9612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar).Here, we have investigated the contribution of different ceramide-generating and -metabolizing enzymes to intracellular ceramide levels, their kinetics of activation, and caspase dependence in a cellular model of TNF-induced apoptosis that is independent of metabolic inhibitors such as cycloheximide or actinomycin D. The cell line studied, Kym-1, is an anchorage-dependent human rhabdomyosarcoma cell line highly sensitive to TNF but resistant to Fas/Apo-1-induced apoptosis (16Grell M. Zimmerman G. Hülser D. Pfizenmaier K. Scheurich P. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 1963-1972PubMed Google Scholar, 17Grell M. Krammer P.H. Scheurich P. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 2563-2566Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). We present evidence that two important enzymes regulating intracellular concentrations of ceramide, glucosylceramide (GlcCer) and sphingomyelin (SM) synthase, are under control of TNF-induced caspase(s), thus representing a merging point where different proapoptotic signals emanating from TNF receptor type 1, the lipid messenger ceramide, and TNF-induced caspases, converge.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONWhen Kym-1 cells were treated with TNF, a multiphasic increase in intracellular ceramide levels was discerned. Two min after onset of TNF stimulation, a first increase in ceramide (140% of control) (Fig. 1 A ) was due to rapid but transient (<60 s) activation of neutral sphingomyelinase (Fig. 1 B). In contrast to hematopoietic cells (14Wiegmann K. Schütze S. Machleidt T. Witte D. Krönke M. Cell. 1994; 78: 1005-1015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar), no aSMase activity could be detected in Kym-1 cells growing attached in monolayers within 2 h of TNF treatment. Interestingly, the rapid rise in ceramide levels (Fig. 1 A) was paralleled by a simultaneous inhibition of GlcCer and SM synthase (Fig. 1 C), determined from membrane fractions of TNF-treated cells and NBD-C6-ceramide as substrate (12Jeckel D. Karrenbauer A. Burger K.N. van Meer G. Wieland F. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 259-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). This finding contrasts to metabolic activity of untreated cells, where a rise in the intracellular ceramide concentration immediately leads to increase in GlcCer and SM synthase activity (18Futerman A.H. Stieger B. Hubbard A.L. Pagano R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8650-8657Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Merrill A.H. van Echten G. Wang E. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27299-27306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, GlcCer and SM synthase appear to be important TNF-regulated enzymes to control the duration of the ceramide signal. The subsequent ceramide elevation of greater than 300% of control after 40 min of TNF stimulation (Fig. 1 D) was correlated with a transient increase in ceramide synthase activity, as revealed from conversion of the precursor [3H]sphingosine (Fig. 1 E) and the absence of this ceramide peak in the presence of the ceramide synthase inhibitor fumonisin. In parallel to the second ceramide wave, GlcCer and SM synthase activity transiently increased, reaching maxima of ∼230 and 130% that of control, respectively (Fig. 1 F). The substantial increase in intracellular ceramide for at least 1 h due to concomitant de novo synthesis suggests that ceramide could exert a rather persistent second messenger function during this period. After 3 h of TNF stimulation, a third, again transient peak of ceramide generation was observed in Kym-1 cells (Fig. 1 G). This late ceramide peak was caused by aSMase activation (Fig. 1 H). Neither nSMase nor ceramide synthase was found to be activated at this time point (data not shown). It is noteworthy that the onset of the third ceramide peak in Kym-1 cells correlated with beginning loss of focal contacts, rounding, and sequential detachment of the cells, as revealed by microscopic examination. Indeed, after loosing focal contacts, detached cells clearly induce acidic SMase;in vitro TNF stimulation of Kym-1 cells experimentally detached by EDTA before TNF treatment resulted in rapid activation of aSMase with peak activity of 300% control (Fig. 1 I). Loss of cell-cell contacts appears an important prerequisite for induction of apoptosis in tissues, a mechanism that has been termed anoikis (20Frisch M. Ruoslahti E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 701-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar).For cells undergoing apoptosis, caspases have been proposed as the upstream regulators of ceramide generation (7Dbaibo G.S. Perry D.K. Gamard C.J. Platt R. Poirier G.G. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 481-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 8Pronk G.J. Ramer K. Amiri P. Williams L.T. Science. 1996; 271: 808-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), but the lipid enzymes potentially targeted by caspases have not been identified. In Kym-1 cells, the addition of either Z-VAD-fmk, a broad spectrum inhibitor of caspases, or Z-DEVD -cmk, a selective caspase 3 inhibitor, both of which block TNF-induced apoptosis (Fig. 2 A and data not shown), completely abolished the TNF-induced third increase in intracellular ceramide (Fig. 2 B). However, apoptosis of Kym-1 cells induced by exogeneous ceramide could not be blocked by Z-VAD-fmk (Fig. 2 A, inset), indicating an action of ceramide downstream of Z-VAD-fmk-sensitive caspases. This is in contrast to a recent study with a T cell line, where ceramide-induced apoptosis apparently was an indirect, Fas/FasL-mediated event sensitive to the caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk (21Herr I. Wilhelm D. Böhler P. Angel P. Debatim K.-M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6200-6208Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). An immediate role of ceramide in the apoptotic process of Kym-1 cells rather than an induction of the Fas/FasL pathway is strengthened by previous data showing that these cells are fully resistant to Fas-induced apoptosis (17Grell M. Krammer P.H. Scheurich P. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 2563-2566Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This suggests that ceramide may serve multiple functions in apoptotic pathways that, depending on the cellular context, can be indirect (21Herr I. Wilhelm D. Böhler P. Angel P. Debatim K.-M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6200-6208Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) or direct, as shown here for Kym-1 cells.Figure 2A, inhibition of TNF-induced cytotoxicity by caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk but not by fumonisin B1.

To evaluate the intracellular ceramide levels, lipid extracts (31Bligh V. Dyer W.J. Can. Biochem. J.

Microsomal membranes were prepared, and the sphingomyelin synthase assay was performed as described in Liu and Anderson (11Liu P. Anderson R.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27179-27185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar) and Jeckel et al. (12Jeckel D. Karrenbauer A. Burger K.N. van Meer G. Wieland F. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 259-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). After lipid extraction and TLC, the separated lipids were quantified by a PhosphoImager. The data shown in Fig. 2, A–C, are the mean ±S.D. of triplicate determinations of one of three independent experiments, with similar results for each assay.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)With respect to the contribution of ceramide generated at different times by different enzymes to the apoptotic process, our data suggest that the very early nSMase-dependent and the ceramide synthase-dependent intermediate ceramide accumulation are likely not to be involved in processes of the apoptotic program, causing irreversible damage. This reasoning is based on the findings that i) Z-VAD-fmk still inhibited TNF-induced apoptosis even when added up to 2 h after TNF (Fig. 2 A), just before the beginning detachment of cells and the third rise in ceramide; 2 h later, chromatin condensation was apparent by 4′-6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride staining in greater than 80% of the cells, and Z-VAD-fmk was ineffective at this time point (data not shown); ii) fumonisin effectively inhibited TNF-induced ceramide synthase activity, responsible for the second ceramide peak, but even at high concentrations (25 μm) failed to inhibit TNF-induced apoptosis (Fig. 2 A); this transient ceramide synthase activity in Kym-1 cells thus apparently plays a functionally different role compared with continuous ceramide synthase stimulation, which, in a different experimental setting, was previously reported to lead to apoptosis (22Bose R.

Cell. 1996; 86: 937-949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar).It was noted in TNF-treated Kym-1 cells that the rapid accumulation of ceramide was paralleled by an inhibition of GlcCer and SM synthase activity (Fig. 1 C), followed by an increased activity of the enzymes for approximately 1 h (Fig. 1 F). Cells treated for 3 h with TNF again showed a reduced GlcCer and SM synthase activity compared with untreated cells (Fig. 2 C). Interestingly, at this time point, the caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk rendered TNF-treated cells fully resistant to down-regulation of GlcCer and SM synthase activity (Fig. 2 C). This suggests that GlcCer and SM synthase are targets in TNF-induced apoptotic pathways that are either directly or indirectly controlled by Z-VAD-fmk-sensitive caspase(s).To further investigate which of the caspases might be involved in GlcCer and SM synthase activity control, the activation of caspase 3, previously suggested to be a direct target of ceramide (1Nagata S.

The kinetics of activation (Fig. 3 B) paralleled the late accumulation of ceramide, with a peak of the latter approximately 3 h after the onset of TNF treatment. Z-DEVD-cmk, a selective inhibitor of caspase 3, abolished the TNF-induced third ceramide peak (Fig. 2 B). Exogenous ceramide had no influence on PARP cleavage (Fig. 3 A) and did not activate caspase 3 during 4 h, although the nuclear contents of more than 60% of the cells were already encapsulated into “apoptotic bodies” after 4 h, as revealed by 4′-6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride staining (data not shown). These results indicate that ceramide is not an activating messenger of caspase 3.Figure 3Activation of caspase 3 by TNF detected by PARP and peptide cleavage. A, 4 × 106Kym-1 cells were incubated with TNF (10 ng/ml) or C6-ceramide (50 μm). Cell lysates were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis blotted onto nitrocellulose, and PARP was immunodetected by a rabbit polyclonal antiserum (Upstate).

A recent study further suggested a similar role of SM synthase for exogeneous ceramide (25Luberto C. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14550-14559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). As the vast majority of exogeneous ceramide is converted into glucosylceramide rather than sphingomyelin (Ref. 26Pütz U. Schwarzmann G. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 68: 113-121PubMed Google Scholar and data not shown), we investigated the fate of apoptotic (50 μm) and non-apoptotic (5 μm) doses of NBD-C6-ceramide by determining its intracellular concentrations and conversion to glucosylceramide in Kym-1 cells. As with C6-ceramide, the fluorescently labeled derivative NBD-C6-ceramide induced apoptosis at an exogeneous concentration of 50 μm, whereas 5 μmNBD-C6-ceramide had no effect (Fig. 4 A). In the presence of 5 μm NBD-C6-ceramide, a steady state intracellular level of 30 pmol/106 Kym-1 cells was reached after 2 h (Fig. 4 B). More relevant, the glucosylceramide/ceramide ratio was steadily increasing, indicating that GlcCer synthase is active and can fully compensate this stimulus (Fig. 4 C). In the presence of 50 μm exogeneous ceramide, the intracellular ceramide level was continuously increasing, reaching about 90 pmol/106 cells after 4 h (Fig. 4 B). Of note is that the glucosylceramide/ceramide ratio drops drastically after 6 h (Fig. 4 C), indicative of a pronounced reduction of GlcCer synthase activity, probably by substrate inhibition. Such a mechanism cannot be overcome by caspase inhibitors, explaining why apoptosis induced by high concentrations of exogeneous ceramide proceeds in the presence of Z-VAD-fmk (Fig. 2 A).Figure 4A, titration of NBD-C6-ceramide-induced cytotoxicity. The cells were treated for 12 h with the indicated concentrations of NBD-C6-ceramide (Molecular Probes), and cell viability was determined as described in Bligh and Dyer (31Bligh V. Dyer W.J. Can.

Cells were incubated with NBD-C6-ceramide, washed as described under “Materials and Methods,” and incubated for the indicated time.

Pagano R.E. Science. 1985; 228: 745-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Only recently it has been demonstrated that labeling of the Golgi by short chain fluorescent ceramide analogues requires their metabolism to GlcCer or SM. The fluorescent NBD-C6-ceramide, but not its nonmetabolizable analogue 1-O-methyl-NBD-C6-ceramide, is metabolically converted to GlcCer and to a minor extent to SM (26Pütz U. Schwarzmann G. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 68: 113-121PubMed Google Scholar). Kym-1 cells show a very fast uptake of NBD-C6-ceramide. Within minutes, NBD-C6-ceramide was accumulated in a perinuclear space and in Golgi structures (Fig. 5 A), in contrast to 1-O-methyl-NBD-C6-ceramide, which was only diffusely distributed in the cell (Fig. 5 C), although both compounds were taken up in equal amounts (Fig. 6). Upon further incubation for 2 h, only NBD-C6-ceramide was distributed in vesicular structures (Fig. 5 B), at which time it was to a large extent metabolized to glucosylceramide (Fig. 6). 1-O-Methyl-NBD-C6-ceramide remained diffusely distributed in the cells (Fig. 5 D), indicating that metabolization to glucosylceramide is a prerequisite for localization of the label in Golgi and vesicular structures, thus localizing metabolic conversion of ceramide to intracellular vesicular, trans-Golgi and/or endosomal compartments.Figure 5Intracellular localization of NBD-C6-ceramide and 1-O-methyl-NBD-C6-ceramide. 5 × 104 Kym-1 cells were incubated with 5 μmNBD-C6-ceramide (A and B) or 5 μm 1-O-methyl-NBD-C6-ceramide (C and D) for 1 min (A and C) at room temperature, washed twice, and immediately fixed with 3.5% paraformaldehyde or were further incubated after washing for additional 2 h and then fixed (B and D).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 6Metabolism of NBD-C6-ceramide in Kym-1 cells.

These parameters include time point of appearance and duration of local intracellular concentrations of ceramide. For example, the ceramide level transiently reached upon TNF activation of ceramide synthase is similar to the concentrations accumulating upon incubation with 50 μm exogeneous ceramide, yet only the latter induces apoptosis, probably because of sustained inhibition of GlcCer and SM synthase. Compartmentation of the ceramide-generating enzymes could be of similar importance. Indeed, evidence for the existence of distinct intracellular pools of the ceramide precursor sphingomyelin and their differential involvement in apoptosis has recently been obtained (15Zhang P. Liu B. Jenkins G.M. Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9609-9612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Together, these data support our hypothesis that intracellular location and time point of accumulation largely determine the apoptotic signal/effector capacity of ceramide. Proteases of the caspase family are regarded as important physiological signal transducers and executioners of apoptosis induced by a variety of exogeneous stimuli (1Nagata S. Cell. 1997; 88: 355-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4536) Google Scholar). Apoptotic signals emanating from TNF1 receptor type 1 (p55–60) are linked via receptor-associated, death domain-containing adaptor proteins to Flice/Mach (caspase 8) as the receptor proximal protease and presumed initiator of a caspase cascade. TNF-mediated cellular activation also encompasses the generation of lipid second messengers, one of which, ceramide, potentially acts as lipid anchor and has been implicated as an important mediator of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (2Hannun Y.A. Science. 1996; 274: 1855-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1487) Google Scholar, 3Krönke M. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1997; 8: 103-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 4Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M.

A functional linkage between these two pathways at multiple levels is emerging. Thus, a role of ceramide in the activation of caspase 3 (CPP32) has been proposed (1Nagata S. Cell. 1997; 88: 355-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4536) Google Scholar, 6Mizushima N. Koike R. Kohsaka H. Kushi Y. Handa S. Yagita H. Miyasaka N. FEBS Lett. 1996; 395: 267-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). More recently, ceramide generation has been placed downstream of Crm-A and Z-VAD-fmk-sensitive caspases, suggestive of a caspase-dependent regulation of intracellular ceramide levels (7Dbaibo G.S.

The potential relationship between caspases and the various enzymes involved in ceramide generation or metabolism and the respective role of the latter during TNF-induced apoptosis is presently unknown. This is in part related to the fact that, with the exception of acidic and neutral sphingomyelinase"
https://openalex.org/W2062954853,"We have recently demonstrated that signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) 1, 3, 5A, 5B, and 6 are expressed in both cultured and native adipocytes. Our current studies have focused on the activation of STATs 1 and 3 by leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), oncostatin-M (OSM), and interferon-γ (IFNγ) in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. IFNγ is shown to be a potent activator of STAT 1 as indicated by both tyrosine phosphorylation and nuclear translocation. However, LIF and OSM, which are potent inducers of STAT 3, are less potent activators of STAT 1 as measured by both tyrosine phosphorylation and nuclear translocation. Both STATs 1 and 3 were translocated to the nucleus in a time-dependent fashion following LIF treatment. In addition, IFNγ resulted in a time- and dose-dependent effect on STATs 1 and 3 nuclear translocation. Growth hormone, a potent activator of STATs 5A and 5B, had a minimal effect on STAT 1 and STAT 3 tyrosine phosphorylation. Preincubation with either insulin or growth hormone had no detectable effects on the tyrosine phosphorylation or nuclear translocation of STATs 1 and 3 induced by LIF, OSM, or IFNγ. The effects of LIF and IFNγ on STAT 1 and 3 tyrosine phosphorylation and nuclear translocation were confirmed in native rat adipocytes. In 3T3-L1 adipocytes, a low level of serine phosphorylation of STAT 3 on residue 727 was observed and was markedly enhanced by insulin, LIF, or OSM. This increase in STAT 3 Ser727 phosphorylation was dependent upon the activation of MAPK, since the MAPK kinase inhibitor (PD98059) reduced STAT 3 Ser727 phosphorylation to basal levels. The inhibition of MAPK had no effect on the ability of STATs 1 and 3 to be tyrosine-phosphorylated or translocate to the nucleus. These studies demonstrate the highly specific and quantitative activation of STATs 1 and 3 by LIF, OSM, and IFNγ in adipocytes and indicate that STAT 3 is a substrate for MAPK in adipocytes.

The signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)1 family of transcription factors is composed of seven family members (STATs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5A, 5B, and 6) that, in response to stimulation of various receptors, mainly those for cytokines, are phosphorylated on tyrosine residues, which causes their translocation to the nucleus. Each STAT family member shows a distinct pattern of activation by cytokines and upon nuclear translocation can regulate the transcription of particular genes (1Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3399) Google Scholar). The order of events for STAT activation can be briefly described as follows: 1) ligand binding of cell surface receptor; 2) receptor association with a Janus kinase family member; 3) Janus kinase tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT proteins; 4) dimerization of the STATs; 5) translocation to the nucleus; and 6) DNA binding. STATs have been shown to bind at least three different DNA consensus sequences, and this binding regulates the transcription of specific genes (1Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3399) Google Scholar, 2Pellegrini S. Dusanter-Fourt I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 615-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). It has also been demonstrated that STATs can be activated independently of Janus kinases (1Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3399) Google Scholar, 3Leaman D.W. Pisharody S. Flickinger T.W. Commane M.A. Schlessinger J. Kerr I.M. Levy D.E. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 369-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) and that serine phosphorylation may also contribute to the ability of STATs to regulate transcription (4Wen Z. Zhong Z. Darnell J.E. Cell. 1995; 82: 241-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1751) Google Scholar,5Beadling C. Ng J. Babbage J.W. Cantrell D.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1902-1913Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Many recent studies suggest that the activation of particular STAT proteins may vary depending upon the cell type (1Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3399) Google Scholar). Moreover, the tissue distribution of each STAT is unique, suggesting that the regulation of tissue-specific gene expression may be a physiological role for these proteins. This is supported by numerous reports that demonstrate that particular STATs are activated differently in response to growth factors and cytokines depending upon the cell type. Transgenic knockout experiments have revealed crucial roles for each known mammalian STAT (1Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3399) Google Scholar), and cell-specific functions for STAT family members have been identified. To date, the activation of STAT proteins in adipocytes has not been extensively investigated. Oncostatin-M (OSM) and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) are recently identified cytokines that share many structural and genetic features and are both mediators of pleiotropic biological activities (6Rose T.M. Bruce A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8641-8645Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar).

Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 141-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Interferon-γ (IFNγ), which is primarily known for its roles in immunological responses, has also been shown to have potent effects on adipocyte gene expression (17Doerrler W. Feingold K.R. Grunfeld C. Cytokine. 1994; 6: 478-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) and inhibit the differentiation of cultured rodent preadipocytes (18Gregoire F. De Broux N. Hauser N. Heremans H.

For example, IFNγ activates STAT 1 but not STAT 3 in some cell types (19Schindler C. Fu X.-Y. Improta T. Aebersold R. Darnell Jr., J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In our studies, we have identified LIF, OSM, and IFNγ as inducers of STAT 1 and 3 tyrosine phosphorylation and nuclear translocation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Highly specific and time-dependent activation of STATs 1 and 3 by LIF and IFNγ was observed. Pretreatment of adipocytes with either growth hormone or insulin had no effect on the ability of LIF, OSM, and IFNγ to result in STAT 1 and 3 tyrosine phosphorylation or nuclear translocation. We have also demonstrated that a critical serine residue in STAT 3, serine 727, is phosphorylated to a small extent in unstimulated serum-deprived 3T3-L1 adipocytes. LIF and OSM, which are known activators of the p42/44 mitogen activated protein kinase/extracellular regulated kinase (MAPK) (22Thoma B. Bird T.A. Friend D.J. Gearing D.P. Dower S.K. J. Biol.

Murine 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were plated and grown to 2 days postconfluence in DMEM with 10% bovine serum. Medium was changed every 48 h. Cells were induced to differentiate by changing the medium to DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 0.5 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, 1 μmdexamethasone, and 1.7 μm insulin. After 48 h, this medium was replaced with DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, and cells were maintained in this medium until utilized for experimentation. Prior to experimentation, cells were serum-deprived in DMEM containing 0.2% fatty acid-free and growth factor-depleted bovine serum albumin (Sigma) for 12 h as we have previously described (24Balhoff J.P.

Supernatants containing whole cell extracts were analyzed for protein content using a BCA kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Serum-deprived 3T3-L1 adipocytes were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and then harvested in a nuclear homogenization buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 10 mm NaCl, and 3 mm MgCl2. Nonidet P-40 was added to a final concentration of 0.15%, and cells were homogenized with 16 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer. The homogenates were centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 5 min. Supernatants were saved as cytosolic extract, and the nuclear pellets were resuspended in ½ volume of nuclear homogenization buffer and were centrifuged as before. The pellet of intact nuclei was resuspended again in ½ of the original volume of nuclear homogenization buffer and centrifuged again. A small portion of the nuclei was used for trypan blue staining to examine the integrity of the nuclei. The majority of the pellet (intact nuclei) was resuspended in an extraction buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, and 25% glycerol. Nuclei were extracted for 30 min on ice and then placed at room temperature for 10 min. Two hundred units of DNase I was added to each sample, and tubes were inverted and incubated for an additional 10 min at room temperature. Finally, the sample was subjected to centrifugation at 15,000 rpm at 4 °C for 30 min. Supernatants containing nuclear extracts were analyzed for protein content. Adipocytes were isolated from the epididymal fat pads of male Sprague-Dawley rats (150–175 g) by collagenase digestion as described (25Rodbell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 375-380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Whole cell extracts were prepared using the nondenaturing buffer listed above. Cell fractionation was performed by homogenizing native adipocytes in nuclear homogenization buffer. Following homogenization, cytosolic and nuclear extracts were prepared from native adipocytes in an identical fashion to the procedure described above for the 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Proteins were separated in 7.5 or 12% polyacrylamide (acrylamide from National Diagnostics) gels containing SDS according to Laemmli (26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207472) Google Scholar) and transferred to nitrocellulose (Bio-Rad) in 25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, and 20% methanol. Following transfer, the membrane was blocked in 4% milk for 1 h at room temperature. Results were visualized with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Sigma) and enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). The phosphorylation of STATs 1 and 3 by known activators of these proteins was investigated by treating serum-deprived 3T3-L1 adipocytes with a variety of growth factors and cytokines and examining tyrosine phosphorylation and nuclear translocation. Detection of the phosphorylated forms of STATs 1 and 3 was performed with antibodies specific for the tyrosine-phosphorylated sites of these proteins on tyrosine 701 (STAT 1 Tyr701) and tyrosine 705 (STAT 3 Tyr705). The specificity of these antibodies was verified by first immunoprecipitating the proteins from serum-deprived 3T3-L1 adipocytes with antibodies directed to alternate sites and immunoblotting with the phosphorylation state-specific antibody (data not shown). Whole cell, cytosolic, and nuclear extracts were analyzed from 3T3-L1 adipocytes that were treated for 15 min with IFNγ, LIF, PDGF, EGF, GH, GM-CSF, IL-6, IL-4, or insulin-like growth factor I. Immunoblotting of whole cell extracts (Fig. 1 A) demonstrates that STAT 1 Tyr701 phosphorylation occurs after acute treatment with either IFNγ or LIF as indicated by blotting with the specific STAT 1 Tyr701 polyclonal antibody (STAT 1 p-tyr). The phosphorylation of STAT 3 Tyr705 was most potently stimulated by LIF and to a lesser extent by IFNγ treatment. However, acute exposure to PDGF, GH, IL-6, and IL-4 also resulted in detectable, albeit lower, levels of STAT 3 Tyr705 phosphorylation (STAT 3 p-tyr). Interestingly, EGF, a potent activator of STATs 1 and 3 in other cell types, had no effect on STAT 1 Tyr701 or STAT 3 Tyr705 phosphorylation in serum-deprived 3T3-L1 adipocytes. The efficacy of EGF was confirmed by examining the activation of ERK1/2 in the presence of EGF utilizing a commercially available, dual phosphospecific ERK1/2 antibody (Fig. 1 A). Antibodies were also used to confirm the consistent protein concentrations of STATs 1 and 3 and ERK1/2 during immunoblotting (Fig. 1 A). In the experiment described above, cytosolic and nuclear extracts were also isolated from identically treated cells to compare the tyrosine phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of STATs 1 and 3 with the tyrosine phosphorylation we observed in whole cell extracts. As expected, both LIF and IFNγ resulted in the nuclear translocation of STAT 1 and the detection of Tyr701-phosphorylated STAT 1 in nuclear extracts (Fig. 1 B). However, not all of the activators of STAT 3 Tyr705 phosphorylation resulted in detectable nuclear translocation of STAT 3 (Fig. 1 B). Thebottom two parts of Fig. 1 Bindicate that LIF and, to a lesser extent, IFNγ resulted in the Tyr705 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of STAT 3. Prolonged exposures of these STAT 3 immunoblots indicated the presence of STAT 3 in the nucleus following LIF and IFNγ stimulation and to a much lesser extent by GH stimulation (data not shown). Yet, there was no detectable STAT 3 in the nucleus following stimulation by PDGF, EGF, IL-4, GM-CSF, IL-6 or insulin-like growth factor I using antibodies directed against either non-phospho-STAT 3 or STAT 3 Tyr705polyclonal antibody. Therefore, we have focused our studies on the prominent activation of STATs 1 and 3 by LIF and IFNγ. To further clarify the specific activation of STATs 1 and 3 by IFNγ, a dose- and time-dependent analysis of nuclear translocation of adipocyte-expressed STATs was performed. Serum-deprived 3T3-L1 adipocytes were treated for 15 min with eight different doses of IFNγ (0–1000 units/ml). Cells were harvested as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and cytosolic and nuclear extracts were examined for the presence of STAT family members by Western blot analysis. As indicated in Fig. 2 A, acute IFNγ treatment resulted in a dose-dependent translocation of STATs 1 and 3 to the nucleus. However, IFNγ had no effect on STATs 5A, 5B, or 6 as indicated by the absence of these proteins from the nucleus. In addition, adipocytes were treated with 100 units/ml IFNγ for various times, and the presence of STATs 1 and 3 in the nucleus was examined. As expected, the translocation of STATs 1 and 3 occurred between 3 and 15 min following IFNγ stimulation (Fig. 2 B). The presence of these proteins in the nucleus was sustained for 90 min, with no detectable STAT proteins present in the nucleus after 120 min. The specific activation of STATs 1 and 3 by LIF was also investigated by examining tyrosine phosphorylation and nuclear translocation. Serum-deprived 3T3-L1 adipocytes were treated with LIF for various periods and then fractionated into cytosolic and nuclear extracts. As indicated by immunoblotting extracts with STAT 1 Tyr701polyclonal antibody and STAT 3 Tyr705 polyclonal antibody in Fig. 1, treatment with LIF resulted in the phosphorylation of both STAT 1 Tyr701 and STAT 3 Tyr705. As demonstrated in the nuclear extract samples in the top three panels of Fig. 3, the STAT 1 Tyr701polyclonal antibody is more sensitive than the non-phospho-STAT 1 antibody. However, analysis with either one of these antibodies demonstrates that the presence of STAT 1 in the nucleus is maximal following a 15-min LIF stimulation. Following a 5-min treatment with LIF, there was a marked detection of phosphorylated STATs 1 and 3 in the cytosol (Fig. 3). Notably, there was a concomitant loss of phosphorylated STATs 1 and 3 in the cytosol with the appearance of phosphorylated STATs 1 and 3 in the nucleus. A rapid phosphorylation of STAT 3 Tyr705 is shown in the two STAT 3 panels of Fig. 3, with maximal accumulation in the nucleus following a 15–30-min LIF treatment. We have previously reported that STAT 5A is present in the nucleus of adipocytes under basal conditions (24Balhoff J.P. Stephens J.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 247: 894-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), but LIF treatment does not result in changes in the amount of this protein in the nucleus (Fig. 3). Finally, neither STAT 5B nor STAT 6 protein was detectable in the nucleus following LIF treatment (Fig. 3). The activation of STATs 1 and 3 by LIF, OSM, and IFNγ was also investigated in native rat adipocytes, which were isolated by collagenase digestion of epididymal fat pads. Isolated adipocytes were stimulated for 10 min with insulin, leptin, LIF, OSM, or IFNγ. Tyrosine phosphorylation was examined by immunoblotting of whole cell extracts with the STAT 1 Tyr701 polyclonal and STAT 3 Tyr705 polyclonal antibodies. Low, but detectable, levels of STAT 1 and 3 tyrosine phosphorylation in the untreated, insulin-treated, and leptin-treated rat adipocytes were very similar. However, a substantial increase in the phosphorylation of both STAT 1 Tyr701 and STAT 3 Tyr705 by LIF, OSM, and IFNγ was observed in whole cell extracts (Fig. 4 A). These samples were also analyzed with the STAT 3 antibody to demonstrate that the observed increases in STAT 1 and 3 tyrosine phosphorylation were not due to differences in the amount of protein present in each sample. We also examined the nuclear translocation of STATs 1 and 3 by LIF and IFNγ in native rat adipocytes. Following acute stimulation, cells were fractionated to obtain cytosolic and nuclear extracts. Acute treatment with either LIF or IFNγ resulted in a substantial increase in STATs 1 and 3 in nuclear extracts (Fig. 4 B). We also examined the ability of pretreatment with either insulin or GH to affect the tyrosine phosphorylation of STATs 1 and 3 by LIF, OSM, and IFNγ. Serum-deprived 3T3-L1 adipocytes were treated for 20 min with either 50 nm insulin or 100 ng/ml of GH and then treated for 15 min with OSM, LIF, or IFNγ. As previously indicated (Fig. 1), IFNγ is a potent inducer of STAT 1 Tyr701phosphorylation but also results in STAT 3 Tyr705phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of STAT 3 (Figs. 1 and 2). Activation of STATs 1 and 3 is clearly demonstrated in Fig. 5, where IFNγ is a potent activator of STAT 1 and LIF and OSM are potent activators of STAT 3. As indicated in Fig. 5, GH resulted in a minimal amount of STAT 1 and STAT 3 tyrosine phosphorylation, but preincubation with GH or insulin did not have any effect on the phosphorylation of STAT 1 Tyr701 or STAT 3 Tyr705 by LIF, OSM, or IFNγ. These whole extracts were also used to examine the presence of active MAPK. As indicated in Fig. 5, insulin is a potent activator of MAPK. In addition, GH, LIF, and OSM treatment also resulted in the activation of MAPK. However, neither the tyrosine phosphorylation of STATs 1 and 3 (Fig. 5) nor the presence of STATs 1 and 3 in the nucleus (data not shown) correlated with the activation of MAPK. Recent studies have suggested that both STATs 1 and 3 are substrates of MAPK and that serine phosphorylation of STATs 1 and 3 may affect both the nuclear translocation and DNA binding of these transcription factors. Therefore, we examined the ability of OSM, LIF, and IFNγ to activate STATs 1 and 3 in the presence of the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase inhibitor, PD98059. Serum-deprived 3T3-L1 adipocytes were pretreated with 30 μm PD98059 for 30 min and then stimulated with IFNγ alone or IFNγ and insulin for 15 min. Cytosolic, nuclear, and whole cell extracts were examined for STAT 1 and 3 tyrosine phosphorylation as shown in Fig. 6. IFNγ treatment resulted in the tyrosine phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of STATs 1 and 3, and this activation was not affected by the addition of insulin either prior to or following IFNγ treatment. In the STAT 3 p-tyr panel, three different treatments resulted in the presence of two distinct immunoreactive STAT 3 bands. These three treatments were from cells that were stimulated with IFNγ alone, IFNγ plus PD98059, and IFNγ plus PD98059 plus insulin. The top band is STAT 3, which is both tyrosine (Tyr705)- and serine (Ser727)-phosphorylated. The lower (faster migrating) band is STAT 3, which is only phosphorylated on Tyr705 and is only present with IFNγ treatment. The examination of STAT 3 serine phosphorylation was performed using a phosphorylation state-specific antibody (STAT 3 p-ser), which only recognizes STAT 3 that is phosphorylated on serine 727. Western blot analysis revealed that STAT 3 is serine-phosphorylated to some extent in basal conditions but is markedly enhanced with the addition of insulin and the subsequent activation of MAPK (Fig. 6). This enhancement is strikingly demonstrated with a lighter exposure of the STAT 3 p-serblot. The ability of insulin to increase STAT 3 serine phosphorylation is inhibited by PD98059. Also, the examination of active MAPK correlated with the enhancement of STAT 3 Ser727phosphorylation and resulted in all of the STAT 3 protein migrating at the higher molecular weight band in both cytosolic and nuclear extracts. Examination of STAT 1 and MAPK in cytosolic extracts is shown to demonstrate even protein loading and the presence of unactivated proteins in untreated extracts. Insulin, a potent activator of MAPK, had no effect on STAT 1 Tyr701 phosphorylation or nuclear translocation. Also, the inhibition of insulin-induced MAPK activation by PD98059 had no effect on the IFNγ-induced STAT 1 Tyr701 phosphorylation or nuclear translocation (Fig. 6). However, treatment with insulin (either before or after acute IFNγ stimulation) resulted in all of the Tyr705-phosphorylated STAT 3 migrating at the higher molecular weight. Furthermore, the ability of insulin to cause all of the STAT 3 to migrate at the higher molecular weight due to Ser727 phosphorylation was inhibited by PD98059 and the absence of active MAPK. We also examined the nuclear translocation and Tyr701 and Tyr705 phosphorylation of STATs 1 and 3 after treatment with LIF and OSM in the presence of PD98059. Unlike IFNγ, LIF and OSM are potent inducers of MAPK. Serum-deprived adipocytes were pretreated with insulin (15 min) or PD98059 (30 min) and then treated with either OSM or LIF for 15 min. Pretreatment with either PD98059 or insulin had no effect on either the tyrosine phosphorylation or nuclear translocation of STATs 1 and 3 as indicated by the Western blot analysis of nuclear extracts in Fig. 7. However, acute treatment with LIF or OSM resulted in the exclusive presence of the higher migrating band of STAT 3 phosphorylated at both Tyr705 and Ser727. In the presence of PD98059 (with or without insulin), however, there were two immunoreactive bands of STAT 3 present in nuclear extracts following acute LIF or OSM treatment (Fig. 7). An identical pattern of STAT 3 immunoreactive bands was also observed in cytosolic extracts (data not shown). Immunoblotting of nuclear extracts with the STAT 3 Ser727antibody (STAT 3 p-ser) revealed that there was no STAT 3 Ser727 in the nucleus in the absence of LIF and OSM. Although we have shown that a portion of STAT 3 is constitutively serine-phosphorylated in basal serum-deprived adipocytes (Fig. 7), this STAT 3 protein is located exclusively in the cytosol as indicated by the lack of serine-phosphorylated STAT 3 in the nucleus during unstimulated conditions (Fig. 7). The presence of Ser727-phosphorylated STAT 3 is notably decreased in nuclear extracts isolated from LIF- or OSM-stimulated adipocytes that were pretreated with PD98059. As shown in Fi"

We show that the IL-4 receptor, like other cytokine receptor systems utilizing the common receptor γ-chain (γc), is also connected to a signaling pathway that involves STAT5. Both STAT5a and STAT5b become tyrosine-phosphorylated and acquire specific DNA-binding properties in response to IL-4 receptor stimulation in the murine pro-B cell line Ba/F3. In preactivated human T cells, STAT5 became activated in an IL-4-dependent fashion as assayed by IL-4-induced STAT5 translocation from the cytoplasm to the cell nucleus and by binding to cognate DNA. Moreover, stimulation of preactivated human T cells by IL-4 led to specific transcriptional up-regulation of STAT5 target genes. IL-4 receptor-mediated STAT5 activation is dependent on the presence of γc and JAK3 within the receptor complex. In COS-7 cells, the JAK/STAT pathway leading from the IL-4 receptor to STAT5-dependent regulation of a reporter gene relied largely on coexpression of JAK3.

Blood. 1991; 77: 1859-1870Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), exerts its activity on target cells through the interleukin-4 receptor. Different cell types, including lymphoid and myeloid blood cells, express a bipartite IL-4 receptor (IL-4R), which consists of the IL-4R α-chain (IL-4Rα) (2Idzerda R.L. March C.J. Mosley B. Lyman S.D. Bos T.V. Gimpel S.D. Din W.S. Grabstein K.H. Widmer M.B. Park L.S. Cosman D. Beckman M.P. J. Exp.

IL-4Rα may also form a functional IL-4 receptor in conjunction with the IL-13 receptor instead of γc, especially in nonimmune cells (4Callard R.E. Matthews D.J. Hibbert L. Immunol.

In vitroIL-4Rα has also been shown to trigger intracellular signal transduction as a homodimer without participation of a heterologous receptor subunit (5Kammer W. Lischke A. Moriggl R. Groner B.

IL-4-induced dimerization of receptor subunits results in the rapid onset of various cytoplasmic events.

Tyrosine phosphorylation of IL-4Rα, IRS-2 (insulin receptor substrate 2, originally termed 4PS/IL-4-induced phosphorylation substrate), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, STAT6, and probably other proteins generate a network of protein-protein contacts mediated by interactions between phosphotyrosines and Src homology 2 domains (9Duschl A.

The aspect of IL-4R-triggered intracellular signal transduction that has been best characterized is the JAK-STAT pathway. STAT (signal transducer and activator oftranscription) factors are central components of signaling cascades triggered by cytokine receptors and are phosphorylated in response to ligand stimulation through receptor-associated Janus kinases (JAKs). STAT factors then dimerize and translocate to the cell nucleus, where they interact with cognate DNA sequences of γ-interferon-responsive sites (GASs) and modulate transcription of target genes (17Schindler C. Darnell J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 621-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (1651) Google Scholar). Following signal induction by the ligand, both the IL-4 receptor and the IL-13 receptor specifically mediate the activation of STAT6 (15Ryan J.J. McReynolds L.J. Keegan A. Wang L.-H. Garfein E.

Results obtained in the course of investigations on related cytokine receptors raised the question of whether STAT6 is the only STAT protein involved in IL-4-induced intracellular signaling.

As well as being activated by the prolactin receptor and cytokine receptors of the “γc family,” STAT5 is also involved in signaling by the IL-3, IL-5, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptors. It also participates in cellular reactions triggered by the receptors for growth hormone, thrombopoietin, erythropoietin, and epidermal growth factor (37Azam M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Kreider B.L.

The fact that STAT5 activity is controlled by this wide variety of cytokines and growth factors in different cell types suggests an important role of STAT5 in the general regulation of cell differentiation and cell growth. A recent report provided evidence for IL-4-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5 in primary human B cells (43Rolling C. Treton D. Pellegrini S. Galanaud P. Richard Y. FEBS Lett. 1996; 393: 53-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated the responsiveness of STAT5 to ligand-induced activation of the IL-4 receptor in different cell systems. We demonstrate that STAT5 is activated in response to IL-4 stimulation in cell lines and in primary human cells. Upon IL-4 treatment of these cell types, STAT5 is tyrosine-phosphorylated and translocates to the cell nucleus, where it binds to a cognate DNA element and induces specific target genes. A further goal of this work was to obtain information on the mechanisms that underlie IL-4R-mediated activation of STAT5. In Ba/F3 cells, IL-4-induced STAT5 activation was dependent on the contribution of the common receptor γ-chain. In COS-7 cells, expression of heterologous JAK3, the binding partner of γc, was crucial for full activation of STAT5 by the IL-4R. Recombinant DNA work was performed according to standard procedures (44Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed.

Individual cell samples were suspended in 500 μl of ice-cold PBS and spun onto glass coverslips at 220 × gfor 3 min using a cytospin device (Hettich). Cells were fixed for 10 min in methanol at −20 °C and for 2 min in acetone at −20 °C.

Nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33258 (10 μg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline) for 3 min. Slides were then examined in the epifluorescence mode using a Zeiss Axiophot microscope.

Reverse transcription was performed by using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Peqlab, Erlangen, Germany) and oligo-dT primer starting from 1 μg of RNA in a total volume of 20 μl according to the manufacturer's instructions. 3 μl of cDNA solution was subsequently used to amplify specific cDNAs by 30 cycles of the program 30 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 60 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C using PowerScript DNA Polymerase (PAN Systems, Nürnberg) following the supplier's protocol. 60 pmol of the respective specific primer was employed in each individual reaction, which was performed in a total volume of 30 μl. Specific primers were designed such that sequence similarity between murine and human mRNAs was maximal in the respective hybridization regions. The following primers were used: for cis, 5′-CTGCTGTGCATAGCCAAGACGTTC-3′ and 5′-CAGAGTTGGAAGGGGTACTGTCGG-3′; forosm, 5′-CGGCACAATATCCTCGGCATAAGG-3′ and 5′-TGCTCCTGGAAGGTCTGATTTTGC-3′; for pim-1, 5′-ACGTGGAGAAGGACCGGATTTCC-3′ and 5′-GATGTTTTCGTCCTTGATGTCGC-3′; and for gapdh, 5′-CGGAGTCAACGGATTTGGTCGTAT-3′ and 5′-AGCCTTCTCCATGGTGGTGAAGAC-3′. Sizes of the expected amplification products are 574 bp for cis, 387 bp forosm, 316 bp for pim-1, and 306 bp forgapdh. 15 μl of each reaction was analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis.

This cell line was used to address whether hIL-4-induced activation of the hIL-4R can affect the tyrosine phosphorylation state of STAT5. Fig. 1 A shows that hIL-4 stimulation results in a rapid and profound tyrosine phosphorylation of both STAT5a and STAT5b, which reaches a plateau 10 min after cytokine treatment and is sustained for at least 60 min. We next wished to demonstrate ligand-induced specific DNA binding of STAT5 in comparison with STAT6. BAF-4α-pγ cells were stimulated with hIL-4 or, as a control for STAT5 activation, mIL-3. Cell lysates were subjected to an electrophoretic mobility shift assay using the proximal STAT5 binding site from the bovine β-casein promoter as a DNA probe (Fig. 2). Both hIL-4 and mIL-3 evoked the formation of DNA-protein complexes (lanes 2 and 6). hIL-4 induced two distinct complexes of only slightly different migration behavior that could only be separated by relatively long gel runs (lane 2). Since we had previously found that the STAT5-binding DNA element from the β-casein promoter also interacts with phosphorylated STAT6 (47Moriggl R. Berchtold S. Friedrich K. Standke G.J.R. Kammer W.

https://openalex.org/W2028683294,"The pancreas secretes several different lipases. The most abundant is pancreatic triglyceride lipase (PTL). The pancreas also synthesizes two homologues of PTL, the pancreatic lipase-related proteins 1 and 2 (PLRP1 and PLRP2). Cytotoxic T-lymphocytes also express PLRP2 under certain conditions. We sought to determine the role of PLRP2 in fat absorption and in T-cell cytotoxicity by creating a PLRP2-deficient mouse. Adult PLRP2-deficient mice had normal fat absorption. In contrast, suckling PLRP2-deficient mice had fat malabsorption evidenced by increased fecal weight, increased fecal fats, and the presence of undigested and partially digested dietary triglycerides in the feces. As a result, the PLRP2-deficient pups had a decreased rate of weight gain. To assess T cell cytotoxicity, we immunized PLRP2-deficient mice with a mastocytoma cell line, P815, and determined the ability of splenocytes from the immunized mice to kill P815 cells in a 51Cr release assay. PLRP2-deficient cells had deficient killing activity in this assay, and PLRP2-deficient splenocytes released fewer fatty acid from the target cells than did control cells. Our results provide the first evidence of a physiological function for PLRP2. PLRP2 participates in T cell cytotoxicity, and PLRP2 performs a crucial role in the digestion of dietary fats in suckling animals."

Although the roles of these molecules in insulin action are not yet known, each protein contained an acidic motif that interacted with the PH domain of IRS-2. However, only the acidic motif in nucleolin bound to IRS-1, suggesting that the PH domain in IRS-1 and IRS-2 are not identical. Moreover, synthetic peptides based on the acidic motif in Lon protease and myeloblast protein inhibited the binding of nucleolin to the PH domain of IRS-2 but not to the PH domain of IRS-1, confirming the selectivity of these PH domains. The ability to bind acidic motifs may be a specific function of the PH domain in IRS proteins, because the PH domains in βARK, phospholipase Cγ, or spectrin did not bind nucleolin. In 32D cells, nucleolin bound to both IRS-1 and IRS-2, and expression of the acidic motif of nucleolin inhibited insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 and IRS-2. These results suggest that the binding of acidic motifs to the PH domain of IRS-1 and IRS-2 disrupts coupling to the activated insulin receptor.

Early steps in cellular signaling by growth factors and cytokines are mediated by molecular interactions that are coordinated by common protein modules. In many cases the molecular basis of these protein-protein interactions are known: Src homology 2 domains and phosphotyrosine binding (PTB)1 domains bind to tyrosine phosphorylated motifs in activated receptors or in transiently associated docking proteins; and Src homology 3 domains and WW domains bind to proline-rich motifs in receptors, enzymes, and the cytoskeleton (1Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 373: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2234) Google Scholar). Pleckstrin homology (PH) domains are also frequent participants in the signaling cascades. Most molecules that contain a PH domain interact with membrane components, suggesting that PH domains mediate membrane targeting. However, PH domains display a broad range of binding specificity, which has hindered the identification of ligands for the various PH domain isoforms. PH domains consist of approximately 100 amino acids, but amino acid sequence alignments reveal few overall identities. A single tryptophan residue in the COOH-terminal α-helix is the only residue conserved in all PH domains (2Gibson T.J. Hyvonen M. Musacchio A. Saraste M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 349-353Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Secondary structure is the best predictor of the PH domain.

Recent studies reveal that the lipid product of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase binds to the PH domains of Btk, SOS, Tiam-I, and PKB (11Li Z. Wahl M.I. Eguinoa A. Stephens L.R. Hawkins P.T. Witte O.N.

In the latter case, the interaction of PKB with phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate or phosphatidylinositol 3,4,-diphosphate, mediates the translocation of PKB to membranes, which places its regulation under the influence of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (13Franke T.F.

Although the interaction of PH domains with phosphatidylinositol diphosphate and phosphatidylinositol triphosphate provides a common theme to understand their function, not all PH domains bind to these phospholipids (16Rameh L.E.

Some PH domains bind protein ligands, as illustrated by the association of the βark PH domain with βγ-subunits of heterotrimeric G-proteins (17Pitcher J.A. Touhara K. Payne E.S. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11707-11710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Members of the insulin receptor substrate family (IRS proteins) contain an NH2-terminal PH domain followed immediately by a PTB domain. The PTB domain binds to the phosphorylated NPEY motif in the juxtamembrane region of the activated insulin receptor (18Yenush L. Makati K.J. Smith-Hall J. Ishibashi O. Myers Jr., M.G. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24300-24306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Although the structures of the PH and PTB domains are very similar, the ligands for the PH domains in IRS proteins are not yet defined (19Eck M.J. Dhe-Paganon S. Trub T. Nolte R.T. Shoelson S.E. Cell. 1996; 85: 695-705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). A direct interaction between the insulin receptor and the PH domain of IRS-1 has not been detected (20O'Neill T.J. Craparo A. Gustafson T.A. Mol. Cell.

Nevertheless, the PH domain is essential for efficient tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 during insulin stimulation, because deletion of the PH domain significantly reduces insulin-stimulated IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation (18Yenush L.

The PH domain in the IRS proteins may have a common function that mediates receptor coupling, because chimeric IRS-1 proteins bearing the PH domains from IRS-2 or Gab-1 are phosphorylated normally by the insulin receptor (24Burks D.J. Pons S. Towery H. Smith-Hall J. Myers Jr., M.G. Yenush L. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27716-27721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). By contrast, chimeric IRS-1 proteins constructed with PH domains from βARK, PLCγ, or spectrin fail to couple to the insulin receptor, suggesting that these heterologous PH domains are incapable of mediating the correct protein coupling. Therefore, to identify potential protein ligands for the PH domains in the IRS proteins, we used the PH domains of IRS-1 and IRS-2 as baits in a yeast two-hybrid screen. Our analysis has revealed that acidic motifs in proteins define provisionally the ligand specificity for the PH domain in IRS proteins. PH domains of IRS-1 (amino acids 13–114) and IRS-2 (amino acids 31–143) were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and cloned into the yeast two-hybrid plasmid pGBT9 (25Chien C.T. Bartel P.L. Sternglanz R. Fields S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9578-9582Crossref PubMed Scopus (1224) Google Scholar). Similarly, the PTB domains of IRS-1 (amino acids 131–331) and IRS-2 (amino acids 161–376) were prepared in the pGBT9 plasmid. These bait-containing plasmids were then used to screen a 9.5–10.5 day post-conception mouse embryo library prepared in plasmid pVP16 (26Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A.

Positive library clones were isolated from His prototroph and β-galactosidase (β-gal) yeast assays (27Riedel H. Wang J. Hansen H. Yousaf N. J. Biochem. 1997; 122: 1105-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Plasmids were transfected into Escherichia coli, sequenced, and then re-introduced into Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain L40. The specificity of these interactions was then assessed by mating with the AMR70 strain carrying various test baits. These bait-prey interactions were revealed by the β-gal color assay (26Vojtek A.B.

GST fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli strain BL-21 and purified using glutathione-agarose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies directed against IRS-1 or IRS-2 have been described previously (23Myers Jr., M.G. Grammer T.C. Brooks J. Glasheen E.M. Wang L.M. Sun X.J. Blenis J. Pierce J.H. White M.F.

Antibodies against sequences encoded by yeast two-hybrid clones (myeloblast protein, lon protease, and nucleolin) were generated by immunization of rabbits with GST fusion proteins of these partial cDNA clones (HRP, Denver, PA). The native PH domain in IRS-1 was replaced with the PH domains of IRS-2, Gab1, βARK, PLCγ, or spectrin as described previously (24Burks D.J. Pons S. Towery H. Smith-Hall J. Myers Jr., M.G. Yenush L.

These PH domains were excised from pGEX-2T, adapted by polymerase chain reaction with initiation codons, SacI restriction sites, and cloned in-frame into the pCMVhis expression vector containing the cDNA for IRS1ΔPH (18Yenush L.

All constructs were then excised from the pCMVhis vector with SnabI and SalI and ligated into the pBABE expression vector. Constructs were then stably transfected into 32D cells. Lysates were prepared for GST pull-down experiments. For expression in mammalian cells, inserts from the library clones were ligated into the expression vector pcDNAI (Invitrogen). The laboratory of Nancy Maizels, Yale University, provided the full-length nucleolin cDNA (29Hanakahi L.A. Depsey L.A. Li M.J. Maizels N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Subconfluent cultures of CHO or CHO cells overexpressing the insulin receptor (CHO/IR) were transfected transiently using DEAE-dextran or calcium phosphate (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). 24 h post-transfection cells were serum starved for 16 h and then stimulated with 100 nm insulin for 10 min. Cells were then lysed and analyzed for tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS proteins by immunoblotting. Expression of clones encoding potential PH domain ligands was verified using either a sequence-specific antibody or anti-hemagglutinin because recombinant proteins bear this tagged epitope. For GST pull-down experiments and immunoprecipitations, cells were lysed in 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 137 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mmCaCl2, 10 mm Na3VO4, and protease inhibitors as described previously (23Myers Jr., M.G.

For experiments testing insulin action, cells were starved either overnight (CHO cells) or 4 h (32D cells) and then stimulated with 100 nminsulin for 10 min. The preparation of IRS proteins containing heterologous PH domains has been described previously (24Burks D.J. Pons S. Towery H. Smith-Hall J. Myers Jr., M.G. Yenush L. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27716-27721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). One ml of cleared cell lysates (0.5 mg of protein) was incubated for 2 h with either antiserum or 25 μl (packed volume) of glutathione-agarose containing approximately 0.5 μg of GST fusion protein. Immune complexes were collected with protein A-Sepharose. After washing, complexes were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (10%) and transferred to nitrocellulose for Western analysis. Immunoblots were developed by ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Peptides derived from the amino acid sequence of the clone encoding nucleolin were synthesized by the Harvard Microchemistry Facility. Cell lysates and GST fusion proteins were prepared as described above. Various concentrations of peptides were incubated with one ml of cell lysates for one h prior to the addition of 25 μl of Sepharose containing 0.5 μg of nucleolin GST fusion protein. After a two-hour incubation with this affinity resin, the Sepharose pellet was washed and eluted in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer. Bound complexes were then analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting. We used the yeast two-hybrid system to identify proteins that bind to the PH domains of IRS-1 and IRS-2 in a 10.5-day mouse embryo cDNA library. Bait constructs were prepared with each PH domain, and the initial screen revealed 47 cDNA clones. The binding specificity of each clone was analyzed in yeast using the PH or PTB domains of IRS-1 or IRS-2 and different control constructs, including the intracellular domain of the insulin or the IGF-1 receptor, PKCδ, or GAL4 (Table I). All 47 clones interacted with the PH domain of IRS-2, whereas only 4 clones interacted with the PH domain of IRS-1. None of the clones interacted with the other test baits.Table ICharacterization of PH ligandsMyeloblast proteinLon proteaseNucleolinPoly-GluIndependent Clones104825Coding region isolated1065–1185685–775239–341????IRS1-PH−−+++−IRS2-PH+++++++++++IRS1-PTB−−−−IRS2 PTB−−−−IR−−−−IGF1 R−−−−pGBT−−−−A β-gal assay was used to evaluate the specificity of the interactions between the four groups of cDNA clones and the PH domains of IRS-1 and IRS-2. Additionally, the clones were introduced into yeast strains carrying the control baits which included the PTB domains of IRS-1 and IRS-2, the entire intracellular domain of the β-subunit of the insulin receptor, the catalytic domain of the IGF-I receptor, and the bait plasmid pGBT. Positive interacting colonies were scored positive based on the development of blue color according to a standard assay as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Colonies that displayed blue color within 15 min were scored +++, and those that were positive after 30 min were assigned ++. The absence of color demonstrates the lack of an interaction and was determined after a 24-h incubation. The scoring presented here was compiled from at least two independent β-gal assays.

The absence of color demonstrates the lack of an interaction and was determined after a 24-h incubation. The scoring presented here was compiled from at least two independent β-gal assays. Many of the initial clones represented duplicates of the same cDNA, and restriction mapping classified the 47 cDNA clones into four unique groups. DNA sequence analysis revealed that these sets of cDNA molecules encoded partial murine isoforms of nucleolin, Lon protease, or myeloblast protein (Fig. 1). A fourth set of clones encoded a repetitive open reading frame that contained a Glu-Arg polymer; however, this clone was not studied further. In a yeast β-gal assay, the nucleolin fragment bound to the PH domain of IRS-1 and IRS-2, whereas the cloned fragments of lon protease or myeloblast protein bound only to the PH domain of IRS-2 (Table I). Because the cloned fragments of nucleolin, Lon protease, and myeloblast protein bind to the PH domains of IRS-1 or IRS-2, they are PH ligands (PHL): PHLnuc, PHLlon, and PHLMB, respectively. Nucleolin is a ubiquitously expressed nucleolar protein that becomes phosphorylated in response to insulin and may have a role in RNA export in cells (31Csermely P. Schnaider T. Cheatham B. Olson M.O.J. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9747-9752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In bacteria Lon proteases function to degrade abnormal proteins; however, the function of these enzymes in mammalian cells is unknown (32Rickles R.J. Botfield M.C. Zhou X.M. Henry P.A. Brugge J.S. Zoller M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10909-10913Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The human myeloblast protein was cloned from human KG-1 cells, but no information regarding its function is currently available. The selectivity of the PH ligands was verified in vitro by measuring their binding to recombinant IRS-1 or IRS-2 in transfected 32D cells. GST fusion proteins expressing PHLnuc, PHLlon, or PHLMB were prepared and attached to glutathione-Sepharose. Crude cell extracts containing IRS-1 or IRS-2 were incubated with each GST fusion protein. GST alone did not bind to IRS-1 or IRS-2. Consistent with the yeast screen, the GST fusion proteins containing PHLlon or PHLMB associated with IRS-2 but not with IRS-1 (Fig. 1). As expected, IRS2ΔPH, a mutant of IRS-2 that lacks the PH domain, did not associate with PHLlon or PHLMB, which is consistent with the conclusion that the PH domain mediated the binding (Fig. 1). By contrast, PHLnuc associated with both IRS-1 and IRS-2 in the 32D cell extracts (Fig. 1 C). Insulin stimulation of 32D cells failed to change the association of the PH ligands with IRS-1 or IRS-2, suggesting that these interactions in this cellular context were not regulated by insulin. Based on the binding of PHLnuc with IRS-1 and IRS-2, the interaction of nucleolin with IRS-1 and IRS-2 was investigated in CHOIR cell extracts. Lysates from CHOIR cells expressing IRS-1 or IRS-2 or a mutant of IRS-1 lacking the PH domain (IRS1ΔPH) were incubated with antibodies against nucleolin. Both IRS-1 and IRS-2 were co-immunoprecipitated with nucleolin antibodies from these cell lysates, whereas immunoprecipitations performed with preimmune serum did not contain nucleolin or IRS proteins (Fig. 2). Moreover, IRS1ΔPH did not interact with nucleolin, demonstrating that in vivo the interaction between nucleolin and IRS proteins also occurred through the PH domain. Alignment of PHLnuc, PHLlon, and PHLMP did not reveal a common motif. However, each protein contained a stretch of acidic residues. Moreover, a fourth set of cDNA clones isolated by the yeast two-hybrid screen encoded an open reading frame containing a repetitive sequence of Glu residues, suggesting that acidic motifs in proteins may bind to the PH domain (Fig. 1). To test this possibility, PHLnuc was truncated to partially or completely remove its acidic motif, and the interaction of the wild-type or mutant PHLnuc with IRS-1 was evaluated in yeast (Fig. 3). As previously observed, PHLnuc interacted strongly with the PH domain of IRS-1 in yeast color assay. Deletion of the first 28 NH2-terminal residues partially reduced this association, whereas deletion of the next 23 residues, including the remaining acidic amino acids, completely abolished the interaction of PHLnuc with the PH domain (Fig. 3). Deletion of the last 50 COOH-terminal amino acid residues of PHLnuc had no effect on the interaction with the IRS-1 PH domain. To verify that the PH domain of IRS-1 binds to the acidic motif in nucleolin, wild-type nucleolin containing a hemagglutinin tag at the COOH terminus was expressed in CHOIR cells (29Hanakahi L.A. Depsey L.A. Li M.J. Maizels N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3605-3610Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with an antibody against the hemagglutinin tag, and the presence of IRS-1 was demonstrated by immunoblotting (Fig. 3). A mutant nucleolin lacking nucleotides 687–887, which encode the acidic motif, was also expressed in CHOIR cells. However, this truncated nucleolin protein did not co-immunoprecipitate IRS-1 (Fig. 3). These results suggest that the PH domain of IRS-1 binds to the acidic motif between residues 239–280 in nucleolin. Our previous results suggest that PH domains in homologous IRS proteins, including IRS-1, IRS-2, and Gab-1 have similar functions, because each PH domain couples IRS proteins to the insulin receptor (24Burks D.J. Pons S. Towery H. Smith-Hall J. Myers Jr., M.G. Yenush L. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27716-27721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Chimeric IRS-1 proteins containing an homologous PH domain from IRS-2 or Gab-1 were phosphorylated by the insulin receptor, whereas chimeric proteins containing a heterologous PH domain from spectrin, βARK, or PLCγ were not phosphorylated (24Burks D.J. Pons S. Towery H. Smith-Hall J. Myers Jr., M.G. Yenush L. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27716-27721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). To examine whether the PH ligands isolated from our yeast two-hybrid screen specifically interact with PH domains from IRS proteins, we investigated the binding of these chimeric IRS1 proteins to PHLnuc. These proteins were expressed in 32D cells as described previously and used in GST pull-down experiments. Consistent with their functional specificity, chimeric IRS-1 containing the PH domain from IRS-2 or Gab-1 associated with PHLnuc; however, binding to the Gab-1 PH domain was significantly weaker. Interestingly, the IRS-1 chimeras containing heterologous PH domains from spectrin, βARK, or PLCδ did not associate with PHLnuc (Fig. 4). These results suggest that the acidic motif in nucleolin interacts specifically with the PH domains of IRS proteins. Short peptides based on the acid motifs in nucleolin, Lon protease, or myeloblast proteins were tested for their ability to disrupt the interaction between PHLnuc and recombinant IRS-1 or IRS-2. Lysates of CHOIR cells expressing IRS-1 or IRS-2 were incubated for 30 min with immobilized PHLnuc and various concentrations of Nuc1 (238KVAEEEDDEEEDEDD252) or Nuc2 (238KVAEEEDDEE247) (Fig. 5). At concentrations of 10 and 100 nm, Nuc1 and Nuc2 blocked association of IRS-1 and IRS-2 with PHLnuc, whereas a control peptide containing Asp → Asn and Glu → Gln mutations was not inhibitory (Fig. 5 A). Based on these experiments, binding affinity of nucleolin-based peptides for IRS-1 and IRS-2 PH domains was less than 10 nm. In similar competition experiments, peptides derived from Lon protease and myeloblast protein were used to inhibit the binding of PHLnuc to IRS-2 or IRS-1. Both peptides inhibited the interaction between PHLnuc and IRS-2, although with less affinity; however, these peptides weakly inhibited the interaction with IRS-1 (Fig. 5, B and C). Thus, the PH domains of IRS-1 and IRS-2 may distinguish differences between acidic motifs. Previous experiments show that the PH domain provides important coupling between IRS-1 and the activated insulin receptor, although the mechanism of this coupling is unknown (18Yenush L. Makati K.J.

A., Hook, M., and Foster, T. (1998) Microbiology, in press) display variable numbers of B-repeats, i.e. segments of 110-113 residues that probably make up one folding unit. Each B-repeat contains one conserved EF-hand motif and two acidic stretches. Equilibrium dialysis revealed that segment B1-B5 of SrdD contains 14 Ca2+-binding sites with high affinity ([Ca2+]0.5, 4 microM), whereas flow dialysis yielded 5 sites of high affinity (class I) and 10 of low affinity (class II). The discrepancy could be explained by the slow induction of high affinity in the class II sites. Kinetic experiments using fluorescent Ca2+ indicators corroborated slow binding of Ca2+ at the latter sites. Circular dichroism and Trp fluorescence showed that, whereas the Ca2+ form is well folded, the metal-free form seems strongly disorganized. The Ca2+-induced conformational changes comprise both fast and slow steps, giving thus a structural support for the induction of class II Ca2+-binding sites. The B-repeats may act as rulers or springs that modulate the distance between the interactive A region and the bacterial cell surface."

Because RGS proteins can act as GAPs for heterotrimeric G proteins, they have been considered to be a missing link that might explain unresolved discrepancies in the deactivation kinetics of G protein signaling that have been observed in studiesin vivo and in vitro (4Angleson J.K.

Ion channels that are directly gated by G proteins allow for the resolution of the kinetics of G protein signaling in intact cells. The prototype of such a channel is the cardiac atrial potassium channel that is activated by muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (I K(ACh) channel) (9Kurachi Y. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C821-C830Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).I K(ACh) channels are formed by heteromultimers of G protein-regulated inwardlyrectifying K+ channels (GIRKs) 1 and 4 (Kir 3.1 and Kir 3.4) (10Dascal N. Schreibmayer W. Lim N.F. Wang W. Chavkin C. DiMagno L. Labarca C. Kieffer B.L. Gaveriaux-Ruff C. Trollinger D. Lester H.A. Davidson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nature. 1995; 374: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar). Upon activation of Gi-coupled receptors, such as the M2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) in membranes of atrial myocytes, Gβγ-subunits have been shown to directly bind to the channels and to increase their open probability (9Kurachi Y. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C821-C830Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Pfaffinger P.J. Martin J.M. Hunter D.D. Nathanson N.M. Hille B.

When GIRK channels are studied in heterologous expression systems they exhibit a much slower turn off (deactivation) compared with the rapid deactivation that is observed in native atrial myocytes (6Doupnik C.A. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Kofuji P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10461-10466Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 7Saitoh O. Kubo Y. Miyatani Y. Asano T. Nakata H. Nature. 1997; 390: 525-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). However, several recent studies have demonstrated that RGS3, RGS4, and RGS8 can induce rapid deactivation of heterologously expressedI K(ACh) (6Doupnik C.A. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Kofuji P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10461-10466Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 7Saitoh O. Kubo Y. Miyatani Y. Asano T. Nakata H. Nature. 1997; 390: 525-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). These studies were the first to demonstrate that RGS proteins may function as GAPs in intact cells. However, the RGS proteins also caused an unexpected acceleration of the kinetics of activation of the channels (6Doupnik C.A. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Kofuji P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10461-10466Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 7Saitoh O. Kubo Y. Miyatani Y. Asano T. Nakata H. Nature. 1997; 390: 525-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the RGS proteins did not cause a reduction in peak currents, an effect that would be predicted if the sole effect of RGS is to act as a GAP (8Zerangue N. Jan L.Y. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: R313-R316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These observations suggested that RGS may have additional roles. In other studies, RGS proteins inhibited Gα-activated pathways in intact cells (15Huang C. Hepler J.R. Gilman A.G. Mumby S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6159-6163Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 16Druey K.M. Blumer K.J. Kang V.H. Kehrl J.H. Nature. 1996; 379: 742-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar, 17Yan Y.

Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 843-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). These results could be explained in two ways: 1) RGS act as GAPs in vivo and decrease the concentration of active Gα (GTP-Gα), or 2) RGS bind to Gα and prevent binding of Gα to its effectors. RGS proteins bind with high affinity to the transition state of GTP-Gα, but they can also bind with lower affinity to the GTP- and GDP-bound form of Gα (1Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1269-1272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar, 20Hunt T.W. Fields T.A. Casey P.J. Peralta E.G.

A. 1997; 94: 428-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). The analysis of RGS effects on Gβγ signaling should help to elucidate which of these two possibilities occur in vivo, because structural studies indicate that it is unlikely that Gβγ and RGS can bind to the same Gα at the same time (1Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1269-1272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar, 3Tesmer J.J. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R.

Nature. 1996; 379: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar). Therefore, if RGS inhibit signaling by binding to Gα, RGS will increase the concentration of free Gβγ and activate Gβγ-signaling pathways. On the other hand, if RGS act solely as GAPs, there should be a decrease in free Gβγ by promoting reassociation to heterotrimers (23Iyengar R. Science. 1997; 275: 42-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In this study we tested these hypotheses by examining the effect of RGS proteins on Gβγ-mediated signaling by measuring kinetics as well as amplitudes of basal and agonist-activatedI K(ACh). Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells either nontransfected, stably expressing the M2mAChR (400 fmol of receptor/mg of protein) (24Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Xu Y. Witt-Enderby P. Benovic J.L. Hosey M.M. J.

Miller with permission from SIBIA) (25Shekter L.R. Taussig R. Gillard S.E. Miller R.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 282-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar)) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.). Chinese hamster ovary (CHO K1) cells were grown in Ham's F-12 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.). The media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and streptomycin/penicillin (100 units each). Cells were grown under 10% CO2 at 37 °C. In all transfections for electrophysiological studies the CD8 reporter gene system was used to visualize transfected cells (26Jurman M.E. Boland L.M. Liu Y. Yellen G. BioTechniques. 1994; 17: 876-881PubMed Google Scholar). Dynabeads coated with anti-CD8 antibodies were purchased from Dynal. The calcium phosphate method was used for transient transfection of HEK cells. The following amounts of cDNAs were used (unless otherwise indicated): πH3-CD8 (human), 1 μg; pC1-GIRK1 (rat), 1 μg; pCDNA1-GIRK4 (rat), 1 μg; pCDNA3-M2 mAChR (human), 2 μg; pCDNA3.1-RGS4 (rat), 4 μg; pcrCMV-RGS3 (rat), 4 μg; pCDNA3B-CD8-βARK-ct, 4 μg. Typically the total amount of cDNA used for transfection of one 10-cm dish was 9 μg. CHO K1 cells were transfected using transfectACE (27Campbell M.J. BioTechniques. 1995; 18: 1027-1032PubMed Google Scholar) or Superfect (Qiagen) using the following amounts of cDNAs/6-cm dish: CD8, 0.3 μg; GIRK1, 1 μg; GIRK4, 1 μg; M2 AChR, 1 μg; and RGS4, 2 μg. All assays were performed 48–72 h post-transfection. The cDNAs for the GIRK1 and -4 were gifts from F. Lesage and M. Lazdunski, CD8 was from G. Yellen, CD8-βARK-ct was from S. Gutkind, RGS3 was from K. Druey and J. Kehrl, and RGS4 was from P. Kofuji and H. A. Lester. For measurement of N-type Ca2+ channels, G1A1 cells were transiently transfected with RGS4 (4 μg) or empty pCDNA 3.1 (4 μg) using calcium phosphate. For the measurement of K+ currents an extracellular solution of the following composition was used (mm): NaCl, 120; KCl, 20; CaCl2, 2; MgCl2, 1; Hepes-NaOH, 10; pH 7.4. The internal (pipette) solution contained (mm): potassium glutamate, 100; KCl, 40; MgATP, 5; Hepes-KOH, 10; NaCl, 5; EGTA, 2; MgCl2, 1; GTP, 0.01; pH 7.4. For measurement of barium currents through N-type Ca2+ channels the extracellular solution contained (mm): NaCl, 105; CsCl, 25; BaCl2, 10; MgCl2, 1; Hepes-NaOH, 10; pH 7.4. The intracellular solution contained: CsCl, 130; EGTA, 5; Hepes-CsOH, 5; MgATP, 5; MgCl2, 1; GTP, 0.01; pH 7.3. All standard salts as well as acetylcholine (ACh) were from Sigma. Membrane currents were recorded under voltage clamp using conventional whole cell patch-clamp techniques (28Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pfluegers Arch.-Eur. J. Physiol. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref Scopus (15149) Google Scholar). Patch pipettes were fabricated from borosilicate glass capillaries (GF-150-10, Warner Instrument Corp.) using a horizontal puller (P-95 Fleming & Poulsen). The DC resistance of the filled pipettes ranged from 3 to 6 megaohms. Membrane currents were recorded using a patch-clamp amplifier (Axopatch 200, Axon Instruments). Signals were analog-filtered using a lowpass Bessel filter (1–3 kHz corner frequency). Data were digitally stored using an IBM compatible PC equipped with a hardware/software package (ISO2 by MFK, Frankfurt/Main, Germany) for voltage control, data acquisition, and data evaluation.I K(ACh) was measured as an inward current using a holding potential of −90 mV as described (29Bünemann M. Brandts B. zu Heringdorf D.M. van Koppen C.J. Jakobs K.H. Pott L. J. Physiol. (Lond .). 1995; 489: 701-707Crossref Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Voltage ramps (from −120 mV to +60 mV in 500 ms, every 10 s) were used to determine current-voltage (I-V) relationships. Barium currents through N-type calcium channels were measured as described (25Shekter L.R. Taussig R. Gillard S.E. Miller R.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 282-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Briefly, Ba2+ currents were measured every 10 s using two 25-ms test pulses of +10 mV that were interrupted by a 70-ms period in which the potential was clamped either to the holding potential (without prepulses) or for a 65-ms long prepulse to +80 mV followed by 5-ms period at the holding potential of −90 mV. All measurements were performed at room temperature. Summarized results are presented as mean values ± S.E. Statistically significant differences were analyzed using Student's t test. To measure agonist-induced I K(ACh) we routinely applied a saturating concentration of ACh (2 μm for HEK cells and 1 μm for CHO K1 cells) to fully activateI K(ACh). To measure basal (nonagonist-dependent) currents, we measured the difference in currents before and after application of 0.2 mmBa2+, which will completely block inwardly rectifying potassium currents. We first observed that RGS4 induced an unexpected increase in basal currents. In HEK cells transfected with GIRK1 and -4, only a small amount of basal current was observed as Ba2+reduced the current in the absence of ACh by 4.3 ± 0.8 pA/pF,n = 16 (Fig. 1,A and D). In marked contrast, in HEK293 cells transfected with GIRK1 and -4 plus RGS4, Ba2+ decreased the basal currents by 14.3 ± 2.7 pA/pF (n = 14) (Fig. 1, B and D). In nontransfected cells, Ba2+ did not affect background currents (five cells tested for each cell line). That the Ba2+ blockable currents were attributable to expression of GIRK1 and -4 was confirmed by demonstrating that the I-V relationships for both the agonist-induced currents and basal currents were identical (Fig. 1 C). Concomitant to the RGS-induced increase of basal currents, the ACh-induced currents were reduced in RGS4-expressing cells (12.3 ± 2.4 pA/pF in RGS-expressing cells versus24.1 ± 8.8 pA/pF in control cells), whereas the total (agonist + basal) currents were not altered (Fig. 1, B and D). Thus expression of RGS4 induced activation of 53 ± 8% of total I K(ACh) compared with basal activation of 19 ± 4% of I K(ACh) in control cells. Similar results were obtained using RGS3 instead of RGS4 (basal activation, 43 ± 5%, n = 4). Previously it was reported that RGS4 accelerated the kinetics of heterologously expressed I K(ACh) in Xenopus oocytes, as well as in CHO K1 cells (6Doupnik C.A. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Kofuji P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10461-10466Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar); however, stimulation of basal currents was not apparent. To test whether or not the observed increase in basal I K(ACh) in HEK 293 cells was a cell type-specific effect, we tested the effect of RGS4 on I K(ACh) in transiently transfected CHO K1 cells. Upon cotransfection with RGS4, most cells exhibited a large increase of ACh-independent, Ba2+-sensitive inwardly rectifying K+ currents (Fig. 2 B, 27 ± 20 pA/pF,n = 5), whereas in the absence of expressed RGS4, the detected Ba2+-sensitive background currents were negligible (Fig. 2 A, 2 ± 0.5 pA/pF, n = 5). These results mirrored those from the HEK cells and demonstrated that RGS expression led to agonist-independent activation of I K(ACh). We cannot explain why others did not detect an increase in basal current (6Doupnik C.A. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Kofuji P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10461-10466Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 7Saitoh O. Kubo Y. Miyatani Y. Asano T. Nakata H. Nature. 1997; 390: 525-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar); however, one obvious explanation is that there are differences in the heterologous expression systems used. In our experience the vast majority of the RGS4-transfected cells exhibited increased basalI K(ACh). Expression of RGS proteins also caused a small acceleration of the activation of I K(ACh) (Table I); however, this effect was less significant than previously reported in studies of I K(ACh) measured in Xenopus oocytes or CHO K1 cells (6Doupnik C.A. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Kofuji P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10461-10466Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 7Saitoh O. Kubo Y. Miyatani Y. Asano T. Nakata H. Nature. 1997; 390: 525-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). A more prominent effect of RGS was to cause faster deactivation of ACh-induced currents after withdrawal of ACh in both HEK293 cells and CHO K1 cells (Table I, see also Fig. 1,A versus B and Fig. 2, A versus B), similar to previous observations (6Doupnik C.A. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Kofuji P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10461-10466Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar,7Saitoh O. Kubo Y. Miyatani Y. Asano T. Nakata H. Nature. 1997; 390: 525-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The acceleration of I K(ACh) kinetics by RGS proteins most likely reflects the GAP activity of RGS proteins (20Hunt T.W. Fields T.A. Casey P.J. Peralta E.G. Nature. 1996; 383: 175-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar,30Chen C.K. Wieland T. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, the induction of basal I K(ACh)by RGS3 and RGS4 cannot be easily explained by the function of RGS as a GAP.Table IEffects of RGS on kinetics of IK(ACh)Activation kinetics (t 1/2 act.)Deactivation kinetics (t 1/2 deact.)HEK293: control1.26 ± 0.15 s, n = 167.4 ± 0.6 s, n = 16HEK293: +RGS30.96 ± 0.14 s, n = 93.6 ± 1.0 s, n = 8HEK293: +RGS40.89 ± 0.11 s, n = 85.2 ± 2.5 s, n = 7CHO K1: control1.14 ± 0.18 s, n = 714.3 ± 1.6 s, n = 7CHO K1: +RGS41.03 ± 0.17 s, n = 76.1 ± 1.5 s, n = 7 Open table in a new tab To determine whether the various effects of RGS might be because of high levels of expression, we varied the amount of RGS cDNA used for transfections and tested for effects on basal currents and on acceleration of deactivation. When the amount of RGS cDNA was reduced as low as 0.1 μg, the RGS effects on basal currents were still obvious, whereas the effects on deactivation were reduced (data not shown). Thus the newly appreciated effects of RGS to increase channel currents did not appear to be an artifact of overexpression. An RGS-induced promotion of the coupling of receptor, G protein, and channel was considered as a possible mechanism for the unexpected effects of RGS on basal currents and on activation kinetics (6Doupnik C.A. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Kofuji P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10461-10466Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). To test this, cells were treated with pertussis toxin. The uncoupling of receptors from G proteins by pertussis toxin pretreatment did not reduce the RGS-induced basalI K(ACh) whereas it completely abolished ACh-induced I K(ACh) (data not shown). Therefore, the RGS-induced basal activation of I K(ACh) did not depend on the basal activity of Gi- or Go-coupled receptors because it was not inhibited by pertussis toxin, which is known to prevent activation of Giand Go proteins by G protein-coupled receptors but not GTP hydrolysis and nucleotide exchange (34Ramdas L. Disher R.M. Wensel T.G. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11637-11645Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We determined that expression of Gβ1γ2resulted in a 3–4-fold increase of totalI K(ACh) in HEK cells (data not shown) indicating that endogenous Gi proteins are limiting for maximal activation of I K(ACh) in these cells. Next we tested whether RGS induced I K(ACh) by increasing free Gβγ in the cell or by activating GIRK channels via a Gβγ-independent mechanism. To do this we coexpressed the channels and RGS with CD8-βARK-ct, a fusion protein of the α-subunit of the CD8 receptor, and the C terminus of the β-adrenergic receptor kinase 1 (βARK1), which has been demonstrated to act as a Gβγ “sink” and block Gβγ-mediated signaling (35Crespo P. Cachero T.G. Xu N. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25259-25265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The expression of CD8-βARK-ct reduced basal I K(ACh) in RGS4-expressing cells by 65% (Fig. 3, compare currents in cells expressing CD8 versusCD8-βARK-ct). The expression of the Gβγ-binding protein also reduced the ACh response to the threshold of detection, resulting in a total (basal + agonist-activated) I K(ACh) of about 20% compared with the control (Fig. 3). Therefore, we concluded that RGS4 activated I K(ACh) via a Gβγ-dependent mechanism. Because GIRK1 and GIRK4 have been shown to bind Gβγ directly (36Huang C.L. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. FEBS Lett. 1997; 405: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) and therefore may act as sink for Gβγ if overexpressed, it was possible that the observed RGS-induced increase in basalI K(ACh) was the result of an RGS-induced increase in GIRK expression. Immunoblotting experiments using antibodies against GIRK1, GIRK4, and hemagglutinin-tagged RGS4 demonstrated no increase of GIRK1 and GIRK4 expression upon cotransfection with hemagglutinin-tagged RGS4 (data not shown). Therefore, an increase of GIRK1 and GIRK4 expression as the mechanism by which RGS4 induces basal I K(ACh) can be ruled out. An increase in the expression level of the endogenous Gβγ upon coexpression of RGS proteins could be another potential explanation for the observed increase in basal I K(ACh). However, we have observed that the total I K(ACh) is limited by the expression level of endogenous Gβγ proteins, as currents are greatly increased upon expression of Gβγ (data not shown). Because neither RGS3 nor RGS4 increased totalI K(ACh) (Fig. 1), an increase of Gβγ expression induced by RGS proteins seems unlikely. The possibility that expression of RGS proteins caused down-regulation of the Gαi proteins was not tested. Because the increase of basal I K(ACh) by RGS was dependent on Gβγ, a reasonable hypothesis was that the underlying mechanism for the RGS-induced I K(ACh) was an increase in the concentration of free Gβγ in the cell. To obtain further support of this hypothesis, we analyzed another Gβγ-regulated effector system that allowed for quantitative measurement of basal (nonagonist regulated) effects of Gβγ. N-type Ca2+channels are known to be inhibited by Gβγ, and this inhibition can be partially reversed by applying strong positive voltages prior to measuring channel currents with a procedure termed prepulse facilitation (25Shekter L.R. Taussig R. Gillard S.E. Miller R.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 282-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 37Zamponi G.W. Snutch T.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Although prepulse facilitation is usually more apparent in the presence of an agonist that activates Gi-coupled receptors, we attempted to reveal effects of RGS proteins on basal currents in the absence of an agonist. The effects of RGS on basal inhibition of N-type Ca2+ currents were tested in HEK293 cells stably expressing α1B, β1, and α2δ calcium channel subunits (25Shekter L.R. Taussig R. Gillard S.E. Miller R.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 282-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) using Ba2+ as the charge carrier. Ba2+ currents were measured using a double test pulse protocol in which two successive measurements of current test pulses were separated by a 65-ms period during which the cells were or were not exposed to a strong depolarization (prepulse to +80 mV) to test for relief of constitutive Gβγ-mediated inhibition. Prepulse facilitation was determined by the ratio of (I Ba measured after a prepulse to +80 mV)/(I Ba measured at the second test pulse without a preceding positive prepulse). In the control condition, if there was no positive prepulse applied prior to the second test pulse, the current amplitude of Ba2+ currents was 76 ± 3%,n = 11 compared with the current measured during the first test pulse (Fig. 4 A,compare the first and second test pulses). In cells not transfected with RGS a positive prepulse did not increaseI Ba (Fig. 4 A). The test pulses ± the prepulse were completely superimposable (Fig. 4, Aand C, prepulse facilitation, 0.95 ± 0.04,n = 11). However, in cells transfected with RGS4, positive prepulses resulted in a small but reproducible and significant facilitation of I Ba (Fig. 4, B and C, prepulse facilitation, 1.13 ± 0.05,n = 15, p ≤ 0.01). The effect of RGS4 to induce constitutive inhibition of the N-type channel was probably larger than it appeared in our measurements, because in independent experiments we determined that the prepulse led only to a ∼60% release of the Gβγ-mediated inhibition of the channels. These results suggested that a Gβγ-dependent “basal” inhibition of channels was occurring in RGS4-transfected cells but not in control cells, as reflected by the increase of currents after reversal of the Gβγ-mediated inhibition by positive prepulses. These results further suggested that RGS proteins cause constitutive Gβγ signaling in HEK cells. Both the N-type Ca2+ channels as well as theI K(ACh) channels are well accepted to be direct effectors of Gβγ-subunits of pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins (38De Waard M. Liu H. Walker D. Scott V.E. Gurnett C.A. Campbell K.P. Nature. 1997; 385: 446-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 41Clapham D.E. Curr.

Chem. 1995; 270: 29059-29062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Because RGS4 in both cases induced a response that is usually mediated by Gβγ-subunits, we concluded that the expression of RGS4 increased the concentration of free Gβγ in the cell and constitutively modulated the activation state of both channels. It should be mentioned that constitutive signaling through Gβγ was not observed in previous studies where the effects of RGS proteins were assessed in systems involving Gβγ signaling. Thus, an inhibition, rather than a constitutive activation, of agonist-induced mitogen-activated protein kinase activation was observed upon coexpression of RGS1 in HS-Sultan cell lines (16Druey K.M. Blumer K.J. Kang V.H. Kehrl J.H. Nature. 1996; 379: 742-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar) or with RGS4 and SST2 in yeast (16Druey K.M. Blumer K.J. Kang V.H. Kehrl J.H.

Biol. 1995; 15: 3635-3643Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Although we have no definitive explanation for the differences between our observations and those made with the mitogen-activated protein kinase-linked systems, the different experimental conditions and the fact that the signaling cascades that lead to activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases are complex and involve considerable amplification make it difficult to compare results obtained in this system with ion channels that are directly Gβγ-modulated. It seems possible that the net effect of RGS proteins in different systems will reflect a summation of inhibitory (GAP activity) and stimulatory (increased availability of Gβγ) processes. This appears to be the case with the receptor-mediated activation of Gβγ-gated K+ channels. In all of the studies reported so far, although the kinetics of channel deactivation were increased, there was no depression of the peak currents upon expression of RGS proteins (6Doupnik C.A.

Nature. 1997; 390: 525-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) in contrast to what one would expect if the RGS proteins were solely acting as GAPs (see discussion in Ref.8Zerangue N. Jan L.Y. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: R313-R316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, in the mitogen-activated protein kinase systems studied previously (16Druey K.M. Blumer K.J. Kang V.H. Kehrl J.H. Nature. 1996; 379: 742-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar, 43Dohlman H.G. Apaniesk D. Chen Y. Song J. Nusskern D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3635-3643Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), it is not possible to know if the inhibitions observed were also influenced by stimulatory actions of RGS proteins. Several studies of intact cells have shown that RGS proteins inhibit Gi, Go, or Gq signaling (15Huang C. Hepler J.R. Gilman A.G. Mumby S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

These results could be explained by enhanced deactivation of the G proteins due to the GAP activity of RGS or by binding of RGS to Gα and consequent block of effector activation. The efficiency of RGS proteins to act as GAPs in intact cells will strongly depend on the relative affinities of RGS to the different conformations of Gα proteins. Our approach to measure basal and receptor-activated Gβγ signaling in intact cells allowed for detection of GAP effects by RGS (i.e. the acceleration of I K(ACh)kinetics) as well as for indirect detection of RGS binding to Gα proteins in the absence of agonists, by measuring basal Gβγ-induced currents. The concentration of free Gβγ will most likely be increased if RGS proteins bind to Gα proteins, because Gβγ will not be able to bind to RGS-occupied Gα-subunits (3Tesmer J.J. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1997; 89: 251-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). Assuming that the underlying mechanism for the turn off of Gβγ-mediated signaling is reassociation with the deactivated Gα-subunit, the GAP function of RGS should speed up deactivation of Gα and consequently also turn off Gβγ-mediated signals. Considering this, we speculate that the observed and previously described acceleration of I K(ACh) deactivation by RGS is because of the GAP activity of these proteins (6Doupnik C.A. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Kofuji P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10461-10466Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 7Saitoh O. Kubo Y. Miyatani Y. Asano T. Nakata H. Nature. 1997; 390: 525-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The increase of basal Gβγ signaling upon coexpression of RGS3 or RGS4 may reflect binding of RGS to a substantial portion of the Gα protein pool and a consequent decrease in the sequestering of Gβγ by Gα-subunits. Our studies report a novel effect of RGS on Gβγ signaling and suggest that in addition to causing desensitization because of GAP activity, RGS proteins may also positively impact Gβγ signaling. We gratefully acknowledge the many helpful discussions and suggestions provided by members of our laboratory, as well as frequent discussions with Heidi Hamm and her colleagues. We sincerely thank Robert Ten Eick for providing equipment for patch-clamp studies and all those who contributed reagents to help make this work possible."

To gain a clue to whether the mammalian C/EBP family of transcription factors are also involved in long term memory, we examined how C/EBP activities in hippocampal neurons can be modulated in response to cAMP and Ca2+, crucial inductive signals for memory formation. As a result, stimulation of either cAMP or Ca2+ signals in hippocampal neurons was found to enhance mRNA expressions and DNA binding activities of C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ. Furthermore, it is indicated that CaM kinases have essential roles for increasing the expression and DNA binding activities of C/EBPβ in hippocampal neurons activated by membrane depolarization. Overexpression of constitutively active calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase IV was found to directly stimulate either C/EBPβ-dependent or C/EBPδ-dependent transcription, reinforcing the evidence that C/EBP family members contribute to Ca2+-dependent transcription. Thus, these results suggest that C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ may be involved in the transcription-dependent phase of memory formation by increasing the expression of both the DNA binding and the transcriptional activities under the direction of cAMP and/or Ca2+signaling in hippocampal neurons.

Memory has two phases: short term memory and long term memory. A number of pharmacological studies have demonstrated that the stabilization of long term memory requires the synthesis of new proteins and RNAs (1Davis H.P. Squire L.R. Psychol. Bull. 1984; 96: 518-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (1268) Google Scholar, 2Matthies H. Prog. Neurobiol. 1989; 32: 277-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). This requirement suggests that transcription is critical for this process. Among a number of transcription factors expressed in neuronal cell nuclei, the Ca2+/cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB)1 has been implicated as being essential to long term memory of Aplysia, Drosophila, and mice (3Dash P.K.

Cell. 1994; 79: 59-68Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1587) Google Scholar). InAplysia, long term facilitation is a basic synaptic mechanism for a non-associative learning response. The long term synaptic modification is characterized by a consolidation period during which gene expression is required. During this phase, the transcription factor Aplysia CCAAT enhancer-binding protein (ApC/EBP) is found to be increasingly induced in response to cAMP signals (8Alberini C.M. Ghirardi M. Metz R. Kandel E.R. Cell. 1994; 76: 1099-1114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). There is a CRE site in the 5′-untranslated region of ApC/EBP, suggesting that CREB can control the expression of ApC/EBP (8Alberini C.M. Ghirardi M. Metz R. Kandel E.R. Cell. 1994; 76: 1099-1114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). Furthermore, blocking the function of ApC/EBP either by antisense oligonucleotides or by specific antibody inhibits long term facilitation selectively without affecting the short term processes (8Alberini C.M. Ghirardi M. Metz R. Kandel E.R. Cell. 1994; 76: 1099-1114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). These data indicate that induction of another transcription factor ApC/EBP by CREB is also essential for long term facilitation, in addition to CREB activation (8Alberini C.M. Ghirardi M. Metz R.

However, much less is known about the expression and function of C/EBP family members in the neurons of mammalian brain, except that C/EBPα mRNA was detected in mouse hippocampus, cerebellum, and cortex by in situ hybridization (27Kuo C.F. Xanthopoulos K.G. Darnell Jr., J.E. Development. 1990; 109: 473-481Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It was recently shown that two CRE sites in the core promoter of C/EBPβ gene are mostly recognized by CREB in liver and in several cell lines (28Niehof M. Manns M.P. Trautwein C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3600-3613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transfection experiments with promoter constructs where the CREB sites were mutated further indicated that these sites are important to maintain both basal promoter activity and C/EBPβ inducibility through CREB (28Niehof M. Manns M.P. Trautwein C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3600-3613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, in several brain regions including the hippocampus, little information is available about the induction of C/EBP family members by cAMP and Ca2+, both of which are known to activate CREB in neuronal cells such as hippocampal neurons (29Frey U.

Chen M. Bailey C.H. Kandel E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4706-4711Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). We have found that the expression and DNA binding activities of C/EBPβ and δ are enhanced by the stimulation of cAMP or Ca2+ signals in cultured hippocampal neurons. Our results also suggest that CaMKIV activated by Ca2+ signal not only induces expression of C/EBP members, but also directly enhances C/EBP-dependent gene transcriptions. Therefore, our study supports the possibility that both C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ may be involved in long term plasticity in mammalian brain. Hippocampal neuron cultures were done as described by Baranes et al. (40Baranes D. Lopez-Garcia J.C. Chen M. Bailey C.H. Kandel E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4706-4711Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). To stimulate cAMP signals, water-soluble forskolin (50 μm; Research Biochemicals International) was added to 14-day-old cultures. To induce membrane depolarization of hippocampal neurons in the culture, the cultures were treated as described by Bito et al. (33Bito H. Deisserroth K. Tsien R.W. Cell. 1996; 87: 1203-1214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar). When used, kinase inhibitor KN93 (30 μm, Calbiochem), KN92 (30 μm, Calbiochem), and KN62 (10 μm, Calbiochem) were present during the preincubation period of 30 min prior to depolarization and during depolarization. Effects of cAMP signal stimulation and membrane depolarization on gene expressions or DNA binding activities were measured 3–4 h after stimulation. Rat hippocampal neurons were grown on poly-d-lysine- and laminin-coated 12-mm glass coverslips in 35-mm dishes (Corning) under the same conditions described by Baranes et al. (40Baranes D.

Cells were washed with Tyrode's solution (37 °C) once and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde solution for 15 min at 37 °C. They were then washed with PBS three times and permeabilized with 0.25% Triton X-100 in PBS at 37 °C for 5 min, and the nonspecific bindings were blocked with 10% goat serum, 0.1% Triton X-100, 20 mm glycine in PBS at 37 °C for 30 min. Double immunolabeling was performed by incubating cells overnight with a mouse monoclonal anti-MAP2 antibody (Sigma, 1:100) and rabbit polyclonal anti-C/EBPβ or anti-C/EBPδ antibodies (Santa Cruz, 1 μg/ml). Following three washes with PBS, the cells were incubated with Cy3-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Cedarlane Laboratories Ltd, 1:100) and fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Cedarlane Laboratories Ltd, 1:100) in PBS at room temperature for 1 h. The coverslips were washed five times with PBS, mounted, and examined by fluoromicroscopy. (Sp)-cAMPS stimulation of hippocampal slices was done as described by Huang et al. (41Huang Y.Y. Li X.-C. Kandel E.R. Cell. 1994; 79: 69-79Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Hippocampal slices were incubated in perfusion solutions containing 50 μm(Sp)-cAMPS ((Sp)-cAMPS stimulation) or perfusion solutions without (Sp)-cAMPS (control) for 30 min. After 30 min of incubation, slices were maintained in the perfusion solution for 2 h. Then, RNAs were prepared from those slices for RNase protection assay. A 220-bp rat C/EBPβ cDNANcoI fragment, 342-bp mouse C/EBPβ cDNANcoI-PstI fragment covering the leucine-zipper domain, 298-bp mouse C/EBPδ cDNA NcoI-XhoI fragment, and 490-bp rat C/EBPα cDNANcoI-NotI fragment were subcloned into pBluescript SK (Stratagene). Templates for preparing Zif268 cRNA (180 bp is protected), actin cRNA (250 bp), and cyclophilin cRNA probe (100 bp) were purchased from Ambion. Antisense cRNA probes were synthesized as described previously (42Yukawa K. Yasui T. Yamamoto A. Shiku H. Kishimoto T. Kikutani H. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 133: 163-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Total RNAs were prepared from tissues or cultured hippocampal neurons using the acid phenol extraction method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (43Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar) with RNAzol™ B solution purchased from Biotecx Laboratories, Inc. and performed according to manufacturer's protocol. RNase protection assays were performed by hybridizing 25 μg of total RNA from the hippocampus or 2.5 μg of total RNA from cultured hippocampal neurons with 1 × 105 cpm of each labeled cRNA at 68 °C for more than 1 h. RNase digestion and analysis were performed as described previously (42Yukawa K. Yasui T. Yamamoto A. Shiku H. Kishimoto T. Kikutani H. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 133: 163-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). For Western blot analysis, nuclear extracts prepared from cultured hippocampal neurons for gel shift assay were used. Twenty micrograms of each sample were adjusted to give a final solution of 60 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.1% bromphenol blue, and 5% β-mercaptoethanol, heated at 100 °C for 5 min, electrophoresed through 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). C/EBPβ was detected with the ECL Western blotting detection system as instructed by the manufacturer (Amersham). The dilution factor for anti-C/EBPβ antibody was 1:100 (Santa Cruz). Nuclear extracts of mice hippocampus were prepared as described by others (30Moore A.N. Waxham M.N. Dash P.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14214-14220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) with some modifications. The tissues were homogenized (10 strokes) in four volumes of a buffer containing 0.25 m sucrose, 15 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 60 mm KCl, 15 mm NaCl, 5 mmEDTA, 1 mm EGTA, and protease inhibitors (1 × α-Complete™ from Boehringer Mannheim, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mmdithiothreitol) in a Dounce homogenizer. After centrifugation, the pelletized material was resuspended in buffer A (10 mmHEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1× α-Complete, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) by gently pipetting and kept on ice for 15 min. Nonidet P-40 was added to reach a final concentration of 0.6% and vortexed for 10 s. After centrifugation for 60 s, the nuclei were resuspended in 70 μl of buffer C (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 0.4m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1× α-Complete, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1mm dithiothreitol) and rocked on an Eppendorf shaker for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant solution after centrifugation was frozen as nuclear extract. To prepare nuclear extracts from hippocampal neurons in culture, cells were washed with Tyrode's solution once, then immersed with 300 μl of solution A, scraped, and collected into Eppendorf tubes. The following procedure is identical to the above for preparation of tissue nuclear extracts. Protein amounts were quantified by the colorimetric determination using bicinchoninic acid solution (Sigma). For electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), C/EBP consensus oligonucleotide, 5′-TGCAGATTGCGCAATCTGCA-3′ (Santa Cruz), and the core promoter sequence of C/EBPβ gene, 5′-GCGGCCGGGCAATGACGCGCACCG-3′ (28Niehof M. Manns M.P. Trautwein C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3600-3613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), were 32P-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP, using T4 polynucleotide kinase. Labeled DNA was incubated with 5 μg of nuclear extract protein at room temperature for 20 min in the binding buffer containing 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 5% glycerol, and 1 μg of poly(dI-dC). DNA-protein complexes were resolved as described previously (44Yukawa K. Butz K. Yasui T. Kikutani H. Hoppe-Seyler F. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 10-16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Supershift assays were performed as described above with the exception that, after the incubation of probes with extracts, 1 μg of antibody (TransCruz™ gel supershift antibodies to C/EBPα, β, δ, CRP1, Rb, CREB1, ATF3, and ATF4; Santa Cruz) was added and incubated for another 30 min at room temperature. Expression vectors for C/EBPβ and δ (gift from Dr. P. F. Johnson) and luciferase reporter vector with four tandem C/EBP binding sites were transfected into HeLa cells with or without the construct for expressing the constitutively active form of CaMKIV (45Sun P. Enslen H. Myung P.S. Maurer R.A. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2527-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar) through CaPO4 method (Transfection MBS mammalian transfection kit, Stratagene). Triplicate transfections were done in three independent experiments. Two days after transfection, cells were harvested for luciferase assay and their luciferase activities were examined using the Dual-luciferase™reporter assay system (Promega). In the system, the luciferase activities of the reporter were normalized to the Renillaluciferase activities from 20 ng of the cotransfected pRL-SV40 (Promega). The experimental results were represented as the mean ± S.E. of the values, which were calculated by comparing the activities of cotransfection experiments with those obtained by the transfections of the luciferase reporter vector alone. To know whether any C/EBP family member is expressed in the hippocampus, which is a crucial region for explicit memory formation in vertebrates, we examined the mRNA expressions of C/EBP members in hippocampus by performing RNase protection assay. The result indicated that C/EBPβ and δ transcripts are expressed in the mouse hippocampus (Fig. 1 A). It is also shown that C/EBPβ mRNA is more highly expressed in the mouse hippocampus than C/EBPδ mRNA (Fig. 1 A). Next, we asked which members of C/EBP family is most active in mouse hippocampus by performing EMSA using high affinity C/EBP binding site as a probe. A retarded band was observed in mouse hippocampus nuclear extracts (Fig. 1 B). With the addition of anti-C/EBPβ antibodies to the binding reaction, the result was a prominent supershift of the retarded band, which was removed by the addition of cold C/EBP binding sites as a competitor (Fig. 1 B). Antibodies to C/EBPδ and α also induced supershifts in EMSA of hippocampus, which are much weaker than the supershift induced by anti-C/EBPβ antibodies (Fig. 1 B). Addition of the antibodies to CRP1, another newly identified C/EBP member to the binding reaction could not induce any supershift in EMSA suggesting that CRP1 is not a component of hippocampal C/EBP (Fig. 1 B). Thus, we find that C/EBPβ is a prime C/EBP in the mouse hippocampus. To examine whether C/EBPβ is exactly expressed in hippocampal neurons, double immunofluorescence analyses were performed on cultured hippocampal neurons using antibodies to C/EBP family members and anti-MAP2 antibody to locate neurons. As a result, C/EBPβ was found to be specifically expressed in hippocampal neurons since positive staining was only detected in the nuclei of MAP2 positive cells (Fig. 2, A and B). C/EBPδ is also found to be expressed in some hippocampal neurons (Fig. 2, C and D). However, other neurons scarcely express C/EBPδ. C/EBPδ is found to be rather highly expressed in astrocytes, which are easily distinguished from neurons by remaining unstained by MAP2 (Fig. 2, C and D). This fact is consistent with the previous findings of others (46Yano S. Fukunaga K. Takiguchi M. Ushio Y. Mori M. Miyamoto E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23520-23527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). A small region containing two CREB sites in the C/EBPβ promoter is found to be important in controlling transcription of C/EBPβ gene in liver and several cell lines (28Niehof M. Manns M.P. Trautwein C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3600-3613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To examine the possibility that CREB can also control the expression of C/EBPβ even in hippocampus and cultured hippocampal neurons, EMSA of nuclear extracts from hippocampus and cultured hippocampal neurons were performed using the region containing first CREB site of C/EBPβ promoter as a probe. Several retarded bands could be observed in this EMSA suggesting that nuclear factors are actually binding to the region of the C/EBPβ promoter. Furthermore, the addition of CREB antibody to the EMSA reaction could induce a supershift of the major retarded band demonstrating that main binding activity to the C/EBPβ promoter region is due to CREB (Fig. 3). Further addition of cold C/EBPβ promoter probes as competitors weakened the intensity of supershifted bands, thereby demonstrating specific binding reactions in EMSA. The addition of antibodies to other ATF/CREB family members, such as activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) and activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), into the EMSA binding reaction could not supershift retarded bands. These results suggest that CREB binds to the crucial region of C/EBPβ promoter and controls the expression of C/EBPβ gene in hippocampal neurons. To know whether CREB activated by cAMP signaling can actually control the expression of C/EBPβ in hippocampal neurons, cultured hippocampal neurons were stimulated by the direct adenylate cyclase activator forskolin and changes of C/EBPβ transcripts were followed by RNase protection assay. After 4 h of exposure to forskolin, C/EBPβ mRNA was found to be prominently induced in cultured hippocampal neurons (Fig. 4 A). The increase of C/EBPβ transcript was observed even from 30 min after addition of forskolin to the culture (data not shown). Consistent with the induction of mRNA, immunoblot analysis with anti-C/EBPβ antibodies showed that the amount of both the 39- and 33-kDa form of C/EBPβ are increased 4 h after forskolin treatment of the culture (Fig. 4 B). To examine whether the increase of C/EBPβ mRNA and protein can enhance its DNA binding activity to C/EBP sites, EMSA was performed using both nuclear extract from culture treated with forskolin for 4 h and nuclear extract from control culture. Forskolin treatment of the culture was found to increase the binding of C/EBP family members to the C/EBP site in EMSA (Fig. 4 C, lanes 1 and 2). Anti-C/EBPβ antibodies induced a supershift, and the amount of these supershifted bands were greatly enhanced by forskolin treatment of the culture (Fig. 4 C). A supershift by anti-C/EBPδ antibodies was also found to be increased by forskolin treatment of the culture (Fig. 4 C). Unrelated antibodies such as anti-Rb antibodies do not induce any supershifts, and the addition of cold competitors almost erased the shifted bands demonstrating specificity of this EMSA. Thus, it is clear that binding of C/EBPβ to C/EBP binding sites is intensified in cultured hippocampal neurons after forskolin treatment. (Sp)-cAMPS is known to stimulate cAMP signaling in hippocampal slices (29Frey U. Huang Y.-Y. Kandel E.R. Science. 1993; 260: 1661-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar, 41Huang Y.Y. Li X.-C. Kandel E.R. Cell. 1994; 79: 69-79Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar), which preserve the anatomical relation of neurons in the intact hippocampus. To examine whether stimulation of cAMP signaling can induce the mRNA expression of C/EBP family members even in hippocampal slices, rat and mouse hippocampal slices were treated with (Sp)-cAMPS for 30 min. Two hours after the 30 min of (Sp)-cAMPS treatment, RNAs were prepared from slices and used for RNase protection assay. Both C/EBPβ and δ mRNAs were induced by (Sp)-cAMPS in mouse hippocampal slices (Fig. 5 A). In rat slices, both C/EBPβ and α mRNAs are induced after (Sp)-cAMPS treatment (Fig. 5 B). Thus, the increase of C/EBPβ and δ mRNA can be induced by the stimulation of cAMP signaling pathway, even in hippocampal slices. This result suggests that cAMP signal can induce mRNA expressions of C/EBP family members in intact neurons of hippocampal slices. Previous studies indicated that Ca2+/calmodulin (CaM)-regulated systems can control CREB activity in hippocampal neurons (32Deisserroth K. Bito H. Tsien R.W. Neuron. 1996; 16: 89-101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar, 33Bito H. Deisserroth K. Tsien R.W.

Neuroscience. 1996; 70: 1053-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Our EMSA, which uses core promoter sequence of C/EBPβ gene as a probe, suggests that CREB can control the expression of C/EBPβ in hippocampal neurons (Fig. 3). Given that the expression of C/EBPβ can be controlled by CREB, C/EBPβ activity is predicted to be enhanced by Ca2+ signals in hippocampal neurons. To examine this possibility, hippocampal neurons in cultures were subjected to membrane depolarization by incubating them with high K+ solution for 5 s (33Bito H. Deisserroth K. Tsien R.W. Cell. 1996; 87: 1203-1214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar). Four hours after membrane depolarization, nuclear extracts were prepared from both depolarized neurons and control neurons incubated with normal Tyrode's solution. EMSA using a C/EBP binding site as a probe showed that the DNA binding activity of C/EBPβ is augmented by membrane depolarization of hippocampal neurons (Fig. 6 A). The DNA binding activity of C/EBPδ is also found to be enhanced by membrane depolarization (Fig. 6 A). The increase of C/EBPβ mRNA was observed in hippocampal neurons 4 h after membrane depolarization, suggest"

CPE has been shown to bind to an amino-terminal peptide of pro-opiomelanocortin (N-POMC) at pH 5.5 and hypothesized to be critically involved in the targeting of hormones such as POMC to the regulated secretory pathway [Cool, D.

To further explore the possibility that CPE serves to mediate the association of content proteins with the membrane during granule biogenesis, the binding of CPE to granule content proteins was investigated using anin vitro aggregation assay in which the selective precipitation of granule content proteins is induced by titration of the pH to <6.0. CPE was observed to co-aggregate efficiently with pituitary and chromaffin granule content proteins at concentrations well below those that promote its self-aggregation. In addition, CPE co-precipitated at pH 5.8 with purified prolactin and with insulin, which homophillically self-aggregate yet are structurally distinct from N-POMC. N-POMC when added to the assays did not inhibit the aggregation of CPE with prolactin or insulin, indicating that these interactions do not involve a binding site for N-POMC. The data show that CPE interacts at acidic pH with a variety of different content proteins, resembling in this regard other granule membrane proteins. The results support the idea that co-aggregation of abundant membrane proteins with content proteins is an important general mechanism for the sorting and retention of secretory granule proteins during granule maturation.

Aggregation of secretory granule proteins occurs as immature secretory granules (ISGs)1are formed from the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and continue to mature and acidify (1Jamieson J.D. Palade G.E. J.

Aggregation can also be achieved by lowering the pH of isolated granule contents, including those derived from chromaffin and anterior pituitary granules (3Colomer V. Kicska G.A. Rindler M.J. J.

Constitutively secreted proteins such as albumin and IgG, when added to content proteins, do not precipitate, suggesting that the formation of aggregates itself may directly regulate the process of segregating constitutively secreted proteins from granule content proteins (3Colomer V. Kicska G.A. Rindler M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 48-55Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated that the luminal domains of several abundant granule membrane proteins can co-aggregate with content proteins at pH 5.5–6 (3Colomer V. Kicska G.A. Rindler M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 48-55Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), which mimics the conditions existing in the ISG, a site where sorting of proteins destined for storage from those constitutively secreted is known to occur (11Kuliawat R. Arvan P. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 521-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 12Grimes M. Kelly R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 539-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 13Castle A.M.

This would be consistent with the idea that membrane and content proteins use similar routes of segregation during granule maturation and that the binding of content proteins to the granule membranes is mediated by the major membrane proteins themselves. Recently, Cool et al. (14Cool D.R. Normant E. Shen F. Chen H.C. Pannell L. Zhang Y. Loh Y.P. Cell. 1997; 88: 73-83Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar) showed that pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) as well as a peptide consisting of its amino-terminal 26 amino acids (N-POMC) bind to pituitary secretory granule membranes with a pH optimum of 5.5–6. This peptide was chosen because the amino-terminal portion of POMC can confer granule targeting on heterologous proteins in transfected cells (15Tam W.W.H. Andreasson K.I. Loh Y.P. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 62: 294-306PubMed Google Scholar). The binding of N-POMC to membranes was inhibited not only by POMC itself but by proinsulin and proenkephalin, suggesting that common sites of association are used by several different hormones. N-POMC could also be cross-linked at pH 5.5 to carboxypeptidase E (CPE), an abundant granule membrane protein (14Cool D.R. Normant E. Shen F. Chen H.C. Pannell L. Zhang Y. Loh Y.P. Cell. 1997; 88: 73-83Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar), suggesting that POMC binding to membranes was mediated by CPE. Moreover, in cells depleted of CPE, either from the pituitary of fat/fat mice, which bear a mutation in CPE that prevents its exit from the endoplasmic reticulum (16Naggert J.K. Fricker L.D. Varlamov O. Nishina P.M. Rouille Y. Steiner D.F. Carroll R.J. Paigen B.J. Leiter E.H. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 135-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar, 17Varlamov O. Leiter E.H. Fricker L. J.

Normant E. Shen F. Chen H.C. Pannell L. Zhang Y. Loh Y.P. Cell. 1997; 88: 73-83Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). These data were interpreted to mean that CPE serves as the sorting receptor for POMC and other related prohormones, although the hypothesis remains controversial as proinsulin incorporation into secretory granules was not greatly affected in either isolated islets or an insulin-secreting cell line derived from fat/fat mice (18Irminger J.C.

Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1988; 50: 309-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). It associates with membranes at low pH by virtue of an amphipathic helix in its carboxyl terminus (21Fricker L.D. Das B. Angeletti R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2476-2482Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), resembling in this regard other processing enzymes such as prohormone convertase 2, which has a membrane binding domain in its amino terminus (22Shennan K.I.J. Taylor N.A. Docherty K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18646-18650Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CPE undergoes homophillic self-association at pH 5.5 when present at high concentrations (23Song L. Fricker L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7963-7967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), another property shared by prohormone convertase 2 (22Shennan K.I.J. Taylor N.A. Docherty K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18646-18650Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and by the luminal segment of peptidyl glycine α-amidating mono-oxygenase (3Colomer V. Kicska G.A. Rindler M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 48-55Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In the current study, we have evaluated the interaction of CPE with granule content proteins using low pH-induced aggregation as an assay. The results indicate that CPE has the capacity to interact with granule content proteins other than prohormones as pH is titrated to the range of the TGN and ISG. Thus, in its ability to interact with content proteins, CPE resembles other membrane-associated proteins including peptidyl glycine α-amidating mono-oxygenase, dopamine β-hydroxylase, and pancreatic glycoprotein 2 (3Colomer V. Kicska G.A. Rindler M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 48-55Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 5Colomer V. Lal K. Hoops T.C. Rindler M.J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3711-3719Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), suggesting that these interactions are important in the segregation of granule membrane and content proteins during granule formation and maturation. Purified bovine CPE (mixture of membrane forms) and rabbit antibodies specific for the amino- and carboxyl-terminal peptides were generously provided by Dr. L. Fricker (Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY) and were prepared as reported previously (23Song L. Fricker L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7963-7967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Rabbit antibodies to chromogranin B (CgB) were a gift from Dr. R. Angeletti (Albert Einstein College of Medicine). Rabbit IgG, bovine insulin, and ovine prolactin (Prl) were purchased from Sigma. Human growth hormone (GH) was obtained from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases National Hormone and Pituitary Program, whereas rabbit antibody was purchased from Accurate Chemical (Westbury, NY). N-POMC, synthesized by Phoenix Pharmaceuticals (Mountain View, CA), was a gift from Dr. Y.-P. Loh (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Bovine adrenal chromaffin and pituitary granules were prepared as described previously (3Colomer V. Kicska G.A. Rindler M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 48-55Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Granules were lysed by freeze-thawing and sonication in 100 mm KCl, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, in the presence of protease inhibitors. The released content proteins were recovered from the supernatant after centrifugation and desalted on Bio-Gel P-6 DG columns (Bio-Rad). The assay was conducted as described previously (3Colomer V. Kicska G.A. Rindler M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 48-55Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In brief, 50-μl samples containing granule content or the proteins of interest in 5 mm HEPES, 10 mm 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid, pH 7.5, and 0.016% Triton X-100, with KCl or CaCl2 where indicated, were centrifuged for 30 min, and the pellet was discarded. The supernatants were then titrated slowly to the indicated pH values by adding 0.125n HCl while vortexing. The pH was measured with a microelectrode (Microelectrodes Inc., Bedford, NH). CPE was generally used at a concentration of 1.3 μg/ml, which is well below the threshold necessary to induce self-aggregation at this pH (23Song L. Fricker L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7963-7967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). GEMSA (Calbiochem) was added in some experiments after the prespin and 20 min before pH titration. After incubation for 30 min at 23 °C., the reaction mixture was centrifuged to separate the precipitates from the supernatant fractions. Centrifugation in most cases was for 30 min at 15,000 × g in an Eppendorf centrifuge. In experiments in which adrenal chromaffin extracts were incubated in the presence of calcium, centrifugation was conducted at 56,000 × g in a TL100 ultracentrifuge, which is required for efficient recovery of CgA (3Colomer V. Kicska G.A. Rindler M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 48-55Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). CPE aggregation itself could be induced at concentrations of 40 μg/ml, with pellets recovered by centrifugation at 100,000 ×g as described (23Song L. Fricker L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7963-7967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). A portion of the supernatant and the entire pellet fractions were then subjected to immunoblotting (see below). As a control, samples were subjected to pH titration but not centrifuged. Under the conditions used, the amounts of protein remaining in the tubes after removal of the assay mixture were inconsequential (data not shown). Triton X-100 at 0.016% had no effect on overall aggregation of pituitary or adrenal extracts but did prevent binding of CPE itself to the tubes. To measure insulin aggregation, pellets and supernatants from triplicate samples were subjected to a Micro-BCA assay (Pierce), as described previously (3Colomer V. Kicska G.A. Rindler M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 48-55Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). To assess the effect of N-POMC on CPE aggregation with Prl or insulin, a modification of the assay protocol was used. The final sample volume was reduced to 25 μl, and a buffer of 5 mm HEPES, 20 mm 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid, 130 mm KCl, and 0.016% Triton X-100 was used. After the prespin, N-POMC (120 μg/ml final concentration) or an equivalent volume of 5 mm HEPES was added, and after a 15-min incubation the pH was reduced to 5.8. After an additional 30 min at 37 °C, centrifugation was conducted at 100,000 × g for 30 min. This protocol allowed titration of the amount of hormone necessary to induce reproducible CPE co-aggregation to 40 μg/ml for insulin and 80 μg/ml for Prl. The aggregation of Prl and insulin was essentially identical at 23 and 37 °C (data not shown). Immunoblotting was performed after SDS-PAGE, transfer of the proteins to nitrocellulose paper, and staining with Ponceau S to visualize the transferred proteins. In experiments in which IgG was used, SDS-PAGE was performed without a reducing agent. Antibodies directed against the amino terminus of CPE were used in the experiments shown, but carboxyl-terminal antibodies were used in initial experiments with the identical results. All antibodies were generally used at a 1:500–1:2000 dilution. The enhanced chemiluminescence procedure was used with preflashed film to visualize the reactive species (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The exposed radiographs and the images of gels stained with Ponceau S were digitized (LACIE Ltd., Beaverton, CA) and imported into Quark Express (Denver, CO) for computerized labeling and printing of figures. Quantitation of aggregation on the scanned images was conducted using NIH Image (version 1.55) on exposures that were not oversaturated. All of the data presented are representative experiments that were repeated two to four times with similar results. The assays of CPE activity were performed using the method of Fricker and Devi (24Fricker L.D. Devi L. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 184: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In brief, purified CPE was diluted (1:500) in 0.1 m NaOAc, pH 5.5, 0.01% Triton X-100, 10 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 1 mmCoCl2 and incubated at 4 °C. for 20 min in the presence or absence of 0.5 μm GEMSA. Dansyl-FAR (20 μm) was then added, and the reaction was allowed to continue for 7 min at 37 °C and 5 min. at 4 °C before addition of HCl (0.15 m final concentration) and chloroform. After centrifugation, samples were read in a Perkin-Elmer 650-10S fluorescence spectrophotometer using excitation and emission wavelengths of 355 and 500 nm, respectively. All assays were conducted in triplicate. CPE is an endogenous protein of the pituitary gland (20Fricker L.D. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1988; 50: 309-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar) and was readily detectable in granule content prepared from bovine pituitary (Fig. 1). To assess whether CPE could interact with pituitary content proteins, an in vitro aggregation assay was used (3Colomer V. Kicska G.A. Rindler M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 48-55Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). This assay allows the measurement of weak but specific protein-protein interactions at mildly acidic pH that are difficult to detect by more direct procedures. The pH of pituitary extracts was slowly acidified, and CPE was detected by immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 1, CPE aggregated effectively (>90%) at pH 5.8 but remained almost entirely in the unaggregated supernatant at pH 7.5. Similarly, as we have previously demonstrated (3Colomer V. Kicska G.A. Rindler M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 48-55Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), other pituitary content proteins, including Prl and GH, aggregate as the pH is reduced. This observation was not a consequence of the homophillic self-aggregation of CPE, which is known to occur at pH 5.5 and high concentrations of protein (23Song L. Fricker L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7963-7967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). CPE alone at levels (1.3 μg/ml) comparable with those present endogenously (1.5 μg/ml estimated from densitometric scanning) in the pituitary samples (Fig. 1, comparelanes 2 and 10), did not aggregate either at pH 7.5 or pH 5.8 (≤1% in this experiment, never >6% in any experiment). However, addition of exogenous CPE (membrane form) to the pituitary extract led to the precipitation (>90%) of both endogenous and exogenous CPE (Fig. 1, lanes 7 and 8). Quantitative assessment of CPE aggregation in the pH range 5.4–7.5 is shown in Fig. 1 (right panel). CPE aggregation was more efficient than that of Prl and GH with a half-maximal value ∼6.0. Although our gel system did not completely separate the different forms, much of the endogenous CPE would be expected to be in a soluble form lacking its amphipathic membrane anchor (23Song L. Fricker L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7963-7967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Thus, the data indicate that both soluble and membrane forms have the ability to co-aggregate with content proteins in this assay. CPE was also detectable in the adrenal granule extracts but at much lower levels (Fig. 2). Surprisingly, both endogenous CPE and exogenously added CPE were recovered primarily (>70% in this experiment) in the pellet fractions when the pH of the chromaffin granule content was titrated to 5.8 even in the absence of CaCl2, which is required for the aggregation of the major content protein CgA (Fig. 2, lanes 3, 4, 9, and 10). Bands on the gels corresponding to CgB, however, were detected in the pH 5.8 pellet fractions both by Ponceau staining (Fig. 2, bottom) and by immunoblotting (data not shown), as were unidentified high molecular weight proteins (Fig. 2,arrowheads). As expected, CPE itself did not undergo appreciable aggregation when incubated alone at pH 7.5 or pH 5.8 in the presence or absence of CaCl2, and neither the endogenous nor the added CPE was recovered in the pellet fractions at pH 7.5. Similar results were obtained even when the centrifugation was performed at 15,000 × g, which was used to generate the quantitative assessment of CPE aggregation shown in Fig. 2(bottom right). The half-maximal value for aggregation of CPE was ∼5.8 in the adrenal extracts under these conditions. Thus, CPE is able to interact with aggregating chromaffin granule content proteins, perhaps including CgB. The interaction of CPE with granule content proteins was not dependent on its enzymatic activity. GEMSA, an inhibitor of CPE (24Fricker L.D. Devi L. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 184: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), which at this concentration (0.5 μm) decreased the activity of purified CPE by >95% (data not shown), had no effect on the co-aggregation of CPE together with pituitary content proteins (Fig. 3 A). Moreover, the interaction of CPE with granule content proteins occurred just as readily at physiological salt concentrations. Inclusion of 140 mm KCl in the reaction mixture had no effect on the extent of CPE aggregation (Fig. 3 B). Similar results were obtained in two separate experiments with >95% aggregation of CPE occurring under each set of conditions at pH 5.8. Similar results were obtained for CPE aggregation in adrenal extracts (Fig. 4). GEMSA did not affect aggregation of CPE significantly (mean, 65%; range, 61–68% for control versus 63%; range, 56–69% for GEMSA;n = 2). The addition of KCl did lower the efficiency of aggregation somewhat, but the effects were small, with the amount of CPE in the pellets decreasing from 74% without salt to 65% with KCl (Fig. 4) or from 42 to 32% in another experiment (data not shown). Prolactin is the major component of the pituitary granule extracts. We have previously shown that Prl self-aggregates as the pH is titrated to <6.5 (3Colomer V. Kicska G.A. Rindler M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 48-55Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). It was therefore of interest to determine whether CPE and Prl could interact directly. CPE was incubated with Prl as the pH was titrated to 5.8. As shown in Fig. 5, in the absence of Prl, CPE did not aggregate appreciably (≤4%) at either pH (lanes 1 and 3), whereas in the presence of Prl, CPE was recovered almost exclusively in the supernatant at pH 7.5 (99%) and in the pellet at pH 5.8 (mean, 95%; range, 94–97%;n = 2) together with Prl (mean, 47%; range, 42–52;n = 2). This interaction also was observed in the presence of 140 mm KCl (data not shown), indicating that the interaction is relatively strong. The interaction of CPE with insulin, another hormone that undergoes self-aggregation at acidic pH (8Steiner D.F. Nature. 1973; 243: 528-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), was also assessed. Insulin aggregates effectively as pH is titrated to <6.5. In fact, >99% of insulin is recovered in the pellet fraction at pH 5.8 under our standard assay conditions (data not shown). It proved necessary, however, to include 140 mm KCl in the assay mixtures to effectively prevent IgG, a marker of the constitutive secretory pathway, from co-aggregating to some extent. Fig. 6 shows the results of an experiment in which CPE and IgG were mixed with insulin. In the absence of insulin, CPE did not aggregate significantly at either pH (Fig. 6, lanes 1 and 3), whereas in the presence of insulin, CPE was recovered exclusively in the supernatant at pH 7.5 (Fig. 6, lane 5) and at pH 5.8 (Fig. 6, lane 7), primarily in the pellet (81 ± 6%; n = 3). IgG remained almost entirely in the supernatant even in the presence of insulin (Fig. 6,lanes 5 and 7, bottom panels). The amount of insulin aggregation could not be directly quantitated using SDS-PAGE. However, in experiments conducted in the absence of added CPE and measuring total protein recoveries, 64 ± 3% (n = 3) of insulin was found in the pellet fraction under these assay conditions. As noted in the Introduction, CPE has been shown to bind to a peptide corresponding to the amino-terminal 26 amino acids of POMC at pH 5.5 (14Cool D.R. Normant E. Shen F. Chen H.C. Pannell L. Zhang Y. Loh Y.P. Cell. 1997; 88: 73-83Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). The question therefore arises of whether CPE has a single binding site capable of interacting with a number of different hormones, including Prl and insulin. To test this hypothesis, N-POMC was included in the assays together with CPE before pH titration. To maximize the ratio of the peptide to the precipitating hormones, much lower amounts of insulin (40 μg/ml) and Prl (80 μg/ml) were used, and the assay protocol was modified to recover a higher proportion of the aggregates (see “Experimental Procedures”). Fig. 7 shows that under these conditions CPE when incubated alone remained in the supernatant fraction (≤6%) in the presence or absence of N-POMC (top panel). In the presence of insulin (Fig. 7, middle panel), CPE aggregated well in the absence or presence of the peptide (88 versus80%, respectively, in this experiment; 95 versus 97% in a second experiment). Similarly, in the presence of Prl (Fig. 7,bottom panel) the amount of CPE recovered in the pellet was not affected by N-POMC (56 without versus 59% with peptide in this experiment; 86 versus 93% in a second experiment). It should be pointed out that N-POMC was present in ∼5-fold molar excess in the case of insulin, ∼11-fold in the case of Prl, and in >1500-fold excess of CPE itself. Hence we conclude that the sites of interaction of CPE with Prl and insulin are distinct from any involved in its binding to N-POMC. Acidification is thought to play a critical role in secretory granule formation. Incubation of secretory cells with high concentrations of lysosomotropic amines (2Orci L. Ravazzola M. Amherdt M.

Cell Biol. 1993; 62: 127-139PubMed Google Scholar), an inhibitor of vacuolar ATPases, leads to inefficient packaging of granule content proteins as well as inefficient prohormone processing and ISG maturation. The aggregation of CPE with granule proteins from pituitary and adrenal gland is a measure of its ability to bind to content proteins and is consistent with a role for acidic pH in the interaction of content proteins with the membrane during granule formation. The pH dependence in vitro is consistent with initiation of aggregation in the environment of the TGN (5.9–6.2) (30Demaurex N. Furuya W. D'Souza S. Bonifacino J.S. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2044-2051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar,31Miesenbock G. De Angelis D.A. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1998; 394: 192-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (1943) Google Scholar), with the process continuing even more vigorously in ISGs (5.5–6) (2Orci L. Ravazzola M. Amherdt M. Madsen O. Perrelet A. Vassalli J.D. Anderson R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2273-2281Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Given the fact that the concentrations of content proteins are much higher (>100 mg/ml) in secretory granules than those used in our assay, 2M. Rindler, unpublished observation. it is reasonable to propose that stronger and more significant interactions between CPE and granule content proteins would take place in vivo in the TGN, where protein concentration would also be expected to be high. An unexpected observation was that CPE aggregated well in the chromaffin granule extracts in the absence of added calcium at pH 5.8. CgB and higher molecular weight components were also present in the precipitates, and we have previously shown that dopamine β-hydroxylase partially aggregates under these conditions (∼50% of the calcium induced precipitation) (3Colomer V. Kicska G.A. Rindler M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 48-55Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The formation of aggregates containing content and membrane components during acidification of the secretory organelles, as occurs in vitro, is consistent with a pH-dependent protein sorting mechanism involving condensation of granule components. Indeed, these findings are consistent with the observations made in streptolysin-permeabilized PC12 cells, in which neutralization of pH interfered with the sorting of chromogranin C to secretory granules (32Carnell L. Moore H.-P.H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 693-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). As noted in the Introduction, CPE has been postulated to be a “sorting receptor” having a direct role in chaperoning certain hormones to secretory granules (14Cool D.R. Normant E. Shen F. Chen H.C. Pannell L. Zhang Y. Loh Y.P. Cell. 1997; 88: 73-83Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 33Shen F.S. Loh Y.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5314-5319Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Evidence that N-POMC can be directly cross-linked to CPE in granule membranes was interpreted as reflecting a receptor-ligand interaction. Because N-POMC has a disulfide loop that is also found in other prohormones such as proenkephalin and proinsulin, and these prohormones inhibit the binding of N-POMC to granule membranes, a common binding site in CPE for this type of motif was postulated to mediate the sorting of these proteins (14Cool D.R. Normant E. Shen F. Chen H.C. Pannell L. Zhang Y. Loh Y.P. Cell. 1997; 88: 73-83Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). The interaction of CPE with additional granule content proteins, as shown in this study, would be consistent with a role for CPE as a broad spectrum chaperone that could mediate the interaction of a variety of content proteins with membranes during granule biogenesis, particularly as aggregation was occurring. It is important to note, however, that the binding of CPE to Prl, which is structurally unrelated to POMC, and to insulin, which lacks the C peptide and does not have a complete disulfide loop, was unaffected by N-POMC, indicating that CPE has more than one binding site for content proteins. Recent studies using pancreatic islets (18Irminger J.C. Verchere C.B. Meyer K. Halban P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27532-27534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) or insulin-secreting cell lines derived from fat/fat mice (19Varlamov O. Fricker L.D. Furukawa H. Steiner D.F. Langley S.H. Leiter E.H. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 4883-4892Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) contradict the view that CPE is critical for peptide hormone storage. In both cases, constitutive release of proinsulin was not enhanced in cells with defective CPE, whereas regulated secretion of partially processed insulin and proinsulin remained robust, and immature-looking secretory granules were also present (16Naggert J.K. Fricker L.D. Varlamov O. Nishina P.M. Rouille Y. Steiner D.F. Carroll R.J. Paigen B.J. Leiter E.H. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 135-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar, 19Varlamov O. Fricker L.D. Furukawa H. Steiner D.F. Langley S.H. Leiter E.H. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 4883-4892Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). These results indicate that CPE is not required for proinsulin targeting but is necessary for processing and condensation. Given the conflicting observations, what is the significance of the specific interactions of CPE with granule proteins, and what role might these interactions play, if any, in promoting content protein storage? Noteworthy in this regard is the fact that a number of other membrane proteins share with CPE the ability to bind content proteins at pH 5.5–6. These include dopamine β-hydroxylase, which co-precipitates with chromaffin granule content proteins (3Colomer V. Kicska G.A. Rindler M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 48-55Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), peptidyl glycine α-amidating mono-oxygenase, which co-aggregates with chromaffin and pituitary granule content (3Colomer V. Kicska G.A. Rindler M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 48-55Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), glycoprotein 2, which specifically co-aggregates with pancreatic zymogens (5Colomer V. Lal K. Hoops T.C. Rindler M.J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3711-3719Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and binds polymerized amylase (34Jacob M. Laine J. LeBel D. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1992; 70: 1105-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), and an inositol triphosphate receptor/calcium channel, which has been reported to bind to CgA at acidic pH (35Yoo S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12001-12006Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, several granule membrane proteins self-aggregate at acidic pH. One is CPE (23Song L. Fricker L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7963-7967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and another is prohormone convertase 2 (22Shennan K.I.J. Taylor N.A. Docherty K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18646-18650Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which also have amphipathic helices that mediate their membrane binding. The integral membrane proteins peptidyl glycine α-amidating mono-oxygenase (3Colomer V. Kicska G.A. Rindler M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 48-55Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and glycoprotein 2 (36Freedman S.D. Scheele G.A. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 61: 229-238PubMed Google Scholar) can self-associate as well. The association of membrane proteins with themselves and perhaps their neighbors in the plane of the membrane could provide a scaffold for the binding and envelopment of aggregating content proteins in the TGN and ISG. The specific interaction of CPE with some granule content proteins and with other membrane-associated processing enzymes, as has been reported (37Palmer D.J. Christie D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19806-19812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is consistent with this model. Hence processing enzymes, which represent major granule membrane components (38Winkler H. J. Anat. 1993; 183: 237-252PubMed Google Scholar), could subserve roles both in peptide hormone generation and, in concert with other major membrane proteins, as the “receptors” for the selective membrane recruitment, segregation, and retention of content proteins as their aggregation is initiated by acidic pH. In pancreatic beta cells, depletion of a single membrane component such as CPE may have little effect, but in other cell types, such as neuro 2A, CPE may represent a higher proportion of the membrane proteins and potentially could play a more significant role.

https://openalex.org/W2051901482,"The glycosaminoglycan heparin enhances several reactions involving coagulation factor XI (FXI) including activation of FXI by factor XIIa, thrombin, and autoactivation; and inactivation of activated FXI (FXIa) by serine protease inhibitors. We examined the effect of heparin on inhibition of FXIa by the inhibitors C1-inhibitor (C1-INH) and antithrombin III (ATIII). Second order rate constants for inhibition in the absence of heparin were 1.57 × 10<sup>3</sup> and 0.91 × 10<sup>3</sup>m<sup>−1</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> for C1-INH and ATIII, respectively. Therapeutic heparin concentrations (0.1–1.0 units/ml) enhanced inhibition by ATIII 20–55-fold compared with 0.1–7.0-fold for C1-INH. For both inhibitors, the effect of heparin over a wide range of concentrations (10<sup>−1</sup> to 10<sup>5</sup> units/ml) produced bell-shaped curves, demonstrating that inhibition occurs by a template mechanism requiring both inhibitor and protease to bind to heparin. This implies that FXI/XIa contains structural elements that interact with heparin. Human FXI contains a sequence of amino acids (R<sup>250</sup>-I-K-K-S-K) in the apple 3 domain of the heavy chain that binds heparin (Ho, D., Badellino, K., Baglia, F., and Walsh, P. (1998) <i>J. Biol. Chem.</i> 273, 16382–16390). To determine the importance of this sequence to heparin-mediated reactions, recombinant FXI molecules with alanine substitutions for basic amino acids were expressed in 293 fibroblasts, and tested in heparin-dependent assays. Inhibition of FXIa by ATIII in the presence of heparin was decreased 4-fold by alanine substitution at Lys<sup>253</sup> (A253), with smaller effects noted for mutants A255 and A252. FXI undergoes autoactivation to FXIa in the presence of heparin. The rate of autoactivation was decreased substantially for A253 with modest decreases for A255 and A252. Substituting all four charged residues in the sequence resulted in a profound decrease in autoactivation, significantly greater than for any single substitution. Relative affinity for heparin was tested by determining the concentration of NaCl required to elute FXIa from heparin-Sepharose. Wild type FXIa eluted from the column at 320 mm NaCl, whereas FXIa with multiple substitutions (A252–254 or A250–255) eluted at 230 mm NaCl. All proteins with single substitutions in charged amino acids eluted at intermediate NaCl concentrations. The data indicate that FXI/XIa must bind to heparin for optimal inhibition by ATIII and for autoactivation. Lys<sup>253</sup> is the most important amino acid involved in binding, and Lys<sup>255</sup> and Lys<sup>252</sup> also have roles in interactions with heparin."

Spermatogenesis is a complex process requiring the coordinate expression of a number of genes. One of these, ldhc, encodes the testis-specific isozyme of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH-C4).1 The kinetic properties and enzyme-substrate interactions (1Blanco A. Acad. Nac. Cien. 1991; 84: 1-34Google Scholar) suggest that LDH-C4 is uniquely suited for satisfying the metabolic requirements of differentiating germ cells and functional spermatozoa.Ldhc is one of several genes that are expressed at various stages of spermatogenesis and either encode unique proteins or produce mRNAs specific to male germ cells (2Goldberg E. J. Androl. 1996; 17: 628-632PubMed Google Scholar). A clone containing the 5′-flanking region of the murine ldhc gene was isolated from a mouse genomic library. There are no permanent cell lines available for promoter analysis in male germ cells, and reliable methods for transfecting primary germ cells have not been developed. We have been able to circumvent this problem successfully with an in vitro transcription assay. Promoter activity was demonstrated within a 720-bp fragment by in vitro transcription assays in testis nuclear extract. Liver nuclear extracts significantly repressedldhc promoter activity in this assay system. Analysis of a series of deletion mutants revealed that a 60-bp core promoter sequence was sufficient to direct basal, testis-specific transcription (3Zhou W. Xu J. Goldberg E. Biol.

To confirm these findings, a genomic fragment containing approximately 100 bp immediately upstream from the transcription start site was isolated and linked to the Escherichia coli lacZ reporter gene. We report that this genomic fragment drives testis-specific β-galactosidase expression in transgenic mice. We conclude that transcription of the transgene is restricted to leptotene-pachytene-stage primary spermatocytes, even though endogenous LDH-C4 increases in concentration during spermatogenesis. Two constructs containing murine ldhc promoter sequences were designed to direct expression of lacZ. A 720-bp mouse ldhc fragment (−710 to +12) for construct 100Hβ was amplified by PCR as described previously (3Zhou W. Xu J. Goldberg E. Biol. Reprod. 1994; 51: 425-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Similarly, the 700-bp fragment for construct 100ΔHβ was amplified as described in Zhou and Goldberg (4Zhou W. Goldberg E. Biol. Reprod. 1996; 54: 84-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). These two PCR products were subcloned into the blunted EcoRI site of the pNAssβ vector from CLONTECH (GenBank accession number U02433) to create constructs: 100Hβ (wild type promoter), and 100ΔHβ (mutant promoter). These two plasmid DNAs were digested with KpnI and HindIII. The 4-kilobase fragments that contain a 100-bp promoter linked to the lacZ gene were purified from agarose following electrophoresis and injected into the pronucleus of fertilized single-cell stage CD-1 eggs. Integration of the transgene was determined by Southern blot hybridization using a 1.4-kilobase fragment from the β-galactosidase gene as a probe. Subsequently, screening was done by PCR on genomic DNA isolated from mouse tails using two oligonucleotides derived from the lacZ gene. Tissues were dissected and stained for expression of β-galactosidase using the method described by Langford et al. (5Langford K.G. Shai S.-Y. Howard T.E. Kovac M.J. Overbeek P.A. Bernstein K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15559-15562Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the tissues were fixed for 2 h at 4 °C in 0.1 m sodium phosphate (pH 7.3) containing 2% paraformaldehyde, 0.01% sodium deoxycholate, 0.02% Nonidet P-40, and 0.2% glutaraldehyde. After three washes in 0.1m sodium phosphate (pH 7.3), 2 mmMgCl2, 0.01% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.02% Nonidet P-40, the tissues were incubated overnight in X-gal staining solution, including 0.1 m sodium phosphate, 1.3 mmMgCl2, 3 mm K3Fe(CN)6, 3 mm K4Fe(CN)6, and 1 mg/ml X-gal. To examine the distribution of the transgene histologically, testes were frozen rapidly and mounted onto optimal cutting temperature compound. 20 μm sections were cut on a Cryostat and fixed briefly in 2% paraformaldehyde solution. After incubation in X-gal, the sections were counterstained with hematoxylin. The enzyme activity for β-galactosidase was measured using the Galacto-light kit (Tropix Inc). The tissues were homogenized in 0.1m potassium phosphate (pH 7.8) containing 0.2% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin. The tissue debris were removed by brief centrifugation. The concentration of the protein was determined by the Bio-Rad assay; equal amounts of protein from various tissues were used to detect enzyme activity. Testes were removed from adult mice and decapsulated prior to fixation in Bouin's solution. Fixed tissues were embedded in paraffin, sectioned, and stained with a rabbit anti-β-galactosidase antibody (1:500) or anti-mouse LDH-C4 antibody (1:1000) using the Histostain-SP Kit according to the manufacturer (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) instructions. To determine the pattern of expression of the ldhc gene in transgenic mice, a 100-bp genomic fragment in pNAssβ was purified for microinjection into the pronuclei of single cell fertilized CD-1 mouse eggs. This genomic fragment contains the core promoter sequence, including the 31-bp palindrome that was found to be necessary for testis-specific expression (3Zhou W. Xu J. Goldberg E. Biol. Reprod. 1994; 51: 425-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The transgene constructs are illustrated in Fig. 1 A. The 100 Hβ construct contains a nearly 100-bp fragment (−83/+12) linked to the lacZ gene. Another construct, 100ΔHβ was made by removing most of the palindromic sequence (Fig. 1 B). Four founder 100Hβ transgenic lines (407, 279, 280, and 281) were identified by Southern blot and by PCR of tail DNA. Two lines (282 and 283) integrated construct 100ΔHβ. Expression of the transgene was detected initially by soaking tissues in solutions containing the β-galactosidase substrate, X-gal. Three of four lines from construct 100Hβ and one of two lines from 100ΔHβ expressed thelacZ gene only in the testis, where blue staining was observed in the seminiferous tubules of the transgenic mice, not in nontransgenic littermates (Fig. 2). None of the other tissues from transgenic mice showed β-gal activity in this assay. The expression levels differ by three orders of magnitude with line 407 showing the most abundant activity with a nearly uniform staining pattern, whereas line 283 had the lowest level of β-gal activity with a spotty staining pattern (Fig. 2 C). Because line 407 showed the highest expression of the transgene, it was analyzed in greater detail. The tissue specificity of the reporter gene is shown in Fig. 3 A by a β-galactosidase enzyme activity assay. A high level of enzyme activity was detected only in testis homogenate, not in tissue extracts of liver, kidney, spleen, heart, and brain from line 407 nor from a nontransgenic mouse. The enzyme activity assays were performed also on line 283 transgenic for 100ΔHβ. Compared with nontransgenic controls, the testis showed 2-fold higher activity of the reporter gene, with no activity detectable in somatic tissue extracts (Fig. 3 B). To determine whether the transgene expression under the control of the 100-bp promoter followed the endogenous ldhc expression pattern, testis cross-sections from line 407 were analyzed histochemically. X-gal staining was evident largely in those cells close to the margin of the tubule but not near the lumen nor in epididymal spermatozoa (Fig. 4). Specific localization of transgene expression was accomplished by probing fixed, paraffin-embedded sections with antibody to β-galactosidase. There was nonspecific staining of the acrosome and tails of the spermatids in the nontransgenic testis. A strong signal was observed in pachytene primary spermatocytes (Fig. 5 A) of the transgenic testis. Immunohistochemical localization of endogenous LDH-C4 was visualized in pre- and post-meiotic stages of spermatogenesis in sections incubated with specific antibody (Fig. 5 B).Figure 5Comparison of transgene and endogenousldhc expression.

Trasler J.M. Hake L.E. Salehi-Ashtiani K. Goldberg E. Hecht N.B. Biol. Reprod. 1991; 44: 527-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The transcription product reaches a high level in pachytene spermatocytes and round spermatids and decreases in elongating spermatids. To determine the timing of transgene expression, testes from 9- and 12-day old mice were fixed and sectioned. The positive signal for anti-β-galactosidase could be seen only in day 12 testis, which is coincident with the appearance of pachytene spermatocytes (data not shown). X-gal staining of cross-sections of testis revealed a similar expression pattern in which the reporter gene was transcribed in the cells along the base of the tubule where, however, only a few individual cells stained blue. Testis-specific gene expression provides a challenge as well as a unique opportunity to investigate transcriptional regulation. The lack of a reliable and appropriate germ cell line that can be transfected limits the use of conventional techniques to investigate transcriptional regulation in such cells.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2262-2270Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar), have disrupted spermatogenesis. We have used co-cultures of immortalized Sertoli, peritubular, and Leydig cell lines to support the survival of pachytene spermatocytes in vitro (16Cooker L.A. Brooke C.D. Kumari M. Hofmann M.C. Millan J.L. Goldberg E. Biol. Reprod. 1993; 48: 1309-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and we have assayed transcription in testis nuclear extracts (4Zhou W. Goldberg E. Biol. Reprod. 1996; 54: 84-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Mouse and human ldhc genes have been isolated and sequenced, and functional promoter assays using CAT and lacZ reporters have been performed (4Zhou W. Goldberg E. Biol. Reprod. 1996; 54: 84-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 16Cooker L.A. Brooke C.D. Kumari M. Hofmann M.C. Millan J.L. Goldberg E. Biol. Reprod. 1993; 48: 1309-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The results indicate that both the mouse and human genes contain several ubiquitous cis-acting elements, but not the same ones. For example, the mouse ldhc gene contains a functional TATA box, but the human gene may not. On the other hand, the human gene, but not the mouse gene, contains six potential Sp1 sites in this region. Nevertheless, the humanldhc promoter sequence is functional as a transgene in the mouse testis and retains stage and tissue specificity (17Markert C.L. Amet T.M. Goldberg E. J. Exp. Zool. 1998; 282: 171-178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ldhc promoter sequences specific for mouse testis expression have begun to be identified. Data have been obtained to support the regulatory role of a palindromic sequence overlapping the TATA box and extending 3′ to the transcription initiation site. A 103-kDa protein in testis nuclear extract and a 65-kDa protein in liver nuclear extract binds to this palindromic sequence within the 60-bp core promoter region (3Zhou W. Xu J. Goldberg E. Biol. Reprod. 1994; 51: 425-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). From mutational analyses, we have established the palindrome as a dual function regulatory region necessary for promoter activity in testis nuclear extract and as responsible for repression of the promoter in liver nuclear extract (4Zhou W. Goldberg E. Biol. Reprod. 1996; 54: 84-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Mutation of the TATA box within the palindromic sequence eliminates in vitrotranscription in testis nuclear extract, as does mutation of the CCTGG sequence at the center of the palindrome (Fig. 1 B) (4Zhou W. Goldberg E. Biol. Reprod. 1996; 54: 84-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Mutation of a sequence in the left arm of the palindrome has no effect on testis-specific transcription but allows a low level of transcription in liver nuclear extract (4Zhou W. Goldberg E. Biol. Reprod. 1996; 54: 84-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Although these results are convincing, a more formal proof of promoter activity and developmental specificity required the analyses of the transgenic animals constructed in the present study. These data confirm our in vitro results demonstrating that the ldhc promoter sequence as short as 100 bp is able to direct testis-specific expression. Conclusions concerning the role of the palindromic sequence in conferring cell-type specificity must be deferred because only a single mutant transgenic line expressed β-galactosidase. Nevertheless, in that one transgenic line, promoter activity was testis-specific, suggesting that more of the promoter sequence than the palindrome is involved in cell-type specificity. For example, Yang and Thomas (18Yang J. Thomas K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2213-2220Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and Bonny et al. (19Bonny C. Cooker L.A. Goldberg E. Biol. Reprod. 1998; 58: 754-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) demonstrated enhancer activity and possible tissue specificity from binding interactions of the transcription factor Sp1 within the GC box of the mouse and human ldhc promoters, respectively. This is consistent with the finding described above that the humanldhc promoter is functional in the context of the murine germ cell (17Markert C.L. Amet T.M. Goldberg E. J. Exp. Zool. 1998; 282: 171-178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An unexpected result in the present study was that the transgene product was clearly confined to pachytene primary spermatocytes. This distribution is consistent with the staining pattern seen in Fig. 2, where tubules contain breaks in the deposition of X-gal reaction product. This can be explained by the wave of spermatogenesis along a tubule, where not all stages of the cycle will contain pachytene cells. The immunohistochemical localization of endogenous LDH-C4reveals a barely detectable level of the protein in pre-meiotic spermatocytes, with an increased intensity of staining as progression through the spermatogenic process continues. Using a combination of Northern blot analyses and in situ hybridization techniques, Thomas et al. (20Thomas K. Del Maso J. Eversole P. Belve A. Hiraoka Y. Li S.S.L. Simon M. Development. 1990; 109: 483-493PubMed Google Scholar) reported that the ldhc gene was expressed exclusively during meiosis and spermiogenesis, beginning in leptotene/zygotene spermatocytes and continuing through to the elongated spermatids. The most advanced stage at which our transgene product can be detected is pachytene (Fig. 5). This difference in expression of the transgene and endogenous ldhc may indicate that the regulatory elements for postmeiotic expression involve additional upstream sequence beyond the 100-bp fragment. Alternatively, the endogenous mRNA may be more stable than that of the transgene, and therefore may persist post-meiotically. Murine ldhcmRNA has been shown to be stable during spermatogenesis (21Salehi-Ashtiani K. Goldberg E. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1782-1790PubMed Google Scholar). Additional transgenic constructs are being prepared to answer these questions and to elucidate the role of cis-regulation of ldhc gene expression, in particular, and testis-specific gene expression, in general, during spermatogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2143350004,"5-Lipoxygenase catalyzes the first two steps in the biosynthesis of leukotrienes, potent extracellular mediators of inflammation and allergic disorders. The unanticipated observation of 5-lipoxygenase in the nucleus of some cell types including bone marrow-derived mast cells (Chen, X. S., Naumann, T. A., Kurre, U., Jenkins, N. A., Copeland, N. G., and Funk, C. D. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 17993–17999) has raised speculation about intranuclear actions of leukotrienes or the enzyme itself. To explore the entry of 5-lipoxygenase into the nucleus we have transfected various cell types with expression vectors encoding native 5-lipoxygenase and green fluorescent protein/5-lipoxygenase (GFP-5LO) fusion proteins. 5-Lipoxygenase and green fluorescent protein/5-lipoxygenase co-localized with the nuclear DNA stain Hoechst 33258 in each cell type. The three main basic regions of 5-lipoxygenase were incapable of acting as “classical” nuclear localization signal sequences. Mutations that abolished enzyme activity/non-heme iron resulted in proteins that would no longer enter the nucleus. An NH2-terminal 5-lipoxygenase fragment of 80 residues was sufficient for directing nuclear localization of green fluorescent protein but not cytosolic pyruvate kinase. The combined data suggest that 5-lipoxygenase enters the nucleus not by a classical nuclear localization signal but by a non-conventional signal located in the predicted β-barrel domain that may be masked by structural alterations. 5-Lipoxygenase catalyzes the first two steps in the biosynthesis of leukotrienes, potent extracellular mediators of inflammation and allergic disorders.

Subsequent conversion of leukotriene A4 by leukotriene A4 hydrolase yields the potent neutrophil chemoattractant leukotriene B4. Alternatively, conjugation of LTA4 with glutathione by leukotriene C4synthase plus downstream metabolism leads to the cysteinyl leukotrienes that influence airway reactivity and mucus secretion especially in asthmatics (1Samuelsson B.

Chem. 1986; 261: 7982-7988Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme was shown subsequently to undergo a calcium-dependent translocation to the nuclear envelope upon ionophore A23187 stimulation and was dependent on the 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein situated in this location for leukotriene biosynthesis (6Rouzer C.A.

Nature. 1990; 343: 282-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). More recent work based on immunofluorescence techniques and cellular fractionation demonstrated that certain cell types capable of leukotriene formation (alveolar macrophages, rat basophilic leukemia cells, and mouse bone marrow-derived mast cells) express 5-lipoxygenase completely or partially in the nucleus (8Brock T.G.

Invest. 1995; 95: 2035-2046Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Additionally, it was shown that cytosolic 5-lipoxygenase in rat neutrophils could enter the nucleus if they were first elicited in vivo with various inflammatory agents or subjected to adherence to glass in vitro (12Brock T.G. McNish R.W. Bailie M.B. Peters-Golden M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8276-8280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar).The discovery of 5-lipoxygenase in the nucleus was a surprising observation since it is well known that leukotrienes must exit the cell once synthesized to act on cell surface G protein-coupled receptors to exert their actions on neutrophils or bronchiole smooth muscle (13Lam B.K. Owen Jr., W.F. Austen K.F. Soberman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12885-12889Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,14Yokomizo T. Izumi T. Chang K. Takuwa Y. Shimizu T. Nature. 1997; 387: 620-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). The possibility of 5-lipoxygenase itself or leukotrienes acting in the nucleus was raised. The recent observation that LTB4could bind to the nuclear peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor-α indicated that intranuclear actions of leukotrienes are feasible (15Devchand P.R. Keller H. Peters J.M. Vazquez M. Gonzalez F.J. Wahli W. Nature. 1996; 384: 39-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (1201) Google Scholar).Nothing is known about control of 5-lipoxygenase entry into the nucleus in some cell types but not others. Proteins enter the nucleus by nuclear localization signal (NLS) sequences that are recognized by specific importins, prior to nuclear pore docking, translocation through the pore and release from the pore's inner side (16Corbett A.H. Silver P.A. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 193-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 17Pemberton L.F. Blobel G. Rosenblum J.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 392-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). The NLS is typically a short basic region or bipartite basic sequence (18Kalderon D. Roberts B.L. Richardson W.D. Smith A.E. Cell. 1984; 39: 499-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1854) Google Scholar,19Robbins J. Dilworth S.M. Laskey R.A. Dingwall C. Cell. 1991; 64: 615-623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1240) Google Scholar). Increasingly, however, novel NLS sequences are being recognized for import of particular classes of proteins; for example, the 38-amino acid M9 domain of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (20Siomi H. Dreyfuss G. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 551-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar, 21Pollard V.W. Michael W.M. Nakielny S. Siomi M.C. Wang F. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1996; 86: 985-994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrate primarily with the use of green fluorescent protein (GFP)/5-lipoxygenase fusion proteins the complexity of events for 5-lipoxygenase nuclear entry.DISCUSSIONWe have carried out a study to investigate the nuclear targeting of 5-lipoxygenase. More than 25 fusion protein constructs were prepared and analyzed by immunofluorescence microscopy in various transfected cell lines. The combined data indicate that 5-lipoxygenase nuclear targeting is dependent on a number of complex factors. First, 5-lipoxygenase does not possess a “classical” basic region that functions as a NLS although the protein does contain at least three potential basic cluster regions that could act in this function. Second, the proper folding of the enzyme is critical for nuclear localization. This result is based on the fact that fusion proteins, which completely lack or partially retain the non-heme iron atom, show a predominantly cytosolic localization. Third, a short NH2-terminal region (first 80 amino acids) appears sufficient for directing the enzyme to the nucleus but when this segment is extended the recognition sequence(s) are lost. Fourth, any NLS sequence(s) in the NH2-terminal region of 5LO are relatively weak since only one of two proteins tested could be transported to the nucleus (e.g. GFP versuspyruvate kinase).The nuclear import of proteins bearing the classical NLS such as those for the SV40 large T antigen and nucleoplasmin begins by binding to karyopherin-α which acts as the NLS receptor (17Pemberton L.F. Blobel G. Rosenblum J.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 392-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Karyopherin-β1 interacts further with the NLS-bound karyopherin-α to form the ternary complex, which is targeted to the nucleoporins in the nuclear pore complex. Subsequent translocation into the nucleus through the nuclear pore complex depends on GTPase Ran and its modulators (16Corbett A.H. Silver P.A. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 193-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 17Pemberton L.F. Blobel G. Rosenblum J.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 392-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Novel import pathways have been identified recently. For instance, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 interacts directly with karyopherin-β2/transportin, which is one of the members in the β-karyopherin superfamily, through the substrate's distinct NLS known as M9 or NLS2 to target to the nuclear pore complex (20Siomi H. Dreyfuss G. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 551-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar, 21Pollard V.W. Michael W.M. Nakielny S. Siomi M.C. Wang F. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1996; 86: 985-994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). Common features of the novel nuclear import pathways appear to be NLS sequences distinct from the classical pathway and direct interaction with an individual karyopherin-β form independent of interaction with the adapter karyopherin-α. Perhaps 5-lipoxygenase is using a novel means of nuclear entry in this respect. 5-Lipoxygenase does not contain an M9 domain and it is not yet known if it can interact with karyopherin-α.5-Lipoxygenase is the only known mammalian lipoxygenase that resides in the nucleus. The NH2 termini of lipoxygenases differ to the greatest extent in this region (33Funk C.D. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1993; 45: 67-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 34Funk C.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1304: 65-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Thus, this region appears to be the most important for 5LO nuclear targeting since there was one fragment (1–80) that could direct GFP to the nucleus. This was not a nonspecific result since both a COOH-terminal fragment from 5-lipoxygenase (5LO(574–673), see Fig. 6) of similar size and a fragment corresponding to the same residues of platelet 12-lipoxygenase (1–75; in the NH2-terminal sequence five residues are not present in this lipoxygenase and several other mammalian lipoxygenases) did not direct nuclear localization. Platelet 12-lipoxygenase is known to reside in the cytosol, either soluble or membrane-bound, of human erythroleukemia cells, A431 cells, and epidermal homogenates (23Chen X.S. Brash A.R. Funk C.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 845-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 35Mahmud I. Suzuki T. Yamamoto Y. Suzuki H. Takahashi Y. Yoshimoto T. Yamamoto S. Biochim. Biophys.

Cell Res. 1996; 228: 197-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The basic cluster within the 5LO(1–80) sequence was not essential for nuclear localization.Based on the three-dimensional x-ray crystal structures of soybean lipoxygenases and rabbit reticulocyte 15-lipoxygenase (29Boyington J.C. Gaffney B.J. Amzel L.M. Science. 1993; 260: 1482-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 30Gillmor S.A. Villasenor A. Fletterick R. Sigal E. Browner M.F. Nature Struct.

Biol. 1997; 4: 966-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), the lipoxygenase family members possess two domains; a short β-barrel NH2-terminal domain of unknown function and a major catalytic domain that includes the non-heme iron atom. Gillmor et al. (30Gillmor S.A. Villasenor A. Fletterick R. Sigal E. Browner M.F. Nature Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 1003-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar) have hypothesized that the β-barrel NH2-terminal region, with homology to lipoprotein lipase, may participate in binding lipid membranes to gain access to the source of substrate. In the case of 5-lipoxygenase, they suggested a possible site of interaction with 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein, a co-accessory protein in leukotriene biosynthesis that may help to “transfer” arachidonic acid substrate to the enzyme (7Dixon R.A. Diehl R.E. Opas E. Rands E. Vickers P.J. Evans J.F. Gillard J.W. Miller D.K. Nature. 1990; 343: 282-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar, 38Abramovitz M. Wong E. Cox M.E. Richardson C.D. Li C. Vickers P.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 105-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The data here could extend the possible list of functions for this domain, in particular for 5-lipoxygenase, as aiding in nuclear localization. The putative β-barrel domain of 5-lipoxygenase is about 125 amino acid residues in length. A construct with this domain still directed nuclear localization of GFP. However, if it was extended to 166 amino acids the fusion protein remained cytosolic. This result suggests that the folding of the extra portion beyond the β-barrel may have masked any potential NLS. The context within which the NLS is situated is important for nuclear localization (39Roberts B.L. Richardson W.D. Smith A.E. Cell. 1987; 50: 465-475Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 40Nelson M. Silver P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 384-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar).Precedents for weak NLS sequences in proteins are prevalent in the literature and 5-lipoxygenase seems to fit in this class of proteins. For example, a 29-amino acid stretch of GAL4 could direct cytosolic invertase to the nucleus but not β-galactosidase (40Nelson M. Silver P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 384-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Likewise, a NLS motif near the NH2 terminus of fibroblast growth factor 3 conferred nuclear localization to cytoplasmic β-galactosidase but not pyruvate kinase (41Antoine M. Reimers K. Dickson C. Kiefer P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29475-29481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Signals in 5-lipoxygenase were capable of directing the GFP reporter protein to the nucleus but not pyruvate kinase. Complex patterns of nuclear targeting that may involve weak additive signals from opposite ends of the protein are known (e.g. fibroblast growth factor 3) (41Antoine M. Reimers K. Dickson C. Kiefer P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29475-29481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Examples of NLS “masking” by structural alterations and/or other cellular proteins, a prime example being the transcription factor NF-κB/Rel bound by its inhibitor IκB are known (42Latimer M. Ernst M.K. Dunn L.L. Drutskaya M. Rice N.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2640-2649Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The data herein could be consistent with some sort of unmasking of an NLS to gain nuclear entry and also do not rule out the possibility that 5-lipoxygenase is “piggybacked” to the nucleus by some other chaperone protein. A somewhat surprising result was that 5-lipoxygenase could be localized to the nucleus in four different transfected cell types. Perhaps, in human and rat neutrophils, 5-lipoxygenase is specifically bound by an inhibitor protein that prevents nuclear transport since the enzyme in these resting cells is exclusively cytosolic. Upon in vivoactivation or adherence to glass in vitro (12Brock T.G. McNish R.W. Bailie M.B. Peters-Golden M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8276-8280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), therefore, these cells would lose the capacity to behind the inhibitor and enter the nucleus. Alternatively, some sort of post-translational modification such as phosphorylation of 5-lipoxygenase, particularly in neutrophils, may influence NLS recognition. Phosphorylation of a nuclear 5-lipoxygenase fraction has been detected in HL-60 cells but the site of phosphorylation has not been identified (43Lepley R.A. Muskardin D.T. Fitzpatrick F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6179-6184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). We are currently studying potential interactions of 5-lipoxygenase with other proteins using the yeast two-hybrid system with relevance to the nuclear targeting paradigm.The use of 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors and leukotriene receptor antagonists has made its widespread debut in the clinical arena for asthma treatment in the last few years (44Tan R.A. Curr. Opin. Pulm. Med. 1998; 4: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The recent discoveries of 5-lipoxygenase in the nucleus, that LTB4 can bind and activate a nuclear transcription factor (peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor-α), and the potential for other nuclear functions make it essential to understand the mechanisms for nuclear localization of 5-lipoxygenase. This study has raised new questions in beginning to answer these issues. 5-Lipoxygenase (arachidonate:oxygen 5-oxidoreductase, EC1.13.11.34) is a non-heme iron enzyme found primarily in white blood cells, macrophages, and mast cells that converts arachidonic acid first to 5-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (5-HPETE)1 and then to leukotriene (LT)A4 (5,6-oxido-7,9,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid)(1). Subsequent conversion of leukotriene A4 by leukotriene A4 hydrolase yields the potent neutrophil chemoattractant leukotriene B4. Alternatively, conjugation of LTA4 with glutathione by leukotriene C4synthase plus downstream metabolism leads to the cysteinyl leukotrienes that influence airway reactivity and mucus secretion especially in asthmatics (1Samuelsson B. Science. 1983; 220: 568-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (2312) Google Scholar, 2Samuelsson B. Dahlén S.E. Lindgren J.A. Rouzer C.A. Serhan C.N. Science. 1987; 237: 1171-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (1970) Google Scholar, 3Lewis R.A. Austen K.F. Soberman R.J. New Engl. J. Med. 1990; 323: 645-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1168) Google Scholar). 5-Lipoxygenase was isolated originally from the cytosol fraction of human and porcine neutrophils (4Rouzer C.A. Samuelsson B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 6040-6044Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 5Ueda N. Kaneko S. Yoshimoto T. Yamamoto S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7982-7988Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme was shown subsequently to undergo a calcium-dependent translocation to the nuclear envelope upon ionophore A23187 stimulation and was dependent on the 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein situated in this location for leukotriene biosynthesis (6Rouzer C.A. Kargman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10980-10988Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Dixon R.A. Diehl R.E. Opas E. Rands E. Vickers P.J. Evans J.F. Gillard J.W. Miller D.K. Nature. 1990; 343: 282-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). More recent work based on immunofluorescence techniques and cellular fractionation demonstrated that certain cell types capable of leukotriene formation (alveolar macrophages, rat basophilic leukemia cells, and mouse bone marrow-derived mast cells) express 5-lipoxygenase completely or partially in the nucleus (8Brock T.G. Paine R. Peters-Golden M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22059-22066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Brock T.G. McNish R.W. Peters-Golden M. J. Biol.

Invest. 1995; 95: 2035-2046Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Additionally, it was shown that cytosolic 5-lipoxygenase in rat neutrophils could enter the nucleus if they were first elicited in vivo with various inflammatory agents or subjected to adherence to glass in vitro (12Brock T.G. McNish R.W. Bailie M.B. Peters-Golden M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8276-8280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The discovery of 5-lipoxygenase in the nucleus was a surprising observation since it is well known that leukotrienes must exit the cell once synthesized to act on cell surface G protein-coupled receptors to exert their actions on neutrophils or bronchiole smooth muscle (13Lam B.K. Owen Jr., W.F. Austen K.F. Soberman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12885-12889Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,14Yokomizo T. Izumi T. Chang K. Takuwa Y. Shimizu T. Nature. 1997; 387: 620-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). The possibility of 5-lipoxygenase itself or leukotrienes acting in the nucleus was raised. The recent observation that LTB4could bind to the nuclear peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor-α indicated that intranuclear actions of leukotrienes are feasible (15Devchand P.R. Keller H. Peters J.M. Vazquez M. Gonzalez F.J. Wahli W. Nature. 1996; 384: 39-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (1201) Google Scholar). Nothing is known about control of 5-lipoxygenase entry into the nucleus in some cell types but not others. Proteins enter the nucleus by nuclear localization signal (NLS) sequences that are recognized by specific importins, prior to nuclear pore docking, translocation through the pore and release from the pore's inner side (16Corbett A.H. Silver P.A. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 193-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 17Pemberton L.F. Blobel G. Rosenblum J.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 392-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). The NLS is typically a short basic region or bipartite basic sequence (18Kalderon D. Roberts B.L. Richardson W.D. Smith A.E. Cell. 1984; 39: 499-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1854) Google Scholar,19Robbins J. Dilworth S.M. Laskey R.A. Dingwall C. Cell. 1991; 64: 615-623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1240) Google Scholar). Increasingly, however, novel NLS sequences are being recognized for import of particular classes of proteins; for example, the 38-amino acid M9 domain of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (20Siomi H. Dreyfuss G. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 551-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar, 21Pollard V.W. Michael W.M. Nakielny S. Siomi M.C. Wang F. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1996; 86: 985-994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrate primarily with the use of green fluorescent protein (GFP)/5-lipoxygenase fusion proteins the complexity of events for 5-lipoxygenase nuclear entry. DISCUSSIONWe have carried out a study to investigate the nuclear targeting of 5-lipoxygenase. More than 25 fusion protein constructs were prepared and analyzed by immunofluorescence microscopy in various transfected cell lines. The combined data indicate that 5-lipoxygenase nuclear targeting is dependent on a number of complex factors. First, 5-lipoxygenase does not possess a “classical” basic region that functions as a NLS although the protein does contain at least three potential basic cluster regions that could act in this function. Second, the proper folding of the enzyme is critical for nuclear localization. This result is based on the fact that fusion proteins, which completely lack or partially retain the non-heme iron atom, show a predominantly cytosolic localization. Third, a short NH2-terminal region (first 80 amino acids) appears sufficient for directing the enzyme to the nucleus but when this segment is extended the recognition sequence(s) are lost. Fourth, any NLS sequence(s) in the NH2-terminal region of 5LO are relatively weak since only one of two proteins tested could be transported to the nucleus (e.g. GFP versuspyruvate kinase).The nuclear import of proteins bearing the classical NLS such as those for the SV40 large T antigen and nucleoplasmin begins by binding to karyopherin-α which acts as the NLS receptor (17Pemberton L.F. Blobel G. Rosenblum J.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 392-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Karyopherin-β1 interacts further with the NLS-bound karyopherin-α to form the ternary complex, which is targeted to the nucleoporins in the nuclear pore complex. Subsequent translocation into the nucleus through the nuclear pore complex depends on GTPase Ran and its modulators (16Corbett A.H. Silver P.A. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 193-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 17Pemberton L.F. Blobel G. Rosenblum J.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 392-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Novel import pathways have been identified recently. For instance, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 interacts directly with karyopherin-β2/transportin, which is one of the members in the β-karyopherin superfamily, through the substrate's distinct NLS known as M9 or NLS2 to target to the nuclear pore complex (20Siomi H. Dreyfuss G. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 551-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar, 21Pollard V.W. Michael W.M. Nakielny S. Siomi M.C. Wang F. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1996; 86: 985-994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). Common features of the novel nuclear import pathways appear to be NLS sequences distinct from the classical pathway and direct interaction with an individual karyopherin-β form independent of interaction with the adapter karyopherin-α. Perhaps 5-lipoxygenase is using a novel means of nuclear entry in this respect. 5-Lipoxygenase does not contain an M9 domain and it is not yet known if it can interact with karyopherin-α.5-Lipoxygenase is the only known mammalian lipoxygenase that resides in the nucleus. The NH2 termini of lipoxygenases differ to the greatest extent in this region (33Funk C.D. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1993; 45: 67-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 34Funk C.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1304: 65-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Thus, this region appears to be the most important for 5LO nuclear targeting since there was one fragment (1–80) that could direct GFP to the nucleus. This was not a nonspecific result since both a COOH-terminal fragment from 5-lipoxygenase (5LO(574–673), see Fig. 6) of similar size and a fragment corresponding to the same residues of platelet 12-lipoxygenase (1–75; in the NH2-terminal sequence five residues are not present in this lipoxygenase and several other mammalian lipoxygenases) did not direct nuclear localization. Platelet 12-lipoxygenase is known to reside in the cytosol, either soluble or membrane-bound, of human erythroleukemia cells, A431 cells, and epidermal homogenates (23Chen X.S. Brash A.R. Funk C.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 845-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 35Mahmud I. Suzuki T. Yamamoto Y. Suzuki H. Takahashi Y. Yoshimoto T. Yamamoto S. Biochim. Biophys.

Cell Res. 1996; 228: 197-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The basic cluster within the 5LO(1–80) sequence was not essential for nuclear localization.Based on the three-dimensional x-ray crystal structures of soybean lipoxygenases and rabbit reticulocyte 15-lipoxygenase (29Boyington J.C. Gaffney B.J. Amzel L.M. Science. 1993; 260: 1482-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 30Gillmor S.A. Villasenor A. Fletterick R. Sigal E. Browner M.F. Nature Struct.

The NH2 termini of lipoxygenases differ to the greatest extent in this region (33Funk C.D. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1993; 45: 67-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 34Funk C.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1304: 65-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Thus, this region appears to be the most important for 5LO nuclear targeting since there was one fragment (1–80) that could direct GFP to the nucleus. This was not a nonspecific result since both a COOH-terminal fragment from 5-lipoxygenase (5LO(574–673), see Fig. 6) of similar size and a fragment corresponding to the same residues of platelet 12-lipoxygenase (1–75; in the NH2-terminal sequence five residues are not present in this lipoxygenase and several other mammalian lipoxygenases) did not direct nuclear localization. Platelet 12-lipoxygenase is known to reside in the cytosol, either soluble or membrane-bound, of human erythroleukemia cells, A431 cells, and epidermal homogenates (23Chen X.S. Brash A.R. Funk C.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 845-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 35Mahmud I. Suzuki T. Yamamoto Y. Suzuki H. Takahashi Y. Yoshimoto T. Yamamoto S. Biochim. Biophys.

Cell Res. 1996; 228: 197-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The basic cluster within the 5LO(1–80) sequence was not essential for nuclear localization. Based on the three-dimensional x-ray crystal structures of soybean lipoxygenases and rabbit reticulocyte 15-lipoxygenase (29Boyington J.C. Gaffney B.J. Amzel L.M. Science. 1993; 260: 1482-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 30Gillmor S.A. Villasenor A. Fletterick R. Sigal E. Browner M.F. Nature Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 1003-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 37Funk C.D. Loll P.J. Nature Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 966-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), the lipoxygenase family members possess two domains; a short β-barrel NH2-terminal domain of unknown function and a major catalytic domain that includes the non-heme iron atom. Gillmor et al. (30Gillmor S.A. Villasenor A. Fletterick R. Sigal E. Browner M.F. Nature Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 1003-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar) have hypothesized that the β-barrel NH2-terminal region, with homology to lipoprotein lipase, may participate in binding lipid membranes to gain access to the source of substrate. In the case of 5-lipoxygenase, they suggested a possible site of interaction with 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein, a co-accessory protein in leukotriene biosynthesis that may help to “transfer” arachidonic acid substrate to the enzyme (7Dixon R.A. Diehl R.E. Opas E. Rands E. Vickers P.J. Evans J.F. Gillard J.W. Miller D.K. Nature. 1990; 343: 282-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar, 38Abramovitz M. Wong E. Cox M.E. Richardson C.D. Li C. Vickers P.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 105-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The data here could extend the possible list of functions for this domain, in particular for 5-lipoxygenase, as aiding in nuclear localization. The putative β-barrel domain of 5-lipoxygenase is about 125 amino acid residues in length. A construct with this domain still directed nuclear localization of GFP. However, if it was extended to 166 amino acids the fusion protein remained cytosolic. This result suggests that the folding of the extra portion beyond the β-barrel may have masked any potential NLS. The context within which the NLS is situated is important for nuclear localization (39Roberts B.L. Richardson W.D. Smith A.E. Cell. 1987; 50: 465-475Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 40Nelson M. Silver P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 384-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Precedents for weak NLS sequences in proteins are prevalent in the literature and 5-lipoxygenase seems to fit in this class of proteins. For example, a 29-amino acid stretch of GAL4 could direct cytosolic invertase to the nucleus but not β-galactosidase (40Nelson M. Silver P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 384-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Likewise, a NLS motif near the NH2 terminus of fibroblast growth factor 3 conferred nuclear localization to cytoplasmic β-galactosidase but not pyruvate kinase (41Antoine M. Reimers K. Dickson C. Kiefer P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29475-29481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Signals in 5-lipoxygenase were capable of directing the GFP reporter protein to the nucleus but not pyruvate kinase. Complex patterns of nuclear targeting that may involve weak additive signals from opposite ends of the protein are known (e.g. fibroblast growth factor 3) (41Antoine M. Reimers K. Dickson C. Kiefer P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29475-29481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Examples of NLS “masking” by structural alterations and/or other cellular proteins, a prime example being the transcription factor NF-κB/Rel bound by its inhibitor IκB are known (42Latimer M. Ernst M.K. Dunn L.L. Drutskaya M. Rice N.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2640-2649Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The data herein could be consistent with some sort of unmasking of an NLS to gain nuclear entry and also do not rule out the possibility that 5-lipoxygenase is “piggybacked” to the nucleus by some other chaperone protein. A somewhat surprising result was that 5-lipoxygenase could be localized to the nucleus in four different transfected cell types. Perhaps, in human and rat neutrophils, 5-lipoxygenase is specifically bound by an inhibitor protein that prevents nuclear transport since the enzyme in these resting cells is exclusively cytosolic. Upon in vivoactivation or adherence to glass in vitro (12Brock T.G. McNish R.W. Bailie M.B. Peters-Golden M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8276-8280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), therefore, these cells would lose the capacity to behind the inhibitor and enter the nucleus. Alternatively, some sort of post-translational modification such as phosphorylation of 5-lipoxygenase, particularly in neutrophils, may influence NLS recognition. Phosphorylation of a nuclear 5-lipoxygenase fraction has been detected in HL-60 cells but the site of phosphorylation has not been identified (43Lepley R.A. Muskardin D.T. Fitzpatrick F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6179-6184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). We are currently studying potential interactions of 5-lipoxygenase with other proteins using the yeast two-hybrid system with relevance to the nuclear targeting paradigm. The use of 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors and leukotriene receptor antagonists has made its widespread debut in the clinical arena for asthma treatment in the last few years (44Tan R.A. Curr. Opin. Pulm. Med. 1998; 4: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The recent discoveries of 5-lipoxygenase in the nucleus, that LTB4 can bind and activate a nuclear transcription factor (peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor-α), and the potential for other nuclear functions make it essential to understand the mechanisms for nuclear localization of 5-lipoxygenase. This study has raised new questions in beginning to answer these issues. We thank Dr. M. Malim for helpful discussions and Dr. H. Siomi for important suggestions and for providing pcDNA3/myc-PK vector and anti-Myc antibody."

After removal of the signal sequence, the glycosylated precursor of 53 kDa (P53) was produced and further processed to polypeptides of 31 and 15 kDa (P31 + P15) and, subsequently, to polypeptides of 26 and 9 kDa (P26 + P9), 45 min and 24 h after synthesis, respectively.

Aspartic proteinases (APs)1 (EC 3.4.23) constitute one of the four superfamilies of proteolytic enzymes. They are present in a wide variety of organisms, such as viruses, fungi, plants, and animals. Common features of APs include an active site cleft that contains two catalytic aspartic acid residues (32 and 215 in pepsin), acidic pH optima for enzymatic activity, inhibition by pepstatin A, a conserved overall fold, and a preferential cleavage specificity for peptide bonds between amino acid residues with bulky hydrophobic side chains. Both intracellular and extracellular forms of APs are present in animal tissues (1Davies D. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1990; 19: 189-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar, 2Rawlings N.D. Barrett A.L. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 105-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Aspartic proteinases are synthesized as inactive precursors (zymogens) in which the N-terminal propeptide is bound to the active site cleft, thus preventing undesirable protein degradation and enabling spatial and temporal regulation of proteolytic activity. Pepsinogen, the inactive precursor of stomach pepsin, needs only a drop in pH for the autocatalytic cleavage of the propeptide to result in an active enzyme (1Davies D. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1990; 19: 189-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). Procathepsin D, which is targeted to the lysosome largely via the mannose-6-phosphate receptor (3Metcalf P. Fusek M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1293-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), is activated after cleavage of its N-terminal 44 amino acids, most likely by lysosomal cysteine proteinases (4Samarel A.M. Ferguson A.G. Decker R.S. Lesch M. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: C1069-C1079Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Procathepsin D is also capable of acid-dependent autoactivation in vitro to yield a catalytically active (pseudo)cathepsin D (5Conner G.E. Richo G. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1142-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 6Beyer B.M. Dunn B.M. J. Biol.

However, autocatalytic removal of the remaining 18-residue propeptide or the processing intermediate corresponding to pseudocathepsin D has not been observed in vivo (7Richo G.R. Conner G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14806-14812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Barley AP (Hordeum vulgare AP), recently renamed phytepsin (EC 3.4.23.40) (8Barrett A.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), was originally isolated from grains in which it exists as two enzymatically active two-chain forms (9Sarkkinen P. Kalkkinen N. Tilgmann C. Siuro J. Kervinen J. Mikola L. Planta. 1992; 186: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Sequence alignment of phytepsin with animal and microbial APs shows a high degree of similarity, with the exception of an inserted domain of approximately 100 residues that is plant-specific (10Runeberg-Roos P. Törmakangas K. Östman A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 202: 1021-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 11Cordeiro M.C. Xue Z.T. Pietrzak M. Pais M.S. Brodelius P.E. Plant Mol.

FEBS Lett. 1994; 352: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The exact function of phytepsin is still controversial. Because phytepsin is an intracellular enzyme residing in leaf and root vacuoles (14Runeberg-Roos P. Kervinen J. Kovaleva V. Raikhel N.V. Gal S. Plant Physiol. 1994; 105: 321-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and in scutellar and aleuronal vacuole-like protein bodies in grains (15Marttila S. Jones B.L. Mikkonen A. Physiol. Plant. 1995; 93: 317-327Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and because it is able to cleave the C-terminal vacuolar targeting signal of barley prolectinin vitro (14Runeberg-Roos P. Kervinen J. Kovaleva V. Raikhel N.V. Gal S. Plant Physiol. 1994; 105: 321-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), phytepsin may represent a cathepsin D-like enzyme from plant cells. Accordingly, phytepsin may participate in protein processing and metabolic turnover (Ref. 16Kervinen J. The Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes.in: Barrett A.J. Woessner F.F. Rawlings N. Academic Press, Inc. London, 1998Google Scholar and references therein). It has recently also been observed that phytepsin may play a role in the active autolysis in plant tissues undergoing developmentally regulated programmed cell death (17Runeberg-Roos P. Saarma M. Plant J. 1998; 15: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Modification of phytepsin during its intracellular route to vacuoles involves several steps; however, the enzymology, sequence, and intracellular localization of these events is not known. The study presented here describes the mode of expression, processing, and activation of phytepsin during its transport. Furthermore, we demonstrate the autoactivation of phytepsin in vitro by using a recombinant enzyme expressed in insect cells. H. vulgare (cv. Sereia) grains were purchased from the Estação Nacional de Melhoramento de Plantas, Elvas, Portugal. A purified antiserum against phytepsin was prepared as described previously (14Runeberg-Roos P. Kervinen J. Kovaleva V. Raikhel N.V. Gal S. Plant Physiol. 1994; 105: 321-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar).l-[35S]methionine andl-[35S]cysteine (Pro-mix™ in vivocell labeling mix) and autoradiography films (Hyperfilm™-MP) were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Molecular weight standards for gel electrophoresis were purchased from Bio-Rad. Protein A coupled to Sepharose was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Endoglycosidase H (Endo H) was from Oxford GlycoSciences (Oxford, UK). Immobilon™-P polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) transfer membranes were purchased from Millipore Corp. (Bedford, MA). The remaining reagents were of analytical grade. Barley grains were surface-sterilized with 1% (w/v) sodium hypochlorite followed by 60% (v/v) ethanol and germinated on Petri dishes containing 15 ml of 0.8% (w/v) agar for 3 days at 28 °C in the dark. For the extraction of root proteins, nondenaturing solubilization buffer (30 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 0.25 m sucrose, 5% (w/v) polyvinylpolypyrrolidone, 0.15% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol) was added to the roots frozen in liquid nitrogen. Five root tips were homogenized with 0.2 ml of the buffer using a Teflon homogenizer (Sigma). The extracts were cleared by centrifugation for 5 min at 10,000 rpm, and the supernatants were used for immunoprecipitation or Western blot analysis. Protein A-Sepharose (3 mg/sample) was resuspended in immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.05% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 1 mm EDTA) and washed twice. Rabbit antibodies were directly coupled to the Protein A-Sepharose by shaking for 20 min at room temperature. The proteins in the lysate supernatants were immunoprecipitated with aliquots of the protein A-Sepharose-antibody-protein complex for 1 h on ice. Immunoprecipitates were washed twice each with high salt (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 0.5 m NaCl, 5 mmEDTA, 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.1% (w/v) SDS), medium salt (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl, 5 mmEDTA, 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100), and low salt (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100) buffers (18Pinkas-Kramarski R. Shelly M. Glathe S. Ratzkin B. Yarden Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19029-19032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The complex was resuspended in 25 μl of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (19Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207218) Google Scholar). The proteins were transferred from the gel to a PVDF membrane in a Bio-Rad semi-dry transfer cell for 1 h at 15 V. The PVDF membrane was blocked in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 and 3% (w/v) dried lowfat milk for 45 min. The antiserum and the second antibody (alkaline phosphatase-coupled goat-anti-rabbit IgG) were used at 1/500 and 1/8000 dilutions, respectively, in blocking solution containing 1% dried lowfat milk. Detection was performed by the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) method (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or with 4-chloro-1-naphthol (20Costa J. Grabenhorst E. Nimtz M. Conradt H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11613-11621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). For each time point, 5 roots from 3-day-germinated grains were cut ∼1 cm from the tip, and the cut ends were dipped in 20 μl of essential B5 plant growth medium containing 4% (w/v) sucrose and 100 μCi of Pro-mix™ (l-[35S]methionine/cysteine) for the indicated pulse periods. The chase was performed in 20 μl of essential B5 plant growth medium containing 4% (w/v) sucrose, 1 mml-methionine, and 0.5 mml-cysteine for the indicated time periods. Protein extracts were prepared from roots frozen in liquid nitrogen and were immunoprecipitated with anti-phytepsin serum. The proteins (∼40 μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE in a gradient gel (10–20%). The gel was dried, and 35S-labeled proteins were detected by fluorography. Metabolic labeling and pulse-chase experiments were performed as described above, except that for each time point, 10 root tips were incubated with 200 μCi of Pro-mix™. After immunoprecipitation, the protein was dissociated from the antibodies with 40 μl of 0.1 m glycine-HCl buffer, pH 3.0, then incubated in 50 mm citrate buffer, pH 5.5, containing 1 mg/ml SDS and 0.2 m β-mercaptoethanol at 95 °C for 10 min. Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, E-64, and pepstatin A were added to final concentrations of 1 mm, 10 μg/ml, and 10 μg/ml, respectively. Six milliunits of Endo H were added to a final volume of 100 μl, and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 18 h. The protein was then precipitated with ethanol and analyzed by SDS-PAGE in 12 or 10–20% polyacrylamide gradient gels. Root tips (1 cm) were dipped for 1 h in 14 μl of essential B5 plant growth medium containing 4% (w/v) sucrose and inhibitors at the following concentrations: 7 μm brefeldin A1 in methanol and 10 μg/ml tunicamycin A1 in methanol. The control samples were incubated with the same volume of methanol added. The roots were radiolabeled as described above. Duplicate samples of 1 μl of metabolically labeled extract were spotted on small pieces of Whatman 3MM filter paper. The papers were dried, and one of the duplicates was washed 5 times with 5 ml of 5% (v/v) trichloroacetic acid and dried. The papers were placed at the bottom of plastic vials, 3 ml of liquid scintillation mixture (Beckman) was added, and the radioactivity was counted in the carbon channel of a Beckman scintillation counter. Sequences encoding the complete preprophytepsin (1863 base pairs (10Runeberg-Roos P. Törmakangas K. Östman A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 202: 1021-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar)) were cloned into the KpnI restriction site of the baculovirus transfer vector pBlueBac4.5 (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA). The construct was cotransfected with Autographa californica multiple nuclear polyhedrosis viral DNA into Spodoptera frugiperda(Sf9) cells, and recombinant baculoviruses were derived using standard methodologies (21O'Reilly D.R. Miller L.K. Luckow V.A. Baculovirus Expression Vectors: A Laboratory Manual. Oxford University Press, New York1994Google Scholar). For protein production, Sf9 suspension cultures were infected with A. californicamultiple nuclear polyhedrosis virus-phytepsin in complete Grace's medium (about 600 ml) supplemented with 7% fetal bovine serum. Four days after infection, the conditioned culture supernatant was clarified for 20 min at 6,000 × g and concentrated to approximately 2% of the initial volume at 4 °C by ultrafiltration (Amicon YM30 membrane, Amicon, Danvers, MA). The concentrated supernatant was diluted 1.3-fold with cold 0.5 m sodium acetate, pH 4.0, and phytepsin was purified according to Sarkkinenet al. (9Sarkkinen P. Kalkkinen N. Tilgmann C. Siuro J. Kervinen J. Mikola L. Planta. 1992; 186: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) by affinity chromatography on a pepstatin-agarose column, with the exception that no washing with pH 7.5 buffer was carried out and the elution was performed with 0.1 mTris-HCl, pH 8.8, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mNaCl. Further purification was performed by ion exchange chromatography on a Mono Q column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Recombinant phytepsin purified on the Mono Q column (2.2 mg/ml in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1 m NaCl) was mixed with an equal volume of 0.2m incubation buffer and kept at 37 °C for up to 90 min. Incubation buffers were as follows: sodium lactate, pH 3.7, sodium acetate, pH 4.5 and 5.5, and sodium phosphate, pH 6.5. Samples were removed after various times and frozen at –70 °C. Processing products were separated by SDS-PAGE (PhastSystem, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 or electroblotted onto a PVDF membrane for N-terminal sequencing. The Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained protein bands in the membrane were excised and individually sequenced on an Applied Biosystems 477A gas-phase sequencer, and the phenylthiohydantoin amino acids were identified on-line with a Model 120 analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Inc., Foster City, CA). Phytepsin samples were diluted with 20 mm sodium lactate, pH 3.7, and preincubated for 1 h at 37 °C, and the activity was measured according to Sarkkinen et al. (9Sarkkinen P. Kalkkinen N. Tilgmann C. Siuro J. Kervinen J. Mikola L. Planta. 1992; 186: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) using bovine hemoglobin as the substrate at pH 3.7. The assay temperature was 37 °C. One unit of activity corresponded to the enzymatic activity that liberated trichloroacetic acid-soluble reaction products equivalent to 1 mg of bovine serum albumin in 1 h at 37 °C. Glycoproteins were analyzed using a matrix of 22.4 mg of 3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 400 μl of acetonitrile and 600 μl of 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid in H2O as the UV-absorbing material. The solubilized samples were mixed with the same volume of matrix, and 1 μl of the mixture was spotted onto the stainless steel tip and dried at room temperature. The concentration of the analyte was ∼5–25 pmol/μl. Measurements were performed on a Bruker REFLEXTM MALDI/TOF mass spectrometer using a N2 laser (337 nm) with a 3-ns pulse width and 107–108 watt/cm2 irradiance at the surface (0.2 mm2 spot). Spectra were recorded at an acceleration voltage of 28.5 kV in the linear mode, using the delayed extraction facility. Affinity-purified phytepsin preparation from barley grains typically contains two enzyme forms of approximately 32 + 16 kDa and 29 + 11 kDa and occasionally some higher molecular mass precursors. In earlier studies (9Sarkkinen P. Kalkkinen N. Tilgmann C. Siuro J. Kervinen J. Mikola L. Planta. 1992; 186: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 10Runeberg-Roos P. Törmakangas K. Östman A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 202: 1021-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) molecular weight estimations for different chains were based on SDS-PAGE analyses (Fig. 1) and on calculations from the cDNA-derived protein sequence when the N-terminal sequence was known. However, details about the processing of the different polypeptides at the C terminus were not known. To more accurately describe the sizes of the polypeptides resulting from the processing events, we used MALDI-TOF-MS for the analysis of reduced processed products that corresponded to the polypeptides constituting the two isoforms of phytepsin from barley grains. The sizes determined for two or three independent phytepsin preparations were 9.2–9.5, 15.3–15.8, 26.4–26.7, 30.5–30.8, and 46–47 kDa. Accordingly, the polypeptides were named P9, P15, P27, P31, and P47 (indicated on the left side of Fig. 1). When we analyzed barley root extracts by Western blotting with the same anti-phytepsin antibody, we detected polypeptides P9, P15, and P31. We also detected a polypeptide of ∼26 kDa in roots instead of 27 kDa as previously observed in grains (14Runeberg-Roos P. Kervinen J. Kovaleva V. Raikhel N.V. Gal S. Plant Physiol. 1994; 105: 321-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), and additional polypeptides of approximately 42, 46, and 53 kDa (P42, P46, and P53, respectively) (Fig. 1, lane 2). The similarity among the molecular weights of polypeptides below 31,000 indicates that the processing of phytepsin follows a similar pathway in both grains and roots. P53 and P46 correspond to glycosylated prophytepsin and one-chain phytepsin, respectively. P42 probably corresponds to an additional independent isoenzyme characteristic of the root, as we discuss later in the text. Thus, the roots constitute a good model for studying the expression and processing of phytepsin during the intracellular transport to its final cellular location, the vacuole. The expression and processing of phytepsin were followed by pulse-chase labeling of the roots with [35S]methionine/cysteine. After labeling, the roots were homogenized under nondenaturing conditions, and the processing products were immunoprecipitated with anti-phytepsin antiserum and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2). The precursor P53 appeared during the first 30 min of the pulse, and its half-life was estimated to be 3 h because it was no longer detected 6 h after the beginning of the chase (Fig. 2, A and B). The primary processing products, P31 and P15, appeared 45 min after the pulse (Fig. 2 A), and the further processed polypeptides, P26 and P9, were only observed after 24 h of chase (Fig. 2 B). The processing products of phytepsin were still detected 3 days after the chase (data not shown), indicating a slow turnover rate. The pulse-chase analysis also showed the appearance of an additional protein, P42, 30 min after the pulse. The intensity of this protein remained constant for the entire 24-h chase period, which suggests that it is not related to the proteolytic processing described above. To study whether the processing of P53 occurred before prophytepsin reached the Golgi complex, we treated the roots with the fungal antibiotic brefeldin A, which is known to inhibit Golgi-mediated vesicular traffic by disrupting the Golgi apparatus (22Satiat-Jeunemaitre B. Cole L. Bourett T. Howard R. Hawes C. J. Micros. (Oxf.). 1996; 181: 162-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Incubation of root cells with brefeldin A before metabolic labeling followed by pulse-chase experiments showed the accumulation of P53, whereas for the nontreated cells at the same chase times, P53 was processed to the two-chain form P31 + P15 (Fig. 3). Brefeldin A affected the processing for several hours after treatment, and only partial processing of P53 was seen at the 2- and 5-h time points. The experiment with brefeldin A clearly shows that processing of P53, which leads to the formation of the two-chain form of phytepsin, occurs only after the precursor has reached the Golgi complex or has migrated beyond it. Brefeldin A did not have any effect on the P42 polypeptide, further corroborating our assumption that it is independent from the described proteolytic pathway. Endo H removes oligomannose but not complex-type N-linked glycans from glycoproteins. Processing of oligomannose to complex-type glycans occurs in the Golgi complex, and therefore, resistance to Endo H indicates localization of a glycoprotein at or beyond the Golgi complex. The prophytepsin sequence contains a singleN-glycosylation site located in P15, and the attached glycans in the mature P31 + P15 form are known to be of the plant complex type (23Costa J. Ashford D.A. Nimtz M. Bento I. Frazão C. Esteves C.L. Faro C.J. Kervinen J. Pires E. Verı́ssimo P. Wlodawer A. Carrondo M.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 695-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). During the time course of a 30-min chase, the 53-kDa precursor was partially sensitive to Endo H (detected as a wider band), with a shift of about 2 kDa (Fig. 4). This result shows that the glycans linked to the P53 proform are of the oligomannose type for about 30 min after the beginning of the chase, which corresponds to the time taken for the enzyme to reach the Golgi complex, where the glycans are modified. In contrast, the P15 chain was not sensitive to Endo H digestion at any time point (Fig. 4 B), indicating that P15 contains only complex-type glycans. Therefore, we conclude that P15 is produced only when prophytepsin has passed the Golgi complex and, most likely, in transit to or within the vacuole. Plant APs contain a conserved utilized glycosylation site in their plant-specific insert (10Runeberg-Roos P. Törmakangas K. Östman A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 202: 1021-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Since it has been suggested that the plant-specific insert might be important for transport to the vacuole (13Guruprasad K. Törmakangas K. Kervinen J. Blundell T.L. FEBS Lett. 1994; 352: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), we investigated the importance of glycans for the intracellular transport. We found that incubation of root cells with theN-glycosylation inhibitor tunicamycin did not inhibit processing of P53 (Fig. 5), but that the processing of P53 to P31 + P15 and P26 + P9 was actually accelerated when glycosylation was inhibited. These results suggest that the glycan moiety of phytepsin protects the enzyme from premature proteolytic cleavage in the Golgi apparatus. To enable a closer study on the processing pattern of phytepsin, we developed a recombinant expression method for this enzyme. Although several APs, including pepsinogen (24Lin X. Wong R.N.S. Tang J.

Kervinen, unpublished information. have been produced in bacterial expression systems, a general problem with these methods has been the very low yield of correctly folded product. Therefore, we chose a baculovirus-infected insect cell expression method for this study. Sf9 cells were infected by a recombinant baculovirus genome containing the complete coding region of preprophytepsin. After incubation for 4 days, a prominent polypeptide of 53 kDa was found in the medium, as analyzed by Western blotting using anti-phytepsin antiserum (not shown). After pepstatin-agarose column chromatography followed by ion exchange chromatography, a typical yield of about 0.5 mg of purified protein was obtained from 1 liter of the cell medium. MALDI-TOF-MS analysis revealed two proteins of 52,847 and 53,062 Da (Fig. 6), which migrated in SDS-PAGE as one broad band at 53 kDa (Fig. 7 A, lane 1). N-terminal sequencing gave one unambiguous sequence of EAEGLVRIAL (Fig. 8). This N-terminal sequence is similar to that previously obtained from in vitro expression in the presence of canine pancreatic microsomes (14Runeberg-Roos P. Kervinen J. Kovaleva V. Raikhel N.V. Gal S. Plant Physiol. 1994; 105: 321-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), which indicates that Sf9 cells are able to cleave the signal sequence from this plant protein to produce a secreted recombinant prophytepsin (rP53). In an isoelectric focusing gel, rP53 migrated to a pI of ∼5.3, which was identical to that observed for phytepsin purified from barley grains (data not shown).Figure 7Autoproteolytic processing of recombinant prophytepsin in vitro.

The higher molecular weight observed by MALDI-TOF-MS is due to the presence of oligosaccharides, confirmed by positive staining observed using the periodic acid Schiff method to detect the protein in the gel and indicates that the single potential glycosylation site is occupied. The observed main peak at 52,847 is consistent with the presence on pro-phytepsin of an N-linked oligosaccharide with the structure Man3GlcNAcFucGlcNAc characteristic of proteins expressed in insect cells (predicted molecular weight of 52, 839 (25Grabenhorst E. Hofer B. Nimtz M. Jäger V. Conradt H.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 189-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), assuming the presence of one sodium atom). The additional signals at 53,062 and 53,273 are probably due to the addition of one or two matrix molecules (sinapinic acid) with the concomitant loss of water (M + nx206) or to the presence of larger oligosaccharide chains. To study the capability of prophytepsin for autoproteolytic processing, we incubated rP53 in buffers over the pH range 3.7–6.5 at 37 °C and removed the samples at various time points. At pH 3.7, the processed polypeptides of 36 and 17 kDa (rP36 and rP17, respectively) were detected after 7 min of incubation, ind"

The complex is composed of four membrane-spanning polypeptides: glycoprotein (GP) Ibα, GP Ibβ, GP IX, and GP V. Glycoprotein Ibα contains a binding site for von Willebrand factor through which it mediates platelet adhesion; GP V is required for the complex to bind thrombin with high affinity; and both GP Ibβ and GP IX are necessary for efficient plasma membrane expression of the complex. To further define the roles of the individual polypeptide subunits in the biosynthesis and intracellular transport of the GP Ib-IX-V complex, we studied full and partial complexes expressed in heterologous mammalian cells. We found that the full complex was formed within minutes in the endoplasmic reticulum before being transported into the Golgi cisternae. Approximately 160 min were required for the complex to be fully processed and to appear on the plasma membrane. About 25% of GP Ibα expressed as part of either a GP Ib-IX complex or a GP Ib-IX-V complex was degraded through a nonlysosomal pathway. Over 60% of GP Ibα, however, was degraded when it was expressed in partial complexes with only GP Ibβ or GP IX. The increased degradation was blocked by treating cells either with brefeldin A to prevent the transport of proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi or with lysosomal inhibitors, indicating that GP Ibα expressed in partial complexes was targeted to the lysosomes for degradation. These results indicate that the presence of both GP Ibβ and GP IX, but not the presence of GP V, is required for efficient processing and targeting of GP Ibα to the plasma membrane. Absence of either GP Ibβ or GP IX increased the rate of GP Ibα degradation, providing an explanation for why mutation of their genes leads to deficient GP Ibα expression and platelet adhesion in Bernard-Soulier syndrome, the deficiency disorder of the complex.

When the blood vessel is injured, platelets adhere to the subendothelial matrix exposed at the site of injury.

This subunit also contains the sequence in its cytoplasmic domain that attaches the complex to the platelet cytoskeleton (15Andrews R.K. Fox J.E. J. Biol.

Glycoprotein V has recently been shown to play a role in forming a high affinity thrombin-binding site within the complex (17Dong J.-F. Sae-Tung G. López J.A. Blood. 1997; 89: 4355-4363Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The roles of GP Ibβ and GP IX in the functions of the complex have not been determined, with the exception that phosphorylation of GP Ibβ by protein kinase A appears to be responsible for inhibiting the collagen-induced actin polymerization observed in platelets treated with agents that elevate cytoplasmic cyclic AMP (18Fox J.E. Berndt M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9520-9526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These smaller polypeptides do influence complex synthesis, however, because both are required for efficient expression of GP Ibα on the plasma membrane (19López J.A. Leung B. Reynolds C.C. Li C.Q.

In vitro studies demonstrating these requirements are supported by the finding that mutations of both GP Ibβ and GP IX can cause Bernard-Soulier syndrome (the hereditary bleeding disorder caused by absence of the GP Ib-IX-V complex) by decreasing the amount of GP Ibα appearing on the cell surface (20Wright S.D.

Although the requirements for surface expression of a functional complex are fairly well understood, the mechanisms by which GP Ibβ and GP IX participate in this process are not. Defining these mechanisms was the focus of the studies reported here. We used mammalian cells expressing full or partial GP Ib-IX-V complexes to study assembly and transport of the complex and to determine how the individual components influence complex transport, degradation, and targeting to the plasma membrane. Transfected mammalian cell lines used in the studies are summarized in Table I.

Open table in a new tab Cells grown in 100-mm culture dishes were first incubated with a l-cystine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Tissue Culture Central Facility, University of California, San Francisco, CA) containing 5% dialyzed fetal bovine serum for 30 min at 37 °C and then pulse-labeled with 100 μCi of [35S]cysteine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 37 °C for the times indicated under “Results” for each experiment. At the end of the pulse labeling, the cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated at 37 °C for the indicated times with complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 50 times the normal concentrations of l-cystine. The labeled cells were then washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, and 1% digitonin. To inhibit proteolysis, the lysis buffer contained a mixture of protease inhibitors including 0.1 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor (Sigma), 160 μg/ml benzamidine (Sigma), 10 μg/ml of leupeptin (Sigma), 10 mm phenylmethanesulfonylfluoride (Sigma), and 5 mm EDTA. Lysates from the metabolically labeled cells were first incubated with 40 μl of a suspension of fixedStaphylococcus aureus beads (Pansorbin beads, Calbiochem Corp, La Jolla, CA) for 60 min at 4 °C to adsorb proteins bound nonspecifically. After the beads were removed by centrifugation, the cell lysate was incubated overnight at 4 °C with the GP Ibα antibody AK2 (1.2 μg/ml, kindly provided by Dr. Michael C. Berndt, Baker Medical Research Institute, Prahran, Victoria, Australia). The lysate was then incubated with a rabbit anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody at 4 μg/ml for an additional 60 min at 4 °C. To precipitate the complex, 40 μl of Pansorbin beads was added to the cell lysate and incubated for 60 min at 4 °C. The beads with bound proteins were separated from the supernatant by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The bead pellets were washed three times with ice-cold lysis buffer and resuspended in SDS sample buffer to a final concentration of 2% β-mercaptoethanol in the lysate. The protein samples were then denatured by boiling for 5 min. For the partial complex expressing only GP Ibβ and GP IX, the GP IX antibody SZ1 (2.5 μg/ml, Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA) was used for the precipitation. To specifically precipitate only the mature form of GP Ibα (27Dunphy W. Rothman J. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 270-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), the lysates were incubated with wheat germ agglutinin linked to Sepharose 4B beads (40 μl at 1 mg/ml, Sigma) overnight at 4 °C, and the beads were then washed several times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. The samples were then resuspended in SDS sample buffer and denatured as described above. The denatured protein samples were resolved on 4–20% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gels. To ensure equal loading, the total protein concentration of each sample was first determined using a commercial protein assay kit (BCA protein assay kit, Pierce), and 10 μg of total protein was loaded for each sample. After electrophoresis, the gels were fixed in a solution of 50% (v/v) methanol and 10% acetic acid in water for 30 min at room temperature and dried at 80 °C for 2 h. The dried gels were then exposed to a PhosphorImager plate for 72 h at room temperature. Incorporated [35S]cysteine was detected by scanning the plate on a Fuji BAS-1000 Bio-Imaging Analyzer (Fuji, Tokyo, Japan), and the data were analyzed with MacBAS software. All the experiments were performed three to six times in duplicate sets of CHO and L cell lines Endoglycosidase D (Endo-D, Boehringer Mannheim) and endoglycosidase H (Endo-H, Genzyme, Cambridge, MA) were used to determine the compartmental locations of the polypeptides during transport. Polypeptides are resistant to the actions of Endo-D until they reach the cis compartment of the Golgi; in contrast, the polypeptides are sensitive to the action of Endo-H until they enter the medial compartment of the Golgi. For Endo-D treatment, immunoprecipitated polypeptides were resuspended in 20 μl of sodium phosphate buffer, pH 5.5, and boiled for 5 min. The denatured samples were then treated with Endo-D (5 microunits/mg of protein) for 24 h at 37 °C. For Endo-H treatment, immunoprecipitated proteins were resuspended in 20 μl of 50 mm sodium citrate, pH 6.0, and denatured. The samples were then incubated with Endo-H at a final concentration of 10 μm/mg of protein for 12 h at 37 °C. Following the treatments, the protein samples were boiled again to inactivate the enzyme and resolved on reducing 4−20% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gels. To block transport of the polypeptides from the ER to the Golgi apparatus, brefeldin A (Sigma) was added to the medium at a final concentration of 5 μm during the pulse-chase experiments. To specifically inhibit lysosomal activity, cells were treated with a combination of NH4Cl and leupeptin (Sigma) at final concentrations of 50 μm and 20 μg/ml, respectively, during the pulse-chase experiments. Neither inhibitor has been shown to affect the efficiency of assembly of protein complexes or the rate of peptide glycosylation (28Minami Y. Weissman A. Samelson L. Klausner R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 2688-2692Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). To identify the polypeptides immunoprecipitated by the GP Ibα antibody AK2, portions of metabolically labeled cell lysates from LαβIX cells were separated on 4–20% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gels under reduced and nonreduced conditions in parallel with pulse-chase experiments. Separated polypeptides were electrophoretically transferred to the nitrocellulose membrane. To block nonspecific binding, the membranes were first incubated with 5% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 100 mm NaCl) for 60 min at room temperature. The membrane was then incubated for 60 min at room temperature in Tris-buffered saline containing the anti-GP Ibα monoclonal antibody, WM23 (kindly provided by Dr. Michael C. Berndt) at a final concentration of 1.0 μg/ml, 1% nonfat milk, and 0.2% Tween 20. After the membrane was washed to remove unbound antibody, specific antibody binding was visualized using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and luminol substrate with the ECL detection kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The identities of the individual polypeptides immunoprecipitated by the GP Ibα monoclonal antibody, AK2, were determined by two experimental means: by Western blotting using the monoclonal GP Ibα antibody WM23 and by comparing the sizes of the polypeptides separated on a polyacrylamide gel under reducing and nonreducing conditions. On a nonreducing gel, the disulfide link between GP Ibα and GP Ibβ remained intact, and a corresponding band with the combined molecular mass of GP Ibα and GP Ibβ was detected by WM23 (Fig. 1 A). The molecular mass of the band dropped by the expected amount in the reducing gel (Fig. 1 A). On the autoradiograph, the GP Ibβ band disappeared in the nonreducing gel with a corresponding increase in the molecular mass of the GP Ibα band (Fig. 1 B). Three polypeptides, GP Ibα, GP Ibβ, and GP IX, were seen on the autoradiograph of the AK2 immunoprecipitate under reducing conditions (Fig. 1 B), with GP Ibα being detected by WM23 on Western blot (Fig. 1 A). To study the rate and sequence of complex assembly, L cells expressing the full GP Ib-IX-V complex (LαβIXV cells) were metabolically labeled with [35S]cysteine for 5 min and chased for 0, 0.5, 2, 5, and 10 min at 37 °C. The cells were then lysed with 1% digitonin, and the complex was immunoprecipitated with AK2. All four polypeptides of the complex, GP Ibα, GP Ibβ, GP IX, and GP V, were precipitated by the antibody after 5 min of pulse labeling, with or without chase (Fig. 2 A). The apparent molecular mass of GP Ibα was approximately 70 kDa, overlapping with GP V. This low molecular mass form of GP Ibα corresponded to an intermediate form of GP Ibα that was partially N-glycosylated (10López J.A. Chung D.W. Fujikawa K. Hagen F.S. Papayannopoulou T. Roth G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 5615-5619Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) but had not undergone O-glycosylation (10López J.A. Chung D.W. Fujikawa K. Hagen F.S. Papayannopoulou T. Roth G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 5615-5619Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 29Dong J.-F. Li C.Q. López J.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13946-13953Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). BecauseO-glycosylation occurs only in the Golgi cisternae, this result suggested that the four polypeptides became associated very rapidly after their synthesis and transport into the ER. To confirm the ER location of complex formation, we treated the cell lysates with Endo-D and detected no molecular mass decrease of GP Ibα (Fig. 2 B), indicating that the complex had indeed formed in the ER. A glycoprotein becomes Endo-D-sensitive only when its high mannose sugars have been processed to Man5GlcNAc2oligosaccharide intermediates by α-1,2-mannosidase I, which resides in the cis-Golgi; thus Endo-D resistance indicates that a glycoprotein is located in the ER or in pre-cis Golgi cisternae (30Koide N. Muramatsu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 4897-4904Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Next, we determined the time required for transport of the newly synthesized GP Ib-IX-V complex to the cell surface. Cells that express the full complex (αβIXV cells) were first pulse-labeled with [35S]cysteine for 10 min and then chased for 0, 30, 90, and 150 min. They were then lysed with 1% digitonin, and GP Ibα was immunoprecipitated with AK2. To follow the intracellular location of GP Ibα, half of the samples from each time point were treated with Endo-H, an endoglycosidase that cleaves only N-glycan substrates before they are trimmed by mannosidase II in themedial Golgi. Fully mature GP Ibα was recognized by precipitation with wheat germ agglutinin, a lectin that binds to the terminal sialic acids of GP Ibα carbohydrate chains (31Korrel S.A. Clemetson K.J. Van Halbeek H. Kamerling J.P. Sixma J.J. Vliegenthart J.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 140: 571-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 32Clemetson K.J. George J.N. Nurden A.T. Phillips D.R. Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins. Plenum Press, New York1985: 51-85Crossref Google Scholar). Sialic acid is only added in the late Golgi compartments. When αβIXV cells were pulse-labeled with [35S]cysteine for 10 min, a low molecular mass, Endo-H–sensitive form of GP Ibα can be detected after 0, 30, and 90 min chases (Fig. 3). In parallel, a high molecular mass, fully glycosylated form of GP Ibα (125 kDa) became apparent after 30 min of chase. This high molecular mass form of GP Ibα was resistant to Endo-H treatment, indicating that the polypeptide had passed the medial Golgi compartment (Fig. 3). The ratio of high to low molecular mass forms of GP Ibα increased with increasing chase time. At 150 min, almost all of the newly synthesized GP Ibα had been converted to the high molecular mass form that could be precipitated by wheat germ agglutinin (data not shown), indicating that the complex requires approximately 160 min from the time of its synthesis to reach the cell surface. In addition to the processing of GP Ibα we observed in the pulse-chase experiments, we also noted an overall decrease in the density of GP Ibα over time. After 160 min of chase, only 75% of the original labeled amount of GP Ibα can be detected in pulse-chase experiments with LαβIXV cells, indicating that a portion is being degraded intracellularly. The degradation could not be inhibited by treating the cells with the lysosomal inhibitors leupeptin and ammonium chloride but was prevented by treating the cells with brefeldin A (data not shown). Having quantitated GP Ibα degradation in the full complex, we investigated whether lack of the other complex polypeptides lead to further degradation of GP Ibα. First, we studied whether GP V had any influence on GP Ibα degradation. Our previous studies had shown that the polypeptide has very little influence on the surface level of GP Ibα (24Li C.Q. Dong J. Lanza F. Sanan D.A. Sae-Tung G. López J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16302-16307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). We compared GP Ibα degradation in a cell line expressing the full complex (αβIXV cells) to that in cells lacking only GP V (αβIX cells). Both cell lines were pulse-labeled for 30 min and chased for up to 150 min. GP Ibα was immunoprecipitated with AK2 and electrophoresed. The densities of GP Ibα bands and the ratio of the high to low molecular mass forms were determined as an index of GP Ibα maturation. The extent of GP Ibα maturation was similar whether GP V was present or not (Fig. 4, Aand B). We next studied the roles of GP Ibβ and GP IX in the synthesis and transport of GP Ibα. For these studies, we immunoprecipitated GP Ibα with the monoclonal antibody AK2. Previously studies have shown that this antibody recognizes GP Ibα in the absence of the other GP Ib-IX polypeptides. Its epitope has been localized to the amino-terminal 275 amino acid residues of GP Ibα, and it has been shown to be capable of precipitating a proteolytic fragment containing only this region (33Berndt M.C. Du X Booth W.J. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 633-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 47Ward C.M. Andrews R.K. Smith A.I. Berndt MC. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4929-4938Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). AK2 also binds GP Ibα in full or partial complexes expressed in mammalian cells (19López J.A. Leung B. Reynolds C.C. Li C.Q. Fox J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12851-12859Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results indicated that binding of AK2 to GP Ibα did not require the presence of other subunits and that the epitope specificity of AK2 was not altered when GP Ibα was expressed in a partial complex. To evaluate intracellular degradation of GP Ibα, cell lines that express the full complex (αβIXV cells), only GP Ibα and GP Ibβ (αβ cells), and only GP Ibα and GP IX (αIX cells) were pulse-labeled for 10 min and chased for up to 150 min. The complexes were immunoprecipitated with AK2. In both of the cell lines with partial complexes, over 60% of GP Ibα was degraded during the 150-min chase period compared with the 25% of GP Ibα degraded in the full complex over the same time period (Fig. 5). Glycoprotein Ibα was degraded more rapidly in αIX cells than in αβ cells. Another obvious difference between the cells expressing the full complex and those with partial complexes was that only in the cells with a full complex was a significant proportion of GP Ibα processed to the mature high molecular mass form. We also found that AK2 coprecipitated both GP Ibα and GP Ibβ in αβ cells but failed to coprecipitate GP IX in αIX cells (Fig. 5), indicating that GP Ibα did not directly associate with GP IX. In contrast to the rapid degradation of GP Ibα in partial complexes, neither GP Ibβ nor GP IX was significantly degraded in CHOβIX cells over the 150-min chase period (Fig. 5). Because a greater amount of GP Ibα was degraded during transport in the partial complexes (αβ and αIX cells), it was of interest to determine the subcellular department where the degradation occurred. To locate the degradation site, Lαβ cells were pulsed and chased either in the presence of brefeldin A (34Lippincott-Schwartz J. Yuan L. Bonifacino J. Klausner R. Cell. 1989; 56: 801-813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1304) Google Scholar) or in the presence of two lysosomal inhibitors, leupeptin and ammonium chloride. Brefeldin A essentially abrogated the degradation (Fig. 6), suggesting that degradation was a post-ER event. The bulk of the degradation was also inhibited by treating cells with leupeptin and ammonium chloride (Fig. 6), indicating that GP Ibα in the partial complexes was targeted to the lysosomes where it was rapidly degraded. The GP Ib-IX-V complex is a large and complicated assembly of polypeptides on the plasma membrane. It contains four polypeptide subunits, likely present as multiple copies in the functional receptor (1López J.A. Blood Coagul. Fibrinolysis. 1994; 5: 97-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). In the current studies, we sought to elucidate how this complex is assembled in the cell and transported to the plasma membrane and to understand how its nonligand-binding subunits, GP Ibβ, GP IX, and GP V, participate in this process. The studies were carried out on transfected mammalian cell lines that express full or partial complexes. In cells expressing the full complex, we found that the complex was fully assembled in the endoplasmic reticulum at the earliest times after pulse labeling the cells with [S35]cysteine (Fig. 2 A). Complex assembly in the ER was confirmed by two means. First, GP Ibα precipitated at the earliest time of pulsing (5 min) was present as a low molecular mass form lacking O-glycosylation (Fig. 2 A), a modification that only occurs in the Golgi compartments (35Alberts B. Bray D. Lewis J. Raff M. Roberts K. Watson J. Molecular Biology of the Cell. Garland Publishing, Inc., New York1989: 201-836Google Scholar). Second, this immature form of GP Ibα was resistant to Endo-D treatment, indicating that it had yet to reach thecis-Golgi (Fig. 2 B) (30Koide N. Muramatsu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 4897-4904Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Chen C. Bonifacino J. Yuan L. Klausner R. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 2149-2161Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). These findings put the GP Ib-IX-V complex into a large group of multiple subunit and multimeric membrane protein complexes that form in the ER, including the T cell receptor (37Alarcon B. Berkhout B. Breitmeyer J. Terhorst C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2953-2961Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), acetylcholine receptor (38Merlie J.P. Smith M.M. J. Membr. Biol. 1986; 91: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), influenza hemagglutinin trimer (39Copeland C. Doms R. Bolzau E. Wester R. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 1179-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), and acetylcholinesterase (40Rotundo R. Thomas K. Porter-Jordan K. Benson R. Fernandez-Valle C. Fine R. J Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3146-3152Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Once the complex is formed, it is transported into the Golgi compartments for further modifications, most notablyO-glycosylation, which causes a large increase in the molecular mass of GP Ibα (Fig. 3) as expected based on the determination that approximately half of the molecular mass of the extracellular domain of GP Ibα in platelets is from carbohydrate (31Korrel S.A. Clemetson K.J. Van Halbeek H. Kamerling J.P. Sixma J.J. Vliegenthart J.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 140: 571-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The modifications took approximately 160 min to complete because wheat germ agglutinin could only precipitate GP Ibα after a 150-min chase. We chose wheat germ agglutinin because it recognizes the terminal sialic acids on O-linked oligosaccharides of GP Ibα (32Clemetson K.J. George J.N. Nurden A.T. Phillips D.R. Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins. Plenum Press, New York1985: 51-85Crossref Google Scholar, 41Solum N.O. Hagen I Filion-Myklebust C. Stabaek T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 597: 235-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 42Madoff M.A. Ebbe S. Baldini M. J. Clin. Invest. 1964; 43: 870-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Sialylation is the last modification of O-linked carbohydrate chains to occur before glycoproteins are either secreted or expressed on the plasma membrane. Early formation of the complex suggests that assembly is a prerequisite for transport. One apparent reason for such early assembly is to prevent the polypeptides from being degraded during transport, a possibility that prompted us to investigate the stability of the polypeptides when formation of a full complex was precluded. In studies of GP Ibα stability, we observed that about 25% of GP Ibα expressed even in the full complex was degraded by nonlysosomal mechanisms. We then investigated whether a higher proportion of GP Ibα would be degraded if any of the other polypeptides were excluded from the complex. Glycoprotein V was our first target, based on its loose association with the other subunits and the observations that GP V is not required for efficient expression of the complex on the cell surface (19López J.A. Leung B. Reynolds C.C. Li C.Q. Fox J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12851-12859Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Li C.Q. Dong J. Lanza F. Sanan D.A. Sae-Tung G. López J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16302-16307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). We found that GP Ibα was degraded to a similar extent in the presence or absence of GP V (Fig. 4 A). The polypeptide also did not influence the rate of GP Ibα intracellular transport as indicated by its lack of influence on the appearance of the mature higher molecular mass form of GP Ibα (Fig. 4 B). These results are consistent with our previous findings that GP V does not enhance the surface expression of GP Ibα (19López J.A. Leung B. Reynolds C.C. Li C.Q. Fox J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12851-12859Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Li C.Q. Dong J. Lanza F. Sanan D.A. Sae-Tung G. López J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16302-16307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) although its presence may be important in inducing high affinity binding of thrombin to the complex (17Dong J.-F. Sae-Tung G. López J.A. Blood. 1997; 89: 4355-4363Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Also consistent with these findings, no cases of Bernard-Soulier syndrome caused by mutations of GP V gene have yet been reported. Unlike GP V, however, both GP Ibβ and GP IX are important for GP Ibα stability. Lack of either of these subunits led to degradation of over 60% of GP Ibα during the 150-min chase period (Fig. 5). Degradation above that observed with the full complex occurred before GP Ibα was fully O-glycosylated and was completely inhibited by the lysosomal inhibitors leupeptin and NH4Cl. This finding indicates that one role of the association of GP Ibα with GP Ibβ and GP IX is to prevent lysosomal targeting. The protective effects appear to correlate with whether two subunits associate because degradation of GP Ibα was greater in αIX cells than in αβ cells. We were able to demonstrate association of GP Ibα with GP Ibβ but not with GP IX in these partial complexes (Fig. 5), consistent with our previously reported results (43López J.A. Weisman S. Sanan D.A. Sih T. Chambers M. Li C.Q. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23716-23721Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In cells containing both GP Ibβ and GP IX, these polypeptides degraded to a much lesser extent than did GP Ibα (Fig. 5), suggesting that intracellular degradation may specifically target to the latter polypeptide. This could be because levels of GP Ibα have to be more tightly regulated, because it contains most of the sites through which the GP Ib-IX-V complex interacts with other proteins. Glycoprotein Ibβ and GP IX are resistant to proteolysis when complexed with each other, although only the stability of GP Ibβ has been studied when expressed alone (23Kunishima S. López J.A. Kobayashi S. Imai N. Kamiya T. Saito H. Naoe T. Blood. 1997; 89: 2404-2412Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Stability of GP Ibβ appears to be unaffected by the presence of GP IX. This selective degradation may serve as a checkpoint to ensure expression of only the correctly assembled and biologically active GP Ib-IX-V complexes on the plasma membrane (36Chen C. Bonifacino J. Yuan L. Klausner R. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 2149-2161Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar,44Sussman J. Bonifacino J. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Weissman A. Saito T. Klausner R. Ashwell J. Cell. 1988; 52: 85-95Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). A similar situation exists for the well studied T cell receptor-CD3 complex. When expressed alone in COS cells, CD3γ, CD3ε, and ζ are stable, whereas TCRα, TCRβ, and CD3δ are rapidly degraded (45Wileman T. Carson G. Concino M. Ahmed A. Terhorst C. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 973-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 46Hall C. Berkhout B. Breitmeyer J. Terhorst C. Int. Immunol. 1991; 3: 359-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). A subcomplex is therefore stable if it contains one or more stable chains (CD3γ, CD3ε, or ζ) but is not stable when it contains only the unstable chains (TCRα, TCRβ, and CD3δ), suggesting that a stable polypeptide, by associating with an unstable one, can prevent the latter from being degraded. In summary, we have demonstrated that formation the GP Ib-IX-V complex occurs immediately after synthesis of its constituent polypeptides. This newly assembled complex takes approximately 3 h to reach the cell surface, in transit undergoing a number of post-translational modifications. Efficient transport of the ligand-binding subunit of the complex, GP Ibα, to the plasma membrane requires both GP Ibβ and GP IX, which direct GP Ibα away from lysosomes and therefore protect it from proteolysis. Subcomplexes of different polypeptides form normally within the cell, but GP Ibα in complexes lacking GP Ibβ or GP IX is more susceptible to lysosomal proteolysis. Our studies provide evidence that a decreased or absent expression of the GP Ib-IX-V complex caused by the mutations in GP Ibβ or GP IX in Bernard-Soulier syndrome patients is due to intracellular degradation of the complex as well as defective membrane targeting."

The inhibitory activities of the three serpins are accelerated by the presence of glycosaminoglycans such as heparin (5Tollefsen D.M. Majerus D.W. Blank M.K. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14156-14161Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and PN1 (16Stone S.R. Brown-Luedi M.L. Rovelli G. Guidolin A. McGlynn E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7731-7735Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) have shown that heparin-accelerated inhibition by ATIII and PN1 occurs by a template mechanism. As heparin binds to ATIII and PN1 with a higher affinity than for thrombin (17Olson S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1698-1708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the template mechanism involves the binding of heparin to a conserved site on the serpin (18Carrell R.W. Stein P.E. Fermi G. Wardell M.R. Structure. 1994; 2: 257-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 19Evans D. Christey P.B. Carrell R.W. Festoff B.W. Serine Proteases and Their Serpin Inhibitors in the Nervous System. Plenum, New York1990: 69-78Crossref Google Scholar). The serpin-heparin complex then quickly associates with the heparin binding site on thrombin (anion-binding exosite-II) through electrostatic interactions (20Sheehan J.P. Tollefsen D.M. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32747-32751Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the mechanism for glycosaminoglycan-accelerated inhibition of thrombin by HCII seems to be different to that of ATIII and PN1. Inhibition studies of α-, βT- (cleaved at Arg77a), and γT-thrombin (cleaved at Arg67, Arg77a, and Lys149e) by HCII and ATIII in the absence and presence of glycosaminoglycan (21Rogers S.J. Pratt C.W. Whinna H.C. Church F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3613-3617Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that anion-binding exosite-I of thrombin is important for rapid inhibition by HCII. HCII contains an N-terminal acidic region (residues 56–75) similar to the C-terminal tail of hirudin (22Ragg H. Ulshofer T. Gerewitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5211-5218Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The HCII acidic domain is required for inhibition of thrombin in the presence of glycosaminoglycan by interacting with thrombin's exosite-I, and it is also postulated to bind to the glycosaminoglycan binding site in the absence of glycosaminoglycans (22Ragg H. Ulshofer T. Gerewitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5211-5218Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Hortin G.L. Tollefsen D.M. Benutto B.M. J. Biol.

Thus, HCII inhibition of thrombin with glycosaminoglycan is consistent with a “double-bridge” mechanism where (i) glycosaminoglycan binds both to the glycosaminoglycan binding site of HCII and exosite-II of α-thrombin, forming a ternary complex, and (ii) the displaced acidic domain of HCII interacts with thrombin's exosite-I, thereby facilitating rapid complex formation (21Rogers S.J. Pratt C.W. Whinna H.C. Church F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3613-3617Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Van Deerlin V.M.D. Tollefsen D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20223-20231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sheehan et al. (20Sheehan J.P. Tollefsen D.M. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32747-32751Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) examined the HCII inhibition of thrombin exosite-I and exosite-II mutants in the presence of glycosaminoglycans. These data suggest that dermatan sulfate acceleration of HCII inhibition is primarily due to only an “allosteric” mechanism in which dermatan sulfate binding to the serpin promotes an interaction with exosite-I (essentially the same as in (ii) above). It was also suggested that the ternary complex (described in (i) above) played a minor role during the heparin-accelerated HCII inhibition of thrombin (20Sheehan J.P. Tollefsen D.M. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32747-32751Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This paper investigates the interaction of three heparin-binding serpins with the thrombin anion-binding exosite-I. Past work has not fully examined the contribution of all the basic residues of thrombin's exosite-I with ATIII and HCII (20Sheehan J.P. Tollefsen D.M. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32747-32751Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Sheehan J.P. Wu Q. Tollefsen D.M. Sadler J.E. J. Biol.

J. 1989; 257: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) in the absence and presence of glycosaminoglycans. An extensive study will define those residues involved in interactions between thrombin's exosite-I and various domains on ATIII, HCII, and PN1. These studies further emphasize mechanistic differences in how different glycosaminoglycan-dependent serpins recognize thrombin, especially through exosite-I-dependent mechanisms. This work clearly establishes a very prominent, a less prominent, and a nonessential role for thrombin's exosite-I in HCII-, PN1-, and ATIII-thrombin inhibition reactions, respectively. Human plasma thrombin was prepared as described previously (27Stone S.R. Hofsteenge J. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 4622-4628Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar) and active site titrated with p-nitrophenolp′-guanidinobenzene to determine the concentration of active thrombin molecules (28Chase T. Shaw E. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 2212-2224Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). The expression, purification, and characterization of recombinant and mutant thrombins 4Standard nomenclature is used to describe mutant thrombins. The first letter shows the amino acid in the wild type to be replaced, and the second letter shows the amino acid used for the substitution (e.g. the mutant thrombin R67Q represents the substitution of Arg67 with Gln.

ATIII was purified from human plasma as described by McKay (29McKay E.J. Thromb. Res. 1981; 21: 375-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). HCII was purified to homogeneity from human plasma as described previously (30Griffith M.J. Noyes C.M. Tyndall J.A. Church F.C. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 6777-6782Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). PN1 was purified as described previously (26Wallace A. Rovelli G. Hofsteenge J. Stone S.R. Biochem. J. 1989; 257: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The chromogenic substrates S2238 (H-D-Pro-Pip-Arg-pNA) and S2266 (H-d-Val-Leu-Arg-pNA) were purchased from Chromogenix (Quadratech, Surrey, UK). Heterogeneous porcine heparin was purchased from Grampian Enzymes (Arthrath, Scotland), and dermatan sulfate (Chondroiten) was purchased from Sigma (Poole, Dorset, UK). The value for the association rate constant (k on) for thrombin(s) and the serpins HCII, ATIII, and PN1 in the absence of glycosaminoglycan were determined using pseudo-first order kinetics. For HCII, the value of k on was determined by preincubating a 400-μl volume containing 1 μm HCII and 0.1 μg/ml polybrene in 1 × assay buffer at 37 °C. Adding thrombin to a final concentration of 50 nm started the reaction. At various time points, a 20-μl aliquot was removed and added to 230 μl of 200 μm S2266 in assay and incubated at 37 °C for 4 min in a Thermomax plate reader (Molecular Devices) to measure the initial velocity of residual thrombin. A control reaction was also performed with the same components except that HCII was omitted. The amount of uninhibited thrombin present is proportional to its initial velocity and obeys the equation At =A 0 e-k't, wheret is the time the sample was taken, At and A 0 are the velocities at timest and zero, respectively, and k′ is the apparent first order rate constant. The value for the second order rate constantk on was determined by dividing k′ by the inhibitor concentration. For the serpins ATIII and PN1, the value for k onwas determined using progress curve kinetics. Cuvettes containing 100–200 μm S2238 and serpin (15 μm ATIII or 150 nm PN1) were preheated at 37 °C for 10 min and then transferred to a Hewlett-Packard spectrophotometer. Reactions were started by the addition of thrombin to 100 pm, and the release of p-nitroaniline from the hydrolysis of S2238 was followed by measuring the absorbance at 400–410 nm. Progress curves for the formation of product are described by the following equation (31Morrison, J. F. (1982) Trends Biochem. Sci.102–105Google Scholar, 32Stone S.R. Braun P.J. Hofsteenge J.

Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3542-3549Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar): P=vst+v0−vs1−e−k′t/k′(Eq. 1) where P is the amount of p-nitroanilide at time t, k′ is the apparent first order rate constant, and v 0 and v s are the initial and steady-state velocities, respectively. Progress curves fitted to the equation gave estimates for k′,v 0, and vs . The association rate constant k on was calculated using the following equation (33Rovelli G. Stone S.R. Guidolin A. Sommer J. Monard D. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3542-3549Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar): kon=k′1−vs/v01+[S]/Km/[I](Eq. 2) where [S] is the concentration of S2238 and K m is the Michaelis constant. At least two progress curves were performed for each enzyme-inhibitor combination, with the calculated values for k on reported as a weighted mean. Progress curve kinetics were used to estimate the value of k on for the interaction of native and variant thrombins with the serpins HCII, ATIII, and PN1 in the presence of the glycosaminoglycans heparin (heterogeneous) and dermatan sulfate under pseudo-first order conditions. The dependence of thek on value for the inhibition of recombinant native and plasma thrombin on the concentration of glycosaminoglycans was determined by incubating ATIII (200 nm) or PN1 (2 nm) with heparin concentrations ranging from 1 to 1000 nm, in the presence of S-2238 (50–400 μm) for 10 min at 37 °C. Reactions were followed by the release of p-nitroaniline on a Hewlett Packard spectrophotometer after the addition of thrombin to a final concentration of 200 pm. The effects of both heparin and dermatan sulfate on thek on value were examined for HCII. HCII (25 nm) was incubated with varying concentrations of heparin (25 nm–25 μm) and dermatan sulfate (2–50 μm), and the reactions were started as described above. Values for k on were calculated using Equations 1and 2. The optimum concentrations of glycosaminoglycan and S2238 were used to determine k on for all the recombinant thrombin mutants. The heparin cofactor II-thrombin complex was constructed essentially as described previously (34Cooper S.T. Whinna H.C. Jackson T.P. Boyd J.M. Church F.C. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12991-12997Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) using the Homology module of the Insight II molecular modeling package (Version 2.3.0, BIOSYM Technologies, Inc., San Diego). The x-ray crystal structure of α-thrombin complexed with residues 55–65 of hirudin, and d-Phe-Pro-Arg-chloromethyl ketone was obtained from the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank (Ref. 35Banner D.W. Hadväry P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20085-20093Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; Brookhaven entry 1DWE). The coordinates of the backbone atoms in the two thrombin molecules were aligned in Insight II with a root mean square deviation of 0.595. Connolly solvent-accessible surfaces for heparin cofactor II, thrombin,d-Phe-Pro-Arg-chloromethyl ketone, and hirudin were created in Insight II using a probe radius of 1.4 Å. Values for the association rate constant (k on) for the inhibition of native plasma thrombin (pIIa), recombinant native thrombin (rIIa), and mutant thrombins by ATIII and PN1 were determined under pseudo-first order conditions using progress curve kinetics. Plasma thrombin and rIIa were inhibited by ATIII (Table I) and PN1 (Table II) withk on values similar to previously reported values (16Stone S.R. Brown-Luedi M.L. Rovelli G. Guidolin A. McGlynn E.

The largest deviations found for ATIII inhibition were 1.5-fold for the mutants R73Q (0.82 × 104m−1s−1) and K149eQ (1.82 × 104m−1 s−1) compared with rIIa (1.23 × 104m−1s−1). A similar trend was seen for PN1, where the greatest differences were only 1.5-fold for R73Q (0.89 × 106m−1 s−1) and K149eQ (1.84 × 106m−1 s−1) when compared with rIIa (1.23 × 106m−1s−1) (Table II). The optimum heparin concentration required to achieve the maximum k on value for the inhibition of pIIa and rIIa by the serpins ATIII and PN1 was determined by comparing k on values over a range of heparin concentrations (1–1000 nm). Both plasma and recombinant thrombins showed typical bell-shaped inhibition rate curves with dependence of the k on values for PN1 and ATIII on heparin concentration (Fig. 1). The inhibition of pIIa and rIIa by ATIII gave maximalk on values (0.75 × 108m−1 s−1 and 1.19 × 108m−1 s−1, respectively) at 50 nm heparin (Fig. 1, Table I). Maximalk on rates for PN1 were seen with pIIa (2.56 × 109m−1 s−1) and rIIa (2.52 × 109m−1s−1) at 20 nm heparin (Fig. 1, Table II). PN1 and ATIII were then used at their optimal concentration of heparin for inhibition studies on the thrombin exosite-I mutants. There were no major differences in the k onvalues for the exosite-I mutants when compared with rIIa for ATIII, with k on varying no more than ∼1.4-fold (Table I). The increase in k on for each thrombin exosite-I mutant in the presence of heparin and ATIII was similar to rIIa (9,675-fold), varying from 8,626-fold (K149eQ) to 15,172-fold (R67Q). Likewise, many of the thrombin exosite-I mutants did not have any significant effects on inhibition by PN1 in the presence of 20 nm heparin (Table II). However, the exosite-I mutants R35Q and R77aQ showed decreases in k on (3.7- and 3.2-fold, respectively) when compared with rIIa, whereas there were 2-fold decreases in k on for the inhibition of R67Q, R73Q, and R75Q by PN1 with heparin. Rate enhancement by heparin for the inhibition of R35Q and R77aQ by PN1 was only 553- and 743-fold compared with rIIa (2,049-fold), whereas the rest of the mutants ranged from 1,018-fold (R67Q) to 2,194-fold (K81Q). Pseudo-first order kinetics were used to examine the effects of mutations on the inhibition of thrombin by HCII. Recombinant and plasma native thrombins were inhibited with similar values for k on (both 1.1 × 103m−1 s−1) (Table III), which were approximately 2-fold higher to previously published values (21Rogers S.J. Pratt C.W. Whinna H.C. Church F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3613-3617Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This variance is most likely due to differences in reaction temperature (37 °Cversus ambient temperature) and buffer systems. With the exception of K149eQ, the exosite-I mutants show between 2–3-fold reductions in k on values (Table III).Table IIIEffect of thrombin anion-binding exosite-I mutants during heparin cofactor II inhibition in the absence and presence of glycosaminoglycansIIa speciesk on × 10−3(m−1 s−1) no GAGk on-mutant/k on-rIIak on× 10−7 (m−1 s−1) (+) heparink on-mutant/k on-rIIaHeparin acceleration fold increaseAccel-mutant/Accel-rIIak on × 10−7 (m−1 s−1) (+) Me2SO4k on-mutant/k on-rIIaMe2SO4acceleration fold increaseAccel-mutant/Accel-rIIapIIa1.100.994.480.60407270.601.800.83163630.84rIIa1.111.007.501.00675681.002.161.00194591.00R35Q0.560.503.000.40535710.790.700.32125000.64K36Q0.480.433.030.40631250.930.300.1462500.32R67Q0.490.440.017<0.013470.010.003<0.0161<0.01R73Q0.340.310.540.07158820.240.0450.0213230.07R75Q0.520.473.520.47676921.000.400.1976920.40R77aQ0.670.604.270.57637310.940.740.34110450.57K81Q0.560.502.560.34457140.680.520.2492860.48K109Q0.420.382.550.34607140.900.470.22111900.58K110Q0.470.422.650.35563830.830.400.1985110.44K149eQ0.930.844.850.65521500.771.510.70162370.83Inhibition assays were performed at 37 °C in Tris-buffered saline plus 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin as detailed under “Experimental Procedures.” Open table in a new tab Inhibition assays were performed at 37 °C in Tris-buffered saline plus 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin as detailed under “Experimental Procedures.” Maximal k on values for the inhibition of rIIa and pIIa by HCII were determined by comparingk on values with various concentrations of these glycosaminoglycans (Fig. 1).

Dermatan sulfate at 30 μm gave optimalk on values for rIIa and pIIa of 2.2 × 107m−1 s−1 and 1.8 × 107m−1s−1, respectively (Fig. 1, Table III).

Chem. 1994; 269: 32747-32751Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Rogers S.J. Pratt C.W. Whinna H.C. Church F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3613-3617Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), likely due both to differences in glycosaminoglycans and in buffer/temperature conditions. HCII was then used at its optimal concentration of heparin and dermatan sulfate for inhibition studies on the thrombin exosite-I mutants. The degree to which heparin-accelerated HCII inhibition of the exosite-I mutants R35Q, K36Q, R75Q, R77aQ, K81Q, K109Q, K110Q, and K149eQ varied from 45,714-fold (K81Q) to 67,692-fold (R75Q) compared with rIIa (67,568-fold) (Table III). Interestingly, heparin accelerated the inhibition of the two mutants, R67Q and R73Q, by HCII by only 347- and 15,882-fold, respectively (Table III). The k on values for all other exosite-I mutants were approximately 2–3-fold lower than that for rIIa. These decreases in k on values in the presence of heparin paralleled the differences observed in the absence of heparin. In contrast, HCII inhibition of R73Q displayed a larger decrease (14-fold) in the k on value in the presence of heparin, whereas a very large decrease (441-fold) was observed with R67Q. Dermatan sulfate-catalyzed HCII inhibition of the exosite-I mutant K149eQ was similar to recombinant wild-type thrombin (Table III). The effect of the other exosite-I mutations was generally greater on the degree of dermatan sulfate acceleration compared with heparin (Table III). In particular, R67Q and R73Q were only accelerated 61- and 1323-fold, respectively, in the presence of dermatan sulfate. Additionally, the reduction of thek on values of HCII inhibition of the other exosite-I mutations was about 2-fold greater in the presence of dermatan sulfate than in the presence of heparin (Table III). The k on values for the inhibition of recombinant native thrombin by the serpins were not very different from those observed with plasma thrombin. The recombinant thrombins were expressed in a baculovirus system and were devoid of Asn60g-linked carbohydrate (37Myles T. Le Bonniec B.F. Stone S.R. Thromb. Haemost. 1993; 69: 1239Google Scholar, 38Le Bonniec B.F. Myles T. Johnson T. Knight C.G. Tapparelli C. Stone S.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7114-7122Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Thus, the absence of carbohydrate on recombinant thrombin does not influence the inhibitory activity of the serpins in the absence of glycosaminoglycan. The k on values for inhibition of the exosite-I mutants by ATIII and PN1 in the absence of heparin did not differ substantially from rIIa, suggesting that there are no significant interactions between these serpins and exosite-I. However, the inhibitory activity of HCII was affected by most of the exosite-I mutants, where k on values were decreased ∼2–3-fold. This is comparable with decreases in inhibition of γT-thrombin and thrombin Quick I (Arg67→Cys) by HCII (21Rogers S.J. Pratt C.W. Whinna H.C. Church F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3613-3617Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Phillips J.E. Shirk R.A. Whinna H.C. Henriksen R.A. Church F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3321-3327Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Whinna H.C. Church F.C. J. Protein Chem. 1993; 12: 677-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Although the slightly reduced k on values for the exosite-I mutants with HCII without glycosaminoglycan suggest that the acidic N-terminal domain is unlikely to make direct contact with exosite-I, these decreases indicate the possibility that a significant electrostatic field generated by the bound acidic domain of HCII can interact with the positive electrostatic potential of exosite-I. Therefore, exosite-I mutations that decrease this electrostatic field strength could slightly reduce the association rate constant between HCII and thrombin, which is consistent with our data. The inhibitory activities of all three serpins are greatly accelerated by the presence of glycosaminoglycans. Interestingly,k on values for the interaction of recombinant native thrombin with ATIII and HCII in the presence of heparin were consistently higher (1.8-fold) than those with plasma thrombin. This suggests that the Asn60g carbohydrate may slightly retard the association of HCII and ATIII with thrombin in the presence of heparin. This could be due to either charge repulsion or steric hindrance. The inhibition of thrombin by ATIII occurs by a two-step mechanism that is accelerated by heparin (7Olson S.T. Shore J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 14891-14895Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Stone S.R. Hermans J.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5164-5172Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This acceleration proceeds primarily by the formation of ATIII-heparin complexes, which then bind to exosite-II, using complementary electrostatic fields in a manner similar to the interaction between thrombin and the C-terminal tail of hirudin (13Sheehan J.P. Sadler J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5518-5522Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 14Gan Z.R. Li Y. Chen Z. Lewis S.D. Shafer J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1301-1305Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Extensive site-directed mutagenesis of the thrombin exosite-I (R35Q, K36Q, R67Q, R73Q, R75Q, R77aQ, K81Q, K109Q,K110Q, and K149eQ; Fig. 2,top panel) has shown that inhibition by ATIII in the absence and presence of heparin does not require any of the basic residues that form exosite-I. Our results complement past studies that suggested the interaction between ATIII/heparin and thrombin uses exosite-II for electrostatic interactions and that exosite-I has no valuable contribution to complex formation (Fig. 2, middle panel), either in “electrostatic steering” or in direct interactions by salt-bridging (13Sheehan J.P. Sadler J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5518-5522Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 14Gan Z.R. Li Y. Chen Z. Lewis S.D. Shafer J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1301-1305Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PN1 also inhibits thrombin in a two-step mechanism (8Stone S.R. Hermans J.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5164-5172Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and inhibition is heparin accelerated by a template mechanism similar to ATIII (26Wallace A. Rovelli G. Hofsteenge J. Stone S.R. Biochem. J. 1989; 257: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Thrombin inhibition by PN1 in the presence of heparin shows a small effect for the exosite-I mutants R35Q, R67Q, R73Q, R75Q, and R77aQ (Fig. 2), where there were decreases in the k on values of 3.7-, 2.2-, 2.0-, 1.8-, and 3.2-fold, respectively. The association rate constant for thrombin-PN1 interaction in the presence of heparin was 2.5 × 109m−1 s−1, which is more rapid than that usually observed for neutral molecules. The magnitude of thek on value suggested that electrostatic forces accelerated the interaction. The heparin-PN1 complex could use the negative electrostatic field generated by the heparin molecule to interact with the positive electrostatic field of exosite-II to accelerate the interaction and to promote a correct orientation for productive complex formation (41Karshikov A. Bode W. Tulinsky A. Stone S.R. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 727-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Complex formation could be further enhanced if heparin-bound PN1 could also utilize the electrostatic field generated by thrombin's exosite-I through electrostatic steering. Our results indicate that several of the exosite-I residues may participate to some extent to optimally align the PN1-heparin complex during thrombin inhibition. Thrombin inhibition by HCII is unique compared with the serpins ATIII and PN1 for three reasons: (a) the P1 residue is a leucine as opposed to the P1arginine of ATIII and PN1; (b) the glycosaminoglycans heparin and dermatan sulfate increase the rate of inhibition; and (c) the unique N-terminal acidic domain (21Rogers S.J. Pratt C.W. Whinna H.C. Church F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3613-3617Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Ragg H. Ulshofer T. Gerewitz J. J. Biol.

Like other thrombin macromolecular substrates, the N-terminal domain (homologous to the C terminus of hirudin) is rich in acidic and polar residues that are postulated to bind exosite-I (Fig. 3). There are two current models that explain the mechanism for glycosaminoglycan-accelerated inhibition of thrombin by HCII: the double-bridge mechanism (21Rogers S.J. Pratt C.W. Whinna H.C. Church F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3613-3617Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Van Deerlin V.M.D. Tollefsen D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20223-20231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the allosteric only model (20Sheehan J.P. Tollefsen D.M. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32747-32751Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In both models, it is assumed that the N-terminal acidic domain is displaced from the glycosaminoglycan binding site of HCII, thereby allowing the N-terminal domain to bind exosite-I (20Sheehan J.P. Tollefsen D.M. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32747-32751Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Rogers S.J. Pratt C.W. Whinna H.C. Church F.C. J. Biol.

The role of thrombin's exosite-I during inhibition by HCII has been partially characterized by studies using dysthrombin Quick I (39Phillips J.E. Shirk R.A. Whinna H.C. Henriksen R.A. Church F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3321-3327Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Whinna H.C. Church F.C. J. Protein Chem. 1993; 12: 677-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and exosite-I mutants R73E and R75E (20Sheehan J.P. Tollefsen D.M. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32747-32751Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Sheehan J.P. Wu Q. Tollefsen D.M. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3639-3645Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the current study, the effects of the majority of exosite-I mutants (R35Q, K36Q, R75Q, R77aQ, K81Q, K109Q,K110Q, and K149eQ) were minimal (Fig. 2, top and middle panels), which suggests that most of the basic residues in exosite-I make no major contacts with the acidic domain of HCII with or without glycosaminoglycans. In contrast, Arg67and Arg73 play a major role in complex formation with HCII in the presence of glycosaminoglycans (Fig. 2, bottom panel). It is interesting to note that the hirudin peptide (similar to the acidic domain of HCII) strongly interacts with both Arg67 and Arg73 of thrombin (Fig. 2,bottom panel). A large decrease in k on was found with R67Q thrombin in the presence of both glycosaminoglycans and HCII (441-fold for heparin, 721-fold for dermatan sulfate), which confirms that the structural integrity of the thrombin 70–80 loop (43Bode W. Turk D. Karshikov A. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 426-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar) is important for interactions between the HCII acidic domain and exosite-I. More moderate decreases of k on were seen for the mutant R73Q when inhibited in the presence of heparin (14-fold) and dermatan sulfate (48-fold), also suggesting that Arg73 may interact with the N-terminal domain of HCII (Fig. 2, bottom panel). The reasons for an overall greater effect by the thrombin exosite-I mutations in the presence of dermatan sulfate could indicate how different glycosaminoglycans might influence the binding mode of the N-terminal domain to exosite-I. Finally, dermatan sulfate is more dependent on the allosteric mechanism for HCII-thrombin inhibition than is heparin and might be more affected by alterations in exosite-I of thrombin (see below). The mechanism for glycosaminoglycan-accelerated inhibition of thrombin by HCII is dependent on the displacement of the N-terminal domain from the HCII glycosaminoglycan binding site so that it is free to interact with exosite-I of thrombin. The difference between the proposed double-bridge model (21Rogers S.J. Pratt C.W. Whinna H.C. Church F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3613-3617Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Van Deerlin V.M.D. Tollefsen D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20223-20231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the allosteric model (13Sheehan J.P. Sadler J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5518-5522Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) is the role of glycosaminoglycan acting as a secondary bridge between HCII and thrombin's exosite-II. When our thrombin exosite-I site-directed mutagenesis data are compared with those obtained from Sheehan et al. (20Sheehan J.P. Tollefsen D.M. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32747-32751Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Sheehan J.P. Wu Q. Tollefsen D.M. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3639-3645Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), some interesting observations can be made. First, the effect of the K149eQ mutation in this study is similar to that for the K149eA mutant (25Sheehan J.P. Wu Q. Tollefsen D.M. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3639-3645Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which suggests that this residue plays no significant part in the interaction of HCII with thrombin. However, the effect of the two exosite-I mutants R73E and R75E have more pronounced effects when compared with residues substituted with glutamine replacements used in this study (20Sheehan J.P. Tollefsen D.M. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32747-32751Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Sheehan J.P. Wu Q. Tollefsen D.M. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3639-3645Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In particular, the association rate constant for R73E in the presence of heparin was decreased 376-fold compared with 14-fold for R73Q. Likewise for the R73E substitution in the presence of dermatan sulfate, the decrease is 620-fold compared with a 48-fold decrease for R73Q. Thus, charge reversal has a major effect on the association rate constant. It seems likely that the charge reversal has affected a number of contacts in the exosite-I important for the formation of a stable complex. On the basis of a large effect of exosite-I mutations and the small effects by exosite-II mutations, Sheehan et al. (20Sheehan J.P. Tollefsen D.M. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32747-32751Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) concluded that the role of exosite-II for glycosaminoglycan-stimulated inhibition of thrombin by HCII was unimportant. They proposed that the major determinant for inhibition by HCII was allosteric,i.e. glycosaminoglycans bind to HCII and displace the N terminus that can then interact with exosite-I. However, many of the decreases in k on for the exosite-II mutants in the presence of heparin (14Gan Z.R. Li Y. Chen Z. Lewis S.D. Shafer J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1301-1305Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Sheehan J.P. Tollefsen D.M. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32747-32751Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) are of similar magnitude to the decreases in k on seen for the exosite-I mutants in this study. Taking into account the charge reversal of the exosite-II mutants, it seems that both exosites play an important part in heparin-mediated inhibition of thrombin by HCII. In contrast, exosite-II mutants had no effect on dermatan sulfate-accelerated inhibition of thrombin by HCII (20Sheehan J.P. Tollefsen D.M. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32747-32751Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that the two glycosaminoglycans employ different mechanisms for the inhibition of thrombin by HCII. Heparin employs the double-bridge model, whereby it binds to HCII displacing the acidic N-terminal region from the glycosaminoglycan binding site, allowing it to interact with the thrombin exosite-I through complementary electrostatic fields and also by acting as a template, bridging the HCII to exosite-II. Dermatan sulfate does not use exosite-II at all; therefore, the mode of thrombin inhibition is strictly allosteric."

The outer membrane of Escherichia coli and other Gram-negative bacteria has evolved to exclude harmful agents present in the surrounding environment while maintaining the ability to internalize required nutrients of low abundance. Although general barrier function is largely provided by the lipopolysaccharide comprising the outer leaflet of this asymmetric bilayer (1Lugtenberg B. Van Alphen L. Biochim. Biophys.

The comparison of passive diffusion channels with those functioning by facilitated diffusion illustrates the nature of modifications to the basic porin fold that confer specificity to the transport process (6Cowan S.W.

The acquisition of vitamin B12 and iron-bearing siderophores presents additional complications for E. colicells due to their relative low abundance and molecular masses that exceed the diffusion limit of porin channels (8Postle K. Mol. Microbiol. 1990; 4: 2019-2025Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The uptake of such compounds involves a related family of outer membrane, TonB-dependent receptors (e.g. FhuA, FepA, Cir) that selectively bind ligands with high affinity and derive the metabolic energy required for transport through a poorly understood coupling with the energy-transducing TonB complex (9Braun V. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 16: 295-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Structural models derived from sequence analysis (10Nau C.D. Konisky J. J.

Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 2736-2746Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have long suggested that TonB-dependent receptors consist of β-barrel transmembrane domains coupled with extramembrane loop regions that are extensive compared with those observed in porin structures. The recent spectroscopic analysis of FhuA (12Moeck G.S. Tawa P. Xiang H. Ismail A.A. Turnbull J.L. Coulton J.W. Mol.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14216-14224Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) contrasts with porin quaternary structure (6Cowan S.W. Schirmer T. Rummel G. Steiert M. Ghosh R. Pauptit R.A. Jansonius J.N. Rosenbusch J.P.

These pores are apparently coupled to extensive loop regions that provide the additional determinants required for function as selective, energy-dependent solute transporters. The btuB gene product from E. coli is a 66,412-dalton, TonB-dependent receptor essential for high-affinity uptake of cyanocobalamin that also serves as a receptor for the E group colicins, colicin A, and phage BF23 (16Heller K.

The present work describes procedures for overexpression and purification of theE. coli vitamin B12 receptor in quantities sufficient for characterization and crystallization trials and provides information on the secondary structure, aggregation state, and ligand binding properties of the purified, protein-detergent complex. Mega-10 (Anagrade) and octylglucoside (Sol grade) were obtained from Anatrace, Inc. Tryptone and yeast extract were purchased from Difco, DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B and Sephadex G-15 were purchased from Sigma and Pharmacia, respectively, and low molecular weight protein standards were purchased from Bio-Rad. Vitamin B12 and LPS1(E. coli serotype 055:B5 and EH100) were obtained from Sigma. Colicin E1 (23Zhang Y.-L. Cramer W.A. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 1666-1676Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and colicin E3 (24Jakes K. Zinder N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 3380-3384Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) were purified as described previously. The outer membrane protein-deficientE. coli strain TNE012 (K12 tsx−ompA− ompB−) was used for overexpression from plasmid pJC3 (25Clifton J. Structural Studies on the Vitamin B12 Receptor from Escherichia coli.Ph.D. thesis. Yale University, 1991Google Scholar). Cells grown at 37 °C to an OD600∼1.0 in RB medium (10 g of bactotryptone and 5 g of yeast extract per liter of 50 mm NaKPO4,pH 7.5) were harvested and stored at −20 °C until further use. Frozen cell pellets from 4 liters of culture were resuspended to approximately 20 ml with 200 mm Tris, pH 7.5 (the pH of all buffers was adjusted at room temperature). Lysozyme (30 mg dissolved in 200 mmTris) was added to stirred cells along with 23 ml of a 1 msucrose, 5 mm EDTA solution prepared by dissolving sucrose in 200 mm Tris and adding EDTA from a 100 mmstock, pH 7.5. After a 1-min incubation, 45 ml of distilled water and 800 μl of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (17.5 mg/ml) and N-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone (3.5 mg/ml) in ethanol were added. Cells were stirred for 30 min before the addition of 1.38 ml of 1 m MgSO4 and deoxyribonuclease (10 mg dissolved in 200 mm Tris). After a 15-min incubation, 9.6 ml of 20% Triton X-100 were added, and the cells were incubated for an additional 15 min. The aforementioned steps were conducted at 4 °C. The resulting cell extract was centrifuged for 45 min at 144,000 × g in a Ti60 rotor at 4 °C. The resulting pellets were rehomogenized in 50 ml of ice-cold 50 mm Tris and 5 mm EDTA (Buffer A) to which 500 μl of the phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride/N-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone solution had been added, and centrifugation was carried out as described above. All subsequent steps were conducted at room temperature. Centrifuge pellet fractions were further washed in 25 ml of Buffer A and 2% Triton X-100 and centrifuged at 20 °C under the same conditions described above. The resulting pellet fractions were rehomogenized in 20 ml of Buffer A, brought to 1% Mega-10 by the addition of a 10% stock solution, and nutated for 20 min before centrifugation for 30 min at 177,500 × g at 20 °C. The resulting supernatant fraction was saved, and BtuB was isolated as described below. The inclusion of 0.25% LIS during extraction effectively eliminated proteolytic degradation, if it was observed during the extraction of BtuB. The supernatant fraction from the Mega-10 extract was diluted into 50 ml of Buffer A, 1% Mega-10, and 0.07% LIS and loaded onto a 10-ml DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B column. The column was washed with 20 ml of Buffer A, 0.35% Mega-10, and 0.05% LIS and eluted with 100 ml of 0–700 mm LiCl gradient in Buffer A, 0.35% Mega-10, and 0.05% LIS. Due to the intense UV absorption of LIS, the broad BtuB peak eluted throughout the latter half of the gradient was detected by Coomassie Blue staining (∼15 min) of the fractions spotted onto Whatman #1 filter paper, followed by destaining with 20% methanol and 10% acetic acid. Pooled fractions were concentrated to approximately 2 ml with a Centriprep-50, diluted into 40 ml of Buffer A and 1% Mega-10, and loaded onto a 2-ml DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B column. Detergent exchange was achieved by washing the column with 10 ml of Buffer A and 1% OG, followed by elution with 70 ml of 0–450 mm LiCl gradient in Buffer A and 1% OG. Pooled receptor fractions were concentrated to approximately 2 ml in a Centriprep-50, and buffer exchange was carried out with a 10-ml Sephadex G-15 column equilibrated with 15 mmNaH2PO4 or 10 mm Tris and 1% OG, pH 7.5. Fractions were desalted and concentrated with a Centricon-100 and stored at −20 °C. BtuB purity was assessed by both SDS-PAGE and the presence of a unique NH2-terminal sequence (NH2-QDTSPD-) corresponding to that of the mature protein (19Hufton S.E. Ward R.J. Bunce N.A.C. Armstrong J.T. Fletcher A.J.P. Glass R.E. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 381-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined on a Varian Cary UV-visible spectrophotometer using an extinction coefficient at 280 nm of 140,000m−1 cm−1 (25Clifton J. Structural Studies on the Vitamin B12 Receptor from Escherichia coli.Ph.D. thesis. Yale University, 1991Google Scholar). BtuB fractions were routinely assessed for purity using a Tris-Tricine gel system (26Schägger H. Von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10481) Google Scholar) with stacking and resolving gels of 3 and 12.5%, respectively. Receptor conformation could be evaluated qualitatively by SDS-PAGE on a Phast Gel system (Pharmacia) using 12.5% acrylamide gels. Protein was detected by staining with either silver (27Blum H. Beier H. Gross H.J. Electrophoresis. 1987; 8: 93-99Crossref Scopus (3741) Google Scholar) or Coomassie Brilliant Blue (28Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Short Protocols in Molecular Biology. 2nd Ed. Greene Publishing/John Wiley & Sons, New York1992Google Scholar). Bacterial lipopolysaccharide was resolved on the Tris-Tricine system described above and detected by carbohydrate-sensitive silver staining (29Tsai C.-M. Frasch C.E. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 119: 115-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (2315) Google Scholar); development was terminated by a brief incubation in 20% Na2S2O3. The LPS profile from theE. coli K12 derivative used for overexpression was evaluated by SDS-PAGE after microextraction and proteinase K digestion (30Apicella M.A. Griffiss J.M. Schneider H. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 235: 242-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The LPS content of BtuB preparations was estimated by densitometry of silver-stained gels with standard curves generated from E. coli EH100 LPS, which contains lipid A and core sugars but lacks O-antigen, similar to the E. coli K12 derivative used for BtuB overexpression (Ref. 2Nikaido H. Vaara M. Niedhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium Cellular and Molecular Biology. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1987: 7-22Google Scholar; Fig. 2). Staining of LPS was conducted such that all species remained in the linear densitometric range. All measurements were acquired at room temperature using a JASCO-600 spectropolarimeter. Quartz cells with a path length of 0.2 mm were used for far UV measurements. Spectral parameters were as follows: (a) time constant, 2 s; (b) scan speed, 20 nm/min; (c) scanning increment, 0.1 nm; and (d) spectral bandwidth, 2 nm. Spectra were recorded in 15 mm NaH2PO4 and 1% OG titrated to pH 7.5 with NaOH at protein concentrations of approximately 0.5 mg/ml, and the buffer background was subtracted. Far UV CD spectra of BtuB were analyzed for secondary structure information by the methods of Provencher and Glockner (31Provencher S.W. Glockner J. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (1886) Google Scholar) and Chang et al. (32Chang C.T. Wu C.-S.C. Yang J.T. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 91: 13-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar). The mean values of secondary structure content obtained from the two methods are reported. Sedimentation equilibrium and sedimentation velocity measurements were performed in the Beckman OPTIMA XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge (AN60Ti rotor). BtuB dissolved in 15 mm NaH2PO4 and 1% OG, pH 7.5, was analyzed at concentrations of 0.5 mg/ml for velocity experiments and 0.35, 0.75, and 1.5 mg/ml for equilibrium experiments. Equilibrium and velocity runs were conducted in a 12-mm double sector cell at 20 °C, and absorbance was monitored at 275 nm. Velocity studies were performed at 50,000 rpm with sedimentation boundaries scanned at 10-min intervals. Sedimentation equilibrium studies were performed for 30 h at 10,000 rpm. The best fit to the sedimentation equilibrium data was analyzed with the program SEDEQ1B (A. P. Minton; [email protected]), and the velocity data were analyzed by both the Svedberg (33Philo J.S. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 435-444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) and the DCDT method (34Stafford W.F. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203: 295-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). The partial specific volume of BtuB (0.726 cm3/g) was calculated from the amino acid composition. A partial specific volume of 0.859 cm3/g was used for octylglucoside (35Maneti S. Dunia I. le Maire M. Benedetti E.L. FEBS Lett. 1988; 233: 148-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Molecular masses were generated for both the protein-detergent complex and the protein component alone, estimating the detergent bound to the protein at 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 g/g (35Maneti S. Dunia I. le Maire M. Benedetti E.L. FEBS Lett. 1988; 233: 148-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Sedimentation velocity experiments were conducted as described above after the preincubation of BtuB (0.5 mg/ml) with equimolar levels of colicin E3 to directly demonstrate the formation of the BtuB-colicin E3 complex. The binding of vitamin B12 was measured in a similar fashion by simultaneously monitoring the sedimentation of protein (275 nm) and cyanocobalamin (358 nm) after the preincubation of the vitamin (15 or 30 μm) with BtuB (15 μm) solubilized in 10 mm Tris, 5 mm CaCl2, and 1% OG, pH 7.5. Receptor activity was also evaluated as the ability of purified BtuB to protect susceptible cells from the killing action of colicin E1 or E3. The sensitive E. colistrain K17DE3 (pT7–7) was grown to mid-log phase, and 150-μl aliquots were spread on 2YT Petri dish plates containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. The plates were dried for 30 min at room temperature before the sample addition. The samples assayed for cytotoxicity were diluted to a final volume of 20 μl and preincubated for 20 min at room temperature, and 7.5 μl were subsequently applied to the plates described above. The plates were incubated overnight at 37 °C after the applied samples had dried, and colicin activity was evaluated as the ability to maintain a clear zone within a lawn of growing cells. All dilutions and reagents were prepared in 20 mm Tris and 1% OG, pH 7.5. Vitamin B12 was added to BtuB 10 min before the addition of colicin in studies that assessed its effects on receptor function. Control experiments indicated that colicin was the agent responsible for cell killing under all conditions examined. The use of E. coliTNE012 as an expression strain for BtuB purification has been described previously (17Imajoh S. Ohno-Iwashita Y. Imahori K. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 6481-6487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, an alternate procedure was necessary for the isolation of protein in quantities sufficient for characterization and crystallization trials. Overexpression from plasmid pJC3 coupled with the extraction of outer membranes with the nonionic detergent Mega-10 dramatically increased the amount of starting material for purification (25Clifton J. Structural Studies on the Vitamin B12 Receptor from Escherichia coli.Ph.D. thesis. Yale University, 1991Google Scholar). Although prolonged cell growth may further enhance the expression levels, proteolytic degradation had been noted under such conditions, resulting in the detection of 20- and 40-kDa BtuB degradation products by SDS-PAGE. Co-purification of the degradation products likely resulted from a stable association between the fragments throughout the purification (data not shown). The purity of BtuB after various stages of extraction and purification is shown in Fig. 1. Initial DEAE chromatography was facilitated by the presence of 0.05% LIS during column loading and elution, due to its ability to both inhibit observable proteolytic degradation and increase receptor purity by shifting the elution of BtuB to a later portion of the gradient. A second DEAE step was carried out for LIS removal, detergent exchange, and final purification. Pooled fractions from this second DEAE column contain a receptor species that is pure with respect to the protein (Fig. 1, lane 4) yet contains bound lipopolysaccharide (Fig. 2). Densitometry after SDS-PAGE and carbohydrate-sensitive silver staining using E. coli EH100 LPS for the generation of standard curves indicated that preparations contain approximately 2 ± 1 mol bound LPS/mol BtuB (data not shown). Far UV CD spectra (190–250 nm) of BtuB solubilized in the nonionic detergent β-d-octylglucoside (Fig. 3 A,---) are characteristic of proteins integral to the bacterial outer membrane (5Jap B.K. Walian P.J. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1990; 23: 367-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 12Moeck G.S. Tawa P. Xiang H. Ismail A.A. Turnbull J.L. Coulton J.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 459-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), with a single minimum at 216 nm (arrow, a), a cross-over point at approximately 205 nm, and a relatively large peak of positive ellipticity centered around 195 nm. The averaging of the secondary structure values obtained from spectral analysis by the methods of Provencher and Glockner (31Provencher S.W. Glockner J. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (1886) Google Scholar) and Changet al. (32Chang C.T. Wu C.-S.C. Yang J.T. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 91: 13-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar) indicates a predominantly β-sheet secondary structure (76 ± 4%; n = 3) and a small α-helical content (15 ± 3%; n = 3). The characterization of the TonB-dependent receptors FhuA, FepA, Cir (11Murphy C.K. Kalve V.I. Klebba P.E. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 2736-2746Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Locher K.P. Rosenbusch J.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 770-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and a variety of porins by SDS-PAGE (5Jap B.K. Walian P.J. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1990; 23: 367-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) revealed heat-modifiable migration patterns that resulted in an underestimation of M r for protein exposed to electrophoresis sample buffer in the absence of heating. Such behavior has been proposed to stem from a compact, SDS-resistant, β-barrel secondary structure that migrates through the gel more readily than protein denatured by a combination of SDS and heat. Similar migration patterns are observed when BtuB is analyzed by SDS-PAGE, with the heat-treated receptor indicating a M r value close to the true molecular weight (Fig. 3 B, lane 2); unheated samples underestimate the true M r value by approximately 20,000 (Fig. 3 B, lane 3). The far UV CD spectrum of unheated receptor in the presence of OG/SDS mixed micelles (Fig. 3 A,······) demonstrates that secondary structure is retained in the presence of SDS, directly supporting the above interpretation of the migration patterns observed after SDS-PAGE. The incubation of BtuB at 90 °C in the presence of OG/SDS mixed micelles (Fig. 3 A,--···--) alters the secondary structure. The resulting spectrum has minima at approximately 208 and 222 nm (arrows, b and c), which is characteristic of some α-helical content, but lacks the positive peak of large amplitude centered at 190–195 nm (37Venyaminov S.Y. Yang J.T. Fasman G.D. Circular Dichroism and the Conformational Analysis of Biomolecules. Plenum, New York1996: 69-107Crossref Google Scholar). Octylglucoside-solubilized BtuB was characterized by sedimentation equilibrium and sedimentation velocity to ascertain the oligomeric state and ensure the monodispersity of the protein-detergent complex. The analysis of equilibrium data yields plots of ln A versus r 2that are linear from the meniscus to the cell bottom (Fig. 4 A), indicating a homogenous preparation characterized by an aggregation state that is independent of sample concentration (0.35–1.5 mg/ml). Sample homogeneity is further demonstrated by the normal distribution of the sedimentation values obtained from the velocity studies (Ref. 34Stafford W.F. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203: 295-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar; Fig. 4 B). The minor inhomogeneity observed at low S values is likely a result of light scattering from the slowly sedimenting octylglucoside micelles (Fig. 4 B). From the slope of the ln A versus r 2 plot (Fig. 4 A) and the sedimentation velocity data (Fig. 4 B) analyzed according to Ref. 33Philo J.S. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 435-444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, a sedimentation coefficient of 4.7 S and a molecular weight of 89,000 were calculated for the protein-detergent complex. The molecular weight of 89,000 includes an appreciable contribution from bound detergent. Calculations based on the assumption of a protein-detergent complex with detergent bound at levels of 1 g/g protein (13Boulanger P. le Maire M. Bonhivers M. Dubois S. Desmadril M. Letellier L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14216-14224Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 35Maneti S. Dunia I. le Maire M. Benedetti E.L. FEBS Lett. 1988; 233: 148-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) imply a contribution of approximately M r 60,000 for the protein component alone, indicating that BtuB was purified as a monomer. Similar calculations with estimates of detergent bound at a ratio of 0.5 g/g (approximately the molecular weight of a detergent micelle) or 1.5 g/g protein result in only a 20% difference in the calculated molecular weight, which is consistent with the conclusion that purified BtuB is monomeric. The initial binding to the receptor in the outer membrane is an obligate step in colicin action. The formation of a high-affinity complex between colicin and purified receptor will decrease the concentration of free colicin, resulting in the protection of otherwise susceptible strains. The ligand binding characteristics of isolated BtuB were qualitatively evaluated by testing its ability to eliminate the cytotoxic effects of colicins E1 and E3. The preincubation of colicin E3 (16 nm) with increasing concentrations of BtuB eliminated observable cell killing once the receptor was provided in modest stoichiometric excess (22.5 nm; data not shown). In the absence of BtuB, cytotoxicity was apparent at a colicin E3 concentration of 0.16 nm, indicating that detergent-solubilized receptor retains high affinity for this particular ligand (K d < 1 nm). In contrast, the preincubation of colicin E1 (17.5 nm) with a 15-fold molar excess of BtuB conferred no observable protection. Vitamin B12 did not prevent the neutralization of colicin E3 by BtuB, even when it was present at approximately a 200-fold molar excess over the colicin. The ability of detergent-solubilized BtuB to bind both vitamin B12 and colicin E3 was directly demonstrated by sedimentation velocity analysis. Preincubation with stoichiometric levels of BtuB (15 μm) shifted the sedimentation profile of vitamin B12 (Fig. 5 B) to that observed for the isolated prote"

Co-precipitation with endogenous myosin heavy chain verified that 40–60% of endogenous LC17a could be exchanged for recombinant LC17aor LC17b. Upon addition of MgATP in Ca2+-free solution, recombinant LC17 exchange induced slow contractions unaccompanied by regulatory light chain (RLC) phosphorylation only in TFP-treated, but not in untreated, permeabilized smooth muscle; the shortening velocity and rate of force development were approximately 1.5 and 2 times faster, respectively, in response to LC17a than LC17b. Additional incubation with recombinant, thiophosphorylated RLC increased the shortening velocity, independent of the LC17 isoform exchanged. The LC17-induced contractions of TFP-treated muscles were abolished by prior addition of nonphosphorylated RLC. We suggest that LC17 stiffens the lever arm of myosin and, in the absence of regulation by RLC, permits cross-bridge cycling without requiring RLC phosphorylation. Our results are compatible with nonphosphorylated RLC acting as a repressor and with LC17isoforms modulating the MgADP affinity and, consequently, rate of cooperative cycling of nonphosphorylated cross-bridges.

The markedly different rates of contraction and relaxation in fast, phasic and slow, tonic smooth muscles reflect differences not only at the level of the membrane potential, signal transduction, rates of myosin light chain phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, but also in the kinetic properties of the actomyosin motor. The muscle-specific differences in actomyosin kinetics have been ascribed to the existence of specific myosin isoforms, but their relative contributions to the mechanical properties of smooth muscles have not been unequivocally demonstrated (reviewed in Ref. 1Somlyo A.P. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1993; 14: 557-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The expression of the two myosin heavy chain (MHC)1 isoforms, SM-1 and SM-2 (2Eddinger T.J. Murphy R.A. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 3807-3811Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) that differ by, respectively, the presence or absence of a 34-amino acid extension of the carboxyl terminus (3Nagai R. Kuro-o M. Babij P. Periasamy M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9734-9737Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), does not correlate with phasic or tonic kinetics of contraction. On the other hand, motility assays show different rates of movement propelled by MHC isoforms that are the products of an alternative splicing mechanism resulting in the presence or absence of a 7-amino acid insert near the nucleotide-binding region of the myosin head (4Kelley C.A. Takahashi M., Yu, J.H. Adelstein R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12848-12854Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5White S. Martin A.E. Periasamy M. Am. J.

Disparate results have been obtained concerning the effects on contractile kinetics of the two LC17 isoforms, acidic (LC17a) and basic (LC17b), that differ in 5 of the 9 COOH-terminal amino acid residues and are products of a single gene generated by an alternative splicing mechanism (6Nabeshima Y.

Pflugers Arch. 1991; 418: 523-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), albeit the proportion of myosin heavy chain containing the insert was also variant in these muscles, whereas in vitro studies have produced conflicting results. Increasing the LC17a content of isolated aortic myosin has been reported to increase ATPase activity (12Hasegawa Y. Morita F. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1992; 111: 804-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), but motility assays failed to detect a difference in the velocity of actin movement as a function of LC17 isoform, although they showed faster movement propelled by myosin containing the 7-amino acid insert in the motor domain (4Kelley C.A. Takahashi M., Yu, J.H. Adelstein R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12848-12854Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Rovner A.S. Freyzon Y. Trybus K.M. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1997; 18: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that the LC17 isoform, the motor domain insert, or a combination of both (1Somlyo A.P. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1993; 14: 557-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) are responsible for the different kinetic properties of phasic and tonic smooth muscle actomyosin in situ. The aim of the present study was to determine whether a change in the ratio of LC17 isoforms alone can alter the contractile kinetics of smooth muscle. To that end, we exchanged the basic isoform, LC17b, into bladder and amnion smooth muscles, both of which have fast, phasic properties and express only the LC17a isoform (Ref. 10Fuglsang A. Khromov A. Torok K. Somlyo A.V. Somlyo A.P. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1993; 14: 666-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar and the present study). We used TFP, a hydrophobic cation that facilitates extraction and/or exchange of light chains from isolated myosin (12Hasegawa Y. Morita F. J. Biochem.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7655-7660Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), to promote light chain exchange in permeabilized smooth muscle. Our results show a significant LC17isoform-specific effect on the unloaded shortening velocity of nonphosphorylated, slowly cycling cross-bridges, but no detectable effect on muscles in which the RLCs are thiophosphorylated. Bundles of bladder detrusor muscle (3 mm × 200–400 μm) from male, New Zealand rabbits weighing 2–3 kg or chicken amnion sheets (3 × 3 mm) from 10–13 day eggs were dissected and the ends tied with monofilament silk, and attached to a fixed hook and a force transducer (AE 801; AME, Horten, Norway) for recording isometric tension at room temperature. The chicken amnion also expresses 100% LC17a and was used in preliminary studies to optimize conditions for LC17 exchange in smooth muscle, because of its thinness and lack of connective tissue and basement membrane on the surface smooth muscle cells (17Romanoff A.L. The Avian Embryo: Structural and Functional Development. Macmillan Co., New York1960: 1081-1111Google Scholar). 2A. V. Somlyo, unpublished observation. However, the smooth muscle fibers in bladder bundles were better (more parallel) oriented and, unless otherwise stated, all mechanical experiments reported were performed using rabbit bladder detrusor muscle strips. Strips were stretched by 10% of their resting length and, after determining a response to high K+, permeabilized in a pCa 6.5 solution containing Triton X-100 (0.05%, v/v) and A23187 (10 μm), to deplete internal Ca2+ stores, for 15–20 min before washing in relaxing solution and incubation in a rigor solution designed to facilitate light chain exchange and based on that used previously (16Malmqvist U. Trybus K.M. Yagi S. Carmichael J. Fay F.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7655-7660Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), it contained (mM): 1 TFP, 10 CDTA, 150 potassium methanesulfonate, and 20 PIPES (pH 6.5) for 15 min at 30 °C (see Fig. 7 A for illustration of this protocol). The remainder of the experiment was conducted at room temperature (22–23 °C). After washing, strips were incubated in solutions containing recombinant LC17 (0.75 mg·ml−1) for up to 60 min. The compositions of the solutions were (mM): relaxing solution (47 potassium methanesulfonate, 4.72 magnesium methanesulfonate, 5 K2EGTA, 2.23 MgATP, 20 imidazole (pH 7.1), 5 creatine phosphate (CP), and 100 units ml−1 creatine kinase (CK)) and zero Ca2+-rigor solution (73.2 potassium methanesulfonate, 2.35 MgMs2, 5 K2EGTA, and 20 imidazole (pH 7.1)). The ionic strength of these solutions was 0.12. In addition, all incubation solutions contained 10 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 1 mmAEBSF (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA), and 0.1 mm leupeptin. All chemicals were obtained from Sigma unless otherwise stated. Recombinant light chains, from a gizzard library, were expressed in Escherichia coli as described previously (18Trybus K.M. Chatman T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4412-4419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In some experiments, thiophosphorylated recombinant RLC was added to muscle strips. These were prepared by incubating recombinant RLC (1.0 mg·ml−1) with 20 μg·ml−1 myosin light chain kinase (MLCK; generous gift of Dr. D. J. Hartshorne), 5 μm calmodulin (Calbiochem), 2 mm ATPγS (Boehringer Mannheim, Indianapolis, IN), 2.4 mmMgCl2, and 0.6 mm CaCl2 overnight at 4 °C, followed by extensive dialysis against zero Ca2+-rigor solution. Greater than 90% thiophosphorylation of recombinant RLC was confirmed by SDS-PAGE using urea/glycerol gels (19Sobieszek A. Jertschin P. Electrophoresis. 1986; 7: 417-425Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Muscle strips were treated according to the TFP protocol and incubated in zero Ca2+-rigor solution containing either LC17a or LC17b for 60 min. This was replaced by photolysis solution containing 5 mm caged ATP (1-(2-nitrophenyl)-ethyl-ATP; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), and 40 mm DTT, in zero Ca2+-rigor solution (pH 7.1, ionic strength 0.16) for 3 min. Caged ATP was photolyzed using a frequency-doubled ruby laser (Lumonics, Warwick, United Kingdom), delivering a 50-ns pulse of near-UV light at 347 nm, sufficient to release 1.2 ± 0.1 mm ATP (n = 5), as determined by high performance liquid chromatography of the trough solution at the completion of force measurements. Contaminant ATP and ADP were removed from the caged ATP stocks using 100 μg·ml−1 apyrase (grade V; Ref. 10Fuglsang A. Khromov A. Torok K. Somlyo A.V. Somlyo A.P. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1993; 14: 666-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The set-up used for laser flash photolysis has been previously described (20Somlyo A.V. Goldman Y.E. Fujimori T. Bond M. Trentham D.R. Somlyo A.P. J. Gen. Physiol. 1988; 91: 165-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 21Nishiye E. Somlyo A.V. Torok K. Somlyo A.P. J. Physiol. 1993; 460: 247-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Unloaded shortening velocity (V us) was determined using the slack-test method (22Edman K.A.P. J. Physiol. 1979; 291: 143-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). Briefly, strips were attached to hooks via aluminum T-clips or, in some earlier experiments, with small loops. After reaching steady state isometric tension, length changes of varying amplitude, sufficient to just reduce tension to zero, were applied to one end of the muscle strip using an isotonic lever (Model 308, Cambridge Technology Inc., Watertown, MA, maximum step time 300 μs). The time taken for the strip to shorten against zero load and take up the slack was recorded and plotted against the length change. The slope of this relationship was taken as unloaded shortening velocity. Linear regression analysis was used to obtain the best fit straight line. In order to compare the effects of LC17 isoforms on V us, strips were treated according to the TFP protocol and incubated with the appropriate LC17 isoform in zero Ca2+-rigor for 60 min before force activation in relaxing solution and determination of V us as detailed above. In some experiments,V us was also measured in LC17-exchanged muscles after an additional 45-min incubation in zero Ca2+-rigor containing recombinant thiophosphorylated RLC (0.7 mg·ml−1). Muscle strips were rapidly frozen and stored in liquid nitrogen for subsequent analysis of protein composition. To discriminate between true exchange and nonspecific binding to the tissue, the extent of myosin light chain isoform exchange was determined by either immunoprecipitation of myosin using anti-myosin heavy chain antibody (generous gift from Drs. C. Kelley and R. Adelstein) or by sedimentation of myosin in low salt buffer at high speed centrifugation, followed by SDS-PAGE and transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes for subsequent Western blotting using anti-LC17 antibody (clone 7B5.1) and anti-RLC antibody (generous gift from Dr. K. Kamm). The immunoprecipitated pellets were washed from three to six times and the supernatant of the final wash treated with trichloroacetic acid to precipitate remaining protein. The entire precipitate was loaded on the gel. No LCs were found in the final wash supernatants. Calponin was detected using an anti-calponin antibody generously provided by Dr. M. Walsh. Using one-dimensional gel electrophoresis (15% polyacrylamide; 16 × 14 cm), the LC17a and LC17b isoforms could be readily distinguished according to their mobility. In experiments involving incubations with recombinant, thiophosphorylated RLC, its level of exchange with endogenous, nonphosphorylated RLC could not be accurately determined, since both species migrate to the same position on an isoelectric focusing gel, as a consequence of an NH2-terminal 4-amino acid tag on the recombinant RLC (18Trybus K.M. Chatman T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4412-4419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Treated strips were homogenized in ice-cold lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm AEBSF, 0.1 mmleupeptin, and 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.1)). Cellular debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 800 × g (4 °C) and 10 mm MgATP was added to the collected supernatant for 15 min before incubation with bovine polyclonal anti-myosin heavy chain antibody, which recognizes both SM-1 and SM-2 heavy chain isoforms, for 60 min at room temperature. The homogenate was incubated for a further 1 h at room temperature with protein A-10% agarose (v/v) (Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA) and immune complexes were collected by centrifugation at 300 × g (4 °C) for 5 min and washed 4 times with lysis buffer. The final supernatant was run as a control after precipitation with 20% trichloroacetic acid in acetone and several washes with acetone. Both immune complex and final supernatant pellets were resuspended in 2 × Laemmli sample buffer. Treated strips were homogenized in ice-cold lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm AEBSF, 0.1 mm leupeptin, and 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.1)). Cellular debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 300 × g (4 °C) and 10 mm MgATP added to the supernatant for 15 min before centrifugation at 80,000 × g (4 °C) for 20 min. The collected supernatant was diluted with 9 volumes of ice-cold buffer containing 1 mm MgCl2 and 10 mmMOPS and allowed to stand for 30 min to precipitate myosin before centrifugation at 105,000 × g (4 °C) for 30 min. After removal of the supernatant, the pellet was resuspended in low salt buffer and the last centrifugation step repeated before resuspension of the pellet in 2 × Laemmli sample buffer. Phosphorylation levels of endogenous RLC in Table I were determined by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, transfer to nitrocellulose membranes, and staining with colloidal gold as described previously (23Kitazawa T. Gaylinn B.D. Denney G.H. Somlyo A.P. J. Biol.

A comparable magnitude of contraction of untreated strips activated by pCa 6.5 showed a significantly increased level of RLC phosphorylation (*,p < 0.05). Turkey gizzard myosin was prepared as described previously (24Trybus K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20819-20822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the effects of TFP on isolated myosin using the same (1 mm) concentration of TFP as used in experiments on skinned fibers, myosin (12 μg) was incubated in 500 mm KCl, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm ATP, 1 mm DTT, and 20 mm PIPES (pH 6.5) for 15 min at 30 °C, in the presence or absence of 1 mm TFP. The solution was diluted with 9 volumes of ice-cold buffer containing 1 mmMgCl2 and 10 mm MOPS, and allowed to stand for 30 min to precipitate myosin before centrifugation at 105,000 ×g (4 °C) for 30 min and the pellet resuspended in 2 × Laemmli buffer. For comparison, myosin precipitates were also prepared following treatment with 5 mm TFP, a concentration known to extract RLC (14Trybus K.M. Waller G.S. Chatman T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 963-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Because TFP could inhibit RLC phosphorylation in skinned fibers (see “Results”) through its known effects on calmodulin, we used a Ca2+/calmodulin-independent MLCK (generous gift from Dr. M. Ikebe) to determine the direct (CaM-independent) effect of TFP on RLC phosphorylation. Precipitates of TFP-treated and nontreated myosin were prepared as described, but resuspended in buffer containing 20 μg ml−1 Ca2+/calmodulin-independent MLCK, 2 mm ATPγS, 50 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 5 mm DTT, and 30 mm Tris HCl (pH 7.5), and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Myosin was then precipitated by high-speed centrifugation and the pellet resuspended in 8 m urea buffer. The extent of RLC thiophosphorylation was determined using one-dimensional isoelectric focusing mini-gels (7.5% polyacrylamide, 2% pH ampholytes 4.0–5.4 (Pharmalyte, Pharmacia, Piscataway, NJ)). CD spectra of LC17 were obtained to determine whether TFP had a direct effect on LC17 structure. LC17a(17 μM), in the presence or absence of TFP (100 μM), was incubated in 50 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.0) at 30 °C for 15 min and kept at 20 °C for approximately 30 min. CD spectra were then recorded in a 0.5-mm fused silica cuvette at 20 °C using a J-600 spectropolarimeter (JASCO, Tokyo, Japan). Five scans were accumulated per sample and spectra are presented as difference spectrum,i.e. spectrum recorded in the presence or absence of TFP minus spectrum of TFP or Tris buffer alone. Measurements were repeated three times with different solutions and the results were reproducible. The α-helical content was estimated from the mean residue molar ellipticity at 220 nm using the DICROPROT v. 2.4 analysis program (available at http://www.ibcp.fr/DIRCROPROT.html). In order to determine the intracellular distribution of LC17 added to skinned muscle fibers, LC17b was fluorescently labeled at an approximate molar stoichiometry with tetramethylrhodamine 5-iodoacetamide (Molecular Probes). Labeling was performed for 2 h at room temperature followed by extensive dialysis to remove free tetramethylrhodamine 5-iodoacetamide. Labeling of LC17b was confirmed by SDS-PAGE. Muscles were carried through the same standard protocol for LC17exchange using the fluorescently labeled LC17b, and examined using a confocal microscope (Bio-Rad MRC 1000). Approximately 1-μm thick optical sections were sampled throughout the thickness of the muscle strips. Strips of bladder muscle were carried through the standard permeabilization protocol, followed by treatment with TFP. Untreated permeabilized control strips were carried through the same solutions, minus TFP. Following TFP treatment the muscles were incubated in relaxing solution or zero calcium rigor solution for 15 min and subsequently fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde in 0.075 msodium cacodylate buffers with 4% sucrose plus 0.2% tannic acid for 2 h, followed by fixation in 2% osmium tetroxide and en bloc staining with saturated uranyl acetate, dehydration in alcohol, and embedment in Spurr's resin. Thin longitudinal or transverse sections were stained with lead citrate and examined in a Philips CM 12 electron microscope at 80 KeV. Cells were examined across the entire strip in transverse sections and evaluated for filament content and differences in morphology between the control and TFP-treated specimens. Data are presented as the mean ± S.E., and nrefers to the number of muscle strips. Statistical significance was determined (p < 0.05) with unpaired Student'st test. Unless otherwise stated, all gels presented are representative of at least three similar experiments. The data from the flash photolysis and slack test experiments were collected using LabView 3.1.1 data acquisition software (National Instruments, Austin, TX) and curve fitting of force transients was performed using Sigma Plot 2.0 software (Jandel Scientific, San Rafael, CA). The effects of TFP treatment were explored on isolated myosin for comparison with thein situ effects. Unlike experiments on isolated myosin (14Trybus K.M. Waller G.S. Chatman T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 963-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) or single cells (16Malmqvist U. Trybus K.M. Yagi S. Carmichael J. Fay F.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7655-7660Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), treatment of Triton-permeabilized rabbit bladder strips with TFP caused no detectable loss of the RLC, LC17, or calponin, as determined in whole homogenates (Fig. 1 A) or MHC immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1 B). To verify whether this apparent discrepancy was the result of method-based differences, we examined the effects of two different treatment protocols on LC removal from isolated gizzard myosin. A concentration of TFP (1 mm TFP, 15 min at 30 °C) which did not extract light chains from the muscle strips also did not extract light chains from isolated myosin in solution (Fig. 2). Loss of both RLC and LC17, however, was observed with the method (5 mm TFP, 1 h at 4 °C) used by Trybus et al. (14Trybus K.M. Waller G.S. Chatman T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 963-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) to extract the RLC (Fig. 2).Figure 2Effect of TFP treatment on light chains of gizzard smooth muscle myosin in vitro.Coomassie Blue stain showing light chain content after TFP treatment and precipitation of myosin in low salt followed by high-speed centrifugation using 4–20% gradient SDS-PAGE.

Note that at 1 mmTFP for 15 min at 30 °C, the same conditions used for the permeabilized muscle strips, light chains are not removed, similar to the findings in situ. However, treatment with 5 mm TFP did result in light chain extraction. All samples are shown in duplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To assess the plausibility of TFP having a direct effect on the properties of LC17, we compared CD spectra of TFP-treated with untreated LC17. The difference spectra of LC17a (17 μM) in the presence or absence of TFP (100 μM) are shown in Fig. 3. TFP increased the estimated α-helical content of LC17a from 31 to 47%. Following TFP treatment of rabbit bladder strips, the RLC, although still associated with the MHC, could no longer be thiophosphorylated (Fig. 4A). This could reflect a direct effect of TFP on the RLC or an effect on calmodulin leading to an inhibition of MLCK. To test this second possibility, we determined the effect of TFP treatment on thiophosphorylation of RLC by a Ca2+/CaM-independent MLCK in vitro. The TFP concentration (1 mm) that did not extract RLC or LC17 from myosin in situ (see below) or in vitro, as described above, inhibited thiophosphorylation of RLC of isolated myosin by a Ca2+/CaM-independent MLCK (Fig. 4 B), suggesting that TFP made threonine and serine unavailable for thiophosphorylation rather than through inhibition of CaM-MLCK. A similar result was obtained using full-length MLCK in the presence of Ca2+/CaM (data not shown). Paired controls of non-TFP-treated myosin showed the expected phosphorylation of RLC by MLCK and Ca2+/CaM-independent MLCK (Fig. 4 B). Experiments were carried out to exchange the endogenous LC17a isoforms in bladder and chicken amnion cells with the recombinant LC17b and to characterize the efficiency and extent of exchange. Although no selective extraction of either LC17 or RLC was observed after 1 mm TFP treatment, subsequent incubation with recombinant LC17 led to significant exchange of recombinant for endogenous LC17as determined by immunoprecipitation (Fig. 5 A) or sedimentation of myosin (Fig. 5 B). The amount of recombinant LC17bassociated with myosin heavy chain, expressed as percent of total LC17, was 50 ± 1% (n = 6) in the rabbit bladder and 44 ± 5% (n = 6) in the chicken amnion. No LC17b was detectable in myosin precipitates (Fig. 5 B) or in the final wash of immunoprecipitates if the TFP solution was omitted from the exchange protocol. Further evidence of TFP facilitating LC17exchange was obtained using confocal microscopy. Incubation with fluorescently labeled LC17b according to the exchange protocol followed by extensive washing revealed a diffuse cytoplasmic signal, excluding nuclei and the extracellular matrix (Fig. 6 A), whereas in paired experiments without TFP pretreatment the fluorescent signal obtained with identical detection parameters was markedly less intense (Fig. 6 B). These findings indicate that added LC17 can freely diffuse into and out of the filament lattice, but binds to the myosin heavy chain only after TFP treatment. Similar results were found for the RLC, where ∼50% of total RLC was exchanged by recombinant RLC (data not shown). This was easily discernible, as the recombinant and endogenous nonphosphorylated RLCs ran separately on one-dimensional isoelectric focusing gels.Figure 6Confocal micrograph showing longitudinally oriented muscle cells in rabbit bladder strips after Triton permeabilization and incubation with tetramethylrhodamine B isothiocyanate (TRITC)-labeled LC17b, with (Panel A) or without (Panel B) TFP pretreatment.Imaging at different planes in the muscle strips showed fluorescence throughout the cytoplasm in all cells, excluding nuclei (N) only with TFP pretreatment.

Two domains of p70 mediate DNA binding, one on the C-terminal and one on the N-terminal portion. The latter must dimerize with p80 in order to bind DNA, whereas the former is p80-independent. Both must be intact for end binding activity in gel shift assays. To evaluate the role of p80 in DNA binding, deletion mutants were co-expressed with full-length p70 using recombinant baculoviruses. We show by several criteria that amino acids 371–510 of p80 interact with p70. Both of the p70 dimerization domains bind to the same region of p80, but apparently to separate sites within that region. In DNA immunoprecipitation assays, amino acids 179–510 of p80 were required for p80-dependent DNA binding of p70, whereas in gel shift assays, amino acids 179–732 were necessary. Interestingly, both the p80-dependent and the p80-independent DNA binding sites preferentially bound to DNA ends, suggesting a model in which a single Ku heterodimer may juxtapose two broken DNA ends physically, facilitating their rejoining by DNA ligases.

Defining the mechanism of p70-p80 dimerization may help to explain the role of p80 in sequence-specific DNA binding, DNA end binding, and/or DSBR. The p70 subunit contains two p80 interaction domains, amino acids 1–115 and 430–482, respectively, as well as two regions involved in DNA binding, each partially overlapping one of the interaction domains (16Wang J. Dong X. Myung K. Hendrickson E.A. Reeves W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 842-848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). A p80-independent DNA binding site is located on the C terminus (amino acids 536–609) (16Wang J. Dong X. Myung K. Hendrickson E.A. Reeves W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 842-848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 17Wang J. Satoh M. Chou C.H. Reeves W.H. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), whereas the N-terminal region must bind p80 in order to bind DNA. The goal of this study was to define the dimerization-dependent DNA binding site. Using p70 and p80 mutants, a large central domain of p80 involved in both dimerization and DNA binding was identified. This site, like the p80-independent DNA binding site, preferentially recognized DNA ends, suggesting that a single Ku heterodimer may bind two DNA ends. K562 (human erythroleukemia) cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville, MD) and maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin. The Sf9 (Spodoptera frugiperda ovary) cell line was obtained from the ATCC, and maintained at 27 °C in Grace's insect tissue culture medium supplemented with 3.3 g/liter TC yeastolate, 3.3 g/liter lactalbumin hydrolyzate, 10% fetal bovine serum, and penicillin/streptomycin. The human p70 and p80 Ku cDNAs were subcloned into a modified baculovirus transfer vector pVLB4-mp53 and co-transfected with linearized wild-type baculovirus into Sf9 cells as described (16Wang J. Dong X. Myung K. Hendrickson E.A. Reeves W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 842-848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The recombinant baculovirus vectors direct the expression of Ku proteins fused to an N-terminal polyhistidine sequence and a enterokinase cleavage site. The recombinant baculoviruses expressing the full-length p80 or p70 are designated p80-bv and p70-bv respectively. Recombinant baculoviruses expressing mutant human p80 were constructed in the same manner. Truncated p80 cDNAs were amplified by polymerase chain reaction using primer pairs listed in Table I, and subcloned into pVLB4-mp53.Table IPrimers used to amplify Ku cDNAs for subcloning into baculovirus transfer vectorsConstructs5′ Primer3′ Primerp80.1–1785′-GCGGATCCATGGTGCGGTCGGGGAATAAG-3′5′-GCGAATTCTCATCTGTCCCCACTTCCATC-3′p80.371–7325′-GCGGATCCGAGGCAGCTGCAGTTGCAC-3′5′-GCGAATTCCGACCTATATCATGTCC-3′p80.179–7325′-GCGGATCCGGAGATGGCCCCTTTCGC-3′5′-GCGAATTCCGACCTATATCATGTCC-3′p80.179–6545′-GCGGATCCGGAGATGGCCCCTTTCGC-3′5′-GCGAATTCTCAGCGCTGCTCTTCTGAAAAC-3′p80.179–5105′-GCGGATCCGGAGATGGCCCCTTTCGC-3′5′-GCGAATTCTCACTGCTGAATTGGGGGTAG-3′p80.179–4005′-GCGGATCCGGAGATGGCCCCTTTCGC-3′5′-GCGAATTCTCATCTTTTGTCATAAGC-3′p80.371–6545′-GCGGATCCGAGGCAGCTGCAGTTGCAC-3′5′-GCGAATTCTCAGCGCTGCTCTTCTGAAAAC-3′p80.371–5105′-GCGGATCCGAGGCAGCTGCAGTTGCAC-3′5′-GCGAATTCTCACTGCTGAATTGGGGGTAG-3′p80.400–7325′-GCGGATCCAGAGCTAATCCTCAAGTC-3′5′-GCGAATTCCGACCTATATCATGTCC-3′p80.400–6545′-GCGGATCCAGAGCTAATCCTCAAGTC-3′5′-GCGAATTCTCAGCGCTGCTCTTCTGAAAAC-3′p80.400–5105′-GCGGATCCAGAGCTAATCCTCAAGTC-3′5′-GCGAATTCTCACTGCTGAATTGGGGGTAG-3′p80.510–6545′-GCGGATCCCAGCATATTTGGAATATGC-3′5′-GCGAATTCTCAGCGCTGCTCTTCTGAAAAC-3′p80.654–7325′-GCGGATCCCGCTTTAACAACTTCCTG-3′5′-GCGAATTCCGACCTATATCATGTCC-3′ Open table in a new tab Sf9 cells were infected with one or more recombinant baculoviruses as described (16Wang J.

Seventy-two hours after infection, recombinant Ku proteins were identified in cell lysates by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using human autoimmune serum and/or specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). mAbs specific for the human Ku antigen were as described previously (16Wang J. Dong X. Myung K. Hendrickson E.A. Reeves W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 842-848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Their isotypes and specificities are as follows: 162, IgG2a anti-p70/p80 dimer; S10B1, IgG1 anti- p80 (amino acids 179–371); 111, IgG1 anti-p80 (amino acids 610–705); N3H10, IgG2b anti-p70 (amino acids 529–541). An IgG2a murine mAb specific for the polyhistidine tag (HIS-1) was from Sigma. Immunoblot analysis of the recombinant p70 and p80 proteins from Sf9 cells or Ku proteins from K562 cells was performed using murine mAbs (1:1000 dilution) (16Wang J. Dong X. Myung K. Hendrickson E.A. Reeves W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 842-848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Radiolabeling of baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells with [35S]methionine/cysteine and immunoprecipitation onto protein A-Sepharose beads were carried out as described (16Wang J. Dong X. Myung K. Hendrickson E.A. Reeves W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 842-848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The beads were washed with 1.5 m NaCl NET-Nonidet P-40 buffer (1.5 m NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.3% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EDTA) and once with NET buffer (0.15m NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 2 mmEDTA). Immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Ku heterodimer from K562 cells was affinity-purified onto mAb 162-coated protein A-Sepharose beads and digested with proteases (16Wang J. Dong X. Myung K. Hendrickson E.A. Reeves W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 842-848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Protease V8 (Boehringer Mannheim), trypsin-treated tosylphenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone (Millipore Corp., Freehold, NJ), or chymotrypsin (Worthington Biochemical Corp., Freehold, NJ) were added to the beads at 2–200 μg/ml in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 2.5 mmCaCl2 for 30 min at 22 °C. The beads were washed, and p80 fragments remaining associated with the beads were identified by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using S10B1. Sf9 or K562 cells were washed briefly with hypotonic buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, 25 mm KCl, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA), and pellets were resuspended at 2 × 108 cells/ml in the same buffer supplemented with 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and aprotinin (0.3 trypsin inhibitor units/ml). Pellets were lysed by three freeze-thaw cycles and adjusted to 0.5 m KCl and 10 mm MgCl2. After centrifuging, the supernatant was diluted to 0.1 m KCl and stored at −80 °C. A 564-base pair linear double-stranded DNA fragment from bacteriophage λ was radiolabeled with [32P]dATP, and its binding to affinity-purified Ku antigen was measured by DNA immunoprecipitation assay (16Wang J. Dong X. Myung K. Hendrickson E.A. Reeves W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 842-848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell extract was immunoprecipitated on protein A-Sepharose beads with 3 μl of N3H10, 111, or HIS-1 ascitic fluid. Equal amounts of recombinant Ku proteins were bound to the beads, as determined by SDS-PAGE with Coomassie Blue staining. Beads were washed with 1.5m NaCl NET-Nonidet P-40 buffer, followed by the same buffer containing 50 mm NaCl. Radiolabeled DNA (25 ng) was added for 1 h, and the beads were washed again with NET-Nonidet P-40. Bound DNA was recovered by proteinase K digestion, and an aliquot of the supernatant was used for scintillation counting. For gel mobility shift assays, radiolabeled DNA was purified using a Geneclean III kit (Bio 101, Vista, CA) and then incubated with cell extracts in 20 μl of binding buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 150 mm NaCl, 2 μg of closed circular φX174 Rf I DNA) at 22 °C for 30 min (16Wang J. Dong X. Myung K. Hendrickson E.A. Reeves W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 842-848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Samples were analyzed by electrophoresis in a 4% polyacrylamide gel, followed by autoradiography. For supershift experiments, purified mAbs (∼1 μg) were added to the binding mixture 5 min after adding probe and incubated for an additional 30 min at 22 °C before electrophoresis. Two regions of the p70 interact with p80. Binding of p80 to one of these interaction domains contributes to the DNA binding activity of Ku. In the present study, we investigated the mechanism of p80-p70 dimerization and its role in DNA binding. The leucine zipper-like sequence of p70 is not required for dimerization with p80 (16Wang J. Dong X. Myung K. Hendrickson E.A. Reeves W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 842-848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The role of the leucine zipper-like sequence near the N terminus of p80 (18Yaneva M. Wen J. Ayala A. Cook R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13407-13411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in interactions with p70 was investigated by co-expressing a panel of p80 deletion mutants (Fig. 1 A) with full-length p70 in Sf9 cells using recombinant baculoviruses. Recombinant protein expression was verified by immunoprecipitation using the polyhistidine-specific mAb HIS-1 (Fig. 1,B and C, HIS). To detect heterodimer formation, the p80 mutants were co-immunoprecipitated with anti-p70 mAb N3H10 (Fig. 1, B and C, N3H10). Mutant proteins 179–732, 179–654, 179–510, 371–654, and 371–510 were co-immunoprecipitated by N3H10, but 179–400 was not (Fig. 1 B), suggesting that an interaction domain is located in the central portion of p80 (amino acids 371–510), and that the leucine zipper-like region (amino acids 146–178) is not essential for dimerization with p70. Even though 179–654 and 179–510 dimerized with p70 less efficiently than 179–732, their interactions were visualized readily by co-immunoprecipitation assay. Since 179–510 interacted with p70, whereas 179–400 did not, amino acids 400–510 may be crucial for dimerization with p70. However, because 179–400 was expressed less efficiently than the other constructs, it is difficult to completely exclude the possibility that some dimerization might occur with this construct. Mutant 1–178 overlaps the leucine zipper-like sequence, but was not co-immunoprecipitated by N3H10 (Fig. 1 C), indicating that the leucine zipper-like sequence of p80, like that of p70, is not required for dimerization. Mutant 400–732 was co-immunoprecipitated by N3H10 but not 400–510, 510–654, or 654–732 (Fig. 1 C). Thus, even though amino acids 400–510 are crucial for p70-p80 dimerization, this region by itself is insufficient. Additional amino acids either N-terminal (e.g. mutant 371–510) or C-terminal (e.g. mutant 400–732) to the “core” domain (amino acids 400–510) are necessary for binding to p70. mAb 162 recognizes an epitope created by dimerization of p70 with p80 and prevents their dissociation in the presence of 1.5 m NaCl and detergent (19Wang J. Satoh M. Pierani A. Schmitt J. Chou C.H. Stunnenberg H.G. Roeder R.G. Reeves W.H. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 3223-3233PubMed Google Scholar). The 162 binding site on p70 (amino acids 430–542) overlaps the C-terminal interaction domain of p70 (amino acids 430–482). The relationship of the 162 binding site to the interaction domain of p80 was investigated (Fig. 2,A–C). Expression of p70 and p80 deletion mutants was verified by HIS-1 antibody. mAb 162 immunoprecipitated full-length p70 when co-expressed with p80 mutant 179–732, but not 371–732, 179–371, or 1–178 (Fig. 2 B), suggesting that the C-terminal half of p80 contributes to formation of the epitope. mAb 162 also immunoprecipitated p70 when co-expressed with p80 179–654 or 179–510, but not 179–400 (Fig. 2 C), but it did not immunoprecipitate p70 or any of the p80 deletion mutants when expressed alone in Sf9 cells (20Wang J. Dong X. Stojanov L. Kimpel D. Satoh M. Reeves W.H. Arthritis Rheum. 1997; 40: 1344-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). These data confirm the dimerization studies illustrated in Fig. 1 B. We conclude that amino acids 179–510 of p80 contribute to formation of the 162 epitope, and that this region overlaps the dimerization domain of p80. To further define the minimal 162 epitope, p70 (amino acids 430–542) (16Wang J. Dong X. Myung K. Hendrickson E.A. Reeves W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 842-848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) was co-expressed with p80 mutants. mAb 162 immunoprecipitated p70 (430–542) when co-expressed with p80 (179–654 or 179–510), but not p80 (179–400) (data not shown), indicating that the 162 epitope consists of p70 (430–542) plus p80 (179–510). To confirm the co-immunoprecipitation data, dimerization of p70 and p80 was studied in the human K562 cell line. Binding of mAb 162 protects the p70 interaction domain from proteolysis (16Wang J. Dong X. Myung K. Hendrickson E.A. Reeves W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 842-848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), suggesting that the corresponding region of p80 may be protected, as well. Ku heterodimer affinity-purified on mAb 162 was treated with proteases, and p80 fragments retained on 162 beads after protease treatment were analyzed by Western blotting using mAb S10B1 (Fig. 3). The smallest bead-associated p80 fragment after chymotrypsin digestion was a weak, but consistently visualized, band migrating at ∼22 kDa. Western blot analysis using mAb 111 (anti-p80, 610–705) failed to detect fragments smaller than 60 kDa (data not shown). Since S10B1 recognizes amino acids 179–371 of p80, the protease studies support the immunoprecipitation data, indicating that a dimerization site is located in the central portion of p80. The p70 protein carries two separate domains (amino acids 1–115 and 430–482) (16Wang J. Dong X. Myung K. Hendrickson E.A. Reeves W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 842-848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) that apparently interact with a single domain of p80 (amino acids 371–510). Heterodimer assembly was evaluated further by co-expressing p70 deletion mutants overlapping the two dimerization domains separately or together with p80, and immunoprecipitating with anti-Ku mAbs (Fig. 4). Protein expression was verified by anti-polyhistidine immunoprecipitation (Fig. 4, HIS). When co-expressed individually with p80, p70 (1–433) as well as p70 (430–609) could be co-immunoprecipitated by anti-p80 mAb 111 (Fig. 4, 111). In addition, both 1–433 and 430–609 were co-immunoprecipitated by mAb 111 when co-expressed together with p80. The bands intensities were similar regardless of whether the p70 proteins were co-expressed with p80 separately (1–433, 430–609) or together (1–433 + 430–609), suggesting that the p70 mutants do not interfere with each other's binding to p80. Anti-p70 mAb N3H10 also co-immunoprecipitated p80 in 430–609/p80 co-expressing lysates. More importantly, N3H10 co-immunoprecipitated 1–433 along with p80. Some free 430–609 also was immunoprecipitated, accounting for the greater intensity of that band (Fig. 4, right panel). N3H10 does not immunoprecipitate 1–433 when the mutant protein is expressed alone or co-expressed with 430–609 (data not shown), indicating that the two p70 dimerization domains can bind independently to the same p80 molecule. Similar results were obtained when smaller fragments of p70 and p80 carrying dimerization sites were investigated in the same manner (data not shown). Taken together, these data indicate that the two dimerization domains of p70 interact with the central region of p80 and do not compete with one another for binding. The p70 protein has two DNA binding domains, each partially overlapping one of the dimerization sites. The C-terminal site (amino acids 536–609) has DNA end binding activity by itself, whereas N-terminal DNA binding activity requires dimerization with p80. Partial activity is exhibited by amino acids 1–115, and complete activity by amino acids 1–542. Thus, p70 deletion mutants lacking the p80 independent C-terminal domain, such as 1–600, 1–542, or 1–115, bind DNA in a p80-dependent manner. To determine how the p80-dependent site is assembled, the DNA binding activity of p70 (1–600) co-expressed with a panel of p80 mutants overlapping the dimerization domain of p80 was tested (Fig. 5). It was necessary to use DNA immunoprecipitation assays because binding in gel shift assays requires both DNA binding sites (16Wang J. Dong X. Myung K. Hendrickson E.A. Reeves W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 842-848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Consistent with previous findings, wild-type p70 by itself bound to linear dsDNA as well as did the p70/p80 heterodimer (Fig. 5, left). The p70 deletion mutant 1–600 bound DNA poorly, but clearly better than extract from cells infected with wild-type (WT) baculovirus. However, its activity was enhanced considerably by dimerization with p80. Partial p80-dependent DNA binding activity was conferred when p70 (1–600) dimerized with the p80 deletion mutants 179–732, 179–654, or 179–510, each of which overlaps the interaction domain of p80. Decreased binding of the mutants may relate to differences in dimerization efficiency. However, comparable amounts of Ku dimers, determined in preliminary co-immunoprecipitation experiments using N3H10, were used in each lane, arguing that the dimers containing truncated p80 constructs may bind DNA less well. We conclude that p80 (179–510) mediates the p80-dependent DNA binding activity of p70. End binding activity of Ku in gel shift assays requires both the N- and C-terminal DNA binding domains of p70 (16Wang J. Dong X. Myung K. Hendrickson E.A. Reeves W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 842-848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Because p80 is needed for activity of the N-terminal domain, it also is required for binding in gel shift assays (11Griffith A.J. Blier P.R. Mimori T. Hardin J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 331-338Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Wu X. Lieber M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5186-5193Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). To establish the region of p80 conferring DNA binding activity in gel shift assays, the DNA binding of p80 deletion mutants co-expressed with wild-type p70 was tested. Consistent with previous findings, recombinant Ku heterodimer bound DNA efficiently, whereas p70, p80, and p80 deletion mutants by themselves failed to bind in the gel shift assay (Fig. 6 and data not shown). The p80 mutant 179–732, but not 371–732, 179–654, 179–510, or 179–400, bound DNA after dimerizing with wild-type p70 (Fig. 6). The multiple bands visible on the gel (Fig. 6, 179–732/p70 lane, B1, B2, B3) suggest that dimerization also restores the internal translocation property of Ku (21de Vries E. van Driel W. Bergsma W.G. Arnberg A.C. van der Vliet P.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 208: 65-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Binding of the recombinant protein 179–732/p70 to DNA was verified by supershift assays using anti-Ku mAb 162 and anti-polyhistidine mAb HIS-1 (data not shown). Paradoxically, we have shown previously that dimerization with wild-type p80 compensates partially for the deletion of a portion (amino acids 601–609) of the p70 C-terminal DNA binding domain (p70 (1–600), p70Δ), even though the intact C-terminal domain binds DNA independently of p80 (16Wang J. Dong X. Myung K. Hendrickson E.A. Reeves W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 842-848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). However, p80 (179–732) failed to restore the DNA binding activity of p70Δ (Fig. 6, 179–732/p70Δ lane). Thus, p80 (179–732) was required for Ku DNA end binding activity in the gel shift assay, but this region was insufficient to restore the DNA binding activity of p70Δ. Only full-length p80 exhibited the latter effect. The C-terminal DNA binding domain of p70 recognizes dsDNA termini preferentially (17Wang J. Satoh M. Chou C.H. Reeves W.H. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and could, by itself, explain the end binding activity of Ku antigen. The role of the p80-dependent DNA binding site has not been defined. To evaluate whether this site also exhibits preferential end binding activity, competition experiments were carried out as detailed in Ref.17Wang J. Satoh M. Chou C.H. Reeves W.H. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar. Consistent with previous findings, binding of the intact p70/p80 heterodimer to a linear double-stranded DNA probe was preferentially inhibited by linear dsDNA (Fig. 7). There was little inhibition of binding by closed circular DNA (φX174 Rf I DNA or pBKS plasmid DNA) or by tRNA. The full-length p70 protein by itself and p70 (amino acids 430–609) displayed a similar inhibition pattern, suggesting that p70 also binds preferentially to DNA termini. Dimerization of each of the p70 DNA binding domains (p70.430–609 and p70.1–542, respectively) with full-length p80 resulted in constructs that also bound preferentially to linear dsDNA. Binding was not inhibited significantly by φX174 Rf I DNA, pBKS plasmid DNA, or tRNA. Deficiency of Ku autoantigen leads to defective DSBR and V(D)J recombination, resulting in x-ray sensitivity and severe combined immunodeficiency (22Weaver D.T. Adv. Immunol. 1995; 58: 29-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Despite the fact that the p70 Ku subunit can bind dsDNA ends independently of p80 (17Wang J. Satoh M. Chou C.H. Reeves W.H. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), DSBR is absent in cells with p80 mutations (13Errami A. Smider V. Rathmell W.K. He D.M. Hendrickson E.A. Zdzienicka M.Z. Chu G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1519-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 14Singleton B.K. Priestley A. Steingrimsdottir H. Gell D. Blunt T. Jackson S.P. Lehmann A.R. Jeggo P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1264-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), apparently due to the existence of a second, dimerization-dependent, DNA binding site (16Wang J. Dong X. Myung K. Hendrickson E.A. Reeves W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 842-848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In the present study, amino acids 371–510 of p80 was shown to mediate dimerization with p70 and recognition by the Ku dimer-specific mAb 162, in addition to participating in DNA binding. As illustrated in Fig. 8, the locations of the DNA binding and dimerization domains of p80 are consistent with the DSBR-deficient phenotypes of the XR-V9B and XR-V15B cell lines (13Errami A.

A “core” domain (amino acids 400–510), along with sequences flanking this region, may play a crucial role in dimerization, because p80 mutants 179–510, 371–510, and 400–732, but not 400–510, can interact with p70.

Smad1 mediates bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signals, whereas Smad2 functions downstream of TGF-β. TGF-β is expressed in osteoblastic cells and acts as an autocrine and/or paracrine factor in regulation of osteoblastic functions. In this study, we examined the levels and functions of Smad2 in osteoblastic cells. Smad2 mRNA expression was hardly detectable by Northern blot analysis in an osteoblast-like cell line, ROS17/2.8, as well as in primary rat calvaria (PRC) cells. Overexpression of Smad2 gene enhanced endogenous Smad4 gene expression in both ROS17/2.8 and PRC cells, while Smad3 levels were not altered. Smad2 overexpression suppressed osteocalcin mRNA expression in ROS17/2.8 cells. Furthermore, Smad2 overexpression also suppressed transcriptional activity of the 1-kilobase pair osteocalcin gene promoter, which was linked to chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene in both ROS and PRC cells. Since core binding factor A1 (CBFA1) is involved in osteocalcin gene expression, we further examined CBFA1 expression in the Smad2-overexpressing ROS17/2.8 and PRC cells. The levels of CBFA1 mRNA were suppressed by the overexpression of Smad2 by about 50% in both ROS17/2.8 and PRC cells. TGF-β treatment enhanced Smad4 expression in PRC cells, and this TGF-β effect was blocked by the cotreatment with BMP, indicating that TGF-β signaling pathway is interfered by BMP. These data indicate that Smad2 regulates Smad4 specifically and that CBFA1 gene is one of the downstream targets of Smad2.

The TGF-β1 superfamily is a large family of multifunctional ligands that regulate cellular growth and differentiation. Among them, TGF-β signals through distinct heteromeric receptor complexes including type I and type II serine/threonine kinase type receptors. Activation of the receptor complex initiates upon the binding of the ligand to type II receptor, which then recruits and phosphorylates the GS domain of type I receptor to activate it (1Ebner R.

It is produced by osteoblasts and appears to regulate bone metabolism in various ways, including skeletal development and bone remodeling (16Seyedin S.M. Thomas T.C. Tompson A.Y. Rosen D.M. Piez K.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 2267-2271Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). It modulates the expression of several markers of the osteoblastic phenotype. Although TGF-β promotes extracellular matrix production, it inhibits some features of fully differentiated osteoblastic phenotype, such as osteocalcin expression (17Noda M. Endocrinology. 1989; 124: 612-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Osteocalcin, a bone-specific calcium-binding protein, is a major non-collagenous component of the bone matrix and acts as a suppressor of bone formation as shown in knock-out mice (18Ducy P.

Biol. 1992; 12: 89-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The two names refer to an identical molecule. CBF is a complex of two different subunits, A and B. CBFA directly binds to DNA, while CBFB does not interact directly with DNA, but it associates with A subunit to increase DNA binding affinity of the A subunit (25Wang S. Speck N.A. Mol. Cell.

CBFA1 is involved in regulation of T cell gene expression (25Wang S. Speck N.A. Mol. Cell.

Our data indicate that Smad2 regulates expression of Smad4 and that Smad2 also controls the expression of CBFA1 and osteocalcin genes in these osteoblast-like cells and PRC cells.DISCUSSIONIn the present report, we showed that Smad2 overexpression enhanced Smad4 mRNA expression and suppressed CBFA1 expression in ROS17/2.8 cells as well as PRC cells. These observations suggest that overexpressed Smads could be triggering a positive feedback system since Smad4 is their partner to form heteromers to be fully active. Although Smad molecules mediate signals for diverse members of TGF-β superfamily, Smad4 is the only common partner for the other Smads (Smad1, 2, 3, and 5). It appears that Smad4 may play an important role in adjusting different Smad pathways. A recent report in which Smad4 acts as TGF-β-inducible DNA-binding protein further indicates its key role in signal transduction (41Yingling J.M. Datto M.B. Wong C. Frederick J.P. Liberati N.T. Wang X.-F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7019-7028Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Smad3 is a close homologue of Smad2 (42Lagna G. Hata A. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Massagué J. Nature. 1996; 383: 832-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar, 43Zhang Y. Feng X.-H. Wu R.-Y. Derynck R. Nature. 1996; 383: 168-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar, 44Wu R.-Y. Zhang Y. Feng X.-H. Derynck R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2521-2528Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), which has been reported to play a role similar to Smad2 in mediating TGF-β signal transduction. Another Smad family member, Smad1, is considered to mediate BMP signals. We observed that Smad3 and Smad1 were expressed constitutively in ROS17/2.8 cells; however, the levels of Smad3 and Smad1 were not affected by the overexpression of Smad2-MH2, indicating the specificity of the effects of Smad2 overexpression on Smad4 levels. These observations also indicate that Smad2 and Smad3 might have independent signaling pathways, which could mediate different aspects of TGF-β actions.Our results indicate not only that cross-talks among the different Smads family members are present but also that CBFA1 gene is the downstream target of these Smads. TGF-β suppresses osteocalcin production (17Noda M. Endocrinology. 1989; 124: 612-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), and osteocalcin promoter activity is under the control of CBFA1 as reported previously (33Komori T. Yagi H. Nomura S. Yamaguchi A. Sasaki K. Deguchi K. Shimizu Y. Bronson R.T. Gao Y.-H. Inada M. Sato M. Okamoto R. Kitamura Y. Yoshiki S. Kishimoto T.

Cell. 1997; 89: 747-754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3605) Google Scholar). Whether Smad2 suppression of CBFA1 could be involved at least in part in osteocalcin promoter suppression by TGF-β is being investigated by using cells derived from CBFA1 knock-out mice. We also observed that TGF-β inhibited CBFA1 mRNA expression in the presence of BMP, which enhanced CBFA1 expression in ROS17/2.8 cells and PRC cells (data not shown). Although treatment with TGF-β alone did not suppress CBFA1 mRNA levels, it appears that under physiological condition where both BMP and TGF-β are likely to be present at the same time, the role of TGF-β would be to inhibit BMP-induced enhancement of CBFA1 expression as a part of the cytokine network.With regard to the CAT assay, ROS17/2.8 cells showed relatively high osteocalcin promoter activity, and it was suppressed by Smad2 overexpression. On the other hand, although PRC cells revealed low activity of osteocalcin promoter, Smad2 overexpression still suppressed the activity. Thus, Smad2 suppression was observed in relatively immature PRC cells as well as in relatively mature ROS17/2.8 cells.The role of CBFB has been described as a binding partner of CBFA to enhance its binding affinity to DNA. CBFB knock-out mice show similar phenotype to CBFA2 mutant mice, which are embryonic lethal due to the failure in fetal hematopoiesis and to the hemorrhage in central nervous system (46Sasaki K. Yagi H. Bronson R.T. Tominaga K. Matsunashi T. Deguchi K. Tani Y. Kishimoto T. Komori T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12359-12363Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 47Wang Q.

Cell. 1996; 87: 697-708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). The enhancement of CBFB mRNA level by Smad2 overexpression suggest that CBFB may also be a downstream target of Smad2 and it may contribute to the modulation of the transcriptional mechanism, such as facilitating the association of CBFA1 to other transcription factors. It has been reported that CBFB is mainly located in cytoplasm and its level is increased by the differentiation of skeletal myogenic cells (48Chiba N. Watanabe T. Nomura S. Tanaka Y. Minowa M. Niki M. Kanamaru R. Satake M. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2543-2552Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). CBFB has also been reported to interact at a high affinity with cytoskeleton (49Tanaka Y. Watanabe T. Chiba N. Niki M. Kuroiwa Y. Nishihira T. Satomi S. Ito Y. Satake M. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 677-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), suggesting that CBFB could likely function in as yet unidentified aspects besides the function as a subunit of CBF transcription factors. It is also possible that Smad2 activates other CBFA isoform actions via the increase in CBFB; however, this is still a speculation and needs to be elucidated.Similar to the Smad2 enhancement of Smad4 expression, treatment of the PRC cells with TGF-β enhanced Smad4 expression. Cotreatment with BMP blocked the TGF-β effect on Smad4, suggesting a certain interplay between the two cytokines. Intriguingly, BMP alone enhanced Smad4 expression. At this point, the mechanism of the observed inhibitory actions of the BMP against TGF-β enhancement of Smad4 expression is not known. Either alterations in phosphorylation status of the Smad members or the interaction among the pathway-restricted Smads and inhibitory Smads (such as Smad6 or Smad7) should be examined to elucidate the interactive phenomenon between TGF-β and BMP in regulation of Smad4 expression. On the other hand, treatment with TGF-β and/or BMP did not show regulation of Smad4 mRNA levels in ROS17/2.8 cells, suggesting the presence of different signaling pathways at the level of ligand/receptor in ROS17/2.8 cells compared with PRC cells (data not shown).It has been well described that Smad1, 2, 3, and 5 have the carboxyl-terminal phosphorylation sites which are directly phosphorylated by type I receptor. Smad4 does not have this site and cannot be phosphorylated by type I receptor (9Massagué J. Hata A. Liu F. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 187-192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). It has also been reported that the mRNA levels of these Smads are not regulated by the treatment with their ligands (40Nakao A. Afrakhte M. Morén A. Nakayama T. Christian J.L. Heuchel R. Itoh S. Kawabata M. Heldin N.-E. Heldin C.-H. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 389: 631-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (1546) Google Scholar, 50Yamamoto N. Akiyama S. Katagiri T. Namiki M. Kurokawa T. Suda T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 238: 574-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). It seems that alteration in phosphorylation status may be more efficient and quicker in response to ligands binding. We also observed that Smad1 and Smad2 mRNA levels were not regulated by TGF-β or BMP treatment (data not shown). Interestingly, Smad4 mRNA levels were regulated by TGF-β and/or BMP treatment in PRC cells. Combining with the data that Smad4 was specifically enhanced in Smad2-overexpressed cells, Smad4 plays a key role in regulating signal transduction. Recent studies showed that the inhibitory Smads, such as Smad6 and Smad7, are involved in negative feedback of TGF-β-related signals and their mRNA levels are up-regulated by different ligands (40Nakao A. Afrakhte M. Morén A. Nakayama T. Christian J.L. Heuchel R. Itoh S. Kawabata M. Heldin N.-E. Heldin C.-H. ten Dijke P.

Cell. 1997; 89: 1165-1173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1149) Google Scholar).We also observed that Smad6 expression was dramatically enhanced by BMP treatment in PRC cells (data not shown). Although TGF-β treatment did not regulate Smad6 expression in these cells, it abolished the enhancement of Smad6 expression by BMP (data not shown). This feature is similar to that of Smad4, indicating both Smad4 and Smad6 would be involved in the regulation of different Smad pathways. We assume that Smad-dependent TGF-β signals might be regulated at least at three different levels: 1) the phosphorylation status of pathway-restricted Smads by transient binding; 2) the up-regulation of the transcription of inhibitory Smads, which can form stable association with type I receptor and block the phosphorylation of pathway-restricted Smads as a negative feedback mechanism; 3) regulation of the levels of the common-mediator Smad4, as our data showed, to be a positive feedback. The enhancement of Smad4 mRNA probably contributes to TGF-β signal transduction in a ligand-dependent manner. It remains to be elucidated how Smad4 exerts its balancing function between TGF-β and BMP signals.TGF-β is a suppressor of growth in many types of cancer. Disruption of the TGF-β pathway in cancer has been demonstrated in several types of cancers. Inactivation mutations in Smad2 and Smad4/DPC4 were reported in colon cancers as well as other cancers (10Eppert K. Scherer S.W. Ozcelik H. Pirone R. Hoodless P. Kim H. Tsui L.-C. Bapat B.

In ROS17/2.8 cells, the level of Smad2 expression was not detected by Northern blot analysis, and this may be related to tumorigenic phenotype of these cells. However, Smad2 mRNA level was also undetectable by Northern blot in another type of osteoblast-like cell line MC3T3E1 (data not shown) as well as in PRC cells. Although Smad2 mRNA expression is difficult to detect by Northern blot, this result does not exclude the possibility that only a small number of such molecules may be enough to mediate TGF-β actions, such as those that our data on the Smad2 overexpression suggested in this paper.In summary, we showed that Smad2 regulates the expression of Smad4 as well as CBFA1 in the osteoblastic osteosarcoma ROS17/2.8 and primary rat calvaria cells. The TGF-β1 superfamily is a large family of multifunctional ligands that regulate cellular growth and differentiation. Among them, TGF-β signals through distinct heteromeric receptor complexes including type I and type II serine/threonine kinase type receptors. Activation of the receptor complex initiates upon the binding of the ligand to type II receptor, which then recruits and phosphorylates the GS domain of type I receptor to activate it (1Ebner R.

https://openalex.org/W2012730317,"All classes of ribonucleotide reductase are proposed to have a common reaction mechanism involving a transient cysteine thiyl radical that initiates catalysis by abstracting the 3′-hydrogen atom of the substrate nucleotide. In the class Ia ribonucleotide reductase system of Escherichia coli, we recently trapped two kinetically coupled transient radicals in a reaction involving the engineered E441Q R1 protein, wild-type R2 protein, and substrate (Persson, A. L., Eriksson, M., Katterle, B., Potsch, S., Sahlin, M., and Sjoberg, B.-M. (1997)J. Biol. Chem. 272, 31533–31541). Using isotopically labeled R1 protein or substrate, we now demonstrate that the early radical intermediate is a cysteinyl radical, possibly in weak magnetic interaction with the diiron site of protein R2, and that the second radical intermediate is a carbon-centered substrate radical with hyperfine coupling to two almost identical protons. This is the first report of a cysteinyl free radical in ribonucleotide reductase that is a kinetically coupled precursor of an identified substrate radical. We suggest that the cysteinyl radical is localized to the active site residue, Cys439, which is conserved in all classes of ribonucleotide reductase, and which, in the three-dimensional structure of protein R1, is positioned to abstract the 3′-hydrogen atom of the substrate. We also suggest that the substrate radical is localized to the 3′-position of the ribose moiety, the first substrate radical intermediate in the postulated reaction mechanism."

Examination of the fluorescence increase of the poly(dA) etheno-derivative (poly(dεA)) as a function of the binding density of pol β-nucleic acid complexes reveals the existence of two binding phases. In the first high affinity phase, pol β forms a complex with a ssDNA in which 16 nucleotides are occluded by the enzyme. In the second phase, transition to a complex where the polymerase occludes only 5 nucleotides occurs.

The analyses of the enzyme binding to ssDNA have been performed using statistical thermodynamic models, which account for the existence of the two binding modes of the enzyme, cooperative interactions, and the overlap of potential binding sites.

Solution studies showed that the 8-kDa domain has a high affinity for a ss nucleic acid, thus providing evidence that it is the template-binding domain, while the catalytic activity and dsDNA affinity reside in the large 31-kDa domain (17Kumar A.

The in vivo role of pol β is related to its ability to fill short ssDNA gaps, <6 nucleotides, during nucleotide excision repair (2Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis.

Fundamental questions of the pol β mechanism relate to the problem of how the enzyme, which is proposed to form a single type of complex with a ssDNA (18Casas-Finet J.R. Kumar A. Morris G.

Another important question is: does the enzyme have the ability to adjust to the decreasing accessibility of the ssDNA in the vanishing gap during DNA synthesis?Elucidation of the pol β-ssDNA recognition processes constitutes a first step toward understanding the molecular mechanism of the enzyme. In this article, we report the quantitative analysis of human pol β interactions with the ssDNA using the thermodynamically rigorous fluorescence titration technique (21Bujalowski W. Jezewska M.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8513-8519Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 22Jezewska M.J. Kim U.-S. Bujalowski W.

We provide direct evidence that human pol β binds the ssDNA in two binding modes, (pol β)16 and (pol β)5, which differ in the number of occluded nucleotide residues in the complex. Thus, the enzyme can switch between high and low site size binding modes. This ability may be crucial for efficient recognition of the small ssDNA gaps on damaged DNA and for a processive DNA synthesis. Both binding modes differ in affinities and abilities to induce conformational changes in the ssDNA. These differences strongly suggest that, in the (pol β)16 mode, the 31-kDa catalytic domain of the enzyme is involved in interactions with the ssDNA. Polymerase β (pol β)1 is one of the four recognized DNA-directed polymerases of the eucaryotic nucleus: α, β, δ, and ε (1Kornberg A. Baker T.A. DNA Replication. W. H.

The only information about the interactions of the enzyme with a ss nucleic acid comes from studies of the interactions of an analogous rat enzyme with the fluorescent polyribonucleotide, poly(rεA) (17Kumar A.

Chem. 1991; 266: 19618-19625Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These studies indicated that the enzyme forms a single type of complex with ∼11 nucleotide residues occluded by the protein (18Casas-Finet J.R. Kumar A. Morris G. Wilson S.H. Karpel R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19618-19625Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The in vivo role of pol β is related to its ability to fill short ssDNA gaps, <6 nucleotides, during nucleotide excision repair (2Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis.

Fundamental questions of the pol β mechanism relate to the problem of how the enzyme, which is proposed to form a single type of complex with a ssDNA (18Casas-Finet J.R. Kumar A. Morris G. Wilson S.H. Karpel R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19618-19625Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), efficiently recognizes small ssDNA gaps, much smaller than the indicated site size of the complex. Another important question is: does the enzyme have the ability to adjust to the decreasing accessibility of the ssDNA in the vanishing gap during DNA synthesis? Elucidation of the pol β-ssDNA recognition processes constitutes a first step toward understanding the molecular mechanism of the enzyme. In this article, we report the quantitative analysis of human pol β interactions with the ssDNA using the thermodynamically rigorous fluorescence titration technique (21Bujalowski W. Jezewska M.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8513-8519Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 22Jezewska M.J. Kim U.-S. Bujalowski W.

Bujalowski W. Biophys. Chem. 1997; 64: 253-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We provide direct evidence that human pol β binds the ssDNA in two binding modes, (pol β)16 and (pol β)5, which differ in the number of occluded nucleotide residues in the complex. Thus, the enzyme can switch between high and low site size binding modes. This ability may be crucial for efficient recognition of the small ssDNA gaps on damaged DNA and for a processive DNA synthesis. Both binding modes differ in affinities and abilities to induce conformational changes in the ssDNA. These differences strongly suggest that, in the (pol β)16 mode, the 31-kDa catalytic domain of the enzyme is involved in interactions with the ssDNA.

Both cell lines have well differentiated properties in tissue culture. Transforming growth factor α (TGF-α) was ectopically expressed by stable transfection of a TGF-α cDNA under repressible tetracycline control. The TGF-α-transfected cells showed enhanced clonal initiation and shortened lag phase growth in tissue culture without an alteration in doubling time in exponential phase relative to untransfected cells. Furthermore, the TGF-α transfectants showed increased independence from exogenous growth factors in clonal growth assays and induction of DNA synthesis after release from quiescence. Growth factor independence was associated with sustained epidermal growth factor receptor activation in quiescent TGF-α-transfected cells and the requirement of exogenous insulin for stimulation of quiescent cells to re-enter the cell cycle. Higher cloning, reduced lag time in tissue, and the acquisition of growth factor independence for DNA synthesis without a change in doubling time of TGF-α-transfected cells indicate that autocrine TGF-α functions by facilitating re-entry into the cell cycle from sub-optimal growth states rather than promoting or controlling the proliferation of actively cycling cells. The modulation of growth regulation by autocrine TGF-α was associated with increased malignant properties as TGF-α transfectants showed increased tumorigenicity in athymic nude mice. The administration of tetracycline reversed the effects of TGF-α expression in these cells both in vivo and in vitro, indicating that the alterations of the biological properties were due to the expression of TGF-α. Since these cells are continuously grown in a completely chemically defined medium without serum supplementation, it was possible to assign the mechanism underlying the generation of growth factor independence to the replacement of a requirement for exogenous insulin in parental cells by autocrine TGF-α.

Transforming growth factor α (TGF-α)1 is a potent mitogen structurally and functionally related to the epidermal growth factor (EGF) family of proteins (1Lyons R.M. Moses H.L. Eur. J.

The contribution of TGF-α in the malignant progression of human carcinomas has not been well studied. Moreover, although it is clear that TGF-α promotes tumorigenicity and malignant progression in a variety of in vitro and in vivo assays, it is not apparent what specific growth advantages it imparts to cells in the various contexts of proliferative function and what specific growth functions it replaces in generating the independence from exogenous growth factors associated with malignant progression. More specifically, it is not known whether autocrine TGF-α functions by driving exponential growth or whether it is more critical in other contexts of proliferation such as re-entry into the cell cycle from growth-arrested states. These gaps in our understanding of TGF-α function in malignancy reflect a general lack of understanding as to how autocrine-positive growth factors contribute a growth advantage to malignant cells, especially in light of the well documented autocrine activity of normal cells (34Bates S.E. Valverius E.M. Ennis B.W. Bronzert D.A. Sheridan J.P. Stampfer M.R. Mendelsohn J. Lippman M.E. Dickson R.B. Endocrinology. 1990; 126: 596-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Thus, an in depth understanding of how TGF-α works in malignancy will provide direction for the investigation of other autocrine factors. Moreover, the understanding of the pathological nature of growth regulatory disruptions associated with malignant progression may lead to new approaches for the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of cancer. We have addressed the issue of understanding the pathological disruption of growth regulation by autocrine TGF-α using growth factor-dependent cell line models (CBS and FET cells) grown in completely chemically defined medium. Consequently, specific exogenous growth factor requirements have been defined for exponential proliferation as well as re-entry into the cell cycle from growth-arrested states (16Mulder K.M. Brattain M.G. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 1215-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 17Wan C.W. Mcknight K.M. Brattain D.E. Brattain M.G. Yeoman L.C. Cancer Lett. 1988; 43: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). These growth factor-dependent cell lines were stably transfected with a human TGF-α cDNA under repressible control by tetracycline in order to generate a strong autocrine TGF-α loop so that specific growth requirements assumed by autocrine TGF-α could be determined and evaluated in the context of malignant progression as well. Repressible tetracycline control has permitted analysis of specific growth states in tissue culture and in vivo which are dependent upon autocrine TGF-α, whereas the completely chemically defined medium in which these cells are continuously maintained and grown permits the determination of specific exogenous growth factor requirements replaced by autocrine TGF-α activity. Previously, we contrasted the biological properties of these early stage malignant cell models with those of highly progressed colon carcinoma cell lines (18Brattain M.G. Levine A.E. Chakrabarty S. Yeoman L.C. Willson J.K.V. Long B.H. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1984; 3: 177-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 19Chantret I. Barbat E. Dussaulx E. Zweibaum A.

Physiol. 1995; 162: 256-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In contrast to early stage models, highly malignant colon carcinoma cells are completely growth factor-independent with respect to stimulation by exogenous growth factors, are anchorage-independent, and form tumors in 100% of athymic mice with as little as 106 cells. Importantly, these highly malignant cells express TGF-α and EGFR constitutively in growth-arrested states in contrast to CBS and FET cells in which TGF-α is down-regulated during the establishment of growth arrest. CBS and FET cells are well differentiated in tissue culture as indicated by retention of basolateral polarity, microvilli, and transport function (18Brattain M.G. Levine A.E. Chakrabarty S. Yeoman L.C. Willson J.K.V. Long B.H. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1984; 3: 177-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 19Chantret I. Barbat E. Dussaulx E. Zweibaum A.

Physiol. 1995; 162: 256-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Moreover, they are weakly anchorage-independent and poorly tumorigenic in athymic mice (18Brattain M.G. Levine A.E. Chakrabarty S. Yeoman L.C. Willson J.K.V. Long B.H. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1984; 3: 177-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 20Mulder K.M. Brattain M.G. Augenlicht L. The Cell and Molecular Biology of Colon Cancer. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1989: 45-67Google Scholar). These cells are dependent upon exogenous growth factors for DNA synthesis with a requirement for insulin to re-enter the cell cycle from a growth-arrested state. TGF-α transfection using a tetracycline-repressible system permitted the generation of CBS and FET cells in which TGF-α was not down-regulated at growth arrest since the transgene was not under control of the TGF-α promoter. This created a model that could then be modulated to behave in the same manner as the highly malignant cells described above in which TGF-α was expressed in growth arrest or to behave like weakly malignant cells that down-regulate TGF-α in growth arrest when tetracycline was added. Comparison of wild type cells with TGF-α transfectants shows that autocrine TGF-α generates malignant progression in a tetracycline-repressible manner by the criteria of tumorigenicity in athymic mice and anchorage-independent growth. In addition, several lines of evidence indicate that autocrine TGF-α mitigates the requirements for exogenous insulin and EGF in this model system. Finally, we show that inappropriate TGF-α expression in transfected cells provides a growth advantage over wild type cells by enhancing the ability of growth-arrested cells to re-enter the cell cycle in association with inappropriate EGFR activation in growth arrest. Inappropriate EGFR activation resulted in the recruitment of other EGFR family members to form complexes with the activated EGFR in growth-arrested TGF-α-transfected cells. The recruitment of other EGFR family members expanded the potential for additional signal transduction pathways. The advantage of growth factor independence would be of particular importance to malignant cells under environmental conditions that are limiting to growth. Environmental restriction on growth appears to be common in solid tumors such as colon carcinoma in which labeling studies have shown that fewer than 1% of the malignant cells are cycling at any given time (41Goldie J.H. Coldman A.J. Cancer Treat. Rep. 1979; 63: 1727-1733PubMed Google Scholar). The human colon carcinoma cell lines were originally isolated from primary tumors as described previously (18Brattain M.G. Levine A.E. Chakrabarty S. Yeoman L.C. Willson J.K.V. Long B.H. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1984; 3: 177-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) and continuously maintained in a chemically defined serum-free medium consisting of McCoy's 5A medium (Sigma) supplemented with pyruvate, vitamins, amino acids, antibiotics, insulin (20 μg/ml, Sigma), transferrin (4 μg/ml, Sigma), and EGF (10 ng/ml, R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) (20Mulder K.M. Brattain M.G. Augenlicht L. The Cell and Molecular Biology of Colon Cancer. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1989: 45-67Google Scholar). Working cultures were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and routinely checked for mycoplasma contamination. Limiting dilution clones were obtained by plating the parental cells into 96-well tissue culture plates at one cell per well. Typical limiting dilution clones (designated as CBS4 and FET6) were used for transfection to ensure the uniformity of the isolated transfectants. TGF-α transfectants and control cells were routinely maintained in serum-free medium containing 650 μg/ml active geneticin (Life Technologies, Inc.). A 930-bp fragment of full-length TGF-α cDNA (23Derynck R. Roberts A.B. Eaton D.H. Winkler M.E. Goeddel D.V. Cancer Cells. 1985; 3: 79-86Google Scholar) was inserted into the EcoRI site of the polycloning region in the tetracycline-repressible vector pUHD10–3 (22Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4214) Google Scholar) in the sense orientation relative to the human cytomegalovirus (hCMV) minimal promoter to create the expression plasmid pTET-TGF-α. Orientation of the insert was confirmed by restriction digestion. The hCMV minimal promoter requires a tetracycline-controlled transactivator (tTA) that is constitutively produced by another vector. The latter vector (pUHD15–1/NEO) also contains the neomycin-resistant gene which can be used for antibiotic selection (24Sun L. Wu G. Willson J.K.V. Zborowska E. Yang J. Rajkarunanayake I. Wang J. Gentry L.E. Wang X.F. Brattain M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26449-26455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because tetracycline prevents tTA from binding to tet operators placed upstream of the hCMV minimal promoter, it represses the tTA-dependent expression system. The expression vector (10 μg) and the tTA-expressing vector (1 μg) were co-transfected into cells by electroporation (Bio-Rad) at 250 V and 960 millifarads. The control cells were transfected with the tTA-NEO selection vector and the cloning vector without any insert. Selection of stable transfectants was carried out by addition of geneticin (650 μg/ml). After 3 weeks of selection, geneticin-resistant clones were isolated and expanded to screen for TGF-α expression. Tetracycline (Sigma) was dissolved in 50% ethanol and stored at −20 °C. Tetracycline was added to the culture medium at a final concentration of 0.1 μg/ml. Fresh tetracycline was added when changing medium (2× weekly). Tetracycline was added to the drinking water of athymic nude mice at a concentration of 3 mg/ml on day 6 and 2 mg/ml on days 7 through 21 of the in vivo study. Total RNA was isolated from confluent cell cultures by lysis in guanidine isothiocyanate and purified by ultracentrifugation through a cesium trifluoroacetic acid gradient as described previously (25Chirgwin J.M. Przybala A.E. MacKondla R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16610) Google Scholar). TGF-α RNase protection assays were performed as described previously (21Howell G.M. Ziober B.L. Humphrey L.E. Willson J.K.V. Sun L. Lynch M. Brattain M.G. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 162: 256-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Briefly, a 306-bp high specific riboprobe was generated with the TGF-α riboprobe template in the presence of [α-32P]UTP (NEN Life Science Products) by Sp6 RNA polymerase. The riboprobe was hybridized with 20 μg of total RNA for 12–16 h. Following RNase digestion of excess riboprobe, the protected fragment was electrophoresed on a 6% polyacrylamide, 7m urea sequencing gel. Loading was normalized by simultaneous hybridization of the RNA with an actin probe that yields a 145-bp protected fragment (21Howell G.M. Ziober B.L. Humphrey L.E. Willson J.K.V. Sun L. Lynch M. Brattain M.G. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 162: 256-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The protected endogenous TGF-α fragment was 283 bp, whereas the protected, transfected TGF-α fragment was 306 bp, since the expression vector contained an additional 23 bp of vector sequence. This provided the ability to distinguish the expression of the transfected TGF-α mRNA from the endogenous mRNA. Quantitative analysis of the protected mRNA was performed with an Ambis Analysis System (Ambis, San Diego, CA). Cells were plated at 120,000 cells per well in 6-well plates in serum-free medium lacking EGF in the presence or absence of tetracycline at a final concentration of 0.1 μg/ml. On day 4, 48-h conditioned medium was collected and clarified by centrifugation. Cells were enumerated with a hemocytometer after trypsinization. TGF-α levels were measured with a TGF-α enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Oncogene Science) following the manufacturer's instructions. The TGF-α levels were normalized to cell numbers and expressed as TGF-α protein per 106 cells. Cells were plated at a clonal density of 300 cells/well into 24-well tissue culture plates in serum-free medium in the presence or absence of EGF. Tetracycline was used at a final concentration of 0.1 μg/ml. Cells were grown for 13 days without changing the culture medium. The cells were stained by addition of 500 μl of 0.2% of 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (Sigma) to each well for 2 h. Following removal of the medium and staining solution, the colonies were solubilized in 800 μl of Me2SO. The plates were placed on a shaker for 5 min at room temperature after which they were read immediately at 595 nm. The absorbance of dissolved colonies is directly proportional to the number of cells in culture. Cells were plated at different cell densities (30,000–360,000 cells/well) into 6-well tissue culture plates in serum-free medium lacking EGF. Every other day the medium was changed. The cells were pulse-labeled with methyl[3H]thymidine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 1 h. DNA synthesis was measured by incorporation of methyl-[3H]thymidine into trichloroacetic acid-precipitable material. The mitogenesis assays were performed as described previously (16Mulder K.M. Brattain M.G. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 1215-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The cells were plated at a density of either 3.0 × 104cells per well in 24-well tissue culture plates or 1.2 × 105 cells per well in 6-well plates in medium containing transferrin, insulin, and EGF. The cells were rendered quiescent by growth factor and nutrient deprivation for 6 days in supplemental McCoy's medium after reaching saturation density (7 days). Previous work (16Mulder K.M. Brattain M.G. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 1215-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) showed that CBS and FET cells treated by this protocol had a labeling index of 5–10% as determined by [3H]thymidine incorporation followed by autoradiography. Cells were released from quiescence with supplemental McCoy's medium (nutrients alone) or serum-free medium (nutrients and growth factors). The cells were pulse-labeled with methyl[3H]thymidine for 1 h. DNA synthesis was measured by incorporation of methyl[3H]thymidine into trichloroacetic acid-precipitable material at the peak of DNA synthesis 18 h after release from quiescence (16Mulder K.M. Brattain M.G. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 1215-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Cells was washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and harvested in cold lysis buffer (0.5% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl with protease inhibitors freshly added). Crude cell lysates were passed through a 21-gauge needle 4× to sheer DNA, incubated on ice for 30 min, and centrifuged for 20 min at 4 °C. Samples were incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-EGFR antibody or anti-activated EGFR antibody (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY). Immunoprecipitates were subsequently incubated with 50% protein A-agarose suspension (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 30 min at 4 °C and then were washed twice with cold lysis buffer 3 times followed by centrifugation. Pellets were resuspended in sample buffer (0.125m Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 4% SDS, 10% glycerol, and 4% β-mercaptoethanol), heated for 5 min at 95 °C, and resolved by 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by transfer to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked with TTBS buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.5 m NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) containing 5% nonfat dried milk for 2 h at 4 °C with continuous rotation. The immunoprecipitates with anti-EGFR antibody were then detected with phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody (PY99) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The immunocomplexes with anti-activated EGFR antibody were then immunoblotted with anti-ErbB2 and anti-ErbB3 polyclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and anti-SHC antibody (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.), respectively. The blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature and then washed twice with water, 5 min with TTBS buffer, and 5 more times with water. The membrane was immersed in ECL for 1 min and exposed to ECL film. EGFR activation was also directly detected with an anti-activated EGFR antibody (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY). This activated EGFR antibody is unique in that it reacts only with the tyrosine-phosphorylated (activated) EGF receptor (26Campos-Gonzalez R. Glenney Jr., J.R. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 663-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The cell lysates were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis gel followed by transfer to nitrocellulose membranes. Then the membrane was probed with the anti-activated EGFR antibody directly. Soft agarose assays were performed as described previously (18Brattain M.G. Levine A.E. Chakrabarty S. Yeoman L.C. Willson J.K.V. Long B.H. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1984; 3: 177-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Briefly, 3,000 cells suspended in serum-free growth medium minus EGF containing 0.4% agarose (Sigma) were plated per well into 6-well tissue culture plates containing 0.8% agarose underlayers. Colonies were allowed to grow for 2 weeks at 37 °C in a humidified incubator at 5% CO2, stained with 1 ml of p-iodonitrotetrazolium violet (Sigma), and photographed. NEO control and TGF-α transfectant cells were injected subcutaneously behind the anterior forelimb of 5–6-week-old Balb/c athymic mice. Mice were maintained in a genotobiotic environment before and during each experiment. Tetracycline was given to mice in drinking water at a concentration of 3 mg/ml on day 6 and 2 mg/ml on day 7 through day 21 of inoculation. Growth curves for xenografts were determined by externally measuring tumors in two dimensions using a caliper. Volume (V) was determined by the following equation, where L is length and W is the width of the tumor: V = (L × W 2) × 0.5. Flow cytometry was performed as described previously (43Wu G Fan R.S. Li W Ko T.C. Brattain M.G. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1555-1563Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Briefly, trypsinized cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 0.4–0.6 ml of low salt propidium iodide stain (0.03 g/ml polyethylene glycol, 0.05 mg/ml propidium iodide (Sigma), 0.1% Triton X-100, and 4 mmsodium citrate). The suspension was incubated with 10 μl of RNase A (2 mg/ml, DNase-free) at 37 °C for 20 min. An equal volume of high salt stain (0.03 g/ml polyethylene glycol, 0.05 mg/ml propidium iodide (Sigma), 0.1% Triton X-100, and 400 mm sodium chloride) was then added. The mixture was vortexed gently and stored at 4 °C overnight. The cell cycle phase distribution was performed using a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton-Dickinson, San Jose, CA), and cell cycle parameters were obtained using a ModFit LT program (Verity Software House Inc.). Following transfection, geneticin-resistant clones were isolated and expanded for screening of TGF-α expression. Four clones (designated CBS4 αS2, αS3, αS5, and αS6) expressing high TGF-α mRNA and protein were identified. The CBS4 transfectants (Fig. 1, lanes 4, 6, 8, and 10) expressed 15–25-fold higher TGF-α mRNA levels relative to CBS4-NEO (lane 2). As described under “Experimental Procedures,” the size of the protected transfected TGF-α mRNA fragment in RNase protection assays was larger than the protected endogenous TGF-α mRNA. Tetracycline (0.1 μg/ml) repressed the expression of transfected TGF-α mRNA (Fig. 1,lanes 3, 5, 7, and 9). TGF-α protein levels in conditioned medium also showed a marked increase of 15–25-fold as compared with CBS4-NEO (Fig. 2 and data not shown). Similarly, the TGF-α protein levels were repressed by the presence of 0.1 μg/ml tetracycline in the growth medium (Fig. 2). Therefore, the overexpression of TGF-α mRNA is reflected by increased expression of the amount of TGF-α released into culture medium. Similar results were obtained from FET-NEO and TGF-α-transfectant cells. The effects of expression of TGF-α on the clonal growth of CBS4 cells were determined. Our previous work has shown that CBS cells require exogenous growth factors for optimal growth (16Mulder K.M. Brattain M.G. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 1215-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 20Mulder K.M. Brattain M.G. Augenlicht L. The Cell and Molecular Biology of Colon Cancer. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1989: 45-67Google Scholar). We hypothesized that the overexpression of TGF-α would reduce the growth factor requirements of CBS4 cells and result in increased clonal formation in the absence of growth factors. As expected, the clonal initiation of CBS4 cells overexpressing TGF-α was markedly increased, as compared with the CBS4-NEO cells (Fig. 3). The control cells (NEO) showed an EGF-dependent phenotype in cloning efficiency experiments. The TGF-α transfectants showed an EGF-independent phenotype in the absence of tetracycline treatment (Fig. 3 A). These findings suggested that overexpression of TGF-α could move more cells from the non-dividing, quiescent stage back into the cell cycle and drive more cells to initiate the clonal growth. However, in the presence of tetracycline which suppressed expression of TGF-α in the transfected cells, the clones revealed a growth factor-dependent phenotype similar to that of the NEO control cells (Fig. 3 B). These data provide one line of evidence that autocrine TGF-α enhances re-entry into the cell cycle under environmental conditions that are not optimal for growth. Another line of evidence of increased growth factor independence of TGF-α transfectants was demonstrated by mitogenesis studies. Quiescent growth-arrested CBS cells require exogenous growth factors in addition to fresh nutrients for re-entry into the cell cycle and induction of DNA synthesis as described previously (16Mulder K.M. Brattain M.G. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 1215-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). CBS4 control cells required exogeno"
https://openalex.org/W2019491580,"Human thymidylate synthase (TS) contains three highly conserved residues Ile-108, Leu-221, and Phe-225 that have been suggested to be important for cofactor and antifolate binding. To elucidate the role of these residues and generate drug-resistant human TS mutants, 14 variants with multiple substitutions of these three hydrophobic residues were created by site-directed mutagenesis and transfected into mouse TS-negative cells for complementation assays and cytotoxicity studies, and the mutant proteins expressed and characterized. The I108A mutant confers resistance to raltitrexed and Thymitaq with respective IC50 values 54- and 80-fold greater than wild-type but less resistance to BW1843U89 (6-fold). The F225W mutant displays resistance to BW1843U89 (17-fold increase in IC50 values), but no resistance to raltitrexed and Thymitaq. It also confers 8-fold resistance to fluorodeoxyuridine. Both the kinetic characterization of the altered enzymes and formation of antifolate-resistant colonies in mouse bone marrow cells that express mutant TS are in accord with the IC50 values for cytotoxicity noted above. The human TS mutants (I108A and F225W), by virtue of their desirable properties, including good catalytic function and resistance to antifolate TS inhibitors, confirm the importance of amino acid residues Ile-108 and Phe-225 in the binding of folate and its analogues.

TS inhibitors, which occupy either the substrate or cofactor-binding site, have been designed based on the structure and properties of the enzyme. Fluoropyrimidines, such as 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and fluorodeoxyuridine (FdUrd), are metabolized to 5-fluoro-2-deoxyuridine monophosphate (FdUMP) and compete subsequently with the substrate, dUMP, for its binding site and have been used in the clinic for over 40 years to treat breast and gastrointestinal cancers. However, fluoropyrimidines, due to their incorporation into DNA and RNA, are not pure TS inhibitors. Also, they are susceptible to metabolic degradation in vivo. In contrast, the cofactor CH2H4folate is a relatively large molecule and has a variety of binding sites that may be altered in drug design. In recent years folate analogues have been designed as highly specific and stable TS inhibitors (6Shoichet B.K. Stroud R.M. Santi D.V. Kuntz I.D. Perry K.M. Science. 1993; 259: 1445-1450Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). The inhibitor CB3717 was the first folate analogue inhibitor of TS tested in the clinic and although anti-tumor activity was demonstrated, its further development was abandoned due to renal and hepatic toxicity (7Jones T.R.

These new and promising agents have entered clinical trials, and raltitrexed was recently approved for treatment of advanced colorectal cancer in the United Kingdom. Raltitrexed and BW1843U89 contain a glutamate moiety and can be metabolized to noneffluxable polyglutamate forms within the cell, which bind to the enzyme more tightly than the corresponding monoglutamylated forms. Since the polyglutamates are necessary for cytotoxicity, the lack of polyglutamylation may lead to intrinsic drug resistance. The new generation of TS-directed inhibitors such as Thymitaq and AG331, lacking a negatively charged glutamate side chain, are based on computer-assisted design using high-resolution x-ray crystallography results (24Appelt K. et al.J.

These compounds do not utilize the reduced folate transporter for cell entry, and more importantly drug potency is independent of polyglutamylation. In a previous study (28Tong Y. Liu-Chen X. Ercikan-Abali E.A. Capiau G.M. Zhao S.C. Banerjee D. Bertino J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11611-11618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), we generated mutant forms of TS leading to resistance of antifolates and fluorodeoxyuridine by ethylmethanesulfonate mutagenesis and Thymitaq selection. We found two mutant forms of TS that displayed resistance to Thymitaq and FdUrd, but not to raltitrexed. Surprisingly, the mutations obtained were in the highly conserved Arg-50 loop, involved in dUMP binding to TS. In the present study, we mutated bases that code for three amino acids believed to be critical for binding of the folate coenzyme, methylene tetrahydrofolate, to TS. Human TS mutants that confer resistance to novel antifolates (raltitrexed, Thymitaq, and BW1843U89) were obtained, with minimal to modest changes in the catalytic activity of the enzyme. Data presented herein indicates that two TS mutants (I108A and F225W) selectively confer resistance to antifolates and provide evidence that these TS inhibitors bind to TS in different ways. These mutant forms of TS are also of interest for their potential role in cancer gene therapy. For example, transfection of a mutant TS cDNA to human hematopoietic progenitors may allow dose-intense therapy in cancer patients by preventing dose-limiting myelotoxicity (29Koc O.N. Allay J.A. Lee K. Davis B.M. Reese J.S. Gerson S.L. Semin. Oncology. 1996; 23: 46-65PubMed Google Scholar). Human TS cDNA in the pET17×b vector was inserted into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3, named as pcDNA3hTS (28Tong Y. Liu-Chen X. Ercikan-Abali E.A. Capiau G.M. Zhao S.C. Banerjee D.

Purif. 1997; 10: 256-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). For construction of the 14 human TS mutants, the plasmid pcDNA3hTS was used as a template for site-directed mutagenesis (TransformerTM site-directed mutagenesis kit, CLONTECH Laboratories). The mutagenic primer in each reaction was a 22 to 26-base long oligonucleotide complementary to the human TS coding domain with corresponding mutant codons. The selective primers were the same as described previously (28Tong Y. Liu-Chen X. Ercikan-Abali E.A. Capiau G.M. Zhao S.C. Banerjee D. Bertino J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11611-11618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The correct constructs with human TS mutants were verified further by restriction mapping and DNA sequencing. Mouse TS-negative FSthy21 cells were used as the host for expression of human TS mutants (31Ayusawa D. Koyama H. Iwata K. Seno T. Somatic Cell Genet. 1981; 7: 523-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Cells were transfected with mammalian expression plasmids using DOTAP (Boehringer Mannheim, Indianapolis, IN). Three days after transfection, cells were switched to selective medium lacking thymidine. Surviving cells, able to grow in the absence of thymidine, were cloned in soft agarose. Growth inhibition assays for cloned mouse TS-negative FSthy21 cells transfected with wild-type or variant human TS cDNA were conducted with raltitrexed, Thymitaq, BW1843U89, and FdUrd (28Tong Y. Liu-Chen X. Ercikan-Abali E.A. Capiau G.M. Zhao S.C. Banerjee D. Bertino J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11611-11618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Cell viability was measured by the Alamar BlueTM (Alamar Biosciences, Inc., Sacramento, CA) assay, and IC50 values were determined graphically by plotting cell growth versesinhibitor concentrations. To generate human TS variant (I108A or F225W) proteins for the analysis of enzyme kinetics, the mutant TS cDNA was inserted into NdeI and XhoI sites of the protein expression vector pET-17×b (Novagen, Madison, WI). After transformation with pET-17×b-hTS (I108A or F225W), expression of wild-type or mutant TS was induced with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside in Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3). The purification procedures of wild-type and mutant TSs were carried out as described previously (30Pedersen-Lane J. Maley G.F. Chu E. Maley F. Protein Exp.

Methods for measurement of k cat values, the Michaelis constants (K m values) for CH2H4folate and dUMP and inhibition constants (K ivalues) for raltitrexed, Thymitaq, BW1843U89, and FdUMP were as described previously (28Tong Y.

CFU-GM (colony-forming unit-granulocyte macrophage) and HPP-CFC (high proliferative potential-colony forming cell) assays were carried out as described previously (35Li M. Hantzopoulos P.A.

Briefly, bone marrow cells from CBA/J (7 to 11 weeks of age, male) mice were harvested in Isocove's modified Dulbecco's medium and 20% fetal calf serum. A mononuclear cell suspension was prepared by Ficoll-Hypaque separation. The pcDNA3 plasmid carrying wild-type or I108A mutant TS was transfected into marrow cells using DOTAP (36Banerjee D. Zhao S.C. Tong Y. Steinherz J. Gritsman K. Bertino J.R. Cancer Gene Therapy. 1994; 1: 181-184PubMed Google Scholar). After 48 h prestimulation with cytokines, the bone marrow cells were exposed to raltitrexed or Thymitaq in thymidine phosphorylase-treated serum. CFU-GM colonies of ≥50 cells were enumerated microscopically after 14 days and HPP-CFC colonies were also scored, which are defined as dense colonies greater than 0.5 mm in diameter (37Kittler E.L.W.

Substitutions of amino acid residues located in binding regions of enzymes may cause dramatic shifts of binding affinities to substrates and inhibitors. For example, the amino acids at positions 22 and 31 of dihydrofolate reductase that interact with the PABA ring of H2folate have been found to be altered in methotrextrate-resistant cell lines, suggesting that these positions are mutational hot spots in the dihydrofolate reductase coding regions (38Simonsen C.C. Levinson A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 2495-2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 39Schweitzer B.I. Srimatkandada S. Gritsman H. Sheridan R. Venkataraghavan R. Bertino J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20786-20795Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). X-ray crystallographic studies of liganded E. coliTS have revealed that the binding site for the PABA ring of cofactor is associated with a hydrophobic region that includes Trp-109, Asn-112, Met-311, Ile-108, Leu-221, and Phe-225 (9Montfort W.R.

Xuong N.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 214: 923-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1). The residue Met-311 is not as highly conserved as others, while positions 109 and 112 are quite sensitive to mutagenesis, as shown by previous mutation studies in bothLactobacillus casei and E. coli TS (4Carreras C.W. Santi D.V. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 721-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). We decided to mutate Ile-108, Leu-221, and Phe-225 residues providing major hydrophobic interactions with the PABA moiety of folates when the ternary complex is formed, as substitution studies for these three amino acid residues have not been described for human TS. Based on the above considerations, multiple substitutions at positions 108, 221, and 225 were performed by site-directed mutagenesis. To assess the catalytic activity of TS mutants and to evaluate the effects of TS inhibitors on cell viability, mammalian TS-deficient cells were used in a complementation assay. We expected that certain amino acid changes in target residues would alter the conformation of the TS active site and or the electrostatic environment, resulting in altered binding affinities with substrate and inhibitors, thus leading to drug resistance. To investigate the effect of amino acid substitution at Ile-108, Leu-221, and Phe-225 on drug resistance, isoleucine 108 was replaced with alanine, phenylalanine, glycine, glutamate, and asparagine; leucine 221 was replaced with phenylalanine, arginine, alanine, isoleucine, and serine; and phenylalanine 225 was replaced with serine, leucine, tyrosine, and tryptophan. A mammalian expression plasmid (pcDNA3hTS) carrying human TS cDNA with minor modification of the N-terminal nucleotide codon to enhance enzyme expression, was used as a template for creating mutant TS vectors (30Pedersen-Lane J. Maley G.F. Chu E. Maley F. Protein Exp. Purif. 1997; 10: 256-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The mutant enzymes were expressed in mouse TS-negative cells (Fsthy21) by stable transfection of human TS cDNA variants. The host cells are unable to survive without exogenous thymidine. Eight TS mutants (I108A, I108F, L221A, L221I, L221S, F225W, F225L, and F225Y) exhibited behavior indistinguishable from the wild-type enzyme in the complementation experiments. In contrast, cells were unable to survive transfection with six other human TS variants (I108G, I108E, I108N, L221F, L221R, and F225S) (data not shown). For each transfectant, surviving clones were isolated and then expanded to cell lines by growth in normal media. From the transfectants of human TS wild-type or variants, cell lines derived from clones with levels of TS protein similar to wild-type as measured by Western blotting (data not shown), were chosen for cytotoxicity studies with three antifolates (raltitrexed, Thymitaq, and BW1843U89) and FdUrd. The selected transfectants and the IC50 values of drugs tested are presented in Table I. As indicated, statistically significant differences in the IC50 values were as follows: 1) the I108A mutant transfected cells were resistant to raltitrexed and Thymitaq with respective IC50 values 54- and 80-fold greater than wild-type transfectants. Less resistance was observed with BW1843U89 and FdUrd (6- and 16-fold, respectively); 2) F225W transfectants demonstrated 17- and 8-fold resistance to BW1843U89 and FdUrd, respectively, but were not resistant to raltitrexed and Thymitaq.Table IRaltitrexed (ZD1694), Thymitaq (AG337), BW1843U89 and 5-fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine (FdUrd) sensitivity in TS-negative cells transfected by wild-type and various mutant human TS cDNATransfected TS-negative cells and its cloneRaltitrexed (ZD1694)Thymitaq (AG337)BW1843U89FdUrdIC50values (×10−9m)1-bIC50 values were obtained following 7-day exposures from full dose-response curves and represent the mean ± S.E. of at least two separate experiments involving duplicate samples from replicate cultures.Ratio1-aThe ratio is the IC50 value of mutant to wild-type.IC50 values (×10−7m)1-bIC50 values were obtained following 7-day exposures from full dose-response curves and represent the mean ± S.E. of at least two separate experiments involving duplicate samples from replicate cultures.Ratio1-aThe ratio is the IC50 value of mutant to wild-type.IC50 values (×10−9m)1-bIC50 values were obtained following 7-day exposures from full dose-response curves and represent the mean ± S.E. of at least two separate experiments involving duplicate samples from replicate cultures.Ratio1-aThe ratio is the IC50 value of mutant to wild-type.IC50 values (×10−11m)1-bIC50 values were obtained following 7-day exposures from full dose-response curves and represent the mean ± S.E. of at least two separate experiments involving duplicate samples from replicate cultures.Ratio1-aThe ratio is the IC50 value of mutant to wild-type.Wild-type/clone (1)1.80 ± 0.473.83 ± 0.693.68 ± 0.148.96 ± 0.62I108A/clone (1)97.9 ± 17.154305 ± 378022.8 ± 4.26.2140 ± 1916I108F/clone (2)1.52 ± 0.200.8411.4 ± 1.23.03.44 ± 0.030.9317.6 ± 2.82.0L221A/clone (2)1.46 ± 0.090.818.96 ± 0.342.37.41 ± 0.252.011.6 ± 3.11.3L221I/clone (1)1.98 ± 0.401.18.51 ± 0.182.27.53 ± 0.252.038.1 ± 4.14.3L221S/clone (2)1.80 ± 0.061.07.38 ± 0.281.97.63 ± 0.262.13.49 ± 0.550.39F225W/clone (2)1.76 ± 0.010.981.70 ± 0.350.4461.1 ± 10.31773.8 ± 2.68.2F225L/clone (3)1.33 ± 0.290.741.64 ± 0.560.437.84 ± 0.442.116.5 ± 2.81.8F225Y/clone (1)1.53 ± 0.170.852.38 ± 0.450.627.32 ± 0.172.03.01 ± 0.060.331-a The ratio is the IC50 value of mutant to wild-type.1-b IC50 values were obtained following 7-day exposures from full dose-response curves and represent the mean ± S.E. of at least two separate experiments involving duplicate samples from replicate cultures. Open table in a new tab To correlate cytotoxicity results with enzyme properties, the human TS I108A and F225W mutant proteins were evaluated to interpret the effects of the mutations on the catalytic and inhibitor-binding properties of the enzyme. After expression and purification (see “Experimental Procedures”), the mutant enzymes were estimated to be 80–95% homogenous, as determined by densitometric scanning (data not shown). Kinetic studies with I108A demonstrated that this mutation dramatically changes the catalytic properties of human thymidylate synthase (Table II). The I108A variant had a greatly increased K m (30-fold) for CH2H4folate and a slightly elevatedK m (4-fold) for dUMP, and a catalytic efficiency (k cat) of TS I108A mutant that was reduced about 8-fold. These data indicate that Ile-108 is involved in the binding of CH2H4folate, and only two hydrophobic amino acid substitutions, alanine and phenylalanine yielded sufficient TS activity to permit growth of TS-negative cells in normal medium. Moreover, increased K i values of this mutation for the TS-directed inhibitors such as raltitrexed and Thymitaq correlated with the cytotoxicity studies.Table IIKinetic parameters and drug binding affinities for wild-type and mutant human thymidylate synthasesParameterK m(dUMP)K m(CH2H4folate)2-aThe values shown are corrected, as the racemic mixture of this cofactor was used.k catK iRaltitrexedThymitaqBW1843U89FdUMPμms−1nmWild-type3.9131.7138.40.342.6I108A123900.223401502.822F225W2.41082.8875.32325See “Experimental Procedures” for details.2-a The values shown are corrected, as the racemic mixture of this cofactor was used. Open table in a new tab See “Experimental Procedures” for details. In contrast, the kinetic parameters of the F225W mutant were not very different from those of the wild-type human protein. TheK m for dUMP and the k cat were slightly decreased and increased, respectively, while theK m for CH4H2folate was increased 8-fold. By comparison with the I108A variant, inhibition of F225W mutant by raltitrexed or Thymitaq differed slightly from the inhibition of wild-type TS. The K i value of the F225W TS variant for BW1843U89, as expected, was 68-fold greater than the K i for wild-type enzyme. This was reflected in the cell toxicity studies, where cells transfected with F225W were 17-fold more resistant to this compound than the wild-type TS transfected cells. Transduction of mouse marrow cells with the I108A mutant cDNA resulted in more raltitrexed- or Thymitaq-resistant CFU-GM colonies as compared with mouse marrow cells either untransduced or transduced with wild-type human TS (Table III). HPP-CFC colonies, which represent growth of early progenitors, were also detected in marrow transduced with the I108A mutant, but not in untransduced cells or cells transduced with wild-type human TS, when marrow was incubated with 10−8m raltitrexed or 10−7m Thymitaq.Table IIIResistance to raltitrexed (ZD1694) and Thymitaq (AG337) in mouse marrow CFU-GM colonies and HPP-CFC colonies of the transfection with plasmids containing wild-type TS and I108A mutantBone marrow cell expressed with3-aDOTAP-mediated gene transfer of wild-type or mutant TS into mouse marrow cells is described under “Experimental Procedures.”No drugCFU-GM AssayHPP-CFC assayRaltitrexedThymitaqRaltitrexed 1 × 10−8mThymitaq 1 × 10−7m2 × 10−8m1 × 10−8m2 × 10−7m1 × 10−7mNo DNA823-bNumber of colonies formed in thymidine phosphorylase-treated serum.014 (17%)3-cThe percentage of resistant colonies was calculated by dividing the drug-resistant colonies number with the colonies number in the absence of drug.010 (12%)00wt TS108028 (26%)020 (19%)00I108A TS14414 (10%)64 (44%)12 (8%)60 (42%)9 (6%)8 (6%)3-a DOTAP-mediated gene transfer of wild-type or mutant TS into mouse marrow cells is described under “Experimental Procedures.”3-b Number of colonies formed in thymidine phosphorylase-treated serum.3-c The percentage of resistant colonies was calculated by dividing the drug-resistant colonies number with the colonies number in the absence of drug. Open table in a new tab Ile-108, as a highly conserved amino acid residue, shows flexibility of its side chain when antifolates occupy the folate-binding site. When TS inhibitors such as Thymitaq were designed by molecular modeling, it was predicted that the side chain of Ile-108 would move toward the distal phenyl ring of Thymitaq to make the desired nonpolar interaction, resulting in the calculated minimum-energy conformation. This movement and modeled interaction were subsequently observed by crystal structure studies, which also demonstrated that Thymitaq binds to the active site in a similar orientation as the cofactor (24Appelt K. et al.J. Med. Chem. 1991; 34: 1925-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 26Reich S.H. Fuhry M.A.M. Pino M.J. Welsh K.M. Webber S. Janson C.A. Jordan S.R. Matthews D.A. Smith W.W. Bartlott C.A.

The shift of the Ile-108 side chain upon Thymitaq binding suggested that the spatial relationship of Ile-108 to bound Thymitaq may be little different with other antifolates due to the changed molecular structure of inhibitor. We postulated that some mutations at position 108 would greatly affect the binding of cofactor and inhibitors (raltitrexed, Thymitaq, and BW1843U89) that occupy the cofactor-binding site. The first two mutations we decided to make at this position were Phe and Ala substitutions. Because alanine has a fixed side chain, which is smaller than isoleucine, it may not reach the phenyl ring of Thymitaq. Loss or weakening of these interactions in the variants must also reduce the binding energy, leading to dramatic changes of affinity of Thymitaq to TS. In the case of phenylalanine, another non-polar amino acid with less flexibility, we expected that if the stacking of phenyl-phenyl rings between inhibitor and altered human TS is impaired, TS will adopt a new conformation by reorientation of amino acid residues, thus causing a large change in enzyme behavior. The results of cytotoxicity assays confirmed that when Ile-108 was replaced by residues with a smaller side chain (Ala), the binding of raltitrexed and Thymitaq was weakened, leading to respective IC50 values 56- and 80-fold greater than the IC50 value of wild-type human TS. On other hand, the increase in the IC50 value of BW1843U89 was relatively less (6-fold), which suggests that the large molecular structure of BW1843U89 may retain contact with the side chain of alanine. Moreover, since Ile-108 is not one of the residues in the nucleotide binding pocket, the I108A mutant did not affect FdUMP binding as much as it did raltitrexed and Thymitaq binding. In contrast, little effects on catalysis and inhibitor binding were observed for the I108F mutant (data not shown). This variant behaved the same as wild-type TS, suggesting that this side chain hydrophobic substitution did not change the spatial interaction between enzyme, cofactor, or inhibitors. In order to further study the role of Ile-108 on cofactor and antifolate binding, we replaced this residue by Asn (a polar amino acid), Glu (an acidic amino acid), and Gly (a non-polar amino acid without a side chain). None of these three mutant enzymes allowed growth of mouse TS-deficient cells in the absence of thymidine, indicating that these changes greatly decreased the catalytic efficiency of human TS. The drastic differences in folate binding and catalytic activity among these five variants indicate that position 108 is quite sensitive to mutagenesis and plays a critical role in folate binding. I108A mutation confers significant Thymitaq and raltitrexed resistance. This is due to its distinctive effects on binding affinity among the three antifolates and different properties on catalysis as compared with the other four mutants (Phe, Gly, Asn, and Glu). We hypothesize that the changes in the side chain due to this mutation may cause the loss of hydrophobic interactions between I108A and the phenyl ring of raltitrexed and Thymitaq, resulting in reduced binding affinity of these molecules. Phe-225 was also targeted for site-directed mutagenesis. Based on the crystal structure of TS, this position contributes the major hydrophobic force on binding the PABA moiety of CH2H4folate, and undergoes a dramatic side chain shift to accommodate different ligands upon ternary complex formation. For example, the orientation of the phenyl group of Phe-225 toward CB3717 and H2folate is changed on binding to these ligands (10Matthews D.A. Appelt K. Oatley S.J. Xuong N.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 214: 923-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 14Fauman E.B. Rutenber E.E. Maley G.F. Maley F. Stroud R.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1502-1511Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The aromatic ring of Phe-225 stacks against the propargyl group of CB3717, which could be important for the stability of CB3717 binding to TS. However, this specific interaction and Phe-225 side chain is rotated away when H2folate replaces CB3717, resulting in weaker and more expansive van der Waals contacts to allow H2folate to dissociate from TS (14Fauman E.B. Rutenber E.E. Maley G.F. Maley F. Stroud R.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1502-1511Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). These observations indicate that when TS forms a complex with either CH2H4folate, H2folate, CB3717, raltitrexed, or Thymitaq, which all have a pterin or quinazoline ring, the mobile phenyl group of Phe-225 has enough space to accommodate the above ligands by different hydrophobic interactions and it is not necessary to form aromatic-aromatic non-polar interaction by face-to-face interactions between Phe-225 and the folate molecule. BW1843U89 binds differently, as a consequence of an expanded benzoquinazoline ring, and results in reorientation of the Phe-225 phenyl ring (a 90° turn, relative to the orientations found in the CB3717 and H2folate complexes) to form an idealized aromatic π stacking with the isoindolinyl ring of BW1843U89 (18Weichsel A. Montfort W.R. Nature Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 1095-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The structural information indicates that the interactions of Phe-225 with the folate cofactor and various antifolates appear to be quite different. We therefore replaced Phe-225 by tryptophan, tyrosine, leucine, or serine. The results of transfection of mouse TS-negative cells demonstrated that this highly conserved residue could be substituted by Trp, Leu, and Tyr but not by Ser. Also, the TS-negative mouse cells containing F225S and F225L mutant enzymes did not show drastic changes in inhibition by three antifolates (raltitrexed, Thymitaq, and BW1843U89) or FdUrd as compared with wild-type TS. In contrast, although F225W conferred resistance to BW1843U89 and FdUrd, with increased IC50 values of 17- and 8-fold, respectively, resistance was not encountered with raltitrexed or Thymitaq. Thus, the replacement of Phe-225 by the above amino acids had very different effects on enzyme activity and binding affinity of these inhibitors. The F225S mutant exhibited severely diminished TS catalytic activity, presumably because the hydroxyl side chain of serine decreased the hydrophobic interaction between TS and the PABA moiety of folate. Substitutions with tyrosine, an aromatic amino acid also containing a hydroxyl moiety, retained TS function. The aromatic group of Tyr may contribute hydrophobic contacts to folate compounds, which outweigh the negative binding factors caused by the hydroxyl polar group. The F225W mutant but not the F225L mutant was resistant to BW1843U89. We postulate that substitution of tryptophan for phenylalanine may result in steric hindrance between the tryptophan side chain and the isoindolinyl ring of BW1843U89. The two bulk groups may impair the original aromatic π stacking between phenylalanine side chain and the PABA ring of cofactor, which account for the loss of binding energy for BW1843U89 to TS F225W mutant. As shown in earlier equilibrium dialysis studies, folate and dUMP derivatives enhance each others binding (40Galivan J.H. Maley G.F. Maley F. Biochemistry. 1975; 15: 356-362Crossref Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 41Galivan J.H. Maley F. Baugh C.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1976; 71: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This effect is even more dramatically shown in the effect that BW1843U89 has on the binding of dUMP and even dGMP (GMP) where the stacking energy between the benzoquinazoline ring of BW1843U89 and TS, and also indicated nucleotides greatly enhances their binding (42Weichsel A. Montfort W.R. Ciesla J. Maley F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3493-3497Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Any mutation that impairs the binding of folate analogues would naturally impair the binding of dUMP or FdUMP and would thus explain the resistance of the indicated cell lines containing I108A and F225W to both BW1843U89 and FdUMP. In the recently determined crystal structure of the human TS, Leu-221, an almost invariant residue in all reported TS sequences, was shown to be one of the residues involved in hydrophobic contacts with the folate cofactor or inhibitors (4Carreras C.W. Santi D.V. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 721-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). We introduced five mutations (phenylalanine, alanine, isoleucine, serine, or arginine) at position 221 of the human TS. Mouse TS-negative cells were rescued by transfection of these cDNA's with Ala, Ile, and Ser variants but not Phe and Arg variants. The loss of TS function of the positively changed Arg variant may be explained by the loss of hydrophobic interactions. Substitution with phenylalanine, a hydrophobic amino acid, because of its bulky side chain (Phe, 142 Å3 and Leu, 107 Å3) (43Nakano T. Spencer H.T. Appleman J.R. Blakley R.L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9945-9952Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), may explain the lack of TS complementation by the L221F variant. However, when the volume of the non-polar side chain was unchanged (by Ile substitution) or smaller (by Ala substitution) and hydroxyl group added (by Ser substitution), these mutations resulted in catalytically active TS. The L221A, L221I, and L221S variants of human TS also did not show significant differences in inhibitor binding as measured by inhibition of cell growth. Leu-221, unlike Phe-225 and Ile-108, may therefore marginally reorient when cofactor or inhibitors having different molecular structures bind to TS. In summary, we have generated novel human TS mutants that confer antifolate resistance, and provide evidence that raltitrexed, Thymitaq, and BW1843U89 bind differently to TS. Further x-ray crystallographic studies of these mutants (I108A and F225W) may provide more detailed information to answer the questions of how the mutated residues participate in inhibitor binding or interfere with inhibitor binding through steric hindrance (for F225W) and the loss of hydrophobic interaction (for I108A). Information on the difference between wild-type and mutant human TS structures may also be of value in the design of new TS inhibitors with desirable properties. Data presented using DOTAP transduction of mouse marrow cells with the I108A mutant cDNA, encourage the further development of this mutant incorporated into retroviral constructs, to protect hematopoietic progenitor cells from toxic effects of the TS inhibitor raltitrexed (44Banerjee D.

The activity of the deletion proteins revealed that domains IIA and IIB can be provided by different subunits in the transposase tetramer.

The transposase of bacteriophage Mu (MuA) is one of the best characterized members of the transposase/integrase family. MuA promotes two chemical steps during recombination: 1) donor DNA cleavage, which is the endonucleolytic cleavage of the phosphodiester bond between the element and the flanking host DNA, and 2) DNA strand transfer, the coupled DNA cleavage and joining reaction that covalently links the 3′ ends of the element DNA to the DNA at the target site (5Rice P.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7532-7541Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Domain IIIA also binds DNA and has a cryptic nuclease activity implicated in catalysis of DNA cleavage (16Wu Z. Chaconas G. EMBO J. 1996; 14: 3835-3843Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Domain II, also known as the catalytic core domain, participates directly in both cleavage and strand transfer (see below). The extreme NH2- and COOH-terminal subdomains of transposase regulate the protein's activity. Domain IA is a winged-helix-turn-helix domain that binds the enhancer-like DNA element (the IAS); this interaction is normally required during transpososome assembly but can be dispensed with under certain in vitro conditions (17Clubb R.T.

The carboxyl-terminal subdomain (IIIB) interacts with the activator protein, MuB (19Baker T.A. Mizuuchi M. Mizuuchi K.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 935-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of domain II of MuA revealed two subdomains, referred to as IIA and IIB. The overall topology of domain IIA (residues 258–490) can be superimposed on the structure of the core domain of HIV1-1 integrase (27Rice P. Mizuuchi K. Cell. 1995; 82: 209-220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). This region of MuA contains the phylogenetically conserved catalytic triad of acidic amino acids known as the Asp-Asp-Glu motif (27Rice P. Mizuuchi K. Cell. 1995; 82: 209-220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 28Baker T.A. Luo L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6654-6658Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). These acidic residues are implicated in coordinating divalent metal ions required for catalysis (29Yang W. Steitz T.A. Structure (Lond.). 1995; 3: 131-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 30Kulkosky J. Jones K.S. Katz R.A. Mack J.P. Skalka A.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2331-2338Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). Domain IIB, which extends from amino acid 490 to amino acid 560, has a β-barrel structure with a large positively exposed patch on one side; this region has been suggested to be responsible for the nonspecific DNA binding activity of domain II (27Rice P. Mizuuchi K. Cell. 1995; 82: 209-220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The function of domain IIB in transposition is unknown. This paper extends our understanding of the functional organization of the MuA. We demonstrate that, consistent with the structural predictions, aspartate 336 in domain IIA is required for catalysis of cleavage and strand transfer. This residue corresponds to the second aspartate of the Asp-Asp-Glu motif of other transposases and the retroviral integrases. In contrast, mutations at several other conserved positions in domain IIA do not dramatically affect the catalytic activity of the protein, although two residues involved in contacts between domain IIA and IIB appear important for protein folding or function. Furthermore, we find that domains IIA and IIB can be provided by different subunits in the active transposase tetramer and suggest that domain IIB contacts and manipulates the DNA duplex near the cleavage site during recombination. The target DNA was φX174 RFI (Life Technologies, Inc.). The circular donor DNA was pSG1 or pMK586 (10Mizuuchi M. Baker T.A. Mizuuchi K. Cell. 1992; 70: 303-311Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 28Baker T.A. Luo L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6654-6658Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The precleaved donor DNA was made by linearization of pKN37 (identical to pMK426 between the two Mu DNA ends) with HindIII as described previously (7Craigie R. Mizuuchi K. Cell. 1987; 51: 493-501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Synthetic fragments for donor DNAs were synthesized by MIT Biopolymer Laboratory and labeled on the 5′ end with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. The oligonucleotides contained slightly modified versions of the natural R1 and R2 sequences of Mu DNA (see Fig. 7 and Ref. 12Aldaz H. Schuster E. Baker T.A. Cell. 1996; 85: 257-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). MuB protein used in Fig. 2 was purified as described by Chaconas et al. (31Chaconas G. Gloor G. Miller J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 2662-2669Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with the additional step described by Adzuma and Mizuuchi (32Adzuma K. Mizuuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6159-6167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to remove aggregated protein. In the remaining experiments, MuB was the His-tagged version and was purified as described (21Levchenko I. Yamauchi M. Baker T.A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1561-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). HU protein was purified from the overproducing strain of R. McMacken (Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD) by the method of Dixon and Kornberg (33Dixon N.E. Kornberg A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 424-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) with the additional step of Mono S chromatography in 20 mmNaPO4 (pH 4.8), eluted with a gradient of 0–500 mm NaCl. MuA proteins (wild-type, D269N/E392Q, D269N, E392Q, D336N, MuA1-574, MuA1-562, MuA1-527, and MuA1-490 deletion mutants) were purified as described (19Baker T.A. Mizuuchi M. Mizuuchi K. Cell. 1991; 74: 723-733Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (97) Google Scholar). KK/AA mutants were purified with the additional step of Mono S chromatography with a linear gradient from 300 to 600 mm NaCl. MuA crude extract assays (Fig. 3 B) contained 1 μl of fraction prepared as described (35Savilahti H. Rice P.A. Mizuuchi K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4893-4903Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The protein concentration of MuA preparations were determined either spectrophotometrically with the value of A 280 = 1.58 for 1 mg/ml or by quantitating the intensity of Coomassie Blue-stained bands after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, in comparison with MuA standards of known concentration.Figure 3Strand transfer activity of Domain II mutants.

Luo L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6654-6658Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) or using the Chameleon double-stranded mutagenesis kit as recommended by the supplier (Stratagene). The mutated genes were cloned into pET-3a (pMK591), and the sequence was confirmed by sequencing. The standard reaction conditions were essentially as described previously (34Craigie R. Arndt-Jovin D.J. Mizuuchi K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 7570-7574Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures contained 25 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8 at room temperature), 156 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 15% glycerol, 10 μg/ml of donor DNA, and 10 μg/ml of φX174 RFI. The protein levels in 25-μl reactions were as follows: MuB, 6.5 pmol; HU, 3.0 pmol; and MuA between 0.13 and 3.0 pmol, with the level being 1.3 pmol, unless otherwise stated (see figure legends). Proteins were prepared by dilution of concentrated stock solutions in storage/dilution buffer described previously (19Baker T.A. Mizuuchi M. Mizuuchi K. Cell. 1991; 74: 723-733Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Reactions using donor DNA fragments were done as described (35Savilahti H. Rice P.A. Mizuuchi K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4893-4903Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), contained 1 pmol of γ-32P-labeled fragment carrying the Mu end sequences, and lacked HU protein. MuB and Me2SO (15%) were added as noted in the figure legends. The reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 20 to 60 min (or as described in the figure legends) stopped by the addition of 0.2 volume of a stop solution (0.1% bromphenol blue, 2.5% SDS, 50 mm EDTA, 25% glycerol), and portions of the samples were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 0.9% high gelling temperature-agarose gel with a constant circulation of the buffer (1 × TAB: 40 mmTris acetate at pH 7.8, 5 mm sodium acetate, 1 mm EDTA). Reactions using oligonucleotide substrates were further analyzed as follows: gels were dried to filter paper, exposed on a Phosphor cassette (Molecular Dynamics), and scanned with a Molecular Dynamics BP445si. The cleavage products were analyzed on a denaturing 8% acrylamide gel; gels were dried and exposed in a Phosphor exposure cassette. Images were analyzed using ImagequaNT, v4.2 software (Molecular Dynamics). Site-directed mutagenesis and biochemical analysis of the mutated proteins established that Asp269 and Glu392 of MuA are required for catalysis of both donor DNA cleavage and DNA strand transfer (28Baker T.A. Luo L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6654-6658Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 36Kim K. Namgoog S.Y. Jayaram M. Harshey R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1472-1479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). These results, combined with amino acid sequence alignments, indicated that these residues were analogs of the first aspartate and the glutamate of the Asp-Asp-35-Glu motif first described for the retroviral integrases (30Kulkosky J. Jones K.S. Katz R.A. Mack J.P. Skalka A.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2331-2338Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). However, sequence alignments failed to reveal an aspartate properly spaced to be “the middle Asp,” which is almost always positioned 34 or 35 residues NH2-terminal of the glutamate (Glu). Although located 55, rather than 35, residues NH2-terminal of Glu392, the sequence immediately neighboring Asp336 has some similarity to sequences neighboring the middle Asp in other transposases (Fig. 1 B). Furthermore, the structure of domain II reveals that this residue is also located in a position similar to that of the second conserved aspartate in the retroviral integrase structures (27Rice P. Mizuuchi K. Cell. 1995; 82: 209-220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The D336N substitution mutation was therefore constructed, and the protein purified and assayed for its ability to promote the individual steps of transposition. The D336N mutant protein was defective in both cleavage and strand transfer. When assayed with a supercoiled mini-Mu plasmid as the donor DNA substrate, D336N had no detectable cleavage activity (Fig. 2, lane 3). Precleaved donor DNA was used to assay for the strand transfer step, independent of cleavage; D336N also had no detectable strand transfer activity (lane 6). More sensitive cleavage and strand transfer assays using radiolabeled DNAs confirmed that proteins carrying the D336N substitution had a profound defect in both chemical steps. 2T. L. Williams and T. A. Baker, manuscript in preparation. To assess whether D336N was specifically defective in catalysis, or whether its function was blocked at an earlier step, several tests were performed. Gel mobility shift assays and protein-protein cross-linking experiments confirmed that D336N retained specific DNA binding activity and assembled into tetramers (data not shown). Furthermore, when wild-type MuA and D336N were mixed, the presence of D336N reduced the amount of strand transfer products generated by wild-type MuA (Fig. 2,lane 7). Virtually all of these strand transfer products had only one of the two ends of the Mu DNA joined to the target DNA, a product that is only rarely formed by the wild-type protein. The presence of this single-ended strand transfer product indicated that D336N assembles with MuA to form mixed tetramers and that the presence of D336N in this complex blocks catalysis of strand transfer. Therefore, we conclude that the D336N derivative of MuA is specifically defective in catalysis of both the donor DNA cleavage and strand transfer steps in transposition, as has been shown previously for the D269N and E392Q mutant proteins (28Baker T.A. Luo L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6654-6658Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In contrast to the inhibitory effect of substitutions at Asp269, Asp336, and Glu392, alterations at several other acidic amino acids in domain IIA did not have a large impact on MuA activity. Four other acidic amino acids within this domain were altered by the following substitutions: D306N, E309Q, D312N, and D320A (Asp294 has been mutated previously (28Baker T.A. Luo L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6654-6658Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar)). The proteins were overexpressed, and their ability to catalyze the individual steps in transposition was assayed using crude extracts. Strand transfer of radiolabeled, precleaved fragments that are analogs of the right end of the Mu genome (Fig. 3 A) was a very sensitive assay for transposase function; the results of this strand transfer assay with the mutant proteins is shown in Fig. 3 B. The D306N, E309Q, and D312N proteins clearly retained strand transfer activity (Fig. 3 B, lanes 7-9). In contrast, the D320A mutant protein was inactive (lane 13). Inspection of the position of this residue in the structure of domain II revealed that it is involved in a contact between domains IIA and IIB. The R534A mutant protein was also inactive (lane 6), and this residue is likewise involved in a domain IIA-IIB contact. Alteration of a neighboring hydrophobic residue by the V532A mutation did not have such a severe consequence (lane 5). The D320A and R534A proteins were not further characterized, although analysis of the extracts confirmed that they were expressed and present in the cell extract (data not shown). Three additional mutant proteins carrying the changes N267A, K373T, and K373A were constructed and analyzed. Asn267 is two amino acids NH2-terminal of the first catalytic aspartate and has the potential to interact with the active-site residues. However, alanine substitution at this position had little effect on transposase activity (Fig. 3 B, lane 10). Lys373is a surface exposed lysine and is the only residue other than the two active site aspartates that is present in an analogous position in MuA, HIV integrase, and RNaseH (see Fig. 1 B and Ref. 27Rice P. Mizuuchi K. Cell. 1995; 82: 209-220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Whereas the Lys to Thr substitution was inactive in the crude extracts (lane 12), the Lys to Ala mutant protein was clearly active (lane 11). The K373A protein was purified to near homogeneity and further characterized; its cleavage and strand transfer activities were similar to wild-type MuA (data not shown). Domain II of MuA consists of two subdomains: residues 258–490 form a mixed α/β domain, which contains the Asp-Asp-Glu motif residues, and residues 491–560 form a small β-barrel (Fig. 4). To address whether domains IIA and IIB can function independently, we constructed a series of carboxyl-terminal truncations; the truncated proteins are referred to as MuA1-562, MuA1-527, and MuA1-490, with the last number being the final residue present in the deletion protein. MuA1-527 is missing about half of domain IIB (and inspection of the structure suggests it is unlikely that the remaining portion will be well folded), and the entire domain is missing from MuA1-490. The deletion proteins were overexpressed and purified. All three proteins bound specifically to Mu end DNA (data not shown), suggesting that at least domain I adopts a native tertiary structure in these deletion proteins. MuA1-562 and MuA1-527 had solubility properties similar to full-length MuA. MuA1-490 was considerably less soluble and lost activity during storage. As expected from the previous characterization of MuA1-574, which is missing domain III (19Baker T.A. Mizuuchi M. Mizuuchi K. Cell. 1991; 74: 723-733Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (97) Google Scholar), none of the deletion proteins had cleavage or strand transfer activity when assayed alone (Fig. 5, A and B, lanes 3–5). Furthermore, all three deletion proteins, like MuA1-574, were unable to assemble into homotetramers (data not shown). However, when assayed in the presence of a full-length but defective MuA derivative carrying substitution mutations at two of the Asp-Asp-Glu-motif residues (D269N/E392Q, referred to as DE/NQ), the protein mixtures were active. The ability of the protein mixtures to support cleavage was assayed by observing the appearance of cleaved donor complexes (CDCs) after agarose gel electrophoresis. Cleaved donor complexes (also known as type I complexes) are formed when a MuA tetramer cleaves the donor plasmid and remains bound to the product DNA. MuA1-562 supported CDC formation when mixed with DE/NQ as well as did MuA1-574 (Fig. 5A, lanes 7 and 8). MuA1-527 and MuA1-490 were less active (lanes 9 and 10), but reproducibly supported cleavage in these in vitrocomplementation experiments. The presence of both proteins in the CDCs was confirmed by Western blotting of the protein recovered after isolating the complexes from an agarose gel (data not shown). Each of the deletion proteins also contributed to MuA tetramers that promoted strand transfer when mixed with DE/NQ, as revealed by the ability of the protein mixtures to join labeled precleaved Mu end fragments into target DNA (Fig. 5 B, lanes 8–10). Thus, the deletion proteins lacking domains III and IIB can provide the active site residues in domain IIA for catalysis of either cleavage or strand transfer. These data suggest that, within a tetramer containing four wild-type subunits, the important functions of domains IIA and IIB may be provided by different subunits in the active complex. An electrostatic map of the structure of domain II shows a large, positively charged region on one face of domain IIB (27Rice P. Mizuuchi K. Cell. 1995; 82: 209-220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Because the site-specific DNA binding determinants that interact with the Mu DNA are contributed by domain I, and domain II has nonspecific DNA binding activity (37Nakayama C. Teplow D.B. Harshey R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1809-1813Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), it has been proposed that domain IIB might interact with the DNA surrounding the cleavage site or the target DNA (27Rice P. Mizuuchi K. Cell. 1995; 82: 209-220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). To study the role of the charged surface of domain IIB in transposition, four surface-exposed lysines were mutated to alanine. Two mutant proteins, each with two substitutions, K506A/K515A (called KK/AA1) and K529A/K530A (called KK/AA2), were constructed and characterized in vitro (see Fig. 4 for location of mutated residues in the structure). When assayed on supercoiled donor DNA, either in the presence (Fig. 6,top) or absence (Fig. 6, bottom) of target DNA, both mutant proteins efficiently promoted donor DNA cleavage (lanes 5 and 8). Both proteins also formed stable CDCs (data not shown). Thus, under standard reaction conditions, disrupting the positively charged region of domain IIB does not appear to inhibit transpososome assembly or DNA cleavage. In contrast to their wild-type cleavage activity, neither KK/AA mutant protein promoted efficient strand transfer on its own. During Mu transposition, two classes of strand transfer products are commonly formed: intramolecular strand transfer products (STPintra) result when MuA uses a target site on the same donor plasmid that it has cleaved; intermolecular(STPinter) strand transfer products result when MuA attacks a second target plasmid during strand transfer. Intramolecular products can be formed by MuA unassisted, whereas intermolecular recombination requires the target DNA delivery functions provided by MuB protein (23Maxwell A. Craigie R. Mizuuchi K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 699-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In contrast to wild-type MuA (lane 2), the KK/AA1 mutant protein produced only a trace of intramolecular STP (lane 5), and no detectable products where formed by KK/AA2 (lane 8). This intramolecular strand transfer defect was efficiently suppressed by the addition of"

Depending on conditions of the assay used, the mutants displayed increased activity of the corresponding activated protein C (APC) derivatives. The degree of enhanced activity (up to 10-fold) was dependent on the concentration of phospholipid and quality of phospholipid (± phosphatidylethanolamine) used in the assay. This was expected, because APC is active in its membrane-associated form, which can be regulated by changes in either the protein or phospholipid. As expected, the largest impact of the mutants occurred at low phospholipid concentration and in the absence of phosphatidylethanolamine. The anticoagulant activity of all proteins was stimulated by protein S, with the greatest impact on the enhanced mutants.

Human protein C, an important inhibitor of blood coagulation (1Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4743-4746Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), requires vitamin K for the formation of nine γ-carboxyglutamic acids (Gla)1 in its amino-terminal 45 residues (the Gla domain). This domain contains the membrane contact site, which is critical to activated protein C function in proteolysis of factors Va and VIIIa. Activity is expressed upon protein associations on a membrane surface. Despite a high degree of sequence homology, protein C and six other vitamin K-dependent proteins display a large range of membrane affinities (2McDonald J.F. Shah A.M. Schwalbe R.A. Kisiel W.

In addition to variations in membrane affinity at saturating calcium (step 3 of Equation 1), members of the vitamin K-dependent protein family have different affinities for calcium (step 1 of Equation 1(3Nelsestuen G.L. Fed. Proc. 1978; 37: 2621-2625PubMed Google Scholar)), making it possible to enhance protein from this stand point as well. In fact, it may be possible to find mutants that influence protein-calcium binding (step 1 of Equation 1) or membrane association at saturating calcium levels (step 3 of Equation 1), without influencing the other step. Such mutants would help identify the membrane contact region of the Gla domain and distinguish it from calcium binding to the free protein. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using a PCR method as described previously (4Shen L. Shah A.M. Dahlbäck B. Nelsestuen G.L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 16025-16031Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The following oligonucleotides were synthesized: A, 5′-AAA TTA ATA CGA CTC ACT ATA GGG AGA CCC AAG CTT-3′ (corresponding to sense nucleotides 860–895 in the vector pRc/CMV, including the HindIII cloning site); B, 5′-GCA TTT AGG TGA CAC TAT AGA ATA GGG CCC TCT AGA-3′ (antisense to nucleotides 984–1019 in the vector pRc/CMV including theXbaI cloning site). The mutagenesis primers were as follows: C, 5′-CAG TGT GTC ATC CAC ATC TTC GAA AAT TTC CTT GGC-3′ (antisense for amino acids 27–38, with the E32D33 mutation underlined); D, 5′-GCC AAG GAA ATT TTC GAA GAT GTG GAT GAC ACA CTG-3′ (complementary to primer C); E, 5′-CAG TGT GTC ATC CAC ATTTTC GAA AAT TTC CTT GGC-3 (antisense to residues 38–27, with the Q32E mutation underlined); F, 5′-GCC AAG GAA ATT TTCGAA AAT GTG GAT GAC ACA CTG-3′ (complementary to primer E); G, 5′-GCA CTC CCG CTC CAG GCT CCC GTG ACG GAG CTC CTC CAG GAA-3′ (antisense to amino acids 4–17, with the S11G mutation underlined); H, 5′-GCA CTC CCG CTC CAG GCT CCC CTC ACG GAG CTC CTC CAG GAA-3′ (antisense to amino acids 4–17, with the H10E/S11G mutation underlined); I, 5′-GCA CTC CCG CTC CAG GCT CCC TTGACG GAG CTC CTC CAG GAA-3′ (antisense to amino acids 4–17, with the H10Q/S11G mutation underlined); J, 5′-GCA CTC CCG CTC CAG GTT CCC GTG ACG GAG CTC CTC CAG GAA-3′ (antisense to amino acids 4–17, with the S11G/S12N mutation underlined). Full-length human protein C cDNA was cloned in the pRc/CMV vector using HindIII and XbaI sites. PCR amplification and mutagenesis of the target DNA was performed by the following steps: primers A and C were used to amplify the 5′ part of protein C (up to the codon for the amino acid at position 38), whereas primers B and D were used to amplify the 3′ part (from the amino acid 27 codon to the end of the protein C cDNA). These two fragments were used as templates to amplify the full-length E32D33 mutant protein C cDNA with primers A and B. HC-E32 was obtained in a similar way, but with primers E and F instead of primers C and D. PCR products were cleaved with HindIII and SalI, and theHindIII-SalI fragment was isolated and ligated together with a SalI-XbaI fragment from protein C cDNA into HindIII and XbaI cleaved pRc/CMV vector. To prepare the four mutants, G11E32D33, E10G11E32D33, Q10G11E32D33 and G11N12E32D33, first human protein C cDNA was used as template for the PCR amplification to prepare mutant G11 (using primers A and G), E10G11 (using primers A and H), Q10G11 (using primers A and I), and G11N12 (using primers A and J). The PCR products were digested byHindIII (at the 5′ of human protein C cDNA) and BsrBI (located in the primer nucleotide sequence at codons for amino acids Ser-14 and Gly-15). These fragments were ligated to a protein C fragment (BsrBI-XbaI, around 1200 base pairs) containing the E32D33 mutation to obtain the full-length hC-G11E32D33 and hC-E10G11E32D33 mutants. All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing before transfection. Cell culture in human 293 cells, expression, purification, and quantitation of protein C molecules were performed as described (4Shen L. Shah A.M. Dahlbäck B. Nelsestuen G.L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 16025-16031Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Quantitation of Gla was conducted by amino acid analysis as described (5Shah A.M. Kisiel W. Foster D.C. Nelsestuen G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4229-4234Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). 4-Dimethylaminoazobenzene-4-sulfonyl-Gla and 4-dimethylaminoazobenzene-4-sulfonyl-Asp eluted at 13.5 and 16.5 min, respectively. Gla content was determined from a ratio to Asp in the analysis, assuming 42 Asp or Asn per protein. Gla content (average and range of 2–4 determinations) was 8.7 ± 0.1 for hC-wild type, 9.6 ± 0.1 for hC-E32, 10.3 ± 0.5 for hC-E32D33, 10.5 ± 0.5 for hC-G11E32D33, and 11.6 ± 0.4 for hC-E10G11E32D33. Theoretical values for full carboxylation of Glu within residues 1–44 of these proteins are: 9 for hC-wild type; 10 for hC-E32, hC-E32D33, and hC-G11E32D33; and 11 for hC-E10G11E32D33 (sequences summarized in Ref. 2McDonald J.F. Shah A.M. Schwalbe R.A. Kisiel W. Dahlbäck B. Nelsestuen G.L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5120-5127Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Recombinant proteins (≥100 μg) were analyzed by high resolution ion exchange chromatography as described previously (5Shah A.M. Kisiel W. Foster D.C. Nelsestuen G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4229-4234Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). All proteins showed a single primary peak, without indication of heterogeneity. Elution time varied by approximately 0.6 min per charged group, with a standard deviation of 0.1 min. For example, wild type human protein C and the hC-P10 mutant (4Shen L. Shah A.M. Dahlbäck B. Nelsestuen G.L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 16025-16031Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) eluted at 37.9 min, the hC-E32 mutant at 39.3 min, the hC-E32D33 mutant at 39.9 min, and the hC-E10G11E32D33 mutant at 40.8 min. High resolution ion exchange chromatography of chymotrypsin digests of the proteins also gave a single component from the Gla domain, suggesting full carboxylation of Glu residues in positions 1–41. Approximately 0.1 mg of protein C (1 g/liter) was mixed with human thrombin (3 μg) (Sigma) and incubated at 37 °C for 3 h in standard buffer (0.05 m Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1 m NaCl). The reaction product was diluted with an equal volume of water and applied to a 1-ml column of SP-Sephadex C-50. The column was washed with standard buffer, and the flow-through was pooled as activated protein C (APC). APC activity was determined by hydrolysis of 0.1 mm S2366 (l-pyroglutamyl-l-prolyl-l-arginine-p-nitroaniline hydrochloride) and gave a constant activity per mg of protein for all preparations (±10%). Concentrations were normalized to S2366 activity. Coagulation was measured with APTT reagent (Sigma) (0.05 ml of APTT reagent that was diluted 1:10 or 1:100 with standard buffer containing 0.1 mm ellagic acid) or diluted TP (Sigma) (0.1 ml of TP-high sensitivity that had been diluted 1:100 with standard buffer containing 0.01 mCaCl2). The total volume of assays was 0.2 ml. For APTT assays, 0.05 ml of plasma, 0.05 ml of APC and/or protein S solution, and APTT reagent were incubated at 37 °C for 3 min. Coagulation was initiated with 0.05 ml of standard buffer containing 0.025m CaCl2. For TP assays, plasma, APC, and/or protein S solution were incubated at 37 °C for 3 min, and clotting was started with diluted TP. Time to form a clot was determined by a manual method. Clotting times were reported as the average and range of two determinations. Plasma samples used were human plasma (Sigma), protein S-deficient plasma (American Diagnostica, Greenwich, CT), and heterozygous and homozygous Factor V:R506Q plasma (generously provided by Dr. Nigel Key, Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota Medical School). A one-stage coagulation assay was carried out using bovine factor Xa. Buffer (total volume of 112.5 μl, containing 6.7 mmCaCl2) was mixed with factor Xa, sufficient to give a clotting time of 30 ± 2 s under the conditions of the assay, APC, and phospholipid. The mixture was incubated for 1 min at 37 °C, and coagulation was initiated by addition of 37.5 μl of normal human plasma (at 37 °C). Small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) were prepared by methods described (5Shah A.M. Kisiel W. Foster D.C. Nelsestuen G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4229-4234Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 16Huang C. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 344-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (1307) Google Scholar). Highly pure phospholipids with natural fatty acid distributions included phosphatidylserine (PS, from bovine brain, purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids) and phosphatidylcholine (PC, from egg, purchased from the Sigma) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE, from egg, purchased from Avanti). These were mixed in organic solvent, dried by a stream of argon gas, and suspended in standard buffer (20 mg in 3 ml). SUVs were formed by sonication and gel filtration. Large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) were prepared by extrusion as described by Hope et al. (17Hope M.J. Bally M.G. Webb G. Cullis P.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 812: 55-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (2020) Google Scholar). Phospholipids included PS/PC/PE (natural abundance fatty acids, described above). This PE preparation contained 60% plasmalogen. Alternatively, LUVs were made from 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoserine, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, with and without 1,2-dilinoleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine. All synthetic lipids were from Avanti. Vesicles containing dilinoleoyl-PE were stored under argon and were used within 24 h of preparation. Others were used within 5 days. Sonication of LUVs was carried out essentially as described for preparation of SUVs. Vesicle size was measured by quasi-elastic light scattering with an LSA2 laser light scattering apparatus coupled with a Langley Ford 1096 autocorrelator. Average diameters for SUVs were 35–40 nm, and average diameters for LUVs were 110–120 nm. Phospholipid concentrations were determined by organic phosphate assay assuming a phosphorous:phospholipid weight ratio of 25 (18Chen P.S. Toribara T.Y. Warner H. Anal. Chem. 1956; 28: 1756-1758Crossref Scopus (5837) Google Scholar). Light scattering at 90° to the incident light was used to quantitate protein-membrane binding (19Nelsestuen G.L. Lim T.K. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 4164-4171Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Briefly, the intensity of phospholipid vesicles alone (I 1) and after addition of protein (I 2) were measured. Background from buffer and unbound protein was subtracted. The ratio of the molecular weight of the protein-vesicle complex (M 2) to that of the vesicles alone (M 1) was estimated from the following relationship:I 2/I 1 = (M 2/M 1)2(∂n/∂c2/∂n/∂c 1)2, where ∂n/∂c is the refractive index of the respective species. If phospholipid and protein concentrations are known, the concentration of bound P*PL and free protein P can be estimated. These values, together with the maximum protein binding capacity ([P*PL max]) of the vesicles (assumed to be 1.0 g/g for all proteins) was used to obtain the dissociation constant for protein-membrane interaction from the following relationship: K D = [P][P*PL max −P*PL]/[P*PL], where all values are in molar concentrations of protein or protein binding sites. Equilibrium binding constants are reported as K D values and are primarily valuable for comparisons. Values at 5 mm calcium were calculated at a total protein:phospholipid ratio of 2.0:1.0 (w/w). Values at 2 mm calcium were determined at a total protein:phospholipid ratio of 0.7:1.0 (w/w). Protein binding to LUVs is reported as the light scattering intensity ratio (I 2/I 1). Vesicle size is a significant fraction of the wavelength of light so that nonideal light scattering may occur. However, when all solution parameters, vesicle sizes, and distributions were the same for titrations of two similar proteins, the light scattering intensity ratio provided an indication of relative binding by the two proteins. For several reasons, direct comparison of two proteins by this method is more accurate than absolute binding constants obtained (19Nelsestuen G.L. Lim T.K. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 4164-4171Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The variation of membrane binding constants reported in separate studies (reviewed in Ref. 7Smirnov M.D. Safa O. Regan L. Mather T. Stearns-Kurosawa D.J. Kurosawa S. Rezaie A.R. Esmon N.L. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9031-9040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) may partially reflect these factors. Direct comparisons between proteins in a single study is an important aspect of this study. The bovine proteins factor X (20Fujikawa K. Legaz M.E. Davie E.W. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 4882-4891Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) and prothrombin (21Nelsestuen G.L. Suttie J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 3366-3370Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) were purified by published procedures. Activation of factor X was performed as described (22Pletcher C.H. Nelsestuen G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 1086-1091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Human protein S was generously provided by Dr. Walter Kisiel, Department of Pathology, University of New Mexico. Protein-membrane interaction was measured at two phospholipid compositions. Lower PS content provided better comparison of high affinity proteins (Fig. 1 B), whereas higher PS content gave better evaluation of low affinity proteins (Fig. 1 A). Bovine factor X is included as a standard of comparison. Membrane binding by the hC-E32 mutant was indistinguishable from that of wild type human protein C (Fig. 1), in agreement with earlier reports of a hC-L31E32 mutant (15Zhang L. Castellino F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3590-3595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, further mutation of Ser-11 to Gly (hC-G11E32D33) resulted in substantial improvement (3–7-fold decrease in K D; Table I).Table IProtein binding affinity as a function of [Ca]ProteinK D(PS/PC, 20/80)2 mm Ca1-aDetermined at a protein:phospholipid ratio of 0.70 as described under “Experimental Procedures” (data not shown).

Open table in a new tab Fig. 2 shows the calcium titration of membrane binding by the various proteins. The midpoint of the titration curve for the hC-G11E32D33 mutant was quite similar to that of wild type protein. However, further modifications of H10Q or S12N resulted in lowered calcium requirement. Thus, the relative efficacy of these proteins should differ with the calcium concentration used in the assay. The impact of calcium concentration is illustrated in Table I. For example, the difference between hC-G11E32D33 and hC-Q10G11E32D33 is greater at 2 mm calcium than at 5 mmcalcium. The activity of APC-E32 was similar to that wild type APC in a diluted thromboplastin assay (Fig. 3 A, also see Ref. 13Zhang L. Jhingan A. Castellino F.J. Blood. 1992; 80: 942-952Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This assay showed that APC-G11E32D33 was about 10-fold superior to wild type protein and that the APC-Q10G11E32D33 and APC-G11N12E32D33 mutants had approximately 12-fold higher activity. The relative activity was dependent on the commercial batch of thromboplastin used. Fig. 3 B shows approximately 5.5-fold difference between the APC-G11E32D33 and APC-E323 mutants. In keeping with the slight differences of membrane binding by other mutants, APC-E32D33 was approximately equal to APC-E32 and APC-E10G11E32D33 was approximately equal to APC-G11E32D33 (Fig. 3 B). Plasma containing Factor V:R506Q (heterozygote and homozygote; for review on APC resistance see Ref. 23Dahlbäck B. Thromb. Res. 1995; 77: 1-43Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar) showed resistance to both APC-E32 and APC-G11E32D33 (Fig. 3 B, inset). Nevertheless, APC-G11E32D33 was more effective than APC-E32 in these plasmas. Activity in a diluted APTT was also determined (data not shown). This assay relies on the intrinsic coagulation pathway and therefore utilizes factor VIIIa. APC inhibits both Va and VIIIa, and it was of interest to determine whether a difference was observed for the mutants in these situations. As for the thromboplastin assay, larger differences between APC-G11E32D33 and APC-E32 occurred in diluted APTT reagent and/or at longer coagulation times. There was minimal impact of the mutations when full strength APTT reagent was used. Greatest impact of enhanced membrane affinity at low coagulation stimulus was common to other proteins with improved membrane affinity, including bovine protein C (4Shen L. Shah A.M. Dahlbäck B. Nelsestuen G.L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 16025-16031Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and Factor VII (5Shah A.M. Kisiel W. Foster D.C. Nelsestuen G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4229-4234Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Both coagulation assays were sensitive to protein S but showed somewhat different requirements (Fig. 4). The diluted APTT test showed a midpoint of about 7 nm protein S, whereas the diluted TP assay showed a midpoint at 30–40 nm protein S. In both assays and in the protein S titrations (Fig. 4), APC-G11E32D33 showed continual increase of inhibition at higher protein S concentrations. A difference in APC concentration requirement was also apparent; inhibition in the diluted APTT assay occurred at 0–2 nmAPC but required 0–15 nm APC in the diluted TP reaction (Fig. 3). Phospholipid concentration and composition have an impact on coagulation. Although attention is normally paid to the need for anionic lipids, an interesting effect was observed for neutral phospholipids, PC versus PE. The presence of PE in the membrane has a large synergistic impact on function of PS for membrane binding by vitamin K-dependent proteins (24Nelsestuen G.L. Broderius M. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 4172-4177Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Similar effects were seen for diverse proteins such as protein kinase C, annexins (25Bazzi M.D. Youakim M.A. Nelsestuen G.L. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1125-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), pentraxins (26Plager D.P. Nelsestuen G.L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13239-13249Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate (27Kim J. Shishido T. Jiang X. Aderem A. McLaughlin S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28214-28219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and blood clotting factor VIII (28Gilbert G.E. Arena A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18500-18505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Enhanced protein binding to membranes containing PE was evident from the comparison shown in Fig. 5 A. Phospholipids containing natural fatty acid distributions gave similar results for both wild type and the h C-E32 mutant (not shown). The impact of PE was apparent for hC-G11E32D33 (Fig. 5 A). PE also enhances coagulation reactions, such as those involving factor VIIa (29Neuenschwander P.F. Bianco-Fisher E. Rezaie A.R. Morrissey J.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13988-13993Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The importance of PE was shown in this study by the fact that membranes of PS/PC (5/95) were not competent to support coagulation in the assay shown in Fig. 5 B, whereas PS/PE/PC (5/50/45) was an excellent membrane source (data not shown). Phosphatidylethanolamine also impacts on anticoagulation by APC. It supports higher activity of APC against factor Va in a purified system (30Smirnov M.D. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 816-819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More interesting is a selective promotion of anticoagulation. That is, APC prolongs coagulation to a higher extent in membranes containing PE, under conditions where procoagulation (clotting time) in the absence of APC is constant (30Smirnov M.D. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 816-819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This study supported that finding, although with a smaller impact of PE. Synthetic phospholipids (Fig. 5,B and C), as well as purified phospholipids (data not shown), showed higher anticoagulant activity for APC in membranes containing PE than in those containing only PC (Fig. 5, Band C). The difference varied somewhat with phospholipid preparation and storage time. The largest difference (about 4-fold) was observed in preparations that had been stored at 4 °C for 2 months. An important implication of these comparisons was that the enhanced activity of the site-directed mutants differed with the phospholipid concentration and composition used in an assay. The effect of PE on wild type APC was highest at low phospholipid concentration (Fig. 5 C), whereas the APC-G11E32D33 mutant showed small differences at the different phospholipid concentrations (compare clotting time versus APC-G11E32D33 concentrations in Fig. 5,B and C). APC-G11E32D33 was also relatively insensitive to the presence of PE (Fig. 5, B and C). As a result, the enhanced function of mutants of higher activity will differ with the conditions selected for the assay. High membranes concentrations or the presence of PE reduced the apparent effect of the mutations. This outcome was qualitatively similar to the impact of a chimera protein C that contained residues 1–44 of human prothrombin (30Smirnov M.D. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 816-819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except that PE virtually eliminated the difference between wild type and chimera APC proteins. Earlier predictions (2McDonald J.F. Shah A.M. Schwalbe R.A. Kisiel W. Dahlbäck B. Nelsestuen G.L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5120-5127Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and the outcome for other proteins (4Shen L. Shah A.M. Dahlbäck B. Nelsestuen G.L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 16025-16031Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 5Shah A.M. Kisiel W. Foster D.C. Nelsestuen G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4229-4234Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) suggest that enhanced vitamin K-dependent plasma proteins can be created by site-directed mutation of the Gla domain to enhance membrane binding affinity. This study showed success in generation of human protein C with enhanced membrane binding. Several results indicated that human protein C has unique features among this family of proteins. For example, bovine protein C responded to incorporation of E32D33 (from Q32N33 in the wild type protein) by a large increase in membrane binding affinity, 2A. M. Shah, L. Shen, B. Dahlbäck, and G. L. Nelsestuen, unpublished data. whereas human protein C showed no change for the Q32E mutation (14Zhang L. Castellino F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12040-12045Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and only a small change for addition of the N33D mutation (this study). Human factor VII showed greatly improved membrane-binding affinity upon modification of Pro-10 to Gln and Gln-32 to Glu (5Shah A.M. Kisiel W. Foster D.C. Nelsestuen G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4229-4234Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Other evidence of uniqueness of human protein C is the replacement of Gla-29 by Asp, which had low impact on human protein C interaction with membranes (14Zhang L. Castellino F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12040-12045Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but caused major loss of membrane binding by human prothrombin (31Ratcliffe J.V. Furie B. Furie B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24339-24345Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and human factor X (32Larson P.J. Camire R.M. Wong D. Fasano N.C. Monroe D.M. Tracy P.B. High K.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5029-5038Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Thus, identification of residues that can be altered to improve membrane interaction by human protein C is an important step to understanding the unique properties of this protein. It also provides methods to potentiate this important regulator of blood coagulation for research and biomedical applications. The S11G mutation generated protein C with higher membrane affinity at saturating calcium levels. This mutation therefore appeared to alter the actual membrane contact site on the protein. This could occur by a direct impact of glycine-11 on membrane interaction or by indirect improvement of other positions in the protein. Other residues could include placement of E32D33 to a more optimum location that allowed them to enhance membrane contact. Although the actual site of membrane contact is still unknown, it can be noted that this site is adjacent to position 10, one of the three residues that appeared to regulate most of the diversity in membrane affinity among the naturally occurring proteins (sites 10, 32, and 33 (2McDonald J.F.

Position 11 is in a compact region of the protein that is closely placed to Ca-2 in the x-ray crystal structure (33Soriano-Garcia M. Padmanabhan K. deVos A.M. Tulinsky A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2554-2566Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). The Ser-11 hydroxyl may function as a ligand to the calcium ion, thereby modifying structure in this region. Alternatively, the serine side chain may not allow optimum protein folding due to steric factors. An importance of position 11 is also suggested by low activity of a Gly (position 12 of factor IX) to Arg mutation of factor IX (34Larson P.J. Stanfield-Oakley S.A. VanDusen W.J. Kasper C.K.

Other site-directed mutations produced proteins that displayed a different type of enhanced function. For example, an additional change of H10Q or S12N resulted in proteins with a lower calcium requirement for membrane association, but with nearly identical membrane binding at saturating calcium levels. This suggested that Gln-10 and Asn-12 modify calcium binding to the protein without participation in actual membrane contact. These mutants should show higher activity at low calcium concentrations, but identical activity at saturating calcium. In the assays used, these mutants were similar to APC-G11E32D33, indicating that calcium levels were saturating in these assays. The calcium concentration under in vivo conditions is not known, and whole animal experiments may be needed to determine whether improvements in calcium binding to the protein can aid function. In all cases and with all membranes used, improved enzyme activity of APC correlated with increased membrane affinity. In fact, the behavior appeared to fit to a general equilibrium expression for assembly of the active APC complex. Although the correct binding expression for APC function as an anticoagulant may be quite complex, it should contain protein and phospholipid components such as those given in boldface in Equation 2. KD = [Pfree][PLfree][Va?][S?][Xa?]/[P*PL*Va?*S?*Xa?](Eq. 2) [P free] and [PL free] are the concentrations of free APC and unfilled APC binding sites on the membrane. Va,S, and Xa may also contribute to the complex. Assuming that bound protein [P*PL] is active and free protein [P free] is inactive, any change that lowers the ratio of [P free]/[P*PL] in Equation 2 will enhance the activity of APC. This is a common proposal for protein S function; by enhancing membrane bound APC, activity of APC is increased. Other ways in which the ratio of [P free]/[P*PL] can be decreased include the addition of more PL to the reaction. Indeed, higher phospholipid levels in the assay gave higher APC activity (compare APC-wild type activity in Fig. 5 A versus Fig. 5 B). An alternative way to lower [P free]/[P*PL] is with membrane content that results in higher affinity. This can include an increase in PS or use of PE as a portion of the neutral phospholipid. Again, improvements in the phospholipid, by inclusion of PE,enhanced the activity of APC (Fig. 5). A third way of reducing [P free]/[P*PL] is by improvements of the membrane binding site on the protein. Higher activity by APC-G11E32D33 illustrated this property. Finally, these three approaches to higher activity of APC impact on the same phenomenon, the ratio of [P free]/[P*PL], and a maximum limit for activity is reached when [P free] becomes zero. Lowered [P free]/[P*PL] by one mechanism will decrease the potential impact of other mechanisms. As expected from this interrelationship, the highest impact of the enhanced mutants was observed at low concentrations of membranes that did not contain PE (Fig. 5 C). The largest impact of PE was observed with low affinity proteins (Fig. 5, B and C) and was almost undetected for high affinity proteins. The impact of phospholipid concentration was greatest for low affinity proteins and was minimal for the APC mutants with high membrane affinity (compare Fig. 5 B with Fig. 5 C). Due to these properties, it is possible that neither the impact of PE nor the increased activity of the mutants will be detected in assays that use high phospholipid concentrations. Standard clotting assays often use an optimum phospholipid concentration, and that may mask the benefit of both PE and the mutant proteins. The pattern of protein S impact may suggest a function more complex than simple enhancement of membrane-bound APC. Rather than reducing the importance of protein S, APC mutants with increased membrane affinity showed a higher response to protein S that did wild type protein. In addition, the two coagulation assays showed different requirements for protein S. The thromboplast in assay is sensitive to components of the prothrombinase complex and the major site of APC function is factor Va. This assay required a higher protein S concentration for maximum activity than did the APTT assay. The latter relies on the intrinsic pathway, including factor VIIIa/IXa. Thus, the result of protein S titrations with APTT versus thromboplastin assays (Fig. 4) suggested that protein S interacted somewhat differently for APC action on factor VIIIa versus factor Va.

https://openalex.org/W1991827599,"Carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase (CPSase) consists of a 120-kDa synthetase domain (CPS) that makes carbamoyl phosphate from ATP, bicarbonate, and ammonia usually produced by a separate glutaminase domain. CPS is composed of two subdomains, CPS.A and CPS.B. Although CPS.A and CPS.B have specialized functions in intact CPSase, the separately cloned subdomains can catalyze carbamoyl phosphate synthesis. This report describes the construction of a 58-kDa chimeric CPSase composed of Escherichia coli CPS.A catalytic subdomains and the mammalian regulatory subdomain. The catalytic parameters are similar to those of the E. coli enzyme, but the activity is regulated by the mammalian effectors and protein kinase A phosphorylation. The chimera has a single site that binds phosphoribosyl 5′-pyrophosphate (PRPP) with a dissociation constant of 25 μm. The dissociation constant for UTP of 0.23 mm was inferred from its effect on PRPP binding. Thus, the regulatory subdomain is an exchangeable ligand binding module that can control both CPS.A and CPS.B domains, and the pathway for allosteric signal transmission is identical in E. coli and mammalian CPSase. A deletion mutant that truncates the polypeptide within a postulated regulatory sequence is as active as the parent chimera but is insensitive to effectors. PRPP and UTP bind to the mutant, suggesting that the carboxyl half of the subdomain is essential for transmitting the allosteric signal but not for ligand binding.

Holden H.M. Wesenberg G. Raushel F.M. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6305-6316Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Moreover, kinetic studies of the E. coli enzyme (66Braxton B.L. Mullins L.S. Raushel F.M. Reinhart G.D. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2309-2316Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) showed that CPS.B is the major target of allosteric regulation. We have found (65Liu X. Guy H.I. Evans D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27747-27755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that allosteric effectors also bind to the B3 region of CAD by constructing an interesting chimeric protein in which the E. coli CPSase regulatory domain (B3) was replaced by the B3 subdomain of CAD. The chimera was inhibited by UTP but not by the E. coli effector UMP and was activated by PRPP, a metabolite that has no effect on the E. coli enzyme. In this report, we describe the construction and the function of a chimeric CPSase consisting of E. coli CPSase A1 and A2 subdomains fused to the mammalian CPSase B3 subdomain. The 7.3-kilobase pair plasmid pHL2, containing the coding sequences for a chimeric molecule consisting of the complete E. coli CPSase domain with only the B3 regulatory domain replaced with the corresponding region of CAD, was constructed previously (65Liu X. Guy H.I. Evans D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27747-27755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is under the control of thecarB promoter. The E. coli strain RC50, defective in the carA and carB genes encoding the small and large subunits of E. coli CPSase, respectively, was kindly provided by Dr. Carol Lusty (Public Health Research Institute of the City of New York) (46Guillou F. Rubino S.D. Markovitz R.S. Kinney D.M. Lusty C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8304-8308Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The recombinant proteins, which are expressed constitutively under the control of the carB promoter, were isolated from 200-ml cultures of transformed RC50 cells grown to stationary phase (46Guillou F. Rubino S.D. Markovitz R.S. Kinney D.M. Lusty C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8304-8308Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The cells were resuspended in 2 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 5% glycerol buffer and broken by sonication for 2 min at 4 °C. The sonicate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Transformation was carried out by the Hanahan procedure (67Hanahan D. DNA Cloning: A Practical Approach.in: Glover D.M. IRL Press, New York1985Google Scholar). Restriction digests, ligations, and other DNA procedures were carried out using standard protocols (68Maniatis T. Fritsch E.R. Sambrook I. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). The plasmid pHE-A12eB3m encoding the E. coli CPS A1 and A2 and mammalian B3 subdomains (Fig. 1), was constructed 2In the original construct, the borders of the regulatory domain of CAD were defined (28Simmer J.P.

In the new construct reported here, an additional 25 residues were deleted from the amino end of the mammalian regulatory domain so that it corresponds more closely to the size of the regulatory domain described in the x-ray structure (15Thoden J.B. Holden H.M. Wesenberg G. Raushel F.M. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6305-6316Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) of E. coli CPSase. Superscripts m and e refer to the origin of the domain, the mammalian and E.coli proteins, respectively. by reacting the plasmid, pHL2, with NspV (site in the E. colisequence, position 2,730) and StuI (site in the CAD sequence, position 3,892). The 4.3-kilobase pair fragment was then religated using T4 DNA ligase following treatment with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase. The 4.2-kilobase pair recombinant, pNS-A12eB3mΔ, was constructed in order to study the consequences of deleting the carboxyl end of the CAD regulatory domain in the chimera. The plasmid, pHE-A12eB3m was reacted with SalI (site in CAD, position 4,205) and EcoRI (site in the vector), and the ends were made flush using the Klenow fragment prior to religation. Protein concentrations were determined using the micro-BCA protein assay reagent kit from Pierce and by scanning Coomassie Blue-stained polyacrylamide gels. SDS-gel eletrophoresis was carried out on 10% polyacrylamide gels using the Laemmli procedure (69Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207516) Google Scholar). The gels were scanned using an HP Scan Jet 4C, UN-SCAN-IT gel Automated Digitizing System, and the concentration of the isolated proteins was determined by measuring the ratio of peak density to total density in a given lane and the total amount of protein applied to the gel. The background density was subtracted, and all measurements were made within the linear range of the densitometer. The recombinant protein was cross-linked using dimethyl suberimidate following the procedure (42Guy H.I. Schmidt B. Herve G. Evans D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14172-14178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) used for intact CAD. The reaction mixture consisted of 0.03 mg of cross-linking reagent and 10–20 μg of protein in a total volume of 0.5 ml of 0.1 m N-ethylmorpholinacetic acid, pH 8.5. The reaction, which was carried out at room temperature, was initiated by the addition of the cross-linking reagent and quenched by the addition of 1 mglycine to a final concentration of 0.1 m. The extent of cross-linking was determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase activity was assayed using a radiometric procedure (20Coleman P.F. Suttle D.P.

Biochem. 1992; 207: 957-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) in which carbamoyl phosphate was trapped as acid-stable carbamoyl aspartate. The ATP concentration ranged between 0 and 5 mm, and 0.75 mm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, 20 mm NH4Cl, and 12 mmNaHCO3 were used for all effector response curves. The protocol for phosphorylation was described previously by Carreyet al. (36Carrey E.A. Campbell D.G. Hardie D.G. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 3735-3742Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) with slight modification (65Liu X. Guy H.I. Evans D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27747-27755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The kinetic data were fit by least squares analysis (Micromath Scientist) to the Michaelis-Menten equation, the Hill equation, or the expressionv =V max[S]/(K m + S + S2/K i) which takes substrate inhibition into account. The procedure of Khorana (70Khorana H.G. Fernandes J.F. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1958; 230: 941-948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used to synthesize [32P]phosphoribosyl-5′-pyrophosphate. Radiolabeled PRPP (18,000 cpm/nmol) is enzymatically synthesized from ribose-5′-phosphate and ATP (500 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in a reaction catalyzed by PRPP synthetase, which was kindly provided by Robert Switzer (University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign). The specific radioactivity was determined by quantitating PRPP using an assay (18Shoaf W.T. Jones M.E. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 4039-4051Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) that measures the amount of [14C]CO2 produced from PRPP and [14C-COOH]orotidylate in the coupled reactions catalyzed by orotidylate PRPP transferase and OMP decarboxylase. The final concentrations in a 1-ml assay mixture were 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm MgCl2, 100 μm[14C]orotate, and 1–20 nmol of PRPP. The reaction was initiated with 1–10 units of PRPP transferase-OMP decarboxylase mixed enzyme (Sigma). Following incubation for 1 h at room temperature, the reaction was quenched with 0.2 ml of 4 m perchloric acid. The [14C]carbon dioxide generated in the reaction was trapped in 0.2 ml of a 1:1 (v/v) ethylene glycol/ethanolamine solution and counted in a liquid scintillation counter. the binding of radiolabeled PRPP to protein was measured using the spin column procedure (72Penefsky H.S. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 56: 527-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar) that separates free-ligand and protein-bound ligand. The protein sample was incubated with [32P]PRPP for 15 min at 37 °C. The 150-μl reaction was then transferred to a 0.7 × 2.8-cm bed Nick spin column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The protein-bound ligand was eluted by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 4 min. Under these conditions, the volume of the eluant varied from 145 to 155 μl, and the recovery of the protein was 98–100%. The amount of bound PRPP was determined by liquid scintillation counting. The validity of the method was confirmed by measuring the binding of PRPP to CAD by continuous flow dialysis 3X. Liu, N. Sahay, G. Herve, and D. Evans, unpublished observations. and, for the chimeric protein, by equilibrium dialysis. For equilibrium dialysis, a 100-μl sample of the chimeric protein (0.61 mg/ml) was dialyzed against 0.5 ml of PRPP, at the indicated concentrations, in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 5% glycerol. After 24 h of equilibration, the PRPP concentration within the cell was determined by the PRPP assay described above. The same binding parameters were obtained by flow dialysis for CAD and by equilibrium dialysis for the chimeric protein as were obtained by the microcolumn method. Although the fraction of total ligand bound to the protein is low in the microcolumn method, the data are nevertheless reasonably accurate, since the column effectively separates free and bound ligand. The background counts in the eluted fraction obtained by applying the same amount of PRPP to the microcolumn in the absence of protein were quite low. For example, at 50 μm PRPP, the average value of the background for six experiments was 46 ± 6 cpm, compared with a typical value of 1,615 cpm in the presence of protein. At all PRPP concentrations, the signal:background ratio was at least 10. The dissociation constant for UTP was determined indirectly by measuring the PRPP binding in the presence of several different UTP concentrations. The dissociation constant was obtained using the expression ν½ = [PRPP]/([PRPP] +K PRPP(1 + [X]½/K UTP)), where [X]½ is the concentration of UTP required to displace half of the bound PRPP (ν½). K PRPP and [PRPP] are the measured PRPP dissociation constant and the concentration, respectively. We previously constructed (65Liu X. Guy H.I. Evans D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27747-27755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) a plasmid, pHL2, which codes for a chimeric protein in which the CPS B3 subdomain of theE. coli synthetase subunit was replaced by the corresponding subdomain of CAD (Fig. 1). A new plasmid, pHE-A12eB3m, that encodes the E. coli CPS A1 and A2 (residues 1–359) fused to the mammalian B3 subdomain (residues 1,298–1,461) was constructed by deleting theE. coli CPS A3, B1, and B2 subdomains from the chimeric plasmid, pHL2 (65Liu X.

In this report, we describe a regulatory linkage between the ability of yeast cells to respire and activation of glycogen synthase. Strains containing respiration-deficient mutations in genes such asCOQ3, required for the synthesis of coenzyme Q, were reduced in their ability to accumulate glycogen in response to limiting glucose. This lowered glycogen accumulation results from inactivation of the rate-determining enzyme, glycogen synthase (Gsy2p). Reduced glycogen synthase activity is coincident with lowered glucose 6-phosphate and ATP levels in the respiration-deficient cells deprived of glucose. Alanine substitutions of three previously characterized phosphorylation sites in Gsy2p, Ser-650, Ser-654, or Thr-667, each suppressed the glycogen defect in cells unable to respire, suggesting that inactivation of this enzyme is mediated by phosphorylation of these residues. Inactivation of glycogen synthase requires theRAS signaling pathway that controls cAMP-dependent protein kinase and is independent of Pho85p previously identified as a Gsy2p kinase.

Expression of many metabolic pathways in yeast is regulated by the availability of nutrients in the growth medium. A well studied example is the coordinate regulation of genes involved in the utilization and storage of sugars (1Johnston M. Carlson M. Broach J.R. Pringle J.R. Jones E.W. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces. 2. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 193-282Google Scholar). Glucose is the preferred carbon source of yeast, and, even when grown aerobically, this sugar is fermented to ethanol and CO2. Expression of many proteins that are not essential during fermentation is repressed by glucose (1Johnston M. Carlson M. Broach J.R. Pringle J.R. Jones E.W. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces. 2. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 193-282Google Scholar). This repression is released when glucose is depleted from the culture medium, allowing for the utilization of alternative carbon sources requiring respiration. An alternative fate of glucose in yeast is accumulation in the form of the storage carbohydrate glycogen (1Johnston M. Carlson M. Broach J.R. Pringle J.R. Jones E.W. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces. 2. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 193-282Google Scholar, 2Francois J.-M. Blazquez J. Arino J.

Bacteriol. 1980; 143: 1384-1394Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Accumulation of glycogen is enhanced in cells limited for any one of several nutrients including nitrogen, phosphorous, sulfur, and carbon. This stored glycogen is degraded during resumption of vegetative growth from stationary phase or during spore germination. Accumulation and degradation of glycogen is controlled by the activities of glycogen synthase and glycogen phosphorylase. Glycogen synthase in yeast is encoded by two genes, GSY1 and GSY2 (4Farkas I. Hardy T.A. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Roach R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20879-20886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Farkas I. Harday T.A. Goebl M.G. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15602-15607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GSY2 encodes the major nutritionally regulated form of glycogen synthase and accounts for about 90% of the total enzymatic activity in cells entering stationary phase (5Farkas I. Harday T.A. Goebl M.G. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15602-15607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two kinds of control ensure that there are appropriate levels of Gsy2p activity in cells responding to nutrient limiting conditions. First,GSY2 transcription is increased as cells deplete glucose from their growth medium (6Hardy T.A. Huang D. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27909-27913Google Scholar). Release of this glucose repression is mediated by the cAMP pathway, which, in yeast, is regulated by Ras1p and Ras2p (6Hardy T.A. Huang D. Roach P.J. J. Biol.

Cell. 1988; 53: 555-566Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). A second level of control involves covalent phosphorylation of the carboxyl terminus of Gsy2p, which converts the enzyme to a less active form (15Hardy T.A. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23799-23805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Glucose 6-phosphate (glucose-6-P)1 functions as an allosteric activator that can overcome the inactivation of Gsy2p caused by phosphorylation. Thus, the ratio of activity measured in the absence of glucose-6-P to that in the presence of glucose-6-P (−/+ glucose-6-P activity ratio) is often used as a measure of the activation state of the enzyme. The protein kinases Snf1p and Pho85p have been implicated in the regulation of Gsy2p activity by protein phosphorylation (6Hardy T.A. Huang D. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27909-27913Google Scholar, 16Thompson-Jaeger S. Francois J. Gaughran J.P. Tatchell K. Genetics. 1991; 129: 697-706Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Cannon J.F. Pringle J.R.

Snf1p facilitates expression of many glucose-repressible enzymes and is required for full activity of Gsy2p in cells entering stationary phase (1Johnston M. Carlson M. Broach J.R. Pringle J.R. Jones E.W. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces. 2. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 193-282Google Scholar, 6Hardy T.A. Huang D. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27909-27913Google Scholar). Maintenance of Gsy2p activity by Snf1p is thought to be mediated by antagonism of the protein kinase Pho85p (18Huang D. Farkas I. Roach P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4357-4365Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 20Huang D. Moffat J. Wilson W.A. Moore L. Cheng C. Roach P.J. Andrews B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3289-3299Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Biochemical studies suggest that Pho85p directly phosphorylates Gsy2p at Ser-654 and/or Thr-667 to reduce the enzyme activity. Consistent with these in vitro observations, deletion of PHO85 from cells lowers phosphorylation of Gsy2p as judged by the −/+ glucose-6-P activity ratio. However, Gsy2p continues to be significantly phosphorylated in pho85 mutant cells grown to early stationary phase, suggesting that there is at least one other protein kinase that can reduce glycogen synthase activity by phosphorylation (18Huang D. Farkas I. Roach P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4357-4365Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 20Huang D. Moffat J. Wilson W.A. Moore L. Cheng C. Roach P.J. Andrews B. Mol. Cell.

One candidate is cAMP-dependent protein kinase (cAPK), although it is currently uncertain whether this occurs directly or by the function of additional kinases (15Hardy T.A. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23799-23805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Peng Z.Y. Trumbly R.J. Reimann E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13871-13877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We report here that there is a regulatory linkage between the ability of yeast cells to respire and the synthesis of glycogen. Strains containing respiration-deficient mutations in genes such asCOQ3, required for the synthesis of coenzyme Q, were reduced in their ability to accumulate glycogen in response to depletion of glucose in the culture medium. Our results strongly suggest that this lowered glycogen accumulation is the direct result of hyperphosphorylation of Gsy2p, leading to a block in the activation of this rate-determining enzyme. This inactivation of Gsy2p requires the Ras2p signaling pathway that controls cAPK and is independent of Pho85p kinase. Strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae used in this study are listed in Table I. The COQ3 deletions in strains RY52, RY53, and RY71 were constructed by replacing the entireCOQ3 coding sequence with LEU2 orTRP1. The coq3::URA3 disruptions were introduced into strains JC482 and EG328–1A by transforming a 3.3-kbBglII restriction fragment derived from plasmid pY9 and selecting for uracil prototrophy.

Michaelis S. Mitchell A. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, NY1994: 207-217Google Scholar). Thecoq3 mutants display a petite phenotype that increases the length of time required for cells inoculated into YPD medium to enter exponential growth (24Clarke C.F. Williams W. Teruya J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16636-16644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Tzagoloff A. Dieckmann C.L. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 211-225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To synchronize the growth phase for yeast cultures, we inoculated YPD medium with a 10,000-fold dilution of COQ3 cells and a 6,000-fold dilution of coq3mutants. By midexponential growth, the COQ3 and coq3 strains achieved similar cell densities, and both cultures entered the lag period about 23 h after inoculation. Following the lag period, COQ3 cells resumed a second growth phase, while there was a minimal increase in cell number detected in respiration-deficient coq3 cultures. We used transposon-tagged mutagenesis to screen for glycogen-deficient strains (26Chun K.T. Goebl M.G. Genetics. 1996; 142: 39-50Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this screen, we isolated a small subset of the previously described glycogen-deficient mutant. The reason why only a portion of these genes were isolated appears to be due in part to a bias in our transposon-tagged mutagenesis. One mutant designated 270-24 displayed a severe glycogen defect and, based on complementation analysis, had a different mutant locus than previously described (17Cannon J.F. Pringle J.R. Fiechter A. Khalil M. Genetics. 1994; 136: 485-503Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A yeast genomic library inserted into YCp50-LEU2 was introduced into RY10, a derivative of strain 270-24, and 10,000 transformants were screened for glycogen accumulation as judged by iodine staining. Glycogen-accumulating strains were isolated, and plasmids were rescued and reintroduced into RY10 to confirm plasmid-dependent complementation. Plasmid pRY7, containing a 11-kb genomic sequence, conferred glycogen accumulation in strain RY10. A 2.6-kbBamHI restriction fragment encoding the COQ3 gene was removed from pRY7 and inserted into pRS315, generating pRY10, and this plasmid was shown to restore glycogen accumulation in strain RY10. The gap repair method was used to obtain the COQ3 sequences disrupted by the URA3-marked transposon from strain RY10 (27Rothstein R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 281-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar). A 5.5-kb NruI and NsiI DNA fragment was removed from plasmid pRY7, and the remaining portion of the plasmid DNA was introduced into strain RY10. After selecting for Leu+transformants, a plasmid designated pRY9 was rescued from the RY10 strain derivative. Glycogen accumulation was measured qualitatively by inverting agar plates containing yeast cells over iodine crystals (28Wek R.C. Cannon J.F. Dever T.E. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5700-5710Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Chester V.E. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1968; 51: 49-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Yeasts develop a brown color proportional to their levels of glycogen. Glycogen-deficient strains are yellow. A quantitative measure of glycogen levels was determined as described previously (15Hardy T.A. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23799-23805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Glycogen was digested with α-amylase and amyloglucosidase, and released glucose was measured as described (30Adams H. Bergmeyer H.U. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. 1963: 539-543Google Scholar) and reported as mg of glucose released per 100 mg of total protein. Glycogen synthase was assayed as described by Hardy and Roach (15Hardy T.A. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23799-23805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Where indicated, extracts were first passed over a Sephadex G25 spin column to remove low molecular weight compounds (31Huang D. Wilson W.A. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22495-22501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). A unit of glycogen synthase activity is defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzes 1 μmol of glucose from UDP-glucose to glycogen/min/mg of total protein. Total activity of glycogen synthase is that measured in the presence of 7.2 mm glucose 6-phosphate. The −/+ glucose-6-P activity ratio is defined as the glycogen synthase activity measured in the absence of glucose-6-P divided by the activity measured in the presence of glucose-6-P. Each reported measurement was the average of three independent experiments. Cells were grown to the indicated phase in YPD medium and collected by filtration, followed by rapid freezing in liquid nitrogen. Determination of glucose-6-P was carried out as described (32Wilson W.A. Hawley S.A. Hardie G.D. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1426-1434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). To measure ATP, ADP, and AMP, cell extracts were prepared as described for the glucose 6-P assay. ATP was measured using hexokinase (33Estabrook R.W. Williamson J.R. Frenkel R. Maitra P.K. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 10: 474-482Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar). ADP and AMP levels were quantitated using pyruvate kinase and myokinase as described previously (33Estabrook R.W. Williamson J.R. Frenkel R. Maitra P.K. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 10: 474-482Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Values are reported as nmol/A 600 and are the average of three independent experiments. The activity of cAPK was measured in the absence of exogenous cAMP as pmol of phosphate incorporated/min/μg of total protein using Leu-Arg-Arg-Ala-Ser-Leu-Gly (Kemptide) substrate (34Denis C.L. Kemp B.E. Zoller M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17932-17935Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). cAMP was measured as pmol/A 600 using a [125I]cAMP RIA system (NEN Life Science Products) as described by the manufacturer. As part of a screen for genes required for glycogen synthesis, we introduced mutations by insertion of aURA3-marked transposable element into the yeast genome of haploid strain FY23 (26Chun K.T. Goebl M.G. Genetics. 1996; 142: 39-50Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One mutant strain, designated 270-24, showed reduced glycogen accumulation as measured by iodine staining and was characterized for further analysis. We identified the disrupted gene by complementation using a yeast genomic library inserted into vector YCp50-LEU2. Progressively smaller DNA sequences were tested for complementation, and a 2.6-kb BamHI restriction fragment encoding COQ3 was found to restore fully glycogen levels as judged by the brown color after iodine staining (Fig. 1). COQ3 encodes 3,4-dihydroxy-5-hexaprenylbenozoate methyltransferase that catalyzes the fourth and rate-limiting step in the coenzyme Q biosynthetic pathway (24Clarke C.F. Williams W. Teruya J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16636-16644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We confirmed that the glycogen deficiency was the result of a COQ3 disruption by first isolating the mutant gene using the gap repair method, followed by DNA sequencing using transposon-based primers. The transposon was found to be inserted in codon 148, located in the middle of the COQ3 coding sequence. We independently confirmed that loss of COQ3function led to a glycogen deficiency by replacing the entire coding sequence of COQ3 with the TRP1 marker gene. Thecoq3 cells had reduced glycogen accumulation as judged by iodine staining, and enzymatic glycogen measurements revealed a 6-fold reduction in glycogen levels in the coq3 strain as compared with isogenic wild-type cells (Fig. 1 and Table II).Table IIActivation of glycogen synthase is blocked in coq3 mutant cellsRelevant genotype2-aRelevant genotypes of strain JC482 (COQ3) and RY33 (coq3::URA3) are indicated.

Open table in a new tab The synthesis of coenzyme Q is essential for respiration, and, consistent with a previous report (24Clarke C.F. Williams W. Teruya J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16636-16644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we found coq3mutants were unable to grow in media containing the nonfermentable carbon source, glycerol (Fig. 1). To examine whether defects in other mitochondrial proteins required for respiration also led to the inability to accumulate glycogen, we characterized coq4, coq6, and coq8 mutants (25Tzagoloff A. Dieckmann C.L. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 211-225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As found in coq3 cells, impairment of these enzymatic steps in the coenzyme Q pathway negated the ability to accumulate glycogen in addition to causing the inability to grow on glycerol-containing medium (Fig. 2). Next we examined strains lacking ATP2, encoding the β-subunit of the F1 ATPase,COR1, encoding the core protein of coenzyme QH2-cytochromec reductase, or MIP1, encoding mitochondrial DNA polymerase. These mutants, which represent the major phenotypic classes for petite complementation groups as defined by Tzagoloff and Dieckmann (25Tzagoloff A. Dieckmann C.L. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 211-225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), were unable to grow in glycerol-containing medium and were also impaired for glycogen accumulation (Fig. 2). We conclude that impaired glycogen accumulation is a general property of respiration-deficient strains. Synthesis of glycogen is controlled by the activity of glycogen synthase. To examine the activity of glycogen synthase, we cultured acoq3::URA3 mutant strain and its wild-typeCOQ3 counterpart in glucose-containing medium and collected cells when glycogen accumulated after the exponential growth phase. While the total glycogen synthase activity was similar between the isogenic COQ3 and coq3::URA3 strains, the activated form of the enzyme measured in the absence of glucose-6-P was greatly reduced in the respiration-deficient strain. The glycogen synthase activity ratio in the coq3::URA3 mutant was 9 times lower than that measured in wild-type COQ3 cells (Table II). The inactivation of glycogen synthase in thecoq3::URA3 strain suggests that increased phosphorylation of Gsy2p lowers the activity of this biosynthetic enzyme, thus leading to reduced levels of glycogen. Hardy and Roach (15Hardy T.A. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23799-23805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that deletion of the carboxyl terminus of Gsy2p blockedin vivo phosphorylation of glycogen synthase and increased the activity ratio. We addressed whether the expression of GSY2-Δ643, deleted for 61 carboxyl-terminal residues, could restore glycogen accumulation in a coq3 strain (Fig. 3). When GSY2-Δ643 was expressed from either the GSY2 promoter or the heterologousADC1 promoter, which is not subject to glucose repression, we found accumulation of glycogen in thecoq3::URA3 strain. In contrast, we found reduced levels of glycogen in coq3::URA3 cells as measured by iodine staining when we similarly expressed a full-length version of Gsy2p. Consistent with earlier observations (15Hardy T.A. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23799-23805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we also found that expression of GSY2-Δ643 in coq3::URA3cells using the GSY2 promoter resulted in an elevated activity ratio compared with the full-length GSY2 (0.55versus 0.09) These results support the idea that reduced activation of glycogen synthase in the respiration-deficient strains results from increased phosphorylation of residues in the carboxyl terminus of Gsy2p. The total activity of glycogen synthase was similar in the coq3::URA3 and COQ3 cells (Table II), indicating that there was no significant difference in GSY2 expression. Furthermore, these experiments indicate that the coq3 cells contain sufficient glucose and energy stores to synthesize glycogen provided an activated form of Gsy2p is present. Previously it was found that three carboxyl-terminal residues in Gsy2p, Ser-650, Ser-654, and Thr-667, were probable regulatory phosphorylation sites (15Hardy T.A. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23799-23805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Alanine substitutions at each of these sites resulted in an increased glycogen synthase activity ratio and elevated glycogen accumulation in cells grown to late exponential phase. To determine whether these residues were required for inactivation of glycogen synthase in respiration-deficient cells, we compared glycogen accumulation in a coq3::LEU2 strain expressing different GSY2 alleles encoding carboxyl-terminal residue substitutions or deletions (Fig. 4). EachGSY2 allele was expressed from the TRP1-marked low copy number plasmid pRS314 in isogenic strains DH2 (gsy2::URA3) and RY53 (gsy2::URA3 coq3::LEU2). As judged by iodine staining, each of theGSY2 alleles complemented the gsy2 defect in DH2 cells, indicating that each Gsy2p mutant protein was functionally expressed (data not shown). Consistent with our earlier observation, expression of GSY2-Δ643 suppressed the glycogen deficiency in the coq3::LEU2 mutant (Fig. 4 B). By comparison, no glycogen accumulation was found in coq3::LEU2 cells expressing the shorter deletionGSY2-Δ691, and low, but detectable levels, of glycogen were found in GSY2-Δ656 cells. These results suggest that the sequences between residues 643 and 691 directly participate in the inactivation of Gsy2p in response to a failure to respire, with sequences carboxyl-terminal to residue 691 performing no regulatory role. GSY2 alleles containing alanine substituted for each individual serine or threonine between residues 650 and 704 were next assessed for glycogen content in the coq3::LEU2strain RY53 (Fig. 4). Only cells expressing GSY2p containing alanine substitutions at Ser-650, Ser-654, or Thr-667 were found to accumulate glycogen as judged by iodine staining (Fig. 4 B). However, each of these strains was iodine-stained a lighter brown color than cells expressing GSY2-Δ643. When S650A and S654A were combined into a single GSY2 allele, the iodine staining was darker brown than either of the alleles containing single alanine substitutions. Together, these results suggest that phosphorylation of three residues"

The gene is highly expressed in exocrine pancreas and in the mammary gland during pregnancy and lactation. In this paper, we have focused on its transcriptional regulation in exocrine pancreas. Reporter gene analysis in cell cultures reveals that a high level of tissue-specific expression is established by the proximal 839 base pairs of the 5′-flanking region. This is due to a strong enhancer, located at −672 to −637. Transfections in mammary gland-derived cells reveal that the enhancer is pancreas-specific and does not contribute to the mammary gland expression. This indicates that the expression of the CEL gene in the mammary gland and pancreas, respectively, is due to two different regulatory systems. Further characterizations of the enhancer reveal that it is composed of two closely located cis-elements. The proximal element mediates a positive effect, whereas the distal element exerts a silencing effect on the positive proximal element. The functional enhancer complex is composed of ubiquitously expressed factors, since similar interactions are achieved with nuclear extracts from cells derived from other tissues. However, no enhancer activity is achieved in such cells. Hence, the net enhancer activity is the result of a tissue-specific balance between factors interacting with the two elements. Since none of the described cis-elements show any clear homology to known cis-elements, we propose that the interacting complex is composed of yet unidentified transcription factors.

The need for fat is of special importance for infants, since malabsorption would influence both growth and development (1Crawford M.A. Hassam A.G. Stevens P.A. Prog. Lipid Res. 1981; 20: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). To secure the requirement, several different lipolytical enzymes, secreted from the pancreas, contribute to the digestion of dietary fat. One of the important enzymes is carboxyl ester lipase (CEL),1 since it, because of its broad substrate specificity, is believed to be the main enzyme for the hydrolysis of fat-soluble vitamin esters, monoglycerides, and cholesterol esters (2Fredrikzon B. Hernell O. Bläckberg L. Olivecrona T. Pediatr. Res. 1978; 12: 1048-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 3Howles P.N. Carter C.P. Hui D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7196-7202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). CEL is synthesized in the acinar cells of exocrine pancreas, secreted with the pancreatic juice, and activated in the intestinal lumen by bile salts (for reviews, see Refs. 4Wang C.S. Hartsuck J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1166: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar and 5Hui D.Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1303: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). CEL seems to be a very old enzyme. A pancreatic expression has been found in all vertebrates analyzed so far (6Gjellesvik D.R. Lombardo D. Walther B.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1124: 123-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 7Gjellesvik D.R. Lorens J.B. Male R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 603-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In fact, in the pancreas of leopard sharks, CEL is the only lipolytic enzyme for hydrolyzing dietary lipids (8Patton J.S. Warner T.G. Benson A.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 486: 322-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), which suggests that CEL, because of its broad substrate specificity, might even have been one of the first lipolytic enzymes expressed in the pancreas. The importance of CEL for intestinal absorption of dietary lipids is strongly supported by the fact that in mammals it is also synthesized in lactating mammary gland, secreted into the milk, and activated in the intestine (9Hernell O. Olivecrona T. J. Lipid Res. 1974; 15: 367-374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Freed L.M. York C.M. Hamosh M. Sturman J.A. Hamosh P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 878: 209-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Since the capacity of human infants to digest milk lipids is poor during the first months, due to poorly developed pancreatic function (11Hernell O. Bläckberg L. J. Pediatr. Gastroenterol. Nutr. 1983; 2 Suppl. 1: 242-247Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar), the presence of CEL in milk seems to secure fat absorption. After cloning of the CEL cDNA and gene, respectively, we and other groups could show that there is only one gene responsible for the expression in the two tissues (12Nilsson J. Bläckberg L. Carlsson P. Enerbäck S. Hernell O. Bjursell G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 192: 543-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 13Baba T. Downs D. Jackson K.W. Tang J. Wang C.S.

Strömberg K. Stenman G. Sahlin P. Enerbäck S. Bjursell G. Genomics. 1992; 13: 630-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Neither the enzyme nor the gene shows any homology to the classical lipases or their corresponding genes; instead, homologies are found to esterases, such as acetylcholine esterase (12Nilsson J. Bläckberg L. Carlsson P. Enerbäck S. Hernell O. Bjursell G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 192: 543-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), which might indicate that the CEL gene has evolved as a separate lipase/esterase gene.Besides the predominant CEL gene expression in mammary gland and pancreas of humans it has recently been shown that small but significant levels of expression could be detected in other tissues, such as macrophages and liver and endothelial cells. The function of this expression is still unknown, but it has been suggested that CEL interacts with cholesterol esters and oxidized lipoproteins and thereby modulates the progression of atherosclerosis (16Li F. Hui D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28666-28671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 17Li F. Hui D.Y. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 675-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Furthermore, there seem to be differences with respect to the tissue-specific expression among different species (18Zolfaghari R. Harrison E.H. Han J.H. Rutter W.J. Fisher E.A. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1992; 12: 295-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). This might be explained by differences that have taken place during the evolution of the CEL gene locus. For example, in humans, the CEL gene has been duplicated, and the original CEL gene, the mouse homologue, has become a pseudogene (19Madeyski K. Lidberg U. Bjursell G. Nilsson J. Mamm. Genome. 1998; 9: 334-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar).The digestive enzymes have been in focus for a long time. As proposed by Pavlov in the early 1900s (20Pavlov I.P. The Work of the Digestive Glands. (English translation from Russian by W. H. Thompson). Griffin, London1910Google Scholar) and first shown by Grossman et al. (21Grossman M.I. Greengard H. Ivy A.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1943; 138: 676-682Crossref Google Scholar), the variations in levels between different secreted digestive enzymes are controlled by changes in the levels of circulating hormones in response to food composition (22Scheele G.A. Kern H.F. Schultz S.G. Forte J.G. Rauner B.B. Handbook of Physiology. III. American Physiological Society, Bethesda, MD1989: 477-498Google Scholar). This response is fast and dependent on translational regulation and increased secretion of stored enzymes (23Wicker C. Puigserver A. Scheele G. Eur. J.

Changes in mRNA levels can only be induced following prolonged stimulation by nutrients (22Scheele G.A. Kern H.F. Schultz S.G. Forte J.G. Rauner B.B. Handbook of Physiology. III. American Physiological Society, Bethesda, MD1989: 477-498Google Scholar). The regulation of the CEL gene activity in pancreas has been studied by Huang and Hui (25Huang Y. Hui D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6720-6725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), who have shown that the pancreatic cell line AR4-2J constitutively expresses CEL and that this protein expression can be induced by cholecystokinin and secretin without any changes in mRNA level. Further investigations have indicated that Ca2+ and protein kinase C are part of the signal mechanism by which the acinar cells are induced to secret CEL (26Brodt-Eppley J. Hui D.Y. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 605-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The same group was also able to show that a high fat/high cholesterol diet exhibited increased CEL mRNA levels in rats (27Brodt-Eppley J. Hui D.Y. J.

A similar induction by prolonged cholesterol treatment has recently also been shown to occur in rabbits (29Lopez-Candales A. Grosjlos J. Sasser T. Buddhiraju C. Scherrer D. Lange L.G. Kumar V.B. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 74: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The ability to respond to cholesterol has been shown for several other genes such as the low density lipoprotein receptor gene (30Wang X. Sato R. Brown M.S. Hua X. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1994; 77: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar) and the cholesteryl ester transfer protein gene (31Oliveira H.C.F. Chouinard R.A. Agellon L.B. Bruce C. Ma L.M. Walsh A. Breslow J.L. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31831-31838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). However, no response element has yet been reported to mediate cholesterol induction of gene activation. Hence, studies of the CEL gene may also provide important insight into cholesterol-induced gene activation.During the last decade, the tissue-specific regulation of genes expressed in exocrine pancreas has been extensively studied, and the transcriptional regulation has been characterized to some extent. Most work has concerned genes encoding proteases and amylases, in which the pancreatic transcription factor 1 (PTF-1) seems to play a major role (32Kruse F. Rose S.D. Swift G.H. Hammer R.E. MacDonald R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4385-4394Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 33Cockell M. Stevenson B.J. Strubin M. Hagenbuchle O. Wellauer P.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2464-2476Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Almost nothing is known about the transcriptional regulation of the corresponding lipase genes. Recently, some reports have indicated that the amount and type of fat can modulate the rate of transcription of pancreatic lipase (34Wicker C. Puigserver A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 166: 358-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 35Ricketts J. Brannon P.M. J. Nutr. 1994; 124: 1166-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Furthermore, PTF-1 seems to be involved in the regulation of the pancreatic colipase gene (36Fukuoka S. Zhang D.E. Taniguchi Y. Scheele G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11312-11320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,37Sims H.F. Lowe M.E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7120-7125Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar).The high expression level in two different tissues, constitutively in pancreas and induced during lactation in the mammary gland, makes the CEL gene an interesting system for studying tissue-specific regulation. In this first report, we have, by using reporter gene analysis of promoter constructs in the rat pancreatic cell line AR4-2J, analyzed the basic structure of the transcriptional regulatory machinery responsible for the expression of the human CEL gene.DISCUSSIONThe elements responsible for the tissue-specific expression of genes expressed in exocrine pancreas are mainly located within the first few hundred bp of the 5-flanking region (33Cockell M. Stevenson B.J. Strubin M. Hagenbuchle O. Wellauer P.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2464-2476Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 46Boulet A.M. Erwin C.R. Rutter W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 3599-3603Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The expression of such genes is the effect of a cooperative interaction between several elements as described previously and exemplified by the elastase I gene enhancer (32Kruse F. Rose S.D. Swift G.H. Hammer R.E. MacDonald R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4385-4394Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). For this gene, it has been shown that PTF-1, which binds to the A element, is the critical key in directing the expression to the acinar cells (47Roux E. Strubin M. Hagenbuchle O. Wellauer P.K. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1613-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The activity is further enhanced by other elements such as the B and C elements, respectively.Although expression of the CEL gene in the pancreas is highly restricted to exocrine tissue, it seems to be regulated in a different manner. The main response element in the CEL gene promoter is located approximately 650 bp upstream from the transcription initiation site. This element is an absolute requirement for activity as well as for maintenance of the tissue specificity of the promoter. Although the high activity of the largest construct, CEL4740Luc, is the combined effect of several regions, as shown in Fig. 1 by the stepwise increase in activity, its activity is almost abolished if the main element is deleted (Fig. 2 A). Despite the fact that PTF-1 does not seem to be involved in this activation, this element is acting as a pancreas-specific enhancer as demonstrated by transfection of the chimeric CEL/SV40 construct (Fig. 3). In contrast, and as shown by transfection of HC11 cells, the enhancer does not contribute to the high CEL expression seen in lactating mammary gland. Hence, the dominating dual expression pattern of the CEL gene, mammary gland, and pancreas, respectively, is due to two different regulatory systems.Tissue- or cell-specific regulation of transcription, especially of genes with highly restricted expression, often involves cooperative interactions between several regulatory elements (32Kruse F. Rose S.D. Swift G.H. Hammer R.E. MacDonald R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4385-4394Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 48Cockell M. Stolarczyk D. Frutiger S. Hughes G.J. Hagenbuchle O. Wellauer P.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1933-1941Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 49Sanchez H.B. Yieh L. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1161-1169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 50Simonet W.S. Bucay N. Lauer S.J. Taylor J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8221-8229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Such interactions between enhancer elements and their cognate promoters have also been described (51Crenshaw E.B.D. Kalla K. Simmons D.M. Swanson L.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 959-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 52Pinkert C.A. Ornitz D.M. Brinster R.L. Palmiter R.D. Genes Dev. 1987; 1: 268-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis has shown that the proximal part of the CEL gene promoter has been conserved during evolution and is highly similar between human and rat (15Lidberg U. Nilsson J. Strömberg K. Stenman G. Sahlin P. Enerbäck S. Bjursell G. Genomics. 1992; 13: 630-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Although the CEL enhancer itself seems to be able to establish tissue-specific expression, the abolished promoter activity following the deletion of the −317 to −63 region, as shown in Fig. 2 B, indicates the presence of other important elements. As shown in Fig. 1, this region is not in itself sufficient to activate the expression of the human CEL gene in AR4-2J cells. Hence, the results obtained in this study may be consistent with described models of cell-specific gene regulation involving cooperative interactions. However, a further deletion of most of the proximal promoter region, −631 to −63 (Fig. 2 B), resulted in a restoration of the promoter activity (which again indicates the importance of the element located at −650), suggesting that a negative regulatory element is located in the region −631 to −318. As a consequence, the deletion construct CEL1640Δ631/322Luc, in which this region has been deleted, should then give rise to an increased activity; instead, the observed activity is reduced. Moreover, the insertion of an unrelated DNA fragment of identical length as the fragment deleted above into the CEL1640Δ631/63Luc results in a similar reduction of the promoter activity. Taken together, a more likely explanation is that the restored promoter activity observed by the elongation of the deletion −63/−317 up to −631, is the result of moving the enhancer closer to the core promoter. This might also indicate that the effect of the enhancer in the CEL gene promoter is not absolutely position-independent at short distances to the core promoter.The enhancer seems to be built up by two subelements, enhansons: a distal negative element and a proximal positive element. As demonstrated in Fig. 5 B, each trans-acting factor is capable of binding DNA by itself. Enhancers composed of both positive and negative elements often mechanistically involve competition for DNA binding. Overlapping response elements will prevent simultaneous DNA interaction, as seen in the δ1-crystallin gene enhancer (53Kamachi Y. Kondoh H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5206-5215Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, too close location of the response elements might result in steric hindrance, as seen for YY1 and the MGF site in the rat β-casein gene promoter (54Meier V.S. Groner B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 128-137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5 B, this seems not to be the case for the CEL gene enhancer, since EMSA with GO26, containing both the response elements, results in a large complex. This complex seems to be composed of both factors, since it can be competed by oligonucleotides containing a single positive or negative element, respectively. A cooperative interaction like that seen for the sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 factors in the low density lipoprotein receptor gene promoter (49Sanchez H.B. Yieh L. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1161-1169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar) cannot be excluded, although it seems less likely, since a similar amount of cold oligonucleotide was required for competition as for the single elements. However, as has been shown in Figs. 4 and 6 E, respectively, deletion or mutation of the negative element results in a highly increased promoter activity. On the other hand, the negative factor fails to influence the basal promoter activity when the positive element is deleted or mutated. This indicates that the negatively acting factor seems to influence the promoter activity by modulating the activity of the positively acting factor, which is similar to the hierarchical model suggested for the main positive element in the apolipoprotein B gene promoter (40Carlsson P. Bjursell G. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 113-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar).As shown in Fig. 6 A and 7 A, the factors that bind to the enhancer seem to be ubiquitously expressed, since all studied cell types contain nuclear proteins capable of binding to the unique enhancer elements in the CEL gene promoter. Furthermore, GO26, covering the entire enhancer, revealed similar but weaker band patterns with nuclear extract from other cells (data not shown). The ubiquity of factors giving rise to mobility shifts, but not of enhancer activity, may be explained in several ways. The binding to these specific DNA sequences, respectively, could represent the interaction of several distinct nuclear proteins or heteropolymers of nuclear proteins. The cell-specific differences in the subunit composition of a multimeric binding protein may then account for the difference in activity, as is seen in the case of the NF-κB family (55La Rosa F.A. Pierce J.W. Sonenshein G.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1039-1044Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 56Miyamoto S. Schmitt M.J. Verma I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5056-5060Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). An alternative could be the existence of cell-specific differences in the phosphorylation state, as is seen in interferon-regulated genes and lactation associated genes (57Burdon T.G. Demmer J. Clark A.J. Watson C.J. FEBS Lett. 1994; 350: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 58Pine R. Canova A. Schindler C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 158-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Also small differences in the balance between a positive and a negative factor may strongly influence the activation potential as seen for the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein β isoforms ratio in the mammary gland (59Raught B. Liao W.S. Rosen J.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1223-1232PubMed Google Scholar). The difficulties in comparing the amount of a transcription factor in different nuclear extracts are obvious. Nevertheless, it seems to us that the factor binding to the positive element is significantly more highly expressed in cells derived from exocrine pancreas. This suggests that the net enhancer activity might be the result of a tissue-specific balance between the positively and negatively acting factors.Sequence analysis of the functional enhancer reveals no homology to the A, B, or C elements, respectively, in the elastase I gene promoter. Nor does a comparison to other known transcription factor binding sites show any clear homology; however, a comparison of respective subelements to previously reported cis-elements reveals some homologies, which mainly constitute half-sites. However, none of the oligonucleotides containing the corresponding cis-element tested in EMSA (ERE, AP-2, PTF-1) were able to compete with the interactions achieved by GO22 (negative subelement) or GO13 (positive subelement), respectively. The subelement mediating the positive effect contains a spaced palindrome motif that might indicate the binding of a homodimer. When the sequences of the subelements were compared with other promoter sequences, it was found that the subelement mediating the negative effect is present in the promoters of several other lipolytical genes, but none of them is yet connected to any functional activity. Hence, it is possible that the functional enhancer complex might be composed of not yet described transcription factors with new unique DNA binding specificities. Alternatively, it might be composed of common subfactors organized in a unique tissue-specific enhancer structure, as suggested by Tjian and Maniatis (60Tjian R. Maniatis T. Cell. 1994; 77: 5-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar).An attractive hypothesis is that the enhancer element in the CEL gene promoter in some way might be connected with the observed cholesterol induction. The lack of sequence homology for the enhancer element to any known response elements might support this hypothesis. Also, the inactivity of the pancreatic enhancer element in mammary gland is in agreement with this hypothesis, since other factors/hormones are believed to induce milk protein gene expression. However, the reported up-regulation of the CEL gene by cholesterol is a process both too slow and too limited to be studied by transient transfection in the highly CEL expressing AR4-2J cells and will await stably transfected cell lines or more truly transgenes. Hence, analysis of the CEL gene regulation might contribute to the understanding of cholesterol-induced gene activation.In conclusion, the data presented here demonstrate that the expression of the human CEL gene in exocrine pancreas, but not in the lactating mammary gland, is due to a strong pancreas-specific enhancer. This suggests that the tissue-specific expression of the CEL gene is due to different regulatory systems. Also, in contrast to other studied genes expressed in exocrine pancreas, the PTF-1 does not seem to play a major role in the regulation of the CEL gene. Instead, yet unidentified factors interact with the unique enhancer elements. Although these factors are ubiquitously expressed, the functional enhancer complex seems to be organized in a tissue-specific structure. Hence, further characterization of the enhancer complex will provide additional insights into the regulation of exocrine pancreas-specific genes. The need for fat is of special importance for infants, since malabsorption would influence both growth and development (1Crawford M.A. Hassam A.G. Stevens P.A. Prog. Lipid Res. 1981; 20: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). To secure the requirement, several different lipolytical enzymes, secreted from the pancreas, contribute to the digestion of dietary fat. One of the important enzymes is carboxyl ester lipase (CEL),1 since it, because of its broad substrate specificity, is believed to be the main enzyme for the hydrolysis of fat-soluble vitamin esters, monoglycerides, and cholesterol esters (2Fredrikzon B. Hernell O. Bläckberg L. Olivecrona T. Pediatr. Res. 1978; 12: 1048-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 3Howles P.N. Carter C.P. Hui D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7196-7202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). CEL is synthesized in the acinar cells of exocrine pancreas, secreted with the pancreatic juice, and activated in the intestinal lumen by bile salts (for reviews, see Refs. 4Wang C.S. Hartsuck J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1166: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar and 5Hui D.Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1303: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). CEL seems to be a very old enzyme. A pancreatic expression has been found in all vertebrates analyzed so far (6Gjellesvik D.R. Lombardo D. Walther B.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1124: 123-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 7Gjellesvik D.R. Lorens J.B. Male R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 603-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In fact, in the pancreas of leopard sharks, CEL is the only lipolytic enzyme for hydrolyzing dietary lipids (8Patton J.S. Warner T.G. Benson A.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 486: 322-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), which suggests that CEL, because of its broad substrate specificity, might even have been one of the first lipolytic enzymes expressed in the pancreas. The importance of CEL for intestinal absorption of dietary lipids is strongly supported by the fact that in mammals it is also synthesized in lactating mammary gland, secreted into the milk, and activated in the intestine (9Hernell O. Olivecrona T. J. Lipid Res. 1974; 15: 367-374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Freed L.M. York C.M. Hamosh M. Sturman J.A. Hamosh P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 878: 209-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Since the capacity of human infants to digest milk lipids is poor during the first months, due to poorly developed pancreatic function (11Hernell O. Bläckberg L. J. Pediatr. Gastroenterol. Nutr. 1983; 2 Suppl. 1: 242-247Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar), the presence of CEL in milk seems to secure fat absorption. After cloning of the CEL cDNA and gene, respectively, we and other groups could show that there is only one gene responsible for the expression in the two tissues (12Nilsson J. Bläckberg L.
