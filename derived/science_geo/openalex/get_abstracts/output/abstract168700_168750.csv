Current-voltage curves are quantized as integer multiples of one fundamental curve, an observation used to identify single-molecule contacts. The resistance of a single octanedithiol molecule was 900 +/- 50 megohms, based on measurements on more than 1000 single molecules. In contrast, nonbonded contacts to octanethiol monolayers were at least four orders of magnitude more resistive, less reproducible, and had a different voltage dependence, demonstrating that the measurement of intrinsic molecular properties requires chemically bonded contacts."

Deformation within the Tibetan Plateau and its margins, the Himalaya, the Altyn Tagh, and the Qilian Shan, absorbs more than 90% of the relative motion between the Indian and Eurasian plates. Internal shortening of the Tibetan plateau itself accounts for more than one-third of the total convergence. However, the Tibetan plateau south of the Kunlun and Ganzi-Mani faults is moving eastward relative to both India and Eurasia. This movement is accommodated through rotation of material around the eastern Syntaxis. The North China and South China blocks, east of the Tibetan Plateau, move coherently east-southeastward at rates of 2 to 8 millimeters per year and 6 to 11 millimeters per year, respectively, with respect to the stable Eurasia."

Although numerous GPCRs are sorted to a degradative pathway upon prolonged stimulation, the molecular events leading to degradation are poorly understood. Here we report that the human immunodeficiency virus co-receptor CXCR4 undergoes rapid agonist-promoted degradation by a process involving endocytosis via clathrin-coated pits and subsequent sorting to lysosomes. Studies analyzing the sorting of various CXCR4 mutants revealed the presence of a degradation motif (SSLKILSKGK) in the carboxyl terminus of CXCR4. The first two serines as well as the dileucine motif were critical for agonist-induced endocytosis, whereas all three serines but not the dileucine were important in mediating degradation. Mutation of the three lysine residues had no effect on CXCR4 endocytosis yet completely inhibited receptor degradation. Because lysine residues represent potential sites of ubiquitination, we also examined the ubiquitination of CXCR4. Interestingly, CXCR4 was shown to undergo rapid agonist-promoted ubiquitination that was attenuated by mutation of the lysine residues within the degradation motif. These studies implicate a specific role for ubiquitination in sorting endocytosed GPCRs to lysosomes.

G protein-coupled receptor G protein-coupled receptor kinase human immunodeficiency virus hemagluttinin polymerase chain reaction stromal derived factor 1α polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium A common feature among G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)1 signaling systems is desensitization, the loss of responsiveness of a receptor when subjected to continuous stimulation. Studies into the mechanisms involved in this process have revealed that G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) and arrestins are important regulators of GPCR desensitization (1Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1998; 38: 289-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar, 2Ferguson S.S. Pharmacol. Rev. 2001; 53: 1-24PubMed Google Scholar). Upon agonist exposure, many GPCRs are rapidly phosphorylated by a GRK, resulting in binding of arrestin, which serves to both uncouple the receptor from G protein and initiate GPCR endocytosis. Non-visual arrestins have been shown to act as adaptor molecules in agonist-mediated endocytosis of GPCRs by interacting with clathrin (3Goodman Jr., O.B. Krupnick J.G. Santini F. Gurevich V.V.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 871-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), thereby directing the receptor into clathrin-coated pits where it undergoes subsequent endocytosis. Once internalized, some GPCRs are dephosphorylated and subsequently recycled back to the plasma membrane where they can again respond to agonists, a process termed resensitization (6Krueger K.M. Daaka Y. Pitcher J.A. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Although many GPCRs undergo this process of endocytosis and recycling, prolonged or chronic agonist stimulation can also lead to a significant decrease in the total cellular complement of a given GPCR, a process termed down-regulation (7Tsao P. von Zastrow M. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 365-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The principal mechanism underlying down-regulation is GPCR degradation, a multistep process often involving endocytosis and subsequent delivery of the receptor to lysosomes for proteolysis (7Tsao P. von Zastrow M. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 365-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Despite the prevalence of this phenomenon among GPCRs relatively little is known about the molecular mechanisms involved in sorting GPCRs to lysosomes. The chemokine receptors CXCR4 and CCR5 represent particularly interesting models for analysis of GPCR endocytosis and sorting because expression and trafficking of these receptors are known to be critical to HIV infection (8Pelchen-Matthews A.

Here, we use CXCR4 as a model to define mechanisms mediating the sorting of GPCRs to lysosomes. HA-tagged CXCR4 in the vector pcDNA3 was generated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using HA-tagged CXCR4 in the vector pSR1 as a template. A ubiquitin construct containing three consecutive FLAG epitopes at the amino terminus (3×FLAG-Ub) was generated by PCR using His6Myc-tagged ubiquitin as a template followed by subcloning into the vector p3×FLAG-CMV-10 (Sigma). All constructs were sequenced to verify that no errors were introduced by PCR. CEM cells (2.4 × 106) (American Type Culture Collection) were initially incubated in RPMI 1640 media with 10% fetal bovine serum containing 5 μg/ml cycloheximide for 15 min at 37 °C. Cells were then incubated in the same media for 6 h at 37 °C in the presence of 100 nm stromal derived factor-1α (SDF-1α) for 0, 1, 3, or 6 h of the incubation. Cells were lysed by addition of SDS sample buffer and sonication, and proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transblotted onto nitrocellulose. Blots were incubated with an anti-CXCR4 monoclonal antibody (12Förster R. Kremmer E. Schubel A. Breitfeld D. Kleinschmidt A. Nerl C. Bernhardt G Lipp M. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 1522-1531PubMed Google Scholar) and analyzed by chemiluminescence (Pierce) as previously described (13DeGraff J.L. Gagnon A.W. Benovic J.L. Orsini M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11253-11259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Blots were then stripped and probed using β-tubulin primary antibodies (Accurate). Films were scanned and normalized for total protein using the β-tubulin blots (which varied <1.2-fold per experiment). HEK 293 cells grown to 60–80% confluency in 6-cm dishes were transfected with 3 μg of pcDNA3-HA-CXCR4 DNA. The next day cells were split into 24-well plates coated with 0.1 mg/ml poly-l-lysine and allowed to grow for an additional 24 h. Cells were then treated and analyzed as described above for CEM cells. Binding assays were performed using a procedure similar to that described previously (14Di Salvo J. Koch G.E. Johnson K.E.

CEM cells (6 × 105cells/ml) were incubated in complete media containing 5 μg/ml cycloheximide for 15 min and then treated with 100 nmSDF-1α for 3 h. Membranes, prepared as described (14Di Salvo J.

Samples were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with shaking. Reactions were terminated by vacuum filtration through glass fiber filters (presoaked in 1% polyethyleneimine) and repeated washes with ice-cold buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 500 mm NaCl). Nonspecific binding was measured in the presence of 1 μm SDF-1α. Bound radioactivity was determined by counting the filters in a γ counter, and results were analyzed using GraphPad Prism software. HEK 293 cells grown on 6-cm dishes were transiently transfected with 1 μg each of DNA encoding HA-tagged CXCR4, 3×FLAG-tagged ubiquitin, and dynamin-1 K44A. After 48 h, cells were washed once with DMEM and then incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in DMEM supplemented with 20 mmHepes, pH 7.4. Cells were then stimulated for 30 min with 100 nm SDF-1α and scraped in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 40 μm MG132 and 1 mg/ml iodoacetamide. Cells were sonicated and centrifuged at 30,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C in a TLA-45 rotor, and the pellets were solubilized in immunoprecipitation buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mmTris-Cl, pH 8, 5 mm EDTA, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.5% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% (w/v) SDS) containing a protease inhibitor mixture. Samples were incubated with a polyclonal anti-HA antibody (Covance) for 1 h followed by a 1-h incubation with 50 μl of a 50% slurry of protein G-agarose. Samples were washed three times in immunoprecipitation buffer and eluted in SDS sample buffer for 30 min at room temperature. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and treated with denaturation solution (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7, 100 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS) for 30 min at 60 °C (to enhance protein denaturation), and washed with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20. Blots were then incubated with the M2 monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody (1:1000) (Sigma) and processed as described (13DeGraff J.L. Gagnon A.W. Benovic J.L. Orsini M.J. J. Biol.

Internalization of HA-CXCR4 transiently expressed in HEK 293 cells was determined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay that measures the level of epitope-tagged cell surface receptors, as described previously (15Orsini M.J.

Immunofluoresence microscopy was performed using a method similar to that described previously (16Parent J.-L. Labrecque P. Orsini M.J. Benovic J.L. J. Biol.

Mechanistic insight into this process suggests that agonist-promoted endocytosis of CXCR4 is mediated by GRKs and arrestins and occurs via clathrin-coated pits (15Orsini M.J. Parent J.-L. Mundell S.J. Marchese A. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31076-31086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 18Haribabu B. Richardson R.M. Fisher I. Sozzani S.

Because relatively little is known about the fate of endocytosed CXCR4, we assessed whether endogenous CXCR4 in the human T cell lymphoblastoid cell line CEM undergoes agonist-promoted degradation. CEM cells were treated with SDF-1α for 0–6 h, washed, lysed, and analyzed by immunoblotting using an anti-CXCR4 monoclonal antibody. CXCR4 exhibited significant degradation following a 3- or 6-h exposure to SDF-1α (Fig.1, A and B). The loss of CXCR4 immunoreactivity also correlated with a loss of receptor binding sites following a 3-h treatment with agonist as assessed using radiolabeled SDF-1α (Fig. 1 C). Thus, endogenous CXCR4 undergoes rapid and extensive agonist-promoted degradation in CEM cells. In an effort to develop a model system for examining mechanisms of CXCR4 degradation, we tested whether transiently expressed HA-tagged CXCR4 undergoes agonist-promoted degradation in HEK 293 cells. Immunoblot analyses reveal that HA-tagged CXCR4 is rapidly degraded in HEK 293 cells following agonist treatment (Fig. 1 D). Two major sites in the cell where proteins are degraded are the lysosome and the proteasome. To identify the compartment in which CXCR4 is degraded we used selective inhibitors of lysosomal and proteasomal function. CXCR4 degradation was efficiently inhibited by the lysosomotrophic agent chloroquine in both CEM and HEK 293 cells (Fig.2 A). In contrast, CXCR4 degradation was not inhibited by the proteasomal inhibitor MG132 in either cell type (Fig. 2 B). Consistent with these results, we found that agonist treatment promotes CXCR4 co-localization with the late endosome/lysosome marker LAMP1 in HEK 293 cells (Fig.2 C). Thus, our data suggest that CXCR4 is sorted to and degraded in lysosomes following agonist treatment of CEM and HEK 293 cells. To define regions of CXCR4 involved in degradation we initially generated chimeras with CCR5, a related chemokine receptor known to be endocytosed and efficiently recycled (10Signoret N. Pelchen-Matthews A. Mack M. Proudfoot A.E. Marsh M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1281-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Although CCR5 was not degraded, a CCR5 chimera containing the carboxyl terminus of CXCR4 was efficiently degraded upon agonist activation in HEK 293 cells, suggesting that the carboxyl-terminal tail of CXCR4 contains the necessary determinants for mediating degradation (data not shown). Analyses of carboxyl-terminal deletion mutants of CXCR4 suggested that a discrete region in the carboxyl terminus (324SSLKILSKGK333) contributed to degradation (data not shown). To determine the specific residues mediating degradation we generated receptors with specific mutations within this putative “degradation” motif (summarized in Fig.3 A). We have previously shown that mutation of the “dileucine” motif (I328A/L329A) or the two amino-terminal serine residues (S324A/S325A) within this region resulted in impaired internalization, whereas a serine 330 mutation (S330A) internalized normally (Ref. 16Parent J.-L. Labrecque P. Orsini M.J. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 272: 8941-8948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (174) Google Scholar and Fig. 3 B). We next examined whether these receptor mutants are degraded. The serine mutants were significantly attenuated in their ability to be degraded whereas degradation of the dileucine mutant was similar to that of wild type CXCR4 (Fig. 3 C). Because internalization of the dileucine mutant is only ∼40% that of wild type CXCR4, these results demonstrate that the rate-limiting step in CXCR4 degradation is the sorting to lysosomes, not internalization. Interestingly, the S330A mutant, which undergoes normal agonist-promoted internalization, is significantly attenuated in degradation suggesting that it is defective in a subsequent sorting step (Fig. 3 C). Similarly, the S324A/S325A mutant, which internalizes to the same extent as the dileucine mutant, appears to be completely defective in its ability to be degraded (Fig. 3 C). These results suggest a role for serines 324, 325, and 330 in the subsequent sorting of internalized CXCR4 to lysosomes. Ubiquitination, a process involving the covalent attachment of ubiquitin molecules to lysine residues (20Hershko A. Cierchanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6736) Google Scholar), has been shown to be important in the lysosomal degradation of several plasma membrane proteins (21Bonifacino J.S. Weissman A.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 19-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). We therefore examined the role of the lysine residues within the degradation motif in mediating CXCR4 degradation. A CXCR4 mutant with all three lysine residues changed to arginines internalized similarly to wild-type CXCR4 (Fig. 3 B). In striking contrast, this receptor mutant was completely attenuated in agonist-promoted degradation (Fig. 3 C). Because the lysine residues within the degradation motif clearly contribute to CXCR4 degradation, we next examined whether CXCR4 is ubiquitinated upon activation. HEK 293 cells were co-transfected with HA-tagged CXCR4 and FLAG-tagged ubiquitin, along with dynamin-1 K44A (which inhibits CXCR4 endocytosis and degradation, data not shown). Cells were treated with agonist for 30 min; then CXCR4 was immunoprecipitated using HA polyclonal antibodies and immunoblotted using a monoclonal antibody specific for the FLAG epitope. As shown in Fig. 4 A, an ∼54-kDa protein is observed in immunoprecipitates from cells expressing both receptor and ubiquitin but not observed in cells expressing receptor or ubiquitin alone. Moreover, the intensity of this band is significantly increased (typically 2–3-fold) by agonist treatment, strongly suggesting that the ∼54-kDa protein represents ubiquitinated CXCR4. The size of this protein relative to unmodified CXCR4 (∼44 kDa, Fig.4 A, lower panel) suggests a single ubiquitin molecule conjugated to the receptor (the ubiquitin construct used encodes an 11-kDa protein). To determine whether the lysine residues located within the degradation motif are sites for ubiquitination we tested whether the mutant receptor lacking all three lysine residues undergoes ubiquitination. This mutant was not ubiquitinated upon agonist activation indicating that these lysine residues represent sites at which ubiquitin can be attached to CXCR4 (Fig.4 B). Our data suggest a model in which agonist activation promotes rapid phosphorylation of CXCR4, most likely by a GRK (15Orsini M.J. Parent J.-L. Mundell S.J. Marchese A. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31076-31086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 18Haribabu B. Richardson R.M. Fisher I. Sozzani S. Peiper S.C. Horuk R. Ali H. Synderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28726-28731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of serine residues 324, 325, and/or 330 within the degradation motif may facilitate ubiquitination of neighboring lysine residue(s). CXCR4 is most likely ubiquitinated at the plasma membrane, as it occurs in the presence of dynamin-1 K44A, an effective inhibitor of CXCR4 endocytosis. Phosphorylation of CXCR4 also promotes arrestin binding which in turn mediates CXCR4 association with clathrin-coated pits and endocytosis (15Orsini M.J. Parent J.-L. Mundell S.J. Marchese A. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31076-31086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 19Cheng Z.-J. Zhao J. Sun Y. Hu W. Wu Y.-L. Cen B. Wu G.-X. Pei G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2479-2485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Although difficult to directly address, our results suggest that CXCR4 ubiquitination does not interfere with arrestin binding and the subsequent targeting of the receptor to clathrin-coated pits. However, ubiquitination of CXCR4 does not appear to contribute directly to endocytosis. The endocytosed ubiquitinated receptor is subsequently sorted to a degradative pathway via interaction with additional proteins that mediate lysosomal sorting. Given the importance of CXCR4 ubiquitination in this process, we speculate that such sorting molecules might directly bind to ubiquitinated proteins and target them for lysosomal degradation. Indeed, it has recently been reported that in yeast a protein complex, known as ESCRT-1, mediates ubiquitin-dependent sorting of proteins into the multivesicular body (22Katzmann D.J. Babst M. Emr S.D. Cell. 2001; 106: 145-155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar). Our findings with CXCR4 are somewhat reminiscent of the yeast α-mating factor receptor where agonist-dependent phosphorylation mediates receptor ubiquitination, internalization, and degradation (23Hicke L. Zanolari B. Riezman H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 349-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). However, one clear distinction between these pathways is that while monoubiquitination is involved in endocytosis of the α-mating factor receptor (24Terrell J. Shih S. Dunn R. Hicke L. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 193-202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar), ubiquitination of CXCR4 is not required for internalization. This may reflect mechanistic differences in the endocytic pathways; for example, CXCR4 utilizes arrestin for endocytosis (15Orsini M.J. Parent J.-L. Mundell S.J. Marchese A. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31076-31086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 19Cheng Z.-J. Zhao J. Sun Y. Hu W. Wu Y.-L. Cen B. Wu G.-X. Pei G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2479-2485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) whereas yeast cells do not express arrestins (25Mewes H.W. Albermann K. Bahr M. Frishman D. Gleissner A. Hani J. Heumann K. Kleine K. Maierl A. Oliver S.G. Pfeiffer F. Zollner A. Nature. 1997; 387: 7-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Recent studies also have shown that the δ-opioid receptor can be polyubiquitinated (26Chaturvedi K. Bandari P. Chinen N. Howells R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12345-12355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 27Petaja-Repo U.E. Hogue M. Laperriere A. Bhalla S. Walker P. Bouvier M. J. Biol.

Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12345-12355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) and may mediate proteosomal degradation of misfolded receptors (27Petaja-Repo U.E. Hogue M. Laperriere A. Bhalla S. Walker P. Bouvier M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4416-4423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). In summary, the present study establishes a clear link between ubiquitination and degradation of CXCR4. To our knowledge this represents the first report to demonstrate that ubiquitination of a mammalian GPCR is critical for agonist-dependent degradation. Our data suggest that monoubiquitination of a lysine residue within the carboxyl-terminal degradation motif of CXCR4 is involved in lysosomal sorting. This sorting event is likely mediated via interaction with an unidentified molecule that recognizes the monoubiquitinated form of CXCR4.

https://openalex.org/W1972059159,"The mechanism of action of acupuncture remains largely unknown. The reaction to acupuncture needling known as 'de qi', widely viewed as essential to the therapeutic effect of acupuncture, may be a key to understanding its mechanism of action. De qi includes a characteristic needling sensation, perceived by the patient, and 'needle grasp' perceived by the acupuncturist. During needle grasp, the acupuncturist feels pulling and increased resistance to further movement of the inserted needle. We hypothesize that 1) needle grasp is due to mechanical coupling between the needle and connective tissue with winding of tissue around the needle during needle rotation and 2) needle manipulation transmits a mechanical signal to connective tissue cells via mechanotransduction. Such a mechanism may explain local and remote, as well as long-term effects of acupuncture."

Because of the rapid thermalization of the two different atoms, the efficiency of the cooling process is high. The ability to achieve condensation by sympathetic cooling with a different species may provide a route to the production of degenerate systems with a larger choice of components."
https://openalex.org/W2051865375,"Electron hole (radical cation) migration in DNA, where the quantum transport of an injected charge is gated in a correlated manner by the thermal motions of the hydrated counterions, is described here. Classical molecular dynamics simulations in conjunction with large-scale first-principles electronic structure calculations reveal that different counterion configurations lead to formation of states characterized by varying spatial distributions and degrees of charge localization. Stochastic dynamic fluctuations between such ionic configurations can induce correlated changes in the spatial distribution of the hole, with concomitant transport along the DNA double helix. Comparative ultraviolet light-induced cleavage experiments on native B DNA oligomers and on ones modified to contain counterion (Na(+))-starved bridges between damage-susceptible hole-trapping sites called GG steps show in the latter a reduction in damage at the distal step. This reduction indicates a reduced mobility of the hole across the modified bridge as predicted theoretically."
https://openalex.org/W2041975117,"Subduction is a major process of plate tectonics; however, its initiation is not understood. We used high-resolution (less than 1 kilometer) finite-element models based on rheological data of the lithosphere to investigate the role played by water on initiating subduction. A solid-fluid thermomechanical instability is needed to drive a cold, stiff, and negatively buoyant lithosphere into the mantle. This instability can be triggered slowly by sedimentary loading over a time span of 100 million years. Our results indicate that subduction can proceed by a double feedback mechanism (thermoelastic and thermal-rheological) promoted by lubrication due to water."

In plants, the compounds exist in free form and as conjugates to a wide range of other metabolites such as glucose, which can be attached to the carboxyl group or to specific hydroxyl groups on the benzene ring. These glucosylation reactions have been studied for many years, but to date only one gene encoding a benzoate glucosyltransferase has been cloned. A phylogenetic analysis of sequences in theArabidopsis genome revealed a large multigene family of putative glycosyltransferases containing a consensus sequence typically found in enzymes transferring glucose to small molecular weight compounds such as secondary metabolites. Ninety of these sequences have now been expressed as recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli, and their in vitro catalytic activities toward benzoates have been analyzed. The data show that only 14 proteins display activity toward 2-hydroxybenzoic acid, 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, and 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid. Of these, only two enzymes are active toward 2-hydroxybenzoic acid, suggesting they are theArabidopsis salicylic acid glucosyltransferases. All of the enzymes forming glucose esters with the metabolites were located in Group L of the phylogenetic tree, whereas those formingO-glucosides were dispersed among five different groups. Catalytic activities were observed toward glucosylation of the 2-, 3-, or 4-hydroxyl group on the ring. To further explore their regioselectivity, the 14 enzymes were analyzed against benzoic acid, 3-hydroxybenzoic acid, 2,3-, 2,4-, 2,5-, and 2,6-dihydroxybenzoic acid. The data showed that glycosylation of specific sites could be positively or negatively influenced by the presence of additional hydroxyl groups on the ring.

Analysis of sequence homology has led to the classification of 54 families with a ubiquitous distribution throughout living organisms (7Henrissat B. Davies G.J. Plant Physiol. 2000; 124: 1515-1519Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). One of the largest families is Family 1, in which many of its members contain a consensus sequence found toward the C termini of the proteins thought to be related to nucleoside diphosphate-sugar binding (8Ross J. Li Y. Lim E.-K. Bowles D.J. Genome Biol. 2001; 2 (reviews): 3004.1-3004.6Crossref Google Scholar). In a study of mammalian enzymes, the consensus has been used to define a large multigene family of UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (5Mackenzie P.I. Owen I.S. Burchell B. Bock K.W. Bairoch A. Bélanger A. Fournel-Gigleux S. Green M. Hum D.W. Iyanagi T. Lancet D. Louisot P. Magdalou J. Chowdhury J.R. Ritter J.K. Schachter H. Tephly T.R. Tipton K.F. Nebert D.W. Pharmacogenetics. 1997; 7: 255-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (992) Google Scholar). In plant species, many enzymes are known that also contain this consensus sequence, but in contrast to the mammalian enzymes, the plant enzymes generally use UDP-glucose as the donor in the transfer reaction (1Hostel W.

Plant Sci. 1991; 74: 73-80Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Transfer of a sugar onto the acceptor molecule can lead to changes in the activity of the acceptor as well as changes in its subcellular localization. For example, glucosylation of plant hormones such as auxins, abscisic acid, and gibberellins inactivates their biological activity (10Kleczkowski K. Schell J. Crit. Rev. Plant Sci. 1995; 14: 283-298Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Once conjugated, the glycosylated acceptor can exit the cytosol and enter a membrane compartment through recognition by transporters, such as those identified in the tonoplast membrane of the vacuole, which is considered to be the major compartment for storage of the glucoconjugates (reviewed in Ref.13Rea P.A. J. Exp. Bot. 1999; 50: 895-913Crossref Google Scholar).Recently, we have used the consensus sequence to screen the genome data base of Arabidopsis to identify the number of putative enzymes of this class in a single plant species (14Li Y. Baldauf S. Lim E.-K. Bowles D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4338-4343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). We discovered the existence of a large multigene family composed of 107 sequences (8Ross J. Li Y. Lim E.-K. Bowles D.J. Genome Biol. 2001; 2 (reviews): 3004.1-3004.6Crossref Google Scholar). As one means of gaining an understanding of their potential functions, we have expressed the sequences in Escherichia coli and screened recombinant proteins for catalytic activity in vitro. This has led to the identification of genes encoding enzymes that glucosylate the monolignol precursors of lignin (15Lim E.-K. Li Y. Parr A. Jackson R.G. Ashford D.A. Bowles D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4344-4349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) and two auxins, indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and indole butyric acid (16Jackson R.G. Lim E.-K. Li Y.

The studies have established a foundation for understanding the physiological role of the enzymes, their substrates, and their productsin planta. For example, overexpression of the gene encoding UGT84B1, forming the glucose ester of IAA and indole butyric acidin vitro, produced transgenic Arabidopsis lines displaying a typical auxin-deficient phenotype. Application of 2,4-D, an auxin homologue not recognized as a substrate by the UGT, recovered the transgenic lines to a wild-type phenotype. 2R. G. Jackson, M. Kowalczyk, Y. Li, G. Higgins, J.

There is considerable interest in these compounds, both from the perspective of their functions in the plant, such as the role of salicylic acid in defense responses (reviewed in Ref. 18Alvarez M.E. Plant Mol. Biol. 2000; 44: 429-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), and from their potential utility in biotechnological applications, such as the use of 4-hydroxybenzoic acid (4-HBA) as a polyester precursor and 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid (3,4-DHBA) as an antioxidant (19Dong D.

Benzoates also offer an excellent opportunity to explore the regioselectivity of glucosylation given that hydroxylation can occur at any position on the benzene ring and a wide variety of compounds are available for use as potential substrates. The position of hydroxyl groups is known to influence many properties of the molecules, such as their polarity and their ability to scavenge free radicals (23Rice-Evans C.A. Miller N.J. Paganga G.

Naturally occurring compounds are known in which the ortho (2-OH, 6-OH), meta (3-OH, 5-OH), and para (4-OH) hydroxyl groups are glucosylated (26Lee H.-I. Raskin I. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 88: 692-697Google Scholar, 27Lee H.-I. Raskin I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36637-36642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 28Yamanaka M. Shimomura K.

Tetrahedron. 1959; 7: 252-256Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Glucose esters of aglycones are considered to be biosynthetic intermediates in which the high energy of the glucose ester drives transfer of the aglycone onto a further acceptor (32Mock H.P. Strack D. Phytochemistry. 1993; 32: 575-579Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar). For example, in phenylpropanoid metabolism inArabidopsis, there is good evidence that formation of sinapoyl glucose ester is an intermediate step in the synthesis of sinapoylmalate and sinapoylcholine (33Sharma V. Strack D. Planta. 1985; 163: 563-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 34Strack D. Knogge W. Dahlbender B. Z. Naturforsch. 1983; 38: 1-27Google Scholar, 35Strack D. Planta. 1982; 155: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 36Strack D. Z. Pflanzenphysiol. 1977; 84: 139-145Crossref Google Scholar). Similarly, in maize the glucose ester of IAA is an intermediate in the formation of IAA-myo-inositol (37Michalczuk L. Bandurski R.S. Biochem. J. 1982; 207: 273-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In contrast, O-glucosides are thought to be more stable forms of the aglycones and often are those that are transported either from the cytosol into membrane compartments or throughout the plant (1Hostel W. The Biochemistry of Plants. 7. Academic Press, Inc., New York1981: 725-753Google Scholar). In this context, inhibition of the synthesis of the naphthoquinone pigment shikonin leads to abnormally high levels of 4-HBA in the cytosol that is subsequently detoxified by glucosylation and transported into the vacuole (38Bechthold A. Berger U. Heide L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 288: 39-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 39Heide L. Nishioka N. Fukui H. Tabata M.

Kataoka M. Tabata M. Phytochemistry. 1995; 38: 1127-1130Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar).In this study we have screened the activity of 90 recombinant UGTs toward a panel of three model benzoates chosen for their biological relevance and position of their hydroxyl groups on the ring. The 14 UGTs that displayed activities toward these three compounds have been further analyzed against additional substrates (Fig.1) to confirm the regioselectivity of their catalytic activities.DISCUSSIONPlant glucosyltransferases such as those involved in cytoplasmic glycosylation typically transfer glucose from UDP-glucose to small acceptor molecules. There is considerable interest currently in this class of enzymes because they offer a simple means of regioselective glycosylation that is extremely difficult to achieve by chemical synthesis. The enzymes also offer a potential means to engineer pathways of secondary metabolism in plants and thereby to use the synthetic capacity of crops to manipulate novel industrial products. Despite these opportunities, comparatively few glycosyltransferases have been purified from plant extracts, and even fewer numbers have been cloned (reviewed in Refs. 8Ross J. Li Y. Lim E.-K. Bowles D.J. Genome Biol. 2001; 2 (reviews): 3004.1-3004.6Crossref Google Scholar and 9Jones P. Vogt T. Planta. 2001; 213: 164-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Traditionally, the route to gaining glycosyltransferase genes has been purification of the enzyme and use of its sequence. This approach can involve many years of work, particularly when the enzymes are present in negligible amounts in the plant. Nevertheless, despite these obstacles, the genes corresponding to salicylic acid glucosyltransferase (27Lee H.-I. Raskin I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36637-36642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), flavonol-3-O-glucosyltransferase (44Miller K.D. Guyon V. Evans J.N.S. Shuttleworth W.A. Taylor L.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34011-34019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), and betanidin-5-O-glucosyltransferase (45Vogt T. Grimm R. Strack D. Plant J. 1999; 19: 509-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) are good examples of where the approach has led to considerable benefits.An alternative approach is to apply techniques of bioinformatics to screen genomic and EST data bases to identify sequences that may correspond to those encoding functional enzymes. This approach is made easier with the completion of a genome-sequencing program of many organisms. In this context, analysis of the completed genome ofArabidopsis revealed 107 sequences containing a consensus motif that suggested they correspond to glycosyltransferases (8Ross J. Li Y. Lim E.-K. Bowles D.J. Genome Biol. 2001; 2 (reviews): 3004.1-3004.6Crossref Google Scholar, 14Li Y. Baldauf S. Lim E.-K. Bowles D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4338-4343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar) such as those that conjugate hormones, secondary metabolites, and xenobiotics. As a means of defining whether these sequences corresponded to functional enzymes and identifying their potential substrates, recombinant proteins produced in E. coli were screened for catalytic activities in vitro. This strategy led to the first identification of genes encoding glucosyltransferases of the lignin precursors including coniferyl alcohol and sinapyl alcohol (15Lim E.-K. Li Y. Parr A. Jackson R.G. Ashford D.A. Bowles D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4344-4349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The studies have also demonstrated that functional annotation in multigene families can be misleading both through misannotation and through the lack of predictability of function through sequence homology. For example, the IAA glucosyltransferase ofArabidopsis did not correspond to any of the sequences previously annotated with this activity, including that with the greatest sequence homology to the maize iaglu sequence (16Jackson R.G. Lim E.-K. Li Y. Kowalczyk M. Sandberg G. Hoggett J. Ashford D.A. Bowles D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4350-4356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar).In the present study we have applied the strategy of in vitro screening for catalytic activities toward another class of natural products, the benzoates. This class includes many compounds of interest, both for their known activities in the plant and their potential applications. For example, 2-HBA, commonly known as salicylic acid, is important in plant defense responses and is known to up- and down-regulate a wide spectrum of genes (46Glazebrook J. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2001; 4: 301-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). Glucosylation of salicylic acid in planta has been well characterized, although the function(s) of the glucoside and glucose ester remain obscure (26Lee H.-I. Raskin I. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 88: 692-697Google Scholar, 27Lee H.-I. Raskin I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36637-36642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). It has been speculated that glucosylation represents detoxification of salicylic acid. Another benzoate, 4-HBA, has attracted considerable interest due to its potential as a polyester precursor (19Dong D. Jiang S. Ni Y. Jiang B. Eur. Polym. J. 2001; 37: 611-617Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The compound is also the precursor in planta of shikonin, a natural pigment of commercial relevance (for review, see Ref. 47Papageorgiou V.P. Assimopoulou A.N. Couladouros E.A. Hepworth D. Nicolaou K.C. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 1999; 38: 270-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). Whereas 4-HBA is a cytoplasmic component, its O-glucoside is located in the vacuole (41Yazaki K. Inushima K. Kataoka M. Tabata M. Phytochemistry. 1995; 38: 1127-1130Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar). This change in subcellular compartmentation is considered to be part of the detoxification process but, significantly, is also a potential mechanism for increasing yield through the removal of product from the cytoplasmic reaction mixture. 3,4-DHBA is yet another commercially interesting benzoate because of its antioxidant activity (21Nakamura Y. Torikai K. Ohigashi H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 30: 967-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Glucosylation is also relevant to this application, given observations that glucosides of antioxidant aglycones have increased bioavailability in the diet (48Nishimura T. Kometani T. Takii H. Terada Y. Okada S. J. Ferment. Bioeng. 1995; 80: 18-23Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 49Hollman P.C.H. van Trijp J.M.P. Buysman M.N.C.P. van der Gaag M.S. Mengelers M.J.B. de Vries J.H.M. Katan M.B. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 152-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). The glycosyltransferases involved in the conjugation of these three compounds have been studied over many years. In the case of 2-HBA, the enzyme has been purified to homogeneity from tobacco extracts and used to identify its corresponding gene. The recombinant protein was assayedin vitro and shown to form the glucose ester in preference to the O-glucoside (27Lee H.-I. Raskin I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36637-36642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). For 4-HBA, an enzyme has been purified from L. erythrorhizon, but as yet the gene has not been cloned (50Li S.-M. Wang Z.-X. Heide L. Phytochemistry. 1997; 46: 27-32Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Work on glucosyltransferases of 3,4-DHBA is even less developed; the product has been identified in plant extracts, but the enzyme has not been studied.Using the three benzoates in a preliminary screen of 90 recombinant proteins from the Arabidopsis multigene family, we have now identified 14 genes encoding enzymes with catalytic activity toward one or more of these substrates. The study has highlighted a regioselectivity exhibited by the plant glycosyltransferases that is maintained in vitro. For example, only two of the enzymes can glucosylate the 2-OH position of the benzene ring, UGT74F1 and UGT74F2. Although one of the two, UGT74F2, can also glucosylate the carboxyl group of salicylic acid, UGT74F1 is highly specific forO-glucoside formation. Interestingly, if the tobacco UGT of salicylic acid is used to search the phylogenetic tree ofArabidopsis sequences, the branch of the tree that is identified is precisely that containing UGT74F1 and UGT74F2 (data not shown). This correct prediction of function from sequence homology contrasts with that described earlier for the IAA glucosyltransferase (16Jackson R.G. Lim E.-K. Li Y. Kowalczyk M. Sandberg G. Hoggett J. Ashford D.A. Bowles D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4350-4356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). By comparing the biochemistry of the catalytic activity of the tobacco and Arabidopsis UGTs toward salicylic acid, it is possible that UGT74F2 is the orthologue of the tobacco gene.In contrast to the selectivity of UGT74F1 and UGT74F2 for the 2-OH position, many more enzymes were found to be selective for either the 3-OH position or the 4-OH position. In the case ofO-glucoside synthesis as well as the synthesis of glucose esters, the in vitro activity of the enzymes was found to be strongly influenced by the relative position of additional hydroxyl groups to the glucosylation site. The influence could be positive or negative, since examples for each were observed.This study demonstrates the utility of a screening strategy to identify novel glycosyltransferases that are active toward substrates of importance. As such, a foundation is established for using the enzymes as regioselective biocatalysts or further refining their catalytic activities by forced evolution of their corresponding genes. Their use in biotransformation is made more feasible by methods newly available for high yielding enzyme-catalyzed synthesis of the UDP-glucose substrate (51Ma X. Stöckigt J. Carbohydr. Res. 2001; 333: 159-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Similarly, a knowledge of catalytic activity in vitro also provides a new foundation for understanding the role of the enzymes in the plant. In this context, overexpression of the IAA glucosyltransferase proved sufficient to deregulate auxin homeostasis.2 In a similar manner, it should now be possible to determine the consequences of deregulating salicylic acid homeostasis in Arabidopsis and to study changes in the progress of plant defense responses. Also, importantly, combining overexpression of bacterial enzymes and the relevant plant glucosyltransferases such as in the synthesis and conjugation of 4-HBA (17Siebert M. Sommer S. Li S.-M.

Glycosyltransferases catalyze the transfer of sugar from nucleoside diphosphate donors to a wide range of acceptor molecules (1Hostel W. The Biochemistry of Plants. 7.

Analysis of sequence homology has led to the classification of 54 families with a ubiquitous distribution throughout living organisms (7Henrissat B. Davies G.J. Plant Physiol. 2000; 124: 1515-1519Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). One of the largest families is Family 1, in which many of its members contain a consensus sequence found toward the C termini of the proteins thought to be related to nucleoside diphosphate-sugar binding (8Ross J. Li Y. Lim E.-K. Bowles D.J. Genome Biol. 2001; 2 (reviews): 3004.1-3004.6Crossref Google Scholar). In a study of mammalian enzymes, the consensus has been used to define a large multigene family of UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (5Mackenzie P.I. Owen I.S. Burchell B. Bock K.W. Bairoch A. Bélanger A. Fournel-Gigleux S. Green M. Hum D.W. Iyanagi T. Lancet D. Louisot P. Magdalou J. Chowdhury J.R. Ritter J.K. Schachter H. Tephly T.R. Tipton K.F. Nebert D.W. Pharmacogenetics. 1997; 7: 255-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (992) Google Scholar). In plant species, many enzymes are known that also contain this consensus sequence, but in contrast to the mammalian enzymes, the plant enzymes generally use UDP-glucose as the donor in the transfer reaction (1Hostel W.

Transfer of a sugar onto the acceptor molecule can lead to changes in the activity of the acceptor as well as changes in its subcellular localization. For example, glucosylation of plant hormones such as auxins, abscisic acid, and gibberellins inactivates their biological activity (10Kleczkowski K. Schell J. Crit. Rev.

https://openalex.org/W2086258149,"We investigated the mechanisms responsible for the anti-lipolytic effect of intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) in human adipocytes. Increasing [Ca2+]i inhibited lipolysis induced by b-adrenergic receptor activation, A1 adenosine receptor inhibition, adenylate cyclase activation, and phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibition, as well as by a hydrolyzable cAMP analog, but not by a nonhydrolyzable cAMP analog. This finding indicates that the anti-lipolytic effect of [Ca2+]i may be mediated by the activation of adipocyte PDE. Consistent with this theory, [Ca2+]i inhibition of isoproterenol-stimulated lipolysis was reversed completely by the nonselective PDE inhibitor isobutyl methylxanthine and also by the selective PDE 3B inhibitor cilostamide, but not by selective PDE 1 and 4 inhibitors. In addition, phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase inhibition with wortmannin completely prevented insulin's anti-lipolytic effect but only minimally blocked [Ca2+]i's effect, which suggests that [Ca2+]i and insulin may activate PDE 3B via different mechanisms. In contrast, the antilipolytic effect of [Ca2+]i was not affected by inhibitors of calmodulin, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase, protein phosphatase 2B, and protein kinase C. Finally, [Ca2+]i inhibited significantly isoproterenol-stimulated increases in cAMP levels and hormone-sensitive lipase phosphorylation in human adipocytes. In conclusion, increasing [Ca2+]i exerts an antilipolytic effect mainly by activation of PDE, leading to a decrease in cAMP and HSL phosphorylation and, consequently, inhibition of lipolysis."

Rhodopsin, the major membrane protein of rod outer segments, is present in both the flattened (lamellar) region of disc membranes and the plasma membrane. The molecular mechanisms responsible for the targeting of specific proteins to the disc and plasma membrane and protein/protein interactions involved in the formation and stabilization of the unique ROS structure are not known.

In this study, synthetic peptides containing each of four proline-containing repeat regions were coupled to Sepharose beads and used as an affinity matrix to identify GARP-binding proteins. In this approach, the cGMP-gated channel, guanylate cyclase, ABCR, phosphodiesterase, GARP-1, and GARP-2 all bound to these peptides. On the basis of these studies, it was concluded that GARP organizes cGMP signaling proteins and ABCR into a large multiprotein complex in ROS (20Korschen H.G. Beyermann M. Muller F. Heck M.

Although peptide affinity chromatography has been used to investigate protein interactions, such an approach is prone to artifacts arising from nonspecific interactions. We have used highly specific monoclonal antibodies in conjunction with immunoprecipitation, cross-linking, and electrophoretic techniques to identify ROS membrane proteins that interact with GARP proteins. Here, we report that the cGMP-gated channel and soluble GARP proteins specifically associate with peripherin-2-containing oligomeric complexes at the rim region of disc membranes, but not with ABCR or guanylate cyclase. In addition, we show that the cGMP-gated channel interacts with the Na/Ca-K exchanger in the ROS plasma membrane, in agreement with earlier studies (21Molday R.S. Molday L.L.

These results suggest that GARP-mediated protein/protein interactions between the channel·exchanger complex in the ROS plasma membrane and peripherin-2 complexes in the rim region of disc membranes play a role in maintaining the spatial arrangement of the disc and plasma membrane in ROS and anchoring the channel·exchanger complex in the ROS plasma membrane. ROS were isolated from frozen bovine retinas by sucrose gradient centrifugation under dim red light as described previously (1Molday R.S. Molday L.L. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2589-2601Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). ROS membranes were separated from soluble proteins as follows. ROS (1 mg) were suspended in 0.2 ml of lysis buffer (2 mm HEPES and 2 mm EGTA, pH 7.4, with or without 10 mmdithiothreitol (DTT)) and incubated for 1 h on ice. The soluble fraction was separated from the membranes by centrifugation at 87,000 × g for 10 min. The membrane pellet was resuspended in 0.2 ml of lysis buffer, incubated for 30 min on ice, and washed by centrifugation. This procedure was repeated two more times. ROS membranes were finally suspended in 0.2 ml of lysis buffer. ROS membranes were digested with trypsin as previously described (1Molday R.S. Molday L.L. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2589-2601Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Briefly, bovine ROS membranes (2 mg/ml protein) in 0.01 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, were digested with an equal volume of trypsin (0.8 μg/ml) for 30 min at 4 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of excess soybean trypsin inhibitor, and the membranes were washed by centrifugation as described above. Monoclonal antibodies were generated against glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins containing either the N-terminal 16 amino acids (Garp 8G8 and Garp 4B1) or the C-terminal 12 amino acids (Garp 1H5) of truncated GARP-2 (17Colville C.A.

Cross-linking experiments were performed on either dark-adapted ROS under dim red light or light-adapted ROS under normal room lighting. ROS were washed with 20 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.5, 0.15 m KCl, and 20% (w/v) sucrose by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm (7800 ×g) in a Beckman TLA100 rotor for 8 min and resuspended at a protein concentration of 2.2 mg/ml. Cross-linking was carried out by adding a 10× stock solution of dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate) (DSP) in dimethyl sulfoxide to the samples on ice. After 2 h, the reaction was terminated by the addition of an equal volume of stop buffer (0.1 m Tris-HCl and 0.5 m glycine, pH 7.5). ROS were centrifuged at 7800 × g for 8 min, resuspended in stop buffer at a protein concentration of 0.5 mg/ml, incubated for 30 min on ice, and centrifuged again. Untreated or cross-linked ROS pellets were resuspended at a protein concentration of 2 mg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 0.01 m sodium phosphate and 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.4) or HEPES/KCl (10 mm HEPES and 0.15 m KCl, pH 7.4). ROS were solubilized by the dropwise addition of an equal volume of 2% Triton X-100 in PBS or 30 mm CHAPS in 10 mm HEPES, 0.15 m KCl, and 0.2 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The solution was stirred for 30 min at 4 °C and centrifuged at 87,000 × g for 15 min to remove any residual unsolubilized material. The antibody-Sepharose 2B matrix was washed four times with 0.3 ml of PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100 or 15 mm CHAPS by low speed centrifugation in a Millipore Ultrafree MC 0.45-μm filter unit. The detergent-solubilized ROS solution (0.75 mg of protein) was incubated with 100 μl of Sepharose matrix with gentle agitation for 40 min at 4 °C. The unbound protein was recovered by low speed centrifugation, and the matrix was washed four times with 0.3 ml of 0.2% Triton X-100 or 15 mm CHAPS in PBS to remove unbound protein from the matrix. Finally, the matrix was incubated at room temperature for 20–30 min with 30–50 μl of 0.2% Triton X-100 or 10 mm CHAPS in PBS containing the competing peptide or 2% SDS. This procedure was repeated, and the two eluted fractions were combined to produce the bound fraction. Competing peptides were as follows: 0.1 mg/ml DAGQAPAAG for the Per 2B6 antibody, 1 mg/ml MLGWVQRVLPQPPGTPQ for the Garp 8G8 antibody, 0.4 mg/ml YDLPLHPRA for the Rim 3F4 antibody, and 1 mg/ml SNKEQEQKEKKKKK for the PMc 6E7 antibody. Untreated or cross-linked ROS membranes were resuspended in PBS at a concentration of 6 mg/ml of protein. An equal volume of 1% (w/v) SDS, 0.1 m N-ethylmaleimide, and 0.2 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added, and the mixture was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C on a shaker. After centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 15 °C, the supernatant was diluted 10-fold in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and incubated with the antibody-Sepharose matrix for 3 h at 4 °C on a rocker. The antibody-Sepharose matrix was then washed with the same buffer to collect the unbound protein. The bound protein was eluted with competing peptides as described above or with 4% SDS. ROS were solubilized in Triton X-100 and immunoprecipitated as described above. To quantify the fraction of Rom-1 and peripherin-2 that was bound to GARP, solubilized ROS were added to Garp 8G8-Sepharose, and the unbound fraction was then added to Per 2B6-Sepharose. To quantify the fraction of GARP in complex with peripherin-2 and Rom-1, solubilized ROS were incubated with Per 2B6-Sepharose to quantitatively bind peripherin-2, and the unbound fraction was then added to Garp 8G8-Sepharose to bind GARP. The bound protein was eluted from the Sepharose matrix with 4% SDS for 15 min at room temperature. Fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting for ECL. The exposed film was scanned with a laser densitometer to determine the ratio of coprecipitated and free proteins for GARP, peripherin-2, and Rom-1. Samples were denatured with an equal volume of loading buffer (4% SDS, 0.02 mTris-HCl, pH 6.8, 40% sucrose, 0.01% bromphenol blue, and 10% β-mercaptoethanol) and routinely separated on an 8% polyacrylamide gel (28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205523) Google Scholar). Proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) in a semidry transfer apparatus using the buffer system of Towbin et al. (29Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44643) Google Scholar). The membranes were labeled with hybridoma culture supernatant containing the primary monoclonal antibody and peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse immunoglobulin for detection by ECL (Amersham Biosciences, Inc., Baie d’Urfé, Quebec, Canada). Untreated or DTT-treated ROS were solubilized in Triton X-100, incubated with Per 2B6-Sepharose or Garp 8G8-Sepharose, and eluted from the matrix with a competing peptide as described above. After the addition of glycerol (final concentration of ∼20%), the samples were applied to a 4% polyacrylamide stacking gel and a linear 5–13% acrylamide separation gel (dimensions of 16 × 18 × 0.1 cm). Blue native electrophoresis was performed as described (30Schagger H. Cramer W.A. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 217: 220-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar). Electrophoresis was started with a cathode buffer containing 0.02% Coomassie Blue G-250. After one-third of the run, the buffer was changed to a cathode buffer containing 0.002% Coomassie Blue G-250. Immunoblotting of the native gels on two sheets of Immobilon-P membranes and background destaining were carried out as described (31Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 199: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (1881) Google Scholar). ROS were washed three times with 0.25 ml of PBS/mg of protein by centrifugation and resuspended at 2 mg/ml in PBS with or without 10 mm DTT. After 90 min at room temperature, an equal volume of ice-cold solubilization buffer (2% Triton X-100, 0.2 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 80 mm N-ethylmaleimide in PBS) was added. The samples were stirred for 30 min at 4 °C, centrifuged at 87,000 × g for 30 min, solubilized in Triton X-100, and immunoprecipitated as described above. An immunoaffinity matrix consisting of a monoclonal antibody (Garp 8G8) to the N terminus of GARP coupled to Sepharose 2B was used to identify ROS proteins that coprecipitate with GARP proteins. In these experiments, detergent-solubilized ROS were mixed with the Garp 8G8 immunoaffinity matrix, and the unbound and bound (Garp 8G8 peptide-eluted) fractions were analyzed on Western blots labeled with monoclonal antibodies to various ROS proteins. The results are shown for light-adapted ROS solubilized in Triton X-100 (Fig. 1, A–C). Similar results were obtained for dark-adapted, Triton X-100-solubilized ROS and for light- and dark-adapted, CHAPS-solubilized ROS. Fig. 1 A shows an SDS gel stained with Coomassie Blue and a Western blot labeled with the GARP N terminus-specific antibody. The detergent extract and unbound fraction showed a similar Coomassie Blue-stained protein profile. The bound fraction had two moderately stained polypeptides with apparent molecular masses of 63 and 240 kDa corresponding to the α- and β-subunits of the cGMP-gated channel, respectively (see below). Several less intensely stained polypeptides were also observed. Western blots labeled with the Garp 4B1 antibody showed that the three GARP proteins, the β-subunit of the channel (240 kDa), GARP-1 (140 kDa), and GARP-2 (62 kDa), quantitatively bound to the GARP immunoaffinity matrix and were eluted with the competing Garp 8G8 peptide. Westerns blots of the fractions from the Garp 8G8 affinity matrix were also labeled with antibodies to various ROS proteins to identify proteins that coprecipitate with GARP variants. The PMb 3C9 antibody against the C terminus of the channel β-subunit and the Garp 1H5 antibody against the unique C terminus of GARP-2 confirmed that the β-subunit of the channel and the GARP-2 protein quantitatively bound to the affinity matrix (Fig. 1 B). The 63-kDa α-subunit of the cGMP-gated channel also quantitatively bound to the Garp 8G8 matrix, a result consistent with earlier studies showing that the α-subunit of the cGMP-gated channel interacts strongly with the β-subunit to form a heteromeric complex (15Chen T.Y.

The Na/Ca-K exchanger was detected in both the unbound and eluted fractions of the immunoaffinity matrix, indicating that a significant fraction of the exchanger is associated with the channel in detergent solution, in agreement with several earlier studies (21Molday R.S. Molday L.L. Vision Res. 1998; 38: 1315-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 22Bauer P.J. Drechsler M. J. Physiol.

Interestingly, a significant fraction of peripherin-2 and Rom-1, two homologous tetra-spanning membrane proteins that assemble into multimeric complexes in the rim region and incisures of disc membranes, coprecipitated with the GARP proteins (Fig. 1 B). Monomeric bovine peripherin-2 typically migrated on SDS gels as a major 35-kDa and a minor 37-kDa species, presumably due to differences in the extent of N-linked glycosylation, whereas Rom-1, which is not glycosylated, migrated as a single species. In addition, a small amount of SDS-resistant peripherin-2 dimer was observed when large amounts of untreated or cross-linked sample were applied to the gel (Fig. 1,B and C). The possible interaction of two other disc membrane proteins, ABCR and guanylate cyclase (RetGC-1), with GARP proteins was also investigated. As shown in Fig. 1 B, ABCR and RetGC-1 were detected only in the unbound fraction from the GARP immunoaffinity column, indicating that these proteins do not form stable associations with GARP proteins in detergent solution. Chemical cross-linking was carried out to further evaluate these protein/protein interactions. In these studies, ROS were treated with the disulfide-cleavable cross-linker DSP prior to detergent solubilization and immunoprecipitation on a Garp 8G8-Sepharose matrix. The samples were subsequently subjected to SDS gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions. As indicated in Fig. 1 C, the coprecipitation profiles obtained from DSP-cross-linked ROS were generally similar to those of untreated ROS. However, cross-linking had an effect of increasing the amount of peripherin-2 and, to a lesser extent, the Na/Ca-K exchanger that coprecipitated with GARP proteins. Cross-linking also resulted in the appearance of additional higher molecular mass proteins in some instances (β-subunit, GARP-2, and peripherin-2) presumably due to incomplete dissociation of the cross-linked products. An immunoaffinity matrix consisting of monoclonal antibody PMc 6E7 to the cGMP-gated channel α-subunit coupled to Sepharose was used to identify ROS proteins that coprecipitate with the channel. As shown in Fig.2, both the α- and β-subunits of the cGMP-gated channel quantitatively bound to the matrix. Peripherin-2 and the Na/Ca-K exchanger were detected in both the unbound and bound fractions, indicating that a significant fraction of these proteins is associated with the channel complex in detergent solution. In contrast, truncated GARP-2, ABCR, and guanylate cyclase (RetGC-1) were detected only in the unbound fraction, indicating that these proteins do not associate with the channel. The interaction of GARP proteins and peripherin-2 was further examined using a peripherin-2 immunoaffinity matrix. Untreated and DSP-cross-linked ROS were solubilized in detergent and added to a Per 2B6-Sepharose matrix, and the unbound and bound (Per 2B6 peptide-eluted) fractions were analyzed on Western blots labeled with anti-GARP and anti-peripherin-2 antibodies. As shown in Fig.3 A, a significant fraction of both GARP-2 and the cGMP-gated channel β-subunit coeluted with peripherin-2 with or without prior DSP cross-linking. To further confirm the existence of covalent cross-links between the GARP proteins and peripherin-2, we developed a method to immunoprecipitate cross-linked proteins that had been solubilized in SDS. In this procedure, DSP-cross-linked ROS membranes were solubilized in SDS to disrupt noncovalent protein interactions, diluted in Triton X-100-containing buffer to reduce the SDS concentration, and immunoprecipitated on a peripherin-2 immunoaffinity matrix. As shown in Fig. 3 B, GARP proteins coprecipitated with peripherin-2 only when ROS were cross-linked with DSP prior to SDS solubilization. The percentage of total ROS peripherin-2 and Rom-1 that coprecipitates with GARP-2 was determined. This was carried out by comparing the amount of peripherin-2 and Rom-1 in the bound and unbound fractions from a Garp 8G8 immunoaffinity matrix. Since rhodopsin interferes with the transfer of peripherin-2 and, to a lesser extent, Rom-1, the amount of these proteins in the unbound fraction was determined after adsorption to a peripherin-2 (Per 2B6) affinity matrix. Using this approach, 8.8 ± 3.1% of peripherin-2 and 8.9 ± 2.7"
https://openalex.org/W2043553700,"A change in the efficiency of synaptic communication between neurons is thought to underlie learning. Consistent with recent studies of such changes, we find that long-lasting potentiation of synaptic transmission between cultured hippocampal neurons is accompanied by an increase in the number of clusters of postsynaptic glutamate receptors containing the subunit GluR1. In addition, potentiation is accompanied by a rapid and long-lasting increase in the number of clusters of the presynaptic protein synaptophysin and the number of sites at which synaptophysin and GluR1 are colocalized. These results suggest that potentiation involves rapid coordinate changes in the distribution of proteins in the presynaptic neuron as well as the postsynaptic neuron."
https://openalex.org/W2091639801,"The p53 tumor suppressor is a transcription factor that regulates cell growth and death in response to environmental stimuli such as DNA damage. p63/p51 andp73 were recently identified as members of the p53gene family. In contrast to p53 however, p63and p73 are rarely mutated in human cancers. Mice that lack p53 are developmentally normal, while p63 and p73 appear to play critical roles in normal development. To determine how p63 and p73 are involved in normal development, we attempted to identify target genes that are specifically regulated by p63 and/or p73 but not by p53. We found that the Jagged1 (JAG1) andJagged2 (JAG2) genes, encoding ligands for the Notch receptors, are up-regulated by p63 and p73. Furthermore, we identified a p63-binding site in the second intron of the JAG1gene, which can directly interact with the p63 protein in vivo, as assessed by a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. A heterologous reporter assay revealed that this p63-binding site is a functional response element and is specific for p63. We also found a target of Notch signaling, HES-1 was up-regulated in Jurkat cells, in which Notch1 is highly expressed, when co-cultured with p63-transfected cells, suggesting that p63 can trigger the Notch signal pathway in neighboring cells. Our findings show an association between the p53 family genes and Notch signaling and suggest a potential molecular mechanism for the involvement of the p53family genes in normal development."

A Drosophila melanogaster model system was developed that increased experimental power with the use of high experimental replication, explicit tracking of individual genes, and high but natural levels of background selection.

An intrinsic advantage to recombination was demonstrated by the finding that the realized strength of selection on new mutations was markedly increased when recombination was present."

Both in vitro andin vivo co-immunoprecipitation and yeast two-hybrid studies further demonstrate interaction between Cbfa1 with c-Fos and c-Jun in the absence of phosphorylation and without binding to DNA.

These characteristic domains include the runt domain, a carboxyl-terminal proline-serine-threonine-rich domain, a short Myc-related nuclear localization signal, and a glutamine-alanine domain unique to Cbfa1 (28Thirunavukkarasu K.

Although much is known about the functional implications of Cbfa1 expression, little is known about its mechanism of action as a transcriptional initiator in osteoblasts. The close proximity of the AP-1- and RD-binding sites and their co-operative involvement in the activation of the collagenase-3 promoter by PTH suggest that proteins binding to these sites may also physically interact. Protein-protein interactions between these transcription factors could enable the generation of higher order nucleoprotein complexes that enhance transcription. Numerous studies demonstrate the ability of nuclear proteins to bind each other and to mediate cooperative DNA binding and promoter activation when their respective binding sites are juxtaposed (29Fry C.J.

Three nucleotides (CTT) (−148 + 3) or 10 nucleotides (CTAGCTAGCT) (−148 + 10) were inserted at position −91 upstream of the transcriptional start site between the AP-1- and RD-binding sites. Human cDNA clones for Cbfa2 and Cbf-β were kindly provided by Dr. Scott Hiebert. The cDNAs for rat c-fos and c-jun in pGEM-4 vectors were kindly provided by Dr. Tom Curran (33Rauscher 3rd, F.J.

Oncogene. 1987; 2: 79-84PubMed Google Scholar). The pCMV-c-Jun and c-Fos expression vectors were generated by subcloning c-jun and c-fos cDNAs into a vector driven by a cytomegalovirus promoter as previously described (9Winchester S.K. Selvamurugan N. D'Alonzo R.C. Partridge N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23310-23318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Cbfa1 was also ligated into the pCMV-Myc vector (CLONTECH) in frame with the Myc epitope to yield the pCMV-Cbfa1-Myc vector. The cDNAs coding for Type II Cbfa1 (beginning with the codon for methionine 69), the runt domain of Cbfa1 (amino acids 108–238 of mouse Type II Cbfa1), c-Fos, and c-Jun were amplified from the above plasmids using PCR or were digested by restriction enzymes and ligated into the pAS2–1 and pACT-2 yeast two-hybrid vectors (CLONTECH). The resulting plasmids contained coding sequences for c-Jun, c-Fos, and Cbfa1 or the runt domain of Cbfa1 fused to either the GAL4 binding domain in the pAS2–1 vector or to the GAL4 activation domain in the pACT-2 vector. Additionally, using an internal SmaI site in the rat c-jun sequence and in the pAS2–1 vector, the 5′ end of c-jun was deleted, yielding a construct coding for the leucine zipper region and carboxyl terminus of c-Jun but no activation domain (junZIP) (amino acids 176–334 of rat c-Jun) (35Abate C. Luk D. Curran T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3624-3632Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Likewise, the 5′ region of c-jun, which codes for the amino region and activation domain but lacks the leucine zipper region and carboxyl terminus, was amplified by PCR (amino acids 1–253 of rat c-Jun) and was ligated into the pAS2–1 vector (junACT). The pAP-1 Luc and pRL-TK plasmids were obtained from CLONTECH. The cells were cultured in Eagle's minimal essential medium supplemented with nonessential amino acids, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 5% fetal bovine serum for UMR 106-01 cells or 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum for COS-7 cells. The hexahistidine-tagged fusion protein of c-Fos and c-Jun were purified from Escherichia coli extracts by nickel affinity chromatography in the presence of 6 murea as described previously (33Rauscher 3rd, F.J. Voulalas P.J. Franza B.R. Curran T. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 1687-1699Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 34Curran T. Gordon M.B. Rubino K.L. Sambucetti L.C. Oncogene. 1987; 2: 79-84PubMed Google Scholar). The glutathioneS-transferase fusion protein of Cbfa1 was purified by glutathione-Sepharose column chromatography. The purified proteins were renatured by extensive dialysis against 25 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.5) containing 1 mm dithiothreitol and 5% glycerol. Purified proteins were incubated in binding buffer (40 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.05 mm EDTA) containing 200 ng of poly(dI·dC) and 1 μg of bovine serum albumin for 20 min with an end-labeled rat collagenase-3 promoter probe (base pairs −175 to −1) containing both the AP-1- and RD-binding sites. The protein-DNA complexes were resolved from unbound probe on low ionic strength polyacrylamide gels (4%; 20:0.33) in 0.5× Tris borate-EDTA. The protein-DNA complexes were then visualized by autoradiography. The specificity of the protein complex for these sites was determined by the addition of either cold AP-1-binding site or cold RD-binding site oligonucleotide before the addition of labeled probe. Plasmids containing the coding regions of Cbfa1, Cbfa2, Cbf-β, c-Fos, c-Jun, the RD of Cbfa1, and luciferase were transcribed by SP6 or T7 RNA polymerase and translated in rabbit reticulocyte lysates using 50 μCi of [35S]methionine in vitro. Equal volumes of cold and labeled translation products were mixed and incubated at 30 °C for 30 min and then cleared. The cleared supernatants were incubated with 3 μl of either anti-c-Fos or anti-c-Jun antiserum and 100 μl of Nonidet P-40 buffer. The immunocomplexes were then incubated for 20 min at 4 °C with 25 μl of Staphylococcus aureus cells, precipitated, and washed three times with Nonidet P-40 buffer. The samples were resuspended in SDS sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE. For the helical phasing experiments, the wild type −148, the −148 + 3, and the −148 + 10 plasmids were transiently transfected into UMR 106-01 cells using LipofectAMINE transfection reagent and treated with 10−8m PTH for 24 h where indicated. The cells were then lysed, analyzed for CAT activity, and normalized to protein levels. For the AP-1-binding site luciferase reporter study, combinations of pCMV expression vectors (10 ng total in each case) were co-transfected with 100 ng of the pAP-1 Luc firefly luciferase reporter plasmid and 1 ng of the control, Renilla luciferase plasmid pRL-TK using Superfect transfection reagent (Qiagen) into COS-7 cells. The cells were serum-starved for 24 h to minimize endogenous promoter activation and lysed, and firefly luciferase activity was assayed using a luminometer and a Promega luciferase assay system and normalized toRenilla luciferase activity. For the in vivoco-immunoprecipitation studies, 100-mm dishes with 70% confluent COS-7 cells were transfected with 4 μg each of c-Fos, c-Jun, and Cbfa1-Myc or just c-Fos and c-Jun expression vectors using Superfect transfection reagent. The cells were grown for 2 days and lysed. The Y187 Saccharomyces cerevisiae host yeast strain was transformed with various combinations of the yeast two-hybrid vectors using a small scale LiAc yeast transformation procedure (CLONTECH) and plated on tryptophan/leucine drop-out plates. Each transformation included 100 ng of both a GAL4 activation domain (AD) plasmid and a GAL4 binding domain (BD) plasmid. Five separate transformant colonies were taken for each sample and assayed for β-galactosidase in duplicate using o-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside. β-Galactosidase activity was quantified by spectrophotometer readings and converted to β-galactosidase units by normalization to cell number. COS-7 cells transfected with pCMV expression vectors for c-Fos, c-Jun, and Cbfa1-Myc were lysed with 5 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (1× phosphate-buffered saline, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml pepstatin). The dishes containing the transfected cells were incubated at 4 °C for 10 min and scraped, and cellular debris was pelleted by centrifugation (3,500 rpm at 4 °C for 15 min). The supernatant was precleared by the addition of 1 μg of rabbit IgG and 20 μl of protein A/G-agarose, incubating for 1 h at 4 °C, and centrifuging to pellet the agarose (1,500 rpm at 4 °C for 15 min). Equal amounts of lysate (1 ml) were mixed with 1 μg of polyclonal anti-c-Fos, anti-c-Jun, or rabbit IgG and 15 μl of packed protein A/G-agarose. The samples were incubated overnight at 4 °C and washed four times the following day with 1 ml of lysis buffer. Next, the samples were resuspended in 2× SDS sample buffer (0.063 mTris, pH 6.8, 1% glycerol, 2% SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1% bromphenol blue) and lysis buffer and boiled for 5 min. Both precleared lysate and immunoprecipitated samples were resolved by electrophoresis using 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The proteins were transferred electrophoretically to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes at 100 V for 1 h. After blocking the membrane in 0.1% Tween 20, 138 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, and 25 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk, the membranes were probed with monoclonal anti-c-Myc, anti-c-Fos, or anti-c-Jun antibody, followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (diluted 1:10,000). The antigen-antibody complexes were detected by ECL following the manufacturer's protocol. Previously, we and others identified two elements in the collagenase-3 promoter, the AP-1-binding site, and the RD-binding site that are required for PTH-stimulated activity in the rat osteoblastic osteosarcoma cell line, UMR 106-01 (11Selvamurugan N.

Baumann B. Teurich S. Higgins T. Owen M.J. Schorpp-Kistner M. Angel P. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 667-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Further, we demonstrated an increase in DNA binding of the AP-1 subunits c-Fos and c-Jun to the AP-1-binding site in response to PTH treatment (11Selvamurugan N. Chou W.Y. Pearman A.T. Pulumati M.R. Partridge N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10647-10657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). To determine whether c-Fos·c-Jun and Cbfa1 can bind to the same rat collagenase-3 promoter molecule (containing the AP-1-binding site and RD-binding sites), the hexahistidine-tagged fusion proteins of c-Fos and c-Jun and the glutathione S-transferase-tagged fusion protein of Cbfa1 were purified. Either c-Fos·c-Jun, Cbfa1, or combinations of Cbfa1 and c-Fos·c-Jun were incubated with an end-filled labeled rat collagenase-3 promoter probe and analyzed by electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Incubation of labeled probe with c-Fos·c-Jun alone produced two shifted complexes, identified as c-Fos·c-Jun heterodimer and c-Jun·c-Jun homodimer by preincubating with specific antibodies (Fig. 1A). Antibodies to c-Fos, c-Jun, or equal amounts of IgG were incubated with their respective proteins before adding probe. Competition was further performed with 50-fold molar excess of unlabeled rat collagenase-3 promoter probe. Incubation of labeled probe with Cbfa1 produced another shifted complex. This complex was characterized as Cbfa1 bound to the promoter fragment by incubating protein samples with anti-Cbfa1 antibody, equal amounts of IgG, or 50-fold molar excess of unlabeled rat collagenase-3 probe prior to adding labeled probe (Fig.1B). To determine whether c-Fos·c-Jun and Cbfa1 preferentially bind to the same collagenase-3 promoter molecule, binding reactions were performed with a fixed amount of Cbfa1 and with increasing amounts of c-Fos·c-Jun (Fig. 1C). The addition of c-Fos and c-Jun to the binding reaction resulted in the formation of a ternary complex that demonstrated slower mobility than the shifts generated with either c-Fos·c-Jun or Cbfa1 alone. The specificity of proteins in the ternary complex was assessed by cold competition using either AP-1-binding site or RD-binding site oligonucleotides. A 500-fold excess of unlabeled rat collagenase-3 AP-1-binding site probe competed for the observed c-Fos·c-Jun binding to labeled collagenase-3 probe and resulted in the observation of the Cbfa1-DNA shift. Likewise, a 500-fold excess of unlabeled rat collagenase-3 RD-binding site probe inhibited the formation of the observed Cbfa1-DNA shift. Moreover, the cold RD-binding site probe partially prevented the formation of the ternary complex and resulted in formation of c-Fos·c-Jun-DNA and c-Jun·c-Jun-DNA complexes that exhibited faster mobility than the c-Fos·c-Jun·Cbfa1-DNA ternary complex. When increasing amounts of c-Fos·c-Jun, in the absence of Cbfa1, were incubated with labeled probe, increased intensity of the specific c-Fos·c-Jun complexes was observed, but no ternary complex formation was noted (Fig. 1D). This result signifies that higher levels of c-Fos·c-Jun alone were not responsible for the formation of the slower moving shift. Similar slow mobility, ternary complex formation was also noted by adding increasing Cbfa1 to fixed amounts of c-Fos·c-Jun (data not shown). The specificity of proteins in the ternary complex was assessed by cold competition with either AP-1-binding site or the RD-binding site oligonucleotides (Fig.1E). A 500-fold excess of unlabeled rat collagenase-3 AP-1-binding site probe competed for the observed c-Fos·c-Jun binding to labeled collagenase-3 probe, whereas a 500-fold excess of unlabeled rat collagenase-3 RD-binding site probe competed for the observed Cbfa1 binding to labeled collagenase-3 probe. As before with c-Fos·c-Jun, incubation of increasing amounts of Cbfa1 with labeled probe increased only the intensity of the Cbfa1-DNA complex and, alone, did not result in the formation of the slow moving, ternary complex shift (data not shown). We next investigated the physical interaction between c-Fos, c-Jun, and Cbfa both in vitro and in vivo. When labeled Cbfa1 was incubated with cold c-Fos alone or cold c-Jun and c-Fos together and co-immunoprecipitated with c-Fos antibody, labeled Cbfa1 was detected (Fig. 2A). Similarly, when labeled Cbfa1 was incubated with cold c-Jun alone or cold c-Jun and c-Fos together and co-immunoprecipitated with c-Jun antibody, labeled Cbfa1 was found. Two bands were detected for Cbfa1 that presumably correspond to two isoforms of Cbfa1, one beginning with methionine 1 (Type III Cbfa1) and one beginning at methionine 69 (Type II Cbfa1) (27Harada H. Tagashira S. Fujiwara M. Ogawa S. Katsumata T. Yamaguchi A. Komori T. Nakatsuka M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6972-6978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Similar results were observed with the runt domain of Cbfa1 (RD) (Fig. 2B). Also, Cbfa2 interacted with c-Fos (Fig.2C) and c-Jun (Fig. 2D), and these interactions were increased with the addition of Cbf-β (Fig. 2F). Cbf-β alone did not interact with the AP-1 factors (Fig.2E). To verify the in vitro protein-protein interactions in vivo, lysates from COS-7 cells overexpressing either c-Fos, c-Jun, and c-Myc-tagged Cbfa1 or c-Fos and c-Jun alone were immunoprecipitated using anti-c-Fos, c-Jun, or normal rabbit IgG. As shown in Fig.3A, Cbfa1 co-immunoprecipitated with both c-Fos and c-Jun, as detected with anti-c-Myc antibody. Some background was detected in samples mixed with IgG alone, but this was always less than that seen with the anti-c-Fos or c-Jun antibodies. The band was specific for Cbfa1-Myc, because it was not detected in the absence of Cbfa1-Myc transfection. Fig.3B illustrates the presence of c-Fos and c-Jun in both types of cell lysates and the presence of Cbfa1-Myc in the lysate from c-Fos·c-Jun·Cbfa1-Myc-transfected cells, but not the lysate from cells transfected with only c-Fos·c-Jun. We attempted to co-immunoprecipitate endogenous Cbfa1 with c-Jun and c-Fos, in the osteoblastic osteosarcoma cell line, UMR 106-01, which contains endogenous Cbfa1, c-Fos, and c-Jun, but were unsuccessful in achieving this, even with PTH treatment (data not shown). The yeast two-hybrid system was utilized to verify the in vitro and in vivoco-immunoprecipitation results and to more easily assess the regions involved in the interactions of the proteins. Equal amounts of DNA were used in each sample, and for each reaction that involved only one fusion construct, equal amounts of corresponding empty pACT-2 or pAS2–1, coding for the GAL4 activation domain or the GAL4 binding domain, respectively, were included. When Cbfa1 or the RD of Cbfa1 was combined with c-Jun, 3- and 2-fold increases, respectively, in GAL4 promoter activity were observed compared with c-Jun alone, indicating protein-protein interaction (Fig.4A). Further, this interaction was similar to the interaction found between c-Jun and c-Fos, two transcription factors whose dimerization has been well characterized. All interactions were statistically significant (p < 0.001 for Cbfa1, p = 0.009 for the runt domain, andp < 0.001 for c-Fos) compared with c-Jun alone as determined by Student's t test. As shown in Fig.4B, a significant (p = 0.003) increase in GAL4 activity was also noted for interaction of the runt domain of Cbfa1 with c-Fos compared with c-Fos alone. Additional deletions of c-Jun (Fig. 4E) were performed to further identify the areas of interaction with Cbfa1. A significant increase in GAL4 promoter activity was noted with the combination of the junACT deletion with RUNX2 (p = 0.03) compared with junACT alone (Fig.4C), but the increase observed was not significantly greater than the addition of the effects observed with junACT and RUNX2 alone. An increase in GAL4 promoter activity was also noted with the combination of the junACT deletion with RD, but it was not statistically s"

In the present study, we show that VEGF induces manganese-superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) mRNA and protein in human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAEC) and pulmonary artery endothelial cells. VEGF-mediated induction of MnSOD mRNA was inhibited by pretreatment with the NADPH oxidase inhibitors, diphenyleneiodonium (DPI), and 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride, but not with the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor L-NAME (N-monomethyl-L-arginine) or the xanthine oxidase inhibitor allopurinol. VEGF stimulation of MnSOD was also inhibited by adenoviral-mediated overexpression of catalase Cu, Zn-SOD and a dominant-negative form of the small GTPase component of NADPH oxidase Rac1 (Rac1N17). Treatment of HCAEC with VEGF resulted in a transient increase in ROS production at 20 min, as measured by 2,7-dichlorodihydrofluorescein oxidation. This effect was abrogated by expression of Rac1N17. Taken together, these findings suggest that VEGF induces MnSOD by an NADPH oxidase-dependent mechanism and that VEGF signaling in the endothelium is coupled to the redox state of the cell."
https://openalex.org/W2116597301,"The epidermis, our first line of defense from ultraviolet (UV) light, bears the majority of photodamage, which results in skin thinning, wrinkling, keratosis, and malignancy. Hypothesizing that skin has specific mechanisms to protect itself and the organism from UV damage, we used DNA arrays to follow UV-caused gene expression changes in epidermal keratinocytes. Of the 6,800 genes examined, UV regulates the expression of at least 198. Three waves of changes in gene expression can be distinguished, 0.5-2, 4-8, and 16-24 h after illumination. The first contains transcription factors, signal transducing, and cytoskeletal proteins that change cell phenotype from a normal, fast-growing cell to an activated, paused cell. The second contains secreted growth factors, cytokines, and chemokines; keratinocytes, having changed their own physiology, alert the surrounding tissues to the UV damage. The third wave contains components of the cornified envelope, as keratinocytes enhance the epidermal protective covering and, simultaneously, terminally differentiate and die, removing a carcinogenic threat. UV also induces the expression of mitochondrial proteins that provide additional energy, and the enzymes that synthesize raw materials for DNA repair. Using a novel skin organ culture model, we demonstrated that the UV-induced changes detected in keratinocyte cultures also occur in human epidermis in vivo."

Here, we show that in mice sonic stress significantly increased the number of hair follicles containing apoptotic cells and inhibited intrafollicular keratinocyte proliferation in situ. Sonic stress also significantly increased the number of activated perifollicular macrophage clusters and the number of degranulated mast cells, whereas it down-regulated the number of intraepithelial gd T lymphocytes. These stress-induced immune changes could be mimicked by injection of the neuropeptide substance P in nonstressed mice and were abrogated by a selective substance P receptor antagonist in stressed mice. We conclude that stress can indeed inhibit hair growth in vivo, probably via a substance P-dependent activation of macrophages and/or mast cells in the context of a brain-hair follicle axis."
https://openalex.org/W2117883325,"This work examines the affinity of α4β1-integrin and whether affinity regulation by G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) and chemokines receptors is compatible with cell adhesion mediated between α4-integrin and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1. We used flow cytometry to examine the binding of a fluorescent derivative of an LDV peptide (Chen, L. L., Whitty, A., Lobb, R. R., Adams, S. P., and Pepinsky, R. B. (1999)J. Biol. Chem. 274, 13167–13175) to several cell lines and leukocytes with α4-integrin ranging from about 2,000 to 100,000 sites/cell. The results support the idea that α4-integrins exhibit multiple affinities and that affinity changes are regulated by the dissociation rate and conformation. The affinity varies by 3 orders of magnitude with the affinity induced by binding mAb TS2/16 plus Mn2+ > Mn2+ ' TS2/16 > activation because of occupancy of GPCR or chemokines receptor > resting receptors. A significant fraction of the receptors respond to the activating process. The change in α4-integrin affinity and the corresponding change in off rates mediated by GPCR receptor activation are rapid and transient, and their duration depends on GPCR desensitization. The affinity changes mediated by IgE receptor or interleukin-5 receptor persist longer. It appears that the physiologically active state of the α4-integrin, determined by inside-out signaling, has similar affinity in several cell types.

The adhesion molecules that contribute to these interactions belong to the integrin family and their counterstructures (ICAMs and VCAMs),1 and the selectin family and their counterstructures (cellular mucins such as PSGL-1). A set of “traffic signals” has been proposed as a means of targeting circulating leukocytes to specific vascular sites (1Springer T.A. Cell. 1994; 76: 301-314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6355) Google Scholar). These traffic signals include: 1) an up-regulation of the expression of selectins, ICAM-I and VCAM-I, on endothelial cells by cytokines; 2) the recognition of up-regulated selectins and VCAM-1 on endothelial cells for the initial capture of leukocytes from the circulation, followed by tethering and cell rolling; 3) the presence of chemokines and chemokine receptors for leukocyte stimulation and integrin activation; and 4) the utilization of up-regulated ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 on endothelial cells for leukocyte firm attachment and motility. Adhesion between leukocytes and endothelial cells is regulated by expression levels of the adhesion molecules (“site density”), their affinity, and their “avidity” (2Faull R.J. Ginsberg M.H. Stem Cells. 1995; 13: 38-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 3Loftus J.C. Liddington R.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: S77-S81PubMed Google Scholar, 4Stewart M. Hogg N. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 61: 554-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Affinity regulation is related to the molecular binding recognition. In the case of selectins and mucins, recognition is believed to be constitutive and to depend simply upon the structure of the two molecules. In the case of β1- and β2-integrins, it depends additionally on conformational changes in the binding region of an integrin for its counterstructure on ICAM-1 or VCAM-1. The conformational changes are associated with the responses of cells to stimulation. Avidity regulation, on the other hand, represents the change in adhesive activity between cells with contributions from the number and the affinity of the integrin and its topography on the cell surface. Topographical regulation may include association with cytoskeleton, dimerization, or other forms of macromolecular assembly or clustering (5Grabovsky V. Feigelson S. Chen C. Bleijs D.A. Peled A.

VLA-4 (α4β1-integrin) is unique in its ability to act both as a low affinity receptor that mediates initial capture, tethering, or rolling and as a firm attachment receptor (8Masumoto A. Hemler M.E.

The avidity of VLA-4 has been shown to be sensitive to the presence of chemokines such as those binding to CCR3 (10Sanz-Rodriguez F. Hidalgo A. Teixido J. Blood. 2001; 97: 346-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). There are conflicting data, however, regarding whether changes in adhesion are due to the conformational state or the clustering of the receptor. One group of investigators suggests that clustering controls the initial tethering and rolling interactions of the resting receptor, whereas firm attachment is related to affinity changes (5Grabovsky V.

Peptide binding affinity has been measured both by theKd and the dissociation off rate of a radiolabeled analog using transfected cells expressing high levels of VLA-4. TheKd and off rate vary inversely. The specificity with respect to the α4-integrin was characterized by blocking with the LDV sequence from fibrinogen and by blocking with the extracellular domain of VCAM-1. Very little is known about the characteristics of affinity regulation under physiological conditions. The missing details include theKd and off rate of the physiological states of the receptors, the speed of the regulation, and the identity of the intracellular pathways that control affinity. In T cells, however, the pathway that controls affinity has been linked to p56Lck(11Feigelson S.W. Grabovsky V.V Winter E. Chen L.L. Pepinsky R.B. Yednock T. Yablonski D. Lobb R. Alon R. J. Biol.

In this work, the affinity states of VLA-4 have been examined using a novel fluorescent peptide derived from the high affinity LDV sequence. We used flow cytometry to measure binding affinities and association and dissociation kinetics in real time and to examine affinity regulation in response to divalent cations and physiological mediators in both cell lines and blood leukocytes. The results suggest that affinity regulation as reflected in the dissociation rate is likely to play an important role in the adhesive characteristics of α4-integrin on leukocytic cells.

Human blood was collected by venipuncture into sterile syringes containing 10 units of heparin/ml of blood in accordance with an approved human research protocol. Mixed granulocytes were typically isolated (15Lynam E.B. Simon S.I. Rochon Y.P. Sklar L.A. Blood. 1994; 83: 3303-3311Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with Mono-Poly resolving medium (ICN Biomedicals, Aurora, OH) plus 7.5% (v/v) sterile HEPES buffer (110 mm NaCl, 10 mm KCI, 10 mm glucose, 1 mm MgCl2, and 30 mm HEPES, pH 7.4), by centrifugation at 400 × g for 35 min. Granulocytes were collected, washed in HEPES buffer, and then resuspended in HEPES buffer containing 1.5 mmCaCl2 and 0.1% human serum albumin (Plasbumin-25; Bayer Pharmaceuticals, Elkhart, IN). The buffer had been depleted of lipopolysaccharide by affinity chromatography over polymyxin B-Sepharose (Detoxigel; Pierce). For some experiments, eosinophils were resolved by FACS analysis by staining the mixed granulocyte population with phycoerythrin-labeled CD16. Mixed populations of lymphocytes and monocytes were isolated from Mono-Poly resolving medium as described for granulocytes, collecting cells from the layer located at the bottom of the plasma layer. The cells were washed in HEPES buffer and then resuspended in HEPES buffer/HSA/CaCl2, as described above. Lymphocytes and monocytes were resolved from one another by FACS analysis of forward and side scatter intensity (15Lynam E.B. Simon S.I. Rochon Y.P. Sklar L.A. Blood. 1994; 83: 3303-3311Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Basophils were isolated from heparinized human blood by use of a Percoll gradient, as described previously (17Kepley C.L. Wilson B.S. Oliver J.M. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1998; 102: 304-315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Purities from this initial step ranged from 15 to 66%. Basophil purity was routinely increased to >95% by negative selection using a negative selection cocktail (Stem Cell Technologies, Vancouver, Canada) and MidiMacs (Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA) separation column. Basophils were resuspended in HEPES buffer with 1.5 mm CaCl2 and stored on ice until used in assays. Mixed granulocytes were isolated from heparinized human blood by use of a Percoll gradient with a density of 1.088. The mixed granulocyte population was removed from the layer on top of the red cell layer, followed by red cell lysis with cold sterile water (two or three times). The resulting cells were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline/fetal bovine serum with 50 μl of CD16-labeled and 10 μl of CD3-labeled magnetic beads and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. This mixture was applied to a MACS (Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA) separation column, and the CD16/CD3-negative flowthrough containing eosinophils was collected, washed, and resuspended in HEPES buffer/HSA/CaCl2. These cells were labeled with CD16-PE to resolve any contaminating polymorphonuclear neutrophils by FACS analysis. 100 μl of human peripheral blood were incubated with 15 μl of CD19-PE (SJ25C1) (Becton-Dickinson, San Jose, CA) and 15 μl of CD3-PerCP (Leu-4) (Becton-Dickinson) at room temperature for 15 min. An unstained negative control and an isotype control stained with mouse IgG1-FITC, mouse IgG1-PE, and mouse IgG1-PerCp (Becton-Dickinson) were also prepared. Following this incubation, 2 ml of FACS lysing solution (Becton-Dickinson) were added to each tube and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. The tubes were then centrifuged at 500 ×g for 5 min. The supernatant was decanted, and the cells were washed with 1 ml of HEPES buffer containing 1.5 mmCaCl2 and 0.1% human serum albumin, Immuno-U.S., Inc (Rochester, MI). The samples were centrifuged again at 500 ×g for 5 min, and the supernatant was removed. FITC-labeled LDV peptide was added to cells in two concentrations: 0.6 and 3.0 nm. Unlabeled peptide, TS2/16, and MnCl2 (3 mm) were added to appropriate tubes. The cells were then resuspended in HEPES buffer to a final volume of 200 μl/sample and incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. The samples were analyzed by flow cytometry, collecting 10,000 events. The gates were set on the light scatter characteristics of the lymphoid population, monocyte population, and granulocyte population. In addition B and T cell populations are separated on the basis of CD19 and CD3 positivity in the light scatter gate characteristic of the lymphoid cells. Eosinophils were identified by CD19+, CD3+, and CD49+ within the light scatter gate characteristic of granulocytes. JM-1 and SUP-T1 cell lines were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA). The cells were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air. Site-directed mutants of formyl peptide receptor in U937 cells were prepared as described in Ref. 18Kew R.R. Peng T.

JM1, SUP-T1, and U937 cells (4 × 106) grown in RPMI 1640 (supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 g/ml streptomycin, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum) were harvested and resuspended in 1 ml of HEPES buffer containing 10 mmglucose and 0.1% HSA and stored on ice. Before the experiment the cells were diluted with HEPES buffer containing 10 mmglucose and 0.1% HSA to 1 × 106 cells/ml and warmed up to 37 °C. Human VCAM-1-transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells (CHO-VCAM cells) were kindly provided by Dr. D. Leavesley (Hanson Cancer Center, Adelaide, Australia). Human CXCR2 and CXCR4 cDNAs were obtained from a λgt11 dibutyryl cAMP differentiated HL60 cDNA library by PCR using primers based on the published human sequences and containing terminalEcoRI restriction sites. The resulting 1.1-kbEcoRI-digested fragments were cloned into the mammalian expression vector pSFFV.neo and confirmed by dideoxy sequencing. U937 cells were transfected with the DNA constructs (1 μg) using Effectene (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA) as described by the manufacturer and selected with 1 mg/ml G418 (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA) for 3–4 weeks. Receptor expression was confirmed by flow cytometry using monoclonal antibodies against CXCR2 and CXCR4. Equilibrium and kinetic analyses of peptide binding followed approaches described previously (19Nolan J.P. Chambers J.D. Sklar L.A. Babcock G. Robinsons P. Phagocyte Function: A Guide for Research and Clinical Evaluation. Wiley-Liss, New York, NY, U. S. A.1998: 19-46Google Scholar). For equilibrium binding studies of the FITC-labeled LDV peptide, cell lines, eosinophils (either isolated or as mixed granulocytes), mixed lymphocytes and monocytes, and polymorphonuclear neutrophils were treated with various concentrations (typically 1–10 nm) of the fluorescent peptide in the presence or absence of 3 mmMnCl2. Incubations were performed for short times at 37 °C and overnight on ice with qualitatively similar results. Because the equilibration time of high affinity small molecules is typically a function of their dissociation rate, we have found it experimentally convenient to perform the overnight incubations. Nonspecific binding was determined using 500-fold excess unlabeled peptide. Analysis was performed on a FACScan (Becton-Dickinson), and 10000 events were acquired. Because instrument sensitivity was varied between experiments, the mean channel fluorescence values are not comparable. The cells (cell lines (1 × 106 cells/ml)) or eosinophils (either 2–5 × 105 cells/ml isolated cells or 5–10 × 106 cells/ml of mixed granulocytes) were preincubated with the peptide for 10 min at 37 °C and 500 rpm stirring. Flow cytometric analysis was performed continuously for up to 1000 s. The samples were analyzed for 30–120 s to establish a base line, then the stimulus (Mn2+, eotaxin, LTB4, fMLFF, IL-5, SDF-1α, or IL-8) was added, and FACS acquisition was immediately re-established, losing 5–10 s of the total time course. For dissociation kinetic measurements, cell samples preincubated with 6–15 nm of fluorescent peptide were treated with 500-fold excess unlabeled peptide, and the dissociation of the fluorescent peptide was followed. The resulting data were converted to mean channel fluorescence over time using Tru-Rate software developed by Seamer and Sklar (20Seamer L. Sklar L.A. Methods Cell Biol. 2001; 63: 169-183Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or using FACSQuery software developed by Bruce Edwards. Curve fits and statistics were performed using GraphPad Prism (San Diego, CA). Expression of adhesion molecules was measured with fluorescent mAbs and quantified by comparison with a standard curve generated with Quantum Simply Cellular microspheres (Flow Cytometry Standards, San Juan, Puerto Rico) stained in parallel with the same mAb. This produces an estimate of the total mAb-binding sites/cell (21Edwards B.S. Curry M.S. Tsuji H. Brown D. Larson R.S. Sklar L.A. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 404-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). QuantumTM 24 Premix microbeads (Flow Cytometry Standards Corp.) were used to quantitate the fluorescence intensity of cells bearing VLA-4 specific peptide. One or two drops of beads were added to 0.5 ml of isotonic phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.2), and the mean channel numbers for all calibrated microbeads were collected. The number of molecules of equivalent soluble fluorochromes was plottedversus the mean channel numbers for the four fluorescent microbeads. The graph was used to estimate the total number of molecules of equivalent soluble fluorochromes/cell. Cell suspension adhesion assays were described previously (21Edwards B.S. Curry M.S. Tsuji H. Brown D. Larson R.S. Sklar L.A. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 404-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Briefly, U937 cells were labeled with green fluorescent fluo 4 (7.5 μm, 15 min, 37 °C), and CHO-VCAM transfectants or CHO parental cells (nontransfected) were labeled with red fluorescent hydroethidine (250 μm, 15 min, 37 °C). Labeled cells were washed, resuspended in HEPES buffer (110 mm NaCl, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.5 mm CaCl2, 30 mm HEPES, 10 mm glucose, rendered nonpyrogenic by affinity chromatography over Polymixin B, pH 7.4), and stored on ice until used in assays. U937 cells were preincubated for 5 min at 37 °C in the presence of no addition, LDV peptide (1 μm), anti-α4-integrins mAb HP2/1. Then cells were mixed, and cell suspensions containing 2 × 106 U937 plus 2 × 106 CHO-VCAM or CHO parental cells in 1.0 ml of HEPES buffer were stirred in a 12 × 75-mm polystyrene tube with a 2 × 5-mm magnetic stir bar (400 rpm, 37 °C). After 2 min of continuous stirring, the cells were sampled every 30 s and analyzed in the flow cytometer to determine the numbers of nonadherent singlet U937 (green fluorescent), nonadherent singlet CHO (red fluorescent), and cell conjugates containing U937 adherent to CHO (red and green cofluorescent). Every experiment included samples with Mn2+ (3 mm) added after 2 min of initial stirring. The percentage of U937s forming conjugates was derived by dividing the number of conjugates (dual color events) by the number of conjugates plus nonadherent singlet U937. We have taken advantage of an α4-integrin-specific peptide developed at Biogen (12Chen C. Mobley J.L. Dwir O. Shimron F. Grabovsky V. Lobb R.R. Shimizu Y. Alon R. J.

This sequence is homologous and isosteric with the Gln-Ile-Asp-Ser (QIDS) peptide found in the VCAM-1-binding site (22Wang J.H. Pepinsky R.B. Stehle T. Liu J.H. Karpusas M. Browning B. Osborn L.

Chem. 1999; 42: 920-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, containing the sequence Leu-Asp-Val-Pro-Ser-Thr (LDVPST), and prior experience in peptide-receptor interactions, we replaced the C-terminal serine and threonine with Ala-Ala-Lys-FITC (Fig.1A). The structure-activity relationships suggested that this change would not interfere with LDV peptide binding (14Lin K. Ateeq H.S. Hsiung S.H. Chong L.T. Zimmerman C.N. Castro A. Lee W.C. Hammond C.E. Kalkunte S. Chen L.L. Pepinsky R.B. Leone D.R. Sprague A.G. Abraham W.M. Gill A. Lobb R.R. Adams S.P. J. Med. Chem. 1999; 42: 920-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). To investigate the capability of the peptide to specifically block the VCAM-1/VLA-4 interaction, we set up cell suspension adhesion assays using CHO cells transfected with human VCAM-1, and U937 cells, expressing VLA-4 (Fig.1B). The aggregation experiment showed a low basal level of aggregation between nontransfected CHO cells and U937, which did not increase following integrin activation by Mn2+. VCAM-1 expression in CHO cells dramatically increased cell aggregation, and Mn2+ in this case stimulated the aggregation. The difference between basal aggregation and aggregation of VCAM-transfected cells thus represents VCAM-dependent aggregation. VCAM-dependent aggregation was blocked using LDV peptide or anti-α4-integrin mAb HP2/1. Thus, the peptide is acting through the α4-integrin. To obtain direct evidence of binding specificity, we used rhVCAM or nonfluorescent peptide in competition with the fluorescent LDV peptide (Fig. 1C). Preincubation of U937 cells with an excess of rhVCAM or the unlabeled peptide completely blocked binding of fluorescent LDV peptide. A more detailed analysis of binding is described below. Initial studies were conducted to determine whether the peptide would bind to several cell lines including those representative of monocytes (Fig. 2A, U937), T cells (Fig. 2B, SUP-T1), and B cells (Fig. 2C, JM1). With this range of concentrations (to 25 nm), considerably higher levels of binding could be detected so that it was possible to measure peptide binding both in the presence and absence of Mn2+. The Kd values (0.3–1 nm) were all similar in the presence of Mn2+. In absence of Mn2+, the Kd was ∼12 nm in U937 cells (Fig. 2A). Following earlier observations (12Chen C. Mobley J.L. Dwir O.

As indicated previously, states of varying affinity were detected, with dissociation rates (Fig.3B) varying inversely with the Kd (Fig.3A). These results are also consistent with the idea that peptide binding association rate constants do not vary appreciably between these receptor states (TableI).Figure 3Regulation of affinity and dissociation in α4-integrin conformations.A, equilibrium binding of LDV fluorescent peptide to U937 cells in the presence or absence of Mn2+ and the combination of activating antibody TS2/16 and Mn2+.

To investigate whether this is a general phenomenon, we studied the effects of the sulfhydryl reagent arsenite on VEGF expression in human ovarian cancer cells. Arsenite potently induces the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in several cell systems and directly interacts with sulfhydryl groups of cellular thiols. We report that arsenite induces VEGF mRNA and protein levels in normoxic H134 and OVCAR-3 cells. Arsenite also increases HIF-1α protein levels, suggesting a role for HIF-1 in the induction ofVEGF expression. Pretreatment with the ROS inhibitors catalase and mannitol attenuated arsenite-induced ROS production, but did not affect induction of VEGF mRNA and HIF-1α protein. In contrast, pretreatment with the thiol antioxidants glutathione orN-acetylcysteine completely abrogated both effects, whereas a potentiation was observed by depletion of intracellular glutathione. These results demonstrate that arsenite-induced VEGF mRNA and HIF-1α protein expression is independent of increased ROS production but critically regulated by the cellular reduced glutathione content. In addition, these data suggest the involvement of a thiol-sensitive mechanism in the regulation of VEGF mRNA expression and HIF-1α protein in human ovarian cancer cells.

The expression level of the HIF-1α protein is an important determinant for the activity of HIF-1. Although HIF-1β protein expression is detected in the nucleus of normoxic cells, HIF-1α protein is undetectable in most cell types due to rapid degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (12Salceda S.

In hypoxic cells and in normoxic cells treated with transition metals or iron chelators, HIF-1α protein levels are elevated as a result of decreased ubiquitination and degradation (15Semenza G.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 167-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar). In some cases, induction of HIF-1α protein expression may also involve an increase in the rate of HIF-1α protein synthesis (16Laughner E. Taghavi P. Chiles K. Mahon P.C. Semenza G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3995-4004Crossref PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar). In addition to its level of expression, the HIF-1α protein is regulated at the level of nuclear localization (17Kallio P.J. Okamoto K. O'Brien S. Carrero P. Makino Y. Tanaka H. Poellinger L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6573-6586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and transactivation (15Semenza G.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 167-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar). Recent studies suggest that alterations in the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) provide a redox signal for HIF-1 induction by hypoxia (18Fandrey J. Frede S. Jelkmann W. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 507-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 19Chandel N.S. Maltepe E. Goldwasser E. Mathieu C.E. Simon M.C. Schumacker P.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In some cell types, increased ROS production has been shown to mediate HIF-1α protein accumulation and HIF-1-dependent transcription by hormones, growth factors, and transition metals (11Richard D.E.

Moreover, direct exposure of cells to ROS may also induce HIF-1α protein levels and/or VEGF expression (20Chandel N.S. McClintock D.S. Feliciano C.E. Wood T.M. Melendez J.A. Rodriguez A.M.

Up till now, it is not established whether modulation ofVEGF expression in tumor cells by ROS is a general phenomenon. If this would be the case, cytotoxic agents in use for cancer treatment might also up-regulate VEGF and, as a consequence, VEGF downstream events (22Muller I. Niethammer D. Bruchelt G. Int. J. Mol. Med. 1998; 1: 491-494PubMed Google Scholar, 23Lin H.L. Liu T.Y. Chau G.Y. Lui W.Y. Chi C.W. Cancer. 2000; 89: 983-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Recent evidence indicates that compounds containing trivalent arsenic (As3+, arsenite) have potential as therapeutic agents in cancer (24Murgo A.J. Oncologist. 2001; 6: 22-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Exposure to low dosages of arsenite in the form of arsenic trioxide (As2O3) and/or sodium arsenite (NaAsO2) has a significant cytotoxic effect on different malignant cell lines (24Murgo A.J. Oncologist. 2001; 6: 22-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Arsenic compounds are potent inducers of oxidative stress, and evidence is provided that ROS may be mediators of arsenite-induced cytotoxicity (25Chen Y.C. Lin-Shiau S.Y. Lin J.K. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 177: 324-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar, 26Liu S.X. Athar M. Lippai I. Waldren C. Hei T.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1643-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). To analyze whether oxidative stress can influence VEGF expression in human ovarian cancer cells, we studied the effect of sodium arsenite (NaAsO2). This agent has been shown to potently induce ROS production in several cell systems (25Chen Y.C. Lin-Shiau S.Y. Lin J.K. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 177: 324-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar, 26Liu S.X. Athar M. Lippai I. Waldren C. Hei T.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1643-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). Increased ROS production may result from the activation of ROS-producing enzymes (25Chen Y.C. Lin-Shiau S.Y. Lin J.K. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 177: 324-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar, 27Lynn S. Gurr J.R. Lai H.T. Jan K.Y. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 514-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar) but may also be associated with depletion of reduced glutathione (GSH). Reduction of GSH levels by arsenite can be caused by the inhibition of glutathione reductase (28Snow E.T. Pharmacol. Ther. 1992; 53: 31-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). In addition, arsenite directly interacts with thiol groups (SH) of GSH and cellular proteins (29Scott N. Hatlelid K.M. MacKenzie N.E. Carter D.E. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1993; 6: 102-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 30Winski S.L. Carter D.E. J. Toxicol. Environ. Health. 1995; 46: 379-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 31Kapahi P.

Here, we report that arsenite induces VEGF expression in the human ovarian cancer cell lines OVCAR-3 and H134. Arsenite-increased VEGF expression was associated with the accumulation of HIF-1α protein in both cell lines, suggesting a role for HIF-1 in this effect. By using ROS inhibitors and thiol (anti)oxidants, we have assessed the possible involvement of increased ROS production, GSH depletion, or direct binding to thiol groups of cellular proteins in arsenite-induced VEGF expression and HIF-1α protein accumulation. Sodium arsenite, actinomycin D, cycloheximide, mannitol, catalase, GSH, N-acetylcysteine (NAC), and buthionine-sulfoximine (BSO) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Chemie (Zwijndrecht, The Netherlands). The human ovarian cancer cell lines OVCAR-3 and H134 were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium, Life Technologies, Inc., Breda, The Netherlands) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (fetal calf serum, Sanbio, Uden, The Netherlands), 50 units/ml penicillin (ICN Biochemicals, Zoetermeer, The Netherlands), and 50 μg/ml streptomycin (ICN Biochemicals). Cells were routinely cultured in 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Hypoxic conditions were performed by incubation of cells in a tightly sealed chamber maintained at 1% oxygen, 94% N2, and 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Transient transfection of OVCAR-3 cells with pCEPHIF-1α (32Jiang B.H. Rue E. Wang G.L. Roe R. Semenza G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17771-17778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar) was performed by the calcium phosphate precipitation method (33Graham F.L. van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6499) Google Scholar). For treatment of cells with arsenite, cells were seeded in culture dishes in medium and grown overnight. Thereafter, arsenite (100 or 30 μm) was added to the conditioned media, and cells were further incubated for the time periods as indicated in each experiment. Pretreatment of cells with actinomycin D (5 μg/ml) and cycloheximide (100 μm) was performed for 30 min and 2 h, respectively, prior to the addition of arsenite (100 μm). Pretreatment of cells with mannitol (50 and 100 mm), catalase (500 and 1000 units/ml), GSH (10 and 20 mm), and NAC (10 and 20 mm) were performed for 1 h prior to the addition of arsenite, whereas pretreatment with BSO (500 μm) was performed for 16 h. The RNase protection assay was carried out as described previously (34Giaccone G. van Ark-Otte J. Scagliotti G. Capranico G. van der Valk P. Rubio G. Dalesio O. Lopez R. Zunino F. Walboomers J. Pinedo H.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1264: 337-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The generation of the γ-actin and VEGF165 antisense probes have been described elsewhere (65Duyndam M.C.A. Van Diest P.J. Kraal G. Pinedo H.M. Boven E. Am J. Pathol. 2002; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Hybridization to a 136-nt γ-actin antisense probe gives rise to a protected fragment of 130 nt. Hybridization to a 301-nt VEGF165 antisense probe can give rise to fragments of different sizes due to protection by VEGF mRNAs of different isoforms. Hybridization of VEGF165 mRNA results in the protection of a 252-nt fragment, whereas protection by VEGF206/VEGF189 mRNAs or VEGF145/VEGF121 mRNAs may give rise to protected fragments of 170 and 82 nt, respectively (65Duyndam M.C.A. Van Diest P.J. Kraal G. Pinedo H.M. Boven E. Am J. Pathol. 2002; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). As protection of the VEGF165 antisense probe by VEGF165mRNAs is most efficient, effects on VEGF mRNA levels were monitored by assessing the mRNA levels of VEGF165. DNA templates for the synthesis of HIF-1α antisense probes were generated by PCR. The expression vector pCEPHIF-1α (32Jiang B.H. Rue E. Wang G.L. Roe R. Semenza G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17771-17778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar) was used as a template to amplify nt 1596–1831 of HIF-1α cDNA with the forward primer 5′-AATTAACCCTCACTAAAGGGAGGATCAGACACCTAGTCCTT-3′ and the reversed primer 5′-GTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGCATCCATTGGGATATAGGGAG-3′ for 36 cycles at 94, 56, and 72 °C. In addition to HIF-1α sequences (underlined), the forward and reverse primers contain promoter sequences for T3 and T7 RNA polymerase, respectively. The 248-nt-amplified fragment was extracted with phenol/chloroform, precipitated, and dissolved in T10E1. Use of this 248-nt fragment as a template for the synthesis of a HIF-1α antisense probe with T7 RNA polymerase, resulted in a high background signal in the RNase protection assay. To reduce the background signal, the fragment was digested with Eco RI to generate a smaller template of 125 nt with 5′-protruding ends. Using this template, a 125-nt HIF-1α antisense probe was synthesized with T7 RNA polymerase. Because this antisense probe includes 119 nt of HIF-1α cDNA, HIF-1α mRNA is expected to give rise to a protected fragment of 119 nt. Cells were washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed by scraping with a rubber policeman in 450 μl of E1A buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 250 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40) for ELISA or 150 μl of radioimmune precipitation buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.1% sodium deoxycholate) for Western blotting. Both lysis buffers were supplemented with 50 mm NaF, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1.0 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm trypsin inhibitor, and 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin. After a 15-min incubation period on ice, the extracts were clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C and stored at −70 °C. Protein concentrations were determined by the Coomassie Plus Protein assay (Pierce, Omnilabo, Breda, The Netherlands). Equal numbers of cells were plated on nine 9.6-mm culture dishes and grown overnight. The conditioned media of all dishes was collected and pooled, and 450 μl was sampled (T = 0 medium sample). Cells of one dish were washed and lysed in 450 μl of lysis buffer as described above (T = 0 lysate sample). The conditioned medium was divided in two equal volumes. Arsenite was added to one volume at a concentration of 100 μm. Subsequently, conditioned media with or without arsenite was again added to eight culture dishes with cells. Thus, atT = 0 the amount of VEGF protein in the medium was the same in each culture dish. After incubation periods of 2, 4, 6, and 8 h, 450 μl of conditioned medium was sampled and cells were lysed. VEGF concentrations in nondiluted media samples and lysates were determined in duplicate by ELISA using the reagents and the protocol supplied with the Quantikine Human VEGF Immunoassay kit (R&D Systems/ITK Diagnostics, Uithoorn, The Netherlands). Differences in VEGF concentrations in medium and lysates of nontreatedversus arsenite-treated cells were evaluated using Student’s t test for two groups. p values <0.05 were considered to be significant. In the Western blot experiments, 100 μg of protein cell extract was resolved in a SDS-polyacrylamide gel (7.5%) and electrophoretically transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon, Millipore, Etten-Leur, The Netherlands). Membranes were blocked for 1 h in TBST (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.025% Tween 20)/5% milk and incubated overnight at 4 °C with HIF-1α-directed antiserum in a 1:1000 dilution. After washing with TBST, the membranes were incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-mouse antiserum in TBST/5% milk. The membranes were washed again with TBST, and proteins were visualized by Electro Chemoilluminescence. The mouse monoclonal antiserum to HIF-1α (H1alpha67, catalogue no. ab1-100) and the horseradish peroxidase-coupled anti-mouse serum (catalogue no. P0260) were from Novus Biologicals/AbCam (Cambridge, United Kingdom) and DAKO (Glostrup, Denmark), respectively. Intracellular ROS production was assessed using 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA; Molecular Probes, Leiden, The Netherlands). After diffusion into cells, this dye is hydrolyzed by intracellular esterase to yield 2′-7′-dichlorofluorescein (DCFH). ROS (hydrogen peroxide or low molecular weight peroxides) in the cells oxidizes DCFH to the highly fluorescent compound 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein (DCF). Cells were plated on culture dishes and incubated with arsenite (100 μm) for different time periods. DCFH-DA was added to the medium 1 h before harvesting the cells by trypsinization. Cell fluorescence was detected with a FACScan flow cytometer using a 525-nm band pass filter. The relative mean fluorescence intensity in arsenite-treated cells after individual incubation periods (i) was tested against 100% (t = M (i) − 100/S.E.) by means of Student’s t test for one group. The p values <0.05 were considered to be significant. In addition, the relative mean fluorescence intensity in cells treated with arsenite and catalase or mannitol (c,m) was tested against the relative mean fluorescence intensity in cells treated with arsenite alone or to control cells (t = M (c, m) − 100/S.E.) using the Student’s t test for two groups and one group, respectively. The p values <0.05 were considered significant. VEGF mRNA levels in the human ovarian cancer cells OVCAR-3 and H134 upon different periods of exposure to 100 μm arsenite were assessed by the RNase protection assay (Fig. 1). In this assay, a labeled, antisense VEGF165 RNA probe was used for hybridization, allowing efficient detection of mRNAs encoding the VEGF165 isoform. Hybridization of total RNA of nontreated OVCAR-3 and H134 cells resulted in the protection of a 252-nt fragment, indicating a basal level of expression of VEGF165 in both cell lines. Judged by the intensity of the 252-nt protected fragment, the basal level of VEGF165 mRNA in H134 cells appeared to be slightly higher than that in OVCAR-3 cells. After 2 h of arsenite treatment, the intensity of the 252-nt fragment relative to the γ-actin-protected fragment increased in both OVCAR-3 and H134 cells, indicating an increase in VEGF165 mRNA levels. This increase was sustained until at least 8 h of exposure. At this time point, induction of VEGF165 mRNA levels was ∼6- and 3-fold in OVCAR-3 and H134 cells, respectively. Changes in VEGF165 mRNA levels were not observed in nontreated cells (data not shown). We next assessed whether induction of VEGF mRNA levels by arsenite resulted in an increased production of VEGF protein. Arsenite was added to the conditioned medium of OVCAR-3 and H134 cells, and VEGF concentrations were measured by ELISA in the conditioned media or in cell lysates after different periods of incubation. In addition, we determined VEGF protein concentrations in conditioned media and lysates of nontreated cells. As can be seen in Fig.2 A, VEGF protein levels in the conditioned medium of H134 cells were much higher than in those of OVCAR-3 cells at the start of treatment (T = 0). Upon exposure to arsenite, a time-dependent increase in VEGF production was observed in both cell types. Increased VEGF protein levels in the conditioned media of arsenite-treated versus nontreated cells was observed after 6 and 8 h of incubation. In OVCAR-3 cells, this increase was statistically significant. In the lysates, increased production of VEGF was evident and statistically significant after 4 h of incubation and was more pronounced after 6 and 8 h (Fig. 2 B). It should be noted that, in contrast to the RNase protection assay, the ELISA assay does not discriminate between VEGF165 and the other VEGF isoforms. Therefore, it is difficult to assess exact correlations between VEGF mRNA and protein levels. Nevertheless, these data indicate that induction of VEGF mRNA upon arsenite treatment is associated with the accumulation of VEGF protein in H134 and OVCAR-3 cells and in their conditioned media. To determine whether induction of VEGF mRNA levels by arsenite was due to increased transcription or to RNA stabilization, we analyzed the effect of the transcription inhibitor actinomycin D in both OVCAR-3 and H134 cells. Fig. 3 shows that actinomycin D completely inhibited induction of VEGF165 mRNA levels by arsenite in both cell types, suggesting that this effect is at the transcriptional level. To analyze whether arsenite-induced expression of VEGF165was dependent on de novo protein synthesis, we determined the effect of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide. As can be seen in Fig. 4 A, induction of VEGF165 mRNA levels upon arsenite treatment in OVCAR-3 cells was strongly inhibited by cycloheximide. In H134 cells, VEGF165 mRNA levels were potentiated with cycloheximide alone. Incubation of cycloheximide-pretreated H134 cells with arsenite did, however, not increase VEGF165 mRNA levels beyond those observed by cycloheximide alone. These data suggest that induction of VEGF expression by arsenite is dependent on ongoing protein synthesis. To examine whether arsenite-induced VEGF expression may be mediated by HIF-1, we investigated the HIF-1α protein levels upon arsenite treatment in OVCAR-3 and H134 cells by Western blot with a HIF1α-directed antibody expression. As can be seen in Figs. 4 B and 5 A, OVCAR-3 and H134 cells showed a basal level of HIF-1α protein expression. After 4 h of arsenite treatment, the level of HIF-1α protein was elevated and was even further increased after 8 h. Note that, under conditions where cycloheximide was found to inhibit arsenite-induced VEGF mRNA levels, the accumulation of HIF-1α protein was inhibited over 90% in both OVCAR-3 and H134 cells (Fig.4 B). We also assessed the effects of arsenite on the levels of HIF-1α mRNA by the RNase protection assay (Fig.5 B). Hybridization of total RNA of nontreated OVCAR-3 cells to a HIF-1α antisense probe resulted in the protection of a fragment with the expected size of 119 nt. As a positive control, we also hybridized total RNA of OVCAR-3 cells that were transiently transfected with a HIF-1α expression vector. As expected, the 119-nt fragment was detected with increased intensity, whereas it was not observed after hybridization with control tRNA. These data confirm that the 119-nt fragment is protected by HIF-1α mRNA and that detection of this fragment is indicative for a basal level of expression of HIF-1α mRNA in nontreated OVCAR-3 cells. The intensity of the 119-nt fragment did not alter relatively to that of the γ-actin-protected fragment until at least 8 h of exposure to arsenite. The same results were obtained in H134 cells (data not shown). These findings indicate that HIF-1α mRNA levels are not influenced upon treatment with arsenite and that induction of HIF-1α protein is regulated by a post-transcriptional mechanism. The low level of expression in nonstimulated OVCAR-3 and H134 cells suggests that HIF-1α protein is unstable under normoxic conditions in these cell lines. To assess whether arsenite regulates the expression of HIF-1α protein by inhibiting its degradation, we monitored the levels of arsenite-induced HIF-1α protein after blocking protein synthesis by cycloheximide. First, we confirmed that HIF-1α protein is rapidly degraded in the absence of protein synthesis in nonstimulated OVCAR-3 and H134 cells under normoxia. To this end, we investigated the decay of hypoxia-stabilized HIF-1α after transfer of cells from hypoxia to normoxia. In agreement with previous studies in other cell types (12Salceda S. Caro J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22642-22647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1417) Google Scholar, 13Huang L.E. Gu J. Schau M. Bunn H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

HIF-1α protein was completely undetectable by the end of 30 min under normoxia. In contrast, arsenite-induced HIF-1α protein levels under normoxia remained constant for 15 min after cycloheximide addition and decreased relatively slowly to ∼50% within 45 min thereafter. Despite the lack of protein synthesis, the levels of HIF-1α protein were still detectable and clearly above basal after 3 h of cycloheximide exposure. The decay of arsenite-in"
https://openalex.org/W1486102976,"PLC-ε was identified recently as a phosphoinositide-hydrolyzing phospholipase C (PLC) containing catalytic domains (X, Y, and C2) common to all PLC isozymes as well as unique CDC25- and Ras-associating domains. Novel regulation of this PLC isozyme by the Ras oncoprotein and α-subunits (Gα12) of heterotrimeric G proteins was illustrated. Sequence analyses of PLC-ε revealed previously unrecognized PH and EF-hand domains in the amino terminus. The known interaction of Gβγ subunits with the PH domains of other proteins led us to examine the capacity of Gβγ to activate PLC-ε. Co-expression of Gβ1γ2 with PLC-ε in COS-7 cells resulted in marked stimulation of phospholipase C activity. Gβ2 and Gβ4 in combination with Gγ1, Gγ2, Gγ3, or Gγ13 also activated PLC-ε to levels similar to those observed with Gβ1-containing dimers of these Gγ-subunits. Gβ3 in combination with the same Gγ-subunits was less active, and Gβ5-containing dimers were essentially inactive. Gβγ-promoted activation of PLC-ε was blocked by cotransfection with either of two Gβγ-interacting proteins, Gαi1 or the carboxyl terminus of G protein receptor kinase 2. Pharmacological inhibition of PI3-kinase-γ had no effect on Gβ1γ2-promoted activation of PLC-ε. Similarly, activation of Ras in the action of Gβγ is unlikely, because a mutation in the second RA domain of PLC-ε that blocks Ras activation of PLC failed to alter the stimulatory activity of Gβ1γ2. Taken together, these results reveal the presence of additional functional domains in PLC-ε and add a new level of complexity in the regulation of this novel enzyme by heterotrimeric G proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2008037275,"HMG-CoA (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A) reductase inhibitors, or statins, are prescribed widely to lower cholesterol. Accumulating evidence indicates that statins have various effects on vascular cells, which are independent of their lipid-lowering effect. Here, we tested the hypothesis that statins may augment collateral flow to ischemic tissues. We induced hind-limb ischemia in wild-type mice and treated them with either saline or cerivastatin. Cerivastatin enhanced the blood flow recovery dramatically as determined by Laser Doppler imaging. The mice treated with saline displayed frequent autoamputation of the ischemic toe, which was prevented completely by cerivastatin. Anti-CD31 immunostaining revealed that cerivastatin significantly increased the capillary density. Endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activity was enhanced markedly in the mice treated with cerivastatin. The angiogenic effect of cerivastatin was abrogated in eNOS deficient (eNOS-/-) mice. These results indicate that eNOS is essential for cerivastatin to promote collateral growth in response to ischemia."
https://openalex.org/W2025991358,"ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) mediates an active efflux of cholesterol and phospholipids and is mutated in patients with Tangier disease. Expression of ABCA1 may be increased by certain oxysterols such as 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol via activation of the nuclear hormone receptor liver X receptor (LXR). In searching for potential modulators of ABCA1 expression, we have studied the effects of various mevalonate metabolites on the expression of ABCA1 in two human cell lines, THP-1 and Caco-2 cells. Most of the tested metabolites, including mevalonate, geranyl pyrophosphate, farnesyl pyrophosphate, and ubiquinone, failed to significantly change the expression levels of ABCA1. However, treatment with geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate resulted in a dose- and time-dependent reduction of ABCA1 expression. Geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate appears to reduce ABCA1 expression via two different mechanisms. One of these mechanisms is by acting directly as an antagonist of LXR since it reduces the interaction between LXRα or -β with nuclear coactivator SRC-1. Another mechanism appears to involve activation of the Rho GTP-binding proteins since treatment of Caco-2 cells with inhibitors of geranylgeranyl transferase or the Rho proteins significantly increased the expression and promoter activity of ABCA1. Further studies showed that mutations in the DR4 element of the ABCA1 promoter completely eliminate the inducible activities of these inhibitors.

These proteins couple the energy provided by ATP hydrolysis to the transport of a wide variety of molecules across membranes (8Dean M. Allikmets R. Curr. Opin. Genet.

ABCA1 is thought to mediate the active efflux of cholesterol and phospholipids to apolipoprotein (apo) acceptors, most importantly apoA-I, the major apo of HDL (12Bortnick A.E. Rothblat G.H.

Therefore, cellular cholesterol efflux in TD patients is defective, which leads to accumulation of excess cellular cholesterol and defective formation of HDL (14Lawn R.M. Wade D.P. Garvin M.R.

The mevalonate pathway supplies substrate for the sequence of reactions leading to the formation of polyisoprenoid lipids such as ubiquinone, cholesterol, and oxysterols (for review, see Ref. 19Grunler J. Ericsson J. Dallner G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1212: 259-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Recently it was found that expression of ABCA1 may be up-regulated by certain oxysterols including 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol (22(R)-Hch) and 20(S)-Hch. Further studies demonstrated that such induction of ABCA1 may be mediated by the activation of the nuclear hormone receptor LXR (20Schwartz K. Lawn R.M. Wade D.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 274: 794-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 21Costet P. Luo Y. Wang N. Tall A.R. J. Biol.

Understanding the regulation of ABCA1 expression is a critical step toward a better comprehension of its role in lipid metabolism. We have thus decided to search for additional endogenous modulators that may regulate the expression of ABCA1. We found that geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP), one of the major products of the mevalonate pathway, potently suppressed ABCA1 expression. Furthermore, we demonstrated that GGPP may regulate ABCA1 expression via two different mechanisms. THP-1 cells, a human monocytic leukemia cell line, and Caco-2 cells, a human intestinal epithelial cell line, were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 (THP-1 cells) or OPTI-MEM medium (Caco-2 cells) with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 50 units/ml penicillin G, 50 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate in an atmosphere containing 5% CO2 and 95% air. Before assay, cultured cells were harvested, washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, and then resuspended in the assay medium (RPMI 1640 or OPTI-MEM medium with 0.5% heat inactivated fetal calf serum, 50 units/ml penicillin G, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate). All reagents used in the experiments were diluted in the same assay medium. Total RNA was extracted from the cultured cells using TRIZOL reagent according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer (Life Technologies, Inc.). RNA was then treated with DNase I (Ambion, Austin, TX) for 30 min at 37 °C. DNase I was inactivated and removed from the reaction with the addition of DNase inactivation reagent (Ambion). RNA concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically at A260 andA280 using a DU 640 Spectrophotometer (Beckman). Oligonucleotide primers and TaqMan probes for human ABCA1 were designed using Primer Express software (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and were synthesized by PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Primer and probe sequences (5′–3′) are as follows: ABCA1 forward primer, TGTCCAGTCCAGTAATGGTTCTGT; ABCA1 reverse primer, AAGCGAGATATGGTCCGGATT; ABCA1 probe, 6FAM-ACACCTGGAGAGAAGCTTTCAACGAGACTAACC-TAMRA; ABCG1 (ABC8) forward primer, TGCAATCTTGTGCCATATTTGA; ABCG1 reverse primer, CCAGCCGACTGTTCTGATCA; ABCG1 probe, 6FAM-TACCACAACCCAGCAGATTTTGTCATGGA-TAMRA. Primers and probes for human IL-8 and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Real-time quantitative TaqMan PCR analysis (22Heid C.A. Stevens J. Livak K.J. Williams P.M. Genome Res. 1996; 6: 986-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (5040) Google Scholar) was used to determine the relative levels of ABCA1, ABCG1, and IL-8 mRNA. Reverse transcription-PCR and TaqMan PCR reactions were performed according to the instructions of the manufacturer (PE Biosystems, TaqMan Gold reverse transcription-PCR protocol and TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix). Sequence-specific amplification was detected with an increased fluorescent signal of FAM (reporter dye) during the amplification cycle. Amplification of the gene for human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was performed in the same reaction on all samples tested as an internal control for variations in RNA amounts. Levels of the different mRNAs were subsequently normalized to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA levels and were presented as -fold difference of treated cells against untreated cells. A homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence assay-based nuclear receptor-coactivator assay was used to examine the interaction of LXR with GGPP. A complete description of this assay has been published elsewhere (23Zhou G. Cummings R. Li Y. Mitra S. Wilkinson H.A. Elbrecht A. Hermes J.D. Schaeffer J.M. Smith R.G. Moller D.E. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1594-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Briefly, 198 μl of reaction mixture (100 mm HEPES, 125 mm KF, 0.125% (w/v) CHAPS, 0.05% dry milk, 5 nm GST-LXRα ligand binding domain (LBD) or 5 nm GST-LXRβLBD, 2 nm anti-GST-(Eu)K, 10 nmbiotin-SRC-(568–680), 20 nm SA/XL665) were added to each well of a 96-well plate followed by the addition of 2 μl of methanol or GGPP or GPP (in methanol) in appropriate wells in the presence or absence of 500 nm 22(R)-Hch (about 1.5× EC50). Plates were mixed by hand and covered with TopSeal. The reaction was incubated overnight at 4 °C followed by measurement of a fluorescence reading on a Discovery instrument (Packard Instrument Co.). Data were expressed as the ratio, multiplied by a factor of 104, of the emission intensity at 665 nm to that at 620 nm. A firefly luciferase reporter construct was generated with nucleotides −928 to +101 of human ABCA1 (21Costet P. Luo Y. Wang N. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28240-28245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). Human genomic DNA (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) was PCR-amplified with ABCA1-specific primers containing aBglII restriction site and eight random nucleotides on the 5′-end of the forward primer (Dexter-3F GATCGATCAGATCTTAAGTTGGAGGTCTGGAGTG) and a HindIII restriction site and eight random nucleotides on the 5′-end of the reverse primer (Dexter-3R GATCGATCAAGCTTGCTCTGTTGGTGCGCGGA). This fragment was cloned into the BglII/HindIII site of the pGL3 Basic vector (Promega, Inc., Madison, WI) and confirmed by sequencing (ACGT, Inc., Northbrook, IL) to create the ABCA1-Luc construct. A similar construct with a mutation of the DR4 element of the ABCA1 promoter (DR4Mut1-Luc, Refs. 20Schwartz K. Lawn R.M. Wade D.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 274: 794-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar and 21Costet P. Luo Y. Wang N. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28240-28245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar) was created by site-directed mutagenesis of the 5′ half-site of the ABCA1-Luc DR4 element. The mutagenesis was performed using the GeneEditor system (Promega, Inc.) and mutagenic oligonucleotides according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The mutagenic oligonucleotide Mut-1 was designed to introduce a PstI site into the 5′ half-site of the ABCA1 DR4 element as described previously (20Schwartz K. Lawn R.M. Wade D.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 274: 794-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). A restriction digestion withPstI (Life Technologies, Inc.) was used to screen for mutants, and the full-length sequence was confirmed (ACGT, Inc.) to lack any additional mutations in the ABCA1 sequence. Transfections were performed in 96-well plates with FuGENE 6 reagent according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Roche Diagnostics Corp.). Caco-2 cells were maintained in complete OPTI-MEM medium containing 10% heat inactivated fetal calf serum, 50 units/ml penicillin G, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate. Immediately prior to transfection, the complete medium was replaced by serum and antibiotic-free medium to a concentration of 5 × 104 cells/ml, and 200 μl were added per well of 96-well plates. The constructs ABCA1-Luc or DR4Mut1-Luc were cotransfected in a 4:1 ratio with a control reporter plasmid, pRL-TK (Renilla luciferase, Promega, Inc.), in the concentrations recommended by the manufacturer to maintain a FuGENE to DNA ratio of 3:1. Five hours after transfection, cell treatments with compound were initiated, and treatments were stopped at 48 h from the beginning of transfection. Cells were harvested using Passive Lysis Buffer and assayed for relative luciferase activities with the dual-luciferase reporter assay system purchased from Promega and read with a luminometer (Dynex Technologies, Chantilly, VA). All transfections were performed in triplicate. Consistent with previous reports (12Bortnick A.E. Rothblat G.H. Stoudt G. Hoppe K.L. Royer L.J. McNeish J. Francone O.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2863-28640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (273) Google Scholar), THP-1 and Caco-2 cells expressed readily detectable levels of ABCA1 mRNA. When cells were exposed to the LXR ligand 22(R)-Hch, a marked increase of ABCA1 mRNA was observed (data not shown). Overnight (∼16-h) treatment of cells with most products from the mevalonate pathway including mevalonate, farnesyl pyrophosphate, GPP, and ubiquinone failed to significantly change the expression levels of ABCA1 mRNA. Addition of GGPP, however, significantly reduced the expression of ABCA1 (Fig.1). The inhibitory effect of GGPP on ABCA1 expression was dose-dependent (Fig. 2). In THP-1 cells, an apparent reduction was detected at concentrations as low as 0.3 μm GGPP. At 10 μm, GGPP reduced ABCA1 expression by greater than 80%. The concentration needed for a half-maximal inhibition was ∼2 μm (Fig.2). In the same experiment, we found that GGPP also inhibited the expression of ABCG1 (ABC8) with a similar potency (Fig. 2A). ABCG1, another member of the ABC transporter family, was recently shown to be induced by cholesterol loading and activation of LXR (24Klucken J. Buchler C. Orso E. Kaminski W.E. Porsch-Ozcurumez M.

Our results suggest that ABCA1 and ABCG1 may be subjected to similar mechanisms of regulation by GGPP. An additional study showed that GGPP also had a similar but less potent inhibitory effect for ABCA1 expression in Caco-2 cells (Fig.2B). The GGPP-mediated reduction of ABCA1 or ABCG1 expression apparently is not due to cell toxicity since parallel studies showed that GGPP fails to significantly change the ability of cells to convert 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxy-phenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium salt (MTS) into formazan (data not shown, see Ref. 26Shu H.

Together these data indicate a specific inhibition of ABCA1 expression by GGPP.Figure 2GGPP reduces expression of ABCA1 and ABCG1but not IL-8. Cells (5 × 105 cells/well) were plated in six-well plates and mixed with increasing concentrations of GGPP.

At 3.5 h, 10 μm GGPP reduced expression of ABCA1 in THP-1 cells by about 40%. Expression of ABCA1 was further reduced as the incubation proceeded, and it reached maximal reduction levels at about 16 h. Results from a similar time course study demonstrated an apparently more rapid kinetic effect of 22(R)-Hch on ABCA1 expression (Fig. 3B). Maximal increase of ABCA1 expression was observed at 3.5 h postexposure to 22(R)-Hch. Induction of ABCA1 by certain oxysterols including 22(R)-Hch may be mediated by the activation of LXR (20Schwartz K. Lawn R.M. Wade D.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 274: 794-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 21Costet P. Luo Y. Wang N. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28240-28245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). Recently, Forman et al. (28Forman B.M. Ruan B. Chen J. Schroepfer Jr, G.J. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10588-10593Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) reported that GGPP may reduce transactivation of LXRα. We thus questioned whether GGPP would reduce the expression of ABCA1 by acting as an antagonist of LXR. Because ligand-dependent interactions between nuclear receptors and members of a family of nuclear receptor coactivators are associated with transcriptional activation (29Kamei Y. Xu L. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Kurokawa R. Gloss B. Lin S.C. Heyman R.A. Rose D.W. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 1996; 85: 403-414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1928) Google Scholar, 30Onate S.A. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Science. 1995; 270: 1354-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (2063) Google Scholar), we thus asked whether GGPP would prevent the interaction of LXRα or -β with nuclear coactivators. Interaction of LXRα or -β with the nuclear coactivator steroid receptor coactivator-1 (SRC-1) was quantified using the fluorescence resonance energy transfer approach as described under “Materials and Methods.” As shown in Fig.4, addition of GGPP effectively reduced the basal and LXR ligand 22(R)-Hch-induced interaction of LXRα (Fig. 4, A and B) and LXRβ (Fig. 4,C and D) with SRC-1. The GGPP concentration needed for a half-maximal inhibition of LXRα and LXRβ is about 0.5 and 0.7 μm under basal condition and 0.7 and 0.9 μm in the presence of 0.5 μm of 22(R)-Hch, respectively. In the same study, we found that another mevalonate metabolite, GPP, failed to significantly affect the interaction of LXRα or LXRβ with SRC-1 (Fig. 4). In a similar study and using conditions essentially identical to those for LXR as described above, we found that GGPP at the same concentrations failed to significantly affect the interaction of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors with nuclear coactivator SRC-1 or cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB)-binding protein (data not shown, see Ref. 23Zhou G. Cummings R. Li Y. Mitra S. Wilkinson H.A. Elbrecht A. Hermes J.D. Schaeffer J.M. Smith R.G. Moller D.E. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1594-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar for assay details). These observations thus establish a direct and specific effect of GGPP on LXRα and LXRβ. To ask whether the inhibitory effect of GGPP on LXR accounts for its inhibitory effect on ABCA1 as described above, cells were treated with increasing concentrations of GGPP in the presence of a fixed amount of LXR ligand 22(R)-Hch (Fig.5). As concentrations of GGPP increased, expression of ABCA1 induced by the treatment with 22(R)-Hch decreased. However, a further increase of GGPP concentration failed to mediate additional reduction of ABCA1 expression. These observations suggest that GGPP may not compete for the same binding site as that of 22(R)-Hch. It also suggests potential involvement of an additional mechanism for regulating the expression of ABCA1. Since GGPP may be used for posttranslational modification of signaling molecules (31Casey P.J Seabra M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5289-5292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar), we questioned whether GGPP would reduce expression of ABCA1 through a mechanism involving prenylation of the signaling molecules. We tested a potential prenylation effect of GGPP on ABCA1 in Caco-2 cells by using specific inhibitors of geranylgeranyl transferase, L-839,867 and L-836,978 (32Huber H.E. Abrams M. Graham S. Hartman G. Lobell R. Lumma W. Nahas D. Robinson R. Sisko J. Heimbrook D.C. Proc. Am. Assoc. Cancer Res. 2000; 41: 446Google Scholar). Geranylgeranyl transferase catalyzes the transfer of the geranylgeranyl group from GGPP to various signaling molecules such as the Rho proteins (31Casey P.J Seabra M.C. J. Biol.

As shown in Fig.6A, we found that treatment of Caco-2 cells with L-839,867 led to a dose-dependent increase of ABCA1 expression. Prenylation of signaling molecules may also be catalyzed by farnesyl transferase, an enzyme that transfers a farnesyl group from farnesylpyrophosphate (31Casey P.J Seabra M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5289-5292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). Consistent with a negligible effect of farnesyl pyrophosphate on ABCA1 (see Fig. 1), we found that addition of α-hydroxyfarnesyl phosphonic acid, a specific inhibitor of farnesyl transferase, failed to significantly change the expression of ABCA1 (Fig. 6B). Among the isoprenylated proteins, the Rho and the Rab proteins are known to be the most extensively geranylgeranylated (33Adamson P. Marshall C.J. Hall A. Tilbrook P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20033-20038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether the effects of GGPP or L-839,867 on ABCA1 expression may be related with their influence on the prenylation of Rho proteins, ABCA1 expression was measured in the presence of C3 exoenzyme, a specific inhibitor of Rho proteins (34Aktories K. Braun U. Rosener S. Just I. Hall A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 158: 209-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 6B, addition of C3 exoenzyme (4 μg/ml) significantly increased ABCA1 expression. These data thus suggest that prenylation of Rho proteins suppresses ABCA1 expression and that inhibition of Rho with geranylgeranyl transferase inhibitors or C3 exoenzyme enhances ABCA1 expression. The ability of GGPP to suppress ABCA1 expression may thus derive, in part, from enhanced prenylation and function of Rho. To further delineate a mechanism that underlies prenylation-mediated regulation of ABCA1, we prepared human ABCA1 promoter-luciferase constructs (−928 to +101 bp) with or without mutation in the LXR response element DR4 and transfected them into Caco-2 cells. Consistent with earlier reports (20Schwartz K. Lawn R.M. Wade D.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 274: 794-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 21Costet P. Luo Y. Wang N. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28240-28245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar), addition of 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol significantly increased promoter activity of ABCA1 (Fig. 7A). Mutation of the DR4 element from the promoter of ABCA1 completely eliminated the inducible activity of 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol, thus confirming an LXR-dependent regulation of ABCA1 transcription by 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol (Fig. 7A). We next studied the role of geranylgeranylation on the promoter activity of ABCA1 by using the aforementioned specific inhibitors of geranylgeranyl transferase or Rho proteins. As shown in Fig. 7, B andC, addition of L-839,867 or C3 exoenzyme resulted in a significant increase of the ABCA1 promoter activity. Further studies showed that mutation of the DR4 element from the promoter of ABCA1 completely eliminated the inducible activity of these inhibitors (Fig.7, B and C). These data indicate that a prenylation-mediated ABCA1 regulation also involves activation of LXR. In view of the potential importance of ABCA1 in the regulation of HDL cholesterol, we studied the molecular mechanisms that regulate expression of the ABCA1 gene. Consistent with earlier reports (20Schwartz K. Lawn R.M. Wade D.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 274: 794-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 21Costet P. Luo Y. Wang N. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28240-28245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar), we show that ABCA1 expression is effectively up-regulated by 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol, a product of the mevalonate biosynthetic pathway. Furthermore, we report an interesting finding that expression of ABCA1 is potently down-regulated by a distinct product of the mevalonate pathway, GGPP. Our data suggest the presence of endogenous machinery that may counterbalance the expression level of ABCA1. Since both the positive regulator, such as 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol, and the negative regulator, GGPP, are important products of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway, these data support an important role of ABCA1 in cholesterol homeostasis. Expression of ABCA1 may be regulated by the activation of LXR. This is attributed to the presence of a unique DR4 element in the ABCA1 promoter. Upon activation of LXR, such as with the ligand 22(R)-Hch, LXR forms a heterodimer with another nuclear receptor, RXR, and binds to the DR4 element, mediating transactivation of the ABCA1 gene (20Schwartz K. Lawn R.M. Wade D.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 274: 794-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 21Costet P. Luo Y. Wang N. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28240-28245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). Results from our study indicate that at least part of the inhibitory effect of GGPP on ABCA1 expression may occur via direct inhibition of LXR. We showed that addition of GGPP inhibited the interaction of LXRα and LXRβ with nuclear coactivator SRC-1 (Fig. 4). Interestingly we found that GGPP was only partially capable of inhibiting the inducible effect of LXR ligand 22(R)-Hch on ABCA1 mRNA expression (Fig. 5), suggesting that the binding site for GGPP and 22(R)-Hch on LXR may be different. In support of our view, our preliminary experiments suggest that GGPP fails to displace the binding of a synthetic LXR ligand from LXRα or -β. 2K. MacNaul and T. Q. Cai, unpublished observation. Recently Forman et al. (28Forman B.M. Ruan B. Chen J. Schroepfer Jr, G.J. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10588-10593Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) reported that GGPP may reduce the transactivation of LXRα. It was found that upon GGPP binding to LXRα the binding of LXRα·RXR complex to DNA was inhibited. These observations are thus fully consistent with findings reported here. While detailed mechanism(s) by which GGPP inhibits LXR remains unclear, together our data suggest that one of the mechanisms used by GGPP to suppress the expression of ABCA1 is by acting directly as an antagonist of LXR. Apparently such antagonizing activity is equally potent to LXRα and LXRβ (Fig. 4). Interestingly, results from our additional studies indicate that this may not be the only mechanism used by GGPP to regulate ABCA1 expression. While inhibition of geranylgeranyl transferase may potentially increase the intracellular concentration of its substrate, GGPP, thus triggering an LXR-dependent down-regulation of ABCA1 as described above, we nevertheless found that expression and promoter activity of ABCA1 was increased by the treatment with L-839,867, a potent and specific inhibitor of geranylgeranyl transferase (Figs. 6 and 7). These data suggest that a prenylated protein serves as a negative regulator of ABCA1 expression. The geranylgeranyl groups may be transferred to specific sequences at the carboxyl terminus of many proteins. Two geranylgeranyl transferases, types I and II, have been identified. While type I requires a carboxyl-terminal sequence of -Cys-Ala-Ala-X, the type II enzymes requires a double Cys motif, such as -Cys-Cys, -Cys-X-Cys, or -Cys-Cys-X-X (for review, see Ref. 31Casey P.J Seabra M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5289-5292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). Thus, it is unlikely that either LXR or RXR can be modified in this fashion since both LXR and RXR receptors lack a consensus sequence for protein prenyl transferase (LXRα and LXRβ: Trp-Asp-Val-His-Glu-COOH; RXR: Pro-His-Gln-Met-Thr-COOH). Therefore, we have turned our attention to the small GTP proteins. Among the isoprenylated proteins, the Rho and the Rab proteins are major substrates for posttranslational modification by geranylgeranyl transferase (33Adamson P. Marshall C.J. Hall A. Tilbrook P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20033-20038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Upon geranylgeranylation, these signaling molecules are activated, and they go on to play an important role in a number of functional processes such as the regulation of membrane traffic, exocytic and endocytic transport processes (35Zerial M. Stenmark H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 613-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar), actin stress fiber formation, focal adhesion assembly, and reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton (36Van Aelst L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2101) Google Scholar, 37Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5230) Google Scholar). Consistent with an inducible effect of the geranylgeranyl transferase inhibitor, we showed that the treatment of cells with C3 exoenzyme, a specific inhibitor of the Rho proteins, also increased the expression and promoter activity of ABCA1 (Figs. 6 and7). Furthermore, we showed that mutation of the functional DR4 element completely diminishes activity of the ABCA1 promoter induced by inhibitors of geranylgeranyl transferase or Rho proteins (Fig. 7,B and C). These data indicate that regulation of ABCA1 expression by Rho proteins is mediated through LXR. It is unclear how activation of the Rho proteins may change the activation status of LXR. The Rho proteins have been shown to regulate the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase and the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades (38Coso O.A. Chiariello M. Yu J.C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 1137-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1570) Google Scholar, 39Minden A. Lin A. Claret F.X. Abo A. Karin M.

Chem. 1996; 271: 25731-25734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Because protein kinases are involved in the phosphorylation of transcription factors such as RXR (41Lee H.Y. Suh Y.A. Robinson M.J. Clifford J.L. Hong W.K. Woodgett J.R. Cobb M.H. Mangelsdorf D.J. Kurie J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32193-32199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), it is conceivable that there may be cross-talk between Rho protein-regulated kinase signaling cascades and LXR activation. As mentioned previously, the Rho proteins play an important role in a number of functional processes such as vesicular transport. Thus, it may also be possible that the Rho proteins could potentially regulate the activation status of LXR by changing trafficking and distribution of an endogenous pool of cholesterol or ligand of LXR. We thank Dr. Erik Lund for valuable discussions and technical support and Patrick Xin, Ying Li, and Nancy Hayes for technical assistance at various stages. We appreciate the preparation of geranylgeranyl transferase inhibitors by Drs. William C. Lumma, Anthony M. Smith, and John T. Sisko (Merck Research Laboratories, West Point, PA)."

Hartman F.C. Lorimer G.H. Chem. Rev. 1998; 98: 549-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). This reaction initiates photosynthetic carbon assimilation via the Calvin cycle and results in the net gain of carbon from atmospheric CO2 into the biosphere. The carboxylation reaction of Rubisco is the major source of carbon needed for life. A competing reaction in which O2 is added to RuBP results ultimately in a net loss of CO2, a process known as photorespiration. Because the reaction catalyzed by Rubisco is unique to photosynthetic CO2 fixation and nearly all carbohydrate production is dependent on it, the oxygenase reaction qualifies as the most important limiting factor of photosynthetic yield. All Rubisco enzymes have oxygenase activity. This is true also for strictly anaerobic microbes, including some anaerobic archaebacteria (reviewed in Ref. 1Tabita F.R. Photosynth. Res. 1999; 60: 1-28Crossref Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Thus, whereas the ratio of carboxylation to oxygenation at any specified concentrations of CO2 and O2 depends on the catalytic efficiency (k cat/K m) of carboxylation relative to that of oxygenation, referred to as the CO2/O2 specificity factor, net CO2fixation is determined by the difference between the rates of carboxylation and oxygenation (4Laing W.A. Ogren W.L. Hageman R.H. Plant Physiol. 1974; 54: 678-685Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Spreitzer R.J. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1993; 44: 411-434Crossref Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The kinetic constants that determine carboxylation and oxygenation vary considerably among Rubisco enzymes from different species (6Jordan D.B. Ogren W.L. Nature. 1981; 291: 513-515Crossref Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Based on their quaternary structures, different forms of Rubisco enzymes can be distinguished (reviewed in Refs. 1Tabita F.R. Photosynth. Res. 1999; 60: 1-28Crossref Scopus (294) Google Scholar and 2Spreitzer R.J. Photosynth. Res. 1999; 60: 29-42Crossref Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In cyanobacteria and plants with chloroplasts, such as red and brown algae and green plants, a hexadecameric (L8S8) form is found, consisting of eight 55-kDa L subunits and eight 15-kDa S subunits. A dimeric (L2) enzyme, similar in structure to the L subunits of the hexadecameric enzymes, is restricted to some bacteria and alveolates. More recently, a third form was discovered in the thermophilic archaebacteriumThermococcus kodakaraensis that comprises 10 L subunits arranged as a pentagonal decamer (7Kitano K. Maeda N. Fukui T. Atomi H. Imanaka T. Miki K. Structure. 2001; 9: 473-481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). L subunit-like genes have also been found in other microorganisms that do not rely on the Calvin cycle for CO2 fixation (reviewed in Ref. 1Tabita F.R. Photosynth. Res. 1999; 60: 1-28Crossref Scopus (294) Google Scholar), but the function of the encoded proteins has not been completely demonstrated (8Hanson T.E. Tabita F.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4397-4402Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The x-ray structure of the L2 Rubisco from Rhodospirillum rubrum was the first to be reported (9Schneider G. Lindqvist Y. Brändén C.-I. Lorimer G. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 3409-3415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because of the ease to express this enzyme in Escherichia coli, it was also the first Rubisco for site-directed mutagenesis studies (reviewed in Ref.10Hartman F.C. Harpel M.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 197-234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, it is not a good model for the higher plant enzyme for several reasons: (i) the low amino acid sequence identity of its L subunit in comparison with the L subunits of higher plants; (ii) the different quaternary structure, lacking S subunits; and (iii) the very low CO2/O2 specificity factor. The structures of several L8S8 Rubisco enzymes have been reported. Among higher plant enzymes, the structures for Spinacia (11Knight S. Andersson I. Brändén C.-I. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 113-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 12Andersson I. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 160-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) and Nicotiana (13Curmi P.M.G. Cascio D. Sweet R.M. Eisenberg D. Schreuder H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16980-16989Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) Rubisco are known. Structures from the cyanobacterium Synechococcus (14Newman J. Brändén C.-I. Jones T.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1993; 49: 548-560Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the β-proteobacteriumAlcaligenes eutrophus (15Hansen S. Burkow Vollan V. Hough E. Andersen K. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 288: 609-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and the red alga Galdieria partita (16Sugawara H. Yamamoto H. Shibata N. Inoue T. Okada S. Miyake C. Yokota A. Kai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15655-15661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) have also been determined. Between these species, the primary and tertiary structures of the L subunits are highly similar. The S subunits, although having the same overall-fold, differ in specific regions. In particular, the loop between β strands A and B is 12 or more residues longer in green plants than in other organisms, and the C terminus is about 30 residues longer in some of these organisms than in green plants. In Alcaligenes and Galdieria Rubisco (15Hansen S. Burkow Vollan V. Hough E. Andersen K. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 288: 609-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 16Sugawara H. Yamamoto H.

These β-hairpins fill the space created by a reduction in the size of the S subunit βA-βB loops. Because the L and S subunits of land plants cannot be assembled inE. coli (17Cloney L.P. Bekkaoui D.R. Hemmingsen S.M. Plant Mol. Biol. 1993; 23: 1285-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), it has been difficult to examine the effects of random or directed mutations on the function of Rubisco from higher plants (reviewed in Ref. 2Spreitzer R.J. Photosynth. Res. 1999; 60: 29-42Crossref Scopus (93) Google Scholar). An additional drawback is that higher plants cannot be maintained in the complete absence of Rubisco function. In contrast, the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii serves as an excellent model for the study of photosynthesis because photosynthesis-deficient mutants can be maintained with acetate as an alternative source of carbon (18Spreitzer R.J. Mets L. Plant Physiol. 1981; 67: 565-569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is now possible to generate amino acid substitutions in either theChlamydomonas L or S subunit by directed mutagenesis and in vivo transformation of the respective chloroplastrbc L gene or nuclear rbc S gene (19Spreitzer R.J. Rochaix J.D. Goldschmidt-Clermont M. Merchant S. The Molecular Biology of Chloroplasts and Mitochondria in Chlamydomonas. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, Netherlands1998: 515-527Google Scholar, 20Spreitzer R.J. Esquivel M.G. Du Y.-C. McLaughlin P.D. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5615-5621Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). However, in the absence of a crystal structure for Chlamydomonas Rubisco, the effects of amino acid substitutions on enzyme function have been of necessity deduced from the land-plant structures. Here we present the crystal structure of Rubisco fromChlamydomonas reinhardtii in complex with the transition-state analogue 2-CABP (Fig. 1) to a resolution of 1.4 Å. To date, this is the highest resolution achieved for this large, 560-kDa holoenzyme. The information contained in the structure may help explain the influence of S subunit substitutions on Rubisco function and has identified posttranslational modifications not evident in other Rubisco structures. Wild-typeChlamydomonas reinhardtii cells, strain 2137mt+ were grown at 25 °C on acetate medium in 800-ml cultures (18Spreitzer R.J. Mets L. Plant Physiol. 1981; 67: 565-569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After ∼2 weeks, the cells were harvested by centrifugation and lysed by sonication in an extraction buffer consisting of 50 mm Bicine, pH 8, 10 mmMgCl2, 10 mm NaHCO3, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mmethylenedinitrilo tetraacetic acid, containing a CompleteTMprotease inhibitor mixture tablet (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). After differential ammonium sulfate precipitation between 25 and 50% saturation, the redissolved cellular protein was loaded onto a Mono Q anion exchange column equilibrated with the extraction buffer without protease inhibitors. Rubisco was eluted from the column with a 0.1–0.5m NaCl gradient. The yield of Rubisco was typically 1.5 mg/culture. Rubisco was crystallized using the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method at 18 °C. Protein (2–4 μl) at a concentration of 10–15 mg/ml, containing μm quantities of 2-CABP, was mixed with an equal volume of well solution consisting of 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 8–12% polyethylene glycol 4000, 50 mm NaHCO3, and 5 mmMgCl2. Plate-like crystals grew normally within a few days, with maximal dimensions ∼0.2 × 0.15 × 0.05 mm. The crystals belong to space group C 2 with cell dimensions a = 171.4 Å, b = 142.6 Å, c = 124.8 Å, and b = 124.13° and diffract x-rays beyond 1.4 Å using synchrotron radiation. Data were collected at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, beam-line ID14-3, from a single crystal at 100 K using 25% ethylene glycol as a cryoprotectant. Data were processed to 1.4 Å using DENZO/SCALEPACK (21Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38573) Google Scholar). Details of the data collection and processing are shown in Table I. The structure was solved by molecular replacement using the program AMORE (22CCP4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

A search model consisting of one L and one S subunit was constructed from the coordinates of Spinacia Rubisco (Protein Data Bank code8RUC) (12Andersson I. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 160-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Identical residues were kept, but residues that differ in the sequences of Spinacia and Chlamydomonas Rubisco L and S subunits were changed to Ala or Gly. The N and C termini of the S subunits were truncated at residues 11 and 120, and residues 59–61 (Spinacia numbering) of the βA-βB loops were deleted. The rotation function showed eight clear peaks corresponding to the eight molecules in the Cheshire cell. From these eight peaks, four clear solutions, corresponding to a unique solution in the asymmetric unit, were found by the translation function. Initial electron density maps calculated using phases from the four copies of the search model showed good density for the omitted residues and most side chains. Two cysteine residues in the L subunit had extra density on the sulfur atoms. To investigate the nature of the modification, two refinement protocols were run in parallel with the extra density modeled as either a hydroxyl or as a methyl group. Refinement of the model was performed using REFMAC version 4 (24Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Ealick S. Crystallographic and Modeling Methods (in Molecular Design). Springer Verlag, New York1990: 189-190Google Scholar). After a few cycles of building and refinement, solvent molecules were added using the program ARP (26Perrakis A. Sixma T.K. Wilson K.S. Lamzin V.S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 448-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). All selected solvent molecules were later checked manually. The partial contribution of riding hydrogen atoms was included during the last refinement cycle. The initial R factor for the model after rigid body refinement was 0.357. After final manual adjustments and refinement, the R factor of the model was 0.149 and the R free, based on a test set of 5% of the data, was 0.162.Table IData collection and processing statisticsResolution shell all (highest)100–1.40 (1.43–1.40)Number of unique reflections469,880 (30,387)Completeness97% (94%)Redundancy (overall)4.0〈I〉/〈ςI〉21.7 (2.6)R mergeaRmerge = ΣjΣh‖Ihj − 〈Ih〉‖/(ΣjΣh〈Ih〉).0.049 (0.404)a Rmerge = ΣjΣh‖Ihj − 〈Ih〉‖/(ΣjΣh〈Ih〉).

Details of data collection and processing are presented in Table I, and refinement statistics are shown in Table II. The electron density is of outstanding quality. Some residues are clearly in multiple conformations and have been modeled as such. The occupancies for alternative conformations have been set such that the B factors for equivalent conformers are similar.

The quaternary structure shows local 422 symmetry, with four L2S2 dimers arranged around a local 4-fold axis (Fig. 2).

Distinct deviations from the Spinacia search model were observed in the following regions. Within the L subunit, residues 92–95 in the surface loop between β-strands C and D differed by as much as 2.1 Å in the Cα positions. Previous directed mutagenesis studies with Chlamydomonas Rubisco indicated that this region may determine the species specificity of interactions between Rubisco and Rubisco activase (28Larson E.M.

Within the S subunit, the C terminus was deduced from rbc S DNA sequencing to be 11 residues longer than that of the Spinacia S subunit, but no density was observed for the 13 residues assumed to follow Lys-127. When a nonsense codon was introduced to truncate theChlamydomonas S subunit after residue Asp-131, the mutant strain retained photosynthesis competence but displayed a lower molecular mass for the S subunit. 2M. G. Esquivel and R. J. Spreitzer, unpublished results. Furthermore, the purified mutant enzyme had decreases in carboxylationk cat and in vitro thermal stability. Thus, it would seem likely that the C-terminal residues are present but simply disordered in the crystal structure. A second major difference between the Spinacia and Chlamydomonas S subunit structures is apparent in the loop between β strands A and B (Fig.3). The addition of five residues confers more bulk to the loop, which causes a narrowing of the entrance to the central cavity of the holoenzyme. Electron density for the βA-βB loop region is shown in Fig.4.Figure 4Electron density ( 2mF o − DF c contoured at 1ς) for the βA-βB loop of the S subunit. Alternate conformations for the Oγ of Ser-64 and Sγ of Cys-65 are shown in dark red and green, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because of the high resolution of the data and the excellent quality of the maps, some posttranslational modifications are unambiguously apparent in the structure. Electron density for these modified amino acids is shown in Fig. 5. Rubisco is activated via carbamylation of Lys-201 and subsequent coordination with Mg2+ (reviewed in Refs. 30Portis Jr., A.R. J. Exp. Bot. 1995; 46: 1285-1291Crossref Google Scholar and 31Salvucci M.E. Ogren W.L. Photosynth. Res. 1996; 47: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Thus, as expected for the fully activated enzyme examined in the present study, Lys-201 is carbamylated. However, the other modeled modifications are unique to the present structure. Two Cys residues in the L subunit (residues 256 and 369) have extra density on the sulfur atoms (Fig. 5 A). The possibility that these residues were monohydroxylated was tested, but analysis of difference maps and side-chain atom temperature factors (Fig. 6) showed this extra density to be most consistent with methylation. Methyl-Cys-256 forms a van der Waals contact (4 Å) with Val-63 of the S subunit, which is one of five additional residues that are present in the βA-βB loop ofChlamydomonas Rubisco but absent from the βA-βB loop ofSpinacia Rubisco (Fig. 3). This region is slightly exposed to the solvent in the internal cavity of the hexadecamer. Methyl-Cys-369 is situated on the external surface of the molecule. Two 4-Hyp residues are present in the L subunit at positions 104 and 151 (Fig. 5 B). Hyp-104 is slightly accessible to the solvent on the exterior of the hexadecamer, whereas Hyp-151 is situated inside the L subunit. In addition, the N terminus of the S subunit shows extra density consistent with N-methylation (Fig. 5 C). N-terminal methylation may be common for the chloroplast-targeted S subunits of all Rubisco enzymes (32Grimm R. Grimm M. Eckerskorn C. Pohlmeyer K. Rohl T. Soll J.

Chem. 1999; 274: 36750-36756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, except for carbamylation of Lys-201, this is the first direct observation of such posttranslational modifications in a Rubisco crystal structure. All of the modifications are clear for each of the four copies in the asymmetric unit.Figure 6Refined temperature factors (Å2) for modified cysteine residues 256 and 369 of the L subunit when modeled as S-methylcysteine (A) and S-hydroxycysteine (B). Values shown are the average for the four copies in the asymmetric unit. The temperature factors for the S-hydroxyl oxygen atoms refine unreasonably high compared with the average for the residue. This indicates S-methylation to be the most likely modification of these cysteines.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The structure of Rubisco from wild-type Chlamydomonas reinhardtii was determined to a resolution of 1.4 Å, the highest so far for Rubisco, and has been refined to a low R factor of 0.149 (Table II). The structure provides a model against which numerous conclusions from previousChlamydomonas mutants can be tested (19Spreitzer R.J. Rochaix J.D. Goldschmidt-Clermont M. Merchant S.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4041-4046Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In a previous study (38Du Y. Hong S. Spreitzer R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14206-14211Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), genetic screening and selection inChlamydomonas identified N54S and A57V S subunit substitutions that complement decreases in Rubisco carboxylation, CO2/O2 specificity and thermal stability that arise from an L290F substitution in the L subunit. Based on sequence alignment, the affected S subunit residues were thought to reside within a five-residue sequence unique to the longer βA-βB loop ofChlamydomonas Rubisco (38Du Y. Hong S. Spreitzer R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14206-14211Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). It is now quite clear from theChlamydomonas crystal structure that the Cα atoms of Asn-54 and Ala-57 are in similar positions as the Cα atoms of Arg-53 and His-56 in the Spinacia structure (Fig. 3). Asn-54 and Ala-57 are not adjacent to L subunit Leu-290. They reside on the opposite side of the βA-βB loop, such that their side chains are buried on the interface to the βA-βB loop of an adjacent S subunit (Fig. 3 A). The N54S and A57V substitutions must alter the arrangement of the S subunit residues on the opposite side of the βA-βB loop in ways that compensate for the increased bulk that arises from the L subunit L290F substitution (Fig. 3 A). A crystal structure of the L290F enzyme may reveal how residues at the interface between L and S subunits can influence catalytic efficiency at the distant active site (34Du Y. Spreitzer R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19844-19847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 38Du Y. Hong S. Spreitzer R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14206-14211Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, because the affected residues have been found to represent homologous residues in the structure of Spinacia Rubisco, a target region has been identified that may prove useful for the eventual engineering of an improved Rubisco from higher plants. In a more recent study (20Spreitzer R.J. Esquivel M.G. Du Y.-C. McLaughlin P.D. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5615-5621Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), five βA-βB-loop residues from a section that appeared to be highly conserved in the sequences ofChlamydomonas and all other green plant S subunits were analyzed by directed mutagenesis and rbc S transformation inChlamydomonas. When one of these residues, Arg-59 inChlamydomonas, was replaced with Glu, the resultant enzyme mimicked the reduced holoenzyme stability ascribed to a homologous R53E mutant enzyme that had been created by directed mutagenesis and chloroplast targeting in vitro (39Flachmann R. Bohnert H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10576-10582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Adam Z. Photosynth. Res. 1995; 43: 143-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Now that theChlamydomonas Rubisco structure has been solved, it is readily apparent that Arg-59 is one of five residues unique to the longer Chlamydomonas βA-βB loop (Fig. 3). In contrast toSpinacia Arg-53, the side chain of Chlamydomonas Arg-59 is oriented outside of the hydrophobic core of the S subunit βA-βB loop in which it resides. However, the Arg-59 residue interacts with a neighboring small subunit, its guanidino group taking up a position quite similar to the guanidino group of the Arg-53 side chain in the Spinacia βA-βB loop (Fig. 3C). It is now possible to determine the functional significance of such conserved interactions by examining the crystal structures of appropriate mutant enzymes. The reason and origin of the methylation of two Cys residues in the L subunit is not clear. Because only Cys-256 and Cys-369 are specifically methylated, it is unlikely that these modifications arose during purification. Other solvent-accessible Cys residues are clearly not methylated. Because Cys-256 is buried at the interface between L and S subunits, it is reasonable to conclude that it is methylated prior to the final assembly of the hexadecamer. MethylCys-256 makes a van der Waals contact with Val-63 of the S subunit, and this residue is unique to the longer βA-βB loop that is characteristic of the S subunits of green-algal Rubisco (Figs. 3 and 4). A comparison of more than 3000 L subunit sequences in the NCBI Entrez data base (TableIII) reveals that 47% of the green-algal sequences have Cys-256, but 95% of all higher plant sequences contain Phe-256, and 68% of all Phaeophyta (brown alga in a wide sense) feature a Tyr-256. In Spinacia Rubisco (12Andersson I. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 160-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), Phe-256 is in van der Waals contact with S subunit His-56 (Fig. 3). Thus, methylation of Cys-256 may have a unique role in the structure or assembly of some Rubisco enzymes. In contrast, because Cys-369 is situated on the external surface of the molecule, it may be methylated after holoenzyme assembly. Approximately 60% of all green-algal sequences contain Cys-369, but virtually all higher plant sequences contain Val. In all L subunit sequences from non-green algae, this residue is Ala. Thus, methylation of Cys-369 may also serve a function unique to green-algal Rubisco. None of the species for which Rubisco crystal structures have been solved contains Cys at residue positions 256 or 369 (12Andersson I. J. Mol.

However, it should be possible to probe the significance of these modified residues by employing directed mutagenesis and transformation of the Chlamydomonas chloroplast (19Spreitzer R.J.

However, studies of several infectious, allergic, and autoimmune diseases have shown that chronic type-1 and type-2 cytokine responses can also cause significant morbidity and mortality if left unchecked. We used mouse cDNA microarrays to molecularly phenotype the gene expression patterns that characterize two disparate but equally lethal forms of liver pathology that develop in Schistosoma mansoni infected mice polarized for type-1 and type-2 cytokine responses. Hierarchical clustering analysis identified at least three groups of genes associated with a polarized type-2 response and two linked with an extreme type-1 cytokine phenotype. Predictions about liver fibrosis, apoptosis, and granulocyte recruitment and activation generated by the microarray studies were confirmed later by traditional biological assays. The data show that cDNA microarrays are useful not only for determining coordinated gene expression profiles but are also highly effective for molecularly ""fingerprinting"" diseased tissues. Moreover, they illustrate the potential of genome-wide approaches for generating comprehensive views on the molecular and biochemical mechanisms regulating infectious disease pathogenesis."

In all cases, PKD activation has been shown to be mediated by a PKC-dependent signal transduction pathway that involves the phosphorylation of Ser744 and Ser748 within the activation loop of the catalytic domain of PKD (19Iglesias T.

In addition, we recently found that bombesin, a mitogenic GPCR agonist, induced a rapid and reversible plasma membrane translocation of PKD by a mechanism that requires its catalytic domain and PKC activity (26Rey O.

The role of PKD redistribution in the regulation of these cellular and molecular responses remains poorly understood. In this study, we examined the distribution of PKD using immunocytochemistry and visualization of fluorescence-tagged PKD in dividing and G0-arrested (quiescent) Swiss 3T3 cells. We found that PKD shuttles between the cytoplasm and the nucleus in proliferating cells. Mitogenic GPCR agonist stimulation of quiescent Swiss 3T3 cells induced a transient nuclear accumulation of PKD that could be blocked by inhibiting PKC activity. These findings identified the nuclei as a compartment targeted by PKD and provides evidence for a novel mechanism where the activation and intracellular distribution of PKD is coordinated by PKC. Vectors encoding chimeric fusion proteins between green (GFP) or red (RFP) fluorescent protein and wild type PKD or the mutants PKDΔPH, PKDΔCRD, PKDP287G, CRD, PKDΔCys1, and PKDΔCys2 were previously described (15Van Lint J.V.

The PCR product was digested withStuI/HpaI, purified, and subcloned into pGPKD (26Rey O. Young S.H. Cantrell D. Rozengurt E. J. Biol.

AnEcoRI fragment containing the complete cDNA PKD sequence was isolated from the resulting vector pGPKD-L478A/L480A and subcloned into the expression vector pEF-plink2-GFPC3 (14Matthews S.

All of the constructs generated were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis, and the products of expression were analyzed by Western blot using antibodies against RFP, GFP, or PKD/PKCμ. A schematic representation of all of the employed constructs is shown in Fig. 1. Earlier we demonstrated that the fusion of GFP tag to the N terminus of PKD did not produce any detectable effect on its basal catalytic activity, phorbol ester binding, or bombesin-mediated PKD activation (14Matthews S.

In addition, the inherent fluorescence of GFP allowed us to visualize the localization of GFP-PKD in live cells (14Matthews S. Iglesias T. Cantrell D. Rozengurt E. FEBS Lett. 1999; 457: 515-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Stock cultures of Swiss 3T3 and Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (MDCK) were maintained at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in a humidified atmosphere containing 10% CO2and 90% air. For live cell analysis, cells were plated onto 15-mm number 1 round glass coverslips inside 33-mm dishes at 7 × 104 cells/dish and transfected 18–20 h later. Cells were transfected with 1 μg of DNA/33-mm dish using LipofectAMINE PLUS (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's suggested conditions. For immunocytochemistry, the cells were plated in 33-mm dishes at 7 × 104 cells/dish or in Lab-Tek chamber slides (Nalge Nunc International, Naperville, IL) (3.5 × 104 cells/well) and transfected as indicated above with 1 μg of DNA/dish or 0.5 μg of DNA/well, respectively. Transfected cells were incubated for 18–20 h before agonist analysis. Cotransfection experiments were done using 1 μg of pGFP-CRD DNA and 100 ng of PKD-RFP DNA per 33-mm dish. The Swiss 3T3-PKD.GFP cell line was established by infecting Swiss 3T3 cells with a retrovirus encoding PKD and GFP as two separated proteins but under the control of the same promoter (33Zhukova E. Sinnett-Smith J. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40298-40305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Cells were collected and sorted by fluorescence-activated cell sorting to select the GFP-positive ones. The GFP-positive cells were propagated, and multiple aliquots were frozen. A fresh batch of cells was restarted every 2 months. Cells were maintained at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in a humidified atmosphere containing 10% CO2 and 90% air. Imaging of live cells expressing fluorescence-tagged proteins and immunocytochemistry of fixed cells using a rabbit polyclonal anti-PKD/PKCμ (C20), which recognizes an epitope mapping at the C terminus of PKD, were performed as previously described (25Rey O. Rozengurt E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 287: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 26Rey O. Young S.H. Cantrell D. Rozengurt E. J. Biol.

For the experiments employing immunocytochemistry or imaging of live cells expressing GFP- or RFP-tagged proteins, 50 cells were analyzed per experiment, and each experiment was performed at least in triplicate. The cells displayed in the appropriate figures were representative of 90% of the population of transfected cells. Quantitative analysis of the cytoplasmic and nuclear fluorescence intensity was performed on images of the midsection of fixed and immunostained cells that were obtained with a Leica TCS-SP upright laser-scanning confocal microscope (LSCM) (26Rey O. Young S.H. Cantrell D. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32616-32626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Quantification was performed on a Macintosh PowerBook G4 computer using the public domain NIH Image program (developed at the National Institutes of Health and available on the Internet at rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image/). Nuclear fluorescence intensity (N) was calculated as a percentage of the total cellular fluorescence intensity (C): (N/(N + C)). Each data point represents the mean intensity fluorescence obtained from 20 randomly chosen cells unless otherwise indicated. Error is expressed as S.D. The anti-PKD/PKCμ (clone C20) antibody, its corresponding blocking peptide sc-639P, and anti-GFP antibody were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Ro 81–3220 was obtained from Calbiochem. Bombesin, vasopressin, GF 109203X, and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole were obtained from Sigma. Texas Red-conjugated goat-anti rabbit immunoglobulins were obtained from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). The plasmid pEGFP-Actin and the anti-RFP antibody were obtained from CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc. (Palo Alto, CA). Leptomycin B was a generous gift from Dr. Minoru Yoshida (Department of Biotechnology, University of Tokyo). All of the other reagents were the highest grade commercially available. We previously found that the deletion of the PH domain of PKD induced the nuclear accumulation of this GFP-tagged protein in lymphocytes, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells (24Matthews S.A. Iglesias T. Rozengurt E. Cantrell D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2935-2945Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 26Rey O. Young S.H. Cantrell D. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32616-32626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In order to substantiate this observation, Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts, a model system extensively used to elucidate signaling by endogenously expressed GPCRs (34Rozengurt E. Science. 1986; 234: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar), were transiently transfected with wild type and mutant PKDs fused to GFP (Fig. 1) and examined 18 h later with an LSCM. In agreement with our recent results, we found that GFP-PKD and the majority of the PKD fusion mutant proteins expressed in Swiss 3T3 cells were distributed throughout the cytosol (Fig.2). Some cells showed a more pronounced signal at the perinuclear area, consistent with the partial localization of PKD to the Golgi compartment, as we and others described previously (23Prestle J. Pfizenmaier K. Brenner J. Johannes F.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1401-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 25Rey O. Rozengurt E. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Cell. 1999; 98: 59-68Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). No fluorescence or very little fluorescence was detected in the nuclei of these cells. However, we found that cells expressing GFP-PKD-ΔPH showed a dramatic nuclear accumulation of this protein (Fig. 2). The same distribution was detected with another chimeric protein between RFP from Discosoma sp. fused to the C terminus of PKD-ΔPH in Swiss 3T3 cells (PKD-ΔPH-RFP) (data not shown). The molecular mass of GFP-PKD-ΔPH or PKD-ΔPH-RFP (∼125 kDa) far exceeds the size limit for passive nuclear diffusion (60 kDa) (35Gerace L. Cell. 1995; 82: 341-344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 36Görlich D. Mattaj I.W. Science. 1996; 271: 1513-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar, 37Dingwall C.

Chem. 2001; 276: 20805-20808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), suggesting that the deletion of the PH domain of PKD could promote its nuclear localization by unmasking a normally silent nuclear localization signal (NLS). Alternatively, the deletion of the PH domain could prevent the nuclear export of PKD and cause its nuclear accumulation. If this second interpretation is correct, interference with the nuclear export machinery should also cause the nuclear accumulation of PKD. Leptomycin B (LMB) is an antifungal antibiotic (39Hamamoto T. Gunji S. Tsuji H. Beppu T. J. Antibiot. 1983; 36: 639-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) that inhibits the formation of complexes consisting of Crm1, RanGTP, and proteins containing a leucine-rich nuclear export signal (NES), thereby blocking nuclear export (40Fornerod M. Ohno M. Yoshida M. Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1997; 90: 1051-1060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1744) Google Scholar, 41Ossareh-Nazari B. Bachelerie F. Dargemont C.

Biol. 1997; 4: 139-147Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). In order to test whether LMB had any effect on the cellular distribution of PKD, Swiss 3T3 cells transiently transfected with GFP-PKD were incubated with LMB (10 ng/ml) for 1 h, and the distribution of GFP-PKD was analyzed by imaging live cells with a LSCM. As shown in Fig. 2, GFP-PKD accumulated in the nuclei of Swiss 3T3 cells incubated with LMB. In contrast, LMB had no effect on the nuclear accumulation of GFP-PKD-ΔPH (Fig. 2). In order to determine whether the nucleocytoplasmic transport of PKD is restricted to Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts, we also analyzed the nuclear transport of GFP-PKD in MDCK epithelial cells transfected with pGFP-PKD. MDCK cells are one of the best studied epithelial cell model systems (44Celis J.E. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1994: 79-95Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, GFP-PKD also accumulated in the nuclei of proliferating MDCK cells incubated with LMB, indicating that the nuclear transport of PKD was not restricted to fibroblasts. GFP-PKD expression or LMB incubation up to 3 h had no effect on the morphology of Swiss 3T3 or MDCK cells (data not shown). The nuclear accumulation of PKD was not due to the fluorescent tag or protein overexpression as revealed by immunocytochemistry of nontagged PKD. Exogenous nontagged (exPKD) expressed by transient transfection and endogenous PKD (enPKD) accumulated in the nuclei of dividing Swiss 3T3 incubated with LMB (Fig. 2). The localization of endogenous PKD in the cells treated with LMB corresponded to the nuclear compartment as revealed by 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) costaining of those cells (Fig. 2). Inclusion of the immunizing peptide encompassing the C terminus of PKD completely prevented the staining of the endogenous PKD (data not shown). To rule out any effect of the fluorescent tag on the nuclear transport of PKD, we analyzed the intracellular distribution of GFP-tagged actin in Swiss 3T3 in the presence of LMB. GFP-actin was detected in the cytoplasm of either LMB-treated or -untreated cells as a diffuse immunofluorescent signal (G-actin) or associated with microfilaments (F-actin). LMB did not induce any detectable nuclear accumulation of GFP-actin. The results in Fig. 2 demonstrate that PKD shuttles between the cytoplasm and nuclei and that the nuclear export of PKD can be prevented by blocking the Crm1-dependent nuclear export pathway with LMB. In order to identify the domain(s) of PKD responsible for its nuclear import and export, different GFP-tagged PKD mutants were expressed transiently in Swiss 3T3 cells, and the distribution of these molecules was monitored with an epifluorescence microscope in live cells incubated with or without LMB. Nuclear accumulation of any mutated PKD, in the absence of LMB, would indicate a defect in its nuclear export. Conversely, lack of nuclear accumulation of any mutated PKD in the presence of LMB would indicate a defect in its nuclear import. As showed in Fig. 2, deletion of the complete PH domain of PKD caused the nuclear accumulation of GFP-PKD-ΔPH in the absence of LMB, suggesting that this domain was involved in the nuclear export but not the import of PKD. Further support for this conclusion was obtained by analyzing the intracellular distribution of two different PH domain mutant proteins in Swiss 3T3 cells. The first one, GFP-PKDΔ1–4β, lacks the four β-sheets of the β-barrel of the PH domain encompassing amino acids 429–474, whereas the second one, GFP-PKDΔα, lacks the carboxyl-terminal α-helix encompassing amino acids 535–557. We found that both mutant proteins accumulated in the nuclei of Swiss 3T3 cells in the absence of LMB (Fig.3). Since both mutations target different regions of the PH domain and they involve different size deletions (45 and 22 amino acid residues in GFP-PKDΔ1–4β and GFP-PKDΔα, respectively) our results suggested that the integrity of this domain, rather than a particular signal, was critical for the nuclear export of PKD. We obtained further support for this conclusion by mutating a stretch of amino acids similar to a leucine-rich NES in the PH domain of PKD (amino acids 474–480). Similar mutations within the NES in other proteins abrogate the NES function (45Fischer U. Huber J. Boelens W.C. Mattaj I.W. Lührmann R.

The simultaneous mutation to alanine of the leucine residues 478 and 480 within the putative NES in the PH domain of PKD did not prevent the nuclear export of GFP-PKD-L478A/L480A (data not shown), confirming that the integrity of the PH domain is critical for the nuclear export of PKD. Our results also implied that the nuclear export of PKD may occur via interaction, very likely mediated by its PH domain, with an adaptor protein(s) that is exported from the nucleus by a Crm1-dependent nuclear export pathway. The N-terminal regulatory region of PKD, in addition to its PH domain, contains a phorbol ester/DAG-binding CRD (1Valverde A.M. Sinnett-Smith J. Van Lint J. Rozengurt E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8572-8576Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). We identified within the CRD of PKD a region encompassing amino acid residues 184–201 with homology to known classical bipartite NLS (50Dingwall C. Laskey R.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 478-481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1713) Google Scholar) that could be involved in the nuclear import of PKD. Consequently, we analyzed the intracellular distribution of another set of GFP-tagged PKD proteins with mutations in the CRD of PKD (see Fig. 1). The GFP-PKD-ΔCRD mutant contains a deletion of the entire CRD domain (encompassing amino acid residues 145–353), while the GFP-PKD-P287G mutant contains a proline to glycine substitution within the second cysteine-rich motif of the CRD. While the CRD deletion prevented the binding of phorbol esters/DAG to PKD, the P287G mutation significantly diminished it (7Iglesias T. Matthews S. Rozengurt E. FEBS Lett. 1998; 437: 19-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, GFP-PKD-P287G was imported into the nuclei to the same extent as wild type PKD as revealed by its accumulation in the presence of LMB. Contrary to GFP-PKD-P287G, GFP-PKD-ΔCRD was excluded from the nuclei despite the presence of LMB (Fig. 4), suggesting that the nuclear import of PKD depends on its CRD but very unlikely on phorbol ester/DAG binding. The CRD of PKD contains a tandem repeat of cysteine-rich zinc finger-like motifs, termed cys1 and cys2, that are not functionally eq"
https://openalex.org/W2157195562,"Warfarin targets vitamin K 2,3-epoxide reductase (VKOR), the enzyme that produces reduced vitamin K, a required cofactor for g-carboxylation of vitamin K-dependent proteins. To identify VKOR, we used 4'-azido-warfarin-3H-alcohol as an affinity label. When added to a partially purified preparation of VKOR, two proteins were identified by mass spectrometry as calumenin and cytochrome B5. Rat calumenin was cloned and sequenced and the recombinant protein was produced. When added to an in vitro test system, the 47 kDa recombinant protein was found to inhibit VKOR activity and to protect the enzyme from warfarin inhibition. Calumenin was also shown to inhibit the overall activity of the complete vitamin K-dependent g-carboxylation system. The results were repeated in COS-1 cells overexpressing recombinant calumenin. By comparing calumenin mRNA levels in various tissues from normal rats and warfarin-resistant rats, only the livers from resistant rats were different from normal rats by showing increased levels. Partially purified VKOR from resistant and normal rat livers showed no differences in Km-values, specific activity, and sensitivity to warfarin. A novel model for genetic warfarin resistance in the rat is proposed, whereby the concentration of calumenin in liver determines resistance."
https://openalex.org/W1965993744,"Peroxisomes are metabolically active organelles that participate in the oxidation of long-chain fatty acids and in the biosynthesis of bile acids, cholesterol, and ether phospholipids. Even though maintenance of a stable acid-base milieu is essential for proper peroxisomal function, the determination of the peroxisomal pH (pHp) remains inconclusive, and little is known about its regulation. To measure the pH of intact peroxisomesin situ, we used the peroxisome-specific carboxyl-terminal targeting sequence, SKL, to deliver a pH-sensitive mutant of the green fluorescent protein (pHluorin-SKL) selectively into peroxisomes. Proper targeting was verified by colocalization with the peroxisomal marker catalase. Peroxisomes were visualized by imaging fluorescence microscopy, and ratiometric measurements were combined with calibration using ionophores or a null-point method to estimate pHp. The pHp was between 6.9 and 7.1, resembling the cytosolic pH. Manipulation of the cytosolic pH in intact cells or after permeabilization of the plasmalemma with streptolysin O revealed that pHp changed in parallel, suggesting that the peroxisomal membrane is highly permeable to H+ (equivalents). We conclude that peroxisomes do not regulate their pH independently, but instead their large H+ permeability effectively connects them with the buffer reservoir of the cytoplasm and with the homeostatic mechanisms that control cytosolic pH."

Contrary to a recent report of divalent cation sensitivity and photoactivation of DAF-2 (Broillet, M. C., Randin, O., and Chatton, J. Y.

Ca2+ enhances not the conversion of DAF-2 into its fluorescent product (DAF-2 triazole) but the release of NO from NO donors. Therefore it is concluded that DAF-2 can provide reliable information on NO production in biological systems regardless of the dynamic changes of Ca2+concentration.

Methods in Enzymology, Vol. 269. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1996Google Scholar). Because of its instability and low concentration in biological systems, it had been difficult to perform direct NO detection with satisfactory sensitivity. We have developed diaminofluoresceins and diaminorhodamines as fluorescent indicators for NO that overcome those difficulties and allow bioimaging of NO with high spatial and temporal resolution (2Kojima H.

Chem. 2001; 73: 1967-1973Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). 4,5-Diaminofluorescein (DAF-2)1 has particularly advantageous properties for fluorescence microscopy, and DAF-2 and its derivatives have been widely used in practical studies using cultured cells or tissues (7–18). However, Broillet et al. (19Broillet M.C. Randin O. Chatton J.Y. FEBS Lett. 2001; 491: 227-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) recently reported divalent cation sensitivity and photoactivation of DAF-2. They carried out fluorometric analysis and intracellular NO imaging by use of DAF-2 with NO donors such as S-nitrosocysteine (SNC), DETA NONOate (DETA/NO), and sodium nitroprusside (SNP). They suggested that DAF-2 fluorescence is influenced by factors other than the concentration of NO itself. In their experiments using several NO donors, apparent potentiation of the fluorescent response of DAF-2 in the presence of Ca2+, Mg2+, or incident light was observed. They proposed that divalent cations interact with the DAF-2·NO complex and favor the reaction toward the fluorescent product and that the light used to excite the fluorophore interacts with DAF-2 molecules to produce more fluorescent product. However, they did not consider the possibility that the divalent cations and intense light they used interacted with the NO donors, not with DAF-2. It is generally accepted that the NO release rates of many NO donors (especially S-nitrosothiols) are strongly influenced by divalent cation concentration in the medium (20Noble D.R. Williams D.L.H. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 2001; II: 13-17Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Furthermore,S-nitrosothiols absorb visible light in the range of λ = 550–600 nm (although the molar absorption coefficient is low), and it is known that irradiation of S-nitrosothiols with light (λ = 550 nm) results in the generation of thiyl radical and NO (21Singh R.J. Hogg N. Joseph J. Kalyanaraman B. FEBS Lett. 1995; 360: 47-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In this report, we carried out fluorometric analysis by use of DAF-2 with NO gas to examine the influence of divalent cations on the reaction of DAF-2 and NO itself. In this simple reaction system, we established that the ability of DAF-2 to detect NO is independent of Ca2+ and Mg2+ at physiological concentrations. Fluorescence measurements were performed with a PerkinElmer LS-50B Luminescence Spectrometer with an excitation wavelength of 485 nm and an emission wavelength of 530 nm. The slit width was 2.5 nm for both excitation and emission. NO solution or NO donors SNC, DETA/NO, and SNP were added to Ringer's solution containing DAF-2 (15 μm) at the beginning of each experiment. A Ca2+/Mg2+-free Ringer's solution containing 145 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 20 mmHEPES or Ringer's solution containing 2 mmCa2+ or Mg2+ was used. The free Ca2+ and Mg2+ concentrations were determined using the software WEBMAXC v2.10 (22Bers D.M. Patton C.W. Nuccitelli R. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 40: 3-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). Reactions were performed in a 10-mm quartz cuvette at 37 °C at pH 7.6. The volume of the reaction medium was 3 ml. All reactions were carried out at least in duplicate, and their exact reproducibilities were confirmed. The data shown in the figures are representative of these experiments. UV absorption analyses of the conversion of SNC to cystine were performed with a Shimadzu UV-1600 UV-visible spectrophotometer. SNC was added at 0.5 mm to the different Ringer's solutions at the beginning of each experiment, and the absorbance was monitored at λ = 336 nm. Reactions were performed in a 10-mm quartz cuvette at 37 °C at pH 7.6. The volume of the reaction medium was 3 ml. UV absorption analyses of the NO generation from SNC were performed with a TCI NOX-1000, a NO 2−detector based on the Griess method in which a reactor and an absorption spectrometer are combined. Preparation of the SNC solution was the same as the UV absorption analyses of the conversion of SNC to cystine. We used the NO 2−mode of TCI NOX-1000 because reductive cleavage of the S–NO bond of SNC occurs in the NO 2−/ NO 3− mode by the copper-cadmium reduction column and prevents accurate determination. All reactions were carried out at least in duplicate, and their exact reproducibilities were confirmed. The data shown in the figures are representative of these experiments. NO solution was prepared by bubbling NO through HEPES buffer for 2 min after the buffer had been deoxidized by bubbling argon through it for 1 h, and NO concentration of the NO solution was determined by the Griess method. SNC was prepared according to the method in the literature (23Hart T.W. Tetrahedron Lett. 1985; 26: 2013-2016Crossref Scopus (386) Google Scholar) and dissolved in Ringer's solution. DETA/NO (Dojindo Laboratories, Kumamoto, Japan) was dissolved in 0.1m NaOH aqueous solution. DAF-2 was dissolved in Me2SO to obtain a 10 mm stock solution. The NO donors and DAF-2 were then further diluted to the required concentration in the respective Ringer's solutions for particular experiments. We first examined the influence of Ca2+ and Mg2+ on the reaction of DAF-2 and NO. To rule out involvement of factors other than DAF-2 and NO, we used NO gas itself instead of the NO donors that Broillet et al. (19Broillet M.C. Randin O. Chatton J.Y. FEBS Lett. 2001; 491: 227-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) used. Time courses of DAF-2 fluorescence increase by various concentrations of NO were recorded in Ca2+/Mg2+-free Ringer's solution and in Ringer's solution containing 2 mmCa2+ or Mg2+. Almost identical time courses of DAF-2 fluorescence increase were obtained for each NO concentration regardless of whether divalent cations were present or not as shown in Fig. 1. These results clearly show that the increase of DAF-2 fluorescence intensity is independent of the presence of Ca2+ or Mg2+. Next we repeated the experiments using on NO donor such as SNC, DETA/NO, or SNP instead of NO gas, essentially repeating the work of Broillet et al. (19Broillet M.C. Randin O. Chatton J.Y. FEBS Lett. 2001; 491: 227-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) did in their report. The time courses of fluorescence clearly varied depending on the presence of divalent cation in the case of SNC as the NO donor as shown in Fig.2. This is in agreement with the finding of Broillet et al. (19Broillet M.C. Randin O. Chatton J.Y. FEBS Lett. 2001; 491: 227-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar); while in our experiments, time courses were not significantly influenced by divalent cations in the case where DETA/NO and SNP were used as NO donors (not shown). Broilletet al. (19Broillet M.C. Randin O. Chatton J.Y. FEBS Lett. 2001; 491: 227-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) hypothesized in their report that this enhancement of fluorescence intensity is due to the interaction of the divalent cations with the DAF-2·NO complex and favors the reaction toward the fluorescent product DAF-2 triazole. However, this proposal is in conflict with our results by the use of NO gas mentioned above. To explain the difference between the results by the use of NO gas and the results by the use of chemical compounds that generate NO gas contrary to Broillet et al. (19Broillet M.C. Randin O. Chatton J.Y. FEBS Lett. 2001; 491: 227-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that the divalent cations enhance not the conversion of DAF-2 into its fluorescent product (DAF-2 triazole) but the release of NO from NO donors. This idea is supported by a previous report that the NO release rate from SNC is strongly influenced by certain divalent cations attributable to coordination of the cation to SNC (20Noble D.R. Williams D.L.H. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 2001; II: 13-17Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar). We therefore monitored the conversion of SNC to cystine in the presence and absence of divalent cations by measuring the absorption of SNC at λ = 336 nm. As shown in Fig. 3a, the conversion of SNC to cystine was greatly enhanced by Ca2+. The magnitude of the DAF-2 fluorescence enhancement by Ca2+ and that of the SNC decay enhancement by Ca2+ were very similar and consistent with each other. Next we directly monitored the NO generation that occurred coincidentally with the conversion of SNC to cystine by quantitative determination of NO 2− using the Griess method. We used the TCI NOX-1000 system because rapid determination was required for this experiment. As shown in Fig. 3b, we also confirmed that the NO generation from SNC was greatly enhanced by Ca2+ and that the generation of NO in the presence or absence of divalent cation was consistent with the SNC decay in the respective condition monitored by measuring the absorption of SNC. These results demonstrate that the divalent cation enhances NO generation from SNC and consequently enhances the increase of DAF-2 fluorescence intensity. In the case where DETA/NO and SNP were used as NO donors, conversion of NO donor and NO generation was not significantly influenced by divalent cations compared with the case of SNC as the NO donor (not shown). These results of UV absorption analysis are also consistent with those of the corresponding fluorometric analysis. Our experiments presented in this paper by the use of NO gas itself instead of the NO donors clearly showed that the increase of DAF-2 fluorescence intensity is independent of the presence of Ca2+ or Mg2+. This result means that the rate constants of each reaction step in the reaction of DAF-2 and NO under aerobic condition are not influenced by the presence of the divalent cations. Broillet et al. (19Broillet M.C. Randin O. Chatton J.Y. FEBS Lett. 2001; 491: 227-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) reported that the increase of DAF-2 fluorescence intensity was enhanced 170-fold with NO generated by SNC in the presence of Ca2+ compared with the absence of Ca2+. They also reported that the enhancement was smaller with DETA/NO (10-fold) and with SNP (22-fold) in the presence of Ca2+ compared with the absence of Ca2+ (19Broillet M.C. Randin O. Chatton J.Y. FEBS Lett. 2001; 491: 227-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), although the extent was much different from our data. If Ca2+ actually enhances the conversion of DAF-2 into its fluorescent product, the magnitude of the reaction enhancement by Ca2+ should be similar for each NO donor. Therefore these various magnitudes of the DAF-2 fluorescence enhancement by Ca2+ themselves indicate that their interpretation is not correct. From these various magnitudes of the DAF-2 fluorescence enhancement by Ca2+ with the respective NO donors, we hypothesized that the Ca2+ interacts with the respective NO donors, not the DAF-2, its NO adduct, or NO itself. This hypothesis was confirmed by the following UV absorption analysis. The conversion rate of the NO donors monitored by UV absorption and the NO release rate of NO donors monitored by the Griess method were greatly influenced by the divalent cations; that is, the amount of NO itself generated by the NO donors is varied in the presence of divalent cations. From these results, we concluded that the enhancement of DAF-2 fluorescence in the presence of divalent metal cations reported by Broillet et al. (19Broillet M.C. Randin O. Chatton J.Y. FEBS Lett. 2001; 491: 227-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) was derived from the interaction of the metal cation with the NO donor, not the DAF-2, its NO adduct, or NO itself as illustrated in Scheme FS1. Broillet et al. (19Broillet M.C. Randin O. Chatton J.Y. FEBS Lett. 2001; 491: 227-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) also reported the enhancement of DAF-2 fluorescence by intense light. However, it is well known that irradiation of S-nitrosothiols with light (λ = 550 nm) results in the generation of the thiyl radical and NO (21Singh R.J. Hogg N. Joseph J. Kalyanaraman B. FEBS Lett. 1995; 360: 47-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), so it is likely that irradiation of DAF-2 with SNC would result in an increase of NO release from SNC, leading to the increase of DAF-2 fluorescence intensity. Broillet et al. (19Broillet M.C. Randin O. Chatton J.Y. FEBS Lett. 2001; 491: 227-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) used 2,7-dichlorofluorescein (DCFH) as a control in their photoactivation experiments, but the sensitivities for NO of DAF-2 and DCFH are extremely different, DAF-2 being more than 3000-fold more sensitive than DCFH (the limit of detection is 5 nm for DAF-2 (2Kojima H. Nakatsubo N. Kikuchi K. Kawahara S. Kirino Y. Nagoshi H. Hirata Y. Nagano T. Anal. Chem. 1998; 70: 2446-2453Crossref PubMed Scopus (1188) Google Scholar) and 16 μm for DCFH (24Gunasekar P.G. Kanthasamy A.G. Borowitz J.L. Isom G.E. J. Neurosci. Methods. 1995; 61: 15-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar)), so DCFH was not an appropriate control in this experiments. We conclude that the reaction of DAF-2 and NO is independent of Ca2+ and Mg2+ at physiological concentrations. Therefore, we consider that DAF-2, which is easy to use for fluorescence microscopic studies with living cells without complex techniques, can provide reliable information on NO production regardless of the dynamic changes of Ca2+ concentration in biological systems. However, experiments using NO donors, especially SNC, will need to take account of changes in divalent cations irrespective of the indicator being used. We thank M. Morita for helpful advice about NO determination using the Griess method."
https://openalex.org/W1987569391,"Alcohol consumption and viral hepatitis infection synergistically accelerate liver injury, but the underlying mechanism is not fully understood. Here we have examined the effects of ethanol on hepatitis B protein X (HBX)- or hepatitis C core protein (HCV core protein)-mediated activation of NF-kappaB, a critical signal in hepatic injury, regeneration, and tumor transformation. Acute ethanol or acetaldehyde exposure potentiates HBX or HCV core protein activation of NF-kappaB in primary mouse hepatocytes. Such potentiation can be abolished by blocking ethanol metabolism or overexpression of dominant negative NF-kappaB-inducing kinase (NIK), IkappaB kinase (IKK), or IkappaB. Moreover, pertussis toxin attenuates NF-kappaB activation induced by acetaldehyde but not by HBX or HCV core protein, whereas HBX or HCV core protein-mediated activation of NF-kappaB is abolished completely in tumor necrosis factor a receptor 1 (TNFR1) (-/-) hepatocytes. Finally, chronic ethanol consumption induces hepatic CYP2E1 protein expression and potentiates HBX or HCV core protein activation of NF-kappaB in the liver. These findings suggest that ethanol activates hepatic NF-kappaB via its metabolism and that HBX or HCV core protein activates hepatic NF-kappaB via TNFR1. With the essential role of TNFR1 in alcoholic liver injury, targeting TNFR1 by hepatitis viral proteins could contribute to cooperative effects of alcohol consumption and viral hepatitis on liver disease."

Rev. 1997; 77: 51-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). They comprise a gene family; at present seven isoforms have been identified in mammalian cells (NHE1 to NHE7). The first five isoforms are in the secretory pathway, mainly in the plasma membrane (1Counillon L. Pouyssegur J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). In contrast, NHE6 is suggested to localize in mitochondria (3Numata M. Petrecca K. Lake N. Orlowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6951-6959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), and NHE7 is suggested to be targeted to thetrans-Golgi network (4Numata M. Orlowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17387-17394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). NHE6 is of particular interest to us, because it has a similar topology and hydrophobicity to plasma membrane counterparts but might localize in the mitochondria. The N-terminal hydrophilic portion of NHE6, which is rich in positively charged residues, is thought to be a mitochondrial-targeting sequence (see Fig. 1). The following membrane domain is highly hydrophobic, suggesting that it is targeted to ER via a signal-recognition particle-mediated mechanism. It is critical to establish the localization signal of the unique isoform of NHE proteins to clarify the intracellular sorting process of various membrane proteins. The majority of membrane proteins in the endocytotic and exocytotic pathways are integrated into the ER membrane and then sorted to their final destinations via vesicle transport (5Sakaguchi M. Current Opin. Biotech. 1997; 8: 595-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The initial targeting process to the ER is mediated by the signal-recognition particle and signal-recognition particle receptor (6Walter P. Johnson A.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 87-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar) and then the nascent polypeptides are integrated into the lipid bilayer via a translocon consisting of the Sec61 complex (7Johnson A.E. van Waes M.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 799-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). The ER-targeting signal is defined by a hydrophobic segment of the nascent polypeptide chain. We have studied the topogenesis of the type I signal-anchor membrane proteins in the ER membrane and the mitochondrial outer membrane, whose hydrophobic segments have the amino-terminus on exoplasmic side and the carboxy-terminus on cytoplasmic side (Nexo/Ccyto topology). Synaptotagmin II, a type I signal-anchor protein in the secretory pathway, is targeted to and integrated into the ER membrane just after the hydrophobic segment emerges from the ribosome, indicating that targeting to the ER membrane is a co-translational process (8Kida Y. Sakaguchi M. Fukuda M. Mikoshiba K. Mihara K. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 719-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In contrast, Tom20 protein, which is a type I signal-anchor protein on the mitochondrial outer membrane and a primary receptor of precursor proteins for mitochondria (9Abe Y. Shodai T. Muto T. Mihara K. Torii H. Nishikawa S. Endo T. Kohda D. Cell. 2000; 100: 551-560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar), is post-translationally targeted to mitochondria. Mitochondria targeting of Tom20 protein is mediated by a characteristic signal in which there is a segment relatively less hydrophobic and a following motif with net positive charges (10Kanaji S. Iwahashi J. Kida Y. Sakaguchi M. Mihara K. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 277-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). An increase in the hydrophobicity of the Tom20 membrane-anchor segment results in a switch of the targeting function from mitochondrial targeting to ER targeting, indicating that the high hydrophobicity of the segment is a dominant determinant for the co-translational ER-targeting pathway (10Kanaji S. Iwahashi J. Kida Y. Sakaguchi M. Mihara K. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 277-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that the NHE6 protein is targeted to the ER membrane rather than to the mitochondria. The present study examined the intracellular localization of the NHE6 protein and the signal sequences for the membrane topogenesis. The data of the present study indicated that NHE6 protein localizes exclusively on the membranes in the secretory pathway and that the N-terminal hydrophobic segment is a signal peptide that directs the molecule to the ER membrane and is then cleaved off.

Each obtained DNA was denatured at 90 °C for 2 min, quickly cooled on ice, and phosphorylated with T4-polynucleotide kinase. After the phosphorylation reaction, the denatured strands were annealed and ligated with pGem5fZ(+) (Promega), which had been digested withEcoRV. The two cDNA fragments were connected at the endogenous StuI site, which appears in the middle portion of the NHE6 coding sequence. The full-length cDNA was subcloned between the HindIII and XbaI sites of the pRcCMV vector (InvitroGen). The obtained NHE6 cDNA was sequenced. Unexpectedly, there were 96 bases inserted between Leu143and Val144 of the originally reported sequence (3Numata M. Petrecca K. Lake N. Orlowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6951-6959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1A). The full-size clone without the insert was also constructed by connecting the N-terminal portion of our cDNA with the original open reading frame cDNA missing the N-terminal portion (KIAA0267) using the overlap extension method (16Horton R.M. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Hunt H.D. Cai Z. Pease L.R. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 217: 270-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). To distinguish the newly obtained cDNA from the original, we termed them NHE6.1 and NHE6.0, respectively. For N-terminal and GFP fusion proteins, each DNA fragment coding for Met1–Gly46, Met1–Phe98, and Met1–Pro123 was obtained by PCR amplification from human liver cDNA and inserted between HindIII andXbaI of the GFP fusion plasmid, pIJGFP (10Kanaji S. Iwahashi J. Kida Y. Sakaguchi M. Mihara K. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 277-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). For NHE1-GFP fusion constructs, the N-terminal portion of NHE1 (Met1–Arg100, Met1–Cys133) was isolated with PCR amplification from human cDNA using the primers ATGCAAGCTTCCACCATGGTTCTGCGGTCT (sense at initiation methionine, HindIII site, the Kozak sequence, and ATG are underlined), TACGTCTAGAGCGCACGTGTGTGTAGTC (antisense at Arg100, with XbaI site), and TACGTCTAGAGCAGCTCTCCGGGACGAT (antisense at Cys133, withXbaI site). The obtained fragments were ligated with pIJGFP digested with HindIII and XbaI. For CD4 derivatives, cDNA encoding human CD4 kindly supplied by Dr. Nakauchi (RIKEN) was subcloned between EcoRI andHindIII of pKCRH2PL (17Mishina M. Kurosaki T. Tobimatsu T. Morimoto Y. Noda M.

Omura T. J. Biochem. 1995; 118: 397-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The thirteen C-terminal residues were deleted by site-directed mutagenesis. Mutagenesis exposed the di-lysine motif on the C terminus, so that the resulting molecule, CD4D, localized only in the ER membrane in the cells (15Ishihara N. Yamashina S. Sakaguchi M. Mihara K. Omura T. J. Biochem. 1995; 118: 397-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 18Shin J. Dunbrack R.L. Lee S. Strominger J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Transfection was performed according to standard procedures using FuGene reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The cells were grown on glass coverslips in culture dishes for 24 h after the transfection. The cells on the coverslips were fixed with 50% methanol, 50% acetone for 2 min at room temperature. After washing two times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), the coverslips were incubated with PBS containing 2% bovine serum albumin for 15 min and then incubated with the primary antibodies: affinity-purified anti-NHE6 IgG, anti-EGFP serum, anti-CD4 monoclonal antibody, or anti-calnexin antibodies. After incubating for 1 h, the coverslips were washed three times with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 and then incubated for 30 min with the FITC or Texas Red-labeled secondary antibodies. The coverslips were washed and mounted on glass slides with VECTASHIELD (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). The sample was examined using confocal laser scanning microscopy. Where indicated, mitochondria were stained with MitoTracker (Molecular Probes). After transfection, COS7 cells (on 10-cm culture dishes) were cultured for 24 h and harvested with a cell lifter (Costar) into 2 ml of PBS and precipitated by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 2 min. Cells were resuspended with PBS containing Complete, mini, and EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture tablets (Roche) and sonicated in a microtube with Bioruptor (Cosmobio) at maximum intensity for 1 min. After brief centrifugation at 3000 × g for 5 min, membranes were precipitated by ultracentrifugation (163000 × g for 10 min). Where indicated, aliquots were treated with either Endo-H or PNGaseF for 2 h at 37 °C under the buffer conditions recommended by the supplier. The aliquots, containing the same equivalents, were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (10% gel) and subsequent immunoblotting using the C-terminal antibodies. Protein bands were visualized with horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit IgG (BIOSOURCE) and ECL reagent (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Chemiluminescence was detected with a LAS1000plus (Fuji, Tokyo, Japan). In vitrotranscription and translation were performed as described previously (19Sakaguchi M. Hachiya N. Mihara K. Omura T. J. Biochem. 1992; 112: 243-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The plasmid (1 μg) was linearized with EcoRI and then transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase at 37 °C for 60 min. The mRNAs were translated in the presence or absence of RM using the cell-free system containing 20% reticulocyte lysate. Salt conditions were optimized as 100 mm potassium acetate and 1.0 mm magnesium acetate. Aliquots were treated with ProK (333 μg/ml) on ice for 30 min in the presence or absence of 0.5% Triton X-100. To improve the resolution of SDS-PAGE, RM was isolated from the translation mixture through a high salt cushion with ultracentrifugation where indicated, as previously described, and was treated with Endo-H (20Ota K. Sakaguchi M. von Heijne G. Hamasaki N. Mihara K. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 495-503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 21Kato Y. Sakaguchi M. Mori Y. Saito K. Nakamura T. Bakker E.P. Sato Y. Goshima S. Uozumi N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6488-6493Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). After the enzyme reactions were terminated with 10% trichloroacetic acid, the precipitated protein was dissolved in SDS sample buffer and analyzed using SDS-PAGE. The gel image was visualized using a phosphoimager (FLA2000; Fuji, Tokyo, Japan). Cell fractionation was performed as described previously (22Saeki K. Suzuki H. Tsuneoka M. Maeda M. Iwamoto R. Hasuwa H. Shida S. Takahashi T. Sakaguchi M. Endo T. Miura Y. Mekada E. Mihara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31996-32002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Rat liver (7.8 g) was homogenized with the homogenization buffer using a Potter homogenizer (10 strokes at 4 °C). The homogenized mixture was centrifuged at 3000 × g for 10 min, and the post-nuclear supernatant was centrifuged at 8000 × g for 10 min to obtain precipitates of the mitochondrial fraction. The post-mitochondrial supernatant was further centrifuged at 200000 × g (55000 rpm) for 1 h to separate the cytosol fraction and microsomal membranes (Ms). NHE6 protein contains two characteristic sequences that seem to possess an organelle-targeting function; the N-terminal sequence rich in positively charged residues, which is predicted to be a mitochondrial-targeting signal, and the highly hydrophobic sequences that seem to be a signal destined for the ER membrane (Fig.1A). To assess the localization of human NHE6, we constructed expression plasmids for NHE6 proteins in which the expression was regulated by the cytomegalovirus promoter. Both cDNAs isolated from human fetal brain and adult liver contained the same 96-base inserts, which encode 32 amino acid residues between Leu143 and Val144 of the reported NHE6 molecule (Fig. 1A, underline). We termed the new version of the NHE6 sequence NHE6.1 to distinguish it from the original sequence (NHE6.0). With the 96-base insertion, the loop between H3 and H4 became more hydrophilic and gained an additional N-glycosylation site (double underlines). The expression plasmid for the NHE6.0 cDNA was also constructed from the previously reported cDNA clone. The constructs for NHE6.0 and NHE6.1 were transiently expressed in COS7 cells, and the location was examined using indirect immunofluorescent microscopy with polyclonal antibodies against the synthetic peptide corresponding to the 15 C-terminal residues of human NHE6. Both constructs localized in the reticular structure and on the cell surface, which is completely different from the mitochondrial marker (MitoTracker; see Fig. 1C). The NHE6 protein signals were not observed in the nontransfected cells (data not shown), indicating that they were specific for the transfected NHE6 gene. To address whether the NHE6 protein signals were located on membrane organelles in the secretory pathway, the expression plasmid for either the marker protein for ER (CD4D) or the cell surface (CD4) was co-transfected (D and E). CD4 is a well known cell surface marker of T-cells, and CD4D is a mutant in which 13 C-terminal residues were deleted to expose the di-lysine motif at the C-terminal and to localize in the ER membrane (18Shin J. Dunbrack R.L. Lee S. Strominger J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1918-1922Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The marker proteins located to the ER and cell surface as expected (D and E). The expressed NHE6.1 and NHE6.0 proteins partially co-localized with the ER resident protein, as well as with the cell surface protein, strongly suggesting that both of the proteins existed in the secretory organelles between the ER and plasma membranes. Even when the N-terminal 39-residue-long positive charge-rich sequence was deleted (ΔN-NHE6.1), the localization of the protein was essentially the same as the original (C, D, and E). Essentially the same results were obtained using other cultured cells, PS120 cells, which had been stably transfected with the expression plasmids for NHE6.0 and NHE6.1 (data not shown). To examine the glycosylation states of the expressed proteins, microsomal membranes were analyzed using SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with the C-terminal antibodies. Each construct had a single major band and diffused signals (vertical bars) of higher molecular weight (Fig. 2,lanes 1 and 6). These bands were not observed in the COS7 cells transfected with only a vector plasmid (data not shown), indicating that the antibodies reacted only with the NHE6 molecule expressed by the plasmid. Following Endo-H treatment, the major bands of NHE6.0 and NHE6.1 were shifted down, but the diffused signals were not affected (lanes 2, 3, 7, and8). PNGaseF treatment, which cleaves off all of theN-linked sugar chains including the complex type, made the diffuse larger signals and the major band the smaller form (lanes 4, 5, 9, and 10). The larger bands of ∼170 kDa, indicated by open circles, are likely to be multimers or aggregates of the NHE proteins, as reported previously (23Wakabayashi S. Pang T. Su X. Shigekawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7942-7949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The enzyme treatments produced essentially the same patterns, even when twice the amount of enzyme was used (compare lanes + and ++), indicating that the enzyme treatment proceeded completely. Take together it is indicated that both NHE6.1 and NHE6.0 were fullyN-glycosylated and were sorted beyond the Golgi compartment to some degree in the cultured cells. The NHE6.0 and NHE6.1 molecules expressed in COS7 cells were primarily targeted to the ER membrane andN-glycosylated. To examine the organelle-targeting function, various N-terminal GFP fusion proteins were constructed (Fig.3, A and B). When the fusion proteins were expressed in COS7 cells, H1-H2-GFP and H1-H2-H3-GFP produced a reticular pattern that was identical with that of the ER marker protein, calnexin; the signals overlapped, producing the yellow color shown in panel A. These results indicated that the N-terminal portion, including H1 and H2, contains sufficient information to target the ER membrane. As a control, we used the NHE isoform, NHE1, which is targeted to the ER (24Counillon L. Pouyssegur J. Reithmeier R.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10463-10469Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 25Tse C.M. Levine S.A. Yun C.H. Khurana S. Donowitz M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12954-12961Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). H1-H2-GFP, in which GFP was fused after the second hydrophobic segment of NHE1, produced a reticular pattern that overlapped with that of calnexin in COS7 cells (Fig. 3C). The mitochondrial-targeting function of the N-terminal-positive-rich sequence was also examined using N30-GFP fusion protein (Fig.3B). This construct did not produce a significant fluorescent GFP signal. Only trace amounts of signal were detected, even when using the anti-GFP antibodies. To address the possibility of rapid degradation via the proteasome system, the effect of lactacystin was examined. After incubation for 8 h with lactacystin, the antibodies produced a significant GFP signal throughout the cell. This signal is diffuse cytoplasmic and not ER, as well as not mitochondrial, suggesting that the N-terminal sequence does not possess the mitochondrial-targeting function. It is likely that the 30 N-terminal residues prevent correct folding of the GFP polypeptide chain and lead to degradation via a proteasome. The data described above indicated that the 98 N-terminal-residue sequence of NHE6, including the two hydrophobic segments, has an ER-targeting function. To further examine the topogenic functions of the N-terminal portion, the topologies of the N-terminal fusion constructs were assessed using a cell-free expression system. GFP fusion after the H1 segment (H1-GFP) was also constructed (Fig. 4A). These constructs were expressed in a reticulocyte lysate system in the presence or absence of RM. Major bands were observed with the expected molecular weights (Fig. 4A, lanes 1, 5, and 9, downward arrowhead). When synthesized in the presence of RM, all of the constructs were efficiently processed (lanes 2, 6, and 10, upward arrowhead). The processed form of H1-GFP was not degraded by ProK treatment (lane 3), whereas it was accessible to the protease in the presence of non-ionic mild detergent (Triton X-100;lane 4). In contrast, the processed form of the H1-H2-GFP construct was degraded by ProK, even in the absence of detergent (lane 7), indicating that the reporter domain was on the cytoplasmic side of RM. The band in lanes 4 and 7is highly likely to be a ProK-resistant core of the folded GFP molecule. The processed form of the H1-H2-H3-construct was ProK-resistant (lane 11), indicating that its GFP domain was on the lumenal side, suggesting that the H3 segment was inserted into the membrane and mediated translocation of the following reporter domain (see Fig. 4C). These results indicated that the N-terminal portion, including the H1 segment, is the signal peptide that mediates translocation of the following portion, the H2 segment interrupts translocation, and the H3 segment again mediates translocation of the GFP domain to the lumenal side (C). These NHE6 fusion proteins had no N-glycosylation sites. A similar experiment was performed using the NHE1 N-terminal portion as a control of the ER-directed NHE isoform (Fig. 4B). The H1-GFP construct shifted little in mobility, even in the presence of RM (lane 2), whereas the full-size band was resistant to ProK (lane 3). Similarly, H1-H2-GFP did not shift down (lane 6) but was degraded by ProK even in the absence of detergent (lane 7). When RM vesicles were isolated by ultracentrifugation and treated with Endo-H, the band clearly shifted down by 2.5 kDa (lanes 9–12). Thus, the H1 of NHE1 behaved as a signal peptide and was then processed off, and the endogenous glycosylation site in the C-terminal flanking region of the processing site was efficiently glycosylated. This is the reason that the mobility of the bands obtained in the absence and presence of RM appeared to be the same. It also indicates that H2 is the stop-transfer sequence, which leaves the following portion on the cytoplasmic side. Taken together, topogenic functions of the N-terminal portions of NHE1 and NHE6 are highly similar; H1 is a signal peptide, and H2 is a stop-transfer sequence, as shown in panel C. To elucidate intracellular localization of NHE6 protein in liver cells, a cell fractionation study was performed. We found a sequence similar to human NHE6 in the rat expression sequence tag data base (GenBankTM accession number AI501017). It is 91% homologous to the region from Thr558 to Ala669of human NHE6. The peptide sequence used for making antibodies is 100% identical in human and rat. Each cell fraction from rat liver was probed using the affinity-purified antibodies (Fig.5A). A major single band was detected in the microsomal fraction (lane 3) but not in the cytosol or mitochondrial fractions. There was no shift in mobility of this band following Endo-H treatment (lane 5), whereas major and minor larger bands shifted down following treatment with PNGaseF (lane 6). The endogenous polypeptide of NHE6 was fullyN-glycosylated and modified into the complex form. To confirm separation of these fractions, they were examined by immunoblotting with the antibodies against H450 (cytosol), cytochrome P450(2C11) (microsomes), and Tom40 (mitochondria) (B). The majority of each marker protein was detected in the expected fractions, indicating that microsomal membranes and mitochondria were clearly separated. The obtained microsomal fraction contained secretory organelles, Golgi, plasma, and ER membranes. These data suggest that the NHE6 molecule locates in the membrane of the secretory pathway and becomes modified in the Golgi compartments. All lines of evidence in the present study demonstrate that the NHE6 molecule localizes on the organelle membranes in the secretory pathway that are derived from ER membranes. The N-terminal hydrophobic segment (H1) of NHE6 is a signal peptide and is cleaved off. The positive charge-rich sequence of the N-terminal portion does not possess a mitochondrial-targeting function. Thus, the H1 portion primarily determines ER targeting as in the case of NHE1. The next hydrophobic segment (H2) of NHE6 and NHE1 interrupts translocation and becomes the transmembrane segment (the so-called stop-transfer sequence). Furthermore, the following H3 segment is able to start the integration of the following portion again (so-called translocation reinitiation sequence). Thus, membrane integration of the N-terminal three transmembrane segments is explained by the conventional co-translational integration model (26Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 1496-1500Crossref PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar, 27Sabatini D.D. Kreibich G. Morimoto T. Adesnik M. J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 6423-6428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The two hydrophobic segments, H2 and H3, meet the requirements for the topogenic functions (28Kuroiwa T. Sakaguchi M. Omura T. Mihara K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6423-6428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 29Kuroiwa T. Sakaguchi M. Mihara K. Omura T. J.

The NHE6 molecule is initially targeted to the ER membrane and is sorted to the organelle membranes toward the plasma membrane. Cell fractionation studies indicated that the molecule expressed in the rat liver cells is sorted toward the plasma membrane as are the other NHE proteins and then becomes resistant to Endo-H treatment. In the cultured cells, both the NHE6.0 and NHE6.1 molecules were located in membranes between the ER and plasma membrane. NHE6.0 and NHE6.1 were more dispersed than the ER marker (CD4D) and less dispersed than the plasma membrane marker (CD4). In contrast to liver cells, significant amounts expressed in COS7 cells were Endo-H-sensitive. It is probable that they were too highly expressed in the cell to be fully sorted through the Golgi compartment. The exit efficiency from the ER seems to be highly dependent on the molecular character; e.g. the H1-H2-GFP fusion protein almost completely merged with the ER marker protein, indicating that it was not sorted out from the ER. Generally, a variety of membrane proteins are retained in the ER by the ER quality control mechanisms (31Kopito R.R. Cell. 1997; 88: 427-430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 32Hammond C. Helenius A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 523-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). Anyway, it is clearly demonstrated that in liver cells, as well as COS cells, the NHE6 proteins are completely N-glycosylated in the ER membrane. The present results have implications for membrane topogenesis of the NHE family proteins. The N-terminal first hydrophobic segment (H1) of NHE1 and NHE6 was cleaved off in vitro. The algorithm for prediction of signal peptides by Nielsen et al. (33Nielsen H. Engelbrecht J. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (4942) Google Scholar) suggests that both H1 segments are cleavable signal sequences, and the processing sites of NHE6 and NHE1 are Ala56 and Ala35, respectively. The H1 segment of NHE3 is a signal peptide (34Zizak M. Cavet M.E. Bayle D. Tse C.M. Hallen S. Sachs G. Donowitz M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8102-8112Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Other isoforms, NHE2, NHE4, NHE5, and NHE7, are also predicted to have signal peptides. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that the N-terminal hydrophobic segments of other isoforms are also signal peptides. The positive charge-rich segment is not a mitochondrial-targeting sequence. The sequence is too rich in positive charges, and hydrophobic residues are rare, so it does not meet the proposed requirements for the presequence of the matrix-targeted sequence (35Bedwell D.M. Strobel S.A. Yun K. Jongeward G.D. Emr S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1014-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 36Roise D. Horvath S.J. Tomich J.M. Richards J.H. Schatz G.

The previous reports that the NHE6.0 protein located exclusively in mitochondria (3Numata M. Petrecca K. Lake N. Orlowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6951-6959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar,4Numata M. Orlowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17387-17394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) are inconsistent with the present results, and the reason for the discrepancy remains to be clarified. They provide one immunofluorescent experiment, where NHE6-GFP fusion was located in dot structures in HeLa cells (3Numata M. Petrecca K. Lake N. Orlowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6951-6959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). As mentioned by the authors, the GFP signal was not very correspondent with the mitochondrial marker, and the protein aggregates could have resulted in the apparent colocalization (3Numata M. Petrecca K. Lake N. Orlowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6951-6959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). It is also reported that NHE6-HA fusion expressed in the stably transfected Chinese hamster ovary cell line under the control of inducible promoter was fractionated in the mitochondrion-enriched fraction (P10 pellet), whereas the NHE7-HA fusion protein was associated with the microsomal enriched membrane fraction (P100 pellet) (4Numata M. Orlowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17387-17394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). They provided no data concerning glycosylation status. Although the difference among the cell-fractionation studies are unresolved at present, all the data in this study of the localization in the COS cells, the N-glycosylation status, the presence of the ER-targeting signal peptide, and the localization of NHE6 protein with Endo-H-resistant and PNGaseF-sensitive sugar chain in microsomal fraction from liver cells, demonstrated the localization of the NHE6 protein in the membrane organelles derived from ER. In the present study, the isolated NHE6.1 cDNA was identical to the reported NHE6 sequence (3Numata M. Petrecca K. Lake N. Orlowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6951-6959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) except that it possesses a 96-base insert coding for 32 amino acid residues (Fig. 1A). The insertion is directly connected to previous sequences in the human genome data base (GenBankTM accession number AC025232), indicating that this 96-base sequence is transcribed as a single exon including the preceding sequence. We isolated the NHE6.1 version of cDNAs from three independent human mRNA sources, fetal brain, fetal liver, and adult liver (data not shown), suggesting that the NHE6.1 mRNA is expressed in various tissues. NHE6.0 cDNA, however, was not detected (data not shown). The mechanisms for expression regulation and multiplicity of NHE6 mRNA require further investigation. We thank C. Horie for microscopy instructions and DNA construction, Dr. Ukaji for the kind gift of human liver cDNA, C.

A phenylalanine and glutamate of one subunit make mismatched base-specific interactions, and residues of both subunits contact the DNA backbone surrounding the mismatched base, but asymmetrically. A number of amino acids in MutS that contact the DNA are conserved in the eukaryotic Msh2-Msh6 heterodimer. We report here that yeast strains with amino acids substituted for residues inferred to interact with the DNA backbone or mismatched base have elevated spontaneous mutation rates consistent with defective mismatch repair.

Moreover, wild-type Msh2-Msh6 binds with lower affinity to mismatches with thymine replaced by difluorotoluene, which lacks the ability to hydrogen bond. The results suggest that yeast Msh2-Msh6 interacts asymmetrically with the DNA through base-specific stacking and hydrogen bonding interactions and backbone contacts. The importance of these contacts decreases with increasing distance from the mismatch, implying that interactions at and near the mismatch are important for binding in a kinked DNA conformation.

Nature. 2000; 407: 703-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar, 2Lamers M.H. Perrakis A. Enzlin J.H. Winterwerp H.H.K. de Wind N. Sixma T.K. Nature. 2000; 407: 711-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). Subunits A and B of the MutS homodimer are comprised of five domains, and interactions with DNA involve several amino acids in domain I of subunit A and a smaller number of amino acids in domain IV of subunit B (Fig. 1 A). These include sequence-independent van der Waals and hydrogen bonding interactions with the DNA backbone. Also seen is stacking between a mismatched thymine and a phenylalanine known to be essential for DNA binding and MMR in E. coli (3Malkov V.A. Biswas I. Camerini-Otero D. Hsieh P. J. Biol.

The structures further indicate a hydrogen bond between the N3 of the mismatched thymine and the Oε2 of a specific glutamate. Although the Phe and Glu residues are present in both subunits of the homodimer, only the residues in subunit A interact with the mismatched base. Thus, mismatch recognition by bacterial MutS involves interactions with DNA that are asymmetrical in the two subunits. MMR in eukaryotes is initiated by homologs of MutS. Msh2 and Msh6 form a heterodimer that binds to DNA containing base-base and insertion/deletion mismatches (10Drummond J.T. Li G.-M. Longley M.J. Modrich P.

Although structural information on Msh2-Msh6 is not available, two lines of evidence suggest that Msh2-Msh6 also binds to DNA in an asymmetric manner. First, substituting alanine for the phenylalanine in Msh6 (F337A in yMsh6, F432A in hMSH6) that is homologous to the bacterial residue reduces DNA binding and mismatch repair (8Bowers J. Sokolsky T. Quach T. Alani E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16115-16125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 9Dufner P. Marra G. Raschle M. Jiricny J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36550-36555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In contrast, substituting alanine for a tyrosine in Msh2 that aligns at this position (Y42A in yMsh2) had no apparent effect (8Bowers J. Sokolsky T. Quach T. Alani E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16115-16125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Second, structure-based alignments (1Obmolova G. Ban C. Hsieh P. Yang W. Nature. 2000; 407: 703-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar, 2Lamers M.H. Perrakis A. Enzlin J.H. Winterwerp H.H.K. de Wind N. Sixma T.K.

This suggests that Msh6 is the functional homolog of subunit A of MutS, while Msh2 is functionally equivalent to subunit B.Table IComplementation by wild-type and mutant alleles of Msh2 and Msh6Yeast strainmsh3msh6 (subunit A)msh2 (subunit B)TaqresidueE. coli residuemsh6alleleMutation rate (10−6)95% confidence limits (10−6)Relative ratemsh2 alleleMutation rate (10−6)95% confidence limits (10−6)Relative rateNone1,9001,400–3,8001,000None620530–1,800970MSH61.90.7–3.51MSH20.640.4–11Residues that contact the DNA backbone: Pro15Pro12msh6-P313A1.51.2–5.51Not conserved Arg475Lys496msh6-R852A9.16.5–155Not conserved Gly72Gly70msh6-G368A9783–2,00051Not conserved Pro74Pro72msh6-P370A710500–1,300370Not conserved Gln97Gln95msh6-Q393A130110–20068Not conserved Arg110Arg108msh6-R412A2,800970–3,8001,500Not conserved Lys471Lys496msh6-K848A1.40.8–8.51msh2-K654430320–750670Residues that contact the mismatched base: Glu41Glu38msh6-E339A1614–968Not conserved Phe39Phe36msh6-F337A990610–1,600520msh2 Y42A5.80.9–129msh6-F337Y1,200800–2,500630msh6-F337H1,000690–1,600530msh6-F337I1,100920–4,300580msh6-F337K2,200490–20,1001,200Mutation rates and 95% confidence limits were calculated as described previously (16Drotschmann K.

Here we test these predictions by examining the effects of substitutions in the conserved amino acids in Msh6 and Msh2 that are equivalent to those in subunits A and B of MutS that interact with DNA. We substitute alanine for seven residues in Msh6 and one in Msh2 that are inferred to contact the backbone at varying distances from the mismatch. The results support the hypothesis of functional asymmetry in Msh2-Msh6, and by extrapolation in MutS, whose identical subunits are functionally difficult to distinguish. We provide evidence that residues in domain IV of Msh2 are important for DNA binding and reveal the importance of Msh6 and Msh2 contacts with the backbone within three base pairs of the mismatch. We also examine the roles of two amino acids inferred to make specific contacts with the mismatched base. We test the importance of the Phe337 aromatic ring stack with the mismatched base by replacing Phe337 in Msh6 not only with alanine (as in Refs. 8Bowers J. Sokolsky T. Quach T. Alani E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16115-16125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar and 9Dufner P. Marra G. Raschle M. Jiricny J. J. Biol.

This includes tyrosine, which strongly reduces MMR function via mere addition of a hydroxyl group. Finally, we use both amino acid replacement and DNA substrate modification to test the hypothesis that the side chain of Glu339 in Msh6 forms a hydrogen bond with the mismatched base. Comparison with a recent study of MutS reveals common features and distinct differences between the bacterial and eukaryotic proteins when this glutamate is replaced with alanine (14Schofield M.J.

Purification of yeast Msh2-Msh6, ATP hydrolysis, and gel mobility shift experiments were performed as described.2 The latter uses 20-μl reactions containing 100 nm protein and 10 nm radiolabeled oligonucleotide DNA substrates. Homoduplex and heteroduplex DNA contained oligonucleotide UP-T (F) (5′-TCG TTT TAC AAC GTC GTG AAT GAG AAA ACC CTG GCG TTA CC-3′) or UP-F (5′-TCG TTT TAC AAC GTC GTG AAF GAG AAA ACC CTG GCG TTA CC-3′) hybridized to one of the following oligonucleotides: LO-A (F) (5′-GG TAA CGC CAG GGT TTT CTC ATT CAC GAC GTT GTA AAA CGA-3′, LO-G (F) (5′-GG TAA CGC CAG GGT TTT CTC GTT CAC GAC GTT GTA AAA CGA-3′), or LO-loop (F) (5′-GG TAA CGC CAG GGT TTT CTC TTC ACG ACG TTG TAA AAC GA-3′) (the nucleotide forming the mismatch is underlined).K d values were calculated as described previously (17Schofield M.J. Nayak S. Scott T.H. Du C. Hsieh P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28291-28299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) from band shift analysis performed using 1.0 nm DNA substrate and 0.1–250 nm wild-type or mutant Msh2-Msh6 protein. Filter binding in the reaction mix used for gel shift experiments was analyzed as described previously (18Hall M.C. Wang H. Erie D.A. Kunkel T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 312: 637-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Fig.1 A illustrates the protein-DNA interactions of Taq MutS bound to DNA containing an extra thymine in one strand (left side) and E. coliMutS bound to a T· G mismatch (right). The hypothesis is that Msh2 is functionally equivalent to subunit B of the MutS homodimer, while Msh6 is functionally equivalent to subunit A. In subunit A, several amino acids in domain I (in blue) and a few in domain IV (in red) interact in a sequence-independent manner with the DNA backbone, via van der Waals interactions (blue arrows) or hydrogen bonding (red arrows). Side chains in subunit A also contribute base-specific interactions (Fig. 1, A and B). These include stacking of a phenylalanine ring (Phe39 in Taq MutS and Phe36 in E. coli MutS) with the mismatched thymine and a hydrogen bond between the Oε2 of a glutamate (Glu41 in Taq MutS and Glu38 inE. coli MutS) and the N3 position of the mismatched thymine (Fig. 1 B). In contrast to the extensive interactions of subunit A with DNA, there are fewer interactions with subunit B, and none of these are base-specific. In both the Taq MutS andE. coli MutS structures, two positively charged residues (Lys and Arg, in orange) in domain IV of subunit B interact with the DNA backbone near the region where the DNA is kinked by 60°. An Arg (Taq and E. coli) and a Pro (Taq only) residue in domain I of subunit B also interact with the DNA backbone several nucleotides away from the mismatch (Fig.1 A, residues in lighter blue). Amino acids in Msh6 and Msh2 homologous to those interacting with the DNA backbone in the prokaryotic protein-DNA complexes were changed to alanine. Changes in the mutation rate were monitored by expression of the mutant genes from single-copy plasmids in a yeast strain deficient in msh3 and msh6, using a reporter system that primarily detects one base pair deletions in an A14 run in the LYS2 gene (16Drotschmann K. Clark A.B. Tran H.T. Gordenin D.A. Resnick M.A. Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2970-2975Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Elevated mutation rates characteristic of loss of MMR were observed with several mutants (TableI). Residues Pro313and Arg852 in Msh6 are inferred to contact the DNA backbone four to five base pairs from the mismatch (Fig. 1 A). Alanine substitution for these residues has little effect on the mutation rate. In contrast, strong effects result from alanine substitution for residues inferred to contact the DNA in the vicinity to the mismatch (Fig. 1 A) via van der Waals interactions (Gly368, Pro370, Arg412) and hydrogen bonding (Gln393, Arg412). Effects for the Q393A and R412A mutants were anticipated by a study of different substitutions for these residues (Q393R and R412G) that failed to complement the mutator phenotype of an msh3msh6 mutant yeast strain (19Das Gupta R. Kolodner R.D. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 53-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). These residues are conserved in Msh6 but not in Msh2 (Fig.1 and Table I). The asymmetry of DNA binding by the two subunits is further indicated in studies of conserved Lys residues, Lys471 of Taq and Lys496 of E. coli, which are present in both Msh2 (Lys564) and Msh6 (Lys848). Lys848 in Msh6 is inferred to contact the DNA backbone five nucleotides from the mismatch (e.g.see red K496 in Fig. 1 A, right). Alanine substitution for Lys848 has no effect on the mutation rate (Table I). Lys564 in Msh2 is inferred to contact the DNA backbone near the mismatch (see orange K471 in Fig.1 A, right; orange K496 in Fig. 1 A, left). Alanine substitution for Lys564 strongly elevates the mutation rate (Table I). The data with these mutants and the overall pattern in Table I indicate that the bacterial and eukaryotic MutS dimers have similar asymmetric interactions with the DNA backbone. They further suggest that the importance of the interactions decreases with increasing distance from the mismatch. The side chain of Phe39 in subunit A of Taq MutS stacks with the unpaired thymine base, while the equivalent Phe36 ofE. coli MutS stacks with the thymine of the G·T mismatch (Fig. 1 B). When the homologous Phe337 in yeast Msh6 is changed to alanine, the mutant msh6 allele is unable to complement the msh3msh6 mutant yeast strain (Table I). This confirms studies indicating that this residue is critical for MMR in yeast and human Msh6 (8Bowers J. Sokolsky T. Quach T. Alani E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16115-16125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 9Dufner P. Marra G. Raschle M. Jiricny J. J. Biol.

Here similar MMR defects were conferred by replacing Phe337 with Ile, His, or Lys (TableI). Interestingly, alignments reveal a lysine at this position in yeast Msh3 (1Obmolova G. Ban C. Hsieh P. Yang W. Nature. 2000; 407: 703-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar), which functions with Msh2 to repair certain insertion/deletion mismatches. Genetic evidence indicates that yeast Msh2-Msh3 can participate in repairing the majority of mismatches arising at the LYS2 locus used here (20Clark A.B. Valle F. Drotschmann K. Gary R.K. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36498-36501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The fact that the F337K allele is defective in MMR (Table I) indicates that the well known differences in substrate specificity between Msh2-Msh6 and Msh2-Msh3 cannot be accounted for merely by the amino acid at this position. Not surprisingly, structure-based alignments reveal a number of other differences between Msh3 and Msh6 that could contribute to substrate preferences (1Obmolova G. Ban C. Hsieh P. Yang W. Nature. 2000; 407: 703-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar, 2Lamers M.H. Perrakis A. Enzlin J.H. Winterwerp H.H.K. de Wind N. Sixma T.K. Nature. 2000; 407: 711-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). Even the conservative change of Phe337 to tyrosine in Msh6 results in a strong mutator phenotype indicating near complete loss of MMR (Table I). This is consistent with a simulation based on the structure of Taq MutS, suggesting that the hydroxyl group of Tyr would clash with the base 3′ to the unpaired thymine that stacks with the protein side chain. 3W. Yang, unpublished results. Finally, Tyr42 in yeast Msh2 aligns with the critical phenylalanine in MutS and Msh6 (Fig. 1 C). Previous studies reported that mutating this tyrosine in yeast or human Msh2 does not affect MMR (8Bowers J. Sokolsky T. Quach T. Alani E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16115-16125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 9Dufner P. Marra G. Raschle M. Jiricny J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36550-36555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Here, replacing Tyr42 with alanine yields a mutation rate elevated by 9-fold (Table I). Although this mutator effect is less than for complete disruption ofMSH2, it suggests that Tyr42 is important for MMR. While the homologous phenylalanine in MutS subunit B does not contact the DNA in the crystal structures, replacing an aromatic ring with a methyl group might alter protein conformation to indirectly affect DNA interactions. The only other MutS residue providing base-specific contacts to mismatched DNA is a conserved glutamate residue, Glu41 inTaq MutS and Glu38 in E. coli MutS. The carboxyl oxygen of this glutamate hydrogen bonds with N3 of the mismatched thymine (1Obmolova G. Ban C. Hsieh P. Yang W. Nature. 2000; 407: 703-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar, 2Lamers M.H. Perrakis A. Enzlin J.H. Winterwerp H.H.K. de Wind N. Sixma T.K. Nature. 2000; 407: 711-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). This Glu is absent in yMsh2 but conserved as Glu339 in yMsh6 (Fig. 1 C). Replacing Glu339 in Msh6 with alanine results in a mutation rate that is elevated 8-fold compared with wild-type Msh6 (Table I). This indicates that loss of DNA interactions provided by Glu339, perhaps including the hydrogen bond, reduces but does not completely inactivate MMR activity. Wild-type Msh2-Msh6 and three mutant heterodimers were purified to perform an initial test of DNA binding capacity. Purification2 involved co-eluting Msh6 with Msh2 that was retained on a nickel-chelating column due to an amino-terminal histidine tag, followed by heparin-Sepharose chromatography. Heterodimers of wild-type Msh2 and mutant Msh6 containing the F337A, F337Y, or E339A substitution contained Msh2 and Msh6 in molar ratios similar to that of the wild-type heterodimer (Fig.2 A). Thus, as anticipated based on MutS structures showing that dimerization is via interactions in distal domain V, these mutations in domain I of Msh6 have little effect on heterodimerization. The ATPase activities of the F337A and E339A heterodimers were within 2-fold of wild-type Msh2-Msh6 (K cat/K m = 0.29, 0.13, and 0.15, respectively, for wild-type, F337A, and E339A). This indicates that the Msh6 substitutions do not strongly affect the overall ATPase activity of the heterodimers. This too is consistent with the fact that the ATPase active sites are located in distant domain V (1Obmolova G. Ban C. Hsieh P. Yang W.

As expected based on previous studies (25Harfe B.D. Jinks-Robertson S. Mutat. Res. 2000; 451: 151-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 26Marsischky G.T. Kolodner R.D. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6427-6436Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), wild-type yeast Msh2-Msh6 binds to homoduplex DNA and preferentially to heteroduplex DNA containing either a T-G mismatch thymine or an extra thymine (Fig. 2 B). Mutant heterodimers containing the F337A or F337Y substitutions in Msh6 bind less efficiently to all three substrates (Fig. 2 B, lanes 4–9). The reduced DNA binding capacity of the F337A substitution has been reported (8Bowers J. Sokolsky T. Quach T. Alani E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16115-16125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and is extended here by showing that even the more conservative F337Y replacement reduces DNA binding. These defects correlate with the mutator effects of these substitutions (Table I), indicating that interactions of Phe337 with the mismatched base contribute to binding and that this contribution is critical for MMR activity. The filter binding data (below each lane in Fig. 2, B andD) indicate that the F337A substitution results in substantial loss of discrimination between mismatched and matched DNA, whereas the F337Y mutant appears to retain some discrimination. Reduced binding to both matched and mismatched DNA is observed for the heterodimer containing the E339A substitution in Msh6 (Fig.2 B, lanes 10–12), indicating that this residue also contributes to DNA binding. The K d values for binding of wild-type Msh2-Msh6 to a 41-mer homoduplex and the homologous +T heteroduplex are 1.8 and 0.4 nm, respectively, similar to K d values reported earlier (26Marsischky G.T. Kolodner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26668-26682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The corresponding K d values for the E339A substituted heterodimer were 23 and 21 nm, respectively. Thus, the E339A substitution reduces both binding affinity and binding specificity, which likely contributes to the mutator phenotype. Replacing glutamate with alanine removes the potential to hydrogen bond with the base. To further investigate this hydrogen bonding potential in the wild-type Msh2-Msh6 heterodimer, we examined binding to mismatches in which thymine was replaced by the base analog 2,4-difluorotoluene (designated F). This base analog is shaped like thymine but contains a carbon atom in place of the N3 and lacks hydrogen bonding potential (Fig. 2 C) (28Guckian K.M. Krugh T.R. Kool E.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 954-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In a gel retardation assay (Fig. 2 D), wild-type Msh2-Msh6 binds less efficiently to substrates containing a F-G mismatch (lane 5) or an unpaired F base (lane 6) compared with equivalent substrates containing thymine (lanes 2 and 3, respectively). Reduced binding to an F-G containing substrate was also observed in the filter binding assay. These data are consistent with MutS structures, suggesting formation of a hydrogen bond between the mismatched base and Glu339 of Msh6. Binding of wild-type Msh2-Msh6 to the homoduplex containing F·A (Fig.2 D, lane 4) was also reduced compared with binding to the homoduplex containing T·A (Fig. 2 D,lane 1). However, this reduction was less substantial than observed for the mismatched substrates, resulting in a smaller differential in binding to homoduplex and heteroduplex DNA. This smaller differential is consistent with the loss of binding specificity resulting from the E339A substitution and may partly reflect the known helix destabilizing effects of the F and Z analogs (29Kool E.T. Biopolymers. 1998; 48: 3-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Finally, when we examined filter binding of the Msh2-Msh6E339A mutant heterodimer to the F-containing DNA substrates, less binding was observed in comparison with substitution of the side chain alone or use of the base analog alone (data not shown). This suggests that in addition to a hydrogen bond, the side chain of Glu339 may contribute other interactions that are important for DNA binding. Charge repulsion between the Glu339 carboxylate and the backbone may play an important role in kinking the DNA toward the major groove right at the mismatched base. Also, the side chain of the glutamate in MutS subunit A is positioned to interact with the π ring of the mismatched base in the minor groove. The DNA binding defects conferred by the E339A substitution or resulting from replacement of thymine with difluorotoluene are substantial in comparison with the mutator effect of the E339A mutant. Thus it may be that even a small amount of residual MMR activity is sufficient to correct the majority of frameshift replication errors at the run of 14 A-T base pairs. It is also possible that the binding capacity of Msh2-Msh6 in vitro does not accurately reflect interactions in vivo that may stabilize the repair complex, thus reducing the effect of certain amino acid substitutions on MMR efficiency. A third possibility is that amino acids may contribute to DNA binding or MMR activity to variable extents with different mismatched substrates. This hypothesis is consistent with the fact that the F337Y mutant heterodimer retained some binding specificity and shifted more of the T·G substrate than did the F337A mutant heterodimer (Fig. 2 B, compare lanes 5 and8). Modeling of the Phe to Tyr substitution3suggests that the problematic hydroxyl would be located in different positions in a MutS/T-G complex than in a MutS/+T complex. Also, while Glu41 in Taq MutS hydrogen bonds with an unpaired thymine that is protonated at N3 (1Obmolova G. Ban C. Hsieh P. Yang W. Nature. 2000; 407: 703-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar), the potentially relevant hydrogen-bonding atoms may not be protonated in the bases of other mispairs or insertion-deletion mismatches or not even available when thymine is in a different sequence context. Thus, amino acids contacting the DNA may contribute to MMR efficiency in a mismatch- or sequence context-specific manner. We have initiated studies to test these possibilities. Consistent with our results, a recent study (14Schofield M.J. Brownelee F.R. Nayak S. Du C. Kool E.T. Hsieh P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45505-45508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) indicates that the glutamate in MutS homologous to Msh6 Glu339 contributes to MMR and mismatched DNA binding specificity via a hydrogen bond and charge repulsion. A comparison of the two studies also reveals three differences that deserve further investigation. First, the E38A mutant of E. coli MutS has a mutator phenotype, suggesting complete loss of MMR of base substitutions, while the E339A mutation inMsh6 confers a weak mutator phenotype for single base deletions in a run of 14 A-T base pairs (Table I). As mentioned above, the importance of the glutamate side chain for MMR may depend on the type of mismatch and/or its location. Second, the bacterial MutS proteins bind with higher affinity to base analog-containing homoduplexes than they do to the equivalent natural homoduplex, while wild-type Msh2-Msh6 bound here to a natural homoduplex DNA slightly more efficiently than to the base analog-containing homoduplex (lanes 1 versus lane 4 in Fig.2 D). This may be due to the use of substrates in the two studies that differ in length, primary sequence, and nucleotides flanking the base analog-containing base pair. Third, the Glu to Ala substitutions in bacterial MutS have little effect on binding to some substrates, and they enhance binding to others (Table II in Ref. 14Schofield M.J. Brownelee F.R. Nayak S. Du C. Kool E.T. Hsieh P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45505-45508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In contrast, the E339A substitution strongly reduces DNA binding. This difference in the two studies is substantial. So too are DNA binding differences seen when comparing the E. coli andTaq MutS using identical substrates (14Schofield M.J. Brownelee F.R. Nayak S. Du C. Kool E.T. Hsieh P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45505-45508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Thus, removal of the glutamate side chain can indeed have different consequences forE. coli MutS, Taq MutS, and yeast Msh6. The results of this study suggest that Msh2-Msh6 interacts with mismatched substrates in an asymmetric manner similar to that observed with bacterial MutS homodimers. The data imply mismatched base-specific stacking with a phenylalanine, as suggested by earlier work (3Malkov V.A. Biswas I. Camerini-Otero D. Hsieh P. J. Biol.

The DNA binding asymmetry extends to DNA backbone contacts. These involve amino acids in Msh6 (Ref. 19Das Gupta R. Kolodner R.D. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 53-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar and Table I) that are not conserved in Msh2 and a lysine in Msh2 whose homolog in Msh6 is functionally less significant. Substitution of side chains inferred to interact within 2–3 base pairs on either side of the mismatch have a stronger effect on mutation rate than those interacting with DNA further from the mismatch. We propose that local interactions around the mismatch determine the kinked DNA conformation as observed in MutS-DNA complexes (1Obmolova G. Ban C. Hsieh P. Yang W. Nature. 2000; 407: 703-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar, 2Lamers M.H. Perrakis A. Enzlin J.H. Winterwerp H.H.K. de Wind N. Sixma T.K.

Here we analyzed the involvement of members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family and their downstream target, the transcription factor AP-1, in induction of apoptosis by NO in isolated adult cardiomyocytes of rat. The NO-donor (+/-)-S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (100 microM SNAP)-induced apoptosis in 10.5 +/- 0.7% of cardiomyocytes and activated the transcription activator protein AP-1 by 333.6 +/- 122.3%. Intracellular scavenging of AP-1 with decoy-oligonucleotides blocked NO-induced apoptosis to control levels (3.8 +/- 0.5% apoptotic cells). Activation of AP-1 with a c-Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK) activator (Ro318220, 10 microM) provoked apoptosis in 18.7 +/- 1.2% cardiomyocytes, which was again blocked by intracellular scavenging of AP-1. NO activated JNK by 87.0 +/- 27.3% and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) by 35 +/- 3%. Inhibition of ERK by the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK1) inhibitor PD98059 (10 microM) abolished AP-1 activation and apoptosis induction with SNAP. Evidence that p38 MAPK plays a role in NO-induced apoptosis was not found. These results clearly demonstrate the involvement of the transcription factor AP-1 in NO-induced apoptosis in cardiomyocytes. The activation of AP-1 is mediated by the two MAP kinases JNK and ERK."

This NLS comprises two sets of basic amino acids separated by 12 residues (Fig. 2 B), features characteristic of bipartite NLS motifs in diverse proteins (19Robbins J. Dilworth S.M. Laskey R.A.

An isolated N-terminal SRY peptide (residues 58–78) was shown to be sufficient to direct nuclear translocation of coupled rabbit IgG (protein SRY21 in Fig. 2 A). By contrast the remainder of the HMG box (residues 74–137) was unable to direct nuclear translocation of coupled rabbit IgG (protein SRY64 in Fig.2 A). Although these findings appear to exclude a second NLS in SRY, Südbeck and Scherer (21Sudbeck P. Scherer G. J. Biol.

Whereas the microinjection assay suggested that the N-terminal NLS is sufficient to direct complete nuclear localization, in the transient transfection assay both N- and C-terminal NLS motifs are required (21Sudbeck P.

The function of the NLSs of SRY has not been established in vivo as to date no clinical mutations have been shown to impair nuclear localization. In this communication we provide evidence for the physiological importance of the putative C-terminal NLS. Experimental design exploits a de novo sex-reversal mutation in the C-terminal basic cluster (R133W; Fig. 1 B and Ref. 22Veitia R. Ion A. Barbaux S. Jobling M.A. Souleyreau N. Ennis K. Ostrer H. Tosi M. Meo T. Chibani J. Fellous M. McElreavey K. Hum. Genet. 1997; 99: 648-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) to distinguish between DNA binding and nuclear localization. The site of mutation is disordered in the NMR structure of a specific SRY·DNA complex (Fig. 1 C and Ref. 10Werner M.H. Huth J.R. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 705-714Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Although the variant SRY domain exhibits essentially native DNA recognition, the mutation impairs nuclear translocation in a rat embryogenic gonadal ridge cell line. Control substitution R133A also impairs NLS function, suggesting that mislocalization is due to loss of the native side chain rather than specific interference by tryptophan. Correlation between impaired nuclear localization and phenotype (XY sex reversal) strongly suggests that the C-terminal basic cluster contributes to the nuclear localization of SRY in vivo and that such localization is required for testicular differentiation. To our knowledge, this is the first example of impaired organogenesis associated with mutation of an NLS. Native and variant SRY HMG box domains (84 amino acid; residues 57–140) were expressed in Escherichia coli as thrombin-cleavable fusion proteins and purified as described previously (23King C.Y. Weiss M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11990-11994Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The final SRY fragment (86 residues) contains two additional N-terminal residues (Gly-Ser) derived from the thrombin site. Purity was >98% as assessed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. Predicted molecular masses of SRY fragments were verified by mass spectrometry.

A. 1993; 90: 11990-11994Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) was prepared containing sequence 5′-GTGATTGTTCAG-3′ and complement (core target site in bold). The probe was labeled with 33P and annealed. Each reaction contained 6.25–50 nm protein (see caption to Fig.2 C) and <1 nm labeled DNA in 10 mmpotassium phosphate (pH 7.0), 50 ng/ml bovine serum albumin, 50 mm KCl, 4 mm dithiothreitol, and 2.5 mm MgCl2; the reaction was incubated for 1 h on ice. In control GMSA studies using a heterologous DNA target site (phage λ operator site O L1; 17 bp) the SRY HMG box did not form a shifted band. Gels were repeated in triplicate. For permutation gel electrophoresis (PGE), DNA probes of equal length (147 bp) with an SRY binding site (5′-GTGATTGTTCAG-3′ and complement) at varying distance from ends (distances of bend center from 5′-end are 120, 95, 79, 51, 47, and 27 bp) were generated by polymerase chain reaction from vector pBend2 as described previously (25Kim J. Zwieb C. Wu C. Adhya S. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 85: 15-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar) and 5′-labeled with [33P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase. 10-μl binding reactions contained 50 mm KCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 20 ng of poly(dI-dC), 400 ng of bovine serum albumin, 10% glycerol, ∼1 nm33P-labeled DNA probe, and 200 nm protein. After incubation on ice, samples were run on a 10% polyacrylamide gel (with 29:1 ratio bisacrylamide) in 0.5× (0.045m) Tris borate buffer containing EDTA (TBE) at ≈10 V/cm. Gels were repeated in triplicate. Induced DNA bend angles were calculated as described previously (26Ferrari S. Harley V.R. Pontiggia A. Goodfellow P.N. Lovell-Badge R. Bianchi M.E. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4497-4506Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). In multiple PGE studies of the wild-type protein inferred DNA bend angles 5Inferred DNA bend angles depend somewhat on gel composition (the present gel system yields an estimate of 79°, for example, whereas an 8% acrylamide gel with the same ratio of bisacrylamide yields an estimate of 72°; A. Jancso-Radek and M. A. Weiss, unpublished results). Such apparent effects are thought to reflect limitations of data analysis (26Ferrari S. Harley V.R. Pontiggia A. Goodfellow P.N. Lovell-Badge R.

Changes in bend angle (Δθ) induced by native and variant SRY domains are robust to changes in gel composition. were in general ±1°. Wild-type and variant proteins were run on the same gel. Confocal analysis was performed using a Zeiss LSM-410 laser scanning confocal microscope equipped with barrier filter for fluorescein (argon 488 nm as light source). An ×40 oil-immersion objective (numerical aperture, 1.3) was used for imaging of fluorescently labeled samples. Images were captured from the confocal optical section. Image analysis was performed using vendor software. COS-7 (American Type Culture Collection) and CH34 cell lines (kindly provided by Prof. P. K. Donahoe, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA) were cultured in 12-well plates at 60% confluency in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and 1× penicillin/streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37 °C under 5% CO2. Constructions SRY-WT and pSRY-D3 (Fig. 2 B) were kindly provided by Dr. Gerd Scherer (Institute of Human Genetics, University of Freiburg, Germany). SRY-R133W and SRY-R133A were obtained from SRY-WT by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChangeTM kit (Stratagene, Inc.). Transfections were performed using LipofectAMINETM2000 kit (Life Technologies, Inc). Following transfection, fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and 1× penicillin/streptomycin was added. Cells were evaluated after 48 h by 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactosidase (X-gal) staining or immunohistochemistry as follows. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 15 min and stained for 2 h with X-gal as described by the vendor (Invitrogen, Inc.). Cells were fixed with 3.5% formaldehyde in PBS on ice for 20 min, treated with successive ethanol solutions at −20 °C (70% ethanol for 7 min, 100% ethanol for 7 min, and 70% ethanol for 5 min), incubated for 45 min with anti-β-galactosidase antibody (at 1:100 dilution), and incubated for 45 min with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (at 1:500 dilution). Antisera were obtained from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). After two PBS washes, specimens were observed by LSM 410 confocal microscopy. Cells at 37 °C were treated with 1 mm 5-chloromethylfluorescein-di-β-galactopyranoside (CMFDG) in hypertonic loading medium at 37 °C for 10 min and incubated in hypotonic loading medium for 2 min and culture medium for 30 min. The Pearson correlation method was used to assess possible pairwise relationships. A p value of less than 0.05 (two-tailed) was used as a threshold for statistical significance. Analysis used data obtained from the two fixed-cell assays. Effects of the R133W mutation on structure, DNA binding, and DNA bending were evaluated in an SRY domain containing the HMG box and C-terminal tail (residues 56–140). CD spectra of native and variant domains are indistinguishable (data not shown). The mutation has no detectable effect on specific DNA binding as evaluated using the GMSA (Fig.2 C). Likewise, native and variant domains induce similar anomalies in permutation gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2 D). The dependence of electrophoretic mobility on flexure displacement corresponds to apparent DNA bend angles of 79° and 73°, respectively. Although these values are model-dependent (26Ferrari S. Harley V.R. Pontiggia A. Goodfellow P.N. Lovell-Badge R. Bianchi M.E. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4497-4506Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar), the data indicate that the variant domain retains sharp DNA bending activity. Its small difference in bend angle, although of biophysical interest (see “Discussion”), would not be associated with attenuation of transcriptional activation or repression by homologous HMG box factors (27Giese K. Kingsley C. Kirshner J.R. Grosschedl R. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 995-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar, 28Deckert J. Khalaf R.A. Hwang S.M. Zitomer R.S.

In accord with previous studies SRY directs nuclear localization of β-galactosidase enzymatic activity (Fig. 3, Aand B, column 1; Refs. 11Poulat F. Girard F. Chevron M.P. Goze C. Rebillard X.

Transient transfection experiments were performed using COS-7 cells to enable comparison with the results of Südbeck and Scherer (21Sudbeck P. Scherer G. J. Biol.

Cellular localization of β-galactosidase was quantitatively evaluated by two complementary methods: staining of fixed cells using X-gal (rows a and a′ in Fig. 3, A and B, respectively) and confocal immunofluorescence analysis of fixed cells (rows b and b′). To obtain meaningful statistics, ∼100 cells were counted by X-gal staining, and ∼20–50 fixed cells were visualized by confocal microscopy. Representative images are shown in Fig. 3. As a control for possible confounding factors related to cell fixation, live labeling and confocal immunofluorescence analysis of transfected cells were used to verify our interpretation of subcellular localization (rows c and c′). Control construction SRY-WT directs exclusive nuclear localization of β-galactosidase in ∼90% of COS-7 cells (114 of 127 cells counted) or CH34 cells (115 of 123 cells counted) (Fig. 3, column 1), whereas SRY-D3 yields a broad distribution of β-galactosidase in the nucleus and cytoplasm in >95% of COS-7 cells (108 of 111 cells counted) and ∼80% of CH34 cells (124 of 154 cells counted) (Fig. 3,column 4). Similar results were obtained by the immunohistochemical assay. Like the SRY-D3 negative control, R133W and R133A constructions (Fig. 3, columns 2 and 3, respectively) gave rise to pancellular distribution in more than 80% of cells analyzed by either assay. β-Galactosidase staining in COS-7 cells was pancellular in 83 of 101 cells counted (R133W) and 108 of 122 (R133A); corresponding values in CH34 cells were 57 of 69 (R133W) and 114 of 124 (R133A). Similarly, immunoreactive staining in COS-7 cells was pancellular in 39 of 42 cells counted (R133W) and 21 of 22 (R133A); corresponding values in CH34 cells were 19 of 21 (R133W) and 19 of 22 (R133A). Any differences in outcome between cell lines (Fig. 3,A versus B) or among methods of visualization (Fig. 3, rows a and band a′ and b′) are not of statistical significance. Impairment of nuclear localization due to mutations R133W or R133A is in each case similar to that due to deletion of the basic cluster. Their partial nuclear import presumably reflects continued activity of the N-terminal NLS. SRY was originally identified by genetic analysis of patients with intersex abnormalities (4Sinclair A.H. Berta P. Palmer M.S. Hawkins J.R. Griffiths B.L. Smith M.J. Foster J.W. Frischauf A.M. Lovell-Badge R. Goodfellow P.N. Nature. 1990; 346: 240-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (2577) Google Scholar). In the absence of a prioribiochemical information, the mechanism of action of SRY was hypothesized on the basis of homology between its HMG box and a conserved family of architectural transcription factors. This hypothesis has been corroborated in part by a striking correlation between sites of sex-reversal mutations (3Berta P. Hawkins J.R. Sinclair A.H. Taylor A. Griffiths B.L. Goodfellow P.N.

FBPase trafficking to the vacuole involves two distinct steps, import into intermediate transport vesicles (Vid vesicles) and Vid vesicle trafficking to the vacuole. FBPase import into Vid vesicles requires the VID22 gene. However, VID22 affects FBPase import indirectly through a cytosolic factor. To identify the required cytosolic component, wild type cytosol was fractionated and screened for proteins that complement Δvid22 mutant cytosol using an in vitro assay that reproduces FBPase import into Vid vesicles. Cyclophilin A (Cpr1p) was identified as a cytosolic protein that mediates Vid22p function in FBPase import. Mutants lacking Cpr1p were defective in FBPase import. Furthermore, the addition of purified Cpr1p restored FBPase import in both the Δcpr1 and the Δvid22 mutants. The cyclosporin A binding pocket is important for Cpr1p function, since cyclosporin A binding-deficient mutants failed to complement FBPase import in Δcpr1 and Δvid22 mutants. The levels of Cpr1p were reduced in the Δvid22 mutants, implying that the expression of Cpr1p is regulated by Vid22p. Our results suggest that Cpr1p mediates Vid22p function and is directly involved in the import of FBPase into Vid vesicles.

The most studied example of vacuolar trafficking involves the sorting of the vacuole luminal protein carboxypeptidase Y (CPY)1 from the late secretory pathway. CPY is synthesized and translocated into the endoplasmic reticulum. This protein is then transported to the Golgi, where it is sorted by the CPY receptor. Finally, CPY is targeted through the late endosome/prevacuolar compartment on its way to the vacuole. Due to the complexity of this process, the sorting of CPY to the vacuole requires more than 40 VPS genes (3Bryant N.J. Stevens T.H. Microbiol. Mol. Biol.

Cytosolic proteins and organelles can be targeted to the vacuole by the nonselective macroautophagy pathway when S. cerevisiae are starved of nitrogen. Macroautophagy overlaps with the Cvt (cytoplasm to vacuole targeting) pathway in targeting aminopeptidase I from the cytoplasm (5Scott V.S. Klionsky D.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 523-5296Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 6Klionsky D.J. Ohsumi Y. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 1-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 7Kim J.

Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1687-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). The Cvt and autophagy pathways also share components with the pexophagy pathway (14Kim J. Kamada Y. Stromhaug P.E. Guan J.

Cell. 1999; 10: 1353-1366Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Most genes involved in the autophagy or Cvt pathways have been cloned, and their functions have been elucidated. For example, a novel ubiquitin-like conjugating system is required for autophagy and Cvt targeting to the vacuole. Apg5p is conjugated to Apg12p in a process that is dependent on Apg7p (E1) and Apg10p (E2) (16Mizushima N. Noda T. Yoshimori T. Tanaka Y. Ishii T. George M.D. Klionsky D.J. Ohsumi M. Ohsumi Y. Nature. 1998; 395: 395-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (1249) Google Scholar), yet another modification system has been identified in which Apg8p is covalently conjugated to phosphatidylethanolamine. This modification affects the membrane distribution of Apg8p and is necessary for the regulation of membrane dynamics in autophagy (17Ichimura Y. Kirisako T. Takao T. Satomi Y. Shimonishi Y.

A distinct cytosol to vacuole targeting pathway has been studied in our laboratory. Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase) is a key regulatory enzyme in gluconeogenesis in S. cerevisiae. FBPase is induced when yeast cells are grown in medium containing poor carbon sources. However, when glucose-starved cells are shifted to fresh glucose, FBPase is rapidly inactivated and then degraded (18Chiang H.-L. Schekman R. Nature. 1991; 350: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 19Chiang H.-L. Schekman R. Hamamoto S. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 2000; 15: 2161-2167Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar), a PEP4-dependent degradation of FBPase has been shown by our laboratory and confirmed by an independent research group (23Jiang Y. Davis C. Broach J.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6942-6951Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Using immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy, we showed that FBPase is localized to the vacuole in thepep4 strain (18Chiang H.-L. Schekman R. Nature. 1991; 350: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 19Chiang H.-L. Schekman R. Hamamoto S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9934-9941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In addition, FBPase trafficking to the vacuole has been reconstituted using a semi-intact pep4 strain (20Shieh H.-L. Chiang H.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3381-3387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Prior to uptake by the vacuole, FBPase is first imported into a novel type of vesicle (24Hoffman M. Chiang H.-L. Genetics. 1996; 143: 1555-1566Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These Vid (vacuole import and degradation) vesicles can be purified to near homogeneity and are distinct from ER, Golgi, peroxisomes, mitochondria, COPI, or COPII vesicles (25Huang P.-H. Chiang H.-L. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 803-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Following the import of FBPase into Vid vesicles, these loaded Vid vesicles traffic to the vacuole. There, they fuse with the vacuole and deliver FBPase for degradation. Interestingly, we have identified a role for ubiquitination in the formation of Vid vesicles. The Δubc1 ubiquitin mutant exhibits a decrease in the amount of Vid vesicles and a concurrent defect in FBPase import and degradation (26Shieh H.-L. Chen Y. Brown C.R. Chiang H.-L. J. Biol.

The levels of Vid vesicles were also reduced when cells overexpressed the R48R63 ubiquitin mutant, a mutation that inhibits the formation of multiubiquitin chains (26Shieh H.-L. Chen Y. Brown C.R. Chiang H.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10398-10406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Therefore, it appears that ubiquitin chain formation and ubiquitin conjugation play important roles in the formation of Vid vesicles. In addition to Ubc1p, several molecules involved in the FBPase degradation pathway have been identified. For example, the import of FBPase into Vid vesicles is compromised in the absence of the heat shock protein Ssa2p (27Brown C.R. McCann J.A. Chiang H.-L. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 65-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), suggesting that protein folding or unfolding may be important for this process. Vid24p, on the other hand, plays an important role in FBPase trafficking from Vid vesicles to the vacuole (28Chiang M.-C. Chiang H.-L. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1347-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Another novel gene, VID22, was recently shown to be required for FBPase degradation. 2C. R. Brown, D.-Y. Cui, G. G.-C. Hung, and H.-L. Chiang, submitted for publication. 2C. R. Brown, D.-Y. Cui, G. G.-C. Hung, and H.-L. Chiang, submitted for publication. TheVID22 gene appears to play a role in FBPase targeting to Vid vesicles, since FBPase accumulates in the cytosol in the absence of this gene. However, when Vid22p was characterized, this protein was found to localize to the plasma membrane. Surprisingly, Vid22p exerts its effect on cytosolic components, as determined by an in vitro import assay. In this paper, we fractionated wild type cytosol in order to identify cytosolic factor(s) that can complement Δvid22 mutant cytosol and stimulate FBPase import. We identified cyclophilin A (Cpr1p or Cph1p) as a required factor that mediates the function of Vid22p. Cells lacking Cpr1p exhibited reduced FBPase import into Vid vesiclesin vivo and in vitro. However, the FBPase import defect was rescued when purified recombinant Cpr1p was added toin vitro reaction materials derived from either the Δcpr1 or Δvid22 mutants. Cyclosporin A (CsA) binding-deficient mutants failed to complement FBPase import in the Δcpr1 and Δvid22 mutants, indicating that the CsA binding pocket is required for Cpr1p function. Cpr1p levels were significantly reduced in the Δvid22 mutants, suggesting that Vid22p controls the expression of Cpr1p. We propose that Cpr1p mediates Vid22p function and plays a direct role in the import of FBPase into Vid vesicles. The yeast strains used in this study are listed in Table I.

(27Brown C.R. McCann J.A. Chiang H.-L. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 65-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The import of FBPase was defined as the fraction of the full-length 38-kDa FBPase that was protected in a membrane-sealed compartment. FBPase was purified using a previously described procedure (20Shieh H.-L. Chiang H.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3381-3387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Cytosol and Vid vesicle material was obtained using differential centrifugation techniques described previously (27Brown C.R. McCann J.A. Chiang H.-L. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 65-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The final 200,000 ×g supernatant (cytosol) and the final 200,000 ×g pellets (Vid vesicles) were utilized for the in vitro import assays. Wild type cells were grown for 2 days in YPKG (10 liters) and shifted to YPD for 20 min. Cells were harvested, resuspended in 500 ml of buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 5 mm MgSO4, 40 mm (NH4)2SO4, 0.1 mm EDTA) and homogenized with a bead beater at 4 °C. All subsequent fractionation steps were carried out at 4 °C. Lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 × g, and the supernatant was centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 2 h. The 200,000 × g supernatant was fractionated by ammonium sulfate precipitation at concentrations of 15, 30, and 45%. Samples were centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 20 min using a SS34 rotor, and the precipitates were resuspended in 20 ml of KP buffer (10 mmK2HPO4, pH 7.0, 50 mm NaCl, and 0.02% NaN3). Samples were then dialyzed against the same buffer for 16 h. Aliquots of each fraction (10 μl) were solubilized in SDS sample buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and stained with Coomassie Blue. Aliquots from each fraction (10 μl) were added to the Δvid22 in vitro reaction and tested for their ability to stimulate FBPase import. Preparative Superose 6 agarose (175 ml in 20% ethanol) was purchased from Sigma. A Superose 6 column was poured and equilibrated with KP buffer. The column was calibrated using thyroglobulin (669 kDa), apoferritin (443 kDa), β-amylase (200 kDa), alcohol dehydrogenase (150 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), and carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa) as markers. The 30% ammonium sulfate fraction (20 ml) was chosen for Superose 6 fractionation, since this fraction contained the highest complementing activity. A total of 100 fractions (3–4 ml/fraction) were collected from the Superose 6 column. The protein profile (10 μl) was examined by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. Small aliquots (10 μl) from each fraction were tested for their ability to stimulate FBPase import in the in vitro assay. Fractions 55–75 from the Superose 6 column (80 ml) were pooled and concentrated to 10 ml using a Centricon-10 filter concentrator (Amicon, Beverly, MA). A G75 column (Sigma) was poured and pre-equilibrated with KP buffer. The G75 column was calibrated using 67-kDa bovine serum albumin, 29-kDa carbonic anhydrase, 14-kDa RNase A, and 12.6-kDa cytochrome c as markers. Following the addition of concentrated protein samples, a total of 60 fractions (3–4 ml/fraction) were collected from the G75 column. Aliquots of the G75 fractions (10 μl) were examined by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining. Small aliquots (10 μl) from each of the G75 fractions were added to the in vitro reactions and tested for their ability to stimulate FBPase import. Fractions 39–45 (25 ml) from the G75 column were pooled and concentrated to 3 ml with a Centricon 10 concentrator. DEAE-agarose was pre-equilibrated with KP buffer, and 200 μl of this slurry was added to the concentrated samples for 2 h. The beads were pelleted by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 5 min. DEAE beads were washed with 1.5 ml of KP buffer three times, and bound proteins were eluted with 200 μl of 1 m NaCl. The total, flow-through, or eluate fractions (10 μl each) from the DEAE column were examined for protein content by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. These fractions (10 μl) were also tested for FBPase import activity using the in vitro assay. The CPR1 gene was amplified by PCRs using the 5′ primer GTCGACATGGGTTCCCAAGTCTATTTTGAT and the 3′ primer GTCGACTAATTCACCGGACTTGGCAAC and cloned into the pYES2.1 TOPO plasmid (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The CPR1 gene was excised from the plasmid by Sal I digestion and ligated into the Xho I site on a pGEX-KG plasmid (ATCC, Manassas, VA). An overnight culture of bacteria (20 ml) expressing GST-Cpr1p was diluted to an OD of 0.3 in 200 ml of LB containing ampicillin (50 μg/ml). Cultures were regrown for 3 h to an OD of 0.8, and the GST-Cpr1p fusion protein was induced by the addition of 0.2 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3.5 h. Cells were harvested and resuspended in 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline buffer containing 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cells were sonicated four times at the maximal speed for 30 s on ice. Lysates were solubilized with 2% Triton X-100 for 15 min and spun at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with 300 μl of GST beads (Amersham Biosciences) that had been pre-equilibrated in phosphate-buffered saline. Samples were centrifuged at 1,000 ×g for 5 min and washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and one time with thrombin buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, and 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol. Samples were centrifuged at 1,000 × g, and GST beads were resuspended in 2 ml of thrombin buffer containing 6 μg of thrombin. Samples were incubated for 40 min at 22 °C and then centrifuged. Total lysates and the final supernatants were collected and proteins were examined by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. Plasmids expressing His6-tagged versions of wild type Cpr1p, H90Y, and G102A mutant proteins were utilized. These proteins were expressed and purified from bacterial strains as described (29Cardenas M.E. Lim E. Heitman J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20997-21002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). A Vid22p-His6 fusion construct was cloned into pYES2.1 TOPO plasmids and transformed into theΔvid22 yeast strain. Yeast lysates (50 ml) containing recombinant proteins were solubilized in 500 μl of Ni2+binding buffer containing 2% Triton X-100 and purified using the protocol provided by Novagen. Collected fractions (total, unbound, and bound) were examined for protein content via SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. The Bio-Rad protein assay was used to determine protein concentrations. FBPase distribution in the high speed supernatant and high speed pellet fractions was determined as described (26Shieh H.-L. Chen Y. Brown C.R. Chiang H.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10398-10406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). FBPase activity was measured as described (18Chiang H.-L. Schekman R. Nature. 1991; 350: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The Δvid22 yeast strain displays a defect in the degradation of FBPase following a glucose shift. FBPase accumulates in the cytosol of the Δvid22 strain, suggesting that FBPase targeting to Vid vesicles requires theVID22 gene.2 Since Vid22p is a plasma membrane protein, it is not known how it regulates FBPase import into Vid vesicles. To address this question, we performed experiments utilizing our in vitro assay that recapitulates the import of FBPase into Vid vesicles (27Brown C.R. McCann J.A. Chiang H.-L. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 65-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In this assay, cytosol and Vid vesicle fractions are isolated from strains that have been shifted to glucose for 20 min. The endogenous FBP1 gene was deleted from these strains so that a known quantity of purified FBPase could be added to the in vitro reaction mixtures, which also contained ATP and an ATP regenerating system. Following proteinase K treatment, FBPase import was defined as the fraction of FBPase that was sequestered inside membrane-sealed vesicles. This assay requires both competent Vid vesicles and cytosol to import FBPase. Cytosol alone or Vid vesicles alone cannot stimulate FBPase import in the absence of the other component. Likewise, the combinations of competent cytosol with defective vesicles or competent vesicles with defective cytosol will not import FBPase into Vid vesicles (27Brown C.R. McCann J.A. Chiang H.-L. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 65-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). As is shown in Fig. 1 A, the combination of wild type cytosol and Vid vesicles resulted in the import of FBPase into Vid vesicles (lane 1). In contrast, the combination of Δvid22 cytosol and Vid vesicles was not competent for FBPase import (lane 2). To identify the defective component in theΔvid22 strain, we utilized various combinations of cytosol and Vid vesicles isolated from the wild type and Δvid22 strains. The combination of wild type cytosol and Δvid22 Vid vesicles was competent for FBPase import (lane 3). Therefore, it appears that Vid vesicles from theΔvid22 strain are functional. In contrast, the combination of Δvid22 cytosol and wild type Vid vesicles did not simulate FBPase import (lane 4). This suggests that the Δvid22 strain has defective cytosol that cannot drive the import of FBPase into Vid vesicles. Since Vid22p is a plasma membrane protein, it may exert its effect on FBPase import in an indirect manner. To test this, the VID22 gene was fused with a His6-coding DNA under a GAL1-inducible promoter and transformed into the Δvid22 strain. The fusion protein retained its function, since the transformed cells exhibited a wild type FBPase degradation phenotype when the expression was induced. In contrast, in the absence of induction, the cells did not degrade FBPase (not shown). To determine whether purified Vid22p is capable of stimulating FBPase import, His6-tagged Vid22p was purified on a nickel column under native conditions, using detergent-solubilized lysates from transformed yeast strains. As is shown in Fig. 1 B, most of the Vid22p was in the eluate fraction (lane 2), and a minimal amount was in the flow-through fraction (lane 3). As expected, most of the control protein Pma1p was in the flow-through (lane 3), but very little was found in the eluate fraction (lane 2). The total, eluate, and flow-through fractions were added to the in vitro reaction mixtures consisting of cytosol and Vid vesicles derived from theΔvid22 mutant. When FBPase import was examined, the stimulatory activity was in the flow-through fraction, although this fraction contained very low levels of Vid22p (Fig. 1 B). In contrast, the high levels of Vid22p in the eluate fraction did not stimulate FBPase import. Therefore, Vid22p appears to regulate FBPase import indirectly. The defect in the Δvid22 cytosolic fraction most likely represents the lack of necessary constituents in this strain. To test this idea, we again performed the in vitro assay utilizing the Δvid22 cytosol and Vid vesicles. In these experiments, however, wild type cytosol was also included in the reaction mixture. As is shown in Fig. 1 C, the addition of wild type cytosol to Δvid22 cytosol resulted in the import of FBPase (lane 3). Thus, this suggests that there is a cytosolic component present in wild type cytosol that can complement Δvid22 cytosol. Along these lines, we have identified Ssa2p as an essential cytosolic protein that is required for the import of FBPase into Vid vesicles (27Brown C.R. McCann J.A. Chiang H.-L. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 65-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). To determine whether Ssa2p is the missing cytosolic protein in the Δvid22 mutants, we combined cytosol obtained from a Δssa2 mutant strain withΔvid22 mutant cytosol in the in vitro reaction. If Ssa2p is the missing cytosolic component in Δvid22 cells, then the addition of cytosol from the Δssa2 strain should not stimulate import. However, a high level of FBPase import was observed under these experimental conditions, suggesting that theΔssa2 mutant strain contains essential cytosolic proteins that complement Δvid22 mutant cytosol (lane 4). Thus, this result suggests that Ssa2p is not the missing cytosolic factor in the Δvid22 mutant. Since wild type cytosol contains the essential component that is absent from theΔvid22 strain, we began a series of fractionation steps in order to isolate and identify this component (Fig.2). Wild type cells were shifted to glucose for 20 min and harvested. Cell lysates were subjected to differential centrifugation, and the final 200,000 × g supernatant (cytosol) was fractionated via precipitation with increasing concentrations of ammonium sulfate. Precipitants were dialyzed, and small aliquots were then tested in our in vitro assay utilizing Δvid22 components. The 30% ammonium sulfate cytosol was the most effective in restoring FBPase import, whereas the 15 or 45% precipitates had little stimulatory effect (Fig. 2 A). The 30% ammonium sulfate precipitant was subjected to further fractionation using Superose 6 sizing chromatography (Fig.2 B). Fractions were collected from the Superose 6 column and tested in the in vitro assay to identify those that could complement FBPase import in the Δvid22 strain. In order to estimate the size of the stimulatory proteins, the Superose 6 column was calibrated with molecular weight markers ranging from 29 to 660 kDa. The complementing activity was found in the last few fractions that eluted after the 29-kDa marker, suggesting that the stimulatory proteins were smaller than 29 kDa. To further purify the complementing activity, the stimulatory fractions from the Superose 6 column were pooled, concentrated by Centricon 10 filtration, and subjected to further fractionation on a G75 sizing column (Fig. 2 C). Fractions collected from the G75 column were tested for their ability to stimulate import in the Δvid22 mutants. The highest activity was found in fractions 39–45. These stimulatory fractions were pooled, concentrated, and subjected to DEAE ionic exchange chromatography (Fig. 2 D). The total, flow-through, and DEAE-bound fractions were examined by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. Aliquots of these fractions were also tested for their effects on FBPase import using the in vitro assay. The DEAE eluate fraction was the most effective in complementing FBPase import in the Δvid22 mutants. In contrast, the flow-through fraction had little stimulatory effect on FBPase import. When the eluate fraction was examined by Coomassie Blue staining, the most prominent band was ∼17 kDa. To identify this protein, the band was excised from the gel and subjected to in-gel trypsin digestion followed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization analysis. The protein was subsequently identified as cyclophilin A (Cpr1p or Cph1p), a protein that exhibits peptidyl prolyl cis-trans isomerase activity (29Cardenas M.E. Lim E. Heitman J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20997-21002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Cpr1p is a member of the immunophilin family and is the major cyclosporin A receptor protein (29C"

Karran P. Wood R.D. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 158-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Damage to DNA bases can be caused by methylating and oxidizing agents as well as by other genotoxicants. Bases can also be modified by deamination. During repair, a DNA glycosylase removes the altered base, generating an abasic site. Additionally, abasic sites can arise as a result of spontaneous hydrolysis of the N-glycosylic bond (2Lindahl T. Nature. 1993; 362: 709-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (4325) Google Scholar). Apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) sites are non-coding lesions that can lead to misincorporation during replication and transcription. Therefore, these damaged sites need to be repaired promptly. Repair is initiated by an apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease (APE) that cleaves 5′ to the abasic site (3Lindahl T. Wood R.D.

During short patch repair, DNA polymerase β (pol β) removes the 5′-sugar phosphate residue by catalyzing a β-elimination reaction (10Matsumoto Y. Kim K.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3341-3348Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar), oxidation of the deoxyribose renders the abasic site resistant to β-elimination, necessitating removal via the long patch repair pathway. Significantly, many of the proteins involved in long patch BER are also involved in chromosomal DNA replication. These include DNA polymerase δ (pol δ), flap endonuclease 1 (FEN1), DNA ligase I, and replication protein A (RPA) (11Matsumoto Y. Kim K. Hurwitz J. Gary R. Levin D.S. Tomkinson A.E. Park M.S. J.

Biol. 1998; 18: 4177-4187Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). p21 is a potent and universal inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases (18Xiong Y. Hannon G.J. Zhang H. Casso D. Kobayashi R. Beach D. Nature. 1993; 366: 701-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (3172) Google Scholar). The p21 protein was initially identified as a component of a quaternary complex that includes PCNA, cyclin D, and a cyclin-dependent kinase (19Zhang H. Xiong Y. Beach D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 897-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). After DNA damage is incurred, p53 is induced and p53 up-regulates p21 (18Xiong Y. Hannon G.J. Zhang H. Casso D. Kobayashi R. Beach D. Nature. 1993; 366: 701-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (3172) Google Scholar). In vivo and in vitro studies have shown that p21 inhibits PCNA-dependent DNA replication (20Flores-Rozas H. Kelman Z.

Inhibition of PCNA by a p21-derived PCNA-binding peptide also results in inhibition of DNA synthesis in vivo and in vitro (24Chen J. Peters R. Saha P. Lee P. Theodoras A. Pagano M. Wagner G. Dutta A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1727-1733Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 25Warbrick E. Lane D.P. Glover D.M. Cox L.S. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 275-282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Because PCNA is common to both DNA replication and long patch BER, this protein might play regulatory roles in several essential biological processes, including cell cycle progression, DNA replication, and DNA repair. During mammalian BER, AP sites are the central intermediate, and these sites must be processed by APE1. This pivotal enzyme recognizes and cleaves the DNA phosphodiester backbone 5′ to the AP site to generate a free 3′-OH end for polymerase repair synthesis (26Wilson 3rd, D.M. Takeshita M. Grollman A.P. Demple B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16002-16007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). In recent years, new evidence has suggested that APE1 also coordinates the DNA repair steps (27Bennett R.A. Wilson 3rd, D.M. Wong D. Demple B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7166-7169Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). There is an orderly transfer of the DNA damage site from DNA glycosylases to APE1 and from APE1 to pol β that is mediated by APE1. The extensive APE1 interaction surface allows APE1 to displace a bound glycosylase from the AP site. Subsequently, the interaction of the APE1·DNA complex with pol β then recruits the DNA repair synthesis enzymes to areas of damaged DNA (27Bennett R.A. Wilson 3rd, D.M. Wong D. Demple B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7166-7169Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 28Mol C.D. Izumi T. Mitra S. Tainer J.A. Nature. 2000; 403: 451-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). APE1 is involved in the repair of oxidative damage in vivo(29Ramana C.V. Boldogh I. Izumi T. Mitra S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5061-5066Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). In addition, the p21 regulatory protein is up-regulated during oxidative stress (30Rancourt R.C. Keng P.C. Helt C.E. O'Reilly M.A. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell. Mol. Physiol. 2001; 280: L617-L626Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consequently, both of these proteins have proposed regulatory roles during long patch BER. In this report, we initiate an investigation of the consequences of the interactions between p21 and the enzymes responsible for BER. We also examine whether APE1 can coordinate DNA repair in the absence of PCNA interactions with the BER proteins. Oligonucleotides were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). The p21 peptide (139GRKRRQTSMTDFYHSKRRLIFS160, p21 sequence numbering) was synthesized by Sigma-Genosys (The Woodlands, TX). Radionucleotides [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol), [α-32P]dATP (3000 Ci/mmol), and [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol) were obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. T4 polynucleotide kinase was from Roche Diagnostics, and Sequenase (version 2.0) was from Amersham Biosciences, Inc. Uracil DNA glycosylase was obtained from United States Biochemical Corp. Micro Bio-Spin 30 chromatography columns were from Bio-Rad, and Micropure EZ minicolumns were from Millipore, Inc. All other reagents were of the best available commercial grade. Human pol β was obtained from Chimerx. Calf thymus pol δ (1 unit is defined as incorporation of 1 nmol of dTMP into poly(dA)-oligo(dT) (20:1 base ratio) in the presence of 100 ng of PCNA in 60 min at 37 °C) was purified from calf thymus tissue as described previously (31Weiser T.

Recombinant human APE1 was expressed in Escherichia coliBL21(DE3) from the His-tagged APE1 expression plasmid that was generated by cloning the human APE1 cDNA into a Novagen pET-28b expression plasmid. BL21(DE3) pET28b-APE1 was grown at 37 °C with shaking (200 rpm) to mid-log phase (A600 = 0.5). Expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at a final concentration of 400 μm, and the culture was incubated for an additional 3 h at 37 °C with shaking. The bacteria were then harvested by centrifugation, and the cell pellet was resuspended with cold phosphate-buffered saline and stored at −80 °C until purification. Human APE1 was purified by a two-chromatography step procedure. The bacterial pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 500 mm KCl, 1 mm imidazole, 0.1 mm DTT, 0.1 mmEDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin A). After lysing the cells by passing them twice through a French press, the lysate was clarified by centrifugation for 30 min at 30,000 ×g. The supernatant was loaded onto a 10-ml precharged Qiagen nickel resin fast-protein liquid chromatography column at 1 ml/min. The column was washed with 10 column volumes of nickel resin buffer (50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 500 mm KCl, 1 mm imidazole, 0.1 mm DTT, 0.1 mmEDTA, and 10% glycerol), and the protein was eluted with a 20–100 mm imidazole gradient. Peak fractions were pooled and dialyzed into Mono-S buffer (50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 0.1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol). The sample was then loaded onto a 1-ml Mono-S column (obtained from Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) at 0.1 ml/min. The column was washed with 10 column volumes of Mono-S buffer, and the protein was eluted with a 100–250 mm KCl gradient. Purified protein was dialyzed into storage buffer (50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 0.1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol) and stored at −80 °C. Oligomer sequences are listed in Table I, and the primer-template substrates were constructed as described in the figure legends. In all substrates, the 3′-end regions of the downstream primers share homology with the 5′-ends of their respective templates. For the flap substrate, the downstream primer creates a substrate with an unannealed 5′-flap. The respective upstream primer was annealed to create a complementary one-nucleotide 3′-tail. For the nick substrate, the respective upstream primer was annealed to the proper template to create a nick between the 3′-end of the upstream primer and the 5′-end of the downstream primer. Prior to annealing, the 5′-radiolabeled primers were generated utilizing [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase according to the manufacturer's instructions. Downstream primer D1 was annealed to T1 and radiolabeled at the 3′-end using [α-32P]dCTP and Sequenase (version 2.0). Unincorporated radionucleotides were removed with Micro Bio-Spin 30 chromatography columns. All radiolabeled primers were purified by gel isolation from a 15% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea denaturing gel prior to annealing.Table IOligonucleotide sequences (5′→3′)Downstream primers D1(24-mer)CCAAGGCCACCCGTCCACCCGACG D2 (29-mer)CTCACAATTCCACACAACATACGAGCCGG D3 (30-mer)GCTCACAATTCCACACAACATACGAGCCGGUpstream primers U1(26-mer)CGACCGTGCCAGCCTAAATTTCAATC U2(30-mer)ATAGCTGTTTCCTGTGTGAAATTGTTATCCTemplates1-aThe underlinednucleotide is a deoxyuridine.

Open table in a new tab Substrates were annealed by mixing 2 pmol of the respective downstream primer with 5 pmol of the corresponding template in annealing buffer (10 mm Tris base, 50 mm KCl, and 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) to a final volume of 30 μl. The mixtures were heated to 95 °C for 5 min and allowed to cool to room temperature. A corresponding upstream primer (10 pmol) was subsequently added and annealed by incubating at 37 °C for 1 h. The polymerization substrate was generated by annealing the upstream primer (U2), the corresponding template (T2), and the downstream primer (D2) at a molar ratio of 1:2.5:5, respectively. A mixture of the upstream primer and the template was heated to 95 °C for 5 min and subsequently cooled to room temperature. The downstream primer was annealed by incubating at 37 °C for 1 h. The BER substrate was generated by annealing a 73-mer oligonucleotide (T3) with an internal deoxyuridine to the corresponding template (T4) in the same manner as described previously. This substrate contains two residues that overhang at both 3′-ends to prevent degradation of the substrate by exonucleases and to distinguish BER products from DNA synthesis run-off products during analysis. The uracil base was removed using uracil DNA glycosylase at 37 °C for 90 min. The substrate (2 pmol) was then incubated at 37 °C with 4 pmol of human APE1 for 15 min to specifically cleave on the 5′ side of the internal deoxyribose 5-phosphate moiety. After the incubation period, human APE1 was removed by sedimenting the substrate through a Micropure EZ column to give the starting substrate for the BER assays. Fig.1 illustrates the representative substrates. The reactions containing the indicated amounts of substrate and enzymes were performed in reaction buffer (30 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 40 mm KCl, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 8 mmMgCl2, and 0.1 mm ATP). The reactions were incubated at 37 °C, terminated with 20 μl of formamide dye (90% formamide (v/v) with bromphenol blue and xylene cyanole), and heated to 95 °C for 5 min. After separation on a 15% polyacrylamide, 7m urea denaturing gel, products were detected by PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) analysis. For the reconstituted base excision repair assays, each reaction contained 50 fmol of DNA substrate, 0.825 pmol of [α-32P]dATP, 0.125 nmol of each dNTP, and various combinations of enzymes in reaction buffer. The applicable proteins were added simultaneously to the reaction mix. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min and terminated by adding an equal volume of formamide dye. Reaction products were resolved on a 15% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea denaturing gel and detected by PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) analysis. All assays were performed at least in triplicate. Other groups have shown that the C-terminal region of the p21 regulatory protein is responsible for binding to PCNA (24Chen J. Peters R. Saha P. Lee P. Theodoras A. Pagano M. Wagner G. Dutta A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1727-1733Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 25Warbrick E. Lane D.P. Glover D.M. Cox L.S. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 275-282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). For our studies, we have designed a synthetic peptide resembling this region of p21. The regions of FEN1 and DNA ligase I that interact with PCNA have been identified, and these regions share homology with the PCNA-binding motif of p21 (16Jonsson Z.O. Hindges R. Hubscher U. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2412-2425Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Because several other DNA replication proteins also contain a similar PCNA-binding motif, most PCNA-binding proteins appear to bind the same or at least overlapping regions of PCNA (15Tom S. Henricksen L.A. Park M.S. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24817-24825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 16Jonsson Z.O. Hindges R. Hubscher U. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2412-2425Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Consistent with this notion, p21, or a PCNA-binding peptide of p21, inhibits the binding of FEN1 (36Chen U. Chen S. Saha P. Dutta A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11597-11602Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), DNA ligase I (37Levin D.S. Bai W. Yao N. O'Donnell M. Tomkinson A.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12863-12868Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), pol δ (23Podust V.N. Podust L.M. Goubin F. Ducommun B. Hubscher U. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8869-8875Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 38Zhang P. Sun Y. Hsu H. Zhang L. Zhang Y. Lee M.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 713-719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and several other proteins to PCNA. Considering there are three binding sites on each assembled PCNA, it can bind more than one FEN1 or p21. However, complexes of all three molecules are not observed, demonstrating that FEN1 and p21 binding is exclusive (36Chen U. Chen S. Saha P. Dutta A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11597-11602Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Because perturbing the binding of FEN1 or DNA ligase I to PCNA should result in the loss of the PCNA stimulatory effect, exclusive binding implies that p21 is designed to regulate the stimulation process. Fig. 2A shows an examination of the effects of the p21 peptide on PCNA-directed stimulation of FEN1 cleavage activity. Lanes 5–9 illustrate that the p21 peptide does not alter FEN1 activity in the absence of PCNA. The addition of PCNA to the reaction leads to an approximate 26-fold stimulation of cleavage product formation (lane 10); however, titration of the p21 peptide leads to a notable reduction in the amount of observable stimulation (lanes 11–15). This reduction is presumably a result of the destabilization of PCNA complexes with FEN1. Therefore, the addition of p21 does lead to an overall reduction in nuclease activity. Likewise, the p21 peptide attenuates PCNA stimulation of DNA ligase I activity (Fig. 2B). The presence of PCNA leads to an approximate 5-fold enhancement of ligation activity (lane 10), but titration of the p21 peptide into the reactions results in a marked decrease of ligated product (lanes 11–15). Therefore, the p21 peptide can reduce PCNA stimulation of both FEN1 and DNA ligase I by disrupting the physical interactions required to effect stimulation. However, both FEN1 and DNA ligase I will retain a basal level of activity that is not altered by the p21 peptide. We considered the possibility that the activity of APE1 is stimulated or regulated by PCNA. Because PCNA is apparently involved in coordinating the actions of proteins during long patch BER (12Gary R. Kim K. Cornelius H.L. Park M.S. Matsumoto Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4354-4363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), we anticipated that PCNA might target APE1 to abasic sites. To analyze this possibility, PCNA was added to reactions with APE1 to determine whether any change in activity would be observed. In Fig.2C, PCNA was added to a reaction with APE1 (lane 10). There is no noticeable change in product formation. Therefore, PCNA does not appear to interact with APE1 in the manner in which it interacts with FEN1 and DNA ligase I. In addition, titration of the p21 peptide into reactions without PCNA (lanes 5–9) and with PCNA (lanes 11–15) does not lead to any inhibition of APE1 activity. During both DNA replication and long patch BER, flap intermediates generated by strand displacement synthesis by a polymerase need to be processed to yield intact double-stranded DNA. Fig.3 depicts an experiment whereby a flap substrate was analyzed, and the processing of this substrate by FEN1, DNA ligase I, and PCNA was monitored. The substrate was radiolabeled at the 3′-end of the downstream primer so that intermediates generated during the processing reactions could be observed. Additionally, the upstream primer contains a complementary one-nucleotide 3′-tail (as illustrated in Fig. 1A). Biochemical evidence suggests that the physiologically relevant substrate for FEN1 consists of a one-nucleotide 3′-tail upstream of the nick. In this way, cleavage of the 5′-flap one nucleotide into the annealed region leads to the generation of a ligatable substrate. The 18-nt product represents FEN1 cleavage of the 5′-flap one nucleotide into the annealed region. The 44-nt product is a result of ligation by DNA ligase I of the upstream primer to the resultant 18-nt downstream primer produced by FEN1.Lane 6 illustrates the amount of ligated product generated by FEN1 and DNA ligase I in the absence of PCNA. The addition of PCNA results in the enhancement of ligation product formation (lane 12). Although the p21 peptide does not alter the amount of ligated product in the absence of PCNA (lanes 7–11), addition of the peptide to reactions with PCNA leads to a reduction in ligation activity (lanes 13–17). These results are in agreement with the observations noted above for Fig. 2. Therefore, the p21 peptide should affect the processing of flap intermediates during both DNA replication and long patch BER. pol β plays an integral role in both the removal of the 5′-sugar phosphate residue by catalyzing a β-elimination reaction as well as the polymerization steps during short patch BER (10Matsumoto Y. Kim K. Science. 1995; 269: 699-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar, 39Podlutsky A.J. Dianova I.I. Wilson S.H. Bohr V.A. Dianov G.L.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1477-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) have proposed that pol β is responsible for initiating synthesis during long patch BER. Because pol β is presumably involved in the long patch repair of AP sites (40Podlutsky A.J. Dianova I.I. Podust V.N. Bohr V.A. Dianov G.L.

The polymerization substrate contains a one-nucleotide gap (as illustrated in Fig. 1C), and this substrate is representative of an intermediate in long patch BER. The addition of PCNA does not result in increased extension of the upstream primer, which on this substrate requires displacement of the downstream primer (lane 10). Also, titration of the p21 peptide into reactions devoid of PCNA and into reactions containing PCNA did not lead to any change in polymerase activity. Therefore, pol β does not appear to be affected by either PCNA or the p21 peptide. Consequently, pol β can still effectively perform its role in repair during the induction of p21 upon DNA damage. pol δ requires PCNA for processive synthesis (43Bambara R.A. Jessee C.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1088: 11-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In Fig. 4, pol δ alone does not yield high levels of synthesis (lane 16). Because pol δ catalyzes inefficient and distributive synthesis in the absence of PCNA, the small amount of full-length product observed might be the result of synthesis by a small quantity of a contaminating polymerase. As expected, the addition of PCNA greatly increases the amount of full-length product (lane 22), which is likely formed by the highly processive complex of PCNA and pol δ. Titration of the p21 peptide into reactions with pol δ alone does not significantly affect strand displacement synthesis activity (lanes 17–21). Polymerization is altered by the p21 peptide in the reactions with PCNA (lanes 23–27). Increasing the amount of the p21 peptide results in a marked decrease in the generation of full-length product. Because pol δ is involved in both DNA re"
https://openalex.org/W1834276093,"Natural antibodies provide an early defense mechanism against pathogens, show a frequent self-reactivity, and are present throughout life. Two questions concern the physiological control of self-reactivity and the pathogenetic link to autoimmune disease. Here we propose a concept of conditional autoimmunity involving natural antibodies against the alpha chain of the high-affinity receptor for IgE (Fc(epsilon)RIalpha ). Like other natural antibodies, anti-Fc(epsilon)RIalpha antibodies are found in sera of healthy donors. We now report the first human recombinant anti-Fc(epsilon)RIalpha autoantibodies isolated by repertoire cloning from a human tonsillar IgM library. These high-affinity antibodies recognize Fc(epsilon)RIalpha on cells and trigger histamine release from freshly isolated blood basophils. However, the latter effect requires IgE removal from the Fc(epsilon)RI. The same conditional histamine release is seen when using sera from individual normal donors and affinity-purified anti-Fc(epsilon)RIalpha antibodies isolated from multidonor therapeutic IgG preparations. We propose that such anti-Fc(epsilon)RIalpha antibodies can become pathogenic and that this is dependent on the state of occupancy of the Fc(epsilon)RIalpha by its natural ligand IgE. We suggest that an imbalance between Fc(epsilon)RIalpha occupancy and natural anti-Fc(epsilon)RIalpha antibodies may be implicated in the pathogenesis of autoimmune urticaria."

It was recently shown that SipA, a protein secreted by S. typhimurium, is necessary and sufficient to drive PMN transmigration across model intestinal epithelia (Lee, C. A., Silva, M., Siber, A. M., Kelly, A. J., Galyov, E., and McCormick, B. A. (2000) Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. USA 97, 12283–12288). However, the epithelial factors responsible for this process have not been identified. Here, for the first time, we demonstrate that S. typhimurium-induced PMN transmigration across Madin-Darby canine kidney-polarized monolayers is regulated by the GTPase ARF6. Apically added S. typhimurium promoted the translocation of ARF6 and its exchange factor ARNO to the apical surface. Overexpression of a dominant-negative mutant of ARF6 inhibitedSalmonella-induced PMN transmigration, which was due to a reduction in apical release of the PMN chemoattractant PEEC (pathogen-elicited epithelial chemoattractant), without affecting bacterial internalization. Furthermore, ARF6 and its effector phospholipase D (PLD) were both required for bacteria-induced translocation of protein kinase C (PKC) to membranes. These results describe a novel signal transduction pathway, in whichSalmonella initiates an ARF6- and PLD-dependent lipid signaling cascade that, in turn, directs activation of PKC, release of PEEC, and subsequent transepithelial PMN movement.

Salmonella contacting the luminal surface of the intestinal epithelium activate a bacterial type III protein secretion apparatus, encoded on a 40-kb segment of the bacterial chromosome termed Salmonella pathogenicity island-1 (SPI-1)1 (1Darwin K.H. Miller V.L. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1999; 12: 405-428Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Hueck C.J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 379-433Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SPI-1-secreted virulence factors (e.g. SopE/E2, SptP, SopB/SigD, and others) are subsequently translocated into the enterocyte, where they modulate host protein activity and lipid production, resulting in apical membrane ruffling and concomitant bacterial internalization (1Darwin K.H. Miller V.L. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1999; 12: 405-428Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). S. typhimurium evokes a potent inflammatory response in the host, the hallmark of which is the migration of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) across the intestinal epithelium to the luminal surface (3McCormick B.A. Miller S.I. Carnes D. Madara J.L. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 2302-2309Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This process can be separated into three distinct phases: (a) extravasation of circulating PMN from the microvasculature; (b) passage of PMN across the lamina propria to a subepithelial space; (c) paracellular movement of PMN across the epithelial monolayer. PMN recruitment is coordinated by the epithelial release of an array of proinflammatory cytokines, among which are two potent PMN chemoattractants. Interleukin-8 (IL-8), which is secreted primarily at the basolateral surface, establishes a gradient across the lamina propria that guides PMN to the basal aspect of enterocytes (4McCormick B.A. Hofman P.M. Kim J. Carnes D.K. Miller S.I. Madara J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1599-1608Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 5McCormick B.A. Colgan S.P. Delp-Archer C. Miller S.I. Madara J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 895-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Subsequent PMN transit through the epithelial monolayer to the luminal surface (“PMN transmigration”) is directed by an apically released chemokine termed pathogen-elicited epithelial chemoattractant (PEEC) (6McCormick B.A. Parkos C.A. Colgan S.P. Carnes D.K. Madara J.L. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 455-466PubMed Google Scholar). Modeling of this final, rate-limiting step of PMN movement in vitro demonstrated that PMN transmigration could occur independently of bacterial internalization, although both were dependent on the SPI-1 secretion apparatus (7Gewirtz A.T. Siber A.M. Madara J.L. McCormick B.A. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 608-617Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with this observation, the S. typhimurium SPI-1-secreted product SipA was recently found to be both necessary and sufficient for induction of PMN transmigration across model intestinal epithelia but not for bacterial entry, in a protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent manner (8Lee C.A. Silva M. Siber A.M. Kelly A.J. Galyov E. McCormick B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12283-12288Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). PMN transmigration only occurs following apical, but not basolateral application of S. typhimurium (7Gewirtz A.T. Siber A.M. Madara J.L. McCormick B.A. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 608-617Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), implying that host factors functioning at the apical domain of epithelial cells modulate this event. One regulatory protein that satisfies this requirement is ARF6, a member of the ARF subgroup of GTPases of the Ras superfamily. ARF proteins were first defined as cofactors necessary for the cholera toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of the αssubunit of heterotrimeric G proteins (9Welsh C.F. Moss J. Vaughan M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 138: 157-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Class I (ARF 1–3) and class II (ARF 4–5) ARF proteins localize to the Golgi apparatus as well as endosomes, where they regulate vesicle budding by inducing the assembly of coat proteins such as coatomer protein I and clathrin onto the membrane surface (10Chavrier P. Goud B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 466-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). ARF6, the only class III ARF, is novel in its localization to the plasma membrane and endosomal structures in non-polarized cells (11D'Souza-Schorey C. Li G. Colombo M.I. Stahl P.D. Science. 1995; 267: 1175-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 12Peters P.J. Hsu V.W. Ooi C.E. Finazzi D. Teal S.B. Oorschot V. Donaldson J.G. Klausner R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 1003-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Interestingly, ARF6 is highly expressed in polarized epithelial cells, where it localizes primarily to the apical brush border and apical early endosomes (13Altschuler Y. Liu S. Katz L. Tang K. Hardy S. Brodsky F. Apodaca G. Mostov K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 7-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 14Londono I. Marshansky V. Bourgoin S. Vinay P. Bendayan M. Kidney Int. 1999; 55: 1407-1416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). ARF6 has been implicated in endocytosis and membrane recycling of a subset of membrane proteins, as well as in remodeling of the cortical actin cytoskeleton (11D'Souza-Schorey C. Li G. Colombo M.I. Stahl P.D. Science. 1995; 267: 1175-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 15Frank S.R. Hatfield J.C. Casanova J.E. Mol. Biol.

In addition, ARF6 appears to be a key signal transducer downstream of G protein-coupled receptors and receptor tyrosine kinases (19Venkateswarlu K. Cullen P.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 719-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 20Langille S.E. Patki V. Klarlund J.K. Buxton J.M. Holik J.J. Chawla A. Corvera S. Czech M.P. J. Biol.

As with other GTPases, ARFs cycle between active (GTP-bound) and inactive (GDP-bound) states, which are facilitated by accessory proteins. Activation of ARFs is stimulated by guanine nucleotide-exchange factors (GEFs), which promote release of GDP and binding of GTP, whereas inactivation is stimulated by GTPase-activating proteins. One GEF for ARF proteins, ARNO, has also been detected at the apical domain of polarized epithelial cells, where it colocalizes with ARF6 (23Frank S. Upender S. Hansen S.H. Casanova J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23-27Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 24Chardin P. Paris S. Antonny B. Robineau S. Beraud-Dufour S. Jackson C.L. Chabre M.

Previous work from our laboratory has investigated differences in the responses of polarized epithelial cells to S. typhimurium depending on whether the bacteria were applied to the apical or basolateral surface (7Gewirtz A.T. Siber A.M. Madara J.L. McCormick B.A. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 608-617Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Criss A.K. Ahlgren D.M. Jou T.S. McCormick B.A. Casanova J.E. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1331-1341PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we investigate the role of the small GTPase ARF6 in S. typhimurium-epithelial cell interactions using the polarizing MDCK epithelial cell line as a model system. Our results suggest that ARF6 regulates a phospholipase D-dependent lipid signaling cascade that is necessary for recruitment of protein kinase C to the apical cell surface and, subsequently, for Salmonella-induced PMN transmigration. The T23 clone of MDCK strain II cells (27Barth A.I. Pollack A.L. Altschuler Y. Mostov K.E. Nelson W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 693-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), which stably express the tetracycline-repressible transactivator (28Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4245) Google Scholar), was cultured as previously described (26Criss A.K. Ahlgren D.M. Jou T.S. McCormick B.A. Casanova J.E. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1331-1341PubMed Google Scholar). Cell culture inserts were established by seeding T23 cells at confluent density on Transwell filter supports (Costar) and used 4–5 days later. Collagen-coated cell culture inverts of T23 monolayers for PMN transmigration experiments were generated as previously described (5McCormick B.A. Colgan S.P. Delp-Archer C. Miller S.I. Madara J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 895-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 29Parkos C.A. Delp C. Arnaout M.A. Madara J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 1605-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). T84 cells were cultured as described previously (5McCormick B.A. Colgan S.P. Delp-Archer C. Miller S.I. Madara J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 895-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). The ARF6(N48R) construct (a gift of T. Leto, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) was subcloned into the pAdTet adenoviral expression vector and recombinant adenovirus produced as previously described (13Altschuler Y. Liu S. Katz L. Tang K. Hardy S. Brodsky F. Apodaca G. Mostov K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 7-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). ARNO and other ARF6 adenoviruses have been previously described (30Santy L.C. Casanova J.E. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 599-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). 18 h prior to the experiment, T23 monolayers were placed in Hanks’ balanced salt solution lacking calcium and magnesium (HBSS−; Life Technologies, Inc.) and their apical surface exposed to ARNO or ARF6 adenovirus at a titer sufficient to infect 95% of cells in the population. 2 h later, cells were replaced in growth medium in the presence of 0.5 ng/ml doxycycline (Sigma Chemical Co.) to permit attenuated gene expression. Under these conditions, expression of ARF6 constructs was found to be 1- to 2-fold over endogenous ARF6. Infected cells maintained in 20 ng/ml doxycycline to completely repress expression were used as controls. Monolayer integrity was assessed prior to each experiment by measuring transepithelial resistance with an EVOM epithelial voltohmmeter (World Precision Instruments); resistances were routinely > 200 Ω × cm2. The wild-type S. typhimurium strain SL1344 and its isogenic derivatives VV341 and EE633, which are disrupted in the hilA and sipA loci, respectively, have been previously described (8Lee C.A. Silva M. Siber A.M. Kelly A.J. Galyov E. McCormick B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12283-12288Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 31Hueck C.J. Hantman M.J. Bajaj V. Johnston C. Lee C.A. Miller S.I. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 479-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). To produce invasion-competent Salmonella, bacteria were grown under O2-limited conditions as originally described by Leeet al. (32Lee C.A. Falkow S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4304-4308Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). In some experiments, to promote synchronous, rapid internalization of bacteria, Salmonella were cultured as described by Méresse et al. (33Méresse S. Steele-Mortimer O. Finlay B.B. Gorvel J.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4394-4403Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Under both conditions, bacterial cultures corresponded regularly to 5–7 × 108 colony forming units/ml. Colony forming units were determined by plating serial dilutions of the cell lysates on MacConkey agar (Difco). Invasion assays were performed as described previously, with O2-limited bacteria (26Criss A.K. Ahlgren D.M. Jou T.S. McCormick B.A. Casanova J.E. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1331-1341PubMed Google Scholar). Human PMN were isolated from normal volunteers and purified as previously described (7Gewirtz A.T. Siber A.M. Madara J.L. McCormick B.A. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 608-617Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The basolateral-to-apical PMN transmigration assay was performed with T23 inverted monolayers essentially as described for T84 cells (7Gewirtz A.T. Siber A.M. Madara J.L. McCormick B.A. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 608-617Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and transmigrated PMN were quantified as described previously (29Parkos C.A. Delp C. Arnaout M.A. Madara J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 1605-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). In each experiment, Salmonella-induced PMN transmigration was compared with the positive control, transmigration in response to the chemoattractant N-formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine (fMLP; 10 nm), and to the negative controls, HBSS+alone or hilA Δ Salmonella (5McCormick B.A. Colgan S.P. Delp-Archer C. Miller S.I. Madara J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 895-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Neither adenoviral infection nor the presence of doxycycline affected the responsiveness of T23 monolayers in the assay. Results are represented as PMN cell equivalents calculated for each individual experiment from serial dilutions of the PMN preparation. Data (mean ± S.D. of three independent filters) were compared by Student’s t test, and experiments were performed at least three times. For experiments with various pharmacological agents, cells were treated for 30 min with the drug, then rinsed in HBSS+ prior to continuation of the experiment. Both 1- and tert-butanol were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co.; propranolol was from Biomol. PEEC bioactivity was harvested from apical supernatants of T23 monolayers infected with Salmonella as described previously for T84 monolayers (6McCormick B.A. Parkos C.A. Colgan S.P. Carnes D.K. Madara J.L. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 455-466PubMed Google Scholar). To assay PMN transmigration in response to PEEC in the apical supernatant, 20-fold concentrated apical supernatant was placed in the lower (apical) well of T23 inverted monolayers, and PMN placed in the upper (basolateral) well. T23 monolayers were infected withSalmonella as described for PEEC assay. 4 h after the start of the experiment, basolateral supernatants were collected. Equal volumes of each sample were separated on a 15% polyacrylamide gel, then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride. Canine IL-8 was detected using a monoclonal anti-IL-8 antibody (kind gift of R. Mrsny, Genentech, S. San Francisco, CA) followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG (AP Biotech). Immunofluorescence procedures were followed as previously described (26Criss A.K. Ahlgren D.M. Jou T.S. McCormick B.A. Casanova J.E. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1331-1341PubMed Google Scholar). Endogenous ARF6 was detected using a polyclonal antibody (gift of V. Hsu, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA) followed by Cy2-labeled donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Myc-ARNO was detected using the monoclonal 9E10 antibody followed by Cy2-labeled donkey anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Bacteria were detected using either a rabbit polyclonal anti-Salmonella antibody (H antigen, poly A-Z, 1:500, Difco) followed by Texas-Red labeled donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch) or a monoclonal IgA antibody toSalmonella (Sal4, gift of M. Neutra, Harvard Medical School) and rhodamine-labeled anti-mouse IgA (E-Y Laboratories). Classical PKC was detected using polyclonal anti-PKC (α/β/γ, Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) followed by Texas Red-labeled anti-rabbit IgG; bacteria were simultaneously recognized by the monoclonal Sal4 antibody followed by fluorescein-labeled anti-mouse IgA (Southern Biotechnology Associates). Images were obtained with a Zeiss LSM 410 confocal laser scanning microscope. PLD activity was measured by an adaptation of the transphosphatidylation reaction (34Morris A.J. Frohman M.A. Engebrecht J. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 252: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). T23 monolayers were incubated in OptiMEM reduced serum medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 0.5 g/liter CaCl2, 0.5% fetal bovine serum, and 2 μCi/ml [3H]oleic acid (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 24 h. Cells were serum-starved in HBSS+ containing 0.5% v/v 1-butanol (Sigma) for 45 min prior to infection withSalmonella for 1 h at 37 °C. After extensive washing, cells were placed in HBSS+ with 0.5% 1-butanol for 30 min at 37 °C. Total lipids were extracted from the cells, and the radioactivity in the phosphatidylbutanol product was measured as in Santy and Casanova (30Santy L.C. Casanova J.E. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 599-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). On average, 0.5% of total lipid counts were incorporated into [3H]phosphatidylbutanol in uninfected cells. Movement of PKC to a detergent-insoluble membrane fraction was assayed as described in Ferroet al. (35Ferro T. Neumann P. Gertzberg N. Clements R. Johnson A. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: L1107-L1117PubMed Google Scholar). All supernatants were concentrated over a 10-kDa molecular mass cutoff filter (Centricon-10, Amicon). In subsequent experiments, the intermediate (buffer B) step of the Ferroet al. protocol was omitted, thereby yielding cytosolic and membrane subcellular fractions. 50 μg of each fraction was separated on 10% polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, and immunoblotted for classical PKC isoforms (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (AP Biotech). Treatments with inhibitors or with adenoviruses did not affect the relative distribution of protein between cytosolic and membrane fractions. PLD1- and PLD2-specific polyclonal antiserum were gifts of S. Bourgoin. SipA-HA protein was purified as previously described (8Lee C.A. Silva M. Siber A.M. Kelly A.J. Galyov E. McCormick B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12283-12288Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) and added to the apical surface at a concentration of 20 μg/ml. Because of day-to-day differences, basal values of membrane-associated PKC were found to vary. The results presented are representative immunoblots from at least three independent experiments, and within each experiment, the percentage of translocated PKC is presented relative to the uninfected control. ARF6 and ARNO have been observed at the apical domain of both polarized epithelial cell lines and kidney proximal tubules (13Altschuler Y. Liu S. Katz L. Tang K. Hardy S. Brodsky F. Apodaca G. Mostov K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 7-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar,25Maranda B. Brown D. Bourgoin S. Casanova J.E. Vinay P. Ausiello D.A. Marshansky V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18540-18550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). To determine whether these proteins also localized to apical sites of Salmonella invasion, polarized MDCK cells were apically infected with S. typhimurium, and the presence of ARF6 and ARNO was examined using confocal fluorescence microscopy. Because of the low level of expression of endogenous ARNO, we moderately overexpressed myc-tagged ARNO using a recombinant adenoviral delivery system (see below). Both ARF6 and ARNO were observed on the apical and lateral plasma membranes of uninfected cells (Fig.1 A). Upon addition ofSalmonella, both proteins were detected in membrane ruffles protruding from the apical surface around individual bacteria. Endogenous ARNO and ARF6 have also been observed withinSalmonella-induced ruffles in the human polarizing intestinal cell line Caco-2. 2A. Criss and J. Casanova, unpublished observations. These images indicate that ARF6 and its exchange factor ARNO localize to sites of Salmonella-host cell contact. Because ARF6 regulates membrane ruffling and particle phagocytosis in some cell types (15Frank S.R. Hatfield J.C. Casanova J.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 3133-3146Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 17Radhakrishna H. Al-Awar O. Khachikian Z. Donaldson J.G. J.

Chem. 1998; 273: 19977-19981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), we examined whether ARF6 participated in the internalization ofS. typhimurium by epithelial cells. Polarized monolayers of the tetracycline-responsive T23 MDCK cell line were induced to express wild-type or dominant-negative (T27N) ARF6 by means of a recombinant adenovirus expression system (see “Experimental Procedures”). In this cell line, the presence of 20 ng/ml doxycycline in the culture medium represses gene expression, whereas its removal stimulates it. Coupling of an adenoviral delivery system with tetracycline-regulated transgene expression facilitates the overexpression of proteins in polarized epithelial cells, which are otherwise refractory to conventional transfection techniques. ARF6-expressing monolayers were exposed to Salmonella, and the resulting invasion efficiency was calculated. As seen in Fig. 1 B, expression of dominant-negative ARF6(T27N) did not inhibit bacterial internalization at the apical pole of MDCK cells. Furthermore, ARF6(T27N) also did not affect bacterial entry from the basolateral cell surface or in the non-polarized HeLa cell line.2 We therefore conclude that ARF6 is dispensable for internalization of Salmonella in epithelial cells. Although ARF6 did not affect bacterial entry, we investigated whether it might regulate another signaling process critical to S. typhimurium pathogenesis, the basolateral-to-apical migration of PMN across the intestinal epithelium. We initially established that canine epithelial cells (MDCK cells) were capable of promoting the transmigration of human PMN in response to S. typhimurium. Polarized monolayers of MDCK cells or T84 cells (a human polarizing epithelial cell line commonly used in PMN transmigration studies (5McCormick B.A. Colgan S.P. Delp-Archer C. Miller S.I. Madara J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 895-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar)) were first presented with invasive bacteria at the apical cell surface. PMN were then added to the basolateral aspect of the cells, and migration of PMN across the epithelium to the apical chamber was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” MDCK cells promoted the physiological (basolateral-to-apical) movement of PMN in response to S. typhimurium to nearly the same extent as T84 cells (Fig.2 A). Furthermore, a strain ofS. typhimurium lacking a functional SPI-1 type III secretion apparatus (hilA Δ), which renders it invasion-deficient, was unable to promote significant PMN transmigration across MDCK monolayers (Fig. 2 A). These observations indicate that MDCK cells, like human intestinal epithelial cells, can selectively induce proinflammatory signaling cascades in response to bacterial invasion. We then used the adenovirus-mediated gene expression system described above to assess the role of ARF6 in S. typhimurium signaling to basolaterally situated PMN. Expression of ARF6(T27N) significantly attenuated Salmonella-induced PMN transmigration compared with control (virally infected, doxycycline-repressed) cells (Fig.2 B). PMN transmigration was modestly increased by wild-type ARF6 in a reproducible, but not statistically significant, manner (1.3-fold increase in transmigrated PMN for wild-type ARF6versus control, p = 0.07). Conversely, activation of ARF6 via expression of the exchange factor ARNO potently stimulated Salmonella-induced PMN transmigration (Fig.2 C), without affecting apical bacterial entry.2The exchange activity of ARNO was required for this effect: Expression of a catalytically inactive point mutant of ARNO (E156K) produced a consistent reduction in PMN transmigration (70 ± 5.5% of transmigration across control monolayers, p = 0.095). Notably, expression of a mutant of ARF6 (Q67L) predicted to be locked in the GTP-bound state did not promote this increase in PMN transmigration, suggesting that cycling of the GTPase is critical to transduction of the Salmonella-induced signal.2Expression of these constructs did not affect background levels of PMN transmigration, i.e. in cells presented with either HBSS+ or hilA Δ Salmonella, nor did it affect PMN transmigration in response to fMLP, a potent PMN chemoattractant, whose action in this setting does not require or induce epithelial cell signaling.2 Taken together, these results strongly suggest that ARF6 regulatesSalmonella-induced PMN transmigration across epithelial monolayers, independent of an effect on bacterial internalization. To shed light on the mechanism by which ARF6 modulates S. typhimurium-induced PMN transmigration, we analyzed the effect of expression of ARF6(T27N) on two PMN chemotactic agents released by infected epithelial cells, PEEC and IL-8. PEEC release was measured using a functional assay quantifying PMN transmigration in response to a semi-purified, concentrated apical supernatant from Salmonella-infected cells (6McCormick B.A. Parkos C.A.

https://openalex.org/W2080332962,"The hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), represented by nonstructural protein 5B (NS5B), has recently emerged as a promising target for antiviral intervention. Here, we describe the isolation, functional characterization, and molecular cloning of a monoclonal antibody (mAb) inhibiting the HCV RdRp. This mAb, designated 5B-12B7, binds with high affinity to a conformational epitope in the palm subdomain of the HCV RdRp and recognizes native NS5B expressed in the context of the entire HCV polyprotein or subgenomic replicons. Complete inhibition of RdRp activity in vitro was observed at equimolar concentrations of NS5B and mAb 5B-12B7, whereas RdRp activities of classical swine fever virus NS5B and poliovirus 3D polymerase were not affected. mAb 5B-12B7 selectively inhibited NTP binding to HCV NS5B, whereas binding of template RNA was unaffected, thus explaining the mechanism of action at the molecular level. The mAb 5B-12B7 heavy and light chain variable domains were cloned by reverse transcription-PCR, and a single chain Fv fragment was assembled for expression in Escherichia coli and in eukaryotic cells. The mAb 5B-12B7 single chain Fv fragment bound to NS5B both in vitro and in transfected human cell lines and therefore may be potentially useful for intracellular immunization against HCV. More important, detailed knowledge of the mAb 5B-12B7 contact sites on the enzyme may facilitate the development of small molecule RdRp inhibitors as novel antiviral agents."
https://openalex.org/W2008641289,"The protein kinase p90Rsk has previously been implicated as a key target of the MAPK pathway during M phase of meiosis II in Xenopus oocytes. To determine whether Rsk is a mediator of MAPK for stimulation of the G2/M transition early in meiosis I, we sought to generate a form of Rsk that would be constitutively active in resting, G2 phase oocytes. Initial studies revealed that an N-terminal truncation of 43 amino acids conferred enhanced specific activity on the enzyme in G2 phase, and stability was highest if the C terminus was not truncated. The full-length enzyme is known to be activated by phosphorylation at five sites. Two of these sites and flanking residues were replaced with either aspartic or glutamic acid, and Tyr699 was mutated to alanine. The resulting construct, termed fully activated (FA) Rsk, had constitutive activity in G2 phase, with a specific activity equivalent to that of wild type Rsk in M phase. In eight independent experiments ∼45% of oocytes expressing FA-Rsk underwent germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD, the G2/M transition) in the absence of progesterone, and this effect could be observed even in the presence of the MAPK kinase inhibitor U0126. Moreover, the specific activity of FA-Rsk in vivo was unaffected by U0126. In oocytes that did not undergo GVBD with FA-Rsk expression, subsequent treatment with progesterone resulted in a very rapid rate of GVBD even in the presence of U0126 to inhibit the endogenous MAPK/Rsk pathway. These results indicate that Rsk is the mediator of MAPK effects for the G2/M transition in meiosis I and in a subpopulation of oocytes Rsk is sufficient to trigger the G2/M transition.

During maturation several signal transduction pathways are activated, including the polo-like kinase pathway and the MAPK1 pathway (see Refs. 1Nebreda A.R. Ferby A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 666-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholarand 2Palmer A. Nebreda A.R. Prog. Cell Cycle Res. 2000; 4: 131-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar for review). The role of the MAPK pathway in oocyte maturation has been studied at several points in the process. At the end of maturation the cell cycle is arrested in metaphase of meiosis II by a MAPK-dependent activity known as cytostatic factor (CSF) (3Masui Y. Markert C.L. J. Exp. Zool. 1971; 177: 1229-1245Crossref Scopus (1153) Google Scholar). The substrate of MAPK that mediates CSF arrest appears to be the protein kinase p90Rsk1 (Rsk), inasmuch as activated Rsk causes CSF arrest even when MAPK is inactive (4Gross S.D. Schwab M.S. Lewellyn A.L. Maller J.L. Science. 1999; 286: 1365-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), and depletion of Rsk from extracts removes CSF activity (5Bhatt R.R. Ferrell Jr., J.E. Science. 1999; 286: 1362-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Rsk may mediate this function by activating the protein kinase Bub1 (6Schwab M.S. Roberts B.T. Gross S.D. Tunquist B.J. Taieb F.E. Lewellyn A.L. Maller J.L. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 141-150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), a component of the spindle assembly checkpoint pathway in the cell cycle, leading to inhibition of the anaphase-promoting complex (APC), an E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets cyclin B for degradation in anaphase (see Ref. 7Zachariae W. Nasmyth K. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2039-2058Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar for review). Another MAPK-dependent transition in the cell cycle, the linkage of M phases at the meiosis I → II transition, is also accounted for by activation of Rsk and subsequent inhibition of APC-mediated cyclin B degradation (8Gross S.D. Schwab M.S. Taieb F.E. Lewellyn A.L. Qian Y.-W. Maller J.L. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 430-438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The third cell cycle transition in maturation regulated by the MAPK pathway is the G2/M transition upon entry into meiosis I in response to progesterone. MAPK is activated after progesterone treatment as a consequence of new synthesis of the c-Mos proto-oncogene product, a MAPK kinase kinase (for review, see Ref. 9Sagata N. Bioessays. 1997; 1: 13-21Crossref Scopus (238) Google Scholar). MAPK plays an important role in entry into meiosis I as judged by both gain-of-function and loss-of-function experiments. Inhibition of Mos translation or inhibition of MAPK kinase leads to delays in the rate of maturation and/or a reduction in the fraction of oocytes able to undergo GVBD (10Sagata N. Oskarsson M.

On the other hand, overexpression of Mos, activated MAPK kinase 1, or activated MAPK can cause GVBD in the absence of progesterone in a large fraction of the oocyte population (13Haccard O.

Inasmuch as the effects of the MAPK pathway in M phase of meiosis II are mediated by Rsk (4Gross S.D. Schwab M.S. Lewellyn A.L. Maller J.L. Science. 1999; 286: 1365-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 5Bhatt R.R. Ferrell Jr., J.E. Science. 1999; 286: 1362-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 8Gross S.D.

Mutations were introduced into the FLAG-taggedXenopus Rsk1 sequence (17Jones S.W. Erikson E. Blenis J. Maller J.L. Erikson R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3377-3381Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) by polymerase chain reaction using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. mRNA encoding various constructs was transcribed using a mMessage Machine kit (Ambion), and 50 nl of 1 mg/ml mRNA was injected into each oocyte as described previously (4Gross S.D. Schwab M.S. Lewellyn A.L. Maller J.L. Science. 1999; 286: 1365-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Immune complex kinase assays with anti-FLAG beads (Sigma) were performed as described previously using S6 peptide as substrate (4Gross S.D. Schwab M.S. Lewellyn A.L. Maller J.L. Science. 1999; 286: 1365-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 18Taieb F.E. Gross S.D. Lewellyn A.L. Maller J.L. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 508-513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). To determine the specific activity of various Rsk constructs, anti-FLAG immune precipitates were immunoblotted with anti-FLAG antibodies, and kinase activity was normalized for level of expression. All samples from a particular experiment were blotted on the same gel, and control experiments demonstrated that the FLAG antibody beads completely depleted all recombinant protein from the extracts. GVBD was monitored initially by formation of a well defined white spot in the animal pole of the oocyte and was generally confirmed biochemically using procedures for assaying histone H1 kinase activity, cyclin B2 electrophoretic mobility shifts, and Cdc2 Tyr15phosphorylation that have been described previously (4Gross S.D. Schwab M.S. Lewellyn A.L. Maller J.L. Science. 1999; 286: 1365-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 12Roy L.M. Haccard O. Izumi T. Lattes B.G. Lewellyn A.L. Maller J.L.

Our general approach to investigate Rsk function in the induction of maturation was to generate a form of Rsk that would be constitutively active in the G2 environment of a resting oocyte. These efforts took advantage of the evidence that activation of the Rsk N-terminal kinase domain requires phosphorylation of specific sites by 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK-1), MAPK, and the Rsk C-terminal kinase domain (see Ref. 19Frodin M. Gammeltoft S. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1999; 151: 65-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar for review). Previous efforts investigating Rsk structure/function relationships had led to generation of a Rsk construct lacking the C-terminal kinase domain, termed CA-Rsk, that had significant constitutive activity in M phase of meiosis II even in the presence of a potent inhibitor of the MAPK pathway, U0126 (4Gross S.D. Schwab M.S. Lewellyn A.L. Maller J.L. Science. 1999; 286: 1365-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 8Gross S.D. Schwab M.S. Taieb F.E. Lewellyn A.L. Qian Y.-W. Maller J.L. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 430-438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Although CA-Rsk is active in M phase without an active MAPK pathway (4Gross S.D. Schwab M.S. Lewellyn A.L. Maller J.L. Science. 1999; 286: 1365-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 8Gross S.D. Schwab M.S. Taieb F.E. Lewellyn A.L. Qian Y.-W. Maller J.L. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 430-438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), it is much less active in the G2 environment of an oocyte. 2S. D. Gross, A. L. Lewellyn, and J. L. Maller, unpublished data. The reason for this is unknown but could possibly relate to differences in the ability of PDK-1 to phosphorylate or bind to Rsk in G2 versus M phase, since CA-Rsk appears to require only PDK-1-dependent phosphorylation for activity (4Gross S.D. Schwab M.S. Lewellyn A.L. Maller J.L. Science. 1999; 286: 1365-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Another possibility is that CA-Rsk expression or stability is lower in resting G2 phase oocytes than in M phase. Some evidence for this has accumulated from expression studies of Rsk in Sf9 cells in which CA-Rsk is much less stable after isolation than full-length Rsk or Rsk that has elevated specific activity due to truncation of 43 amino acids at the N terminus (constructs E and Fin Fig. 1). Therefore we sought a way to enhance the constitutive activity of CA-Rsk in a G2environment. Initial attempts, which involved increased truncation of the C terminus, with or without truncation at the N terminus, led to constructs that either had lower specific activity or failed to be activated even at GVBD (Fig. 1). As an alternate approach, we undertook substitution of known activating phosphorylation sites in Rsk with acidic residues, either glutamic or aspartic acid. Previous studies with other kinases have shown that such substitutions can sometimes mimic the activating effects of phosphorylation and result in constitutive enzyme activity (20Qian Y.-W. Erikson E. Maller J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8625-8632Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Mansour S.J. Candia J.M. Gloor K.K. Ahn N.G.

Chem. 1996; 27: 31612-31617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In some cases, better constitutive activity has been obtained if residues adjacent to the phosphorylation site are also mutated to an acidic amino acid (23Flotow H. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3724-3727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 2 shows the phosphorylation sites involved in Rsk activation (24Dalby K.N. Morrice N. Caudwell F.B. Avruch J. Cohen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 27 (3): 1496-1505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (314) Google Scholar). The N-terminal kinase domain requires phosphorylation of the activation loop at Ser220 by PDK-1 (4Gross S.D. Schwab M.S. Lewellyn A.L. Maller J.L. Science. 1999; 286: 1365-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 25Jensen C.J. Buch M.B. Krag T.O. Hemmings B.A. Gammeltoft S. Frodin M. J. Biol.

Biol. 1999; 9: 810-820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). This event is facilitated by the binding of PDK-1 to Ser378 in the linker region after it has been phosphorylated by the C-terminal kinase domain (27Frodin M. Jensen C.J. Merienne K. Gammeltoft S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2924-2934Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Activation of the C-terminal kinase domain requires phosphorylation by MAPK of Thr570 in the T-loop (24Dalby K.N. Morrice N. Caudwell F.B. Avruch J. Cohen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 27 (3): 1496-1505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (314) Google Scholar). MAPK also phosphorylates two residues in the linker region, Thr358and Ser362, that appear to contribute to activation (24Dalby K.N. Morrice N. Caudwell F.B. Avruch J. Cohen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 27 (3): 1496-1505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (314) Google Scholar). As an approach for generating constitutive activity, two MAPK phosphorylation sites in the linker region were mutated to aspartic acid (Fig. 2). In addition, as indicated, adjacent residues were also mutated to either glutamic or aspartic acid, and Tyr699 was mutated to Ala, based on evidence that this increases autophosphorylation of Rsk at Ser378 (28Poteet-Smith C.E. Smith J.A. Lannigan D.A. Freed T.A. Sturgill T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22135-22138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). To increase specific activity, the N-terminal 43 amino acids were truncated as previously described for CA-Rsk (4Gross S.D. Schwab M.S. Lewellyn A.L. Maller J.L. Science. 1999; 286: 1365-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The final construct, termed fully active Rsk (FA-Rsk) (Fig. 2) was tested for activity after expression in oocytes. mRNA encoding FLAG-tagged FA-Rsk was injected into oocytes, and entry into meiosis I (the G2/M transition) was monitored by scoring GVBD. As shown in Fig.3 A, in eight independent experiments, an average of 45% of the oocytes underwent GVBD in the absence of progesterone (range 0–90%). No GVBD was observed after expression of β-galactosidase, wild type Rsk (WT), or kinase-dead (N191A) WT or FA-Rsk. Western blotting experiments showed that all the active FLAG-tagged Rsk constructs were expressed at similar levels (Fig. 3 B). Morphologically, GVBD induced by FA-Rsk was indistinguishable from that induced by progesterone. Moreover, in FA-Rsk expressing oocytes that underwent GVBD either with (G) or without (S) progesterone treatment, MAPK became activated and cyclin B2 was shifted electrophoretically, indicative of M phase, as also shown by Tyr15dephosphorylation of cyclin B/Cdc2 (Fig. 3 B). These biochemical features were equivalent to those observed with progesterone-treated control oocytes. Other studies with Rsk produced in Sf9 cells show that after purification FA-Rsk has a specific activity five times greater than wild type Rsk (data not shown).Figure 3Induction of the G2/M transition by FA-Rsk. A, expression of FA-Rsk (FA) for 18 h induced maturation in ∼45% of all oocytes tested, whereas expression of β-galactosidase (bgal), wild type Rsk (WT), and kinase-dead Rsk (WT(N191A) and FA(N191A) had no effect. (Bar, mean + S.E. of eight independent experiments.)B, oocytes were injected with mRNA encoding the indicated protein and incubated for 18 h. In the case of FA-Rsk, oocytes that had not undergone GVBD by 18 h were treated with progesterone and frozen shortly after undergoing GVBD. Extracts were prepared from resting oocytes (R), progesterone-treated oocytes that underwent GVBD (G), FA-Rsk expressing oocytes that underwent GVBD without progesterone (S), and oocytes injected with kinase-dead Rsk (NA). Lysates of these samples were blotted for the FLAG epitope, phosphorylated (active) MAPK (pMAPK), Cyclin B2, and phosphorylated (inactive) Cdc2 (pCdc2). PROG, progesterone treatment.C, the protein products of constructs were immunoprecipitated from aliquots of the indicated extracts immunoblotted in B and assessed for S6 kinase activity as described under “Materials and Methods.” In addition to activity assays, these same immunoprecipitates were also immunoblotted for the FLAG epitope to evaluate expression levels (lower panel).D, total activities of the constructs shown in Cwere normalized to their respective signals on the FLAG immunoblot using densitometry as described under “Materials and Methods” to give specific activity.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Assays of the total cellular activity of the FLAG-tagged FA-Rsk showed substantial activity in a G2 environment, ∼40% of the level seen in M phase with wild type enzyme (Fig. 3 C,lanes 2 and 4). Activity at GVBD in those oocytes that matured in response to FA-Rsk (S, lane 5 in Fig. 3 C) was even higher and equivalent to progesterone-treated controls (compare lanes 2 and5), due in part to increased translation and accumulation of FA-Rsk in the 5 h required for GVBD. To directly compare WT Rsk with FA-Rsk, the specific activity of the constructs was determined as described under “Materials and Methods” (Fig. 3 D). It is evident that FA-Rsk achieved in a G2 environment nearly the same specific activity as wild type Rsk in M phase (Fig. 3 D, compare lanes 2 and 4). The specific activity of FA-Rsk at GVBD was even higher and was the same in the presence or absence of progesterone. As described in the Introduction, CA-Rsk is able to partially inhibit the APC and stimulate cyclin B synthesis even in the presence of U0126 (8Gross S.D. Schwab M.S. Taieb F.E. Lewellyn A.L. Qian Y.-W. Maller J.L. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 430-438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), which completely inhibits the endogenous MAPK/Rsk pathway (4Gross S.D.

Biol. 2001; 11: 508-513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3 B, GVBD induced by FA-Rsk led to activation of the endogenous MAPK pathway, most likely due to an established feedback loop from active Cdc2 to translational activation of Mos mRNA (29Gotoh Y. Nishida E. Prog. Cell Cycle Res. 1995; 1: 287-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 30VanRenterghem B. Gibbs J.B. Maller J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19935-19938Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate whether the ability of FA-Rsk to cause GVBD is dependent on an active endogenous MAPK pathway, FA-Rsk was expressed by mRNA injection into oocytes incubated in U0126 to inhibit the MAPK pathway (Fig. 4). In eight independent experiments, an average of 26% of oocytes still underwent GVBD in the absence of endogenous MAPK activity. Biochemical analysis (Fig. 4 B) confirmed equivalent action of FA-Rsk on cyclin B2/Cdc2 (MPF) activation regardless of MAPK activation. Total FA-Rsk activity in the oocyte was higher at GVBD in the absence of U0126 (Fig. 4 C), but this difference reflected higher expression of FA-Rsk in the absence of U0126, as judged by FA-Rsk specific activity (Fig. 4 D). Higher expression in the absence of UO126 is not unexpected in light of reports of increased protein synthesis after MAPK expression (12Roy L.M. Haccard O. Izumi T. Lattes B.G. Lewellyn A.L. Maller J.L. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2203-2211PubMed Google Scholar, 13Haccard O. Lewellyn A. Hartley R.S. Erikson E. Maller J.L. Dev. Biol. 1995; 168: 677-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The oocytes that did not mature in response to FA-Rsk were also examined after progesterone addition (Fig. 4 E). It was found that such oocytes underwent a dramatically accelerated rate of GVBD that was only slightly affected by U0126. This suggests that a rate-limiting step in oocyte maturation is likely to be affected by Rsk. The results in this paper report the generation of a form ofXenopus Rsk 1 that is constitutively active both in M phase and in the resting G2 phase of an immature oocyte. Constitutive activity was defined previously as activity that is not dependent on exogenous phosphorylation of Rsk by MAPK and appears to require only phosphorylation by PDK-1 for activity (4Gross S.D. Schwab M.S. Lewellyn A.L. Maller J.L. Science. 1999; 286: 1365-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). FA-Rsk was active in G2 phase oocytes that have low MAPK activity as well as in the presence of U0126, which blocks all detectable MAPK activation. The multiple negative charges at each of the MAPK phosphorylation sites in the linker proved to be important for generation of constitutive activity in a G2 environment inasmuch as single acidic mutations at the phosphorylation sites did not result in constitutive activity (Ref. 24Dalby K.N. Morrice N. Caudwell F.B. Avruch J. Cohen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 27 (3): 1496-1505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (314) Google Scholar and data not shown). The basis for higher constitutive activity of FA-Rsk in G2than was evident for CA-Rsk may involve enhanced phosphorylation of Ser220 by PDK-1. Replacement of Ser220 with multiple acidic residues resulted in forms that lacked any detectable activity toward S6 peptide, and mutation of Ser378, which forms a docking site for PDK-1 (19Frodin M. Gammeltoft S. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1999; 151: 65-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar, 27Frodin M. Jensen C.J. Merienne K. Gammeltoft S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2924-2934Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), also did not result in an active enzyme. Finally, maximal constitutive activity was only observed after mutation of Thr699 to alanine (data not shown), a change reported to increase phosphorylation at Ser378 (28Poteet-Smith C.E. Smith J.A. Lannigan D.A. Freed T.A. Sturgill T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22135-22138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). These considerations point to Ser220 phosphorylation by PDK-1 as a key event in activation. It was suggested previously for CA-Rsk (4Gross S.D. Schwab M.S. Lewellyn A.L. Maller J.L. Science. 1999; 286: 1365-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) that PDK-1 activity may be higher in M phase than in G2, or binding to Rsk at Ser378 may increase, possibly accounting for higher FA-Rsk activity in M phase. However, with FA-Rsk the specific activity in G2 and M phases is similar even in the presence of U0126 (Fig. 4). The lower total activity of FA-Rsk in G2 phase oocytes appears to follow directly from lower expression levels (Figs. 3 and 4). Expression may be higher in oocytes with GVBD due to a general increase in protein synthesis rate after GVBD (1Nebreda A.R. Ferby A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 666-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 2Palmer A. Nebreda A.R. Prog. Cell Cycle Res. 2000; 4: 131-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The constitutive activity of FA-Rsk in G2 phase allowed an evaluation of the role of Rsk in mediating MAPK effects on entry into meiosis. Approximately 45% of oocytes underwent GVBD in response to FA-Rsk expression, even though total oocyte Rsk activity in G2 was only 40% of that present at M phase with wild type enzyme (Fig. 3). However, the specific activity in G2 was equivalent to that of M phase Rsk; this could suggest that Rsk exists in a complex with substrates or regulators so that specific activity is more important than total activity. In support of this concept, Rsk is known to exist in a complex with MAPK and/or Myt 1 in oocytes (31Hsiao K.M. Chou S.Y. Shih S.J. Ferrell Jr., J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5480-5484Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 32Palmer A. Gavin A.C. Nebreda A.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5037-5047Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar), and CSF arrest in embryonic blastomeres by CA-Rsk is evident even when total Rsk activity is below that present in CSF-arrested unfertilized eggs (4Gross S.D. Schwab M.S. Lewellyn A.L. Maller J.L. Science. 1999; 286: 1365-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). A substantial response to FA-Rsk was still observed in the presence of U0126, which blocks even basal activity of the MAPK pathway. Previously we reported that a constitutively active form of MAPK could induce GVBD in oocytes (13Haccard O. Lewellyn A. Hartley R.S. Erikson E. Maller J.L. Dev. Biol. 1995; 168: 677-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The present results indicate that this effect of MAPK is directly mediated by p90Rsk, and combined with previous reports (4Gross S.D. Schwab M.S. Lewellyn A.L. Maller J.L. Science. 1999; 286: 1365-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 5Bhatt R.R. Ferrell Jr., J.E. Science. 1999; 286: 1362-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 8Gross S.D.

Biol. 2000; 10: 430-438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), it appears that at all stages of maturation the effects of the MAPK pathway are mediated solely by activation of Rsk. It is notable that not all oocytes underwent GVBD with FA-Rsk, but even those that did not reach GVBD nevertheless were greatly accelerated into the G2/M transition upon subsequent progesterone administration. This indicates that other pathways besides MAPK are also likely to be important for the G2/M transition. In particular, the polo-like kinase pathway has been implicated in the activation of the phosphatase Cdc25C, which is required for the dephosphorylation and activation of cyclin B/Cdc2 (MPF) (1Nebreda A.R. Ferby A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 666-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 2Palmer A. Nebreda A.R. Prog. Cell Cycle Res. 2000; 4: 131-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The relative insensitivity of Cdc25C activation to the MAPK pathway has been seen previously. Mos, a MAPKKK, and MAPKK induce maturation very slowly when expressed (15Huang W. Kessler D.S. Erikson R.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 237-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 16Yew N. Mellini M.L. Vande Woude G.F. Nature. 1992; 355: 649-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Thiophosphorylated MAPK also induces maturation very slowly (16Yew N. Mellini M.L. Vande Woude G.F. Nature. 1992; 355: 649-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) and does not result in complete Cdc25C activation. Finally, Mos addition to oocyte extracts activates MAPK but does not activate Cdc25C (33Shibuya E.K. Ruderman J.V. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 781-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 34Qian Y.-W. Erikson E. Taieb F.E. Maller J.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1791-1799Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In contrast, immunodepletion of Plx1 from oocyte extracts cycling through maturation completely blocks Cdc25C activation even when the MAPK pathway is fully activated by Mos (34Qian Y.-W. Erikson E. Taieb F.E. Maller J.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1791-1799Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In any case, while the results here suggest the effects of MAPK on the G2/M transition are mediated by Rsk, the substrate for Rsk involved in this transition is not clear at present. The original substrate for Rsk in this system, ribosomal protein S6, seems unlikely to be involved in cell cycle progression. In M phase, the actions of Rsk to inhibit the APC have been linked to the ability of Rsk to phosphorylate and activate the protein kinase Bub1 (6Schwab M.S. Roberts B.T. Gross S.D. Tunquist B.J. Taieb F.E. Lewellyn A.L. Maller J.L. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 141-150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), a key regulator of the APC and spindle assembly checkpoint (7Zachariae W. Nasmyth K. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2039-2058Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). However, Bub1 is inactive until GVBD (6Schwab M.S. Roberts B.T. Gross S.D. Tunquist B.J. Taieb F.E. Lewellyn A.L. Maller J.L. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 141-150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and therefore is unlikely to be important for entry into M phase. Another protein kinase, glycogen-synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3) can be inactivated by phosphorylation at Ser9 by Rsk, and inactivation occurs during Xenopus oocyte maturation (35Fisher D.L. Morin N. Dorée M. Development (Camb.). 1999; 126: 567-576PubMed Google Scholar). While several kinases can phosphorylate GSK-3 at Ser9 in vitro, it is interesting that Rsk has been implicated as the specific kinase responsible for inactivation of GSK-3 during axis formation in early Xenopus embryos (36Torres M.A. Eldar-Finkelman H. Krebs E.G. Moon R.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1427-1437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Perhaps the most likely substrate for induction of GVBD by Rsk is the Myt 1 protein kinase. Myt 1 is responsible for inactivation of pre-MPF in resting G2 phase oocytes by phosphorylating Tyr15 and Thr14 in the Cdc2 ATP-binding site (32Palmer A. Gavin A.C. Nebreda A.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5037-5047Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). The level of tyrosine 15 phosphorylation is known to be rate-limiting for MPF activation (1Nebreda A.R. Ferby A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 666-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 2Palmer A. Nebreda A.R. Prog. Cell Cycle Res. 2000; 4: 131-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Rsk is able to phosphorylate and inactivate Myt 1 (32Palmer A. Gavin A.C. Nebreda A.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5037-5047Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar), promoting the net dephosphorylation and activation of MPF, leading to GVBD. Support for this model comes from evidence that CA-Rsk causes phosphorylation of Myt 1 in the presence of U0126 at the meiosis I → II transition (8Gross S.D. Schwab M.S. Taieb F.E. Lewellyn A.L. Qian Y.-W. Maller J.L. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 430-438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Recent evidence in several systems has suggested that nuclear progesterone receptors can activate MAPK by a nongenomic mechanism, most likely by interaction with the SH3 domain of pp60c-Srcand other signaling molecules (37Watson C.S. Gametchu B. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1999; 220: 9-19Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Boonyaratanakornkit V. Scott M.P. Ribon V. Sherman L. Anderson S.M. Maller J.L. Miller W.T. Edwards D.P. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 269-280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). It has been reported that overexpression of the nuclear progesterone receptor inXenopus oocytes accelerates progesterone-induced GVBD (39Tian J. Kim S. Hellig E. Ruderman J.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14358-14363Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar,40Bayaa M. Booth R.A. Sheng Y. Liu X.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12607-12612Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), and this acceleration is abolished by mutations in a proline-rich sequence in the receptor that binds SH3 domains (38Boonyaratanakornkit V. Scott M.P. Ribon V. Sherman L. Anderson S.M. Maller J.L. Miller W.T. Edwards D.P. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 269-280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Microinjection of active pp60v-Src into oocytes also accelerates GVBD and increases S6 phosphorylation due to Rsk (41Spivack J.G. Erikson R.L. Maller J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 1631-1634Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The ability shown here of FA-Rsk to induce GVBD by itself or to accelerate the rate of progesteone-induced GVBD suggests that Rsk is also the mediator of nongenomic signaling through the MAPK pathway by nuclear progesterone receptors in oocytes.

This 15-amino acid peptide motif is the TRBP minimum TAR RNA-binding motif that binds preferentially to GC-rich oligoribonucleotides and destabilizes the TAR RNA structure (5Gatignol A. Buckler C.

All of the available data suggest that TRBP facilitates viral replication by two mechanisms: direct activation of the LTR through TAR binding and inhibition of the host antiviral mechanisms through increased translation. During HIV infection, the central nervous system is an important viral reservoir that contributes to viral persistence (16Pierson T. McArthur J. Siliciano R.F. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 665-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). HIV invades the brain and infects astrocytes and microglia early in the course of the disease. Astrocyte infection is remarkable for the low production of new virus (17Di Rienzo A.M. Aloisi F. Santarcangelo A.C. Palladino C. Olivetta E. Genovese D. Verani P. Levi G. Arch.

Reports indicate that this dormant HIV infection in primary human astrocytes and astrocytoma cell lines is due to either a block in Rev function and/or inefficient translation of HIV structural proteins (19Neumann M.

A recent observation indicates that HIV replication can be restored in astrocytes by coexpression of TRBP or a catalytically inactive PKR mutant. Furthermore, astrocytes express a very low level of endogenous TRBP, which may explain the restoration of normal translational function by the protein. These results suggest that a heightened responsiveness of the interferon-induced PKR pathway in astrocytes makes these cells refractory to HIV-1 replication. They also point out a key role for TRBP in HIV replication. 2J. Thorne, C. Ong, A. Gatignol, and D. F. Purcell, manuscript in preparation. 2J. Thorne, C. Ong, A. Gatignol, and D. F. Purcell, manuscript in preparation. Although these results do not explain the restoration of a deficient Rev function observed by others in astrocytes (19Neumann M. Felber B.K. Kleinschmidt A.

Despite an extensive search for the humantarbp2 gene in genomic libraries prepared in λ phage, no clones were isolated. Here, we describe the characterization of thetarbp2 gene in a YAC clone and the analysis of its complete sequence cloned from genomic DNA. We report the identification of two promoter regions that specifically transcribe TRBP1 and TRBP2 mRNAs and show that TRBP1 and TRBP2 are the result of distinct splicing events that result from the different upstream splice donor sites in these alternative pre-mRNAs. In addition, we show that TRBP1 and TRBP2 promoters are expressed less in astrocytic cells that are nonproductive for HIV-1 replication compared with HeLa cells that efficiently produce HIV. This specific down-regulation of TRBP1 and TRBP2 expression in astrocytoma cells was confirmed on endogenous TRBP1 and TRBP2 mRNA levels. YAC clones (24Albertsen H.M. Abderrahim H. Cann H.M.

PCR amplifications were performed in 100 μl of reaction mixture containing 200 ng of genomic DNA or 10 ng of pBS-TRBP2 as control (2Gatignol A. Duarte M. Daviet L. Chang Y.-N. Jeang K.-T.

The conditions for the amplifications were 95 °C for 5 min; 40 cycles of 95 °C for 1 min, 58 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min; and incubation at 72 °C for 5 min. The reactions were performed in a thermocycler (Biometra) and run on a 1.5% agarose gel for size determination. TRBP gene PCR products were excised from agarose gels and eluted with a Quik Pik kit (Stratagene) and inserted into pCR-ScriptTM Amp SK(+) plasmid cloning vector (Stratagene). The pGl2 expression vector system (Promega), containing firefly luciferase as a reporter gene, was used to measure the promoter activity of cloned genomic DNA fragments from the 5′ region of the TRBP gene. Genomic DNA fragments were obtained by PCR as previously described for the genomic PCR subcloning. Primers derived from the sense and antisense strands of the TRBP promoter regions were synthesized (Invitrogen) with additional terminal adapter sequences for KpnI, SacI, orNheI restriction sites (TableI). PCR products were cloned into the multiple cloning site of pGl2-basic vector, which does not contain any promoter or enhancer element. Correct insertion and sequence was confirmed by sequencing. pGl2-control vector that contains the SV40 promoter and enhancer sequences was used as control (Promega). Similarly, pLTR-Luc was constructed by inserting the HIV-1 LTR into pGl2-basic vector (3Duarte M. Graham K. Daher A. Battisti P.-L. Bannwarth S. Segeral E. Jeang K.-T. Gatignol A. J. Biomed.

The membranes were incubated in hybridizing solution (20 mmphosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 5× SSC, 7% SDS, 10× Denhardt's solution, and 1% salmon sperm DNA) with 9 × 106 cpm of 32P-labeled TRBP cDNA probe. After overnight hybridization at 42 °C, the membrane was washed twice in 2× SSC, 2% SDS for 20 min at room temperature, washed once in 0.1× SDS, 0.1% SDS at 50 °C for 15 min, and exposed 24 h to x-ray film. Total RNA was isolated from Jurkat cell lines using the Tripure isolation reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). TRBP-specific primers were 5′ end-radiolabeled using T4 Polynucleotide kinase (Invitrogen) and [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Primer sequences were: 5′-CGGCTTTGAGAAGGTCGTACACAGGCGTCT-3′ (A primer), 5′-CTGCAGAAGGCTGATCGGGGTCTTGCCTGG-3′ (B primer), 5′-AGCCTCCACGCGCCCCAATACACAGCCTAC-3′ (C primer), and 5′-CTCCACGCGCCCCAATACACAGCCTACGAG-3′ (D primer). [γ-32P]TRBP-specific primer (125 ng) and total RNA (20 μg) were ethanol coprecipitated, and the dried pellet was resuspended in 30 μl of 40 mm PIPES, pH 6.4, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 0.4 m NaCl, 80% formamide, denatured at 85 °C for 10 min, and incubated at room temperature for 30 min and overnight at 30 °C. The reaction mixtures were ethanol-precipitated. Dried pellet was used to synthesize the single strand cDNA. The reaction mix containing 30 units of RNasin (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.), 1 mm dNTP, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 300 units of Superscript II (Invitrogen) in a 25-μl volume was incubated at 42 °C for 2 h. 10 units of RNase were added, and the samples were incubated at 42 °C for 30 min prior to phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. Dried samples were resuspended in 40 μl of water. 4 μl were mixed with 97.5% formamide-dye mix and run on 6% acrylamide, 7 m urea gel, which was dried and exposed for autoradiography. To determine the cDNA size, a sequencing reaction was performed with a T7 DNA polymerase sequencing kit (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol and run on the same gel. HeLa and glioblastoma/astrocytoma cell line U251MG cells (28Bigner D.D. Bigner S.H. Ponten J. Westermark B. Mahaley M.S. Ruoslahti E. Herschman H. Eng L.F. Wikstrand C.J. J. Neuropathol. Exp.

Each transfection involved cotransfection with 5 μg of pGl2-basic containing different TRBP fragments or pGl2-control or pLTR-Luc vector and 1 μg of control plasmid in which the Renilla gene is expressed from the thymidine kinase promoter (pRL-TK; Promega). DNA was transfected by calcium phosphate precipitation according to the manufacturer's protocol (Stratagene). 18 h after the transfection, the cells were rinsed with serum-free Dulbecco's minimal essential medium and incubated for 24 h with Dulbecco's minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 150 μl of lysis buffer. The luciferase/Renilla coexpression was measured with 20 μl of cell lysates by luminescence method according to the manufacturer's protocol (Promega). Each transfection was performed in triplicate and was repeated three times. The luciferase activity of each sample was normalized to the Renilla activity. Total RNA was isolated from HeLa, Jurkat, and U251MG cell lines using the tripure isolation reagent and treated by DNase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). TRBP cDNA was amplified from 5 μg of total RNA using 5 pmol of TRBP1/2 antisense- (5′-GGTCTTGCCTGGGTTGGC-3′) or GAPDH antisense-specific primer (5′-CCAAAGTTGTCATGGATGACC-3′) in a 25-μl reaction containing 30 units of RNasin (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.), 1 mm dNTP, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 300 units of Superscript II (Invitrogen). Incubation was performed at 42 °C for 1 h, and 5 μl of the resulting reaction containing the single strand cDNA template were used for PCR amplification. The conditions for TRBP and GAPDH amplifications were 95 °C for 5 min; 35 cycles of 95 °C for 1 min, 58 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min; and a 5-min incubation at 72 °C. PCR amplifications were performed in a 100-μl reaction mixture containing 250 ng of each GAPDH (5′-CCTTCATTGACCTCAACTACAT-3′) or TRBP primer (TRBP1 primer −302/−286: 5′-CCAGCTGCGACACAGATG-3′, TRBP2 primer +38/+56: 5′-GGGGACTCCATATCCCAG-3′), 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mmdNTP, and 1× Taq buffer (Invitrogen). Antisense primers were as described above for reverse reaction. To verify the 5′ extremity of TRBP1 and TRBP2, three different sense primers were used: TRBP1, −276/−258 5′-GCTCTTGGGTTCTGTAGT-3′, −302/−286 5′-CCAGCTGCGACACAGATG-3′, and −462/−444 5′-CCTTCCTTCATCAAGGAGG-3′ with antisense primer (5′-GTCGCCAACGGTGACCCG-3′); TRBP2, +70/+87 5′-GGCCCTACCGGCCGCGAC-3′, +37/+55, 5′-GGGGACTCCATATCCCAG-3′, and −127/−108: 5′-CGGGACGGTATTACAAAC-3′ with antisense primer (5′-GGTCTTGCCTGGGTTGGC-3′). Negative control was performed by PCR amplification of reverse reaction without Superscript II enzyme. The products were resolved on a 1.5% agarose gel. Several approaches have been used to clone genomic DNA before the completion of the human genome project. They include screening from YACs or bacterial artificial chromosomes and PCR methods from genomic DNA or libraries. We have selected primers separated by 57 bp in TRBP cDNA that give rise to a 400-bp band after PCR on genomic DNA from HeLa cells (Fig.1A). These primers were used in a large scale screening procedure at the Centre d'Étude du Polymorphisme Humain (Paris, France) to screen for positive YACs. One clone, 791E7, located in 12p11-p12 by sequence-tagged sites was found to be positive, and we obtained nine other candidates (862H3, 954G10, 817H1, 929E11, 964C10, 952A2, 763G6, 651F10, 962B2, and 664H11) within the same region of chromosome 12 (25). To verify the presence of thetarbp2 gene, DNAs from YACs and human genome were cut byEcoRI, subjected to Southern blotting, and hybridized with a TRBP cDNA probe. Only YAC 791E7 showed three positive bands at 3.4, 2.1, and 1.5 kb (Fig. 1B), identical to the molecular masses observed with human genomic DNA and thus confirming the presence of the tarbp2 gene in YAC 791E7. The higher band in genomic DNA is the 15-kb band from the pseudogene previously observed (3Duarte M. Graham K. Daher A. Battisti P.-L. Bannwarth S. Segeral E. Jeang K.-T. Gatignol A. J. Biomed. Sci. 2000; 6: 494-506Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 22Kozak C. Gatignol A. Graham K. Jeang K.-T. McBride O. Genomics. 1995; 25: 66-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The presence of the gene was further confirmed by PCR on the YAC 791E7 DNA with the previous primers compared with genomic DNA (Fig.1C). The human tarbp2 gene has been located by TRBP cDNA primers and sequence-tagged site in region 12q12-q13. This discrepancy between the localization of YAC791E7 and thetarbp2 gene may be explained by a recombination between sequences from regions 12q12-q13 and 12p11-p12 in this YAC. The absence of the tarbp2 gene in other YACs mapped in 12q12-q13 supports this hypothesis (Fig. 1B). This YAC has probably the entire gene sequence because the 3.4-, 2.1-, and 1.5-kbEcoRI bands have been attributed to the gene (3Duarte M. Graham K. Daher A. Battisti P.-L. Bannwarth S. Segeral E. Jeang K.-T. Gatignol A. J. Biomed. Sci. 2000; 6: 494-506Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 22Kozak C. Gatignol A. Graham K. Jeang K.-T. McBride O. Genomics. 1995; 25: 66-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). PCR analysis of YAC 791E7 and the human genomic DNA revealed the presence of at least eight introns that were identical to those identified after the release from large scale sequencing of the human genome. This release revealed the presence of sequences identical to TRBP1 and TRBP2 cDNAs (GenBankTM accession number AC023509). From these unaligned sequences, a single tarbp2 gene was found in a 10,478-bp fragment, and the sizes of the hybridizing bands as 3271-, 1475-, and 2049-bp EcoRI fragments were confirmed. All introns previously identified from the YAC or genomic DNA were confirmed, and additional introns were identified. From alignments between TRBP1 and TRBP2 cDNAs with the released sequence, 10 exons that matched with either TRBP1 cDNAs, TRBP2 cDNAs, or both were identified. The unique sequences identified previously in TRBP1 and TRBP2 cDNAs were found in separated locations. We also identified a GC-rich region (258 nucleotides) that has 96% homology with a human CpG island in the region located 5′ from the cDNA sequences (Fig.2A). CpG island sequences are present in promoter regions of numerous genes and are associated with most housekeeping genes as well as some tissue-specific genes in the mammalian genome (29Antequera F. Bird A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11995-11999Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar). The sequence analysis suggested that thetarbp2 promoter might be located in the proximity of the CpG island and upstream from the cDNA start sites. 5′-Terminal ends of TRBP1 and TRBP2 mRNAs have been first determined from cDNA sequences (1Gatignol A. Buckler-White A. Berkhout B. Jeang K.-T. Science. 1991; 251: 1597-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 2Gatignol A. Duarte M. Daviet L. Chang Y.-N. Jeang K.-T. Gene Expr. 1996; 5: 217-228PubMed Google Scholar) and extended after PCR cloning of additional sequences from a cDNA library (3Duarte M. Graham K. Daher A. Battisti P.-L. Bannwarth S. Segeral E. Jeang K.-T. Gatignol A. J. Biomed. Sci. 2000; 6: 494-506Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Because libraries do not always reflect the exact 5′ ends, we performed primer extension analysis using Jurkat total RNA and four different primers to determine the precise 5′ extremity of TRBP1 and TRBP2. Primers were chosen to be either common for both mRNAs (primer A and B in exon 3) or specific for TRBP2 (primers C and D in exon 2; Fig.2A). Primers A and B located in exon 3 gave rise to major bands at 192 and 140 bp, respectively (Fig. 2B). The smaller band observed with primer A was not reproducible and is probably due to an unspecific stop of reverse transcriptase. The product size difference corresponds to the primer positions in exon 3 and therefore reveals the same mRNA with an expected size difference. Primer extension experiments with primers C and D revealed major products at 144 and 141 bp (Fig. 2B), also indicating that they initiated from a single mRNA. Surprisingly, primers A and B did not give rise to the higher molecular mass bands expected from an extension through exon 2. One explanation for these size products is that primers A and B only extend from exon 3 to exon 1 and reveal TRBP1 mRNA. Primers C and D extend from exon 2 and reveal TRBP2 mRNA with an extended 5′ end terminus. To definitively prove how these mRNAs are generated and to confirm their transcriptional start sites, RT-PCR reactions were performed with different sense primers located in the 5′ region of TRBP1 and TRBP2 (Fig.3A). For each mRNA, PCR reactions were performed with two sense primers located downstream of transcription start site (lanes 1–4 and 7–10for TRBP1 and TRBP2, respectively). The absence of PCR product with sense primers located upstream of each transcription start site (lanes 6 and 12) confirmed the primer extension results. From the sequence of all RT-PCR products, we concluded that TRBP1 mRNA contains exons 1 and 3 and that TRBP2 mRNA contains exons 2 and 3. These data also showed that TRBP1 mRNA is 36 nucleotides longer than previously reported and that TRBP2 mRNA can be extended by an additional 92 nucleotides. To understand why primers A and B did not extend TRBP2 mRNA and to verify whether the 5′ end of the mRNAs can fold into the secondary structure previously observed (3Duarte M. Graham K. Daher A.

The best characterized is the receptor at the neuromuscular junction, with four different subunits in a pentameric array, i.e.(α1)2β1γδ. Less well understood and more diverse are the neuronal nAChRs that assemble in exogenous expression systems with a general composition of (αm)2(βn)3, wherem = 2–6 and n = 2–4, or (α7)5 (2Sargent P.B.

A large variety of ligands bind to such diverse nAChRs via unknown mechanisms. A better understanding of the ligand-binding mechanism would be possible if a suitable three-dimensional structure of nAChR were available. Although cryoelectron microscopic images of nAChR show the spatial arrangement of five subunits of the receptor and some aspects of the ligand-binding pockets (4Unwin N. J. Mol.

Structural comparison among various nAChR ligands is one way of identifying important residues or pharmacophores involved in receptor binding. Unfortunately, varying sizes and physicochemical properties of most nAChR ligands prevent straightforward comparison of their three-dimensional structures. Nevertheless, structural comparison among various α-/αA-conotoxins is possible even though comparison has been limited because of the differences in the disulfide framework (13Han K.-H. Hwang K.-J.

Here, we report a high resolution NMR structure of α-conotoxin EI, an α4/7 subfamily member with a unique α1/δ specificity toward Torpedoneuromuscular nAChR (14Martinez J.S. Olivera B.M. Gray W.R. Craig A.G. Groebe D.R. Abramson S.N. McIntosh J.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14519-14526Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). With the structure of α-conotoxin EI we now have the high resolution structures of α-conotoxins that display four different types of nAChR selectivity (α1/γ, α1/δ, α3/β2, and α3/β4; Table I). Structural comparison among these toxins may provide a better understanding of molecular features within α-conotoxins that confer receptor subtype specificity. α-Conotoxin EI, originally purified from the venom of Conus ermineus, was synthesized and purified as described previously (14Martinez J.S. Olivera B.M. Gray W.R. Craig A.G. Groebe D.R. Abramson S.N. McIntosh J.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14519-14526Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Samples for the NMR studies were prepared in 90% H2O/10% 2H2O or in 100%2H2O with a final concentration of ∼5 mm at pH 4.3. The pH was measured as a direct reading from a combination microelectrode calibrated at two reference pHs. All NMR experiments were performed using a Varian UNITY 500 or UNITY INOVA 600 spectrometer at three temperatures to obtain unambiguous resonance assignment. For TOCSY experiments (35Griesinger C. Otting G. Wüthrich K. Ernst R.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1988; 110: 7870-7872Crossref Scopus (1199) Google Scholar), mixing times of 70–85 ms were applied. All peaks were referenced to a residual water signal (4.76 ppm at 25 °C). Spectral widths were 6 kHz in both dimensions. Typical two-dimensional data consist of 2048 complex points in thet2 dimension with 256 complext1 increments. Interproton distance restraints used for computation of structures were derived primarily from the nuclear Overhauser enhancement (NOE) spectroscopy spectrum recorded with a mixing time of 200 ms obtained at 4 °C. The FELIX program in the NMR Refine module of Biosym 95.0 software (Molecular Simulations Inc., San Diego, CA) was used for quantification of NOE volumes and for converting them into interproton distance restraints. As a distance reference, the NOE volumes of four nonoverlapping geminal β-proton cross-peaks were averaged and correlated with the appropriate geminal distance of 1.8 Å. Volume integration errors and the influence of possible conformational averaging were taken into consideration by adding 0.5 and 1.0 Å to distance restraints involving only backbone protons and to those containing at least one side chain proton, respectively (36Wüthrich K. Billeter M. Braun W. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 169: 949-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (1007) Google Scholar). The actual computation of structures was done in two major steps. The first step involved generation of 50 low resolution structures using the DGII calculation based on the metric matrix method (Molecular Simulations Inc., San Diego, CA). To refine the initial distance restraints and to obtain more accurate distance restraints, for example, by correcting for spin diffusion effect the RANDMARDI program (37Liu H. Sielmann H.P. Ulyanov N.B. Wemmer D.E. James T.L. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 390-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) was run for the structures generated by DGII. The final restraint set included a total of 278 restraints, 240 of which were NOE-derived distance restraints that in turn was composed of 129 intraresidue distances, 94 short range (‖i −j‖ < 5) and 17 long range (‖i −j‖ >5) inter-residue distances. Also included in the restraint file were 10 torsion angle restraints along with 21 chirality and six disulfide bond constraints. Backbone torsion angle φ was set to −120° (± 30°) when 3JHNHα > 8 Hz and to −60° (± 30°) when 3JHNHα < 6 Hz. The second step was refinement of the DGII-generated structures by restrained molecular dynamics (38Clore G.M. Sukumaran D.K. Nilges M. Gronenborn A.M. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 1732-1745Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar), done in a biphasic manner such that distance restraints associated with the backbone conformation were applied during the first 22 ps of dynamics at 1000 K, followed by application of the rest of distance restraints. Each dynamics run lasted for 84 or 52 ps at 1000 K and 32 ps of annealing period down to 100 K, finally followed by a short energy minimization using a conjugate gradient method. Force constants for the NOE restraints and for torsion angles were gradually increased to the final value of 30 kcal/mol. Complete 1H resonance assignment for α-conotoxin EI was achieved using homonuclear two-dimensional NMR methods according to the standard sequential resonance assignment strategy (39Billeter M. Braun W. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 155: 321-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). Because of their unique “back-transfer” cross-peaks, unambiguous assignment of His7 and Arg1 was possible using a TOCSY spectrum without relying on the NOE connectivity information. Also, Hyp3, Thr9, Ser13, and Ile17 were assigned based only on the shift correlation spectroscopy and TOCSY spectra following their characteristic coherence transfer patterns. For other residues, classification of spin systems in a TOCSY spectrum along amide NH resonances preceded the sequential resonance assignment procedure. Strong sequential dαδ type NOE cross-peaks representing interproton distances of less than 2.5 Å were clearly observed for three prolines (Hyp3, Pro8, and Pro15), indicating that they are in transconfiguration (40Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1986: 122-125Google Scholar). The ε-CH3 of Met12 was found as a sharp singlet at 2.05 ppm in one-dimensional 1H spectrum. Because of trans-cis isomerization of prolines, minor peaks originating from a cis-conformer were noted. Similar cis conformers have been observed in other α-/αA-conotoxins as well (13Han K.-H.

Methods Enzymol. 1994; 239: 363-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (939) Google Scholar) along the amino acid sequence of α-conotoxin EI. Fig.2 shows the ensemble of 20 final converged structures of α-conotoxin EI with the N terminus at theupper left corner and the C terminus at the upper right corner. The overall dimension of the “ω” shaped α-conotoxin EI is ∼15 Å (height) × 15 Å (width) × 12 Å (thickness). The bottom of the ω fold is composed of an α-helix involving residues Pro8–Ser13 as judged by the STRIDE secondary structure analysis algorithm (43Eisenhaber F. Lijzaad P. Argos P. Sander C. Scharf M. J. Comput. Chem. 1995; 16: 273-284Crossref Scopus (703) Google Scholar). The α-helix at the bottom of the molecule is a common structural feature of the α4/7 subfamily. In addition, a short 310 helix formed by residues Hyp3–Tyr6 is found in α-conotoxin EI. The C-terminal arm of the ω fold contains a type IV β-turn involving residues Asn14–Ile17. TableII shows the structure determination statistics. The average root mean square deviation values for backbone and heavy atoms within the ensemble are 0.355 and 0.715 Å, respectively. The quality of structures can also be inferred from the two R factors (44Thomas P.D. Basus V.J. James T.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1237-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), Ra = 0.559 andRb = 0.138, that were calculated using CORMA (45Borgias B.A. James T.L. J. Mag. Res. 1988; 79: 493-512Google Scholar). Also, when the final structures were subject to quality evaluation by PROCHECK (46Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar), 77.3% of the residues were found to belong to the most favorable region of the Ramachandran plot. Although the overall topology of the current high resolution structure of α-conotoxin EI appears to be similar to that of the previous low resolution structure of α-conotoxin EI (47Franco A. Mari F. Lett. Pept. Sci. 1999; 6: 199-207Google Scholar), detailed comparison cannot be made because the spatial coordinates are not available.Table IINMR structure determination statistics of α-conotoxin EI for an ensemble of 20 structuresRMS deviations from experimental restraints Interproton distances (Å)0.1326 Torsion angle violation (deg)0.5555Ramachandran plot statistics Residues in most favored region (%)77.3 Residues in additionally allowed region (%)22.7 Residues in generously allowed region (%)0.0 Residues in disallowed region (%)0.0Ensemble R factors2-aRa andRb values are computed as defined in Ref.44.

Open table in a new tab Values where applicable are the means ± S.D. All neuromuscular conotoxins known to date belong either to the α3/5 subfamily or to the αA subfamily (Table I). Interestingly, α-conotoxin EI belongs to neither of the two but targets neuromuscular nAChR. In Fig. 3two neuromuscular α-conotoxins, GI (18Guddat L.W. Martin J.A. Shan L. Edmunson A.B. Gray W.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11329-11335Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and EI, are superimposed along the possible α1-subunit-binding face (27Mok K.H. Han K.H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11895-11904Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 48Bren N Sine S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12692-12700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). We have used α-conotoxin GI as a representative of the α3/5 conotoxins because high resolution structures of other neuromuscular α3/5 conotoxins such as MI (19Hu S.-H. Gehrmann J. Guddat L.W. Alewood P.F. Craik D.J. Martin J.L. Structure. 1996; 4: 417-423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and CnIA (24Maslennikov I.V. Shenkarev Z.O. Zhmak M.N. Ivanov V.T. Methfessel C. Tsetlin V.I. Arseniv A.S. FEBS Lett. 1999; 444: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) are essentially the same as that of α-conotoxin GI. Large structural differences are observed between the second disulfide loops of the two, suggesting that γ or δ subunit specificity of these neuromuscular toxins resides within their second disulfide loops. The mammalian δ-subunit recognition was shown to be mediated by Tyr12 in the second loop of α-conotoxin MI (47Franco A. Mari F. Lett. Pept. Sci. 1999; 6: 199-207Google Scholar). Structural superposition of α-conotoxin EI with other α4/7 subfamily members can be made along their common disulfide framework. Shown in Fig. 4 is the superimposition of six α4/7 conotoxins, EI (purple), MII (blue), PnIA (yellow), PnIB (orange), AuIB (pink), and EpI (red). For MII, two high resolution NMR structures are available: one determined in aqueous solution (22Shon K.-J. Koerber S.C. Rivier J.E. Olivera B.M. McIntosh J.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15693-15700Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and the other determined in 30% TFE (49Hill J.M. Oomen C.J. Miranda L.P. Bingham J.-P. Alewood P.F. Craik D.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15621-15630Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Here, we have used the former because the structures of other α4/7 conotoxins were determined in aqueous solution. It is remarkable that the backbone root mean square deviations among the six α4/7 subfamily members are less than 1.0 Å. The fact that the backbone topology of these α4/7 conotoxins is virtually the same suggests that differences in the receptor subtype specificities among these toxins are likely to be mediated by differences in the surface charge and size of the side chains (34Cho J. Mok K.H. Olivera B.M. McIntosh J.M. Park K.H. Han K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8680-8685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 47Franco A. Mari F. Lett. Pept. Sci. 1999; 6: 199-207Google Scholar, 50Luo S. Nguyen T.A. Cartier G.E. Olivera B.M. Yoshikami D. McIntosh J.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14542-14548Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Figs. 3 and 4 show that all α-conotoxins can be accommodated within a rectangular cube of 20 Å (height) × 20 Å (width) × 15 Å (thickness). The x-ray structure of acetylcholinesterase contains a ligand-binding pocket with a similar size (51Sussman J.L. Harel M. Frolow F. Oefner C. Goldman A. Toker L. Silman I. Science. 1991; 253: 872-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (2440) Google Scholar). The depth of the ligand-binding pocket in nAChR is likely to be slightly deeper than 20 Å because αA-conotoxins also have to bind to the same ligand-binding pocket as α-conotoxins. α-Bungarotoxin is much larger than the proposed ligand-binding pocket. However, the loop II in this snake toxin containing important receptor-binding residues has an approximate dimension of 12 Å (width) × 10 Å (height) × 8 Å (thickness) (52Rosenthal J.A. Levandoski M.M. Chang B. Potts J.F. Shi Q-L. Hawrot E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7847-7855Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) that hence would be able to reach into the ligand-binding pocket. The 10th residue in the α4/7 subfamily, such as Leu10 of α-conotoxin PnIB or Ala10 of α-conotoxin PnIA, has been shown to be important in discriminating between different neuronal nAChR subtypes (50Luo S. Nguyen T.A. Cartier G.E. Olivera B.M. Yoshikami D. McIntosh J.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14542-14548Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 53Quiram P.A. McIntosh J.M. Sine S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4889-4896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In α-conotoxin EI Met12 occupies the same three-dimensional position as Ala10 in α-conotoxin PnIA and Leu10 in α-conotoxin PnIB (Table I). Proper understanding of ligand-nAChR interactions would require precise knowledge of which amino acid residues or pharmacophores are involved in ligand-receptor binding as well as how such residues are arranged in the three-dimensional space. Many important ligand-binding residues within nAChR have been identified. However, little is known about the spatial arrangement of such nAChR residues (Table I). On the other hand, knowledge of relative spatial orientations of important receptor-binding pharmacophores in various ligands can be obtained from high resolution three-dimensional structures of several nAChR ligands (13Han K.-H. Hwang K.-J. Kim S.-M. Kim S.-K. Gray W.R. Olivera B.M. Rivier J. Shon K.-J.

For example, one could deduce or “reverse map” plausible ligand-receptor contacts, as has been demonstrated in the case of quaternary ligands (54Fraenkel Y. Shalev D.E. Gershoni J.M. Navon G. CRC Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1996; 31: 273-301Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar), based upon correlation between characteristic physicochemical parameters as well as relative geometrical orientations of pharmacophores in ligands and nature of critical ligand-binding residues in nAChR. The first step of such a reverse mapping strategy involves determination of accurate three-dimensional structures for a sufficient number of ligands having comparable three-dimensional structures but possessing either similar or contrasting receptor binding properties (13Han K.-H.

Next, information on possible receptor subtype-specific pharmacophores in each ligand gathered by structural comparison is correlated with the results of biochemical studies such as site-specific mutational studies. This strategy is suitable for studying interactions of nAChR with α-/αA-conotoxins because a sufficient number of three-dimensional structures for these peptide toxins are available now (Table I). We have used this method to locate a possible α1-subunit binding face within neuromuscular α-/αA-conotoxins (27Mok K.H. Han K.H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11895-11904Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and to delineate potential receptor subtype-specific residues in α-conotoxin MII (34Cho J. Mok K.H. Olivera B.M.

In the present investigation we have continued our effort to delineate receptor subtype-specific residues in α-conotoxins by first determining a high resolution three-dimensional structure of α-conotoxin EI and then by comparing it with other α-conotoxins. In particular, the structure of α-conotoxin EI has served as a critical structural template for superposition of the neuromuscular α3/5 subfamily toxins with neuronal α4/7 subfamily members. We have found that most of the second loop residues in α-conotoxin EI are fully surface exposed when compared with α-conotoxin GI, and some of these exposed residues might be important for receptor binding. It is interesting to note that both our structural approach (27Mok K.H. Han K.H.

To determine whether professional antigen-presenting cells die in SILs, we assayed for the apoptosis of immature dendritic cells (DC) in organotypic cultures of HPV-transformed keratinocytes, which reproduce many features of in vivo observed SILs. Unexpectedly, the infiltration of organotypic cultures by DC specifically induced the apoptosis of HPV+ tumor cells, whereas DC were not affected. In the same conditions and in coculture experiments, apoptosis was not observed in normal keratinocytes. The induction of apoptosis required membrane contacts between DC and HPV-transformed keratinocytes. Although the HPV+cell lines were sensitive to the effects of TRAIL, soluble TRAILR2-Fc did not block the DC-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, although FasL and Fas were detected on DC and HPV+ cell lines, respectively, functional analysis revealed that this pathway is not responsible for the apoptosis induced by the DC. All together these results suggest that DC may be at the interface between innate and adaptive immunity by inducing the apoptosis of (pre)neoplastic cells."

The present study aimed to define a monovalent carrier for the IgE mimotopes to induce protective antibodies directed to the IgE epitopes, suitable for mimotope-specific therapy. We expressed the selected mimotopes as fusion proteins together with streptococcal albumin binding protein (ABP). The fusion proteins were recognized specifically by anti-Bet v 1 human IgE, which demonstrated that the mimotopes fused to ABP resemble the natural IgE epitope. Bet v 1-specific IgG was induced by immunization of BALB/c mice with fusion proteins. These IgG antibodies could inhibit IgE binding to Bet v 1. Skin testing of Bet v 1 allergic mice showed that the ABP mimotope constructs did not elicit type I skin reactions, although they possess IgE binding structures. Our data suggest that IgE mimotopes are safe for epitope-specific immunotherapy of sensitized individuals, when presented in a monovalent form. Therefore, ABP-fused mimotopes are promising candidates for a new type of immunotherapy based on the precise induction of blocking antibodies."

https://openalex.org/W2149569392,"Although ischemia reperfusion has been shown to depress gene expression of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) proteins, such as the ryanodine receptor, Ca2+-pump ATPase, phospholamban, and calsequestrin in the heart, the mechanisms of these changes are not understood. Given the occurrence of hypoxia and the lack of glucose during the ischemic phase, we investigated the effects of these factors on the cardiac SR gene expression. Isolated rat hearts perfused in the absence of oxygen and/or glucose for 30 min showed an increase in the expression of SR genes. However, perfusion of hearts for 60 min with normal oxygenated medium after 30 min of lack of both oxygen and glucose depressed the transcript levels for the SR proteins; these changes did not occur when hearts were deprived of either oxygen or glucose. The effect of intracellular Ca2+-overload, which occurs during reperfusion, was studied by using hearts perfused for 5 min with Ca2+-free medium and then reperfused for 30 min. Ca2+-depletion/repletion induced a dramatic decrease in the transcript levels of the SR genes. These results suggest that the lack of both oxygen and glucose during ischemia are necessary for reperfusion-induced depression in SR gene expression, possibly due to the occurrence of intracellular Ca2+-overload."

Among these molecular events, the mechanism that controls the proliferation of antigen-specific B cells in the specified area of GCs remains undetermined and is a particularly important issue.

GANP protein is hardly detectable in normal lymphoid tissues and organs but is up-regulated in GCs of antigen-immunized spleen and lymph nodes. GANP protein levels are nearly undetectable in resting primary spleen cells but are induced markedly by stimulation with anti-IgM Ab plus anti-CD40 monoclonal antibody (15Kuwahara K. Yoshida M.

The MCM complex required for DNA replication is composed of at least six identified components known as MCM2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7; some of which are phosphorylated during cell cycling (23Lei M. Kawasaki Y. Young M.R. Kihara M. Sugino A. Tye B.K. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3365-3374Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 24Tanaka T. Knapp D. Nasmyth K.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5703-5713Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). GANP also bears a DNA primase activity that is inducible by phosphorylation of Ser502 of GANP (17Kuwahara K. Tomiyasu S. Fujimura S. Nomura K. Xing Y. Nishiyama N. Ogawa M. Imajoh-Ohmi S. Izuta S. Sakaguchi N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U S A. 2001; 98: 10279-10283Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The findings regarding the structure and associated components of GANP suggest a role for GANP in the proliferation and DNA replication of lymphoid lineage cells. The up-regulation of GANP appears selectively in B cells stimulated with anti-CD40 mAb in vitro or in GC-B cells stimulated with T cell-dependent antigen in vivo, but it does not appear in the T cell area of GCs. These observations imply the selective up-regulation of GANP expression in B lineage cells undergoing maturation and differentiation into Ab-secreting cells for T cell-dependent antigens. The stage-associated expression of DNA primase GANP might be involved in maturation of antigen-driven B cells in secondary lymphoid follicles. To understand the molecular mechanism that regulates the selective up-regulation of GANP, we isolated a genomic DNA clone carrying the 5′-flanking region adjacent to the first exon of ganp. Using a luciferase assay with DNA-transfected cells, we studied the promoter element required for the expression of the ganp gene. The results demonstrated that a 737-bp 5′-flanking region of theganp gene is responsible for selective up-regulation in GC-B cells. To isolate the 5′-flanking region of the ganp gene, a BALB/c mouse genomic library in the EMBL-3 vector was screened according to a standard procedure (26Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) with Escherichia coli strain K802. Briefly, ∼106 phage clones were screened with the 5′-end of the ganp cDNA (1.1-kbBam HI-Asp 718 fragment) radiolabeled probe. Four independent clones named λG-2/3, λG-16, λG-23, and λG-25 were selected and analyzed with the restriction endonucleasesBam HI, Hin dIII, Eco RI,Nd eI, Xba I, and Sac I and were compared with BALB/c liver genomic DNA. Appropriate genomic DNA fragments recovered from the longest phage clone λG-25 (∼17 kb) were subcloned in the vector pBluescript II KS(+) (pBS) and partially sequenced. By comparing genomic and cDNA sequence data, we identified a 6.38-kb flanking region as the putative promoter region, which extends from the Xba I site (in the middle of exon I) to the Eco RI site further upstream. A 1.38-kb Eco RI-Xba I fragment was subcloned and designated as pBS/1.38-kb and pUC19/1.38-kb. To analyze the ganp promoter activity, a series of 5′-deleted fragments of the putative ganp promoter region were generated by subcloning using standard restriction enzymes and PCR methods and named according to sizes relative to the major transcription start site (designated as +1). All genomic fragments were inserted at cloning sites of the promoterless/enhancerless luciferase reporter vector pGV-B (Toyo Ink Mfg., Tokyo, Japan) upstream from the luciferase gene. The −737-bp, −637-bp, −397-bp, and −264-bp fragments were introduced. The ganp promoter fragments of −168, −134, −108, and −54 bp were generated by PCR using the 1.38-kb DNA fragment as a template. All inserted genomic DNA fragments representing the 5′-flanking sequence, extending varying distances upstream from the major transcription start site (designated as +1), were confirmed by restriction enzyme digestion and sequencing to verify proper insertion and orientation. The pGV-P construct in which the luciferase gene is regulated by the SV40 early promoter (PicaGene, Toyo Ink Mfg.) and the pSV-β-galactosidase construct (Promega, Madison, WI) in which the β-galactosidase gene is controlled by the SV40 promoter and enhancer were used in the transient transfection experiment as a positive control (to measure the maximum reporter gene activity) and as an internal control (to normalize the transfection efficiency). Mutations in the PU.1 site were generated using oligonucleotide primers carrying point mutations. The nucleotides 5′-GGAA-3′, which are critical for PU.1 binding, were changed into 5′-AATT-3′ as indicated by the underlined sequence in the primers shown below. Mutant luciferase constructs were generated by PCR and were confirmed by sequencing. The primers used were: −134-bp PU.1MutF, 5′-GGGAGCTCGAGAGCCAATTGCCGGA-3′ and −134-bp PU.1MutR, 5′-GGCAAT TGGTCTCTGGGGTG-3′. For the construct of the −264-bp PU.1Mut, the DNA fragment of −134-bp PU.1Mut was joined to the construct through a subcloning procedure. CD72 probe was prepared as 5′-GACCTTCTTCCTCTTTTATGACTT-3′ according to the previous report (27Ying H. Chang J. Parnes J. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 2287-2296PubMed Google Scholar). Underlining indicates the PU.1 binding site with opposite orientation. The mouse lymphoid cell lines pre-B cell (70Z/3, 18-81), mature B cell (A20, BAL17), plasma cell (X63, SP2/0), and thymus T cell (BW5147, EL-4) were as described previously (28Sakaguchi N.

They were maintained in a complete RPMI 1640 culture medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Dainippon Pharmaceutical, Osaka, Japan), 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 100 units/ml penicillin, 2 mml-glutamine (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD), and 50 mm 2-mercaptoethanol at 37 °C in a 5% CO2incubator. The mature B cells, A20, were transfected as described below and then stimulated with anti-CD40 mAb (LB429, 10 μg/ml). Nuclear extracts were prepared from lymphoid cells as described previously (29Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G.

Transfection of all cell lines was conducted by electroporation using the Bio-Rad Gene Pulser II (Bio-Rad). Cells (1 × 107) were harvested and resuspended in 0.5 ml of the complete culture medium. Equimolar amounts of plasmids were added relative to 10 μg of the pGV-B luciferase reporter construct. One microgram of pSV-β-galactosidase construct was added as an internal control for the transfection efficiency. Cells were incubated with DNA for 5 min at room temperature in a 0.4-cm cuvette and then electroporated at 950 microfarads with 280 V (70Z/3), 300 V (A20), 270 V (X63), or 320 V (BW5147). After 5 min at room temperature, cells were transferred to culture dishes containing 10 ml of the complete culture medium and incubated at 37 °C for 48 h. Luciferase assay was performed using a luciferase assay kit (PicaGene) as described (30Maeda K. Inui S. Sanjo H. Sakaguchi N. Gene. 1998; 210: 287-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested, and protein extracts were prepared for luciferase and β-galactosidase assays. Luciferase activities were normalized against the β-galactosidase activities for transfection efficiency as described previously (30Maeda K. Inui S. Sanjo H. Sakaguchi N.

Each transfection was repeated at least six times (three times in duplicate) using three preparations of DNA, and representative data are shown.

Results are presented as a fold increase in luciferase activity relative to a control transfection without stimulation (assigned a value of 1).

The double strand probes were radiolabeled with [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences) by T4 polynucleotide kinase and purified through a Sephadex G-50 column. For the binding reaction, 15 μg of the nuclear extract, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) as a nonspecific competitor, and 0.5 ng (∼1 × 104 cpm) of the labeled probe were mixed in a buffer (total volume, 20 μl) containing 20 mm Hepes pH 7.9, 15% glycerol, 300 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 50 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol. Otherwise stated, binding reaction mixtures were incubated for 10 min at room temperature with a molar excess of the unlabeled nucleotide probe as a specific competitor for the labeled probe. Binding reactions were carried out for an additional 20 min at room temperature and were analyzed on 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels containing 2.5% glycerol for 2 h at 150 V and 4 °C after prerunning for 1 h at 100 V (31Moreau-Gachelin F.

For Ab inhibition, 4 μl of Ab against the DNA-binding domain of PU.1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added to the binding reaction mixture for 15 min prior to the addition of the labeled probe. A DNA primer (5′-TCCGCCAGATACGGCCACTGTC-3′) complementary to mouse ganp sequence nucleotides from +42 to +21 was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (2 × 105 cpm) and mixed with 4 μg of poly(A)+ RNA extracted from the myeloma cell line SP2/0. After being denatured at 80 °C for 4 min and then annealed for 2 h at 50 °C, reverse transcription reaction was performed in a total volume of 50 μl by adding the primer-RNA hybrids (10 μl) to 40 μl of 1.25 × reverse transcription buffer containing 1.25 mm each of dNTP, 12.5 mmdithiothreitol, 12.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.4), 7.5 mm MgCl2, 40 units of the avian myeloblastosis virus (AMV) reverse transcriptase, and 40 units of RNasin for 30 min at 42 °C. The extended product was analyzed on a 6% sequencing gel in parallel with a sequencing reaction of the genomic DNA. To study the mechanism of GC-associated ganp expression, we isolated DNA clones from the EMBL3 genomic DNA library of C57BL/6 with the mouse ganp cDNA probe (15Kuwahara K. Yoshida M. Kondo E. Sakata A. Watanabe Y. Abe E. Kouno Y. Tomiyasu S. Fujimura S. Tokuhisa T. Kimura H. Ezaki T. Sakaguchi N. Blood. 2000; 95: 2321-2328Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A clone (λg-25) carrying the terminal 5′ region was analyzed by subcloning (Figs. 1 A and 2), and the 1.39-kb region was sequenced (EMBL accession number AJ318088). Previously, we determined the longest 5′ end of the mouseganp cDNA by the 5′-RACE method (15Kuwahara K. Yoshida M. Kondo E. Sakata A. Watanabe Y. Abe E. Kouno Y. Tomiyasu S. Fujimura S. Tokuhisa T. Kimura H. Ezaki T. Sakaguchi N. Blood. 2000; 95: 2321-2328Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the transcription initiation site of the mouse ganp gene, we performed primer extension analysis and identified one major transcription start site (Fig. 1, A and B) and two other minor sites (data not shown). One of two minor sites was identified as the longest 5′ site by the 5′-RACE method (15Kuwahara K. Yoshida M. Kondo E. Sakata A. Watanabe Y. Abe E. Kouno Y. Tomiyasu S. Fujimura S. Tokuhisa T. Kimura H. Ezaki T. Sakaguchi N. Blood. 2000; 95: 2321-2328Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Based on these findings, we tentatively concluded the major initiation site of the mouse ganp gene (as indicated by +1 in Fig. 1,A and B). In the region from −400 bp to the major transcription site, significant similarities were found to the consensus sequences of E2F (at −357), E-box (at −333), BSAP (at −235), PU.1 (at −126), and an initiator-like sequence (at −61). In addition, an obvious canonical TATAA or CCAAT box is not found in the 5′-flanking region of theganp gene. The function of the putative promoter region was analyzed using the reporter construct containing the DNA fragment from −737 bp to +1 and the transfection into cell lines representing various stages as pre-B (70Z/3), mature B (A20), plasma (X63), and T lineage cells (BW5147). This region showed a high promoter activity in mature B and plasma cells as A20 (71-fold) and X63 (68-fold) over the background conferred by the control luciferase vector but showed low activities in 70Z/3 (6-fold) and BW5147 (11.5-fold) (Fig. 2). Using all of the constructs, similar differential expression was obtained in another set of representative cell lines as pre-B (18-81), B (BAL17), and T cells (EL-4) (data not shown). Further truncation of the promoter region demonstrated that the region from −264 to −168 bp is involved in the stage-dependent regulation of ganp expression in comparison with the reporter construct of −168 bp. The deletion of this element resulted in a decrease in A20 (from 42- to 31-fold), but a slight increase in X63 (from 45- to 48-fold) and BW5147 (from 8- to 9-fold) (Fig. 2), suggesting a more complex regulation of this region in various differentiated cells. Additionally, the deletion from −134 to −108 bp caused a more marked decrease in A20 (from 39- to 19-fold) and X63 (from 48- to 16-fold) but again only a small increase in BW5147 (from 8- to 6-fold) and 70Z/3 (from 2- to 1-fold). Truncation of the promoter region to −54 bp significantly decreased the promoter activity to a background level comparable with all cell lines tested. In addition, the construct with the reverse orientation of the −134-bp region did not show any promoter activity (data not shown). The data presented here clearly suggest that the 5′-flanking region up to −737 bp is partly involved in the B lineage-associated and stage-dependent expression of the ganp gene. To explore lineage-associated regulatory molecules involved in ganp expression, we conducted a series of EMSAs using radiolabeled oligonucleotides and nuclear protein extracts from the cell lines characterized above. Initially, we generated six oligo probes covering the entire region from −264 to −108 bp (Fig.1 A) and analyzed the DNA-protein interaction by EMSA. Because the region (−134 to −108 bp) seems to be involved significantly in promoter activity and contains a consensus binding site for the transcription factor PU.1, we characterized the involvement of PU.1 as a DNA-binding protein in the regulation ofganp expression using A20 and X63 cells expressingPU.1 mRNA (32Nelsen B. Tian G. Erman B. Gregoire J. Maki R. Graves B. Sen R. Science. 1993; 261: 82-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The oligo 8 probe detected two bands, one of which seemed to be nonspecific because the cold probe could not efficiently inhibit its formation (Fig.3 A, lower band). The complex GB-1, detected with oligo 8 covering the PU.1 consensus site (5′-GCGGAA-3′), could be inhibited by the cold 15-nucleotide probe( oligo 9) containing the same PU.1 consensus site (Fig.3 A, upper band). The GB-1 complex is not detected by the 15-nucleotide probe with the mutation at the PU.1 site (oligo 9Mut M1 and M2)(Fig. 3 B), but the GB-1 complex, which is detected by the oligo 8 probe containing the consensus PU.1 site, could not be inhibited by the cold probe with the mutation at the PU.1 site. The GB-1 complex was clearly inhibited by the cold probe with a known PU.1 consensus site at the promoter region of CD72 (27Ying H. Chang J. Parnes J. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 2287-2296PubMed Google Scholar) as a specific competitor, suggesting that the GB-1 complex contains the PU.1 protein (Fig. 3 C). We also examined whether the formation of a GB-1 complex is affected by the addition of anti-PU.1 Ab. Specific Ab may cause a shift of the complex at the lower migration site on EMSA or the disappearance from the gel by the inhibition of complex formation. The anti-PU.1 Ab used here showed rather an inhibition of the formation of the complex, indicating that the complex formed with the oligo 8 sequence contains in part PU.1 protein (Fig. 3 C). These results narrowed down the sequence element to the motif of the PU.1 consensus site. The contribution of the region with the PU.1 consensus element to the function of the ganp promoter activity was obviously significant (Fig. 2). The lack of this element in a reporter construct (from −134 to −108 bp) caused decreases of 51% (A20), 64% (X63), 55% (70Z/3), and 18% (BW5147) in the reporter gene activity. Collectively, these data suggest that the sequence element corresponding to the PU.1 consensus site is responsible for positive regulation of ganp promoter activity. To determine the role of PU.1 in the regulation of ganp expression, we transfected the PU.1 expression construct together with a reporter construct containing the PU.1 site (−134/PU.1WT) or a construct harboring a mutation in the PU.1 site (−134/PU.1Mut). PU.1 mRNA is expressed in B lineage cells (70Z/3, A20, and X63) but not in the T cell line BW5147 (32Nelsen B. Tian G. Erman B. Gregoire J. Maki R. Graves B. Sen R. Science. 1993; 261: 82-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), which was also confirmed before these experiments (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 4, the mutation introduced into the PU.1 binding site resulted in a decrease of reporter activity in A20 and in X63. This finding indicates that the PU.1 binding site is involved in the regulation of ganp promoter activity. To investigate whether PU.1 protein is involved in the regulation of reporter activity, we introduced the cDNA construct that produces PU.1 protein in the transfectants. Introduction of PU.1 cDNA caused enhancement in reporter activity in a dose-dependent manner from 1 to 8 μg in A20 and X63 cells (Fig. 4). The mutation at the PU.1 site abolished the potential for enhancement in reporter activity even with the highest concentration of 8 μg. The longer construct (−264 bp) carrying more motifs (Fig. 1) showed a similar enhancement in reporter activity in response to the exogenousPU.1 introduction, but the activity was much higher than that of the shorter construct (Fig. 5). The negative effect of the mutation was not apparent in B cells presumably because of the much enhanced activity or the cooperative regulation by the other elements in the longer construct; however, the mutant construct at the consensus PU.1 site could not augment the reporter gene activity in response to PU.1 introduction (8 μg). These results indicate that PU.1 is involved in the regulation of ganp gene expression through the PU.1 site (at −126 bp). GANP protein expression in resting primary spleen cells are markedly increased by treatment with anti-CD40 mAb (15Kuwahara K. Yoshida M. Kondo E. Sakata A. Watanabe Y. Abe E. Kouno Y. Tomiyasu S.

Because the ganp promoter potentially regulates the B cell by stimulation in vitro with anti-CD40 mAb, we examined whether this promoter region with the PU.1 site is a target of anti-CD40 signaling. We compared the reporter activity of a promoter construct (−134 and −264 bp) with or without the PU.1 element in A20 cells after stimulation (Fig. 6). Based on nonstimulated controls, anti-CD40 mAb significantly induced the luciferase activity by about 100%. The mutants of the PU.1 site could not show the u"

In cows, the ability of neutrophils to kill immunoglobulin-opsonized microorganisms appears to depend largely on this subclass, whose interaction with bFcγ2R initiates the killing process. bFcγ2R is a transmembrane glycoprotein consisting of two extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains, followed by a 19-amino acid membrane-spanning region and a short cytoplasmic tail. Although related to other mammalian FcγRs, bFcγ2R belongs to a novel gene family that includes the human killer cell inhibitory receptor and FcαRI (CD89) proteins. We have shown previously (Morton, H. C., van Zandbergen, G., van Kooten, C., Howard, C. J., van de Winkel, J. G., and Brandtzaeg, P. (1999) J. Exp. Med. 189, 1715–1722) that like these proteins (and unlike other FcγRs), bFcγ2R binds bIgG2 via the membrane-distal extracellular domain 1 (EC1). In this present study, we introduced mutations into the predicted loop regions of the EC1 domain and assayed the resulting bFcγ2R mutants for their ability to bind bIgG2. Our results indicated that the bIgG2 binding site lies within the predicted F–G loop region of the EC1 domain. Furthermore, single amino acid mutational analysis of this region identified Phe-82 and Trp-87 as being critical for bIgG2 binding.

Cross-linking of FcRs by Ig-containing immune complexes triggers a wide variety of effector mechanisms such as phagocytosis, antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, and release of cytokines and other mediators of inflammation (1Ravetch J.V.

Cattle possess four Cγ genes (one of which is a pseudogene) giving rise to the expression of three subclasses of bIgG (bIgG1, bIgG2, and bIgG3) (3Butler J.E. Vet. Immunol. Immunopathol. 1983; 4: 43-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 4Butler J.E. Heyermann H. Frenyo L.V. Kiernan J. Immunol.

Several bIgG-binding proteins have been isolated, of which three are considered homologues to FcγRI (CD64), FcγRII (CD32), and FcγRIII (CD16) expressed by many other mammalians including humans (7Bianchi A. Butler J.E. Hoorfar J. Howard C. Lind P. Vet. Immunol. Immunopathol. 1996; 54: 25-31Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Symons D.B. Clarkson C.A. Mol.

A homologue of the MHC class I-like FcR, FcRn, which is responsible for maternal transfer of IgG in humans, mice, and rats, is also found in cattle (12Kacskovics I. Wu Z. Simister N.E. Frenyo L.V. Hammarstrom L. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 1889-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In addition, there is a novel type of FcγR specific for bIgG2, termed bFcγ2R (13Zhang G. Young J.R. Tregaskes C.A. Sopp P. Howard C.J. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 1534-1541PubMed Google Scholar). This FcR is genetically more closely related to a novel family of human proteins that includes FcαRI (CD89) and the KIR, monocyte/macrophage Ig-like receptor, and Ig-like transcripts/LIR families of receptors, which all probably arose by a series of duplication events from a single ancestral gene (14Dennis G.J. Kubagawa H. Cooper M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13245-13250Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). To date little is known about the respective roles of the bIgG subclasses and the different cattle FcγRs in the triggering of immune effector functions. In terms of humoral immunity, it has been reported that bIgG1 is a better activator of complement (at least in vitro), which may be linked to the observation that most breeds of cattle have a higher serum concentration of bIgG1 than bIgG2 (3Butler J.E. Vet. Immunol. Immunopathol. 1983; 4: 43-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 15Howard C.J. Brownlie J. Res. Vet. Sci. 1979; 27: 388-389Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, however, when cell-mediated immune reactions were examined in cattle, bIgG2 seemed to perform at least as well as, and sometimes even better than, bIgG1. For example, in an in vitro assay system that measured the ability of bovine macrophages and neutrophils to kill Ig-opsonized Mycoplasma bovis, both isotypes performed equally when macrophages were employed as effector cells. However, when neutrophils were used, only bIgG2 was able to promote effective killing (16Howard C.J. Vet. Immunol. Immunopathol. 1984; 6: 321-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). These results could be explained in part by the observation that bovine monocytes and macrophages express FcγRs for both bIgG isotypes, whereas neutrophils express high numbers of receptors for bIgG2 but few or none for bIgG1 (17Howard C.J. Taylor G. Brownlie J. Res. Vet. Sci. 1980; 29: 128-130Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, although it is still difficult to assess the biological role of the bovine homologues of FcγRI, FcγRII, and FcγRIII, due partly to the lack of specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), it is clear that bIgG2 and its receptor on neutrophils and macrophages, bFcγ2R, is an important triggering molecule for cellular effector functions in cattle. bFcγ2R consists of two extracellular Ig-like domains, followed by a transmembrane region and a short cytoplasmic tail. Uniquely, for an FcγR, bFcγ2R has been shown to bind bIgG2 via its membrane-distal EC1 domain (18Morton H.C. van Zandbergen G. van Kooten C. Howard C.J. van de Winkel J.G. Brandtzaeg P. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1715-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). All other FcγRs so-far characterized bind IgG via the membrane proximal EC2 domain (19Hulett M.D. Hogarth P.M. Adv. Immunol. 1994; 57: 1-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar, 20Raghavan M. Bjorkman P.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 181-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). However, it now appears that ligand binding via the EC1 domain may be a typical characteristic of many other members of the gene family to which bFcγ2R belongs, including CD89, KIR, and LIR-1 (18Morton H.C. van Zandbergen G. van Kooten C.

In this study we have used site-directed mutagenesis to identify regions of the EC1 domain of bFcγ2R involved in the binding of bIgG2. Our results showed that the bIgG2 binding site lies within the putative F–G loop of the EC1 domain. Moreover, Phe-82 and Trp-87 were identified as critical for binding. This site is analogous to the IgA binding site of CD89 and the UL18 binding site of LIR-1 but distinct from the MHC I binding site of the KIRs (21Winter C.C. Long E.O. J.

COS-1 cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (BioWhittaker, Walkserville, MD) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1 mml-glutamine, and 50 g/ml gentamycin (Life Technologies, Inc.). cDNA for bFcγ2R has been described previously (13Zhang G. Young J.R. Tregaskes C.A. Sopp P. Howard C.J. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 1534-1541PubMed Google Scholar). The bFcγ2R mAb CC-G24 (murine IgM) was generated by immunizing mice with bFcγ2R protein purified from bovine leukocytes, and the specificity was confirmed by staining COS-7 cells transfected with cDNA encoding bFcγ2R or bFcγRII. 2C. J. Howard, unpublished data. Mutations were introduced by overlap extension PCR with appropriate synthetic oligonucleotides. In all cases, mutations were introduced into the cDNAs that resulted in the replacement of the amino acid(s) of interest with Ala. The integrity of all mutant cDNAs was confirmed by sequence analysis. Mutant bFcγ2R cDNAs were cloned into the pCDNA3 mammalian expression vector (Invitrogen) prior to transfection. The pCMV-GFP plasmid, which directed the expression of GFP, was constructed by inserting the CMV promoter region from pCDNA3 into the multiple cloning site of the pEGFP-1 vector (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). COS-1 cells were transiently transfected with 1 μg of bFcγ2R cDNA constructs by means of Fugene 6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cells to be used for Ig binding assays were co-transfected with 0.05 μg of the pCMV-GFP plasmid, in addition to the bFcγ2R constructs. Cells were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified CO2 atmosphere for 48 h prior to harvesting. Bovine polymorphonuclear neutrophils were purified from peripheral blood of cattle by density centrifugation on lymphoprep (Nycomed, Oslo, Norway), followed by isotonic lysis of the red blood cells. Uncoated magnetic M-450 Dynabeads (Dynal, Oslo, Norway) were coated, according to the manufacturer’s instructions, with bIgG2 that was purified as described previously (13Zhang G. Young J.R. Tregaskes C.A. Sopp P. Howard C.J. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 1534-1541PubMed Google Scholar). COS-1 cells were first enriched for those that had taken up DNA during the transfection procedure, as measured by expression of GFP. Therefore, binding assays were performed as follows: 0.5 × 105 GFP+ COS-1 cells (which had also been co-transfected with a bFcγ2R construct) were purified in a FACSVantage cell sorter (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA) and mixed with bIgG2-coated Dynabeads in a final volume of 50 μl per well in V-bottomed microtitre plates. Following a 20-min incubation at room temperature, the plate was spun at 50 × g for 1 min and incubated for an additional 45 min at room temperature. Cells and beads were then carefully resuspended and examined for the presence of rosettes in a Nikon Eclipse E800 microscope, combining ordinary light and fluorescence. Rosettes were defined as GFP+ cells binding four or more Ig-coated beads; at least 200 GFP+ COS-1 cells were counted for each determination. For blocking studies, the cells were incubated with mAb CC-G24 for 30 min at 4 °C prior to the addition of Ig-coated beads. To assess expression of the bFcγ2R mutants at the cell surface, COS-1 cells (transfected with only the bFcγ2R cDNAs and not the GFP construct) or bovine neutrophils were washed twice with FACS buffer (phosphate-buffered saline/0.5% bovine serum albumin/0.02% azide) and incubated with mAb CC-G24 to bFcγ2R, or an irrelevant murine IgM mAb as control, for 1 h at 4 °C. Cells were next washed twice with FACS buffer and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with goat anti-mouse IgM-FITC conjugate (Southern Biotechnology). After washing twice with FACS buffer, cells were analyzed on a FACScan (Becton Dickinson). To examine the binding of small soluble bIgG2 complexes in solution, transfected COS-1 cells or bovine neutrophils were incubated with bIgG2 heat-aggregated previously at 63 °C for 1 h (HA-bIgG2). Briefly, cells were incubated with HA-bIgG2 (40 μg/ml) for 1 h at 4 °C, washed twice with FACS buffer, and incubated for 30 min with a murine mAb to bIgG2 (murine IgG1; Serotec). Cells were again washed twice prior to a final incubation of 30 min with a goat anti-mouse IgG1-FITC conjugate (Southern Biotechnology). Following a final wash, cells were analyzed as above. Data acquisition was conducted with CELLQuest software (Becton Dickinson), whereas analysis was performed with WinMDI software (available from The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA). Bovine neutrophils have previously been shown to express a specific FcR for bIgG2. This receptor has been identified as bFcγ2R, and a murine mAb of the IgM isotype (CC-G24) has been raised.2 CC-G24 bound specifically to bFcγ2R expressed at high levels on bovine neutrophils (Fig.1, panel A). CC-G24 was also able to specifically block binding of HA-bIgG2 to bovine neutrophils (Fig. 1, panel B). HA-bIgG2 was shown to almost completely inhibit binding of bIgG2-coated beads to purified bovine neutrophils; this suggested that bFcγ2R was the only relevant receptor for bIgG2 expressed by these cells (Fig. 1, panel C). CC-G24 also efficiently recognized bFcγ2R expressed transiently on the surface of COS-1 cells (Fig. 1, panel D). Using Fugene 6 we routinely obtained transfection efficiencies in the range of 15 to 40% (as measured by either CC-G24 or HA-bIgG2 binding), which was considered sufficient for our FACS-based bIgG2 binding assay. For rosetting analysis, however, we decided to enrich for bFcγ2R-expressing cells. Naturally we could not use mAb CC-G24 to identify bFcγ2R-expressing COS-1 cells, because this mAb binds to the EC1 domain and blocks bIgG2 binding (see panels B and F, and see Ref. 18Morton H.C. van Zandbergen G. van Kooten C. Howard C.J. van de Winkel J.G. Brandtzaeg P. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1715-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Therefore, to select for cells that had taken up DNA, COS-1 cells were co-transfected with the bFcγ2R plasmids and a vector encoding GFP (Fig. 1, panel E). Our initial experiments using this co-transfection protocol demonstrated that the COS-1 cell population expressing the highest level of GFP (and therefore being the most fluorescent) contained the highest percentage of bFcγ2R-positive cells (data not shown). Therefore, a gate was defined (see Fig. 1, panel E) that allowed the purification of the COS-1 cells with the highest fluorescence intensity. For the wild type bFcγ2R, we found that 70–90% of the (GFP+) cells purified according to the above protocol also expressed bFcγ2R, as assessed by their ability to bind bIgG2-coated beads (Fig. 1, panel F). Furthermore, prior incubation of bFcγ2R+/GFP+ COS-1 cells with mAb CC-G24 almost completely abolished binding of these cells to bIgG2-coated beads (Fig. 1, panel F). Bovine Fcγ2R is a member of the Ig gene superfamily of proteins and is closely related to several human members of this family, including the KIRs, Ig-like transcripts, and the human FcαR (CD89) (14Dennis G.J. Kubagawa H. Cooper M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13245-13250Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Several three-dimensional structures of KIR proteins have now been described, thus identifying the secondary structure composition of the Ig domains. Therefore, because of the highly conserved nature of the Ig-like domain structure, an amino acid alignment of the Ig domains of KIR and bFcγ2R was generated (Fig.2). When the relative positions of the KIR β-strands were superimposed on this alignment the conservation of residues in comparable regions of bFcγ2R was apparent. Because clustering of conserved residues in areas of structural significance may indicate a common Ig domain structure, these regions also likely form β-stranded secondary structures in bFcγ2R (and probably other family members). In addition, it is now recognized that amino acids that form ligand binding sites within Ig-like domains are predominately located within the loop regions. The β-strands, on the other hand, tend to be more involved in the preservation of the overall Ig-like domain structure. It is probably for this reason that amino acids in the loop regions of Ig-like domains tend to be less conserved than those in the strands (see Fig. 2). Thus, we initially selected a series of amino acids predicted to lie in and around several putative loop regions of bFcγ2R as targets for mutagenesis. We then introduced three and four amino acid mutations into these regions to reveal which of them might be involved in bIgG2 binding and thus might be candidates for further studies. Regions identified during this first round of screening were further analyzed by the introduction of single base pair mutations. We first introduced a series of three or four amino acid mutations into the B–C, C–C′, E–F, and F–G loops, because these were the largest loops and thus the areas of greatest divergence (see Fig. 2). The C–C′ and F–G loops were especially interesting when we considered what was already known concerning the location of ligand binding sites within other members of the gene family to which bFcγ2R belongs. The C–C′ loop has been shown to be important for MHC class I recognition by the p58 KIR, and the F–G loop is reported to contain the IgA binding site of CD89 (21Winter C.C. Long E.O. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 4026-4028PubMed Google Scholar, 23Wines B.D. Hulett M.D. Jamieson G.P. Trist H.M. Spratt J.M. Hogarth P.M. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 2146-2153PubMed Google Scholar). A further mutant was generated by deleting part of the (elongated) bFcγ2R EC1–EC2 linker region (the E–R del mutant), to study its contribution (if any) to bIgG2 binding. This mutant was constructed, because recent structural data have shown that the angle of the hinge between EC1 the EC2 domains of the KIR proteins can vary (possibly influencing ligand binding and function), and may partly depend on the composition and length of this linker region. Mutant bFcγ2R cDNAs transfected to COS-1 cells were analyzed by FACS for surface expression, as measured by binding of the bFcγ2R-specific mAb CC-G24. At the same time, the expressed receptors were analyzed for their ability to bind small HA-bIgG2 complexes in solution, also by flow cytometry (see “Materials and Methods”). Analysis of the panel of EC1 domain mutants showed that only mutations in and around the F–G loop region of this domain influenced bIgG2 binding (Fig. 3). Mutation of amino acids SHF at positions 80–82 and VWN at positions 85–87 abolished binding of HA-bIgG2. Mutations in the B–C loop (NTK; positions 35–37), the C–C′ loop (KEGD; positions 43–46), and the E–F loop (NVRE; positions 68–71) did not affect HA-bIgG2 binding. It is interesting to note, however, that whereas the NVRE mutant could bind HA-bIgG2, it was apparently not recognized by the bFcγ2R-specific mAb CC-G24. The number of cells transfected with the KEGD mutant detected by mAb CC-G24 was also reduced (compared with those positive with HA-bIgG2). Together, these observations suggested that the epitope recognized by mAb CC-G24 lies close to, or within, the E–F loop. In addition, our data also suggest that the epitope for this mAb may also include, to a lesser extent, part of the C–C′ loop. Our first round of mutagenesis experiments thus identified several stretches of amino acids important for bIgG2 binding. Mutation of amino acids SHF (position 80–82) and VNW (position 83–85) to alanine both produced mutant bFcγ2R molecules that were expressed at the cell surface but unable to bind bIgG2 (Fig. 3 A). Our data therefore suggested that residues within the F–G loop region were necessary for binding of bIgG2. We next selected four additional amino acids within these regions for further individual mutational analysis. Two of these amino acids are predicted to lie at the beginning of the F–G loop (His-81 and Phe-82) whereas the other two lie further along this loop (Asn-86 and Trp-87) (see Fig. 2). Asn-86 was also interesting from a structural point of view, because it lies within a possibleN-glycosylation addition sequence (Asp-X-Ser/Thr or N-X-(S/T) with the one letter code; see Fig. 2). It is well known that changes in the glycosylation patterns of proteins can adversely affect their expression and function. Results, however, demonstrated that the N86A mutant was expressed at the cell surface and readily able to bind HA-bIgG2. Similarly, the H81A mutant was also expressed at the cell surface and able to bind HA-bIgG2. Conversely, we found that even though the F82A and W87A mutants were indeed expressed on the cell surface, they proved entirely unable to bind to HA-bIgG2 (Fig. 3 B). The consequences of deleting the linker region between the EC1 and EC2 domains of bFcγ2R (the E–R del mutant) were more difficult to interpret. Although our FACS-based assays showed that this mutant was not recognized by the mAb CC-G24, we did detect a small percentage of cells able to bind HA-bIgG2. Rosetting analysis was used to confirm the binding ability of the various bFcγ2R mutants. Rossetting with large Ig-coated particles is a more sensitive method of assessing ligand binding because of the higher avidity of the binding interaction. In our rosetting assay we pre-selected COS-1 cells that expressed transfected DNA at high levels by co-transfection of a plasmid encoding GFP (see “Materials and Methods”). Our results confirmed that residues within and surrounding the F–G loop were critical for bIgG binding (Fig.4). In addition, rosetting confirmed that the E–R mutant was functionally expressed on the cell surface (albeit on a low number of cells) and readily able to bind bIgG-coated beads. By generating and expressing a panel of bFcγ2R proteins carrying specific mutations within their membrane-distal EC1 domains, we have identified residues essential for forming the bIgG2 binding site. Several amino acids located immediately prior to the predicted start of the F–G, loop as well as residues within the loop itself, were shown to be critical for bIgG2 binding. In particular we found that mutation of either Phe-82 or Trp-87 to alanine completely abolished binding to bIgG2. Introduction of point mutations into the loop regions of FcRs and Igs has provided a great deal of information regarding their structure and function (19Hulett M.D. Hogarth P.M. Adv. Immunol. 1994; 57: 1-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). These proteins are composed of several globular domains linked by extremely variable stretches of amino acids that make up the flexible loop regions. Thus, mutagenesis of residues within these loop regions probably does not adversely disturb native protein structure. Importantly, the majority of bFcγ2R mutants described here were still able to efficiently bind bIgG2 and were still recognized by an anti-bFcγ2R mAb. Even when the mAb recognition site was disrupted (in the NVRE and KEGD mutants) these receptors were still able to bind bIgG2. Furthermore, the mutants that were unable to bind bIgG2 were still recognized by the mAb. Therefore, we feel that mutagenesis of residues within the EC1 domain of bFcγ2R are unlikely to have adversely affected overall protein structure, allowing assessment of the relative contribution of the mutated residues to the bIgG2 binding site. We also chose to delete the stretch of amino acids that forms the linker region between the EC1 and EC2 domains of bFcγ2R. The linker region of bFcγ2R is longer than in other related receptors and may have a structural significance. Thus deletion of this region may have more severe consequences for the overall structural integrity of this receptor. Our results showed that whereas surface expression of the E–R del mutant could not be detected by the anti-bFcγ2R mAb, a small proportion of transfectants were still able to bind bIgG. One explanation for these observations could simply be that the E–R del mutant was only expressed by a few cells (because of low transfection efficiency) but when expressed was readily able to bind bIgG2. However, an alternative explanation may be that deletion of the EC1–EC2 linker region results in an aberrantly folded protein unable to be expressed with the correct conformation at the cell surface. The few cells detected in our assay may result from surface expression of incorrectly assembled bFcγ2R molecules where the bIgG binding site is still exposed. Bovine Fcγ2R is closely related to a family of human genes found on chromosome 19 within the leukocyte receptor complex (LRC) that includes the KIR, monocyte/macrophage Ig-like receptor, Ig-like transcripts/LIR, and CD89 proteins (24Wagtmann N. Rojo S. Eichler E. Mohrenweiser H. Long E.O. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 615-618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Wende H. Colonna M. Ziegler A. Volz A. Mamm. Genome. 1999; 10: 154-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). In support of this close genetic relationship, the bFcγ2R gene has been mapped to bovine chromosome 18, which is reported to correspond to human chromosome 19 (26). The genes of the LRC are only slightly less closely related genetically to the other mammalian FcRs than they are to each other. Moreover, available crystal data suggest that proteins encoded in the LRC are structurally quite similar to FcRs (FcγRII, III, and FcεRI) (14Dennis G.J. Kubagawa H. Cooper M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13245-13250Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). However, despite this high degree of homology, the location of the ligand binding sites within these molecules varies considerably. The binding site for human IgG within FcγRII and FcγRIII lies predominantly in the EC2 domain, close to the EC1/EC2 hinge region (27Maxwell K.F. Powell M.S. Hulett M.D. Barton P.A. McKenzie I.F. Garrett T.P. Hogarth P.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 437-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 28Sondermann P. Huber R. Jacob U.

Immunity. 2000; 13: 387-395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). A similar EC2 site within FcεRI is important for binding IgE (30Garman S.C. Kinet J.P. Jardetzky T.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 973-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 31Garman S.C. Wurzburg B.A. Tarchevskaya S.S. Kinet J.P. Jardetzky T.S. Nature. 2000; 406: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). In both these cases, residues within the F–G loop of the EC2 domain are involved (19Hulett M.D. Hogarth P.M. Adv. Immunol. 1994; 57: 1-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). In contrast, the ligand binding sites within the LRC-encoded proteins studied to date have been shown to lie predominantly in the membrane-distal EC1 domains (18Morton H.C. van Zandbergen G. van Kooten C. Howard C.J. van de Winkel J.G. Brandtzaeg P. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1715-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 21Winter C.C. Long E.O. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 4026-4028PubMed Google Scholar, 22Chapman T.L. Heikema A.P. West A.P. Bjorkman P.J. Immunity. 2000; 13: 727-736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 23Wines B.D. Hulett M.D. Jamieson G.P. Trist H.M. Spratt J.M. Hogarth P.M. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 2146-2153PubMed Google Scholar). However, the location of the ligand binding sites varies even among LRC-encoded proteins. The specificity of the p58 KIR protein for its MHC I ligand has been shown to depend on a single residue located in the C–C′ loop of EC1 (marked with an open triangle in Fig. 2) (21Winter C.C. Long E.O. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 4026-4028PubMed Google Scholar). More recent data have suggested that additional residues located around the EC1/EC2 hinge region of the KIRs are involved in maintaining high affinity binding to their MHC I ligands. According to the solved crystal structure of the KIR proteins, these residues all lie on the top face of the molecule (22Chapman T.L. Heikema A.P. West A.P. Bjorkman P.J. Immunity. 2000; 13: 727-736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). On the other hand, ligand binding sites within CD89 and LIR-2 (the only other LRC-encoded proteins yet characterized) are located in a different region of EC1. For both these proteins residues within and around the putative F–G loop are critical for high affinity binding to ligand, whereas exposed residues in other parts of EC1 can also contribute (22Chapman T.L. Heikema A.P. West A.P. Bjorkman P.J. Immunity. 2000; 13: 727-736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 23Wines B.D. Hulett M.D. Jamieson G.P. Trist H.M. Spratt J.M. Hogarth P.M. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 2146-2153PubMed Google Scholar, 32Wines B.D. Sardjono C.T. Trist H.H. Lay C.S. Hogarth P.M. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 1781-1789Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Although mutation of residues in and around the F–G loop of the bFcγ2R EC1 domain adversely affected bIgG2 binding, mutations in other putative loops had little affect. Mutation of residues in the predicted B–C loop (NTK mutant), the C–C′ loop (KEGD mutant), and the E–F loop (NVRE mutant) did not affect bIgG2 binding. Thus mutation of residues around the KIR binding site in the C–C′ loop had no affect on function. We did, however, notice that mutations introduced into the E–F loop abolished binding of the anti-bFcγ2R mAb CC-G24, whereas mutation of the C–C′ loop produced receptors that bound the mAb poorly. These results suggest that the epitope for mAb CC-G24 includes (at least partly) the E–F loop region and may also involve (part of) the C–C′ loop. It is interesting to note that if the three-dimensional structure of bFcγ2R proves to closely resemble that of the KIRs, these two loops would be predicted to lie close together on the top of the EC1 domain (33Fan Q.R. Mosyak L. Winter C.C. Wagtmann N. Long E.O. Wiley D.C. Nature. 1997; 389: 96-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). We also compared the EC1 F–G loop sequence of bFcγ2R with the EC2 F–G loop sequence from other mammalian FcγRs for comparable IgG binding motifs. We noted that all low affinity FcγRs possess a conserved glycine (Gly-156) residue at the beginning of the EC2 F–G loop that is always preceded by a hydrophobic residue (Ile, Phe, Lys, or Val). Both these residues have been implicated in the binding of IgG (19Hulett M.D. Hogarth P.M. Adv. Immunol. 1994; 57: 1-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). A similar motif, Ile-83–Gly-84, is present at a comparable position in the EC1 F–G loop of bFcγ2R. Thus we wondered whether these residues could also play a role in binding to bIgG2. However, our results obtained with the IGV mutant showed that these residues do not contribute to bIgG2 binding. We also examined the bFcγ2R EC1 F–G loop sequence for similarities with the same region of CD89. Elegant mutagenesis studies with soluble CD89 molecules have shown that Arg-82 and His-85 are essential for IgA binding, whereas Arg-87 makes a minor contribution (23Wines B.D. Hulett M.D. Jamieson G.P. Trist H.M. Spratt J.M. Hogarth P.M. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 2146-2153PubMed Google Scholar). Because of the nature of the amino acids involved in binding, it would appear that the CD89-IgA interaction is charge-based. Strikingly, our data demonstrate that amino acids at positions 82 and 87 of bFcγ2R are also essential for ligand binding, although the hydrophobic nature of the residues involved in the bFcγ2R-bIgG2 interaction suggests a different method of binding. Interestingly, as mentioned above, hydrophobic residues are thought to be important for ligand binding by other mammalian FcγRs, perhaps by the formation of a hydrophobic pocket to which the IgG is subsequently bound (19Hulett M.D. Hogarth P.M. Adv. Immunol. 1994; 57: 1-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Therefore, it appears that the IgA binding site of CD89 and the bIgG2 binding site of bFcγ2R lie in almost identical areas of the molecules. One may wonder whether this could be explained by the nature of their ligands. It is known that bFcγ2R binds neither bIgG1 nor human IgA (13Zhang G. Young J.R. Tregaskes C.A. Sopp P. Howard C.J. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 1534-1541PubMed Google Scholar). Conversely, bIgG2 binds poorly, or not at all, to other bovine FcγRs (10Zhang G. Young J.R. Tregaskes C.R. Howard C.J. Immunogenetics. 1994; 39: 423-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The reason for this may be that bIgG2 carries a 6-amino acid deletion within the lower hinge region at a site considered to form an FcγR binding motif within all IgG molecules in which it is present, including bIgG1 (19Hulett M.D. Hogarth P.M. Adv. Immunol. 1994; 57: 1-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar, 34Clarkson C.A. Beale D. Coadwell J.W. Symons D.B. Mol. Immunol. 1993; 30: 1195-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Thus, bIgG2 has clearly evolved an FcR binding site distinct from other mammalian IgG molecules. Therefore, it is extremely interesting to note that the CD89 binding site within IgA is not located in the lower hinge region, as it is with IgG, but rather is located at the Cα2/Cα3 interface (35Carayannopoulos L. Hexham J.M. Capra J.D. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1579-1586Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar,36Pleass R.J. Dunlop J.I. Anderson C.M. Woof J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23508-23514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, it is not known where the bFcγ2R binding site of bIgG2 lies, although our results strongly suggest that it may perhaps be located at a similar position to that found in human IgA,i.e. the Cγ2/Cγ3 boundary. Altogether, it is likely that the evolution of Ig binding sites within the EC1 domains of bFcγ2R and CD89 are specific adaptations that allow efficient binding to Ig molecules at sites distinct from the lower hinge region. At least for IgA, the Cα2/Cα3 region must be easily accessible to the EC1 domain within all the molecular forms of IgA (monomeric, dimeric, and secretory IgA) and not be obstructed by a J chain or a secretory component, because CD89 is able to bind all monomeric and polymeric forms (37Mazengera R.L. Kerr M.A. Biochem. J. 1990; 272: 159-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). A possible reason for the relocation of the FcR binding site in these Ig molecules is that the lower hinge region may be blocked by other parts of the molecule. Supporting this theory is the recent observation that IgA1 may in fact adopt a more “T”-like shape, in contrast to the more “Y” shape more readily associated with IgG molecules, suggesting that the hinge region of IgA1 is (at least partly) obscured by the Fab arms hindering binding to this region (38Boehm M.K. Woof J.M. Kerr M.A. Perkins S.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 1421-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Moreover, molecular modeling of bovine IgG2 predicts that because of the deletion in the hinge region, bIgG2 is a highly compact molecule with a close positioning of the Fab and Fc domains; this would allow only very little or no angular or rotational movement of the Fab arms in relation to the Fc domain (34Clarkson C.A. Beale D. Coadwell J.W. Symons D.B. Mol. Immunol. 1993; 30: 1195-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Interestingly, IgA2, the second subclass of human IgA (which readily binds to CD89) also possesses a very short hinge region, and the structure and flexibility of this isotype probably more closely resembles that of bIgG2 (39Kerr M.A. Biochem. J. 1990; 271: 285-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). In conclusion, we have identified residues in and around the F–G loop of the EC1 domain of bFcγ2R that are important for ligand binding. Specifically, we have shown that Phe-82 and Trp-87 are critical for the binding of bIgG2. The bIgG2 binding site of bFcγ2R is similar to the IgA binding site of the closely related human IgA Fc receptor, CD89. It is likely that these binding sites have evolved to ensure efficient ligand binding and effector cell activation by these FcRs.
