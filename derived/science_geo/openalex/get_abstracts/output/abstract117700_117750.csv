https://openalex.org/W2108448809,"N∊-(Carboxymethyl)lysine (CML) is an advanced glycation end product formed on protein by combined nonenzymatic glycation and oxidation (glycoxidation) reactions. We now report that CML is also formed during metal-catalyzed oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids in the presence of protein. During copper-catalyzed oxidation in vitro, the CML content of low density lipoprotein increased in concert with conjugated dienes but was independent of the presence of the Amadori compound, fructoselysine, on the protein. CML was also formed in a time-dependent manner in RNase incubated under aerobic conditions in phosphate buffer containing arachidonate or linoleate; only trace amounts of CML were formed from oleate. After 6 days of incubation the yield of CML in RNase from arachidonate was ∼0.7 mmol/mol lysine compared with only 0.03 mmol/mol lysine for protein incubated under the same conditions with glucose. Glyoxal, a known precursor of CML, was also formed during incubation of RNase with arachidonate. These results suggest that lipid peroxidation, as well as glycoxidation, may be an important source of CML in tissue proteins in vivo and that CML may be a general marker of oxidative stress and long term damage to protein in aging, atherosclerosis, and diabetes.

Oxidative stress, an imbalance resulting from increased pro-oxidant generation and/or decreased antioxidant defenses, is implicated in the pathogenesis of numerous diseases, including atherosclerosis, diabetes, hemochromatosis, ischemic reperfusion injury, and rheumatoid arthritis, and in the normal aging process(1.Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Free Radicals in Biology and Medicine. 2nd Ed. Clarendon Press, Oxford1989Google Scholar).

Steinberg D. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 1785-1792Google Scholar). In diabetes, oxidative stress, resulting from the metabolic sequelae of hyperglycemia and/or nonenzymatic glycation of protein, leads to increased formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) in tissue proteins(3.Brownlee M. Diabetes. 1994; 43: 836-841Google Scholar, 4.Vlassara H. Bucala R. Striker L. Lab. Invest. 1994; 70: 138-151Google Scholar). Among these AGEs are the glycoxidation products, N∊-(carboxymethyl)lysine (CML) and pentosidine, which are the only chemically characterized AGEs known to accumulate in protein with age and at an accelerated rate in diabetes (5.Baynes J.W. Diabetes. 1991; 40: 405-412Google Scholar). Glycation and glycoxidation products and AGEs affect the structure and function of proteins and cross-linking of extracellular proteins, processes that are thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of vascular disease in diabetes and atherosclerosis(3.Brownlee M. Diabetes. 1994; 43: 836-841Google Scholar, 4.Vlassara H. Bucala R. Striker L. Lab. Invest. 1994; 70: 138-151Google Scholar, 5.Baynes J.W.

The observations that the extent of glycation of plasma proteins, including LDL, is increased in diabetes (6.Curtiss L.K. Witztum J.L. Diabetes. 1985; 34: 452-461Google Scholar) and that glycated proteins are redox-active and may thus catalyze lipid peroxidation reactions have suggested that increased glycation of LDL in diabetes might accelerate its oxidation, providing a mechanism for the excess risk for atherosclerosis associated with diabetes(7.Mullarkey C.J. Edelstein D. Brownlee M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 173: 932-939Google Scholar). Other studies have shown that plasma antioxidant defenses, including ascorbic acid and vitamin E concentrations, and total radical trapping activity are also compromised in diabetes(8.Tsai E.C. Hirsch I.B. Brunzell J.D. Chait A. Diabetes. 1994; 43: 1010-1014Google Scholar). Although the combination of increased glycation of LDL and decreased antioxidant defenses in diabetic plasma provides the potential for catalysis of lipid peroxidation in plasma lipoproteins, there is no direct evidence of a correlation between glycation and enhanced oxidation of LDL in diabetes. In an effort to understand the potential interplay between glycation and lipid peroxidation reactions, we initiated studies on how changes in levels of glycation affect lipid peroxidation and formation of glycoxidation products during metal-catalyzed oxidation of LDL in vitro. We report here the unexpected observation that CML is formed during copper-mediated oxidation of LDL, independent of the presence of the putative carbohydrate precursor, the Amadori compound fructoselysine (FL). We also report that CML, heretofore described as a glycoxidation product, is formed during peroxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in the presence of ribonuclease A (RNase), a protein that contains neither enzymatically nor nonenzymatically attached carbohydrate. The following reagents were purchased from Sigma: diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid, arachidonic acid, linoleic acid, oleic acid, and bovine pancreatic ribonuclease A (RNase, type II-A). Girard T reagent ((carboxymethyl)trimethyl-ammonium chloride) and glyoxal (40% monomer solution) were from Aldrich. CML and FL standards were synthesized as described(9.Knecht K.J. Dunn J.A. McFarland K.F. McCance D.R. Lyons T.J. Thorpe S.R. Baynes J.W. Diabetes. 1991; 40: 190-196Google Scholar). Blood was obtained from healthy volunteers after an overnight fast. Blood was collected in EDTA (1.5 mg/ml), and plasma was separated by centrifugation. LDL was isolated by single vertical spin centrifugation(10.Chung B.H. Segrest J.P. Ray M.J. Brunzell J.D. Hokanson J.E. Krauss R.M. Beudrie K. Cone J.T. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 128: 181-209Google Scholar), stored at 4°C under nitrogen, and used within 48 h of isolation. The purity of LDL preparations was confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis followed by staining for both lipid and protein using a Paragon LIPOEPG system (Beckman Instruments, Palo Alto, CA), which showed a single lipid and protein band; contamination with albumin was not detected. LDL protein concentration was estimated by the method of Lowry(11.Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Google Scholar). LDL pools were prepared by combining LDL from three individuals. To remove salts, EDTA, and water-soluble antioxidants prior to copper oxidation experiments, LDL was chromatographed on PD-10 columns (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) equilibrated in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; (12.Dulbecco R. Vogt M.S. J. Exp. Med. 1954; 98: 167-173Google Scholar)) that had been gassed with nitrogen. The LDL was sterilized by ultrafiltration (0.22-μ filters, CoStar, Cambridge, MA) and then diluted to ∼100 μg of protein/ml using PBS that had been bubbled with oxygen for at least 10 min. The diluted samples were adjusted to 5 μM CuCl2, placed in loosely capped plastic bottles, and incubated at 32°C; copper was omitted in control samples. The progress of the oxidation reaction was monitored by measuring absorbance at 234 nm in aliquots removed at various times. For analysis of CML, aliquots (∼1 mg of protein) were adjusted to 1 mM in diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (0.1 M) in sodium borate, pH 9.2, and reduced overnight at 4°C with a final concentration of 25 mM NaBH4. The samples were then dialyzed against water, dried by centrifugal evaporation (Savant Speed-Vac, Farmingdale, NY), and delipidated using methanol:ether (3:10)(13.Osborne J.C. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 128: 213-222Google Scholar). For analyses of FL, samples were treated with diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid, dialyzed immediately, dried, and delipidated. Reaction mixtures, in triplicate, were prepared containing 1 mM RNase (equal to 10 mM lysine) and either 100 mM fatty acid or 100 mM glucose in PBS. The required amounts of fatty acids dissolved in CHCl3 were placed in sterile 20-ml glass scintillation vials, and the solvent was removed under a stream of nitrogen passed through a 0.22-μ filter. All subsequent additions and the removal of sample aliquots at various times were conducted using sterile technique in a tissue culture hood. Solutions of RNase or glucose prepared in sterile PBS were sterilized by ultrafiltration (0.22-μ filter) and added as appropriate to the vials containing fatty acid. The vials were covered with sterile caps and placed in a shaking water bath at 37°C. Aliquots (0.2-0.4 ml) were removed at desired times and processed immediately. Fatty acids were removed by Folch extraction(14.Folch J. Lees M. Sloane-Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Google Scholar). The aqueous layer and protein interface from the Folch extracts were back-extracted with theoretical Folch lower phases and dialyzed against water, and the protein was then processed for measurement of CML. To limit oxidation of FL to CML during sample hydrolysis, aliquots of protein incubated with glucose were first reduced with NaBH4 prior to measurement of CML (9.Knecht K.J. Dunn J.A. McFarland K.F. McCance D.R. Lyons T.J. Thorpe S.R. Baynes J.W. Diabetes. 1991; 40: 190-196Google Scholar). Recovery of CML in protein incubated with fatty acids only was unaffected by prior reduction with NaBH4. In some experiments a second aliquot (0.7 ml) was used for measurement of glyoxal. Following acidification with 25 μl of 3 M HCl and the addition of 100 μl of Girard T reagent (0.5 N) (16.Wells-Knecht K.J. Zyzak D.V. Litchfield J.E. Thorpe S.R. Baynes J.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3702-3709Google Scholar), samples were incubated at room temperature for 1 h and then stored at −20°C; samples were analyzed by HPLC (16.Wells-Knecht K.J. Zyzak D.V. Litchfield J.E. Thorpe S.R. Baynes J.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3702-3709Google Scholar) in a single batch at the end of the experiment. Following the addition of d8-lysine and d8-CML or 13C6-FL internal standards, proteins were hydrolyzed in 6 N HCl for 24 h at 110°C. After drying by centrifugal evaporation, the dried hydrolysates were dissolved in 3 ml of 20% methanol containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and applied to 3-ml Sep-Pak columns (Supelco, Bellefonte, PA) to remove brown and lipophilic materials prior to derivatization for GC/MS. The eluates were again dried and then derivatized for measurement of CML or FL by GC/MS as their trifluoroacetyl methyl ester derivatives(9.Knecht K.J. Dunn J.A. McFarland K.F. McCance D.R. Lyons T.J. Thorpe S.R. Baynes J.W. Diabetes. 1991; 40: 190-196Google Scholar). Fig. 1 describes the kinetics of metal-catalyzed oxidation of normal LDL and concurrent changes in the protein's content of CML and FL. Comparison of the kinetics of conjugated diene (panel A) and CML (panel B) formation indicates that the rate of CML formation parallels the rate of fatty acid peroxidation. Neither conjugated dienes nor CML increased in the absence of copper. Because we assumed initially that the CML was derived from oxidation of the Amadori adduct on LDL, the FL content of the protein was also measured at various stages in the oxidation reaction. The data in panel C demonstrate unexpectedly that, unlike CML, the FL content of LDL remained constant during the course of the copper oxidation. We concluded tentatively that the CML was being formed from a product of oxidation of the lipid component of the LDL. To verify that CML could be formed independent of the presence of FL, the LDL was reduced with NaBH4 to convert FL to the inert, redox-inactive hexitollysine adduct. Table 1 shows that ≤5% of the original FL remained on the reduced LDL, yet following oxidation of the reduced lipoprotein, the yield of CML was similar to that formed during oxidation of the native protein. The absorbance traces during metal-catalyzed oxidation of NaBH4-reduced LDL were similar to those of the native protein (data not shown). These results indicate that CML can be formed on lipoprotein from product(s) of PUFA oxidation.Tabled 1 To further characterize the formation of CML during lipoxidation reactions, model experiments were carried out in which PUFAs were oxidized in the presence of RNase A, a protein devoid of carbohydrate. As shown in Fig. 2, oxidation of linoleate and arachidonate in the presence of RNase yielded a time-dependent increase in CML residues in the protein. In these experiments the fatty acids were progressively solubilized in buffer as they autoxidized, and the experiments were arbitrarily terminated at 6 days when the arachidonate reactions became a single phase. The overall amount of CML formed was dependent on the degree of unsaturation and oxidizability of the fatty acid, with the greatest yield of CML formed from arachidonate, an intermediate yield from linoleate, and only trace amounts formed from oleate. The difference in yields of CML from the various fatty acids probably reflects differences in their extent of oxidation at the end of the experiment. Because CML was originally identified as a glycoxidation product(5.Baynes J.W. Diabetes. 1991; 40: 405-412Google Scholar, 17.Fu M-X Knecht K.J. Blackledge J.A. Lyons T.J. Thorpe S.R. Baynes J.W. Diabetes. 1994; 43: 676-683Google Scholar), i.e. the result of combined glycation and oxidation reactions, we also compared the relative yield of CML from glucose and arachidonate. Fig. 3 shows that at the end of 6 days' incubation the yield of CML from autoxidizing arachidonic acid, 0.74 ± 0.03 mmol/mol RNase, was significantly greater than that from glucose, 0.03 ± 0.003 mmol/mol RNase. These results indicate that both carbohydrates and lipids may contribute to formation of CML during autoxidation reactions in physiological buffer. However, oxidation of fatty acid is clearly a more efficient source of CML, despite the fact that the glucose is in solution throughout the course of the experiment, while the PUFA are only progressively solubilized. Further, after 6 days of incubation, a large fraction of the arachidonate was oxidized based on its solubilization in the aqueous phase, while ≤2% of the glucose is oxidized during this same time period(16.Wells-Knecht K.J. Zyzak D.V. Litchfield J.E. Thorpe S.R. Baynes J.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3702-3709Google Scholar). Finally, pentosidine, a second glycoxidation product known to form during glycoxidation reactions in vitro and in vivo, was detected in incubations of RNase and glucose, but no pentosidine was detected either in incubations of RNase with PUFA or in copper-oxidized LDL. We have previously shown that glyoxal is both a product of glucose autoxidation and a source of CML in protein(16.Wells-Knecht K.J. Zyzak D.V. Litchfield J.E. Thorpe S.R. Baynes J.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3702-3709Google Scholar). Glyoxal formation has also been reported during UV irradiation of PUFA (18.Niyati-Shirkhodaee F. Shibamoto T. J. Agric. Food Chem. 1993; 41: 227-230Google Scholar) and during oxidation of linolenic acid in an iron ascorbate model system(19.Loidl-Stahlhofen A. Spiteller G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1211: 156-160Google Scholar, 20.Mlakar A. Spiteller G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1214: 209-220Google Scholar), although in the latter case formation of glyoxal from iron ascorbate itself was not excluded. In the present experiments the formation of glyoxal from PUFA was monitored by trapping it as the Girard T adduct (16.Wells-Knecht K.J. Zyzak D.V. Litchfield J.E. Thorpe S.R. Baynes J.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3702-3709Google Scholar). The data in Fig. 4 show that there was a progressive increase in the amount of glyoxal formed in autoxidizing arachidonic acid incubations, which was not significantly affected by the presence of protein. The data also indicate that the amount of glyoxal formed during arachidonate oxidation was more than sufficient to account for the amount of CML formed on protein, if glyoxal were the only source of all the CML formed. The observations described above indicate that CML, previously described as a glycoxidation product or AGE, may, in fact, be derived from PUFA during lipid peroxidation reactions. These observations require a reassessment of previous work on (a) the biochemical origin of AGEs, (b) the significance of carbohydrate oxidation, autoxidative glycosylation, and glycoxidation in the chemical modification of proteins in diabetes, and, in general, (c) mechanisms of oxidative stress and pathways of oxidative damage to protein and other biomolecules in aging, atherosclerosis, and diabetes. Our studies indicate that lipid peroxidation is a potential source of CML during lipoprotein oxidation and is the major source of CML formed during metal-catalyzed oxidation of LDL in vitro. Since PUFAs, both in biological systems and in vitro (Fig. 3) are, in general, more easily autoxidized in free radical reactions than are carbohydrates, it is quite possible that the majority of CML in tissue proteins is derived from lipid peroxidation reactions, even during hyperglycemia when concentrations of glucose and Amadori products on protein are increased. Indeed, the fact that the FL on LDL was not a significant source of CML formation during metal-catalyzed oxidation of LDL suggests that glucose and Amadori adducts may be less important sources of CML in protein, even in diabetes. The mechanism of formation of CML and other AGEs during carbohydrate oxidation reactions is still uncertain. The pathway may involve oxidation of free glucose or protein-bound intermediates, including carbinolamine, Schiff base, and Amadori adducts(17.Fu M-X Knecht K.J. Blackledge J.A. Lyons T.J. Thorpe S.R. Baynes J.W. Diabetes. 1994; 43: 676-683Google Scholar, 21.Glomb M.A. Monnier V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10017-10026Google Scholar, 22.Wells-Knecht M.C. Thorpe S.R. Baynes J.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15134-15141Google Scholar). Wells-Knecht et al. (16.Wells-Knecht K.J. Zyzak D.V. Litchfield J.E. Thorpe S.R. Baynes J.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3702-3709Google Scholar) identified glyoxal as one intermediate in the formation of CML from glucose. Since glyoxal is also formed during peroxidation of PUFA ((18.Niyati-Shirkhodaee F. Shibamoto T. J. Agric. Food Chem. 1993; 41: 227-230Google Scholar, 19.Loidl-Stahlhofen A. Spiteller G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1211: 156-160Google Scholar, 20.Mlakar A. Spiteller G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1214: 209-220Google Scholar) and Fig. 4), it may be a common intermediate in the formation of CML during oxidation of both carbohydrates and lipids. However, other common intermediates may also be involved, such as glycolaldehyde(21.Glomb M.A. Monnier V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10017-10026Google Scholar), α-hydroxyaldehydes, or β,γ-unsaturated α-hydroxyaldehydes or dicarbonyls, which may be formed from both carbohydrate and PUFA oxidation. The intersection of carbohydrate and lipid autoxidation reactions in the formation of CML emphasizes the relationship between the fundamental chemistry and biochemistry of these molecules. The importance of lipid peroxidation in the formation of AGEs and cross-linking of proteins is suggested by several experimental observations. The browning and cross-linking of extracellular proteins increase so rapidly in animal models of diabetes (23.Brownlee M. Vlassara H. Kooney T. Ulrich P. Cerami A. Science. 1986; 232: 1629-1632Google Scholar) that, in the absence of large endogenous pools of decompartmentalized transition metal ions, the origin of the browning products is more readily explained by lipid rather than carbohydrate oxidation reactions. AGEs also accumulate within a few days on intracellular proteins of cells grown in high glucose media(24.Giardino I. Edelstein D. Brownlee M. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 110-117Google Scholar). The rapidity of AGE formation and the effect of antioxidants as inhibitors of acute glucose toxicity (25.Curcio F. Ceriello A. In Vitro Cell. & Dev. Biol. 1992; 28A: 787-790Google Scholar) suggests that they may act by inhibiting glucose-induced lipid peroxidation reactions(26.Kawamura M. Heinecke J.W. Chait A. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 771-778Google Scholar). Finally, it should be noted that aminoguanidine, which is a potent inhibitor of glycoxidation reactions in vitro(17.Fu M-X Knecht K.J. Blackledge J.A. Lyons T.J. Thorpe S.R. Baynes J.W. Diabetes. 1994; 43: 676-683Google Scholar, 21.Glomb M.A. Monnier V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10017-10026Google Scholar), the browning and cross-linking of collagen in vivo(23.Brownlee M. Vlassara H. Kooney T. Ulrich P. Cerami A. Science. 1986; 232: 1629-1632Google Scholar), and the development of complications in diabetic animals(3.Brownlee M. Diabetes. 1994; 43: 836-841Google Scholar, 4.Vlassara H. Bucala R. Striker L. Lab. Invest. 1994; 70: 138-151Google Scholar), also inhibits lipid peroxidation reactions (27.Picard S. Parthasarathy S. Fruebis J. Witztum J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6876-6880Google Scholar, 28.Requena J.R. Vidal P. Cabezas-Cerrato J. Diabetes Res. 1993; 20: 43-49Google Scholar, 29.Philis-Tsimikas A. Parthasarathy S. Picard W. Palinski W. Witztum J.L. Arterioscler. Throm. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 367-376Google Scholar) Thus, this compound, which has been described primarily as an inhibitor of advanced glycation reactions, may in fact be exerting its effects in vivo by inhibition of lipid peroxidation reactions and/or by trapping of lipid peroxides and PUFA-derived carbonyl compounds, including glyoxal. Because similar intermediates may be derived from both carbohydrate and lipid peroxidation reactions, it has become difficult to discern the primary source of oxidative damage to protein in complex biological matrices. Palinski et al. (30.Palinski W. Koshcinsky T. Butler S.W. Miller E. Vlassara H. Cerami A. Witztum J.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 571-582Google Scholar) have recently reported, for example, that anti-AGE antibodies detect an increase in AGE epitopes in atherosclerotic plaque in normoglycemic animals. Our previous work identifying CML as a major antigenic determinant in AGE proteins (31.Reddy S. Bichler J. Wells-Knecht K.J. Thorpe S.R. Baynes J.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10872-10878Google Scholar) and the present work identifying CML as a product of lipid peroxidation suggest that the increase in AGE epitopes in atherosclerotic plaque could result from an increase in CML derived from lipid peroxidation reactions. In addition, lipid-derived CML may also be the major AGE epitope accumulating in intracellular protein in endothelial cells exposed to glucose-induced oxidative stress(24.Giardino I. Edelstein D. Brownlee M. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 110-117Google Scholar). To distinguish carbohydrate- from lipid-mediated damage and assess the relative importance of oxidation of these two substrates in the development of diabetic complications, it will be necessary to identify unique products derived from each of these precursors. In the meantime, since CML has been identified as a major AGE antigen in tissue proteins and a product of both carbohydrate and lipid peroxidation reactions, our results suggest that CML may be more useful as a general biomarker of oxidative stress and damage in tissue proteins."

The ceramide, in turn, blocked platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) stimulated DNA synthesis. We now present evidence that the PDGF receptor initiates signal transduction from caveolae. Cell fractionation and immunocytochemistry show caveolae to be the principal location of PDGF receptors at the cell surface. Multiple caveolae proteins acquire phosphotyrosine when PDGF binds to its receptor, but the hormone appears to have little effect on the tyrosine phosphorylation of non-caveolae membrane proteins. Five proteins known to interact with the phosphorylated receptor were found to be highly enriched in caveolae membrane. PDGF caused the concentration of three of these proteins to significantly increase in the caveolae fraction. Finally, PDGF stimulated the association of a 190-kDa phosphoprotein with the caveolae marker protein, caveolin. Therefore, ceramide may modulate PDGF receptor function directly in caveolae.

https://openalex.org/W1586509612,"Previous studies of the crystal structure of the ovine prostaglandin endoperoxide H synthase-1 (PGHS-1)/S-flurbiprofen complex (Picot, D., Loll, P. J., and Garavito, R. M.(1994) Nature 367, 243-249) suggest that the enzyme is associated with membranes through a series of four amphipathic helices located between residues 70 and 117. We have used the photoactivatable, hydrophobic reagent 3-trifluoro-3-(m-[125I]iodophenyl)diazirine ([125I]TID) which partitions into membranes and other hydrophobic domains to determine which domains of microsomal PGHS-1 are subject to photolabeling. After incubation of ovine vesicular gland microsomes with [125I]TID, ovine PGHS-1 was one of the major photolabeled proteins. Proteolytic cleavage of labeled PGHS-1 at Arg277 with trypsin established that [125I]TID was incorporated into both the 33-kDa tryptic peptide containing the amino terminus and the 38-kDa tryptic peptide containing the carboxyl terminus. This pattern of photolabeling was not affected by the presence of 20 mM glutathione, indicating that the photolabeling observed for PGHS-1 was not due to the presence of [125I]TID in the aqueous phase. However, nonradioactive TID as well as two inhibitors, ibuprofen and sulindac sulfide, which bind the cyclooxygenase active site of PGHS-1, prevented the labeling of the 38-kDa carboxyl-terminal tryptic peptide. These results suggest that [125I]TID can label both the cyclooxygenase active site in the tryptic 38-kDa fragment and a membrane binding domain located in the 33-kDa fragment. Cleavage of photolabeled PGHS-1 with endoproteinase Lys-C yielded a peptide containing residues 25-166 which was labeled with [125I]TID. This peptide contains the putative membrane binding domain of ovine PGHS-1. Our results provide biochemical support for the concept developed from the crystal structure that PGHS-1 binds to membranes via four amphipathic helices located near the NH2 terminus of the protein. Previous studies of the crystal structure of the ovine prostaglandin endoperoxide H synthase-1 (PGHS-1)/S-flurbiprofen complex (Picot, D., Loll, P. J., and Garavito, R. M.(1994) Nature 367, 243-249) suggest that the enzyme is associated with membranes through a series of four amphipathic helices located between residues 70 and 117. We have used the photoactivatable, hydrophobic reagent 3-trifluoro-3-(m-[125I]iodophenyl)diazirine ([125I]TID) which partitions into membranes and other hydrophobic domains to determine which domains of microsomal PGHS-1 are subject to photolabeling. After incubation of ovine vesicular gland microsomes with [125I]TID, ovine PGHS-1 was one of the major photolabeled proteins. Proteolytic cleavage of labeled PGHS-1 at Arg277 with trypsin established that [125I]TID was incorporated into both the 33-kDa tryptic peptide containing the amino terminus and the 38-kDa tryptic peptide containing the carboxyl terminus. This pattern of photolabeling was not affected by the presence of 20 mM glutathione, indicating that the photolabeling observed for PGHS-1 was not due to the presence of [125I]TID in the aqueous phase. However, nonradioactive TID as well as two inhibitors, ibuprofen and sulindac sulfide, which bind the cyclooxygenase active site of PGHS-1, prevented the labeling of the 38-kDa carboxyl-terminal tryptic peptide. These results suggest that [125I]TID can label both the cyclooxygenase active site in the tryptic 38-kDa fragment and a membrane binding domain located in the 33-kDa fragment. Cleavage of photolabeled PGHS-1 with endoproteinase Lys-C yielded a peptide containing residues 25-166 which was labeled with [125I]TID. This peptide contains the putative membrane binding domain of ovine PGHS-1. Our results provide biochemical support for the concept developed from the crystal structure that PGHS-1 binds to membranes via four amphipathic helices located near the NH2 terminus of the protein. The prostaglandin endoperoxide H synthase (PGHS) 1The abbreviations used are: PGHSprostaglandin endoperoxide H synthaseTID3-trifluoro-3-(m-iodophenyl)diazirinePGprostaglandinNSAIDnonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugERendoplasmic reticulumECLenhanced chemiluminescencePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. isozymes catalyze the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandin endoperoxide H2, the committed step in the biosynthetic pathway of prostaglandins and thromboxane(1.Smith W.L. Biochem. J. 1989; 259: 315-324Google Scholar). PGHS isozymes have two distinct activities: a cyclooxygenase activity, which catalyzes the oxygenation of arachidonic acid to yield PGG2, and a peroxidase activity, which reduces the 15-hydroperoxyl group of PGG2 to form prostaglandin endoperoxide H2(2.Miyamoto T. Ogino N. Yamamoto S. Hayaishi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 2629-2636Google Scholar, 3.Van der Ouderaa F.J. Buytenhek M. Nugteren D.H. Van Dorp D.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 487: 315-331Google Scholar). Two isoforms of PGHS are known and are designated PGHS-1 and PGHS-2. PGHS-1 is the original “cyclooxygenase” characterized from ovine vesicular glands. PGHS-1 is expressed constitutively in most tissues(4.Smith W.L. Laneuville O. Anderson K.M. Harris J. Eicosanoids and Their Inhibitors in Cancer Immunology and Immunotherapy. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1994: 1-39Google Scholar). PGHS-2 is the more recently discovered isozyme whose expression is inducible and has been implicated in inflammation(4.Smith W.L. Laneuville O. Anderson K.M. Harris J. Eicosanoids and Their Inhibitors in Cancer Immunology and Immunotherapy. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1994: 1-39Google Scholar). PGHS isozymes have considerable homology in amino acid sequence and are thought to have similar structures(5.DeWitt D.L. Smith W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1212-1416Google Scholar, 6.Merlie J.P. Fagan D. Mudd J. Needleman P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3550-3553Google Scholar, 7.Yokoyama C. Takai T. Tanabe T.

Fletcher B.S. Varnum B.C. Lim R.W. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12866-12872Google Scholar). Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as aspirin, ibuprofen, and sulindac sulfide inhibit both isoforms of PGHS by binding the cyclooxygenase active site and blocking cyclooxygenase activity(10.Laneuville O Breuer D.K. DeWitt D.L. Hla T. Funk C.D. Smith W.L. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1994; 271: 927-934Google Scholar, 11.Meade E.A. Smith W.L. DeWitt D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6610-6614Google Scholar). The peroxidase activity of the isozymes is not appreciably affected by most NSAIDs consistent with the idea that PGHS isozymes have distinct cyclooxygenase and peroxidase active sites(12.Mizuno K. Yamamoto S. Lands W.E. Prostaglandins. 1982; 23: 743-757Google Scholar, 13.Van der Ouderaa F.J. Buytenhek M. Nugteren D.H. Van Dorp D.A. Eur. J.

Both PGHS isozymes are glycoproteins (14.Mutsaers J.H. van Halbeek H. Kamerling J.P. Vliegenthart J.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 147: 569-574Google Scholar) which are associated with the membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and nuclear envelope(15.Rollins T.E. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4872-4875Google Scholar, 16.Regier M.K. DeWitt D.L. Schindler M.S. Smith W.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 301: 439-444Google Scholar). The isozymes are both inserted through the ER membrane via NH2-terminal signal peptides, which are cleaved in the mature enzymes(5.DeWitt D.L. Smith W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1212-1416Google Scholar, 6.Merlie J.P. Fagan D. Mudd J. Needleman P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3550-3553Google Scholar, 7.Yokoyama C. Takai T. Tanabe T.

Both isozymes exhibit the characteristics of integral membrane proteins in that they are associated with microsomal membranes and require detergent for solubilization(2.Miyamoto T. Ogino N. Yamamoto S. Hayaishi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 2629-2636Google Scholar, 3.Van der Ouderaa F.J. Buytenhek M. Nugteren D.H. Van Dorp D.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 487: 315-331Google Scholar, 17.Sirois J. Richards J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6382-6388Google Scholar). Additionally, following purification, PGHS-1 can be reincorporated into liposomes, indicating that the protein can bind to lipid bilayers directly(18.Strittmatter P. Machuga E.T. Roth G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 11883-11886Google Scholar). However, unlike other integral membrane proteins, the PGHS isozymes do not appear to contain transmembrane domains. This prediction is based on analysis of the crystal structure of solubilized ovine PGHS-1(19.Picot D. Loll P.J. Garavito M. Nature. 1994; 367: 243-249Google Scholar), and is supported by biochemical studies showing that six different evenly spaced regions of the isozymes are located in the lumen of the ER(20.Otto J.C. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19868-19875Google Scholar). An interesting mechanism for the association of the PGHS isozymes has been proposed by Garavito and co-workers based on examination of the crystal structure of ovine PGHS-1(19.Picot D. Loll P.J. Garavito M. Nature. 1994; 367: 243-249Google Scholar, 21.Picot D. Garavito R.M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 346: 21-25Google Scholar). Residues 70-117 2The numbering of amino acids begins at the methionine at the translational start site of ovine PGHS-1. of ovine PGHS-1 contain four consecutive, short amphipathic α-helices which form a hydrophobic face along one side of the enzyme with the hydrophobic residues pointing away from the body of the enzyme. This region of the enzyme is proposed to be a membrane binding domain, associating with a single leaflet of the ER membrane but without fully traversing it. Should this prediction hold true, PGHS-1 will be the first monotopic membrane protein for which the structure has been determined. However, there is currently no biochemical evidence supporting this prediction. 3-Trifluoro-3-(m-[125I]iodophenyl)diazirine ([125I]TID) is a hydrophobic, photoactivatable reagent which partitions into lipid bilayers making this reagent a useful tool for determining regions of proteins which are membrane-associated (22.Brunner J. Semenza G. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 7174-7182Google Scholar, 23.White B.H. Cohen J.B. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8741-8751Google Scholar, 24.Blanton M.P. Cohen J.B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2859-2872Google Scholar). In order to identify regions of PGHS-1 which are associated with the lipid bilayer, we examined the photolabeling by [125I]TID of PGHS-1 present in microsomal membranes prepared from ovine seminal vesicles. Our results indicate that [125I]TID photolabels a region of PGHS-1 which contains the putative membrane binding domain. We also found that [125I]TID can photolabel the cyclooxygenase active site of PGHS-1. [125I]TID and ECL Western blotting reagents were from Amersham Corp. Protein A-Sephacryl 4B, ibuprofen, Tween 20, trypsin, chicken egg white trypsin inhibitor, and reduced glutathione were from Sigma. Endoproteinase Lys-C was from Boehringer Mannheim. Goat anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase was from Bio-Rad. Frozen ovine vesicular glands were obtained from Oxford Biomedical Research. Nonradioactive TID was the generous gift of Dr. Jonathan Cohen (Harvard Medical School). Sulindac sulfide was a gift from Merck. Frozen ovine vesicular glands were sliced into thin strips with a razor blade and homogenized with a Polytron homogenizer in a HEPES buffer consisting of 20 mM HEPES, 20 mM glutamic acid, 2 mM magnesium acetate, and 200 mM sucrose, pH 7.5. The homogenate was then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min to remove cell debris and mitochondria. The resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 1 h(3.Van der Ouderaa F.J. Buytenhek M. Nugteren D.H. Van Dorp D.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 487: 315-331Google Scholar), and the microsomal pellet was resuspended in HEPES buffer by homogenization with a Dounce homogenizer; this preparation was then cleared by centrifugation for 5 min at 10,000 × g. The protein concentration of the cleared microsomal suspension was determined by the method of Bradford(25.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar). Ovine vesicular gland microsomes were diluted to a final protein concentration of 3 mg/ml of HEPES buffer, and [125I]TID was added at a final concentration of approximately 5 μM. Following a 10-min incubation at 0°C, the microsomes were transferred to a 1-cm diameter plastic culture dish and were irradiated at a distance of 5-10 cm with a hand held UV illuminator (366 nm) for 10 min at 0°C(24.Blanton M.P. Cohen J.B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2859-2872Google Scholar). In some experiments, microsomes were incubated with glutathione, ibuprofen, sulindac sulfide, or nonradioactive TID for 10 min at 0°C prior to the addition of [125I]TID. Incubations with [125I]TID and photolabeling were then performed using the procedure described above. Following photolabeling of ovine vesicular gland microsomes with [125I]TID, the membranes were collected by centrifugation at 200,000 × g for 1 h and resuspended at a final protein concentration of 3 mg/ml. The resulting microsomal suspension was incubated with trypsin (10:1 microsomal protein:trypsin) for 15 min at 25°C. A 40-fold excess of trypsin inhibitor was then added, and the microsomal proteins were solubilized by addition of Tween 20 to a final concentration of 1%. The solution was sonicated for 30 s and centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 × g. The solubilized protein was incubated with a mixture of antipeptide antibodies against the amino and carboxyl termini of ovine PGHS-1(20.Otto J.C. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19868-19875Google Scholar), and protein A-Sephacryl 4B was added. The immobilized protein A-antibody-PGHS-1 complex was collected by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 1 min and was washed extensively with 0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 1% Tween 20 essentially as described previously(26.DeWitt D.L. Rollins T.E. Day J.S. Gauger J.A. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 10375-10382Google Scholar). PGHS-1 was eluted from the complex by boiling the sample in SDS-PAGE-loading buffer. Samples were subjected to electrophoresis on 15% SDS-PAGE gels, and the proteins visualized by silver staining(27.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). 125I-Labeled peptides were identified by autoradiography. Following photolabeling, microsomes (600 μg of microsomal protein) were solubilized by the addition of Tween 20 to a final concentration of 1%, followed by sonication and centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min. Solubilized PGHS-1 was immunoprecipitated using the mouse monoclonal antibody cyo-7 (26.DeWitt D.L. Rollins T.E. Day J.S. Gauger J.A. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 10375-10382Google Scholar) coupled to Protein A-Sephacryl 4B. PGHS-1 was eluted from the Sephacryl beads by boiling in 0.5% SDS. The sample was diluted to 0.05% SDS in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 0.3 unit of endoproteinase Lys-C was added. Following incubation overnight at 37°C, the sample was lyophilized and resuspended in SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Proteolytic products were resolved on a 15% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose. Western blotting was performed on the filters, and the immunoreactive bands were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection as detailed previously(20.Otto J.C. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19868-19875Google Scholar). After waiting for several hours to allow the chemiluminescence to fade, [125I]TID-labeled peptides were identified by autoradiography. PGHS-1 represents 5-10% of the protein present in ovine vesicular gland microsomes(26.DeWitt D.L. Rollins T.E. Day J.S. Gauger J.A. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 10375-10382Google Scholar, 28.Silvia W.J. Brockman J.A. Kaminski M.A. Dewitt D.L. Smith W.L. Molecular Andrology. 1994; 6: 197-207Google Scholar). Ovine PGHS-1 can be cleaved by trypsin at one site, Arg277, generating a 33-kDa peptide which contains the amino terminus including the putative membrane binding domain between residues 70 and 117 and a 38-kDa peptide which contains the carboxyl terminus(29.Chen Y.N. Bienkowski M.J. Marnett L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16892-16899Google Scholar, 30.Kulmacz R.J. Wu K.K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 268: 502-515Google Scholar). The intact 72-kDa PGHS-1 and both the 33-kDa amino-terminal and 38-kDa carboxyl-terminal tryptic peptides of PGHS-1 can be immunoprecipitated from solubilized microsomes using a combination of peptide-directed antibodies against the amino (residues 25-35) and carboxyl (residues 583-594) termini of ovine PGHS-1 (20.Otto J.C. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19868-19875Google Scholar) (Fig. 1); the intense bands between the 72- and 38-kDa bands seen upon silver staining of the immunoprecipitated PGHS-1 are due to IgG heavy chain. Following photolabeling of ovine vesicular gland microsomes with [125I]TID, PGHS-1 was one of the most prominently radiolabeled proteins (Fig. 1). After tryptic digestion of photolabeled PGHS-1, both the 33-kDa amino-terminal and the 38-kDa carboxyl-terminal peptides were found to be labeled by [125I]TID. This result was unexpected because the putative membrane binding domain of PGHS-1 is located near the NH2 terminus, and it was anticipated that only the 33-kDa amino-terminal tryptic peptide would be labeled by [125I]TID. To determine if the labeling of either of the tryptic peptides was due to the presence of [125I]TID in the aqueous phase, photolabeling was performed in the presence of 20 mM reduced glutathione, which scavenges any [125I]TID present in the aqueous phase(22.Brunner J. Semenza G. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 7174-7182Google Scholar). Reduced glutathione did not affect the photolabeling of either tryptic peptide of PGHS-1 (Fig. 1), indicating that the photolabeling was not due to the presence of [125I]TID in the aqueous phase. [125I]TID can nonspecifically photolabel regions of proteins present in the hydrophobic environment of the membrane; in addition, [125I]TID bound in a saturable manner to specific hydrophobic binding sites can photolabel regions of proteins which are not membrane-associated(24.Blanton M.P. Cohen J.B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2859-2872Google Scholar, 31.White B.H. Cohen J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 267: 15770-15783Google Scholar, 32.Blanton M.P. Cohen J.B. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3738-3750Google Scholar). To distinguish between these two possibilities, we examined the ability of nonradioactive TID to block photolabeling of PGHS-1 by [125I]TID. When [125I]TID labeling was performed in the presence of a 20-fold molar excess of nonradioactive TID, photolabeling of the 38-kDa carboxyl-terminal tryptic peptide of PGHS-1 was greatly diminished with little effect on the photolabeling of the 33-kDa amino-terminal tryptic peptide (Fig. 2). Silver staining established that the pretreatment of microsomes with nonradioactive TID did not affect the generation of 38- and 33-kDa tryptic fragments from PGHS-1 (data not shown). The photolabeling of the 33-kDa tryptic peptide in the presence of nonradioactive TID is consistent with the association of a region or regions of this peptide with membranes. The competition of the [125I]TID photolabeling of the 38-kDa COOH-terminal tryptic peptide by nonradioactive TID suggests that the PGHS-1 protein contains a saturable, hydrophobic binding site(s) within the 38-kDa peptide which binds [125I]TID in the absence of competitor. Thus, photolabeling of the larger 38-kDa carboxyl-terminal peptide is not consistent with the association of this peptide with the ER membrane. The cyclooxygenase active site of PGHS-1 is a hydrophobic channel which contains segments of the peptide chains found in both the 33-kDa amino-terminal tryptic peptide and in the 38-kDa carboxyl-terminal tryptic peptide(19.Picot D. Loll P.J. Garavito M. Nature. 1994; 367: 243-249Google Scholar). We reasoned that the labeling of one or both of the tryptic peptides might result from the binding of [125I]TID within the cyclooxygenase active site. A comparison of the structures of [125I]TID and several NSAIDs suggest that a hydrophobic compound such as [125I]TID could occupy the cyclooxygenase active site (Fig. 3). Accordingly, the ability of two NSAIDs, ibuprofen and sulindac sulfide, to compete for labeling of PGHS-1 by [125I]TID was examined (Fig. 4). Incubation of microsomes with ibuprofen or sulindac sulfide prior to photolabeling with [125I]TID did affect the labeling pattern seen with ovine PGHS-1, decreasing somewhat the intensities of labeling of the 33-kDa tryptic peptide and essentially eliminating the labeling of the 38-kDa tryptic peptide. Pretreatment of PGHS-1 with the NSAIDs did not affect the generation of the 38- and 33-kDa peptides as determined by silver staining (data not shown). These results suggest that much of the photolabeling of PGHS-1 by [125I]TID, particularly in the 38-kDa carboxyl-terminal tryptic peptide, is caused by the binding of [125I]TID within the cyclooxygenase active site.Figure 4:Effects of ibuprofen and sulindac sulfide on the photolabeling of ovine PGHS-1 by [125I]TID. Ovine vesicular gland microsomes were preincubated in the presence or absence of 100 μM ibuprofen or 100 μM sulindac sulfide prior to incubation and photolabeling with [125I]TID. After photolabeling, the microsomal samples were treated with trypsin and immunoprecipitated as described in the text. Immunoprecipitated PGHS-1 and PGHS-1 tryptic fragments were resolved on 15% SDS-PAGE gels, and the gels were silver stained and exposed to film for autoradiography. Lane A, no drug pretreatment; lane B, 100 μM ibuprofen pretreatment; and lane C, 100 μM sulindac sulfide pretreatment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Exhaustive digestion of [125I]TID photolabeled ovine PGHS-1 with endoproteinase Lys-C generated a 20.5-kDa peptide which was reactive with an anti-peptide antibody raised against residues 25-35 of ovine PGHS-1 (Fig. 5); in contrast, this 20.5-kDa fragment was unreactive with an anti-peptide antibody raised against residues 203-217 of ovine PGHS-1 3This antibody was prepared and characterized by L. C. Hsi and W. L. Smith (unpublished observations). (data not shown). Importantly, this 20.5-kDa peptide was radiolabeled (Fig. 5). The molecular mass and immunoreactivity are completely consistent with this peptide being an endoproteinase Lys-C fragment, 25Ala-Lys166, derived from the NH2 terminus of ovine PGHS-1. [125I]TID has been a useful tool for identifying transmembrane domains of proteins(22.Brunner J. Semenza G. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 7174-7182Google Scholar, 23.White B.H. Cohen J.B. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8741-8751Google Scholar, 24.Blanton M.P. Cohen J.B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2859-2872Google Scholar). [125I]TID partitions efficiently into membrane lipid bilayers, and photolabeling of proteins with [125I]TID occurs predominately in domains which are in direct contact with membranes(22.Brunner J. Semenza G. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 7174-7182Google Scholar). There is, however, a precedent for the incorporation of [125I]TID into regions of a protein which are not in contact with the lipid bilayer. Photolabeling of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor with [125I]TID could be partially inhibited by receptor agonists and antagonists apparently because these agents exclude [125I]TID from the receptor binding site(31.White B.H. Cohen J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 267: 15770-15783Google Scholar). In order to distinguish between the photolabeling of membrane-associated regions of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and photolabeling of the receptor binding site, [125I]TID photolabeling was performed in the presence of excess non-radioactive TID(24.Blanton M.P. Cohen J.B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2859-2872Google Scholar, 31.White B.H. Cohen J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 267: 15770-15783Google Scholar, 32.Blanton M.P. Cohen J.B. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3738-3750Google Scholar). The reasoning behind these experiments was that nonradioactive TID would compete with [125I]TID for saturable binding sites, whereas nonradioactive TID could not compete for photolabeling of membrane-associated domains because the membranes could not be saturated with TID at submillimolar levels(24.Blanton M.P. Cohen J.B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2859-2872Google Scholar, 31.White B.H. Cohen J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 267: 15770-15783Google Scholar, 32.Blanton M.P. Cohen J.B. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3738-3750Google Scholar). We have found that [125I]TID is a useful probe for analyzing the structure of ovine PGHS-1. The photolabeling of ovine PGHS-1 is similar to that of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor in that PGHS-1 was photolabeled by [125I]TID in both a nonspecific manner consistent with the association of regions of the enzyme with the ER membrane and in a specific manner consistent with the occupation of a hydrophobic pocket in the enzyme by [125I]TID. Our data suggest that a region of ovine PGHS-1 contained in the NH2-terminal 277 amino acids is associated with the ER membrane and that the COOH-terminal half of the enzyme does not contain a membrane-associated region. Additionally, a peptide composed of residues 25-166 of ovine PGHS-1 is photolabeled by [125I]TID, although we have not proven unequivocally that the labeling occurs specifically in the putative membrane binding domain encompassing residues 70-117. Our data are consistent with the prediction that residues 70-117 form a novel membrane binding domain (19.Picot D. Loll P.J. Garavito M. Nature. 1994; 367: 243-249Google Scholar, 21.Picot D. Garavito R.M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 346: 21-25Google Scholar). Examination of peptides photolabeled by [125I]TID in the presence of nonradioactive TID and NSAIDs by amino acid sequencing will provide a valuable test of this prediction and should allow for the determination of which amino acids of PGHS are important for membrane association. The ability of both nonradioactive TID, ibuprofen, and sulindac sulfide to block photolabeling of the COOH-terminal half of PGHS-1 by [125I]TID suggests that [125I]TID can photolabel the cyclooxygenase active site of PGHS-1. Thus, [125I]TID may also be useful for identifying amino acids which are exposed in the hydrophobic cyclooxygenase pocket. Furthermore, because [125I]TID labeling can be performed with membrane-associated enzyme, this labeling procedure may be used with the membrane-bound enzyme to test predictions made from the crystal structure of detergent-solubilized PGHS-1. Finally, [125I]TID may prove to be a valuable tool for comparing structural differences between the cyclooxygenase active sites of PGHS-1 and −2.

In this report, we show that an ecto-(Ca2+,Mg2+)-apyrase activity is present on EBV-transformed B cells, but not on B or T lymphomas. The coincidence between CD39 expression and ecto-apyrase activity on immune cells suggests that CD39 may be an ecto-apyrase. This supposition is supported by the observation that the amino acid sequence of CD39 is significantly homologous to those of several newly identified nucleotide triphosphatases. Finally, we show that CD39 indeed has ecto-apyrase activity by expression in COS-7 cells.

Cytol. 1995; 158: 1-61Google Scholar)) are glycoproteins that hydrolyze extracellular nucleotide tri- and/or diphosphates. These enzymes have a high specificity activity and are insensitive to inhibitors of P-type, F-type, and V-type ATPases(2.Lin S.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14403-14407Google Scholar, 3.Lin S.-H.

Progress in the study of ecto-apyrases has been impeded by the lack of a specific inhibitor of enzymatic activity and by their low protein abundance. Moreover, most ecto-apyrases are inactivated by the detergents normally used to solubilize membrane-bound proteins. Recently, Handa and Guidotti (6.Handa M. Guidotti G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 916-923Google Scholar) reported that a potato tuber (Solanum tuberosum) apyrase was similar in amino acid sequence to CD39, a human and mouse lymphoid cell antigen(7.Maliszewski C.R.

In this report, we show that EBV-transformed B lymphocytes have ecto-apyrase activity, whereas non-EBV-transformed B lymphocytes do not. Ecto-apyrase activities were also found associated with other immunocompetent cells, including cytotoxic T cells (16.Fillipini A. Taffa R.E. Agui T. Sitkovsky M.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 267: 16081-16087Google Scholar) and natural killer (NK) cells(4.Dombrowski W.E. Trevilyan J.M. Cone J.C. Lu Y. Phillips C.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6515-6522Google Scholar), but not with resting thymocytes and lymphomas (4.Dombrowski W.E. Trevilyan J.M. Cone J.C. Lu Y. Phillips C.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6515-6522Google Scholar, 17.Barankiewicz J. Dosch H.-M. Cohen A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7094-7098Google Scholar, 18.Barankiewicz J. Cohn A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1990; 603: 380-393Google Scholar). Both in our studies and those of other investigators, there is a coincidence between expression of CD39 and ecto-apyrase activity. All these clues lead to the hypothesis that CD39 may encode an ecto-apyrase. Finally, by transfection of COS-7 cells with CD39 cDNA, we show that CD39 indeed has ecto-apyrase activity. Nucleotides, N-ethylmaleimide, ouabain, activated charcoal, DEAE-dextran, chloroquine, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse antibody, and nitrocellulose membrane were purchased from Sigma. [γ-32P]ATP (triethylammonium salt) was purchased from DuPont NEN Research Products. RPMI 1640, penicillin/streptomycin, DMEM, and L-glutamine were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Anti-CD39 monoclonal antibody AC-2 (7.Maliszewski C.R. Delespesse G.J.T. Schoenborn M.A. Armitage R.J. Fanslow W.C. Nakajima T. Baker E. Sutherland G.R. Poindexter K. Birks C. Alpert A. Friend D.

EBV-transformed B-lymphoblasts from a patient with cystic fibrosis (GM7227A) were from the Coriel Institute for Medical Research (Camden, NJ)(19.Chen H. Schulman H. Garder P. Science. 1989; 243: 657-660Google Scholar). Human T leukemia Jurkat cells, EBV-transformed B lymphoblast LG2 cells, murine T lymphoma BW5147 cells, and B lymphoma A20 and Daudi cells were kindly provided by Dr. Basya Ryalov (Dept. of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Harvard University). All immune cells were maintained in medium RPMI 1640. COS-7 cells were kept at 50-70% confluence in DMEM. All cultures were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 mM glutamine, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). Apyrase activity was determined by measuring the amount of [32P]Pi released from [γ-32P]ATP after precipitation of nucleotides with activated charcoal(4.Dombrowski W.E. Trevilyan J.M. Cone J.C. Lu Y. Phillips C.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6515-6522Google Scholar, 20.Reddy N.B. Oliver K.L. Festoff B.W. Engle W.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 540: 371-388Google Scholar). Intact cells (1 × 105) or cell homogenates were added to buffer containing 20 mM HEPES-Tris (pH 7.4), 120 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1 mM EGTA, 0.3 mM ATP, and 0.8 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP; the final volume was 200 μl. Cell extracts were obtained by homogenizing cells in the buffer with a Dounce homogenizer. The assay mixture was incubated at 37°C for 20 min, and then the reaction was stopped by the addition of 0.5 ml of cold 20% (w/v) activated charcoal in 1.0 M HCl. The assay tubes were incubated on ice for 10 min and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min to pellet the charcoal. Aliquots (140 μl) of the supernatant containing the released [32P]Pi were transferred to scintillation fluid, and radioactivity was measured by using a Beckman LS5801 liquid scintillation spectrophotometer. Alternatively, the apyrase activity was determined by measuring the inorganic phosphate released as described by Ames(21.Ames B.N. Methods Enzymol. 1966; 8: 115-117Google Scholar), except that the time for color development was 20 min at 37°C. All assays were performed in triplicate and reported as the mean and standard deviation. The Ca2+- or Mg2+-stimulated apyrase was determined by subtracting values obtained with EGTA alone from those with 1.5 mM CaCl2 or MgCl2 plus chelator. Total RNA was isolated from approximately 107 human EBV-transformed B lymphocytes (LG2) by the acid guanidinium thiocyanate method(22.Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Google Scholar). One microgram of total RNA served as template for cDNA synthesis by avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 60 min at 42°C in the presence of 25 pmol of a specific 30-base oligonucleotide as primer in a total reaction of 20 μl(23.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The reverse transcription primer was the same one as the antisense primer to be used in the subsequent PCR reaction. The whole reverse transcription mixture was then used as template in 35 cycles of amplification. The sense primer (5′-GCGAATTCTTATGGAAGATACAAAGGAGTC), with an EcoRI site at the 5′ end, contains a sequence identical with nucleotides 68-87 of human CD39(7.Maliszewski C.R. Delespesse G.J.T. Schoenborn M.A. Armitage R.J. Fanslow W.C. Nakajima T. Baker E. Sutherland G.R. Poindexter K. Birks C. Alpert A. Friend D. Gimpel S.D. Gayle III, R.B. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 3574-3583Google Scholar). The antisense primer (5′-GCTGAATTCGCTATACCATATCTTTCCAGA) is complementary to nucleotides 1581-1600 of the CD39 coding sequence, except that an EcoRI site is present. After amplification, the PCR product (1.6 kilobases) was subcloned into pCI-neo (Promega). COS-7 cells were transfected with cDNA for CD39 or with the pCI-neo vector alone by the DEAE-dextran method(24.Lopata M.A. Cleveland D.M. Sollner-Webb B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 5707-5717Google Scholar). The cells were seeded for 2 days before transfection at a density of 1700 cells per cm2. On the day of transfection, the cells were washed twice with DMEM. Then, DMEM containing 10% Nuserum, 0.4 mg/ml DEAE-dextran, and chloroquine (100 μM) was added. DNA was added at a concentration of 1.25 μg/ml, and the cells were incubated for 4 h at 37°C with 5% CO2. Afterward, the cells were washed once with DMEM, shocked for 2 min in 10% dimethyl sulfoxide in phosphate-buffered saline and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were incubated in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum at 37°C with 5% CO2. After 2 to 3 days, cells were detached by adding 10 mM EDTA and then incubated at 37°C for 20 min. The detached cells were pooled, centrifuged, washed twice with assay buffer, and assayed for calcium-dependent ecto-apyrase activity. Cells extracts (10 or 50 μg) were resolved by 9% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for 2 h at 500 mA. Membranes were washed in rinse buffer (phosphate-buffered saline with 3% Tween 20) at room temperature for 15 min and incubated overnight at 4°C with AC2 anti-CD39 mAb (0.2 μg/ml) in rinse buffer. The membranes were washed three times with rinse buffer at room temperature and were incubated with a 1:2000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse antibody in rinse buffer for 1.5 h at room temperature. After three washes, membranes were developed with chemiluminescent reagents, and the emitted light was recorded by x-ray film. Human EVB-transformed B lymphocytes LG2 and GM7227A were incubated in the standard reaction buffer with [γ-32P]ATP in the presence of 1 mM NaN3 and 0.5 mM Na3VO4 for 20 min. After charcoal precipitation of the nucleotides, the released [γ-32P]Pi in the supernatant represents the apyrase activity. The hydrolysis of [γ-32P]ATP was linear for at least 25 min, and no radioactivity was released above background levels in assays containing no cells. Fig. 1A (left panel) shows the time course of Ca2+- and Mg2+-stimulated apyrase activity of intact LG2 cells. In the absence of a divalent cation, almost no hydrolysis of ATP was detected, whereas both Ca2+ and Mg2+ stimulated the activity. At the end of the incubation, cells were intact (>90%) as demonstrated by exclusion of trypan blue. Disruption of LG2 cells by homogenization in a Dounce homogenizer did not increase either Ca2+- or Mg2+-apyrase activity (right panel), suggesting that the (Ca2+,Mg2+)-apyrase activity was probably associated with the external surface of the plasma membrane. The release of Pi from EBV-transformed LG2 and GM7227A cells was 349 ± 8 and 218 ± 10 nmol per million cells per 20 min, respectively. To examine whether this hydrolytic activity was due to secreted enzymes or an intracellular enzyme released through “leaky” membrane, cells were incubated for 30 min in assay buffer without ATP and pelleted. Apyrase activity in the supernatant was less than 5% of the total apyrase activity, whereas the cell pellet contained more than 90% of the total apyrase activity. These results indicated the presence of a membrane-associated ecto-apyrase in EBV-transformed B lymphocytes. To further characterize the observed apyrase activity, assays were done with human T leukemia Jurkat cells (ecto-apyrase-deficient(18.Barankiewicz J. Cohn A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1990; 603: 380-393Google Scholar)), African Burkitt lymphoma Daudi cells, murine T lymphoma BW5147 cells, and murine B lymphoma A20 cells. The apyrase activities of these cells were not statistically elevated above the background level (Fig. 1B). Table 1 shows that inhibitors of P-type plasma membrane ATPases (ouabain and vanadate), V-type vacuolar ATPase (N-ethylmaleimide), and F-type mitochondrial ATPase (azide), did not significantly inhibit the EBV-transformed LG2 ecto-apyrase activity. Furthermore, 10 mM fluoride (a phosphatase inhibitor) was not inhibitory. The nucleotide specificity of the LG2 (Ca2+,Mg2+)-apyrase activity is shown in Table 2. The relative hydrolysis rates of the nucleotide triphosphates is about the same, while the rate with ADP is about 60% of that with ATP. No phosphate was released from AMP (substrate of 5′-nucleotidase) and p-nitrophenyl phosphate (substrate of alkaline phosphatase). These results suggest that the (Ca2+,Mg2+)-apyrase activity of EBV-transformed LG2 cells is typical of an E-type ATPase.Tabled 1Tabled 1 -CD39 was originally identified as a surface antigen of EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cells(12.Rowe M. Hildreth J.E.K. Rickinson A.B. Epstein M.A. Int. J. Cancer. 1982; 29: 373-381Google Scholar). CD39 is not encoded by the EBV genome, but is a host gene. Epitope-tagging and topologic analysis indicated that CD39 has a large extracellular loop between short intracellular N and C termini. The large extracellular loop was similar in amino acid sequence to yeast guanosine phosphatase, indicating that CD39 may encode an ecto-enzyme(7.Maliszewski C.R. Delespesse G.J.T. Schoenborn M.A. Armitage R.J. Fanslow W.C. Nakajima T. Baker E. Sutherland G.R. Poindexter K. Birks C. Alpert A. Friend D. Gimpel S.D. Gayle III, R.B. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 3574-3583Google Scholar). Later, CD39 was found primarily on activated immune cells, but was absent from resting thymocytes, lymphocytes, and lymphomas. In both our studies and those of other investigators, there is a coincidence between the expression pattern of CD39 and ecto-apyrase activity (Table 3). CD39 was only found in cells with ecto-apyrase activity, suggesting that CD39 may encode an ecto-apyrase.Tabled 1 Since detergent solubilization is a major problem in purification of many ecto-apyrases and LG2 cells lost more than 90% of the ecto-apyrase activity after solubilization with C12E9 or Triton X-100, we decided to test whether CD39 encoded an ecto-apyrase by expression. Human CD39 cDNA was amplified by reverse transcription-PCR and subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pCI-neo. COS-7 cells transfected with CD39 recombinant cDNA had about 5.4-fold higher Ca2+-ATPase activity (309 ± 27.6 nmol/mg/h) than cells transfected with vector alone (57.6 ± 4.8 nmol/mg/h) (Fig. 2A). This activity was not inhibited by P- or V-type ATPase inhibitors, since 1 mM NaN3 and 0.5 mM Na3VO4 were included in the reaction buffer. Cells extracts (50 μg) of both preparations were examined for the presence of CD39 by Western analysis (Fig. 2B). Cells transfected with recombinant CD39 cDNA had 5-fold more CD39 protein (lane 2) as compared with cells transfected with vector alone (lane 1), estimated by comparison with the amount of CD39 protein in 10 μg (lane 3) and 50 μg (lane 4) of protein from extracts of LG2 cells. This paper reports that CD39 is an ecto-apyrase. Four lines of evidence support this conclusion. First, the amino acid sequence of CD39 is significantly homologous to several newly identified NTPases. Second, the coincidence of the expression pattern of CD39 and ecto-apyrase activities on immunocompetent cells is consistent with the hypothesis that CD39 is an ecto-apyrase. Third, ecto-apyrase activities were found on EBV-transformed B lymphocytes that express CD39 as a major surface marker(12.Rowe M. Hildreth J.E.K. Rickinson A.B. Epstein M.A. Int. J. Cancer. 1982; 29: 373-381Google Scholar). No ecto-apyrase activity was found on non-EBV-transformed B lymphoma cell lines. Finally, expression of CD39 cDNA in COS-7 cells increases their ecto-apyrase activity at least 5-fold. CD39 is expressed on activated NK cells, B cells, and T cell clones, but is not expressed by resting blood T, B, or NK cells, neutrophils, or monocytes. CD39 expression in lymphoid tissue is primarily limited to mantle zone and paracortical lymphocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells and is generally absent from germinal centers(13.Kansas G.S. Wood G.S. Tedder T.F. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 2235-2244Google Scholar). Because CD39 encodes an ecto-apyrase, the restriction of its expression to activated lymphoid cells and in anatomical sites of ongoing B cell differentiation suggests that ecto-apyrase activity may play an important role in immune responses. One possible role of an ecto-apyrase in immune cells is to protect them from potential lytic effects of extracellular ATP released by their target cells(16.Fillipini A. Taffa R.E. Agui T. Sitkovsky M.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 267: 16081-16087Google Scholar, 25.Di Virgilio F. Immunol. Today. 1995; 16: 524-528Google Scholar). Extracellular ATP can induce cell death in many immune cells and a few tumor cell lines. ATP4- binds to P2z purinergic receptors and causes the opening of a nonselective membrane pore, which has a molecular cut-off of approximately 0.9 kDa(26.Di Virgilio F. Bronte V. Collavo D. Zanovello P. J. Immunol. 1989; 143: 1955-1960Google Scholar). By measuring ATP-induced uptake of extracellular markers of less than 0.9 kDa, P2z receptors were found on most immune cells and some tumor cell lines. Because of the relative high dose of extracellular ATP needed for P2z receptor activation (half-maximal effective concentration, EC50, varies from 100 μM to 1 mM), Di Virgilio (25.Di Virgilio F. Immunol. Today. 1995; 16: 524-528Google Scholar) proposed that “leakage ATP” from the cytoplasm of stressed or injured cells was the most likely source for extracellular ATP and such an event was likely to occur at the site of inflammatory or immune responses. Hydrolysis of extracellular ATP by plasma membrane ecto-(Ca2+,Mg2+)-apyrases leads to closure of the P2z receptor pores(27.Di Virgilio F. Steinberg T.H. Cell and Tissue Culture: Laboratory Procedures. 5B. John Wiley and Sons, New York1993: 4.1-4.8Google Scholar). Interestingly, persistent treatment with low doses of interleukin-2 can induce CD39 expression in T cell and NK cell in vivo(15.Deunsing S. Kirsher H. Atzpodien J. Blood. 1994; 83: 3826-3827Google Scholar); in mouse splenocytes this treatment causes resistance to extracellular ATP (28.Zanovello P. Bronte V. Pizzo P. Di Virgilio F. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 1545-1550Google Scholar, 29.Zheng L.M. Zychlinsky A. Liu C.-C. Ojcius D.M. Young J.D.-E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 279-288Google Scholar, 30.Pizzo P. Murgia M. Zambon A. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 2278-3372Google Scholar). Ecto-apyrase activities have been found not only in the immune system, but also in many other tissues. The broad distribution of ecto-apyrase activity suggests that it may have essential functions. Unfortunately, the molecular structure and function of ecto-apyrases in those tissues are largely unknown. At least three hypotheses for the roles of ecto-apyrase have been suggested. One function might be hydrolysis of ATP and other nucleotides to terminates their roles as P2-purinergic ligands (reviewed in (31.Dubyak G.R. El-Motassim C. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 34: C577-C606Google Scholar)). Secondly, ecto-apyrases may have a principal role in the formation of AMP by hydrolysis of both ADP and ATP(32.Lin S.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 10976-10980Google Scholar). Extracellular AMP can be converted by ecto-5′-nucleotidase to adenosine, a ligand of P1 receptors(33.Zimmermann H. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 345-365Google Scholar, 34.Olah M.E. Stiles G.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1995; 35: 518-606Google Scholar). Both ATP and adenosine modulate a variety of key cellular processes in many tissues and organs. A third possibility is the cooperation of ecto-apyrase and 5′-nucleotidase activities with a sodium-dependent adenosine cotransporter in rat liver canalicular membranes to convert extracellular ATP to intracellular adenosine leading to conservation of the purine(9.Chen M. Nishida T. Gatmaitan Z. Arias I.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9684-9688Google Scholar). We wonder whether CD39 or similar genes may correspond to ecto-apyrase activities in nonimmune tissues. Although CD39 was also found in endothelium (13.Kansas G.S. Wood G.S. Tedder T.F. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 2235-2244Google Scholar) and human placenta, 3L. Hillier, N. Clark, T. Dubuque, K. Elliston, M. Hawkins, M. Holman, M. Hultman, T. Kucaba, M. Le, G. Lennon, M. Marra, J. Parson, L. Rifkin, T. Rohlfing, M. Soares, F. Tan, E. Trevaskis, R. Waterston, A. Williamson, P. Wohldmann, and R. Wilson, Direct submission, GenBank™ accession numbers H13211 and H13577. the expression pattern of CD39 in other nonimmune tissues has not been established. In summary, our results show the CD39 encodes an ecto-(Ca2+,Mg2+)-apyrase. This is the first identification of a mammalian ecto-apyrase gene. Further analysis of CD39 may help in the understanding of the structure and function of other ecto-apyrases. We thank Masahisa Handa for the information about the sequence similarity between the potato apyrase and CD39, Dr. Yi-Ping Hsueh for her expert advice concerning immune cell culture and for reading this manuscript, and Dr. Basya Ryalov for kindly providing the immune cell lines."
https://openalex.org/W1545964478,"Exposure of neonatal rat cardiac myocytes to ouabain concentrations that caused partial inhibition of Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase but no loss of viability, increased c-<i>fos</i> and c-<i>jun</i> mRNAs and the transcription factor AP-1.

Induction of c-<i>fos</i> by ouabain was prevented when either extracellular or intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> was lowered and was attenuated by pretreatment of myocytes with a phorbol ester under conditions known to down-regulate protein kinase C. Exposure to ouabain for 24-48 h also increased total transcriptional activity and protein content of myocytes. The findings suggest that the same signal responsible for the positive inotropic action of ouabain, <i>i.e.</i> net influx of Ca<sup>2+</sup> caused by partial inhibition of Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase, also initiates the rapid protein kinase C-dependent inductions of the early-response genes, the subsequent regulations of other cardiac genes by the resulting transcription factors, and stimulation of myocyte growth. Whether these hitherto unrecognized effects of cardiac glycosides are obtained in the intact heart and their relevance to the therapeutic uses of these drugs remain to be determined."

In this study, we characterized the structure-specific junction-cutting activities of both nucleases using DNA substrates containing a bubble or loop structure. We found that the junction-cutting activities of XPF-ERCC1 and XPG were greatly stimulated by human replication protein A (RPA), while heterologous single-stranded DNA-binding proteins could not substitute for human RPA. To test for specific interaction between RPA and XPF-ERCC1 as is known to occur between RPA and XPG, we employed a pull-down assay with immobilized “bubble” substrate. We found that the binding of XPF-ERCC1 complex to the bubble substrate was enhanced by RPA, suggesting a possible mechanism for RPA in the excision nuclease system, that is the targeting of the nuclease subunits to their specific sites of action. Furthermore, the RPA-promoted junction cutting by XPF-ERCC1 and XPG nucleases was observed with “loop” substrates as well, raising the possibility that XPF-ERCC1, XPG, and RPA may function in removing loop structures from DNA, independent of the other subunits of the human excinuclease.

INTRODUCTIONNucleotide excision repair is a general repair system that plays an important role in maintaining genetic integrity(1.Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar, 2.Sancar A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 43-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar). This repair system removes damaged nucleotides from DNA by dual incisions on both sides of the lesion in the damaged strand(3.Huang J.C. Svoboda D.L. Reardon J.T. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3664-3668Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Recently, the human and the highly homologous yeast nucleotide excision repair systems have been reconstituted from extensively purified proteins, which demonstrated that 14-15 polypeptides comprising replication protein A (RPA, 1The abbreviations used are: RPAreplication protein Antnucleotide(s)SSBsingle-stranded DNA-binding protein. also known as HSSB or RF-A) and the general transcription factor, TFIIH, in addition to XP and ERCC proteins were essential for the dual incision step(4.Mu D.

XPG was reported to possess a single-stranded DNA endonuclease activity (7.O'Donovan A. Scherly D. Clarkson S.G. Wood R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15965-15968Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Habraken Y. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S.

Chem. 1994; 269: 31342-31345Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, it was found that XPF-ERCC1 had a single strand-specific endonuclease activity and a weak activity on double-stranded UV-irradiated DNA, which was stimulated by RPA(10.Park C.-H. Bessho T. Matsunaga T. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22657-22660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been reported that the RAD1-RAD10 complex (11.Bardwell A.J. Bardwell L. Tomkinson A.E. Friedberg E.C. Science. 1994; 265: 2082-2085Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), the yeast counterpart of the human XPF-ERCC1 nuclease, and XPG nuclease (12.O'Donovan A. Davies A.A. Moggs J.G. West S.C. Wood R.D. Nature. 1994; 371: 432-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar) have structure-specific junction-cutting activities with unique polarities. These results obtained with the model “undamaged” substrates suggested that XPF-ERCC1 and XPG were the 5′- and 3′-endonucleases of the dual incisions, respectively. A recent study using damaged DNA and specific antibodies supported this model (13.Matsunaga T. Mu D. Park C.-H. Reardon J.T. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20862-20869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar).Recently, it has been reported that RPA, which is absolutely required for dual incisions(4.Mu D.

Chem. 1995; 270: 2415-2418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar), specifically binds to XPA protein and XPG nuclease(14.He Z. Henricksen L.A. Wold M.S. Ingles C.J. Nature. 1995; 374: 566-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). These findings raised the possibility that RPA may play an important role in recognizing DNA lesions and then targeting the nuclease subunits of human excision nuclease system to their proper sites. Hence, we decided to investigate the effect of RPA on the nuclease subunits in the absence of other components of excision nuclease.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESDNA SubstratesStructures of DNA substrates used in this study were schematically drawn in Fig. 1a. The sequence of the top strand of each substrate was identical: 5′-CCTGCCTAGGATCCAGTAGTCGACTTGGACGAACCCGGGATGGAATGGAGTATTCGCCGTGTCCATGGCTGTAAGTATCCAGGATCCCGG-3′. This top strand oligomer (90-mer) was 5′- or 3′-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [α-32P]ATP or terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase and [α-32P]dideoxy-ATP, respectively, and gel-purified. Hence, the size of the 3′-labeled top strand was 91-mer. After annealing with respective bottom strand oligomers, double-stranded DNAs with or without a bubble/loop structure were purified using non-denaturing 8% polyacrylamide gels. The sequences of bottom strands were: DS, 5′-CCGGGATCCTGGATACTTACAGCCATGGACACGGCGAATACTCCATTCCATCCCGGGTTCGTCCAAGTCGACTACTGGATCCTAGGCAGG-3′ (90-mer); B12, 5′-CCGGGATCCTGGATACTTACAGCCATATCAGTTACGCCTACTCCATTCCATCCCGGGTTCGTCCAAGTCGACTACTGGATCCTAGGCAGG-3′ (90-mer); B30, 5′-CCGGGATCCTGGATACTTACAGCCATATCAGTTACGCCAGTATGCCGATGCTATAAGTTCGTCCAAGTCGACTACTGGATCCTAGGCAGG-3′ (90-mer); L12, 5′-CCGGGATCCTGGATACTTACAGCCATGGACACGGCGAATCCCGGGTTCGTCCAAGTCGACTACTGGATCCTAGGCAGG-3′ (78-mer); L30, 5′CCGGGATCCTGGATACTTACAGCCATGTTCGTCCAAGTCGACTACTGGATCCTAGGCAGG-3′ (60-mer). Mismatched bases in the bubble substrates are underlined. Five femtomoles of the labeled substrates per nuclease reaction were used in all experiments in this study.ProteinsThe XPA cDNA tagged with 6 × histidine using pRSET vector (Invitrogen) was overexpressed in Escherichia coli DR153 strain (15.Park C.-H. Sancar A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5110-5116Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and purified by a modified procedure of Jones and Wood(16.Jones C.J. Wood R.D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12096-12104Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). The DNA construct bearing the three-subunit human RPA was obtained from Dr. M. Wold (University of Iowa), and the recombinant RPA was expressed in E. coli and purified according to Henricksen et al.(17.Henricksen L.A. Umbricht C.B. Wold M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11121-11132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purification of XPF-ERCC1 complex was carried out as described previously(10.Park C.-H. Bessho T. Matsunaga T. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22657-22660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were ~4 ng/μl (the heparin-agarose column fraction), ~10 ng/μl (the DEAE-column fraction), and 33 ng/μl (the XPA-affinity column fraction).XPG protein was overexpressed in a baculovirus/insect cell system using pVL1392-XPG/Baculogold viral DNA (Pharmingen) and SF21 cells and extensively purified by a modified procedure of O'Donovan et al.(7.O'Donovan A. Scherly D. Clarkson S.G. Wood R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15965-15968Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, after separation on a phosphocellulose column, XPG-containing fractions identified by Western blotting were loaded onto an Affi-Gel blue (Bio-Rad) column. The column was extensively washed with buffer A (25 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol) containing 150 mM KCl and subsequently with buffer A containing 1 M KCl. Final elution was achieved with a linear gradient of NaSCN (0.5-1.5 M) in buffer A. XPG fractions were dialyzed against storage buffer (25 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 100 mM KCl, 12 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM EDTA, 2 mM dithiothreitol, and 17% glycerol) and used in most of the experiments. For further purification, the elution fractions from the Affi-Gel blue column were dialyzed against buffer A containing 1 M (NH4)2SO4 and loaded onto a phenyl-Superose column (HR 5/5, Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). After extensive washing, XPG was eluted with a linear gradient of (NH4)2SO4 (0.6-0 M) in buffer A and dialyzed against storage buffer. The purified XPG protein was active for complementing repair deficiency of UV135 (ERCC-5 = XP-G) cell-free extract in an excision assay (3.Huang J.C. Svoboda D.L. Reardon J.T. Sancar A. Proc. Natl.

The products were analyzed on denaturing 10% polyacrylamide gels, and the level of incision was quantified by PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics).Pull-down Assay Using Immobilized DNAThe top strand oligomer of the substrates shown in Fig. 1a was 3′-labeled with biotin-16-dideoxy-UTP using terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase according to the manufacturer's protocol (Boehringer Mannheim). DS and B30 substrates were prepared as described above. Five μg of Dynabeads M-280 streptavidin (Dynal) was incubated at 30°C for 1 h with the biotin-labeled DS or B30 substrates (400 ng) in nuclease reaction buffer and washed with the same buffer three times using a magnetic particle concentrator (Dynal). Immobilized substrate DNAs were incubated at 4°C for 3 h with rocking, with RPA, XPA, XPF-ERCC1 (the XPA-affinity column fraction that contained 330 ng/μl protein), or a combination of these proteins as indicated, in 50 μl of nuclease reaction buffer containing 3 mM CaCl2, in place of MgCl2, to inhibit the nuclease activity of XPF-ERCC1 (10.Park C.-H. Bessho T. Matsunaga T. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22657-22660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and 1% bovine serum albumin to reduce nonspecific binding of proteins to the magnetic beads. The purified beads were mixed with SDS-loading buffer and heated. The bound fractions were separated on a 10% polyacrylamide SDS gel, and Western blotting was carried out using standard procedure.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONTo study the effect of RPA on XPF-ERCC1 and XPG, we constructed substrates with 12- or 30-nt mismatched bases (bubble), or deleted nucleotides in the bottom strand (loop) (Fig. 1a). The substrates were labeled 5′ or 3′ and characterized with respect to single-strandedness by S1 nuclease digestion. From the specific degradation by S1 nuclease, it is evident that the substrates used in our study contained no secondary structures in the bubble and loop regions (Fig. 1b). RPA, which has high affinity for single-stranded DNA, specifically bound to the 30-nt bubble or loop region (Fig. 1c) and protected it from DNase I (Fig. 1d); it also bound to the 12-nt bubble and loop with less affinity (data not shown), in agreement with the report that a 30-nt-long single-stranded DNA is the minimum size for binding of RPA with high affinity(18.Kim C. Paulus B.F. Wold M.S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14197-14206Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar).XPF-ERCC1 is a single strand-specific endonuclease, which also nicks UV-irradiated supercoiled DNA in an RPA-stimulated reaction(10.Park C.-H. Bessho T. Matsunaga T. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22657-22660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it was found that the XPF-ERCC1 complex purified through the XPA-affinity column step contained a junction-cutting activity, which was not obvious in the purer fractions (the DEAE and the heparin-agarose fractions) (Fig. 2a). We reasoned that some other protein(s) present in the XPA-column fraction might have conferred the junction-cutting activity to XPF-ERCC1 detected with this fraction. Since RPA binds to these model substrates, we tested RPA for conferring the junction-cutting activity to the DEAE and the heparin-agarose fractions (Fig. 2b). In the absence of additional protein(s), the purer XPF-ERCC1 fractions have a weak single-stranded nuclease activity, which generates a ladder in the area of single strandedness (Fig. 2b, lanes 1, 4, and 8). The addition of RPA suppresses the nonspecific endonuclease activity while conferring a specific junction-cutting activity upon the nuclease enabling it to hydrolyze the strand which enters the bubble region in the 5′ to 3′ direction at the fourth phosphodiester bond before entering the junction (Fig. 2b, lanes 2, 3, 6, and 9). RPA also stimulated the junction-cutting activity of the XPA-column fraction (see below). In contrast, XPA, which is known to interact with XPF-ERCC1(19.Park C.-H. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5017-5021Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), does not affect the single-stranded DNA endonuclease activity (Fig. 2b, lanes 5 and 10) and has no significant effect on the RPA-conferred junction-cutting activity of XPF-ERCC1 (Fig. 2b, lanes 7 and 11). Importantly, RPA failed to confer a junction-cutting activity to the S1 nuclease (Fig. 2c), indicating that the RPA-promoted junction-cutting activity is not caused by covering the bubble with RPA and leaving only the single-stranded junction region open for a nonspecific single-stranded DNA endonuclease. The junction-cutting activity of XPF-ERCC1 was dependent on RPA concentration, and 40 ng of RPA per reaction stimulated the activity about 64-fold (Fig. 2d). We wished to know the DNA structure requirements for the RPA-stimulated junction-cutting activity. As shown in Fig. 2e, the junction-cutting activity of the XPA-column fraction is greatly stimulated by RPA, and a smaller (12-nt) bubble structure is incised in the same way as the 30-nt bubble although with lower efficiency (lanes 1-3 compared with lanes 4-6). Interestingly, similar results were obtained with loop structures. Both the 12- and 30-nt loop substrates were incised in a manner similar to the bubble substrates (lanes 7-12).Figure 2Stimulation of junction-cutting activities of XPF-ERCC1 by RPA. a, nuclease activities of various XPF-ERCC1 chromatographic fractions on the bubble substrate. 5′-Labeled B30 substrate was incubated at 37°C for 90 min with 2 μl of buffer only (lane 1), the XPA-affinity column fraction (lane 2), the DEAE-column fraction (lane 3), or the heparin-agarose column fraction (lane 4). b, effects of RPA and XPA on a junction-cutting activity of XPF-ERCC1. 5′-Labeled (lanes 1-7) or 3′-labeled (lanes 8-11) B30 substrates were preincubated on ice for 10 min with no protein (lanes 1, 4, and 8), 10 ng of RPA (lanes 3, 6, and 9), 20 ng of RPA (lane 2), 10 ng of XPA (lanes 5 and 10), or 10 ng of XPA and 10 ng of RPA (lanes 7 and 11) prior to the incubation with 1 μl of the heparin-agarose column fraction (lanes 1-3) or the DEAE-column fraction (lanes 4-11) of XPF-ERCC1. In addition to the products caused by the XPF-ERCC1 junction-cutting activity, smaller fragments were reproducibly obtained with 5′-labeled substrates (lanes 2, 3, 6, and 7). These fragments might be by-products of XPF-ERCC1 junction cutting followed by 3′ → 5′ exonucleolytic degradation. However, it is not clear whether this exonuclease activity is intrinsic to XPF-ERCC1. Minor effects of XPA on the RPA-promoted junction-cutting activity (lanes 7 and 11) are due to experimental variability, because it has not been reproduced in repeated experiments. c, effects of RPA on the S1 nuclease activity. 5′-Labeled B30 substrate was preincubated on ice for 30 min with no protein (lane 1), the indicated amounts of RPA (lanes 2 and 3), or E. coli SSB (lanes 4 and 5), followed by the addition of S1 nuclease. d, titration of the RPA-conferred junction-cutting activity.

Nature. 1995; 374: 566-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Fig. 3a shows the effects of RPA on the XPG junction-cutting activity with the 30-nt bubble and loop substrates. Under our experimental conditions, a very weak junction-cutting activity of XPG was observed with both substrates (~1% incision) (Fig. 3a, lanes 1 and 7), which is specific for the junction with entering the bubble/loop region in 3′ to 5′ direction. Addition of RPA stimulated the junction-cutting activity in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 3a, lanes 2-6 and 8-11), although the optimal RPA concentration and the major incision sites were different between the two substrates. The junction-cutting activity stimulated by RPA can be inhibited by anti-XPG antibodies (Fig. 3b). We failed to detect a significant XPG junction-cutting activity with smaller (12-nt) bubble and loop substrates under these conditions (data not shown).Figure 3Stimulation of junction-cutting activities of XPG by RPA. a, effects of RPA on junction-cutting activity of XPG.

M, size markers (ϕX174/HinfI). Note that the apparent higher level of XPG-directed cutting with L30-3′ than with L30-5′ is due to the higher specific radioactivity of the L30-3′ substrate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)These results, taken together, support a model of excision nuclease reaction where RPA may stabilize the unwound DNA region (presumably caused by TFIIH helicase activity) and recruit the two nucleases, XPF-ERCC1 and XPG, to their proper sites through physical interactions as is known to occur between RPA and XPG(14.He Z. Henricksen L.A. Wold M.S. Ingles C.J. Nature. 1995; 374: 566-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). In fact, consistent with this model, neither E. coli single-stranded DNA-binding protein (SSB) (Fig. 2d, lane 6 and Fig. 3a, lane 12) nor yeast RPA (data not shown) could stimulate the junction-cutting activities of the two human nucleases, and human RPA did not stimulate nonspecific endonuclease activities of XPG and XPF-ERCC1 on single-stranded DNA substrate (data not shown). However, direct interaction between RPA and XPF-ERCC1 has not been reported so far, despite the known interactions of XPA with RPA (14.He Z. Henricksen L.A. Wold M.S. Ingles C.J.

The immobilized 30-nt bubble substrate was incubated with RPA, XPA, XPF-ERCC1, or a combination of these proteins. RPA bound to this substrate specifically and efficiently (lanes 5-8 compared with lanes 10 and 11), while XPF-ERCC1 bound to the bubble substrate weakly in the absence of RPA (lane 4). When XPF-ERCC1 was incubated with the substrate in the presence of RPA, more XPF-ERCC1 bound to the bubble substrate (lanes 5 and 6). In contrast, XPA did not affect the XPF-ERCC1 binding to this substrate (lane 7). Yeast RPA failed to facilitate XPF-ERCC1 binding to the bubble substrate (data not shown), consistent with the failure of yeast RPA to confer a junction-cutting activity to XPF-ERCC1. These results suggest that human RPA recruits XPF-ERCC1 onto the bubble substrate DNA, possibly either through direct interaction or by creating a unique DNA structure.Figure 4Enhanced binding of XPF-ERCC1 to the bubble substrate in the presence of RPA. Lanes 1-3 contain RPA (0.2 μg), XPA (0.1 μg), and XPF-ERCC1 (1 μl), respectively. Immobilized B30 substrate was incubated with the indicated amounts of XPF-ERCC1 (lane 4), XPF-ERCC1 and RPA (lanes 5 and 6), XPF-ERCC1, RPA, and XPA (lane 7), RPA and XPA (lane 8), or XPA (lane 9). Immobilized DS substrate was incubated with 0.2 μg (lane 10) or 1.0 μg (lane 11) of RPA. The bound fractions were analyzed by Western blotting using a mixture of anti-p34 (RPA) (Oncogene Science), anti-XPA, and anti-ERCC1 (13.Matsunaga T. Mu D. Park C.-H. Reardon J.T. Sancar A. J. Biol.

The contamination of RPA in the XPA-column fraction seems to be unlikely, because no trace of RPA (or XPA) could be detected by either silver staining or Western blotting with high sensitivity (data not shown, also see Fig. 4). A simple explanation is that XPF-ERCC1 has an intrinsic junction-cutting activity without RPA, which becomes nonspecific at low concentrations of the enzyme. Indeed, the diluted XPA-column fraction showed a nonspecific single-stranded DNA endonuclease activity (data not shown) rather than a junction-cutting activity (which could be restored by adding RPA).Our results show that RPA plays an essential role in positioning the two nuclease subunits of the human excision nuclease system. Furthermore, these results show that, with loop structures of 12-30 nt in length, RPA, XPG, and XPF-ERCC1 are capable of removing the loop by incising the strand with extra nucleotides on both sides of the loops. The human MutLS system is capable of eliminating mismatches and loops up to 4 nucleotides(24.Modrich P. Science. 1994; 266: 1959-1960Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). However, it was reported that loops of 5, 8, and 16 nucleotides can be removed in a hMLH1-independent manner(25.Umar A. Boyer J.C. Kunkel T.A. Science. 1994; 266: 814-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been found that the yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe exonuclease I (26.Szankasi P. Smith G.R. Science. 1995; 267: 1166-1169Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) and the Saccharomyces cerevisiae RTH1 nuclease(27.Johnson R.E. Kovvali G.K. Prakash L. Prakash S. Science. 1995; 269: 238-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), which belong to the extended family of XPG/RAD2/Rad13 and FEN-1/Rad2 proteins, play roles in mismatch corrections. Thus, it is possible that XPG and XPF-ERCC1 proteins, in addition to their roles in damage excision repair, may participate in removing the looped-out DNA with a relatively large size and hence in genomic stability. INTRODUCTIONNucleotide excision repair is a general repair system that plays an important role in maintaining genetic integrity(1.Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar, 2.Sancar A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 43-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar). This repair system removes damaged nucleotides from DNA by dual incisions on both sides of the lesion in the damaged strand(3.Huang J.C. Svoboda D.L. Reardon J.T. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3664-3668Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Recently, the human and the highly homologous yeast nucleotide excision repair systems have been reconstituted from extensively purified proteins, which demonstrated that 14-15 polypeptides comprising replication protein A (RPA, 1The abbreviations used are: RPAreplication protein Antnucleotide(s)SSBsingle-stranded DNA-binding protein. also known as HSSB or RF-A) and the general transcription factor, TFIIH, in addition to XP and ERCC proteins were essential for the dual incision step(4.Mu D.

XPG was reported to possess a single-stranded DNA endonuclease activity (7.O'Donovan A. Scherly D. Clarkson S.G. Wood R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15965-15968Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Googl"
https://openalex.org/W2066428092,"Sterol regulatory element binding proteins (SREBP-1 and SREBP-2) are attached to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and nuclear envelope by a hairpin domain consisting of two transmembrane regions connected by a short lumenal loop of ∼30 hydrophilic amino acids. In sterol-depleted cells, a protease cleaves the protein in the region of the first transmembrane domain, releasing an NH2-terminal fragment of ∼500 amino acids that activates transcription of genes encoding the low density lipoprotein receptor and enzymes of cholesterol synthesis. In sterol-overloaded cells, proteolysis does not occur, and transcription is repressed. Through mutational analysis in transfected cells, we identify two segments of SREBPs that are required for proteolysis, one on either side of the ER membrane. An arginine in the lumenal loop is essential. A tetrapeptide sequence (DRSR) on the cytosolic face adjacent to the first transmembrane domain is also required for maximal cleavage. Both of these elements are conserved in the human and hamster versions of SREBP-1 and SREBP-2. Sterol-mediated suppression of cleavage of SREBP-1 was found to be dependent on the extreme COOH-terminal region (residue 1034 to the COOH terminus), which exists in two forms as a result of alternative splicing. The form encoded by the “a” class exons (exons 18a and 19a) undergoes sterol-regulated cleavage. The form encoded by the “c” class exons (18c and 19c) is cleaved less efficiently and is not suppressed by sterols. These studies were made possible through use of a vector that achieves low level expression of epitope-tagged SREBPs under control of the relatively weak thymidine kinase promoter from herpes simplex virus. In contrast to SREBPs overproduced by high level expression vectors, the SREBPs produced at low levels were subject to the same regulated cleavage pattern as the endogenous SREBPs. These results indicate that sterol-regulated proteolysis of SREBPs is a complex process, requiring sequences on both sides of the ER membrane.

Cholesterol homeostasis is maintained by sterol-regulated cleavage of two membrane-bound transcription factors designated sterol regulatory element binding protein-1 and −2 (SREBP-1 and −2). 1The abbreviations used are: SREBPsterol regulatory element binding proteinCMVcytomegalovirusERendoplasmic reticulumHSVherpes simplex virusTKthymidine kinasekbkilobase(s)PAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. These proteins, each nearly 1150 amino acids in length, are attached to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and nuclear envelope(1.Wang X. Sato R. Brown M.S. Hua X. Goldstein J.L.

When cells require cholesterol, a protease cleaves each of the SREBPs, releasing an NH2-terminal fragment of ∼500 amino acids that contains basic helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper and transcription activation domains. These fragments enter the nucleus and bind to sterol regulatory elements in the promoters of genes encoding the low density lipoprotein receptor, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA synthase and possibly other enzymes of cholesterol and fatty acid biosynthesis(1.Wang X.

In order to unravel the mechanism for sterol-regulated proteolysis, it is necessary first to understand the mechanism by which the SREBPs are attached to membranes. We recently used protease protection and N-linked glycosylation methods to demonstrate that SREBP-2 has a hairpin orientation(6.Hua X. Sakai J. Ho Y.K. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29422-29427Google Scholar). The NH2-terminal and COOH-terminal segments of ∼500 amino acids each face the cytosol. They are separated by a hairpin membrane attachment domain that consists of one transmembrane segment, a short 30-amino acid hydrophilic loop on the lumenal side of the ER membrane, and a second transmembrane segment. The precise cleavage site and the domains within the SREBP that are required for proteolysis and for sterol-mediated suppression of proteolysis are unknown. One way to answer these questions is through in vitro mutagenesis of expressible cDNAs. We have not been able to use this method in the past because we were unable to observe sterol-mediated regulation when SREBPs were overexpressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells as a result of transient transfection(2.Yokoyama C. Wang X. Briggs M.R. Admon A. Wu J. Hua X. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Cell. 1993; 75: 187-197Google Scholar, 3.Hua X. Yokoyama C. Wu J. Briggs M.R. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Wang X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11603-11607Google Scholar, 4.Sato R. Yang J. Wang X. Evans M.J. Ho Y.K. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17267-17273Google Scholar). Overexpression seemed to overwhelm the regulatory machinery, leading to aberrant and unregulated proteolysis. In the current studies, we have overcome this problem through the use of an expression vector containing a relatively weak promoter from the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (TK) gene (7.McKnight S.L. Cell. 1982; 31: 355-365Google Scholar). The promoter drives low level expression of SREBPs containing an epitope tag derived from a herpes simplex virus glycoprotein. The tag allows the products of the transfected cDNAs to be differentiated from the endogenous SREBPs. Under these conditions cleavage of the epitope-tagged SREBPs is tightly regulated by sterols. Through mutagenesis studies, we identify two crucial segments in the SREBPs, one on either side of the membrane, that are required for proteolysis and a region in the COOH-terminal segment that is necessary in order for sterols to suppress this proteolysis. HSV-Tag(™) monoclonal antibody was purchased from Novagen. All other materials were obtained from sources as described previously(6.Hua X. Sakai J. Ho Y.K. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29422-29427Google Scholar). The following steps were used to construct a vector for human SREBP-2 in which expression is driven by the HSV TK promoter and the NH2 terminus of SREBP-2 is fused to two tandem copies of an 11-amino acid HSV epitope (see Fig. 1A): 1) We cloned the 3.2-kb KpnI-SalI fragment of human SREBP-2 (amino acids 316-1141) from pXH4 (3.Hua X. Yokoyama C. Wu J. Briggs M.R. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Wang X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11603-11607Google Scholar) into the KpnI-XhoI site in pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) to create pcDNA3-SREBP-2. 2) The 8.6-kb pcDNA3-SREBP-2 was digested with NruI and KpnI to remove the 0.7-kb cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter in pcDNA3. 3) The 1.1-kb TK promoter from pTKβ (Clontech) was released with SalI and NotI (the SalI end was blunted with Klenow fragment). 4) A pair of complementary 124-base pair oligonucleotides (top strand), 5′-GGCCGCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGACTAGTGCTAGCCATGCAGCCTGAACTCGCTCCAGAGGATCCGGAAGATCAGCCTGAACTCGCTCCAGAGGATCCGGAAGATATCGATGGTACGGTAC-3′, which contained 5′ NotI and 3′ KpnI cohesive ends, were annealed at 94-83°C for 5 min and then at 83-23°C for 60 min. This oligonucleotide encoded, from 5′ to 3′, sequences for the following elements: NotI restriction site, T7 RNA polymerase promoter (for in vitro translation) followed by an inframe stop codon (TAG), SpeI and NheI restriction sites, initiator methionine codon in the context of a Kozak consensus(8.Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 857-872Google Scholar), two tandem copies of the HSV epitope (QPELAPEDPED) from amino acids 265-275 of HSV envelope glycoprotein D(9.Isola V.J. Eisenberg R.J. Siebert G.R. Heilman C.J. Wilcox W.C. Cohen G.H. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 2325-2334Google Scholar), and six novel amino acids (IDGTVP) that correspond to the BspDI and KpnI restriction sites. The above three fragments, namely, the 7.9-kb NruI-KpnI fragment of the pcDNA3-SREBP-2 backbone containing amino acids 315-1141 of SREBP-2, the 1.1-kb SalI (blunted)-NotI fragment of the TK promoter, and the 124-base pair annealed oligonucelotides (5′ NotI and 3′ KpnI), were ligated together to create an intermediate plasmid, designated “triple ligation construct.” To clone the NH2 terminus of SREBP-2 into the triple ligation construct, the nucleotide sequence encoding amino acids 14-315 of human SREBP-2 was amplified by polymerase chain reaction in a 100-μl reaction containing 200 ng of pXH4(3.Hua X. Yokoyama C. Wu J. Briggs M.R. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Wang X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11603-11607Google Scholar), 2.5 units of pfu DNA polymerase, 5 nmol of dNTPs, and 20 pmol of each primer, which had a KpnI site at its 5′ end. The polymerase chain reaction was carried out at an initial temperature of 80°C followed by 94°C for 3 min and 20 cycles of 94°C for 1 min, 60°C for 1 min, and 72°C for 2 min for each cycle. The amplified product was digested with KpnI and cloned into the KpnI site of the triple ligation construct to create pTK-HSV-BP2 (see Fig. 1A). This plasmid encodes an 1157-amino acid fusion protein of SREBP-2 (amino acids 14-1141) preceded by an initiator methionine, the two tandem copies of the HSV epitope, and six novel amino acids (see above). Because methionine at residue 13 of SREBP-2 (3.Hua X. Yokoyama C. Wu J. Briggs M.R. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Wang X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11603-11607Google Scholar) is surrounded by a favorable Kozak consensus sequence(8.Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 857-872Google Scholar), the NH2-terminal 13 amino acids were not included in the vector in order to prevent multiple initiations of translation. The following steps were used to construct an expression vector for human SREBP-1a modeled after pTK-HSV-BP2: 1) pTK-HSV-BP2 was digested with BspDI and XbaI to remove the 4.2-kb SREBP-2 sequence but retain the HSV epitope sequence. 2) The sequence corresponding to amino acids 2-474 of SREBP-1a was amplified by polymerase chain reaction of pSREBP-1a (2.Yokoyama C. Wang X. Briggs M.R. Admon A. Wu J. Hua X. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Cell. 1993; 75: 187-197Google Scholar) with an NH2-terminal primer flanked by a BspDI site and a COOH-terminal primer flanked by an EagI site using conditions described above. 3) The 2.6-kb EagI-XbaI fragment corresponding to amino acids 475-1147 of SREBP-1a was isolated from pSREBP-1a(2.Yokoyama C. Wang X. Briggs M.R. Admon A. Wu J. Hua X. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Cell. 1993; 75: 187-197Google Scholar). The above three fragments were ligated to generate pTK-HSV-BP1a. This plasmid encodes an 1171-amino acid fusion protein of SREBP-1a (amino acids 2-1147) preceded by an initiator methionine, the two tandem copies of the HSV epitope, and two novel amino acids (ID) corresponding to the BspDI restriction site. To construct an expression vector for human SREBP-1c, the following steps were used: 1) pSREBP-1c (2.Yokoyama C. Wang X. Briggs M.R. Admon A. Wu J. Hua X. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Cell. 1993; 75: 187-197Google Scholar) was digested with Eco47III and XbaI to isolate a 2.5-kb Eco47III-XbaI fragment encoding amino acids 311-1047 of human SREBP-1c. 2) The sequence corresponding to amino acids 2-310 of SREBP-1c was amplified by polymerase chain reaction of pSREBP-1c (2.Yokoyama C. Wang X. Briggs M.R. Admon A. Wu J. Hua X. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Cell. 1993; 75: 187-197Google Scholar) with an NH2-terminal primer flanked by BspDI and a COOH-terminal primer flanked by Eco47III using conditions described above. The amplified product was then digested with BspDI and Eco47III. 3) pTK-HSV-BP2 was digested with BspDI and XbaI to remove the 4.2-kb SREBP-2 sequence but retain the HSV epitope sequence. The three fragments were ligated to generate pTK-HSV-BP1c. This plasmid encodes an 1071-amino acid fusion protein of SREBP-1c (amino acids 2-1047) preceded by an initiator methionine, the two tandem copies of the HSV epitope, and two novel amino acids (ID) corresponding to the BspDI restriction site. To construct an expression vector for human SREBP-1b, pTK-HSV-BP1a was digested with SrfI and XbaI to remove the 1.2-kb COOH-terminal sequences of SREBP-1a (amino acids 927-1147), after which this sequence was replaced with the 0.8-kb SrfI-XbaI fragment from pSREBP-1c (2.Yokoyama C. Wang X. Briggs M.R. Admon A. Wu J. Hua X. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Cell. 1993; 75: 187-197Google Scholar) encoding amino acids 903-1047. The resulting plasmid is designated pTK-HSV-BP1b. A control vector without any insert, designated pTK, was constructed by digesting pTK-HSV-BP2 with SpeI and XbaI to remove the 4.2-kb SREBP-2 sequence, followed by ligation. To construct a CMV promoter-driven expression vector for SREBP-1a, a 4.1-kb SpeI (blunted)-XbaI-digested fragment encoding the HSV-epitope tagged SREBP-1a fusion protein of 1171 amino acids (see above) was inserted into the EcoRV-XbaI sites of pcDNA3. This plasmid is designated pCMV-HSV-BP1a. All of the above plasmids were sequenced in the region of the construction junctions to confirm the DNA sequence. Oligonucleotide mutagenesis was carried out with single-stranded, uracil-containing DNA as described by Kunkel(10.Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Google Scholar). Briefly, CJ236 cells were transformed with pTK-HSV-BPs, which contain a replication origin of filamentous phage (see Fig. 1A). The single-stranded, uracil-containing DNA was prepared from the transformed CJ236 cells with cotransfection of helper phage M13K07 (Promega) and used as template for site-directed mutagenesis. Oligonucleotides corresponding to the bottom strand of the SREBP sequences were synthesized, phosphorylated with T4 polynucleotide kinase, and annealed to the template under the following conditions: 94-83°C for 5 min and then 83-23°C for 60 min. The mutagenized strand was synthesized with T7 DNA polymerase, and the reactions were used to transform DH5α competent cells. Each mutant was sequenced to confirm the mutation. The mutagenized region in most mutants was cut out at convenient restriction sites, cloned into the corresponding sites of the parental plasmid, and sequenced for confirmation. For the mutants that were not cut out and substituted into the parental plasmid, the mutation was confirmed by sequencing the relevant region, and at least two independent clones of the mutant plasmid were independently transfected into 293 cells to confirm the results. Monolayers of human embryonic kidney 293 cells were transfected with wild-type or mutant plasmids as described(6.Hua X. Sakai J. Ho Y.K. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29422-29427Google Scholar). The cells were incubated for 20 h with 50 μM compactin and 50 μM sodium mevalonate in the absence or the presence of sterols as indicated in the legends. Thereafter, the cells received N-acetyl-leucinal-leucinal-norleucinal at a final concentration of 25 μg/ml(1.Wang X. Sato R. Brown M.S. Hua X. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1994; 77: 53-62Google Scholar), and the cells were harvested 3 h later as described(6.Hua X. Sakai J. Ho Y.K. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29422-29427Google Scholar). The cell suspension from duplicate dishes was passed through a 22.5 gauge needle 15 times and centrifuged at 1000 × g at 4°C for 5 min. The resulting 1000 × g pellet was used to prepare a nuclear extract fraction by resuspension in 80 μl of buffer C (10 mM Hepes-KOH at pH 7.4, 0.42 M NaCl, 2.5% (v/v) glycerol, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM sodium EDTA, 0.5 mM EGTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and the protease inhibitor mixture(6.Hua X. Sakai J. Ho Y.K. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29422-29427Google Scholar)), followed by rotation of the suspension at 4°C for 30 min and centrifugation at top speed in a microcentrifuge at 4°C for 15 min. The resulting 1000 × g supernatant was used to prepare a membrane fraction by centrifugation at 105 × g in a Beckman TLA 100.2 rotor for 30 min at 4°C, followed by resuspension of the 105 × g pellet in 100 μl of SDS lysis buffer(11.Gil G. Faust J.R. Chin D.J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Cell. 1985; 41: 249-258Google Scholar). Samples of the nuclear extract and membrane fractions were mixed with 5 × SDS loading buffer (12.Bollag D.M. Edelstein S.J. Protein Methods. Wiley-Liss, Inc., New York1991Google Scholar) prior to SDS-PAGE on 8% gels. Protein concentration was measured with a BCA kit (Pierce). After electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred to Hybond-C extra nitrocellulose (Amersham Corp.). Immunoblot analysis was carried out with Enhanced Chemiluminesence Western blotting Detection kit (Amersham Corp.) according to the manufacturer's instructions except that the nitrocellulose was blocked in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20, 5% (v/v) nonfat dry milk, and 5% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. Immunodetection of SREBPs was carried out with 0.5 μg/ml of HSV-Tag(™) monoclonal antibody(6.Hua X. Sakai J. Ho Y.K. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29422-29427Google Scholar). Gels were calibrated with prestained molecular weight markers (New England Biolabs). The filters were exposed to Reflection film (DuPont NEN) at room temperature for the indicated times. Fig. 1A shows the TK-driven vector that was used to express SREBP-2 in these studies. The NH2 terminus of the encoded protein contains a 22-amino acid epitope tag derived from the HSV envelope glycoprotein D (HSV tag). Expression is driven by the HSV TK promoter, and the polyadenylation signal is derived from the bovine growth hormone gene. A similar expression vector was constructed for SREBP-1a as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fig. 1B shows the topology of the SREBPs and indicates the location of the two segments that are required for proteolysis: the DRSR immediately external to the first transmembrane sequence and the Arg in the lumenal loop. Fig. 2 compares immunoblots of nuclear extracts and crude membrane pellets from human embryonic kidney 293 cells that were transfected with plasmids encoding HSV-tagged SREBP-1a under control of the strong CMV promoter or the weak TK promoter. The CMV vector gave extremely high level overexpression of the membrane-bound form of SREBP-1a, even when only 0.5 μg of plasmid was used (lanes 13-16 in Fig. 2B). The immunoblots showed multiple overlapping bands, indicating extensive proteolysis of the overexpressed protein. The amounts of the precursor and the proteolytic fragments were similar when the cells were sterol-deprived by incubation with the cholesterol synthesis inhibitor compactin (-sterols) or when they were sterol-overloaded by incubation with 25-hydroxycholesterol and cholesterol in the presence of compactin (+sterols). Nuclear extracts of cells transfected with the CMV-driven vector contained relatively large amounts of the mature nuclear form of tagged SREBP-1a, but the amount was not affected by sterols (lanes 5-8 in Fig. 2A). When the TK promoter was used, the amount of membrane-bound precursor was much lower than observed with the CMV promoter, and the smear of membrane-bound proteolytic fragments was not observed (Fig. 2, compare lanes 11-12 with lanes 13-16). The nuclei of cells expressing the TK-driven protein showed abundant mature form of SREBP-1a in the absence of sterols and a disappearance of this protein in the presence of sterols (Fig. 2, lanes 3 and 4). This behavior reflects that of endogenous SREBP-1a in untransfected cells(1.Wang X. Sato R. Brown M.S. Hua X. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1994; 77: 53-62Google Scholar, 13.Yang J. Sato R. Goldstein J.L.

Fig. 3A shows the effect of different concentrations of 25-hydroxycholesterol on the amount of the mature nuclear form of tagged SREBP-2 produced by the TK vector. The protein disappeared at a sterol concentration between 0.3 and 1 μg/ml (Fig. 3A), which is similar to that previously observed for the endogenous protein(1.Wang X. Sato R. Brown M.S. Hua X. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1994; 77: 53-62Google Scholar, 13.Yang J. Sato R. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 1910-1919Google Scholar). The sterol had no effect on the amount of the membrane-bound precursor (Fig. 3B). In an initial attempt to localize sequences in SREBP-1a that are required for sterol-regulated proteolysis, we created a series of point mutations in the linker region between the basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper region and the first transmembrane domain, which is the approximate region at which cleavage takes place(4.Sato R. Yang J. Wang X. Evans M.J. Ho Y.K. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17267-17273Google Scholar, 13.Yang J. Sato R. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S.

Goldstein J.L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1012-1020Google Scholar). We previously identified an apoptosis-related cysteine protease that cleaves SREBP-1a at Asp460 and SREBP-2 at Asp468(15.Wang X. Zelenski N.G. Yang J. Sakai J. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1012-1020Google Scholar). This protease, designated CPP32, becomes activated only during apoptosis, and it is not regulated by sterols. Changing the Asp at the cleavage site to Ala abrogates cleavage by CPP32 in vitro(15.Wang X. Zelenski N.G. Yang J. Sakai J. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1012-1020Google Scholar). However, changing these residues in SREBP-1a (Fig. 4B, lanes 5 and 6) or SREBP-2 (Fig. 4C, lanes 15 and 16) did not affect cleavage by the sterol-regulated protease in transfected 293 cells. These results provide further evidence that CPP32 is not responsible for sterol-regulated proteolysis. SREBP-1a and −2 contain a conserved sequence DRSR that marks the boundary of the first transmembrane domain (Fig. 1B and 4A). The following residue, leucine (SREBP-1) or isoleucine (SREBP-2), initiates the hydrophobic sequence of the first transmembrane domain(6.Hua X. Sakai J. Ho Y.K. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29422-29427Google Scholar). We eliminated the DRSR by changing it to AS in both SREBP-1a and −2. We used AS because its coding sequence is a site for the restriction enzyme NheI, which facilitated the identification of the desired mutant. In both SREBP-1a and SREBP-2 the DRSR → AS substitution severely reduced cleavage by the sterol-regulated protease (Fig. 4, B, lanes 7 and 8, and C, lanes 17 and 18). A single substitution within this sequence (D484A) abolished cleavage of SREBP-1a (lanes 9 and 10), whereas the analogous substitution in SREBP-2 (D478A) did not affect cleavage (lanes 19 and 20). None of these changes affected the amount of the precursor form in the membranes (lower panels of Fig. 4, B and C). In addition to the above experiments, we produced other mutations in the linker region that had no effects on the cleavage or sterol-mediated regulation of SREBP-1a or SREBP-2 (Fig. 5). These mutations included nine point mutations (alanine substitutions) in SREBP-1a and three deletion mutations in SREBP-2. We next turned our attention to the short hydrophilic loop that lies on the lumenal side of the ER membrane between the two transmembrane regions(6.Hua X. Sakai J. Ho Y.K. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29422-29427Google Scholar). This loop contains a conserved Arg (residue 527 of SREBP-1a and 519 of SREBP-2) (Fig. 1B and 6A). Replacement of this Arg with an Ala abolished cleavage of both proteins (Fig. 6, B, lanes 5 and 6, and C, lanes 11 and 12). Changing the Arg to a Lys in SREBP-2 preserved the cleavage (lanes 13 and 14). This latter mutation was not made in SREBP-1a. We previously showed that SREBP-1 can exist in several forms, owing to the use of alternative NH2-terminal exons (designated 1a and 1c) and alternative pairs of COOH-terminal exons that are designated 18a/19a and 18c/19c(2.Yokoyama C. Wang X. Briggs M.R. Admon A. Wu J. Hua X. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Cell. 1993; 75: 187-197Google Scholar, 16.Hua X. Wu J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Hobbs H.H. Genomics. 1995; 25: 667-673Google Scholar). This alternative splicing can result in at least three versions of the protein, designated SREBP-1a, 1b, and 1c (Fig. 7A). All of the experiments up to this point were conducted with the 1a version. Surprisingly, when we transfected 293 cells with a cDNA encoding the 1c version, which contains the c class exons at both ends, we observed two differences in comparison with SREBP-1a (Fig. 7B). First, the amount of mature form in the nucleus was reduced. Second, there was no longer any suppression by sterols (Fig. 7B, compare lanes 5 and 6 with lanes 3 and 4). The sizes of the precursor form and the nuclear form were also reduced because the c class exons encode a shorter protein sequence than the a class exons. To determine whether the differences in cleavage and regulation were attributable to the c class exons at the NH2 terminus or COOH terminus, we prepared SREBP-1b, which contains exon 1a at the NH2 terminus and exons 18c and 19c at the COOH terminus (Fig. 7A). Cleavage of this version also failed to be suppressed by sterols, indicating that the resistance to sterol suppression is dictated by the exons at the COOH terminus (Fig. 7B, lanes 7 and 8). In the current studies, we have developed an expression vector that produces physiologic amounts of SREBP-1 and −2, thereby allowing sterol-regulated cleavage to occur in transfected 293 cells. The amount of SREBP produced by this vector is about the same as the amount of endogenous SREBP in the cells as judged from comparative immunoblots (6.Hua X. Sakai J. Ho Y.K. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29422-29427Google Scholar). 2X. Hua, J. Sakai, M. S. Brown, and J. L. Goldstein, unpublished observations. Using this vector as a basis for a mutational analysis, we have identified two conserved regions of SREBP-1a and −2 that are required for high level cleavage by the sterol-regulated protease. Surprisingly, these two sequences lie on opposite sides of the ER membrane. The most essential residue of either SREBP-1a or −2 is the Arg in the lumenal loop. Changing this Arg to an Ala abolished cleavage. In numerous experiments with this mutant protein, we have never observed any cleavage band, even when the gels were exposed for prolonged periods. Changing the Arg to a Lys in SREBP-2 preserved cleavage, indicating that the positive charge is the important feature. The precise location of this Arg is important because its removal abolished cleavage of SREBP-1a even though the lumenal loop of this protein contains two other arginines (Arg510 and Arg535). (The lumenal loop of SREBP-2 contains only one Arg.) We have not yet conducted an extensive mutational analysis of the lumenal loop to determine whether other residues are required. We note, however, that this sequence is not well conserved between SREBP-1a and −2 (Fig. 6A). One conspicuous conserved residue is a leucine that is three residues to the COOH-terminal side of the crucial Arg (Leu530 in SREBP-1a and Leu522 in SREBP-2). In experiments not shown, we changed this leucine to alanine in SREBP-2 without any effect on sterol-regulated cleavage.2 The exact role played by the lumenal Arg is not clear as yet. It may be a site of initial cleavage that is followed by a second cleavage on the cytoplasmic side in the region of the DRSR sequence. It might also be part of a recognition sequence that binds a regulatory protein that facilitates cleavage on the cytoplasmic face. Several other possibilities exist, and they should be susceptible to analysis with the expression vector that is now in hand. The requirement for the DRSR sequence on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane is not as absolute as the requirement for the lumenal Arg, at least for SREBP-2. The DRSR → AS mutant form of SREBP-1a never yielded a mature nuclear protein. However, in some experiments with the DRSR → AS version of SREBP-2, we observed a small amount of the nuclear form that was up to 10-20% of the amount generated by the wild-type protein in the same experiments. These data indicate that the DRSR sequence is important but not absolutely essential for sterol-regulated proteolysis. It may not be a cleavage site itself, but rather it may be part of the recognition site for a protease that cleaves elsewhere. Aside from the DRSR sequence, the spacer region between the leucine zipper and the first transmembrane region does not appear to contain any residues that are crucial for cleavage of SREBP-1a or −2. As shown in Fig. 5B, we were able to delete all of the amino acids between residues 402 and 477 of SREBP-2 without affecting sterol-regulated cleavage. This eliminates all of the spacer region except for the DRSR sequence immediately adjacent to the membrane. A similar conclusion was drawn with regard to SREBP-1a. Here we observed normal sterol-regulated cleavage of mutant forms of SREBP-1a containing any of nine point mutations in the juxtamembrane portion (Fig. 5A). These substitutions included the GM sequence at positions 481 and 482, which is two residues to the NH2-terminal side of the DRSR sequence (Fig. 5A). Like the DRSR sequence, the GM sequence is conserved in human and hamster SREBP-1 and −2, but replacement of Gly or Met with Ala did not affect sterol-regulated cleavage in the transfected 293 cells. The finding that cleavage of SREBP-1c is not regulated by sterols was a surprise, and it may have physiologic implications. Immunity to regulation was traced to the COOH-terminal two exons. We do not yet know whether the a class exons are required for regulation or whether the c class exons dominantly interfere with regulation. The COOH-terminal c class exons cannot be a major contributor to the total amount of SREBP-1 in tissue culture cells, because cleavage of endogenous SREBP-1 is totally suppressed by sterols(1.Wang X. Sato R. Brown M.S. Hua X. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1994; 77: 53-62Google Scholar, 13.Yang J. Sato R. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 1910-1919Google Scholar, 14.Yang J. Brown M.S. Ho Y.K. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12152-12161Google Scholar). A different situation may pertain in liver. We previously observed that livers of chow-fed hamsters contain the nuclear form of SREBP-1 but not SREBP-2(17.Sheng Z. Otani H. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 935-938Google Scholar). It is possible that this nuclear form results from the protein with the COOH-terminal c class exons. Inasmuch as we have no evidence for an alternatively spliced form of SREBP-2, cleavage of this protein may always be regulated by sterols. Experiments are currently underway to determine whether hamster liver contains mRNAs encoding the c class of SREBP-1. We thank Mark Daris for excellent technical assistance, Jacqueline Le for invaluable help with tissue culture, and Jeff Cormier and Michelle Laremore for synthesis of oligonucleotides and DNA sequencing."

Therefore, HAS cDNA is responsible for the activity of the hyaluronan synthase, a key enzyme of hyaluronan synthesis in eukaryotic cells. Hyaluronan, a high molecular weight linear glycosaminoglycan, which is composed of β1,4-linked repeating disaccharides of glucuronic acid β1,3-linked to N-acetylglucosamine, is a characteristic component of the extracellular matrix during early stages of morphogenesis, and its synthesis is spatially and temporally regulated(1.Toole B.P. Hey E.D. Cell Biology of the Extracellular Matrix. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1981: 259-294Google Scholar). The association of hyaluronan with the cell surface can influence the cellular behaviors especially in regard to modulation of cell migration, adhesion, wound healing, and tumor invasion(2.Turley E.A. Evered D. Whelan J. The Biology of Hyaluronan. Wiley, Chichester, United Kingdom1989: 121-137Google Scholar, 3.Knudson W. Biswas C. Li X.-Q. Nemec R.E. Toole B.P. Evered D. Whelan J.

We are interested in the molecules involved in the association and have found that the heavy chain of the inter-α-trypsin inhibitor and PG-M/versican play important roles in the formation of the hyaluronan matrix(6.Yamagata M. Saga S. Kato M. Bernfield M. Kimata K. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 55-65Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Huang L. Yoneda M. Kimata K. J. Biol.

The molecular cloning of genes encoding enzymes that take part in the hyaluronan biosynthesis is one of essential steps to understand the biosynthetic pathway as well as to investigate biological functions of the pericellular association of hyaluronan. Although the hyaluronan biosynthesis in Group A Streptococci has been extensively studied and the structural gene for the bacterial hyaluronan synthase was recently isolated from Streptococcus pyogenes(9.DeAngelis P.L. Papaconstantinou J. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19181-19184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), little is known about the mechanism for the biosynthesis of hyaluronan in eukaryotic cells. There are some attempts to purify eukaryotic hyaluronan synthase to a homogeneity. However, those encountered the loss of enzyme activity(10.Mian N. Biochem. J. 1986; 237: 343-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 11.Ng K.F. Schwartz N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11776-11783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Klewes L. Turley E.A. Prehm P. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 791-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Therefore, we chose the different way by adopting a mammalian transient expression system to isolate the genes responsible for the expression of hyaluronan. We first established several mutants that are defective in hyaluronan biosynthesis. One of the mutant cell line, HAS-, is defective in hyaluronan synthase activity and may therefore be useful to identify a gene encoding eukaryotic hyaluronan synthase. In this report, we describe the isolation of a cDNA encoding a protein that may correspond to hyaluronan synthase in mouse mammary carcinoma cells by a mammalian transient expression cloning.

Sheep fixed erythrocytes were purchased from Inter-Cell Technologies, Inc. Streptomyces hyaluronidase was obtained from Seikagaku Corp., Tokyo, Japan. Superdex HR 10/30 column was purchased from Pharmacia Biotech, Tokyo, Japan. A biotinylated hyaluronan binding region (b-HABR), which specifically binds to hyaluronan, was prepared from bovine nasal cartilage proteoglycan using hyaluronan affinity chromatography according to the method of Tengblad(13.Tengblad A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 578: 281-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). N-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine biotinylated hyaluronan binding region hyaluronan. The mouse mammary carcinoma cell line, FM3A P15A, was maintained on a 100-mm Falcon Petri dish (No. 1005) in Eagle's minimum essential medium with double the normal concentrations of amino acids and vitamins and 10% heat-inactivated calf serum (MEMC) as described previously(5.Kimata K. Honma Y. Okayama M. Oguri K. Hozumi M. Suzuki S. Cancer Res. 1983; 43: 1347-1354PubMed Google Scholar). A clone having high capacity of hyaluronan production, FM3A HA1, was established from FM3A P15A by the selection using fixed erythrocyte exclusion assay. To obtain mutant cells with defects in hyaluronan biosynthesis, FM3A HA1 cells were treated with 0.5 μg/ml MNNG and selected as described above. One of the mutant cell lines, HAS-, is defective in a hyaluronan synthase activity (see “Results and Discussion”). Polyoma large T antigen-expressing cell lines were established by transfecting HAS- mutant cells with pdl3027 plasmid containing polyoma T antigen gene as described previously(14.Nagata Y. Yamashiro S. Yodoi J. Lloyd K.O. Shiku H. Furukawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12082-12089Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Polyoma large T antigen-mediated replication of plasmids in these cell lines was assessed by measurement of the methylation status of the plasmid DNA (15.Heffernan M. Dennis J.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 85-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Finally, a clonal cell line named HAS-P was chosen for a transient expression cloning. To obtain G418-resistant and blasticidin S-resistant cell lines, respectively, either pSV2neo vector (Clontech Laboratories Inc.) or pSV2bsr vector (Funakoshi Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) was transfected to each mutant cell line by lipofection as described below. The stable transfectants were selected in the MEMC medium with 500 μg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.) or 50 μg/ml blasticidin S hydrochloride (Funakoshi Co., Ltd.). Somatic cell fusion was performed as described previously(16.Yasuda H. Kamijo M. Honda R. Nakamura M. Hanaoka F. Ohba Y. Cell Struct. Funct. 1991; 16: 105-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The fused cells were selected in the MEMC medium with 500 μg/ml G418 and 50 μg/ml blasticidin S hydrochloride. Complementation was assessed by the production of hyaluronan by the fused cells, which was determined by the immunoenzyme assay described below. A cDNA library, pcDNAI-HA1, was constructed from poly(A)+ RNA isolated from FM3A HA1 cells and mammalian expression vector pcDNAI (Invitrogen Co.) as described previously(17.Aruffo A. Seed B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8573-8577Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). The library comprised 1 × 107 independent colonies when transfected to Escherichia coli MC1061/P3. For the first round of transfection, 20 samples of 1.5 × 106 HAS-P cells in 60-mm tissue culture dishes (Falcon No. 3002) were prepared. For each dish, 4 μg of cDNA library and 20 μl of LipofectAMINE™ reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) were each diluted to 200 μl with Opti-MEM I (Life Technologies, Inc.), mixed, and then added to the cells. After incubation for 12 h at 37°C, the medium was replaced with 3 ml of Cosmedium 001 (CosmoBio Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan), and the cells were incubated for an additional 52 h at 37°C. The transfected cells were washed with cold Cosmedium 001 and resuspended in the same medium containing 50 μg/ml b-HABR. After incubation for 1 h on ice, the cells were washed with cold Cosmedium 001 and resuspended in the same medium containing fluorescein avidin DCS (Vector Laboratories, Inc.). After incubation for 1 h on ice, the cells were washed and resuspended in cold phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, containing 5% fetal calf serum. Positively stained cells were sorted by EPICS Elite Flow Cytometer (Coulter Electronics, Inc.). Plasmid DNA molecules were recovered from the sorted cells by the Hirt procedure (18.Hirt B. J. Mol. Biol. 1967; 26: 365-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (3313) Google Scholar) and transfected to E. coli MC1061/P3. Plasmid DNA was prepared again and used for an another round of screening by the same procedure as described above. After four cycles of transfection and screening, 10 pools prepared to contain 10 colonies each were screened by the expression of hyaluronan. Finally, 10 clones from the one positive pool were randomly selected and screened, and one positive clone, HAS, was isolated (sibling selection)(14.Nagata Y. Yamashiro S. Yodoi J. Lloyd K.O. Shiku H. Furukawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12082-12089Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The insert from the HAS clone was purified and subcloned into pcDNA3 plasmid vector (Invitrogen Co.). The nucleotide sequence of the isolated cDNA was determined by repeated sequencing of both strands of alkaline-denatured plasmid DNA using the dGTP and deazaGTP kits with Sequenase version 2.0 (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). The DNA synthesis was primed by T7, SP6, and internal primers situated about 250 base pairs apart. The obtained DNA sequences were compiled and analyzed using GENETYX-MAC computer programs (Software Development Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences were compared with other protein sequences in the nucleic acid and protein data bases (EMBL-GDB, release 44 and NBRF-PDB, release 45). pcDNA3-HAS plasmid was prepared as described above. HAS- cells were transfected either with pcDNA3-HAS or with pcDNA3 control vector by the lipofection procedure and then selected in the medium with 500 μg/ml G418. Clonal cell lines were obtained by limiting dilution. The fixed erythrocyte exclusion assay followed a protocol described previously(19.Knudson W. Knudson C.B. J. Cell Sci. 1991; 99: 227-235Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were observed under an Olympus IMT-2 inverted phase-contrast microscope. The amount of hyaluronan was measured by a procedure modified from that of Tengblad (20.Tengblad A. Biochem. J. 1980; 185: 101-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). We used b-HABR and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated streptavidin as primary and secondary probes, respectively. The enzyme activity was measured using p-nitrophenyl phosphate as a sensitive substrate. Crude membrane proteins were prepared and suspended in 0.2 ml of 25 mM Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.1, 5 mM dithiothreitol, 15 mM MgCl2, 1 mM UDP-GlcNAc, 0.05 mM UDP-GlcUA, 2.5 μCi of UDP-[14C]GlcUA as described previously(11.Ng K.F. Schwartz N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11776-11783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the substrate concentrations in the reaction mixture were modified to give the maximal activity from the original ones. Protein content was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit. Hyaluronan synthase activity was assayed by the procedure modified from that described previously(11.Ng K.F. Schwartz N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11776-11783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, after the reaction at 37°C for 1 h, the mixture was further incubated with or without 1 turbidity reducing unit of Streptomyces hyaluronidase at 37°C for 1 h and then boiled in the presence of 1% SDS. [14C]Hyaluronan was separated by chromatography on Superdex HR 10/30 (1.0 × 30 cm) and eluted with 0.2 M ammonium acetate, and 1-ml fractions were collected for determination of the radioactivity. Radioactivity incorporated into hyaluronan was calculated as Streptomyces hyaluronidase-sensitive radioactivity. Mutant cell lines deficient in hyaluronan biosynthesis were isolated from FM3A HA1 cells mutagenized with MNNG. All the mutants showed a considerably reduced level of hyaluronan production (less than 6 ng of HA/104 cells) compared with that of the wild-type FM3A HA1 cell line (see Table 1). The genetic backgrounds of these clones were analyzed by somatic cell fusion and resultant complementation in hyaluronan biosynthesis. The clones were found to be grouped into three classes (A, B, and C), and any combination of the clones between the different classes complemented the hyaluronan production (Table 1), which suggested that at least three genes may contribute to hyaluronan biosynthesis and that the hyaluronan synthesis would be restored if the normal gene is introduced into the mutant cells. The typical clones representing class A and B maintained significant levels of the hyaluronan synthase activity (45.2 ± 1.5 and 35.9 ± 2.3 pmol/h/mg of protein, respectively). By contrast, the one clone representing class C almost lacked hyaluronan synthase activity (Table 1) and was termed HAS- for subsequent study.Tabled 1 To clone a cDNA encoding a protein that participates in hyaluronan synthase, a transient expression cloning using HAS- cells was adopted. One single clone that directed the expression of hyaluronan in HAS-P cells was finally isolated by sibling selection described under “Experimental Procedures.” We termed the cDNA isolated from this clone HAS. HAS cDNA consisted of 2102 base pairs and a single long open reading frame of 1749 base pairs (Fig. 1). Three methionine codons are found within the first 35 codons of this reading frame, and the most proximal one was assigned as the initiation codon, based on Kozak's rules (21.Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 887-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1439) Google Scholar) for mammalian translation initiation. This reading frame predicts a protein of 583 amino acids in length, with a Mr of 65,500. On the basis of Von Heijne's(−3, −1) rule(22.Von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 173: 243-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar), there is no apparent NH2-terminal signal peptide sequence. Notable stretches of hydrophobic amino acids exist in HAS protein (Fig. 1). The presence of those hydrophobic stretches in HAS protein suggests that the protein may be associated with the membrane via multiple membrane-spanning regions. The relative hydropathy of HAS protein was further examined by plotting the hydrophobic index over the entire length using the algorithm of Kyte and Doolittle(23.Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (16477) Google Scholar). The analysis suggested the presence of the hydrophilic region between the NH2-terminal hydrophobic stretches and the COOH-terminal hydrophobic stretches (Fig. 2). In comparison with the hydrophobicity profile of a bacterial hyaluronan synthase, HasA protein (24.Dougherty B.A. van de Rijn I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 169-175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), highly similar molecular arrangements were observed. Mian (10.Mian N. Biochem. J. 1986; 237: 343-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) described previously that a 66-kDa protein may be a constituent of the membrane-bound hyaluronan synthase complex partially purified from the detergent-solubilized plasma membrane of cultured human skin fibroblasts. Considering those, the structural characteristics of HAS protein suggest that the protein may be either the hyaluronan synthase itself or an essential component of the synthase complex.Figure 2:Hydropathic analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence of HAS. The hydrophobicity values were obtained according to the algorithm of Kyte and Doolittle(23.Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (16477) Google Scholar). Positive values represent increased hydrophobicity. The predicted membrane-associated domains are marked with open bars.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) A computer search for proteins having identity to HAS protein was performed using the NBRF-PDB (release 45) data base. None of sequences identical to HAS protein was found in the protein data base. However, interestingly, a 557-amino acid overlap with 57.6% identity to HAS protein was observed with DG42 protein, the predicted product of an mRNA species that is rapidly accumulated and degraded during Xenopus laevis embryonic development(25.Rosa F. Sargent T.D. Rebbert M.L. Michaels G.S. Jamrich M. Grunz H. Jonas E. Winkles J.A. Dawid I.B. Dev. Biol. 1988; 129: 114-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). DG42 protein had also been reported to be a protein homologous to HasA protein(9.DeAngelis P.L. Papaconstantinou J. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19181-19184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The search also showed significant homology between HAS protein and HasA protein (290-amino acid overlap with 33.1% identity). DeAngelis et al. (26.DeAngelis P.L. Yang N. Weigel P.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) recently reported the presence of the conserved region of HasA protein among the various Group A Streptococci which is likely to be involved in the structure and/or function of the hyaluronan synthase. This region is also very similar in GlcNAc polymer synthases such as yeast chitin synthases and Rhizobium NodC(26.DeAngelis P.L. Yang N. Weigel P.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Thus, we compared those regions among HAS, DG42, and HasA proteins using the GENETYX-MAC program (Fig. 3). The multiple sequence alignments of the regions showed that there is 76.7% identity between HAS and DG42, and 40.7% identity between HAS and HasA, respectively. The sequence conservation strongly supports that HAS gene product is greatly related to eukaryotic hyaluronan synthase. Although DG42 has recently been reported to synthesize oligosaccharide of GlcNAc but not hyaluronan in an in vitro transcription-translation system(27.Semino C.E. Robbins W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3498-3501Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), the in vitro translation system might have lost the one part of hyaluronan synthase activity that bears the GlcUA transferase activity, or it is also likely that other factor(s) might be necessary for the expression of the synthase activity. A transient expression of HAS cDNA in HAS-P cells complemented the deficient matrix deposition of hyaluronan (Fig. 4). Pretreatment of the cells with Streptomyces hyaluronidase completely abolished the formations of hyaluronan matrix surrounding the transfectants (Fig. 4D). After hyaluronidase digestion, the areas of the hyaluronan matrix were identical to those observed in control (transfectants with pcDNAI) (Fig. 4C). The neo-synthesis of hyaluronan by HAS cDNA was confirmed using stable transfectants expressing the HAS gene. The cell line established from HAS- cells transfected with pcDNA3-HAS synthesized and secreted hyaluronan at significantly higher levels in the culture medium (Table 1). The control transfectants with pcDNA3 vector produced low levels of hyaluronan. These results again support that HAS protein takes part in the essential step of hyaluronan biosynthesis. To obtain evidence for the possibility that HAS cDNA encodes hyaluronan synthase, membrane fractions of those stable transfectants were assayed for the hyaluronan synthase activity as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The significant activity was detected in the fractions from the transfectants with HAS cDNA (Table 1). Over all, our data demonstrate that the HAS gene product is responsible for the activity of the hyaluronan synthase and may correspond to synthase itself. Future studies on the activity of recombinant HAS protein will give the final conclusion. We thank Dr. K. Furukawa (Nagasaki University) and Dr. C. Basilico (New York University) for kindly providing pdl3027 plasmid."

Incubation of the insulin-sensitive rat hepatoma Fao cells with bacterial sphingomyelinase (SMase) that causes membrane hydrolysis of sphingomyelin led to a time- and dose-dependent decrease in insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1.

In addition, SMase treatment interrupted the association of the 85-kDa catalytic subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase with IRS-1. A similar impact on IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation was observed after addition of cell-permeable ceramide analogs (C2 and C6). Comparable changes in IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation and electrophoretic mobility were found after exposure of cells to either TNF, SMase, or ceramide.

Davidson N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14768-14775Google Scholar). The biological significance of this latter activity and its role, if any, in the regulation of cellular nucleoside metabolism are currently unknown. In attempting to ascribe an integrated, biological role for Apobec-1, it was difficult to make a priori predictions, since recent reports suggest a range of potential functions. For instance, in addition to its activity as an apoB RNA-directed cytidine deaminase, Apobec-1 is an RNA binding protein, with broad specificity for AU-rich templates(16.Navaratnam N. Bhattacharya S. Fujino T. Patel D. Jarmuz A.L. Scott J. Cell. 1995; 81: 187-195Google Scholar, 18.Anant S. MacGinnitie A.J. Davidson N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14762-14767Google Scholar). Other features suggest the possibility of a biological role for Apobec-1 distant from its function in apoB mRNA editing. These include the observation that Apobec-1 is widely expressed and developmentally regulated in both rat and mouse tissues, including many sites such as the kidney, lung, and spleen, which contain trivial or undetectable amounts of apoB mRNA(13.Teng B.B.

In order to determine the potential biological functions of Apobec-1 in vivo, we have used gene targeting to create mice that are homozygous for an apobec-1 gene knockout. We report that homozygous apobec-1 knockout mice (apobec-1-/-) appear healthy and fertile and have no obvious abnormalities other than the absence of plasma apoB48 and undetectable apoB mRNA editing. Heterozygous (apobec-1+/-) mice manifested reduced levels of apoB mRNA editing in the liver; however, apoB mRNA editing was indistinguishable in the small intestine of apobec-1+/- and wild-type animals. These findings suggest that Apobec-1 is normally present in excess in the mouse small intestine but at limiting concentrations in the liver.

Davidson N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14768-14775Google Scholar). Western blotting of mouse plasma was conducted using 4% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and a rabbit anti-rat apoB antiserum, as described(9.Giannoni F. Bonen D.K. Funahashi T. Hadjiagapiou C. Burant C.F. Davidson N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5932-5936Google Scholar). Total cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations were determined enzymatically using commercial kits (Wako and Sigma, respectively). The oligonucleotide primers were as follows: P1, 5′-CAGAAAGATACTTTCGTCCGAACAC; P2, 5′-GTCATGATCTGGATAGTCACACCGCT; P3 (neo primer), 5′-GATCTCTCGGTGGGATCATTGTTT; P4 (apobec-1, exon 8), 5′-GTGCCACAGTGTACATACAACC; mouse apoB-forward, 5′-ATCTGACTGGGAGAGACAAGTAG, 5′ at nt 6512; mouse apoB-reverse, 5′-CGATCAATAATCTCAGCAATAGTTC, 5′ at nt 6739; mouse primer extension primer, 5′-AGTCATGTGGATCATAATTATCTTTAATATACTGA, 5′ at nt 6674. A sequence replacement vector (Fig. 1) was constructed as detailed (see “Materials and Methods”) using two regions of homology. One region spans intron 4 to intron 5, and a second region spans exon 7 to exon 8 of the endogenous apobec-1 gene. Homologous recombination of the targeting vector with the cognate gene in the chromosome results in the elimination of exon 6 from the targeted allele (Fig. 1A). Elimination of exon 6 is predicted to inactivate the gene, because this region encodes the critical zinc-coordinating residues and the catalytic glutamate. These residues have been shown to be essential for both cytidine deaminase and apoB RNA editing activity of Apobec-1(16.Navaratnam N. Bhattacharya S. Fujino T. Patel D. Jarmuz A.L. Scott J. Cell. 1995; 81: 187-195Google Scholar, 17.MacGinnitie A.J. Anant S. Davidson N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14768-14775Google Scholar, 23.Yamanaka S. Poksay K.S. Balestra M.E. Zeng G.Q. Innerarity T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21725-21734Google Scholar). Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA demonstrated that 6/189 ES cell clones were appropriately targeted, as shown by the presence of diagnostic 6.4- and 6.8-kb fragments following digestion with NcoI and PvuII, respectively (Fig. 1B). Three of the six targeted clones were injected into blastocysts, and each resulted in germline transmission. Mice were genotyped by two separate PCR reactions. One reaction screened for the presence of the neo cassette (Fig. 2B), and a second reaction identified the absence of exon 6 in the targeted allele (Fig. 2A). These genotypes were confirmed by genomic Southern blot analysis (Fig. 1C). Analysis of 43 consecutive offspring from heterozygous intercrosses revealed a distribution of 13 (+/+), 21 (+/-), and 9 (-/-) mice (p = 0.829, X2 analysis versus the expected 1:2:1 distribution). In addition to the absence of exon 6 in the genomic DNA of apobec-1-/- mice (Fig. 2A), an RNase protection assay demonstrated no Apobec-1 mRNA in these mice (Fig. 2C). Consistent with this finding, apobec-1+/- mice demonstrated reduced levels of Apobec-1 mRNA in the liver and small intestine (Fig. 2C). Both apobec-1-/- and apobec-1+/- animals appeared healthy and fertile with normal parameters of weight gain and food consumption. Light microscopic examination of hematoxylin- and eosin-stained sections taken from the liver, kidney, small intestine, stomach, and spleen of representative animals (three per group) revealed no obvious differences (data not shown). Analysis of plasma apoB isomorph distribution demonstrated the absence of apoB48 in apobec-1-/- and reduced levels of apoB48 in apobec-1+/- mice (Fig. 3). Plasma total cholesterol (CH) and triglyceride (TG) concentrations (data given as mean ± S.D., in mg/dl) were not statistically different (p > 0.05 by analysis of variance) in apobec-1-/- (CH, 120 ± 34; TG, 164 ± 38, n = 9) versus apobec-1+/- (CH, 136 ± 26; TG, 174 ± 50, n = 15) versus wild-type animals (CH, 120 ± 23; TG, 155 ± 47, n = 12). Lipoprotein characterization by fast pressure liquid chromatography demonstrated no striking differences in the distribution of cholesterol between apobec-1-/-, apobec-1+/-, and wild-type mice (data not shown). Further analysis, however, using in-bred strains and dietary manipulations, will be required before firm conclusions can be reached on this point. ApoB mRNA was amplified from the liver, small intestine, and kidney of homozygous, heterozygous, and wild-type mice and subjected to primer extension analysis. As illustrated in Fig. 4, there was no detectable apoB mRNA editing in any tissue of the apobec-1-/- mice, implying that Apobec-1 is the sole catalytic subunit of the apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme. The apobec-1+/- mice demonstrated reduced levels of apoB mRNA editing in the liver (47 ± 2% versus 71 ± 7% TAA in wild-type, n = 5 in each group, p = 0.0019), consistent with the reduction in Apobec-1 mRNA abundance noted above. By contrast, the extent of apoB mRNA editing was indistinguishable in the small intestine of apobec-1+/- and wild-type mice (>90% TAA in both groups), despite the reduction in Apobec-1 mRNA abundance. Taken together, these data suggest that Apobec-1 abundance in the liver of mice may be limiting, whereas the small intestine normally contains an excess of this component. ApoB mRNA editing was also abolished in the kidney of apobec-1-/- mice, an observation suggesting that there is no duplication of this RNA editing subunit, even in tissues where Apobec-1 expression occurs independent of any major role in lipoprotein biogenesis. The availability of apobec-1-/- mice will allow us to examine issues relating to the organizational state and function of the complementation factors of the apoB mRNA editing enzyme, specifically in tissue extracts that now express no detectable quantities of the catalytic subunit. It will be informative, for example, to examine intestinal and hepatic extracts prepared from these apobec-1-/- mice for the presence of the RNA binding activities, which correspond to p44 and p60(28.Harris S.G.

Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 222-226Google Scholar), in order to determine whether these functional attributes are retained in the absence of Apobec-1. In addition, it will be of importance to determine whether apobec-1-/- mice are susceptible to atherosclerosis particularly in view of the fact that their serum contains exclusively apoB100. In this regard, their phenotype is similar to that of mice which have been recently generated through targeting of the edited codon of the endogenous apoB gene, such that they express only murine apoB100. 4Farese, R.

It is believed that MTP delivers TG to nascent apoB molecules during the assembly of lipoprotein particles in the secretory pathway. Although in vitro studies have established the mechanism of TG transfer between donor and acceptor membranes, the mechanism of action of MTP in vivo remains unknown. The present studies were undertaken to examine whether or not the transfer of TG to nascent apoB in the endoplasmic reticulum involves the physical interaction between MTP and apoB. HepG2 cells were labeled with [3H]leucine, lysed in a nondenaturing homogenizing buffer, and immunoprecipitated with anti-MTP antiserum. We found that labeled apoB and protein disulfide isomerase were co-immunoprecipitated by this procedure. In addition, we were able to detect the 97-kDa subunit of MTP in these immunoprecipitates by immunoblot. The association of MTP and apoB, as assessed in pulse-labeled cells by co-immunoprecipitation, was transient; apoB was prominent on fluorgraphy at 10 min of chase but minimal thereafter. Oleic acid treatment, which protects apoB from rapid intracellular degradation by increasing TG availability, increased both the degree and the duration of association between MTP and apoB dramatically. Inhibition of TG synthesis by Triacsin D, on the other hand, significantly decreased the MTP-apoB binding. N-Acetyl-leucyl-leucyl-norleucinal, a cysteine protease inhibitor, which directly protects apoB from rapid intracellular degradation but does not affect TG synthesis, increased the interaction between MTP and apoB only slightly, although it did prolong it.

To determine if mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases play a role in mediating the neurotrophic actions of insulin, we identified the MAP kinases present in fetal chick forebrain neurons and examined their regulation by insulin. Cell extracts were fractionated on Mono Q columns, and phosphotransferase activity was measured using myelin basic protein as the substrate. In control neurons, four peaks of MAP kinase activity were resolved. Peaks I, II, and IV were identified by immunoblotting as c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK), and p38 MAP kinase, respectively. Neurons treated with insulin showed a dramatic decrease, 80-90%, in p38 MAP kinase activity without significant changes in the other MAP kinase activities. Insulin decreased the phosphotyrosine content of p38 MAP kinase with maximal effects observed within 5 min. Pretreatment of neurons with sodium orthovanadate blocked the ability of insulin to inhibit the tyrosine phosphorylation and activity of p38 MAP kinase, suggesting that activation of a tyrosine or dual specific phosphatase is necessary for the inhibition of p38 MAP kinase by insulin.

Goldsmith E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14843Google Scholar) and (2.Cano E. Mahadevan L.C. Trends Biochem Sci. 1995; 20: 117Google Scholar)). Many steps of these signaling cascades are conserved in Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, and mammalian cells. In mammalian cells, the extracellular signal-regulated kinases, ERK1 and ERK2, are the prototypic members of the MAP kinase family. ERK1 and ERK2 were originally found to be activated by a number of growth factors that interact with cell surface tyrosine kinase receptors. The main features of the ERK cascade involve p21ras-mediated translocation of an upstream serine kinase, c-Raf, which phosphorylates and activates its downstream protein kinase, MAP kinase kinase (also referred to as MEK or MKK1). MAP kinase kinase, a dual specific protein kinase, activates ERK1 or ERK2, which, in turn, regulates the activity of a variety of cytosolic enzymes and nuclear transcription factors(3.Egan S.E. Weinberg R.A. Nature. 1993; 365: 781Google Scholar). Thus, a signal generated at the cell surface is translated to the nucleus where gene expression is regulated. Recently, other MAP kinases have been identified including c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), which is also referred to as stress-activated protein kinase (4.Kyriakis J.M. Banerjee P. Nikolakaki E. Dai T. Rubie E.A. Ahmad M.F. Avruch J. Woodgett J.R. Nature. 1994; 369: 156Google Scholar, 5.Derijard B. Hibi M. Wu I.H. Barrett T. Su B. Deng T. Karin M. Davis R.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 1025Google Scholar) and p38 MAP kinase, the mammalian homologue of the yeast HOG1 protein kinase(6.Han J. Lee J.-D. Bibbs L. Ulevitch R.J.

A characteristic feature of all the MAP kinases is their activation by phosphorylation on Tyr and Thr residues within a TXY phosphorylation motif, where X can be Glu, Pro, or Gly(1.Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14843Google Scholar, 2.Cano E. Mahadevan L.C. Trends Biochem Sci. 1995; 20: 117Google Scholar). The newly discovered MAP kinases, JNK and p38, appear to have equivalent but distinct upstream kinases that are activated by a wide variety of extracellular stimuli including growth factors, differentiating factors, UV irradiation, heat shock, and changes in osmolarity(4.Kyriakis J.M. Banerjee P. Nikolakaki E. Dai T. Rubie E.A. Ahmad M.F. Avruch J. Woodgett J.R. Nature. 1994; 369: 156Google Scholar, 5.Derijard B. Hibi M. Wu I.H. Barrett T. Su B. Deng T. Karin M. Davis R.J.

Nebreda A.R. Cell. 1994; 78: 1027Google Scholar). In some cases, a given extracellular signal appears to activate multiple MAP kinase pathways, whereas other signals appear to activate a single MAP kinase pathway. In yeast, six distinct MAP kinase pathways have been identified(8.Herskowitz I. Cell. 1995; 80: 187Google Scholar), and it is likely that many more exist in mammalian cells. mitogen-activated protein extracellular signal-related kinase c-Jun N-terminal kinase phosphate-buffered saline myelin basic protein polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis activating transcription factor 2 polyvinylidene difluoride insulin-like growth factor nerve growth factor. The MAP kinase cascade involving ERK1 and ERK2 has been implicated in signal transduction by the insulin receptor. Insulin activates p21ras, Raf-1, MEK, and ERK1/ERK2 in a number of cell types (9.White M.F. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1Google Scholar). Activation of this cascade is mediated by GRB2, a 23-kDa SH2-containing protein, which couples tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 or SHC (both substrates for the insulin receptor kinase) to a p21ras-specific GDP/GTP exchange factor(10.Skolnik E.Y. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1929Google Scholar). Microinjection of Xenopus oocytes with a neutralizing p21ras antibody or a dominant negative p21ras mutant inhibits the meiotic maturation induced by insulin(11.Korn L.J. Siebet C.W. McCormick F. Roth R.A. Science. 1987; 236: 840Google Scholar, 12.Deshpande A.K. Kung H.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 1285Google Scholar). Moreover, overexpression of p21ras oncogenes mimics the effects of insulin on 3T3 cell differentiation, and dominant negative mutants of p21ras block the differentiation process triggered by insulin(13.Benito M. Porras A. Nebreda A.R. Santos E. Science. 1991; 252: 565Google Scholar, 14.Porras A. Nebreda A.R. Benito M. Santos E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21124Google Scholar). Taken together, these data suggest that p21ras-mediated activation of ERK1/ERK2 is critical for certain actions of insulin. However, there is also accumulating evidence that ERK1/ERK2 activation is cell-specific and may not be required or sufficient for all of the cellular effects of insulin. In this study, we examined the regulation of MAP kinases by insulin in cultured fetal neurons from chick forebrain. Insulin acts as a potent neurotrophic factor for these neurons (15.Heidenreich K.A. deVellis G. Gilmore P.R. J. Neurochem. 1988; 51: 878Google Scholar) and other neurons from cerebellum, mesencephalon, cerebral cortex, spinal cord, and hippocampus. Insulin's neurotrophic actions include supporting the growth of neurons in serum-free medium(16.Recio-Pinto E. Rechler M.M. Ishii D.D. J. Neurosci. 1986; 6: 1211Google Scholar, 17.Aizenman Y. de Vellis J. Brain Res. 1987; 406: 32Google Scholar), stimulating neuronal protein synthesis(18.Heidenreich K.A. Toledo S.P. Endocrinology. 1989; 125: 1451Google Scholar), inducing neurite outgrowth(16.Recio-Pinto E. Rechler M.M. Ishii D.D. J. Neurosci. 1986; 6: 1211Google Scholar, 17.Aizenman Y. de Vellis J.

We report here that insulin has no significant effect on ERK or JNK activities in chick forebrain neurons but markedly inhibits a high basal level of p38 MAP kinase in these cells. These results are the first to demonstrate an inhibitory regulation of a MAP kinase by a growth factor. The inhibition of p38 MAP kinase, a kinase that has recently been linked to neuronal programmed cell death(21.Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326Google Scholar), may represent the mechanism by which insulin supports neuronal survival.

Polyclonal anti-JNK antibodies were a kind gift from Dr. Lynn Heasley (University of Colorado Health Sciences Center). Polyclonal anti-p38 antibodies were generously provided by Drs. J. Han and R. Ulevitch (Scripps Research Clinic). Neurons were cultured from day 8 chick forebrain as described previously(22.Robinson L.J. Leitner W. Draznin B. Heidenreich K.A. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 2568Google Scholar). After removing the growth medium, the neurons were rinsed with 2 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) and incubated in 2 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (pH 7.4) containing 20 mM HEPES and 1% bovine serum albumin at 37°C in the absence or presence of growth factors. The times of incubation are indicated in the text. Experiments were terminated by aspirating the buffer and rinsing twice with PBS. After washing in PBS, the neurons were scraped from the dishes, pelleted, and solubilized in lysis buffer (pH 7.2) containing 50 mM β-glycerol phosphate, 5 mM EGTA, 2 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 2 mM sodium orthovanadate, 10 μM leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cell extracts (3-5 mg of protein) were applied at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min to a Mono Q column (Pharmacia fast protein liquid chromatograph HR5/5) equilibrated with Buffer A (50 mM β-glycerol phosphate, 5 mM EGTA, 2 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 2 mM sodium orthovanadate, pH 7.2). The column was developed at the same rate with a linear NaCl gradient (0-800 mM) in Buffer A. Fractions (200 μl) were collected and assayed for protein kinase activity. The protein kinase assay was initiated by the addition of 20 μl of 2 × reaction buffer (50 mM β-glycerol phosphate, 1 mM EGTA, 20 mM MgCl2, 100 μM sodium orthovanadate, 1 mg/ml MBP, or 0.1 mg/ml ATF2 (N-terminal half), 50 μg/ml IP20, a peptide inhibitor of cAMP-dependent protein kinase, 200 μM ATP, and 0.9 mCi/ml [32P]ATP) to 20 μl of column fraction. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 10 min at 30°C and then stopped by the addition of trichloroacetic acid (15%) and placed on ice. A 40-μl aliquot was spotted onto a P-81 phosphocellulose paper square. After washing extensively with 75 mM phosphoric acid, the paper squares were dried, and radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation spectroscopy. When reactions contained ATF2 as the substrate, the reactions were terminated by the addition of 2 × Laemmli sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE using 10% acrylamide gels. After electrophoresis, the gels were dried and subjected to phosphorimaging (GS-100, Bio-Rad). Column fractions were concentrated 10-fold using Centricon 10 concentrators (Amicon, Beverly, MA), solubilized in 2 × Laemmli sample buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 12% acrylamide gels. After electrophoresis, the proteins in the gel were transferred to PVDF membranes and probed with polyclonal anti-JNK antibodies (1:100), monoclonal anti-ERK1/ERK2 antibodies (1:1000), and polyclonal anti-p38 antibodies (1:1000) followed by secondary antibodies coupled to alkaline phosphatase. Bound alkaline phosphatase was visualized by the Western-Light chemiluminescent detection system (Tropix, Bedford, MA). After treating with or without growth factors and washing 2 × in ice-cold PBS, the cells were solubilized in 400 μl of ice-cold immunoprecipitation buffer containing 10 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 0.2 mM sodium orthovanadate, and 0.2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The cell lysates were centrifuged to remove insoluble material, and the supernatants were incubated with 2 μg of PY20 monoclonal anti-Tyr(P) antibodies for 1 h at 4°C followed by incubation with 30 μl of Protein G Plus/Protein A-agarose for an additional hour. The immunocomplexes were pelleted, washed twice in immunoprecipitation buffer, and then solubilized in Laemmli sample buffer. After electrophoresis (12% acrylamide gels), the proteins in the gel were transferred to PVDF membranes and probed with polyclonal anti-p38 antibodies (1:1000) followed by secondary antibodies coupled to horseradish peroxidase. Bound horseradish peroxidase was visualized by the ECL chemiluminescent detection system (Amersham Corp.). To investigate the MAP kinase activities present in fetal neurons, neurons from E8 chick forebrains were cultured for 5 days, and neuronal cell extracts were fractionated by anion exchange chromatography on Mono Q. Phosphotransferase activity was measured in each fraction using MBP as the substrate. Four peaks of MBP kinase activity were resolved (Fig. 1A). The first peak eluted at a NaCl concentration of about 30 mM. This peak contained JNK kinase identified by immunoblotting with anti-JNK antibodies (Fig. 1B) and had the greatest phosphotransferase activity against a GST-c-Jun fusion protein relative to the other fractions (data not shown). Peak II eluted at about 170 mM NaCl and displayed immunoreactivity with an antibody that recognizes the C terminus of both ERK1 and ERK2 (Fig. 1, A and B). The identity of Peak III, which eluted over a wide range of salt concentrations and showed no cross-reactivity with any of the MAP kinase antibodies used, is unknown. Peak IV eluted at about 420 mM NaCl and contained the majority of neuronal MBP kinase activity. Analysis of this peak by MBP-impregnated gel assays revealed a 38-kDa kinase (data not shown), and immunoblot analysis demonstrated positive cross-reactivity with anti-mouse p38 antibodies (Fig. 1, A and B). All four peaks of MBP kinase activity could be absorbed to phenyl-Sepharose, which is a common feature of MAP kinases (data not shown). When neurons were treated with insulin (50 ng/ml), a potent neurotrophin for these cells, for 15 min at 37°C prior to fractionation of cell lysates on Mono Q columns, there was a dramatic and very consistent decrease (80-90%, n = 3) in the activity of Peak IV without major changes in the other MAP kinase activities (Fig. 1A). The inhibition of p38 MAP kinase activity by insulin was specific for this polypeptide since IGF-I at the same concentration had no effect on p38 MAP kinase activity, despite the 10-fold higher number of IGF-I receptors on these neurons. Exposure of the neurons to sorbitol (200 μM), a known activator of p38 MAP kinase(6.Han J. Lee J.-D. Bibbs L. Ulevitch R.J. Science. 1994; 265: 808Google Scholar), resulted in a 20% increase in Peak IV kinase activity (data not shown). The relatively low stimulation of p38 MAP kinase activity by sorbitol is most likely related to the high basal level of p38 MAP kinase activity in these neurons. The inhibition of MAP kinase activity by insulin was specific for p38 MAP kinase since the other MAP kinases present were not significantly affected by insulin. This was demonstrated by examining the phosphotransferase activities of the various MAP kinases using the N-terminal half of ATF2 as the substrate (Fig. 2). Insulin inhibited the ATF2 phosphotransferase activity of p38 MAP kinase by 90% with no significant effect on the phosphotransferase activities of the other MAP kinases. ATF2 was observed to be the best substrate for p38 when compared with MBP and the epidermal growth factor receptor peptide (data not shown). MAP kinases are activated by phosphorylation of critical tyrosine and threonine residues. To determine if the inhibition of p38 MAP kinase activity by insulin was due to changes in the tyrosine phosphorylation state of the enzyme, control and insulin-treated neuronal cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (PY20), and the phosphotyrosine-containing proteins in the precipitants were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-p38 antibodies. The results demonstrated that insulin, but not sorbitol or IGF-I, decreased the phosphotyrosine content of p38 (Fig. 3A). The effect of insulin was maximal by 5 min and sustained out to 15 min (Fig. 3, B and C). After 15 min, the phosphotyrosine content of p38 began to approach control levels. Similar results were obtained by immunoprecipitating neuronal cell extracts with p38 antibodies and then subsequently Western blotting with PY20. To determine whether activation of a phosphatase might be involved in the inhibition of p38 MAP kinase by insulin, neurons were treated with sodium orthovanadate (1 mM), an inhibitor of tyrosine and dual specific phosphatases, 10 min prior to the addition of insulin. Sodium orthovanadate had no effect on the basal levels of p38 phosphotyrosine content but totally blocked the ability of insulin to decrease the phosphotyrosine content of p38 MAP kinase (Fig. 4). The decrease in phosphotyrosine content was indicative of decreased kinase activity, suggesting that activation of a tyrosine phosphatase or a dual specific phosphatase is necessary for the inhibition of p38 MAP kinase by insulin. This activated phosphatase may act directly on p38 MAP kinase or at steps upstream of p38 MAP kinase, which are regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation. Although ERK, JNK, and p38 MAP kinase are structurally related kinases and are stimulated by similar kinase cascades, they are activated by different extracellular stimuli and have different substrate specificities(1.Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14843Google Scholar, 2.Cano E. Mahadevan L.C. Trends Biochem Sci. 1995; 20: 117Google Scholar). The p38 MAP kinase was originally described as the mammalian homologue of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae HOG1 kinase involved in osmoregulation in the yeast. In mammalian cells, p38 MAP kinase is activated by changes in osmolarity, bacterial endosomes, and heat shock(6.Han J. Lee J.-D. Bibbs L. Ulevitch R.J. Science. 1994; 265: 808Google Scholar). Very recently, p38 MAP kinase has been implicated in neuronal programmed cell death(21.Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326Google Scholar). In differentiated PC12 cells, NGF withdrawal results in apoptosis, which is preceded by an increase in p38 MAP kinase activity. Introduction of the dominant negative mutant of MKK3, the upstream regulator of p38 MAP kinase, blocks the apoptosis induced by NGF withdrawal, whereas introduction of the constitutively activated form of MKK3 induced apoptosis in PC12 cells. Thus, stimulation of p38 MAP kinase by NGF withdrawal appears to mediate neuronal programmed cell death. These data, taken together with the results from the present study, suggest that the mechanism by which insulin supports neuronal survival involves inhibition of p38 MAP kinase. This is the first evidence for negative regulation of p38 MAP kinase by a trophic factor and suggests that this MAP kinase may be an important target for other neurotrophic factors. We acknowledge Dr. Richard Ulevitch and Dr. Jiahual Han for their kind gift of p38 antibodies and Dr. Lynn Heasley for the ATF2 and anti-JNK antibodies."
https://openalex.org/W2031928941,"In terminally differentiated ileal villus Na+-absorptive cells, epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulates NaCl absorption and its component brush border Na+/H+ exchanger, acting via basolateral membrane receptors, and as we confirm here, a brush border tyrosine kinase. In the present study we show that brush border phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) is involved in EGF stimulation of NaCl absorption and brush border Na+/H+ exchange. In rabbit ileum studied with the Ussing chamber-voltage clamp technique, EGF stimulation of active NaCl absorption is inhibited by the selective PI 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin. PI 3-kinase, a largely cytosolic enzyme, translocates specifically to the brush border of ileal absorptive cells following EGF treatment. This translocation occurs as early as 1 min after EGF treatment and remains increased at the brush border for at least 15 min. EGF also causes a rapid (1 min) and large (4-5-fold) increase in brush border PI 3-kinase activity. Involvement of PI 3-kinase activity in intestinal Na+ absorption is established further by studies done in the human colon cancer cell line, Caco-2, stably transfected with the intestinal brush border isoform of the Na+/H+ exchanger, NHE3 (Caco-2/NHE3 cells). Brush border Na+/H+ exchange activity was measured using the pH-sensitive fluorescent dye 2′7′-bis(carboxyethyl)5-(6)-carboxyfluorescein. EGF added to the basolateral surface but not apical surface of Caco-2/NHE3 cells increased brush border Na+/H+ exchange activity. The EGF-induced increase in brush border Na+/H+ exchange activity was completely abolished in cells pretreated with wortmannin. EGF treatment caused increased tyrosine phosphorylation of PI 3-kinase in both ileal brush border membranes and Caco-2/NHE3 cells, suggesting that a tyrosine kinase upstream of the PI 3-kinase is involved in the EGF effects on Na+ absorption. In conclusion, the present study provides evidence in two separate intestinal models, the ileum and a human colon cancer cell line, that PI 3-kinase is an intermediate in EGF stimulation of intestinal Na+ absorption.

Montgomery J.L.M. Walker M.S. Cohen M.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: G647-G656Google Scholar). Biochemically very little is known about the steps involved between binding of EGF to its receptor at the BLM and stimulation of NaCl absorption, other than the EGF effects involve tyrosine kinases at both the brush border membranes (BBMs) and BLMs(1.Donowitz M. Montgomery J.L.M. Walker M.S. Cohen M.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: G647-G656Google Scholar). In addition, EGF increased tyrosine phosphorylation of an ileal brush border protein of 85 kDa, 2S.

Since the enzyme forms a complex with growth factor receptors and with oncogene products, it has been implicated in the growth signaling mechanism of receptors and oncogenes that act through tyrosine kinases. In addition, PI 3-kinase is emerging as a critical enzyme in intracellular signaling pathways in nonmitogenic stimuli(6.Downes C.P. Carter A.N. Cell Signaling. 1991; 3: 501-513Google Scholar, 7.Zhang J. Fry M.J. Waterfield M.D. Jaken S. Liao L. Fox J.E.B. Rittenhouse S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4686-4692Google Scholar, 8.Kelly K.L. Ruderman N.B. Chen K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3423-3428Google Scholar). However, in nonmitogenic cells the nature and site of interaction of PI 3-kinase with other signaling molecules have not been established. The majority of PI 3-kinase activity is found in the soluble fraction of resting cells, although a significant fraction is associated with the membrane in growth factor-stimulated and/or oncogene-transformed fibroblasts (9.Cohen B.

Recruitment of PI 3-kinase from the cytosol to the plasma membrane, where its substrate phosphatidylinositides are enriched, is part of PI 3-kinase-mediated signaling in stimulated cells. Activation of some plasma membrane transport proteins including GLUT-4, water channels, and H+ pump involves exocytic movement of the transporters(11.Suzuki K. Kono T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 2542-2545Google Scholar, 12.Holmgren K. Magnusson K.-E. Franki N. Hays R.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: C672-C677Google Scholar, 13.Cannon C. Adelsberg J.V. Kelly S. Al-Awqati Q.

Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 195: 762-768Google Scholar). Whether PI 3-kinase is similarly involved in regulation of transport processes in epithelial cells is unknown. Ileal Na+-absorbing cells are polarized epithelial cells in the villus and upper crypt. Their cell surface is divided into two domains, the luminally facing apical domain which is separated by tight junctions from the basolateral domain. We have shown that the signal transduction processes stimulated by BLM receptors in these cells are distinct in these two domains(18.Khurana S. Kreydiyyeh S. Aronzon A. Hoogerwerf W.A. Rhee S.G. Donowitz M. Cohen M.E. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 509-518Google Scholar, 19.Cohen M.E. Wesolek J. McCullen J. Rys-Sikora K. Pandol S. Rood R.P. Sharp G.W.G. Donowitz M. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 855-863Google Scholar). We now demonstrate a role for PI 3-kinase in regulation of Na+ absorption in a polarized epithelial cell. We show that EGF acts on ileal BLM receptors to increase selectively the amount and activity of apical membrane PI 3-kinase and that PI 3-kinase is involved in EGF stimulation of apical membrane Na+/H+ exchange. Sodium orthovanadate, β-glycerophosphate, phenylalanine, phosphorhamidone, aprotinin, leupeptin, EGF, PI, Triton X-100, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate, wortmannin, potassium oxalate, butylated hydroxytoluene, ethoxyquin, and dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) were obtained from Sigma.

Anti-PI 3-kinase polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies were from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. Anti-phosphotyrosine polyclonal antibody was from Zymed. Prestained protein molecular weight standards were from Bio-Rad (high molecular weight range). Chemiluminescence reagents were from DuPont NEN. Silica Gel 60 plates were from Merck. Fetal bovine serum was from HyClone Laboratories. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium was from Life Technologies, Inc. Tetramethylammonium (TMA) was from Fluka Chemical Corp. Nigericin and the acetoxymethyl ester of BCECF (BCECF-AM) were from Molecular Probes. [[γ-32P]ATP (3,000 Ci/mmol) was from Amersham Corp. Caco-2 cells obtained from American Type Culture Collection were stably transfected with the full-length cDNA for the rabbit intestinal brush border Na+/H+ exchanger isoform, NHE3 (Caco-2/NHE3 cells) and grown as reported previously(20.Tse C.-M. Levine S.A. Yun C.H.C. Brant S.R. Pouyssegur J. Montrose M.H. Donowitz M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9110-9114Google Scholar). These cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 26 mM NaHCO3, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 1% nonessential amino acids (Life Technologies, Inc.), pH 7.4, in 5% CO2, 95% O2 at 37°C. Cells were grown with G418 (400 μg/ml) added to the medium to select for successfully transfected cells. Cells were seeded on Falcon cell culture inserts (Becton Dickinson) and grown to confluence. Then cells were further acid selected. Cells were acidified with 50 mM NH4Cl and allowed to recover pHi for 1 h by the addition of 2 mM Na+ solution (see below; TMA+ solution with 2 mM NaCl and 128 mM TMA+) to the apical surface only, with TMA+ solution on the basolateral surface. This acid selection protocol was repeated 3 days later; then cells were removed from the filters by trypsinization and seeded into plastic flasks as stock cultures. For fluorometry experiments, cells were seeded at 1:5 density on polyethylene terephthalate membranes (0.45 μm, Falcon cell culture membranes, Becton Dickinson), which covered an oval aperture in plastic coverslips, and grown in media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells reached confluence by day 5 and were studied between days 1 and 3 postconfluence. The cells were incubated with 5 μM BCECF-AM and with 40 mM NH4Cl in Na+ medium (containing in mM: 130 NaCl, 5 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgSO4, 1 NaH2PO4, 25 glucose, 20 HEPES, pH 7.4) for 40-60 min at 23°C, then washed with TMA+ medium (containing in mM: 130 TMA chloride, 5 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgSO4, 1 NaH2PO4, 25 glucose, 20 HEPES, pH 7.4) to remove the extracellular dye and to acidify the cells. The coverslip was mounted in a 100-μl fluorometer cuvette designed for perfusion as described earlier(21.Levine S.A. Montrose M.H. Tse C.-M. Donowitz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25527-25535Google Scholar). Cells were perfused with Na+ medium in the apical compartment and with TMA+ medium in the basolateral compartment. EGF (100 ng/ml) in TMA+ medium was added to the basolateral chamber of the cuvette after cells had reached steady-state pHi. In some experiments, cells were pretreated with wortmannin (100 nM, 30 min) during the dye loading period. Calibration of experiments was done using the nigericin/high K+ method as described previously(21.Levine S.A. Montrose M.H. Tse C.-M. Donowitz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25527-25535Google Scholar). Distal ileum from 2-2.5-kg New Zealand White male rabbits was used for all experiments described below. Rabbits were killed by nembutal overdose. The ileum was then removed and rinsed with 0.9% saline. For measurement of active Na+ and Cl- transport and preparation of BBMs, ileal tissue was used. For preparation of BLMs, isolated ileal villus cells were used. The tissue or cells were preincubated for 10 min at 37°C gassed with 95% O2, 5% CO2 in Ringer's HCO3 containing 10 mM glucose. 200 ng/ml EGF was then added to one set of tissues, and the incubation was continued for the indicated times. The tissues were then chilled, and control and EGF-treated samples were processed in parallel; all steps were at 4°C unless stated otherwise. At the end of the above incubation, ileal sheets were chilled on iced Petri dishes, and mucosa were lightly scraped off with glass slides. The tissues were homogenized in 10 volumes of 20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 1 mM β-glycerophosphate, 1 mM phenylalanine, 0.28 mM PMSF, 25 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.01% leupeptin, 1.006 mM CaCl2, 1 mM EGTA (free Ca2+ = 10 μM) (buffer A) with a Polytron homogenizer at a setting of 5 with 10 10-s bursts with 20-s cooling intervals. BBMs were prepared by double Mg2+ precipitation as reported previously(18.Khurana S. Kreydiyyeh S. Aronzon A. Hoogerwerf W.A. Rhee S.G. Donowitz M. Cohen M.E. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 509-518Google Scholar). The final BBM pellets were resuspended in 20 mM Tris, 250 mM sorbitol, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, pH 7.5, with five strokes of a Teflon-glass homogenizer. Purification judged by enrichment of sucrase specific activity compared with homogenate was 15-17-fold, similar to that reported previously(18.Khurana S. Kreydiyyeh S. Aronzon A. Hoogerwerf W.A. Rhee S.G. Donowitz M. Cohen M.E. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 509-518Google Scholar). BLMs were prepared from isolated villus cells instead of scraped mucosa because the BLM of an enterocyte is indistinguishable from the plasma membrane of other cells, and the ileum is composed of more than one cell type. Isolated villus cells were obtained by a modification of the method of Weiser (22.Weiser M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 2536-2541Google Scholar) as reported previously using everted ileum(18.Khurana S. Kreydiyyeh S. Aronzon A. Hoogerwerf W.A. Rhee S.G. Donowitz M. Cohen M.E. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 509-518Google Scholar). BLMs were then prepared as described previously utilizing Dounce homogenization and a 14% Percoll gradient(18.Khurana S. Kreydiyyeh S. Aronzon A. Hoogerwerf W.A. Rhee S.G. Donowitz M. Cohen M.E. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 509-518Google Scholar). The BLM pellets were resuspended in 20 mM Tris, 250 mM sorbitol, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, pH 7.5. Purification as judged by enrichment of Na/K-ATPase specific activity compared with homogenate was 10-14 fold; and these membrane fractions were essentially free of BBM, as measured by sucrase specific activity(18.Khurana S. Kreydiyyeh S. Aronzon A. Hoogerwerf W.A. Rhee S.G. Donowitz M. Cohen M.E. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 509-518Google Scholar). The methods used to measure active ileal electrolyte transport have been described previously(19.Cohen M.E. Wesolek J. McCullen J. Rys-Sikora K. Pandol S. Rood R.P. Sharp G.W.G. Donowitz M. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 855-863Google Scholar). In brief, ileal mucosa, with serosa and muscularis propria removed, was mounted as a flat sheet between two Lucite-modified Ussing chambers having an aperture of 1.13 cm2, oxygenated, and maintained at 37°C. Transmural potential difference, short circuit current (Isc), conductance, and unidirectional fluxes of Na+ and Cl- were determined. An automatic voltage clamp corrected for fluid resistance between the potential difference-sensing bridges and provided continuous short circuiting of the tissue. Unidirectional fluxes of Na+ and/or Cl- were measured 20-100 min after the addition of isotope using 22Na+ and 36Cl- on tissue matched to differ in conductance by not more than 25%. In ion flux experiments, a negative sign indicates net secretion, a positive sign, net absorption. Usually six pieces of ileum from a single animal were studied simultaneously. Unless specified, the bathing solution consisted of Ringer's HCO3 composed (in mM) of: 115 NaCl, 25 NaHCO3, 2.4 K2HPO4, 0.4 KH2PO4, 1.2 CaCl2, 1.2 MgCl2; the pH was 7.4 after gassing with 95% O2, 5% CO2. Ten mM glucose was added to the serosal and 10 mM mannitol to the mucosal bathing fluids at the time of mounting the tissue. Effects of EGF (200 ng/ml) added to the serosal surface were determined over a 15-min flux period in otherwise untreated ileum, starting 15 min after EGF addition, and in tissue preincubated with wortmannin (100 nM) added to the ileal mucosal plus serosal surfaces. Ileal segments were exposed in vitro to EGF (200 ng/ml) or control for 15 min. Villus cells were then scraped on ice with a glass slide, and BBM vesicles were prepared for transport studies as described previously(23.Cohen M.E. Reinlib L. Gorelick F. Rys-Sikora K. Tse C.-M.

Cells were homogenized with a Brinkmann Polytron homogenizer using 10 10-s bursts with 20-s intervals in a solution containing (in mM): 60 mannitol, 2.4 Tris-HCl, pH 7.1, 1 EGTA, 0.32 PMSF, 0.006 phosphorhamidone, and 0.3 aprotinin trypsin inhibitor units/ml.

The final brush border pellet was resuspended in (in mM): 200 mannitol, 40 MOPSO, 11.4 Tris, pH 6.5, and 5 Mg (gluconate)2 with genistein (100 μM) dissolved in ethanol or 0.5% ethanol control; or genistin (100 μM) dissolved in Me2SO or 0.5% Me2SO control. Vesicles were frozen in liquid N2 overnight and next day thawed gradually on ice; under these conditions these vesicles have been shown to be opened by freeze thaw(25.Donowitz M. Emmer E. McCullen J. Reinlib L. Cohen M.E. Rood R.P. Madara J. Sharp G.W.G. Murer H. Malmstrom K. Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 252: G723-G735Google Scholar). Na+ transport buffers consisted of either (in mM): 187 mannitol, 37 MOPSO, 10.6 Tris, pH 6.5, 4.7 Mg(gluconate)2, 1.0 sodium gluconate (22Na+ 33-37 μCi/ml, DuPont NEN); or 187 mannitol, 28 Tris, 9.62 MES, pH 8.0, 4.7 Mg(gluconate)2, 1.0 sodium gluconate, with both solutions containing 100 μM genistein, or 0.5% ethanol; or 100 μM genistin or 0.5% Me2SO control. The glucose transport buffer contained (in mM): 80 mannitol, 40 MOPSO, 11.4 Tris, pH 6.5, 2 EGTA, 5 Mg(gluconate)2, 60 NaCl, 0.1 D-glucose ([3H]glucose, 20 μCi/ml, DuPont NEN). 22Na+ initial rates of uptake and [3H]glucose uptake were measured by mixing 15 μl of membranes with 30 μl of transport buffer at 25°C, as described (23.Cohen M.E. Reinlib L. Gorelick F. Rys-Sikora K. Tse C.-M. Rood R.P. Czernik A.S. Sharp G.W.G. Donowitz M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8990-8994Google Scholar, 24.Emmer E. Rood R.P. Wesolek J.H.

For 22Na+ uptake, the reaction was stopped electronically after 3, 5, or 8 s by injection of 1 ml of ice-cold stop solution. [3H]Glucose uptake was stopped after 90 s, a time not during the linear phase of uptake. Glucose equilibrium values were determined after a 90-min incubation at 25°C. Reaction mixture was then vacuum filtered through nitrocellulose filters, 0.45-μM pore size (Millipore, Bedford, MA) and rinsed with 6 ml of stop solution. Stop solutions contained (in mM) either 40 mannitol, 90 potassium gluconate, 15.6 MES, 20 Tris, pH 8.0; or 40 mannitol, 90 potassium gluconate, 20 MOPSO, 5.6 Tris, pH 6.5. The filters were dissolved in 4 ml of scintillant, and radioactivity was determined in a liquid scintillation spectrometer (Beckman L5 7500). Initial uptake rates of Na+/H+ exchange were expressed in pmol/mg of protein/s using linear regression analyses; glucose uptake was expressed as pmol/mg of protein. Fifty μg of membrane proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (7%), transferred to nitrocellulose filters (Bioblot, Costar), and probed with monoclonal antibodies to the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., 05-217). Immunostained proteins were visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system according to the instructions of the supplier. Quantitation of PI 3-kinase was by computerized densitometry (Image- Quant, Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) using enhanced chemiluminescence under conditions in which the PI 3-kinase signal was not saturated. BBMs or BLMs (250 μg of protein) were lysed in buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 100 mM NaCl, 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.2, 1 mM Na3VO4, 50 mM NaF, 1 mM PMSF, 25 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.01% leupeptin, and 4 μg/ml phosphorhamidone at 4°C for 20 min. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 4°C for 10 min at 10,000 × g. The supernatants were incubated with 3 μl of polyclonal antibodies to PI 3-kinase (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., 06-195) overnight at 4°C with rocking. Fifty μl of a 10% (w/v) solution of formalin-fixed Staphylococcus aureus cells (Pansorbin, Calbiochem) was then added to each sample and the incubation continued for an additional hour. The immunoprecipitates were collected and washed once with lysis buffer, twice with 0.5 M LiCl, 0.1 M Tris, pH 7.4, and washed finally with 10 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA. The lipid kinase assay was performed on immunoprecipitated PI 3-kinase in buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM EGTA, 5 mM MgCl2, 30 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3,000 Ci/mmol, 20 μM ATP), phophatidylinositol (0.2 mg/ml, Sigma) dispersed by sonication in 5 mM HEPES, 10 mM EDTA, pH 7.4. The reaction mixture was incubated for 15 min at 30°C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 50 μl of 1 M HCl. The lipid products were extracted in 100 μl of CHCl3:MeOH (1:1 v/v) and analyzed by thin layer chromatography on Silica Gel 60 plates (Merck) pretreated with 1% potassium oxalate, using a solvent system of CHCl3, MeOH, 4 M NH4OH, H2O (86:76:10:14 v/v). The lipid products were extracted and separated in the presence of 0.005% butylated hydroxytoluene and ethoxyquin. Unlabeled phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate used as a standard was run in parallel and visualized by exposure to iodine vapors. Lipids were quantitated with computerized densitometry of the autoradiogram and by scraping the appropriate bands of silica gel which were subjected to scintillation counting. BBMs were lysed in buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 as described above. Immunoprecipitations were done on detergent-soluble fractions using polyclonal antibodies to either PI 3-kinase or phosphotyrosine (Zymed, 61-5800). The immunoprecipitated proteins were probed by Western analysis using polyclonal antibody to phosphotyrosine. Caco-2/NHE3 cells were seeded on Falcon cell culture inserts and serum deprived overnight prior to the experiment. Serum-starved cells were treated with EGF (100 ng/ml, 1 or 15 min) added to the basolateral surface in control cells or cells preincubated with wortmannin (100 nM, 30 min). The wortmannin was added to both the apical and basolateral surfaces. The cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with RIPA buffer containing 0.15 M NaCl, 15 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 10 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 1 mM PMSF, 25 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.01% leupeptin, and 4 μg/ml phosphorhamidone. Tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were immunoprecipitated using a polyclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Zymed, 61-5800). The immunoprecipitates were washed and the PI 3-kinase activity determined on the immunoprecipitates as described above. The effects of EGF (200 ng/ml) on active ileal Na+ and Cl- transport were studied using the Ussing chamber-voltage clamp technique. Serosal addition of EGF stimulated NaCl absorption (Fig. 1) in rabbit ileum and caused a short lived increase in Isc, as reported previously(1.Donowitz M. Montgomery J.L.M. Walker M.S. Cohen M.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: G647-G656Google Scholar). Starting 15 min after EGF addition, a 15-min flux study was performed, a time during which ileal Isc was constant and similar to that during two 20-min basal flux periods in the same tissue before the addition of EGF. Serosal addition of EGF caused a statistically significant increase in mucosal-to-serosal and net Na+ and Cl- fluxes (Fig. 1). It also caused a small but statistically significant increase in the serosal-to-mucosal Cl- flux (p < 0.01) (Fig. 1). These data show that EGF increases ileal active Na+ and Cl- absorption. The PI 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin added to the ileal mucosal and serosal surfaces (100 nM) did not alter basal active electrolyte transport (Fig. 2). Also, the D-glucose-stimulated increase in Na+ absorption was not altered by wortmannin (3.0 ± 0.5 versus 2.9 ± 0.5 μEq/cm2-h in control and wortmannin treated tissue, respectively, n = 7; not significant). The effects of wortmannin on the transport effects caused by serosal EGF were determined (Fig. 3). The addition of wortmannin prevented the EGF effect to increase the mucosal-to-serosal and net Na+ and Cl- fluxes. Wortmannin did not alter the magnitude of the increase in serosal-to-mucosal Cl- flux or the short lived increase in Isc seen with EGF (0.3 ± 0.1 versus 0.3 ± 0.05 μEq/cm2-h in the absence versus in the presence of wortmannin, respectively, n = 7, ns), suggesting that wortmannin only affects the EGF-stimulated NaCl-absorptive process. Studies were undertaken to determine whether EGF acting via BLM receptors causes prolonged effects on apical membrane Na+/H+ exchange and whether an apical membrane tyrosine kinase is involved. Brush border vesicles made from ileum exposed in vitro to EGF exhibited increased Na+/H+ exchange compared with control vesicles (Fig. 4). This was exerted only on Na+ uptake in the presence of an acid inside pH gradient and not in the absence of a pH gradient. Genistein (100 μM) freeze thawed into control vesicles inhibited basal Na+/H+ exchange, again via an effect only on Na+ uptake in the presence of an acid inside pH gradient. When genistein was freeze thawed into brush border vesicles made from ileum exposed in vitro to EGF, Na+/H+ exchange was reduced even more than the decrease in control vesicles caused by genistein, to a rate not significantly different from control/genistein vesicles. In contrast, genistin did not alter basal Na+/H+ exchange or the EGF-stimulated brush border Na+/H+ exchange (data not shown). In contrast to these results, Na+-dependent D-glucose uptake was not affected by EGF treatment or by genistein (Table 1). Thus, brush border vesicles made from EGF-exposed ileum maintain a memory of in vitro exposure to EGF with a prolonged stimulation of Na+/H+ exchange. Also, a brush border tyrosine kinase(s) is involved in control of brush border bas"

The cytoplasmic Raf and mitogen-activated protein (MAPK) kinases were found to differentially regulate αI(I) collagen gene expression in activated stellate cells. This suggests an unappreciated branch point exists between Raf and MAPK. A MAPK-stimulatory signal was mapped to the most proximal NF-1 and Sp-1 binding domains of the 5′-untranslated region of the collagen gene. A Raf-inhibitory signal was mapped to a further upstream binding domain involving a novel 60-kDa DNA-binding protein (p60). The cell-specific expression and induction of p60 in stellate cells during the early stages of hepatic fibrogenesis in vivo suggest a central role for this pathway during liver injury and stellate cell activation.

These data are compatible with a role of the common β3 subunit of both receptors in establishing their RGD ligand recognition.In addition to their common RGD recognition, several ligands with proported specificity for αIIbβ3 or αvβ3 have been identified. The prototype of these are the fibrinogen γ-chain peptides. Peptides with sequences corresponding to the carboxyl terminus of the γ-chain of fibrinogen block ligand binding to αIIbβ3, but are poor inhibitors of ligand binding to αvβ3(16.Smith J.W. Ruggeri Z.M. Kunicki T.J. Cheresh D.A. J. Biol.

In contrast, several other disintegrins block ligand binding to both receptors. Distinguishing barbourin from other disintegrins is the presence of a KGD, rather than a RGD, sequence; and the Lys residue is critical for specificity(24.Scarborough R.M. Rose J.W. Hsu M.A. Phillips D.R. Fried V.A. Campbell A.M. Nannizzi L. Charo I.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9359-9362Google Scholar). In following this observation, Scarborough et al.(25.Scarborough R.M. Naughton M.A. Teng W. Rose J.W. Phillips D.R. Nannizzi L. Arsten A. Campbell A.M. Charo I.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1066-1073Google Scholar) synthesized a series of peptides and ultimately identified small, conformationally constrained cyclic derivatives as highly potent agonists of αIIbβ3 function. A cyclic homoarginine (Har) 1The abbreviations used are: HarhomoargininecHarGDcyclic homoarginine-glycine-aspartic acid-containing peptide, KYGC(s-s)HarGDWPC(s-s)BS3bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberateIC50concentration required to give 50% inhibition of bindingmAbmonoclonal antibodyPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. -glycine-aspartic acid-containing peptide was one of the most potent representative of this series. This compound showed substantial specificity for αIIbβ3versus αvβ3, as compared to linear RGD-containing peptides, although it could block αvβ3-mediated cell adhesion(25.Scarborough R.M. Naughton M.A. Teng W. Rose J.W. Phillips D.R. Nannizzi L. Arsten A. Campbell A.M. Charo I.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1066-1073Google Scholar).Divalent cations are required to support the ligand binding functions of the β3 integrins described above as well as for the recognition of most ligands by integrins(26.Ruoslahti E. Pierschbacher M.D. Science. 1987; 238: 491-496Google Scholar, 27.Haas T.A. Plow E.F. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 656-662Google Scholar). This requirement depends on the direct binding of cations to the integrin subunits, and it is generally accepted that the divalent cation binding and ligand binding sites reside in close proximity within integrins, including the β3 integrins(23.D'Souza S.E. Ginsberg M.H. Burke T.A. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3440-3446Google Scholar, 28.Smith J.W. Cheresh D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2168-2172Google Scholar, 29.Smith J.W. Cheresh D.A. J. Biol.

Cell. 1994; 79: 659-667Google Scholar). Ligand binding to many integrins is differentially regulated by divalent cations. Numerous examples have been described in which the ligand specificity of members of the β1 and β2 integrin subfamilies are divalent cation determined(31.Gailit J. Ruoslahti E. J. Biol.

Recently, differential regulation of ligand binding to β3 integrins also has been reported (37.Smith J.W. Piotrowicz R.S. Mathis D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 960-967Google Scholar) as fibrinogen did not bind to αvβ3 in the presence of Ca2+, but Mn2+ did support this interaction. This observation has brought the entire issue of the relative specificity of β3 integrins into question.In the present study, we have examined the interaction of a cyclic HarGD-containing peptide (cHarGD) with αIIbβ3 and αvβ3. These studies were initiated to test the hypothesis that cHarGD would represent a high affinity mimetic of fibrinogen and its γ-chain peptides. The high affinity binding of this peptide to αIIbβ3 is demonstrated by direct binding studies with the isolated receptor and platelets. Overall, the results document the complexity of ligand recognition by β3 integrins and allow discrimination of multiple classes of β3 ligands.MATERIALS AND METHODSPurification of ProteinsFibrinogen was purified from human fresh-frozen plasma by differential ethanol precipitation(38.Plow E.F. Srouji A.H. Meyer D. Marguerie G. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5388-5391Google Scholar). Vitronectin was purified from human plasma by heparin-Sepharose chromatography in 8 M urea(39.Yatohgo T. Izumi M. Kashiwagi H. Hayashi M. Cell Struct. Funct. 1988; 13: 281-292Google Scholar). αIIbβ3 was purified from octyl glucoside extracts of human platelets by affinity chromatography using GRGDSPK-Sepharose columns(40.Pytela R. Pierschbacher M.D. Ginsberg M.H. Plow E.F. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1986; 231: 1559-1562Google Scholar). αvβ3 was purified from human placenta by affinity chromatography with αvβ3-specific monoclonal antibody (mAb) LM609(18.Smith J.W. Cheresh D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18726-18731Google Scholar). This material did not contain detectable levels of αIIbβ3 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Barbourin was purified from lyophilized snake venom, Sistrurus m. barbouri, purchased from Miami Serpentarium Labs (Punta Gorda, FL) as described (24.Scarborough R.M. Rose J.W. Hsu M.A. Phillips D.R.

Charo I.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1058-1065Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, venom was dissolved in 0.5 M acetic acid and was applied to a Sephadex G-50 column (1.0 × 100 cm) equilibrated in 0.5 M acetic acid. Fractions inhibiting fibrinogen binding to αIIbβ3 were lyophilized, and barbourin was purified to homogeneity by high performance liquid chromatography using a C18 Vydac column.Peptides and AntibodiesRGD-containing peptides (KYGRGDS and GRGDSP), GRGESP peptide and fibrinogen γ-chain peptides, KYGGHHLGGAKQAGDV (K16) and HHLGGAKQAGDV (H12), were prepared as described(42.D'Souza S.E. Ginsberg M.H. Lam S.C.-T. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3943-3951Google Scholar). Cyclic HarGD peptide (cHarGD), KYGC(s-s)HarGDWPC(s-s), was synthesized by the same method and cyclized with potassium ferricyanide as described(25.Scarborough R.M. Naughton M.A. Teng W. Rose J.W. Phillips D.R. Nannizzi L. Arsten A. Campbell A.M. Charo I.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1066-1073Google Scholar). The peptides were purified to homogeneity by high performance liquid chromatography using a C18 Vydac column and characterized by amino acid composition. Monoclonal antibody 7E3 (43.Coller B.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 76: 101-108Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Dr. Barry S. Coller, Mt. Sinai School of Medicine, NY.RadioiodinationNa125I (specific activity = 15-17 mCi 125I/μg of iodine) from Amersham Life Science Inc. was used for radioiodination. Fibrinogen and vitronectin were radiolabeled using a modified chloramine-T method(38.Plow E.F. Srouji A.H. Meyer D. Marguerie G. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5388-5391Google Scholar), and synthetic peptides and barbourin were radiolabeled using IODO-GEN (Pierce). The iodinated peptides were separated from free Na125I by gel filtration on a Bio-Gel P-2 column (Bio-Rad). For selected experiments, cHarGD was “mock-labeled”; nonradioactive iodine was substituted for the 125I, but all other aspects of the procedure were the same.Solid-phase Ligand Binding AssayThe binding of fibrinogen, cHarGD, and barbourin to immobilized αIIbβ3 and αvβ3 was performed as described by Charo et al.(15.Charo I.F. Nannizzi L. Smith J.W. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2795-2800Google Scholar, 44.Charo I.F. Nannizzi L. Phillips D.R. Hsu M.A. Scarborough R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1415-1421Google Scholar) with minor modifications. αIIbβ3 (250 μg/ml) was diluted 1:50 with a buffer containing 20 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4 (Buffer A), immobilized in 96-well microtiter plates at 500 ng/well, and incubated overnight at 4°C. αvβ3 (400 μg/ml) was diluted 1:80 with Buffer A, and immobilized at 500 ng/well. After the plates were blocked with 20 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 125I-labeled ligands were added in Buffer A containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and selected divalent ions at 1 mM and incubated for 60-180 min at 37°C. Nonspecific binding was measured in the presence of a 100-fold excess of unlabeled ligand. Kd and Bmax values were derived by a curve fitting analyses of specific binding isotherms using the program DeltaGraph for Macintosh (DeltaPoint Inc.). Data were determined as the mean of quadruplicate measurements at each experimental point.Binding of cHarGD to Washed PlateletsPlatelets, isolated as described (12.Plow E.F. McEver R.-P. Coller B.S. Woods V.L. Marguerie G.A. Ginsberg M.H. Blood. 1985; 66: 724-727Google Scholar) and suspended at 1 × 108/ml in the modified Tyrode's buffer, were stimulated with α-thrombin at 0.1 unit/ml, and 3 μMD-phenylalanyl-L-prolyl-arginine chloromethyl ketone was added 10 min after thrombin stimulation. 125I-cHarGD was then added at a final concentration of 50 nM in the presence of appropriate divalent ions. At selected times, platelet-bound ligand was separated by centrifugation through 20% sucrose for 2.5 min at 22°C in Beckman Microfuge, and the cell-bound radioactivity was measured in a γ-counter.Cross-linking StudiesPlatelets were suspended at 5 × 108/ml in Tyrode's buffer, pH 7.2, containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and activated by 0.5 unit/ml α-thrombin. Radiolabeled cHarGD was then added at a concentration of 100 nM and incubated for 15 min at 22°C in the presence of 1 mM each CaCl2, MgCl2, and MnCl2. 125I-KYGRGDS and 125I-K16, at concentrations of 1 μM, were also tested. Bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate (BS3), 3,3′-dithiobis(sulfosuccinimidyl propionate) and dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate) were used as cross-linking reagents. All three cross-linking reagents, purchased from Pierce, were used at concentrations 0.05-0.2 mM. The cross-linking reaction was terminated after 10 min at 22°C by addition of 10 mM Tris, pH 7.0. The platelets were harvested by centrifugation through 20% sucrose and were extracted in phosphate-buffered saline (0.15 M NaCl, 0.01 M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.3), containing 1% Nonidet P-40 and 10 mMN-ethylmaleimide (Sigma). Extracted proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 7.5% polyacrylamide gel and subjected to autoradiography. For cross-linking of cHarGD to purified αIIbβ3, 125I-cHarGD, at a final concentration of 2 μM, was incubated with 1 μg of purified αIIbβ3 in 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, in the presence of 1 mM cation (CaCl2 or MnCl2) for 60 min at 22°C. The cross-linking reaction was terminated after 10 min at 22°C and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Cross-linking of 125I-KYGRGDS to αIIbβ3 was performed by the same method, but the 125I-KYGRGDS concentration was 100 μM, and the incubation time was 3 h. Cross-linked samples were immunoprecipitated as described (42.D'Souza S.E. Ginsberg M.H. Lam S.C.-T. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3943-3951Google Scholar) using mAbs: PMI-1 to the heavy chain of αIIb(45.Shadle P.J. Ginsberg M.H. Plow E.F. Barondes S.H. J.

Invest. 1986; 78: 1103-1111Google Scholar), PMI-2 to β3(45.Shadle P.J. Ginsberg M.H. Plow E.F. Barondes S.H. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 2056-2060Google Scholar), and control TSPI-1 to thrombospondin. Enzymatic fragmentation of cross-linked 125I-cHarGD- or 125I-KYGRGDS-αIIbβ3 complexes was performed in the presence of α-chymotrypsin (Sigma) for 18 h at 37°C using the 1:1 (w/w) enzyme-to-substrate ratio in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.0, containing 5 mM EDTA and 0.1% SDS. Samples were boiled for 5 min to inactivate the enzyme and analyzed by SDS-PAGE.RESULTScHarGD as a Potent Inhibitor of Fibrinogen Binding to αIIbβ3To explore the binding specificity of the β3 integrins, a cyclic peptide, cHarGD, was synthesized as a predicted high affinity ligand for αIIbβ3(25.Scarborough R.M. Naughton M.A. Teng W. Rose J.W. Phillips D.R. Nannizzi L. Arsten A. Campbell A.M. Charo I.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1066-1073Google Scholar). Initially, the effect of cHarGD on 125I-fibrinogen binding to purified and immobilized αIIbβ3 was examined. cHarGD was a potent inhibitor of fibrinogen binding to αIIbβ3 as compared to RGD and γ-chain ligand peptides. As shown in Fig. 1, its IC50 for inhibiting fibrinogen binding to isolated αIIbβ3 was 10 ± 1.7 nM (n = 3). This value is considerably lower than that of the γ-chain peptide, H12, at 10 ± 2.0 μM (n = 3) and RGD-containing peptide, GRGDSP, at 2.0 ± 0.6 μM (n = 3), and is consistent with the observations of Scarborough et al.(25.Scarborough R.M. Naughton M.A. Teng W. Rose J.W. Phillips D.R. Nannizzi L. Arsten A. Campbell A.M. Charo I.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1066-1073Google Scholar).Direct Binding of cHarGD to αIIbβ3To assess direct binding of cHarGD to αIIbβ3, the peptide was radiolabeled to a specific activity of 20-40 μCi/μg. We verified that iodination did not alter its ability to inhibit fibrinogen binding to αIIbβ3: the IC50 values for nonlabeled and mocked labeled cHarGD were 14 and 16 nM, respectively. Interaction of 125I-cHarGD with immobilized αIIbβ3 was then assessed. The time course of 125I-cHarGD (20 nM) binding to immobilized αIIbβ3 was analyzed and found to reach a constant level within 60 min at 37°C (data not shown). This interaction was divalent cation dependent and was inhibited by EDTA. With the cations at 1 mM, at the 60 min time point, higher binding was obtained in the presence of Mn2+ (relative value = 1.3) and the combination of Ca2+, Mg2+, and Mn2+ (relative value = 1.4) than in the presence of Ca2+ (assigned relative value = 1.0). To further characterize 125I-cHarGD binding to αIIbβ3, several competitors were tested. Nonlabeled cHarGD, γ-chain peptide, RGD-containing peptides, fibrinogen, and mAb 7E3 inhibited binding, but RGE-containing peptides and unrelated proteins, such as transferrin and ovalbumin, did not (Fig. 2). These characteristics were the same as reported for fibrinogen binding to αIIbβ3(44.Charo I.F. Nannizzi L. Phillips D.R. Hsu M.A. Scarborough R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1415-1421Google Scholar).Figure 2:Specificity of the interaction of cHarGD with αIIbβ3. 125I-cHarGD (20 nM) was added to microtiter wells coated with αIIbβ3 in the presence or absence of excess unlabeled cHarGD (2 μM), γ-chain peptide HHLGGAKQAGDV (100 μM), GRGDSP (100 μM), GRGESP (100 μM), fibrinogen (5 μM), transferrin (5 μM), and monoclonal antibody 7E3 (20 μg/ml) in the presence of 1 mM Ca2+, Mg2+, and Mn2+, and incubated for 60 min at 37°C. Values represent the means and standard deviation of 3-5 determinations and are expressed as percent of a control lacking inhibitors.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The specific binding of 125I-cHarGD to immobilized αIIbβ3 was saturable (Fig. 3A). Addition of a 100-fold excess unlabeled cHarGD displaced more than 95% of the bound radiolabeled cHarGD. The data from the binding isotherm in Fig. 3A were graphed as a Scatchard plot (Fig. 3B) which suggested that the interaction could be described by a single class of high affinity binding sites with an apparent dissociation constant (Kd) of 9.7 ± 0.9 nM (n = 3). 125I-cHarGD binding to immobilized αIIbβ3 was observed to approach 1 to 1 molar stoichiometry of ligand to receptor. Using a radiolabeled monoclonal anti-αIIb, PMI-1, to quantitate the amount of immobilized receptor, as described by Du et al.(47.Du X. Plow E.F. Frelinger III, A.L. O'Toole T.E. Loftus J.C. Ginsberg M.H. Cell. 1991; 65: 409-416Google Scholar), the ratio of Bmax for radiolabeled cHarGD/PMI-1 was 0.92.Figure 3:Saturation isotherm and Scatchard analysis of 125I-cHarGD binding to αIIbβ3. A, binding isotherms of cHarGD to immobilized αIIbβ3 were constructed by incubating increasing concentrations of 125I-cHarGD with immobilized αIIbβ3. Specific binding was calculated by subtracting nonspecific binding, measured as the residual binding in the presence of a 100-fold excess of nonlabeled cHarGD, from the total binding. The data shown are representative of three separate experiments. B, Scatchard plots of cHarGD binding to αIIbβ3. The apparent dissociation constant (Kd) estimated from the slope of the line was 9.7 ± 0.9 nM (n = 3).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)In a second set of studies, 125I-cHarGD binding to platelets was evaluated. 125I-cHarGD did not bind to non-stimulated platelets in the presence of Ca2+ or EDTA, but the binding was supported in the presence of Mn2+ (Fig. 4). 125I-cHarGD bound to thrombin-stimulated platelets in the presence of Ca2+ as well as Mn2+, and the latter cation supported higher binding. 125I-cHarGD binding to thrombin-stimulated platelets was inhibited by γ-chain peptide, RGD-containing peptides, fibrinogen, and mAb 7E3 (data not shown), using these reagents at the conditions specified in Fig. 2. Analysis of saturable cHarGD binding to thrombin-stimulated platelets by Scatchard plots indicated a single class of binding sites with an estimated Kd of 120 ± 16 nM (n = 3) and a maximum of 28,700 ± 900 molecules bound per platelet (data not shown). Taken together, these observations indicate that cHarGD fulfills the specification of a low molecular weight peptide ligand which binds with high affinity to αIIbβ3, either in purified form or on platelets.Figure 4:Effect of divalent cations on 125I-cHarGD binding to platelets. Washed platelets (1 × 108/ml), non-stimulated or stimulated with α-thrombin (0.1 unit/ml), were incubated with 125I-cHarGD at a final concentration of 50 nM for 15 min at 22°C in the presence of 5 mM EDTA, 1 mM Ca2+, or 1 mM Mn2+ as described under “Materials and Methods.” The values shown are means and standard deviation from three separate experiments performed with triplicate measurements.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Receptor Specificity of cHarGD Is Regulated by Divalent IonsThe specificity of cHarGD for the two β3 integrins was explored using solid-phase assays. In initial experiments, we verified that 125I-fibrinogen did not bind to αvβ3 in the presence of Ca2+ but did bind in the presence of Mn2+ (Fig. 5A)(37.Smith J.W. Piotrowicz R.S. Mathis D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 960-967Google Scholar). Next, cHarGD binding to αIIbβ3 and αvβ3 was compared. While 125I-cHarGD bound selectively to αIIbβ3 in the presence of Ca2+, cHarGD lost its selectivity and bound to both αIIbβ3 and αvβ3 in the presence of Mn2+ (Fig. 5B).Figure 5:Differential effects of divalent cations on the binding of 125I-fibrinogen and 125I-cHarGD to αIIbβ3 and αvβ3. The effects of divalent cations on 125I-fibrinogen (A) and 125I-cHarGD (B) binding to immobilized αIIbβ3 and αvβ3 were examined. Binding was measured in the presence of 1 mM Ca2+ or 1 mM Mn2+, and the binding of each ligand to αIIbβ3 in the presence of 1 mM Ca2+ was assigned a value of 100%. The data shown are means and standard deviation from three experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Further evidence for the cation-dependent regulation of cHarGD with β3 integrins was obtained in competition experiments using fibrinogen as a prototypic αIIbβ3 macromolecular ligand and vitronectin as a prototypic αvβ3 ligand. While cHarGD was an effective inhibitor of fibrinogen binding to αIIbβ3 in the presence of Ca2+, it was a poor inhibitor of vitronectin binding to αvβ3 (Fig. 6A). In the presence of Mn2+, however, cHarGD possessed a similar inhibitory activity against vitronectin binding to αvβ3 and fibrinogen binding to αIIbβ3 (Fig. 6B). These results clearly show that cHarGD interacts with αvβ3 in the presence of Mn2+ although its interaction with αvβ3 is minimal in the presence of Ca2+.Figure 6:Differential effects of cHarGD on fibrinogen binding to αIIbβ3 and vitronectin to αvβ3. The ability of cHarGD to block the interaction of fibrinogen (Fgn) with αIIbβ3 (◼) or vitronectin (Vn) with αvβ3 (•) is compared in the presence of 1 mM Ca2+ (A) or 1 mM Mn2+ (B). Radiolabeled fibrinogen or vitronectin (20 nM) was added in quadruplicate to microtiter wells coated with αIIbβ3 or αvβ3, respectively, and incubated in the presence of various concentrations of cHarGD for 3 h at 37°C. Binding was expressed as a percent of the control without cHarGD. The data shown are representative of three separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)In interacting with αvβ3 in the presence of Mn2+, cHarGD possessed a similar inhibitory activity as a RGD peptide; its IC50 was 40 nM compared to 25 nM for GRGDSP (Fig. 7). We also found that a γ-chain peptide, H12, was inhibitory (IC50 = 40 μM) in the presence of Mn2+ although it was substantially less potent than cHarGD. The relationship between Mn2+ concentration and 125I-cHarGD binding to αvβ3 was examined. Little cHarGD bound to the receptor at Mn2+ concentrations below 1 μM (Fig. 8); maximal binding was supported by concentrations above 100 μM; and 50% maximal binding was obtained at 8 ± 1 μM (n = 3). This latter value is similar to that determined for fibrinogen binding to αvβ3(37.Smith J.W. Piotrowicz R.S. Mathis D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 960-967Google Scholar).Figure 7:Inhibition of fibrinogen binding to αvβ3 by cHarGD, RGD, and γ-chain peptides. Quadruplicate samples of 125I-fibrinogen and various concentrations of cHarGD (◼), GRGDSP (•), and the γ-chain peptide HHLGGAKQAGDV (▴), were incubated with immobilized αvβ3 in the presence of 1 mM Mn2+ for 3 h at 37°C.

However, this enzyme is also expressed in many non-hematopoietic cells. We demonstrate here that in non-hematopoietic 293 cells, overexpression of a catalytically inactive mutant of PTP1C strongly suppressed the stimulatory effects of the epidermal growth factor or serum on cell proliferation, early gene transcription, and DNA synthesis. Similarly, the phosphorylation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase activity was markedly inhibited by overexpression of mutant PTP1C. The inhibitory effect of mutant PTP1C was overcome by cotransfection with wild-type PTP1C, but not with the structurally related PTP2C. Furthermore, expression of the mutant phosphatase resulted in hyperphosphorylation on tyrosine of a 95-kDa protein that was co-immunoprecipitated with the mutant, but not with the wild-type protein. These results suggest that, unlike in hematopoietic cells, PTP1C in 293 cells plays a positive role in epidermal growth factor- or serum-activated mitogenesis. Thus, PTP1C participates in multiple signaling pathways, where the enzyme, depending on its target molecules, may function as either a positive or negative mediator.

INTRODUCTIONUpon binding of external ligands, several cell-surface receptors, such as the insulin receptor, epidermal growth factor (EGF) 1The abbreviations used are: EGFepidermal growth factorPDGFplatelet-derived growth factorMAPmitogen-activated proteinPMAphorbol 12-myristate 13-acetateSREserum response elementLucluciferaseGFPgreen fluorescence protein. receptor, and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor, are activated via dimerization, resulting in autophosphorylation on multiple tyrosine residues within the intracellular domains of the receptors(1.Cantley L.C. Auger K.R. Carpenter C. Duckworth B. Graziani A. Kapeller R. Soltoff S. Cell. 1991; 64: 281-302Google Scholar, 2.Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1990; 61: 203-212Google Scholar). The autophosphorylated domain of the receptor then provides high affinity binding sites for specific cellular SH2 domain-containing proteins(3.Koch C. Anderson D. Moran M. Ellis C. Pawson T. Science. 1991; 252: 668-670Google Scholar). The interaction of these SH2-containing proteins with specific tyrosyl-phosphorylated sites of the receptor causes other signaling molecules to be recruited to the receptor, where these molecules, as well as most of the SH2-containing proteins, can be phosphorylated by the receptors and/or other recruited proteins(3.Koch C. Anderson D. Moran M. Ellis C. Pawson T. Science. 1991; 252: 668-670Google Scholar, 4.Pawson T. Gish G. Cell. 1992; 71: 359-362Google Scholar). Formation of these signal transduction complexes coordinates the multiple intracellular programs that initiate various changes in cell proliferation.Previously, we and others have identified two SH2 domain-containing protein-tyrosine phosphatases, designated PTP1C (5.Shen S.-H. Bastien L. Posner B.I. Chretien P. Nature. 1991; 352: 736-739Google Scholar) (also termed SH-PTP1/HCP/SHP) (6.Plutzky J. Neel B.G. Rosenberg R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Zhao Z. Fischer E.H. Shen S.-H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2197-2201Google Scholar) (also known as SH-PTP2, Syp, and PTP1D)(10.Freeman R.M. Plutzky J. Neel B.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Science. 1993; 259: 1611-1614Google Scholar). PTP2C, a ubiquitously expressed enzyme, is highly homologous to another member of this SH2-containing subfamily, the product of the Drosophila corkscrew (csw) gene (13.Perkins L.A. Larsen I. Perrimon N. Cell. 1992; 70: 225-236Google Scholar). The SH2 domains of PTP2C interact with activated receptor protein-tyrosine kinases, such as the EGF and PDGF receptors(11.Feng G.-S. Hui C.-C. Pawson T. Science. 1993; 259: 1607-1611Google Scholar, 12.Vogel W. Lammers R. Huang J. Ullrich A. Science. 1993; 259: 1611-1614Google Scholar), and with the substrates of these receptor protein-tyrosine kinases, such as insulin receptor substrate-1(14.Kuhne M.R. Pawson T. Lienhard G.E. Feng G.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11479-11481Google Scholar). As a result of these interactions, PTP2C itself becomes tyrosyl-phosphorylated by the receptor protein-tyrosine kinases, and its activity can be modulated by such tyrosyl phosphorylation(12.Vogel W. Lammers R. Huang J. Ullrich A. Science. 1993; 259: 1611-1614Google Scholar, 14.Kuhne M.R. Pawson T. Lienhard G.E. Feng G.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11479-11481Google Scholar, 15.Lechleider R.J.

PTP1C is predominantly expressed in hematopoietic cells(6.Plutzky J. Neel B.G. Rosenberg R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1123-1127Google Scholar, 7.Yi T. Cleveland J.L. Ihle J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 836-846Google Scholar). Like PTP2C, PTP1C can be tyrosyl-phosphorylated in response to various ligands, such as colony-stimulating factor-1, stem cell factor, PDGF, insulin, thrombin, and PMA(22.Yi T. Ihle J.N. Mol. Cell.

In hematopoietic cells, PTP1C was found to associate with c-Kit, the receptor for the Fc region of IgG, and the erythropoietin receptor(22.Yi T. Ihle J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3350-3358Google Scholar, 27.D'Ambrosio D. Hippen K.L. Minskoff S.A. Mellman I. Pani G. Siminovitch K.A. Cambier J.C. Science. 1995; 268: 293-297Google Scholar, 28.Klingmuller U. Lorenz U. Cantley L.C. Neel B.G. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1995; 80: 729-738Google Scholar). The interaction of PTP1C with these receptors through the SH2 domains appears to play a role as a negative regulator in hematopoietic cells(22.Yi T. Ihle J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3350-3358Google Scholar, 27.D'Ambrosio D. Hippen K.L. Minskoff S.A. Mellman I. Pani G. Siminovitch K.A. Cambier J.C. Science. 1995; 268: 293-297Google Scholar, 28.Klingmuller U.

However, recent data revealed that PTP1C is also substantially expressed in a variety of non-hematopoietic cells, especially in some malignant epithelial cells(5.Shen S.-H. Bastien L. Posner B.I. Chretien P. Nature. 1991; 352: 736-739Google Scholar, 6.Plutzky J. Neel B.G. Rosenberg R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1123-1127Google Scholar, 12.Vogel W. Lammers R. Huang J.

Chem. 1993; 268: 11845-11850Google Scholar), suggesting that this enzyme plays some roles in cellular signal transduction in these cells. In this report, we demonstrate that in human embryonic kidney 293 cells, the phosphatase activity of PTP1C, like that of PTP2C, is a positive mediator in serum- and EGF-activated mitogenic signaling.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsHuman recombinant EGF was obtained from Boehringer Mannheim. Human embryonic kidney 293 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection. Polyclonal anti-PTP1C (serum 237) and anti-MAP kinase (serum 1263) antibodies were produced by immunization of rabbits with the antigens as described previously(21.Zhao Z. Tan Z. Wright J.H. Diltz C.D. Shen S.-H. Krebs E.G. Fischer E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11765-11769Google Scholar). Anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. Myelin basic protein and [γ-32P]ATP were purchased from Sigma and Amersham Corp., respectively.Construction of Mutant PTP1C and TransfectionA catalytically inactive mutant, PTP1C C455S, in which Cys-455 was mutated to Ser, was generated by the polymerase chain reaction method (24.Bouchard P. Zhao Z. Banville D. Dumas F. Fisher E.H. Shen S.- H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19585-19589Google Scholar). The constructs with the cytomegalovirus promoter for expressing wild-type PTP1C and mutant PTP1C C455S and the procedures for selection of cell lines stably expressing PTP1C and mutant PTP1C C455S were previously described(24.Bouchard P. Zhao Z. Banville D. Dumas F. Fisher E.H. Shen S.- H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19585-19589Google Scholar). For the stable expression of two constructs in the same cells, the second construct was transfected with an additional selective marker (hygromycin B) into cells that already stably expressed the mutant phosphatase encoded by the first construct, PTP1C C455S. With selection of the transfected clones, the expression levels of the recombinant proteins encoded by different forms of the protein-tyrosine phosphatases were comparable to each other as confirmed by Western blotting. Phosphatase activity was determined as described previously(21.Zhao Z. Tan Z. Wright J.H. Diltz C.D. Shen S.-H. Krebs E.G. Fischer E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11765-11769Google Scholar).Stimulation of Cells and Assay for MAP Kinase Kinase ActivityThe stimulation of cells with EGF and the preparation of cell lysates were carried out as described(21.Zhao Z. Tan Z. Wright J.H. Diltz C.D. Shen S.-H. Krebs E.G. Fischer E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11765-11769Google Scholar). MAP kinase kinase activity was assayed as the ability to stimulate the myelin basic protein kinase activity of recombinant MAP kinase ERK2 in a coupled assay system as described previously(21.Zhao Z. Tan Z. Wright J.H. Diltz C.D. Shen S.-H. Krebs E.G. Fischer E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11765-11769Google Scholar). The recombinant Escherichia coli cells were generously provided by Dr. Melanie Cobb (University of Texas).Immunoprecipitation and Western BlottingStimulated and unstimulated 293 cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 2 mM Na3VO4 and then lysed in 1.0 ml of lysis buffer (supplemented with 1% Triton X-100 and 0.1 M NaCl)/10-cm dish as described above. The extract was clarified by centrifugation at full speed in a microcentrifuge. The clarified extracts were subjected to immunoprecipitation as described(21.Zhao Z. Tan Z. Wright J.H. Diltz C.D. Shen S.-H. Krebs E.G. Fischer E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11765-11769Google Scholar). For Western blotting, the cell extracts were immunoblotted with anti-MAP kinase antibody or anti-PTP1C antibody as described previously(21.Zhao Z. Tan Z. Wright J.H. Diltz C.D. Shen S.-H. Krebs E.G. Fischer E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11765-11769Google Scholar, 24.Bouchard P. Zhao Z. Banville D. Dumas F. Fisher E.H. Shen S.- H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19585-19589Google Scholar).Assay for DNA SynthesisCells (5000/well) were seeded in a 96-well plate and made quiescent by starvation in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium (1:1) for 24 h. The quiescent cells were stimulated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium (1:1) containing [3H]thymidine (1 μCi/well) with various concentrations of EGF and serum as indicated. After 12 h of incubation, the cells were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and fixed with trichloroacetic acid (10%). Cells were then recovered with 0.1 N NaOH, and the incorporated radioactivity was counted.Luciferase Activity AssayThe plasmid of the serum response element-driven luciferase reporter gene (SRE-Luc) was generously provided by Dr. Jeffery Pessin (University of Iowa). A plasmid for expression of green fluorescence protein (GFP) (CLONTECH) was used as a reference plasmid. Control cells and cells expressing PTP1C and PTP1C C455S were plated at 106 cells/90-mm dish and transiently transfected with 10 μg of DNA from the SRE-Luc and GFP plasmids using the calcium phosphate method. 18 h after transfection, cells were split equally into 35-mm dishes for different treatments and serum-starved for 18 h. Then the cells were stimulated with EGF (10 ng/ml), serum (10%), or PMA (5 nM) or left in the medium for 6 h. A whole cell extract was prepared, and luciferase activity from 20 μl of cell lysates was measured by the luciferase assay system (Promega) with a Luminometer (Lumat LB9501, Berthold). Cells in an additional dish were trypsinized and analyzed in a FCAScan cytometer (EPICS profile analyzer) for monitoring the GFP transfection efficiency, which was used to normalize the luciferase activity. All transfections were performed at least twice in triplicate.Assay for the Growth Rate of 293 CellsCells (2 × 104) were seeded in 35-mm dishes and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with EGF or serum at various concentrations; thereafter, the cells were counted at the indicated intervals.RESULTSOverexpression of PTP1C and PTP1C C455S in 293 CellsThe biological consequences of PTP1C overexpression were examined in cultured human embryonic kidney 293 cells, in which endogenous PTP1C was readily detectable by Western blot assay, although its level is relatively low (see the Western blot in Fig. 4, lower panel). A cysteine residue in the HCSA motif of the protein-tyrosine phosphatase domain is highly conserved among various protein-tyrosine phosphatases and is crucial for their catalytic activity. We therefore generated a mutant, PTP1C C455S, in which Cys-455 was mutated to Ser to inactivate the phosphatase activity. Constructs containing PTP1C, mutant PTP1C C455S, and the vector alone were used to transfect 293 cells. After transfection, the cloned cell lines were isolated by selection with G418. In three independent transfection experiments, it was found that the number of neomycin-resistant clones of mutant PTP1C C455S was consistently much lower than that of wild-type PTP1C or the vector alone. Furthermore, clones containing mutant PTP1C C455S grew much slower than those containing wild-type PTP1C or the vector alone (see below). These results suggest that expression of catalytically inactive PTP1C may have a negative effect on cell growth. Western blots confirmed the high expression levels of both exogenous PTP1C and PTP1C C455S. The phosphatase activity in immunoprecipitates from most PTP1C clones increased >6-fold when compared with controls (data not shown). In contrast, phosphatase activity precipitated from mutant PTP1C C455S was virtually the same as that from the control cells, confirming that the Cys-to-Ser mutation effectively abolished PTP1C-specific phosphatase activity. When mutant PTP1C C455S was cotransfected with wild-type PTP1C or PTP2C, the phosphatase activity in immunoprecipitates resumed to a level corresponding to those transfected with the wild type alone. Of various cell clones, two wild-type PTP1C (WT3 and WT5) and two mutant PTP1C C455S (C/S4 and C/S7) as well as two PTP1C C455S/PTP1C and PTP1C C455S/PTP2C clones, each obtained from independent transfections, were chosen for further characterization. These clones typically express a high but comparable level of PTP1C or PTP1C C455S or both the mutant and wild-type phosphatases based on immunoblotting and phosphatase activity. All experimental data described below were generated using at least two different clones.Phosphorylation of PTP1C following EGF Stimulation293 cells express a substantial amount of EGF receptor, which makes this cell line suitable for study of the EGF-activated signal cascade. Tyrosine phosphorylation of both PTP1C and the inactive mutant PTP1C C455S was readily observed following EGF stimulation. As shown in Fig. 1, PTP1C underwent rapid tyrosine phosphorylation upon stimulation with EGF. Phosphorylation reached a maximum after 3 min following EGF stimulation and declined after 10 min. The extent of tyrosine phosphorylation in mutant PTP1C C455S was usually higher than that observed in wild-type PTP1C in response to EGF (data not shown), due to the auto-dephosphorylation of the wild-type enzyme(24.Bouchard P. Zhao Z. Banville D. Dumas F. Fisher E.H. Shen S.- H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19585-19589Google Scholar). The phosphatase activity of tyrosine-phosphorylated PTP1C induced by EGF stimulation was not significantly changed relative to unphosphorylated enzyme when assayed in immunoprecipitates prepared with and without EGF treatment (data not shown).Figure 1:Tyrosine phosphorylation of PTP1C in 293 cells. Serum-starved semiconfluent 293 cells grown in 90-mm dishes were stimulated with EGF at 10 ng/ml for 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, and 20 min at 37°C and lysed in 1 ml of cell lysis buffer. Cell lysates containing equal amounts of total protein were immunoprecipitated by anti-PTP1C antibody and detected by Western blot analysis with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Anti-Ptyr) or anti-PTP1C antibody 237 as indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Overexpression of Mutant PTP1C C455S Reduces Cell Growth RateDuring the course of isolating PTP1C and PTP1C C455S clones from 293 cells, we observed that clones expressing the catalytically inactive mutant PTP1C C455S grew much slower than those expressing PTP1C or control cells. To ascertain whether the inactive mutant PTP1C truly had a negative effect on cell growth, we examined the growth rate of control cells as well as cells expressing PTP1C and PTP1C C455S. As shown in Fig. 2, the growth rate of 293 cells responded to either serum or EGF in a dose-dependent manner. At a low serum concentration (1%) or at a low concentration of EGF (1 ng/ml), 293 cells expressing wild-type PTP1C grew approximately twice as fast as the control cells transfected with the vector alone. As the concentrations of the mitogens were increased, the differences between the growth rate diminished. Conversely, 293 cells expressing mutant PTP1C C455S displayed a much slower growth rate when compared with cells expressing wild-type PTP1C or even with control cells. The inhibition of cell growth exerted by expression of PTP1C C455S was observed at both low and high mitogen concentrations. These data indicate that overexpression of the catalytically inactive mutant PTP1C C455S suppresses the growth rate of 293 cells.Figure 2:Effects of PTP1C and PTP1C C455S on the growth rate of 293 cells stimulated by serum and EGF. The concentrations of serum and EGF for stimulation are indicated. The results shown are representative of three separate experiments. PTP1C(C-S), PTP1C C455S.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Effect of Overexpressed PTP1C and PTP1C C455S on DNA SynthesisSince the expression of mutant PTP1C C455S inhibited cell growth, we speculated that expression of PTP1C C455S would antagonize the mitogenic potential of EGF and serum factors, thus leading to inhibition of DNA synthesis. Serum- or EGF-stimulated DNA synthesis was monitored by incorporation of [3H]thymidine. DNA synthesis in 293 cells was highly dependent upon growth factor addition. We examined the dose responses of both serum and EGF on stimulation of DNA synthesis in 293 cells expressing the vector, PTP1C, and PTP1C C455S. Fig. 3 shows that the control and PTP1C-transfected cells displayed similar levels of [3H]thymidine incorporation at a high concentration of EGF (10 μg/ml) or serum (10%). However, at low concentrations of EGF (1.0 ng/ml) and serum (1%), only the PTP1C-transfected cells showed an appreciable increase in DNA synthesis in response to the mitogens. This response correlates to what was observed for cell growth (see Fig. 2). In contrast, G0-arrested cells transfected with PTP1C C455S responded very poorly to either EGF or serum. Even at a high concentration of EGF (10 ng/ml) or serum (10%), the DNA synthesis rate of these cells hardly reached 30% of that observed in control cells during a 12-h period. These experiments demonstrate that the inactive mutant PTP1C C455S exerts a strong inhibitory effect on EGF-stimulated DNA synthesis.Figure 3:Inhibition of DNA synthesis in 293 cells by mutant PTP1C C455S. 293 cells stably expressing PTP1C or PTP1C C455S (PTP1C(C-S)) were seeded in 96-well plates (5000 cells/well) and serum-starved for 18 h. DNA synthesis in response to various concentrations of EGF and serum was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data are presented as means ± S.E. from three independent experiments, each performed in triplicate. FBS, fetal bovine serum.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Effects of Overexpressed PTP1C and PTP1C C455S on Phosphorylation of MAP Kinase and on MAP Kinase Kinase ActivityThe MAP kinase pathway plays a central role in the regulation of cell proliferation. To study where the inactive mutant PTP1C C455S was exerting its inhibitory effect in the mitogen-activated signaling pathway, leading from EGF receptor to SRE stimulation, we further examined the effect of mutant PTP1C C455S on MAP kinase phosphorylation and on MAP kinase kinase activity. It is known that upon stimulation with mitogens, MAP kinase is activated by phosphorylation on both tyrosine and threonine residues, resulting in mobility shifts of MAP kinase (ERK1 and ERK2) on SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Cells expressing wild-type PTP1C and mutant PTP1C were treated with EGF. As shown in Fig. 4, in control cells, following a 5-min stimulation with EGF, a substantial proportion of both ERK1 and ERK2 displayed the typical mobility shift on the gel due to the phosphorylation of the enzymes. In cells transfected with wild-type PTP1C, the EGF-stimulated phosphorylation of both ERK1 and ERK2 was significantly increased under the same conditions. Conversely, expression of mutant PTP1C C455S dramatically reduced the mobility shifts of both ERK1 and ERK2 on the gel in response to EGF (Fig. 4).The effects of different forms of PTP1C on the MAP kinase cascade were further examined by directly measuring MAP kinase kinase activity. The activity assay was performed 5 min after EGF stimulation. The time courses showed that the peak activity for all transfected cells occurred at approximately this point (data not shown). Expression of wild-type PTP1C slightly increased the MAP kinase kinase activity (∼15%) when compared with control cells. In contrast, overexpression of the catalytically inactive mutant PTP1C C455S decreased MAP kinase kinase activity by ∼30% (Fig. 5).Figure 5:Inhibition of MAP kinase kinase activity by expression of mutant PTP1C C455S. Whole cell lysates from EGF-treated cultures (5 min) were prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The samples were then assayed for MAP kinase kinase (MAPKK) activity by incubating 2 μg of protein sample with ERK2 and unlabeled ATP for 10 min, followed by the addition of myelin basic protein and 32P-labeled ATP and further incubation for 10 min. Results are expressed as relative activity of MAP kinase kinase, in which the activity obtained from the vector-transfected cells was calculated as 1.0. PTP1C(C-S), PTP1C C455S.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Effect of Overexpressed PTP1C and PTP1C C455S on c-fos Promoter-dependent Luciferase ActivityTo further determine the role of PTP1C in growth factor-stimulated mitogenic signal transduction, we assayed the effect of PTP1C on c-fos promoter-dependent luciferase activity. The luciferase gene driven by the human c-fos promoter represents a highly sensitive reporter of growth factor-induced transcriptional activity (31.Angel P. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 129-157Google Scholar). This early gene promoter contains the well characterized SRE, whose activity is induced upon activation of the serum-responsive factor(32.Treisman R. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1990; 1: 47-58Google Scholar). In control cells, SRE-regulated gene expression was dramatically stimulated by either serum or EGF. The stimulatory effect of EGF was approximately three times greater than that of serum (Fig. 6). The stimulatory response to EGF was increased by ∼30% with the expression of wild-type PTP1C. In contrast, expression of the catalytically inactive mutant PTP1C C455S strongly suppressed the stimulatory effect of both EGF and serum. As shown in Fig. 6, expression of mutant PTP1C C455S inhibited luciferase activity by ∼50% in response to serum and by nearly 50% in response to EGF when compared with the control (Fig. 6). However, the inactive mutant PTP1C C455S did not affect the stimulatory effect of PMA on the SRE-Luc activity (Fig. 6, lower panel), suggesting that the inhibitory effect of mutant PTP1C C455S on SRE-Luc reporter gene activity is mitogen-specific. Thus, all experiments, as assayed by growth rate, SRE-Luc activity, MAP kinase, and MAP kinase kinase activity, clearly demonstrated that overexpression of the catalytically inactive mutant PTP1C C455S in 293 cells strongly suppressed the mitogenic responses.Figure 6:Effect of mutant PTP1C C455S on SRE-Luc activity. Semiconfluent 293 cells expressing PTP1C or PTP1C C455S (PTP1C(C-S)) were transiently cotransfected with the SRE-Luc and GFP reporter plasmids. The cells were then serum-starved and either left untreated or treated with 10% serum (upper panel), 10 ng/ml EGF (middle panel), or 5 nM PMA (TPA; lower panel) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The SRE-Luc (SRE-Luc) activity was normalized for the efficiency of transfection based on the expression of GFP as well as on the total protein concentration of different cell lysates. The SRE-Luc activity is presented as the intensity of fluorescent lights. Data are presented as means ± S.E. from three independent experiments, each performed in triplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Coexpression of Wild-type PTP1C Overcomes the Inhibitory Effect of PTP1C C455S on c-fos Promoter-dependent Luciferase ActivityTo confirm whether the inhibitory effect of PTP1C C455S on SRE-Luc activity was due to a specific inhibition of the endogenous PTP1C activity, rather than to an effect of the related phosphatase PTP2C, cells stably expressing PTP1C C455S were cotransfected with either wild-type PTP1C or PTP2C. As shown in Fig. 7, coexpression of wild-type PTP1C with PTP1C C455S greatly elevated the SRE-Luc activity to a level nearly comparable to that observed in cells overexpressing PTP1C alone (see the SRE-Luc activity with EGF stimulation in Fig. 6), totally abolishing the inhibitory effect of the mutant. However, coexpression of PTP2C with PTP1C C455S only partially reversed the inhibitory effect of PTP1C C455S."

The mechanism of this regulation is complex and is likely to involve a number of genetic elements that effect temporal and spatial expression. To date none of the elements that have been identified in the CFTR promoter regulate tissue-specific expression. We have identified a putative regulatory element within the first intron of the CFTR gene at 181+10kb. The region containing this element was first identified as a DNase I hypersensitive site that was present in cells that express the CFTR gene but absent from cells not transcribing CFTR. In vitro analysis of binding of proteins to this region of DNA sequence by gel mobility shift assays and DNase I footprinting revealed that some proteins that are only present in CFTR-expressing cells bound to specific elements, and other proteins that bound to adjacent elements were present in all epithelial cells irrespective of their CFTR expression status. When assayed in transient expression systems in a cell line expressing CFTR endogenously, this DNA sequence augmented reporter gene expression through activation of the CFTR promoter but had no effect in nonexpressing cells.

Linder C.C. Grieger D. Thompson E.W. Meunier H. Griswold M.D. Buchwald M. Nat. Genet. 1993; 3: 157-164Google Scholar). Very little is known about the genetic elements and transcription factors that regulate CFTR expression. The basal promoter of the CFTR gene has been analyzed in some detail (Chou et al., 1991; Yoshimura et al., 33.Yoshimura K. Nakamura H. Trapnell B.C. Chu C.S. Dalemans W. Pavirani A. Lecocq J.-P.

The minimal promoter sequence found between −226 and +98 bp with respect to the transcription start site defined by Chou et al.(1991) is sufficient to drive low levels of expression of a reporter gene (Chou et al., 1991; Koh et al., 1993). However, Chou et al.(1991) also identified an element immediately upstream of −277 that repressed reporter gene transcription in several cell lines. cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator base pair(s) kilobase(s) polymerase chain reaction. Analysis of the DNA sequence of the basal CFTR promoter reveals a number of elements that may be involved in regulation of transcription. There are several potential binding sites for the AP-1 transcription factor (GGAGTCAG) and three putative binding sites for the transcription factor Sp1 (GGGCGG). There is evidence for in vitro regulation of CFTR gene expression by phorbol esters (Trapnell et al., 29.Trapnell B.C. Zeitlin P.L. Chu C.S. Yoshimura K. Nakamura H. Guggino W.B. Bargon J. Banks T.C. Dalemans W. Pavirani A. Lecocq J.-P. Crystal R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10319-10323Google Scholar). A cAMP-response element (TGACATCA) has been defined within the CFTR promoter at −48 to −41 with respect to the transcription start site defined by Yoshimura et al. (1991a) (McDonald et al., 21.McDonald R.A. Matthews R.P. Idzerda R.L. McKnight G.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7560-7564Google Scholar). Two purine/pyrimidine repeat elements have been identified in the 5′-flanking region of the CFTR gene, one of which has been shown to be S1 nuclease-sensitive in supercoiled plasmids, suggesting a non-B DNA structure (Hollingsworth et al., 13.Hollingsworth M.A. Closken C. Harris A. McDonald C.D. Pahwa G.S. Maher III, L.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1138-1146Google Scholar; McDonald et al., 20.McDonald C.D. Hollingsworth M.A. Maher L.J. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 150: 267-274Google Scholar). There is little data on the control of cell specificity of CFTR expression, although there is ample evidence for such regulation. The human CFTR gene is expressed at significant levels mainly in the epithelia lining the pancreas, intestine, bile ducts, male genital ducts, and certain regions of the airway epithelium including the inferior turbinate of the nose, the trachea, and the serous portion of submucosal glands (Crawford et al., 1991; Denning et al., 19.Ma Y.-G. Rosfjord E. Huebert C. Wilder P. Tiesman J. Kelly D. Rizzino A. Dev. Biol. 1992; 154: 45-54Google Scholar; Engelhardt et al., 1993). There is evidence that expression of the CFTR gene may be hormonally regulated in epithelia within the reproductive system (Trezise et al., 1992; Rochwerger et al., 24.Rochwerger L. Dho S. Parker L. Foskett J.K. Buchwald M. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2439-2448Google Scholar). Some degree of cell type-specific control has been inferred for uncharacterized elements within the immediate 5′-untranslated region. A number of DNase I hypersensitive sites that show some degree of correlation with CFTR expression have been observed between −3,000 bp relative to the transcription start site and +100 bp into intron 1 (Yoshimura et al., 1991b; Koh et al., 1993). However, these sites have only been examined in a few long term cell lines that either do or do not express CFTR mRNA and protein and hence may not adequately reflect cell-specific regulation of expression of the CFTR gene in vivo. Transgenic mouse experiments in which 19 kb of genomic DNA 5′ to the CFTR gene were placed 5′ of a reporter gene failed to achieve expression (Griesenbach et al., 8.Griesenbach U. Tsuen T.-C. Chamberlain J. Olek K. Tsui L.-C. Paed. Pulmonol. Suppl. 1994; 10: 199Google Scholar). Because the expression control elements of the CFTR gene had not been well defined, we screened a larger region of genomic DNA than had been analyzed previously in an attempt to identify these elements. The chromatin structure of 120 kb of genomic DNA 5′ to the CFTR gene was analyzed in a number of CFTR expressing and nonexpressing cell types, including primary genital duct epithelial cells in addition to long term cell lines. We identified DNase I hypersensitive sites within this region by screening with probes isolated from cosmid and phage clones (Rommens et al., 1989). Novel DNase I hypersensitive sites were observed at −79.5 and −20.5 kb 5′ to the ATG translation start codon of the CFTR coding sequence (Smith et al., 27.Smith A.N. Wardle C.J.C. Harris A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 211: 274-281Google Scholar). Neither of these sites showed strong correlation with CFTR expression in the cell types investigated. Although they may play an important role in the complex series of events involved in the regulation of CFTR transcription, these data do not support the existence of cell-specific control elements at these sites. Another DNase I hypersensitive site was observed within intron 1 of the CFTR gene. Detection of this site correlated well, quantitatively and qualitatively, with the levels of expression of the CFTR gene in both long term cell lines and primary genital duct epithelial cells. Nuclear extracts from cells that transcribe the CFTR gene contain specific proteins that bind to DNA in the region of this hypersensitive site. Further, analysis of the putative regulatory element through transient assays of reporter gene constructs showed a positive effect on the activity of the CFTR promoter in cells that express the CFTR gene endogenously. The following cell lines were analyzed: primary human mid-trimester fetal vas deferens and epididymis epithelial cells (Harris and Coleman, 9.Harris A. Coleman L. J. Cell Sci. 1989; 92: 687-690Google Scholar) and SV40 Ori- transformed vas deferens (RVP) and epididymis (REP) cell lines (Coleman and Harris, 1991); Caco2 (Fogh et al., 6.Fogh J. Wright W.C. Loveless J.D. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1977; 58: 209-214Google Scholar), HT29 (Huet et al., 14.Huet C. Sahuquillo-Merino C. Coudrier E. Louvard D. J.

All cell types studied were tested for CFTR mRNA expression by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) at the time of isolation of nuclei for chromatin analysis (Smith et al., 1995). The cW44 cosmid was kindly provided by Drs. Johanna Rommens and Lap-Chee Tsui (Rommens et al., 1989). The XB5.0 (5 kb XhoI/BamHI), H4.0 (4 kb HindIII), and EB1.7 (1.7 kb EcoRI/BamHI) subfragments of this cosmid are shown in Fig. 1. Chromatin from a panel of cell types was probed for DNase I hypersensitive regions by standard methods (Higgs et al., 11.Higgs D.R. Wood W.G. Jarman A.P. Sharpe J. Lida J. Pretorius I.-M. Ayyub H. Genes & Dev. 1990; 4: 1588-1601Google Scholar). The location of oligonucleotides used for PCR amplification of fragments of intron 1 TSR3/4, TSR5/6, and TSR7/8 are shown in Fig. 1B. IA1R, CGGGATCCAAGCAAGTACGCATGATA; TSR3, CCTTAATTAAGGATCCGAGAATGTGTGATTTTCTTG; TSR4, TCCCCGCGGATCCAAGGGAAGATCAGGAACAAC; TSR5, CCTTAATTAAGGATCCATAGTGTGAAAACCACTGAC; TSR6, TCCCCGCGGATCCTCCAAAGTACATGCTTCTTC; TSR7, CCTTAATTAAGGATCCTCATCTTTATCTTCATTGTC; and TSR8, TCCCCGCGGATCCTAACTCATTGTACTGACGAG. Primers for PCR amplification of intron 1 subfragments were designed to have BamHI and either PacI (forward primers) or SacII (reverse primers) restriction sites at their 5′ end. Fragments 3/4, 5/6, and 7/8 and the BS0.7 (750 bp) fragment amplified by primers IAIR and TSR8 spanning the site in intron 1 were cloned into pCRII (In Vitrogen). All subcloned fragments were sequenced to exclude PCR artifacts. DNA fragments were labeled by fill-in reactions with Klenow DNA polymerase and [α-32P]dATP, dCTP, and/or dTTP. Oligonucleotides were end labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]dATP. Preparation of nuclear extracts and gel mobility shift assays were carried out as described previously (Hollingsworth et al., 1994). DNase I footprinting reactions used standard methods (Philipsen et al., 22.Philipsen S. Talbot D. Fraser P. Grosveld F. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2159-2167Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide sequences for competition experiments are ASTM1F/R to ASTM6F/R: ASTM1F, GTACTTTGGAATCAG ASTM1R CTGATTCCAAAGTAC; ASTM2F, GTCACTTATTAACAATGTGA; ASTM2R, TCACATTGTTAATAAGTGAC; ASTM3F, TCTTAGGCAATTTACTTA; ASTM3R, TAAGTAAATTGCCTAAGA; ASTM4F, ACAATGTGATCTTAGGCAATTTACTT; ASTM4R, AAGTAAATTGCCTAAGATCACATTGT; ASTM5F, AATCCTAACTCTGTCACTTATTAACAATGTGATC; ASTM5R, GATCACATTGTTAATAAGTGACAGAGTTAGGATT; ASTM6F,GTACTTTGGAATCAGACAGACCTGGCTGG; and ASTM6R, CCAGCCAGGTCTGTCTGATTCCAAAGTAC. Transient expression constructs were generated using the pGL2B Basic vector (Promega). A 787-bp fragment (named 245) spanning the CFTR basal promoter (from −820 to −33 with respect to the ATG translational start codon) was amplified using the primers Bii-5BNheI (CTAGCTAGCGGAGTTCACTCACCTAAACCTCAAA) and α98LBglII (AGATCTTCTGGGCTCAAGCTCCTAATG) and cloned into NheI and BglII sites of the promoter multiple cloning site of pGL2B in the correct orientation for driving transcription of the luciferase gene. The 5/6, 7/8, and full-length BS0.7 fragments of the intron 1 region (see Fig. 1B) were cloned into the BamHI restriction site in the “enhancer” segment of the vector. The orientation of each fragment with respect to the 245 promoter fragment was verified, and further experiments carried out on those orientated 5′→ 3′ with respect to the vector backbone. In all transfection experiments the pGL2B 245 constructs were co-transfected with the amount of DNA of pdolCMVcat (Ma et al., 1992) as a transfection control. Luciferase and CAT assays were carried out by standard procedures. Each transfection experiment was carried out 6 times (5 for MCF7) with individual constructs being assayed in quintuplicate in each experiment. The results are expressed as relative luciferase activity, with the pGL2B 245 CFTR promoter construct equal to 1, corrected for transfection efficiency as measured by CAT activity. Statistical analyses of results were performed using Minitab Statistical Software, Release 7 (1989, Minitab Inc. 3081 Enterprise Drive, State College, PA 16802). Expression of CFTR was measured by reverse transcription-PCR in all the cell cultures used in this study at the time nuclei were isolated for hypersensitivity assays (Smith et al., 1995). This assay does not provide a highly accurate quantitative estimation of levels of CFTR mRNA expression; however, it provides a useful qualitative method of verifying production of CFTR mRNA by the cells under investigation when performed with an internal control for a house-keeping gene such as glucocerebrosidase. These data are summarized in Table 1.Tabled 1 A diagram showing the relative positions of the XB5.0 (5 kb XhoI/BamHI, where the BamHI site is located at the cosmid end), H4.0 (4 kb HindIII), and EB1.7 (1.7 kb EcoRI/BamHI) subfragments of the cW44 cosmid that were used as probes are shown in Fig. 1A. The efficacy of DNase I treatment of every preparation of DNase I-treated nuclei was evaluated with the RA2.2 probe that is known to detect a constitutive DNase I hypersensitive site within the α-globin gene cluster in all cell types (Vyas et al., 1992). All three probes hybridized to a 22-kb BamHI fragment in genomic DNA from the cell lines analyzed, as would be predicted from the CFTR genomic DNA map (Rommens et al.(1989) and Fig. 1A). As is shown in Fig. 2 for the H4.0 probe, increasing amounts of DNase I revealed a hypersensitive site within this 22-kb fragment, yielding a major product of 8 kb. In addition less prominent fragments of about 12 and 10 kb were also seen in some cell types, particularly Caco2, HT29, and primary epididymis, suggesting the presence of additional hypersensitive sites in this region. The major hypersensitive site was located 8 kb from the 5′ end of the 22-kb BamHI fragment and hence approximately 10 kb 3′ from the end of exon 1 of the CFTR gene. Based on CF Genetic Analysis Consortium nomenclature, this site will be called 181+10kb, where 181 refers to the last base in exon 1. Hybridization with other probes from this region confirmed the localization. This hypersensitive site has the potential to contain cell type expression control elements because it is seen only in cell lines that transcribe CFTR mRNA. The relative degree of hypersensitivity of the site correlated with the relative levels of endogenous expression of CFTR (Table 1). The high expressing colon carcinoma cell lines Caco2 and HT29 show the site most strongly; the pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell line Capan that expresses low levels of CFTR mRNA shows the hypersensitive site weakly, the breast carcinoma epithelial cell line MCF7, and the lymphoblastoid cell line 37566 do not show this site. Most importantly, cultured human fetal epididymis and vas deferens epithelial cells that express CFTR in vitro show the hypersensitive site, whereas it is barely detectable in the transformed genital duct-derived cell lines REP and RVP, which have greatly down-regulated CFTR expression following transformation. This site is not evident in the 16HBE14o- bronchial epithelial cell line that expresses high levels of CFTR following SV40 Ori- transformation (not shown). The XB5.0 fragment of the cW44 cosmid (from the more distal XhoI site 3′ to the end of exon 1 to the BamHI site at the end of the cosmid, see Fig. 1) spanned the hypersensitive site. This fragment was subcloned into the BamHI and SalI/XhoI sites of pUC119. Because the DNase I hypersensitive site was known to be in close proximity to the HindIII and EcoRI sites at 1.7 and 1.9 kb from the 3′ end of the XB5.0 fragment (see Fig. 1A), these sites were utilized for subcloning the EcoRI and HindIII fragments. The inserts were sequenced. A partial restriction map of 850 bp flanking this region is shown in Fig. 1B. Overlapping fragments of approximately 250 bp (3/4, 5/6, and 7/8) were generated from within the 850-bp fragment of intron 1 by PCR. No specific gel mobility shifts were observed with fragments 3/4 or 5/6. However, several proteins bound to fragment 7/8 as illustrated in Fig. 3. Two gel mobility shift bands were generated by nuclear extracts from all cell lines tested, irrespective of whether they transcribe CFTR (bands c1 and c2). At least one other protein complex was seen in long term cell lines transcribing CFTR, Caco2, HT29 (Fig. 3, band a1), Capan1, REP, and RVP. These protein-DNA complexes were specifically competed by excess cold fragment 7/8 but not by the 5/6 fragment (Fig. 3). Primary epididymis and primary vas deferens nuclear extracts also caused gel mobility shifts of fragment 7/8 and the formation of a complex of at least three components (a2, b1, and b2, Fig. 4A). The lymphoblastoid cell line 37566 showed a gel mobility shift to form a complex lying between a2 and b1 (Fig. 4A).Figure 4:Gel mobility shift profiles of the 205-bp 7/8 fragment with nuclear extracts from CFTR+ and CFTR- cell lines and competition with the subfragments of the 7/8 DNA fragment as shown.

C, restriction map of the 7/8 fragment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Further mapping of the location of the DNA-protein complexes detected by gel mobility shift analysis was achieved by competition with subfragments of the 7/8 element (see Fig. 4C). In each case the labeled probe was the entire 7/8 fragment, and all complexes were abolished by the presence of excess unlabeled 7/8 fragment (Fig. 4A). The 38-bp AluI fragment did not compete with any of the protein-DNA complexes (not shown). All protein-DNA complexes were eliminated by an excess of 112-bp ScrfI (Fig. 4B) and 74-bp AluI/ScrfI fragments (not shown), suggesting that all proteins causing gel shifts were binding between the ScrfI and AluI sites. In some competition experiments (not shown) the 93-bp ScrfI fragment showed weak competition with the a1, a2, b1, and b2 complexes, suggesting the relevant protein complex might also involve sites close to the 3′ end of this fragment The addition of excess unlabeled 130-bp Sau3a fragment blocked the formation of complexes seen at bands a1, a2, b1, and b2 (Fig. 4A). Adding an excess of the 75-bp Sau3a fragment eliminated the complexes seen at bands c1 and c2 (Fig. 4B). Hence, the complexes a1, a2, b1, and b2 detected in CFTR-expressing cells probably include proteins that bind to DNA sequences lying 5′ to the Sau3a site (Fig. 4C), and the complexes seen in all cell lines, c1 and c2, involve DNA-protein interactions primarily 3′ to the Sau3a site. Fig. 5 shows DNase I footprinting of the 7/8 fragment following binding of nuclear extracts from the MCF7 and HPAF cells lines that do not transcribe CFTR, the Caco2 carcinoma cell line, and two independent primary epididymis cell cultures that transcribe the CFTR gene. A footprint between bases 726 and 746 (ATGTGATCTTAGGCAATTTAC) (see Fig. 1C) was seen in all cell lines. The precise appearance of this footprint was slightly different when nuclear extracts from primary cells were used, as illustrated by the appearance of a hypersensitive site close to the Sau3a site at 730. Nuclear extracts from the primary epithelial cells gave two additional footprints at bases 712-726 (GTCACTTATTAACAAT) and 671-683 (GTACTTTGGAATC), separated by another hypersensitive site close to the ScrfI site. The footprint at bases 712-727 is weakly evident with Caco2 nuclear extracts and on occasion is seen with MCF7 nuclear extracts. The DNase I footprint data suggest a complex pattern of DNA-protein interactions within this region of the 7/8 fragment. The results obtained with nuclear extracts from the primary cells suggest that the complex of protein(s) may be altering chromatin structure as revealed by the presence of DNase I hypersensitive sites. It is probable, given the complexity of the DNase I footprint and gel mobility shift data, that a number of proteins are interacting with this region of genomic DNA. Several oligonucleotides were chosen on the basis of the DNase I footprints (shown in Fig. 5) to further elucidate the precise location of the DNA-protein interactions described in the previous paragraph. Gel mobility shift assays were performed in which oligonucleotides ASTM1F/R, ASTM2F/R, ASTM3F/R, ASTM4F/R, ASTM5F/R, and ASTM6F/R (Fig. 1C) were used to compete for the gel mobility shifts produced when labeled fragment 7/8 was incubated with nuclear extracts from Caco2, primary epididymis, and MCF7. Competition with a 100-fold molar excess of oligonucleotides ASTM2F/R resulted in a reduction in the amounts of band a1 on gel mobility shift reactions in Caco2 (Fig. 6A). This suggested that the 20 base pairs of ASTM2F/R encompassed at least one site of DNA-protein interaction for the a1 complex. However, when oligonucleotide ASTM2F/R was labeled and used in gel mobility shift assays (not shown), it was inefficient (in comparison with the whole 7/8 fragment) at generating a DNA-protein complex with nuclear extracts from Caco2 cells, suggesting that nucleotides lying outside this 20-bp sequence (presumably 5′ to it, on the basis of the 7/8 restriction fragment competition experiments above) may be important for the formation of complex a1. Further evidence for this was provided by gel mobility shift experiments with the ASTM5F/R oligonucleotide, which generated the a1 complex more efficiently than ASTM2F/R (not shown). ASTM2F/R was also seen to inhibit formation of the a2/b1/b2 complexes seen with primary epididymis cell nuclear extracts (Fig. 6C). Here again, the competition was incomplete, suggesting that other elements outside this sequence (presumably 5′ to it) were important in the generation of these complexes. The ASTM5F/R oligonucleotide was also effective in competition of the a1/a2/b1/b2 complexes (competition of a1 is shown in Fig. 6B) with little effect on the noncell-specific c1 and c2 complexes. Competition with oligonucleotides ASTM4F/R showed no inhibition of the a1 complex (Fig. 6B), hence it is likely that the a1/a2/b1/b2 complexes are interacting with DNA 5′ to the end of oligo 4. This was confirmed by gel mobility shift experiments (not shown) using the MseI fragment lying between 720 and 748 (see Fig. 6D) as a probe, which only generated the c1 and c2 complexes. Competition with oligonucleotides ASTM4F/R showed inhibition (though incomplete) of formation of the c1 and c2 complexes seen in all cell types analyzed (Fig. 6B). Further, the ASTM4F/R oligonucleotide alone was effective at forming the c1 and c2 complexes when used as a probe in gel mobility shift assays (not shown). However, oligonucleotide ASTM3F/R, which overlaps the 3′ 19 bp of ASTM4F/R, was only able to cause slight inhibition of the c1 and c2 complex in Caco2 at 500-fold excess (Fig. 6A), suggesting that the important DNA-protein interactions required for generating the c1 and c2 complexes are close to the Sau3a site. Neither oligonucleotides ASTM1F/R nor ASTM6F/R showed competition with any of the DNA-protein complexes detected in the primary epididymis cell nuclear extracts or those from any of the other cell lines (not shown). Hence the precise nature of the DNase I footprint observed in the region of ASTM1F/R (GTACTTTGGAATC) with the epididymis cell nuclear extracts (Fig. 5) remains obscure. In summary (Fig. 6D) the DNA-protein interactions that generate the gel mobility shifts c1 and c2 seen with nuclear extracts from all the cell types that we have analyzed occur between the MseI site at 720 and the MseI site at 748 with the key sites in the complex lying closer to the 5′ half of this fragment. The DNA-protein interactions that generate the gel mobility shifts a1, seen in Caco2 and HT29 and a2, b1, and b2 seen in primary epididymis nuclear extracts (none of these complexes being seen in the cell lines Panc-1, HPAF, and MCF7 that do not transcribe CFTR) are 5′ to the MseI site at 720 but 3′ to the end of oligonucleotide ASTM6F/R at 699. The efficiency of the ASTM5F/R oligonucleotide in generating the a1 complex in Caco2 nuclear extracts confirms this localization. The ability of the ASTM2F/R oligonucleotide to form the a1 complex, even if inefficiently, suggests that the base pairs involved in this interaction do not extend greatly to the 5′ end of this oligonucleotide at 711. Constructs containing the 787-bp CFTR basal promoter fragment (designated 245) driving luciferase expression with the 5/6, 7/8, or BS0.7 (IA1R-TSR8) fragments cloned into the enhancer site of the PGL2B vector (3′ to the CFTR promoter) were co-transfected with pdolCMVcat (Ma et al., 1992) into the cells lines Caco2, 16HBE14o-, and MCF7, and both CAT and luciferase activities were assayed. The results of the transfection experiments are shown in Fig. 7. Each experiment included transfections that were carried out in quintuplicate in 60-mm culture dishes. Luciferase values were corrected for transfection efficiency based on CAT activities for each transfected dish. In each experiment, controls were transfections with the pGL2B vector alone. Luciferase activities were expressed as a fraction of that obtained with the pGL2B+245 CFTR promoter element construct. The results of the luciferase assays showed that none of the cloned fragments from intron 1 had an effect on the CFTR promoter when transfected into MCF 7 cells. Similar results were obtained in the 16HBEO14o- cell line that while transcribing CFTR at a high level as a result of SV40 Ori- transformation, does not show the DNase I hypersensitive site at 181+10kb that is seen in the other cell types that express CFTR endogenously. However the 7/8 fragment had a positive effect on CFTR promoter activity in the Caco2 cell line. Although the 5/6 fragment had essentially no effect, 1.1 (S.E.= 0.176) × promoter alone, the 7/8 fragment augmented luciferase activity by a mean of 2.2-fold (S.E.= 0.311) with respect to the CFTR promoter alone. The BS0.7 fragment that encompasses the 750-bp fragment of the putative regulatory element (see Fig. 1B, 1AIR-TSR8) caused a mean amplification of luciferase activity of 3.4-fold (S.E.= 0.350). An analysis of variance was performed on log transformed data (to correct for non-normality) with experiment number added to the model as a block to control for temporal variation. After correcting the significance levels for multiple comparisons, the 7/8 and the BS0.7 elements were each seen to have significantly greater activity than the 245 CFTR promoter element alone (p < 0.01 in both cases). However, the 5/6 element did not differ in activity from the promoter alone (p > 0.3). The identification and isolation of element(s) that control expression of the CFTR gene are of particular importance in the context of potential targeted gene therapy for CF. Previous analyses of chromatin structure (and methylation status) of the CFTR gene promoter region have identified a number of DNase 1 hypersensitive sites in a small number of cell lines that show some correlation with CFTR expression in those lines (Koh et al., 1993; Yoshimura et al., 1991a); however, to date the picture is incomplete. We have identified DNase 1 hypersensitive sites at −20.5kb and −79.5kb to the translational start codon of the CFTR gene (Smith et al., 1995); these sites are seen in all cell types we have analyzed. Hence, the search for elements and factors that mediate tissue-specific expression continues. It is likely that regulation of expression of the CFTR gene is complex and involves the interaction of a number of different regulatory factors and elements. We describe here one element that appears to play a role in controlling expression of the CFTR gene. The regulatory element we have identified is located within a DNase I hypersensitive site 10 kb into the first intron of the CFTR gene. This is the first intronic regulatory element to be reported for the CFTR gene. Its location may, in part, explain the failure of several groups to elucidate the elements involved in regulating control of expression of CFTR, because previous analyses of the CFTR promoter region have been restricted to sequences 5′ to and including the first exon. The presence of a regulatory element in the first intron is not unprecedented (Hines et al., 12.Hines R.N. Mathis J.M. Jacobs C.S. Carcinogenesis. 1988; 9: 1599-1605Google Scholar). Through a combination of DNase I footprint analysis and gel mobility shift assays using subfragments of the region (7/8) containing this element and oligonucleotides, we have determined that the regulatory element is located within a sequence of about 40 bp. The 40-bp sequence contains two distinct sites of DNA-protein interactions as illustrated in Fig. 6D. The 5′ side of the MseI site at 720 bp contains the sequence AATCCTAACTCTGTCACTTAT. A minimum of 9 bases (in bold) at the end of this sequence are crucial for the binding of the proteins found specifically in the nuclear extracts of the CFTR-expressing Caco2 and primary epididymal cells. It is probable that additional base pairs may be involved in the interaction. On the 3′ side of the same MseI site is the sequence TAACAATGTGATCTTAGGCAATTTACTT. A minimum of 13 base pairs (in bold) are likely to be involved in DNA binding of the proteins that generate the c1 and c2 complexes detected in CFTR expressing and nonexpressing cells. Analysis of the DNA sequence shown in Fig. 1C reveals the presence of consensus binding motifs for several known transcription factors within the 7/8 region. These include PUT2 ATGTACTT (Siddiqui and Brandriss, 26.Siddiqui A.H. Brandriss M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4634-4641Google Scholar) and inf.1 AAGTGA (Fujita et al., 7.Fujita T. Shibuya H. Hotta H. Yamanishi K. Taniguchi T. Cell. 1987; 49: 357-367Google Scholar). The PUT2 protein functions in concert with the proline utilization pathway of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The regulatory element lies upstream of the TATA box of this gene and is essential in proline induction of the PUT2 gene. The PUT2 homology within the 7/8 region lies within the sequence 671-683 that shows protection on DNase I footprints solely with the primary epididymal cell nuclear extracts (see Fig. 5). The relevance of this putative element to regulation of CFTR gene expression is not inherently obvious. A region of homology with inf.1 lies at the 5′ end of the ASTM2R oligonucleotide on the reverse strand and is coincident with the base pairs that appear to be responsible for binding of the a1 complex observed in Caco2 nuclear extracts. The inf.1 element is a 6-bp unit of a repeated sequence that mediates virus-induced transcription of interferon β, although any relevance to CFTR expression is obscure. Data from the gel mobility shift and DNase I footprint experiments using the 7/8 fragment suggest that there may be a complex of proteins binding within this region. There are clearly one or more proteins that give rise to the gel mobility shifts at positions c1 and c2. In addition to these proteins, other proteins give rise to the unique gel mobility shifts that are associated with CFTR-expressing cells: a1, seen in the colon carcinoma cell lines, and those seen in the primary male genital duct epithelial cells, a2, b1, and b2. The nature and identity of these proteins is currently unclear. The results of oligonucleotide competition experiments suggest that at least some of the proteins bind directly to DNA. The pattern of expression of these proteins in different cell types is of interest. All cell types we have analyzed contain proteins that generate the c1 and c2 complexes that bind to oligonucleotide ASTM4F/R. On the basis of gel mobility shifts, these proteins would appear to be the same in all cells. However, the proteins that bind to the region of the ASTM2F/R and ASTM5F/R oligonucleotides in different cell types are likely not to be all the same. Nuclear extracts from intestinal carcinoma cell lines Caco2 and HT29 and the pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell line Capan1 all produce the same prominent gel mobility shift designated a1. The abundance of this complex is greater in the intestinal carcinomas, and this may reflect the CFTR expression levels in these cells (see Table 1). Nuclear extracts from primary epididymis cells show at least three gel mobility shift bands (a2, b1, and b2) with mobilities differing from the single predominant complex seen in Caco2 nuclear extracts. Oligonucleotide competition experiments have shown that the proteins that cause the a1/a2/b1/b2 gel shifts are all interacting with the sequence of ASTM2F/R and ASTM5F/R. However, the DNase1 footprinting data show a greater region of protection of the DNA backbone by nuclear extracts from the primary cells. We have not determined whether the other proteins are in fact binding directly to the DNA or to other proteins in the DNA-protein complex. We are further characterizing the nature of these proteins. The data from the gel mobility shift assays (taken together with the data showing that the DNase I hypersensitive site at 181+10kb is only seen in cell types that express the CFTR gene) lead us to propose the following model for DNA-protein interactions in this region of the gene. Some protein factors that bind to this region are present in nuclear extracts from most cell types, regardless of their status with respect to CFTR expression, and their presence alone does not create a DNase I hypersensitive site. Additional proteins that bind to the DNA in this region and cause conformational changes in the chromatin structure to expose a DNase I hypersensitive site are expressed in many cell types that endogenously transcribe the CFTR gene. There is evidence for such a mechanism existing in regulatory elements associated with other genes (Jenuwein et al., 15.Jenuwein T. Forrester W.C. Qui R.-G. Grosschedl R. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 2016-2032Google Scholar). At this stage the nature of any interactions between the individual proteins themselves and between each of them and the DNA backbone remains to be elucidated. In vitro transient assays of the activity of the regulatory element (the BS0.7 fragment spanning the 181+10kb site) have shown that it augments the level of the CFTR promoter-mediated expression of the luciferase reporter gene in the Caco2 cell line by a mean of 3.4-fold in 30 independent transfections (six experiments with five dishes of cells for each transfection). Although this enhancement of expression might seem relatively modest, this is not unexpected given the weak activity of the CFTR promoter in driving reporter gene expression in transient assays (Chou et al., 1991; Yoshimura et al., 1991b; Koh et al., 1993). Moreover, the observed enhancement of expression is of the same order of magnitude as has been observed for other regulatory elements in the CFTR gene promoter (McDonald et al., 1995). It is interesting that the 7/8 fragment shows a common gel mobility shift in Caco2 and HT29 but a different shift profile with primary genital duct epithelial cells. Both Caco2 and HT29 are colon carcinoma cell lines that transcribe high levels of CFTR in culture. Although these cell lines are not normal cells, it is likely that they arise from colonic epithelial cells that do express significant amounts of CFTR in vivo. This is in contrast to the 16HBE14o- cell line that is derived from bronchial epithelium, which transcribes very low levels of CFTR in vivo. Thus, high levels of CFTR expression in this line are likely to be a consequence of the SV40 Ori- transformation process. It remains possible that the element that we have identified may be of importance in the expression of CFTR only in specific epithelia such as the intestinal epithelium and male genital duct epithelium.

https://openalex.org/W2150042195,"In Xenopus, normal mesoderm formation depends on signaling through the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) tyrosine kinase receptor. An important signaling pathway from receptor tyrosine kinases involves Ras/Raf/MAP kinase. However, the downstream pathway that occurs in the nucleus to finally trigger gene expression for mesoderm formation remains unknown. We report here that a high level of activator protein-1 (AP-1)-dependent transcriptional activity is detected during the early development of Xenopus embryos. Injection of a dominant negative mutant jun (DNM-jun or TAM67) RNA into the two-cell stage embryos inhibited endogenous AP-1 activity and blocked normal embryonic development with severe posterior truncation in tadpoles. The inhibition of AP-1 activity and the phenotypic change induced by TAM67 was rescued by co-injection of wild-type c-jun RNA, but not by the control β-galactosidase RNA. The FGF-stimulated mesoderm induction was markedly inhibited in animal cap explants from the embryos injected with TAM67. Activin induction of mesoderm, on the other hand, was normal in the embryos injected with TAM67 RNA. These findings suggest that AP-1 mediates FGF, but not activin, receptor signaling during mesoderm induction and the AP-1/Jun is a key signaling molecule in the development of posterior structure."

These results suggest that the MCC protein may play a role in the signaling pathway negatively regulating cell cycle progression."

Our data further indicated that this specific binding is not due to the homo-dimerization of the TR2 orphan receptor. In addition, reporter gene expression using chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assay demonstrated that the TR2 orphan receptor may suppress the expression of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activities via the TR2RE-EPO in the hypoxic/normoxic human hepatoma HepG2 cells. Finally, our in situ hybridization data also indicated that the TR2 orphan receptor and the erythropoietin transcripts can be co-expressed in mouse kidney and liver.

https://openalex.org/W1965297764,"Reversible phosphorylation of CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase, the rate-limiting enzyme of phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis, is thought to play a role in regulating its activity. In the present study, the hypothesis that proline-directed kinases play a major role in phosphorylating cytidylyltransferase is substantiated using a c-Ha-ras-transfected clone of the human keratinocyte cell line HaCaT. Cellular extracts from epidermal growth factor-stimulated HaCaT cells and from ras-transfected HaCaT cells phosphorylated cytidylyltransferase much stronger as compared with extracts from quiescent HaCaT cells. The tryptic phosphopeptide pattern of cytidylyltransferase phosphorylated by cell-free extracts from ras-transfected HaCaT cells was similar compared with the patterns of cytidylyltransferase phosphorylated by p44mpk mitogen-activated protein kinase and p34cdc2 kinase in vitro, whereas in the case of casein kinase II the pattern was different. Furthermore, in c-Ha-ras-transfected HaCaT cells the in vivo phosphorylation state of cytidylyltransferase was 2-fold higher as compared with untransfected HaCaT cells. This higher phosphorylation of cytidylyltransferase in the ras-transfected clone was reduced to a level below the phosphorylation of cytidylyltransferase in untransfected cells, using olomoucine, a specific inhibitor of proline-directed kinases. The reduced phosphorylation of cytidylyltransferase in olomoucine-treated cells correlated with an enhanced stimulation of enzyme activity by oleic acid.

In mammalian cells, the main pathway for the biosynthesis of phosphatidylcholine (PC) 1The abbreviations used are: PCphosphatidylcholineCTCTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferaseMAPmitogen-activated proteinEGFepidermal growth factorMBPmyelin basic proteinSA 2polyclonal peptide-specific antibody against cytidylyltransferase residues 1-17PAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. is via CDP-choline and CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (EC 2.7.7.15) (CT) is the rate-limiting enzyme of this pathway(1.Tronchère H. Record M. Tercé F. Chap H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1212: 137-151Google Scholar). In addition to the structural function as a component of cellular membranes, PC has been identified to be involved into signal transduction via the PC cycle(2.Exton J.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1212: 26-42Google Scholar). In a recent study, the coordination of PC metabolism with the cell cycle was investigated, and evidence was provided that the net biosynthesis of PC is restricted to the S-phase of the cell cycle (3.Jackowski S.

CT exists as a soluble, inactive form that can be activated by translocation to membranes. Many mechanisms that modulate this translocation process have been firmly established(4.Cornell R. Vance D.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 919: 26-36Google Scholar, 5.Geilen C.C. Wieder T. Reutter W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6719-6724Google Scholar, 6.Jamil H. Hatch G.M. Vance D.E. Biochem.

Chem. 1993; 268: 5512-5518Google Scholar), and reversible phosphorylation of CT has been shown to influence translocation of CT between cytosol and membranes(7.Wang Y. MacDonald J.I.S. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5512-5518Google Scholar, 8.Hatch G.M. Iam T.-S. Tsukitami Y. Vance D.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1042: 374-379Google Scholar, 9.Watkins J.D. Kent C. J. Biol.

In many systems cytosolic CT is highly phosphorylated, whereas the membrane-bound, active form of CT is dephosphorylated. However, in a recent study it was shown that dephosphorylation of CT is not required for membrane binding(11.Houweling M. Jamil H. Hatch G.M. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7544-7551Google Scholar). The physiological role of phosphorylation and the kinases involved in this process are still discussed. Whereas CT is a substrate for cAMP-dependent kinase in vitro(12.Sanghera J.S. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1215-1223Google Scholar), neither cAMP-dependent protein kinase (13.Jamil H. Utal A.K. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1752-1760Google Scholar, 14.Watkins J.D. Wang Y. Kent C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 292: 360-367Google Scholar, 15.Wieprecht M. Wieder T. Geilen C.C. Biochem. J. 1994; 297: 241-247Google Scholar) nor protein kinase C (16.Utal A.K. Jamil H. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24084-24091Google Scholar) seem to phosphorylate CT in vivo. In rat hepatocytes and HeLa cells only serine residues of CT are phosphorylated in vivo(14.Watkins J.D. Wang Y. Kent C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 292: 360-367Google Scholar, 17.Watkins J.D. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2190-2197Google Scholar), and the phosphorylation sites of CT from rat liver were identified(18.MacDonald J.I.S. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10529-10537Google Scholar). This study revealed that phosphorylation of CT is confined to the carboxyl-terminal region of CT and that many serine residues reside in potential sites for proline-directed kinases. We have shown recently that growth factors can stimulate phosphorylation of CT in HeLa cells and that CT is a substrate for p44mpk MAP kinase in vitro(19.Wieprecht M. Wieder T. Geilen C.C. Orfanos C.E. FEBS Lett. 1994; 353: 221-224Google Scholar), suggesting that the ras/Raf/MAP kinase-signaling pathway is involved in this process. In the present study, we investigated the phosphorylation of CT in vivo and in vitro. In ras-transfected HaCaT cells, the phosphorylation of CT was increased by 2-fold as compared with the phosphorylation of CT in untransfected cells. The enhanced phosphorylation of CT in ras-transfected cells was reduced in the presence of olomoucine, a specific inhibitor of proline-directed kinases, such as p34cdc2 and p44mpk MAP kinase(20.Vesely J. Havlicek L. Strnad M. Blow J.J. Donella-Deana A. Pinna L. Letham D.S. Kato J.Y. Detivaud L. Leclerc S. Meijer L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 224: 771-786Google Scholar). Using this experimental approach we could show that phosphorylation of CT interferes with the activation of the enzyme by oleic acid and protects the enzyme against proteolytic digestion. Furthermore, cell-free extracts from quiescent and EGF-stimulated HaCaT cells as well as ras-transfected HaCaT cells were used to phosphorylate CT in vitro. The tryptic phosphopeptide patterns of CT phosphorylated with cell-free extracts from HaCaT and ras-transfected HaCaT cells were compared with the patterns of CT phosphorylated with purified MAP kinase, cyclin-dependent kinase, and casein kinase II in vitro. The results presented here substantiate the hypothesis that p44mpk MAP kinase is involved in the phosphorylation of CT, but other proline-directed kinases, such as p34cdc2 kinase, represent probable candidates as well. The ECL immunoblotting detection reagent and [methyl-14C]phosphocholine (2.04 GBq/mmol) were from Amersham (Braunschweig, Germany). [γ-32P]ATP (110 TBq/mmol) was from Hartmann Analytic (Braunschweig, Germany). 33P as orthophosphoric acid (370 MBq/ml) was from ICN Biomedicals (Meckenheim, Germany). Silica Gel 60 high performance thin layer chromatography plates, cellulose plates, and all solvents and reagents (reagent grade) were purchased from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). Dithiothreitol, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, myelin basic protein, oleic acid, phosphatidylcholine, and staurosporine were from Sigma (München, Germany). Olomoucine and iso-olomoucine were from LC Laboratories (Grünberg, Germany), and stock solutions of 40 mM were prepared in Me2SO. Human EGF was from Biomol (Hamburg, Germany). Polyclonal MAP kinase antibody (ERK-1) was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). p44mpk MAP kinase and p34cdc2 kinase were from UBI (Lake Placid, NY), and casein kinase II was purchased from Boehringer (Mannheim, Germany). The spontaneously immortalized human keratinocyte cell line HaCaT (21.Boukamp P. Petrussevska R.T. Breitkreutz D. Hornung J. Markham A. Fusenig N.E. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 761-771Google Scholar) and the ras-transfected clone I-7 (22.Boukamp P. Stanbridge E.J. Foo D.Y. Cerutti P.A. Fusenig N.E. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 2840-2847Google Scholar) were gifts from Dr. N. Fusenig (Deutsches Krebsforschungzentrum, Heidelberg, Germany). Cells were grown in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 0.35 g/liter glutamine, 100 000 IU/liter penicillin, and 0.1 g/liter streptomycin in plastic culture dishes (Nunc, Denmark). Media and culture reagents were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. (Karlsruhe, Germany). Penicillin and streptomycin were from Boehringer. For the experiments, normal HaCaT cells were used between passages 32 and 45, and ras-transfected HaCaT cells were used between passages 12 and 25. Prior to EGF stimulation, confluent cells were starved for 24 h in keratinocyte basal medium (Clonetics, San Diego, CA) containing no supplements. Under these conditions, proliferation of HaCaT cells and ras-transfected HaCaT cells was totally abolished. For this, 2 × 106 confluent cells were washed two times with 5 ml of phosphate-free Dulbecco's minimal essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) and then incubated in 2 ml of phosphate-free Dulbecco's minimal essential medium containing 300 μCi of carrier-free [33P]PO4 and different concentrations of olomoucine or iso-olomoucine. After 2 h the cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed by sonication in 1 ml of 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% sodium dodecylsulfate, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 mM NaF, and 1 mM sodium vanadate. Cytidylyltransferase was immunoprecipitated from the samples as described below using CT antibody SA 2. Stimulation of MAP kinase activity was measured by a modified method of Dubois and Bensaude(23.Dubois M.-F. Bensaude O. FEBS Lett. 1993; 324: 191-195Google Scholar). After treatment with keratinocyte basal medium containing 100 ng/ml EGF, cells (2 × 106/dish) were washed with ice-cold buffer A (12.5 mM MOPS (pH 7.2), 20 mM sodium glycerophosphate, 7.5 mM magnesium cloride, 1 mM ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid, 1 mM sodium vanadate, 0.2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mg/ml leupeptin, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 100 μM sodium fluoride) and lysed on ice with 500 μl of buffer A containing 1% Triton X-100. Cytosolic extracts were cleared by centrifugation for 2 min at 13,000 × g. Phosphorylation of myelin basic protein (MBP) was performed by incubating 2 μl of cytosolic extracts at 30°C with 20 μl of buffer A containing [γ-32P]ATP (50 μCi/ml, 50 μM), staurosporine (1 μM) and MBP (0.4 mg/ml) for 20 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 5 × Laemmli buffer(24.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). After electrophoresis in 12.5% polyacrylamide gels, the gels were dried and autoradiographed. Bands corresponding to MBP were excised from the gel, and incorporated radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting. Immunoblotting was performed as described(25.Wieder T. Geilen C.C. Wieprecht M. Becker A. Orfanos C.E. FEBS Lett. 1994; 345: 207-210Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 × 106 cells that had been previously treated with 100 ng/ml EGF in keratinocyte basal medium were homogenized in 300 μl of buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% sodium dodecylsulfate, 1 mM sodium vanadate, 1 mM NaF, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin. Proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. Both MAP kinase isoforms, p42mpk and p44mpk, were detected with a polyclonal rabbit antibody (1:200) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The same procedure was applied to detect CT in cellular extracts from HaCaT cells using CT antibody SA 2. CT was expressed in Sf 21 insect cells using the XPRESS System® from Invitrogen (San Diego, CA) as described (26.Luche M.M. Rock C.O. Jackowski S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 301: 114-118Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, rat CT cDNA clone, which was a gift of Dr. R. Cornell (Burnaby, BC, Canada), was digested with BamHI. The fragment was ligated into BamHI-digested and phosphatase-treated pBlue Bac His vector. The pCT Blue Bac His plasmid DNA was mixed with wild type linear AcNPV DNA (3:1 ratio) and cotransfected into Sf 21 cells using cationic liposomes, according to the manufacturer's instructions. The culture supernatant was collected, titered, and used to infect a lawn of Sf 21 cells that were overlaid with agarose. Blue plaques were picked and subjected to three cycles of plaque purification until cells with inclusion bodies were not detected. For expression of CT, 9 × 106 Sf 21 cells in a 15-cm diameter dish were infected with purified recombinant baculovirus in TC-100 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Expression of CT was assessed by Western blot analysis and measurement of CT activity. 64 h after infection, Sf 21 cells were collected in medium, pelleted, and stored at −80°C. Rat liver CT expressed in Sf21 insect cells was used for in vitro phosphorylations. 20 nmol/min of CT activity was immunoprecipitated using the antibody SA 2 (25.Wieder T. Geilen C.C. Wieprecht M. Becker A. Orfanos C.E. FEBS Lett. 1994; 345: 207-210Google Scholar) bound to protein A-Sepharose. To immunoprecipitate CT, 50 μl of antiserum SA 2 were incubated with 5 mg of protein A-Sepharose in 2 ml of buffer 1 (50 mM Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate) for 3 h at 4°C after which the antibody coupled protein A-Sepharose was sedimented by centrifugation and incubated overnight at 4°C with homogenates of infected Sf 21 cells. The protein A-Sepharose was centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 2 min, and the supernatant was discarded. The immune complex was washed three times with buffer 1 and one time with phosphate-buffered saline. CT was dephosphorylated with 5 units of alkaline phosphatase in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.7) for 15 or 30 min at 30°C. The immune complex was washed again three times with buffer 1 and one time with phosphorylation buffer containing 15 mM MOPS (pH 7.2), 2 mM dithiothreitol, 12.5 mM β-glycerophosphate, 7.5 mM MgCl2, 2 mM EGTA, 5 mM NaF, and 1 mM sodium vanadate. Then phosphorylation was performed in the presence of different kinases or cell-free extracts and 100 μM [γ-32P]ATP (20 μCi/assay) at 37°C in a total volume of 200 μl. After 30 min the reaction was stopped by adding SDS sample buffer, and the mixtures were loaded on SDS-PAGE (10% acrylamide) and electrophoresed. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and the membrane was exposed to Kodak XAR 5 film to detect cytidylyltransferase. Bands corresponding to CT were excised, and incorporated radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting. Digestion of CT and peptide separation was performed as described by Boyle et al.(27.Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201B: 110-149Google Scholar). Briefly, bands corresponding to CT were excised from the nitrocellulose membrane, and the strips were incubated with 0.5% polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP-360) in 100 mM acetic acid to prevent adsorption of trypsin to the nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane pieces were washed three times with water and subsequently incubated in 200 μl of 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate (pH 8.2) containing 10 μg of L-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin. Additional fresh trypsin (10 μg) was added after 2 and 4 h of incubation. The total incubation time was 6 h. The membrane pieces were washed, and the combined supernatants were dried in a Speed-Vac® and washed by three cycles of resuspension and vacuum drying using 200 μl of distilled water for each cycle. Samples were resuspended in 5 μl of electrophoresis buffer (water/acetic acid/formic acid, 897:78:25, v/v/v) and spotted on cellulose thin layer chromatography sheets (0.1-mm thickness). Separation of the phosphopeptides was accomplished by electrophoresis at 1000 V for 45 min followed by ascending chromatography in n-butanol/water/pyridine/acetic acid (15:12:10:3, v/v/v/v) for 7 h. CT activity was measured by a modified method of Sohal and Cornell (28.Sohal P.S. Cornell R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11746-11750Google Scholar) using liposomes containing 400 μM PC and different concentrations of oleic acid as described previously(15.Wieprecht M. Wieder T. Geilen C.C. Biochem. J. 1994; 297: 241-247Google Scholar). Protein was determined by the BCA assay (29.Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Google Scholar) with BSA as standard. Statistical comparisons were made in these studies with Student's t test. Activation of the MAP kinase cascade was measured by incubating the cells with EGF, and MAP kinase activity was assessed by measuring the rate of phosphorylation of MBP, a known substrate of MAP kinases. Fig. 1A shows the phosphorylation of MBP after 2 and 10 min of EGF stimulation in untransfected HaCaT cells. After 10 min of EGF treatment, phosphorylation of MBP was 220% as compared with the control. In contrast, MBP was highly phosphorylated without EGF stimulation in ras-transfected HaCaT cells, and the addition of EGF had no further stimulating effect on phosphorylation of MBP. After 10 min of EGF treatment, incorporation of phosphate into MBP was 95% of basal activity (determined by scintillation counting of excised bands). MAP kinases are activated by phosphorylation(30.Blenis J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5889-5892Google Scholar). It is known that the phosphorylation of both isoforms, p42mpk and p44mpk, leads to a mobility shift in the SDS gel. As shown in the Western blot of Fig. 1B, p42mpk and p44mpk are expressed in HaCaT cells and become phosphorylated time-dependently after EGF stimulation. In ras-transfected HaCaT cells, both isoforms of MAP kinase appear as phosphorylated, high molecular weight forms that were not influenced by EGF stimulation. To investigate the phosphorylation state of CT in cell culture experiments, HaCaT cells and the ras-transfected clone were metabolically labeled with [33P]orthophosphoric acid. After 2 h of incubation time, phosphorylation of CT was elevated by about 2-fold in ras-transfected cells as compared with the phosphorylation of CT in untransfected HaCaT cells (Fig. 2). In additional experiments, the activity of CT was assayed in HaCaT cells and ras-transfected HaCaT cells. In the absence of exogenous liposomes CT activity was 0.31 ± 0.05 nmol/min/mg of protein in HaCaT cells and 0.37 ± 0.03 nmol/min/mg of protein in ras-transfected cells (n = 3), indicating that the increased phosphorylation of CT in ras-transfected cells did not have a significant effect on its basal activity. To address the question of which kinase(s) phosphorylate CT in the cells, the purine analogue olomoucine was used in cell culture experiments. This compound was shown to specifically inhibit the activity of cell cycle-regulating kinases and p44mpk MAP kinase (20.Vesely J. Havlicek L. Strnad M. Blow J.J. Donella-Deana A. Pinna L. Letham D.S. Kato J.Y. Detivaud L. Leclerc S. Meijer L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 224: 771-786Google Scholar). Iso-olomoucine, on the contrary, is confirmed as a general kinase inhibitor with much lesser specificity for these kinases. Fig. 2 shows that the phosphorylation of CT observed in ras-transfected HaCaT cells is inhibited by olomoucine in a concentration-dependent manner. In the presence of 100 μM olomoucine, the phosphorylation of CT in ras-transfected HaCaT cells is reduced by 72%, whereas the phosphorylation of CT is reduced by only 39% in the presence of the same concentration of iso-olomoucine (see Fig. 2). To investigate the role of phosphorylation of CT by proline-directed kinases, ras-transfected HaCaT cells were treated with 100 μM olomoucine and 0.25% Me2SO as controls for 4 h. As already shown in the previous chapter, proline-directed phosphorylation of CT was significantly reduced by treatment with olomoucine. After extraction of CT, lipid-mediated activation of the enzyme was determined in the presence of different amounts of oleic acid. Whereas the basal activity was not significantly influenced by olomoucine pretreatment of the cells, activation in the presence of 100 and 400 μM oleic acid was enhanced by about 2-fold (Fig. 3). We also tested the possibility that phosphorylation of CT affects enzyme stability to endogenous proteases. For this, cellular extracts from olomoucine- and Me2SO-treated cells were incubated for different time periods at 37°C in the absence of protease inhibitors. After the incubation, the reaction was stopped by the addition of SDS-sample buffer and CT, and digestion products of CT were visualized by Western blot analysis using the CT-specific antibody SA 2. As shown in Fig. 4, degradation products of CT with an apparent molecular mass below 30 kDa were observed after 20 min in extracts from olomoucine-treated cells. On the other hand, no degradation products of this size were observed in extracts from control cells. To substantiate the hypothesis that proline-directed kinases are involved in the phosphorylation of CT, immunoprecipitated CT was incubated with cell-free extracts from HaCaT cells and ras-transfected HaCaT cells (corresponding to the conditions shown in Fig. 1). Phosphorylation of CT was very low when extracts from quiescent HaCaT cells were used in the assay, and the phosphorylation was significantly stimulated by pretreatment of quiescent HaCaT cells with 100 ng/ml EGF. On the other hand, extracts from quiescent ras-transfected HaCaT cells strongly phosphorylated CT, and pretreatment of ras-transfected cells with 100 ng/ml EGF did not cause higher phosphorylation of CT (Fig. 5). The weak phosphorylation of immunoprecipitated CT in the absence of cytosol was probably due to the activity of endogenous kinases (see also Fig. 6) and did not disturb the in vitro assay.Figure 6:Phosphorylation of cytidylyltransferase by different kinases in vitro. Rat liver CT expressed in Sf21 insect cells was immunoprecipitated using protein A-Sepharose and antibody SA 2. The washed immune complex was dephosphorylated with alkaline phosphatase and incubated with 2 × 10-5 μmol/min p44 MAP kinase, p34cdc2 kinase, and casein kinase II for 30 min at 30°C. Phosphorylated CT was separated by SDS-PAGE. A representative autoradiogram from two independent experiments is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Additionally, the effect of olomoucine on the phosphorylation of CT by cellular extracts from ras-transfected cells in vitro was investigated. The strong phosphorylation of CT catalyzed by cellular extracts from ras-transfected HaCaT cells was reduced in the presence of olomoucine far more potently than in the presence of the unspecific kinase inhibitor iso-olomoucine. To verify that olomoucine inhibits p44mpk MAP kinase and p34cdc2 kinase and not casein kinase II in our system, we investigated the effect of olomoucine on the phosphorylation of CT by the purified kinases in vitro. Although the phosphorylation of CT is reduced in the case of p44mpk MAP kinase and p34cdc2 kinase, olomoucine has no inhibitory effect on casein kinase II activity (see Table 1).Tabled 1 In order to investigate the phosphorylation of CT in more detail, we used three different kinases in an in vitro phosphorylation assay. Fig. 6 illustrates that immunoprecipitated CT is phosphorylated by MAP kinase (p44mpk), cyclin-dependent protein kinase (p34cdc2), and casein kinase II. In all assays equal kinase activities were used (2 × 10-5 μmol/min). As also mentioned in the previous section, phosphorylation of CT in the absence of exogenous kinases was very low. The radioactivity incorporated into CT was determined by scintillation counting of excised bands, and the background phosphorylation in the control was defined as 100%. In relation to the control, the incorporation of phosphate into CT catalyzed by p44mpk and p34cdc2 was 333 and 420%, respectively, whereas incorporation of phosphate into CT was only 165% in the case of casein kinase II. In another set of experiments, immunoprecipitated CT was phosphorylated by MAP kinase, cyclin-dependent kinase, casein kinase II, and cell-free extracts from quiescent HaCaT cells and ras-transfected HaCaT cells, followed by digestion with L-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin and two-dimensional separation of phosphorylated peptides. In order to obtain a sufficiently high 32P label in the phosphorylated peptides, the purified kinases were used in this assay at the highest specific activity available. The peptide maps obtained in the presence of purified kinases were compared with the patterns of digested CT phosphorylated by cell-free extracts from quiescent HaCaT cells and ras-transfected HaCaT cells (Fig. 7). Confirming the results in the previous section, phosphorylation of the different peptides by extracts from ras-transfected cells was higher as compared with phosphorylation by extracts from normal HaCaT cells. However, with the exception of spots 10 and 12, the patterns of HaCaT cells and ras-transfected HaCaT cells were identical. Furthermore, the patterns obtained by phosphorylation with MAP kinase and cdc2 kinase (especially the spots numbered 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, and 12) resembled the pattern of ras-transfected HaCaT cells. In contrast, when casein kinase II was used in the assay two predominant phosphopeptides were obtained (spots 4 and 7), resulting in a different phosphopeptide pattern as compared with the other patterns. Reversible phosphorylation is a universal mechanism regulating enzymatic processes in eukaryotic cells. It has been known for some time that CT is regulated by reversible phosphorylation(1.Tronchère H. Record M. Tercé F. Chap H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1212: 137-151Google Scholar, 7.Wang Y. MacDonald J.I.S. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5512-5518Google Scholar, 9.Watkins J.D. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21113-21117Google Scholar, 31.Pelech S.L. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 257: 14198-14202Google Scholar). However, the kinases involved in this process remain to be identified. Many approaches have used different protein kinase activators (13.Jamil H. Utal A.K. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1752-1760Google Scholar, 14.Watkins J.D. Wang Y. Kent C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 292: 360-367Google Scholar, 16.Utal A.K. Jamil H. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24084-24091Google Scholar) and kinase inhibitors (15.Wieprecht M. Wieder T. Geilen C.C. Biochem. J. 1994; 297: 241-247Google Scholar) as well as phosphatase inhibitors (10.Hatch G.M. Jamil H. Utal A.K. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15751-15758Google Scholar) to investigate the phosphorylation of CT. In the present paper, a different approach is presented using the human keratinocyte cell line HaCaT and a c-Ha-ras-transfected clone of this cell line. In untransfected HaCaT cells, MAP kinases became activated rapidly after EGF stimulation of the cells. On the other hand, MAP kinases were already fully activated in ras-transfected HaCaT cells without EGF stimulation, confirming the well known effect that EGF treatment and ras transfection stimulate MAP kinase activity(30.Blenis J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5889-5892Google Scholar). Cell culture experiments revealed that ras-transfected HaCaT cells contained a highly phosphorylated form of endogenous CT, suggesting that the activation of MAP kinases might also be important for the phosphorylation of CT in vivo. The increased phosphorylation of CT in ras-transfected cells did not influence CT activity when determined in the absence of stimulating liposomes. However, we could clearly demonstrate that activation of CT by oleic acid was enhanced when phosphorylation of the enzyme was reduced by olomoucine treatment. This is in accordance to previous findings by Yang and Jackowski(32.Yang W. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16503-16506Google Scholar), who showed that a mutant of CT lacking the COOH-terminal phosphorylation domain is much more sensitive to stimulation by lipids when compared with the wild type enzyme. Furthermore, we tested the hypothesis that phosphorylation of CT influences the stability of the enzyme. Using extracts from olomoucine-treated cells that mainly contained dephosphorylated CT, we could demonstrate that CT was more susceptible to digestion by endogenous proteases in vitro. In this context it has been shown that down-regulation of CT by cholecystokinin treatment of pancreatic acinar cells correlates with a decrease in CT phosphate levels, indicating that phosphorylation of CT protects the enzyme from degradation(33.Groblewski G.E. Wang Y. Ernst S.A. Kent C. Williams J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1437-1442Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of CT by extracts from quiescent HaCaT cells was very low, and EGF stimulation as well as ras transfection of HaCaT cells obviously activated kinases or inactivated phosphatases. As a consequence, the phosphorylation of CT by extracts from EGF-stimulated or ras-transfected HaCaT cells was much stronger. Additionally, olomoucine, a purine analogue that was shown to specifically inhibit cyclin-dependent kinases and p44mpk MAP kinase (20.Vesely J. Havlicek L. Strnad M. Blow J.J. Donella-Deana A. Pinna L. Letham D.S. Kato J.Y. Detivaud L. Leclerc S. Meijer L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 224: 771-786Google Scholar) reduced phosphorylation of CT in vivo and in vitro, suggesting an involvement of proline-directed kinases in this process. Phosphorylation of CT by cAMP-dependent protein kinase or PKC has finally been ruled out. Because the cDNA of rat liver CT contains many consensus phosphorylation sequences for proline-directed kinases (like p34cdc2 kinase and MAP kinase) and one consensus sequence for casein kinase II(34.Kalmar G.B. Kay R.J. Lachance A. Aebersold R. Cornell R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6029-6033Google Scholar), we tested these kinases in their ability to phosphorylate rat liver CT in vitro. All three kinases were able to phosphorylate CT, and p34cdc2 kinase catalyzed the strongest incorporation of 32P into CT. The advantage of the approach presented here, using rat liver CT as a substrate for phosphorylation by cellular extracts and purified kinases, is that the tryptic phosphopeptide patterns of CT can be compared with each other. Using this system, difficulties arising from differences in the amino acid sequence of CT from different species are ruled out. The number of different spots obtained was similar to patterns presented by other groups, using rat liver CT as well(18.MacDonald J.I.S. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10529-10537Google Scholar). Interestingly, the pattern obtained after phosphorylation of CT by cellular extracts from ras-transfected HaCaT cells was similar to the patterns obtained after phosphorylation by purified p44mpk MAP kinase and p34cdc2 kinase. On the other hand, phosphorylation of CT by casein kinase II revealed a different tryptic phosphopeptide pattern, suggesting that this kinase plays a minor role in phosphorylating CT. In this context, it is interesting to note that a mutant of CT with an alanine residue in the potential phosphorylation site for casein kinase II showed the same properties as compared with the wild type enzyme(35.Sweitzer T.D. Kent C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 311: 107-116Google Scholar). The findings presented here, together with results showing that growth factors stimulate phosphorylation of CT in HeLa cells(19.Wieprecht M. Wieder T. Geilen C.C. Orfanos C.E. FEBS Lett. 1994; 353: 221-224Google Scholar), substantiate the hypothesis that proline-directed kinases, such as MAP kinases or cyclin-dependent kinases, are involved in the phosphorylation of CT.

Fusenig (Deutsches Krebsforschungzentrum, Heidelberg, Germany) for providing HaCaT cells, and M. Draeger (Freie Universität Berlin) for expert assistance with the thin layer electrophoresis."

In contrast to the ubiquitous CaMKII, CaMKIV is more restricted in its expression in different tissues. The highest levels of the enzyme in mammalian tissues can be found in brain, thymus, and, to a somewhat lower extent, in testis and spleen, whereas in other tissues the enzyme remained undetectable (3.Ohmstede C.-A.

Here we report the specific induction of CaMKIV by T3 in a time- and concentration-dependent manner at a very early stage of brain differentiation using a fetal rat telencephalon primary cell culture system, which can grow and differentiate under chemically defined conditions(32.Honegger P. Lenoir D. Favrod P. Nature. 1979; 282: 305-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The induction is T3-specific, i.e. the expression of the enzyme cannot be induced by either reverse T3 or retinoic acid. The expression of CaMKIV is regulated on both the transcriptional and the translational level, since both the addition of actinomycin D as well as cycloheximide to the cultural medium can prevent the T3-dependent induction of the enzyme. In addition, the T3-specific induction can be observed both on the mRNA and on the protein level. This is the first report in which a second messenger-dependent kinase involved in the control of cell regulatory processes is itself controlled by a primary messenger, the thyroid hormone. Preliminary accounts of part of the data presented here have been given elsewhere(33.Krebs, J., Honegger, P.

GS 8Google Scholar). Serum-free, rotation-mediated aggregating cell cultures were prepared from fetal (15 days of gestation) rat (OFA/Ico/Ibm strain, Biological Research Laboratories Ltd., Basel, Switzerland) telencephalon, as described in detail previously(32.Honegger P. Lenoir D. Favrod P. Nature. 1979; 282: 305-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Aliquots of 6 × 107 cells were transferred to DeLong flasks and maintained under constant gyratory agitation at 37°C, in an atmosphere of 10% CO2 and 90% humidified air. The culture medium used was Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.), supplemented with nutritional factors, vitamins, trace elements, transferrin (1 mg/liter), insulin (800 nM), and hydrocortisone 21-phosphate (20 nM). Gentamicin sulfate (25 mg/liter) was used as an antibiotic. For analyses, the aggregates of each flask were washed twice with 5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Proteins were extracted, usually from the pellet of whole aggregates (4-5 × 107 cells), by adding 200 μl of 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mM EGTA, 2 mM DTT, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mM leupeptine, 1 mML-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone, 1 mMNα-p-tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone, 1,10-phenanthroline, 1 mMp-aminobenzamidine (buffer A), and incubated on ice for 10 min after extensive vortexing. After centrifugation at 25,000 × g for 5 min, proteins in the supernatant were stored at −70°C. To 40 μl of supernatants of cellular extracts, 20 μl of loading buffer (35.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (207159) Google Scholar) was added and the proteins were separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE(35.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (207159) Google Scholar). After electrophoretic transfer onto nitrocellulose sheets for 2 h using 240 mM glycine, 30 mM Tris, 20% methanol, and 0.02% SDS as transfer buffer, the blots were incubated overnight at 4°C with 2% milk powder in PBS as blocking buffer, afterward incubated at room temperature for 3 h with 125I-CaM (36.Zurini M. Krebs J. Penniston J.T. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 618-627Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (2 × 105 cpm/ml) in 2% milk powder/PBS containing either 1 mM CaCl2 or 5 mM EGTA, washed once with 2% milk powder/PBS containing either CaCl2 or EGTA, then with PBS containing either CaCl2 or EGTA, and third with PBS. Each washing was done for 15 min. After drying the blots under cold air, the sheets were exposed either to x-ray sensitive films (Kodak XAR-5) at −70°C or to PhosphorImager screens (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) at room temperature and developed. Quantitation was obtained using the PhosphorImager software as recommended by the manufacturers. CaM was purified from bovine brain as described previously(37.Guerini D. Krebs J. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 15172-15177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For RNA preparation, cell culture aggregates (6-8 × 108 cells) were grown for 5 days either in the absence or in the presence of 3 × 10-8M T3, washed three times with PBS, and quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was isolated by using the Ultraspec RNA kit (Biotecx Laboratories, Inc., Houston, TX) as described by the manufacturer. For the identification of CaMKIV-specific mRNA, 40 μg of total RNA was denatured and size-fractionated on a 1.5% agarose, 2.2 M formaldehyde gel. Electrophoresis was carried out at 30 V for 16 h with circulating Na3PO4 buffer at 4°C. Prior to blotting the gels were stained with ethidium bromide to identify 18 and 28 S rRNA as markers. The RNA was transferred onto Biotrans nylon membranes (ICN Biomedicals, Inc., Costa Mesa, CA) and stabilized by using UV cross-linking. Northern blots were prehybridized and hybridized at 37°C in 50% formamide as described previously(38.Slaughter G.R. Needleman D.S. Means A.R. Biol. Reprod. 1987; 37: 1259-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The probe was a 1-kilobase pair (BamHI-KpnI) fragment of the rat CaMKIV cDNA (4.Means A.R. Cruzalegui F. LeMagueresse B. Needleman D. Slaughter G. Ono T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3960-3971Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) and was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP according to the random oligonucleotide priming method of Feinberg and Vogelstein(39.Feinberg A. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16653) Google Scholar). Aggregates of a total of 20 culture flasks (~109 cells), grown for 5 days in the presence of T3 (3 × 10-8M), have been homogenized at 4°C in three volumes of ice-cold buffer A, basically following the purification protocol for CaMKIV described in (40.Hanissian H. Frangakis M. Bland M.M. Jawahar S. Chatila T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20055-20063Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the lysates were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatants were pooled and applied to a 15-ml DEAE-cellulose column equilibrated with 25 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 0.5 mM EGTA, 0.5 mM EDTA, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mM DTT (buffer B). The column was washed with 10 bed volumes of buffer B, and bound proteins were eluted with a stepwise gradient using buffer B and increments of 100 mM NaCl at each step. p64 eluted between 150 and 300 mM NaCl. The fractions containing p64 were pooled and applied onto a prepacked 1-ml hydroxylapatite column from Bio-Rad equilibrated with buffer B containing 200 mM NaCl (buffer C). The column was washed with five bed volumes of buffer C, and bound proteins were eluted with a linear 0-200 mM NaH2PO4 gradient. p64-containing fractions eluting between 75 and 100 mM NaH2PO4 were pooled, dialyzed overnight against 5 liters of 25 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 2 mM CaCl2, 2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT (buffer D), and applied to a 5-ml CaM column (36.Zurini M. Krebs J. Penniston J.T. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 618-627Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) equilibrated with buffer D. After washing the column with 10 bed volumes of buffer D containing 10% glycerol (buffer E), followed by a wash of five bed volumes with buffer D containing 0.5 M NaCl, p64 was eluted by a buffer containing 25 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 2 mM EDTA, 5 mM EGTA, 1 mM DTT, 10% glycerol. Purified p64 was identified as a calmodulin-dependent kinase by autophosphorylation using the assay as described by Cruzalegui and Means(11.Cruzalegui F.H. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26171-26178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Autophosphorylated CaMKII α and β were identified by specific antibodies, kindly provided by Dr. H. Schulman. Identification of p64 as CaMKIV by specific antibodies was carried out by Western blotting using 2% milk powder/PBS as blocking buffer. Aggregating cell cultures prepared from 15-day fetal rat telencephalon and grown for 5 days in the presence or absence of the thyroid hormone 3,3′,5-triiodo-L-thyronine (T3) in a chemically defined medium were collected and extracted with an EGTA-containing buffer. The extracted proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electrophoretically transferred onto nitrocellulose, and CaM-binding proteins were identified by incubation with 125I-labeled CaM in the presence or absence of Ca2+. As shown in Fig. 1A, a number of different CaM-binding proteins were present in the Mr range between 40,000 and 160,000, which could not be detected in the presence of EGTA (data not shown). By comparing cultures that were grown for 5 days either in the presence or absence of 3 × 10-8M T3, it was obvious that one CaM-binding protein with a Mr of 64,000 (later identified as CaMKIV; see below) appeared only in cultures grown in the presence of T3, suggesting that its expression depended on this hormone. This result could be corroborated by the observation that in Northern blots of total RNA isolated from similar cell cultures a mRNA of 2 kilobases could be clearly identified by a probe specific for CaMKIV (Fig. 1B). This band could only be observed in the presence of T3, but not in its absence (even at higher RNA concentrations; data not shown). On the other hand, a band of 3.5 kilobases, which has been described before as a much less abundant mRNA of CaMKIV in adult rat brain(3.Ohmstede C.-A. Jensen K.F. Sahyoun N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5866-5875Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4.Means A.R. Cruzalegui F. LeMagueresse B. Needleman D. Slaughter G. Ono T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3960-3971Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), could be observed as a weak band even in the absence of T3-induced cultures. The difference between the two mRNAs could derive from differences in the 3′-untranslated region by use of alternate poly(A) sites as discussed before(4.Means A.R. Cruzalegui F. LeMagueresse B. Needleman D. Slaughter G. Ono T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3960-3971Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), but the reason for the apparent difference in the T3-dependent expression between the two mRNAs needs further investigation. Since the apparent molecular weight and autophosphorylation kinetics showed similarities between p64 and CaMKIV we attempted to purify p64 from a pool of aggregate cultures grown for 5 days in the presence of 3 × 10-8M T3 by applying a modification of the purification protocol of Hanissian et al. ((40.Hanissian H. Frangakis M. Bland M.M. Jawahar S. Chatila T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20055-20063Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); see also “Experimental Procedures”). As shown in Fig. 2, p64 eluted from the DEAE-cellulose column at a concentration of NaCl between 200 and 300 mM, typical for CaMKIV. Further purification was obtained by using a hydroxylapatite column, and finally a CaM affinity column. After extensive washing with a calcium-containing buffer, p64 was eluted using an EGTA-containing buffer (Fig. 2). The purified protein was identified as a CaM-dependent kinase by CaM-dependent autophosphorylation (Fig. 2B) and as CaMKIV by specific antibodies (Fig. 2A). Using immunoprecipitation CaMKIV could be identified only in cells that had been grown in the presence of T3 (data not shown). With respect to its Mr of 64,000-65,000 and its prenatal appearance, p64 most likely represents the α-isoform of CaMKIV since the β-polypeptide has a slightly higher Mr, i.e. 67,000, is specifically expressed in brain only in cerebellum, and can be observed only postnatally(6.Frangakis M.V. Chatila T. Wood E.R. Sahyoun N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17592-17596Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was noted that autophosphorylation of pure p64 was rather slow, as described by Cruzalegui and Means (11.Cruzalegui F.H. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26171-26178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for a recombinant CaMKIV. On the other hand, slow phosphorylation of p64 could also be indicative for the presence of contaminating amounts of the recently described CaMKIV kinase(13.Okuno S. Fujisawa H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1993; 114: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 14.Okuno S. Kitani T. Fujisawa H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 116: 923-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 15.Tokumitsu H. Brickey D.A. Glod J. Hidaka H. Sikela J. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15520-15527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Selbert M.A. Anderson K.A. Huang Q.-H. Goldstein E.G. Means A.R. Edelman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17616-17621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The other CaM-binding proteins exhibiting Mr values between 60,000 and 63,000 were identified as CaMKIIβ and calcineurin A, respectively, by using monoclonal antibodies against CaMKIIβ and by comparison with purified calcineurin. It appeared that in contrast to CaMKIV, the expression of both CaMKII and calcineurin was independent of T3 (data not shown). The influence of T3 was studied further in a dose- and time-dependent expression of CaMKIV. As shown in Fig. 3, the enzyme was detectable already at very low concentrations of T3 (3 × 10-10M; Fig. 3) and increased in intensity with increasing concentrations of T3 in the culture medium, indicating that the induction of CaMKIV by T3 was dose-dependent. In addition, when cultures received T3 (3 × 10-8M) for various lengths of time, CaMKIV was already detectable after 6 h of stimulation (Fig. 4), and the amount of CaMKIV increased as a function of the duration of the stimulus until maximal expression was reached between 24 and 48 h, suggesting that protein synthesis played a role in the induction of this gene. This interpretation was corroborated by incubating the cell cultures with either actinomycin D or cycloheximide, respectively, to prevent transcription or protein synthesis of the inducible gene. As can be seen from Fig. 5, CaMKIV was clearly induced after exposure to 3 × 10-8M T3 for 24 h (Fig. 5, lane 3; see also Fig. 4, lane 4), but the protein was not detectable if the cultures had been preincubated for 1 h with either 1 μM actinomycin D (Fig. 5, lane 5) or 5 μM cycloheximide (Fig. 5, lane 4), respectively, before T3 was added. This is in contrast to the other detectable calmodulin-binding proteins, which during the time period of observation (i.e. 24 h) were independent of transcription or translation.Figure 4125I-CaM overlay of extracts of fetal rat telencephalon cell cultures grown in the absence (lane 1) or in the presence of 3 × 10-8M T3.

Molecular size standards (in kDa) are indicated at the left; the arrow denotes the location of CaMKIV.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A further observation supporting the view that the expression of CaMKIV was a T3-specific process was the finding that next to T3 only T4 was able to induce CaMKIV (Fig. 6, lanes 2 and 3). On the other hand, neither reverse T3 nor retinoic acid could induce the expression of CaMKIV (Fig. 6, lanes 4 and 5). In addition, neither nerve growth factor nor epidermal growth factor were able to induce the expression of the kinase (data not shown), although both growth factors have been demonstrated to regulate developmental processes in these cultures(41.Honegger P. Lenoir D. Dev. Brain Res. 1982; 3: 229-238Crossref Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 42.Honegger P. Guentert B. Dev. Brain Res. 1983; 11: 245-251Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Also, CaMKIV may be specifically expressed in neurons, since it was found at high levels in neuron-enriched aggregate cultures (data not shown), in which highly proliferating glial cells have been suppressed by the addition of 1-β-D-arabino-furanosylcytosine (Ara-C)(31.Corthésy-Theulaz I. Mérillat A.-M. Honegger P. Rossier B.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: C124-C131Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent reports suggested that CaMKIV is responsible for the Ca2+-dependent regulation of expression of a number of immediate early genes such as c-fos, due to the phosphorylation of the cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB) (12.Enslén H.

Biol. 1995; 15: 3672-3684Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that during rat brain development the expression of CaMKIV, not detectable at the early stages of ontogenesis (i.e. at E15; data not shown) is regulated by the thyroid hormone in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Whether this T3-dependent regulation is due to a direct interaction of the T3-receptor with a responsive element of the CaMKIV gene (28.Evans R.M. Science. 1988; 240: 889-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (6322) Google Scholar) or whether the effect is indirect remains to be determined, but since the T3-specific induction of CaMKIV could also be observed on the mRNA level, this observation could be indicative for a T3-receptor-dependent regulation. In this respect it is of interest that in a recent abstract (43.Larson, C. A., Hsu, J.-H., Frazer, B., Chatila, T. A., Brent, G. A. (1995) Proceedings of the 77th Meeting of the Endocrine Society, Washington, D. C., June 14-17, Abstr. OR1-6, p. 48, The Endocrine Society, Bethesda, MDGoogle Scholar), it was reported that in a mouse embryonic stem cell-derived neuronal culture system the expression of CaMKIV was strictly dependent on the presence of the thyroid hormone receptor. In addition, it should be noted that Shakagami et al.(7.Sakagami H. Watanabe M. Kondo H. Mol. Brain Res. 1992; 16: 20-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) observed a rather late appearance of the mRNA of CaMKIV during rat embryonal development, between days 15 and 18 of gestation, i.e. at about the onset of the embryonal synthesis of the thyroid hormone(44.Kawaoi A. Tsuneda M. Acta Endocrinol. 1985; 108: 518-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). These findings strongly corroborate our observation that the presence of the thyroid hormone is essential for the expression of CaMKIV. It will be now of interest whether the expression of the CaMKIV kinase is also regulated during brain development and how it correlates with the expression of CaMKIV. In addition, it will be important to know whether in the immune system and in testis CaMKIV is also under the control of the thyroid hormone or whether different signals regulate the expression. Preliminary results indicate that the synthesis of CaMKIV in the rat embryonal thymus is induced following the same time course as in the embryonal brain. 2J. Krebs, unpublished observations.

https://openalex.org/W1996042616,"The purified plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase is fully activated through the enzyme concentration-dependent self-association at physiologically relevant Ca2+ concentrations (Kosk-Kosicka, D., and Bzdega, T.(1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 18184-18189; Kosk-Kosicka, D., Bzdega, T., and Wawrzynow, A.(1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 19495-19499). We have previously shown that the Ca2+-ATPase activity of the oligomeric enzyme is independent of calmodulin, in contrast to another active enzyme species, a presumable monomer, that is activated by calmodulin binding. Presently, we have succeeded in determining the molecular mass of the two active enzyme species by equilibrium ultracentrifugation. For the calmodulin-dependent species, the molecular mass is 170 ± 30 kDa, which is consistent with predominantly monomeric Ca2+-ATPase with bound calmodulin. The molecular mass of calmodulin-independent oligomers is 260 ± 34 kDa, indicating that they are dimers. Results of experiments performed under different calcium and potassium concentrations and in the presence of dextran that causes molecular crowding verify a strict Ca2+ requirement of the dimerization process. We conclude that the active species of the Ca2+-ATPase are a monomer-calmodulin complex and a dimer. The purified plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase is fully activated through the enzyme concentration-dependent self-association at physiologically relevant Ca2+ concentrations (Kosk-Kosicka, D., and Bzdega, T.(1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 18184-18189; Kosk-Kosicka, D., Bzdega, T., and Wawrzynow, A.(1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 19495-19499). We have previously shown that the Ca2+-ATPase activity of the oligomeric enzyme is independent of calmodulin, in contrast to another active enzyme species, a presumable monomer, that is activated by calmodulin binding.

We conclude that the active species of the Ca2+-ATPase are a monomer-calmodulin complex and a dimer. The erythrocyte Ca2+-ATPase is a plasma membrane Ca2+ pump responsible for Ca2+ removal from the cytoplasm to maintain the steep Ca2+ concentration gradient. The protein exhibits an Mr of 134,000 upon SDS-gel electrophoresis, in agreement with its primary sequence (for review, see (3.Carafoli E. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 993-1002Google Scholar)). It has been shown recently that the erythrocyte enzyme consists of two isoforms encoded by two different genes designated PMCA1 and PMCA4(4.Shull G.E. Grieb J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8646-8657Google Scholar, 5.Verma A.K. Filoteo A.G. Stanford D.R. Wieben E.D. Penniston J.T. Strehler E.E. Fisher R. Heim R. Vogel G. Mathews S. Strehler-Page M.A. James P. Vorherr T.

Chem. 1990; 265: 2835-2842Google Scholar). The isoforms are expressed in all of the tissues recently tested by Western blot analysis and are believed to be housekeeping pump isoforms, whereas PMCA2 and PMCA3, which are absent from erythrocyte plasma membrane, are more specialized (7.Stauffer T.P. Guerini D. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12184-12190Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that the Ca2+ pump isolated from human erythrocytes undergoes reversible, enzyme concentration-dependent oligomerization that reaches maximal levels at 30-40 nM enzyme(1.Kosk-Kosicka D. Bzdega T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18184-18189Google Scholar, 2.Kosk-Kosicka D. Bzdega T. Wawrzynow A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19495-19499Google Scholar). The oligomerization process produces a highly cooperative Ca2+-regulated activation of the enzyme at physiologically relevant calcium concentrations (KCa2+ ≈ 50 nM)(2.Kosk-Kosicka D. Bzdega T. Wawrzynow A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19495-19499Google Scholar, 8.Kosk-Kosicka D. Bzdega T. Johnson J.D. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1875-1879Google Scholar). Using measurements of fluorescence resonance energy transfer between appropriately labeled enzyme molecules, we were able to differentiate two active species of the enzyme, which we defined as oligomers and monomers with bound calmodulin(2.Kosk-Kosicka D. Bzdega T. Wawrzynow A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19495-19499Google Scholar). Calmodulin can activate the enzyme, apparently by binding to the monomeric form. Calmodulin does not increase the activity of enzyme oligomers, and the resonance energy transfer measurements indicate that calmodulin does not dissociate preformed oligomers(9.Kosk-Kosicka D. Bzdega T. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3771-3777Google Scholar). Instead, calmodulin-monomer complex formation appears to be competitive with a monomer to oligomer transition, and both enzyme species are fully active. The extent of oligomerization and thus the structure of the active forms of the enzyme could not be determined by the methods used previously, and it is this point that is addressed here. Some of these data have been reported in a preliminary form(10.Sackett D.L. Kosk-Kosicka D. Biophys. J. 1993; 64: A334Google Scholar). Egg yolk phosphatidylcholine (P5763) and CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B and dextran (D4751) were purchased from Sigma, and octaethylene glycol dodecyl ether (C12E8) was obtained from Nikko (Tokyo, Japan). Coupling of bovine calmodulin to Sepharose was performed in accordance with Pharmacia Biotech Inc. instructions as described earlier(1.Kosk-Kosicka D. Bzdega T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18184-18189Google Scholar). The methods used for preparation of erythrocyte ghost membranes, purification of the Ca2+-ATPase from the membranes, and determination of protein and Ca2+ concentrations were as described previously(1.Kosk-Kosicka D.

Free Ca2+ concentrations were calculated from total calcium and EGTA concentrations based on the constants given by Schwartzenbach et al.(12.Fabiato A. Fabiato F. J. Physiol. (Paris). 1979; 75: 463-505Google Scholar, 13.Schwartzenbach G. Senn H. Andereff G. Helv. Chim. Acta. 1957; 40: 1886-1900Google Scholar). Total calcium was measured by atomic absorption. This was determined by colorimetric measurement of inorganic phosphate production as described previously(1.Kosk-Kosicka D. Bzdega T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18184-18189Google Scholar). The standard reaction mixture contained 50 mM Tris maleate, pH 7.4, 120 mM KCl, 8 mM MgCl2, 3 mM ATP, 1 mM EGTA, and CaCl2 at a concentration yielding 17.5 μM free Ca2+. In some experiments, KCl concentration was reduced to 20 mM and free Ca2+ was 100 nM as specified in Table 2 and Table 3. The concentration of C12E8 was kept constant at 150 μM. The enzyme was either 15 or 50 nM as indicated in Table 2, and calmodulin, when present, was 100 nM. Total reaction volume was 100 μl. The reaction was started with 3 mM ATP and carried out for up to 30 min at 37 or 25°C. Aliquots were withdrawn at various times for colorimetric inorganic phosphate measurement. Steady-state velocities were obtained from plots of inorganic phosphate production that were linear with time.Tabled 1 The state of oligomerization of the enzyme was determined by equilibrium ultracentrifugation. The studies were performed using both a Beckman model E analytical ultracentrifuge and a model XLA. Both studies used absorbance optics for the analysis. The instruments are described in detail below followed by a description of the sample preparation, centrifugation protocol, and data treatment. The model used for these studies was equipped with a xenon arc light source, a Beckman DU monochromator, a standard Beckman scanner, modifications to minimize background light, and a digital data collection system. All of these modifications are described in detail elsewhere(14.Sackett D.L. Lippoldt R.E. Gibson C. Lewis M. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 180: 319-325Google Scholar). All runs used double sector scanner cells with elevated bases and quartz windows. Samples were usually run in a Ti AN-F 4-place rotor. Scans were performed at 280 nm, and background scans were collected at 350 nm. The slit width on this instrument is quite broad (2 mm), giving a spectral bandwidth of 10-20 nm, centered on the chosen wavelength. This was a standard Beckman Ultima series XLA analytical ultracentrifuge. Runs were performed with the 3-sample (6-hole) centerpiece with quartz windows. Cells were centrifuged in the 4-place, An-60-Ti rotor. The monochromator of the XLA provides much higher spectral resolution than is possible with the model E. The bandwidth is about 2 nm. Additionally, the XLA optics allow analysis at wavelengths as short as 190 nm. We were unable to use the lower wavelengths available due to high buffer absorbance. Scans were typically taken at 230, 280, and 350 nm. Following recording of the absorbance scan at equilibrium, the rotor speed was increased to deplete the meniscus region of the sample column, and the cells were rescanned to provide an estimate of the base-line absorbance value. Enzyme solutions were prepared for analysis by thawing an aliquot of the enzyme stored in the elution buffer (10 mM Tris maleate, pH 7.4, 120 mM KCl, 5 mM EGTA, 0.5 mM MgCl2, 0.75 mM C12E8, 20% glycerol, 2 mM dithiothreitol) at −80°C and diluting it appropriately in the reaction mixture with additions required for a given experiment (denoted in Table 2 and Table 3 as solution conditions). The length of time between thawing and diluting the enzyme and placing the loaded rotor into the centrifuge was kept to a minimum, typically <15 min. Total time between thawing the enzyme and recording the equilibrium concentration gradient was approximately 4 h. Standard conditions (50 mM Tris maleate, pH 7.4, 120 mM KCl, 17 μM free Ca2+, 1 mM EGTA, 8 mM MgCl2, 150 μM C12E8) yielded fully active enzyme at 50 nM. The loaded rotor was placed directly into the centrifuge and accelerated to about 2,000 rpm. A scan was taken at this speed to provide a base line of absorbance and to check for any rapidly sedimenting, large aggregates, which were not found. The rotor speed was then increased to 12,000-15,000 rpm, and scans were taken at approximately 45-min intervals until subtracting one scan from the previous scan gave a flat line, indicating no change during the intervening 45 min(14.Sackett D.L. Lippoldt R.E. Gibson C. Lewis M. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 180: 319-325Google Scholar). Scans were taken at this point for calculation. At the end of the run, the rotor speed was increased to 35,000 rpm for 45 min to deplete the meniscus. Scans were then taken to provide an estimate of the base-line absorbance (non-sedimentable absorbance due to buffer). Most runs were performed at 20°C. Some early runs were at 25°C, but no differences were seen. There were two technical problems posed in the application of this technique to the Ca2+-ATPase system. First, the low optical density presented by 50 nM enzyme meant that detection of signal over background was difficult. Second, the lability of the enzyme upon dilution in standard buffer conditions placed limits on the possible length of experiments and therefore the available time to reach equilibrium. The lability of the enzyme required that analysis be performed as quickly as possible after thawing and diluting the enzyme. This requirement was accommodated by using small sample volumes (40 μl) that yielded short column heights (<1 mm) and consequently rapid attainment of equilibrium(15.Sackett D.L. Lippoldt R.E. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 3511-3517Google Scholar). These small samples could be accommodated in both instruments used. About 4 h of centrifugation proved to be enough to reach equilibrium. Under these conditions, the enzyme lost about 30% activity during this time, as shown in Table 1.Tabled 1 The problem presented by low optical density was reduced by averaging multiple scans. In the case of the model E data collected at 280 nm, multiple scans of each cell were taken at equilibrium, aligned at the meniscus, and points at corresponding radial positions were averaged. In the case of the XLA data collected at 230 nm, data at each radial position were averages of several determinations, as set by the control parameters of the scans. Multiple experiments were performed in this way on both instruments. At sedimentation equilibrium, the gradient of concentration (cr) of a molecule as a function of radius (r) from the center of rotation is given by cr=cbexp⁡(MBC(r2−rb2))(Eq. 1) where rb is the radius of a reference point such as the base of the cell and cb is the concentration of the molecule at that point. M is the weight average molecular mass of the molecule, B is the buoyancy factor (discussed below), and C = ω2/2RT, where ω is the angular velocity, R is the gas constant, and T is the absolute temperature. The data (absorbance versus radius) will then be of the form Ar=Abpexp⁡(MBC(r2−rb2))+e(Eq. 2) where Ar is the absorbance at radius r, Ab,p is the absorbance at the base of the cell due to the protein, and e is a base-line absorbance term. The buoyancy factor B is defined as S=(1−vρ)(Eq. 3) where v is the partial specific volume of the molecule and ρ is the solution density. If the protein has bound detergent, an additional term must be added to correct for the buoyancy of the detergent, and B becomes B=((1−vpρ)+δd(1−vdρ))(Eq. 4) where σd is the amount (g) of detergent bound per g of protein and vd is the partial specific volume of the detergent. In the absence of measured values for the amount of bound detergent, σd, centrifugation is commonly carried out in solutions of varying density, allowing extrapolation to the condition where the solution density ρ = 1/vd. At this point, the second term in B becomes 0, and only the protein partial specific volume, vd, influences the observed buoyant molecular weight(16.Reynolds J.A. McCaslin D.R. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 117: 41-53Google Scholar). The same result is obtained if the detergent used has partial specific volume equal to 1/ρ. This is the case here since the buffer is not much different from water (measuring ρ20 = 1.014 g/cm3) and the detergent, C12E8, has partial specific volume, v = 0.973(17.Tanford C. Nozaki Y. Rohde M.F. J. Phys. Chem. 1977; 81: 1555-1560Google Scholar). With this detergent in low salt buffer, the bound detergent makes little contribution to the buoyancy factor B, and thus the second term in B may be taken as 0(18.McCaslin D.R. Tanford C. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 5212-5221Google Scholar). Data were thus fit to with B defined as in. Data from the model E were analyzed using the non-linear least squares fitting routines of MLAB (Civilized Software, Bethesda, MD) and a logarithmic form of, as described previously(15.Sackett D.L. Lippoldt R.E. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 3511-3517Google Scholar). Error estimates given are the standard error estimates given by the MLAB fitting routine. Data from the XLA were analyzed using the software provided by Beckman. Model E data were also analyzed using the Beckman software with the same fitting results as obtained with MLAB. Standard error estimates are not calculated by the Beckman fitting routines and were estimated in a different way. Following data collection, the rotor was run at higher speed for approximately 40 min in order to record the base-line (non-sedimentable) absorbance. The mean base-line absorbance and its associated standard deviation were calculated. The data were then fit three times with the base-line value held fixed at the mean value, at the mean +1 S.D., or at the mean −1 S.D. The best fit values obtained were taken as estimates of molecular mass ± S.D. The partial specific volume of the protein was taken as v = 0.73. In experiments in which a complex with calmodulin was examined, the complex was also assumed to have v = 0.73 since the v calculated (19.Cohn E.J. Edsall J.T. Proteins, Amino Acids, and Peptides. Van Nostrand Reinhold, New York1943: 370-381Google Scholar) for bovine calmodulin was 0.72. We undertook the determination of the molecular mass of different forms of the erythrocyte Ca2+-ATPase, the oligomeric form with calmodulin-independent activity and the form with calmodulin-dependent activity previously termed monomer. To characterize the enzyme, we have applied analytical ultracentrifugation that is a rigorous means of determining the mass of covalent and non-covalent macromolecular complexes(20.Harding S.E. Rowe A.J. Horton J.C. Analytical Ultracentrifugation in Biochemistry and Polymer Science. Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, UK1992Google Scholar, 21.Schuster T.M. Laue T.M. Modern Analytical Ultracentrifugation. Birkhauser, Cambridge, MA1994Google Scholar). Due to the technical difficulty of obtaining data from samples containing very diluted proteins, the lowest enzyme concentration at which we could determine the molecular mass of the Ca2+-ATPase was 50 nM. At this concentration, the enzyme is fully oligomerized as indicated by Ca2+-ATPase activity and fluorescence resonance energy transfer measurements(1.Kosk-Kosicka D. Bzdega T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18184-18189Google Scholar, 2.Kosk-Kosicka D. Bzdega T. Wawrzynow A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19495-19499Google Scholar). To circumvent the very low signal to noise problem of direct measurements at the low protein concentrations typical of monomers (K12 = 8-15 nM enzyme), we performed experiments under several conditions listed in Table 2 in which calcium and potassium concentrations have been changed, calmodulin was added, and molecular crowding was achieved by the addition of dextran. The first question we approached was the oligomerization state of the enzyme under conditions that yield full Ca2+-ATPase activity in the absence of calmodulin (set 1 in Table 2). This was addressed by determining the molecular mass of the 50 nM enzyme in the standard buffer under conditions at which the enzyme concentration-dependent activation of the Ca2+-ATPase by self-association has been demonstrated(1.Kosk-Kosicka D. Bzdega T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18184-18189Google Scholar, 2.Kosk-Kosicka D. Bzdega T. Wawrzynow A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19495-19499Google Scholar). Typical gradients recorded in the model E at 280 nm and in the XLA at 230 nm are presented in Fig. 1. The best fit masses for these data sets were averaged and are presented in Table 3(set 1). The data from the model E (271 ± 28 kDa) and the XLA (252 ± 42 kDa) are both consistent with a predominantly dimeric form of the enzyme whose calculated molecular mass is ∼270 kDa.Tabled 1 The second condition (Table 2, set 2) addresses the effect of calmodulin. In the presence of calmodulin, the ATPase is fully active, but fluorescence energy transfer measurements between labeled enzyme molecules indicate that the enzyme does not oligomerize under these conditions(9.Kosk-Kosicka D. Bzdega T. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3771-3777Google Scholar). In agreement with the fluorescence measurements, 50 nM enzyme, when added to superstoichiometric (100 nM) calmodulin, no longer behaves in the centrifuge as a dimer (Table 3, set 2 and Fig. 2). The apparent molecular mass is lowered as compared with the results obtained with 50 nM enzyme alone. Results with both instruments yield a mass of about 170 kDa, which is consistent with a complex between the enzyme monomer and calmodulin (predicted mass of 151 kDa). In the third condition tested (Table 2, set 3), calcium and potassium concentrations were decreased compared with standard conditions (Table 2, set 1). At low K+/Ca2+ concentrations, the activity of the 50 nM enzyme is very low and is stimulated by calmodulin. This behavior is typical of the so-called monomeric enzyme (1.Kosk-Kosicka D. Bzdega T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18184-18189Google Scholar, 9.Kosk-Kosicka D. Bzdega T. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3771-3777Google Scholar) (compare also with set 4 in Table 2). The molecular mass of about 180 kDa (Table 3, set 3) is lower than that calculated for dimers. The finding indicates that the observed low activity and its dependence on calmodulin are due to the fact that monomers are a dominant part of the enzyme population under these conditions. More information on enzyme association at the low K+/Ca2+ concentrations condition was derived from experiments with dextran. Dextran was used because its addition to the Ca2+-ATPase at 15 nM concentration (at which concentration the Ca2+-ATPase requires calmodulin for activation, suggesting that it is monomeric) induced self-association of the enzyme as judged by fluorescence resonance energy transfer experiments(22.Kosk-Kosicka D. Lopez M.M. Fomitcheva I. Lew V.L. FEBS Lett. 1995; 371: 57-60Google Scholar), and thus led to full, calmodulin-independent activity (Table 2, set 4). Dextran had no effect on the 50 nM (dimeric) enzyme (Table 2, set 1; for details, see also (22.Kosk-Kosicka D. Lopez M.M. Fomitcheva I. Lew V.L. FEBS Lett. 1995; 371: 57-60Google Scholar)). Addition of dextran to the 50 nM enzyme at low K+/Ca2+ concentrations in the absence of calmodulin (Table 2, set 3) did not increase Ca2+-ATPase activity, indicating that the apparent molecular mass of about 180 kDa (Table 3, set 3) is that of monomers that are prevalent under these conditions. Apparently at low calcium, the enzyme simply cannot self-associate. Also, at low enzyme concentration (15 nM) in the presence of low K+/Ca2+, the Ca2+-ATPase activity (Table 2, set 5) is not fully activated in the presence of dextran, again indicating that insufficient calcium hinders dimerization. Potassium concentration appeared to have no significant effect on enzyme dimerization since the apparent molecular mass of the 50 nM enzyme in the presence of high K+ (but also in the absence of Ca2+) was again about 170 kDa (Table 3). The application of analytical centrifugation with the modifications introduced previously to analyze the dimerization of the labile protein tubulin (14.Sackett D.L. Lippoldt R.E. Gibson C. Lewis M. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 180: 319-325Google Scholar, 15.Sackett D.L. Lippoldt R.E. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 3511-3517Google Scholar) made it possible to finally determine the sizes of the two species of the plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase whose contribution to enzyme activity was demonstrated several years ago(1.Kosk-Kosicka D. Bzdega T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18184-18189Google Scholar, 2.Kosk-Kosicka D. Bzdega T. Wawrzynow A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19495-19499Google Scholar, 8.Kosk-Kosicka D. Bzdega T. Johnson J.D. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1875-1879Google Scholar, 9.Kosk-Kosicka D. Bzdega T. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3771-3777Google Scholar, 23.Kosk-Kosicka D. Bzdega T. Wawrzynow A. Scaillet S. Nemcek K. Johnson J.D. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1990; 269: 169-171Google Scholar). We have now established that the fully active calmodulin-independent enzyme is dimeric. We have also confirmed that the species activated by calmodulin is indeed a monomer-calmodulin complex. Previous attempts to establish the sizes were hampered by the low enzyme concentrations at which the transformation from calmodulin-dependent monomers to the calmodulin-independent dimers of Ca2+-ATPase occur (K12 = 8-15 nM enzyme, see (1.Kosk-Kosicka D. Bzdega T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18184-18189Google Scholar) and (2.Kosk-Kosicka D. Bzdega T. Wawrzynow A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19495-19499Google Scholar)). The fact that the centrifuge data were collected on two different instruments, which was a necessity due to a coincidence in timing, proved to be an advantage allowing us to compare two independently obtained data sets. The model E and the model XLA are quite different instruments, but they yielded comparable results. The model E has a very wide spectral bandpass and was essentially limited to 280 nm for these experiments. This presented a problem of low absorbance at this wavelength of the Ca2+-ATPase at 50 nM. The XLA, in contrast, has a narrow spectral bandpass and allowed wavelengths as low as 190 nm to be used for analysis. Additionally, the XLA data acquisition system is considerably simpler to use and much more powerful than the one we had on the model E. Lower wavelengths presented a significantly higher sample absorbance but also presented a significantly increased buffer absorbance background. A compromise of 230 nm was chosen. This allowed a reasonable sample absorbance to be recorded but introduced significant noise in the base-line determination, requiring a different approach to error estimation. Despite these differences and the problems common to both, experiments with the two instruments provided results that indicate the same biological result. The molecular mass of the enzyme in the absence of calmodulin is consistent with the predominance of dimers (Fig. 1), while the molecular mass of the enzyme in the presence of calmodulin is consistent with monomer-calmodulin complexes (Fig. 2). Within the 4 h required for equilibration, the molecular mass was never significantly higher than that expected for enzyme dimers, thus indicating absence of a meaningful amount of oligomers of a higher size than of dimers. In addition, the analytical centrifugation confirmed two previous findings that have been made using fluorescence spectroscopy methods (fluorescence energy transfer and polarization measurements). First, activation by enzyme dimerization is a Ca2+-dependent process(2.Kosk-Kosicka D. Bzdega T. Wawrzynow A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19495-19499Google Scholar). Second, our data indicated that the equilibrium between enzyme monomers and dimers and the availability of calmodulin to the two enzyme forms determine the activation pathway of the purified Ca2+-ATPase(9.Kosk-Kosicka D. Bzdega T. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3771-3777Google Scholar). Accordingly, the distinctly lowered molecular mass of 50 nM enzyme that was centrifuged to equilibrium at insufficient Ca2+ indicates a predominantly monomeric population in agreement with the extent of dimerization that is limited by the availability of Ca2+. Second, in the presence of superstoichiometric calmodulin at optimal Ca2+, the enzyme at 50 nM concentration after 4 h equilibrated to yield molecular mass that is consistent with monomer-calmodulin species rather than with dimers (Fig. 2). This finding could be plausibly explained by the differences in the affinities of the enzyme-calmodulin and the enzyme-enzyme interactions. The apparent affinity of enzyme monomer for calmodulin is higher (Kd = 1.6-3.5 nM) (1.Kosk-Kosicka D. Bzdega T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18184-18189Google Scholar, 24.Graf E. Penniston J.T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1981; 210: 257-262Google Scholar) than its affinity for another monomer (Kd = 8-15 nM enzyme)(2.Kosk-Kosicka D. Bzdega T. Wawrzynow A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19495-19499Google Scholar). While the affinity for calmodulin binding to the dimer is not known, there are multiple experimental demonstrations of such binding(1.Kosk-Kosicka D. Bzdega T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18184-18189Google Scholar, 23.Kosk-Kosicka D. Bzdega T. Wawrzynow A. Scaillet S. Nemcek K. Johnson J.D. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1990; 269: 169-171Google Scholar). In fluorescence spectroscopy measurements of 5-min duration, an addition of calmodulin to the dimers formed between donor-labeled and acceptor-labeled enzyme molecules did not decrease energy transfer, suggesting that calmodulin did not dissociate them. However, calmodulin prevented increased energy transfer resulting from dimerization if it was added to 28 nM donor-labeled enzyme before the addition of 28 nM acceptor-labeled enzyme(9.Kosk-Kosicka D. Bzdega T. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3771-3777Google Scholar). The results generated by analytical ultracentrifugation are consistent not only with fluorescence spectroscopy measurements but also with the results produced by another approach, induction of enzyme self-association by molecular crowding in the presence of dextran. We have previously demonstrated that dextran induces oligomerization of enzyme molecules at concentrations that are too low (beginning with 6 nM enzyme) for significant self-association under standard conditions(22.Kosk-Kosicka D. Lopez M.M. Fomitcheva I. Lew V.L. FEBS Lett. 1995; 371: 57-60Google Scholar). At present, we have shown that at insufficient Ca2+ even dextran cannot force the enzyme to dimerize. In conclusion, the two active species of erythrocyte Ca2+-ATPase identified 7 years ago can be now recognized as a dimer and a monomer-calmodulin complex. We thank Dr. Allen Minton (NIDDK, NIH) for the use of the XLA ultracentrifuge."
https://openalex.org/W2110338531,"The fructose permease of Escherichia coli, the fructose-specific Enzyme II of the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system (PTS), contains a duplicated IIB domain. The protein therefore consists of three distinct domains, B′, B, and C (N-terminal to C-terminal), joined by flexible linkers and is thus designated FruB′BC. The N-terminal B′ domain was removed using molecular genetic techniques, and the truncated Enzyme II (FruBC) was characterized relative to the wild-type enzyme both in vivo and in vitro. In vivo, FruBC exhibited depressed fermentation characteristics at low fructose concentrations. [14C]Fructose uptake measurements revealed reduced rates only when the permease was rate-limiting for transport. In vitro, FruBC exhibited a 10-fold lower affinity for its phosphoryl donating protein, the IIA-FPr diphosphoryl transfer protein (DTP), than was observed with the wild-type enzyme, and the maximal velocity of fructose phosphorylation was 7-fold depressed. Because the fructose-1-phosphate:[14C]fructose transphosphorylation reaction appeared normal, we conclude that the loss of the B′ domain primarily affected phosphoryl transfer between the IIA and IIB domains of the permease. A mutant FruBC derivative with cysteine 112 replaced by serine (C112S FruBC) was inactive as a phosphoryl carrier and a sugar transport protein. Expression of the plasmid-encoded mutant protein inhibited the in vivo activity of the chromosomally encoded wild-type fructose permease, but it did not observably affect the activities of the mannitol or glucitol PTS permeases or of non-PTS sugar permeases. Further, the presence of the detergent extracted mutant protein inhibited the activity of the detergent solubilized wild-type or FruBC enzyme. In contrast, the wild-type FruB′BC permease was apparently epistatic over the truncated FruBC permease in vivo. The experiments reported 1) show that the B′ domain of the fructose permease functions to facilitate phosphoryl transfer between DTP and the permease, 2) establish the essentiality of cysteine 112 in the B domain of the permease, 3) provide evidence that a functional fructose permease consists of an oligomer in which both IIB domains must be active for the enzyme to catalyze normal rates of phosphoryl transfer and transport, 4) suggest that a single B′ domain in the oligomeric Enzyme II is sufficient to allow high efficiency phosphoryl transfer between the IIA domain of DTP and the IIB domain of the permease, and 5) show that the B′ domain is not important for oligomerization."
https://openalex.org/W1996103793,"This paper demonstrates that specific chymotryptic digestion of the cytoplasmic domain of the beta subunit of Na/K-ATPase leads to changes in the kinetics of occlusion of Rb+ ions. The experiments utilize extensively trypsinized Na/K-ATPase, which lack cytoplasmic loops of the alpha subunit, whereas membrane-embedded fragments (a COOH-terminal 19 kDa and three fragments of 8.1-11.7 kDa) containing transmembrane segments and extracellular loops are intact. The beta subunit is partially split into NH2- and COOH-terminal fragments of 16 and approximately 50 kDa, respectively. Cation occlusion and ouabain binding are preserved. The 19-kDa membranes were incubated, at 37 degrees C, with a selection of proteases, in the presence of Rb+ ions. In these conditions, only alpha-chymotrypsin destroyed the ability to occlude Rb+ ions. This process was associated with truncation of the 16-kDa fragment of the beta subunit in two stages. In the first stage, chymotrypsin removed 10 residues from the 16-kDa fragment to form a 15-kDa fragment (NH2-terminal Ile15) and 4 or 6 residues from the NH2 terminus of the alpha subunit fragment beginning at Asp68. In these membranes Rb+ occlusion was still intact at 37 degrees C. Strikingly, however, deocclusion of two Rb+ ions, which is characteristically biphasic in 19-kDa membranes, displayed deocclusion kinetic with mainly one fast phase. These membranes also showed a much lower affinity for Rb+ ions compared with 19-kDa membranes; and, consistent with the lower Rb+ affinity, Rb+ ions, at nonsaturating concentrations, protected less well against thermal inactivation of Rb+ occlusion. In the second stage, the 15-kDa fragment was truncated further to a 14-kDa fragment (NH2-terminal Leu24), followed by thermal destabilization of Rb+ occlusion even at high concentrations of Rb+ ions. Eventually, the thermally inactivated complex of fragments of alpha and beta subunits was digested to the limit peptides. The results suggest that the cytoplasmic domain of the beta subunit interacts with that of the alpha subunit, possibly with residues leading into the first transmembrane segment, and controls access of Rb+ ions into or out of the occlusion sites."
https://openalex.org/W2067197849,"In mouse preadipocyte Ob1771 cells, transcription of the insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) gene was stimulated by growth hormone (GH), and IGF-I protein combined with GH in medium was required for their differentiation to adipocytes. During induction of the differentiation, the intracellular expression of each class of IGF-I mRNA was analyzed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. When the cells were cultured in the presence of GH, the class 1del. IGF-I mRNA was a major molecular species among IGF-I mRNAs. In the presence of both GH and IGF-I, the splicing pattern of IGF-I mRNA changed from class 1del. to class 1. Moreover, as detected by Western blotting, the IGF-I protein was present in cells and in the medium only when the cells were cultured in the presence of both GH and IGF-I. We found that IGF-I secreted from Ob1771 cells could act in an autocrine/paracrine fashion and induce the differentiation of other Ob1771 cells. It was demonstrated that the translation efficiency of class 1 mRNA was higher than that of class 1del. mRNA in vitro. These results suggested that stimulation with exogenous IGF-I in the presence of GH was required for the production of class 1 IGF-I mRNA and that the production of the IGF-I protein was activated by increasing the translation efficiency through shifting the splicing pattern of IGF-I mRNA from class 1del. to class 1. Exogenous IGF-I triggered the differentiation by initiating the synthesis of endogenous IGF-I.

We found that IGF-I secreted from Ob1771 cells could act in an autocrine/paracrine fashion and induce the differentiation of other Ob1771 cells. It was demonstrated that the translation efficiency of class 1 mRNA was higher than that of class 1del. mRNA in vitro. These results suggested that stimulation with exogenous IGF-I in the presence of GH was required for the production of class 1 IGF-I mRNA and that the production of the IGF-I protein was activated by increasing the translation efficiency through shifting the splicing pattern of IGF-I mRNA from class 1del. to class 1. Exogenous IGF-I triggered the differentiation by initiating the synthesis of endogenous IGF-I."

The present study describes that individual recombinant α and β chains of human MHC class II molecules lacking the transmembrane region (α-Tm and β-Tm) are capable of binding antigenic peptide and that these complexes of chain-peptide are recognized by TCRs to induce antigen-specific apoptosis in restricted T cells. The α-Tm and the β-Tm of human HLA-DR2 (DRB5∗0101) were cloned, expressed in Escherichia coli, and purified in large scale by conventional chromatographic methods. The in vitro binding of an immunodominant epitope from the myelin basic protein (MBP-(83-102)Y83) to purified DR2α-Tm and DR2β-Tm was demonstrated with biotinylated and fluoresceinated MBP-(83-102)Y83 peptide. The specificity of the MBP-(83-102)Y83 peptide binding to both DR2α-Tm and DR2β-Tm was demonstrated in a competitive peptide binding assay. When exposed to a transformed T cell clone (SS8T) restricted to DR2(DRB5*0101) and MBP-(84-102) peptide, complexes of DR2α-Tm and DR2β-Tm with MBP-(83-102)Y83 peptide were able to specifically recognize TCRs as measured by the increase in γ-interferon (γ-IFN) cytokine. Such recognition of TCRs by soluble α-MBP-(83-102)Y83 and β-MBP-(83-102)Y83 complexes led to the induction of antigen-specific apoptosis in SS8T cells as measured by double fluorescence flow cytometry and electron microscopy. These results provide the first evidence that soluble complexes of antigenic peptide and individual chains of human MHC class II molecules lacking the transmembrane region can recognize TCRs and induce antigen-specific apoptosis in T cells. Since activated CD4-positive T cells are involved in pathogenesis of various autoimmune diseases, the apoptosis triggered by individual soluble chain-peptide complexes has significant potential for eliminating autoreactive T cells.

Furthermore, each polypeptide contains two distinct extracellular domains (α1/α2 in the α chain and β1/β2 in the β chain), a transmembrane region and a small cytoplasmic C terminus region. The crystal structure of MHC class II molecules reveals that the extracellular α1 and β1 domains of both chains are involved in creating the peptide binding groove of MHC class II molecules (11.Brown J.H.

The first observation for the binding of antigenic peptide to individual α and β polypeptide of MHC class II molecules appeared in a study where fluorescence peptide was found to be associated with both chains when murine class II-peptide complexes were subjected to SDS-gel electrophoresis under reduced conditions(14.Rothenhausler B. Dornmair K. McConnell H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 352-354Google Scholar). Recent results from our laboratory have showed that electroeluted purified native individual α and β polypeptide chains isolated from affinity-purified murine MHC class II proteins are capable of binding antigenic peptide (15.Passmore D. Kopa D. Nag B. J. Immunol. Methods. 1992; 155: 193-200Google Scholar) and that purified chain-peptide complexes can stimulate T cells in vitro as measured by an increase in extracellular acidification rate in a sensor-based assay(16.Nag B. Wada H.G. Deshpande S.V. Passmore D. Kendrick T. Sharma S.D. Clark B.R. McConnell H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 87: 352-354Google Scholar). In earlier studies, the possibility of T cell activation by MHC chain-peptide complexes was also suggested by the ability of alloreactive IAk-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes to specifically lyse transfected L cells expressing either Akb1/Ddc2 (17.Golding H. McCluskey J. Munitz T.I. Germain R.N. Margulies D.H. Singer A. Nature. 1985; 317: 425-427Google Scholar) or Aka1/Ddc2 (18.McClusky J. Munitz T. Boyd L. Germain R.N. Coligan J.E. Singer A.

Although these studies show that native individual chains of murine MHC class II containing the transmembrane region are capable of binding peptide and can trigger T cells, no evidence of peptide binding to individual polypeptides of human MHC class II exists. In this report we describe that Escherichia coli expressed individual recombinant α and β polypeptides of human HLA-DR2 (DRB5∗0101) lacking the transmembrane region are capable of binding immunodominant epitopes from MBP. In addition, monomeric complexes of DR2α-Tm and DR2β-Tm chains and MBP peptide can induce antigen-specific apoptosis in cloned T cells to a degree comparable with that of native α/β dimer-peptide complexes. The hybridoma cell line L243, producing monoclonal antibodies against monomorphic human HLA DR molecules, was obtained from American Type Culture Collection, Bethesda, MD. Homozygous lymphoblastoid cell lines, GMO 3107 expressing HLA DR2 and GMO 8067 expressing HLA DR3, were obtained from the National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) human genetic mutant cell repository (Coriell Institute of Medical Research, NJ). Immunopure biotinylated bovine serum albumin containing known amount of biotin molecules was purchased from Pierce Chemicals. Anti-human γ-IFN monoclonal antibody and rabbit anti-human γ-IFN polyclonal antibody were obtained from Endogen, Inc. Peroxidase-conjugated rabbit IgG was purchased from Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories. Human γ-IFN was obtained from Boehringer Mannheim. 3,3′,5,5′-Tetramethyl benzidine was obtained from Moss, Inc. Cloning and expression of α-Tm and β-Tm of DR2 (DRB5*0101) in E. coli were described in our earlier report(19.Arimilli S. Cardoso C. Mukku P.V. Baichwal V. Nag B. J Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 971-977Google Scholar). Briefly, the plasmids p329129 and p33425 expressing DR2α-Tm and DR2β-Tm chains were transfected into the E. coli expression host W3310/DE3. Cultures were grown at 37°C in L-broth containing 0.4% glucose, 100 μg/ml ampicillin, and 15 μg/ml tetracycline. Cells were induced in mid-log growth by addition of isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.4 mM and were harvested for inclusion body preparations. The detailed procedure for the purification of α and β chains lacking the transmembrane region from E. coli inclusion body preparations has been described recently(20.Nag B. Arimilli S. Koukis B. Rhodes E. Baichwal V. Sharma S.D J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10061-10070Google Scholar). Briefly, the α chain E. coli inclusion bodies were solubilized in 25 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 8 M urea and 20 mM dithiothreitol and purified by ion-exchange chromatography using High Q-50 resin (Bio-Rad). The recombinant β chain was purified by one-step gel filtration chromatography using Sephacryl S-100 resin packed in an Pharmacia XK50 (2.5-cm diameter × 100-cm height) column. Both α and β chain fractions were collected and analyzed by SDS-gel electrophoresis using LabLogix silver staining kit (Belmont, CA). Individually pooled α and β chains showed purity levels greater than 95% with recovery of 52 and 86%, respectively. Purification of HLA DR2 from Epstein-Barr virus transformed lymphoblastoid cells was carried out as described earlier (21.Nag B. Wada H.G. Passmore D. Clark B.R. Sharma S.D. McConnell H.M. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 1358-1364Google Scholar) with some minor modifications. Triton X-100 cell lysate was applied onto L243 coupled Sepharose-4B column, and the bound DR2 was eluted in phosphate buffer containing 0.05% n-dodecyl β-D-maltoside detergent at pH 11.3. Fractions were immediately neutralized with 1 M acetic acid, and the DR2 pool was collected through a DEAE ion-exchange column in a phosphate buffer containing 0.5 M NaCl and 0.05% n-dodecyl β-D-maltoside, pH 6.0. Purified protein was then filtered through a 180-kDa membrane, dialyzed against PBS for 24 h at 4°C, and characterized by 13.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by silver staining. Affinity-purified HLA DR3 was obtained by similar method in 0.01% Tween 80 detergent. The N-acetylated myelin basic protein peptide analogs MBP-(83-102)Y83 with the sequence Ac-YDENPVVHFFKNIVTPRTPP, MBP-(124-143) peptide with the sequence Ac-GFGYGGRASDYKSAHKGFKG, and MBP-(1-14) with the sequence Ac-ASQKRPSQRHGSKY were synthesized by the standard solid phase method using side chain protected Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) amino acids on an Applied Biosystems 431A automated peptide synthesizer. The deprotected, crude peptides were purified by reverse-phase HPLC, and the homogeneity and identity of the purified peptides were confirmed by mass spectrometry. Biotinylation of various peptides was carried out as described previously(22.Nag B. Mukku P.V. Arimilli S. Phan D. Deshpande S.V. Winkelhake J.L. Mol. Immunol. 1994; 31: 1161-1168Google Scholar). For the synthesis of carboxyfluoresceinated MBP-(83-102)Y83 (CF-MBP-(83-102)Y83) peptide, 220 mg of 6-carboxyfluorescein (Molecular Probes) was dissolved in 10 ml of dimethylformamide, and 0.12 mmol of peptide resin was added to this solution. After mixing the suspension for 1 min, 75 μl of diisopropylcarbodiimide was added, followed by gently mixing the slurry at room temperature for 2 h. The resin was then filtered and washed with dimethylformamide and methanol alternately, followed by washing with dichloromethane and vacuum drying for 2 h. The modified peptide was cleaved from the resin by suspending the resin in 10 ml of trifluoroacetic acid containing 0.7 g of 4-methylmercaptophenol and 1 ml of 4-methoxybenzenethiol. After 2 h, the resin was separated by filtration, and the filtrate was collected in 1 liter of pentane:acetone (8:1, v/v) mixture. The precipitated CF-peptide was separated by decantation and centrifugation and washed with pentane/acetone followed by pentane. Crude peptide was purified by reverse-phase HPLC using C18 column (Vydac, CA) with acetonitrile gradient (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water to 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in 70% aqueous acetonitrile) and characterized by mass spectroscopy. For the quantitative detection of bound peptide, affinity-purified HLA-DR2 at a concentration of 2 μg/ml was incubated with biotinylated MBP peptides at 37°C for 96 h at optimized pH. The resulting complex preparations were analyzed by antibody capture plate assay using an enzyme-conjugated avidin system as described recently (7.Mukku P.V. Passmore D. Phan D. Nag B. Mol. Immunol. 1995; 32: 555-564Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, purified polyclonal antibodies against HLA-DR2, DR2α-Tm chain, and DR2β-Tm chain at a concentration of 20 μg/ml were immobilized in a 96-well microtiter plate. Bovine serum albumin-biotin with 8 biotin molecules per bovine serum albumin was used as a standard with a concentration range of 0.014-1.8 pmol (0.117-15 ng). The bound biotinylated peptide in complex preparations were detected colorimetrically using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated streptavidin and p-nitrophenyl phosphate in 0.1 M diethanolamine as a substrate. Stability of single chain-peptide complexes was measured by SDS-polyacrylamide gel analysis of various complexes prepared with radioiodinated MBP peptide. Complexes of HLA-DR2 and 125I-MBP peptides were prepared under optimized binding conditions and purified from unbound peptide by G-75 size exclusion gel filtration chromatography. Resulting complexes were then incubated at 4 and 37°C, and at various time points complex samples were removed and frozen at −20°C. At the end of 72 h, the complexes were applied on 13.5% SDS gels under nonreduced conditions. Gels were stained, dried, and autoradiographed. Each lane containing the αβ dimer, α-Tm, or β-Tm polypeptide chain was cut and counted in a γ counter. Solutions of 5 μM α-Tm or β-Tm and 50-fold molar excess of CF-MBP-(83-102)Y83 peptide in PBS buffer, pH 9, were incubated at 37°C for 72 h. Complexes were purified from the excess of peptide by SE-HPLC using a Toso Haas TSK SW3000 column (0.75 × 60 cm) at the flow rate of 0.5 ml/min in PBS buffer at pH 9. The protein fraction has been collected from 20 to 40 ml, concentrated using a Centricon-10 microconcentrator (10-kDa cut-off membrane), and then analyzed by size-exclusion HPLC using the same column connected to UV diode array and fluorescence detectors in series. Two signals have been collected for each SE-HPLC chromatogram: fluorescence with excitation wavelength of 448 nm and emission wavelength of 525 nm and a UV signal at 278 nm. The fluorescence signal was used to measure the bound peptide, and the UV detection was used to calculate the protein concentration. The herpes saimiri virus-transformed SS8T human T cell clone restricted to DR2 (DRB5∗0101) and MBP-(84-102) was cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 2 mML-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone) and 50 units/ml human recombinant IL-2 (rIL-2) at 37°C. Every alternate day cells were transferred to fresh media. Various complex preparations were incubated in a microtiter tissue culture plate at a density of 20,000 cells/200 μl/well in the absence of rIL-2. After 48 h of incubation at 37°C, the supernatants were collected from each well to test for the increase in γ-IFN cytokine level. The detection of γ-IFN levels was performed by antibody enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as described recently(19.Arimilli S. Cardoso C. Mukku P.V. Baichwal V. Nag B. J Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 971-977Google Scholar). The quantitative detection of DNA strand break was performed by end labeling of 3′-OH end of fragmented DNA using biotinylated dUTP followed by a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated avidin detection system in a flow cytometer as described earlier with some modifications(23.Gorczyca W. Bigman K. Mittelman A. Ahmed T. Gong J. Melamed M. Darzynkiewicz Z. Leukemia. 1993; 7: 659-670Google Scholar). Briefly, the transformed SS8T cloned T cells at a density of 1 × 106 cells/ml were incubated with equimolar amounts of DR2 dimer-peptide or chain-peptide complex preparations. Cells were fixed in 1% buffered formaldehyde and stored at −20°C in 70% ethanol. Cells were rehydrated in Hanks' balanced salt solution and resuspended in 50 μl of terminal deoxynucleoside transferase reaction mixture containing 10 μl of terminal deoxynucleoside transferase buffer (1 M potassium cacodylate, 125 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.6, 1.25 mg/ml bovine serum albumin), 0.2 μl terminal deoxynucleotide transferase, 5 μl of CoCl2, and 0.5 nmol of biotin-16-dUTP. The reaction mixture was incubated at 37°C for 30 min, and cells were rinsed in Hanks' balanced salt solution and resuspended in 100 μl of staining solution containing 2.5 μg/ml fluorescein isothiocyanate-avidin in saline sodium citrate buffer. Cells were incubated for an additional 30 min at room temperature in the dark and resuspended in 1 ml of Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 5 μg/ml propidium iodide in the presence of 0.1% RNase. Double fluorescence measurements were carried out in Becton-Dickinson flow cytometer using LYSYS II software. SS8T cells at a density of 2 × 106 cells/ml were incubated with 50 μg/ml of freshly prepared native DR2-MBP-(83-102)Y83 complexes or 25 μg/ml of DR2α-MBP-(83-102)Y83 or DR2β-MBP-(83-102)Y83 complexes at 37°C for 18 h. T cells were fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, at 25°C for 2 h. Following a rinse in the buffer, cells were post fixed in 1% osmium tetraoxide at 25°C for 1 hour. Cells were then dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol, treated with propylene oxide, embedded in a quick-mix epoxy resin, and polymerized at 60°C for 16 h. The sample blocks were thin-sectioned with a diamond knife and sections were stained with 2% uranyl acetate in the presence of 0.4% lead citrate. Cells were characterized using JEOL-100CX TEM at an accelerating voltage of 80 kV. MHC class II molecules consist of two individual polypeptide chains (an α and a β) of similar size that are noncovalently associated with each other. Recently reported crystal structure of MHC class II molecules shows that the extracellular α1 and β1 domains are involved in creating the peptide binding domain that can accommodate peptides of varied length(11.Brown J.H. Jardetzky T.S. Gorga J.C. Stern L.J. Urban. R.G. Strominger J.L. Wiley D.C. Nature. 1993; 364: 33-39Google Scholar, 12.Stern L.J. Brown J.H. Jardetzky T.S. Gorga J.C. Urban R.G. Strominger J.L. Wiley D.C. Nature. 1994; 368: 215-221Google Scholar, 13.Stern L.J. Wiley D.C. Structure. 1994; 2: 245-251Google Scholar). In the heterodimeric structure, it has been shown that the electrophoretically resolved α and β chains independently bind the same peptides, although the two chains may or may not bind identical amino acid residues in the peptides(14.Rothenhausler B. Dornmair K. McConnell H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 352-354Google Scholar, 24.Dornmair K. Rothenhausler B. McConnell H.M. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1989; 54: 409-416Google Scholar). In our previous reports, we demonstrated that electroeluted purified α and β chains of murine MHC class II polypeptides can bind antigenic peptides like the native heterodimer, and equimolar amounts of single chain-peptide complexes can trigger T cell response as measured by a sensor-based assay(15.Passmore D. Kopa D. Nag B. J. Immunol. Methods. 1992; 155: 193-200Google Scholar, 16.Nag B. Wada H.G. Deshpande S.V. Passmore D. Kendrick T. Sharma S.D. Clark B.R. McConnell H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 87: 352-354Google Scholar, 25.Nag B. Wada H.G. Fok K.S. Green. D.J. Sharma S.D. Clark B.R. Parce J.W. McConnell H.M. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 2040-2044Google Scholar). The limited availability of purified native chains by the tedious electroelution method led us to investigate recombinant MHC class II chains for further studies. In this report we describe our successful effort to demonstrate that (i) E. coli expressed individual α and β polypeptide chains of human MHC class II (HLA-DR2) lacking the transmembrane region are equally capable of binding an immunodominant epitope from myelin basic protein (MBP-(83-102)Y83) and (ii) complexes of DR2α-MBP-(83-102)Y83 and DR2β-MBP-(83-102)Y83 can induce antigen-specific apoptosis in restricted cloned T cells. The selection of human HLA-DR2 antigen is based on its predominant involvement in the autoimmune disorder multiple sclerosis (MS)(26.Dalton T.A. Bennet J.C. Am. J. Med. 1992; 92: 183-188Google Scholar). Similarly, the peptide of MBP (MBP-(84-102)) used in this study is considered a major immunodominant epitope for human MS(27.Wucherpfennig K.W. Sette A. Southwood S. Oseroff C. Matsui M. Strominger J.L. Hafler D.A. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 279-290Google Scholar). The peptide analog of MBP used in our study contains a tyrosine residue at position 83 and was found to have increased binding affinity to HLA-DR2 without loss of TCR recognition. 2P. Mukku, S. Arimilli, I. Astafieva, and B. Nag, unpublished results. The increased binding of N terminus tyrosine containing peptide was also observed in several other MHC class II-peptide complexes. 3B. Nag, S. Arimilli, P. V. Mukku, and I. Astafieva, unpublished results. The cloning and expression of human HLA-DR2 α-Tm and β-Tm was carried out as described recently(19.Arimilli S. Cardoso C. Mukku P.V. Baichwal V. Nag B. J Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 971-977Google Scholar). The expression of recombinant individual α and β chain of HLA-DR2 represent 30% of the total cell protein. In contrast to individual α and β polypeptide chain, the recombinant expression of heterodimeric MHC class II molecules in E. coli was totally unsuccessful. The insoluble denatured inclusion body preparations were solubilized in 8 M urea, purified in a scale of 50-100 mg by conventional chromatography methods as described earlier(20.Nag B. Arimilli S. Koukis B. Rhodes E. Baichwal V. Sharma S.D J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10061-10070Google Scholar), and stored in PBS containing an 8 M urea solution. Prior to peptide loading, the α and β chains were dialyzed against PBS buffer. Binding of various biotinylated MBP peptides to purified α and β polypeptide chains were carried out by antibody captured plate assay using chain-specific rabbit polyclonal antibodies and enzyme-conjugated streptavidin as described recently(7.Mukku P.V. Passmore D. Phan D. Nag B. Mol. Immunol. 1995; 32: 555-564Google Scholar). The optimum pH for maximum peptide occupancy was measured by incubating a known amount of each chain with 50-fold molar excess of MBP peptides. Three MBP peptides were selected for the optimization of peptide binding to individual chains. Their affinities toward HLA-DR2 have been shown in the order of MBP-(84-102) > MBP-(124-143) > MBP-(1-14) (28.Valli A. Sette A. Kappos L. Oseroff C. Sidney J. Miescher G. Hochberger M. Albert E.D. Adorini L. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 616-628Google Scholar). The epitope MBP-(1-14) had no affinity toward HLA-DR2 and was used as a negative control. As shown in Fig. 1, the binding of MBP-(83-102)Y83 peptide to both α and β chain was maximum at pH 9.0. In contrast, the binding of MBP-(83-102)Y83 peptide to native DR2 heterodimer was found to be maximum at acidic pH(7.Mukku P.V. Passmore D. Phan D. Nag B. Mol. Immunol. 1995; 32: 555-564Google Scholar). In case of the α chain, the binding pH consistently appears to be critical below or above pH 9. The second high binding epitope of MBP, (MBP-(124-143)) bound strongly to the β chain at basic pH and weakly to the α chain. Further increase in peptide concentration beyond 50-fold molar excess as well as increase in incubation period did not provide additional binding (data not shown). In negative controls, the MBP-(1-14) peptide did not bind to either the α or β chain like the native αβ DR2 heterodimer. Although the maximum binding of the MBP peptide to each individual chain was at pH 9.0, a significant amount of peptide remained bound at around physiological pH between 7 and 8. The specificity of the binding of MBP-(83-102)Y83 peptide to individual α and β chain was demonstrated in a competitive binding experiment. Purified α or β chain was incubated with 50-fold molar excess of biotinylated MBP-(83-102)Y83 peptide in the presence of increasing concentration of nonbiotinylated MBP-(83-102)Y83 or MBP-(124-143) peptide. As shown in Fig. 1, C and D, the binding of biotinylated MBP-(83-102)Y83 peptide was 75-80% inhibited at 2-4-fold excess concentration of nonbiotinylated MBP-(83-102)Y83 peptide. The binding of biotinylated MBP-(83-102)Y83 peptide to chains was partially inhibited by MBP-(124-143) peptide. In other words, the MBP-(83-102)Y83 peptide appears to be more inhibitory than MBP-(124-143) peptide, which correlates with their affinities to DR2 (28.Valli A. Sette A. Kappos L. Oseroff C. Sidney J. Miescher G. Hochberger M. Albert E.D. Adorini L. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 616-628Google Scholar). The stability of the bound peptide in complexes of α-MBP-(83-102)Y83 and β-MBP-(83-102)Y83 was examined using 125I-labeled MBP-(83-102)Y83 peptide in SDS-gel electrophoresis under nonreduced conditions. Complexes of native DR2 heterodimer, DR2α and DR2β, with 125I-MBP-(83-102)Y83 peptide were prepared under fully optimized binding conditions and purified from unbound labeled peptide by G-75 gel filtration chromatography. The stability of three complexes was then monitored at 4 and 37°C for 72 h. As shown in Fig. 2, the bound 125I-MBP-(83-102)Y83 peptide remained associated with both α and β chains like the native αβ DR2 heterodimer. Further characterization of single chain-peptide complexes with respect to aggregation level was performed by size-exclusion HPLC analysis. Although the recombinant α and β polypeptide chains used in our study lack the hydrophobic transmembrane region, due to inclusion body preparation of these polypeptides in E. coli, purified proteins tend to aggregate in solution in the absence of denaturing agent. The HPLC result presented in Fig. 3D shows that, prior to the peptide loading, almost all of β polypeptide preparation appeared in the aggregated state (600 kDa). In contrast, most of the α polypeptide appears to be in a state of α-α homodimers (60 kDa) as shown in Fig. 3A. The existence of α-α and β-β homodimers in purified native polypeptide chains was also observed in our earlier studies(15.Passmore D. Kopa D. Nag B. J. Immunol. Methods. 1992; 155: 193-200Google Scholar, 16.Nag B. Wada H.G. Deshpande S.V. Passmore D. Kendrick T. Sharma S.D. Clark B.R. McConnell H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 87: 352-354Google Scholar). Upon peptide binding, however, a significant amount of purified complexes of both α and β chain-peptide shifted to the monomeric state with a molecular size of ∼30 kDa (Fig. 3, B and E). In these experiments, carboxyfluorescein labeled MBP-(83-102)Y83 peptide was used to monitor the bound peptide associated with various molecular size protein fractions. Results presented in Fig. 3, C and F, show that almost no fluorescence intensity was associated with highly aggregated proteins or with homodimers. In fact, the fluorescence intensity was only found to be associated with the monomeric form of both α- and β-MBP-(83-102)Y83 peptide complexes. These results clearly demonstrate that bound peptide prevents aggregation of purified chains. Such prevention of aggregation of MHC class II dimers on cell surface by peptide binding has been reported recently(29.Germain R.N. Rinker Jr A.G. Nature. 1993; 363: 725-728Google Scholar). Similarly, in a separate study we have observed that bound peptide significantly inhibits aggregation of purified MHC class II heterodimers in solution. 4P. Mukku, I. Astafieva, S. Arimilli, and B. Nag, unpublished results. Calculated percent aggregation and associated bound peptide by size-exclusion HPLC of individual chains and their complexes are also presented in Fig. 3. The molar percent of total bound peptide data observed with CF-MBP-(83-102)Y83 peptide in HPLC experiment correlates well with the biotinylated peptide binding results obtained with the antibody captured plate assay. The recognition of α- and β-MBP-(83-102)Y83 peptide complexes by TCR was performed using herpes saimiri virus-transformed SS8T cloned T cells. The SS8T cell clone was generated from an MS patient and was fully characterized for its restriction to HLA-DR2 (DRB5∗0101) and MBP-(84-102) peptide(30.Weber F. Meinl E. Drexler K. Czlonkowska A. Huber S. Fickencher H. Fleckenstein M. Fleckenstein B. Wekerle H. Hohlfeld R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11049-11053Google Scholar). The TCR engagement by soluble α- and β-MBP-(83-102)Y83 peptide complexes was monitored by an increase in γ-IFN cytokine in a dose-dependent manner. Such increase in γ-IFN production by T cells was correlated with the occupancy of TCRs on the surface of T cells in an earlier study (30.Weber F. Meinl E. Drexler K. Czlonkowska A. Huber S. Fickencher H. Fleckenstein M. Fleckenstein B. Wekerle H. Hohlfeld R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11049-11053Google Scholar) and was adopted for SS8T cells in our laboratory(19.Arimilli S. Cardoso C. Mukku P.V. Baichwal V. Nag B. J Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 971-977Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, specific increase in γ-IFN was observed when SS8T cells were exposed to complexes of native DR2, α or β polypeptide chain with the MBP-(83-102)Y83 peptide. In various control experiments, cells incubated with α or β chain alone and complexes containing irrelevant peptide (α-MBP-(124-143) or β-MBP-(124-143)) did not show any significant increase in γ-IFN level. Human T cells are known to express a low levels of MHC class II molecules on their surfaces and can be stimulated in the presence of antigenic peptide(31.Pichler W. Wyss-Coray T. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 312-315Google Scholar, 32.Lanzavecchia N. Roosnek E. Gregory T. Berman P. Abrignan S. Nature. 1988; 334: 530-532Google Scholar). In order to demonstrate that the observed level of increased γ-IFN is not due to the release of bound peptide in the culture medium, the MBP-(83-102)Y83 peptide was complexed with irrelevant HLA-DR3 as a control and showed no increase in γ-IFN level (Fig. 4A). Similarly, in a mock experiment, equivalent amount of MBP-(83-102)Y83 peptide incubated and passed through Sephadex G-75 column under identical purification conditions in the absence of chains, did not show any increase in γ-IFN level (data not shown). Prolonged incubation of SS8T cells with relevant complexes of individual α and β chains led to the induction of apoptosis. Typically apoptosis is characterized by chromatin condensation and is associated with endonuclease activity. The endonuclease activity in apoptotic cells can be demonstrated by cleavage of cellular DNA. The quantitative detection of DNA strand breaks in this study was demonstrated by labeling the 3′-OH end of the fragmented DNA with biotinylated dUTP followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated avidin detection system in a flow cytometer. Induction of apoptosis in T cells by DR2-MBP-(83-102)Y83, α-MBP-(83-102)Y83, and β-MBP-(83-102)Y83 complexes as measured by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis is shown in Fig. 5. In this flow cytometry assay, the DNA degradation is directly related with the biotin-dUTP incorporation and can be utilized in quantitative measurement of apoptosis. Cells incubated with DR2 alone, α chain alone, β chains alone, DR2-MBP-(124-143), α-MBP-(124-143) and β-MBP-(124-143) complexes were used as controls. Minimal incorporation of biotinylated dUTP was observed in various control experiments, whereas T cells incubated with either recombinant α-MBP-(83-102)Y83 or β-MBP-(83-102)Y83 complexes showed approximately 30-35% of the cells labeled with biotinylated dUTP similar to the native DR2-MBP-(83-102)Y83 complexes. The calculated percent T cell apoptosis by relevant chain-peptide complexes with respect to various controls is presented in Fig. 6A. Apoptosis of T cells by chain-peptide complexes appeared to be time-dependent as shown in Fig. 6B.Figure 6:Apoptosis of T cells by chain-peptide complexes. The percent apoptosis of SS8T cells was calculated from the fluorescence-activated cell sorter data using the LYSYS II software. A represents the calculated percent cell death from Fig. 5 along with various controls. B represents percent cell death with time where 1 × 106 T cells/ml were incubated with 50 μg/ml of DR2 complexes or 25 μg/ml of chain-peptide complexes. Cells were analyzed at different time intervals by flow cytometry.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Finally, the chromatin condensation and cell shrinkage characteristics of apoptotic cells were demonstrated by transmission electron microscopy (Fig. 7). As compared with untreated T cells (Fig. 7A), SS8T cells treated with native DR2-MBP-(83-102)Y83 α-MBP-(83-102)Y83, and β-MBP-(83-102)Y83 complexes showed typical apoptotic cells (Fig. 7, B-D). In summary, results presented in this report describe that individual recombinant polypeptide chains of human MHC class II molecules are capable of binding antigenic peptide and that complexes of single-chain peptide can recognize TCR to induce antigen-specific apoptosis in T cells. Furthermore, this study demonstrates that the transmembrane region of human MHC class II molecules are not involved in either peptide binding or TCR recognition. The physiological significance of single chain-peptide complexes is unknown at present and requires further investigation. In a parallel study, we observed that recombinant murine IAsα chain complexed with rat MBP-(90-101) peptide was highly effective in preventing experimental allergic encephalomyelitis in mice, an animal model for human MS. 5B.

The isolated heavy chain rebound both light chains, resulting in the restoration of native properties. Experiments on reconstitution of the isolated heavy chain with LC17 and/or LC20 showed that both light chains were required for folding into the 10 S conformation and thus for the phosphorylation-dependent filament formation of smooth muscle myosin. However, LC17 was not essential for the phosphorylation-dependent regulation of actin-activated ATPase activity and superprecipitation but was required for full regulation. LC17 and phosphorylated LC20 were found to act as activators, and dephosphorylated LC20 was found to act as a repressor of the motor activities of smooth muscle myosin.

LC17 and phosphorylated LC20 were found to act as activators, and dephosphorylated LC20 was found to act as a repressor of the motor activities of smooth muscle myosin. Smooth muscle myosin is composed of two heavy chains, two 20-kDa regulatory light chains (LC20) 1The abbreviations used are: LC2020-kDa regulatory light chainLC1717-kDa essential light chainDTTdithiothreitolHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyLC-deficient myosinisolated myosin heavy chain free from both LC17 and LC20TFPtrifluoperazine. and two 17-kDa essential light chains (LC17). LC20 can be phosphorylated at Ser19 by Ca2+/calmodulin-activated myosin light chain kinase and the phosphorylation regulates the activity (for review see Sellers(19.Sellers J.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1991; 3: 98-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar)) and conformation (for review see Trybus(21.Trybus K.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1991; 3: 105-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar)) of smooth muscle myosin. Dephosphorylated myosin has a low actin-activated ATPase activity and is unable to support the movement of actin filaments in a motility assay or to generate superprecipitation. The phosphorylation of LC20 activates these motor activities. On the other hand, smooth muscle myosin takes on two different conformations, referred to as the 6 and 10 S forms based on their sedimentation coefficients. The 6 S myosin assembles into filaments under physiological ionic conditions, whereas 10 S myosin does not. Dephosphorylated myosin filaments disassemble into 10 S monomers upon addition of ATP, whereas phosphorylated myosin remains in filament form. 20-kDa regulatory light chain 17-kDa essential light chain dithiothreitol high performance liquid chromatography isolated myosin heavy chain free from both LC17 and LC20 trifluoperazine. LC20 has been removed from smooth muscle myosin by an antibody affinity column (Trybus and Lowey, 25.Trybus K.M. Lowey S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16485-16492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and by gel filtration in the presence of trifluoperazine (TFP) (Trybus et al., 22.Trybus K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20819-20822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The removal of LC20 markedly increased the ATPase activity in the absence of actin, thus resulting in a decrease in the actin-activated ATPase activity in comparison with that of native phosphorylated myosin (Trybus et al., 26.Trybus K.M. Waller G.S. Chatman T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 963-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The ability to move actin filaments in a motility assay is also decreased by the removal of LC20 (Trybus et al., 1994). In addition, the LC20-deficient myosin is shown to be unable to fold into the 10 S form (Trybus and Lowey, 1988). Furthermore, an expressed heavy meromyosin lacking LC17 is shown to move actin filaments. The movement is significantly slower than that by control heavy meromyosin but is phosphorylation-dependent (Trybus, 1994). However, the effect of the lack of LC17 on the ATPase activity and conformation of myosin has been unknown. For complete understanding of phosphorylation-dependent regulation of smooth muscle myosin, it is also very important to examine whether LC17 is required for the regulation of actin-activated ATPase activity and of conformation. It has not been possible to remove LC17 completely from smooth muscle myosin (Trybus, 1994). Here we show for the first time that LC17, in addition to LC20, can be completely removed from smooth muscle myosin without denaturation. Reconstitution experiments with the light chains showed that LC17 and phosphorylated LC20 initiated actin-activated ATPase activity and superprecipitation but that dephosphorylated LC20 inhibited them. For the myosin lacking LC17, not only the rate of superprecipitation but also the actin-activated ATPase activity was considerably lower than those for native myosin but were phosphorylation-dependent, indicative of the nonessential nature of LC17 for the phosphorylation-dependent regulation of the motor activities of smooth muscle myosin. However, myosin lacking LC17 could not fold into the 10 S form, indicating the requirement of LC17 for the phosphorylation-dependent conformational transition and filament formation of smooth muscle myosin. Myosin was prepared from porcine aorta smooth muscle as described by Hasegawa et al.(7.Hasegawa Y. Ueno H. Horie K. Morita F. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1988; 103: 15-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 8.Hasegawa Y. Tanahashi K. Morita F. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1990; 108: 909-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), and the prepared myosin was almost completely dephosphorylated. Phosphorylated myosin was prepared as described previously (Katoh et al., 11.Katoh T. Morita F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 233: 123-131Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). LC20 and phosphorylated LC20 were prepared from aorta myosin as described by Katoh and Morita(10.Katoh T. Morita F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2380-2388Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). LC17 was prepared from aorta myosin according to the method of Grand and Perry (6.Grand R.J.A. Perry S.V. Biochem. J. 1983; 211: 267-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) with modifications (Yoshida and Yagi, 32.Yoshida M. Yagi K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1988; 103: 380-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Two LC17 isoforms of aorta myosin were isolated by DE32 (Whatman) ion exchange chromatography in the presence of 8 M urea (Hasegawa et al., 1988). Actin was prepared from rabbit skeletal muscle by the method of Spudich and Watt(20.Spudich J.A. Watt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4866-4871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and purified by Sephacryl S-300HR (Pharmacia LKB) gel filtration (Katoh and Morita, 1995). The concentrations of myosin, actin, LC20, and LC17 were determined from the absorbance at 280 nm using the absorption coefficients of 0.48, 1.1, 0.20, and 0.31 (mg/ml)-1 cm-1, respectively. The concentration of isolated heavy chain (LC-deficient myosin) was determined by the method of Bradford (2.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (207602) Google Scholar) using myosin as a standard. The molecular weights used for myosin, actin, LC20, LC17, and LC-deficient myosin were 500,000, 42,000, 20,000, 17,000, and 426,000, respectively. Myosin (5 mg/ml) was incubated on ice for 1 h in 0.4 M NaCl, 10 mM EDTA, 2 mM EGTA, 10 mM ATP, 10 mM DTT, 5 mM TFP, 0.05% Triton X-100, and 40 mM imidazole (pH 6.8). Ammonium chloride was added to the solution to 4.5 M, and the mixture was further incubated on ice for 20 min. The incubated mixture (0.5 ml) was loaded onto a Sephacryl S-300HR column (1.25 × 12 cm) equilibrated with 4.6 M ammonium chloride, 5 mM EDTA, 2 mM EGTA, 3 mM ATP, 2 mM DTT, 0.5 mM TFP, 0.05% Triton X-100, and 40 mM imidazole (pH 6.8), and the protein was eluted at 0.9 ml/min at 6-7°C. The eluted LC-deficient myosin was immediately passed through a Sephacryl S-300HR spun column at 4°C to exchange its buffer solution for 0.3 or 0.4 M NaCl, 2 mM DTT, and 20 mM imidazole (pH 7.0). The obtained LC-deficient myosin was immediately mixed with LC17 (equimolar mixture of two LC17 isoforms (Katoh et al., 13.Katoh T. Tanahashi K. Hasegawa Y. Morita F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 459-465Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar)) and/or LC20 (2 mol each light chain/mol head) in 0.3 or 0.4 M NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 2 mM DTT, and 20 mM imidazole (pH 7.0) on ice. If necessary, unbound light chains were removed with a Sephacryl S-300HR spun column. The structural state (monomeric or oligomeric state) of LC-deficient myosin or the reconstituted myosin was analyzed by gel filtration HPLC in 0.4 M NaCl and 10 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.0). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was carried out using 10% slab gels under the conditions of Porzio and Pearson(17.Porzio M.A. Pearson A.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 490: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). The gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 or with silver. Gel filtration HPLC was performed at room temperature using a TSKgel G5000PWXL column (7.8 × 300 mm) with a TSK guard column PWXL (6.0 × 40 mm) attached to a Jasco Gulliver series HPLC system. Elution of proteins was carried out at 0.50 ml/min and monitored by absorbance at 225 nm. Myosin conformation (6 or 10 S form) was verified by gel filtration HPLC as described by Trybus and Lowey (1988). The conformation of dephosphorylated or phosphorylated myosin was examined at various concentrations of NaCl. Myosin (0.15-0.19 mg/ml) in 0.15-0.4 M NaCl, 2.6 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM EGTA, 1 mM DTT, and 10 mM imidazole (pH 7.0) was ultracentrifuged for 10 min at 160,000 × g at 4°C (Hitachi CP-100H ultracentrifuge) in the presence or the absence of 0.1 mM ATP. The supernatant was analyzed by gel filtration HPLC at the same NaCl concentration as above with 1 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM EGTA, and 10 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.2) in the presence or the absence of 20 μM ATP. The retention time of myosin was plotted against the NaCl concentration (Fig. 1). The profile of the 6-10 S conformational transition of dephosphorylated myosin was in agreement with that of gizzard dephosphorylated myosin shown by Cole and Yount(4.Cole D.G. Yount R.G. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 6186-6192Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). At 0.24 M NaCl in the presence of ATP, dephosphorylated myosin was still in the 10 S conformation, whereas phosphorylated myosin was in the 6 S conformation. On the basis of these results, the conformation of LC-deficient myosin or the reconstituted myosin was analyzed at 0.24 M NaCl in the presence of ATP. Electron microscopy was performed on a Hitachi H-800 electron microscope operated at 75 kV. For observation of myosin molecules, myosin samples were diluted to 10 μg/ml in 70% glycerol and 0.4 M ammonium acetate, sprayed onto freshly cleaved mica, and rotary-shadowed with platinum at an angle of 6° as described previously (Tyler and Branton, 27.Tyler J.M. Branton D. J. Ultrastruc. Res. 1980; 71: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar; Winkelmann et al., 31.Winkelmann D.A. Lowey S. Press J.L. Cell. 1983; 34: 295-306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). For observation of myosin filaments, 10 μl of each myosin sample (80-90 μg/ml) in 0.12 M NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM ATP, 0.1 mM EGTA, 1 mM DTT, and 20 mM imidazole (pH 7.0) was placed on a glow-discharged collodion carbon-coated copper grid and was negatively stained with 1% uranyl acetate as described by Trybus and Lowey(24.Trybus K.M. Lowey S. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 3007-3019Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). ATPase reaction was carried out with 0.12-0.18 μM myosin in 0.1 M NaCl, 6 mM MgCl2, 1 mM ATP, 0.1 mM EGTA, 1 mM DTT, and 20 mM imidazole (pH 7.0) at 25°C in the presence and the absence of 20 μM actin. Four aliquots were taken at appropriate time intervals for colorimetric determination of inorganic phosphate (Chifflet et al., 3.Chifflet S. Torriglia A. Chiesa R. Tolosa S. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 168: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar; Gonzalez-Romo et al., 5.Gonzalez-Romo P. Sanchez-Nieto S. Gavilanes-Ruiz M. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 235-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Superprecipitation was measured as described previously (Katoh and Morita, 1995). Porcine aorta myosin was depleted of its LC20 and LC17 by the method of Trybus et al.(1994) combined with the method of Wagner and Giniger(28.Wagner P.D. Giniger E. Nature. 1981; 292: 560-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Myosin was incubated with TFP in the presence of EDTA and ATP to dissociate LC20 followed by further incubation at 0°C upon addition of ammonium chloride to 4.5 M to dissociate LC17. The myosin heavy chain was separated from the dissociated light chains by Sephacryl S-300HR gel filtration in the presence of TFP and ammonium chloride. The isolated heavy chain (LC-deficient myosin) was essentially free from both LC20 and LC17 (Fig. 2, lane 2) and could rebind stoichiometric amounts of LC17 and/or LC20 (Fig. 2, lanes 3-5). The structural states of LC-deficient and reconstituted myosins in high salt conditions were examined by electron microscopy. The rotary-shadowed images of the LC-deficient myosin and LC-deficient myosin reconstituted with LC17 alone showed oligomers in addition to monomers (not shown) as reported for LC-deficient skeletal muscle myosin (Lowey et al., 15.Lowey S. Waller G.S. Trybus K.M. Nature. 1993; 365: 454-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). The heads in monomeric LC-deficient myosin appeared to be more rounded and shorter than in native myosin and the two heads in some LC-deficient myosin monomers appeared to cohere. In contrast, the myosins reconstituted with LC20 alone and with both LC20 and LC17 were observed to be predominantly in monomers, and the shapes of their heads appeared to be indistinguishable from that of native myosin (Fig. 3). The observation that the lack of LC20 resulted in the aggregation of myosin molecules was supported by gel filtration HPLC in 0.4 M NaCl (data not shown). The conformations of LC-deficient and reconstituted myosins were examined by gel filtration HPLC in 0.24 M NaCl in the presence of ATP as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Dephosphorylated and phosphorylated myosins remained soluble, existing predominantly as 10 and 6 S monomers, respectively, and could be separated by gel filtration HPLC (Figure 1:, Figure 2:, Figure 3:, Figure 4:, A and B). Most of the LC-deficient myosin and myosins reconstituted with LC17 alone and with dephosphorylated or phosphorylated LC20 alone were pelleted by ultracentrifugation prior to the gel filtration HPLC. These pelleted myosins would be filamentous and unable to fold. Electron microscopy of these myosin samples without ultracentrifugation actually showed the filaments and their aggregates (not shown). The monomers of these myosin species remaining in the supernatant were mainly in the 6 S form (Fig. 4, D-F), but the monomer conformation of LC-deficient myosin was uncertain because of the low concentration of monomers (Fig. 4C). A part of the myosin reconstituted with dephosphorylated LC20 alone was eluted at the time for 10 S myosin (Fig. 4E). However, the 10 S peak fraction showed the LC17 and LC20 bands in approximately equimolar ratio on SDS gel stained with silver (data not shown). The 10 S peak might be due to a very small amount of LC17 remained in the LC-deficient myosin preparation. The myosins reconstituted with both LC17 and dephosphorylated or phosphorylated LC20 were mostly soluble and predominantly in the 10 and 6 S forms, respectively (Fig. 4, G and H), as observed for native myosin (Fig. 4, A and B). Therefore, these results suggest that both LC17 and LC20 are required for the formation of the 10 S conformation and thus for the phosphorylation-dependent 6-10 S conformational transition of smooth muscle myosin. The filament formation of the LC-deficient and reconstituted myosins was examined in 0.12 M NaCl in the presence of ATP. These myosin samples were negatively stained and observed by electron microscopy (data not shown). The LC-deficient myosin and myosin reconstituted with LC17 alone both showed large aggregates of filaments as previously shown for the LC20-deficient gizzard myosin (Trybus and Lowey, 1988). The myosin reconstituted with LC20 alone also showed filaments and their aggregates irrespective of the phosphorylation state of LC20, but the aggregates appeared to be smaller and looser than those of LC-deficient myosin and myosin reconstituted with LC17 alone. The myosin reconstituted with both LC17 and dephosphorylated LC20 showed few, but slightly more, filaments than native dephosphorylated myosin. The myosin reconstituted with both LC17 and phosphorylated LC20 showed many filaments like native phosphorylated myosin. These results suggest that both light chains are required for the phosphorylation-dependent filament formation of smooth muscle myosin. The ATPase activities of the LC-deficient and reconstituted myosins were measured in the absence and the presence of actin (Table 1). The activities of the LC-deficient myosin in the absence and the presence of actin were both as low as those of native dephosphorylated myosin and were increased 4-5-fold upon reconstitution with LC17 alone, indicating that LC17 could activate the ATPase activity. The reconstitution with dephosphorylated LC20 in addition to LC17 decreased the ATPase activity to of that of myosin reconstituted with LC17 alone, irrespective of the presence of actin. When dephosphorylated LC20 was replaced by phosphorylated LC20, the ATPase activity in the absence of actin was still one-half of that of myosin having only LC17 but increased 2-fold in the presence of actin; the levels of activities were comparable with those of native phosphorylated myosin. Therefore, dephosphorylated LC20 strongly inhibited the ATPase activity that had been activated by LC17, irrespective of the presence of actin. Phosphorylated LC20 also inhibited the ATPase activity in the absence of actin but activated it in the presence of actin. Similar effects of LC20 were also observed in the absence of LC17. However, the level of ATPase activity in the presence of actin for myosin having only phosphorylated LC20, as well as that for myosin having only LC17, was considerably lower than those for myosin having both light chains and for native phosphorylated myosin. The activating effects of LC17 and phosphorylated LC20 seemed to be additive for the ATPase activity in the presence of actin, indicating a requirement of both light chains for the generation of full activity. These results suggest that LC17 acts as an activator and dephosphorylated and phosphorylated LC20, a repressor and an activator, respectively, of the actin-activated ATPase of smooth muscle myosin. The reconstitution with both light chains fully restored the phosphorylation-dependent regulation of the actin-activated ATPase activity (Table 1). When the LC-deficient myosin was reconstituted with LC20 alone, the actin-activated ATPase activity of the reconstituted myosin was phosphorylation-dependent. Therefore, LC17 may not be essential for the phosphorylation-dependent regulation of actin-activated ATPase activity. However, the degree of regulation for myosin lacking LC17 (4.5-fold activation by phosphorylation) was considerably lower than that for myosin having both LC20 and LC17 (20-fold activation by phosphorylation). This was mainly due to the low activity of myosin having only phosphorylated LC20 in the presence of actin, and the activity was complemented by LC17. Superprecipitation time courses for the LC-deficient and reconstituted myosins were examined. Superprecipitation was not observed up to 60 min for the LC-deficient myosin, myosin reconstituted with dephosphorylated LC20 alone, that with both LC17 and dephosphorylated LC20, or for native dephosphorylated myosin (Fig. 5, a, c, e, and g). When the LC-deficient myosin was reconstituted with both LC17 and phosphorylated LC20, superprecipitaion occurred quickly after the addition of ATP, as did superprecipitation of acto-native phosphorylated myosin, although the maximum level of superprecipitation for the reconstituted myosin was somewhat lower than that for native phosphorylated myosin (Fig. 5, b and h). When the LC-deficient myosin was reconstituted with phosphorylated LC20 alone, superprecipitation occurred but was considerably slow in comparison with that for native phosphorylated myosin, although the maximum level was even higher than that for native phosphorylated myosin (Fig. 5, f). The results indicate that superprecipitation of actomyosin can be regulated by phosphorylation even if the myosin is depleted of LC17. For the myosin reconstituted with LC17 alone, superprecipitation was observed, but the development was very slow (Fig. 5, d), consistent with a low motility for LC20-deficient myosin (Trybus et al., 1994). The results suggest that superprecipitation is activated by LC17 alone and by phosphorylated LC20 alone but that both light chains are required for full activation. The removal of LC20 from smooth muscle myosin has been reported (Trybus and Lowey, 1988; Trybus et al., 1994), but the removal of LC17 has not until now been achieved. On the other hand, the removal of both regulatory and essential light chains from skeletal muscle myosin has been done by gel filtration in the presence of 4.7 M ammonium chloride (Lowey et al., 23.Trybus K.M. Chatman T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4412-4419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although this method does not dissociate the light chains from smooth muscle myosin (Lowey and Trybus, 14.Lowey S. Trybus K.M. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: 120-127Google Scholar). The stronger interaction of regulatory light chain with the heavy chain in smooth muscle myosin than in skeletal muscle myosin (Trybus and Chatman, 1993) may have prevented the dissociation of the light chains from smooth muscle myosin. In fact, we could dissociate LC17 from smooth muscle myosin in a high concentration of ammonium chloride after the dissociation of LC20 by TFP. The results are consistent with the observations that the essential light chain exchange in skeletal muscle myosin subfragment 1 lacking regulatory light chain occurs more readily than in myosin (Waller and Lowey, 29.Waller G.S. Lowey S. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14368-14373Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and that the essential light chain exchange in desensitized scallop myosin is easier than in intact myosin (Ashiba and Szent-Gyorgyi, 1.Ashiba G. Szent-Gyorgyi A.G. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 6618-6623Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The lack of either LC20 or LC17 made smooth muscle myosin unable to fold into the 10 S form, resulting in the formation of filaments in the presence of ATP (Fig. 4). The impairment of the ability to fold into the 10 S form for myosin lacking LC20 or both light chains might have been due to cohesion of its two heads, as observed for myosin whose two heads were chemically cross-linked (Katoh and Morita, 1995). However, this was not the case for the reconstituted myosin with dephosphorylated LC20 alone because such cohesion of the two heads was not observed for this myosin by electron microscopy. Not only LC20 but also LC17 might be required for the formation of the native structure of the neck region, which is suggested to be involved in the folding into the 10 S form (Katoh et al., 12.Katoh T. Kodama T. Fukushima A. Yazawa M. Morita F. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 118: 428-434Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the 6-10 S conformational transition is modulated by ATP (Fig. 1), suggesting that signals of the binding of ATP to the active site of myosin somehow transmitted to the neck region resulted in the 10 S conformation. Both LC17 and LC20 subunits may mediate such transmission. The removal of regulatory and/or essential light chains from skeletal muscle myosin does not significantly decrease the actin-activated ATPase activity (Pastra-Landis and Lowey, 16.Pastra-Landis S.C. Lowey S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 14811-14816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; Lowey et al., 1993). On the other hand, the lack of these light chains decreases the motility of skeletal muscle myosin, but the isolated heavy chain still moves actin filaments (Lowey et al., 1993). Skeletal muscle myosin is not regulated and is always in the “on” state that corresponds to the phosphorylated state in smooth muscle myosin. In comparison with phosphorylated smooth muscle myosin, the isolated smooth muscle myosin heavy chain showed the actin-activated ATPase activity of less than (Table 1) and no superprecipitation (Fig. 5). Therefore, the skeletal muscle myosin heavy chain may be in the active state, whereas the smooth muscle myosin heavy chain, in contrast, may be in the inactive state. Both LC17 and phosphorylated LC20 are required for smooth muscle myosin to be in the active state (Table 1 and Fig. 5). The role of skeletal myosin light chains is suggested to stabilize the light chain-binding domain as the lever arm for efficient coupling of ATP hydrolysis to motility (Lowey et al., 1993; Waller et al., 30.Waller G.S. Ouyang G. Swafford J. Vibert P. Lowey S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15348-15352Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In contrast, LC17 and phosphorylated LC20 activate not only superprecipitation but also the actin-activated ATPase activity for smooth muscle myosin. Therefore, the smooth muscle myosin light chains have specific functional roles in the generation of motor activities, in addition to the structural role that is suggested for skeletal muscle myosin. On the other hand, LC17 may not be essential for the phosphorylation-dependent regulation of motor activities (Table 1 and Fig. 5), in agreement with the phosphorylation-dependent motility of an expressed gizzard heavy meromyosin lacking LC17 (Trybus, 1994). However, the levels of the motor activities of myosin having only phosphorylated LC20 were still considerably lower than those of myosin having LC17 and phosphorylated LC20 (Table 1 and Fig. 5). Therefore, LC17 may be required for full activation and thus for full regulation of the motor activities of smooth muscle myosin. The three-dimensional structure of the head of skeletal muscle myosin shows that a 10 nm stretch of the α-helical heavy chain segment to which light chains are bound extends near the ATPase and actin-binding sites (Rayment et al., 18.Rayment I. Rypniewski W.R. Schmidt-Base K. Smith R. Tomchick D.R. Benning M.M. Winkelmann D.A. Wesenberg G. Holden H.M. Science. 1993; 261: 50-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (1832) Google Scholar). As the head of smooth muscle myosin probably has a homologous structure, the phosphorylation site may be spatially apart from the ATPase and actin-binding sites. The signals of LC20 phosphorylation should be transmitted to the active site through the light chain-binding domain in each head or through interactions between two heads. In either case, our results suggest that the transmission may be essentially mediated by LC20 to generate the phosphorylation-dependent regulation of motor activities in smooth muscle myosin. In contrast, the regulation of 6-10 S conformational transition through phosphorylation requires both light chains as described above. The phosphorylation-dependent regulation of motor activities is not directly coupled with that of the conformational transition of smooth muscle myosin. Such an uncoupling between regulations in the activity and conformation is also reported by Ikebe et al.(9.Ikebe M. Ikebe R. Kamisoyama H. Reardon S. Schwonek J.P. Sanders II, C.R. Matsuura M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28173-28180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interactions among both light chains and the heavy chain may be required for full regulation of the conformation and motor activities of smooth muscle myosin as suggested for Ca2+-dependent regulation of scallop myosin (Xie et al., 33.Xie X. Harrison D.H. Schlichting I. Sweet R.M. Kalabokis V.N. Szent-Gyorgyi A.G. Cohen C. Nature. 1994; 368: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). To elucidate the mechanisms of the phosphorylation-dependent regulation and thus of the intramolecular signal transmission in smooth muscle myosin, more detailed studies are undoubtedly required, and the method of removing light chains presented in this paper could be an aid for the purpose."

Recent studies have suggested that VP16 also stimulates transcriptional elongation. It has been shown that VP16 can activate transcription tethered downstream of the transcription start site to RNA. Here, we analyze the synergistic activation features of hybrid VP16 fusion proteins when tethered simultaneously to RNA downstream of the start site and to DNA upstream of a promoter in order to investigate its role in postinitiation control of transcription. Upon targeting the VP16 activation domain simultaneously to both DNA and RNA, high levels of transcriptional synergism is observed. Importantly, a transcription-defective VP16 minimal activation domain (amino acids 413-453) mutated at critical residue 442 (phenylalanine → proline) maintained synergism, when bound to RNA, with the DNA-bound wild-type VP16 minimal activation domain. Targeting of this “functionally defective” VP16 minimal activation domain via RNA and an intact activation domain via DNA allowed us to uncover a postinitiation activity for VP16 not previously detected in DNA targeting studies.

https://openalex.org/W2010016290,"We have previously reported that albumin gene transcription is reduced in diabetes mellitus (DM). The present study explored the mechanism by which albumin gene transcription is down-regulated in DM. Deletional studies and displacement of factors binding to site B of the albumin promoter indicated that the repressive effects of DM are mediated by nuclear factors binding to this site. Since hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 (HNF1) activates albumin promoter activity and is the predominant factor binding to site B, we examined HNF1. The abundance and binding activity of HNF1 were reduced in hepatonuclear extracts from diabetic compared to control rats. However, HNF1 mRNA levels were unchanged, suggesting that the effect of DM on HNF1 is at the post-transcriptional level. Extracts from diabetic animals also contained another protein, distinct from HNF1 and vHNF1, which bound to site B in gel retardation studies. In summary, our studies demonstrate that the reduced abundance and binding activity of HNF1 correlates with decreased albumin gene transcription in DM."

Yeast isocitrate dehydrogenase is an octomer composed of two subunits (IDH1 and IDH2) encoded by different genes and possessing independent mitochondrial targeting presequences. Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was used to remove the presequences from each gene and from both genes carried on centromere-based expression plasmids. Effects on cellular localization were examined in a yeast strain containing chromosomal disruptions of IDH1 and IDH2 loci. Each subunit was found to be dependent upon its presequence for mitochondrial localization, and the subunits are independently imported into mitochondria under most growth conditions. Furthermore, an active holoenzyme can be assembled in the cytosol and this “cytosolic” form of isocitrate dehydrogenase can reverse the acetate- growth phenotype characteristic of the ΔIDH1/ΔIDH2 disruption strain, indicating functional replacement of the mitochondrial enzyme. However, transformants containing plasmids lacking either the IDH1 or IDH2 presequence coding regions were unexpectedly found to be capable of growth on acetate medium. Further investigation demonstrated that cellular localization of the IDH1 subunit can be biased by this stringent growth pressure.

Further investigation demonstrated that cellular localization of the IDH1 subunit can be biased by this stringent growth pressure. NAD-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase in eucaryotic organisms is a key enzyme in cellular energy metabolism. The oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate is considered an important control point for flux through the tricarboxylic acid cycle since isocitrate dehydrogenase is a complex oligomeric enzyme subject to extensive allosteric regulation by energy charge(1.Hathaway J.A. Atkinson D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 2875-2881Google Scholar). The active form of isocitrate dehydrogenase in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is an α4β4 octomer with subunits designated IDH1 and IDH2(2.Barnes L.D. Kuehn G.D. Atkinson D.E. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 3939-3944Google Scholar, 3.Keys D.A. McAlister-Henn L. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 4280-4287Google Scholar). The deduced amino acid sequences from the cloned genes and amino-terminal sequence analysis (4.Cupp J.R. McAlister-Henn L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22199-22205Google Scholar, 5.Cupp J.R. McAlister-Henn L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16417-16423Google Scholar) indicate that IDH1 and IDH2 are synthesized as precursors of 360 and 369 amino acids, respectively, and are processed upon mitochondrial import to yield mature polypeptides of 349 and 354 amino acids. IDH1 and IDH2 share 42% residue identity, and both subunits share an approximate 32% residue identity with the NADP-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase of Escherichia coli(6.Thorsness P.E. Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10422-10425Google Scholar). For the latter enzyme, crystallographic analyses to 2.5 Å have been completed(7.Hurley J.H. Dean A.M. Sohl J.L. Koshland Jr., D.E. Stroud R.M. Science. 1990; 249: 1012-1016Google Scholar, 8.Hurley J.H. Dean A.M. Koshland Jr., D.E. Stroud R.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8671-8678Google Scholar). Based on similarity with the procaryotic enzyme, mutagenesis of the putative isocitrate binding sites of the yeast subunits and kinetic analyses led to a model for IDH1 function as a regulatory subunit and IDH2 function in catalysis(9.Cupp J.R. McAlister-Henn L. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9323-9328Google Scholar). The presequences of IDH1 and IDH2 have features characteristic of many mitochondrial presequences(10.Douglas M.G. McCammon M.T. Vasarotti A. Microbiol. Rev. 1986; 50: 166-178Google Scholar, 11.Roise D. Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4509-4511Google Scholar); each contains several positively charged and hydroxylated but no acidic amino acid residues. The presequences of many mitochondrial proteins have been shown to be essential and sufficient for import. Some exceptions include yeast mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase, which has a dispensable presequence (12.Thompson L.M. McAlister-Henn L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12091-12096Google Scholar), and the β subunit of yeast F1-ATPase, which contains redundant import signals, two residing within the presequence and the third within the mature protein(13.Bedwell D.M. Klionsky D.J. Emr S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 294-304Google Scholar). In this report, we examine the requirement for presequences for mitochondrial localization of IDH1 and IDH2 subunits and also examine the independence of import of the two subunits of this multimeric enzyme. Compartmentalization of different metabolic pathways in eucaryotic cells frequently involves isozymes which catalyze similar reactions in different cellular compartments. The two mitochondrial and single cytosolic isozymes of isocitrate dehydrogenase in S. cerevisiae are good examples of this phenomenon. The mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid cycle enzyme is distinguished from the other two homodimeric NADP-specific isozymes (14.Haselbeck R.J. McAlister-Henn L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2339-2345Google Scholar, 15.Loftus T.L. Hall L.V. Anderson S.L. McAlister-Henn L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9661-9667Google Scholar) by cofactor specificity, oligomeric composition, and allosteric sensitivity. Yeast strains containing disruptions in either or both IDH1 and IDH2 chromosomal loci share a dramatic growth phenotype, an inability to grow with acetate as a carbon source(4.Cupp J.R. McAlister-Henn L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22199-22205Google Scholar, 5.Cupp J.R. McAlister-Henn L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16417-16423Google Scholar), with some other tricarboxylic acid cycle mutants including those lacking mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase (16.McAlister-Henn L. Thompson L.M. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 5157-5166Google Scholar) or citrate synthase(17.Kim K. Rosenkrantz M.S. Guarente L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 1936-1942Google Scholar). This phenotype for strains lacking NAD-specific isocitrate dehydrogenase indicates that the residual mitochondrial NADP-specific isocitrate dehydrogenase cannot compensate for tricarboxylic acid cycle function, suggesting that NADH is the essential product of this reaction. In this report, we test whether a catalytically active NAD-specific enzyme can be assembled in the cytosol and whether reducing equivalents produced in that compartment can compensate for loss of the mitochondrial reaction. Yeast strains were grown in liquid cultures or on 2% agar plates containing rich YP medium (1% yeast extract, 2% bactopeptone). All carbon sources were added to a final concentration of 2%. The parental haploid yeast strain used in these studies was S173-6B (MATa leu2-3, 112 his3-1 ura3-52 trp1-289; (18.Botstein D. Falco S.C. Stewart S.E. Brennan M. Scherer S. Stinckcomb D.T. Struhl K. Davis R.W. Gene (Amst.). 1979; 8: 12-24Google Scholar)). The ΔIDH1/ΔIDH2 double disruption strain was constructed with this strain as described previously(5.Cupp J.R. McAlister-Henn L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16417-16423Google Scholar). The lithium acetate protocol (19.Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Google Scholar) was used for yeast transformation. Transformants were selected on agar plates containing minimal YNB medium (0.17% yeast nitrogen base, 0.5% ammonium sulfate, pH 6.0) with appropriate supplements of 20 μg/ml to satisfy auxotrophic requirements for growth. Cell growth was measured spectrophotometrically at A600 nm. DNA manipulation (ligation, amplification, hybridization, etc.) followed standard techniques of Sambrook et al.(20.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Both IDH1 and IDH2 genes were previously subcloned into a multicopy 2-μm expression vector(9.Cupp J.R. McAlister-Henn L. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9323-9328Google Scholar). For the current study, to express the subunits at normal cellular levels, a 3.8-kilobase pair BamHI/HindIII fragment containing both genes was removed from the 2-μm plasmid and subcloned into pRS316, a centromere-based plasmid with a yeast URA3 gene for selection(21.Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Google Scholar). To insure a full-length promoter for the IDH1 gene, it was necessary to restore a BamHI restriction site 100 base pairs 5′ of the coding region for insertion of an adjacent genomic DNA fragment. This involved use of a 24-mer oligonucleotide (5′-TCTAGAGGATCCATTTCAACAGTA) and resulted in a single nucleotide change (T to C at position −98). Introduction of the BamHI restriction site into IDH1 and mutagenesis to remove the mitochondrial targeting presequences of IDH1 and IDH2 were conducted simultaneously. Two 30-mer oligonucleotides complementary to regions flanking the presequence coding regions (5′-ATTGTAAGAGAAAAATGGCCACTGCCGCTC for IDH1 and 5′-AATATTTTTTAATAATGGCTACTGTAAAGC for IDH2) were synthesized for loopout mutagenesis and a 28-mer oligonucleotide (5′-AGGGCGAATTGGCATGCCACCGCGGTGG) to change a SacI restriction site in the multicloning region to an SphI site was synthesized for use as a selective primer. All four mutagenic primers were used in a single synthesis reaction with single stranded template plasmid DNA prepared from the pRS316 plasmid carrying IDH1 and IDH2 genes. The ratio of loopout primers, BamHI primer, and selective primer was 10:2:1. After strand synthesis and transformation of mutS E. coli cells, the mixed plasmid population was subjected to two rounds of amplification and digestion with SacI to eliminate the template plasmid. The final plasmid population was transformed into E. coli strain DH5αF′(22.Raleigh E.A. Murray N.E. Revel H. Blumenthal R.M. Westaway D. Reith A.D. Rigby P.W.J. Elhai J. Hanahan D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 1563-1575Google Scholar). Colony hybridization was used to identify three types of mutant plasmids, all bearing the BamHI restriction site, plus (a) both wild type IDH1 and IDH2 genes, (b) the presequence deleted form of IDH1 with the wild type IDH2 gene, or (c) the presequence deleted form of IDH2 with the wild type IDH1 gene. All mutations were confirmed by nucleotide sequence analysis. A 2.5-kilobase BglII restriction fragment containing the IDH1 promoter region was subcloned from the original genomic isolate (4.Cupp J.R. McAlister-Henn L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22199-22205Google Scholar) into the BamHI site upstream of either the wild type or the presequence deleted form of IDH1, generating plasmids, respectively, designated pIDH1/IDH2 and pδtIDH1/IDH2. The correct orientation of the BglII promoter fragment was confirmed by nucleotide sequence analysis. XbaI restriction fragments from the two plasmids carrying the promoter and IDH1 coding regions were used to replace XbaI fragments in a plasmid bearing the presequence deleted form of IDH2, generating plasmids, respectively, designated pIDH1/δtIDH2 and pδtIDH1/δtIDH2. Yeast whole cell protein extracts were prepared using glass bead lysis as described previously(16.McAlister-Henn L. Thompson L.M. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 5157-5166Google Scholar). Cellular fractionation to produce mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions was performed as described by Daum et al.(23.Daum G. Bohni P.C. Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13028-13033Google Scholar). For enzyme assays and immunoblot analyses, mitochondrial pellets were lysed in a buffer containing 5 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mM EDTA, and 0.5% Tween 20. Isocitrate dehydrogenase activity was measured spectrophotometrically as described previously(3.Keys D.A. McAlister-Henn L. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 4280-4287Google Scholar); units are expressed as micromoles of isocitrate-dependent NAD+ reduction per min/mg of protein. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford dye-binding method(24.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar). For oxygen consumption experiments, mitochondrial pellets were resuspended to 10 mg/ml in a buffer containing 0.65 M mannitol, 10 mM KPO4 (pH 6.5), 10 mM Tris maleate (pH 6.5), 10 mM KCl, and 0.1 mM EDTA. Rates of oxygen consumption were measured with a Clarke-type polarographic oxygen electrode as described by Ohnishi et al.(25.Ohnishi T. Kawaguchi K. Hagihara B. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 1797-1806Google Scholar). State III respiratory rates were measured in the presence of 334 μM ADP with 13.3 mM succinate, citrate, or pyruvate (12.0 mM) plus malate (1.3 mM). All respiratory substrates and ADP solutions were adjusted to pH 6.5. Samples of whole cell or subcellular protein extracts were electrophoresed on 10% polyacrylamide-SDS gels and electrotransferred to polyvinylidene difluoride filters. The filters were incubated as described previously using a 1:500 dilution of anti-yeast IDH1 antiserum(3.Keys D.A. McAlister-Henn L. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 4280-4287Google Scholar), anti-yeast MDH1 antiserum(16.McAlister-Henn L. Thompson L.M. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 5157-5166Google Scholar), or anti-yeast MDH2 antiserum(26.Minard K.I. McAlister-Henn L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 370-380Google Scholar). Detection of immunocomplexes was performed using the enhanced chemiluminescent method and autoradiography. For activity staining of native enzyme, whole cell protein extracts (100 μg) were electrophoresed on 10% polyacrylamide gels and the gels stained for 20-30 min with an isocitrate dehydrogenase activity stain containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 5 mM MgCl2, 5 mM isocitrate, 0.5 mM NAD+, 0.4 mg/ml nitro blue tetrazolium, and 40 μg/ml phenazine methosulfate. Staining was terminated by immersing the gel in 7% acetic acid. Previous work (3.Keys D.A. McAlister-Henn L. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 4280-4287Google Scholar) showed that the active holoenzyme of yeast NAD-specific isocitrate dehydrogenase (molecular weight ≅ 320,000) consists of two electrophoretically distinguishable subunits designated IDH1 and IDH2. Polypeptide identities were established by gene disruptions(4.Cupp J.R. McAlister-Henn L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22199-22205Google Scholar, 5.Cupp J.R. McAlister-Henn L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16417-16423Google Scholar), each of which resulted in loss of activity and in loss of an immunochemically detectable subunit. Direct amino-terminal sequence analysis of each mature subunit plus identification of translation initiator methionine residues in cloned gene sequences gave an 11-residue presequence (MLNRTIAKRTL) for IDH1 and a 15-residue presequence (MLRNTFFRNTSRRFL) for IDH2. The two presequences exhibit some homology and share canonical features of targeting presequences for mitochondrial matrix proteins(10.Douglas M.G. McCammon M.T. Vasarotti A. Microbiol. Rev. 1986; 50: 166-178Google Scholar, 11.Roise D. Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4509-4511Google Scholar). For current studies of localization and function, the IDH1 and IDH2 genes were subcloned into the polylinker site of pRS316(21.Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Google Scholar), a centromere-based plasmid containing a yeast URA3 gene for selection. To determine requirements for mitochondrial localization of the subunits, deletions of the presequence coding regions were constructed by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis as described under “Experimental Procedures.” These deletions preserve the initiator methionine codons and the coding regions for the mature polypeptides. A complete set of four plasmids was constructed by subcloning. These include a plasmid carrying both wild type genes (pIDH1/IDH2), a plasmid carrying both presequence deletions (pδtIDH1/δtIDH2), and plasmids lacking either the IDH1 or IDH2 presequence (pδtIDH1/IDH2 and pIDH1/δtIDH2, respectively). The pRS plasmids were transformed into a haploid yeast strain (ΔIDH1/ΔIDH2) containing a deletion/LEU2 insertion disruption of the IDH1 chromosomal locus and a deletion/HIS3 insertion disruption of the IDH2 chromosomal locus(5.Cupp J.R. McAlister-Henn L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16417-16423Google Scholar). Resulting Ura+ transformants were isolated and cultivated in rich medium with glycerol plus lactate or ethanol, carbon sources permissive for growth of the ΔIDH1/ΔIDH2 disruption mutant. Immunoblot analysis of whole cell protein extracts was conducted to examine plasmid-borne expression of IDH1 and IDH2. As shown in Fig. 1, IDH1 and IDH2 levels are comparable with each other under both growth conditions in extracts from transformants expressing both wild type genes (pIDH1/IDH2, lanes 1) or the IDH2 presequence deletion gene (pIDH1/δtIDH2, lanes 3). This is also true for transformants expressing both presequence deleted genes (pδtIDH1/δtIDH2, lanes 4) but overall cellular levels of both subunits are approximately 50% lower than wild type. In contrast, levels of IDH1 are reduced relative to IDH2 in transformants expressing the IDH1 presequence deletion gene (pδtIDH1/IDH2, lanes 2); in fact, long exposure times are necessary to visualize IDH1 in extracts from the ethanol-grown transformant. No larger forms of IDH1 or IDH2 are immunochemically detectable in any of the samples, indicating no accumulation of precursor forms of either subunit. Enzyme assays of the whole cell extracts (Table 1, A) show measurable IDH activity in the pIDH1/IDH2 transformant (the levels are approximately 2-fold higher than those measured for the parental strain) and in the pδtIDH1/δtIDH2 transformant with both carbon sources. No activity was measurable for the pIDH1/δtIDH2 transformant despite the presence of both subunits, suggesting that the subunits may be localized in different cellular compartments preventing formation of the holoenzyme in vivo. This result, along with mixing experiments performed with extracts from ΔIDH1 and ΔIDH2 disruption mutants, also indicates that assembly of holoenzyme does not occur in vitro under these conditions. Traces of activity with glycerol plus lactate and with ethanol were detected in the pδtIDH1/IDH2 transformant, perhaps due to differential localization or simply to low cellular levels of IDH1 (cf. Fig. 1, lanes 2).Tabled 1 In another sensitive test for formation of holoenzyme, the whole cell extracts from glycerol/lactate-grown transformants were electrophoresed on a nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel and the gel treated with an IDH activity stain as described under “Experimental Procedures” (Fig. 2A). With this method, a trace of IDH activity, relative to strong staining for the extracts from pIDH1/IDH2 and pδtIDH1/δtIDH2 transformants (lanes 1 and 4, respectively), is detected in the extract from the pδtIDH1/IDH2 transformant (lane 2). Again, no activity is observed for the pIDH1/δtIDH2 transformant (lane 3). Importantly, the activity stains indicate similar electrophoretic mobilities suggesting formation of native, presumably octomeric, holoenzyme in three types of transformants. Similar patterns of relative expression were obtained for transformants grown on glucose (data not shown), which is also a permissive carbon source; however, overall immunochemical levels and activities were 3-5-fold lower due to glucose repression of IDH subunit levels (27.Haselbeck R.J. McAlister-Henn L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12116-12122Google Scholar). To determine the effects of presequence deletions on localization, cellular fractionation was conducted as described under “Experimental Procedures” to produce cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions from the four types of transformants cultured in rich medium with glycerol plus lactate as the carbon source. Immunoblot analysis (Fig. 3) demonstrates predominant mitochondrial localization of IDH1 and IDH2 in the transformant carrying pIDH1/IDH2 (lanes 1). In the pδtIDH1/IDH2 transformant (lanes 2), normal levels of the processed IDH2 subunit are detected in mitochondria whereas IDH1 is undetectable in either fraction. This is generally consistent with immunoblot analysis of whole cell extracts (cf. Fig. 1) and suggests that mislocalization of IDH1 to the cytosol may result in instability and degradation. In the pIDH1/δtIDH2 transformant (lanes 3), IDH2 is present in the cytosolic fraction and appears to be stably expressed in that compartment; the IDH1 subunit is mitochondrial, confirming that the absence of IDH activity in this transformant is due to differential compartmentation of the subunits. In the transformant containing pδtIDH1/δtIDH2 (lanes 4), IDH1 and IDH2 subunits are both found in the cytosolic fraction. The efficiency of cellular fractionation in these experiments is demonstrated by immunochemical blots of mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase (MDH1) and of cytosolic malate dehydrogenase (MDH2). Similar immunochemical fractionation patterns for IDH1 and IDH2 were obtained with ethanol- and glucose-grown transformants (data not shown). Collectively, these data suggest that the presequences of IDH1 and of IDH2 are essential for localization of each subunit to mitochondria and that IDH2 alone but not IDH1 alone can be stably expressed in the cytosol. Since deletion of both presequences results in cytosolic localization of IDH1 and IDH2, the ability of the subunits to assemble to form an active enzyme in this compartment was examined by measuring IDH activity in the cellular fractions (Table 2, A). In both the parental strain and in the transformant carrying pIDH1/IDH2, IDH activity is exclusively mitochondrial. In these strains, mitochondrial specific activities exceed cellular specific activities by 20-fold with growth on glycerol/lactate and by approximately 3-fold with growth on ethanol. The trace of IDH activity detected in the pδtIDH1/IDH2 transformant also appears to be associated with the mitochondrial fraction, despite our inability to detect IDH1 in that fraction with immunoblots. No measurable activity was detected in transformants containing pIDH1/δtIDH2, as expected with localization of subunits in different cellular compartments. The IDH activity in the pδtIDH1/δtIDH2 transformant grown on either carbon source is exclusively found in cytosolic fractions, indicating that an active holoenzyme can be assembled from the mature subunits localized in the cytosol. The lower specific activity of the enzyme in the cytosol relative to whole cell extracts is believed to be due to dilution of the enzyme into a larger cellular compartment and to some loss in yield during fractionation.Tabled 1 Cellular fractionation experiments indicate that no holoenzyme is present in mitochondria from pIDH1/δtIDH2 or pδtIDH1/δtIDH2 transformants. As an additional physiological test, relative respiratory rates, measured as oxygen consumption with various oxidative substrates, were determined with mitochondria prepared from transformants as well as from parental and ΔIDH1/ΔIDH2 disruption strains. As shown in Table 3, and as previously reported(27.Haselbeck R.J. McAlister-Henn L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12116-12122Google Scholar), mitochondria from strains containing ΔIDH1 and/or ΔIDH2 gene disruptions are characterized by an inability to use citrate as a respiratory substrate, whereas pyruvate plus malate and succinate are adequate substrates. Mitochondria from pIDH1/δtIDH2 and pδtIDH1/δtIDH2 transformants are similarly deficient, indicative of the absence of IDH holoenzyme in these organelles. Mitochondria from the pδtIDH1/IDH2 transformant, however, retain some capacity for oxygen consumption with citrate, again providing evidence for residual activity in these mitochondria despite the immunochemical absence of IDH1.Tabled 1 Disruption of either or both IDH genes results in an inability to grow on rich medium with acetate as a carbon source(4.Cupp J.R. McAlister-Henn L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22199-22205Google Scholar, 5.Cupp J.R. McAlister-Henn L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16417-16423Google Scholar), a characteristic growth phenotype of several yeast tricarboxylic acid cycle mutants. This phenotype, plus the demonstrated formation of an active cytosolic form of IDH allows determination of the extent of compensatory function of the cytosolic enzyme in the tricarboxylic acid cycle. An initial test compared growth of various strains on YP acetate plates (data not shown). The single (ΔIDH1 and ΔIDH2) and double (ΔIDH1/ΔIDH2) disruption strains fail to grow while the parental and pIDH1/IDH2 transformant grow well on these plates. The pδtIDH1/δtIDH2 transformant also grows on YP acetate, suggesting that the active cytosolic form of IDH is competent to reverse the acetate- growth phenotype. Unexpectedly, transformants containing either pδtIDH1/IDH2 or pIDH1/δtIDH2, which were, respectively, found to have very low or no IDH activity on permissive carbon sources, were also found to grow on acetate plates. This suggested there may be some differences in expression and/or compartmental localization of IDH1 and IDH2 subunits when the latter transformants are cultured on acetate. To better evaluate phenotypic changes conferred by IDH expression, liquid culture growth rates were measured. As shown in Table 4, all four transformant strains as well as the disruption strain grew well with ethanol as a permissive carbon source, with cell doubling times ranging from 5.3 to 6.4 h. With acetate, which is non-permissive for the disruption strain, culture doubling times for the transformants ranged from 6.0 to 12.0 h. Based on these growth rate values, the cytosolic form of IDH does permit growth of the pδtIDH1/δtIDH2 transformant on acetate but does not completely restore parental rates of growth. Growth of the pδtIDH1/IDH2 and pIDH1/δtIDH2 transformants on acetate suggested formation of active enzyme in these strains and this was confirmed by enzyme assays (Table 1, B) and electrophoretic staining (Fig. 2B) conducted with the whole cell extracts.Tabled 1 To determine the basis for growth on acetate, cellular fractionation was conducted to define the cellular localization of IDH subunits and activity in acetate-grown transformants. Immunochemical analysis (Fig. 4) demonstrates that for acetate-grown transformants carrying pIDH1/IDH2 (lanes 1) or pδtIDH1/δtIDH2 (lanes 4), localization of both subunits is similar to that previously observed with glycerol/lactate or ethanol, i.e. mitochondrial in the former and cytosolic in the latter. The relative specific activities for cellular fractions from these transformants (Table 2, B) demonstrate compartmental distribution of activity compatible with co-localization of the subunits. In the acetate-grown pδtIDH1/IDH2 transformant, IDH2 is primarily mitochondrial (lanes 2) as previously observed; however, significant levels of IDH1 are now detectable in the mitochondrial fraction. A significant enrichment in mitochondrial specific activity is also apparent (Table 2, B), suggesting that formation of a mitochondrial holoenzyme accounts for growth of this transformant on acetate. In the acetate-grown pIDH1/δtIDH2 transformant, the presequence-deleted form of IDH2 is primarily cytosolic (lanes 3), as previously observed with glycerol/lactate; however, IDH1 levels in the mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions now appear to be equivalent. Co-localization of IDH1 and IDH2 in the cytosol and the enrichment in IDH specific activity in that compartment (Table 2) suggest that it is formation of a holoenzyme in the cytosol which supports growth of this transformant on acetate. Mitochondria isolated from acetate-grown transformants containing pIDH1/δtIDH2 or pδtIDH1/δtIDH2 were also found to be unable to utilize citrate as a respiratory substrate (values in parentheses in Table 3), supportive of primary cytosolic localization of the holoenzyme in these strains. In this study we have examined the structural requirements for localization and assembly of the subunits of a multimeric mitochondrial enzyme. The factors which determine localization of the IDH1 and IDH2 subunits of yeast mitochondrial NAD-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase appear to be quite different. For IDH2, irrespective of growth conditions, the presence or absence of its mitochondrial targeting presequence appears to be the single determinant for respective mitochondrial or cytosolic localization. The subunit is stably expressed to similar cellular levels in either compartment. For IDH1, localization and stability are affected by the presence or absence of its presequence; however, other important factors appear to be growth conditions and the compartmental location of IDH2. In acetate-grown cells, for example, IDH1 is mitochondrial even in the absence of its presequence (the pδtIDH1/IDH2 transformant) whereas cytosolic levels of IDH1 are significant even in the presence of its presequence when IDH2 is cytosolic (the pIDH1/δtIDH2 transformant). These observations suggest that holoenzyme assembly and selective pressure for NAD-isocitrate dehydrogenase activity may override IDH1 localization signals. In terms of mechanisms for aberrant IDH1 localization in acetate-grown cells, it is important to note that in the pIDH1/δtIDH2 transformant, the sizes of cytosolic and mitochondrial forms of IDH1 are similar (cf. Fig. 4, lanes 3). Since the precursor and mature forms of IDH1 are easily distinguishable electrophoretically, 1D. A. Keys and L. McAlister-Henn, unpublished observations. it appears that the cytosolic form has been processed. One possible explanation is suggested by a recent report describing partitioning of yeast fumarase into two cellular compartments(28.Stein I. Peleg Y. Even-Ram S. Pines O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4770-4778Google Scholar); the cytosolic form results from partial insertion of the precursor form into the mitochondrion, normal removal of the amino-terminal presequence, and release from the membrane as a folded cytosolic polypeptide. If this is also the case for IDH1 in the pIDH1/δtIDH2 transformant, cytosolic retention may be facilitated by the presence of and interaction with IDH2 in that compartment. Mitochondrial accumulation of IDH1 in the pδtIDH1/IDH2 transformant with acetate growth would suggest that either the presequence of IDH1 is not essential for localization or that some interaction with the precursor form of IDH2 may promote import. That these aberrant patterns of localization of IDH1 are observed only with growth on acetate may be due to some shift in equilibrium to favor formation of the holoenzyme which in turn seems to stabilize IDH1. In support of this notion, we have found that the presence of cytosolic IDH2 is essential for detection of cytosolic IDH1 (data not shown). The reason for differences in stability of cytosolic forms of IDH1 and IDH2 subunits is not clear. The mature polypeptides are similar in sequence and have identical amino-terminal residues in positions one and two, so the same N-end rules for cytosolic turnover (29.Varshavsky A. Cell. 1992; 69: 725-735Google Scholar) should apply to both. Our results suggest that IDH2 may be the nucleus for formation of holoenzyme. If so, it might be postulated that this subunit can form a homo-oligomeric species which might afford greater stability than a monomeric form. However, a previous study indicated that IDH2 isolated from a ΔIDH1 disruption mutant behaves as a monomer in gel filtration studies(5.Cupp J.R. McAlister-Henn L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16417-16423Google Scholar). Also, with the yeast two-hybrid system, we find no evidence for IDH2/IDH2 or for IDH1/IDH1 interactions under conditions where IDH1/IDH2 interactions are very strong. 2W.-N. Zhao and L. McAlister-Henn, unpublished observations. Deletion of both IDH1 and IDH2 presequences results in cytosolic localization of both subunits and formation of active holoenzyme. Thus, the mitochondrial environment and/or specific mitochondrial factors are not essential for correct polypeptide folding and subunit assembly. While we cannot rule out some accumulation of mitochondrial enzyme, immunoblot analysis and oxygen consumption assays suggest such levels would be very low. Restoration of the ability of a ΔIDH1/ΔIDH2 disruption mutant to grow on acetate suggests that the “cytosolic” form of IDH can supplement metabolic requirements for tricarboxylic acid cycle function. Similar results were recently found for a genetically engineered cytosolic form of MDH1 which also complements the acetate- phenotype of a ΔMDH1 disruption strain. 3W. C. Small and L. McAlister-Henn, unpublished observations. An energetic requirement in both cases is NADH. In yeast, reducing equivalents from cytosolic NADH may be supplied to the respiratory chain via an externally directed mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase(25.Ohnishi T. Kawaguchi K. Hagihara B. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 1797-1806Google Scholar), perhaps explaining compensatory function by the cytosolic enzymes. In any event, stoichiometric amounts of mitochondrial IDH are clearly not essential for tricarboxylic cycle function. Along these lines, a very interesting recent report by Elzinga et al.(30.Elzinga S.D.J. Bednarz A.L. van Oosterum K. Dekker P.J.T. Grivell L.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5328-5331Google Scholar) presents evidence that yeast NAD-IDH can specifically bind to sites within the 5′-untranslated leaders of several mitochondrial mRNAs. Among possible functions served by this binding are regulation of mRNA stability and/or control of translation. Our results suggest that either this binding requires very low levels of IDH or that loss of the function served by mRNA binding does not dramatically reduce cellular growth with acetate."

The knowledge of the orientation of Tat and details of other interactions with TAR RNA in Tat-TAR complex has significant implications for understanding gene regulation in HIV-1. The role of RNA-protein interactions is vital for many regulatory processes, especially in gene regulation where proteins specifically interact with binding sites found within RNA transcripts. RNA molecules can fold into extensive structures containing regions of double-stranded duplex, hairpins, internal loops, bulged bases, and pseudoknotted structures(1.Tinoco Jr., I. Puglisi J.D. Wyatt J.R. Nucl. Acids Mol. Biol. 1990; 4: 205-226Google Scholar, 2.Wyatt J.R. Puglisi J.D. Tinoco Jr., I. Bioessays. 1989; 11: 100-106Google Scholar). Due to the complexity of RNA structure, the rules governing sequence-specific RNA-protein recognition are not well understood. Recent structural studies have demonstrated that RNA-binding proteins interact with RNA in both the minor and major grooves. For example, two tRNA synthetases (alanine and glutamine) interact with the acceptor stems of their cognate tRNAs in the minor grooves(3.Rould M.A. Perona J.J. Soll D. Steitz T.A. Science. 1989; 246: 1135-1142Google Scholar, 4.Musier-Forsyth K. Usman N. Scaringe S. Doudna J. Green R. Schimmel P. Science. 1991; 253: 784-786Google Scholar). Major groove recognition takes place between aspartyl-tRNA synthetase and its cognate tRNAs at a site of local distortion in the RNA helix(5.Ruff M. Krishnaswamy S. Boeglin M. Poterszman A. Mitschler A. Podjarny A. Rees B. Thierry J.C. Moras D. Science. 1991; 252: 1682-1689Google Scholar). Bulge loops or bulges (unpaired nucleotides on one strand of a duplex) in RNA helices are potentially important in tertiary folding of RNA and in providing sites for specific RNA-protein interactions, as illustrated by TFIIIA of Xenopus(6.Baudin F. Romaniuk P.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 2043-2056Google Scholar) and the coat protein of phage R17(7.Wu H.-N. Uhlenbeck O.C. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 8221-8227Google Scholar). In a recent report, interactions between U1 small nuclear RNA and the N-terminal domain of the human U1A protein were mapped by multidimensional heteronuclear NMR studies(8.Howe P.W.A. Nagai K. Neuhaus D. Varani G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3873-3881Google Scholar). These studies showed that protein-RNA contacts occur at the single-stranded apical loop of the hairpin and also in the major groove of the helical stem at neighboring U-G and U-U non-Watson-Crick base pairs(8.Howe P.W.A. Nagai K. Neuhaus D. Varani G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3873-3881Google Scholar). Crystal structure of the RNA-binding domain of the U1A spliceosomal protein complexed with an RNA hairpin also revealed that the loop sequence (AUUGCAC) interacts with the surface of the four-stranded β-sheet (9.Oubridge C. Ito N. Evans P.R. Teo C.-H. Nagai K. Nature. 1994; 372: 432-438Google Scholar).

Peterlin B.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 717-743Google Scholar). As in other lentiviruses, Tat protein is essential for transactivation of viral gene expression (13.Cullen B.R. Microbiol.

In the absence of Tat, most of the viral transcripts terminate prematurely, producing short RNA molecules ranging in size from 60 to 80 nucleotides. Jeang et al.(17.Jeang K.-T. Berkhout B. Dropulic B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24940-24949Google Scholar) reported that integrated HIV-1 promoters did not show a high rate of abortive transcription. Nonetheless, HIV-1 proviruses and integrated long terminal repeats respond efficiently to Tat(17.Jeang K.-T. Berkhout B. Dropulic B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24940-24949Google Scholar). The Tat protein is a small, cysteine-rich nuclear protein containing 86 amino acids and comprised of three important functional domains. HIV-1 Tat protein acts by binding to the TAR (trans-activation responsive) RNA element, a 59-base stem-loop structure located at the 5′-ends of all nascent HIV-1 transcripts(18.Rosen C.A. Sodroski J.G. Haseltine W.A. Cell. 1985; 41: 813-823Google Scholar, 19.Hauber J. Cullen B.R. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 673-679Google Scholar, 20.Feng S. Holland E.C.

Cell. 1989; 59: 273-282Google Scholar). Upon binding to the TAR RNA sequence, Tat causes a substantial increase in transcript levels (23.Cullen B.R. Cell. 1986; 46: 973-982Google Scholar, 24.Peterlin B.M. Luciw P.A. Barr P.J. Walker M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 9734-9738Google Scholar, 25.Muesing M.A. Smith D.H. Capon D.A.

The increased efficiency in transcription may result from preventing premature termination of the transcriptional elongation complex (28.Kao S.-Y. Calman A.F. Luciw P.A. Peterlin B.M. Nature. 1987; 330: 489-493Google Scholar) or from enhancing initiation of transcription(29.Sharp P.A. Marciniak R.A. Cell. 1989; 59: 229-230Google Scholar). TAR RNA was originally localized to nucleotides +1 to +80 within the viral long terminal repeat(18.Rosen C.A. Sodroski J.G. Haseltine W.A. Cell. 1985; 41: 813-823Google Scholar). Subsequent deletion studies have established that the region from +19 to +42 incorporates the minimal domain that is both necessary and sufficient for Tat responsiveness in vivo(21.Jakobovits A. Smith D.H. Jakobovits E.B. Capon D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2555-2561Google Scholar, 30.Selby M.J. Bain E.S. Luciw P.A. Peterlin B.M. Genes & Dev. 1989; 3: 547-558Google Scholar, 31.Garcia J.A. Harrich D. Soultanakis E. Wu F. Zmitsuyasu R. Gaynor R.B. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 765-778Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5, the TAR RNA contains a six-nucleotide loop and a three-nucleotide pyrimidine bulge, which separates two helical stem regions(18.Rosen C.A. Sodroski J.G. Haseltine W.A. Cell. 1985; 41: 813-823Google Scholar, 21.Jakobovits A. Smith D.H. Jakobovits E.B. Capon D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2555-2561Google Scholar, 22.Berkhout B. Silverman R.H. Jeang K.T.

The trinucleotide bulge is essential for high affinity and specific binding of the Tat protein(32.Dingwall C. Ernberg I. Gait M.J. Green S.M. Heaphy S. Karn J. Lowe A.D. Singh M.

Skinner M.A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4145-4153Google Scholar). The Tat protein contains a basic RNA-binding region (amino acids 49-57) located in the carboxyl-terminal half of the protein(19.Hauber J. Cullen B.R. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 673-679Google Scholar, 34.Hauber J. Malim M.H. Cullen B.R. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 1181-1187Google Scholar, 35.Lazinski D. Grzadzielska E. Das A.

Biol. 1993; 230: 90-110Google Scholar). We used a 31-amino acid Tat fragment (amino acids 42-72) to form a specific complex with TAR RNA. Upon UV irradiation, this Tat fragment formed a covalent cross-link with TAR RNA. Sites of cross-links were determined on both the TAR RNA and Tat protein fragment by RNA and protein sequencing, respectively, which revealed that Tyr47 of Tat is close to G26 of TAR RNA. Our results provide the first physical evidence for a direct amino acid-base contact in Tat-TAR complex. All buffer pH values refer to measurements at room temperature. Transcription buffer contained 40 mM tris-HCl (pH 8.1), 1 mM spermidine, 0.01% Triton X-100, 5 mM dithiothreitol. TBE buffer contained 50 mM Tris, 50 mM boric acid (pH 8.3), 1 mM EDTA. Sample loading buffer contained 9 M urea, 50 mM Tris, 50 mM boric acid (pH 8.3), 1 mM EDTA, 0.025% bromphenol blue, 0.025% xylene cyanol. All DNAs were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems ABI 392 DNA/RNA synthesizer. The template strand encodes the sequence for the TAR RNA wild type. The top strand is a short piece of DNA complementary to the 3′-end of all template DNAs having the sequence 5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAG-3′. DNA was deprotected in NH4OH at 55°C for 8 h and then dried in a Savant Speedvac. The samples were resuspended in sample loading buffer and were purified on 8 M urea-20% acrylamide denaturing gels, 450 × 0.8 mm. Gels were run for 4 h at 30 W until bromphenol blue tracking dye was 5 cm from the bottom of the gel. DNAs were visualized by UV shadowing, excised from the gel, and eluted in 50 mM Tris, 50 mM boric acid, 1 mM EDTA, and 0.5 M sodium acetate. DNAs were ethanol-precipitated and resuspended in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water. Concentration of DNAs was determined by measuring absorbance at 260 nm in a Shimadzu UV spectrophotometer. Samples were stored at −20°C. RNAs were prepared in vitro by transcription from synthetic DNA templates by T7 polymerase(45.Milligan J.F. Groebe D.R. Witherell G.W. Uhlenbeck O.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8783-8798Google Scholar). The template strand of DNA was annealed to an equimolar amount of top strand DNA, and transcriptions were carried out in transcription buffer and 4.0 mM NTPs at 37°C for 2-4 h. For reactions containing 8.0 pmol of template DNA, 40-60 units of T7 polymerase was used. Reactions were stopped by adding an equal volume of sample loading buffer. RNAs were purified by electrophoresis on an 8 M urea, 20% polyacrylamide gel as described above. The sequence of RNAs was determined by base hydrolysis and nuclease digestion. RNA, starting with 300 pmol, was 5′-end-labeled with 32P to a specific activity of 2000 × 104 cpm/pmol after dephosphorylation with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (Promega), as described(46.Kuchino Y. Nishimura S. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 180: 154-163Google Scholar). The labeled RNAs were purified by electrophoresis on an 8 M urea, 20% polyacrylamide gel or by a Sep-Pak C18 cartridge (Waters, Millipore Corp.). All Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) amino acids, piperidine, 4-dimethylaminopyridine, dichloromethane, N,N-dimethylforamide, 1-hydroxybenzotriazole, 2-(1H-benzotriazo-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate, diisopropylethylamine, and HMP-linked polystyrene resin were obtained from the Applied Biosystems Division, Perkin-Elmer. Trifluoroacetic acid, 1,2-ethanedithiol, phenol, and thioanisole were from Sigma. Two Tat-derived peptides (from amino acids 42-72 and 48-72) were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems 431A peptide synthesizer using standard Fast Moc protocols. Cleavage and deprotection of the peptide was carried out in 2 ml of Reagent K for 6 h at room temperature. Reagent K contained 1.75 ml of trifluoroacetic acid, 100 μl of thioanisole, 100 μl of water, and 50 μl of ethanedithiol(47.King D.S. Fields C.G. Fields G.B. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1990; 36: 255-266Google Scholar). After cleavage from the resin, the peptide was purified by high pressure liquid chromatography on a Zorbax 300 SB-C8 column. The mass of fully deprotected and purified peptide was confirmed by fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry: calculated mass for Tat-(42-72) C152H263N59O43 = 3605.5, found 3606.5 (M + H); calculated mass for Tat-(48-72) C123H219N53O35 = 3000.4, found 3001.4 (M + H). A typical cross-linking reaction mixture (15 μl) contained 0.25 μM labeled RNA, 1.9 μM Tat peptide, 80 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 25 mM Tris (pH 7.4), and 100 mM NaCl. RNAs in H2O were heated at 75°C for 2 min and slowly cooled to room temperature. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 25°C for 30 min and cooled on ice before UV irradiation. The UV irradiation was conducted on ice for 10 min (254 nm; 1280 ergs/mm2/s) in a Rayonet RPR 100 photochemical reactor (Southern New England Ultraviolet Inc.). After UV irradiation, 2 μl of 20 mg/ml yeast tRNA (to remove Tat peptide from non-cross-linked RNA-peptide complex) and 10 μl of sample loading buffer were added. The mixtures were heated at 75°C for 1 min before being loaded on 8 M urea, 20% polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis, the gels were directly autoradiographed. Efficiencies of cross-linking were determined by a PhosphorImager analysis (Molecular Dynamics). 5′-end-labeled cross-linked RNA-peptide complexes were prepared as described above. After electrophoresis, the band corresponding to the cross-linked RNA-peptide complex, identified by autoradiography, was excised and eluted into the TBE buffer at 4°C overnight. The samples were then ethanol-precipitated and dried in a Savant Speedvac. Approximately 2 pmol of 5′-end-labeled RNA-peptide complex was partially hydrolyzed in the presence of 50 mM sodium carbonate (pH 9.2) for 20 min at 85°C. Size was assigned to the individual band by comparison with the migration of RNA digestion products produced by RNase T1 and Bacillus cereus (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The reaction mixture (10 ml) contained 4 μM 5′-end-labeled RNA, 6 μM peptide, 25 mM Tris (pH 7.4), and 50 mM NaCl. After UV irradiation, the mixtures were applied to a Mono Q HR 5/5 column (Pharmacia) equilibrated with 40 mM KCl, 25 mM Tris (pH 8.3) and eluted from the column with a salt gradient (0-8 min, 40-440 mM KCl; 8-16 min, 440-640 mM KCl; and 16-24 min, 640-1040 mM KCl) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. RNA-peptide complex was eluted at approximately 480 mM KCl and free RNA at 550 mM KCl. The fractions containing RNA-peptide complex were identified by gel electrophoresis (SDS and urea gels) and autoradiography. The RNA-peptide complex was desalted on a Sep-Pak C18 cartridge and lyophilized. The 5′-end-labeled RNA-peptide complex was dissolved in 0.15 ml of H2O, 80 μl of 0.5 M Tris (pH 8.1), and 80 μl of 1% SDS. After heating at 70°C for 1 min and cooling to 37°C, 0.62 ml of H2O, 0.067 ml of 15 mM CaCl2, and then 0.25 μg of sequencing grade modified trypsin (Promega) were added. The samples were incubated at 37°C for 13 h. After phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation, the samples were dissolved in 70 μl of H2O and 70 μl of sample loading buffer and electrophoresed on 8 M urea, 20% polyacrylamide. The tryptic fragments were identified by autoradiography, excised from the gel, eluted into 2 ml of 10 mM ammonium carbonate (pH 8.1), washed exhaustively with H2O on Sep-Pak C18 cartridge, and dried in a Savant Speedvac. The concentration of cross-linked RNA-peptide complex was determined based on RNA absorption at 260 nm. Amino acid sequencing was conducted at Yale University (New Haven, CT) on an Applied Biosystems sequencer. Before performing the UV-induced cross-linking experiment, it was necessary to establish the binding affinities of the Tat fragment (residues 42-72) used in this study. The dissociation constant (Kd) of TAR RNA and the Tat peptide was estimated to be 0.13 μM(48.Wang Z. Rana T.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 5438-5444Google Scholar). The concentrations of TAR RNA and the Tat peptide employed for cross-linking reactions were 0.25 μM and 1.9 μM, respectively. Under these conditions, electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed (data not shown) only one slow migrating RNA-peptide complex, indicating the absence of other nonspecific RNA-peptide complex formation(44.Churcher M.J. Lamont C. Hamy F. Dingwall C. Green S.M. Lowe A.D. Butler P.J.C. Gait M.J. Karn J. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 90-110Google Scholar, 48.Wang Z. Rana T.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 5438-5444Google Scholar). TAR RNA labeled at the 5′-end with 32P was incubated with the Tat peptide for 20 min in 25 mM Tris (pH 7.4) and 100 mM NaCl and UV-irradiated with 254-nm light (see “Experimental Procedures”). Products of the photoreaction were analyzed by denaturing 8 M urea-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1). Irradiation of the RNA-peptide complex yields a new band with electrophoretic mobility less than that of TAR RNA (lane 4). Both the peptide and UV irradiation are required for the formation of a cross-linked RNA-protein complex. This is evidenced by the fact that no cross-linked products are observed when RNA is irradiated in the absence of Tat peptide (lane 2) or incubated with peptide in the dark without UV irradiation (lane 3). Further control experiments showed that no cross-linking was observed when RNA and peptide were irradiated separately and then mixed (lane 5). Digestion of the RNA-peptide cross-link with Proteinase K (5 units for 30 min at 37°C) resulted in an RNA species with mobility similar to TAR RNA (lane 6). The products of irradiation were also analyzed on a denaturing SDS-15% polyacrylamide gel. Again, a photoproduct with electrophoretic mobility less than that of TAR RNA was observed that was dependent on the presence of RNA and peptide (data not shown). The photoproduct yield is ∼5% as determined by a PhosphorImager analysis. Since the cross-linked RNA-peptide complex is stable to alkaline pH (9.5), high temperature (85°C) and denaturing conditions (8 M urea, 2% SDS) we conclude that a covalent bond is formed between TAR RNA and the peptide during the cross-linking reaction. Formation of RNA-peptide photocross-link was dependent on the concentration of Tat peptide. Here, as in Fig. 1, the major cross-link product (XL1) has slightly lower electrophoretic mobility than TAR RNA. In Fig. 2, the efficiency of XL1 formation was increased as the peptide concentration was raised from 0.13 μM to 1.25 μM. At a peptide concentration higher than 1.25 μM, a second minor cross-linked product (XL2) with a lower electrophoretic mobility than that of XL1 was observed. The photocross-linking reaction between the Tat peptide and TAR RNA was also dependent on time of irradiation. The yields of cross-linked RNA-peptide complex were increased with an increase in time of irradiation (Fig. 3). In this experiment, similar to that shown in Fig. 2, extended time of irradiation also resulted in the formation of XL2 at 30 and 40 min. This second minor photoproduct could be the result of nonspecific binding of the peptide to RNA (at higher concentrations of peptide) or nonspecific association of photodamaged RNA and peptide after longer irradiation times. Further characterization of this minor photoproduct was not carried out in this study. Specificity of the cross-linking reaction was established by competition experiments. Cross-linking reactions were performed in a 15-μl volume containing 0.25 μM of 32P-5′-end-labeled TAR RNA, 1.9 μM Tat peptide, 80 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 100 mM NaCl, and up to 10 μM unlabeled competitor RNA. Cross-linked products were separated by 8 M urea-20% acrylamide gels and quantitated by PhosphorImager analysis. Fig. 4 shows that cross-linking was inhibited by the addition of unlabeled wild-type TAR RNA and not by a mutant TAR RNA lacking the trinucleotide bulge. Additional control experiments showed that cross-linking did not occur between a mutant TAR RNA without trinucleotide bulge and Tat-(42-72) (data not shown). Therefore, we conclude that formation of a specific RNA-protein complex between TAR RNA and Tat peptide is necessary for photocross-linking. Mapping of the cross-link site on TAR RNA to single nucleotide resolution was carried out by partial alkaline digestion of gel-purified RNA-protein cross-link XL1. Fragment sizes are determined by comparison with RNA oligonucleotides of defined sequence and length generated by digesting RNA with RNases T1 and B. Cereus. Base hydrolysis of RNA and cross-linked RNA-peptide complex generates a ladder of RNA degradation products. Bands of cross-linked RNA-peptide complexes migrate more slowly than corresponding free RNA (Fig. 5A, lanes 2 and 3). Base hydrolysis of the 5′-end-labeled cross-linked complex (Fig. 5A, lane 3) results in an RNA ladder in which all fragments up to uridine 25 are resolved. There is an obvious gap in the hydrolysis ladder after U25, indicating that the fragments above uridine 25 from the 5′-end are linked to the Tat peptide (Fig. 5A, lane 3). A standard base hydrolysis ladder was observed for 5′-end-labeled TAR RNA showing sensitivity to base hydrolysis at all positions, including U25 in the sequence (Fig. 5A, lane 2). Thus, we conclude that guanosine 26 of TAR RNA is the site at which cross-linking occurs (Fig. 5B). To identify the amino acid(s) of Tat that are involved in specific cross-linking with TAR RNA, the cross-linked RNA-peptide complex (XL1) was prepared on a preparative scale (see “Experimental Procedures”), purified from noncross-linked TAR RNA by ion exchange fast protein liquid chromatography, and digested with trypsin. The tryptic digest products were purified by 8 M urea, 20% acrylamide denaturing gels and visualized by autoradiography. We recovered ∼100 pmol quantities of a tryptic fragment of XL1 and subjected it to N-terminal sequencing. The amino acid sequencing data showed that it had a sequence of Ala-Leu-Gly-Ile-Ser-X-Gly-Arg-Lys-Lys. This sequence corresponds to the sequence encompassing amino acids 42-51 in HIV-1 Tat protein (Fig. 6). X at the 6th position represents a nonstandard amino acid instead of tyrosine 47 of the Tat peptide. Thus, cross-linking occurs at tyrosine 47 of the Tat peptide. Ultraviolet-induced cross-linking of RNA to proteins is a widely used technique to study in vitro and in vivo RNA-protein interactions(49.Gott J.M. Willis M.C. Koch T.H. Uhlenbeck O.C. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6290-6295Google Scholar, 50.Piñol-Roma S. Adam S.A. Choi Y.D. Dreyfuss G. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 180: 410-418Google Scholar, 51.Basilion J.P. Rouault T.A. Massinople C.M. Klausner R.D. Burgess W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 574-578Google Scholar). UV irradiation with sufficient intensity generates a highly reactive species of RNA, which reacts with protein and organic molecules involved in making direct contacts with RNA(52.Smith K.C. Wang S.Y. Photochemistry and Photobiology of Nucleic Acids. 2. Academic Press, Inc., New York1976: 187-218Google Scholar, 53.Greenberg J.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1979; 6: 715-731Google Scholar). To identify specific RNA-protein contacts, we irradiated TAR RNA and Tat-(42-72) protein complex with UV light and observed the formation of a covalent bond between RNA and protein. Formation of this covalently cross-linked product was dependent on the concentration of Tat peptide and irradiation time (Figure 2:, Figure 3:). Our competition and control experiments showed that a specific RNA-protein complex formation between TAR RNA and Tat fragment was necessary for photo-crosslinking reactions (Fig. 4). To locate the cross-link sites in TAR RNA and the Tat peptide, we prepared the RNA-protein cross-link on a preparative scale, purified the cross-link, and analyzed it by RNA and protein sequencing. Alkaline hydrolysis of 5′-end-labeled cross-links indicated that a single nucleotide, G26, in TAR RNA was involved in covalent interaction (Fig. 5, A and B). The absence of bands in the hydrolysis ladder after U25 from the 5′-end of RNA indicates that the RNA fragments after U25 are covalently linked to the Tat peptide and migrate more slowly to create a gap in the standard hydrolysis ladder. Our results clearly demonstrate that cross-linking occurs at at G26 in TAR RNA. Peptide sequencing on a tryptic fragment of the cross-link complex was accomplished by Edman degradation chemistry. The sequencing data indicate that cross-linking occurred at Tyr47 of the Tat peptide. As shown in Fig. 6, peptide sequencing identified a nonstandard amino acid X at the 6th position of the cross-linked peptide, Ala-Leu-Gly-Ile-Ser-X-Gly-Arg-Lys-Lys. This sequence corresponds to the region encompassing amino acids 42-51 in HIV-1 Tat protein (Fig. 6). The nonstandard amino acid most likely corresponds to a photomodified tyrosine. Sequencing of proteins by Edman degradation chemistry requires unmodified amino and carbonyl groups in the backbone of the peptide. Evidence that the Edman sequencing reaction was able to continue through Tyr47 indicates that cross-linking does not occur at these locations(54.Blatter E.E. Ebright Y.W. Ebright R.H. Nature. 1992; 359: 650-652Google Scholar). Therefore, we conclude that the aromatic side chain or C-α atom in the peptide backbone of Tyr47 is involved in the covalent cross-link formation with TAR RNA. It has been shown by a number of groups that Tat-derived peptides that contain the basic arginine-rich region of Tat are able to form in vitro complexes with TAR RNA(36.Delling U. Roy S.

Gait M.J. Karn J. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 90-110Google Scholar). Recently, Churcher et al.(44.Churcher M.J. Lamont C. Hamy F. Dingwall C. Green S.M. Lowe A.D. Butler P.J.C. Gait M.J. Karn J. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 90-110Google Scholar) published a detailed comparative study arguing that Tat peptides can mimic the binding affinity and specificity of Tat protein. Results from that study showed that the addition of amino acid residues from the core region of the Tat protein to the arginine-rich domain-containing peptides increased binding specificities(44.Churcher M.J. Lamont C. Hamy F. Dingwall C. Green S.M. Lowe A.D. Butler P.J.C. Gait M.J. Karn J. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 90-110Google Scholar). To achieve specific RNA binding by a Tat fragment, we used a Tat peptide, Tat-(42-72), that contained an RNA-binding domain and six amino acids from the core domain of the Tat protein. In this report, our cross-linking results have established that this Tat-(42-72) peptide forms a specific covalent photocross-link to TAR RNA where Tyr47 of the peptide contacts G26 of the RNA. What is the biological relevance of these findings? A number of studies showed that the immediate stem nucleotide base pairs flanking the bulge region of TAR RNA are required for Tat binding and trans-activation(44.Churcher M.J. Lamont C. Hamy F. Dingwall C. Green S.M. Lowe A.D. Butler P.J.C. Gait M.J. Karn J. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 90-110Google Scholar, 55.Weeks K.M. Crothers D.M. Cell. 1991; 66: 577-588Google Scholar, 56.Berkhout B. Jeang K.-T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6169-6176Google Scholar). During a detailed mutational analysis of TAR RNA, it was reported that a change of the G26-C39 base pair to C26-G39 base pair resulted in only 12% trans-activation by HIV-1 Tat(56.Berkhout B. Jeang K.-T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6169-6176Google Scholar). These reports strongly support our finding that G26 is directly involved in sequence-specific recognition and trans-activation by HIV-1 Tat protein. However, Tat protein mutants where Tyr47 was substituted with Ala or His were functional for trans-activation(57.Kuppuswamy M. Subramanian T. Srinivasan A. Chinnaduri G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 3551-3561Google Scholar, 58.Rice A.P. Carlotti F. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 1864-1868Google Scholar). These data raise the possibility that Tyr47 is not essential for RNA recognition and that the cross-link formation between Tyr47 and G26 could be the result of close proximity and favorable photochemistry. To address this question, we carried out cross-linking experiments with a Tat fragment lacking Tyr47, Tat-(48-72), which binds TAR RNA with high affinities(38.Cordingley M.G. La Femina R.L. Callahan P.L. Condra J.H. Sardana V.V. Graham D.J. Nguyen T.M. Le Grow K. Gotlib L. Schlabach A.J. Colonno R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8985-8989Google Scholar, 39.Weeks K.M. Ampe C. Schultz S.C. Steitz T.A. Crothers D.M. Science. 1990; 249: 1281-1285Google Scholar, 44.Churcher M.J. Lamont C. Hamy F. Dingwall C. Green S.M. Lowe A.D. Butler P.J.C. Gait M.J. Karn J. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 90-110Google Scholar). UV irradiation of TAR RNA complexed with Tat-(48-72) did not yield any specific RNA-protein cross-link products (data not shown). These results support our model of Tat-TAR interactions where the basic recognition sequence of Tat is located in the major groove of TAR RNA, bringing Tyr47 in close vicinity of G26 (Fig. 7). The cross-link formation between G26 and Tyr47 is likely the result of close proximity, favorable orientation, and photoreactivity of tyrosine. How does Tat interact with TAR RNA? Several lines of evidence suggest that Tat protein contacts TAR RNA in a widened major groove. In a recent study from our laboratory, we used a rhodium complex, bis(phenanthroline)(phenanthrenequinone diimine)-rhodium(III) (Rh(phen)2phi3+), to probe the effect of bulge bases on the major groove width in TAR RNA(59.Neenhold H.R. Rana T.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6303-6309Google Scholar). This metal complex does not bind double helical RNA or unstructured single-stranded regions of RNA. Instead, sites of tertiary interaction that are open in the major groove and accessible to stacking are targeted by the complex through photoactivated cleavage(60.Chow C.S. Behlen L.S. Uhlenbeck O.C. Barton J.K. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 972-982Google Scholar). The sites targeted by the rhodium complex have been mapped to single nucleotide resolution on wild-type TAR RNA and on several mutants of the TAR RNA containing different numbers of mismatch bases in the bulge region(59.Neenhold H.R. Rana T.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6303-6309Google Scholar). A strong cleavage at residues C39 and U40 was observed on the wild-type TAR RNA and in mutant TAR RNA containing two mismatch bases in the bulge. No cleavage at C39 and U40 was observed in a bulgeless TAR RNA and in a one-base bulge TAR RNA. Our studies establish two important factors involved in Tat-TAR recognition. (i) There is a correlation between major groove opening and Tat binding. At least a two-base bulge is required for major groove widening and other conformational changes to facilitate Tat binding. This cannot be accomplished by a single base bulge. (ii) The Tat fragment Tat-(42-72) occupies the major groove of TAR RNA and abolishes access of the rhodium complex. On the basis of chemical modification and gel mobility studies, a similar model was suggested earlier by Weeks and Crothers(55.Weeks K.M. Crothers D.M. Cell. 1991; 66: 577-588Google Scholar). Last, Hamy et al.(61.Hamy F. Asseline U. Grasby J. Iwai S. Pritchard C. Slim G. Butler P.J.G. Karn J. Gait M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 111-123Google Scholar) carried out site-specific modifications of functional groups on TAR RNA and showed that Tat forms multiple specific hydrogen bonds to a series of dispersed sites displayed in the major groove. To determine the relative orientation of the nucleic acid and protein in the Tat-TAR complex, we have devised a new method based on psoralen photochemistry(48.Wang Z. Rana T.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 5438-5444Google Scholar). We synthesized a 30-amino acid fragment containing the arginine-rich RNA-binding domain of Tat (residues 42-72) and chemically attached a psoralen at the amino terminus. Upon near ultraviolet irradiation (360 nm), this synthetic psoralen peptide cross-linked to a single site in the TAR RNA sequence. The RNA-protein complex was purified, and the cross-link site on TAR RNA was determined by chemical and primer extension analyses. Our results show that the amino terminus of Tat-(42-72) contacts, or is close to, uridine 42 in the lower stem of TAR RNA(48.Wang Z. Rana T.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 5438-5444Google Scholar). On the basis of the above studies, we suggest a model in which Tat binds to TAR RNA by inserting the basic recognition sequence into the enlarged major groove with an orientation where lysine 41 in the core domain of Tat contacts the lower stem and Tyr47 is close to G26 of TAR RNA (Fig. 7). These findings are intriguing and suggest a possible mechanism of RNA recognition by Tat."

Inhibition by amiloride derivatives substituted on a guanidium N could not be prevented by the presence of either K or Na; however, these cations could protect the enzyme against inhibition by derivatives substituted on the 5-position of the pyrazine ring. In the case of 5-(N-ethyl-[2′-methoxy-4′-nitrobenzyl])amiloride (NENMBA), the presence of monovalent cations (Na, K, and Rb) protected the enzyme effectively against inhibition, with concentrations in the millimolar range.

The rate of inhibition increased with increasing concentrations of NENMBA. Extensive washing of NENMBA-inhibited enzyme did not restore ATPase activity, showing that NENMBA has an extremely slow off-rate for dissociation from its inhibitory site. Partially inhibited enzyme could be rapidly pelleted and resuspended in NENMBA-free buffer and inhibition was observed to continue, albeit at a somewhat diminished rate, suggesting that NENMBA gains access to its inhibitory site after partitioning into the lipid phase rather than directly from the aqueous solution.

The sodium pump or Na,K-ATPase (EC 3.6.1.37) is the plasma membrane protein responsible for maintaining the resting concentrations of sodium and potassium in animal cells. It is composed of an α-subunit and a β-subunit. The α-subunit consists of about 1020 amino acid residues and has been cloned from several sources(1.Shull G.E. Lane L.K. Schwartz A. Lingrel J.B.

The β-subunit is composed of about 300 amino acids(7.Mercer R.W. Schneider J.W. Savitz A. Emanuel J. Benz E.J. Levenson R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 3884-3890Google Scholar, 8.Verrey F. Kairouz P.

EMBO J. 1989; 8: 193-202Google Scholar). The enzyme undergoes a series of conformational changes through its catalytic cycle, which couple binding of ATP and enzyme phosphorylation to the active transport of the monovalent cations against their electrochemical potential gradients (for reviews see (10.Glynn I.M. Martonosi A.N. The Enzymes of Biological Membranes. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1985: 35-114Google Scholar, 11.Kaplan J.H. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1985; 47: 535-544Google Scholar, 12.Kaplan J.H. Agre P. Parker J.C. Red Blood Cell Membranes: Structure Function and Clinical Implications. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1989: 455-480Google Scholar)). In its normal transport mode, the enzyme is phosphorylated by ATP when cation binding residues which selectively bind sodium are exposed to the cytosol; the enzyme then undergoes a major conformational transition and transports three sodiums across the cell membrane, where they dissociate to the external medium. The (phospho-) enzyme cation ligating residues are now exposed to the external medium and are more potassium-selective; two potassiums (or cogeners for potassium such as rubidium, cesium, etc.) bind, and the phospho-enzyme bond is hydrolyzed. The potassiums are then occluded within the protein, and the enzyme undergoes the second major conformational transition of its catalytic cycle when ATP binds with low affinity (but does not phosphorylate the protein) and so facilitates the release of potassium to the cytosol. The binding of sodium ions then reinitiates the cycle. A detailed molecular description of these transport events includes the localization of which amino acid residues are involved in binding and transport of sodium and potassium across the cell membrane. One method that has been used to address this problem is the utilization of residue-selective chemical probes to modify purified sodium pump protein (for review, see (13.Pedemonte C.H. Kaplan J.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: C1-C23Google Scholar)). It has been assumed that negatively charged amino acids are involved in cation coordination. This hypothesis has been tested by using aspartate and glutamate-specific carbodiimides which inactivate the sodium pump in a cation-preventable manner(14.Schoner W. Schmidt H. FEBS Lett. I. 1969; 5: 285-287Google Scholar, 15.Robinson J.D. FEBS Lett. 1974; 38: 325-328Google Scholar, 16.Gorga F.R. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 6783-6788Google Scholar, 17.Yamaguchi M. Sakamoto J. Tonomura Y.

Karlish S.J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19331-19341Google Scholar). There are inherent ambiguities in the use of such reagents, as they can also induce the formation of endo-peptide bonds; such crossing linking is also cation-preventable(16.Gorga F.R. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 6783-6788Google Scholar, 19.Pedemonte C.H. Kaplan J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 261: 16660-16665Google Scholar). In order to circumvent these problems, 4-(diazomethyl)-7-(diethylamino)-coumarin (DEAC), 1The abbreviations used are: DEAC4-(diazomethyl)-7-(diethylamino)-coumarinMes2(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acidTapsN-tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl-3-aminopropanesulfonic acidChes2-(N-cyclohexylamino)ethanesulfonic acidTricineN-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycineBSAbovine serum albuminPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisTBSTris-buffered salineNENMBA5-(N-ethyl-[2′-methoxy-4′-nitrobenzyl])amiloride. a stable diazomethane analogue, which reacts specifically and unambiguously with carboxylates to form stable ester derivatives of the protein, has been recently shown to modify Glu-779 in a cation-preventable manner(22.Argüello J.M.

However, by analogy with the naturally occurring ionophores, we would infer that not only glutamate or aspartate side chains are involved but the electron lone pairs of other, neutral residues might also be involved in monovalent cation transport. 4-(diazomethyl)-7-(diethylamino)-coumarin 2(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid N-tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl-3-aminopropanesulfonic acid 2-(N-cyclohexylamino)ethanesulfonic acid N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine bovine serum albumin polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis Tris-buffered saline 5-(N-ethyl-[2′-methoxy-4′-nitrobenzyl])amiloride. In this report we have examined the effects of four photoactivatable amiloride derivatives on the Na,K-ATPase. Amiloride derivatives were chosen because they are known to inhibit other sodium transporting proteins such as epithelial Na channels, the Na/H antiporter, and the Na/Ca exchanger(24.Kleyman T.R. Cragoe Jr., E.J. J. Mem. Biol. 1988; 105: 1-21Google Scholar, 25.Kleyman T.R. Cragoe Jr., E.J. Kraehenbuhl J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11995-12000Google Scholar). Furthermore, there are well defined structure-activity relationships for amiloride derivatives; guanidium-substituted probes show high affinity for epithelial Na channels, whereas pyrazine ring derivatives evidence a higher affinity for exchangers than channels(25.Kleyman T.R. Cragoe Jr., E.J. Kraehenbuhl J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11995-12000Google Scholar). The four compounds we tested are representative of the two classes of inhibitors. All four reagents inhibit the Na pump, but only the pyrazine ring-substituted derivatives in a cation-preventable manner. The most effective of these probes, NENMBA (Fig. 1), was shown to be covalently incorporated into the α-subunit of the Na pump upon irradiation, as shown by Western analysis using a polyclonal antibody. A preliminary report of some of these results has appeared(26.Ellis-Davies G.C.R. Kleyman T.R. Kaplan J.H. Biophys. J. 1993; 64: 332aGoogle Scholar). Amiloride derivatives were a gift from Merck, Sharp and Dohme, West Point, PA. ATP, ADP, imidazole, Hepes, Mes, Taps, Ches, Tris, and bovine serum albumin (BSA), dithiothreitol, sucrose, ultrapure urea, and Tricine were from Sigma; L-1-tosylamide-2-phenylethylchloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin was from Worthington Corporation. β-Mercaptoethanol, sodium dodecyl sulfate, ammonium persulfate, Coomassie R-250, and low molecular weight standards were from Bio-Rad. Acrylamide and bisacrylamide were obtained through Boehringer Mannheim. Nitrocellulose was from Millipore. Na,K-ATPase was purified from dog kidneys according to J⊘rgensen (27.J⊘rgensen P.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 356: 36-52Google Scholar) with the modification of Liang and Winter(28.Liang S.M. Winter C.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 452: 552-565Google Scholar). The enzyme was greater than 95% pure as judged by SDS-PAGE (see Fig. 9 in (33.Ellis-Davies G.C.R. Kaplan J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20570-20576Google Scholar)). The standard assay medium for Na,K-ATPase activity was (mM): EDTA, 0.5; NaCl, 130; KCl, 30; MgCl2, 3; ATP, 3: imidazole, 50; pH 7.2 (25°C); and about 0.8 μg/ml enzyme protein. Unless specified, it also contained 0.3 mg/ml BSA. The suspension was incubated at 37°C for 15 min and then the Pi released determined as reported by Brotherus et al.(29.Brotherus J.B. Moller J.V. J⊘rgensen P.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1981; 100: 146-154Google Scholar). The Na,K-ATPase activity was the difference between the ATP hydrolysis measured in the presence and absence of 0.5 mM ouabain. The enzyme used in these studies had a specific activity of 20-26 μmol of Pi released mg-1 min-1, a negligible ouabain-insensitive ATP hydrolysis and maximal phosphorylation by Pi at 37°C in the presence of ouabain of about 2.5-3.0 nmol mg protein-1. Protein was determined by the method of Lowry et al.(30.Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Google Scholar) using BSA as a standard. Incubation of purified Na,K-ATPase with each reagent (100 μM) was performed at 37°C by incubating the enzyme (0.05 μg/ml) in a medium containing 50 mM Hepes (except where noted) with 2 mM EDTA. The reagents were initially dissolved in Me2SO so that the final concentration of Me2SO in the incubation medium was 2-10%. The reactions were stopped by a 60-fold dilution into ice-cold assay medium. The results presented in Figure 2:, Figure 3:, Figure 4:, Figure 5:, Figure 6: are representative of at least three experiments in which all samples were run in duplicate. The range between duplicates was less than 10%. ATPase activity did not vary between experiments by more than 10% about the mean value shown in Figure 2:, Figure 3:, Figure 4:, Figure 5:, Figure 6:. Preparative photolabeling of Na pump protein with NENMBA was performed by incubation of the enzyme (1 mg/ml) with NENMBA (1 mM) for 10 min at 37°C. The enzyme was then pelleted, washed, and resuspended in NENMBA-free Hepes (50 mM) and EDTA (2 mM). 200-μl aliquots were irradiated in a 1-mm pathlength cuvette for 2 min with a 1000-watt high pressure Hg arc lamp filtered through a 313 ± 10 nm band-pass filter (Oriel) in order to excite specifically the nitroaromatic chomophore. Gel electrophoresis was carried out on intact Na pump using a linear (10%) SDS-PAGE system after Laemmli (31.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). Serum containing polyclonal antibodies raised against amiloride conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin via the 5-position of the pyrazine ring (32.Kleyman T.R. Kraehenbuhl JP. Rossier B.C. Cragoe E.J. Warnock D.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: 1135-1141Google Scholar) were purified by twice treating 25 ml of a 1:100 dilution (81 μg) in TBS (200 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5) with 100 μg of purified Na pump spotted onto nitrocellulose (and blocked with milk), so removing any cross-reactivity from the serum. After electrophoresis of labeled protein samples and protein transfer to nitrocellulose by electroblotting, the blot was incubated at room temperature for 1 h with 5% milk protein and then incubated with a 1:100,000 dilution of the primary antibody overnight at 4°C. The blot was washed five times with TBS and then incubated at room temperature for 2 h with a 1:2000 dilution alkaline phosphatase goat anti-rabbit antibodies in buffer, followed by washing five times in TBS. Bound antibodies were then detected with Sigma Fast. Nucleotide binding was measured as described previously (33.Ellis-Davies G.C.R. Kaplan J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20570-20576Google Scholar) in a medium containing (mM): Hepes/imidazole, 30; pH (25°C) 7.2; NaEDTA, 0.1; NaCl, 5; [3H]ADP, 0.10; and 0.5 mg/ml protein. The suspension was shaken at 4°C for 30 s and centrifuged at 400,000 × g for 10 min. The pellet was resuspended in 2.5 M NaOH, and radioactivity and protein concentration were determined. Radioactivity bound to the enzyme in the presence of 0.5 mM ATP was subtracted from the experimental values as a correction for nonspecific (or low affinity) binding. Incubation of purified Na,K-ATPase with the four amiloride derivatives shown in Fig. 1 resulted in inhibition of the enzyme activity to varying degrees (Fig. 2). The two “channel-specific” compounds (NMBA and bromobenzomil) inhibited the enzyme (∼30-40% under the conditions shown) but the presence of Rb ions in the incubation medium were without effect. Under the same conditions, the “exchanger-specific” compounds (NENMBA and 6-bromo-5(N,N-cyclohexyl)amiloride) produced 70-90% inhibition of Na,K-ATPase and cation prevention of inhibition was observed. In the case of NENMBA, the protection against inhibition was almost complete. It should be emphasized at this point that even though all these probes can potentially photolabel the Na pump upon illumination (300-360 nm), the inhibition of the Na pump as illustrated in Fig. 2 is occurring in the absence of illumination. The most effective prevention of inhibition by Rb was observed with NENMBA; thus, this probe was examined in more detail. Fig. 3 shows that increasing [NENMBA] increases the rate of inhibition of the Na pump. If fully inhibited enzyme (<2% residual activity) is pelleted by centrifugation, washed in inhibitor-free buffer, and resuspended in buffer, no recovery of enzyme activity is observed. Thus, the dissociation of the inhibitor appears to be an extremely slow process. The lack of recovery is independent of the composition of the resuspension media (± Rb, ± ATP, ± BSA, ± Na). The presence of monovalent cations (Na, K, or Rb) in the incubation medium can prevent the inhibitory binding of NENMBA to the Na pump. These cations protect the enzyme with concentrations in the mM range: K0.5 for Rb (which is recognized as a cogener for K by the Na pump) is about 1 mM (see Fig. 4A), and for Na is about 7 mM (Fig. 4B), when a concentration of 100 μM NENMBA was used to inhibit the enzyme at 37°C for 10 min. However, since NENMBA has an extremely slow off-rate, eventually the enzyme is fully inhibited even in the presence of 100 mM monovalent cations.Figure 4:Protective effect of Rb (A) and Na (B) on the inhibition of purified Na,K-ATPase by NENMBA (Rb is used as a cogener for K in these experiments). The enzyme (0.05 mg/ml) was incubated with NENMBA (100 μM with Rb, 40 μM with Na) at 37°C at pH 7.5 (40 mM Hepes) for 2 min with the concentrations of cations indicated and activity was assayed as described under “Materials and Methods.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) When the pH of the medium is varied, the rate of binding of NENMBA to its inhibitory site on the Na pump changes. As the pH is increased from 6.5 to 9.0, the rate of development of inhibition increases (Fig. 5). The effect of pH on the inhibitor:protein interaction is probably more complex than simple titration of the inhibitor, the pKa of which is 8.3 (24.Kleyman T.R. Cragoe Jr., E.J. J. Mem. Biol. 1988; 105: 1-21Google Scholar). We believe that partitioning into the lipid phase occurs prior to inhibition (see below) and the partition coefficient is likely to increase with increasing pH. The slow development of inhibition and its very slow (if any) reversibility, together with the greater effectiveness of the unprotonated reagent, raised the question as to whether NENMBA bound directly to the inhibitory site from the solution or first partitioned into the membrane phase. Experiments were designed to examine these possibilities. A sample of enzyme was incubated with NENMBA at 37°C and when about 50% inhibition had been attained, half the enzyme was pelleted at 450,000 × g at 4°C for 5 min and resuspended in inhibitor-free buffer at 37°C, and the incubation was continued. As shown in Fig. 6, a slower rate of inhibition is seen in the resuspended enzyme than with the uninterrupted incubation. Although the greatest protection against inhibition was shown by cations and only little (if any) protection by ATP (see Fig. 2), it was important to see whether or not the ATP binding domain was greatly affected by the presence of the inhibitor. This experiment was possible because of the extremely slow reversibility of the inhibition due to NENMBA addition. It was found that both native and NENMBA-treated enzyme could bind [3H]ADP to the same extent; about 2.5 nmol of ADP was specifically bound per milligram of enzyme. This level of binding is very similar to that previously observed for native enzyme (33.Ellis-Davies G.C.R. Kaplan J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20570-20576Google Scholar) and DEAC-treated enzyme(22.Argüello J.M. Kaplan J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 266: 14627-14635Google Scholar). Irradiation of fully inhibited enzyme at 313 ± 10 nm with the output from a high pressure Hg arc lamp (only exciting the nitroaromatic chromophore; (25.Kleyman T.R. Cragoe Jr., E.J. Kraehenbuhl J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11995-12000Google Scholar)) results in the covalent incorporation of the probe specifically into the α-subunit of the Na pump (see Fig. 7). Western analysis of Na pump, after separation by SDS-PAGE and transfer to nitrocellulose, using an amiloride polyclonal antibody, shows that irradiation is necessary for covalent incorporation (Fig. 7, lanes 3 and 4; there is no cross-reactivity of the antibody with the Na pump, lane 2). Irradiation of Na pump in the presence of NENMBA and Rb shows that there is very little, if any, nonspecific photoincorporation of the probe into the protein (lane 5). Staining of the nitrocellulose membrane after transfer but prior to blocking with milk with the reversible dye, Ponceau Red, showed that approximately the same amount of protein had been transferred in each lane of Fig. 7(not shown). In the present work we have shown that NENMBA, a pyrazine-substituted amiloride derivative, is a potent inhibitor of the Na,K-ATPase. The inhibition is prevented by the simultaneous presence of monovalent cations, which are transported by the Na pump, and the inhibitor is covalently coupled to the protein upon irradiation at 313 nm. It has been known for some time that amiloride itself inhibits the Na pump, albeit with low affinity, and that pyrazine-ring substituted amiloride derivatives exhibit an enhanced affinity for the Na pump compared to the parent compound(34.Soltoff S.P. Mandel L.J. Science. 1983; 220: 957-959Google Scholar, 35.Zhuang Y-x. Cragoe E.J. Shaikewitz T. Glaser L. Cassel D. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4481-4488Google Scholar). However, these studies were performed either on various cell lines or on Na pump preparations which had 1.5% the specific activity of the enzyme used in this report. The intent of the present studies was to exploit the binding of photoactivatable amiloride derivatives to the Na pump, so as to localize non-acidic amino acid residues in the cation transport domain of the enzyme. The fundamental requirement for the success of this strategy is that the cation photoaffinity probes bind with high affinity to Na pump prior to photolysis, in a cation-preventable manner, so that reasonably specific covalent incorporation of the probe into the protein can subsequently be achieved. We examined the effects of four amiloride derivatives, all of which are potentially photoactivatable, on the ability of purified renal Na,K-ATPase to hydrolyze ATP. All four compounds inhibited ATPase activity (Fig. 2). However, we found that it was only the “exchanger-specific” probes, NENMBA and 6-bromo-5(N,N-cyclohexyl)amiloride, which could be prevented from binding to and inhibiting the Na pump by the presence of monovalent cation ligands. It seems from this pharmacological profile that the Na pump interacts with amiloride derivatives in a manner which is more like other transport proteins such as the Na/Ca and Na/H exchangers than epithelial Na channels. The Na/Ca and Na/H exchangers are like the Na pump in that they undergo a series of conformational transitions during their transport cycle in which the cation binding sites are alternately exposed to each side of the membrane. However, there is no homology in the primary structures or evidence of similarity of cation binding site structure between these exchangers and the Na,K-ATPase. Tight binding of one amiloride derivative (phenamil) has also been previously observed on epithelial Na channels(36.Garvin J.L. Simon S.A. Cragoe E.J. Mandel L.J. J. Membr. Biol. 1985; 87: 45-54Google Scholar). David et al.(37.David P. Mayan H. Cragoe E.J. Karlish S.J.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1146: 59-64Google Scholar) have recently surveyed 15 amiloride derivatives (including NMBA) for their inhibitory activity against the Na pump. They observed that pyrazine-substituted amilorides were effective competitive inhibitors of Rb occlusion, with concentrations in the tens of micromolar range, whereas guanidine-substituted amilorides only seemed to prevent Rb occlusion at very high concentrations. The rates of development or reversal of inhibition were not reported, as the assay used in their study was performed by incubating purified Na pump at room temperature for 3 min with 86Rb in the absence and presence of varying concentrations of amiloride derivatives. Since cation prevention of inhibition of the Na,K-ATPase was clearest in the case of NENMBA (Fig. 2), it was decided to examine these effects in more detail (Fig. 4). Both Na+ and Rb+ (as a cogener for K+), protected the enzyme against inhibition of NENMBA. We have found that almost all (90%) the inhibition by NENMBA can be prevented when 10 mM K or Rb is included in the incubation medium (Fig. 4A), and that Rb protects the enzyme with a K0.5 in the 1-2 mM range. Sodium does not prevent binding quite so effectively; nevertheless, about 60-70% of the enzyme activity can be preserved when about 60 mM Na is included in the incubation medium. The K0.5 for this protective effect is about 10 mM (Fig. 4B). Protection against covalent inhibition by DEAC, a cation-site directed reagent, has also been reported to be more effective and complete with K than Na(22.Argüello J.M. Kaplan J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 266: 14627-14635Google Scholar). However, these protective effects of ligand cations can be overcome simply by prolonging the incubation period. Once the probe is bound to its inhibitory site, it exhibits an extremely slow dissociation rate from this complex, as extensive washing of the enzyme with ligands (Na,K-ATP) does not restore ATPase activity. Furthermore, native and NENMBA-inhibited Na pump exhibited the same level of high affinity nucleotide binding, suggesting that NENMBA does not perturb greatly the catalytic domain of the enzyme. This is encouraging for the use of NENMBA as a cation-site probe, since it is desirable that such a reagent should have effects which, as far as possible, are limited to the cation-binding domain. The tight binding or “occlusion” of both Na+ and K+ have been well characterized kinetically and it is thought that these intermediates do in fact form part of the normal catalytic cycle of the Na pump(10.Glynn I.M. Martonosi A.N. The Enzymes of Biological Membranes. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1985: 35-114Google Scholar, 38.Glynn I.M. Richards D.E. J. Physiol. 1982; 330: 17-43Google Scholar, 39.Glynn I.M. Howland J.L. Richards D.E. J. Physiol. 1982; 368: 453-569Google Scholar, 40.Forbush III, B. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11104-11115Google Scholar). An important characteristic of the cation occlusion phenomenon is the slow association and dissociation of the cations. It is tempting to speculate that since NENMBA does not seem to dissociate from the enzyme it also becomes occluded by the Na pump; however, since other substituted amines(41.Forbush III, B. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7979-7988Google Scholar), including guanidines(42.Or E. David P. Shainskaya A. Tal D.M. Karlish S.J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16929-16937Google Scholar), do not seem to be occluded by the Na,K-ATPase, we deem it unlikely that NENMBA is exceptional in this regard. Fig. 6 shows that when partially inhibited Na pump is pelleted and resuspended in NENMBA-free buffer, the observed rate of inhibition is reduced 2-3-fold. Several conclusions can be drawn from this observation. First, as observed previously and mentioned above, inhibition is not relieved by resuspension in inhibitor-free medium, i.e. there is a very slow off-rate from the inhibitory site. Second, it seems highly likely that inhibitor in the membrane phase is associated with the slow development of inhibition. NENMBA has been found to be highly hydrophobic, having a partition coefficient of 200:1 between chloroform and 0.1 M phosphate buffer at pH 7.4 (24.Kleyman T.R. Cragoe Jr., E.J. J. Mem. Biol. 1988; 105: 1-21Google Scholar). We estimate that the volume ratio of the pellet/resuspension medium is about 1:100. We would expect the partition equilibrium to be re-established very rapidly on resuspension, and thus the concentration of NENMBA in the membrane following resuspension would be about one-half of its value prior to resuspension, and the rate of development of inhibition would fall by about 2-fold, which is what is observed (Fig. 6). Therefore, the probe gains access to its inhibitory site after it has partitioned into the lipid environment. If NENMBA bound to the Na pump directly from the aqueous solution, pelleting and resuspension of the partially inhibited protein should effectively stop any further inhibition; such is not the case. NENMBA has a pKa of about 8.3(24.Kleyman T.R. Cragoe Jr., E.J. J. Mem. Biol. 1988; 105: 1-21Google Scholar); thus, as the pH is raised from 6.5 to 9.0 (Fig. 5), the reagent deprotonates and partitions more completely into the membrane. Entry to the inhibitory site seems to occur from the membrane phase, so that the rate of inhibition thus increases as the pH is raised. One of the potential disadvantages of photoaffinity labeling in general is the possibility of producing nonspecific photo-incorporation of a probe, as irradiation normally produces a hyper-reactive chemical species (nitrene or carbene), which can even insert into C-H bonds. NENMBA is an attractive chemical probe for monovalent cation binding residues in the Na,K-ATPase for at least two reasons. First, the tight binding and slow dissociation of NENMBA from the Na pump enabled fully inhibited enzyme to be pelleted, washed, and resuspended in NENMBA-free buffer and irradiated to produce cation-preventable, specific photolabeling of the Na pump α-subunit (Fig. 7, compare lanes 3 and 5). Radioactive NENMBA was not available; therefore, covalent incorporation was probed by Western analysis of labeled Na pump transferred onto nitrocellulose, and probed using the amiloride polyclonal antibody. Even though NENMBA binding can completely prevent ATP hydrolysis by the Na pump, this inhibition does not result in a positive signal in the Western blot (lane 4), i.e.. irradiation is necessary for covalent incorporation of the probe into the α-subunit. Second, NENMBA promises to be a useful cation binding site photo-activated probe since the nitroanisole chromophore reacts by displacement of the methoxy group through a photoaromatic nucleophilic substitution reaction(43.Jelenc P. Cantor C.R. Simon S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 3564-3568Google Scholar). These types of chromophores are stable upon irradiation in the absence of nucleophiles(44.Kronenberg M.E. van den Heyden A. Havinga E. Recl. Trav. Chim. Pay-Bas. 1966; 85: 56-58Google Scholar). This property makes them rather different from the more widely used aromatic azides, which produce reactive nitrenes upon illumination. If these nitrenes do not react with the target protein, they decompose to inert side products; for this reason, observed yields of covalent incorporation of such photoaffinity probes are often very low. In principle, the efficiency of covalent modification of the target enzyme can be much higher with the chromophore used in NENMBA, since it returns to ground state starting materials, if it does not encounter a nearby nucleophile, and so can be re-excited repeatedly during irradiation until a productive encounter occurs. Two other types of cation binding site chemical probes have been used with the Na pump. The most extensively used are carbodiimides, which react with carboxyls (i.e. glutamates and aspartates) to produce an activated ester, which can react with a nucleophile to produce an amide; thus, intramolecular cross-linking is possible with these probes(16.Gorga F.R. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 6783-6788Google Scholar, 19.Pedemonte C.H. Kaplan J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 261: 16660-16665Google Scholar). This disadvantage has been recently circumvented by use of a cationic substituted diazomethane (DEAC), which also reacts chemo-selectively with carboxylates to form stable ester derivatives of amino acids directly(22.Argüello J.M. Kaplan J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 266: 14627-14635Google Scholar, 23.Argüello J.M. Kaplan J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6892-6899Google Scholar). These reagents have been used because it has been thought for some time that negatively charged amino acid residues might be involved in cation binding and transport. However, inspection of the structures of naturally occurring monovalent cation ionophores suggests that serines, threonines, and tyrosines could also be involved in cation co-ordination of Na and K by the Na pump. Furthermore, the first atomic-resolution crystal structure of a Na/K binding enzyme (the dialkylglycine decarboxylase) shows no Asp or Glu involved in Na/K binding at one of its two cation co-ordination centers(45.Toney M.D. Hohenester E. Cowan S.W. Jansonius J.N. Science. 1993; 261: 756-758Google Scholar). In summary, we found that four photoactivatable amiloride analogues inhibit the Na,K-ATPase and monovalent cations protect the enzyme only when the photolabile substituent is on the pyrazine ring. Upon illumination, NENMBA is covalently incorporated into the α-subunit as shown by Western analysis using an amiloride specific antibody. Further studies are under way to localize the amino acid residue labeled by NENMBA."
