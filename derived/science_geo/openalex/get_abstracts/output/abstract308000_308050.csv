https://openalex.org/W2051607097,"Fog water collected at three sites in Los Angeles and Bakersfield, California, was found to have higher acidity and higher concentrations of sulfate, nitrate, and ammonium than previously observed in atmospheric water droplets. The pH of the fog water was in the range of 2.2 to 4.0. The dominant processes controlling the fog water chemistry appear to be the condensation and evaporation of water vapor on preexisting aerosol and the scavenging of gas-phase nitric acid."
https://openalex.org/W2013545252,"New radiocarbon dates and plant macrofossil data establish that parts of the Queen Charlotte Islands, British Columbia, were ice-free during and subsequent to the late Wisconsin glacial maximum on the Pacific coast of Canada. A paleoecological investigation of dated sediments at Cape Ball has indicated that a varied flora consisting of terrestrial and aquatic plants was present there about 16,000 years ago. This finding provides support for the existence of a heretofore questioned biotic refugium on the Queen Charlotte Islands during the last glaciation. These results shed new light on problems of glacial chronology, climatic change, biogeography, and archeology along the western margin of North America."
https://openalex.org/W2045425000,"Tail removal from dominant juvenile Uta stansburiana resulted in a decrease in social status in dyadic encounters. Most lizards were affected after removal of two-thirds of their tails. In some pairs, dominant lizards lost status after removal of one-third of their tails but regained dominance after the other member of the pair lost two-thirds of its tail. Tail loss in nature may impose a social handicap to successful home range acquisition and thereby increase risk of death."

We report bands of cells around each abdominal segment that contain numerous electron-opaque, iron-containing granules. The iron is principally in the form of hydrous iron oxides."

Advances have been made in acidic and enzymatic hydrolysis of the cellulose component of biomass and in some newer processes for biomass refining which leave the lignin fraction relatively intact. Rather than low-priced fuels, which have received the most publicity, initial targets will be products with more profit potential, such as chemicals and molasses. Curtailment of government support for alcohol fuel programs is not crucial, because private investment is taking biomass refining from the pilot plant to the demonstration scale."
https://openalex.org/W1973190348,"Guard cell chloroplasts in senescing leaves from 12 species of perennial trees and three species of annual plants survived considerably longer than their mesophyll counterparts. In Ginkgo biloba, stomata from yellow leaves opened during the day and closed at night; guard cell chloroplasts from these leaves showed fluorescence transients associated with electron transport and photophosphorylation. These findings indicate that guard cell chloroplasts are highly conserved throughout the life-span of the leaf and that leaves retain stomatal control during senescence."
https://openalex.org/W2058686814,"In early autumn, high temperatures terminate diapause in the alfalfa blotch leafminer Agromyza frontella; low temperatures maintain diapause. These responses subserve a thermally malleable dormancy and allow flexibility in the annual number of generations. The view that favorable conditions cannot reverse the course of diapause are contradicted by the data on A. frontella. A better understanding to life history studies and phenological models in insect pest management."

https://openalex.org/W1981392835,"The initially high expectations of the mid-1970's for the rapid development of geothermal energy have been lowered. One reason is continuing uncertainty about the extraction of geothermal energy. Drillers can have a good idea of which areas have concentrations of geothermal energy beneath the surface and still have trouble bringing up enough energy to make a power plant worthwhile. The extraction problem has been highlighted by the recent termination of a federal geothermal demonstration project at the Baca field of the Valles Caldera, New Mexico, the sixth largest geothermal province in the United States. The problem at Baca is not necessarily insoluble, but it is tending to accentuate industry's cautious approach to geothermal exploration."

https://openalex.org/W2023448997,"Of all the alternatives to gasoline from petroleum, methane is the one source that could displace much of it relatively rapidly. For example, shale oil in quantity is decades away, as are liquid fuels from coal. But methane is available and conversion of cars to use it is not difficult. At the moment, proved reserves of natural gas are limited, but the National Petroleum Council and the American Gas Association are confident that much more will be found and tapped. They point to methane in the Devonian shales of the Appalachian Basin, to methane associated with coal, and to natural gas in western tight gas sands. In addition, many other horizons have not been explored. Once successful wells are drilled, processing equipment can be quickly installed and the production channeled into the pipeline network. Thus, the nation has an answer to a prolonged attenuation of oil imports. The earth's crust contains large amounts of methane. The gas can also be obtained from biomass and from synthesis gas derived from coal. In the United States, a million-mile pipeline network exists for distribution of the gas. Methane is already being used in about 400,000 vehicles around the world, including 250,000 in Italy and 20,000 to 30,000 in the United States. Users have found that engine wear is reduced: lubricating oil is not diluted as it is when gasoline is used. Exhaust gases are relatively nonpolluting. Start-up of motors is not affected by cold weather. An engine designed especially for methane has an energy efficiency greater than that of ordinary automobiles. Conventional cars and trucks can be modified at a cost of $1500 to burn either methane or liquid fuels. When they burn methane, such engines are about 10 percent less efficient and, for the same piston displacement, generates 25 percent less power than with gasoline."
