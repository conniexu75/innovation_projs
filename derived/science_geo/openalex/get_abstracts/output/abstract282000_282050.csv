https://openalex.org/W2052713658,"Two conflicting hypotheses purport to explain the mechanism generating the lingual flip in frogs. The first suggests that the intrinsic tongue muscles are stiffened, rotate over the symphysis and catapult the soft tissues; the second suggests that the hyoid suddenly moves forward and transfers its momentum to propel the tongue. High-speed cinematography and synchronized electromyography show that the tongue is rotated over the symphysis by a complex of rods formed from stiffened intrinsic tongue muscles. As the flip occurs even when the hyoid is immobilized, the hyoid momentum hypothesis does not apply. The tongue is then propelled by sets of fibers locked into connective tissues. With activation, these become rigid rods that form a muscular ballista."

This was achieved by using a pressure-retaining sterilizable seawater sampling system in connection with a prepressurized hyperbaric isolation chamber. Rates of growth and substrate uptake of the majority of isolates showed highly barotolerant characteristics, while the remainder (4 out of 15) exhibited barophilic characteristics."

https://openalex.org/W2016469183,"Rats first fed soybean oil and peanut oil diets, then subjected to the process of fat depletion through selective starvation, involving 23 to 27 per cent. loss in body weight, before being fed a ""hardening"" diet, yielded ""harder"" fats-fats of lower iodine number values-than the fats of rats which were not starved before being fed the carbohydrate-rich diet. In other words, through the process of starvation, the ""soft"" oily fat produced on diets containing soybean' or peanut oils is very largely removed, thereby permitting the deposit of a ""hard"" fat. To obtain a fat of equal ""hardness"" from rats which were not subjected to the starvation treatment would have required a much longer period of feeding of the diet rich in starch than was found necessary with rats after first being starved. The growth of recovery made by the rats of the starved lots was made on a low food intake. With the starved rats flrst fed peanut oil, the food intake of the carbohydrate-rich diet was less than with the non-starved group. The possible application of these findings to practical animal husbandry is obvious."
