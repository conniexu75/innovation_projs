https://openalex.org/W2035753075,"Chemical space — which encompasses all possible small organic molecules, including those present in biological systems — is vast. So vast, in fact, that so far only a tiny fraction of it has been explored. Nevertheless, these explorations have greatly enhanced our understanding of biology, and have led to the development of many of today's drugs. The discovery of new bioactive molecules, facilitated by a deeper understanding of the nature of the regions of chemical space that are relevant to biology, will advance our knowledge of biological processes and lead to new strategies to treat disease."

https://openalex.org/W2088645368,"Our knowledge of the structure of matter is largely based on X-ray diffraction studies of periodic structures and the successful transformation (inversion) of the diffraction patterns into real-space atomic maps. But the determination of non-periodic nanoscale structures by X-rays is much more difficult. Inversion of the measured diffuse X-ray intensity patterns suffers from the intrinsic loss of phase information1,2, and direct imaging methods are limited in resolution by the available X-ray optics3. Here we demonstrate a versatile technique for imaging nanostructures, based on the use of resonantly tuned soft X-rays for scattering contrast and the direct Fourier inversion of a holographically formed interference pattern. Our implementation places the sample behind a lithographically manufactured mask with a micrometre-sized sample aperture and a nanometre-sized hole that defines a reference beam. As an example, we have used the resonant X-ray magnetic circular dichroism effect to image the random magnetic domain structure in a Co/Pt multilayer film with a spatial resolution of 50 nm. Our technique, which is a form of Fourier transform holography, is transferable to a wide variety of specimens, appears scalable to diffraction-limited resolution, and is well suited for ultrafast single-shot imaging with coherent X-ray free-electron laser sources4."

Here we use femtosecond laser surgery for axotomy in the roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans and show that these axons functionally regenerate after the operation. Application of this precise surgical technique should enable nerve regeneration to be studied in vivo in its most evolutionarily simple form."
https://openalex.org/W2007104515,"In the next decade, advances in complementary metal-oxide semiconductor fabrication will lead to devices with gate lengths (the region in the device that switches the current flow on and off) below 10 nanometers (nm), as compared with current gate lengths in chips that are now about 50 nm. However, conventional scaling will no longer be sufficient to continue device performance by creating smaller transistors. Alternatives that are being pursued include new device geometries such as ultrathin channel structures to control capacitive losses and multiple gates to better control leakage pathways. Improvement in device speed by enhancing the mobility of charge carriers may be obtained with strain engineering and the use of different crystal orientations. Here, we discuss challenges and possible solutions for continued silicon device performance trends down to the sub-10-nm gate regimes."
https://openalex.org/W2076051065,"One challenge in supramolecular chemistry is the design of versatile, self-assembling building blocks to attain total control of arrangement of matter at a molecular level. We have achieved reliable prediction and design of the three-dimensional structure of artificial RNA building blocks to generate molecular jigsaw puzzle units called tectosquares. They can be programmed with control over their geometry, topology, directionality, and addressability to algorithmically self-assemble into a variety of complex nanoscopic fabrics with predefined periodic and aperiodic patterns and finite dimensions. This work emphasizes the modular and hierarchical characteristics of RNA by showing that small RNA structural motifs can code the precise topology of large molecular architectures. It demonstrates that fully addressable materials based on RNA can be synthesized and provides insights into self-assembly processes involving large populations of RNA molecules."

https://openalex.org/W2031693508,"A quantum critical point (QCP) develops in a material at absolute zero when a new form of order smoothly emerges in its ground state. QCPs are of great current interest because of their singular ability to influence the finite temperature properties of materials. Recently, heavy-fermion metals have played a key role in the study of antiferromagnetic QCPs. To accommodate the heavy electrons, the Fermi surface of the heavy-fermion paramagnet is larger than that of an antiferromagnet. An important unsolved question is whether the Fermi surface transformation at the QCP develops gradually, as expected if the magnetism is of spin-density-wave (SDW) type, or suddenly, as expected if the heavy electrons are abruptly localized by magnetism. Here we report measurements of the low-temperature Hall coefficient (R(H))--a measure of the Fermi surface volume--in the heavy-fermion metal YbRh2Si2 upon field-tuning it from an antiferromagnetic to a paramagnetic state. R(H) undergoes an increasingly rapid change near the QCP as the temperature is lowered, extrapolating to a sudden jump in the zero temperature limit. We interpret these results in terms of a collapse of the large Fermi surface and of the heavy-fermion state itself precisely at the QCP."
https://openalex.org/W2067865656,"Since the recognition of prokaryotes as essential components of the oceanic food web, bacterioplankton have been acknowledged as catalysts of most major biogeochemical processes in the sea. Studying heterotrophic bacterioplankton has been challenging, however, as most major clades have never been cultured or have only been grown to low densities in sea water. Here we describe the genome sequence of Silicibacter pomeroyi, a member of the marine Roseobacter clade (Fig. 1), the relatives of which comprise approximately 10-20% of coastal and oceanic mixed-layer bacterioplankton. This first genome sequence from any major heterotrophic clade consists of a chromosome (4,109,442 base pairs) and megaplasmid (491,611 base pairs). Genome analysis indicates that this organism relies upon a lithoheterotrophic strategy that uses inorganic compounds (carbon monoxide and sulphide) to supplement heterotrophy. Silicibacter pomeroyi also has genes advantageous for associations with plankton and suspended particles, including genes for uptake of algal-derived compounds, use of metabolites from reducing microzones, rapid growth and cell-density-dependent regulation. This bacterium has a physiology distinct from that of marine oligotrophs, adding a new strategy to the recognized repertoire for coping with a nutrient-poor ocean."
https://openalex.org/W1994470089,"Anionic water clusters have long been studied to infer properties of the bulk hydrated electron. We used photoelectron imaging to characterize a class of (H 2 O) n – and (D 2 O) n – cluster anions ( n ≤ 200 molecules) with vertical binding energies that are significantly lower than those previously recorded. The data are consistent with a structure in which the excess electron is bound to the surface of the cluster. This result implies that the excess electron in previously observed water-cluster anions, with higher vertical binding energies, was internally solvated. Thus, the properties of those clusters could be extrapolated to those of the bulk hydrated electron."

https://openalex.org/W2150594604,"We report data from the Cassini radio and plasma wave instrument during the approach and first orbit at Saturn. During the approach, radio emissions from Saturn showed that the radio rotation period is now 10 hours 45 minutes 45 Â± 36 seconds, about 6 minutes longer than measured by Voyager in 1980 to 1981. In addition, many intense impulsive radio signals were detected from Saturn lightning during the approach and first orbit. Some of these have been linked to storm systems observed by the Cassini imaging instrument. Within the magnetosphere, whistler-mode auroral hiss emissions were observed near the rings, suggesting that a strong electrodynamic interaction is occurring in or near the rings."
https://openalex.org/W1981263778,"Archean rocks may provide a record of early Earth environments. However, such rocks have often been metamorphosed by high pressure and temperature, which can overprint the signatures of their original formation. Here, we show that the early Archean banded rocks from Isua, Akilia, and Innersuartuut, Greenland, are enriched in heavy iron isotopes by 0.1 to 0.5 per mil per atomic mass unit relative to igneous rocks worldwide. The observed enrichments are compatible with the transport, oxidation, and subsequent precipitation of ferrous iron emanating from hydrothermal vents and thus suggest that the original rocks were banded iron formations (BIFs). These variations therefore support a sedimentary origin for the Akilia banded rocks, which represent one of the oldest known occurrences of water-laid deposits on Earth."
https://openalex.org/W2001369189,"The association between elevated plasma free fatty acid (FFA) concentrations and insulin resistance is well known. Although the cause and effect relationship between FFAs and insulin resistance is complex, plasma FFA is negatively correlated with the expression of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-γ cofactor-1 (PGC-1) and nuclear encoded mitochondrial genes. To test whether this association is causal, we infused a triglyceride emulsion (or saline as control) into healthy subjects to increase plasma FFA for 48 h followed by muscle biopsies, microarray analysis, quantitative real time PCR, and immunoblots. Lipid infusion increased plasma FFA concentration from 0.48 ± 0.02 to 1.73 ± 0.43 mm and decreased insulin-stimulated glucose disposal from 8.82 ± 0.69 to 6.67 ± 0.66 mg/kg·min, both with p < 0.05. PGC-1 mRNA, along with mRNAs for a number of nuclear encoded mitochondrial genes, were reduced by lipid infusion (p < 0.05). Microarray analysis also revealed that lipid infusion caused a significant overexpression of extracellular matrix genes and connective tissue growth factor. Quantitative reverse transcription PCR showed that the mRNA expression of collagens and multiple extracellular matrix genes was higher after the lipid infusion (p < 0.05). Immunoblot analysis revealed that lipid infusion also increased the expression of collagens and the connective tissue growth factor protein. These data suggest that an experimental increase in FFAs decreases the expression of PGC-1 and nuclear encoded mitochondrial genes and also increases the expression of extracellular matrix genes in a manner reminiscent of inflammation.

Although the concept that FFA and glucose compete with one another as oxidative fuels in skeletal muscle has withstood the test of time, more recent studies have shown that FFA and FFA metabolites inhibit insulin signaling (4Dresner A.

Studies using computerized tomography and magnetic resonance spectrometry techniques show a positive correlation between increased intramyocellular triglyceride content and insulin resistance (14Kelley D.E.

Stein D.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: E977-E989PubMed Google Scholar). However, those studies provide no information regarding the biochemical or molecular basis of insulin resistance. Recent studies have shown that there are pronounced patterns of change in skeletal muscle gene expression from insulin-resistant subjects (16Patti M.E. Butte A.J. Crunkhorn S. Cusi K. Berria R.

Diabetologia. 2002; 45: 1584-1593Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Because insulin-resistant subjects have chronic increases in plasma FFAs, it could be argued that chronic exposure to increased FFA might lead to changes in skeletal muscle gene expression that, in turn, could produce or contribute to insulin resistance. We (16Patti M.E. Butte A.J. Crunkhorn S. Cusi K. Berria R. Kashyap S. Miyazaki Y. Kohane I. Costello M. Saccone R. Landaker E.J. Goldfine A.B. Mun E. DeFronzo R. Finlayson J. Kahn C.R. Mandarino L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8466-8471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1634) Google Scholar) and others (17Mootha V.K. Lindgren C.M. Eriksson K.F. Subramanian A. Sihag S. Lehar J. Puigserver P.

Diabetologia. 2002; 45: 1584-1593Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) have found previously that insulin-resistant subjects had decreased expression of nuclear encoded mitochondrial genes accompanied by the decreased expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator-1 (PGC-1), the transcriptional coactivator that drives the expression of many genes coding for proteins in mitochondria. Moreover, PGC-1 expression is inversely correlated with plasma FFA concentrations (16Patti M.E. Butte A.J. Crunkhorn S. Cusi K. Berria R. Kashyap S. Miyazaki Y. Kohane I. Costello M. Saccone R. Landaker E.J. Goldfine A.B. Mun E. DeFronzo R. Finlayson J. Kahn C.R. Mandarino L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8466-8471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1634) Google Scholar). Therefore, we set out to test the hypothesis that an experimental increase in plasma FFA concentrations would reduce the expression of nuclear encoded mitochondrial genes along with their transcriptional coactivator PGC-1. Conducting this study using a global gene expression profiling allowed us to test this hypothesis and at the same time identify novel targets of increased FFA in skeletal muscle. Subjects—Seven normoglycemic, normal glucose-tolerant Mexican American subjects without a family history of diabetes took part in this study. All subjects had normal glucose tolerance, as assessed by a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test. Subjects received a history, physical examination, and screening blood tests to ensure that they were healthy. No subject was taking any medication known to affect glucose metabolism. All subjects gave informed written consent to participate in the study, which was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio. Study Design—Subjects were studied on two occasions separated by 3–4 weeks in random order, once with an infusion of Liposyn III (20% triglyceride emulsion largely composed of soybean oil) and once with saline as a control. Following an overnight fast, subjects reported to the General Clinical Research Center at 8 a.m., a forearm vein was catheterized, and either Liposyn III (60 ml/h) or saline was infused for 48 h. During this time, subjects were ambulatory and consumed a weight-maintaining (50% carbohydrate, 30% fat, and 20% protein) diet. After 48 h of lipid or saline infusion, an antecubital vein was catheterized, and a primed (25 μCi), continuous (0.25 μCi/min) infusion of [3-3H]glucose was begun to measure rates of glucose appearance and disappearance. A hand vein was catheterized and placed in a heated box to arterialize venous blood for the measurement of arterial glucose concentrations. One hour later, a percutaneous biopsy of the vastus lateralis muscle was performed as described previously (19Cusi K. Maezono K. Osman A. Pendergrass M. Patti M.E. Pratipanawatr T. DeFronzo R.A. Kahn C.R. Mandarino L.J. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 105: 311-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar). Biopsy specimens (75–150 mg) were frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen and stored in liquid nitrogen until they were processed. One hour after the muscle biopsy (2 h after the start of tritiated glucose), a primed continuous (80 milliunits/(m2·min)) insulin infusion was started and continued for 240 min to quantify the effects of insulin on glucose disposal (20DeFronzo R.A. Tobin J.D. Andres R. Am. J. Physiol. 1979; 237: E214-E223PubMed Google Scholar). Throughout the insulin infusion, an infusion of 20% glucose was adjusted to maintain euglycemia (20DeFronzo R.A. Tobin J.D. Andres R. Am. J. Physiol. 1979; 237: E214-E223PubMed Google Scholar). Muscle Biopsy Processing—For mRNA analyses, muscle biopsy specimens were homogenized directly in RNAStat solution (Tel-Test Inc., Friendswood, TX), using a Polytron homogenizer (Brinkmann Instruments Westbury, NY). RNA pellets were stored in ethanol/sodium chloride solution at –80 °C. Prior to use, total RNA was purified with RNeasy and DNase I treatment (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). For immunoblot analysis, detergent lysates of muscle were prepared as described previously (19Cusi K. Maezono K. Osman A. Pendergrass M. Patti M.E. Pratipanawatr T. DeFronzo R.A. Kahn C.R. Mandarino L.J. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 105: 311-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar). Microarray Analysis, Including Target Preparation, Hybridization, Staining, Scanning, and Analysis of Image—RNA was prepared for hybridization to Affymetrix (Santa Clara, CA) HG-U133A arrays according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA was used as a template for the synthesis of double-stranded cDNA (Superscript double-stranded cDNA synthesis kit; Invitrogen), which was used as a template for biotin-labeled cRNA synthesis (Enzo BioArray High Yield RNA transcription labeling kit; Affymetrix). Purified (RNeasy kit; Qiagen), fragmented (35–200 nucleotides), biotinylated cRNA was hybridized to HG-U133A GeneChips overnight for 16 h at 45 °C in a rotating incubator. Following hybridization, the probe arrays were washed and stained using the GeneChip Fluidics station protocol EukGE-ES2. The protocol consisted of non-stringent and stringent washes followed by a staining procedure whereby the hybridized cRNA was fluorescently labeled using anti-biotin antibodies and a streptavidin-phycoerythrin (SAPE) solution. The intensity of bound dye was measured with an argon laser confocal scanner (GeneArray scanner; Agilent). The probe arrays were scanned twice, and the stored images were aligned and analyzed using the GeneChip software Microarray Analysis Suite (MAS) 5.0 (Affymetrix). The present call by MAS 5.0 software was 26 ± 1.5% of total genes. The 3′/5′ glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and actin expression ratios were <3 (acceptable) for all but two chips; however, all chips yielded values for the spiked controls (BIOB, BIOC, BIOD, and CREX) that were within the acceptable range. Because all positive results were subsequently confirmed using quantitative real time PCR and/or immunoblot analysis, all chips were included in the analyses. Microarray Data Expression and Analysis—A flow diagram of the steps used in analysis of the microarray data is given in supplemental Fig. 1, which is available in the on-line version of this article. The Affymetrix data acquisition programs in MAS 5.0 automatically generate a cell intensity (CEL) file from the stored images that contain a single intensity value for each probe cell on the array. The CEL files were imported into the R software package (www.r-project.org), and the probe level data were converted to expression measures using the Affy package (21Bolstad B.M. Irizarry R.A. Astrand M. Speed T.P. Bioinformatics. 2003; 19: 185-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (6463) Google Scholar) from Bioconductor. Expression values for each mRNA were obtained by the Robust Multi-array Analysis (RMA) method of Irizarry (1Irizarry R.A. Hobbs B. Collin F. Beazer-Barclay Y.D. Antonellis K.J. Scherf U. Speed T.P. Biostatistics. 2003; 4: 249-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (8516) Google Scholar), which adjusts for the background on the raw intensity scale, carries out a non-linear quantile normalization of the perfect match values, log transforms the background-adjusted perfect match values, and carries out a robust multi-chip analysis of the quantile normalized log transformed values (1Irizarry R.A. Hobbs B. Collin F. Beazer-Barclay Y.D. Antonellis K.J. Scherf U. Speed T.P. Biostatistics. 2003; 4: 249-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (8516) Google Scholar). CEL files were normalized together, and the expression values obtained were submitted to analysis with the Statistical Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) software (22Tusher V.G. Tibshirani R. Chu G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5116-5121Crossref PubMed Scopus (9802) Google Scholar) to identify those genes that were significantly increased or decreased. The expression values also were assembled into “gene sets” for analysis (supplemental Table II, available in the on-line version of this article), similar to that described by Mootha et al. (17Mootha V.K. Lindgren C.M. Eriksson K.F. Subramanian A. Sihag S. Lehar J. Puigserver P. Carlsson E. Ridderstrale M. Laurila E. Houstis N. Daly M.J. Patterson N. Mesirov J.P. Golub T.R. Tamayo P. Spiegelman B. Lander E.S. Hirschhorn J.N. Altshuler D. Groop L.C. Nat. Genet. 2003; 34: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (6274) Google Scholar). In particular, our gene set analysis approach was based on the comparison of statistics comprised of the sum of the average differences (lipid minus saline) for each gene in a particular set divided by the variance of the average differences. The method is briefly described here. Assume a set consisting of N genes, with n subjects studied under each of two conditions. For gene j, the mean difference in expression (dj) for that gene between conditions 1 and 2 is given by Equation 1, dj=(∑i=1n(X2i−X1i))n (Eq. 1) where X1i is the expression value for subject 1, condition 1, for instance. Then, as shown in Equation 2, M=∑i=1Ndis2 (Eq. 2) the sum of the average differences in gene expression across all of the genes in the set (normalized for the variance, s2, of the average differences) is the statistic M. In the case where X1i = X2i (that is, there is no difference in gene expression between conditions 1 and 2 for all i and j) the value of M will be 0. In practice, M is calculated for each gene set based on the observed expression values for the genes in that set. An empirical distribution of expected M values for a given gene set is then derived by selecting a subset of N genes randomly 10,000 times from the entire number of genes called “present” by MAS 5.0 software. The observed M for the gene set is then compared with the distribution of expected values to determine statistical significance. The gene sets used in the analysis either were annotated previously (17Mootha V.K. Lindgren C.M. Eriksson K.F. Subramanian A. Sihag S. Lehar J. Puigserver P. Carlsson E. Ridderstrale M. Laurila E. Houstis N. Daly M.J. Patterson N. Mesirov J.P. Golub T.R. Tamayo P. Spiegelman B. Lander E.S. Hirschhorn J.N. Altshuler D. Groop L.C. Nat. Genet. 2003; 34: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (6274) Google Scholar) or independently in our laboratory. A separate analysis, including gene normalization to specific samples, was conducted with GeneSpring 5.1 software (Silicon Genetics, CA) using the CHP file generated in the MAS 5.0 software. The CHP file is an output file generated from the analysis of each probe array. Filtering tools in the GeneSpring software were used to identify significantly up-regulated and down-regulated genes affected by the lipid infusion. Quantitative TaqMan Real Time PCR (Q-RT-PCR)—Muscle expression of various genes was determined using the one-step Q-RT-PCR from the total RNA used for the microarray analysis. Q-RT-PCR was performed on the ABI PRISM 7900HT sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using TaqMan One Step RT-PCR Master Mix reagents and the Assay On Demand gene expression primer pair and probes (Applied Biosystems). To determine the efficiencies of each primer pair and probe set, a standard curve was generated by serial dilution of an RNA sample taken from a healthy subject. Each sample was run in duplicate, and the mean value of the duplicate was used to calculate the mRNA expression of the gene of interest and an endogenous control. The quantity of the gene of interest in each sample was normalized to that of 18 S ribosomal RNA using the comparative (2–ΔΔct) method (23Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (127155) Google Scholar). Statistical comparisons were done using paired t tests. Immunoblot Analysis and Immunofluorescence Staining—Detergent lysates of muscle biopsies were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as described (19Cusi K. Maezono K. Osman A. Pendergrass M. Patti M.E. Pratipanawatr T. DeFronzo R.A. Kahn C.R. Mandarino L.J. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 105: 311-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar). Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and the membranes were probed with various antibodies. Membranes were developed using Western Lightning reagents (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and digitized and quantified using a VersaDoc 5000 imaging system (Bio-Rad). Monoclonal antibodies directed against collagens and procollagens were a generous gift of Dr. Nirmala SundarRaj at the University of Pittsburgh. Rabbit anti-connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) antibody was obtained from Torrey Pines Biolabs (Houston, TX). Five-micrometer frozen sections of muscle biopsy specimens were probed using anti-collagen I and collagen III monoclonal antibodies (gift of Dr. SundarRaj), each at a dilution of 1:500. After exposure to fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG, images were digitized using Spot v.3.5 software (Diagnostic Instruments, Inc., Sterling Heights, MI). Statistical comparisons were done using paired t tests. Other Analyses—Plasma insulin and FFA concentrations were determined by radioimmunoassay (Diagnostic Products, Los Angeles, CA) and enzymatic kit (NEFA-C, Wako Pure Chemicals, Osaka, Japan), respectively. Plasma samples were deproteinized by the Somogyi method for the calculation of glucose-specific activity, which was used to calculate the rates of glucose metabolism (20DeFronzo R.A. Tobin J.D. Andres R. Am. J. Physiol. 1979; 237: E214-E223PubMed Google Scholar). The statistical significance of difference between means for in vivo data was determined using paired or non-paired Student's t tests where appropriate (see above for statistical analysis of microarray data). Subject Characteristics and in Vivo Data—Seven healthy subjects (three men and four women) with a mean (±S.E.) age of 43 ± 6 years and a body mass index of 24.5 ± 1.3 kg/m2 participated in the study. The fasting plasma glucose concentration was within the normal range at 92 ± 2 mg/dl. Each subject had a normal oral glucose tolerance and was studied on two occasions with 48 h of Liposyn III (60 ml/hr) or saline control infusion. Plasma FFA concentration (0.48 ± 0.02 mm) after saline increased to 1.73 ± 0.43 mm after lipid infusion (p < 0.01). Fasting plasma insulin concentrations were 4 ± 1 microunits/ml after saline and 5 ± 1 microunits/ml after lipid infusion. Basal rates of glucose appearance did not differ between the saline and lipid studies (1.92 ± 0.12 versus 2.07 ± 0.09 mg/(kg·min); p = 0.09). After 48 h of lipid or saline infusion, subjects received a 4-h euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp (80 milliunits/m2·min) with tritiated glucose. Steady state plasma insulin concentrations during insulin infusion were similar in the saline and lipid infusion studies (107 ± 4 versus 108 ± 5 μunits/ml). After saline, insulin increased the rate of glucose disposal to 8.82 ± 0.69 mg/(kg·min). Lipid infusion decreased the rate of insulin-stimulated glucose disposal to 6.67 ± 0.66 mg/(kg·min); p = 0.005. During the saline study, insulin completely suppressed endogenous glucose production to –0.46 ± 0.17 mg/(kg·min). After the lipid infusion, there was a tendency for reduced suppression of endogenous glucose production (0.19 ± 0.33 mg/(kg·min); p = 0.06 versus saline). Gene Set Expression Analysis—The present study was undertaken in part to test the hypothesis that an experimental increase in plasma lipids decreased the expression of nuclear encoded mitochondrial genes. Accordingly, using gene set analysis we tested whether sets of such genes were decreased in muscle after the lipid infusion. The gene expression values obtained using the Robust Multi-array Analysis method were analyzed in the gene set analysis as described under “Materials and Methods.” A number of gene sets were significantly (p < 0.05) decreased in expression after the lipid infusion (Table I). Gene set analysis revealed a significant decrease in the mitochondria_HG-U133A set of nuclear encoded mitochondrial genes. To support this observation, the c20_mitochondrial gene set, which includes a set of co-regulated genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation, also yielded significance. In addition, the uncoupling protein gene set was significantly decreased in response to the experimental increase in lipids.Table IGene sets significantly decreased in expression by lipid infusion (p < 0.05)Gene SetsMitochondria_HG-U133A_probesc20_Mitochondrial gene setUncoupling proteinsHypothetical proteinsNuclear receptorProgesteroneMAP00550_peptidoglycan_biosynthesisMAP00630_glyoxylate_and_dicarboxylate_metabolismMAP00910_nitrogen_metabolismc19_Protein biosynthesis gene setc30_Cell motility and DNA binding gene set Open table in a new tab Global gene expression profiling also allowed us to test the hypothesis that the expression of other, perhaps unpredicted genes would be changed by a lipid infusion and the consequent increase in plasma FFA. A number of gene sets significantly increased in expression following the lipid infusion including, among others, the collagen, fibronectin, and c7_extracellular matrix gene set (Table II). Also significantly increased were the GLUCO_HG-U133A set of gluconeogenesis genes and the FA_BIO_HG-U133A set, which include the fatty acid biosynthesis genes.Table IIGene sets significantly increased in expression by lipid infusion (p < 0.05)Gene SetsCollagenFibronectinc7_Extracellular matrix gene setDecarboxylaseProstaglandinProteasomeFa_Bio_HG-U133A_probesGluco_HG-U133A_probesGlycol_HG-U133A_probesMAP00010_glycolysis_gluconeogenesisMAP00040_pentose_and_glucuronate_interconversionsMAP00052_galactose_metabolismMAP00450_selenoamino_acid_metabolismMAP00472_d_arginine_and_d_ornithine_metabolismMAP00522_erythromycin_biosynthesisMAP00590_prostaglandin_and_leukotriene_metabolismMAP00600_sphingoglycolipid_metabolismMAP00710_carbon_fixationMAP00970_aminoacyl_tRNA_biosynthesisc18_Regulation of transcription gene set Open table in a new tab Single Gene Expression Analysis—Expression values obtained using the Robust Multi-array Analysis method and analyzed using SAM revealed a number of genes that were significantly increased or decreased. Likewise, the GeneSpring software also identified a number of differentially expressed genes. Lipid infusion significantly increased the expression of 198 individual genes using SAM and 90 genes with GeneSpring analysis (specific genes differentially expressed are given in supplemental Table I, a and b). Of the 198 genes increased in expression using SAM, 34 were concordant with results from the GeneSpring analysis (Table III). Many of these increasers were genes coding for extracellular matrix proteins including collagens, fibronectin, lumican, thrombospondin, and proteoglycans.Table IIIConcordant individual genes with increased expression after lipid infusionGene nameaThe word “concordant” in the title is defined as having expression levels increased using both SAM and GeneSpring analysis.Gene symbolChromosomeFold changeSAMGeneSpringMatrix metalloproteinase 2MMP216q13-q211.4>1.5LegumainLGMN14q32.11.2>1.5Disabled homolog 2, mitogen-responsive phosphoproteinDAB25p131.2>1.5Collagen, type VI, α3COL6A32q372.7>1.5LumicanLUM12q21.3-q222.5>1.5Collagen, type III, α1COL3A12q3112.3>1.5OGT-interacting protein, 106 kDaOIP1063p25.3-p24.11.1Collagen, type I, α1COL1A117q21.3-q22.19.3>1.5Collagen, type I, α2COL1A27q22.13.7>1.5Collagen, t"

https://openalex.org/W2025403494,"The iron-regulatory proteins (IRPs) posttranscriptionally regulate expression of transferrin receptor, ferritin, and other iron metabolism proteins. Although both IRPs can regulate expression of the same target genes, IRP2 –/– mice significantly misregulate iron metabolism and develop neurodegeneration, whereas IRP1 –/– mice are spared. We found that IRP2 –/– cells misregulated iron metabolism when cultured in 3 to 6% oxygen, which is comparable to physiological tissue concentrations, but not in 21% oxygen, a concentration that activated IRP1 and allowed it to substitute for IRP2. Thus, IRP2 dominates regulation of mammalian iron homeostasis because it alone registers iron concentrations and modulates its RNA-binding activity at physiological oxygen tensions."

https://openalex.org/W1991231925,"Loss-of-function mutations in the parkin gene, which encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase, are the major cause of early-onset Parkinson's disease (PD). Decreases in parkin activity may also contribute to neurodegeneration in sporadic forms of PD. Here, we show that bcl-2-associated athanogene 5 (BAG5), a BAG family member, directly interacts with parkin and the chaperone Hsp70. Within this complex, BAG5 inhibits both parkin E3 ubiquitin ligase activity and Hsp70-mediated refolding of misfolded proteins. BAG5 enhances parkin sequestration within protein aggregates and mitigates parkin-dependent preservation of proteasome function. Finally, BAG5 enhances dopamine neuron death in an in vivo model of PD, whereas a mutant that inhibits BAG5 activity attenuates dopaminergic neurodegeneration. This contrasts with the antideath functions ascribed to BAG family members and suggests a potential role for BAG5 in promoting neurodegeneration in sporadic PD through its functional interactions with parkin and Hsp70."

https://openalex.org/W2143082806,"Chemokines, signaling through the CCR2 receptor, are highly expressed in injured skeletal muscle. Their target specificity depends on the cellular expression of the specific receptors. Here we demonstrate that, in freeze-injured muscle, CCR2 co-localized with Mac-3, a marker of activated macrophages as well as with myogenin, a marker of activated muscle precursor cells. The degeneration/regeneration process in skeletal muscle of CCR2-/- and wild-type mice was not significantly different at day 3. However in contrast to the regenerated muscle of the wild-type mice, the muscle from CCR2-/- mice was characterized by impaired regeneration, inflammation, and fibrotic response at day 14, increased fat infiltration, fibrosis, and calcification at day 21, and impaired strength recovery until at least 28 days post-injury. Consistently, the increased expression of Mac-1 and TNF-alpha was prolonged in the injured muscle of CCR2-/- mice. The expression pattern of the myogenic factors MyoD and myogenin was similar for both types of mice, while NCAM, which is associated with the initiation of fusion of muscle precursor cells, was more increased in the injured muscle of CCR2-/- mice. In conclusion, the study delineates that signaling through CCR2 is involved in muscle precursor cell activities necessary for complete and rapid regeneration of injured skeletal muscle."

The de-orphaning of olfactory receptor (OR) is complicated by its combinatorial odorant coding and thus requires large scale odorant and receptor screening and establishing receptor-specific odorant profiles. Here, we report on the stable reconstitution of OR-specific signaling in HeLa/Olf cells via G protein αolf and adenylyl cyclase type-III to the Ca2+ influx-mediating olfactory cyclic nucleotide-gated CNGA2 channel. We demonstrate the central role of Gαolf in odorant-specific signaling out of OR. The employment of the non-typical G protein α15 dramatically altered the odorant specificities of 3 of 7 receptors that had been characterized previously by different groups. We further show for two OR that an odorant may be an agonist or antagonist, depending on the G protein used. HeLa/Olf cells proved suitable for high-throughput screening in fluorescence-imaging plate reader experiments, resulting in the de-orphaning of two new OR for the odorant (-)citronellal from an expression library of 93 receptors. To demonstrate the G protein dependence of its odorant response pattern, we screened the most sensitive (-)citronellal receptor Olfr43 versus 94 odorants simultaneously in the presence of Gα15 or Gαolf. We finally established an EC50-ranking odorant profile for Olfr43 in HeLa/Olf cells. In summary, we conclude that, in heterologous systems, odorants may function as agonists or antagonists, depending on the G protein used.

Heterologously expressed OR can trigger odorant-induced cAMP signaling (9Kajiya K. Inaki K. Tanaka M. Haga T. Kataoka H. Touhara K. J.

Thus far, however, the functional genomics of OR were hampered by the absence of a generally applicable cell system to study recombinant OR in their olfactory-specific Gαolf/AC type-III/cAMP (18Reed R.R. Neuron. 1992; 8: 205-209Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) signaling background. Here, we demonstrate stable expression of canonical olfactory signal transduction molecules together with individual OR in the human HeLa/Olf cell line. This allows odorant/OR-activated intracellular cAMP signaling as well as cyclic nucleotide-induced Ca2+ influx through CNGA2 that can be monitored with conventional single-cell and high-throughput Ca2+ -imaging methods. We demonstrate the central role of G protein αolf and show evidence for G protein-dependent and ligand-selective agonism and antagonism of odorants at OR. Molecular Cloning—The 93 chimeric OR tested here were taken from a collection of chimeric OR (10Krautwurst D. Yau K.W. Reed R.R. Cell. 1998; 95: 917-926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar) but were exclusive of the 80 OR that had been tested in that study. cDNA encoding the bovine olfactory CNGA2 channel (BTCAMPGC, X55010) was inserted into the vector pcDNA3.1/Zeo(+). To obtain the coding region of the olfactory human guanine nucleotide-binding G protein α (hGαolf, GNAL: GenBank™ accession number NM002071), we first isolated total RNA from human surgical olfactory epithelium biopsies with TRIzol (Invitrogen) and we then isolated mRNA with Micro-FastTrack 2.0 (Invitrogen) and synthesized first-strand cDNA using ImProm-II (Promega) reverse transcriptase. We PCR-amplified and subcloned hGαolf into the cytomegalovirus promoter-driven expression cassette pi2-dk based on plasmid pIRES2-EGFP (Clontech) but lacking the DNA coding for an internal ribosome entry site and the enhanced green fluorescent protein part. We subcloned Gα15 (Gna15, GenBank™ accession number NM010304) and mOR912-93 (Olfr154) from their original plasmids (for pBSG15, see Ref. 19Offermanns S. Simon M.I. J. Biol.

We PCR-amplified the full-length coding regions of Ors6 (GenBank™ accession number NM020289), Ors86 (Olfr586, GenBank™ accession number NM147111), and Olfr43 (GenBank™ accession number XM111129) from mouse (C57BL/6J) genomic DNA with Pfu (Promega) or PfuUltra (Stratagene). Amplicons were subcloned into pi2-dk(Rho-tag(39)). This expression vector provides the first 39 amino acids of the bovine rhodopsin (Rho-tag(39)) as an N-terminal tag for all of the full-length OR. We cloned the full-length coding region of mouse Olfr49 (I-C6, GenBank™ accession number NM010991), mouse and rat Olfr41 (mI7, GenBank™ accession number NM010983; rI7, GenBank™ accession number NM_031710) (10Krautwurst D. Yau K.W. Reed R.R.

The identities of all of the subcloned amplicons were verified by sequencing (UKEHH, Hamburg, Germany) (for details and primer sequences, see supplemental material). Cell culture and Transient DNA Transfection—All of the cell culture media, ingredients, and antibiotics were obtained from Invitrogen with the exception for G418 sulfate (Calbiochem) and puromycin (Sigma). HeLa cells were grown in standard DMEM with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in a humidified atmosphere (37 °C, 5% CO2). Before transfection, cells were seeded in black wall/clear bottom 96-well plates (Molecular Devices) for FLIPR, coated with poly-d-lysine (10 μg/ml), and cultured to a preconfluent monolayer. Cells were transfected with DNA using lipofection (PolyFect, Qiagen) and, 40 h posttransfection, the cells were taken into experiments (for stable cell lines, see supplemental material). Usually, ∼5% OR-transfected cells show a signal in anti-Rho-tag immunocytochemistry. However, 10-40% cells usually respond in single-cell Ca2+-imaging experiments, presumably because of coupling of cells via Cx-43. Stable Cell Lines: Establishment of the HeLa/CNGA2 Cell Line—The HeLa-Cx43 cell line expressing Cx-43 (20Elfgang C. Eckert R. Lichtenberg-Frate H. Butterweck A. Traub O. Klein R.A. Hulser D.F. Willecke K. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar) was cultured in standard DMEM supplemented with 1 μg/ml puromycin. For transfection, cDNA encoding the bovine olfactory CNGA2 subunit (BTCAMPGC, X55010 (21Ludwig J. Margalit T. Eismann E. Lancet D. Kaupp U.B. FEBS Lett. 1990; 270: 24-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar)) was inserted into the vector pcDNA3.1/Zeo(+). HeLa-Cx43 transfectants were stably transfected by lipofection (Tfx-50 Reagent, Promega). 48 h posttransfection, 100 μg/ml zeocin was added to the medium. Clones were picked after 3-4 weeks and grown under selective conditions. The presence of Cx-43 proved beneficial for obtaining clones that stably express the wild-type homomeric olfactory CNGA2 channel. 3P. Bedner and K. Willecke, unpublished observation. Cx-43 is expressed in OSN and passes second messengers such as inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, Ca2+, and cyclic nucleotides. In HeLa cells that are connected by Cx43, a noxious overload by Ca2+ of individual cells may be prevented, thus increasing the number of surviving stable transfectants. Thus we refrained from using a mutant homomeric CNGA2 channel that was described to have a similar low EC50 for cAMP as the heteromeric wild-type channel. An increased sensitivity for cyclic nucleotides may result in an increased resting conductance of CNG channels, which in the long run might lead to noxious Ca2+ concentrations, hampering the establishment of stable cell lines (for reference to Cx-43 and CNGA2, see supplemental material). Establishment of the HeLa/CNGA2/Rho-tag(39)-Olfr49 (HeLa/Olfr49), HeLa/CNGA2/hGαolf (HeLa/Olf), and HeLa/CNGA2/Gα15 (HeLa/15) Cell Lines—Before transfection with Olfr49 or hGαolf, cells were plated in 100-mm dishes at a density of 1.6 × 106 cells and incubated overnight. HeLa/CNGA2 cells were transfected with expression plasmids carrying the coding regions for Rho-tag(39)-Olfr49, hGαolf, or Gα15 by calcium phosphate precipitation. HeLa/Olfr49 cells, HeLa/Olf cells, and HeLa/15 cells were then obtained by selection of clonal populations, resistant to 800 μg/ml G418 and responsive to (-)citronellal, or isoproterenol, respectively, and confirmed by RT-PCR or immunocytochemistry. Clonal lines were maintained in standard DMEM supplemented with puromycin (1 μg/ml), zeocin (100 μg/ml), and G418 (400 μg/ml). We observed stable expression of hGαolf or Gα15 up to passage 10 (HeLa/Olf cells and HeLa/15 cells) or passage 15 for Rho-tag(39)-Olfr49 (HeLa/Olfr49 cells). Single-Cell Ca2+ Imaging—Odorant/OR-induced changes in the intracellular concentration of cyclic nucleotides modulate a Ca2+-influx through CNGA2 that can be monitored in Ca2+-imaging experiments. Single-cell Ca2+-imaging was performed as described previously (10Krautwurst D. Yau K.W. Reed R.R. Cell. 1998; 95: 917-926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar) but with the following modifications. We used the monochromator-based Till Photonics imaging system in combination with an inverted Olympus IX50 microscope equipped with a UApo/340 ×40 1.35 oil immersion lens. 40 h posttransfection, cells were loaded (1 h/37 °C) with 4 μm Fura-2/AM (Molecular Probes) in serum-free DMEM and transferred into a bath chamber with a HBS (140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm glucose, pH 7.4). Fluorescence from single cells was monitored in 10-s intervals at an emission wavelength of 515 nm after excitation (3-15 ms) with 340 and 380 nm and ratios calculated (F340/F380). Images of the cells were monitored by an intensified cooled CCD camera and analyzed off-line. We applied isoproterenol (10 μm) at the end of each experiment to stimulate endogenous β-AR, proving that the G protein-dependent signal transduction cascade was functional. Odorants (Supplemental Table 2), poly-d-lysine, probenecid, salts, buffers, and db-cAMP (membrane-permeable, used at 1 mm) were from Sigma. Thapsigargin (BioTrend/Tocris; 1 μm, 30 min) blocked receptor-mediated Ca2+ release from inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-sensitive internal stores (22Thastrup O. Dawson A.P. Scharff O. Foder B. Cullen P.J. Drobak B.K. Bjerrum P.J. Christensen S.B. Hanley M.R. Agents Actions. 1994; 43: 187-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Bath application of 1 mm EGTA (Sigma) blocked Ca2+ influx. Ca2+-FLIPR Assay—Cells were loaded with 4 μm FLUO-4/AM and 0.04% Pluronic F-127 (both from Molecular Probes) in HBS (see above) but with 20 mm HEPES and 2.5 mm probenecid. After loading, cells were washed twice with HBS by an automated plate washer (Denley Cellwash, Labsystems) and transferred to the FLIPR (Molecular Devices). The FLIPR integrates an argon laser excitation source, a 96-well pipettor, and a detection system utilizing a CCD imaging camera. Equipment for the FLIPR system was obtained from Molecular Devices. 50 μl of 3× concentrated agonists were delivered within 2 s simultaneously to all of the wells containing 100 μl of HBS. Fluorescence emissions from the 96-wells were monitored simultaneously at an emission wavelength of 515 nm after excitation with 488 nm (F488). Fluorescence data were collected at 0.25 Hertz, 48 s before and 5-10 min after stimulation, and analyzed off-line. Data Analysis—In the FLIPR-screening experiments, agonist response amplitudes were determined from the peak-stimulated fluorescence of the solvent control- or mock-transfected-substracted and base-line-corrected traces and averaged over 4-5 wells expressing the same receptor and receiving the same stimulus. For control, we applied each odorant concentration to mock-transfected cells. EC50 values and curves were derived from fitting the function f(x) = (a - d)/(1 + (x/C)nH) + d to the data by non-linear regression with a = minimum, d = maximum, C = EC50, and nH = Hill coefficient. Immunocytochemistry—Plasma membrane expression of N-terminally tagged Rho-tag(39)-OR was assessed using the primary anti-rhodopsin antibody B6-30 (1:1000, 1 h at room temperature or 4 °C overnight) (10Krautwurst D. Yau K.W. Reed R.R. Cell. 1998; 95: 917-926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar) in goat serum-blocked cells (5%, 30 min) and non-permeabilized (4% fresh paraformaldehyde, 15 min at room temperature) and permeabilized (4% fresh paraformaldehyde, 15 min at room temperature, acetone/methanol 1:1, -20 °C, 3 min) cells. 2% serum was present throughout. Labeled OR protein was visualized using an Alexa-488-coupled secondary antibody (1:200, goat-anti-mouse, Molecular Probes) and confocal microscopy (Leica TCS SP2 Laser Scan, 100× HCX PL APO oil immersion). cAMP Assay—HeLa/CNGA2/Rho-tag(39)-Olfr49 cells (106 cells/well in 6-well plates) were used as non-transfected or were transfected with 1.5 μg of rat Gαolf or rat Gαs DNA using PolyFect. After 40 h, cells were preincubated with IBMX (Calbiochem), a blocker of phosphodiesterase (100 μm, 30 min), and exposed to (-)citronellal or isoproterenol (2 min). The cAMP levels were assayed with the 125I-labeled cAMP assay system (Amersham Biosciences) in triplicate determinations. Values are given as fold stimulation over basal. Western Blot Analysis—Crude membrane preparations of HeLa/CNGA2 and HeLa/Olf cells were cholate-extracted (1%) in the presence of 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 2 μg/ml pepstatin A (all from Sigma). 19 μg of protein of each preparation were run in 11% SDS-PAGE and blotted onto nitrocellulose using a Sammy Dry Blotter (Schleicher & Schüll). Blots were blocked and incubated 2 h with a polyclonal anti-Gαs antibody (C-18, Santa-Cruz Biotechnology, 1:200), which is directed against the C-terminal amino acids and also recognizes Gαolf. Chemiluminescence of peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody (anti-rabbit IgG, 1.5 h) was visualized by Hyperfilm-ECL exposure (7 min). [35S]GTPγS Binding Assay—HeLa/15 cells and HeLa/Olf cells were grown in a 10-cm dish and transfected with 6 μg of Ors6 plasmid or empty vector using PolyFect. After 42 h, cells were harvested by manual scraping and the [35S]GTPγS binding assay was performed as described by Bidlack and Parkhill (23Bidlack J.M. Parkhill A.L. Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 237: 135-143PubMed Google Scholar) with modifications. The membrane protein concentration was 80 μg per experiment, and the agonist stimulation was measured as triplicates in a Beckmann scintillation counter “LS6500.” The Whatman GF/B glass fiber filters were shortly preincubated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, 10% polyethylene glycol, 10 mm MgCl2, pH 7,4. Basal [35S]GTPγS binding was determined in the absence of an agonist. The nonspecific binding was subtracted, and the basal value was set at 100%. We initially established the human HeLa/CNGA2 cell line stably expressing Cx-43 (20Elfgang C. Eckert R. Lichtenberg-Frate H. Butterweck A. Traub O. Klein R.A. Hulser D.F. Willecke K. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar) and the olfactory homomeric CNGA2 channel (21Ludwig J. Margalit T. Eismann E. Lancet D. Kaupp U.B. FEBS Lett. 1990; 270: 24-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) as a Ca2+-influx reporter for receptor-induced changes in the concentration of intracellular cyclic nucleotides. The presence of Cx-43 proved to be beneficial for obtaining stable transfectants for CNGA2. We confirmed the expression of mRNA for the CNGA2 channel in HeLa/CNGA2 cells by RT-PCR (Fig. 1) and functional expression of CNGA2 in single-cell Ca2+-imaging experiments (Fig. 2a, left panel, and d and e).Fig. 2OR signaling stably reconstituted in HeLa/CNGA2 cells. a, left panel, single-cell Ca2+ imaging of Fura-2-loaded HeLa/CNGA2 cells stimulated with db-cAMP.

All of the differences in cAMP production are significant at p < 0.05. Data are means ± S.D. from two independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A further characterization of HeLa/CNGA2 cells by RT-PCR revealed endogenous expression of mRNA for ACIII, ACVI, ACVII, and ACIX from the nine known ACs (Fig. 1) as well as for Gαs but not Gαolf (Fig. 3a). In these cells, the β-AR agonist isoproterenol was not able to induce a β-AR-stimulated Ca2+ influx (Fig. 2c, left panel). However, when we transfected HeLa/CNGA2 cells with DNA coding for G proteins αs or αolf, isoproterenol elicited a Ca2+ influx that could be antagonized with EGTA (Fig. 2, d and e, left panels). To study OR/odorant-induced cAMP signaling and Ca2+-influx, we established stable and functional expression in HeLa/CNGA2 cells of Rho-tag(39)-Olfr49 (HeLa/Olfr49) (Fig. 2, b-e, right panels) for which (-)citronellal has been identified as a cognate odorant (10Krautwurst D. Yau K.W. Reed R.R. Cell. 1998; 95: 917-926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). We observed a receptor-dependent and (-)citronellal-induced Ca2+ influx in HeLa/Olfr49 cells that were transfected with DNA coding for either G protein αolf or G protein αs (Fig. 2, d and e, right panels). (-)Citronellal did not induce Ca2+ signals in HeLa/CNGA2 cells lacking Rho-tag(39)-Olfr49 (Fig. 2a, right panel) or cells that were not transfected with G proteins αolf or αs (Fig. 2c, right panel). We compared the efficacy of both G proteins in OR and β-AR signaling in HeLa/Olfr49 cells, employing a cAMP assay (Fig. 2f). The isoproterenol-induced cAMP production was higher in cells transfected with Gαs, whereas the (-)citronellal-induced cAMP production was higher in Gαolf-transfected cells. These results indicated first that an overexpression of signal transducing G protein appears necessary for functional OR expression in HeLa/CNGA2 cells and second that an odorant/OR-induced cAMP production was most efficient in Gαolf-transfected cells. Therefore, we established stable expression of human Gαolf in HeLa/CNGA2 cells (HeLa/Olf). As a result, the amount of Gαolf/Gαs was ∼2.5-fold higher in HeLa/Olf cells as compared with the endogenous Gαs level in HeLa/CNGA2 cells (Fig. 3). At the level of OR-odorant interaction, combinatorial coding is commonly accepted as inferred from often broadly tuned OSN (3Malnic B. Hirono J. Sato T. Buck L.B.

Senses. 2003; 28: 87-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) of the two comprehensive studies that deduced OR sequences from hundreds of single-cell RT-PCR experiments with mouse OSN that had responded to a chemically related set of odorants. Neither of these studies used the deduced OR sequences to confirm the odorant responsiveness of their gene products by means of EC50-ranking odorant profiles in functional expression studies. For two of the deduced putative OR, Ors6, and Ors86, we now have determined EC50 values in HeLa/Olf cells for their specific agonists, nonanedioic acid and nonanoic acid, respectively (Figs. 4 and 5 and Table 1), that reflect their odorant specificities as observed in OSN (see Table 1) (3Malnic B.

https://openalex.org/W2074369446,"The androgen receptor (AR) activates target gene expression in the presence of agonist ligands via the recruitment of transcriptional coactivators, but recent work shows that overexpression of the nuclear corepressors NCoR and SMRT attenuates this agonist-mediated AR activation. Here we demonstrate using NCoR siRNA and chromatin immunoprecipitation that endogenous NCoR is recruited to and represses the dihydrotestosterone (DHT)-liganded AR. Furthermore this study shows that NCoR and coactivators compete for AR in the presence of DHT. AR antagonists such as bicalutamide that are currently in use for prostate cancer treatment can also mediate NCoR recruitment, but mifepristone (RU486) at nanomolar concentrations is unique in its ability to markedly enhance the AR-NCoR interaction. The RU486-liganded AR interacted with a C-terminal fragment of NCoR, and this interaction was mediated by the two most C-terminal nuclear receptor interacting domains (RIDs) present in NCoR. Significantly, in addition to the AR ligand binding domain, the AR N terminus was also required for this interaction. Mutagenesis studies demonstrate that the N-terminal surface of the AR-mediating NCoR recruitment was distinct from tau5 and from the FXXLF motif that mediates agonist-induced N-C-terminal interaction. Taken together these data demonstrate that NCoR is a physiological regulator of the AR and reveal a new mechanism for AR antagonism that may be exploited for the development of more potent AR antagonists.

In addition, AR action plays a fundamental role in the development and progression of prostate cancer (1Catalona W.J. N. Engl. J. Med. 1994; 331: 996-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 2Brinkmann A.O. Blok L.J. de Ruiter P.E. Doesburg P. Steketee K. Berrevoets C.A. Trapman J. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol.

Prostate cancers are initially androgen responsive such that targeted therapies aimed at lowering circulating androgen levels are the treatment of choice for metastatic disease. In most cases, however, the disease becomes progressive and unresponsive to androgen ablation therapies. This progressive stage of the disease, referred to as hormone refractory or androgen-independent prostate cancer, is generally heralded by the re-expression of androgen-regulated genes such as prostate-specific antigen (PSA). AR gene amplification or mutations may contribute to this re-expression of androgen-regulated genes, but it occurs mainly through undefined molecular mechanisms that allow for AR signaling in the absence of ligand or at reduced systemic androgen levels (4Culig Z.

Thus, new approaches to silence AR signaling may have important therapeutic ramifications for the therapy of both early and late stage prostate cancer.Members of the steroid receptor superfamily signal in a similar fashion based on their structural similarity (9Mangelsdorf D.J.

The addition of an agonist ligand leads initially to the DNA binding of the receptor, followed by the ordered recruitment of both transcriptional coactivators and other mediators to the ligand binding domain. This leads to histone modifications including acetylation, and finally to transcriptional activation (10Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 121-141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, in the presence of a hormone antagonist, steroid receptors fail to recruit coactivators. Moreover, certain antagonists preferentially stimulate the recruitment of nuclear receptor corepressors to target promoters, which in turn recruit a multiprotein complex that leads to histone deacetylation and transcriptional repression (11Brzozowski A.M.

However the AR differs in the molecular mechanisms by which it recruits both coactivators and corepressors. Unlike other family members, the ligand-binding domain of the AR preferentially recruits its own AF-1 domain via an N-terminal FXXLF motif, which interacts strongly with the hydrophobic cleft of the LBD created by ligand binding (15Wong C.I.

J. 2004; 379: 731-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) have shown that the agonist-liganded AR can recruit the corepressors NCoR and SMRT, suggesting that agonist-dependent activation of the AR may be dependent upon the relative levels of these corepressors versus coactivators.Besides the physiological agonists testosterone and DHT, the AR can also interact with many other steroidal or nonsteroidal drugs that function as relatively pure antagonists (such as hydroxyflutamide and bicalutamide) or as partial agonists (29Berrevoets C.A. Umar A. Brinkmann A.O. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2002; 198: 97-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Bicalutamide, which is widely used for prostate cancer treatment, can stimulate the AR to bind DNA, but fails to recruit coactivators and can mediate the recruitment of NCoR to the androgen-regulated PSA gene, indicating that corepressor recruitment may contribute to antagonist activity (30Masiello D.

Med. 2004; 10: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (1938) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, bicalutamide has limited efficacy in the advanced androgen-independent stage of prostate cancer, and other AR antagonists are similarly ineffective at this stage of the disease (33Joyce R. Fenton M.A. Rode P. Constantine M. Gaynes L. Kolvenbag G. DeWolf W. Balk S. Taplin M.E. Bubley G.J. J. Urol. 1998; 159: 149-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). As enhancement of corepressor recruitment to the AR may be an effective approach for blocking AR signaling in prostate cancer, this study further examines corepressor recruitment by AR agonists and antagonists.Loss of function experiments were carried out initially using NCoR siRNA, in conjunction with chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). These confirmed that endogenous NCoR could negatively regulate the activity of the DHT-liganded AR, and indicated that AR activity may be regulated by the relative levels of NCoR and coactivators. Although multiple other ligands could mediate AR-NCoR interaction, the AR partial agonist RU486 (mifepristone) functioned uniquely, at nanomolar concentrations, as a strong enhancer of this interaction. Significantly, while NCoR RIDs and the AR LBD contributed to AR-NCoR binding, this was markedly enhanced by a further interaction with the AR N terminus via a site that was independent of the N-terminal FXXLF motif. These results demonstrate that NCoR is a biological regulator of AR action, and identify a new role for the AR N terminus in the AR-NCoR interaction. Moreover, the marked enhancement of the AR-NCoR interaction by RU486, but not by AR antagonists currently in clinical use, indicates that this interaction is a target for the development of new potent AR antagonists.MATERIALS AND METHODSPlasmids and Reagents—Expression vectors for AR (pSVARo) ERα (pcDNA-ERα), NCoR (PKCR2-NCoR), and SRC1 (pSG5-SRC1) have been described previously (24Cheng S. Brzostek S. Lee S.R. Hollenberg A.N. Balk S.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 1492-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 34Cohen R.N. Brzostek S. Kim B. Chorev M. Wondisford F.E.

Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 273-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The NCoRc vector (pKCR2-NCoRc) was referred to previously as NCoRI and encodes the C-terminal amino acids 1574–2454 of NCoR (numbering is based on murine NCoR). VP16-NCoRc encodes the three NCoR RIDs from NCoRc fused to the VP16 transactivation domain in the AASVVP16 vector (amino acids 1806–2454). Additional fusion protein constructs with VP16 were constructed in the pACT vector, while fusions to the Gal4 DNA binding domain were in the pBind vector (Promega, Madison, WI). The VP16 fusions with AR include VP16-AR (encoding the full-length AR), VP16-ARDBD-LBD (encoding amino acids 501–919), VP16-ARNTD (amino acids 1–500), VP16-ARLBD (amino acids 661–919), and have been described (24Cheng S. Brzostek S. Lee S.R. Hollenberg A.N. Balk S.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 1492-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Additional NCoR fragments fused to VP16 were generated by ligating the indicated PCR-amplified regions (numbering is based on the murine NCoR sequence) into pACT with a C-terminal HA tag. GST-NCoR (N2N1) contains amino acids 2063–2300 of hNCoR fused to GST in PGEX4T1 and has been described previously (36Cohen R.N. Wondisford F.E. Hollenberg A.N. Mol.

The mutants LF26,27AA and ARdel23–27 were generated from pSVARo using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The Gal4-NCoRc CoRNR box mutants were described previously (34Cohen R.N. Brzostek S. Kim B. Chorev M. Wondisford F.E. Hollenberg A.N. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1049-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 35Makowski A. Brzostek S. Cohen R.N. Hollenberg A.N. Mol.

The reporter constructs ARE4-luciferase, containing four tandem copies of a synthetic ARE, and the estrogen response element (ERE2)-luciferase containing two EREs have been described (24Cheng S. Brzostek S. Lee S.R. Hollenberg A.N. Balk S.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 1492-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). pG5-luciferase, regulated by five tandem Gal4 binding sites, and pRL-CMV, a CMV promoter-regulated Renilla control, were from Promega. Dihydrotestosterone (DHT), estradiol (E2), and RU486 were from Sigma and were used as 1:1000 stock solutions in ethanol.Cell Culture and Transfection—CV1 and 293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT). Cells in 48-well tissue culture plates in DMEM containing 10% charcoal dextran-stripped fetal bovine serum (CDS-FBS, Hyclone) were cotransfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Cells were transfected with 50 ng of reporter vector, expression vector, and coregulators (NCoR, NCoRc, SRC1) except where indicated, and with 1.25 ng of pRL-CMV Renilla vector for normalization. After 24 h the medium was replaced with fresh DMEM/10% CDS-FBS medium containing hormones or drugs at the indicated final concentrations. Following a further 24 h, firefly, and Renilla luciferase activities were assayed with the dual-luciferase assay system from Promega as per the supplier's instructions. All samples were in triplicate or quadruplicate and firefly luciferase activities were normalized for cotransfected Renilla activity. To assess expression of transfected proteins, lysates from replicate wells were prepared in 1% SDS, run on 8 or 10% SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with anti-HA (Covance) or anti-AR antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) (1:1000 dilutions incubated overnight at 4 °C), followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or rabbit Ig secondaries (Promega) and ECL (Amersham Biosciences).RNA Interference—Vectors expressing hairpin small interfering RNAs (siRNA) under the control of the mouse U6 promoter were constructed by inserting pairs of annealed DNA oligonucleotides into pBS/U6 plasmid (a gift of Y. Shi) at ApaI-EcoRI sites (38Sui G. Soohoo C. Affar el B. Gay F. Shi Y. Forrester W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5515-5520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1060) Google Scholar). The target sequence for NcoR was: 5′-GGGCTTATGGAGGACCCTATGA-3′. To assess effects on AR transactivation, this siRNA plasmid (pU6-NCoR) or a control laminin siRNA plasmid (pU6-laminin) were cotransfected with the AR expression vector and the indicated reporters. To assess protein expression, cells in 6-well plates were transfected with 0.1–1.6 μg of vector per well. At 48 h after transfection the cells were collected, and nuclear extracts were isolated (39Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3908) Google Scholar). Nuclear proteins were separated by electrophoresis in 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred overnight to nitrocellulose membranes. Blots were probed with a 1:500 dilution of an affinity-purified anti-NCoR antiserum in Tris-buffered saline containing 5% nonfat milk and 0.05% Tween 20, followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (Amersham Biosciences) at 1:1000 dilution (24Cheng S. Brzostek S. Lee S.R. Hollenberg A.N. Balk S.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 1492-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The blots were visualized using ECL Plus Western blotting detection system.Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—LNCaP prostate cancer cells grown to ∼80% confluence in 10-cm plates were switched to steroid hormone-depleted medium (RPMI 1640/10% CS-FCS) for 48 h and then exposed to 10 nm DHT for varying times. Plates were then rinsed with PBS and fixed for 10 min at room temperature with 1% formaldehyde in PBS. After rinsing twice with ice-cold PBS, cross-linking was terminated by scraping cells into 1 ml of 100 mm Tris, pH 9.4 and 10 mm dithiothreitol and incubating at 30 °C for 15 min. Cell pellets were then washed twice with PBS and resuspended in 0.3 ml of lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.1, and protease inhibitors). Chromatin was sheared to 300–1000 bp with three sequential 10 s pulses at 70% power with a microtip ultrasonic cell dismembrator (Fisher). Cell debris was pelleted at 10,000 × g, and the supernatant was precleared with 10 μg of sheared salmon sperm DNA, 20 μl of non-immune sera, and 20 μl of a 50% slurry of protein A-Sepharose. Immunoprecipitation was with 500 ng of AR N-terminal rabbit polyclonal antibody (PG-21, Upstate Biotechnology), affinity-purified NCoR C-terminal anti-peptide antibody (24Cheng S. Brzostek S. Lee S.R. Hollenberg A.N. Balk S.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 1492-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) or a nonspecific control antibody, 2 μg of sheared salmon sperm DNA, and 20 μl of a 50% slurry of protein A-Sepharose. Precipitates were washed three times with 300 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 2.7 mm KCl, 0.05% Tween-20 and 1% deoxycholate. Three additional washes with 10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA were performed and then beads were eluted three times with 35 μl of 1% SDS and 100 mm NaHCO3 at 37 °C for 10 min each. Eluates were pooled and incubated at 65 °C overnight to reverse cross-links. Products were then purified with QiaQuick PCR purification spin resin (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and 10% of the eluate was subjected to 50 cycles of PCR amplification with steps of 94 °C, 55 °C, and 72 °C for 1 min each. The primers for the p21 cyclin-dependent kinase promoter were 5′-AAGCTCCCTCCTGGACCCAGA-3′ and 5′-CAAGCCTCAGAGCATCAG-3′; and for the PSA promoter 5′-GAGAGCTAGCACTTGCTGTT-3′ and 5′-AGTTCTAGTTTCTGGTCTCA-3′. PCR products were analyzed by gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining in 4% agarose gels.GST Pull-down Assays—GST-NCoR (N2N1) and GST alone were produced as described previously and purified using glutathione-agarose beads (36Cohen R.N. Wondisford F.E. Hollenberg A.N. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1567-1581Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 37Cohen R.N. Putney A. Wondisford F.E. Hollenberg A.N. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 900-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and there integrity was visualized on SDS-PAGE. To derive the indicated AR moiety, CV1 cells in 60-mm plates were transfected with either full-length AR, AR N-DBD, or D-LBD as described above. After 24 h, medium was replaced with fresh medium with or without 10 nm DHT or RU486. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and extracts prepared by scraping cells into 0.75 ml of lysis buffer (PBS, 5% glycerol, 0.05% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitors). Lysates were incubated on ice for 5 min and sonicated with two sequential 5-s pulses at 30% power with a microtip ultrasonic dismembrator (Fisher) and centrifuged at 4 °C to pellet insoluble material. Cell extracts were precleared with GST agarose beads for 2 h at 4 °C on a rotating wheel. Cleared lysates were incubated for 16 h with or without 10 nm DHT or RU486 at 4 °C on a rotating wheel in the presence of equal amounts of GST or GST-NCoR (N2N1) agarose beads. The beads were washed once with ice-cold lysis buffer and three times with ice-cold PBS and bound proteins were eluted by boiling in Laemmli sample buffer (Promega), run on 12% SDS-PAGE and blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. To visualize AR proteins, Western blots were probed with either a polyclonal antiserum recognizing the first 20 or last 19 residues of hAR (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Five percent of total cell lysates was loaded as input.RESULTSNCoR Down-regulation Enhances AR Transcriptional Activity—Previous studies have shown that transfected NCoR could repress the transcriptional activity of the DHT-liganded AR (24Cheng S. Brzostek S. Lee S.R. Hollenberg A.N. Balk S.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 1492-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). RNAi was used to directly address whether endogenous NCoR functions as a negative regulator of AR transcriptional activity. CV1 cells were transfected with an AR expression vector and AR-regulated luciferase reporter gene, with or without plasmids encoding an NCoR or control siRNA expression vector (pU6-NCoR or pU6-laminin, respectively). As shown in Fig. 1A, AR transcriptional activity was augmented by the NCoR siRNA, but not the control siRNA plasmid. Consistent with this result, immunoblotting showed that NCoR protein expression was markedly down-regulated by the NCoR siRNA (Fig. 1B).We showed previously that repression of AR transcriptional activity by transfected NCoR was dependent upon an interaction between NCoR receptor interacting domains and the AR LBD (24Cheng S. Brzostek S. Lee S.R. Hollenberg A.N. Balk S.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 1492-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Therefore, another control for nonspecific siRNA effects was to examine whether enhancement of AR activity by the NCoR siRNA was dependent on the AR LBD. In contrast to full-length AR, an AR expression vector with the LBD-deleted (AR N-DBD, encoding the N terminus and DBD) was constitutively active in the absence of DHT and was not stimulated by the NCoR siRNA (Fig. 1C).As a further control, we examined the estradiol-liganded ERα. Whereas NCoR can interact with ERα when it is liganded by certain partial agonists, the estradiol-liganded ERα is not represssed by NCoR transfection. As shown in Fig. 2, the NCoR siRNA did not enhance the activity of the estradiol-liganded ERα, while AR activity was again markedly enhanced in the same experiment. Taken together, these data supported the conclusion that endogenous NCoR functions to suppress the transcriptional activity of the agonist-liganded AR.Fig. 2NCoR levels do not influence ER-mediated action. CV1 cells were transfected with either ERα and an ERE-Luc reporter or the AR and the ARE4-Luc reporter. All transfections also included the pRL-CMV control as well as well as the indicated amounts of pU6-NCoR. Cells were treated with the indicated ligands for 24 h, and luciferase versus Renilla luciferase activities were determined from triplicate samples (expressed as RLU ± S.E.).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)NCoR Is Recruited to Androgen-regulated Genes by the Endogenous DHT-liganded AR in Prostate Cancer Cells—Although we have been able to markedly down-regulate NCoR expression by siRNA and enhance AR activity in CV1 and 293T cells (data not shown) efforts to substantially down-regulate NCoR protein in a prostate cancer cell line expressing endogenous AR have not yet been successful. Therefore, chromatin immunoprecipitation was used as an alternative approach to test the hypothesis that NCoR associates with the DHT-liganded endogenous AR and is recruited to AR-regulated genes. Androgen responsive LNCaP prostate cancer cells were grown in steroid hormone-depleted medium for 2 days, and were then pulsed with DHT. Chromatin was cross-linked with formaldehyde at varying times after the DHT pulse, and sheared chromatin was immunoprecipitated with anti-AR, anti-NCoR, or control antibodies. PCR was then used to assess AR and NCoR recruitment to AREs in the p21 cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor promoter and PSA regulatory regions. As shown in Fig. 3A, DHT treatment led to the recruitment of AR to the p21 gene. Significantly, NCoR was not associated with the p21 ARE in the absence of DHT, consistent with the lack of AR binding, but became associated after DHT treatment. Interestingly, the binding of both AR and NCoR appeared to be transient based on this method, as has been reported previously for AR and ERα (31Shang Y. Myers M. Brown M. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 601-610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar).Fig. 3NCoR is recruited to both the p21 and PSA promoters in the presence of DHT.A, LNCaP cells were treated with DHT for the indicated number of minutes, fixed, sheared, and immunoprecipitated with the indicated antibodies (rabbit anti-PDGF receptor antibody was used as a negative control). After reversing the cross-links the solubilized chromatin was subjected to PCR with primers spanning the p21 ARE or control primers for the human cd1 gene. The resulting PCR products were resolved on ethidium bromide-stained agarose gels. Also shown is PCR from input chromatin used with the AR, NCoR, and control antiserum. B, an identical paradigm was used on precipitated DNA complexes treated as above and PCR-amplified with primers in the PSA promoter flanking the ARE.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DHT similarly induced the association of both AR and NCoR with the PSA promoter (Fig. 3B), as well as the ARE in the PSA enhancer (data not shown). In this experiment the AR and NCoR association was not detected until 30–45 min, and it persisted for at least 2 h. More rapid and transient association of both AR and NCoR have been observed in other experiments (data not shown), and the basis for the variable recruitment kinetics are not yet clear. Nonetheless, a consistent correlation has been observed between AR and NCoR recruitment in response to DHT. It should be noted"

Saturn's aurora brightens in response to solar-wind forcing, and the auroral spectrum resembles Jupiter's. Phoebe's surface shows variable water-ice content, and the data indicate it originated in the outer solar system. Saturn's rings also show variable water abundance, with the purest ice in the outermost A ring. This radial variation is consistent with initially pure water ice bombarded by meteors, but smaller radial structures may indicate collisional transport and recent renewal events in the past 10(7) to 10(8) years."

In plants, the enzyme is composed of two types of subunits (small and large) and is allosterically regulated by 3-phosphoglycerate and phosphate. The pattern of expression and sugar regulation of the six Arabidopsis thaliana ADP-Glc PPase-encoding genes (two small subunits, ApS1 and ApS2; and four large subunits, ApL1–ApL4) has been studied. Based on mRNA expression, ApS1 is the main small subunit or catalytic isoform responsible for ADP-Glc PPase activity in all tissues of the plant. Large subunits play a regulatory role, and the data presented define a clear functional distinction among them. ApL1 is the main large subunit in source tissues, whereas ApL3 and, to a lesser extent, ApL4 are the main isoforms present in sink tissues. Thus, in source tissues, ADP-Glc PPase would be finely regulated by the 3-phosphoglycerate/phosphate ratio, whereas in sink tissues, the enzyme would be dependent on the availability of substrates for starch synthesis. Sugar regulation of ADP-Glc PPase genes is restricted to ApL3 and ApL4 in leaves. Sugar induction of ApL3 and ApL4 transcription in leaves allows the establishment of heterotetramers less sensitive to the allosteric effectors, resembling the situation in sink tissues.

Besides the allosteric regulation of ADP-Glc PPase activity, a post-translational redox control that involves the action of thioredoxins has been shown (11Ballicora M.A. Frueauf J.B. Fu Y.B. Schurmann P. Preiss J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1315-1320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) and acts in response to sugars and light (12Hendriks J.H.M. Kolbe A. Gibo Y. Stitt M. Geigenberger P. Plant Physiol. 2003; 133: 1-12Crossref Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 13Tiessen A. Hendriks J.H.M. Stitt M. Branscheid A. Gibon Y. Farre ́ E.M. Geigenberger P. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 2191-2213Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Different isoforms of ADP-Glc PPase have been described, and many cDNAs and genomic DNAs have been isolated from both monocot and dicot plants. In most cases, a single SS gene and several LS genes are present in a given species (1Sivak M.N. Preiss J. Starch: Basic Science to Biotechnology.in: Taylor S.L. Adavances in Food And Nutrition Research. Academic Press, New York1998: 1-199Google Scholar, 4Creville ́n P. Ballicora M.A. Me ́rida A. Preiss J. Romero J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28508-28515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). It has been postulated that specific tissues should present different ADP-Glc PPases with distinct regulatory properties that would be dependent on the specific LS present in a given tissue (3Ballicora M.A. Laughlin M.J. Fu Y. Okita T. Barry G. Preiss J. Plant Physiol. 1995; 109: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 14Burgess D. Penton A. Dunsmuir P. Dooner H. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 33: 431-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). However, there is no comprehensive study of the expression of all the different ADP-Glc PPase isoforms in a single plant system. Six genes encode for proteins with homology to ADP-Glc PPase in the Arabidopsis genome. Two of these genes encode for SS, ApS1 (At5g48300) and ApS2 (At1g05610); and four of these genes encode for LS, ApL1 to ApL4 (At15g19220, At1g27680, At4g39210, and At2g21590). We have shown recently that the Arabidopsis large subunits confer different regulatory properties to ADP-Glc PPase in vitro and would modulate the activity of the ADP-Glc PPase enzyme according to the biosynthetic starch necessities in a tissue-specific manner. Thus, according to their kinetic and regulatory properties, the large subunits were classified as sink and source isoforms (4Creville ́n P. Ballicora M.A. Me ́rida A. Preiss J. Romero J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28508-28515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). However, the distinction between sink LS and source LS needs further confirmation because in A. thaliana only partial information concerning some genes has been reported (15Rook F. Corke F. Card R. Munz G. Smith C. Bevan M.W. Plant J. 2001; 26: 421-433Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Kleczkowski L.A. Sokolov L.N. Luo C. Villand P. Zeitschrift fu ̈r Naturforschung Sect. C J.

Planta. 2003; 217: 184-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). To address this question, a complete study of the expression pattern of all ADP-Glc PPase-encoding genes is needed. Sugars play a basic role as substrates in carbon and energy metabolism as well as precursors of starch biosynthesis. They are also important signaling molecules controlling the growth and development of plants (19Rolland F. Moore B. Sheen J. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: S185-S205Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar). With regard to the starch synthesis pathway, it has been shown that sugars mediate the induction of several genes of the pathway (20Kossmann J. Visser R.G. Muller-Rober B. Willmitzer L. Sonnewald U. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1991; 230: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 21Visser R.G.F. Stolte A. Jacobsen E. Plant Mol.

Fritzius T. Wiemken A. Boller T. Aeschbacher R.A. Plant Physiol. 2000; 124: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) has been described in Arabidopsis leaves and seedlings. However, information concerning the effect of sugars on the expression of the other ADP-Glc PPase genes from Arabidopsis is scarce. The aim of this work is to understand the role of the different ADP-Glc PPase isoforms in Arabidopsis thaliana, a model system to study starch biosynthesis (29Zeeman S.C. Tiessen A. Pilling E. Kato K.L. Donald A.M. Smith A.M. Plant Physiol. 2002; 129: 516-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). We present novel data about the expression pattern of the six genes encoding for ADP-Glc PPase isoforms in different organ and tissues, and we characterize the effect of sugar supply on the expression of those genes under physiological conditions. The data presented provide solid evidence that confirms a working model proposed previously by us assigning specific roles to the different ADP-Glc PPase subunits (4Creville ́n P. Ballicora M.A. Me ́rida A. Preiss J. Romero J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28508-28515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Plant Material and Growth Conditions—A. thaliana (Columbia ecotype) was grown in growth cabinets under a 16-h light/8-h dark photo-regime at 23 °C (day)/20 °C (night), 70% humidity, and a light intensity at the plant level of 100 microeinsteins m-2 s-1. Plants were sown in soil for mRNA expression studies assays or in perlite for sugar inductions assays. Sugar induction treatments consisted of irrigation of the mature plants with MS medium (30Murashige T. Skoog F. Plant Physiol. 1962; 15: 473-497Crossref Scopus (53817) Google Scholar) supplemented with 100 mm sorbitol, 100 mm glucose, 100 mm sucrose, or 25 mm trehalose. We chose sugar concentrations according to previous reports (15Rook F. Corke F. Card R. Munz G. Smith C. Bevan M.W. Plant J. 2001; 26: 421-433Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Fritzius T. Aeschbacher R. Wiemken A. Wingler A. Plant Physiol. 2001; 126: 883-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). During sugar treatments, plants were maintained under the same growing conditions, and samples were harvested at the middle point of the photoperiod (8 h light) during 4 consecutive days, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 °C until use. RNA Extraction and Reverse Transcription—Total RNA was isolated as described by Prescott and Martin (31Prescott A. Martin C. Plant Mol. Biol. Rep. 1987; 4: 219-224Crossref Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Before cDNA synthesis, in order to remove contaminating genomic DNA, the RNA preparations were incubated with 10 units of DNase I FPLC Pure for 10 min at 37 °C, extracted with phenol and chloroform, precipitated, and dissolved in nuclease-free MilliQ-water. First-strand cDNA was synthesized from 10 μg of total RNA using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase and oligo(dT)12–18 primer, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). The reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 2 h and stopped by adding 1 ml of nuclease-free MilliQwater. All reagents were from Amersham Biosciences. Real-time Quantitative RT-PCR Analysis—Real-time quantitative RT-PCR assays were achieved using an iCycler instrument (Bio-Rad). The PCR mixture contained (in a total volume of 25 μl) 5 μl of cDNA, 0.2 mm deoxynucleotide triphosphates, 2.5 mm MgCl2, a 1:100,000 dilution of SYBR® Green I nucleic gel stain (Molecular Probes)/fluorescein calibration dye (Bio-Rad), 0.3 unit of Taq polymerase, 2.5 μl of 10× Taq polymerase buffer, and 0.2 μm of each primer. Specific oligonucleotides used were as follows: SA253 (5′-GAAAAACCAAAAGGGGAGCA-3′) and SA254 (5′-CCTCAGTCCAAGGGAAGTGG-3′) for ApS1; SA255 (5′-CTCGGTGTTTGCCTCCAAG-3′) and SA256 (5′-TCTCCTTCCCTTTTCTTCTCACA-3′) for ApS2; SA257 (5′-TCCCCACAGCAAACGACTT-3′) and SA258 (5′-GGTGGCAGGTTTCTCCTTGA-3′) for ApL1; SA259 (5′-TCGGAAAAACCAAAGGGAGA-3′) and SA260 (5′-GGCCAACGGGATAATTTCAG-3′) for ApL2; SA261 (5′-AGATCGGGAAAAACGTGGTG-3′) and SA262 (5′-CTCTTTTTAACTTCCGGCCAAAC-3′) for ApL3; SA263 (5′-AGCAGATAGGCCAGAGGAAGG-3′) and SA264 (5′-GCGGGAAAGAAAAGATCGAAG-3′) for ApL4; and UBQF (5′-GATCTTTGCCGGAAAACAATTGGAGGATGGT-3′) and UBQR (5′-CGACTTGTCATTAGAAAGAAAGAGATAACAG-3′) for UBQ10. Thermal cycling consisted of 94 °C for 3 min, followed by 40 cycles of 10 s at 94 °C, 15 s at 61 °C, and 15 s at 72 °C. After that, a melting curve was generated to check the specificity of the amplified fragment. In the case of ApL4 (primers SA263 and SA264), the annealing temperature was 64 °C. The efficiency of all the primers at the conditions described above was between 75% and 110% in all the tested samples, and product identity was confirmed by sequence analysis. Arabidopsis Ubiquitin 10 (32Sun C.W. Callis J. Plant J. 1997; 11: 1017-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) was used as a housekeeping gene in the expression analysis. Absolute Quantification (33Ginzinger D.G. Exp. Hematol. 2002; 30: 503-512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar) was performed by cloning the amplified products in pGEM®-T vector (Promega) and using them as external calibration standards. In Situ Hybridization Analysis—For mRNA in situ hybridizations, sense and antisense RNA probes were obtained by transcription of the 3′-untranslated region of the Arabidopsis ADP-Glc PPase-encoding genes cloned into pBluescript SK(-) vector (Clontech) from the T7 promoter. The digoxigenin-labeled riboprobes were prepared following the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Applied Science). In situ hybridizations were performed as described by Mérida et al. (34Me ́rida A. Rodri ́guez-Gala ́n J.M. Vincent C. Romero J.M. Plant Physiol. 1999; 120: 401-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), at 50 °C in a solution containing 2× SSC and 50% formamide; signal was detected, and the sections were mounted in Entellan mounting medium (Merck). The sections were observed through an Olympus BX60 microscope by Normarski microscopy and photographed using a JVC GC-X3E digital camera. The Arabidopsis ADP-Glc PPase Genes Show Differential mRNA Expression Levels—We have determined the absolute steady-state mRNA levels of the six Arabidopsis ADP-Glc PPase-encoding genes by real-time quantitative RT-PCR. Specific primers for the six ADP-Glc PPase genes and for the housekeeping gene, Ubiquitin 10 of Arabidopsis (32Sun C.W. Callis J. Plant J. 1997; 11: 1017-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), were designed, and their efficiency and reliability were checked. The fragments amplified by these primers were cloned and sequenced, and the resulting plasmids were used as external calibration standards (33Ginzinger D.G. Exp. Hematol. 2002; 30: 503-512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar). All six mRNAs were detected in leaves, inflorescences, fruits, and roots of mature plants, but at very different levels (Fig. 1). ApS1, ApL1, ApL3, and ApL4 showed elevated mRNA steadystate levels, whereas ApS2 and ApL2 mRNA were accumulated at very low levels. These data are in accord with previous observations in our laboratory, in which ApS2 and ApL2 could not be detected by Northern blot. 2P. Crevillén, unpublished observations.ApS1 was the major SS isoform in all organs of the plant. A more complex situation was observed for ApL genes. ApL1 was the most abundant LS in leaves, with levels of mRNA up to three times higher than that of ApL3 and more than 1 order of magnitude higher levels of transcript than ApL4. In inflorescences and fruits, ApL3 was the most abundant ADP-Glc PPase large subunit transcript. In roots, the level of expression of all ADP-Glc PPase genes was very low compared with leaves, and ApL3 was the predominant LS with up to 3-fold and 1 order of magnitude higher levels of transcript than ApL4 and ApL1, respectively. These data show that there is a tissue-specific level of expression of the different ADP-Glc PPase subunits in A. thaliana. Expression Pattern at the Cellular Level—The mRNA expression pattern of Arabidopsis ADP-Glc PPase genes was studied by in situ hybridization in leaves, inflorescences, and fruits. Fig. 2 shows the expression pattern of the SSs, ApS1 and ApS2. Both genes are detected in the main starch-producing tissues of leaves, the mesophyll and the vascular companions cells (Fig. 2, a–d). In flowers, a strong signal is detected in the stamens and pistil, as well as in the receptacle. This pattern was observed in both young (Fig. 2f for ApS1; ApS2 data not shown) and mature flowers (Fig. 2, e and g). ApS1 and ApS2 are also clearly expressed in the embryo (Fig. 2, h and i). A different situation was observed for the ADP-Glc PPase LSs. In leaves, ApL1, ApL2, and ApL3 transcripts are localized in the mesophyll and vascular companions cells (Fig. 3, a–e), but ApL4 appeared to be restricted only to the surrounding cells of the vascular veins (Fig. 3, f and g). Similar to the SS mRNAs, all the LS mRNAs were detected in all tissues of flowers at different developmental stages (Fig. 3, h–k). In fruits, ApL1 is expressed uniformly in the embryo (Fig. 3, l and m), whereas ApL2, ApL3, and ApL4 expression was restricted to the pro-vascular cells of the embryo (Fig. 3, n–r). An unspecific signal in the seed coat (testa) was observed in most of the hybridizations with fruit sections. No signal was detected with the control sense riboprobes for all the genes (Fig. 2, j–m for ApS1; ApS2 and LS control sense hybridizations not shown).Fig. 3Pattern of expression of the Arabidopsis ADP-Glc PPase large subunits. a–g, leaf sections hybridized with the antisense probe against ApL1 (a and b), ApL2 (c), ApL3 (d and e), and ApL4 (f and g); h–k, flowers at different developmental stages hybridized with the antisense probe against ApL1 (h), ApL2 (i), ApL3 (j), and ApL4 (k); l–r, magnifications of longitudinal sections of fruits showing the seed and the embryo hybridized with the antisense probe against ApL1 (l and m), ApL2 (n), ApL3 (o and p), and ApL4 (q and r). Control samples hybridized against the sense probes are not shown. The mRNA in situ hybridization experiments were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures” using specific digoxigenin-labeled riboprobes against each LS gene.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The results shown indicate that there is not a differential pattern of expression between the two SSs. On the contrary, a clear differential expression pattern of the LS genes was observed in leaves and fruits. This fact, together with the different mRNA expression levels (Fig. 1), suggests a tissue specificity that could be related to the role of each LS isoform in regulating the activity of the heterotetrameric ADP-Glc PPase enzyme. ApL3 and ApL4 Are Induced by Sugars in Leaves—Most studies on sugar-regulated transcription of genes involved in the synthesis of starch have been performed with seedlings or detached leaves (15Rook F. Corke F. Card R. Munz G. Smith C. Bevan M.W. Plant J. 2001; 26: 421-433Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Mu ̈ller-Ro ̈ber B.T. Kossmann J. Hannah L.C. Willmitzer L. Sonnewald U. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1990; 224: 137-146Google Scholar, 27Sokolov L.N. Dejardin A. Kleczkowski L.A. Biochem. J. 1998; 337: 681-687Crossref Scopus (100) Google Scholar). This type of assay, although very informative, may not reflect the real physiological response of the plant, could magnify the differences in the mRNA levels, and is restricted to specific tissues. To overcome this problem, we have designed a sugar induction assay in which all the different organs of the plant could be harvested under the same experimental conditions (see “Experimental Procedures”). Arabidopsis plants irrigated with MS medium were grown to maturity. Then, plants were irrigated with MS medium supplemented with different sugars for several days. Samples were harvested at the middle point of the photoperiod, and the mRNA levels were determined by real-time quantitative RT-PCR. This experimental design reflects the carbon status of mature plants in a better way than in detached leaves or seedlings and at the same time allows global analysis of different organs. Fig. 4 shows the steady-state ADP-Glc PPase mRNA levels in Arabidopsis leaves after irrigation with MS medium supplemented with 100 mm sucrose. A time-course analysis showed that only ApL3 and ApL4 mRNAs were sucrose-induced and that, after 72 h of treatment, a significant induction of both genes could be observed (a 10-fold and an 18-fold increase in ApL3 and ApL4 mRNA levels, respectively), and induction of both genes was even higher at 96 h. No variation in the transcript levels was observed for ApS1, ApS2, ApL1, and ApL2 transcripts. A similar behavior was observed when Arabidopsis plants were supplemented with glucose (100 mm) or trehalose (25 mm) (data not shown). Results in Fig. 5 show the induction of ApL3 and ApL4 after 72 h of sugar treatment. The mRNA levels of ApL3 were 4-fold higher in the presence of glucose (100 mm), 10-fold higher in the presence of sucrose (100 mm), and 6-fold higher in the presence of trehalose (25 mm) compared with control plants in the absence of added sugars. Induction of ApL4 was even higher, reaching 20- and 30-fold the control levels in the presence of sucrose and trehalose, respectively. No significant effect was observed when plants were supplemented with sorbitol, thus suggesting that sugar induction of ApL3 and ApL4 is not due to osmotic stress (Fig. 5). We also studied the effect of sugar treatment in other organs of mature Arabidopsis plants, and no sugar induction of ADP-Glc PPase-encoding genes was observed in fruits, inflorescences, or roots (data not shown). In summary, our data clearly show that only two genes encoding for Arabidopsis ADP-Glc PPase, ApL3 and ApL4, are sugar-regulated in source tissues (leaves), whereas sugar regulation in sink tissues does not control the level of any ADP-Glc PPase-encoding gene.Fig. 5Sugar induction of ApL3 and ApL4 mRNA expression level. Arabidopsis plants were fed with 100 mm glucose, 100 mm sucrose, 25 mm trehalose, or 100 mm sorbitol, and the ADP-Glc PPase-encoding gene mRNA levels in leaves were determined by real-time quantitative RT-PCR as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The figure shows the results for the ApL3 and ApL4 genes. The data are normalized to the value of the control without induction. The values are the average of three determinations of two cDNA preparations. The S.D. was less than ±10% for each data point.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We have characterized the expression of the Arabidopsis ADP-Glc PPase-encoding genes in different organs and tissues, determining their absolute transcript levels by real-time quantitative RT-PCR and their expression pattern by in situ hybridizations. Although the six transcripts were detected in all the studied organs, our results clearly show that the different ADP-Glc PPase subunits are expressed at different levels and have specific expression profiles among the different organs of the plant. Both SS-encoding genes are expressed in all the starch-producing tissues of the plant. However, ApS1 expression level is up to 2 orders of magnitude higher than that of ApS2. It has been shown previously that ApS1 plays a critical role in starch biosynthesis because adg1-1 mutant, affected in APS1, shows very low levels of starch accumulation (35Lin T.P. Caspar T. Somerville C. Preiss J. Plant Plysiol. 1988; 86: 1131-1135Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Besides, in vitro studies with the wild type (4Creville ́n P. Ballicora M.A. Me ́rida A. Preiss J. Romero J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28508-28515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and a mutated APS2 H137D protein 3T. Ventriglia, unpublished observations. have suggested that ApS2 is a non-active isoform, with ApS1 being the only catalytic ADP-Glc PPase subunit in Arabidopsis. Our results on the expression data reported in this work confirm the role of ApS1 as the main, if not the sole, SS isoform responsible for ADP-Glc PPase activity in A. thaliana. The ADP-Glc PPase large subunits are considered to play a regulatory role, modulating the activity in response to allosteric effectors (4Creville ́n P. Ballicora M.A. Me ́rida A. Preiss J. Romero J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28508-28515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The mRNA levels of the four genes encoding for LS show significant differences. Whereas ApL1 is the most highly expressed ADP-Glc PPase LS in leaves (Fig. 1), ApL3 reaches the highest levels of expression in sink organs (inflorescences, fruits, and roots). Differentiation is also observed at the cellular level (Fig. 3). In seeds, ApL1 appeared to be expressed in all the embryo cells, whereas the others LSs are preferentially localized in the pro-vascular cells. In mature leaves, we clearly detect the ApL1, ApL2, and ApL3 mRNAs in the mesophyll cells as well as in the bundle sheet, whereas ApL4 was restricted to the companion cells of the vascular veins. We could not determine which subunit is expressed in the guard cells of the stomata, cells that accumulate significant amounts of starch. However, microarray analysis has shown that ApL4 is the most abundant LS in guard cells, reasserting the sink nature of this gene (36Leonhardt N. Kwak J.M. Robert N. Warner D. Leonhardt G. Schroeder J.I. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 596-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Thus, a clear distinction among the LSs can be established. APL1 is the large subunit showing the highest sensitivity to 3-PGA and Pi (4Creville ́n P. Ballicora M.A. Me ́rida A. Preiss J. Romero J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28508-28515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and, by its level of expression, would be the main isoform in source tissues, thus providing a fine modulation of ADP-Glc PPase by the 3-PGA/Pi ratio to adjust starch synthesis to carbon fixation. In sink tissues, APL3 and, to a lesser extent, APL4 would be the main LS isoforms participating in the establishment of the ADP-Glc PPase heterotetramer. These two LSs have been shown to confer less sensitivity to 3-PGA and Pi to the enzyme (4Creville ́n P. Ballicora M.A. Me ́rida A. Preiss J. Romero J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28508-28515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), and thus starch synthesis would be more dependent on the supply of substrates from source tissues than on the allosteric effectors. The results support our previous model in which a functional distinction among the different LSs was proposed on the basis of the kinetic and regulatory properties that they confer to the ADP-Glc PPase heterotetramer (4Creville ́n P. Ballicora M.A. Me ́rida A. Preiss J. Romero J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28508-28515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The specialized function of the different ADP-Glc PPase isoforms is also reflected in their response to sugars. Coordinated sugar transcriptional regulation of several starch biosynthetic genes has been suggested by numerous works (19Rolland F. Moore B. Sheen J. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: S185-S205Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar). Induction of several ADP-Glc PPase-encoding genes has been reported in different species including Arabidopsis (16Kleczkowski L.A. Sokolov L.N. Luo C. Villand P. Zeitschrift fu ̈r Naturforschung Sect. C J. Biosci. 1999; 54: 353-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 25Bae J.M. Liu J.R. Mol. Gen.

Fritzius T. Wiemken A. Boller T. Aeschbacher R.A. Plant Physiol. 2000; 124: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). We show that, under physiological conditions, only two ADP-Glc PPase-encoding genes, ApL3 and ApL4, are controlled by sugars (Figs. 4 and 5). Sugar induction of ApL3 and ApL4 genes is leaf-specific and does not take place in sink tissue. Induction was stronger in response to disaccharides than to glucose (Fig. 5), suggesting that different signaling pathways may be involved in the transcriptional control of ApL3 and ApL4 by sugars. To date, trehalose-regulated expression of ApL3 has been shown (28Wingler A. Fritzius T. Wiemken A. Boller T. Aeschbacher R.A. Plant Physiol. 2000; 124: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), but no data regarding ApL4 regulation have been published. Trehalose feeding rescues the phenotype of the adg2-1 mutant lacking ApL1 (17Fritzius T. Aeschbacher R. Wiemken A. Wingler A. Plant Physiol. 2001; 126: 883-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and it was proposed that under these conditions, APL3 would substitute for APL1. Nevertheless, our results demonstrate that trehalose would alter the subunit composition of ADP-Glc PPase by inducing both APL3 and APL4. The low-starch mutant adg2-1 confirms our hypothesis that in normal situations, APL1 is the main LS isoform in the leaf mesophyll. In this tissue, there is also a significant amount of APL3 transcript (Figs. 1 and 3). However, it is very likely that in the metabolic environment of the leaf, most of the starch synthesis was driven by the APS1+APL1 heterotetramer. In plants fed with sugars, the intracellular level of hexoses increases (27Sokolov L.N. Dejardin A. Kleczkowski L.A. Biochem. J. 1998; 337: 681-687Crossref Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 37Geiger M. Stitt M. Geigenberger P. Planta. 1998; 206: 234-244Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In this situation, the change of the metabolic conditions in the mesophyll and the increased ApL3 and ApL4 expression would allow the establishment of heterotetramers less sensitive to the allosteric effectors (4Creville ́n P. Ballicora M.A. Me ́rida A. Preiss J. Romero J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28508-28515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), so that the enzyme would respond to or be controlled by the supply of substrates. This would lead to a higher rate of starch synthesis in response to the higher carbohydrate availability, resembling the situation in sink organs. In fact, sugar induction treatments increase starch levels in our plants (data not shown). Several lines of evidence are in apparent contradiction with the results that we present on sugar regulation of ADP-Glc PPase isoforms. In previous studies, it was reported that the ApL3 promoter fused to the GUS gene was only expressed in the bundle sheet and that its expression was induced in the leaf mesophyll cells in response to sucrose (15Rook F. Corke F. Card R. Munz G. Smith C. Bevan M.W. Plant J. 2001; 26: 421-433Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, according to the data presented in Fig. 2, ApL3 can be detected in the mesophyll cells of plants grown in the absence of sugars. The simplest explanation for this discrepancy is that the ApL3 promoter used for the GUS construct lacked element(s) needed for its normal expression. Induction with sucrose would raise the mRNA levels in the mesophyll cells, making it possible to detect GUS. On the other hand, results have also been published reporting that in Arabidopsis detached leaves, ApS1, ApL3, and ApL2 genes were induced by sucrose and glucose, whereas ApL1 was repressed (ApS2 and ApL4 were not known at that time) (27Sokolov L.N. Dejardin A. Kleczkowski L.A. Biochem. J. 1998; 337: 681-687Crossref Scopus (100) Google Scholar). This discrepancy is explained by the probes and assays used in that work. Sokolov et al. (27Sokolov L.N. Dejardin A. Kleczkowski L.A. Biochem. J. 1998; 337: 681-687Crossref Scopus (100) Google Scholar) used probes based on the available sequences at that time, which corresponded to a conserved region of the LS genes (38Villand P. Olsen O.A. Kleczkowski L.A. Plant Mol. Biol. 1993; 23: 1279-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Thus, they detected ApL2, whereas our observations using specific probes indicate that this gene is undetectable by Northern blot. Besides, they used detached leaves maintained in the dark for the induction assay. In that case, the effect of sugar treatment could be more severe or unspecific due to higher water evaporation rates or dehydration stress (15Rook F. Corke F. Card R. Munz G. Smith C. Bevan M.W. Plant J. 2001; 26: 421-433Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have analyzed the effect of the sugars under normal physiological conditions, and the only ADP-Glc PPase-encoding genes regulated by sugars at the transcriptional level are ApL3 and ApL4. The characterization of the expression pattern and sugar regulation of the ADP-Glc PPase gene family allows us to propose a model of gene evolution of this family in Arabidopsis. APS1 is essential for starch biosynthesis and is the fully catalytic subunit of the enzyme (4Creville ́n P. Ballicora M.A. Me ́rida A. Preiss J. Romero J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28508-28515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 35Lin T.P. Caspar T. Somerville C. Preiss J. Plant Plysiol. 1988; 86: 1131-1135Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas APS2 has several amino acid substitutions and is not active in vitro (4Creville ́n P. Ballicora M.A. Me ́rida A. Preiss J. Romero J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28508-28515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 39Burton R.A. Johnson P.E. Beckles D.M. Fincher G.B. Jenner H.L. Naldrett M.J. Denyer K. Plant Physiol. 2002; 130: 1464-1475Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Thus, our hypothesis is that the lone functional Arabidopsis SS is APS1. APS2, although it is still expressed at very low levels in the plant, is a nonfunctional ADP-Glc PPase subunit that could be accumulating mutations through a process of pseudogenization (40Zhang J. Trends Ecol. Evol. 2003; 18: 292-298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1482) Google Scholar). It is accepted that many genes appear by gene duplication (40Zhang J. Trends Ecol. Evol. 2003; 18: 292-298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1482) Google Scholar, 41Blanc G. Wolfe K.H. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 1679-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar), and it has been proposed that the different ADP-Glc PPase LSs of a plant specie would result by divergence and specialization (7Ballicora M.A. Iglesias A. Preiss J. Photosynth. Res. 2004; 79: 1-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). It is also accepted that the Arabidopsis genome underwent several ancient rounds of duplication (42Simillion C. Vandepoele K. Van Montagu M.C.E. Zabeau M. Van de Peer Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13727-13732Crossref Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Indeed, ApL3 and ApL4 genes are located in sister genomic regions that have been described in different genomic analysis (www.tigr.org/tdb/e2k1/ath1/Arabidopsis_genome_duplication.shtml). Our biochemical studies (4Creville ́n P. Ballicora M.A. Me ́rida A. Preiss J. Romero J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28508-28515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) showed that both LSs confer similar regulatory properties to the enzyme, and in the present report, we show that both ApL3 and ApL4 genes are similarly induced by sugars (Figs. 4 and 5). On the other hand, the expression pattern of the two genes is different (Figs. 1 and 3). These facts support the hypothesis that they are related genes under a process of functional divergence. Because it is not usual to find twin genes so well characterized, we think this is a great example of subfunctionalization that could be used in further genomic analysis (41Blanc G. Wolfe K.H. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 1679-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar). In summary, we have determined the expression pattern and sugar regulation of the six Arabidopsis ADP-Glc PPase-encoding genes. A clear functional distinction can be made between the different large subunit isoforms that could be considered as sink (ApL2, ApL3, and ApL4)- or source (ApL1)-specific. Besides, a shift in the ADP-Glc PPase LS composition in response to sugar feeding allows the enzyme to be efficiently regulated according to the metabolic situation and the starch necessities of a given tissue. This hypothesis is in accordance with our previous data concerning the kinetic properties of the enzyme (4Creville ́n P. Ballicora M.A. Me ́rida A. Preiss J. Romero J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28508-28515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). We are grateful to Teresa Ruíz for critical reading of the manuscript.

https://openalex.org/W2128113729,"Activation of cyclic nucleotide dependent signaling pathways leads to relaxation of smooth muscle, alterations in the cytoskeleton of cultured cells, and increases in the phosphorylation of HSP20. To determine the effects of phosphorylated HSP20 on the actin cytoskeleton, phosphopeptide analogs of HSP20 were synthesized. These peptides contained 1) the amino acid sequence surrounding the phosphorylation site of HSP20, 2) a phosphoserine, and 3) a protein transduction domain. Treatment of Swiss 3T3 cells with phosphopeptide analogs of HSP20 led to loss of actin stress fibers and focal adhesion complexes as demonstrated by immunocytochemistry, interference reflection microscopy, and biochemical quantitation of globular-actin. Treatment with phosphopeptide analogs of HSP20 also led to dephosphorylation of the actin depolymerizing protein cofilin. Pull-down assays demonstrated that 14-3-3 proteins associated with phosphopeptide analogs of HSP20 (but not peptide analogs in which the serine was not phosphorylated). The binding of 14-3-3 protein to phosphopeptide analogs of HSP20 prevented the association of cofilin with 14-3-3. These data suggest that HSP20 may modulate actin cytoskeletal dynamics by competing with the actin depolymerizing protein cofilin for binding to the scaffolding protein 14-3-3. Interestingly, the entire protein was not needed for this effect, suggesting that the association is modulated by phosphopeptide motifs of HSP20. These data also suggest the possibility that cyclic nucleotide dependent relaxation of smooth muscle may be mediated by a thin filament (actin) regulatory process. Finally, these data suggest that protein transduction can be used as a tool to elucidate the specific function of peptide motifs of proteins."

Glucose-1-phosphate thymidylyltransferase (RmlA, EC 2.7.7.24) catalyzes the first reaction of the four-step pathway of l-rhamnose biosynthesis, producing dTDP-d-glucose from dTTP and glucose-1-phosphate. Three RmlA homologues of varying size have been identified in the genome of a thermophilic archaeon, Sulfolobus tokodaii strain 7. In this study, we report the heterologous expression of the largest homologue (a 401 residue-long ST0452 protein) and characterization of its thermostable activity. RmlA enzymatic activity of this protein was detected from 65 to 100 °C, with a half-life of 60 min at 95 °C and 180 min at 80 °C. Analysis of a deletion mutant lacking the 170-residue C-terminal domain indicated that this region has an important role in the thermostability and activity of the protein.

Polysaccharides are the outermost structures on a bacterial cell and play a critical role in the interactions between the bacterium and its immediate environment. Such interactions have been implicated as important factors in the virulence of many pathogens (1Roberts I.S. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1996; 50: 285-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). l-Rhamnose was found to be a key component in many bacterial polysaccharides. In Gram-negative bacteria, l-rhamnose is an important residue in the lipopolysaccharide O-antigen, which plays a key role in virulence (2Köplin R. Wang G. Hötte B. Priefer U.B. Pühler A. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 7786-7792Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In mycobacteria, l-rhamnose is present in the arabinogalactan moiety that links the lipid mycolic acid layer to the inner peptidoglycan (3McNeil M. Daffe M. Brennan P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18200-18206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because the attachment of these two layers by l-rhamnose is important for viability of mycobacteria (4Deng L. Mikusova K. Robuck K.G. Scherman M. Brennan P.J. McNeil M.R. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1995; 39: 694-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and l-rhamnose is not present in mammalian polysaccharides, the pathway for l-rhamnose biosynthesis represents a potential target for development of antibacterial drugs. dTDP-l-rhamnose is synthesized from dTTP and glucose-1-phosphate by a conserved four-step reaction catalyzed by glucose-1-phosphate thymidylyltransferase (RmlA, EC 2.7.7.24), dTDP-d-glucose 4,6-dehydratase (RmlB, EC 4.2.1.46), dTDP-6-deoxy-d-xylo-4-hexulose 3,5-epimerase (RmlC, EC 5.1.3.13), and dTDP-6-deoxy-l-xylo-4-hexulose reductase (RmlD, EC 1.1.1.133). l-Rhamnose has not previously been identified in any cell wall polymer from archaea (5Kandler O.

In S. tokodaii strain 7, a gene cluster containing RmlA–D, which includes the ST1971, ST1972, ST1969, and ST1970 ORFs, 1The abbreviations used are: ORF, open reading frame; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography. has been identified. Such a cluster structure for genes encoding RmlA–D is conserved in most microorganisms. In S. tokodaii strain 7, in addition to the RmlA included in this cluster, two other ORFs, ST0452 and ST2352, have been identified as RmlA homologues. However, both ST0452 and ST2352 are located at genomic sites remote from the cluster encoding RmlA–D. It is known that RmlA catalyzes the first step in the l-rhamnose biosynthesis pathway, producing dTDP-d-glucose from dTTP and glucose-1-phosphate, and is the key enzyme for feedback control of the entire l-rhamnose biosynthesis pathway (11Melo A. Glaser L. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 398-405Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Comparison of the putative products of the RmlA-like ORFs indicated that the ST0452 protein would be the largest, mainly because of an additional C-terminal domain. To determine whether the putative protein encoded by ST0452 actually functions as an RmlA enzyme, and what function the extra C-terminal region has, the ST0452 ORF was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. Here, we present evidence that ST0452 encodes an extremely thermostable enzyme with RmlA activity. Analysis of substrate specificity indicated that the enzyme possesses two distinct sugar-1-phosphate nucleotidylyltransferase activities: glucose-1-phosphate thymidylytransferase and N-acetyl-d-glucosamine-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase. Analysis of a deletion mutant indicated that the 170-residue C-terminal region plays an important role for the thermostability of this protein. This is the first report to identify a thermostable enzyme with dual sugar-1-phosphate nucleotidylyltransferase activities. Materials—ATP, CTP, GTP, UTP, dATP, dCTP, dGTP, dTTP, ADP-d-glucose, GDP-d-glucose, dTDP-d-glucose, UDP-d-glucose, UDP-N-acetyl-d-glucosamine, and all sugar-1-phosphates were purchased from Sigma. The restriction enzymes and ligase used in this work were purchased from New England BioLabs, Inc. (Beverly, MA). The KOD-plus DNA polymerase used for PCR amplification was purchased from Toyobo. Co., Ltd. (Osaka, Japan). The plasmid vector pET21(b) was purchased from Novagen (Madison, WI). S. tokodaii strain 7 (JCM10545) was obtained from the Japan Collection of Microorganisms. E. coli strain DH5α was obtained from Takara Bio Inc. (Otsu, Shiga, Japan) for plasmid cloning and the strain BL21-Codon Plus (DE3)-RIL was obtained from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA) for expression of recombinant protein. Construction of Expression Vectors—To amplify and clone the ST0452 ORF, the primer P1 (ATAGCATATGAAGGCATTTATTCTTGCTGC) was designed from the 5′ sequence of ST0452, and primers P2 (TCAACTCGAGCTAGACCTTGAAAAACTCACC) and P3 (TCAACTCGAGGACCTTGAAAAACTCACC) were designed from the 3′ sequence of ST0452. Primer P1 contained an NdeI site, and primers P2 and P3 contained XhoI sites for cloning into the pET21(b) vector. To enable the expression of wild-type gene product from ST0452, primers P1 and P2 were used for PCR amplification. To obtain recombinant protein fused with a histidine tag at the C terminus, primers P1 and P3 were used for PCR amplification. Ten nanograms of S. tokodaii strain 7 genomic DNA and 100 pmol of each primer were added to 50 μl of standard PCR mixture. 25 cycles with a temperature profile of 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 55 °C, and 1 min at 68 °C were performed with 1 unit of KOD-plus DNA polymerase. The PCR products were digested with NdeI and XhoI and ligated with vector pET21(b) digested with the same restriction enzymes. After confirmation of their nucleotide sequences, the plasmids possessing the ST0452 coding region without and with the histidine tag were referred to as pST0452 and pST0452H, respectively. To construct the expression vector for a C-terminal deleted ST0452 gene product with the histidine tag at the C terminus, the primer P4 (TCAACTCGAGATTTTGACTAAATACAAGATTATCTAAAGC) was designed from the nucleotide sequence 510 bp upstream from the stop codon. The product of the PCR using primers P1 and P4 was digested with the restriction enzymes NdeI and XhoI and then ligated with the vector pET21(b). This plasmid construct was designated as pST0452(N231)H. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Protein—After confirmation of expression vector constructs by sequencing, these vectors were introduced into the E. coli strain BL21-Codon Plus (DE3)-RIL cells. Transformed E. coli was grown in 2 ml of LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 50 μg/ml chloramphenicol at 37 °C until the A600 reached 0.6. Isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.1 mm, and aeration was continued for 4 h at 37 °C to induce expression of recombinant proteins. After induction, the cells were collected by centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 5 min and suspended in 100 μl of 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and 0.5 m NaCl. The suspended cells were ruptured by sonication with a Bioruptor (Cosmo Bio Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan), using 10 cycles of 30-s pulses followed by a 30-s rest on ice. The suspension was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was collected as the soluble fraction. The soluble fraction was treated at 80 °C for 20 min and then centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 10 min. Proteins contained in 10 μl of supernatant were separated by 0.1% SDS, 12% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and detected with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Recombinant proteins expressed in E. coli strain BL21-Codon Plus (DE3)-RIL harboring pST0452H and pST0452(N231)H were purified by the nickel-loaded HiTrap Chelating HP column (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The fractions collected were dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). Purified protein was stored at 4 °C. The protein concentration of the pure fraction was determined by the BCA protein assay reagent kit (Pierce). Enzyme Assays—Enzymatic activity of the recombinant protein was analyzed by the method described by Lindquist et al. (12Lindquist L. Kaiser R. Reeves P.R. Lindberg A.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 211: 763-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) with some modification. The assay for the reaction producing the dTDP-d-glucose from α-d-glucose-1-phosphate and dTTP, the forward reaction, was performed in a 30-μl reaction mixture containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm α-d-glucose-1-phosphate, 0.1 mm dTTP, and 0.05 μg of purified recombinant protein. After 2 min of preincubation at 80 °C, the reaction was started by the addition of the recombinant protein and progressed at 80 °C for 5 min as a standard. The reaction mixture was immediately mixed with 300 μl of 500 mm KH2PO4 to stop the reaction. A 50-μl aliquot of the solution was analyzed on a Waters LC module I plus (Waters, Milford, MA) HPLC system with a 0.46 × 25-cm column of Wakosil 5C18–200 (Wako, Osaka, Japan). The flow rate of 500 mm KH2PO4 was maintained at 1 ml/min. The product of the reaction, dTDP-d-glucose, was monitored by absorbance at 254 nm, and the amount of product was calculated from the area under the peaks. The assay for the formation of dTTP from dTDP-d-glucose and pyrophosphate, the reverse reaction, was performed in 30 μl of reaction mixture containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm pyrophosphate, 0.1 mm dTDP-d-glucose, and 0.05 μg of purified recombinant protein. The reaction conditions and detection of the product, dTTP, were identical to those used for the forward reaction. Construction of Expression Vector for ST0452—The 1206-bp ST0452 ORF was predicted to be a homologue of RmlA on the basis of sequence similarity. A putative 401-amino acid residue gene product of ST0452 showed 26–30% identity with the RmlA enzymes from Salmonella enterica (13Li Q. Reeves P.R.

Amino acid sequences for the nucleotide and sugar-binding motifs, the exact sequences of which are (G)GXGTRX9K and EKPXXPXS, respectively (18Thorson J.S. Kelly T.M. Liu H.W. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 1840-1849Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), were identified in ST0452 as shown in Fig. 1. In comparison with the RmlA from E. coli and P. aeruginosa, the protein encoded by ST0452 has an additional ∼170-residue domain at the C terminus. A putative ribosome-binding site, GGTAAT, and a putative promoter consensus sequence, TTTAAC, were identified at 4 and 19 bases, respectively, upstream from the translation initiation codon for ST0452. Based on these elements, ST0452 was expected to be transcriptionally active in S. tokodaii strain 7 cells. To investigate the function of the ST0452-encoded protein, two expression vectors, pST0452 and pST0452H, were constructed according to the procedure described under “Experimental Procedures.” Expression and Purification of the ST0452 Protein—Recombinant protein with or without a histidine tag at the C-terminal region was obtained from E. coli harboring the plasmids pST0452H and pST0452, respectively. As shown in lane 1 in Fig. 2, recombinant protein with a histidine tag was detected in the soluble fraction. This recombinant protein remained soluble after 20 min of treatment at 80 °C, as shown in lane 2 in Fig. 2. Hence, the recombinant protein with a histidine tag was purified by nickel affinity column chromatography after heating. As Fig. 2 also shows, SDS-PAGE detected a purified protein as a single band with an approximate molecular mass of 46 kDa, consistent with the molecular mass expected from the nucleotide sequence. The purified recombinant protein was used in the following enzymatic analyses. RmlA Activity of the Recombinant Protein—RmlA activity, catalyzing the forward reaction that produces dTDP-d-glucose from dTTP and α-d-glucose-1-phosphate, was analyzed using purified recombinant protein fused with a histidine tag, because this species, partially purified by heat treatment, possessed identical RmlA activity to the wild-type recombinant protein (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 3A, dTTP and dTDP-d-glucose were independently detected as peaks with different elution times on the Wakosil 5C18–200 column. Consequently, time-dependent formation and accumulation of dTDP-d-glucose was observed when dTTP and α-d-glucose-1-phosphate were incubated with the recombinant protein at 80 °C for the different periods indicated in Fig. 3B. Activity catalyzing the reverse reaction of RmlA, which produces dTTP from dTDP-d-glucose and pyrophosphate, was also detected in this recombinant protein (data not shown). These results demonstrate that the recombinant protein encoded by ST0452 indeed exhibits thermostable RmlA activity. Optimal pH, Optimal Temperature, and Thermostability for RmlA Activity—The effect of pH on the forward reaction of RmlA activity was analyzed using three different solutions: acetate-NaOH buffer for pH 5, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid-NaOH buffer for pH 6, and Tris-HCl buffer for pH 7–10. The recombinant protein exhibited relatively high activity around pH 7.5 and 9, with maximum activity at pH 8.5 (Fig. 4A). This optimal pH is considerably different from that of the surrounding environment for growth of the host cell, which is between pH 2 and 4, indicating that the intracellular environment of S. tokodaii strain 7 might be maintained at approximately neutral pH. Because the recombinant protein was originally cloned from a thermophilic archaeon, S. tokodaii strain 7, which grows optimally at 80 °C, the temperature dependence of the enzymatic activity was analyzed between 37 and 100 °C. As shown in Fig. 4B, the enzyme had relatively high activity between 80 and 100 °C with a maximum at 95 °C. Because the activity was greatest at high temperatures, the stability of the protein at those temperatures was examined. Purified recombinant protein, 0.05 mg/ml in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 2 mm MgCl2 was treated at 80 or 95 °C for the periods indicated in Fig. 4C, and then the relative activity was measured by the standard assay. The half-life of the enzyme at 95 °C was about 60 min but was 180 min at 80 °C. This indicates that the protein encoded by ST0452 is an extremely thermostable enzyme. Effect of Metal Ions on RmlA Activity—Because it is well known that the nucleotide- or nucleic acid-modifying enzymes require metal ions for catalytic activity, the effects of different metal ions on the forward reaction catalyzed by the recombinant protein were investigated. As indicated in Table I, the enzymatic activity of the recombinant protein has an absolute requirement for a divalent cation, with no RmlA activity detectable when a divalent cation was absent from the reaction buffer. The order of effectiveness of metal ions on the activity of the enzyme was Co2+ > Mn2+ > Mg2+ and Zn2+. Because Mg2+ was the most common of these metal ions in the reaction buffer, the effect of Mg2+ concentration was measured in reaction mixtures containing 2–12 mm MgCl2. The results indicated that the optimal Mg2+ concentration was 6 mm, but the enzymatic activity did not change substantially between 2 and 12 mm (data not shown).Table IRmlA activities of the recombinant protein in the presence of different metal ions The metal ion concentration used was 2 mm.

Calculation of Km for each substrate was performed under conditions where the concentration of the second substrate was 5–10 times higher than its Km value. Because the protein had relatively high activity with dTTP and α-d-glucose-1-phosphate as the substrate combination, the kinetic constants were determined for these substrates. For the forward reaction of RmlA, the apparent Km values for dTTP and α-d-glucose-1-phosphate were 0.02 ± 0.002 and 1.12 ± 0.04 mm, respectively. As indicated in Table II, the Vmax for the forward reaction was 1.46 ± 0.025 μmol/min/mg. The kinetic constants for the reverse reaction catalyzed by RmlA activity were determined as indicated in the previous section. The calculated Km values for dTDP-d-glucose and pyrophosphate were 0.05 ± 0.009 and 0.39 ± 0.028 mm, respectively.Table IIKinetic properties for the RmlA activity of the ST0452 recombinant proteinSubstrateKmVmaxmMμmol/min/mg proteinForward reactiondTTP0.02 ± 0.0021.46 ± 0.025α-d-glucose-1-phosphate1.12 ± 0.040Reverse reactiondTDP-d-glucose0.05 ± 0.00913.65 ± 1.306Pyrophosphate0.39 ± 0.028 Open table in a new tab Substrate Specificity of the Recombinant Enzyme—The report by Lidquist et al. (12Lindquist L. Kaiser R. Reeves P.R. Lindberg A.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 211: 763-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) indicated that the RmlA protein from S. enterica was capable of utilizing several different sugar-1-phosphates and nucleoside triphosphates as substrates. Consequently, the specificity of the ST0452 recombinant protein for various nucleoside triphosphates (0.1 mm) and sugar-1-phosphates (10 mm) in the forward reaction was examined under the standard assay conditions. Initially, the specificity for various nucleoside triphosphates was examined. When α-d-glucose-1-phosphate was utilized as an acceptor substrate, the highest activity was with UTP, which was 1.2 times higher than that with dTTP. As shown in Table III, enzymatic activity with dCTP, dGTP, and dATP was 110, 47, and 40%, respectively, of the level of activity with dTTP. These results indicate that the enzyme is capable of utilizing all four major deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates as substrates but only UTP of the ribonucleoside triphosphates. Because high activity was obtained with the combination of dTTP or UTP and α-d-glucose-1-phosphate, the effect of various sugar-1-phosphate species on enzymatic activity was analyzed using both dTTP and UTP.Table IIISubstrate specificity of the ST0452 enzyme ND, not detected.Direction of reactionSubstrate ASubstrate BSpecific activityμmol/min/mg proteinForwarddTTPα-d-Glucose-1-phosphate1.35 ± 0.09dCTP1.46 ± 0.10dGTP0.62 ± 0.06dATP0.53 ± 0.09UTP1.57 ± 0.16ATP/CTP/GTPNDdTTPN-Acetyl-glucosamine-1-phosphate7.87 ± 0.39α-d-Glucosamine-1-phosphateNDα-d-Galactose-1-phosphateNDα-d-Mannose-1-phosphateNDUTPN-Acetyl-glucosamine-1-phosphate6.42 ± 0.29α-d-Glucosamine-1-phosphateNDα-d-Galactose-1-phosphateNDα-d-Mannose-1-phosphateNDReversedTDP-d-glucosePyrophosphate9.40 ± 0.87UDP-d-glucose7.48 ± 0.35UDP-N-acetyl-d-glucosamine16.34 ± 0.47GDP-d-glucoseND Open table in a new tab As shown in Table III, the highest activity was detected with N-acetyl-d-glucosamine-1-phosphate in the presence of dTTP or UTP. The activity with N-acetyl-d-glucosamine-1-phosphate combined with dTTP or UTP was 5.8 and 3.4 times higher, respectively, than the corresponding activity with α-d-glucose-1-phosphate. Other sugar-1-phosphates tested, including α-d-galactose-1-phosphate, α-d-glucosamine-1-phosphate, and α-d-mannose-1-phosphate, were not utilized as substrates by the recombinant protein. These results indicated that the high activity of the recombinant protein was detected when dTTP or UTP and α-d-glucose-1-phosphate or N-acetyl-d-glucosamine-1-phosphate were used as substrates. Previous studies have indicated that RmlA is capable of utilizing α-d-galactose-1-phosphate and α-d-glucosamine-1-phosphate as substrates but not N-acetyl-d-glucosamine-1-phosphate (12Lindquist L. Kaiser R. Reeves P.R. Lindberg A.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 211: 763-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In addition, an N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate uridyltranferase (GlmU) enzyme capable of utilizing N-acetyl-d-glucosamine-1-phosphate could only utilize UTP but not dTTP as a nucleotide substrate (19Brown K. Pompeo F. Dixon S. Mengin-Lecreulx D. Cambillau C. Bourne Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4096-4107Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Therefore, the enzymatic activity possessed by the ST0452 protein is distinctly different from that of other nucleotidylyltransferases (12Lindquist L. Kaiser R. Reeves P.R. Lindberg A.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 211: 763-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 19Brown K. Pompeo F. Dixon S. Mengin-Lecreulx D. Cambillau C. Bourne Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4096-4107Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Because the enzymatic activity of the recombinant protein was shown to have a broad substrate specificity in the forward reaction, the substrate specificity in the reverse reaction was analyzed with sugar nucleotides at a concentration of 0.1 mm. Production of dTTP, UTP, or UTP was detected when dTDP-d-glucose, UDP-d-glucose, or UDP-N-acetyl-d-glucosamine, respectively, was used as the substrate. However, GTP was not detected when GDP-d-glucose was used as substrate, as was the case in the corresponding forward reaction. The highest activity was detected with UDP-N-acetyl-d-glucosamine, followed by dTDP-d-glucose and UDP-d-glucose. Role of the C-terminal Domain of the Recombinant Protein—In contrast with RmlA from E. coli, the protein encoded by ST0452 has an additional 170-residue C-terminal domain. To determine the function of this region, a plasmid vector containing a truncated gene encoding a protein lacking the 170-residue C-terminal domain was constructed. For this purpose, the 231st amino acid was directly fused to the histidine tag sequence in pET21(b); the resulting plasmid was designated pST0452(N231)H. The truncated protein, ST0452(N231)H, was expressed in E. coli and purified by nickel affinity column chromatography. Fig. 5 indicates that ST0452(N231)H remained soluble after treatment at 60 °C or below for 5 min but was precipitated after heating above 70 °C. This indicated that the tertiary structure of this truncated protein was drastically changed between 60 and 70 °C. This truncated enzyme, with decreased thermostability, was also analyzed for RmlA activity. Although the truncated protein did not precipitated until 60 °C when analyzed by SDS-PAGE, it was not expected to possess the complete RmlA activity exhibited by the full-length enzyme. Therefore, analyses of RmlA activity for both the truncated and the full-length ST0452 proteins were performed at 37 °C, the optimal temperature for the E. coli enzyme. It was shown that the truncated protein exhibited RmlA activity with a specific initial velocity of 1.59 ± 0.03 nmol/min/mg protein; this value was 23 times lower than that of the native enzyme when measured at 37 °C, which was 36.72 ± 2.01 nmol/min/mg protein. The fact that the truncated enzyme possessed residual RmlA activity promoted the next question, which was whether the radical structural change induced by heat treatment affected the enzymatic activity. To determine this, N-acetyl-d-glucosamine-1-phosphate uridyltransferase activity remaining after 5 min of treatment of the truncated enzyme at different temperatures was measured. As shown in Fig. 6, N-acetyl-d-glucosamine-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase activity remained in the truncated enzyme after 5 min of heating at 65 °C but was completely removed by treatment over 70 °C. These results indicated that the additional C-terminal domain of ST0452 plays an important role in both the thermostability"
https://openalex.org/W2077087158,"The finding that aggregates of disease-unrelated proteins can induce cell death indicates that proteins may act as potential toxins. Cells experiencing toxic protein aggregates often display modifications of the redox status and ion balance, eventually leading to apoptosis; however, in some cases, tissue and cultured cell types die with features of necrosis. To elucidate the pathways leading to such different outcomes, we studied the biochemical features of death in H-END and NIH/3T3 cells exposed to prefibrillar aggregates of a disease-unrelated protein. The two types of cells died by apoptosis and necrosis, respectively. The pattern of caspase and proapoptotic factor activation was investigated together with the extent of mitochondria impairment and the energy load in either cell line. Our data depict a scenario where the events related to the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis are the same in the two cell lines, the difference in the final outcome being related to the extent of mitochondria derangement, possibly due to the different ability of the cells to counteract ion homeostasis impairment."
https://openalex.org/W2155418873,"CCAAT enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) transcription factors regulate adipocyte differentiation, and recent evidence suggests that osteoblasts and adipocytes share a common pluripotent progenitor in bone marrow. However, little is known about the role of C/EBP transcription factors in the control of osteoblast differentiation or function. In this study, the function of C/EBP transcription factors was disrupted in osteoblast lineage cells by overexpressing a naturally occurring dominant negative C/EBP isoform. Expression of FLp20C/EBPbeta was driven by a 3.6-kb Col1a1 promoter/first intron construct, and four transgenic (TG) mouse lines were established. Northern blotting and reverse transcription-PCR indicated that the transgene was targeted to bone, with lower levels of expression in lung, skin, and adipose tissue. TG mice from two lines showed reduced body weight compared with wild type littermates. All TG lines showed evidence of osteopenia, ranging from mild to severe, as evidenced by reduced trabecular bone volume. Severely affected lines also showed reduced cortical bone width. Dynamic histomorphometry demonstrated an associated decrease in mineral apposition and bone formation rates. Long bones and calvariae of TG mice showed reduced COL1A1 and osteocalcin mRNA levels and increased bone sialoprotein mRNA, consistent with an inhibition of terminal osteoblast differentiation. Ex vivo analysis of primary osteoblast differentiation showed similar effects on marker expression and reduced expression of the mature osteoblast marker Col2.3-green fluorescent protein, demonstrating a cell-autonomous effect of the transgene. These data suggested that C/EBP transcription factors may be important determinants of osteoblast function and bone mass."

These signals usually contain an essential tyrosine or pair of leucine residues. Both tyrosine- and dileucine-based endocytosis signals are recognized by the adaptor complex AP-2. The best understood of these interactions occurs between the tyrosine-based motif, YXXΦ, and the μ2 subunit of AP-2. We recently reported a tryptophan-based endocytosis signal, WLSL, contained within the cytoplasmic domain of the neonatal Fc receptor. This signal resembles YXXΦ. We have investigated the mechanism by which the tryptophan-based signal is recognized. Both interaction assays in vitro and endocytosis assays in vivo show that μ2 binds the tryptophan-based signal. Furthermore, the WLSL sequence binds the same site as YXXΦ. Unlike the WXXF motif, contained in stonin 2 and other endocytic proteins, WLSL does not bind the α subunit of AP-2.

The presence of FcRn at the plasma membrane suggests that the receptor is delivered to early endosomes by endocytosis even in cells in which it binds IgG intracellularly (although an additional direct route from the trans Golgi network cannot be excluded). Thus, endocytosis signals are likely important for FcRn function in all cells in which it is expressed. The endocytosis signal that includes Trp-311 of rat FcRn also includes Leu-314, but not amino acids 307 to 310, 312, 313, or 315 (7Wu Z. Simister N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5240-5247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The other aromatic amino acids, tyrosine and phenylalanine, can be substituted for Trp-311 (7Wu Z.

However, tryptophan rather than tyrosine is found in the position corresponding to 311 from all species examined: human (13Story C.M. Mikulska J.E. Simister N.E. J. Exp.

Both dileucine- and tyrosine-based endocytosis signals are recognized by AP-2 adaptor proteins at the plasma membrane (43Glickman J.N. Conibear E. Pearse B.M.

Science. 1995; 269: 1872-1875Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar), and this is the best understood interaction of AP-2. Crystal structures of μ2 with peptides containing YXXΦ motifs show the two critical side chains accommodated by pockets in the adaptor protein (52Owen D.J. Evans P.R. Science. 1998; 282: 1327-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). The tyrosine binding pocket includes Asp-176 and Trp-421 of μ2 (52Owen D.J. Evans P.R. Science. 1998; 282: 1327-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar), and alanine substitution in these positions prevents YXXΦ binding (53Nesterov A. Carter R.E. Sorkina T. Gill G.N. Sorkin A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2489-2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). YXXΦ binding is also prevented by competition with the tyrosine structural analog tyrphostin A23 (54Crump C.M. Williams J.L.

In this paper, we address the question of how the tryptophan-based endocytosis signal of rat FcRn, WLSL, is recognized. First we asked whether it interacted with μ2. Then we asked whether it was recognized by μ2 in a manner similar to YXXΦ. Additionally, in light of recent publications illustrating an interaction between tryptophan-containing signals and the α-adaptin ear domain (56Ritter B. Philie J. Girard M. Tung E.C. Blondeau F. McPherson P.S. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 1089-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 57Jha A. Agostinelli N.R. Mishra S.K. Keyel P.A. Hawryluk M.J. Traub L.M. J. Biol.

A. 2004; 101: 964-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), we also explored the possibility of an interaction between FcRn and α-adaptin. Finally, we investigated the requirement for the tyrosine binding pocket of μ2 in vivo by analyzing the effect of tyrphostin A23 on endocytosis. Our results showed that μ2 recognized the WLSL and YXXΦ endocytosis signals in analogous fashions. This revealed an unexpected versatility in the recognition of signals by μ2. Cell Lines and Culture—Rat inner medullary collecting duct (IMCD) cells and their transfected derivatives were cultured as described previously (59McCarthy K.M. Yoong Y. Simister N.E. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1277-1285PubMed Google Scholar). The lines expressing wild-type rat FcRn and mutants L322A/L323A and W311A/L322A/L323A have been described before (7Wu Z. Simister N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5240-5247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Plasmid Constructs—DNA encoding glutathione S-transferase (GST) fused to the cytoplasmic domain of rat FcRn beginning with Arg-302 (GST-FcRncyt) was subcloned into pGEX 1Z-T (Amersham Biosciences). A similar construct was made in which the codon for Trp-311 of FcRn was replaced with an alanine codon (GST-FcRncyt W311A). DNA encoding GST fusions with the amino acids (APWLSL)3, representing amino acids 309–314 of rat FcRn, and with (APALSL)3, in which the Trp is replaced with Ala, were also subcloned into pGEX 1Z-T. DNA encoding GST-stonin 2 (human, amino acids 1–555) was in pGEX4T (58Walther K. Diril M.K. Jung N. Haucke V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 964-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), and DNA encoding His-tagged rat μ2 (amino acids 157–435), both wild-type and W421A, was in pET28a (60Rohde G. Wenzel D. Haucke V. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). DNA encoding His-tagged rat α-adaptin ear domain (amino acids 702–938) was subcloned into pET28a, in-frame with the N-terminal His-tag. DNA encoding full-length human CD4 was in pRK5 (61Pitcher C. Honing S. Fingerhut A. Bowers K. Marsh M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 677-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Expression of GST Fusion Proteins—GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) RIL. Half-liter cultures were grown at 30 °C to an A600 of 0.8. Protein expression was induced with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h at 30 °C. Cells were harvested and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Thawed cells were resuspended in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4, containing lysozyme, 1 mm PMSF, and both mammalian and bacterial protease inhibitor cocktails (Sigma). Suspensions were sonicated on ice twice for 30 s at 50% duty cycle using a Fisher Scientific Sonic Dismembrator 550 with a microtip probe. Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 1%, and the lysates were cleared by centrifugation for 10 min at 12,000 rpm and 4 °C in a Sorvall SS34 rotor (Newtown, CT). Each supernatant was incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with 20 μl of a 75% slurry of glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) that had been washed with PBS, pH 7.4. The beads were washed three times with ice-cold PBS containing 1 mm PMSF. Fusion proteins were eluted by two incubations at room temperature with 100 μl of 10 mm reduced glutathione, 50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8. Pooled eluates were dialyzed at 4 °C against PBS, pH 7.4. The protein concentrations were determined by A280 using their calculated extinction coefficients. Glycerol was added to each to a concentration of 10%. Protein aliquots were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C. GST-stonin was purified as described above, but with the following modifications. Protein expression was induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 4 h at 30 °C. The thawed cells were resuspended in ice-cold 3 m urea containing lysozyme, 1 mm PMSF, 2.5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin. After sonication, no Triton X-100 was added before the solution was centrifuged. The supernatant was dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against PBS containing 0.5 mm PMSF, 2 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. This solution was cleared by centrifugation for 20 min at 12,000 rpm at 4 °C in a Sorvall SS34 rotor. The supernatant was incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with 500 μl of a 75% slurry of glutathione-Sepharose 4B that had been washed with PBS, pH 7.4. The beads were washed three times with ice-cold PBS containing 1 mm PMSF, 2 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Fusion proteins were eluted at room temperature with 1 ml of 20 mm reduced glutathione, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 20 mm NaOH. Pooled eluates were dialyzed at 4 °C against PBS, pH 7.4, containing 1 mm dithiothreitol. Expression of His-tagged Fusion Proteins—His-tagged μ2 was expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) RIL. Half-liter cultures were grown at 30 °C to an A600 of 0.8. Protein expression was induced by 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h at 30 °C. Cell pellets were frozen in liquid nitrogen. Thawed cells were resuspended in ice-cold phosphate buffer, containing 1.14 m NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 4.3 mm Na2HPO4·7H2O, 1.4 mm KH2PO4, lysozyme, 1 mm PMSF, 2.5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin, pH 7.5. Suspensions were sonicated as above. CHAPS was added to a concentration of 2%, and the lysates were cleared as above. PBS was added to the supernatant to dilute the NaCl to 300 mm. Imidazole was added to a concentration of 10 mm, and each supernatant was incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with 500 μl of a 50% slurry of TALON Metal Affinity Resin (BD Biosciences Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) and 500 μl of a 50% slurry of Sepharose CL-4B beads (Amersham Biosciences), prewashed in PBS, pH 7.4. The beads were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate buffer, containing 440 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 4.3 mm Na2HPO4·H2O, 1.4 mm KH2PO4, 10 mm imidazole, 1 mm PMSF, 2.5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin, pH 7.4. Purified His-tagged fusion proteins were eluted in ice-cold phosphate buffer, containing 440 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 4.3 mm Na2HPO4·7H2O, 1.4 mm KH2PO4, 300 mm imidazole, 1 mm PMSF, 2.5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin, pH 7.4, for 1 h at 4 °C. The eluate was dialyzed at 4 °C against ice-cold Hepes buffer, containing 10 mm Hepes, 500 mm NaCl, and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.4. Protein concentrations were determined, and proteins were frozen with glycerol and stored as described above. Peptides—Peptides representing amino acids 302–315 of rat FcRn and of FcRn mutant W311A, and amino acids 989–1002 of human epidermal growth factor receptor, each with an additional N-terminal cysteine (respectively, CRMRSGLPAPWLSLS, CRMRSGLPAPALSLS, and CLPSPTDSNFYRALM), were made by SynPep (Dublin, CA). Tyrphostins (Calbiochem) were stored as 350 mm (A23) or 8 mm (A51) stock solutions in Me2SO at -20 °C and added to solutions just before use. GST Pull-down Experiments—For each pull-down, 20 μg of GST fusion protein was precleared by incubating in 500 μl of PBS, 1 mm PMSF, pH 7.4, for 10 min at 4 °C, then microcentrifuging for 5 min at 2,500 rpm. The supernatant was added to 20 μl of glutathione-Sepharose (prewashed twice with PBS, pH 7.4) and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. The suspension was then microcentrifuged for 5 min at 2,500 rpm. The supernatant was removed, and the beads and bound proteins were kept on ice. For each pull-down, 10 μg of His-tagged μ2 or α-adaptin was precleared by incubating for 10 min at 4 °C in 500 μl of binding buffer (20 mm Hepes, 200 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm PMSF, pH 8), then microcentrifuging for 5 min at 14,000 rpm. The supernatant was collected. For peptide competition experiments, 0.2 mm peptide was then incubated with the μ2 supernatant for 15 min at room temperature. For tyrphostin competition experiments, 1:100 Me2SO, 3.5 mm A23, or 80 μm A51 was then incubated with the μ2 supernatant for 15 min at room temperature. The His-tagged fusion protein, precleared (and preincubated with peptide or tyrphostin as appropriate), was added to each tube containing GST proteins bound to glutathione-Sepharose. The beads were resuspended and then incubated for 3 h at 4 °C. (All competition experiments were only incubated for 45 min.) They were washed three times for 5 min with binding buffer. After the final wash, the last of the buffer was removed with a fine, flat-ended, pipette tip. Proteins were eluted from the beads in 20 μl of 2× Laemmli sample buffer containing 2-mercaptoethanol (62Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205523) Google Scholar) by heating for 5 min at 100 °C. Proteins were resolved on 4–20% acrylamide Novex Tris-glycine gels (Invitrogen). The gels were either stained with Coomassie Blue or probed by Western blotting with anti-polyhistidine tag antibodies. Western Blots—Western blots were done essentially as described previously (16Simister N.E. Story C.M. Chen H.-L. Hunt J.S. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 1527-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Briefly, gels were electroblotted onto Invitrolon polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Invitrogen). Blots were probed with mouse monoclonal antibodies against the polyhistidine tag (Roche Applied Science), diluted 1:250. Bound antibodies were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG (Amersham Biosciences) and Western Lightning Chemiluminescence Reagent Plus (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Protein Iodination—The Fc fragment of human IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA) was labeled to a specific activity of ∼0.5 Ci μmol-1 with Na125I (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using IODO-GEN (Pierce). Fc Endocytosis Assay—Cells were seeded into 6-well plates and assayed when about 70% confluent. Cells were incubated with prewarmed DMEM, 1 mm KI, 1.5% fish gelatin, 25 mm Hepes (DMEM-KIGH), pH 8, for 1 h at 37 °C. The cells were washed once with 1 ml of prewarmed DMEM-KIGH, pH 6 (except for the 0 time point, which was washed with cold DMEM-KIGH). One ml of prewarmed DMEM-KIGH, pH 6, containing 125I-Fc (1 × 106 cpm/per well) and either 1:1,000 Me2SO (as a vehicle control), 350 μm A23 (from a 350 mm stock in Me2SO), or 8 μm A51 (from an 8 mm stock in Me2SO) was added to the cells (except for the 0 time point to which cold DMEM-KIGH was added). In addition, 600 μg/ml cold competitor IgG was added to half of the cells. The cells were incubated at 37 °C for 0, 2, 4, or 8 min. Endocytosis was stopped by cooling the cells on ice and washing them four times with ice-cold, DMEM-KIGH, pH 6, containing tyrphostin or Me2SO. The cells were then incubated on ice for 45 min with 1 ml of DMEM-KIGH, pH 8. This medium was collected and counted (cpmsurface1) in a CliniGamma 1272 γ counter (LKB Wallac, Piscataway, NJ). Another ml of DMEM-KIGH, pH 8, was added, collected, and counted (cpmsurface2). The cells were lysed with 1 ml of 0.1 m NaOH, and the lysates were counted (cpminternal). The percent of Fc internalized (internal/surface) was calculated with the Equation 1.%Fc internalized=cpminternal/(cpmsurface1+cpmsurface2)(Eq. 1) Specific binding and endocytosis were calculated by subtracting the percent of Fc internalized in the presence of competing IgG from the percent internalized in its absence. As a background correction, the percent of Fc internalized at time 0 was subtracted from the percent internalized at each time point. Fluid Phase Endocytosis Assay—Cells were seeded into 6-well plates and assayed when about 70% confluent. Cells were incubated with prewarmed DMEM-KIGH, pH 8, for 1 hat 37 °C. The cells were washed once with 1 ml of prewarmed DMEM-KIGH, pH 6. Then, 1 ml of prewarmed DMEM-KIGH, pH 6, containing 30 μm dextran-Alexa 488 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and either 350 μm A23 (from a 350 mm stock in Me2SO) or 1 μl of Me2SO was added to the cells. The cells were incubated at 37 °C for 8 min. Endocytosis was stopped by cooling the cells on ice and washing them four times with ice-cold DMEM-KIGH, pH 6. The cells were then incubated on ice for 45 min with 1 ml of DMEM-KIGH, pH 8. This medium was removed, and the cells were washed a second time with 1 ml of DMEM-KIGH, pH 8. The cells were washed once with 1 ml of PBS and were subsequently lysed in 0.5 ml of PBS containing 1% Triton X-100. The amount of dextran-Alexa Fluor 488 taken up by the cells was measured with a fluorometer (Photon Technology International, Lawrenceville, NJ). These amounts were converted into apparent volume"
https://openalex.org/W1987093124,"Five amino acid residues responsible for extreme stability have been identified in cytochrome c552 (HT c552) from a thermophilic bacterium, Hydrogenobacter thermophilus. The five residues, which are spatially distributed in three regions of HT c552, were replaced with the corresponding residues in the homologous but less stable cytochrome c551 (PA c551) from Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The quintuple HT c552 variant (A7F/M13V/Y34F/Y43E/I78V) showed the same stability against guanidine hydrochloride denaturation as that of PA c551, suggesting that the five residues in HT c552 necessarily and sufficiently contribute to the overall stability. In the three HT c552 variants carrying mutations in each of the three regions, the Y34F/Y43E mutations resulted in the greatest destabilization, by –13.3 kJ mol–1, followed by A7F/M13V (–3.3 kJ mol–1) and then I78V (–1.5 kJ mol–1). The order of destabilization in HT c552 was the same as that of stabilization in PA c551 with reverse mutations such as F34Y/E43Y, F7A/V13M, and V78I (13.4, 10.3, and 0.3 kJ mol–1, respectively). The results of guanidine hydrochloride denaturation were consistent with those of thermal denaturation for the same variants. The present study established a method for reciprocal mutation analysis. The effects of side-chain contacts were experimentally evaluated by swapping the residues between the two homologous proteins that differ in stability.

Proteins from thermophilic bacteria usually exhibit enhanced stability against temperature or denaturants compared with the homologues from mesophiles (1Jaenicke R. Bohm G. Curr. Opin. Struct.

Sequence comparison and rationally designed mutations of thermophilic and mesophilic proteins provide several lines of information on protein stability. In particular, investigation of the relationship between three-dimensional structure and thermodynamic parameters on protein unfolding provides detailed information on factors contributing to the stability.

Uchiyama S. Kobayashi Y. Igarashi Y. Hasegawa J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 3355-3361Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). These two proteins exhibit 56% sequence identity and have almost the same backbone conformations, but HT c552 is much more stable than PA c551 (5Sanbongi Y. Igarashi Y. Kodama T.

Protein Eng. 2002; 15: 455-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). On precise structural comparison between HT c552 and PA c551, we predicted that five amino acid residues spatially located in three regions were responsible for the higher stability of HT c552 (6Hasegawa J. Yoshida T. Yamazaki T. Sambongi Y. Yu Y. Igarashi Y. Kodama T. Yamazaki K. Kyogoku Y. Kobayashi Y. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9641-9649Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). These residues were then introduced at the corresponding positions in PA c551 (7Hasegawa J. Shimahara H. Mizutani M. Uchiyama S. Arai H. Ishii M. Kobayashi Y. Ferguson S.J. Sambongi Y. Igarashi Y. J.

Protein Eng. 2002; 15: 455-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The single mutation Val-78 to Ile (V78I) and two double mutations Phe-7 to Ala/Val-13 to Met (F7A/V13M) and Phe-34 to Tyr/Glu-43 to Tyr (F34Y/E43Y) in the corresponding three regions of PA c551 resulted in enhanced protein stability in an additive manner. Although the five residues were proved to be effective for stability, e.g. the denaturation temperature was elevated by more than 30 °C when they were introduced into the PA c551, their roles in the original HT c552 remain unknown. For an understanding of the high stability of HT c552, the protein should be subjected to mutagenesis study. In this context, the HT c552 gene was first expressed as a modified holoprotein that had a covalently attached heme group in the cytoplasm of Escherichia coli or Paracoccus denitrificans with the attachment of an N-terminal Met residue (10Sanbongi Y. Yang J.-H. Igarashi Y. Kodama T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 198: 7-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 11Sambongi Y. Ferguson S.J. FEBS Lett. 1994; 340: 65-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Subsequently, the HT c552 apoprotein was targeted to the periplasm of P. aeruginosa, in which the protein became a holoprotein with the same spectral property as that of the authentic protein (12Zhang Y. Arai H. Sambongi Y. Igarashi Y. Kodama T. J. Ferment. Bioeng. 1998; 85: 346-349Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Recently, HT c552 was expressed in the E. coli periplasm as a holoprotein with the aid of a cellular apparatus for cytochrome c maturation (ccm gene products) (13Karan E.F. Russell B.S. Bren K.L. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2002; 7: 260-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Here we established a new HT c552 expression system involving E. coli as a host and optimized the production level, which in turn facilitated further biophysical analyses of this protein. Amino acid residues were systematically substituted in the three regions of HT c552 with the corresponding residues of the less stable PA c551. The thermodynamic parameters upon unfolding of the variants were compared with those of the reverse variants of PA c551. Bacterial Strains and Plasmids—E. coli DH5α was used to maintain plasmids. E. coli JCB387 was the host for testing the overexpression of HT c552 and its variants (11Sambongi Y. Ferguson S.J. FEBS Lett. 1994; 340: 65-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The gene coding the mature HT c552 had been previously fused with the gene for signal sequence of PA c551 in the 5′ region (12Zhang Y. Arai H. Sambongi Y. Igarashi Y. Kodama T. J. Ferment. Bioeng. 1998; 85: 346-349Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar), which was then inserted into the pKK223–3 vector (ampicillin resistance) under the control of the tac promoter. The resulting plasmid was designated as pKO2 and carried the wild-type HT c552 gene fused with the PA c551 signal sequence. Mutations A7F/M13V, Y34F/Y43E, I78V, and A7F/M13V/Y34F/Y43E/I78V (quintuple) were introduced into the fusion gene by a PCR-based method as described previously (7Hasegawa J. Shimahara H. Mizutani M. Uchiyama S. Arai H. Ishii M. Kobayashi Y. Ferguson S.J. Sambongi Y. Igarashi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37533-37537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). For clarity throughout this paper the residues numbers used are those in PA c551. The resulting mutated HT c552 genes with the PA c551 signal sequence were inserted into the pKK223–3 vector. Plasmid pEC86 (chloramphenicol resistance) carrying the ccmABCDEFGH genes for cytochrome c maturation proteins (14Arslan E. Schulz H. Zufferey R. Kunzler P. Tho ̈ny-Meyer L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 744-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar) was co-transformed into E. coli JCB387 together with pKO2 or its derivatives carrying the mutated genes. Growth Conditions and Preparation of Periplasmic Protein Fractions—E. coli cells containing both pEC86 and pKO2 or their derivatives were initially grown in liquid LB medium containing 100 μg ml–1 ampicillin and 34 μg ml–1 chloramphenicol. The resulting cultures (1 ml) were inoculated into 100 ml of minimal medium containing 0.4% glycerol as a carbon source and the two antibiotics in 500-ml flasks, which were then shaken aerobically at 37 °C for an appropriate period before harvesting. Periplasmic protein fractions of the E. coli cells were obtained by the cold osmotic shock method (15Sambongi Y. Stoll R. Ferguson S.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 1193-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The expressed HT c552 proteins in the periplasmic protein fractions were purified by HiTrap SP column chromatography (Amersham Biosciences), eluting with 25 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0) containing a NaCl concentration gradient (0–500 mm), followed by a Superdex 75 column equilibrated and eluted with 25 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0). The authentic HT c552 protein was also purified by the same method from H. thermophilus cells grown autotrophically as described (3Sanbongi Y. Ishii M. Igarashi Y. Kodama T. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 65-69Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The protein purity was confirmed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. UV-Visible and NMR Spectroscopy and Cyclic Voltammetry of HT c552—UV-visible spectra of HT c552 and its derivatives were measured with a Jasco 530 spectrophotometer. The NMR spectra of oxidized HT c552 at pH 7.2 and 25 °C were recorded on a Bruker Avance 600 FT NMR spectrometer operating at the 1H frequency of 600 MHz. The protein concentration for the NMR analysis was ∼1 mm in 90% H2O 10% 2H2O. Chemical shifts are given in ppm downfield from sodium 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate with the residual H2HO as an internal reference. Cyclic voltammetry assaying of HT c552 was carried out as described elsewhere (16Terui N. Tachiiri N. Matsuo H. Hasegawa J. Uchiyama S. Kobayashi Y. Igarashi Y. Sambongi Y. Yamamoto Y. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 13650-13651Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). All potentials were referenced to the standard hydrogen electrode and calculated from the cyclic voltammogram as described. Protein Denaturation—Thermal denaturation experiments involving circular dichroism (CD) were carried out in a newly developed pressure-proof cell compartment, which was attached to a Jasco J-720 CD spectrometer (17Uchiyama S. Ohshima A. Nakamura S. Hasegawa J. Terui N. Takayama S.J. Yamamoto Y. Sambongi Y. Kobayashi Y. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 14684-14685Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This new apparatus facilitated thermal denaturation up to 180 °C. The oxidized proteins (20 μm) in HCl water (pH 5.0) were subjected to the following analyses. The temperature-dependent CD ellipticity change at 200–250 nm was followed in cuvettes of 1-mm path length. CD spectra were recorded from 40 to 160 °C with temperature intervals of 2–20 °C. The CD ellipticity changes at 222 nm were followed against temperature. Thermodynamic parameters were obtained using non-linear least-squares fitting with MATHEMATICA 3.0 as described previously (17Uchiyama S. Ohshima A. Nakamura S. Hasegawa J. Terui N. Takayama S.J. Yamamoto Y. Sambongi Y. Kobayashi Y. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 14684-14685Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl) denaturation measurement by means of CD and nonlinear least-squares fitting of the data were performed according to the previous methods (7Hasegawa J. Shimahara H. Mizutani M. Uchiyama S. Arai H. Ishii M. Kobayashi Y. Ferguson S.J. Sambongi Y. Igarashi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37533-37537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). HT c552 protein and its derivatives (20 μm) were incubated in diluted HCl water (pH 5.0) with varying concentrations of GdnHCl at 25 °C for 2 h before the measurements to equilibrate the proteins with the denaturant. The CD ellipticity at 222 nm of the protein solutions was measured at 25 °C. The oxidized proteins were used for measurement of denaturation as to both temperature and GdnHCl. Other Procedures—The HT c552 contents in the periplasmic protein fractions were determined by measuring absorption spectra of solutions to which a few grains of solid sodium dithionite had been added. The extinction coefficient for reduced HT c552 at 552 nm, 20,400 m–1 cm–1, was used to calculate the concentration of the cytochrome c. The N-terminal sequence of HT c552 expressed in the E. coli periplasm was determined with an automatic peptide sequencer (Hewlett Packard). Activity staining of SDS gels for covalently bound heme was also performed (18Goodhew C.F. Brown K.R. Pettigrew G.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 852: 288-294Crossref Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The concentrations of the periplasmic protein fractions were estimated by the Bradford method using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Materials—Restriction enzymes, Ex Taq polymerase, T4 DNA ligase, and other reagents for DNA handling were purchased from Takara Shuzou or Toyobo. GdnHCl (Ultra Pure) was purchased from ICN Biomedicals. All other chemicals used were of the highest grade commercially available. Expression of HT c552 in the E. coli Periplasm—The wild-type HT c552 protein expressed in the E. coli JCB387 strain was fully recovered in the periplasmic protein fraction after the cold osmotic shock but not in the membrane and cytoplasmic fractions. The expressed protein had a covalently attached heme, as judged on heme activity staining after separation by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (data not shown). The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the wild-type HT c552 protein expressed in the E. coli periplasm was determined to be Asn-Glu-Gln-Leu-Ala-Lys-Gln, which was identical to that of the authentic protein purified from the native organism, H. thermophilus (3Sanbongi Y. Ishii M. Igarashi Y. Kodama T. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 65-69Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This indicates that the PA c551 signal peptide in the present fusion protein was correctly processed in the E. coli cells. The time course of wild-type HT c552 production during aerobic E. coli growth was followed. The maximal production level (∼25 mg liter–1 (culture)) was obtained several hours after the beginning of the stationary phase of cell growth. This high HT c552 production may be due to (i) the suitability of the PA c551 signal peptide that can target the apo-precursor protein efficiently to the E. coli periplasm, and (ii) the constitutive expression of ccm genes on the plasmid under aerobic conditions where the E. coli growth yield is higher than that under anaerobic ones (a natural control for the ccm genes). The efficient production and easy purification from the E. coli periplasm performed here enabled us to obtain a large amount of correctly processed HT c552, which will facilitate further structural and mutagenesis studies. Spectroscopic and Electrochemical Features of Heterologously Expressed Wild-type HT c552—We next examined whether the heterologously expressed wild-type HT c552 exhibited the same spectroscopic and electrochemical properties as those of the authentic protein. The visible (400–600 nm) spectrum of dithionite-reduced wild-type HT c552 protein expressed in E. coli showed absorption maxima at 417, 521, and 552 nm, which are characteristic features of the authentic HT c552 protein (Fig. 1A). The far ultraviolet CD (200–250 nm) spectrum of the air-oxidized form of the expressed wild-type was also the same as that of the authentic protein, exhibiting CD ellipticity at 222 nm (Fig. 1B). The same properties in CD spectra were observed for all the variants examined in this study (data not shown), indicating that the variants did not markedly differ in terms of secondary structure. Paramagnetically shifted signals arising from heme peripheral methyl and iron-coordinated methionine protons in 1H NMR spectra were similarly observed for the oxidized forms of the expressed wild-type and authentic HT c552 (Fig. 2). These spectroscopic features suggested that His and Met residues are similarly coordinated to the heme iron in the expressed recombinant and authentic HT c552. Thus, the expressed HT c552 polypeptide was correctly folded in the E. coli periplasm and did not differ in the spatial structure around the heme compared with that of the authentic protein. To compare the redox properties of the expressed wild-type HT c552 and the authentic protein, we carried out electrochemical measurements using cyclic voltammogram. At 22 °C and pH 6.0, the redox potential (E°′) value of the expressed protein was +250 mV, which was equivalent within error to that of the authentic value, +247 mV. Previously, we found that the E°′ value of the authentic HT c552 exhibited a negative shift with increasing temperature up to 85 °C (16Terui N. Tachiiri N. Matsuo H. Hasegawa J. Uchiyama S. Kobayashi Y. Igarashi Y. Sambongi Y. Yamamoto Y. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 13650-13651Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This property was also conserved by the present heterologously expressed protein (data not shown). Taken together, holo-HT c552 with a heme covalently attached, which in terms of spectroscopic and electrochemical features is indistinguishable from the native authentic protein, could be expressed in the periplasm of E. coli. Thus, using this expression system for thermophilic HT c552, a site-directed mutagenesis study on the structural origin of its high stability can be performed as described below. The resulting thermodynamic data for HT c552 should be compared with those for a mesophilic counterpart PA c551, that has been expressed in the E. coli periplasm with the aim of a mutagenesis study (7Hasegawa J. Shimahara H. Mizutani M. Uchiyama S. Arai H. Ishii M. Kobayashi Y. Ferguson S.J. Sambongi Y. Igarashi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37533-37537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Destabilization of HT c552 as to GdnHCl Denaturation by Mutations—We first examined whether mutation(s) in HT c552 destabilized the structure as to GdnHCl denaturation. The mutated positions were 7, 13, 34, 43, and 78, where the original amino acid residues were replaced with the corresponding ones found in the less stable PA c551. The mutated residues in HT c552 had been predicted to be responsible for the high stability from the results of three-dimensional structure analysis (6Hasegawa J. Yoshida T. Yamazaki T. Sambongi Y. Yu Y. Igarashi Y. Kodama T. Yamazaki K. Kyogoku Y. Kobayashi Y. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9641-9649Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 shows GdnHCl-induced denaturation curves for HT c552 variants. The value for the midpoint of denaturation (Cm) of the variants (A7F/M13V, Y34F/Y43E, I78V, and A7F/M13V/Y34F/Y43E/I78V) became smaller as compared with that of the wild type (the difference in Cm between the wild-type HT c552 and variants (ΔCm) were –0.76, –1.77, –0.48, and –2.78 M, respectively, Table I). The values for differences in the free energy change in water between the wild type and variants (ΔΔGW) showed that the quintuple A7F/M13V/Y34F/Y43E/I78V variant had nearly the same stability as that of the mesophilic wild-type PA c551. We have already shown that the quintuple reverse mutations in PA c551 (F7A/V13M/F34Y/E43Y/V78I) caused enhancement of stability to level in the wild-type HT c552 (8Hasegawa J. Uchiyama S. Tanimoto Y. Mizutani M. Kobayashi Y. Sambongi Y. Igarashi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37824-37828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). These results together suggest that the five residues in HT c552 (Ala-7, Met-13, Tyr-34, Tyr-43, and Ile-78) necessarily and sufficiently contribute to the overall protein stability.Table IParameters characterizing the denaturation of HT c552 variantsProteinCm (ΔCm)ΔGW (ΔΔGW)Tm (ΔTm)ΔΔGmmkJ mol-1°CkJ mol-1Wild type4.46 ± 0.18 (0)44.9 ± 10.3 (0)121.1 ± 1.0 (0)19.5 ± 9.2I78V3.98 ± 0.18 (-0.48)43.4 ± 8.2 (-1.5)117.8 ± 0.6 (-3.3)17.0 ± 3.3A7F/M13V3.70 ± 0.07 (-0.76)41.6 ± 5.1 (-3.3)117.0 ± 2.5 (-4.1)16.4 ± 4.6Y34F/Y43E2.69 ± 0.05 (-1.77)31.6 ± 1.3 (-13.3)108.3 ± 1.2 (-12.8)9.8 ± 2.1Quintuple1.67 ± 0.06 (-2.78)20.0 ± 4.4 (-24.9)95.2 ± 1.7 (-25.9)0PA c5512.25aData are from Hasegawa et al.

Open table in a new tab Correlation of Stability of the Reciprocal HT c552 and PA c551 Variants—Previously we obtained thermodynamic data for the GdnHCl denaturation of PA c551 variants having reverse mutations at positions 7, 13, 34, 43, and 78 (F7A/V13M, F34Y/E43Y, V78I, and F7A/V13M/F34Y/E43Y/V78I variants, Refs. 7Hasegawa J.

Protein Eng. 2002; 15: 455-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Because the experiments on these variants had been carried out under identical conditions (pH 5.0, 25 °C), we could compare the data with those obtained for the present HT c552 variants. The differences in stability against GdnHCl denaturation (ΔΔGW) between wild-type HT c552 and PA c551 and their reciprocal variants are shown in Fig. 4. In the three regional HT c552 variants (A7F/M13V, Y34F/Y43E, and I78V), the Y34F/Y43E mutations most strongly destabilized HT c552 as to GdnHCl denaturation (ΔΔGW = –13.3 kJ mol–1, Table I). Remarkably, the corresponding stabilizing effect of the reverse mutations (F34Y/E43Y) was prominent in the PA c551 variants under identical denaturation conditions (Fig. 4, Ref. 7Hasegawa J. Shimahara H. Mizutani M. Uchiyama S. Arai H. Ishii M. Kobayashi Y. Ferguson S.J. Sambongi Y. Igarashi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37533-37537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The difference in ΔGW values between the wild-type PA c551 and F34Y/E43Y variant was 13.4 kJ mol–1 (7Hasegawa J. Shimahara H. Mizutani M. Uchiyama S. Arai H. Ishii M. Kobayashi Y. Ferguson S.J. Sambongi Y. Igarashi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37533-37537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), i.e. close to the absolute value for ΔΔGW of the HT c552 Y34F/Y43E variant. This same contribution to the whole ΔΔGW value (ΔGW difference between the values for two wild-type proteins) indicates that the effects of side chain interactions related to Tyr-34 and Tyr-43 are equal in the wild-type HT c552 and PA c551 F34Y/E43Y variant. Previous three-dimensional structure analysis of the wild-type HT c552 and PA c551 reverse quintuple variant showed that Tyr-34 and Tyr-43 contributes to the hydrophobic interaction and the formation of a hydrogen bond with one of the heme propionate side chains (6Hasegawa J. Yoshida T. Yamazaki T. Sambongi Y. Yu Y. Igarashi Y. Kodama T. Yamazaki K. Kyogoku Y. Kobayashi Y. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9641-9649Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 8Hasegawa J.

The present results indicate that the side chain interactions involving the two Tyr residues in the wild-type HT c552 and PA c551 F34Y/E43Y variant similarly contribute to the overall stability. In contrast, the effect of A7F/M13V mutations on the overall stability of HT c552 (ΔΔGW = –3.3 kJ mol–1, Table I) was less than that of the corresponding reverse F7A/V13M mutations on the PA c551 stability (ΔΔGW = 10.3 kJ mol–1, calculated from Ref. 7Hasegawa J. Shimahara H. Mizutani M. Uchiyama S. Arai H. Ishii M. Kobayashi Y. Ferguson S.J. Sambongi Y. Igarashi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37533-37537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4). Three-dimensional structure analysis has indicated that Ala-7 and Met-13 in the wild-type HT c552 probably together cause tighter packing than that of the corresponding region of the wild-type PA c551 with Phe and Val residues (6Hasegawa J. Yoshida T. Yamazaki T. Sambongi Y. Yu Y. Igarashi Y. Kodama T. Yamazaki K. Kyogoku Y. Kobayashi Y. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9641-9649Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Other structure analysis showed that the PA c551 variant with the F7A/V13M mutations also caused tight packing, as found for the wild-type HT c552 (8Hasegawa J. Uchiyama S. Tanimoto Y. Mizutani M. Kobayashi Y. Sambongi Y. Igarashi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37824-37828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The same mutations in PA c551 change the Ile-18 side chain conformation to the thermodynamically favorable gauche plus form from the wild-type gauche minus form (as judged on χ1 dihedral angle analysis), which further results in tight packing in the same region of the PA c551 variant. From the results of these structure analyses, we have predicted that the region consisting of Ala-7 and Met-13 in the wild-type HT c552 and the PA c551 variant with the F7A/V13M mutations contributes to the high stability. The present less effective destabilization of the HT c552 protein caused by the A7F/M13V mutations indicates that, in contrast to in the case of the wild-type PA c551, the side chains of the introduced Phe-7 and Val-13 still cause tight packing to some extent. In addition, the residue corresponding to PA c551 Ile-18 is Leu in HT c552, whose side-chain conformation is presumably fixed as gauche plus form in both the wild-type and A7F/M13V variant because of steric hindrance between the isopropyl group and main-chain atoms. Thus, the effect of Leu-18 in HT c552 may not drastically differ regardless of the mutations at positions 7 and 13, as is the case for Ile-18 in PA c551. Therefore, the effects of the A7F/M13V mutations in HT c552 are less than those of the reverse mutations in PA c551. Although we could not evaluate the effects of the I78V mutation in HT c552 and its PA c551 reverse mutation (V78I) precisely because of their smaller effects compared with the experimental error, the order of destabilization by the three HT c552 mutation(s) was the same as that of the stabilizing effects of reverse mutation(s) in PA c551, as judged from the differences in ΔGW values between the wild-type and variants (Fig. 4). In addition, the order of the ΔCm values observed for HT c552 variants was the same as that for the increase in Cm reported for the reverse PA c551 variants (Table I, Ref. 7Hasegawa J. Shimahara H. Mizutani M. Uchiyama S. Arai H. Ishii M. Kobayashi Y. Ferguson S.J. Sambongi Y. Igarashi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37533-37537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In short, the more destabilizing mutation(s) in the three regions of HT c552 is the more effective mutation(s) in PA c551 when it is introduced in reverse. Thermal Stability of HT c552—We next measured the thermal stabilities of the wild-type HT c552 and its variants and then compared them with their stabilities against GdnHCl denaturation. HT c552 was so stable that we were not able to evaluate its thermodynamic property as to the pure effect of temperature using CD spectra (5Sanbongi Y. Igarashi Y. Kodama T. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 9574-9578Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 8Hasegawa J. Uchiyama S. Tanimoto Y. Mizutani M. Kobayashi Y. Sambongi Y. Igarashi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37824-37828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Recently, however, we have newly developed a pressure-proof cell compartment that is attached to a CD spectrometer (17Uchiyama S. Ohshima A. Nakamura S. Hasegawa J. Terui N. Takayama S.J. Yamamoto Y. Sambongi Y. Kobayashi Y. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 14684-14685Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The compartment can tolerate 10 atm, at which the boiling temperature of water is around 180 °C. Using this device, we could obtain complete thermal denaturation profiles for the highly stable HT c552 in both the oxidized and reduced states (17Uchiyama S. Ohshima A. Nakamura S. Hasegawa J. Terui N. Takayama S.J. Yamamoto Y. Sambongi Y. Kobayashi Y. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 14684-14685Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This new system was used for thermal denaturation experiments on the oxidized forms of the wild-type HT c552 and its variants. CD spectra (200–250 nm) of the proteins were measured from 40 to 150 °C at pH 5.0. The shapes of the spectra of all the proteins at the lower temperature did not differ significantly (see Fig. 1B, for an example). However, the CD ellipticities of the quintuple variant and the others began to change over 85 and 95 °C, respectively, as previously reported. The CD ellipticities at 222 nm were plotted against temperature, yielding thermal denaturation profiles of these proteins (Fig. 5). All the profiles exhibited complete single cooperation, indicating that the protein unfolding proceeded with a two-state transition. From these CD measurements we obtained thermodynamic parameters for the thermal denaturation of HT c552 and its variants (Table I). The melting temperatures (Tm) of the wild-type, A7F/M13V, Y34F/Y43E, I78V, and the quintuple variants were 121.1, 117.0, 108.3, 117.8, and 95.2 °C, respectively. Differences in free energy changes between the proteins and the quintuple variant at the Tm of the quintuple variant (ΔΔGm) were calculated to quantify the stability against thermal denaturation. The resulting thermodynamic parameters showed that the quintuple mutation most decreased the overall stability followed by Y34F/Y43, A7F/M13V, and I78V (ΔΔGm 9.8, 16.4, and 17.9 kJ mol–1, respectively, compared with the quintuple variant). Similarity and Difference in Stability against GdnHCl and Thermal Denaturation—Similar to the results of GdnHCl denaturation experiments, those as to the thermal denaturation showed that five residues, Ala-7, Met-13, Tyr-34, Tyr-43, and Ile-78, were responsible for the higher stability of HT c552. In addition, the order of protein stability against GdnHCl denaturation (quintuple variant < Y34F/Y43E < A7F/M13V < I78V < wild type) was the same as that observed for thermal denaturation, as judged on the basis of the ΔΔGm and Tm values (Table I). On the other hand, there is a difference in the effects of the two denaturation factors on the stability of the c552 quintuple variant. The variant showed almost the same stability as that of the wild-type PA c551 against GdnHCl denaturation, whereas the variant exhibited significantly higher stability than the PA c551 wild type against thermal denaturation, as manifested in the ΔΔGm and Tm values (Table I). Taken together, the present results indicated that the five mutations in HT c552, leading to enhanced stability against GdnHCl denaturation, qualitatively resulted in elevated stability against temperature and vice versa. However, the reciprocal effect of the five mutations on the overall protein stability against thermal denaturation was not observed quantitatively. Further biophysical analysis of the HT c552 variants examined here and also the PA c551 reverse variants would help to explain the discrepancy between the two denaturation factors. Other Mutations That Did Not Cause Destabilization of HT c552—Do the five residues, Ala-7, Met-13, Tyr-34, Tyr-43, and Ile-78, exclusively determine the HT c552 stability? To address this question, we have already examined the effects of a few other mutations on HT c552 thermal stability in the presence of 1.5 m GdnHCl (19.Sambongi, Y. (1991) Study on Thermal Stability of Cytochromes c. Ph.D. thesis, University of TokyoGoogle Scholar). GdnHCl should be added to obtain complete thermal-unfolding profiles of proteins below 100 °C on ordinary CD measurement. Using our former expression system in which the HT c552 protein is produced in the E. coli cytoplasm (10Sanbongi Y. Yang J.-H. Igarashi Y. Kodama T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 198: 7-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), we could transfer Lys, Ala, and Gly residues found in PA c551 to the corresponding positions of HT c552 (Ala-28, Lys-32, and Asp-39, respectively). Although all the proteins possessed a Met residue at the N terminus because the initial residue could not be cleaved off in the E. coli cytoplasm, we were able to evaluate the effects of mutations by comparison with the similarly expressed wild type. Three HT c552 variants with single mutations A28K, K32A, and D39G, and a double one, A28K/K32A, exhibited exactly the same stability as that of the wild type (12Zhang Y. Arai H. Sambongi Y. Igarashi Y. Kodama T. J. Ferment. Bioeng. 1998; 85: 346-349Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 19.Sambongi, Y. (1991) Study on Thermal Stability of Cytochromes c. Ph.D. thesis, University of TokyoGoogle Scholar). On the contrary, PA c551 variants carrying the A32K and G39D mutations exhibited the same stability as that of the wild-type protein, and the K28A mutation caused destabilization (19.Sambongi, Y. (1991) Study on Thermal Stability of Cytochromes c. Ph.D. thesis, University of TokyoGoogle Scholar). Therefore, there is no reciprocal effect at positions 28, 32, and 39, which are located in α-helical regions and are exposed to the external solvent in both HT c552 and PA c551 (6Hasegawa J. Yoshida T. Yamazaki T. Sambongi Y. Yu Y. Igarashi Y. Kodama T. Yamazaki K. Kyogoku Y. Kobayashi Y. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9641-9649Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). These observations in part substantiate the present finding that the five specific residues (Ala-7, Met-13, Tyr-34, Tyr-43, and Ile-78) are among the limited and reciprocal determinants of the high stability of HT c552. Conclusion—In this study, we have established a HT c552 expression system involving E. coli as a host, with which we could produce 25 mg of HT c552 protein L (culture)–1 in the periplasm. The expressed wild-type HT c552 exhibited the same physicochemical properties as those of the authentic one. This progress has facilitated mutagenesis study on HT c552 as to whether or not the specific amino acid residues reflect improvement in overall protein stability. The present reciprocal mutation experiments involving HT c552 and PA c551 provided a unique opportunity to elucidate the protein stability in terms of the protein structure. We have shown previously that the five residues in HT c552 predicted to contribute to the overall protein stability were effective in enhancing the stability of PA c551 (7Hasegawa J. Shimahara H. Mizutani M. Uchiyama S. Arai H. Ishii M. Kobayashi Y. Ferguson S.J. Sambongi Y. Igarashi Y. J. Biol.

Protein Eng. 2002; 15: 455-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The present study demonstrated that the reverse mutations of the selected five residues in HT c552 effectively destabilized the protein structure to the extent expected from the effects of the corresponding PA c551 mutations on the overall protein stability. In conjunction with the three-dimensional structure comparison, the effect of specific amino acid side chain interactions on the overall protein stability could be evaluated in both directions (stabilizing and destabilizing). Perspectives—Finally, we should mention some limitations of the reciprocal mutation method, which will be useful for the development of general strategies for increasing protein stability through protein engineering. (i) A set of homologous proteins of interest should be small enough, each consisting of a single domain. Such proteins may have almost the same backbone conformation. (ii) Next, we should compare structural features to find interactions, such as side-chain packing, an ion pair, or a hydrogen bond, possibly responsible for the overall protein stability in a thermophilic protein. (iii) Reciprocal mutations should independently affect the overall protein stability. With the mutations, the backbone conformation should not change drastically so as not to affect other side chain interactions in remote regions. The present results and another example of reciprocal mutation (20Perl D. Mu ̈ller U. Heinemann U. Schmid F.X. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 380-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar) more or less satisfy these criteria for methodological limitation. We can artificially control protein stability through the selection of amino acid residues contributing to the reciprocal stability. However, there is still a necessity to understand the general principle of protein stabilization, to study a strategy employed in an individual protein. Further accumulation of examples of reciprocal residue swapping between homologous native proteins together with artificially designed proteins (21Kuroda Y. Kim P.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 298: 493-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 22Ishida M. Dohmae N. Shiro Y. Oku T. Iizuka T. Isogai Y.

https://openalex.org/W2111929876,"Signal peptidase, which removes signal peptides from preproteins, has a substrate specificity for small uncharged residues at –1 (P1) and small or larger aliphatic residues at the –3 (P3) position. Structures of the catalytic domain with a 5S-penem inhibitor and a lipopeptide inhibitor reveal candidate residues that make up the S1 and S3 pockets that bind the P1 and P3 specificity residues of the preprotein substrate. We have used site-directed mutagenesis, mass spectrometric analysis, and in vivo and in vitro activity assays as well as molecular modeling to examine the importance of the substrate pocket residues. Generally, we find that the S1 and S3 binding sites can tolerate changes that are expected to increase or decrease the size of the pocket without large effects on activity. One residue that contributes to the high fidelity of cleavage of signal peptidase is the Ile-144 residue. Changes of the Ile-144 residue to cysteine result in cleavage at multiple sites, as determined by mass spectrometry and Edman sequencing analysis. In addition, we find that signal peptidase is able to cleave after phenylalanine at the –1 residue in a double mutant in which both Ile-86 and Ile-144 were changed to an alanine. Also, alteration of the Ile-144 and Ile-86 residues to the corresponding residues found in the homologous Imp1 protease changes the specificity to promote cleavage following a –1 Asn residue. This work shows that Ile-144 and Ile-86 contribute to the signal peptidase substrate specificity and that Ile-144 is important for the accuracy of the cleavage reaction."
https://openalex.org/W2155557577,"Exposure to environmental stress, such as radiation, poor nutrition, or smoking, can cause hazardous lesions in DNA, including double-strand breaks. In red blood cells, a DNA fragment or lagging chromosome forms a micronucleus when left behind after the main nucleus is extruded to form the mature reticulocyte during erythropoiesis. Reticulocytes with micronuclei in human peripheral blood are not generally available for analysis because the spleen removes aberrant cells. We have developed a simple and rapid method to isolate and analyze immature reticulocytes in the peripheral blood for the presence of micronuclei before these cells are removed by the spleen. This method applies single-laser flow-cytometry to measure micronuclei in an enriched transferrin-positive reticulocyte population. Abramsson-Zetterberg et al. (Abramsson-Zetterberg, L., Zetterberg, G., Bergqvist, M., and Grawe, J. Environ. Mol. Mutagen. 36, 22-31, 2000) have described a method to measure micronuclei in an enriched reticulocyte population using a dual-laser flow cytometry. Unlike the beads used in their magnetic-immunoseparation procedures, the beads used in this study do not require a prelabeling step and are compatible with the flow cell, sparing the need to release the cells from the beads and avoiding the potentially confounding DNase-treatment step. Dertinger et al. (Dertinger, S. D., Torous, D. K., Hall, N. E., Murante, F. G., Gleason, S. E., Miller, R. K., and Tometsko, C. R. Mutat. Res. 515, 3-14, 2002; Dertinger, S. D., Chen, Y., Miller, R.

Res. 542, 77-87, 2003) further improved the scoring of micronuclei to enable the use of bench-top instruments in analyzing samples of unenriched reticulocyte-populations. The present method is distinct from flow cytometric assays, such as reported by Dertinger et al., which enable scoring of limited numbers of reticulocytes per sample and require lengthy data acquisition times. We assessed DNA damage in smokers using this novel flow-cytometry based micronuclei-assay. The results show that this assay can effectively detect micronuclei in human blood samples. This method, unlike available micronuclei assays, allows rapid evaluation of a large number of cells and therefore should prove to be useful in monitoring of human populations for genetic damage."
https://openalex.org/W1968412976,"TNF-alpha is known to induce a strong up-regulation of Fas expression in mouse Sertoli cell cultures, leading to their apoptosis triggered by effector FasL-bearing cells. These data suggest that increased Fas expression on the cell surface might be a key event in the pathogenesis of autoimmune orchitis, by inducing a leakage of the blood-tubular barrier as a consequence of Sertoli cell apoptosis. In the present paper, we have investigated the signal transduction mechanisms involved in the regulation of Fas expression induced by TNF-alpha in mouse Sertoli cells. We studied the role of the transcription factor NF-kappaB and of MAPKs in regulating Fas expression. By using Sertoli cells transfected with a NF-kappaB Luc reporter gene, we proved that TNF-alpha activates the IkappaB/NF-kappaB system. Moreover, the use of the proteasome inhibitor lactacystin led us to demonstrate that NF-kappaB is required for TNF-alpha mediated Fas expression. By using specific inhibitors for each MAPK, we confirmed the pivotal role of the IkappaB/NF-kappaB system by demonstrating that ERKs, p38, and JNK are not involved in Fas up-regulation by TNF-alpha. The comprehension of these pathways could be relevant to the knowledge of the pathogenesis of autoimmune disorders in immune privileged districts of the body."

Structural and functional studies suggest potential therapeutic value for select CD80 competitive antagonist peptides. The interaction between cell surface costimulatory molecules on antigen-presenting cells and the T cells is critical in modulating cell-cell communication (1van der Merwe P.A. Davis S.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 21: 659-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Two structurally and functionally well characterized T cell surface costimulatory molecules are CD28 and the CTLA4 (cytotoxic Tlymphocyte-associated antigen)/CD152, both of which bind the same ligands, CD80 (B7-1) and CD86 (B7-2), on the antigen-presenting cells. Whereas signaling via CD28 mediates T cell activation, ligation of CD152 down-regulates T cell proliferation and function (2Lenschow D.J. Walunas T.L. Bluestone J.A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 233-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (2327) Google Scholar). Thus, CD80/CD86-CD28/CD152 costimulatory molecules are potential therapeutic targets for modulating T cell responses. Analyses of multiple receptor-ligand interactions suggest that in exposed domains involved in protein-protein interactions that mediate cell signaling, the intermolecular interfaces often present extended shallow clefts on ligand surfaces (3Nooren I.M. Thornton J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 325: 991-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Hence, molecules whose shapes complement the protein interaction clefts of the ligand surfaces are likely to block receptor binding (4Arkin M.R. Wells J.A. Nat. Rev.

Acceptors are typically large proteins with measurable affinity for specific ligands; the latter can be presented as a small peptide sequence within an exposed loop on the surface of a large protein. Structurally, ligands may exist in extended PPII helical conformation, allowing the backbone atoms of the peptide to form hydrogen bonds with protein acceptor at the interface of the protein-peptide complex (8Creamer T.P. Campbell M.N. Adv. Protein Chem. 2002; 62: 263-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 9Koehler K.F. Rao S.N. Snyder J.P. Cohen N.C. Guidebook on Molecular Modeling in Drug Design. 1.

Examples of complexes where the ligand is in PPII conformation include the EFPPPPT peptide, which interacts with the VASP (vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein) EVH1 (Ena/VASP homology) domain (Protein Data Bank code 1QC6), and the SOS (Son of Sevenless) peptide (KHYRPLPPLP) that interacts with Grb2 (growth factor receptor-bound protein 2) Src homology 3 domain (Protein Data Bank code 1CKB) (10Fedorov A.A.

In the CD80-CD152 complex, the CD80 presents a shallow hydrophobic pocket, receptive to the highly conserved solvent-accessible polyproline sequence 99MYPPPY104 localized in the complementarity-determining region (CDR)-3 like loop region of the CD152 (12Stamper C.C.

Interestingly, it is observed that Pro102 restricts the preceding proline in a PPII helical conformation. The PPII helix is located very close to type II β turns and β strand in Ramachandran plot with backbone dihedrals of (ϕ, ψ) = (–75, +145). The geometry of the PPII helix allows the polypeptide chain to progress immediately from this conformation to a β-sheet as observed in CD152 (13Shi Z. Woody R.W. Kallenbach N.R. Adv. Protein Chem. 2002; 62: 163-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). A significant fraction of the unordered residues in many globular proteins have been shown to exist in left-handed PPII conformation (14Adzhubei A.A. Sternberg M.J. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2395-2410Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Although proline is most commonly observed, nonproline residues also form PPII helix driven by steric interactions between backbone and the solvent (15Chellgren B.W. Creamer T.P. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 5864-5869Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Whereas the backbone solvation stabilizes the conformation, the side-chain interactions of the PPII helix in the local environment determine the specificity of the protein-protein interactions (8Creamer T.P. Campbell M.N. Adv. Protein Chem. 2002; 62: 263-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Based on PPII helical mimicry of the ligand binding conformation of the receptor protein at the CD80-CD152 interface, novel peptide agents referred to as CD80 competitive antagonist peptides (CD80-CAPs) were designed. Contact preferences of the amino acids to be at the interface of protein-protein interactions and the propensity of each residue to form PPII helix were integrated in the design of the CD80-CAPs (3Nooren I.M.

The structural overlap for the secondary structure comparison for the CD80 query and the four templates was between 48 and 53%. Docking of mouse CD80-CD80-CAP—Docking of the mouse CD80 and the CD80-CAPs with the former as the target and the later as the probe was performed using Bigger software that utilizes a soft docking algorithm. The docked geometries with maximal surface matching and favorable intermolecular amino acid contacts were evaluated and scored in terms of geometric complementarity of the surfaces, explicit electrostatic interactions, desolvation energy, and pairwise propensities of amino acid side chains to contact across the molecular interface, with a global score that ranks overall the docking results separating potentially nearly native solutions from other incorrect solutions (24Palma P.N. Krippahl L. Wampler J.E. Moura J.J. Proteins. 2000; 39: 372-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). The top 100 docked structures generated were screened by superimposition with the CD80-CD152 complex. Potential docked structures with an r.m.s. deviation of <5 Å were identified, viewed with the SPDB viewer, and subjected to further energy minimization using GRAMMOS to optimize the binding conformation of the amino acids (available on the World Wide Web at us.expasy.org/spdbv/) (25Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9399) Google Scholar). Peptides—All peptides were synthesized on Rink amide resin by solid-phase peptide synthesis using Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl)/dicyclohexylcarbodiimide/hydroxybenzotriazole methodology at the Biochemistry and Biophysiscs facility, Indiana University School of Medicine (Indianapolis, IN), as described (26Srinivasan M. Wardrop R.M. Gienapp I.E. Stuckman S.S. Whitacre C.C. Kaumaya P.T. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The free NH2 group of the terminal amino acid residue was acetylated. A control hexapeptide with little or no PPII helical content was likewise synthesized. The peptides were purified by semipreparative reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography, and the identity of the purified peptide was confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Circular Dichroism—CD measurements were recorded on a JASCO model J-710 spectropolarimeter (Jasco Inc., Easton, MD) as described previously (8Creamer T.P. Campbell M.N. Adv. Protein Chem. 2002; 62: 263-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 26Srinivasan M. Wardrop R.M. Gienapp I.E. Stuckman S.S. Whitacre C.C. Kaumaya P.T. J.

The samples were prepared by dissolving lyophilized CD80-CAP peptides at 100 μm concentration in citrate buffer (1 mm sodium citrate, 1 mm sodium borate, 1 mm sodium phosphate, 15 mm NaCl) with pH adjusted at 7.0. CD spectra were collected using a 1-cm path length quartz cuvette at 5 °C in the 190–270-nm wavelength range with a 0.5-nm resolution and a scan rate of 200 nm/min. Reported spectra represent the unsmoothed averages of 30 scans. Each spectrum was measured three times with individually prepared solutions. Raw CD signals (in millidegrees) were converted to mean residue molar ellipticity (θ)MRW in degrees cm2/dmol using the formula [θ] MRW = [θ]obs/10lcn, where [θ]obs represents the observed ellipticity, l is the path length in centimeters, c is the molar concentration of peptide, and n is the number of residues in the peptide. To determine 0% PPII helical content, CD spectra were recorded with CD80-CAP peptides dissolved in 6 m CaCl2 (28Park S.H. Shalongo W. Stellwagen E. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1694-1700Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). CD28-CD80/CD86 Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay—96-Well flat bottom plates were coated with anti-mouse IgG2a (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) in carbonate buffer (pH 9.4) overnight at 4 °C. All fusion proteins were obtained from Ancell Corp. (Bayport, MN). After blocking with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h, human CD28-Fc at 300 ng/well was added and incubated at room temperature for 2 h and later washed three times in PBS. During this time, human CD80-Fc-biotin (51.3 kDa) or CD86-Fc-biotin (52.3 kDa) at a final concentration of 4 μm was preincubated with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase at 1:1000 in PBS. Mixtures of a constant concentration of biotinylated CD80-Fc with increasing concentrations of specific CD80-CAP agents were added to the CD28-coated wells and incubated for 45 min at 37 °C. After washing five times in PBS, binding was detected by using TNB substrate (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA). The reaction was stopped by adding 25 μl of 2 m H2SO4. Absorbance at 405 nm was read in a microplate reader (model 680; Bio-Rad). For competitive experiments, absorbance was read at 605 nm over a period of time between 0 to 300 s with a mix time of 0.30 s and an interval of 5 s between readings prior to stopping. CD152-CD80/CD86–Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay experiments were performed similarly by adding mixtures of human CD80-Fc biotin/CD86-Fc biotin at a constant concentration of 0.4 μm and varying concentrations of CD80-CAP agents to the wells coated indirectly with 300 ng of human CD152-Fc. Data Analysis—The kinetic velocity, which represents the slope of absorbance versus time curve calculated by linear regression, maximum velocity, or the highest velocity from overlapping segments of data points in the reaction and the change in absorbance with time was recorded and analyzed using microplate manager software 5.2 (Bio-Rad). Animals and Induction of Collagen-induced Arthritis (CIA)—6–8-Week-old DBA/1 Lac J mice were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) and housed in a specific pathogen-free facility in the animal care facility at the Indiana University School of Dentistry bioresearch facility following approval of the animal care and use committee. For induction of CIA, the mice were immunized subcutaneously at the base of the tail with 100 μg of bovine collagen type II (bCII) in 0.05 m acetic acid emulsified 1:1 with complete Freund's adjuvant (4 mg/ml) (29Brand D.D. Myers L.K. Whittington K.B. Latham K.A. Stuart J.M. Kang A.H. Rosloniec E.F. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 490-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). T Cell Proliferation Assays—The in vitro proliferation assays were done as described (26Srinivasan M. Wardrop R.M. Gienapp I.E. Stuckman S.S. Whitacre C.C. Kaumaya P.T. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Draining lymph nodes were removed from animals at 10 days after bCII/CFA immunization, disassociated, and washed in RPMI 1640. Lymph node cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal calf serum, 25 mm HEPES, 2 mm l-glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 mg/ml streptomycin, and 5× 10–5m 2-mercaptoethanol in round-bottom 96-well plates with bCII (20 μg/ml) for 72 h, including a final 16-h pulse with [3H]thymidine. Cultures contained CD80-CAP and control peptides in triplicate wells at concentrations ranging from 500 to 62.5 μm. Cultures were harvested onto glass fiber mats using a Skatron harvester (Skatron, Sterling, VA), and the levels of [3H]thymidine incorporation were determined by liquid scintillation counting (Microbeta; Wallac, Turku, Finland). Results were confirmed by replicate experiments, and all data are expressed as Δ cpm (counts/min incorporated in antigen-stimulated culture–counts/min incorporated by control unstimulated culture) (26Srinivasan M. Wardrop R.M. Gienapp I.E. Stuckman S.S. Whitacre C.C. Kaumaya P.T. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). C80-CAP Treatment in CIA—DBA/1 Lac J mice were induced CIA as described above. The CD80-CAP1 and the control peptides were dissolved in sterile PBS at a concentration of 5 mg/ml. For treatment in CIA, groups of bCII-immunized mice were administered intravenously in the tail vein 100 μl of sterile PBS or 500 μg of CD80-CAP1/control peptide. Mice were observed for clinical disease beginning 3 weeks after immunization and scored on alternate days as described (29Brand D.D. Myers L.K. Whittington K.B. Latham K.A. Stuart J.M. Kang A.H. Rosloniec E.F. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 490-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The severity of arthritis was recorded using an established macroscopic joint scoring system ranging from 0 to 4 as follows: 0, normal; 1, mild swelling with erythema; 2, significant joint swelling; 3, severe swelling and digit deformity; and 4, maximal swelling with ankylosis. Each joint was scored with a maximum possible score of 16 per mouse. Statistical Analysis—For clinical score and in vitro proliferation analyses, a one-way analysis of variance with Tukey's post hoc test was performed to determine the differences between groups. Design and Structure of CD80-CAP—The interface between both CD152/CD80 and CD152/CD86 is large, burying a total of 1255 and 1290 Å of the solvent-accessible surfaces of CD80 and CD86, respectively (12Stamper C.C. Zhang Y. Tobin J.F. Erbe D.V. Ikemizu S. Davis S.J. Stahl M.L. Seehra J. Somers W.S. Mosyak L. Nature. 2001; 410: 608-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 21Schwartz J.C. Zhang X. Fedorov A.A. Nathenson S.G. Almo S.C. Nature. 2001; 410: 604-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). The proline-rich region of the CD152 CDR-3-like loop packs against the hydrophobic patch of residues that form a shallow cavity on the front face of CD80 and CD86 (30Bajorath J. Metzler W.J. Linsley P.S. J. Mol. Graph Model. 1997; 15 (108–111): 135-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Similar proline rich regions commonly occur in globular domains involved in transient protein-protein interactions (31Kay B.K. Williamson M.P. Sudol M. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 231-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar). Typically, proline-rich regions preferentially adopt a PPII helical conformation (32Williamson M.P. Biochem. J. 1994; 297: 249-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar). Most PPII helices in globular domains vary in length from 4 to 6 residues (14Adzhubei A.A. Sternberg M.J. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2395-2410Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 33Stapley B.J. Creamer T.P. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 587-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Significantly, in the complex with CD80, the Pro101 of CD152 is in PPII helical conformation with the dihedral angles of ϕ and ψ measuring –75 and 164, respectively (Table I). A competitive antagonist for this receptor ligand interaction should not only be small as to occupy the shallow binding site of CD80 (surface area of 655 Å), but it should also mimic the PPII helical conformation of the physiological receptor (12Stamper C.C. Zhang Y. Tobin J.F. Erbe D.V. Ikemizu S. Davis S.J. Stahl M.L. Seehra J. Somers W.S. Mosyak L. Nature. 2001; 410: 608-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Amino acids exhibit varied frequencies of occurrence at the protein interface and distinct pairing preferences at sites of protein-protein interactions (16Bahadur R.P. Chakrabarti P. Rodier F. Janin J. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 336: 943-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 34Glaser F. Steinberg D.M. Vakser I.A. Ben-Tal N. Proteins. 2001; 43: 89-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). In addition, residues vary in the propensity to form PPII helix (15Chellgren B.W. Creamer T.P. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 5864-5869Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). A polypeptide backbone possesses both α helix and PPII helix propensity. The extent to which the PPII helix is adopted is determined by the degree of backbone solvation and modulated by side chain interactions (8Creamer T.P. Campbell M.N. Adv. Protein Chem. 2002; 62: 263-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 13Shi Z. Woody R.W. Kallenbach N.R. Adv. Protein Chem. 2002; 62: 163-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Studies of the synthetic peptide made up of MYPPPY sequence do not exhibit PPII helical conformation and had no inhibitory potential in cellular assays (35Srinivasan M. Gienapp I.E. Stuckman S.S. Rogers C.J. Jewell S.D. Kaumaya P.T. Whitacre C.C. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 2180-2188Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This may be attributed to the lower potential of aromatic amino acids to propagate PPII helix (36Kelly M.A. Chellgren B.W. Rucker A.L. Troutman J.M. Fried M.G. Miller A.F. Creamer T.P. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14376-14383Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Integrating the residue preferences and propensities, novel CD80-CAP hexapeptides were designed so as to possess significant PPII helical content in the context of the CD80 binding interface.Table IDihedral angles of the conserved hydrophobic motif MYPPPYAMouse CD152Human CD152CD80-CD152CD86-CD152ϕψϕψϕψϕψMet-81.4-23.8-78.4-38.3-78.02-39.6-67.7-153.7Tyr-163.7145.2-67.5-45-161142.5-43.6141.7Pro-84.0167.0-80.8137.2-76164.6-83.8165.07Pro-61.9154.7-90143.9-69.5170-60.4155.9Pro-85.3157.1-114.464.7-69.7161-86.37164.7Tyr-65.7139.748.1111.9-86.8135.3-67.37-168.7 Open table in a new tab Substituting the CD80-CAP residues for the hydrophobic motif in the mouse CD152, comparative modeling of the modified CD152 was performed using the mouse CD152 (Protein Data Bank code 1DQT) as template (19Ostrov D.A. Shi W. Schwartz J.C. Almo S.C. Nathenson S.G. Science. 2000; 290: 816-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 20Metzler W.J. Bajorath J. Fenderson W. Shaw S.Y. Constantine K.L. Naemura J. Leytze G. Peach R.J. Lavoie T.B. Mueller L. Linsley P.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 527-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). This gives a structural representation of the CD80-CAP with reference to the adjacent residues of CD152. Since PPII helix formation has been shown to be a locally driven event with little/no involvement of long range interactions, it is logical to presume that synthetic CD80-CAP with blocked charges will adopt a similar conformation as in the predicted model (37Creamer T.P. Proteins. 1998; 33: 218-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Each CD80-CAP was superimposed with the ligand binding motif of free murine CD152 (Protein Data Bank code 1DQT) (19Ostrov D.A. Shi W. Schwartz J.C. Almo S.C. Nathenson S.G. Science. 2000; 290: 816-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), free human CD152 (Protein Data Bank code 1AH1) (20Metzler W.J. Bajorath J.

Nature. 2001; 410: 604-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) bound CD152. Superimposition of the CD80-CAP1 (MQPPGC) with the free mouse and human CD152 and CD80- and CD86-bound CD152 yielded r.m.s. deviation values of 0.03, 0.79, 0.31, and 4.40 Å, respectively (Fig. 1). These values suggest that the CD80-CAP1 is a close mimic of the ligand binding regions of the mouse CD152 and the CD80-bound human CD152 structures. Similar superimposition of CD80-CAP3 (MAVPAT) over free mouse CD152 and free human CD152 yielded an r.m.s. deviation value of 1.47 and 1.19 Å, respectively. All CD80-CAPs that were within 5-Å r.m.s. deviation when superimposed over free murine or human CD152 and <1-Å r.m.s. deviation when superimposed over CD80-bound CD152 were selected for in silico docking. Docking of CD80-CAP: CD80 ECD—Superimposition of the mouse CD80 molecular model with the unbound CD80 (Protein Data Bank code 1DR9) (22Ikemizu S. Gilbert R.J. Fennelly J.A. Collins A.V. Harlos K.

Erbe D.V. Ikemizu S. Davis S.J. Stahl M.L. Seehra J. Somers W.S. Mosyak L. Nature. 2001; 410: 608-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar) yielded an r.m.s. deviation of 6.13 and 1.87 Å, respectively (data not shown). The difference in the r.m.s. deviation values may be attributed to the structural differences between the monomer (Protein Data Bank code 1DR9) and homodimer (Protein Data Bank code 118L) of CD80. The recently developed docking program “BIGGER” was used to generate and evaluate plausible binding modes between the predicted mouse CD80 ECD and the CD80-CAP (24Palma P.N. Krippahl L. Wampler J.E. Moura J.J. Proteins. 2000; 39: 372-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). The coordinates of each CD80-CAP were systematically rotated (in discrete steps of 15) and translated against the surface of CD80. The top 100 docked structures of each complex generated were screened by superimposition with the human CD80-CD152 complex (Protein Data Bank code 118L). Potential CD80-CAP-CD80-docked structures with r.m.s. deviation of <5 Å were then subjected to energy minimization to optimize the binding conformation of the amino acids by Grammos. Fig. 2 shows the energy-minimized CD80-CAP1 occupying the binding cleft of CD80. The conserved CD80 residues critical for binding (Tyr28, Val89, and Leu93) are within 5 Å of the CD80-CAP1, suggesting near native docking (12Stamper C.C. Zhang Y. Tobin J.F. Erbe D.V. Ikemizu S. Davis S.J. Stahl M.L. Seehra J. Somers W.S. Mosyak L. Nature. 2001; 410: 608-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Incorporation of glutamine increased both the PPII helical propensity and the potential for interaction with the interface residues (Val79 and Gln81) at the binding pocket of CD80. The docked interface also suggests covalent interactions between methionine and cysteine of the CD80-CAP1 with the conserved Tyr28 and Gln33, respectively, in the binding pocket of CD80.

It has been recently suggested that collagen itself is not able to elicit platelet shape change in the absence of ADP and thromboxane A2 costimulation but is capable of inducing MLCK activation. Since we hypothesize that the morphological changes of the few platelets that adhere to collagen might not be revealed by turbidimetry, the aim of this study was to assess platelet shape change using transmission electron microscopy, in the absence of the amplificatory feedback pathways of ADP and thromboxane A2. Our results demonstrated that only the platelets in contact with insoluble collagen fibers underwent a typical shape change, whereas those further away remained quiescent. Moreover, since cAMP enhances Ca2+ mobilization in response to collagen, in the present study, we also investigated whether cAMP is involved in the inhibition of collagen-induced platelet shape change and MLC phosphorylation. Platelets were thus treated with iloprost (28 nm) prior to stimulation. Electron microscopy studies demonstrated that iloprost did not modify collagen-induced shape change, whereas immunoblotting studies showed a slight inhibition of MLC phosphorylation in the presence of enhanced cAMP levels. We can thus conclude that collagen is able to cause platelet shape change through activation of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent MLCK, without the involvement of amplificatory pathways. Enhanced cytosolic cAMP levels do not inhibit collagen-induced platelet shape change but exert a weak inhibitory action on MLCK.

Enhanced cytosolic cAMP levels do not inhibit collagen-induced platelet shape change but exert a weak inhibitory action on MLCK. Collagen appears to be the most thrombogenic constituent of the vascular subendothelium since it not only causes platelet adhesion but is also a powerful agonist capable of eliciting full platelet activation and aggregation. Because of the abundance of collagen fibers in the extracellular matrix, platelet collagen receptors can be considered as potential risk factors for thrombosis (1Kunicki T.J. Ruggeri Z.M. Circulation. 2001; 104: 1451-1453Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Platelets interact with collagen through two major receptors, namely integrin α2β1 and glycoprotein VI (GPVI). 1The abbreviations used are: GPVI, glycoprotein VI; MLC, myosin light chain; MLCK, myosin light chain kinase; CPZ, chlorpromazine, PKA, cAMP-dependent protein kinase; TxA2, kinase thromboxane A2; PKI, inhibitor; W-7, N-(6-aminohexyl)-5-chloro-1-naphthale-protein nesulfonamide; KT-5720, (8R*,9S*,11S*)-(-)-9-hydroxy-9-n-hexyloxy-8-methyl-2,3,9,10-tetrahydro-8,11-epoxy-1H,8H,11H-2,7b, 11a-triazadibenzo(a,g)-cycloocta(c,d,e)trinden-1-one. The α2β1 receptor plays a primary role in supporting platelet adhesion to collagen, whereas GPVI is deeply involved in generating intracellular signaling. Indeed, GPVI activation stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of many of the proteins in the GPVI-FcR γ-chain cascade, including Syk and phospholipase C γ2. Activation of phospholipase C γ2 results in the generation of inositol trisphosphate and elevation of intracellular Ca2+ (2Daniel J.L. Dangelmaier C. Smith J.B. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 617-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 3Blake R.A. Schieven G.L. Watson S.P. FEBS Lett. 1994; 353: 212-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 4Keely P.J. Parise L.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26668-26676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). This biochemical cascade leads to the following sequence of responses: change from the discoid to the spheroid shape (shape change), secretion of the granule content, and aggregation. Shape change is thus the earliest response to a stimulus; it requires the reorganization of the cytoskeletal structure including formation of new actin filaments, disappearance of the marginal band of microtubules, and centralization of granules (5Siess W. Physiol. Rev. 1989; 69: 58-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar, 6Fox J.E. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1993; 344: 175-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), morphological events that precede pseudopodia extrusion. Agonist-induced shape change requires the elevation of cytosolic Ca2+ levels that regulates multiple Ca2+-dependent enzymes such as Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent myosin light chain (MLC) kinase (7Daniel J.L. Molish I.R. Rigmaiden M. Stewart G. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 9826-9831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which, by phosphorylating MLC, is closely involved in the mechanism of platelet shape change. However, the capability of collagen itself to elicit platelet shape change is still a matter of debate. Recently, Jarvis et al. (8Jarvis G. Atkinson B.T. Snell D.C. Watson S.P. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2002; 137: 107-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), starting from the distinction of two responses induced by collagen, one primary and one secondary to ADP and TxA2 release (9Smith J.B. Dangelmaier C. Selak M.A. Ashby B. Daniel J.L. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 889-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), demonstrated that collagen itself was unable to induce shape change since this response was prevented by the simultaneous blockade of ADP receptors P2Y1 and P2Y12 and the concomitant inhibition of the cyclooxygenase-dependent pathway. Furthermore, Mangin et al. (10Mangin P. Ohlmann P. Eckly A. Cazenave J.-P. Lanza F. Gachet C. J. Thromb. Haemost. 2004; 2: 969-977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), using scanning electron microscopy, showed the absence of extruded filopodia in a suspension of platelets treated with the selective P2Y1 inhibitor MRS-2179 and aspirin. These data seem to be in disagreement with those of Smith et al. (9Smith J.B. Dangelmaier C. Selak M.A. Ashby B. Daniel J.L. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 889-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), who, even in the presence of feedback inhibitors, observed an increase in the phosphorylation of MLC, the preferential pathway leading to platelet shape change following collagen stimulation. Since the morphological changes of the few platelets that adhere to collagen might not be revealed by turbidimetry and since granule centralization cannot be observed by scanning electron microscopy, the aim of this study was to use transmission electron microscopy to assess the earliest phases of platelet shape change under experimental conditions that inhibit the positive, amplificatory feedback pathways of ADP and TxA2. cAMP is thought to affect nearly all aspects of platelet activation, including shape change (11Klages B. Brandt U. Simon M.I. Schultz G. Offermanns S. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 745-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 12Wilde J.I. Retzer M. Siess W. Watson S.P. Platelets (Abingdon). 2000; 11: 286-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Indeed, it has been demonstrated that cAMP inhibits platelet shape change and MLC phosphorylation following U46619 or convulxin stimulation, mainly acting on the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent pathway (11Klages B. Brandt U. Simon M.I. Schultz G. Offermanns S. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 745-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 13Riondino S. Gazzaniga P.P. Pulcinelli F.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 5878-5884Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). However, whether this inhibitory action is dependent upon the reduction of Ca2+ mobilization (14Feinstein M.B. Egan J.J. Sha'afi R.I. White J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 113: 598-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 15Yamanishi J. Kawahara Y. Fukuzaki H. Thromb. Res. 1983; 32: 183-188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) or on a PKA-dependent decrease in myosin kinase activity (16Conti M.A. Adelstein R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 3178-3181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) has never been elucidated in platelets. Collagen appears to be the ideal tool to address this unanswered question since it has been demonstrated that, contrary to that seen with all known platelet agonists, increased levels of cAMP enhance collagen-induced Ca2+ mobilization (9Smith J.B. Dangelmaier C. Selak M.A. Ashby B. Daniel J.L. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 889-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 17Smith J.B. Dangelmaier C. Daniel J.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 191: 695-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Therefore, in the present study, we sought to investigate how cAMP influences the collagen-generated intracellular signaling that, through Ca2+-calmodulin interaction and subsequent MLC phosphorylation, leads to platelet shape change. Platelet Preparation—Blood samples from informed healthy volunteers, who denied having taken any drug in the 2 weeks before blood sampling, were collected in citric acid/citrate/dextrose (18Aster R.H. Jandel J.H. J. Clin. Investig. 1964; 43: 834-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar)-containing tubes. Informed consent was obtained from all subjects participating in the study. Platelet-rich plasma was obtained after centrifugation (180 × g for 15 min) and further centrifuged (800 × g for 20 min) to concentrate the platelets (6 × 108 cells/ml). The concentrated platelets were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C with 1 mm aspirin (Sigma) and, for Ca2+-mobilization studies, Fura-2 AM (3 μm at 37 °C for 30 min plus at room temperature for 15 min) and then washed twice in Tyrode's buffer (137 mm NaCl, 2.68 mm KCl, 0.42 mm NaH2PO4, 1.7 mm MgCl2) containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 6.5) and resuspended in Tyrode's buffer (pH 7.35) containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin, fraction V (BSA-V) and 0.1% glucose (all from Sigma). All platelet preparations were further treated with the P2Y12 ADP receptor antagonist AR-C66096 (100 nm for 1 min; generous gift of AstraZeneca, B. Humphries, Charnwood, Loughborough, UK) and with the P2Y1 ADP receptor antagonist MRS-2179 (100 μm, Sigma) before the addition of the agonists. To enhance cAMP levels, platelets were treated with iloprost (28 nm for 3 min at 37 °C; generous gift of Italfarmaco S.p.a., Milan, Italy). N-(6-Aminohexyl)-5-chloro-1-naphthalenesulfonamide (W-7, 60 μm) and a naphthalenesulfonamide derivative, chlorpromazine (CPZ, 60 μm), both from Sigma, were used to inhibit Ca2+/calmodulin pathway (19Levin R.M. Weiss B. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1979; 208: 454-459PubMed Google Scholar, 20Hidaka H. Asano M. Tanaka T. Mol. Pharmacol. 1981; 20: 571-578PubMed Google Scholar). Cell-permeant (8R*,9S*,11S*)-(-)-9-hydroxy-9-n-hexyloxy-8-methyl-2,3,9,10-tetrahydro-8,11-epoxy-1H,8H,11H-2,7b,11a-triazadibenzo(a,g)-cycloocta(c,d,e-)trinden-1-one (KT-5720, 3 μm for 10 min at 37 °C) and myristoylated PKI peptide-14,22 (5 μm for 10 min at 37 °C), both from Calbiochem, were used as selective cAMP-protein kinase inhibitors (21Kase H. Iwahashi K. Nakanishi S. Matsuda Y. Yamada K. Takahashi M. Murakata C. Sato A. Kaneko M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 142: 436-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar). Platelet stimulation was achieved by means of collagen type I (25 μg/ml; Mascia Brunelli, Italy), with the thromboxane synthetic analogue U46619 (1 μm, Sigma) or with convulxin (5 ng/ml; Latoxan, Rosans, France), purified according to Polgar et al. (22Polgar J. Clemetson J.M. Keherel B.E. Wiedemann M. Magnenat E.M. Wells T.N.C. Clemetson K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13576-13583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Cyclic AMP Extraction and Measurement—Gel-filtered platelets were incubated for 2 min at 37 °C with iloprost (28 nm or 3 μm) and activated with the agonists. The reaction was stopped after 3 min by adding trichloroacetic acid (final concentration 10%). After removal of trichloroacetic acid with water-saturated diethyl ether, cAMP concentration of resuspended dried aqueous layer extract was determined using cAMP enzyme immunoassay system (Amersham Biosciences). Changes in Intracellular Calcium Concentration—The fluorescent changes in intracellular calcium concentration were studied in Fura 2-loaded platelets (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and monitored in a Kontron SFM 25 spectrofluorimeter thermostatically regulated at 37 °C, under continuous stirring. Excitation and emission wavelengths were 340 and 510 nm, respectively. Intracellular free calcium concentration was calibrated according to Grynkiewicz et al. (23Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Data are reported as Δnm and percentages of change in intracellular calcium concentrations (%Δ) induced by agonists. Stimulation was performed with collagen (25 μg/ml), convulxin (5 ng/ml), and U46619 (1 μm) to test cAMP inhibitory effects on our platelet preparation. If the Δnm of Ca2+ obtained in response to U46619 plus iloprost was higher than 10, the platelet preparation was discharged. Platelet Shape Change—In vitro platelet shape change was evaluated in a lumi-aggregometer (Chrono-log Corp. Havertown, PA) using siliconized glass cuvettes at 37 °C under continuous stirring. Once the full function of the platelet preparation was tested in response to collagen (25 μg/ml) and convulxin (5 ng/ml), platelets were treated with RGDS (120 μg/ml) which prevents fibrinogen binding to the integrin αIIbβ3 but allows shape change to occur. The extent of the shape change (magnitude) was measured as a decrease in light transmission. Electron Microscopy—For conventional thin section electron microscopy, platelets were treated as described (24Israels S.J. Gerrard J.M. Watson S.P. Authi K.S. Platelets: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press Inc., NY1996: 279-297Google Scholar). 450-μl aliquots of platelet suspension were fixed in the aggregometer cuvettes with 0.1% glutaraldehyde and kept at 37 °C for 15 min. The platelets were then spun at 15,000 × g for 5 min and fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde for 3 h. After fixation, cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline, postfixed with 1% OsO4 in veronal acetate buffer (pH 7.4) for 1 h at 25 °C, stained with 0.1% tannic acid in the same buffer for 30 min at 25 °C and with uranyl acetate (5 mg/ml) for 1 h at 25 °C, dehydrated in acetone, and embedded in Epon 812. Thin sections were finally stained with uranyl acetate and lead hydroxide and examined with a Philips electron microscope. Myosin Light Chain Phosphorylation—MLC phosphorylation has been analyzed according to Daniel and Sellers (25Daniel J.L. Sellers J.R. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 215: 78-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Briefly, aspirinated platelets were resuspended in Tyrode's buffer at a concentration of 2 × 109 cells/ml. After 30 s from agonist stimulation, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 6.6 n HClO4. The pellets were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 2 min and washed twice; the resulting pellets were dissolved in 50 μl of sample buffer containing 8 m urea, 20 mm Tris, 122 mm glycine, 5 mm dithiothreitol (pH 8.6), to which 0.1% bromphenol blue dye was added. The suspended pellet was sonicated (PBI Briansonic 220) for 30 min. Gel electrophoresis was performed in a 10% polyacrylamide-urea minigel apparatus (Hoefer Scientific Instruments, San Francisco, CA). The running buffer used in the top chamber was composed of 20 mm Tris, 122 mm glycine at pH 8.6 containing 4 mm urea. The electrophoresis was stopped 1 h after the blue marker had come off. Proteins were transferred to Immobilion-P (Millipore) membranes and identified with anti-phospho-MLC monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and detected with ECL chemiluminescence reaction reagent (Amersham Biosciences) and Kodak x-ray film (X-OMAT AR). In some experiments, the membranes, once probed, were stripped of bound antibodies by incubation in buffer containing 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7, for 30 min at 60 °C and then reprobed with an antibody against MLC. Platelet Shape Change—Fig. 1 shows the changes in light transmission recorded after collagen (5 μg/ml) stimulation in the absence of cyclooxygenase and ADP receptor inhibitors and of RGDS (trace a). Once the full function of the platelet preparation was tested in response to collagen, platelets were treated with AR-C66096, MRS-2179, and RGDS. Under these experimental conditions, we were unable to detect any change in light transmission in response to collagen (25 μg/ml), both in the absence (trace b) and in the presence (trace c) of the cAMP-enhancing drug iloprost (28 nm for 3 min at 37 °C). Thus, to verify whether platelet shape change really did not occur in the presence of positive feedback inhibitors when platelets were stimulated by collagen, we analyzed by transmission electron microscopy the morphological changes of a suspension of platelets activated for 20 s with collagen (25 μg/ml). Fig. 2 shows platelet morphology during the resting state (Fig. 2a). Following collagen stimulation, only those platelets that were close to the collagen fibers (arrows) underwent a change in shape, showing signs of cytoskeletal rearrangements, centralization of secretory granules, and pseudopodia formation, whereas all other platelets did not modify their morphology (b–d). When analyzed in iloprost-treated samples, platelet shape change paralleled that observed in untreated samples (Fig. 3, a–c).Fig. 3The effect of iloprost on collagen-induced platelet shape change. Transmission electron microscopy of aspirinated, iloprost-treated (28 nm for 3 min) platelets in which the amplificatory pathways were inhibited as in Fig. 2 and activated for 20 s by 25 μg/ml collagen (c). The morphological changes observed after stimulation parallel those observed in Fig. 2. Iloprost treatment does not alter the morphology observed under resting conditions. (a), b shows a higher magnification. Arrows point to collagen fibers.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The inhibitory effect of cAMP on convulxin-stimulated platelets was assessed in one of our previous studies (13Riondino S. Gazzaniga P.P. Pulcinelli F.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 5878-5884Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and documented by means of turbidimetry. The use of electron microscopy allowed us to verify this inhibition (Fig. 4, a and b). Effects of cAMP on Collagen-induced Changes in Intracellular Calcium Concentration and on Myosin Light Chain Phosphorylation—To investigate the role of the increase of cytosolic cAMP on agonist-induced calcium mobilization, Fura-2-loaded platelets were treated with iloprost (28 nm). Cyclic AMP concentrations were enhanced from 10.3 ± 2.1 pmol/109cells (basal conditions) to 558.3 ± 59.6 pmol/109cells. Higher concentrations of iloprost (3 μm) produced a cAMP concentration of 1164.8 ± 128.6 pmol/109 cells. Neither convulxin nor collagen was able to decrease the cAMP levels elicited by iloprost (28 nm) treatment (489.2 ± 72.1 and 495.6 ± 70.3 pmol/109 cells respectively). Stimulation with U46619 (1 μm), which was employed to test the inhibitory action of cAMP on our platelet preparation, evoked a rise in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration (729.7 ± 28.9 Δ%) that was completely abolished by iloprost treatment. The stimulation with convulxin (5 ng/ml) caused a rise in intracellular Ca2+ mobilization (329.7 ± 28.9 Δ%) that, in agreement with our previous study (13Riondino S. Gazzaniga P.P. Pulcinelli F.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 5878-5884Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), was strongly inhibited by iloprost treatment (46.2 ± 14.5 Δ%, p < 0.02). This inhibition was reduced by increasing convulxin concentration (Fig. 5). Collagen (25 μg/ml) evoked a much lower rise in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration (184.5 ± 46.2 Δ%), which was slightly, although not significantly, enhanced by iloprost treatment (236.2 ± 39.7 Δ%) (Fig. 6A), as also found by Smith et al. (9Smith J.B. Dangelmaier C. Selak M.A. Ashby B. Daniel J.L. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 889-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 17Smith J.B. Dangelmaier C. Daniel J.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 191: 695-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Conversely, the extent of collagen-induced MLC phosphorylation was reduced by the enhanced intracellular levels of cAMP (Fig. 6B).Fig. 6The effect of iloprost on collagen-induced increase in cytosolic Ca2+ and on levels of myosin light chain phosphorylation.A and B, representative (n = 5) traces (A) and percentage of change (Δ%) (B) of Ca2+ mobilization in collagen-stimulated platelets in the absence (a) and in the presence (b) of iloprost (28 nm for 3 min). C, alkalineurea-PAGE of pellets from platelets treated with either vehicle (Me2SO) or iloprost, stimulated with 25 μg/ml collagen. Phospho-MLC (P-MLC, upper panel) and control MLC (lower panel) antibodies were used. These results are representative of three experiments performed.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Effects of Ca2+/Calmodulin Pathway Inhibition on Collagen-induced Changes in Intracellular Calcium Concentration and on Myosin Light Chain Phosphorylation—To verify that collagen-induced platelet MLC phosphorylation follows the Ca2+-dependent pathway, platelets were treated with the Ca2+/calmodulin inhibitors W-7 (60 μm) and CPZ (60 μm), a naphthalenesulfonamide derivative. Our data demonstrated that treatment with W-7 or CPZ dramatically inhibited MLC phosphorylation in response to collagen, supporting a role for the Ca2+/calmodulin pathway in this process (Fig. 7). Effects of PKA Inhibition on Collagen-induced Changes in Intracellular Calcium Concentration and on Myosin Light Chain Phosphorylation—The effects of cAMP-dependent protein kinase inhibition were determined. For this purpose, the PKA active site inhibitors KT-5720 (3 μm) and myristoylated PKI peptide-14,22 (5 μm) were used. Our results demonstrate that the PKA inhibitors did not significantly modify the collagen-induced Ca2+ response when compared with control (Fig. 8A). When the PKA inhibitors were tested on the responses elicited by U46619 and convulxin, iloprost-inhibited Ca2+ mobilization was almost completely reversed by pretreatment with KT-5720 (Fig. 9). This result is in agreement with previous reports demonstrating that it is possible to restore cAMP-inhibited platelet aggregation induced by a thromboxane analogue using a PKA antagonist (26Nishikawa M. Komada F. Morita K. Deguchi K. Shirakawa S. Cell Signal. 1992; 4: 453-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). As expected, the inhibition of collagen-induced MLC phosphorylation achieved with iloprost was reversed by preincubation with the PKA inhibitors (Fig. 8B).Fig. 9Role of PKA in U46619- and convulxin-induced Ca2+ mobilization. Representative (n = 4) traces of Ca2+ mobilization in iloprost-treated (28 nm for 3 min) platelets stimulated with U46619 (1 μm) or convulxin (5 ng/ml) in the absence (b) and in the presence (c) of PKA active-site inhibitor, KT-5720 (3 μm). a represents control, untreated, stimulated platelets.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In the present study, the use of transmission electron microscopy allowed us to shed light on the controversial matter of the capability of collagen to induce platelet shape change without the necessary presence of positive amplificatory pathways represented by released ADP and TxA2. Our results clearly demonstrated that collagen induces morphological changes accompanied by secretory granule centralization of the few adherent platelets, as evidenced by the electron microscopy images, a process that turbidimetry failed to detect. This might explain the results obtained by Jarvis et al. (8Jarvis G. Atkinson B.T. Snell D.C. Watson S.P. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2002; 137: 107-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), who, monitoring platelet shape change in response to collagen by means of an aggregometer, found that this early phenomenon of platelet activation was substantially blocked by preincubation with TxA2 and ADP inhibitors. The reason for these apparently contrasting results might reside in the fact that fibrillar collagen is an insoluble macromolecule, and therefore, only a small number of platelets come into direct contact with it (27Nieswandt B. Brakebusch C. Bergmeier W. Schulte V. Bouvard D. Mokhtari-Nejad R. Lindhout T. Heemskerk J.W. Zirngibl H. Fassler R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2120-2130Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar), whereas in the presence of soluble second mediators released from collagen-activated platelets, a larger number of cells become more promptly activated. Our result is consistent with previous findings (9Smith J.B. Dangelmaier C. Selak M.A. Ashby B. Daniel J.L. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 889-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), indicating 30.0% platelet adhesion to collagen fibrils in the presence of ADP and TxA2 inhibitors. It also provides an explanation for the evidence that convulxin and collagen-related peptide, soluble agonists that activate platelets through the same collagen receptor complex, GPVI/Fc receptor γ-chain, induce a shape change of greater magnitude and slope, even in the presence of inhibitors of cyclooxygenase and antagonists of ADP receptors P2Y1 and P2Y12 (8Jarvis G. Atkinson B.T. Snell D.C. Watson S.P. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2002; 137: 107-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 17Smith J.B. Dangelmaier C. Daniel J.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 191: 695-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 27Nieswandt B. Brakebusch C. Bergmeier W. Schulte V. Bouvard D. Mokhtari-Nejad R. Lindhout T. Heemskerk J.W. Zirngibl H. Fassler R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2120-2130Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar, 29Quinton T.M. Ozdener F. Dangelmaier C. Daniel J.L. Kunapuli S.P. Blood. 2002; 99: 3228-3234Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). These findings were substantiated in the present study by transmission electron microscopy analyses of convulxin-stimulated platelets depicting evident signs of morphological change in a higher number of cells. It is worth noting that granule centralization has to be considered the earliest evidence of platelet shape change, preceding the extrusion of filopodia, and transmission electron microscopy can be considered the ideal tool for its assessment. The demonstration that collagen stimulation phosphorylates MLC further corroborates our results, indicating that collagen induces MLCK activation, a biochemical event that leads to platelet shape change (7Daniel J.L. Molish I.R. Rigmaiden M. Stewart G. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 9826-9831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Collagen-induced shape change is insensitive to cyclic AMP-mediated inhibition. Indeed, we did not observe, by electron microscopy, any modification of iloprost-treated platelet morphology when compared with control. This finding is not surprising since previous studies demonstrated that elevation of cyclic AMP did not inhibit either platelet adhesion to collagen or the associated Ca2+ mobilization (9Smith J.B. Dangelmaier C. Selak M.A. Ashby B. Daniel J.L. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 889-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Accordingly, in our study, we also found that iloprost not only failed to inhibit collagen-induced Ca2+ mobilization but even enhanced it. This particular behavior of the response to collagen is not dependent upon the capability of collagen to lower elevated levels of cAMP (the present study and Ref. 9Smith J.B. Dangelmaier C. Selak M.A. Ashby B. Daniel J.L. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 889-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The fact that collagen-elicited platelet shape change is not subject to cAMP inhibition has been further confirmed by the studies on the phosphorylation of MLC, which involves Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent MLCK (7Daniel J.L. Molish I.R. Rigmaiden M. Stewart G. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 9826-9831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is the preferential pathway leading to platelet shape change following collagen stimulation (9Smith J.B. Dangelmaier C. Selak M.A. Ashby B. Daniel J.L. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 889-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). When analyzing how cAMP influences collagen-mediated MLC phosphorylation, we found the amount of phosphorylated proteins to be only slightly reduced by treatment with iloprost in the presence of inhibitors of cyclooxygenase and antagonists of ADP receptors P2Y1 and P2Y12. The fact that in response to collagen, MLC phosphorylation is reduced, albeit weakly, by high cytosolic levels of cAMP, whereas Ca2+ mobilization is enhanced, requires careful analysis. Indeed, that MLC phosphorylation in response to collagen is strongly related to the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent pathway has been proved by antagonizing the Ca2+-dependent pathway with the Ca2+/calmodulin inhibitors W-7 and chlorpromazine. In fact, collagen-evoked MLC phosphorylation was dramatically inhibited by treatment with inhibitors of the Ca2+/calmodulin interaction. The discrepancy between Ca2+ mobilization and MLC phosphorylation observed in the presence of cAMP-enhancing compounds might thus be explained by considering that PKA phosphorylation directly inhibits MLCK activity and the subsequent MLC phosphorylation, as already demonstrated by others using different cellular approaches (30Atkinson B.T. Stafford M.J. Pears C.J. Watson S.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 5242-5248Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Consistent with this hypothesis, our data show that also in platelets, PKA phosphorylation inhibits MLCK. In fact, treatment with the PKA inhibitors KT-5720 and myristoylated PKI peptide-14,22 before incubation with iloprost, while having no effects on the Ca2+ response to collagen, reversed collagen-induced MLC phosphorylation to pretreatment levels. Taken together, our findings indicate that collagen is able per se to cause platelet shape change through activation of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent MLCK, without the necessary involvement of the amplificatory pathway represented by released ADP and TxA2. Enhanced cytosolic levels of cAMP exert an inhibitory action directly on MLCK, that, however, is too weak to inhibit collagen-induced platelet shape change."

https://openalex.org/W1977926466,"We isolated several related but distinct cDNA clones encoding novel structure proteins (NSP) when screening a cDNA library. Analysis revealed that these cDNAs and several similar ESTs in the public databases are derived from a single gene of 17 exons that span a minimum of 227-kb region. This gene is located at chromosome 17p11.2, a region frequently amplified in human gliomas and osteosarcomas, and involved in Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome, a tumor-prone syndrome. The major coding sequences shared by all isolated transcripts are predicted to encode SMC (structural maintenance of chromosome)/SbcC ATPase motifs and coiled-coil domains commonly seen in motor or structure proteins. Two 5'-end and two 3'-end variants (type 5alpha/beta and 3alpha/beta, respectively) were identified, making a total of four possible transcripts. Both 5alpha and 5beta variants were detected in human testis mRNA, but only type 5alpha was detectable in RNA samples extracted from HeLa cells. The unique carboxyl-terminus of 3beta contains a Ca(2+)-dependent actin-binding domain. Immunohistochemistry studies revealed that NSPs were mostly localized to nuclei. Northern blot analysis demonstrated two major bands and the expression levels are tremendously high in testis while barely detectable in other normal tissues examined. Interestingly, NSP5alpha3alpha is highly expressed in some tumor cell lines. These results suggest that NSPs represent a new family of structure proteins with a possible role in nuclear dynamics during cell division, and that NSP5alpha3alpha may serve as a tumor marker."
