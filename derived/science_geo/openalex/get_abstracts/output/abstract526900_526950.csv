https://openalex.org/W2065204918,"The remarkable performance of hybrid perovskite photovoltaics is attributed to their long carrier lifetimes and high photoluminescence (PL) efficiencies. High-quality films are associated with slower PL decays, and it has been claimed that grain boundaries have a negligible impact on performance. We used confocal fluorescence microscopy correlated with scanning electron microscopy to spatially resolve the PL decay dynamics from films of nonstoichiometric organic-inorganic perovskites, CH3NH3PbI3(Cl). The PL intensities and lifetimes varied between different grains in the same film, even for films that exhibited long bulk lifetimes. The grain boundaries were dimmer and exhibited faster nonradiative decay. Energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy showed a positive correlation between chlorine concentration and regions of brighter PL, whereas PL imaging revealed that chemical treatment with pyridine could activate previously dark grains."

Urban looked at over 130 studies to identify the level of risk that climate change poses to species and the specific traits and characteristics that contribute to risk (see the Perspective by Hille Ris Lambers). If climate changes proceed as expected, one in six species could face extinction. Several regions, including South America, Australia, and New Zealand, face the greatest risk. Understanding these patterns will help us to prepare for, and hopefully prevent, climate-related loss of biodiversity. Science , this issue p. 571 ; see also p. 501"

https://openalex.org/W2078291208,"Werner syndrome (WS) is a premature aging disorder caused by WRN protein deficiency. Here, we report on the generation of a human WS model in human embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Differentiation of WRN-null ESCs to mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) recapitulates features of premature cellular aging, a global loss of H3K9me3, and changes in heterochromatin architecture. We show that WRN associates with heterochromatin proteins SUV39H1 and HP1α and nuclear lamina-heterochromatin anchoring protein LAP2β. Targeted knock-in of catalytically inactive SUV39H1 in wild-type MSCs recapitulates accelerated cellular senescence, resembling WRN-deficient MSCs. Moreover, decrease in WRN and heterochromatin marks are detected in MSCs from older individuals. Our observations uncover a role for WRN in maintaining heterochromatin stability and highlight heterochromatin disorganization as a potential determinant of human aging."

Duplication of centrioles is tightly controlled to ensure that each dividing cell has precisely two centrosomes. Human cancer cells often have extra centrosomes, which has been hypothesized to confer a proliferative advantage. Wong et al. developed small molecules (centrinones) that allowed them to reversibly “delete” centrioles from cells (see the Perspective by Stearns). Surprisingly, cancer cells continued to divide in the absence of centrosomes, whereas normal cells stopped dividing. Science , this issue p. 1155 ; see also p. 1091"

Three helium (He) atoms have been predicted to form a molecular system that manifests this peculiarity under natural conditions without artificial tuning of the attraction between particles by an external field. Here we report experimental observation of this long-predicted but experimentally elusive Efimov state of (4)He3 by means of Coulomb explosion imaging. We show spatial images of an Efimov state, confirming the predicted size and a typical structure where two atoms are close to each other while the third is far away."

ICL mutations are difficult to repair, because the two DNA strands cannot be separated and so one strand cannot be used as a template to repair the other. Räschle et al. developed a mass spectrometry–based method to systematically analyze a time series of all the proteins recruited to repair ICLs in Xenopus egg extracts. They found many of the known factors required for ICL repair. They also found a number of new factors, two of which define a new repair pathway for ICL mutations.

Traditionally, neural crest cells have been considered a derivative of neural ectoderm. Buitrago-Delgado et al. now show that neural crest cells have components of the molecular programs characteristic of blastula cells from earlier in development (see the Perspective by Hoppler and Wheeler). Blastula cells have the broad range of developmental potentials necessary to build the embryo. Neural crest cells may thus reflect persistence of the developmental programs characteristic of early development rather than re-specification of developmental programs after differentiation into neurectoderm.

https://openalex.org/W2058469581,"Using an unbiased systems genetics approach, we previously predicted a role for CHAC1 in the endoplasmic reticulum stress pathway, linked functionally to activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) following treatment with oxidized phospholipids, a model for atherosclerosis. Mouse and yeast CHAC1 homologs have been shown to degrade glutathione in yeast and a cell-free system. In this report, we further defined the ATF4-CHAC1 interaction by cloning the human CHAC1 promoter upstream of a luciferase reporter system for in vitro assays in HEK293 and U2OS cells. Mutation and deletion analyses defined two major cis DNA elements necessary and sufficient for CHAC1 promoter-driven luciferase transcription under conditions of ER stress or ATF4 coexpression: the -267 ATF/cAMP response element (CRE) site and a novel -248 ATF/CRE modifier (ACM) element. We also examined the ability of the CHAC1 ATF/CRE and ACM sequences to bind ATF4 and ATF3 using immunoblot-EMSA and confirmed ATF4, ATF3, and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein β binding at the human CHAC1 promoter in the proximity of the ATF/CRE and ACM using ChIP. To further validate the function of CHAC1 in a human cell model, we measured glutathione levels in HEK293 cells with enhanced CHAC1 expression. Overexpression of CHAC1 led to a robust depletion of glutathione, which was alleviated in a CHAC1 catalytic mutant. These results suggest an important role for CHAC1 in oxidative stress and apoptosis with implications for human health and disease."
https://openalex.org/W2045714496,"Marine taxa are threatened by anthropogenic impacts, but knowledge of their extinction vulnerabilities is limited. The fossil record provides rich information on past extinctions that can help predict biotic responses. We show that over 23 million years, taxonomic membership and geographic range size consistently explain a large proportion of extinction risk variation in six major taxonomic groups. We assess intrinsic risk-extinction risk predicted by paleontologically calibrated models-for modern genera in these groups. Mapping the geographic distribution of these genera identifies coastal biogeographic provinces where fauna with high intrinsic risk are strongly affected by human activity or climate change. Such regions are disproportionately in the tropics, raising the possibility that these ecosystems may be particularly vulnerable to future extinctions. Intrinsic risk provides a prehuman baseline for considering current threats to marine biodiversity."

Point defects can arise naturally as magnetic monopoles resulting from symmetry breaking in grand unified theories. We devised an experiment to create and detect quantum mechanical analogs of such monopoles in a spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensate. The defects, which were stable on the time scale of our experiments, were identified from spin-resolved images of the condensate density profile that exhibit a characteristic dependence on the choice of quantization axis. Our observations lay the foundation for experimental studies of the dynamics and stability of topological point defects in quantum systems."

Recent studies showed that brown adipose tissue is present in adult humans and may be exploited for its anti-obesity and anti-diabetes actions. Apelin is an adipocyte-derived hormone that plays important roles in energy metabolism. Here, we report that apelin-APJ signaling promotes brown adipocyte differentiation by increasing the expressions of brown adipogenic and thermogenic transcriptional factors via the PI3K/Akt and AMPK signaling pathways.

In addition, apelin increases the basal activity of brown adipocytes, as evidenced by the increased PGC1α and UCP1 expressions, mitochondrial biogenesis, and oxygen consumption. Finally, we provide both in vitro and in vivo evidence that apelin is able to increase the brown-like characteristics in white adipocytes.

In contrast, excess accumulation of white adipose tissue (WAT) has notorious effects on the development of metabolic disorders, such as diabetes and cardiovascular diseases (12.Grundy S.M. Obesity, metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular disease.J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2004; 89: 2595-2600Crossref PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar). Interestingly, brown fat-like cells (also known as beige cells) have been identified in WAT, and brown fat-like characteristics (e.g. UCP1 expression) are reduced in WAT of obese humans (13.Carey A.L. Vorlander C. Reddy-Luthmoodoo M. Natoli A.K. Formosa M.F. Bertovic D.A. Anderson M.J. Duffy S.J.

On the other hand, it is increasingly recognized that WAT is not merely a passive depot for storage of excess energy as fat but also the largest endocrine organ, producing a variety of bioactive factors called adipokines (18.Trayhurn P.

Apelin is a relatively recent member of the adipokine family (24.Boucher J. Masri B. Daviaud D. Gesta S. Guigné C. Mazzucotelli A. Castan-Laurell I. Tack I. Knibiehler B. Carpéné C. Audigier Y.

The antagonistic effects of apelin on diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance are attributable to its stimulation on UCP1 expression in BAT and body energy expenditure (30.Higuchi K. Masaki T.

Here, we aim for the first time to reveal the effects of apelin on adipose browning (differentiation of brown preadipocytes in BAT, metabolic activities of mature brown adipocytes, and browning of white adipocytes in WAT). The primary rat brown preadipocytes isolated from interscapular BAT were purchased from CosmoBio Co. Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). In some experiments, the primary white and brown preadipocytes, isolated from mouse WAT and interscapular BAT, were also used. After digestion with 0.2% collagenase and centrifugation (1,500 rpm, 5 min), the stromal vascular fraction/preadipose cells from WAT and BAT were isolated as described before (32.Kim H.J. Cho H.

MicroRNAs are required for the feature maintenance and differentiation of brown adipocytes.Diabetes. 2014; 63: 4045-4056Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Preadipose cells were seeded in 6-well plates and cultured with the basal growth medium (DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1 nm 3,5,3′-triiodothyronine, 1% penicillin and streptomycin) at 37 °C and in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 and 95% air. For adipocyte differentiation, fully confluent cells (defined as day 0) were treated for 2 days with induction medium (basal growth medium supplemented with 0.5 μg/ml insulin, 1 μm dexamethasone, 0.5 mm isobutylmethylxanthine). At day 2, the cells were incubated for another 2 days with growth medium containing insulin, and thereafter, the medium was replenished every other day for the next 6–8 days. The Transwell indirect contact co-culture system (Corning Inc.) was used to co-culture the primary rat brown preadipocytes and primary rat macrophages (isolated from adult rat bone marrow tissue; ScienCell Research Laboratories). The human preadipocytes (Zen-Bio Inc.), collected from subcutaneous WAT (non-diabetic subject, body mass index 25–29.9), were cultured in DMEM/F-12 (1:1, v/v) containing 10% FBS until confluence. Adipocyte differentiation was then induced similarly as reported previously (33.Than A. Leow M.K. Chen P.

Specifically, the cells were treated for 4 days with human adipocyte growth medium (serum-free DMEM/F-12 containing 33 μm biotin, 17 μm pantothenate, 10 μg/ml transferrin, 1 nm 3,5,3′-triiodothyronine) supplemented with 0.5 μg/ml insulin, 0.5 mm isobutylmethylxanthine, 1 μm dexamethasone, and 1 μm troglitazone. The cells were then incubated in the growth medium containing insulin and dexamethasone for 12–14 days (replenishment every other day). The mouse 3T3-L1 cells (white preadipose cell line, ATCC) were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum until confluence. The cells were then treated with the induction medium for 2 days (days 0–2), followed by growing for an additional 2 days in the growth medium containing insulin alone (days 2–4). Finally, the cells were grown for 4–6 days without insulin. The human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs; Lonza Inc.) collected from bone marrow of normal subjects were grown in the basal growth medium until confluence. The stem cells were subsequently induced to differentiate into adipocytes as described previously (35.Scott M.A. Nguyen V.T. Levi B. James A.W. Current methods of adipogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells.Stem Cells Dev. 2011; 20: 1793-1804Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Specifically, stem cells were treated for 3 days in the induction medium (plus 200 μm indomethacin). In the next 12–14 days, the cells were maintained in the growth medium containing insulin alone (replenishment every other day). Adipocyte differentiation was confirmed by Oil Red O staining, visual appearance of intracellular lipid droplets, and immunoblot analyses of adipocyte-specific proteins (e.g. adipocyte protein 2 (ap2), leptin) as well as brown adipocyte-specific proteins (e.g. UCP1). At least two different batches (donors) of the primary cells were used for every experiment. All culture media, supplements, and sera were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Pyr-apelin13 (pyroglutamated 13-amino acid peptide), insulin, and troglitazone were purchased from Tocris Bioscience. All other reagents and chemicals were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. All animal experimental protocols were approved by the SingHealth Research Facilities Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (Singapore). Mice (C57BL/6J, 8–10 weeks old, male) were housed in light- and temperature-controlled facility (12-h light/12-h dark cycle, 21 °C), and allowed free access to standard laboratory food and water. Mice were divided into apelin-treated and non-treated (100 μl of saline, control) groups. Based on the previous studies (30.Higuchi K. Masaki T. Gotoh K. Chiba S. Katsuragi I. Tanaka K. Kakuma T.

Animals were sacrificed 24 h after the last dose, and body and fat tissue weights were measured in all animals. Inguinal WAT, epididymal WAT, and interscapular BAT were removed and frozen in liquid nitrogen for further experiments. Tissues were homogenized in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (containing protease inhibitor mixture) (Roche Applied Science), and protein concentration was determined by a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay (Pierce) before the immunoblot analyses were carried out (using the same amount of the protein lysates). Gene silencing of apelin (APLN) or APJ receptor (APLNR) in brown preadipocytes was achieved using a rat APLN siRNA or APLNR siRNA (Ambion Silencer Select, Life Technology), respectively. Akt siRNAs (sc-43610 and sc-108059; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) and AMPK siRNAs (sc- 45313 and sc-270142) were also used for gene silencing of Akt or AMPK in adipose cells. Transfection was done as described previously (33.Than A. Leow M.K. Chen P.

Specifically, adipose cells were incubated with Opti-MEM containing a complex of Lipofectamine-RNAiMAX transfection reagent (0.5% (v/v), Life Technologies, Inc.) with siRNAs (25 nm) for 4 h, followed by the addition of basal growth medium and incubation for another 1–2 days. Knockdowns of protein expression were confirmed by immunoblot analyses. Adipocytes grown on Lab-Tek II chambered coverglass were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at room temperature and then washed twice with ice-cold PBS. In some experiments, the cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min. After being blocked with 1% bovine albumin (BSA) in PBST (PBS with 0.1% Tween 20) at room temperature for 1 h, the cells were then incubated (4 °C) overnight in PBST with 1% BSA and primary antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology): anti-apelin IgG (sc-33805), anti-APJ IgG (sc-33823), anti-UCP1 IgG (sc-6529), anti-β1-AR IgG (sc-568), or anti β3-AR IgG (sc-50436). After washing with PBS, the cells were incubated in FITC-labeled or Atto647 NHS-labeled secondary antibody (Sigma) for 1 h at room temperature, followed by washing three times with PBS. Adipocytes were then imaged using a confocal laser scanning microscope (LSM 510 Meta, Carl Zeiss GmbH). To reveal the mitochondrial membrane potential and morphology, adipocytes were incubated with the growth medium containing 0.2 μm MitoTracker Red FM (Life Technologies) (excitation/emission, 581 nm/644 nm) (at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator) for 15 or 30 min, before live cell imaging with a confocal microscopy. MitoTracker Red is widely used to assess both mitochondrial morphology and membrane potential in living cells, because it is selectively localized in mitochondria, whereas its accumulation is dependent on transmembrane potential (34.Than A.

After brief vortexing and centrifugation at 4 °C, the supernatant was collected, and the protein content was determined by a BCA protein assay (Pierce). Each sample with an equal amount of proteins was separated through 12% SDS-PAGE before it was transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The membranes were then blocked for 2 h at room temperature in Superblock blocking buffer, followed by subsequent incubation for 12 h in Tris-buffered saline-Tween solution (TBST) containing primary antibody (1:100–400 dilution).

Antibodies against UCP1 (PA1–24894) or PRDM16 (PA5-20872) from Fisher were also used in our experiments. Oxygen consumption was assessed using an oxygen consumption rate assay kit (MitoXpress-Xtra HS method) (Cayman Chemical) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, preadipocytes were grown in 96-well plates (3 × 104 cells/well) until confluence and induced to differentiate into adipocytes. Adipocytes were treated with 10 μl of MitoXpress-Xtra (a phosphorescent oxygen-sensitive probe whose signal increases over time when O2 is depleted in the solution) immediately before measuring the fluorescence intensity (excitation/emission, 380 nm/650 nm at 37 °C, 0.5-min interval) using a time-resolved fluorescence plate reader (SpectraMax M5, Molecular Devices). Measurement was performed under a sealed environment (by overlaying each well with HS Mineral Oil), in which the exchange of O2 was limited. Oxygen-consuming glucose oxidase was used as a reference. Data were analyzed as mean ± S.E. Statistical differences between two means were assessed using Student's t test (unpaired, two-tailed).

https://openalex.org/W2056881310,"DNA methylation has been referred as an important player in plant genomic responses to environmental stresses but correlations between the methylome plasticity and specific traits of interest are still far from being understood. In this study, we inspected global DNA methylation levels in salt tolerant and sensitive rice varieties upon salt stress imposition. Global DNA methylation was quantified using the 5-methylcytosine (5mC) antibody and an ELISA-based technique, which is an affordable and quite pioneer assay in plants, and in situ imaging of methylation sites in interphase nuclei of tissue sections. Variations of global DNA methylation levels in response to salt stress were tissue- and genotype-dependent. We show a connection between a higher ability of DNA methylation adjustment levels and salt stress tolerance. The salt-tolerant rice variety Pokkali was remarkable in its ability to quickly relax DNA methylation in response to salt stress. In spite of the same tendency for reduction of global methylation under salinity, in the salt-sensitive rice variety IR29 such reduction was not statistically supported. In 'Pokkali', the salt stress-induced demethylation may be linked to active demethylation due to increased expression of DNA demethylases under salt stress. In 'IR29', the induction of both DNA demethylases and methyltransferases may explain the lower plasticity of DNA methylation. We further show that mutations for epigenetic regulators affected specific phenotypic parameters related to salinity tolerance, such as the root length and biomass. This work emphasizes the role of differential methylome flexibility between salt tolerant and salt sensitive rice varieties as an important player in salt stress tolerance, reinforcing the need to better understand the connection between epigenetic networks and plant responses to environmental stresses."

PepT1, a di/tripeptide transporter that uptakes bacterial products, is up-regulated in inflamed colon tissue, which implies its role in bacterium-associated intestinal inflammation. Although microRNA (miRNA)-mediated gene regulation has been found to be involved in various processes of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), the biological function of miRNAs in the pathogenesis of IBD remains to be explored. In this study we detected miRNA expression patterns in colon tissues during colitis and investigated the mechanism underlying the regulation of colonic PepT1 by miRNAs. We observed an inverse correlation between PepT1 and miR-193a-3p in inflamed colon tissues with active ulcerative colitis, and we further demonstrated that miR-193a-3p reduced PepT1 expression and activity as a target gene and subsequently suppressed the NF-κB pathway. Intracolonic delivery of miR-193a-3p significantly ameliorated dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis, whereas the overexpression of colonic PepT1 via PepT1 3′-untranslated region mutant lentivirus vector abolished the anti-inflammatory effect of miR-193a-3p. Furthermore, antibiotic treatment eliminated the difference in the dextran sodium sulfate-induced inflammation between the presence and absence of miR-193a-3p. These findings suggest that miR-193a-3p regulation of PepT1 mediates the uptake of bacterial products and is a potent mechanism during the colonic inflammation process.

Here we describe an interaction between Ty1 integrase and the AC40 subunit of Pol III and demonstrate that AC40 is the predominant determinant targeting Ty1 integration upstream of Pol III-transcribed genes. Lack of an integrase-AC40 interaction dramatically alters target site choice, leading to a redistribution of Ty1 insertions in the genome, mainly to chromosome ends.

In this article, we investigate an effect that might have significant experimental implications for investigators who wish to study these peptides, namely, that the peptides adsorb to solid surfaces of glass and plastic. Specifically, we use analytical HPLC to systematically quantify the adsorption of the three cationic membrane-active peptides mastoparan X, melittin, and magainin 2 to the walls of commonly used glass and plastic sample containers. Our results show that, at typical experimental peptide concentrations, 90% or more of the peptides might be lost from solution due to rapid adsorption to the walls of the sample containers. Thus, our results emphasize that investigators should always keep these adsorption effects in mind when designing and interpreting experiments on cationic membrane-active peptides. We conclude the article by discussing different strategies for reducing the experimental impact of these adsorption effects."

https://openalex.org/W2070586825,"Diagnosis of psychiatric disorders based on brain imaging data is highly desirable in clinical applications. However, a common problem in applying machine learning algorithms is that the number of imaging data dimensions often greatly exceeds the number of available training samples. Furthermore, interpretability of the learned classifier with respect to brain function and anatomy is an important, but non-trivial issue. We propose the use of logistic regression with a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) to capture the most critical input features. In particular, we consider application of group LASSO to select brain areas relevant to diagnosis. An additional advantage of LASSO is its probabilistic output, which allows evaluation of diagnosis certainty. To verify our approach, we obtained semantic and phonological verbal fluency fMRI data from 31 depression patients and 31 control subjects, and compared the performances of group LASSO (gLASSO), and sparse group LASSO (sgLASSO) to those of standard LASSO (sLASSO), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest. Over 90% classification accuracy was achieved with gLASSO, sgLASSO, as well as SVM; however, in contrast to SVM, LASSO approaches allow for identification of the most discriminative weights and estimation of prediction reliability. Semantic task data revealed contributions to the classification from left precuneus, left precentral gyrus, left inferior frontal cortex (pars triangularis), and left cerebellum (c rus1). Weights for the phonological task indicated contributions from left inferior frontal operculum, left post central gyrus, left insula, left middle frontal cortex, bilateral middle temporal cortices, bilateral precuneus, left inferior frontal cortex (pars triangularis), and left precentral gyrus. The distribution of normalized odds ratios further showed, that predictions with absolute odds ratios higher than 0.2 could be regarded as certain."

The amino-acid sequence was then analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight tandem (MALDI-TOF/TOF) mass spectrometry. After the cloning and expression of recombinant putative autoantigen in a bacterial expression system, the corresponding immuno assay was set up and utilized to observe the prevalence of serum autoantibodies in a large set of confirmed clinical samples.One positive autoantigen was identified as prohibitin.

We developed a series of ionic head groups-appended self-assembled monolayers with C2, C6, C8, and C12 space-filling alkyl chains, which capture a dendritic guest via the formation of multiple salt bridges.

https://openalex.org/W1991486316,"Background Behavioural disorders and psychological symptoms of Dementia (BPSD) are commonly observed in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and strongly contribute to increasing patients' disability. Using voxel-lesion-symptom mapping (VLSM), we investigated the impact of white matter lesions (WMLs) on the severity of BPSD in patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (a-MCI). Methods Thirty-one a-MCI patients (with a conversion rate to AD of 32% at 2 year follow-up) and 26 healthy controls underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination at 3T, including T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated-inversion-recovery images, and T1-weighted volumes. In the patient group, BPSD was assessed using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory-12. After quantitative definition of WMLs, their distribution was investigated, without an a priori anatomical hypothesis, against patients’ behavioural symptoms. Unbiased regional grey matter volumetrics was also used to assess the contribution of grey matter atrophy to BPSD. Results Apathy, irritability, depression/dysphoria, anxiety and agitation were shown to be the most common symptoms in the patient sample. Despite a more widespread anatomical distribution, a-MCI patients did not differ from controls in WML volumes. VLSM revealed a strict association between the presence of lesions in the anterior thalamic radiations (ATRs) and the severity of apathy. Regional grey matter atrophy did not account for any BPSD. Conclusions This study indicates that damage to the ATRs is strategic for the occurrence of apathy in patients with a-MCI. Disconnection between the prefrontal cortex and the mediodorsal and anterior thalamic nuclei might represent the pathophysiological substrate for apathy, which is one of the most common psychopathological symptoms observed in dementia."
https://openalex.org/W3121768680,"The interplay of magnetic exchange interactions and tunneling underlies many complex quantum phenomena observed in real materials. We study nonequilibrium magnetization dynamics in an extended two-dimensional (2D) system by loading effective spin-1/2 bosons into a spin-dependent optical lattice and use the lattice to separately control the resonance conditions for tunneling and superexchange. After preparing a nonequilibrium antiferromagnetically ordered state, we observe relaxation dynamics governed by two well-separated rates, which scale with the parameters associated with superexchange and tunneling. With tunneling off-resonantly suppressed, we observe superexchange-dominated dynamics over two orders of magnitude in magnetic coupling strength. Our experiment will serve as a benchmark for future theoretical work as the detailed dynamics of this 2D, strongly correlated, and far-from-equilibrium quantum system remain out of reach of current computational techniques."
https://openalex.org/W2085264133,"Mechanical properties of cells have been recognized as a biomarker for cellular cytoskeletal organization. As chemical treatments lead to cell cytoskeletal rearrangements, thereby, modifications of cellular mechanical properties, investigating cellular mechanical property variations provides insightful knowledge to effects of chemical treatments on cancer cells. In this study, the effects of eight different anticancer drugs on the mechanical properties of human prostate cancer cell (PC-3) are investigated using a recently developed control-based nanoindentation measurement (CNM) protocol on atomic force microscope (AFM). The CNM protocol overcomes the limits of other existing methods to in-liquid nanoindentation measurement of live cells on AFM, particularly for measuring mechanical properties of live cells. The Young's modulus of PC-3 cells treated by the eight drugs was measured by varying force loading rates over three orders of magnitude, and compared to the values of the control. The results showed that the Young's modulus of the PC-3 cells increased substantially by the eight drugs tested, and became much more pronounced as the force load rate increased. Moreover, two distinct trends were clearly expressed, where under the treatment of Disulfiram, paclitaxel, and MK-2206, the exponent coefficient of the frequency- modulus function remained almost unchanged, while with Celebrex, BAY, Totamine, TPA, and Vaproic acid, the exponential rate was significantly increased."
https://openalex.org/W2051334871,"Community detection has drawn a lot of attention as it can provide invaluable help in understanding the function and visualizing the structure of networks. Since single objective optimization methods have intrinsic drawbacks to identifying multiple significant community structures, some methods formulate the community detection as multi-objective problems and adopt population-based evolutionary algorithms to obtain multiple community structures. Evolutionary algorithms have strong global search ability, but have difficulty in locating local optima efficiently. In this study, in order to identify multiple significant community structures more effectively, a multi-objective memetic algorithm for community detection is proposed by combining multi-objective evolutionary algorithm with a local search procedure. The local search procedure is designed by addressing three issues. Firstly, nondominated solutions generated by evolutionary operations and solutions in dominant population are set as initial individuals for local search procedure. Then, a new direction vector named as pseudonormal vector is proposed to integrate two objective functions together to form a fitness function. Finally, a network specific local search strategy based on label propagation rule is expanded to search the local optimal solutions efficiently. The extensive experiments on both artificial and real-world networks evaluate the proposed method from three aspects. Firstly, experiments on influence of local search procedure demonstrate that the local search procedure can speed up the convergence to better partitions and make the algorithm more stable. Secondly, comparisons with a set of classic community detection methods illustrate the proposed method can find single partitions effectively. Finally, the method is applied to identify hierarchical structures of networks which are beneficial for analyzing networks in multi-resolution levels."
https://openalex.org/W2086206776,"The expression of testicular genes following acute heat stress has been reported in layer-type roosters, but few similar studies have been conducted on broilers. This study investigated the effect of acute heat stress on the gene expression in the testes of a broiler-type strain of Taiwan country chickens. Roosters were subjected to acute heat stress (38°C) for 4 h, and then exposed to 25°C, with testes collected 0, 2, and 6 h after the cessation of heat stress, using non-heat-stressed roosters as controls (n = 3 roosters per group). The body temperature and respiratory rate increased significantly (p<0.05) during the heat stress. The numbers of apoptotic cells increased 2 h after the acute heat stress (79 ± 7 vs. 322 ± 192, control vs. heat stress; p<0.05), which was earlier than the time of increase in layer-type roosters. Based on a chicken 44 K oligo microarray, 163 genes were found to be expressed significantly different in the testes of the heat-stressed chickens from those of the controls, including genes involved in the response to stimulus, protein metabolism, signal transduction, cell adhesion, transcription, and apoptosis. The mRNA expressions of upregulated genes, including HSP25, HSP90AA1, HSPA2, and LPAR2, and of downregulated genes, including CDH5, CTNNA3, EHF, CIRBP, SLA, and NTF3, were confirmed through quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Moreover, numerous transcripts in the testes exhibited distinct expressions between the heat-stressed broiler-type and layer-type chickens. We concluded that the transcriptional responses of testes to acute heat stress may differ between the broiler-type and layer-type roosters. Whether the differential expression patterns associate with the heat-tolerance in the strains require a further exploration."
https://openalex.org/W2086677044,"The physiological roles of macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) in lean white adipose tissue homeostasis have received little attention. Because DCs are generated from bone marrow progenitors in the presence of granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), we used GM-CSF-deficient (Csf2−/−) mice fed a low fat diet to test the hypothesis that adipose tissue DCs regulate the development of adipose tissue. At 4 weeks of age, Csf2−/− mice had 75% fewer CD45+Cd11b+Cd11c+MHCII+ F4/80− DCs in white adipose tissue than did wild-type controls. Furthermore, the Csf2−/− mice showed a 30% increase in whole body adiposity, which persisted to adulthood. Adipocytes from Csf2−/− mice were 50% larger by volume and contained higher levels of adipogenesis gene transcripts, indicating enhanced adipocyte differentiation. In contrast, adipogenesis/adipocyte lipid accumulation was inhibited when preadipocytes were co-cultured with CD45+Cd11b+Cd11c+MHCII+F4/80− DCs. Medium conditioned by DCs, but not by macrophages, also inhibited adipocyte lipid accumulation. Proteomic analysis revealed that matrix metalloproteinase 12 and fibronectin 1 were greatly enriched in the medium conditioned by DCs compared with that conditioned by macrophages. Silencing fibronectin or genetic deletion of matrix metalloproteinase 12 in DCs partially reversed the inhibition of adipocyte lipid accumulation. Our observations indicate that DCs residing in adipose tissue play a critical role in suppressing normal adipose tissue expansion."

Syndecan-1 shedding is induced by bacterial virulence factors, and inhibition of shedding attenuates bacterial virulence, whereas administration of purified syndecan-1 ectodomain enhances virulence, suggesting that bacteria subvert syndecan-1 ectodomains released by shedding for their pathogenesis. However, the pro-pathogenic functions of syndecan-1 ectodomain have yet to be clearly defined. Here, we examined how syndecan-1 ectodomain enhances Staphylococcus aureus virulence in injured mouse corneas. We found that syndecan-1 ectodomain promotes S. aureus corneal infection in an HS-dependent manner. Surprisingly, we found that this pro-pathogenic activity is dependent on 2-O-sulfated domains in HS, indicating that the effects of syndecan-1 ectodomain are structure-based. Our results also showed that purified syndecan-1 ectodomain and heparan compounds containing 2-O-sulfate motifs inhibit S. aureus killing by antimicrobial factors secreted by degranulated neutrophils, but does not affect intracellular phagocytic killing by neutrophils. Immunodepletion of antimicrobial factors with staphylocidal activities demonstrated that CRAMP, a cationic antimicrobial peptide, is primarily responsible for S. aureus killing among other factors secreted by degranulated neutrophils. Furthermore, we found that purified syndecan-1 ectodomain and heparan compounds containing 2-O-sulfate units potently and specifically inhibit S. aureus killing by synthetic CRAMP. These results provide compelling evidence that a specific subclass of sulfate groups, and not the overall charge of HS, permits syndecan-1 ectodomains to promote S. aureus corneal infection by inhibiting a key arm of neutrophil host defense.

https://openalex.org/W2039756789,"Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is characterized by epithelial activation and chronic T-cell infiltration in sinonasal mucosa and nasal polyps. IL-33 is a new cytokine of the IL-1 cytokine family that has a pro-inflammatory and Th2 type cytokine induction property. The role of IL-33 in the pathomechanisms of CRS and its interaction with other T cell subsets remain to be fully understood.The main trigger for IL-33 mRNA expression in primary human sinonasal epithelial cells was determined in multiple cytokine and T-cell stimulated cultures. The effects of IL-33 on naïve, Th0 and memory T-cells was studied by PCR, ELISA and flow cytometry. Biopsies from sinus tissue were analyzed by PCR and immunofluorescence for the presence of different cytokines and receptors with a special focus on IL-33.IL-33 was mainly induced by IFN-γ in primary sinonasal epithelial cells, and induced a typical CRSwNP Th2 favoring cytokine profile upon co-culture with T-helper cell subsets. IL-33 and its receptor ST2 were highly expressed in the inflamed epithelial tissue of CRS patients. While IL-33 was significantly up-regulated in the epithelium for CRSsNP, its receptor was higher expressed in sinus tissue from CRSwNP.The present study delineates the influence of IL-33 in upper airway epithelium and a potential role of IL-33 in chronic inflammation of CRSwNP by enhancing Th2 type cytokine production, which could both contribute to a further increase of an established Th2 profile in CRSwNP."
https://openalex.org/W2171234286,"Microglial cells are normally activated in response to brain injury or immunological stimuli to protect central nervous system (CNS). However, over-activation of microglia conversely amplifies the inflammatory effects and mediates cellular degeneration, leading to the death of neurons. Recently, cordycepin, an active component found in Cordyceps militarisa known as a rare Chinese caterpillar fungus, has been reported as an effective drug for treating inflammatory diseases and cancer via unclear mechanisms. In this study, we attempted to identify the anti-inflammatory role of cordycepin and its protective effects on the impairments of neural growth and development induced by microglial over-activation. The results indicate that cordycepin could attenuate the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced microglial activation, evidenced by the dramatically reduced release of TNF-α and IL-1β, as well as the down-regulation of mRNA levels of iNOS and COX-2 after cordycepin treatment. Besides, cordycepin reversed the LPS-induced activation of NF-κB pathway, resulting in anti-inflammatory effects. Furthermore, by employing the conditioned medium (CM), we found cordycepin was able to recover the impairments of neural growth and development in the primary hippocampal neurons cultured in LPS-CM, including cell viability, growth cone extension, neurite sprouting and outgrowth as well as spinogenesis. This study expands our knowledge of the anti-inflammatory function of cordycepin and paves the way for the biomedical applications of cordycepin in the therapies of neural injuries."
https://openalex.org/W2069012967,"Spontaneous deep intracerebral hemorrhage (SDICH) is a devastating stroke subtype. The causes of SDICH are heterogeneous. Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9, Gelantinase B) has been shown to relate to stroke and the development of aneurysm and may increase risks of intracerebral hemorrhage. MMP activities are modulated by their endogenous inhibitors, tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs). We analyzed the genetic variants of MMP-9 and TIMP-1 and SDICH susceptibility.Associations were tested by logistic regression or general linear models with adjusting for multiple covariables. Multiplicative terms between genes were applied to detect the interaction effects on SDICH. Permutation testing of 1,000 replicates was performed for empirical estimates.In the group of ≥65 years old (y/o), we found associations of SDICH with rs3787268 (Odds ratio [OR] = 0.48, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.27 to 0.86, P = 0.01) and haplotype1 (Hap1) (OR = 0.48, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.86, P = 0.014). For TIMP1 gene, rs4898 was associated with SDICH in the elder male group (OR = 0.35, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.81, P = 0.015). In contrast, in the younger male group, there were associations of SDICH with rs2250889 (OR = 0.48, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.84, P = 0.01) and Hap3 (OR = 0.61, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.97, P = 0.04). We found significant genetic interaction between TIMP-1 and MMP-9 in SDICH susceptibility among younger male subjects (P = 0.004). In subjects carrying rs4898 minor allele, carriers with Hap3 had lower SDICH risk than non-carriers (OR = 0.19, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.51, P = 0.001). In addition, this study showed that when young males were exposed to alcohol, Hap3 was a protective factor of SDICH (OR = 0.06, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.27, P = 0.0002). In contrast, when they were exposed to smoke, Hap2 carriers had increased risk of SDICH (OR = 2.45, 95% CI 1.05 to 5.73, P = 0.04).This study showed modest to moderate effects of MMP-9 and TIMP-1 polymorphisms on SDICH risks with significant age differences. MMP-9 may interact with alcohol to play a role in the SDICH risk in young men."
https://openalex.org/W2013970896,"The Par1 kinases, also known as microtubule affinity-regulating kinases (MARKs), are important for the establishment of cell polarity from worms to mammals. Dysregulation of these kinases has been implicated in autism, Alzheimer’s disease and cancer. Despite their important function in health and disease, it has been unclear how the activity of MARK/Par1 is regulated by signals from cell surface receptors. Here we show that MARK/Par1 is activated downstream of NMDA receptors in primary hippocampal neurons. Further, we show that this activation is dependent on protein kinase A (PKA), through the phosphorylation of Ser431 of Par4/LKB1, the major upstream kinase of MARK/Par1. Together, our data reveal a novel mechanism by which MARK/Par1 is activated at the neuronal synapse."
https://openalex.org/W2066430807,"Improved versions of inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) sensors were created to follow intracellular InsP3 changes in single living cells and in cell populations. Similar to previous InsP3 sensors the new sensors are based on the ligand binding domain of the human type-I InsP3 receptor (InsP3R-LBD), but contain a mutation of either R265K or R269K to lower their InsP3 binding affinity. Tagging the InsP3R-LBD with N-terminal Cerulean and C-terminal Venus allowed measurement of InsP3 in single-cell FRET experiments. Replacing Cerulean with a Luciferase enzyme allowed experiments in multi-cell format by measuring the change in the BRET signal upon stimulation. These sensors faithfully followed the agonist-induced increase in InsP3 concentration in HEK 293T cells expressing the Gq-coupled AT1 angiotensin receptor detecting a response to agonist concentration as low as 10 pmol/L. Compared to the wild type InsP3 sensor, the mutant sensors showed an improved off-rate, enabling a more rapid and complete return of the signal to the resting value of InsP3 after termination of M3 muscarinic receptor stimulation by atropine. For parallel measurements of intracellular InsP3 and Ca2+ levels in BRET experiments, the Cameleon D3 Ca2+ sensor was modified by replacing its CFP with luciferase. In these experiments depletion of plasma membrane PtdIns(4,5)P2 resulted in the fall of InsP3 level, followed by the decrease of the Ca2+-signal evoked by the stimulation of the AT1 receptor. In contrast, when type-III PI 4-kinases were inhibited with a high concentration of wortmannin or a more specific inhibitor, A1, the decrease of the Ca2+-signal preceded the fall of InsP3 level indicating an InsP3-, independent, direct regulation of capacitative Ca2+ influx by plasma membrane inositol lipids. Taken together, our results indicate that the improved InsP3 sensor can be used to monitor both the increase and decrease of InsP3 levels in live cells suitable for high-throughput BRET applications."
https://openalex.org/W2015422910,"Variation in food stoichiometry affects individual performance and population dynamics, but it is also likely that species with different life histories should differ in their sensitivity to food stoichiometry. To address this question, we investigated the ability of the three nettle-feeding butterflies (Aglais urticae, Polygonia c-album, and Aglais io) to respond adaptively to induced variation in plant stoichiometry in terms of larval performance. We hypothesized that variation in larval performance between plant fertilization treatments should be functionally linked to species differences in host plant specificity. We found species-specific differences in larval performance between plant fertilization treatments that could not be explained by nutrient limitation. We showed a clear evidence of a positive correlation between food stoichiometry and development time to pupal stage and pupal mass in A. urticae. The other two species showed a more complex response. Our results partly supported our prediction that host plant specificity affects larval sensitivity to food stoichiometry. However, we suggest that most of the differences observed may instead be explained by differences in voltinism (number of generations per year). We believe that the potential of some species to respond adaptively to variation in plant nutrient content needs further attention in the face of increased eutrophication due to nutrient leakage from human activities."
https://openalex.org/W1986794125,"Over the past decades, studies have reported that the combinatorial regulation of transcription factors (TFs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) is essential for the appropriate execution of biological events and developmental processes. Dysregulations of these regulators often cause diseases. However, there are no available resources on the regulatory cascades of TFs and miRNAs in the context of human diseases. To fulfill this vacancy, we established the TMREC database in this study. First, we integrated curated transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulations to construct the TF and miRNA regulatory network. Next, we identified all linear paths using the Breadth First Search traversal method. Finally, we used known disease-related genes and miRNAs to measure the strength of association between cascades and diseases. Currently, TMREC consists of 74,248 cascades and 25,194 cascade clusters, involving in 412 TFs, 266 miRNAs and 545 diseases. With the expanding of experimental support regulation data, we will regularly update the database. TMREC aims to help experimental biologists to comprehensively analyse gene expression regulation, to understand the aetiology and to predict novel therapeutic targets.TMREC is freely available at http://bioinfo.hrbmu.edu.cn/TMREC/."

We assessed current practices in a rural 'township hospital' (a primary care facility), and compared them with international evidence-based practice.A questionnaire survey was conducted to examine the use of modern drugs (antihypertensive drugs, statins and aspirin) and traditional drugs, compliance to medications and lifestyle among 274 hypertensive patients aged 40-74, with a CVD risk of 20% or higher (using the Asian Equation).The majority (72%) were diagnosed with hypertension at township hospitals. Only 15% of study participants used two anti-hypertensive drugs, 0.7% took statin and 2.9% aspirin. Only 2.9% combined two types of modern drugs, while 0.4% combined three types (antihypertensives, statins and aspirin). Herbal compounds, sometimes with internationally rarely recommended drugs such as Reserpine were taken by 44%. Analysis of drug adherence showed that 9.8% had discontinued their drug therapy by themselves. 16% had missed doses and these were on less anti-hypertensive drugs than those who did not (t=-5.217, P=0.003). Of all participants, 28% currently smoked, 39% drank regularly and only 21% exercised frequently. The average salt intake per day was 7.1 (±3.8) g, while the national recommended level is 6g.The study revealed outdated and inadequate treatment and health education for hypertensive patients, especially for those who have high risk scores for CVD. There is a need to review the community-based guidelines for hypertension management. Health providers and patients should make a transition from solely treating hypertension, towards prevention of CVD. Health system issues need addressing including improving rural health insurance cover and primary care doctors' capacity to manage chronic disease patients."

Recent research has started to identify the specific genes or genomic regions correlate to improved agronomic traits, however, an apparent blank between the genetic structure of crop elite varieties and their improving histories in diverse modern breeding programs is still in existence. Foxtail millet (Setaria italica) was one of the earliest cereal crops to be domesticated and served as a staple crop for early civilizations in China, where it is still widely grown today. In the present trial, a panel of foxtail millet elite varieties, which were released in the last sixty years in different geographical regions of China, was characterized using microsatellite markers (SSRs). A clear separation of two subpopulations corresponding to the two eco-geographical regions of foxtail millet production in China was identified by the dataset, which also indicated that in more recently released elite varieties, large quantities of accessions have been transferred from spring-sowing to summer-sowing ecotypes, likely as a result of breeding response to planting configurations. An association mapping study was conducted to identify loci controlling traits of major agronomic interest. Furthermore, selective sweeps involved in improvement of foxtail millet were identified as multi-diverse minor effect loci controlling different agronomic traits during the long-term improvement of elite varieties. Our results highlight the effect of transition of planting configuration and breeding preference on genetic evolvement of crop species."

Functional expression analysis in vitro and in vivo indicated that the mutation was responsible for a decrease in posttranslational glycosylation of dystroglycan, eventually interfering with its extracellular-matrix receptor function and laminin binding in skeletal muscle and brain. The X-ray crystal structure of the missense variant T190M of the murine N-terminal domain of α-dystroglycan (50-313) has been determined, and showed an overall topology (Ig-like domain followed by a basket-shaped domain reminiscent of the small subunit ribosomal protein S6) very similar to that of the wild-type structure. The crystallographic analysis revealed a change of the conformation assumed by the highly flexible loop encompassing residues 159-180. Moreover, a solvent shell reorganization around Met190 affects the interaction between the B1-B5 anti-parallel strands forming part of the floor of the basket-shaped domain, with likely repercussions on the folding stability of the protein domain(s) and on the overall molecular flexibility. Chemical denaturation and limited proteolysis experiments point to a decreased stability of the T190M variant with respect to its wild-type counterpart. This mutation may render the entire L-shaped protein architecture less flexible. The overall reduced flexibility and stability may affect the functional properties of α-dystroglycan via negatively influencing its binding behavior to factors needed for dystroglycan maturation, and may lay the molecular basis of the T190M-driven primary dystroglycanopathy."

Unfortunately, no pharmacological tools are available to date to discriminate more precisely among the specific roles of the Cav3 subunits. Toward this goal, we have hypothesized that selective modulation of the Cav3 subunits could be possibly achieved using alternative molecular strategies. Recent studies have identified that the intracellular loop connecting domains I and II (I-II loop) of the Cav3.2 subunit plays an important role in controlling both expression at the plasma membrane and gating of the channel. The proximal part of this I-II loop (subsequent to domain I) was described as a “gating brake” (12Arias-Olguín I.I. Vitko I. Fortuna M. Baumgart J.P. Sokolova S. Shumilin I.A. Van Deusen A.

The various truncated forms of Cav3.2 as well as the I-II loop fragments were generated using PCR techniques, cloned into pEGFP-C1 expression vector (BD Biosciences), and verified using automated DNA sequencing.

Cells were plated at 50–70% confluence for optimal transfection using the JetPEI transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol (QBiogene, Irvine, CA). The Cav1.2 construct was cotransfected with α2/δ1 and β1b subunits (1:2:2 molar ratio) as described earlier (17Bidaud I. Lory P.

In all conditions, corresponding empty plasmids were used to adjust the quantity of the transfected material. Δ1-Cav3.2 and Nter-Cav3.2 were subcloned into the Sindbis viral vector SINrep(nsP2S726) kindly provided by H. Marie (Institut de Pharmacologie Moléculaire et Cellulaire-CNRS UMR 7275). Recombinant SINrep(nsP2S726) constructs and helper plasmid DH-BB(tRNA/TE12) (18Kim J. Dittgen T. Nimmerjahn A. Waters J. Pawlak V. Helmchen F. Schlesinger S. Seeburg P.H. Osten P.

Baby hamster kidney-21 (ATCC CCL-10) cells were electroporated with Δ1-Cav3.2 or Nter-Cav3.2 RNA and the helper RNA (20 × 106 cells/ml, 950 microfarads, 230 V) and grown for 24 h at 37 °C at 5% CO2 in DMEM containing 5% fetal calf serum before collecting the cell supernatant containing viruses. The virus titer (3 × 109 infectious particles/ml) was determined after counting fluorescent baby hamster kidney-21 cells infected using a serial dilution of the virus stock. All procedures involving experimental animals were carried out in accordance with the European Union Council Directive 86-609 and local ethics committee guidelines. All efforts were made to minimize animal suffering and the number of animals used. Brains were excised from 8–12-day-old Wistar rats. A block of tissue containing the thalamus was removed, placed in a cold (<4 °C) oxygenated (95% O2 and 5% CO2) solution of artificial cerebrospinal fluid (125 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 0.4 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.25 mm NaH2PO4, 26 mm NaHCO3, 25 mm glucose, 5 mm sodium pyruvate, and 1 mm kynurenic acid (pH 7.3, osmolarity 310 mOsm)). The block of tissue was glued, ventral surface uppermost, to the stage of a Vibroslice (Leica VT1000S), and 280–300-μm-thick horizontal slices containing the ventrobasal complex (VB) and the NRT were prepared using the internal capsule and the medial lemniscus as landmarks. Slices (three to four per hemisphere) were stored for 30 min in an oxygenated incubation chamber containing artificial cerebrospinal fluid of the above composition and then transferred onto a Millicell CM membrane (Millipore) pre-equilibrated with culture medium (50% minimum Eagle's medium, 50% Hanks' balanced salt solution, 5.5 g/liter glucose, and 1 ml/liter penicillin-streptomycin; Invitrogen). A 2-μl drop of the viral solution (titrated at 3 × 109 infectious particles/ml) was added in the thalamic area containing the VB and NRT. The slices were incubated overnight at 35 °C at 5% CO2. Slices were then transferred in an incubating chamber and equilibrated in continuously oxygenated (95% O2 and 5% CO2) artificial cerebrospinal fluid of the above composition but without kynurenic acid and with 2 mm CaCl2 for at least 1 h at room temperature before being transferred to the recording chamber. In HEK-293 and NG 108-15 cells, T-type whole-cell patch clamp recordings were performed 2–3 days after transfection as described earlier (7Chemin J. Monteil A. Perez-Reyes E. Bourinet E. Nargeot J. Lory P. Specific contribution of human T-type calcium channel isotypes (α1G, α1H and α1I) to neuronal excitability.J. Physiol. 2002; 540: 3-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). T-type currents were recorded using 2 mm Ca2+ at room temperature using a test pulse to −30 mV from a holding potential at −100 mV or a ramp stimulus protocol ranging from −100 to +100 mV over 200 ms. The current density was calculated according to the capacitance of the cell and expressed in pA/picofarad. Extracellular solution contained 2 mm CaCl2, 160 mm TEACl, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4 with TEAOH). Pipettes (2–3 MΩ) were filled with a solution containing 110 mm CsCl, 10 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES, 3 mm Mg-ATP, and 0.6 mm GTP (pH 7.2 with CsOH). Detailed acquisition and analysis procedures can be found elsewhere (7Chemin J. Monteil A. Perez-Reyes E. Bourinet E. Nargeot J. Lory P. Specific contribution of human T-type calcium channel isotypes (α1G, α1H and α1I) to neuronal excitability.J. Physiol. 2002; 540: 3-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Slices were perfused (2.5 ml/min) continuously with oxygenated artificial cerebrospinal fluid recording solution containing 2 mm Ca2+ at room temperature. Using the patch clamp technique (Axopatch 200B amplifier, Clampex 10, Molecular Devices), whole-cell recordings in current or voltage clamp mode were performed in VB and NRT neurons visualized with an Olympus BX51WI (×60 lens). Infected neurons were identified on the basis of their GFP fluorescence. Recordings were filtered by a four-pole Bessel filter set at a corner frequency of 2 kHz, digitalized at 10 kHz, and later analyzed using Clampfit10 (Molecular Devices) and Igor 6 (Wavemetrics). For current clamp recordings, the electrodes (borosilicate glass capillaries; World Precision Instruments) were filled with the following solution: 140 mm K-MeSO4, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES, 4 mm Na-ATP, 15 mm phosphocreatine, and 50 units/ml creatine phosphokinase (pH 7.3, osmolarity 290 mOsm). For voltage clamp recording electrodes were filled with 110 mm CsCl, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm EGTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 4 mm Na-ATP, 0.6 mm Na-GTP, 15 mm phosphocreatine, and 150 units/ml creatine phosphokinase (pH 7.3 with CsOH, osmolarity 280 mOsm) (tip resistances, 1.5–2.2 MΩ; access resistance, <5 MΩ). At least 80% of the cell capacitance and series resistance were compensated. To isolate Ca2+ currents, the following were added to the extracellular solution: 10 mm TEACl (Sigma), 1 mm 4-aminopyridine (Sigma), 0.5 μm tetrodotoxin (Tocris), and 2 mm CsCl (Sigma). Glutamatergic (50 μm dl-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid and 10 μm 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione) and GABAergic (3 μm SR-95531) receptor antagonists (Tocris) were added to the perfusion medium to block the spontaneous synaptic activities. Leak currents were subtracted off line using templates constructed from the current induced by a 10-mV hyperpolarizing step applied from −100 mV at the end of each recording. Activation current-voltage (I-V) curves were constructed from the currents obtained by successive depolarization steps ranging from −80 to −40 mV with 2.5-mV increments preceded by a 1-s-long hyperpolarizing period to −100 mV. Each curve was fitted with a modified Boltzmann equation: Imax = G(V + 30)/[1 + exp((V1/2 − V)/k)] where G is maximal conductance, V is membrane potential, V1/2 is potential of half-activation, and k is the slope. Steady-state I-V curves were constructed from the maximal current amplitude evoked at −50 mV following a 1-s-long hyperpolarization ranging from −110 to −60 mV with 5-mV increments. Curves were fitted with a modified Boltzmann equation: I/Imax = 1/[1 + exp((V − V1/2)/k)]. Surface expression measurement was performed using luminometry-ELISA analysis as described previously (15Vitko I. Bidaud I. Arias J.M. Mezghrani A. Lory P. Perez-Reyes E.

Neurosci. 2008; 28: 4501-4511Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Briefly, 40 h following transfection, cells were fixed for 5 min in 4% paraformaldehyde followed by two washes in PBS. The surface expression was measured in non-permeabilized cells, and total expression was measured after Triton X-100 (0.1%) permeabilization. The expression of HA-tagged channels was measured using rat anti-HA (3F10, Roche Applied Science; 1:1000) and secondary goat anti-rat antibody coupled to horseradish peroxidase (1:5000). After extensive washes in PBS, SuperSignal substrate (Femto, Pierce) was added, and luminescence was measured (Victor 2 luminometer). The percentage of surface expression corresponds to the ratio of surface/total relative light unit values. Western blotting and immunoprecipitation experiments were performed as described previously (19Mezghrani A. Monteil A. Watschinger K. Sinnegger-Brauns M.J. Barrère C. Bourinet E. Nargeot J.

Neurosci. 2008; 28: 4501-4511Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Briefly, 48 h after transfection, HEK-293 cells were lysed with Nonidet P-40 buffer and a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science), and lysates were spun at 10,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Protein content of the supernatant was determined using the BCA Protein Assay kit (Pierce), and 60 μg of proteins was loaded for SDS-PAGE. Proteins were then transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes and blocked with 5% powdered nonfat milk. Primary antibodies used to detect HA-tagged Cav3.2 protein (the rat 3F10 monoclonal antibody or anti-Cav3.2 (sc-16263, Santa Cruz Biotechnology)) or the GFP constructs (rabbit anti-enhanced GFP, Cliniscience) were incubated for 1 h at room temperature in PBS and 0.05% Tween buffer. After two washes, secondary HRP-coupled antibodies were incubated for 1 h in PBS and 0.05% Tween buffer. The signal was detected using the SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent system (Pierce). For immunoprecipitation, cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40 buffer and a mixture of protease inhibitors supplemented with 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide for 30 min on ice. Clarified cell lysates were then incubated with anti-HA- or anti-GFP-conjugated magnetic beads (Sigma) or anti-enhanced GFP antibodies for 4 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed four times with lysis buffer and resuspended in 4× loading buffer, and the immunoprecipitates were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Data are presented as mean ± S.E. The n values indicated in the histogram bars indicate the number of recorded cells. Statistical significance was determined using either Student’s unpaired t test or one-way analysis of variance with Dunnett’s correction for multiple comparisons with * indicating p < 0.05, ** indicating p < 0.01, and *** indicating p < 0.001. Whole cell patch clamp recordings using heterologous expression of the full-length wild-type Cav3.2 channel in HEK-293 cells was used to identify regions of the Cav3.2 protein able to modulate Cav3.2 channel activity. In a previous study (19Mezghrani A. Monteil A. Watschinger K. Sinnegger-Brauns M.J. Barrère C. Bourinet E. Nargeot J. Striessnig J. Lory P. A destructive interaction mechanism accounts for dominant-negative effects of misfolded mutants of voltage-gated calcium channels.J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 4501-4511Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), we had described that co-expression of a truncated form of the Cav3.2 channel protein comprising domains I and II produced a dominant-negative effect on the wild-type Cav3.2 channels, leading to degradation of the full-length Cav3.2 protein and silencing of the corresponding T-type current. Fig. 1A shows that silencing of the Cav3.2 current was obtained with truncated Cav3.2 proteins that contain domain I (D1), domain II (D2), or the I-II loop (L12). The latter is responsible for a ∼ 5-fold decrease in T-type current density (n = 30, p < 0.001; Fig. 1A). On the contrary, no change in T-type current density was observed when the full-length Cav3.2 channels were coexpressed with the domain III-IV distal part of the protein (D34) or with the N-terminal region (Nter), the loop between domains II and III (L23), the loop between domains III and IV (L34), and the C-terminal region (p > 0.05; Fig. 1A). Significant inhibition of the Cav3.2 T-type current was obtained with various L12 constructs (375-amino acid, GFP fusion, and internal ribosome entry site GFP constructs) as well as with shorter fragments of the I-II loop (Fig. 1B) designed as illustrated in Fig. 2A. Indeed, significant T-type current inhibition was obtained with a construct containing the first 119 amino acids, named Δ1 (Ser423–Pro542), enabling us to identify a given domain involved in this L12 inhibition of Cav3.2 T-type current. Importantly, inhibition of the current amplitude was not accompanied with a change in kinetics (Fig. 2B) or in the current-voltage relationship recorded using a ramp protocol (Fig. 2C) of the remaining Cav3.2 current.FIGURE 2Design of short (Δ) I-II loop constructs and representative electrophysiological properties of the Δ1 construct. A, the amino acid sequences of the Δ1–Δ7 constructs were identified according to the human Cav3.2 protein entry in the UniProt database (O95180): Δ1 (Ser423–Pro542), Δ2 (Ser423–His521), Δ3 (Ser423–Pro501), Δ4 (Ser423–Ala481), Δ5 (Ser452–Pro544), Δ6 (Val472–Pro544), and Δ7 (Asp493–Pro544). These constructs are compared in this multiple alignment with the Cav3.2 deletion mutants (D1–D4) used in Vitko et al. (15Vitko I. Bidaud I. Arias J.M. Mezghrani A. Lory P. Perez-Reyes E.

The traces were normalized in amplitude (inset), which revealed no difference in the activation and inactivation kinetics of the residual Cav3.2 current in cells expressing the Δ1 construct.

As reported previously, ∼15% of the total HA-tagged Cav3.2 protein is present at the cell surface (see Ref. 15Vitko I. Bidaud I. Arias J.M. Mezghrani A. Lory P. Perez-Reyes E. The I-II loop controls plasma membrane expression and gating of Cav3.2 T-type Ca2+ channels: a paradigm for childhood absence epilepsy mutations.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 322-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), and no change in surface expression of the HA-tagged Cav3.2 protein could be observed when coexpressed with either L12 or Nter GFP-fused construct (Fig. 3, A and B). To identify any change in the total amount of Cav3.2 protein, Western blotting was performed (Fig. 3, C and D). These experiments revealed that a similar amount of Cav3.2 protein was detected in the presence of GFP-L12 construct compared with GFP alone (Fig. 3C) and similarly when the experiments were conducted with the GFP-Nter construct (Fig. 3D). Whether the I-II loop could interact with the full-length Cav3.2 protein was further investigated using co-immunoprecipitation experiments (Fig. 3, E and F). When the HA-tagged Cav3.2 protein was coexpressed with the GFP-L12 construct, the presence of the latter was detected following immunoprecipitation of the HA-tagged Cav3.2 protein (Fig. 3E, arrow), indicating that the I-II loop can form a protein complex with the full-length Cav3.2 protein. On the contrary, no such protein interaction could be detected when the HA-Cav3.2 protein was coexpressed with the GFP-Nter construct (Fig. 3F). Considering that the I-II loop sequence of the Cav3.2 protein shares some similarities with other T-type/Cav3 channels, we also investigated its ability to inhibit Cav"

Contraindicated co-medication was defined as prescription periods of statins and contraindicated drugs overlapping by at least one day. Co-medication patterns were classified into 3 categories as follows: co-medication in the same prescription, co-medication by the same medical institution, and co-medication by different medical institutions. The proportion of co-medication was analyzed by age, gender, co-morbidities, and the statin's generic name.A total of 2,119,401 patients received CYP3A4-metabolized statins and 60,254 (2.84%) patients were co-medicated with contraindicated drugs. The proportion of co-medication was 4.6%, 2.2%, and 1.8% in simvastatin, lovastatin, and atorvastatin users, respectively. The most frequent combination was atorvastatin-itraconazole, followed by simvastatin-clarithromycin and simvastatin-itraconazole. Among the co-medicated patients, 85.3% were prescribed two drugs by different medical institutions.The proportion of co-medication of statins with contraindicated drugs was relatively lower than that of previous studies; however, the co-medication occurring by different medical institutions was not managed appropriately. There is a need to develop an effective system and to conduct outcomes research confirming the association between co-medication and the risk of unfavorable clinical outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2318668650,"We study the interplay between correlations, dynamics, and networks for repeated attacks on a socio-economic network. As a model system we consider an insurance scheme against disasters that randomly hit nodes, where a node in need receives support from its network neighbors. The model is motivated by gift giving among the Maasai called Osotua. Survival of nodes under different disaster scenarios (uncorrelated, spatially, temporally and spatio-temporally correlated) and for different network architectures are studied with agent-based numerical simulations. We find that the survival rate of a node depends dramatically on the type of correlation of the disasters: Spatially and spatio-temporally correlated disasters increase the survival rate; purely temporally correlated disasters decrease it. The type of correlation also leads to strong inequality among the surviving nodes. We introduce the concept of disaster masking to explain some of the results of our simulations. We also analyze the subsets of the networks that were activated to provide support after fifty years of random disasters. They show qualitative differences for the different disaster scenarios measured by path length, degree, clustering coefficient, and number of cycles."
https://openalex.org/W2318813352,"Self-Medication (SM), i.e. using medications to treat oneself, is a major concern for health researchers and policy makers. The terms ""self medication"" or ""self-medication"" (SM terms) have been used to explain various concepts while several terms have also been employed to define this practice. Hence, retrieving relevant publications would require exhaustive literature screening. So, we assessed the current situation of SM terms in the literature to improve the relevancy of search outcomes.In this Systematic exploration, SM terms were searched in the 6 following databases and publisher's portals till April 2012: Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed, Google scholar, ScienceDirect, and Wiley. A simple search query was used to include only publications with SM terms. We used Relative-Risk (RR) to estimate the probability of SM terms use in related compared to unrelated publications. Sensitivity and specificity of SM terms as keywords in search query were also calculated. Relevant terms to SM practice were extracted and their Likelihood Ratio positive and negative (LR+/-) were calculated to assess their effect on the probability of search outcomes relevancy in addition to previous search queries. We also evaluated the content of unrelated publications. All mentioned steps were performed in title (TI) and title or abstract (TIAB) of publications.1999 related and 1917 unrelated publications were found. SM terms RR was 4.5 in TI and 2.1 in TIAB. SM terms sensitivity and specificity respectively were 55.4% and 87.7% in TI and 84.0% and 59.5% in TIAB. ""OTC"" and ""Over-The-Counter Medication"", with LR+ 16.78 and 16.30 respectively, provided the most conclusive increase in the probability of the relevancy of publications. The most common unrelated SM themes were self-medication hypothesis, drug abuse and Zoopharmacognosy.Due to relatively low specificity or sensitivity of SM terms, relevant terms should be employed in search queries and clear definitions of SM applications should be applied to improve the relevancy of publications."
https://openalex.org/W1995734661,"Many different neurotransmitters and hormones control intracellular signaling by regulating the production of the second messenger cAMP. The function of the broadly expressed adenylyl cyclases (ACs) 5 and 6 is regulated by either stimulatory or inhibitory G proteins. By analyzing a well-known rebound stimulation phenomenon after withdrawal of Gi protein in atrial myocytes, we discovered that AC5 and -6 are tightly regulated by the second messenger PIP3. By monitoring cAMP levels in real time by means of Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based biosensors, we reproduced the rebound stimulation in a heterologous expression system specifically for AC5 or -6. Strikingly, this cAMP rebound stimulation was completely blocked by the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin, both in atrial myocytes and in transfected human embryonic kidney cells. Similar effects were observed by heterologous expression of the PIP3 phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN). However, general kinase inhibitors or inhibitors of Akt had no effect, suggesting a PIP3-dependent mechanism. These findings demonstrate the existence of a novel general pathway for regulation of AC5 and -6 activity via PIP3 that leads to pronounced alterations of cytosolic cAMP levels."
