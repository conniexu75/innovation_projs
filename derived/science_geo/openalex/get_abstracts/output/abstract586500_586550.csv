https://openalex.org/W2564852207,"Laser cooling and trapping of atoms and atomic ions has led to numerous advances including the observation of exotic phases of matter, development of exquisite sensors and state-of-the-art atomic clocks. The same level of control in molecules could also lead to profound developments such as controlled chemical reactions and sensitive probes of fundamental theories, but the vibrational and rotational degrees of freedom in molecules pose a formidable challenge for controlling their quantum mechanical states. Here, we use quantum-logic spectroscopy (QLS) for preparation and nondestructive detection of quantum mechanical states in molecular ions. We develop a general technique to enable optical pumping and preparation of the molecule into a pure initial state. This allows for the observation of high-resolution spectra in a single ion (here CaH+) and coherent phenomena such as Rabi flopping and Ramsey fringes. The protocol requires a single, far-off resonant laser, which is not specific to the molecule, so that many other molecular ions, including polyatomic species, could be treated with the same methods in the same apparatus by changing the molecular source. Combined with long interrogation times afforded by ion traps, a broad range of molecular ions could be studied with unprecedented control and precision, representing a critical step towards proposed applications, such as precision molecular spectroscopy, stringent tests of fundamental physics, quantum computing, and precision control of molecular dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W2612430951,"Recent advancement in electrocorticography (ECoG)-based brain-computer interface technology has sparked a new interest in providing somatosensory feedback using ECoG electrodes, i.e., cortical surface electrodes. We conducted a 28-day study of cortical surface stimulation in an individual with arm paralysis due to brachial plexus injury to examine the sensation produced by electrical stimulation of the somatosensory cortex. A high-density ECoG grid was implanted over the somatosensory and motor cortices. Stimulation through cortical surface electrodes over the somatosensory cortex successfully elicited arm and hand sensations in our participant with chronic paralysis. There were three key findings. First, the intensity of perceived sensation increased monotonically with both pulse amplitude and pulse frequency. Second, changing pulse width changed the type of sensation based on qualitative description provided by the human participant. Third, the participant could distinguish between stimulation applied to two neighboring cortical surface electrodes, 4.5 mm center-to-center distance, for three out of seven electrode pairs tested. Taken together, we found that it was possible to modulate sensation intensity, sensation type, and evoke sensations across a range of locations from the fingers to the upper arm using different stimulation electrodes even in an individual with chronic impairment of somatosensory function. These three features are essential to provide effective somatosensory feedback for neuroprosthetic applications."

Automated differentiation of abnormal gait from normal gait can serve as a potential tool for early diagnosis as well as monitoring the effect of PD treatment. The aim of current study is to differentiate PD patients from healthy controls, on the basis of features derived from plantar vertical ground reaction force (VGRF) data during walking at normal pace. The current work presents a comprehensive study highlighting the efficacy of different machine learning classifiers towards devising an accurate prediction system. Selection of meaningful feature based on sequential forward feature selection, the swing time, stride time variability, and center of pressure features facilitated successful classification of control and PD gaits. Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), random forest, and decision trees classifiers were used to build the prediction model. We found that SVM with cubic kernel outperformed other classifiers with an accuracy of 93.6%, the sensitivity of 93.1%, and specificity of 94.1%. In comparison to other studies, utilizing same dataset, our designed prediction system improved the classification performance by approximately 10%. The results of the current study underscore the ability of the VGRF data obtained non-invasively from wearable devices, in combination with a SVM classifier trained on meticulously selected features, as a tool for diagnosis of PD and monitoring effectiveness of therapy post pathology."
https://openalex.org/W2613482252,"Clinical experience teaches us that patients are willing to accept postoperative pain, despite high pain intensity scores. Nevertheless, relationships between pain scores and other methods of pain assessment, e.g. acceptability of pain or its interference with physical functioning, are not fully established. Our aims were to examine these relationships.A cross-sectional study was conducted on patients who underwent major surgery between January 2008 and August 2013. Using logistic regression, we quantified the relationships between movement-evoked pain scores on the numerical rating scale (NRS-MEP) and three dichotomous dependent variables: patient's opinion on acceptability of pain (PO: acceptable or unacceptable pain); nurses' observation of patient's performance of necessary activities to expedite recovery (NO: good or bad performance); a compound measure judging the presence of the clinically desirable situation of acceptable pain associated with good patients' performance (PONO: present or not). Using Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) analysis, NRS cut-off points were determined such that they best discriminate between patients having one versus the other outcome for PO, NO and PONO.15,394 assessments were obtained in 9,082 patients in the first three postoperative days. Nine percent of the patients had unacceptable pain while having an NRS-MEP of 0-4. An estimated 47% (95%CI = 45%-49%) of patients with an NRS-MEP of 7 described their pain as acceptable on day one. Moreover, 33% (31%-35%) performed all required physical activities, and 22% (21%-24%) combined acceptable pain with appropriate movement. NRS cut-off points for PO, NO and PONO were five, four and four, respectively, but had insufficient discriminatory power.Our results suggest pain management should be guided by the many dimensions of the patient's pain experience, not solely by NRS cut-off points. Future research should evaluate the impact of such multidimensional pain assessment on patients' functional outcome."
https://openalex.org/W2612644689,"Forkhead box O (FOXO) functions as the terminal transcription factor of the insulin signaling pathway and regulates multiple physiological processes in many organisms, including lifespan in insects. However, how FOXO interacts with hormone signaling to modulate insect growth and development is largely unknown. Here, using the transgene-based CRISPR/Cas9 system, we generated and characterized mutants of the silkworm Bombyx mori FOXO (BmFOXO) to elucidate its physiological functions during development of this lepidopteran insect. The BmFOXO mutant (FOXO-M) exhibited growth delays from the first larval stage and showed precocious metamorphosis, pupating at the end of the fourth instar (trimolter) rather than at the end of the fifth instar as in the wild-type (WT) animals. However, different from previous reports on precocious metamorphosis caused by juvenile hormone (JH) deficiency in silkworm mutants, the total developmental time of the larval period in the FOXO-M was comparable with that of the WT. Exogenous application of 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) or of the JH analog rescued the trimolter phenotype. RNA-seq and gene expression analyses indicated that genes involved in JH degradation but not in JH biosynthesis were up-regulated in the FOXO-M compared with the WT animals. Moreover, we identified several FOXO-binding sites in the promoter of genes coding for JH-degradation enzymes. These results suggest that FOXO regulates JH degradation rather than its biosynthesis, which further modulates hormone homeostasis to control growth and development in B. mori. In conclusion, we have uncovered a pivotal role for FOXO in regulating JH signaling to control insect development."
https://openalex.org/W2612213931,"Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) can be differentiated into cardiomyocytes and represent a possible autologous cell source for myocardial repair. We analyzed the engraftment and functional effects of murine iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) in a murine model of myocardial infarction.To maximize cardiomyocyte yield and purity a genetic purification protocol was applied. Murine iPSCs were genetically modified to express a Zeocin™ resistance gene under control of the cardiac-specific α-myosin heavy chain (α-MHC, MYH6) promoter. Thus, CM selection was performed during in vitro differentiation. iPSC-CM aggregates (""cardiac bodies"", CBs) were transplanted on day 14 after LAD ligation into the hearts of previously LAD-ligated mice (800 CBs/animal; 2-3x106 CMs). Animals were treated with placebo (PBS, n = 14) or iPSC-CMs (n = 35). Myocardial remodeling and function were evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), conductance catheter (CC) analysis and histological morphometry. In vitro and in vivo differentiation was investigated. Follow up was 28 days (including histological assessment and functional analysis). iPSC-CM purity was >99%. Transplanted iPSC-CMs formed mature grafts within the myocardium, expressed cardiac markers and exhibited sarcomeric structures. Intramyocardial transplantation of iPSC-CMs significantly improved myocardial remodeling and left ventricular function 28 days after LAD-ligation.We conclude that iPSCs can effectively be differentiated into cardiomyocytes and genetically enriched to high purity. iPSC derived cardiomyocytes engraft within the myocardium of LAD-ligated mice and contribute to improve left ventricular function."
https://openalex.org/W2612410547,"Background The majority of studies investigating stress in primary care have focused either on general practitioners (GPs) or practice assistants (PAs), but did not measure stress on a practice level. We analyzed the prevalence of chronic stress for both professional groups and on a practice level and investigated personal, practice, and regional characteristics. Methods Chronic stress was measured in GPs and PAs from 136 German practices using the standardized, self-administered TICS-SSCS questionnaire (12 items). Based on a sum-score, participants per professional group were categorized as having low or high strain due to chronic stress (≤ 25th and ≥ 75th percentile of the study population´s distribution, respectively). For a cluster-level analysis, the mean of all practice means was used to categorize low- and high-stress practices. The intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) was calculated using ANOVA. Prevalence Ratios (PR) were used to compare low versus high strain due to stress, stratified for personal, practice and regional characteristics. Results The response rate was 74.1% (n = 137/185). Data from 214 GPs (34.1% female), 500 PAs (99.4% female), and 50 PAs in training (98.0% female) were analyzed. Chronic stress was highest in female GPs (median 19, IQR (interquartile range) 11.5), followed by PAs (16, IQR 12.25) and male GPs (15, IQR 10). On a practice level, 26.3% of the practice personnel reported a high stress level. We observed an overall ICC of 0.25, with higher ICCs when stratifying by professional group (PAs: ICC 0.36, GPs in group practices: ICC 0.51). High chronic stress was observed as the number of working hours per week increased (GPs: PR 2.03, 95% CI 1.16–3.56; PAs: PR 2.02, 95% CI 1.22–3.35). There were no differences for practice type (solo/group) and the various regional characteristics. Conclusion Personal and practice characteristics were associated with chronic stress in GPs, PAs, and on a practice level. The high ICCs indicate a need for stress-reduction strategies geared at both professions on a practice level."
https://openalex.org/W2612266320,"Objective Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation in de novo patients with Celiac Disease previously revealed an imbalance in the excitability of cortical facilitatory and inhibitory circuits. After a median period of 16 months of gluten-free diet, a global increase of cortical excitability was reported, suggesting a glutamate-mediated compensation for disease progression. We have now evaluated cross-sectionally the changes of cortical excitability to TMS after a much longer gluten-free diet. Methods Twenty patients on adequate gluten-free diet for a mean period of 8.35 years were enrolled and compared with 20 de novo patients and 20 healthy controls. Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation measures, recorded from the first dorsal interosseous muscle of the dominant hand, consisted of: resting motor threshold, cortical silent period, motor evoked potentials, central motor conduction time, mean short-latency intracortical inhibition and intracortical facilitation. Results The cortical silent period was shorter in de novo patients, whereas in gluten-free diet participants it was similar to controls. The amplitude of motor responses was significantly smaller in all patients than in controls, regardless of the dietary regimen. Notwithstanding the diet, all patients exhibited a statistically significant decrease of mean short-latency intracortical inhibition and enhancement of intracortical facilitation with respect to controls; more intracortical facilitation in gluten-restricted compared to non-restricted patients was also observed. Neurological examination and celiac disease-related antibodies were negative. Conclusions In this new investigation, the length of dietary regimen was able to modulate the electrocortical changes in celiac disease. Nevertheless, an intracortical synaptic dysfunction, mostly involving excitatory and inhibitory interneurons within the motor cortex, may persist. The clinical significance of subtle neurophysiological changes in celiac disease needs to be further investigated."
https://openalex.org/W2612680923,"Optimizing outcome in biliary atresia (BA) requires timely diagnosis. Cholestasis is a presenting feature of BA, as well as other diagnoses (Non-BA). Identification of clinical features of neonatal cholestasis that would expedite decisions to pursue subsequent invasive testing to correctly diagnose or exclude BA would enhance outcomes. The analytical goal was to develop a predictive model for BA using data available at initial presentation.Infants at presentation with neonatal cholestasis (direct/conjugated bilirubin >2 mg/dl [34.2 μM]) were enrolled prior to surgical exploration in a prospective observational multi-centered study (PROBE-NCT00061828). Clinical features (physical findings, laboratory results, gallbladder sonography) at enrollment were analyzed. Initially, 19 features were selected as candidate predictors. Two approaches were used to build models for diagnosis prediction: a hierarchical classification and regression decision tree (CART) and a logistic regression model using a stepwise selection strategy.In PROBE April 2004-February 2014, 401 infants met criteria for BA and 259 for Non-BA. Univariate analysis identified 13 features that were significantly different between BA and Non-BA. Using a CART predictive model of BA versus Non-BA (significant factors: gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, acholic stools, weight), the receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (ROC AUC) was 0.83. Twelve percent of BA infants were misclassified as Non-BA; 17% of Non-BA infants were misclassified as BA. Stepwise logistic regression identified seven factors in a predictive model (ROC AUC 0.89). Using this model, a predicted probability of >0.8 (n = 357) yielded an 81% true positive rate for BA; <0.2 (n = 120) yielded an 11% false negative rate.Despite the relatively good accuracy of our optimized prediction models, the high precision required for differentiating BA from Non-BA was not achieved. Accurate identification of BA in infants with neonatal cholestasis requires further evaluation, and BA should not be excluded based only on presenting clinical features."
https://openalex.org/W2612620841,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate gene expression during the peri-implantation period. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether genetic polymorphisms in the four miRNAs associated with fetal or placental development play roles in the development of idiopathic recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) in Korean females.A case-control study involving 225 controls and 387 women with at least two consecutively recurrent pregnancy losses between 1999 and 2012 was performed. The genotypes of the four miRNA polymorphisms, including miR-27a rs895819, miR-423 rs6505162, miR-449b rs10061133, and miR-605 rs2043556, were analyzed by the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism assay. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were estimated using multivariate analyses after maternal age adjustments. The relationships between each of the four microRNA genotypes and each of the six clinical parameters of the RPL patients (plasma homocysteine and folate levels, natural killer cell number, platelet count, prothrombin time, and, activated partial thromboplastin time) were analyzed using multiple linear regression analyses.Our results suggest that weak associations between decreased RPL risk and the genotypes of miR-27a (AG and AG+GG), combination genotype of miR-27a/miR-423 (AG/GC), and haplotypes of miR-27a/miR-423/miR-449b/miR-605 (G-C-A-G) and miR-27a/miR-449b/miR-605 (G-A-G), whereas weak associations between increased RPL risk and genotypes of miR-449b (GG and AG+GG), combination genotypes of miR-423/miR-449b (CC/GG and CA/AG), miR-449b/miR-605 (AG/AG), haplotypes of miR-27a/miR-423/miR-449b/miR-605 (A-C-G-A, A-A-A-G, and G-C-G-G), miR-27a/miR-423/miR-449b (A-C-G), miR-27a/miR-449b/miR-605 (A-A-G, A-G-A, and G-G-G), miR-423/miR-449b/miR-605 (C-G-G and A-A-G), and miR-423/miR-449b (C-G and A-A). The genotypes of miR-27a (AG and AG+GG) also showed significant contributions to the prediction of folate levels in RPL patients.The study showed associations between miRNA polymorphisms (miR-27a rs895819 and miR-449b rs10061133) and RPL development, and between the miRNA polymorphism (miR-27a rs895819) and plasma folate levels."
https://openalex.org/W2612215954,"Background The indoor residual spraying programme for malaria vectors control was implemented in four districts of the Lake Victoria basin of Tanzania namely Ukerewe, Sengerema, Rorya andSerengeti. Entomological monitoring activities were implemented in one sentinel village in each district to evaluate the efficacy of pirimiphos-methyl 300 CS sprayed on different wall surfaces and its impact against malaria vectors post-IRS intervention. Methods The residual decay rate of p-methyl 300 CS applied at a target dosage of 1g a.i./m2 on thesprayed wall surfaces was monitored for a period of 43 weeks post-IRSusing the WHO cone wall bioassay method. The bioassays were performed by exposing 2–5 days old unfed susceptible female Anopheles gambiae s.s. (Kisumu strain) to sprayed wall surfaces for a period of 30 minutes. In each sentinel village, mosquito collection was carried out by trained community mosquito collectors. Monthly mosquito collections were carried out from 6.00pm to 6.00am using CDC light traps and clay pot methods for indoors host seekingand outdoors resting mosquitoes respectively. Six traps (2 CDC light traps and 4 clay pots) were set per sentinel village per night for28 consecutive days in a moon. PCR and ELISA were used for mosquito species identification and sporozoite detection, respectively. Results Based on the WHOPES recommendation, insecticides should have a minimum efficacy of ≥ 80% mosquito mortality at 24 hours post exposure on the sprayed wall surfaces to be considered effective. In this study, p-methyl 300 CS was demonstrated to have a long residual efficacy of 21–43 weeks post-IRS on mud, cement, painted and wood wall surfaces. Numberof anopheline mosquitoes decreased post-IRS interventions in all sentinel villages. The highest numbers ofanopheline mosquitoes were collected in November-December, 38–43 weeks post-IRS. A total of 270 female anopheline mosquitoes were analyzed by PCR; out of which 236 (87.4%) were An. gambiae s.l. and 34 (12.6%) were An. funestus group. Of the 236 An. gambiae s.l.identified 12.6% (n = 34) were An. gambiae s.s. and 68.6% (n = 162) were An. arabiensis. Ofthe 34 An. funestus group indentified 91.2% (n = 31) were An. parensis and 8.8% (n = 3) were An. rivulorum. The overall Plasmodium falciparum sporozoite rate was 0.7% (n = 2,098). Conclusions Pirimiphos-methyl 300 CS was found to be effective for IRS in the Lake Victoria basin,Tanzania. P-methyl 300 CShas a long residual efficacy on sprayed wall surfaces and therefore it is effective in controlling principal malaria vectors of An. gambiae s.l and An. funestus which rest on wall surfaces after and before feeding."
https://openalex.org/W2612228800,"Platinum drug-induced cross-link repair requires the concerted activities of translesion synthesis (TLS), Fanconi anemia (FA), and homologous recombination repair pathways. The E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme RAD6 is essential for TLS. Here, we show that RAD6 plays a universal role in platinum-based drug tolerance. Using a novel RAD6-selective small-molecule inhibitor (SMI#9) targeting the RAD6 catalytic site, we demonstrate that SMI#9 potentiates the sensitivities of cancer cells with innate or acquired cisplatin or oxaliplatin resistance. 5-Iododeoxyuridine/5-chlorodeoxyuridine pulse-labeling experiments showed that RAD6 is necessary for overcoming cisplatin-induced replication fork stalling, as replication-restart was impaired in both SMI#9-pretreated and RAD6B-silenced cells. Consistent with the role of RAD6/TLS in late-S phase, SMI#9-induced DNA replication inhibition occurred preferentially in mid/late-S phase. The compromised DNA repair and chemosensitization induced by SMI#9 or RAD6B depletion were associated with decreased platinum drug-induced proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and FANCD2 monoubiquitinations (surrogate markers of TLS and FA pathway activation, respectively) and with attenuated FANCD2, RAD6, γH2AX, and POL η foci formation and cisplatin-adduct removal. SMI#9 pretreatment synergistically increased cisplatin inhibition of MDA-MB-231 triple-negative breast cancer cell proliferation and tumor growth. Using an isogenic HCT116 colon cancer model of oxaliplatin resistance, we further show that γH2AX and monoubiquitinated PCNA and FANCD2 are constitutively up-regulated in oxaliplatin-resistant HCT116 (HCT116-OxR) cells and that γH2AX, PCNA, and FANCD2 monoubiquitinations are induced by oxaliplatin in parental HCT116 cells. SMI#9 pretreatment sensitized HCT116-OxR cells to oxaliplatin. These data deepen insights into the vital role of RAD6/TLS in platinum drug tolerance and reveal clinical benefits of targeting RAD6 with SMI#9 for managing chemoresistant cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2612374370,"Diabetic complications are characterized by the dysfunction of pericytes located around microvascular endothelial cells. The blood–brain barrier (BBB) exhibits hyperpermeability with progression of diabetes. Therefore, brain pericytes at the BBB may be involved in diabetic complications of the central nervous system (CNS). We hypothesized that brain pericytes respond to increased brain thrombin levels in diabetes, leading to BBB dysfunction and diabetic CNS complications. Mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for 2 or 8 weeks to induce obesity. Transport of i.v.-administered sodium fluorescein and 125I-thrombin across the BBB were measured. We evaluated brain endothelial permeability and expression of tight junction proteins in the presence of thrombin–treated brain pericytes using a BBB model of co-cultured rat brain endothelial cells and pericytes. Mice fed a HFD for 8 weeks showed both increased weight gain and impaired glucose tolerance. In parallel, the brain influx rate of sodium fluorescein was significantly greater than that in mice fed a normal diet. HFD feeding inhibited the decline in brain thrombin levels occurring during 6 weeks of feeding. In the HFD fed mice, plasma thrombin levels were significantly increased, by up to 22%. 125I-thrombin was transported across the BBB in normal mice after i.v. injection, with uptake further enhanced by co-injection of unlabeled thrombin. Thrombin-treated brain pericytes increased brain endothelial permeability and caused decreased expression of zona occludens-1 (ZO-1) and occludin and morphological disorganization of ZO-1. Thrombin also increased mRNA expression of interleukin-1β and 6 and tumor necrosis factor-α in brain pericytes. Thrombin can be transported from circulating blood through the BBB, maintaining constant levels in the brain, where it can stimulate pericytes to induce BBB dysfunction. Thus, the brain pericyte–thrombin interaction may play a key role in causing BBB dysfunction in obesity-associated diabetes and represent a therapeutic target for its CNS complications."
https://openalex.org/W2613386482,"Interferometric telescope observations of the Jovian moon Io reveal that the floor of the Loki Patera volcano has been resurfaced in two waves, with different starting times and velocities. Jupiter's moon Io has the biggest active volcano in the Solar System. Inside the volcano, a warm floor surrounds a cool central island. Previous observations have indicated that volcanic resurfacing occurs every one to three years, but telescope observations have insufficient resolution to see how this progresses, and spacecraft observations have not been able to see the entire floor at once. Katherine De Kleer et al. used an occultation of Io by another of Jupiter's moons (Europa) to map the entire floor at a spatial resolution of 2 kilometres, using interferometric telescope observations. They find that the resurfacing happens in two waves, with different starting times and velocities, which then converge around the central island. They interpret the differences between the waves as evidence of either a non-uniformity in the lava or variations in the bulk density of the crust across the volcano. The Jovian moon Io hosts the most powerful persistently active volcano in the Solar System, Loki Patera1,2. The interior of this volcanic, caldera-like feature is composed of a warm, dark floor covering 21,500 square kilometres3 surrounding a much cooler central ‘island’4. The temperature gradient seen across areas of the patera indicates a systematic resurfacing process4,5,6,7,8,9, which has been seen to occur typically every one to three years since the 1980s5,10. Analysis of past data has indicated that the resurfacing progressed around the patera in an anti-clockwise direction at a rate of one to two kilometres per day, and that it is caused either by episodic eruptions that emplace voluminous lava flows or by a cyclically overturning lava lake contained within the patera5,8,9,11. However, spacecraft and telescope observations have been unable to map the emission from the entire patera floor at sufficient spatial resolution to establish the physical processes at play. Here we report temperature and lava cooling age maps of the entire patera floor at a spatial sampling of about two kilometres, derived from ground-based interferometric imaging of thermal emission from Loki Patera obtained on 8 March 2015 ut as the limb of Europa occulted Io. Our results indicate that Loki Patera is resurfaced by a multi-phase process in which two waves propagate and converge around the central island. The different velocities and start times of the waves indicate a non-uniformity in the lava gas content and/or crust bulk density across the patera."

As a sensor, UGGT ensures that misfolded proteins are recognized by the lectin chaperones and do not leave the secretory pathway. The structure of UGGT and the mechanism of its selectivity for misfolded proteins have been unknown for 25 years. Here, we used negative-stain electron microscopy and small-angle X-ray scattering to determine the structure of UGGT from Drosophila melanogaster at 18-Å resolution. Three-dimensional reconstructions revealed a cage-like structure with a large central cavity. Particle classification revealed flexibility that precluded determination of a high-resolution structure. Introduction of biotinylation sites into a fungal UGGT expressed in Escherichia coli allowed identification of the catalytic and first thioredoxin-like domains. We also used hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry to map the binding site of an accessory protein, Sep15, to the first thioredoxin-like domain. The UGGT structural features identified suggest that the central cavity contains the catalytic site and is lined with hydrophobic surfaces. This enhances the binding of misfolded substrates with exposed hydrophobic residues and excludes folded proteins with hydrophilic surfaces.

https://openalex.org/W2612413758,"Cytochrome c oxidase (CcO) is the last electron acceptor in the respiratory chain. The CcO core is formed by mitochondrial DNA-encoded Cox1, Cox2, and Cox3 subunits. Cox1 synthesis is highly regulated; for example, if CcO assembly is blocked, Cox1 synthesis decreases. Mss51 activates translation of COX1 mRNA and interacts with Cox1 protein in high-molecular-weight complexes (COA complexes) to form the Cox1 intermediary assembly module. Thus, Mss51 coordinates both Cox1 synthesis and assembly. We previously reported that the last 15 residues of the Cox1 C terminus regulate Cox1 synthesis by modulating an interaction of Mss51 with Cox14, another component of the COA complexes. Here, using site-directed mutagenesis of the mitochondrial COX1 gene from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we demonstrate that mutations P521A/P522A and V524E disrupt the regulatory role of the Cox1 C terminus. These mutations, as well as C terminus deletion (Cox1ΔC15), reduced binding of Mss51 and Cox14 to COA complexes. Mss51 was enriched in a translationally active form that maintains full Cox1 synthesis even if CcO assembly is blocked in these mutants. Moreover, Cox1ΔC15, but not Cox1-P521A/P522A and Cox1-V524E, promoted formation of aberrant supercomplexes in CcO assembly mutants lacking Cox2 or Cox4 subunits. The aberrant supercomplex formation depended on the presence of cytochrome b and Cox3, supporting the idea that supercomplex assembly factors associate with Cox3 and demonstrating that supercomplexes can be formed even if CcO is inactive and not fully assembled.

Our results indicate that the Cox1 C-terminal end is a key regulator of CcO biogenesis and that it is important for supercomplex formation/stability."
https://openalex.org/W2613623169,"Backgrounds The association of dietary vitamin C (vit C) on periodontitis requires more valid evidence from large representative samples to enable sufficient adjustments. This study aimed to evaluate the association between dietary vit C intake and periodontitis after controlling for various confounders in the representative Korean adult population Method A total of 10,930 Korean adults (≥19 years) from the fourth Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data set were included in this cross-sectional study. Periodontitis was defined as community periodontal index score of 3 or 4. Dietary vit C intake was estimated from a 24-hour dietary record, and categorized into adequate and inadequate according to the Korean Estimated Average Requirement value. Potential confounders included age, sex, income, frequency of tooth brushing, use of floss, dental visit, drinking, smoking, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, and obesity. A multivariable logistic regression analysis and stratified analysis were applied. Results Those with inadequate dietary vit C intake were more likely by 1.16 times to have periodontitis than those with adequate dietary vit C intake (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.16, 95% confidence interval = 1.04–1.29). Lowest and middle-low quartile of dietary vit C intake, compared to highest quartile of dietary vit C intake, showed significant association (aOR = 1.28 and 1.22 respectively), which was in a biological-gradient relationship (trend-p <0.05). Conclusions Our data showed that inadequate dietary vit C intake was independently associated with periodontitis among Korean adults. Hence, adequate intake of dietary vitamin C could be substantially important on the promotion of periodontal health among Korean adults."

The present study aims to define HIV-1 subtype diversity patterns and investigate possible HIV-1 transmission networks within Australia. Methods The Australian Molecular Epidemiology Network (AMEN) HIV collaborating sites in Western Australia, South Australia, Victoria, Queensland and western Sydney (New South Wales), provided baseline HIV-1 partial pol sequence, age and gender information for 4,873 patients who had genotypes performed during 2005–2012. HIV-1 phylogenetic analyses utilised MEGA V6, with a stringent classification of transmission pairs or clusters (bootstrap ≥98%, genetic distance ≤1.5% from at least one other sequence in the cluster). Results HIV-1 subtype B represented 74.5% of the 4,873 sequences (WA 59%, SA 68.4%, w-Syd 73.8%, Vic 75.6%, Qld 82.1%), with similar proportion of transmission pairs and clusters found in the B and non-B cohorts (23% vs 24.5% of sequences, p = 0.3). Significantly more subtype B clusters were comprised of ≥3 sequences compared with non-B clusters (45.0% vs 24.0%, p = 0.021) and significantly more subtype B pairs and clusters were male-only (88% compared to 53% CRF01_AE and 17% subtype C clusters). Factors associated with being in a cluster of any size included; being sequenced in a more recent time period (p<0.001), being younger (p<0.001), being male (p = 0.023) and having a B subtype (p = 0.02). Being in a larger cluster (>3) was associated with being sequenced in a more recent time period (p = 0.05) and being male (p = 0.008). Conclusion This nationwide HIV-1 study of 4,873 patient sequences highlights the increased diversity of HIV-1 subtypes within the Australian epidemic, as well as differences in transmission networks associated with these HIV-1 subtypes. These findings provide epidemiological insights not readily available using standard surveillance methods and can inform the development of effective public health strategies in the current paradigm of HIV prevention in Australia."
https://openalex.org/W2612978630,"For over 15 years, human subcutaneous adipose tissue has been recognized as a rich source of tissue resident mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSC). The isolation of perivascular progenitor cells from human adipose tissue by a cell sorting strategy was first published in 2008. Since this time, the interest in using pericytes and related perivascular stem/stromal cell (PSC) populations for tissue engineering has significantly increased. Here, we describe a set of experiments identifying, isolating and characterizing PSC from canine tissue (N = 12 canine adipose tissue samples). Results showed that the same antibodies used for human PSC identification and isolation are cross-reactive with canine tissue (CD45, CD146, CD34). Like their human correlate, canine PSC demonstrate characteristics of MSC including cell surface marker expression, colony forming unit-fibroblast (CFU-F) inclusion, and osteogenic differentiation potential. As well, canine PSC respond to osteoinductive signals in a similar fashion as do human PSC, such as the secreted differentiation factor NEL-Like Molecule-1 (NELL-1). Nevertheless, important differences exist between human and canine PSC, including differences in baseline osteogenic potential. In summary, canine PSC represent a multipotent mesenchymogenic cell source for future translational efforts in tissue engineering."
https://openalex.org/W2614032291,"Bile acid (BA) signaling regulates fatty acid metabolism. BA dysregulation plays an important role in the development of metabolic disease. However, BAs in relation to fatty acids have not been fully investigated in obesity-related metabolic disorders. A targeted metabolomic measurement of serum BA and free fatty acid profiles was applied to sera of 381 individuals in 2 independent studies. The results showed that the ratio of dihomo-γ-linolenic acid (DGLA) to deoxycholic acid (DCA) species (DCAS) was significantly increased in obese individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) from a case-control study and decreased in the remission group of obese subjects with T2DM after metabolic surgery. The changes were closely associated with their metabolic status. These results were consistently confirmed in both serum and liver of mice with diet-induced obesity, implying that such a metabolic alteration in circulation reflects changes occurring in the liver. In vitro studies of human liver L-02 cell lines under BA treatment revealed that DCA and its conjugated form, TDCA, significantly inhibited mRNA expression of fatty acid transport protein 5 in the presence of DGLA, which was involved in hepatocyte DGLA uptake. Thus, the DGLA:DCAS ratio may be a promising biomarker for metabolic abnormalities in obesity.-Lei, S., Huang, F., Zhao, A., Chen, T., Chen, W., Xie, G., Zheng, X., Zhang, Y., Yu, H., Zhang, P., Rajani, C., Bao, Y., Jia, W., Jia, W. The ratio of dihomo-γ-linolenic acid to deoxycholic acid species is a potential biomarker for the metabolic abnormalities in obesity."
https://openalex.org/W2613590306,"Viral-bacterial co-infections are associated with severe exacerbations of COPD. Epithelial antimicrobial peptides, including human β-defensin-2 (HBD-2), are integral to innate host defenses. In this study, we examined how co-infection of airway epithelial cells with rhinovirus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa modulates HBD-2 expression, and whether these responses are attenuated by cigarette smoke and in epithelial cells obtained by bronchial brushings from smokers with normal lung function or from COPD patients. When human airway epithelial cells from normal lungs were infected with rhinovirus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, or the combination, co-infection with rhinovirus and bacteria resulted in synergistic induction of HBD-2 (p<0.05). The combination of virus and flagellin replicated this synergistic increase (p<0.05), and synergy was not seen using a flagella-deficient mutant Pseudomonas (p<0.05). The effects of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were mediated via interactions of flagellin with TLR5. The effects of HRV-16 depended upon viral replication but did not appear to be mediated via the intracellular RNA helicases, retinoic acid-inducible gene-I or melanoma differentiation-associated gene-5. Cigarette smoke extract significantly decreased HBD-2 production in response to co-infection. Attenuated production was also observed following co-infection of cells obtained from healthy smokers or COPD patients compared to healthy controls (p<0.05). We conclude that co-exposure to HRV-16 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa induces synergistic production of HBD-2 from epithelial cells and that this synergistic induction of HBD-2 is reduced in COPD patients. This may contribute to the more severe exacerbations these patients experience in response to viral-bacterial co-infections."
https://openalex.org/W2613821241,"Microbes often engage in cooperation through releasing biosynthetic compounds required by other species to grow. Given that production of costly biosynthetic metabolites is generally subjected to multiple layers of negative feedback, single mutations may frequently be insufficient to generate cooperative phenotypes. Synergistic epistatic interactions between multiple coordinated changes may thus often underlie the evolution of cooperation through overproduction of metabolites. To test the importance of synergistic mutations in cooperation we used an engineered bacterial consortium of an Escherichia coli methionine auxotroph and Salmonella enterica. S. enterica relies on carbon by-products from E. coli if lactose is the only carbon source. Directly selecting wild-type S. enterica in an environment that favored cooperation through secretion of methionine only once led to a methionine producer, and this producer both took a long time to emerge and was not very effective at cooperating. On the other hand, when an initial selection for resistance of S. enterica to a toxic methionine analog, ethionine, was used, subsequent selection for cooperation with E. coli was rapid, and the resulting double mutants were much more effective at cooperation. We found that potentiating mutations in metJ increase expression of metA, which encodes the first step of methionine biosynthesis. This increase in expression is required for the previously identified actualizing mutations in metA to generate cooperation. This work highlights that where biosynthesis of metabolites involves multiple layers of regulation, significant secretion of those metabolites may require multiple mutations, thereby constraining the evolution of cooperation."

During its life cycle, the formation of sclerotia helps Rhizoctonia solani withstand a variety of unfavorable factors. Oxidative stress is a key factor that induces sclerotium formation. The differentiated and undifferentiated phenotypes of R. solani AG-1-IA were obtained by controlling aerial conditions. Metabolomics based on the mass spectrometry technique combined with multivariate and univariate analyses was used to investigate the metabolic variation in vegetative, differentiated and undifferentiated mycelia. Our results revealed that during maturation, the metabolic levels of N2-acetyl-L-ornithine, 3,1'-(OH)2-Gamma-carotene, (5Z,7E)-(1S,3R)-24,24-difluoro-24a-homo-9,10-seco-5,7,10(19)-cholestatrien-1,3,25-triol, stoloniferone O, PA(O-18:0/12:0), PA(P-16:0/14:0), PA(P-16:0/16:(19Z)) and PA(P-16:0/17:2(9Z,12Z)) were suppressed in both differentiated and undifferentiated mycelia. The concentrations of PE(20:1(11Z)/14:1(9Z)), PE(P-16:0/20:4(5Z,8Z,11Z,13E)(15OH[S])) and PS(12:0/18:1(9Z)) were increased in the differentiated group, while increased levels of N(gamma)-nitro-L-arginine, tenuazonic acid and 9S,10S,11R-trihydroxy-12Z,15Z-octadecadienoic acid were found in the undifferentiated group. Our results suggest that different levels of these metabolites may act as biomarkers for the developmental stages of R. solani AG-1-IA. Moreover, the mechanisms of sclerotium formation and mycelium differentiation were elucidated at the metabolic level."
https://openalex.org/W2612236287,"Sublethal exposure to an insecticide may alter insect feeding, mating, oviposition, fecundity, development, and many other life history parameters. Such effects may have population-level consequences that are not apparent in traditional dose-mortality evaluations. Earlier, we found that a routinely used combination insecticide that includes a pyrethroid and a neonicotinoid (Temprid® SC) had deleterious effects on multiple bed bug (Cimex lectularius, L.) behaviors. Here, we demonstrate that sublethal exposure impacts physiology and reproduction as well. We report that sublethal exposure to Temprid SC has variable aberrant effects on bed bugs depending on the strain, including: a reduction in male mating success and delayed oviposition by females. However, after sublethal exposure, egg hatch rate consistently declined in every strain tested, anywhere from 34%-73%. Conversely, impact on fifth instar eclosion time was not significant. While the strains that we tested varied in their respective magnitude of sublethal effects, taken together, these effects could reduce bed bug population growth. These changes in bed bug behavior and fecundity could lead to improved efficacy of Temprid SC in the field, but recovery of impacted bugs must be considered in future studies. Sublethal effects should not be overlooked when evaluating insecticide efficacy, as it is likely that other products may also have indirect effects on population dynamics that could either aid or inhibit successful management of pest populations."

https://openalex.org/W2614104545,"Compromised gastrointestinal barrier function is strongly associated with the progressive and destructive pathologies of the two main forms of irritable bowel disease (IBD), ulcerative colitis (UC), and Crohn's disease (CD). Matriptase is a membrane-anchored serine protease encoded by suppression of tumorigenicity-14 (ST14) gene, which is critical for epithelial barrier development and homeostasis. Matriptase barrier-protective activity is linked with the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored serine protease prostasin, which is a co-factor for matriptase zymogen activation. Here we show that mRNA and protein expression of both matriptase and prostasin are rapidly down-regulated in the initiating inflammatory phases of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced experimental colitis in mice, and, significantly, the loss of these proteases precedes the appearance of clinical symptoms, suggesting their loss may contribute to disease susceptibility. We used heterozygous St14 hypomorphic mice expressing a promoter-linked β-gal reporter to show that inflammatory colitis suppresses the activity of the St14 gene promoter. Studies in colonic T84 cell monolayers revealed that barrier disruption by the colitis-associated Th2-type cytokines, IL-4 and IL-13, down-regulates matriptase as well as prostasin through phosphorylation of the transcriptional regulator STAT6 and that inhibition of STAT6 with suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) restores protease expression and reverses cytokine-induced barrier dysfunction. Both matriptase and prostasin are significantly down-regulated in colonic tissues from human subjects with active ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease, implicating the loss of this barrier-protective protease pathway in the pathogenesis of irritable bowel disease.

Although high levels of microparticles (MPs) have been consistently reported in SCA and evidence of their harmful impact on the SCA complication occurrences have been provided, no data on MP pattern in HbSC patients has been reported so far. In this study, we determined and compared the MP patterns of 84 HbSC and 96 SCA children, all at steady-state, using flow cytometry. Most of circulating MPs were derived from platelets (PLTs) and red blood cells (RBCs) in the two SCD syndromes. Moreover, we showed that HbSC patients exhibited lower blood concentration of total MPs compared to SCA patients, resulting mainly from a decrease of MP levels originated from RBCs and to a lesser extent from PLTs. We did not detect any association between blood MP concentrations and the occurrence of painful vaso-occlusive crises, acute chest syndrome and pulmonary hypertension in both patient groups. We also demonstrated for the first time, that whatever the considered genotype, RBC-derived MPs exhibited higher externalized phosphatidylserine level and were larger than PLT-derived MPs."
https://openalex.org/W2613544694,"Rapamycin is a clinically important drug that is used in transplantation and cancer therapy but which causes a number of side effects, including male infertility. Its canonical target, mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), plays a key role in metabolism and binds chromatin; however, its precise role in the male germline has not been elucidated. Here, we inactivate the core component, Raptor, to show that mTORC1 function is critical for male meiosis and the inactivation of sex chromosomes. Disruption of the Raptor gene impairs chromosomal synapsis and prevents the efficient spreading of silencing factors into the XY chromatin. Accordingly, mRNA for XY-linked genes remains inappropriately expressed in Raptor-deficient mice. Molecularly, the failure to suppress gene expression corresponded with deficiencies in 2 repressive chromatin markers, H3K9 dimethylation and H3K9 trimethylation, in the XY body. Together, these results demonstrate that mTORC1 has an essential role in the meiotic progression and silencing of sex chromosomes in the male germline, which may explain the infertility that has been associated with such inhibitors as rapamycin.-Xiong, M., Zhu, Z., Tian, S., Zhu, R., Bai, S., Fu, K., Davis, J.

However, there is no functional system for monitoring this protein-protein interaction. We developed a luciferase-based modality for real-time monitoring of TREM2-TYROBP coupling in live cells that utilizes split-luciferase complementation technology based on TREM2 and TYROBP fusion to the C- or N-terminal portion of the Renilla luciferase gene. Transient transfection of human embryonic kidney 293 cells with this reporter vector increased luciferase activity upon stimulation with an anti-TREM2 antibody, which induces their homodimerization.

Using a combination of expert elicitation to assess the probable effect of a threat and existing data to assess the level of threat exposure, we conducted a risk assessment for 38 human-mediated threats to eight marine habitats (totalling 304 threat-habitat combinations) in Spencer Gulf, Australia. We developed a score-based survey to collate expert opinion and assess the relative effect of each threat to each habitat, as well as a novel and independent measure of knowledge-based uncertainty. Fifty-five experts representing multiple sectors and institutions participated in the study, with 6 to 15 survey responses per habitat (n = 81 surveys). We identified key threats specific to each habitat; overall, climate change threats received the highest risk rankings, with nutrient discharge identified as a key local-scale stressor. Invasive species and most fishing-related threats, which are commonly identified as major threats to the marine environment, were ranked as low-tier threats to Spencer Gulf, emphasising the importance of regionally-relevant assessments. Further, we identified critical knowledge gaps and quantified uncertainty scores for each risk. Our approach will facilitate prioritisation of resource allocation in a region of increasing social, economic and environmental importance, and can be applied to marine regions where empirical data are lacking."

The aim of the present study was to analyze the efficacy and toxicity of gemcitabine with docetaxel in Japanese patients with advanced bone and soft tissue sarcoma. Patients and methods We retrospectively analyzed the effect of gemcitabine and docetaxel therapy on overall response, progression-free survival, overall survival, and toxicity in 42 patients with bone or soft tissue sarcoma who had received the therapy between October 2006 and September 2015, at Tohoku University Hospital. Results The median age was 55 years; 23 patients were men, and 19 were women. Eight had bone sarcoma and 34 had soft tissue sarcoma. Forty patients (95%) had previously been treated with one or more chemotherapeutic regimens. The overall response rate was 6.9% and the disease control rate was 55%. The median progression-free survival was 2.3 months and the median overall survival was 14.3 months. Grade 3 or more neutropenia and febrile neutropenia were observed in 74% and 4.8% of all patients, respectively. Conclusion The response rate was lower and myelosuppression was more frequently observed than in other previous reports. On the other hand, most of toxicities were enough manageable. In addition, some patients had long survival with a good response. Our study supports the notion that gemcitabine and docetaxel therapy is a good therapeutic option for treating patients with advanced soft tissue sarcoma as well as bone sarcoma, also in Asian populations."

https://openalex.org/W2612274162,"Each of the lateral capsular division of central nucleus of amygdala(CeLC), periaqueductal gray (PAG), rostral ventromedial medulla(RVM) and spinal cord has been proved to contribute to the development of opioid-induced hyperalgesia(OIH). Especially, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IIα (CaMKIIα) in CeLC and spinal cord seems to play a key role in OIH modulation. However, the pain pathway through which CaMKIIα modulates OIH is not clear. The pathway from CeLC to spinal cord for this modulation was explored in the present study. Mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia were tested by von Frey test or Hargreaves test, respectively. CaMKIIα activity (phospho-CaMKIIα, p-CaMKIIα) was evaluated by western blot analysis. CaMKIIα antagonist (KN93) was micro-infused into CeLC, spinal cord or PAG, respectively, to evaluate its effect on behavioral hyperalgesia and p-CaMKIIα expression in CeLC, PAG, RVM and spinal cord. Then the underlying synaptic mechanism was explored by recording miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) on PAG slices using whole-cell voltage-clamp methods. Results showed that inhibition of CeLC, PAG or spinal CaMKIIα activity respectively by KN93, reversed both mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia. Microinjection of KN93 into CeLC decreased p-CaMKIIα expression in CeLC, PAG, RVM and spinal cord; while intrathecal KN93 can only block spinal but not CeLC CaMKIIα activity. KN93 injected into PAG just decreased p-CaMKIIα expression in PAG, RVM and spinal cord, but not in the CeLC. Similarly, whole-cell voltage-clamp recording found the frequency and amplitude of mEPSCs in PAG cells were decreased by KN93 added in PAG slice or micro-infused into CeLC in vivo. These results together with previous findings suggest that CaMKIIα may modulate OIH via a CeLC-PAG-RVM-spinal cord descending facilitative pain pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2612580082,"Network address shuffling is a novel moving target defense (MTD) that invalidates the address information collected by the attacker by dynamically changing or remapping the host’s network addresses. However, most network address shuffling methods are limited by the limited address space and rely on the host’s static domain name to map to its dynamic address; therefore these methods cannot effectively defend against random scanning attacks, and cannot defend against an attacker who knows the target’s domain name. In this paper, we propose a network defense method based on random domain name and address mutation (RDAM), which increases the scanning space of the attacker through a dynamic domain name method and reduces the probability that a host will be hit by an attacker scanning IP addresses using the domain name system (DNS) query list and the time window methods. Theoretical analysis and experimental results show that RDAM can defend against scanning attacks and worm propagation more effectively than general network address shuffling methods, while introducing an acceptable operational overhead."
https://openalex.org/W2612858861,"Although the natural history of vestibular schwannomas (VS) has been previously studied, few studies have investigated associated epidemiological factors, primarily because of the lack of large available cohorts.The objective of this study was to perform a multi-scale geographical analysis of the period prevalence of VS in West Scotland from 2000 to 2015.Adults diagnosed with sporadic VS were identified through the National Health Services of West Scotland database and geocoded to the unit postcode. To assess whether the cohort of VS cases could be pooled into a period prevalence measure, the locations of VS cases were analyzed by sex using Cross-L and Difference-K functions. VS period prevalence was examined at two aggregate spatial scales: the postcode district and a coarser scale of NHS Health Boards. The spatial structure of period prevalence within each level of spatial aggregation was measured using univariate global and local Moran's I. Bivariate local Moran's I was used to examine the between-scale variability in period prevalence from the postcode district level to the NHS Health Boards levels. Prior to spatial autocorrelation analyses, the period prevalence at the postcode district was tested for stratified spatial heterogeneity within the NHS Health Boards using Wang's q-Statistic.A total of 512 sporadic VS were identified in a population of over 3.1 million. Between 2000 and 2015, VS period prevalence was highest within the NHS Health Boards of Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Ayrshire and Arran and the Western Isles. However, at the NHS scale, period prevalence exhibited no spatial autocorrelation globally or locally. At the district scale, Highland exhibited the most unusual local spatial autocorrelation. Bivariate local Moran's I results indicated general stability of period prevalence across the postcode district to Health Boards scales. However, locally, some postcode districts in Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Ayrshire and Arran exhibited unusually low district to zone spatial autocorrelation in period prevalence, as did the southern parts of the Western Isles. Some unusually high period prevalence values between the postcode district to Health Board scale were found in Tayside, Forth Valley and Dumfries and Galloway.Geographic variability in VS in West Scotland was identified in this patient population, showing that there are areas, even remote, with unusually high or low period prevalence. This can be partially attributed to links between primary and tertiary care. Potential genetic or environmental risk factors that may contribute to geographic variation in this disease within Scotland are also a possibility but require further investigation."

https://openalex.org/W2613771193,"Purpose To investigate the variability and prognostic value of nodal tumor volume (NTV) in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Methods and materials Data on 1230 patients with newly diagnosed stage T1-4N1-3M0 NPC treated with definitive radiation therapy with or without chemotherapy at a single cancer center were reviewed. NTV was determined from dose volume histogram (DVH) data. X-tile analysis was applied to identify the optimal cut-off points for the NTV with respect to regional recurrence-free survival (RRFS). Correlations between the TNM classification system, NTV and RRFS were assessed using a Cox regression model. Cross-validation based on receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was applied to compare the prognostic predictive validity of NTV and N categories. Results Within a median follow-up of 49.9 (range, 1.27–76.40) months, 61/1230 (5%) patients developed regional recurrence and 154 (12.5%) developed distant metastasis. NTV values of 7.2 cc and 35.7 cc were identified as the optimal cut-off points. Patients with larger NTV had poorer prognosis. Compared with the N category, NTV was better at determining RRFS for patients with NPC. Hazard ratios increased with NTV, ranging from 1.86 (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.92–3.78) for NTV between 7.2 cc to 35.7 cc, and 3.67 (95% CI, 1.58–8.50) for NTV > 35.7 cc. With both NTV and N category in the same Cox regression model, only NTV remained statistically significant in the RRFS of NPC. The validation results with ROC curves also revealed that, NTV was superior to N category for predicting RRFS with significantly larger area under the ROC curve. Conclusions NTV offers important prognostic value for treatment outcomes in NPC, especially regional control. Volumetric analysis of nodal involvement may assist selection of patients with poor prognosis."

https://openalex.org/W2613830792,"β-catenin is a key signalling molecule in the canonical Wnt pathway, which plays a role in cell adhesion, embryogenesis and sex determination. However, little is known about its function in teleosts. We cloned and characterized the full-length β-catenin1 gene from half-smooth tongue sole (Cynoglossus semilaevis), which was designated CS-β-catenin1. The CS-β-catenin1 cDNA consists of 2,346 nucleotides and encodes a protein with 782 amino acids. Although CS-β-catenin1 was transcribed in the gonads of both sexes, the level was significantly higher in ovaries compared to testes. Furthermore, the mRNA level of CS-β-catenin1 was significantly upregulated at 160 days and constantly increased until 2 years of age. In situ hybridization revealed that CS-β-catenin1 mRNA was mainly localized in oocyte cells, especially in stage I, II and III oocytes. When CS-β-catenin1 expression was inhibited by injection of quercetin in the ovaries, levels of CS-Figla and CS-foxl2 mRNA were significantly down-regulated, and CS-dmrt1 was up-regulated, which suggested that CS-β-catenin1 is a potential upstream gene of CS-Figla and is involved in the development of the ovaries, i.e., folliculogenesis."

In a systematic review, we analyzed the relevance of alcohol and high fat consumption to cutaneous and repair, compared the main methodologies used and the most important parameters tested. Preclinical investigations with murine models were assessed to analyze whether the current evidence support clinical trials.The studies were selected from MEDLINE/PubMed and Scopus databases, according to Fig 1. All 15 identified articles had their data extracted. The reporting bias was investigated according to the ARRIVE (Animal Research: Reporting of in Vivo Experiments) strategy.In general, animals offered a high-fat diet and alcohol showed decreased cutaneous wound closure, delayed skin contraction, chronic inflammation and incomplete re-epithelialization.In further studies, standardized experimental design is needed to establish comparable study groups and advance the overall knowledge background, facilitating data translatability from animal models to human clinical conditions."

However, the co-occurrence of a drag mark, together with the dead animal that produced it, is exceptional. Here, we describe an 8.5 m long ammonite drag mark complete with the preserved ammonite shell (Subplanites rueppellianus) at its end. Previously recorded examples preserve ammonites with drag marks of < 1 m. The specimen was recovered from a quarry near Solnhofen, southern Germany. The drag mark consists of continuous parallel ridges and furrows produced by the ribs of the ammonite shell as it drifted just above the sediment surface, and does not reflect behaviour of the living animal."
https://openalex.org/W2612585199,"We determine p53 protein abundances and cell to cell variation in two human cancer cell lines with single cell resolution, and show that the fractional width of the distributions is the same in both cases despite a large difference in average protein copy number. We developed a computational framework to identify dominant mechanisms controlling the variation of protein abundance in a simple model of gene expression from the summary statistics of single cell steady state protein expression distributions. Our results, based on single cell data analysed in a Bayesian framework, lends strong support to a model in which variation in the basal p53 protein abundance may be best explained by variations in the rate of p53 protein degradation. This is supported by measurements of the relative average levels of mRNA which are very similar despite large variation in the level of protein."
https://openalex.org/W2613606507,"Polydactyly, a common heritable limb malformation in vertebrates, is characterized by supernumerary digits. In chickens, basic characteristics and rough dominant genes have been explored in past decades; however, the elaborate pattern of inheritance and the determinant gene remain obscure. In this study, different types of polydactylism were classified by the numbers and the shapes of toes, including the newly defined subtypes of B’ and G, for the Beijing fatty chicken, a native breed of chicken from China. Through experiments on hybridization, we demonstrated a complete dominant inheritance of polydactyly instead of an incomplete penetrance or genetic modification of the previous conjecture. In particular, by using the F2 population of the five-digit purebred line of Beijing fatty chicken backcrossed to Shiqiza chicken and by using restriction-site associated DNA based markers, we performed a genome-wide association study on the trait of polydactyly. Furthermore, whole genome resequencing strategy was applied to sweep SNPs across the whole genome. An outlier-based Fst approach was employed to search for signatures of selection, and results indicated that the determinant mutation was found in the region ranging from 8.3 Mb to 8.7 Mb, where the polydactyly candidate gene LMBR1 was located. The G/T mutation of rs80659072 was identified to be highly associated with polydactyly in our resequencing and was validated in random samples from an expanded population. Thus, we confirmed that LMBR1 was the causative gene of polydactyly in the Beijing fatty chicken by using GWAS with restriction-site associated DNA based markers and resequencing."
https://openalex.org/W2614021598,"It has been reported that sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies, flow intensity and mesoscale ocean processes, all affect sardine production, both in eastern and western boundary current systems. Here we tested the hypothesis whether extreme high and low commercial landings of the Brazilian sardine fisheries in the South Brazil Bight (SBB) are sensitive to different oceanic conditions. An ocean model (ROMS) and an individual based model (Ichthyop) were used to assess the relationship between oceanic conditions during the spawning season and commercial landings of the Brazilian sardine one year later. Model output was compared with remote sensing and analysis data showing good consistency. Simulations indicate that mortality of eggs and larvae by low temperature prior to maximum and minimum landings are significantly higher than mortality caused by offshore advection. However, when periods of maximum and minimum sardine landings are compared with respect to these causes of mortality no significant differences were detected. Results indicate that mortality caused by prevailing oceanic conditions at early life stages alone can not be invoked to explain the observed extreme commercial landings of the Brazilian sardine. Likely influencing factors include starvation and predation interacting with the strategy of spawning “at the right place and at the right time”."
https://openalex.org/W2612826999,"‘Living in Harmony with Nature’ is a 2050 vision put forth by the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) which takes into consideration culture and locality of perceptions of nature and aspirations for its use. Considering that 54% of the world population lives in cities, where nature has been decimated, the role of rural communities, living within or in proximity of natural and semi natural areas, will effectively influence the fate of the ‘remaining’ nature while they engage in local development. Reconciling between growth and development on the one hand, and nature conservation on the other, necessitates an understanding of how rural communities, especially the youth, imprint their own ideas on landscapes and develop ownership over natural spaces. In order to extend the understanding of how harmony with nature is perceived in different parts of the world, this paper presents the findings of primary research involving a group of young people who live in rural areas in Lebanon, a country in the Arab Middle East. Participatory research based on photovoice methodology was conducted with 77 young people aged 7–16 and residing in five rural villages located in different parts of Lebanon. Photographs taken by participants indicated that for many, nature was not perceived literally i.e. woodlands, forests, plants, animals, etc…. Instead, the participants saw nature as part of agriculture and local culture. Nature was also seen as symbolic expression of the participants’ inner state of mind. Narratives written to explain the photographs shed light on the perception of harmony with nature which focused on positive family experiences and relayed personal emotions, abstract, and holistic yet functional view of nature. Another recurring theme that emerged from photographs and narratives was the role of family members, in particular grandparents, as having a strong influence on the positive perceptions of nature."

https://openalex.org/W2612945204,"As a sustainable transportation mode, high-speed railway (HSR) has become an efficient way to meet the huge travel demand. However, due to the high acquisition and maintenance cost, it is impossible to build enough infrastructure and purchase enough train-sets. Great efforts are required to improve the transport capability of HSR. The utilization efficiency of train-sets (carrying tools of HSR) is one of the most important factors of the transport capacity of HSR. In order to enhance the utilization efficiency of the train-sets, this paper proposed a train-set circulation optimization model to minimize the total connection time. An innovative two-stage approach which contains segments generation and segments combination was designed to solve this model. In order to verify the feasibility of the proposed approach, an experiment was carried out in the Beijing-Tianjin passenger dedicated line, to fulfill a 174 trips train diagram. The model results showed that compared with the traditional Ant Colony Algorithm (ACA), the utilization efficiency of train-sets can be increased from 43.4% (ACA) to 46.9% (Two-Stage), and 1 train-set can be saved up to fulfill the same transportation tasks. The approach proposed in the study is faster and more stable than the traditional ones, by using which, the HSR staff can draw up the train-sets circulation plan more quickly and the utilization efficiency of the HSR system is also improved."
