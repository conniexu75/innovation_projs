https://openalex.org/W2981201615,"The ventrolateral subdivision of the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMHvl) contains ∼4,000 neurons that project to multiple targets and control innate social behaviors including aggression and mounting. However, the number of cell types in VMHvl and their relationship to connectivity and behavioral function are unknown. We performed single-cell RNA sequencing using two independent platforms—SMART-seq (∼4,500 neurons) and 10x (∼78,000 neurons)—and investigated correspondence between transcriptomic identity and axonal projections or behavioral activation, respectively. Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) identified 17 transcriptomic types (T-types), including several sexually dimorphic clusters, the majority of which were validated by seqFISH. Immediate early gene analysis identified T-types exhibiting preferential responses to intruder males versus females but only rare examples of behavior-specific activation. Unexpectedly, many VMHvl T-types comprise a mixed population of neurons with different projection target preferences. Overall our analysis revealed that, surprisingly, few VMHvl T-types exhibit a clear correspondence with behavior-specific activation and connectivity."

EPS-blastoids provide a unique platform for studying early embryogenesis and pave the way to creating viable synthetic embryos by using cultured cells. Mammalian embryogenesis starts with a fertilized egg, which divides to generate blastomeres. Mouse blastomeres are considered totipotent until the 8-cell stage (Papaioannou et al., 1989Papaioannou V.E. Mkandawire J. Biggers J.D.

The blastomeres then compact, polarize, and undergo the first two lineage segregations to generate three different cell types of a blastocyst. The first lineage segregation specifies an outer trophectoderm (TE) layer and an inner cell mass (ICM). ICM cells later segregate into epiblast (EPI) and primitive endoderm (PE) lineages. Stem-cell lines from all three blastocyst lineages have been derived and stably maintained in vitro, namely embryonic stem cells (ESCs) (Evans and Kaufman, 1981Evans M.J. Kaufman M.H.

With all the necessary parts available, it could be possible to de novo assemble an artificial embryo by using cultured stem cells. Early attempts to generate embryo-like structures relied on the spontaneous differentiation of EPI-derived ESCs in 3D culture, thereby producing structurally disorganized cell aggregates, termed embryoid bodies (Doetschman et al., 1985Doetschman T.C.

Organized embryo-like structures can also be generated from ESCs in 2D or 3D differentiation cultures. For example, under inductive cues, mouse and human ESCs could establish spatial patterns resembling a gastrulating embryo when cultured in a soft fibrin matrix and micropatterned condition, respectively (Poh et al., 2014Poh Y.-C. Chen J. Hong Y. Yi H. Zhang S. Chen J. Wu D.C. Wang L. Jia Q. Singh R. et al.Generation of organized germ layers from a single mouse embryonic stem cell.Nat.

In addition, pulsing mouse ESC aggregates undergoing differentiation with a WNT-β-catenin pathway activator in a shaking 3D culture gave rise to elongated gastruloids (Beccari et al., 2018Beccari L.

Others have used multiple stem-cell types to assemble embryo-like structures. Aggregation of ESCs, TSCs, and/or XENs generated embryo-like structures that recapitulated several key morphogenetic events characteristic of early postimplantation development, including lumenogenesis, epithelialization, and symmetry breaking to specify mesoderm and primordial germ-cell-like cells (Harrison et al., 2017Harrison S.E.

Commun. 2019; 10: 496Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). These successes have stimulated the interest in recreating a preimplantation blastocyst from cultured stem cells. Recently, Rivron et al. reported the early success of generating mouse blastocyst-like structures, termed blastoids, by the sequential aggregation of ESCs and TSCs in microwells (Rivron et al., 2018Rivron N.C. Frias-Aldeguer J. Vrij E.J. Boisset J.-C. Korving J. Vivié J. Truckenmüller R.K. van Oudenaarden A. van Blitterswijk C.A. Geijsen N. Blastocyst-like structures generated solely from stem cells.Nature. 2018; 557: 106-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). These blastoids (hereafter referred to as ETS-blastoids) morphologically resemble blastocysts and can implant and induce the formation of decidua upon embryo transfer. Notwithstanding the success, however, generation of ETS-blastoids involves the use of two peri-implantation stem-cell lines and is unable to model preimplantation development. In addition, ETS-blastoids poorly developed into postimplantation embryo-like structures in vitro (Vrij et al., 2019Vrij E.J. Scholte op Reimer Y.S. Frias-Aldeguer J. Misteli Guerreiro I. Kind J. Koo B.-K. van Blitterswijk C.A. Rivron N.C.

Frias-Aldeguer J. Vrij E.J. Boisset J.-C. Korving J. Vivié J. Truckenmüller R.K. van Oudenaarden A. van Blitterswijk C.A. Geijsen N. Blastocyst-like structures generated solely from stem cells.Nature. 2018; 557: 106-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Blastocysts can be generated from a single totipotent blastomere at the 2-, 4-, and 8-cell stages (Papaioannou et al., 1989Papaioannou V.E. Mkandawire J. Biggers J.D.

Development of blastomeres of mouse eggs isolated at the 4- and 8-cell stage.J. Embryol. Exp. Morphol. 1967; 18: 155-180PubMed Google Scholar). In recent years, there have been significant advances in identifying and stabilizing cultured stem cells with totipotent-like features. It was first observed that mouse ESCs could transiently cycle in and out of a 2-cell embryo-like state (Macfarlan et al., 2012Macfarlan T.S. Gifford W.D. Driscoll S. Lettieri K. Rowe H.M. Bonanomi D.

Totipotent embryonic stem cells arise in ground-state culture conditions.Cell Rep. 2013; 3: 1945-1957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). More recently, we and others have developed culture conditions that can stabilize totipotent-like features in cultured extended pluripotent stem cells or expanded potential stem cells (hereafter referred to as EPS cells). EPS cells can efficiently contribute to both embryonic (Em) and extraembryonic (ExEm) lineages in vitro and in vivo (Yang et al., 2017aYang J. Ryan D.J. Wang W. Tsang J.C.-H. Lan G. Masaki H. Gao X. Antunes L. Yu Y. Zhu Z. et al.Establishment of mouse expanded potential stem cells.Nature. 2017; 550: 393-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, Yang et al., 2017bYang Y. Liu B. Xu J.

On the basis of these results, we hypothesize that EPS cells alone can differentiate and self-organize into blastoids that contain all three founder tissues of a blastocyst: EPI, TE, and PE. Here, we report the generation of blastoids from mouse EPS cells by using a newly developed 3D differentiation system. From these blastoids (herein referred to as EPS-blastoids), we were able to derive ESCs, TSCs, and XENs. When further cultured, EPS-blastoids generated structures characteristic of an embryonic day 5.0–5.5 (E5.0–E5.5) postimplantation embryo. In utero EPS-blastoids were capable of implantation, triggering decidualization, and gave rise to structures containing live tissues of EPI, TE, and PE origins. Bulk and single-cell RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis revealed that EPS-blastoids were transcriptionally similar to natural E3.5 blastocysts and contained all three blastocyst cell lineages. Also, we were able to generate EPS-blastoids from mouse fibroblasts, providing proof of principle that embryo-like structures can also be generated from somatic cells. The ability of a single EPS cell to contribute to all three blastocyst lineages suggests that, under certain conditions, EPS cells can differentiate and self-organize into blastocyst-like structures (Figure 1A). To test this idea, we first seeded dissociated mouse EPS cells into microwells (∼5 cells per microwell) to form small aggregates. During early preimplantation development, TE cells are specified before ICM cells (Posfai et al., 2017Posfai E. Petropoulos S. de Barros F.R.O. Schell J.P. Jurisica I. Sandberg R. Lanner F. Rossant J. Position- and Hippo signaling-dependent plasticity during lineage segregation in the early mouse embryo.eLife. 2017; 6: 2813Crossref Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Thus, we focused on optimizing conditions that bias the differentiation of EPS cells toward trophoblasts. We tested a commonly used TSC culture medium (Tanaka et al., 1998Tanaka S. Kunath T. Hadjantonakis A.K. Nagy A. Rossant J. Promotion of trophoblast stem cell proliferation by FGF4.Science. 1998; 282: 2072-2075Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar) and found that although cell aggregates grew well in TSC medium alone, they failed to form any sphere-like structures (Figure 1B). Interestingly, mixing an embryo culture medium (KSOM) with TSC medium at a 1:1 ratio induced cavity formation in a small number of cell aggregates (Figure 1B). The effect of the KSOM could be replicated with another embryo culture medium, M16 (Figure S1A). Later, we switched from KSOM:TSC medium to KSOM:ETS medium (a 2:1:1 mixture of KSOM, N2B27 basal, and TSC basal medium), which supports the growth of both ESC and TSC aggregates (Harrison et al., 2017Harrison S.E.

To further improve the differentiation condition, we screened for different growth factors, cytokines, and small molecules to identify the condition or conditions that enable the generation of structures mimicking blastocysts (EPS-blastoids), which contain a cavity and an ICM. We found that a combination of FGF4, Heparin, BMP4, CHIR99021, and A83-01 resulted in the highest efficiency of EPS-blastoid formation. We also treated EPS cells with Y-27632, a Rho kinase (ROCK) inhibitor, on the day of seeding to enhance cell survival. Using this optimized condition, we consistently observed that EPS-blastoids emerged 3 days after cell seeding (Figure 1C). EPS-blastoids continued to enlarge, reaching an early blastocyst-like size at around day 5 or day 6. To quantify the efficiency of EPS-blastoid formation, we counted the total number of blastocyst-like structures and divided it by the total number of cell aggregates. We tested two independent EPS cell lines and found that ∼15% of the cell aggregates exhibited typical blastocyst-like morphology at day 5 or day 6 (Figure 1D; Table S1). The average diameter of these EPS-blastoids was comparable to that of E3.5 blastocysts (Figures 1E and 1F). WNT-β-catenin signaling pathway is dispensable for blastocyst formation (Figures S1B and S1C) (Biechele et al., 2013Biechele S. Cockburn K. Lanner F. Cox B.J. Rossant J. Porcn-dependent Wnt signaling is not required prior to mouse gastrulation.Development. 2013; 140: 2961-2971Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, Haegel et al., 1995Haegel H. Larue L. Ohsugi M. Fedorov L. Herrenknecht K. Kemler R. Lack of beta-catenin affects mouse development at gastrulation.Development. 1995; 121: 3529-3537Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, WNT3a can transiently upregulate CDX2 (a trophoblast transcription factor) in mouse ESCs (He et al., 2008He S. Pant D. Schiffmacher A. Meece A. Keefer C.L. Lymphoid enhancer factor 1-mediated Wnt signaling promotes the initiation of trophoblast lineage differentiation in mouse embryonic stem cells.Stem Cells. 2008; 26: 842-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), and activation of the canonical WNT pathway was necessary for the generation of ETS-blastoids (Rivron et al., 2018Rivron N.C. Frias-Aldeguer J. Vrij E.J. Boisset J.-C. Korving J. Vivié J. Truckenmüller R.K. van Oudenaarden A. van Blitterswijk C.A. Geijsen N. Blastocyst-like structures generated solely from stem cells.Nature. 2018; 557: 106-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Similarly, we found that the WNT antagonists, XAV939 and IWR-1-endo, significantly inhibited EPS-blastoid formation (Figures S1D and S1E; Table S1). Next, we tested whether a single EPS cell could give rise to an entire EPS-blastoid. Surprisingly, we found that individual EPS cells did not survive in the differentiation system. To overcome this problem, we mixed puromycin-resistant and mCherry+ EPS cells with helper wild-type EPS cells at the ratio of 1:10 for the initial plating. A low concentration of puromycin (0.25 μg/mL) was added to the differentiation medium 24 h later to eliminate helper cells gradually (Figure 1G). Using this strategy, we could generate clonal EPS-blastoids from a single EPS cell with an efficiency of ∼2.7% (Figures 1H and 1I; Table S1). These results demonstrate that a single EPS cell retains the capacity to form an entire EPS-blastoid. We also examined whether extended pluripotency is required for generating blastoids. To this end, we compared blastoid-formation efficiencies between an ESC line (Tanimoto et al., 2008Tanimoto Y. Iijima S. Hasegawa Y. Suzuki Y. Daitoku Y. Mizuno S. Ishige T. Kudo T. Takahashi S. Kunita S. et al.Embryonic stem cells derived from C57BL/6J and C57BL/6N mice.Comp. Med. 2008; 58: 347-352PubMed Google Scholar) and EPS cells converted from the same ESC line. We found that whereas ∼8% of ES-converted EPS cell aggregates formed EPS-blastoids, little to no (∼0.2%) ESC aggregates generated blastocyst-like structures (ES-blastoids) (Figures S1F and S1G; Table S1). Besides EPS cells cultured in the LCDM condition (Yang et al., 2017bYang Y. Liu B. Xu J. Wang J. Wu J. Shi C. Xu Y. Dong J. Wang C. Lai W. et al.Derivation of Pluripotent Stem Cells with In Vivo Embryonic and Extraembryonic Potency.Cell. 2017; 169: 243-257.e25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), EPS cells generated and cultured under a different culture condition developed by Pengtao Liu’s group (referred to as Liu-EPS) (Yang et al., 2017aYang J. Ryan D.J. Wang W. Tsang J.C.-H. Lan G. Masaki H. Gao X. Antunes L. Yu Y. Zhu Z. et al.Establishment of mouse expanded potential stem cells.Nature. 2017; 550: 393-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) also generated EPS-blastoids in our 3D differentiation system in ∼11% of cell aggregates (Figures S1H and S1I; Table S1). We found that Liu-EPS-blastoids were sized similarly to E3.5 blastocysts (Figure S1J). Next, we investigated whether key cellular and molecular events characteristic of early preimplantation development could be recapitulated during EPS-blastoid formation. Beginning at the 8-cell stage, blastomeres undergo compaction, which is characterized by the formation of intercellular junctions (Rossant and Tam, 2009Rossant J. Tam P.P.L. Blastocyst lineage formation, early embryonic asymmetries and axis patterning in the mouse.Development. 2009; 136: 701-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar, Wang et al., 2008Wang H. Ding T.

Biol. 2008; 318: 112-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). To determine whether a similar process occurs during EPS-blastoid formation, we monitored the dynamics of EPS cell aggregation during the first 18 h. Four hours after seeding, cells were found loosely connected. At ∼18 h, cells started to form compact aggregates (Figure 2A), and the cell adhesion protein E-cadherin and the tight junction protein ZO1 began to accumulate at the cell-cell junctions, reminiscent of a compacted 8-cell embryo (Figures 2B, 2C, S2A, and S2B). The fast kinetics of EPS-cell-aggregate formation was most likely due to the high levels of the Cdh1 and Tjp1 (genes encoding E-cadherin and ZO1, respectively) mRNA and ZO1 protein in cultured EPS cells (Figures S2C and S2D).Figure S2Additional Data on the Characterization of Preimplantation Developmental Processes during EPS-Blastoid Formation, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) Immunofluorescence staining of an EPS aggregate at day 1 (left) and a compacted 8-cell embryo (right) for ZO1.

Pooling gene perturbations greatly improves scalability but is not compatible with imaging of complex and dynamic cellular phenotypes. Here, we introduce a pooled approach for optical genetic screens in mammalian cells. We use targeted in situ sequencing to demultiplex a library of genetic perturbations following image-based phenotyping. We screened a set of 952 genes across millions of cells for involvement in nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) signaling by imaging the translocation of RelA (p65) to the nucleus. Screening at a single time point across 3 cell lines recovered 15 known pathway components, while repeating the screen with live-cell imaging revealed a role for Mediator complex subunits in regulating the duration of p65 nuclear retention. These results establish a highly multiplexed approach to image-based screens of spatially and temporally defined phenotypes with pooled libraries."
https://openalex.org/W2980964315,"Understanding neural circuits requires deciphering interactions among myriad cell types defined by spatial organization, connectivity, gene expression, and other properties. Resolving these cell types requires both single-neuron resolution and high throughput, a challenging combination with conventional methods. Here, we introduce barcoded anatomy resolved by sequencing (BARseq), a multiplexed method based on RNA barcoding for mapping projections of thousands of spatially resolved neurons in a single brain and relating those projections to other properties such as gene or Cre expression. Mapping the projections to 11 areas of 3,579 neurons in mouse auditory cortex using BARseq confirmed the laminar organization of the three top classes (intratelencephalic [IT], pyramidal tract-like [PT-like], and corticothalamic [CT]) of projection neurons. In depth analysis uncovered a projection type restricted almost exclusively to transcriptionally defined subtypes of IT neurons. By bridging anatomical and transcriptomic approaches at cellular resolution with high throughput, BARseq can potentially uncover the organizing principles underlying the structure and formation of neural circuits."
https://openalex.org/W2980991786,"Underrepresentation of Asian genomes has hindered population and medical genetics research on Asians, leading to population disparities in precision medicine. By whole-genome sequencing of 4,810 Singapore Chinese, Malays, and Indians, we found 98.3 million SNPs and small insertions or deletions, over half of which are novel. Population structure analysis demonstrated great representation of Asian genetic diversity by three ethnicities in Singapore and revealed a Malay-related novel ancestry component. Furthermore, demographic inference suggested that Malays split from Chinese ∼24,800 years ago and experienced significant admixture with East Asians ∼1,700 years ago, coinciding with the Austronesian expansion. Additionally, we identified 20 candidate loci for natural selection, 14 of which harbored robust associations with complex traits and diseases. Finally, we show that our data can substantially improve genotype imputation in diverse Asian and Oceanian populations. These results highlight the value of our data as a resource to empower human genetics discovery across broad geographic regions."
https://openalex.org/W2980975640,"Rapid conduction of nerve impulses is critical in life and relies on action potential (AP) leaps through the nodes of Ranvier (NRs) along myelinated nerves. While NRs are the only sites where APs can be regenerated during nerve conduction on myelinated nerves, ion channel mechanisms underlying the regeneration and conduction of APs at mammalian NRs remain incompletely understood. Here, we show that TREK-1 and TRAAK, the thermosensitive and mechanosensitive two-pore-domain potassium (K2P) channels, are clustered at NRs of rat trigeminal Aβ-afferent nerves with a density over 3,000-fold higher than that on their somas. These K2P channels, but not voltage-gated K+ channels as in other parts of nerves, are required for rapid AP repolarization at the NRs. Furthermore, these channels permit high-speed and high-frequency AP conduction along the myelinated afferent nerves, and loss of function of these channels at NRs retards nerve conduction and impairs sensory behavioral responses in animals."
https://openalex.org/W2980631159,"The molecular events that direct nuclear pore complex (NPC) assembly toward nuclear envelopes have been conceptualized in two pathways that occur during mitosis or interphase, respectively. In gametes and embryonic cells, NPCs also occur within stacked cytoplasmic membrane sheets, termed annulate lamellae (AL), which serve as NPC storage for early development. The mechanism of NPC biogenesis at cytoplasmic membranes remains unknown. Here, we show that during Drosophila oogenesis, Nucleoporins condense into different precursor granules that interact and progress into NPCs. Nup358 is a key player that condenses into NPC assembly platforms while its mRNA localizes to their surface in a translation-dependent manner. In concert, Microtubule-dependent transport, the small GTPase Ran and nuclear transport receptors regulate NPC biogenesis in oocytes. We delineate a non-canonical NPC assembly mechanism that relies on Nucleoporin condensates and occurs away from the nucleus under conditions of cell cycle arrest."
https://openalex.org/W2980344383,"Cellular stress responses serve as crucial decision points balancing persistence or culling of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) for lifelong blood production. Although strong stressors cull HSCs, the linkage between stress programs and self-renewal properties that underlie human HSC maintenance remains unknown, particularly at quiescence exit when HSCs must also dynamically shift metabolic state. Here, we demonstrate distinct wiring of the sphingolipidome across the human hematopoietic hierarchy and find that genetic or pharmacologic modulation of the sphingolipid enzyme DEGS1 regulates lineage differentiation. Inhibition of DEGS1 in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells during the transition from quiescence to cellular activation with N-(4-hydroxyphenyl) retinamide activates coordinated stress pathways that coalesce on endoplasmic reticulum stress and autophagy programs to maintain immunophenotypic and functional HSCs. Thus, our work identifies a linkage between sphingolipid metabolism, proteostatic quality control systems, and HSC self-renewal and provides therapeutic targets for improving HSC-based cellular therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W2981212141,"Epigenomic regulation and lineage-specific gene expression act in concert to drive cellular differentiation, but the temporal interplay between these processes is largely unknown. Using neural induction from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) as a paradigm, we interrogated these dynamics by performing RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq), and assay for transposase accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) at seven time points during early neural differentiation. We found that changes in DNA accessibility precede H3K27ac, which is followed by gene expression changes. Using massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) to test the activity of 2,464 candidate regulatory sequences at all seven time points, we show that many of these sequences have temporal activity patterns that correlate with their respective cell-endogenous gene expression and chromatin changes. A prioritization method incorporating all genomic and MPRA data further identified key transcription factors involved in driving neural fate. These results provide a comprehensive resource of genes and regulatory elements that orchestrate neural induction and illuminate temporal frameworks during differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2980397076,"Insect olfactory receptors operate as ligand-gated ion channels that directly transduce odor stimuli into electrical signals. However, in the absence of any known intermediate transduction steps, it remains unclear whether and how these ionotropic inputs are amplified in olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs). Here, we find that amplification occurs in the Drosophila courtship-promoting ORNs through Pickpocket 25 (PPK25), a member of the degenerin/epithelial sodium channel family (DEG/ENaC). Pharmacological and genetic manipulations indicate that, in Or47b and Ir84a ORNs, PPK25 mediates Ca2+-dependent signal amplification via an intracellular calmodulin-binding motif. Additionally, hormonal signaling upregulates PPK25 expression to determine the degree of amplification, with striking effects on male courtship. Together, these findings advance our understanding of sensory neurobiology by identifying an amplification mechanism compatible with ionotropic signaling. Moreover, this study offers new insights into DEG/ENaC activation by highlighting a novel means of regulation that is likely conserved across species."
https://openalex.org/W2981045331,"The nuclear factor (erythroid 2)-like (NRF) transcription factors are a subset of cap'n'collar transcriptional regulators. They consist of three members, NRF1, NRF2, and NRF3, that regulate the expression of genes containing antioxidant-response elements (AREs) in their promoter regions. Although all NRF members regulate ARE-containing genes, each is associated with distinct roles. A comprehensive study of differential and overlapping DNA-binding and transcriptional activities of the NRFs has not yet been conducted. Here, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-exo sequencing, an approach that combines ChIP with exonuclease treatment to pinpoint regulatory elements in DNA with high precision, in conjunction with RNA-sequencing to define the transcriptional targets of each NRF member. Our approach, done in three U2OS cell lines, identified 31 genes that were regulated by all three NRF members, 27 that were regulated similarly by all three, and four genes that were differentially regulated by at least one NRF member. We also found genes that were up- or down-regulated by only one NRF member, with 84, 84, and 22 genes that were regulated by NRF1, NRF2, and NRF3, respectively. Analysis of the ARE motifs identified in ChIP peaks revealed that NRF2 prefers binding to AREs flanked by GC-rich regions and that NRF1 prefers AT-rich flanking regions.

There are three NRF family members: NRF1, NRF2, and NRF3 (1Motohashi H. O'Connor T. Katsuoka F. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M. Integration and diversity of the regulatory network composed of Maf and CNC families of transcription factors.Gene. 2002; 294 (10.1016/S0378-1119(02)00788-6, 12234662): 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). The discovery of different NRF family members followed an effort to find transcription factors controlling expression of β-globin, a gene required for hemoglobin production and proper oxygen transport in vertebrates. NRF1 was the first discovered NRF family member and was identified in a cDNA library screen for binding to the erythroid-specific NF-E2/AP1 consensus sequence found in the 5′ β-globin locus control region, 5′-GCTGAGTCA-3′ (2Chan J.Y. Han X.-L. Kan Y.W. Cloning of Nrf1, an NF-E2-related transcription factor, by genetic selection in yeast.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1993; 90 (10.1073/pnas.90.23.11371, 8248256): 11371-11375Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Shortly thereafter, NRF2 was identified in a comparable cDNA library screen (3Moi P. Chan K. Asunis I. Cao A. Kan Y.W. Isolation of NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), a NF-E2-like basic leucine zipper transcriptional activator that binds to the tandem NF-E2/AP1 repeat of the β-globin locus control region.Proc. Natl.

Intriguingly, the isolation and characterization of NRF3 arose a few years later following a logical deduction: as the genomic locations of nrf1, nrf2, and the NF-E2 subunit p45 (NF-E2p45) were found near hoxB, hoxD, and hoxC genes, respectively, nrf3 was predicted and shown to map close to the hoxA gene (4Kobayashi A.

Almost immediately after the discovery of NF-E2, NRF1, and NRF2, investigators began dissecting the differing roles of these three transcription factors. As they had all been discovered as mediators of β-globin expression, initial investigations looked into their roles in erythropoiesis and hematology. NF-E2p45 knockout mice exhibited an absence of platelets and hemorrhaging, but had very little effect on erythroid cell lineages and were able to survive to adulthood (5Shivdasani R.A. Orkin S.H. Erythropoiesis and globin gene expression in mice lacking the transcription factor NF-E2.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1995; 92 (10.1073/pnas.92.19.8690, 7567998): 8690-8694Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). In contrast, NRF1 knockout mice displayed severe anemia due to impaired fetal liver erythropoiesis and died in utero (6Chan J.Y. Kwong M. Lu R. Chang J. Wang B. Yen T.S. Kan Y.W. Targeted disruption of the ubiquitous CNC-bZIP transcription factor, Nrf-1, results in anemia and embryonic lethality in mice.EMBO J. 1998; 17 (10.1093/emboj/17.6.1779, 9501099): 1779-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 7Farmer S.C.

Homozygous Nrf2 knockout mice, however, displayed no obvious defects in embryogenesis, fertility, or litter sizes (8Chan K. Lu R. Chang J.C. Kan Y.W. NRF2, a member of the NFE2 family of transcription factors, is not essential for murine erythropoiesis, growth, and development.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The role of NRF2 became more apparent following challenge with carcinogens, where it was initially shown to protect mice against chemical carcinogenesis. Similarly, Nrf3 knockout mice displayed no overt phenotype (9Derjuga A. Gourley T.S. Holm T.M. Heng H.H. Shivdasani R.A. Ahmed R. Andrews N.C. Blank V. Complexity of CNC transcription factors as revealed by gene targeting of the Nrf3 locus.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24 (10.1128/MCB.24.8.3286-3294.2004, 15060151): 3286-3294Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Further insight into the role of Nrf3 may become more apparent after appropriate challenges: for example, Nrf3−/− animals were more likely to develop cell lymphoblastic lymphoma following benzo-a-pyrene exposure (10Chevillard G. Paquet M. Blank V. Nfe2l3 (Nrf3) deficiency predisposes mice to T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma.Blood. 2011; 117 (10.1182/blood-2010-02-271460, 21148084): 2005-2008Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The NRF transcription factors also differed in their tissue localization; Nrf1 and Nrf2 are expressed relatively ubiquitously, whereas Nrf3 expression is highly localized to placental tissue (2Chan J.Y. Han X.-L. Kan Y.W. Cloning of Nrf1, an NF-E2-related transcription factor, by genetic selection in yeast.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Although these early studies into the differential underpinnings of the NRF members showed stark contrasts in expression and mediation of downstream responses between family members, mechanistic investigations into their transcriptional modes of action indicated a more conserved process. To control transcription, all CNC members utilize a similar mechanism. Nuclear CNC transcription factors dimerize with the small musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma, or sMaf proteins (sMafG, sMafK, and sMafF), to bind to DNA. The resulting sMaf/bZip factor complexes have the capacity to bind to several related target DNA sequences: the palindromic Maf recognition element (5′-TGCTGAC(G)TCAGCA-3′), the NF-E2 recognition element (5′-TGCTGACTCAT-3′), and the antioxidant-response element (ARE, 5′-TGABNNNGC-3′) (1Motohashi H.

Historically, genes under ARE control were of particular interest; many of these genes were transcriptionally inducible by electrophilic xenobiotics and consisted predominately of detoxifying enzymes like GSH–S-transferase or NAD(P)H quinone dehydrogenase 1 (NQO1) (13Rushmore T.H.

In a paradigm-shifting work, ARE-containing genes were discovered to be under the transcriptomic control of NRF members, particularly NRF2 (16Itoh K. Chiba T. Takahashi S. Ishii T. Igarashi K. Katoh Y. Oyake T. Hayashi N. Satoh K. Hatayama I. Yamamoto M. Nabeshima Y. An Nrf2/small Maf heterodimer mediates the induction of phase II detoxifying enzyme genes through antioxidant-response elements.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236 (10.1006/bbrc.1997.6943, 9240432): 313-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (3168) Google Scholar). Given the distinct, and occasionally conflicting, roles that have been attributed to the NRF family members, we combined ChIP and RNA-Seq analyses to catalog the overlapping and distinct genes regulated by each NRF family member, providing insights into the transcriptional program governing the NRF family members. The incomplete mechanistic understanding of NRF3 regulation, as well as the absence of a well-established NRF3-specific antibody, complicates systematic evaluation of the transcriptional targets of each NRF family member. To overcome these limitations, we created three derivative U2OS cell lines; each of these cell lines carries a doxycycline-inducible FLAG-tagged NRF family member inserted into the same locus using flp-in technology (Fig. S1). These cell lines allow us to modulate the expression of each NRF family member using doxycycline induction and detection using the highly-specific anti-FLAG–tag antibody (Fig. 1A). To ensure that the induced NRF proteins will translocate to the nucleus to mediate their transcriptional functions, we removed the ER targeting sequences of NRF1 and NRF3, and we replaced the DLG and ETGE motifs of the Neh2 degron on NRF2 with AAA and AAAA, respectively (Fig. 1, B and C). The mutations to Neh2 degron on NRF2 is required to prevent it from interacting with kelch-like ECH–associated protein 1 (KEAP1), which will ubiquitylate and target NRF2 for proteasomal degradation. By establishing this system, we sought to compare gene expression and genomic binding similarities and differences among NRF members in the same cell line with comparable induction systems. Using the constructed cell line, we performed ChIP-exo sequencing using anti-FLAG antibody-conjugated magnetic beads. Although the ChIP studies have been conducted with great success on individual NRF members (17Chorley B.N. Campbell M.R. Wang X. Karaca M. Sambandan D. Bangura F. Xue P. Pi J. Kleeberger S.R. Bell D.A. Identification of novel NRF2-regulated genes by ChIP-Seq: influence on retinoid X receptor α.Nucleic Acids Res. 2012; 40 (10.1093/nar/gks409, 22581777): 7416-7429Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar), no studies have compared binding sites among all NRF members in the same system. All genomic loci found from the ChIP-exo analysis can be found in Table S1. The sequencing results showed good enrichment for binding sites containing antioxidant-response elements for all three NRF members (Fig. 2A); 73, 46, and 66% of NRF1, NRF2, and NRF3 peaks contained one or more AREs, respectively. The ChIP peaks also showed good resolution for AREs, with 96, 83, and 96% of canonical AREs appearing within 200 bp of the peak summits (Fig. 2B). All three NRF members showed binding across all chromosomes (Fig. 2C). In terms of genomic annotations, NRF1 and NRF3 peaks showed relatively similar distributions, with peaks mainly residing in distal intergenic regions (Fig. 2D), whereas NRF2 showed relatively fewer distal intergenic binding sites, and a relative increase in binding sites residing within the promoter and the first exon of genes. All annotated peaks are provided in Table S2. As expected from ChIP of transcription factors, binding sites from the promoter region congregate near the transcription start site (TSS) of genes (Fig. 2E). To determine whether NRF1, NRF2, or NRF3 showed any binding preferences to specific ARE sequences or flanking region sequences, we grouped ChIP-exo binding sites by their specificity to each NRF member or overlaps among different NRF members, searched the peaks for AREs, and identified potential consensus sequences for a 50-bp region flanking the ARE at both the 5′ and the 3′ ends. We then compared whether the sequences were different between groups and identified sequences specific to each NRF member and to those shared by two or more NRF members (Fig. 3, A and B). NRF1 and NRF2 specific binding sites have ARE sequences that differ from each other. ARE sequences from binding sites shared by all three NRF members significantly differed from ARE sequences from binding sites specific to NRF1, NRF2, and NRF3 and ARE sequences from binding sites shared by NRF1 and NRF3. We identified similar trends for sequences flanking both the 5′ and the 3′ regions. We compared the GC to AT ratio at each position in the sequences flanking the ARE from binding sites specific to each NRF members or shared among them (Fig. 4). Sites bound by all three NRF members were particularly enriched for AT at the position immediately preceding the ARE. We found that 28 positions were enriched for GC in binding sites specifically bound by NRF2, whereas seven positions were enriched for AT in NRF1-specific binding sites. None of the other groups showed consensus sequence enrichment for GC or AT at any particular sequence position. We next assessed differences and similarities in genes differentially regulated by NRF1, NRF2, and NRF3 in the RNASeq data. To overexpress each NRF member, we exposed the U2OSTetR–NRFX to doxycycline for 16 h. U2OSTetR–NRF2 cells were also treated with sulforaphane to facilitate NRF2 translocation (18Eren E. Tufekci K.U.

Overexpression of all NRF members yielded increased transcript levels of more than a thousand genes, with NRF1 up-regulating 3155 genes; NRF2 up-regulating 2619, and NRF3 up-regulating 1212 (Fig. 5A). Next, we looked at genes that were regulated by more than one member. All three NRF members commonly up-regulated 557 genes. Additionally, NRF1 and NRF2 commonly up-regulated 849 genes; NRF1 and NRF3 commonly up-regulated 277 genes, and NRF2 and NRF3 commonly up-regulated 149 genes. Looking at the down-regulated portion of differentially expressed genes, NRF1 down-regulated 2515 genes; NRF2 down-regulated 2066 genes, and NRF3 down-regulated 1364 genes. NRF1–NRF2 pair shared more down-regulated genes than the NRF1–NRF3 pair or the NRF2–NRF3 pair (849 genes, 277 genes, and 149 genes, respectively) (Fig. 5A). In summary, NRF1 and NRF2 have the most genes in common relative to all NRF family members. This includes both up-regulated and down-regulated genes. Additionally, NRF1 and NRF2 alter transcript levels of more genes than NRF3. These results highlight the similarities of NRF1 and NRF2 and the uniqueness of NRF3 in downstream regulation of ARE-containing genes. We then analyzed the ChIP-exo data to compare genes regulated by NRF members. We limited genes to those with binding sites falling within 5 kb upstream of the TSS, the first intron, or the first exon. These binding sites were categorized as likely regulatory elements (LREs), which may or may not contain an ARE. NRF1, NRF2, and NRF3 each showed more than 1000 genes harboring LREs (Fig. 5B). 167 genes were shared between all three NRF members. Beyond the 167 genes shared by all NRF family members, NRF3 shared 84 genes with NRF2 and 580 genes with NRF1. NRF1 and NRF2 shared 67 LREs. We were interested in genes that showed differential expression from the RNA-Seq data and had an LRE; we called these genes “high-confidence genes.” Based on these criteria, we identified 262 high-confidence genes. We stratified these genes into 17 groups based on how each NRF member affected their transcript levels (Fig. 5C and summarized in Table 1). Several high-confidence genes were regulated by only one NRF member. For example, ADGRG7 was uniquely up-regulated by NRF1, and NRF1 is the only NRF member showing an LRE in the promoter region of ADGRG7 (Fig. 5D). A similar pattern was observed for PHF20L1 with NRF2 (Fig. 5E). Additionally, TACC1 was down-regulated by NRF2 and contained an NRF2 LRE, whereas MRPL52 is down-regulated by NRF3 and contained an NRF3 LRE (Fig. 5, F and G). 84 high-confidence genes were solely regulated by NRF1 (67 up-regulated and 17 down-regulated). Similarly, NRF2 itself regulates 84 high-confidence genes (55 up-regulated and 29 down-regulated), and NRF3 independently regulates 22 high-confidence genes (3 up-regulated and, 19 down-regulated).Table 1Genes with up-regulated (+), down-regulated (−), or unaffected (0) transcription for each NRF memberNRF1NRF2NRF3Genes+00ADGRG7; C20orf203; HMGCS1; IL15RA; CLEC19A; CHD1L; CENPT; STMN2; LINC01387; BFSP1; SEC24C; HTR2B; ABHD17B; UTP3; ZNF407; NSF; HOMER2; TAOK3; PSMB7; SAMD5; ATP6V1B1-AS1; SGMS1; EYS; CALCR; INPP4A; PAK1; DAAM2; NANP; FRMD3; MARK1; MAPRE2; PLA2G12A; FKBP15; C18orf25; CRK; PPP3CA; CDKL1; SNAPC5; COL21A1; COBL; ANXA10; TMEM132D; NEK1; AKAP2; IMPDH1; MSRB1; HIP1; MBOAT4; PTPRM; LOC101930010; PTPRN; MRO; TMEM30A; TSPAN9; BTBD11; EEA1; PMF1-BGLAP; KIAA0513; ACSL5; TMEM164; SORD; ABCD1; HGS; CEP128; MAP4; CREB5; OSBP20+0GPBP1L1; SYT14; HACD1; DPP8; ZWILCH; SIAH1; TLK2; SPIRE1; DNMT3A; MSH6; PTPRG; ANAPC13; LNPEP; WHSC1L1; MTERF3; ERP44; DDX31; AKIRIN1; LOC100130992; SMIM10L1; GXYLT1; ERO1A; FEM1B; LOC104968399; DUSP2; PAXBP1; UBE2E2; SLC30A5; ZNF12; BAZ1B; SYPL1; ARMC1; WDYHV1; PHF20L1; UHRF2; NOL8; ATP6V1G1; TOR1B; GNG12; NT5C2; CNIH1; GABARAPL2; VAPA; MOB1A; KRCC1; INO80D; PYURF; PIGY; CENPK; TCERG1; GRPEL2; MAT2B; RBAK; RNF216; KAT6A++0PTP4A1; PDCD6IP; VPS5400+ARFIP1; ANK2; HIRA+0+G3BP1; LAMC1; PPIP5K2; SRPK1; DYNC1H1; PHTF1; PES1; PDK1; ENO1; PURB; LPIN1; PSMD4; INADL; EXOC2; VMP1; CALB2; BLVRB+++PRDX1; HTATIP2; DLGAP1-AS2; HMOX1; LUCAT1; SQSTM1; GCLC; FTL; MAFG; LINC00657; TRIO; VCP; BMP6; LPIN2; TBK1; TXNRD1; BAG2; SOD1−00SNORD12C; SNORD12B; NUDT1; ACBD4; TLE6; SOCS5; NUP85; COMMD8; KLHL5; RAI14; IQSEC1; MAL2; SRGAP2B; THSD4; NUTF2; TSNARE1; PCMTD1−+0PPP1R9A0−0ATAD3A; MST1P2; AMPD2; GPR137; SNORD18A; SLX1A-SULT1A3; SLX1B-SULT1A4; VPS9D1; MRPL27; KCNH7; HYAL3; PSMG3; IQCE; FBXO16; PUF60; C9orf69; MAN1B1; LDLRAP1; RHOBTB1; CHST3; ATG2A; CELSR3; UBE2H; TACC1; TYMSOS; DOK1; ARID5A; ARFGAP1; ERGIC1+−0RAB31+−+DST−−0TCIRG1; NACC2; CPSF3L; FUT800−LDHA; MRPL52; RNU6–2; RNU6–9; RNU6–7; RNU6–1; RNU6–8; SYNRG; GTF2IRD1; EMC4; SNX1; SCARB1; HNRNPAB; MTRNR2L8; PTRH2; CUX1; CCDC85C; PI4KAP2; GALNT14+0−NRD1; ABCF3; ALDOA; SLC2A1; PLEC; EIF4G1; GNA12; NSFL1C; KIAA1217; SEPT9++−BRD2; TXN; TNFRSF1A−0−SH3RF3; ACTN1; FGF1; PRKACB; CDS2−−−LAMA5; RNU1-1; RNU1-2; RNU1-27P; RNU1-4; RNVU1-18; RNU1-28P; RNU1-3; CCNJL Open table in a new tab Eighteen high-confidence genes (PRDX1, HTATIP2, DLGAP1-AS2, HMOX1, LUCAT1, SQSTM1, GCLC, FTL, MAFG, LINC00657, TRIO, VCP, BMP6, LPIN2, TBK1, TXNRD1, BAG2, and SOD1) were up-regulated by all three NRF members (Table 1); these included several bona fide NRF target genes containing AREs, such as PRDX1, HMOX1, TXNRD1, FTL, and GCLC. For example, GCLC had an LRE in its promoter and was up-regulated by all three NRF members (Fig. 5H). To determine which of the genes were regulated by canonical NRF signaling, we evaluated the ChIP peaks in the high-confidence genes for the presence of a core ARE consensus sequence, 5′-TGABNNNGC-3′. Indeed, 100% of the 18 high-confidence genes up-regulated by NRF1, NRF2, and NRF3 all contained AREs. This is in contrast to the nine genes down-regulated by NRF1, NRF2, and NRF3, of which only three (33%) had an ARE. When we looked at all 262 high-confidence genes, 62% of them contained an ARE (Fig. 5C). Some genes showed different up- or down-regulation patterns dependent on which NRF member binds to its LRE (Fig. 5C). For example, TNFRSF1A was up-regulated by NRF1 and NRF2, but down-regulated by NRF3 (Fig. 5I). Similarly, DST was found to be up-regulated by NRF1 and NRF3 but down-regulated by NRF2 (Fig. 5J). Some genes were regulated by just two members. For example, GNA12 expression was found to be up-regulated by NRF1, unaffected by NRF2, and down-regulated by NRF3; as expected, only NRF1 and NRF3 have an LRE (Fig. 5K). These different groupings and regulation patterns demonstrate the heterogeneity by which NRF members affect gene expression. Some genes were regulated by just one member, whereas others were regulated by two or more members. Moreover, NRF members binding to the same LRE of a gene sometimes altered gene expression in different directions. All genes and their respective groupings can be found in Table 1. Following the identification of different groupings described in the previous section (Table 1), we decided to focus on the NRF1-specific ADGRG7 and the NRF2-specific PHF20L1. To test whether the NRF member specificity of these two genes is generalizable across different cell lines, we performed validation studies in four different cell lines: H1299 (a nonsmall cell lung cancer cell line); HK2 (an immortalized human renal cortex/proximal tubule cell line); BEAS-2B (an immortalized human bronchial epithelia cell line); and MDA-MB-231 (a breast cancer cell line). These cell lines are not known to have NRF1, NRF2, or NRF3 activation. We pharmacologically induced NRF1 using tunicamycin (22Wang W. Chan J.Y. Nrf1 is targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane by an N-terminal transmembrane domain Inhibition of nuclear translocation and transacting function.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281 (10.1074/jbc.M602802200, 16687406): 19676-19687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and induced NRF2 using sulforaphane (23Thimmulappa R.K. Mai K.H.

Identification of Nrf2-regulated genes induced by the chemopreventive agent sulforaphane by oligonucleotide microarray.Cancer Res. 2002; 62 (12234984): 5196-5203PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, tunicamycin only increased NRF1 protein levels, and sulforaphane only increased NRF2 protein levels across the four tested cell lines (Fig. 6A). We then evaluated transcript levels of ADGRG7 and PHF20L1 using RT-qPCR and found that ADGRG7 mRNA level was induced (∼1.5–3.0-fold) by tunicamycin in all four cell lines (Fig. 6B). Sulforaphane did not induce ADGRG7 in MDA-MB-231, BEAS-2B, or H1299 cell lines and only induced ADGRG7 ∼1.2-fold in the HK2 cell line (Fig. 6C). Tunicamycin did not induce PHF20L1 mRNA in any cell lines (Fig. 6B), whereas sulforaphane induced PHFC20L1 mRNA in MDA-MB-231, BEAS-2B, and H1299 cell lines (Fig. 6C). To ensure canonical transcription targets of NRF1 and NRF2 were up-regulated with both treatments, we measured transcript levels of FTL, GCLM, and NQO1 in the four cell lines and confirmed that all three genes were induced (Fig. S2). To evaluate whether the identified different grouping of genes are conserved across members of the subphyla vertebrata, we evaluated the distribution of phastCons scores for ChIP peaks specific to NRF1–up-regulated, NRF2–up-regulated, NRF3–up-regulated, and NRF1/NRF2/NRF3–up-regulated groups. PhastCons score estimates the likelihood that a specific nucleotide position belongs to a conserved element, an"

We now show that the ability of an aversive punisher to inhibit reward seeking depends on coordinated activity of three distinct afferents to the rostromedial tegmental nucleus (RMTg) arising from cortex, brainstem, and habenula that drive triply dissociable RMTg responses to aversive cues, outcomes, and prediction errors, respectively. These three pathways drive correspondingly dissociable aspects of punishment learning. The RMTg in turn drives negative, but not positive, valence encoding patterns in the ventral tegmental area (VTA). Hence, punishment learning involves pathways and functions that are highly distinct, yet tightly coordinated."
https://openalex.org/W2980679484,"Adhesion G protein–coupled receptors (aGPCRs) represent a distinct family of GPCRs that regulate several developmental and physiological processes. Most aGPCRs undergo GPCR autoproteolysis-inducing domain–mediated protein cleavage, which produces a cryptic tethered agonist (termed Stachel (stinger)), and cleavage-dependent and -independent aGPCR signaling mechanisms have been described. aGPCR G1 (ADGRG1 or G protein–coupled receptor 56 (GPR56)) has pleiotropic functions in the development of multiple organ systems, which has broad implications for human diseases. To date, two natural GPR56 ligands, collagen III and tissue transglutaminase (TG2), and one small-molecule agonist, 3-α-acetoxydihydrodeoxygedunin (3-α-DOG), have been identified, in addition to a synthetic peptide, P19, that contains seven amino acids of the native Stachel sequence. However, the mechanisms by which these natural and small-molecule agonists signal through GPR56 remain unknown. Here we engineered a noncleavable receptor variant that retains signaling competence via the P19 peptide. We demonstrate that both natural and small-molecule agonists can activate only cleaved GPR56. Interestingly, TG2 required both receptor cleavage and the presence of a matrix protein, laminin, to activate GPR56, whereas collagen III and 3-α-DOG signaled without any cofactors. On the other hand, both TG2/laminin and collagen III activate the receptor by dissociating the N-terminal fragment from its C-terminal fragment, enabling activation by the Stachel sequence, whereas P19 and 3-α-DOG initiate downstream signaling without disengaging the N-terminal fragment from its C-terminal fragment. These findings deepen our understanding of how GPR56 signals via natural ligands, and a small-molecule agonist may be broadly applicable to other aGPCR family members."

The helical nature of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) innately promotes the generation of torsional stress during essential processes such as replication and transcription (Postow et al., 2001Postow L. Crisona N.J. Peter B.J. Hardy C.D. Cozzarelli N.R. Topological challenges to DNA replication: conformations at the fork.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Genetical implications of the structure of deoxyribonucleic acid.Nature. 1953; 171: 964-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (1142) Google Scholar). Motor proteins involved in these processes track the helical groove of dsDNA and thus twist the DNA as they forward translocate. This action creates topological impasses during chromatin replication and gene expression (Postow et al., 2001Postow L. Crisona N.J. Peter B.J. Hardy C.D. Cozzarelli N.R. Topological challenges to DNA replication: conformations at the fork.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2001; 98: 8219-8226Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). How they are resolved remains an outstanding fundamental problem in biology. In particular, to ensure successful cell division, the two newly replicated daughter DNA strands must fully segregate, without any intertwining. However, replication over each helical rise of dsDNA produces one (+) supercoil (Ullsperger et al., 1995Ullsperger C.J. Vologodskii A.V. Cozzarelli N.R. Unlinking of DNA by Topoisomerases During DNA Replication.in: Eckstein F. Lilley M.J. Nucleic Acids and Molecular Biology.

Selvaraj S. Yue F. Kim A. Li Y. Shen Y. Hu M. Liu J.S. Ren B.

Supercoiling distributed behind the fork intertwines (or “braids”) the two daughter strands, forming precatenanes (Champoux and Been, 1980Champoux J.J. Been M.D. Topoisomerases and the swivel problem. Academic Press, 1980Crossref Google Scholar). If left unresolved, precatenanes mature into full DNA catenanes that obstruct proper chromosome separation and cause DNA damage and genome instability (Keszthelyi et al., 2016Keszthelyi A. Minchell N.E. Baxter J. The Causes and Consequences of Topological Stress during DNA Replication.Genes (Basel). 2016; 7: E134Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The detrimental nature of unresolved chromatin intertwining highlights the importance of mechanisms that limit precatenane formation and allow for the efficient resolution of DNA supercoiling. The complexity of these topological challenges in the context of chromatin, however, has posed significant barriers to experimentation. As a consequence, our mechanistic understanding of such processes has remained conspicuously limited despite their great importance to cellular viability. The partitioning of supercoiling between the front and back of the replisome is coupled to replisome rotation (also known as fork rotation) (Champoux and Been, 1980Champoux J.J. Been M.D. Topoisomerases and the swivel problem. Academic Press, 1980Crossref Google Scholar, Postow et al., 2001Postow L. Crisona N.J. Peter B.J. Hardy C.D. Cozzarelli N.R. Topological challenges to DNA replication: conformations at the fork.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2001; 98: 8219-8226Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). A non-rotating replisome directs supercoiling into the DNA ahead of the replication fork as it elongates, whereas a rotating replisome will distribute supercoiling behind the fork, leading to catenation of the daughter DNA strands. In vivo genetics studies examining eukaryotic fork rotation have found that rotation is largely inhibited during replication elongation by protein complexes associated with the replisome (Schalbetter et al., 2015Schalbetter S.A. Mansoubi S. Chambers A.L. Downs J.A. Baxter J. Fork rotation and DNA precatenation are restricted during DNA replication to prevent chromosomal instability.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2015; 112: E4565-E4570Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) but occurs near termination, when two replisomes collide head-on (Seidman and Salzman, 1979Seidman M.M. Salzman N.P.

Fork rotation and DNA precatenation are restricted during DNA replication to prevent chromosomal instability.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2015; 112: E4565-E4570Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The mechanisms by which these behaviors are accomplished and regulated remain unclear. These previous studies focused on the interactions of specific proteins with the replisome in restricting fork rotation. However, the intrinsic role of the torsional mechanics of the chromatin substrates has remained largely overlooked. Fork rotation is an inherently mechanical process related to the balance of torque ahead of and behind the replisome. Despite the fact that a replisome can actively generate torsion during replication, it lacks any means of driving its substrates out of torsional equilibrium because the replisome itself experiences minimal viscous drag (Quantification and Statistical Analysis) and is not known to be tethered to any cellular scaffolding. Thus, supercoiling generated by replisome progression will partition ahead of and behind the fork to maintain a balance of torque (Figure 1). Consequently, if it is easier to twist the DNA ahead of the fork, then fork rotation will be minimal and (+) supercoiling will primarily remain in front of the replisome. By contrast, if it is easier to twist the DNA behind the fork, (+) supercoiling will primarily distribute behind the replisome by fork rotation, forming precatenanes. Through this torque balance, the torsional mechanical properties of single and braided chromatin fibers play a decisive role in determining supercoiling partitioning and the occurrence of fork rotation. This, in turn, has implications for the efficient resolution of supercoiling by topoisomerases. However, these torsional mechanical properties remain largely unknown. Despite being integral to eukaryotic replication, braided chromatin fibers have not been previously investigated mechanistically due to the complexity in creating such substrates. In this work, we have developed methods to create and benchmark both single and braided chromatin fiber substrates, determined their torsional mechanical properties, and examined how topoisomerase II (topo II) differentially relaxes these substrates. Our measurements reveal that the intrinsic torsional mechanical properties of chromatin play a fundamental role in suppressing precatenation by preferentially partitioning DNA supercoiling to the single chromatin fiber in front of a replisome, which we show to be a preferred substrate for topo II. This work demonstrates the importance of chromatin torsional mechanics and its synergistic coordination with topoisomerase activity in regulating DNA topology. Investigation of the torsional mechanical properties of chromatin substrates required the development of methods to form both long single chromatin fiber substrates (as would be located in front of a replisome) and long double chromatin substrates (as would be located behind a replisome) and to assess the nucleosome array size and nucleosome quality for both types of substrates (Figure 2). Once established, these methods create benchmarks for torsional mechanical investigations for this study and provide broader opportunities to utilize chromatin fibers in potential future studies of processes taking place over chromatin. To form a chromatin fiber, we assembled nucleosomes onto a 12.7 kbp DNA molecule containing 64 repeats of a nucleosome positioning element (NPE) flanked by ∼500 bp multi-labeled tethering adaptor at each end (Figures 2A and S1; Method Details). This DNA length is comparable to the mean distance that a replisome replicates through in yeast, which is estimated to be ∼15 kbp (Bell and Labib, 2016Bell S.P. Labib K.

Importantly, all mechanical and topoisomerase activity measurements were conducted in the same physiological buffer that contains magnesium and is compatible with topo II activity (Quantification and Statistical Analysis). To benchmark a single chromatin substrate, we mechanically disrupted the nucleosomes in the substrate. Each chromatin fiber was torsionally constrained between two surfaces via multi-labeled tethering adaptors at the two ends. One end was anchored to the surface of a microscope coverslip, while the other end was anchored to the bottom of a nanofabricated quartz cylinder held in an angular optical trap (AOT) (Figure 2B). The AOT permits direct torque measurements of a biological substrate under a controlled amount of supercoiling and also has the ability to measure forces and displacements of a trapped cylinder (Deufel et al., 2007Deufel C.

Our AOT has also been optimized for long DNA substrates (Figure S2). For this particular assay, we did not introduce any twist to the substrate; the AOT was used only to stretch the chromatin fiber along the axial direction of the AOT to disrupt nucleosomes. The resulting force-extension curve was used to characterize the composition of the nucleosome array (e.g., nucleosomes versus subnucleosomal structures) and the number of nucleosomes on the DNA (Figure 2C). We interpret such curves based on a multi-stage disruption model of chromatin that we previously established (Brower-Toland et al., 2002Brower-Toland B.D. Smith C.L. Yeh R.C. Lis J.T. Peterson C.L.

Wang M.D. Torque modulates nucleosome stability and facilitates H2A/H2B dimer loss.Nat. Commun. 2013; 4: 2579Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Under lower forces (2 pN < F < 15 pN, between the two dashed curves), exit and entry DNA (interacting primarily with H2A/H2B dimers) is released from histone core octamers. This “outer-turn” DNA is ∼72 bp in length for each nucleosome. The release is gradual, occurring simultaneously over all nucleosomes with a force plateau at ∼3 pN. By assaying the total DNA released in this low force region, we determined the number of nucleosomes initially containing a wrapped outer-turn Nout, corresponding to the number of complete octamers bound to the template. The second stage of the disruption starts as the force increases beyond 15 pN, where distinctive disruption force peaks are clearly detectable (see inset), with a mean disruption force of ∼26 pN (Figure 2F). Each high disruption force peak corresponds to a release of ∼75 bp of “inner-turn” DNA (interacting primarily with the H3/H4 tetramer) from a single nucleosome (Figure 2G). This stage of disruption occurs sequentially among nucleosomes. By assaying the total DNA released in this inner-turn region, we determined the number of bound tetramers Nin. Similar nucleosome disruption characteristics have been reported by several other groups for shorter single chromatin fibers (Gemmen et al., 2005Gemmen G.J. Sim R. Haushalter K.A. Ke P.C.

Notably, we also developed a method to create a double chromatin fiber. For this substrate to better reflect the leading and lagging strands behind a replisome, we surveyed what is known about whether each of the two strands can rotate freely around its own helical axis during replication. The DNA in the lagging strand is generally thought to be able to freely rotate due to the presence of the single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) regions of the Okazaki fragments (Postow et al., 2001Postow L. Crisona N.J. Peter B.J. Hardy C.D. Cozzarelli N.R. Topological challenges to DNA replication: conformations at the fork.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

For the leading strand, although some torsion accumulation may occur (Yu and Dröge, 2014Yu H. Dröge P. Replication-induced supercoiling: a neglected DNA transaction regulator?.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2014; 39: 219-220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), free rotation may still be a reasonable approximation (Postow et al., 2001Postow L. Crisona N.J. Peter B.J.

Torsion within the leading strand may be relaxed because two replisomes initiating from the same origin move in opposite directions, resulting in the leading strand of one replisome being the lagging strand of the other replisome (Burgers and Kunkel, 2017Burgers P.M.J. Kunkel T.A. Eukaryotic DNA Replication Fork.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2017; 86: 417-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar) and thus allowing the leading strand to rotate freely around its helical axis. In addition, DNA polymerases may exchange with others in solution (Beattie et al., 2017Beattie T.R. Kapadia N. Nicolas E. Uphoff S. Wollman A.J. Leake M.C. Reyes-Lamothe R.

A solution to release twisted DNA during chromosome replication by coupled DNA polymerases.Nature. 2013; 496: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and/or rotate relative to the helicase at the replication fork (Zhou et al., 2017Zhou J.C. Janska A. Goswami P. Renault L. Abid Ali F. Kotecha A. Diffley J.F.X. Costa A. CMG-Pol epsilon dynamics suggests a mechanism for the establishment of leading-strand synthesis in the eukaryotic replisome.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2017; 114: 4141-4146Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Given these considerations, both chromatin fibers used to form double chromatin fiber substrates in our experiments were nicked in order to allow rotation about their respective helical axes. To form a double chromatin fiber substrate, we tethered two nicked chromatin fibers between the coverslip and the bottom of a quartz cylinder held in the AOT (Methods Details). To benchmark the number and quality of nucleosomes of a double chromatin fiber substrate, we stretched it along the axial direction of the AOT to disrupt nucleosomes (Figure 2D). The resulting force-extension curve showed a force that was roughly double that of a single chromatin fiber because the force was applied to two nearly parallel nucleosome arrays (Figures 2E and 2F). A closer examination of the inner-turn DNA release at the high force disruption region shows that some disruptions from the two fibers occurred concurrently, giving rise to a 75 bp DNA release from each fiber, while other disruptions occurred sequentially, giving rise to half of the 75 bp DNA release (Figure 2G). Using a similar analysis as that for a single chromatin fiber, the force-extension relation allowed us to estimate Nout and Nin for each substrate. These stretching experiments (Figures 2, S3, and S4) were performed at the end of each torsional measurement described below. This allowed us to determine the number of nucleosomes in a single chromatin fiber substrate (Figures S3A and S3B) and the mean number of nucleosomes of each fiber in a double chromatin fiber substrate (Figures S4A and S4B). We selected chromatin fibers with Nout and Nin being comparable within measurement uncertainties, consistent with fibers containing primarily full nucleosomes (Quantification and Statistical Analysis). This minimized contributions from subnucleosomes (Nout being substantially smaller than Nin) that may be generated during nucleosome assembly or sample handling. These stretching experiments, coupled with the reversibility requirement imposed for the torsional measurement experiments described below (Figures S3E and S4D), provided a rigorous assessment to evaluate the nucleosome saturation level, integrity, and stability for both the single (Figure S3) and double (Figure S4) chromatin substrates. Only chromatin fibers that passed all of these tests were included for further analysis (Quantification and Statistical Analysis).Figure S4Braided Chromatin Fiber Composition, Saturation, Stability, and Characteristics Assayed on the AOT, Related to Figures 2 and 4Show full caption(A) Experimental configuration to stretch a double chromatin fiber substrate axially using the AOT. For each braided (double) chromatin fiber substrate investigated in main text Figure 4, we assayed the composition of the fibers and the level of saturation. Immediately following the torsional measurement, each substrate was returned to the zero-turns state and stretched along the axial direction of the AOT to disrupt nucleosomes in both arrays (Figures 2D and 2E).(B) Nucleosome composition selection criterion. In the force-extension curve, if the two nucleosome arrays in a double substrate contain the same number of nucleosomes and only canonical nucleosomes, we expect that Nin=Nout (black line). We impose a selection criterion that (|Nin−Nout|/Nin)≤0.20 (gray region). When the two arrays in a double substrate contain substantially different numbers of nucleosomes, our method for detecting the boundaries of inner-turn and outer-turn releases will result in a detected Nin closer to that of the array with a larger number of nucleosomes and the detected Nout closer to that of the array with a smaller number of nucleosomes. Therefore, the detected (|Nin−Nout|/Nin) becomes large, so these substrates will naturally be excluded from further analysis. Thus this selection criterion simultaneously selects substrates with two arrays both being similar in the number of nucleosomes and containing primarily canonical nucleosomes. Each data point came from a single trace that passed this selection criterion.(C) Experimental configuration to twist a double chromatin fiber substrate using the AOT. The distance of end anchor separation is also indicated.(D) Stability of the braided chromatin fiber under twisting. Like the single chromatin fiber, a good braided chromatin substrate must show sufficient stability, and its hat curve should be reversible during the course of twisting measurements. Shown is an example trace of adding (black) and then removing (blue) turns, resulting in two hat curves. Data were smoothed by a 1 turn sliding window. We require that the average difference in extension between these two curves be < 50 nm.(E) Hat height versus nucleosome array saturation for traces. As with a single chromatin fiber substrate, a convenient estimate for the number of nucleosomes on a braided chromatin fiber substrate may be obtained from the hat height (extension at 0 turns when the substrate is torsionally relaxed). In Figure S3C, we established the relationship of hat height as a function of the number of nucleosomes in an ideal braided chromatin fiber substrate where the two arrays contain the same number of nucleosomes and are parallel to each other. This ideal relationship is replotted here (black line). We then plotted measurements (blue dots) from braided fiber substrates that passed the selection criteria shown in Figures S4B and S4D. We found that these measurements (blue dots) fall within 20% of the ideal value.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) (A) Experimental configuration to stretch a double chromatin fiber substrate axially using the AOT.

https://openalex.org/W2981874813,"Several antidepressant drugs activate tropomyosin-related kinase B (TRKB) receptor, but it remains unclear whether these compounds employ a common mechanism for TRKB activation. Here, using MS, we found that a single intraperitoneal injection of fluoxetine disrupts the interaction of several proteins with TRKB in the hippocampus of mice. These proteins included members of adaptor protein complex-2 (AP-2) involved in vesicular endocytosis. The interaction of TRKB with the cargo-docking μ subunit of the AP-2 complex (AP2M) was confirmed to be disrupted by both acute and repeated fluoxetine treatments. Of note, fluoxetine disrupted the coupling between full-length TRKB and AP2M, but not the interaction between AP2M and the TRKB C-terminal region, indicating that the fluoxetine-binding site in TRKB lies outside the TRKB:AP2M interface. ELISA experiments revealed that in addition to fluoxetine, other chemically diverse antidepressants, such as imipramine, rolipram, phenelzine, ketamine, and its metabolite 2R,6R-hydroxynorketamine, also decreased the interaction between TRKB and AP2M in vitro. Silencing the expression of AP2M in a TRKB-expressing mouse fibroblast cell line (MG87.TRKB) increased cell-surface expression of TRKB and facilitated its activation by brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), observed as levels of phosphorylated TRKB. Moreover, animals haploinsufficient for the Ap2m1 gene displayed increased levels of active TRKB, along with enhanced cell-surface expression of the receptor in cultured hippocampal neurons. Taken together, our results suggest that disruption of the TRKB:AP2M interaction is a common mechanism underlying TRKB activation by several chemically diverse antidepressants."

Interestingly, unlike conventional tubulin-targeting drugs, KXO1 has exhibited low toxicity in preclinical and clinical studies, but the reason for this remains elusive, as are the KXO1-binding site and other details of the interaction of KXO1 with tubulin. Here, cell-based experiments revealed that KXO1 induces tubulin depolymerization and G2/M phase cell cycle arrest at low nanomolar concentrations, similar to colchicine, used as a positive control. Results from biochemical experiments, including an N,N-ethylenebis(iodoacetamide) competition assay, disclosed that KXO1 binds to the colchicine-binding site on β-tubulin, further confirmed by the crystal structure of the tubulin–KXO1 complex at 2.5-Å resolution. A high-quality electron density map of the crystallographic data enabled us to unambiguously determine the position and orientation of KXO1 in the colchicine-binding site, revealing the detailed interactions between KXO1 and tubulin. We also found that KXO1 binds reversibly to purified tubulin, induces a totally reversible cellular effect (G2/M cell cycle arrest), and possesses no cellular toxicity 5 days after drug washout, explaining KXO1’s low toxicity. In summary, we show that KXO1 binds to the colchicine-binding site of tubulin and resolved the crystal structure of the tubulin–KXO1 complex.

Photoaffinity labeling of KXO1 identified tubulin as another target of KXO1, and further study showed that KXO1 could inhibit tubulin polymerization in a low-nanomolar range, suggesting that it is a strong tubulin inhibitor (5Smolinski M.P.

Tubulin is an abundant protein in all cell types and is involved in various physiological activities, including cell migration, protein transport, and mitosis. It is the target of many chemotherapeutic drugs in clinical cancer treatment, including paclitaxel, vinblastine, and eribulin (10Kaur R. Kaur G. Gill R.K. Soni R. Bariwal J.

As tubulin inhibitors are nonselective cytotoxic compounds, the tubulin-binding agents in clinical use show good efficacy but exhibit nonnegligible side effects, including chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy, stomatitis, bone marrow suppression, severe weakness, and neurotoxicity (18Gutiérrez-Gutiérrez G.

KXO1 has exhibited a strong inhibitory activity toward tubulin together with extremely low toxicity in preclinical and clinical trials, in contrast to the characteristics of conventional toxic tubulin inhibitors. This deserves in-depth research, as insight into the underlying mechanism could be of great help in developing highly effective tubulin drugs with low toxicity. In addition, the binding site of KXO1 on tubulin and other details of the interaction are not well-understood, hindering further investigation. In this study, through observing the changes in microtubule morphology induced by KXO1 and using an N,N-ethylenebis(iodoacetamide) (EBI) 4The abbreviations used are: EBIN,N-ethylenebis(iodoacetamide)SMBsignificant mitotic blockTFDtryptophan fluorescence decreasePIpropidium iodidePDBProtein Data BankTTLtubulin–tyrosine ligaseT2R–TTLprotein complex composed of αβ-tubulin, stathmin-like protein RB3, and tubulin–tyrosine ligaseCBSIcolchicine-binding site inhibitorp-H3phospho-histone H3GAPDHglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenaseRB3-SLDstathmin-like domain of RB3Bistris propane1,3-bis[tris(hydroxymethyl)methylamino]propane. competitive binding assay, we found that KXO1 directly binds to the colchicine site of β-tubulin. X-ray data of the KXO1–tubulin complex confirmed the binding of KXO1 at the colchicine site and clearly showed the details of the interaction. Reversibility experiments demonstrated that KXO1 binds to tubulin in a totally reversible manner and induces reversible cellular effects, providing a good explanation for the low toxicity of KXO1. Overall, our results suggest that reversible tubulin inhibitors that bind to the colchicine site of β-tubulin could be developed as low-toxicity drugs.

We first examined the effects of KXO1 on the morphology of microtubules in HeLa cells. A tubulin polymerization agent (paclitaxel) and tubulin depolymerization agents (colchicine and vinblastine) were used as positive controls. As shown in Fig. 1A, microtubules in nontreated HeLa cells had a normal network structure (a tubular structure formed by assembly of αβ-tubulin heterodimers). Colchicine and vinblastine inhibit polymerization of tubulin, and paclitaxel promotes its excessive polymerization into abnormal microtubules. KXO1 at 30 nm inhibited tubulin polymerization in a colchicine- or vinblastine-like manner, confirming that KXO1 is a strong tubulin depolymerization agent. All tubulin inhibitors inhibit mitosis and block the cell cycle in the G2/M phase (20Bates D. Eastman A. Microtubule destabilising agents: far more than just antimitotic anticancer drugs.Br. J. Clin. Pharmacol. 2017; 83 (10.1111/bcp.13126, 27620987): 255-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). We found that KXO1 induced G2/M phase cell cycle arrest in a concentration-dependent manner. As shown in Fig. 1B, KXO1 caused G2/M phase cell cycle arrest with 50% of maximal effective concentration (EC50) values of 53.2 ± 3.73, 39.8 ± 4.71, and 74.6 ± 9.45 nm in HeLa, HepG2, and H460 cells, respectively, further confirming that KXO1 is a strong tubulin inhibitor. A previous study using photoaffinity labeling of KXO1 showed that KXO1 directly bound to tubulin and inhibited tubulin polymerization in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (5Smolinski M.P. Bu Y. Clements J. Gelman I.H. Hegab T. Cutler D.L. Fang J.W.S. Fetterly G. Kwan R. Barnett A. Lau J.Y.N. Hangauer D.G.

Chem. 2018; 61 (10.1021/acs.jmedchem.8b00164, 29617135): 4704-4719Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). However, the specific binding site and details of the interaction were not well-clarified. Tryptophan fluorescence decrease (TFD) is commonly used to detect drugs binding to tubulin (21Sardar P.S. Maity S.S. Das L. Ghosh S. Luminescence studies of perturbation of tryptophan residues of tubulin in the complexes of tubulin with colchicine and colchicine analogues.Biochemistry. 2007; 46 (10.1021/bi701412k, 18041823): 14544-14556Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 22Chinen T.

Usui T. et al.The γ-tubulin-specific inhibitor gatastatin reveals temporal requirements of microtubule nucleation during the cell cycle.Nat. Commun. 2015; 6 (10.1038/ncomms9722, 26503935): 8722Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Using a TFD assay, we showed that KXO1 bound to purified tubulin with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 1.26 ± 0.27 μm, whereas the positive compound colchicine showed a Kd value of 13.3 ± 3.30 μm (Fig. 2A), suggesting that KXO1 probably binds more strongly to tubulin than does colchicine. In an in vitro tubulin polymerization assay, KXO1 inhibited tubulin polymerization in a concentration-dependent manner and performed a little better than colchicine (Fig. 2B). Next, we aimed to determine the binding site of KXO1 on tubulin. Tubulin polymerization can be inhibited by binding of inhibitors to either the colchicine or the vinblastine site; however, cells treated with high concentrations of vinblastine uniquely show formation of tubulin paracrystals (packing of unpolymerized tubulin in the cytoplasm) (12Gigant B. Wang C. Ravelli R.B. Roussi F. Steinmetz M.O. Curmi P.A. Sobel A. Knossow M. Structural basis for the regulation of tubulin by vinblastine.Nature. 2005; 435 (10.1038/nature03566, 15917812): 519-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). High concentrations (2 μm) of inhibitors were incubated with HeLa cells for 2 h, and tubulin was observed using immunofluorescence. As shown in Fig. 2C, vinblastine induced the formation of paracrystals in the cytoplasm, whereas colchicine and KXO1 did not, suggesting the possible binding of KXO1 to the colchicine site. For further confirmation, we carried out an EBI assay. One molecule of EBI bound covalently to cysteine 239 and cysteine 354 in the colchicine site of β-tubulin simultaneously to form an EBI–β-tubulin complex, which migrated faster than β-tubulin in SDS-PAGE (23Fortin S. Lacroix J. Côté M.-F. Moreau E. Petitclerc E. C.-Gaudreault R. Quick and simple detection technique to assess the binding of antimicrotubule agents to the colchicine-binding site.Biol. Proced.

As shown in Fig. 2D, colchicine and KXO1 inhibited the formation of the EBI–β-tubulin complex, but vinblastine did not, thus confirming KXO1 binding to the colchicine site on tubulin. Next, we determined the crystal structure of tubulin-bound KXO1 at 2.5-Å resolution by soaking KXO1 (Fig. 3A) in crystals of a protein complex composed of αβ-tubulin, stathmin-like protein RB3, and tubulin–tyrosine ligase (T2R–TTL) (24Prota A.E. Bargsten K. Zurwerra D. Field J.J. Díaz J.F. Altmann K.-H. Steinmetz M.O.

Details of the data collection and refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1. The resulting high-quality electron density map enabled us to determine unambiguously the position and orientation of the inhibitor KXO1 (Fig. 3B), thus revealing in detail the interaction between KXO1 and tubulin (Fig. 3, C and D). Consistent with the tubulin polymerization and EBI data (Fig. 2, C and D), KXO1 bound to the colchicine site (Fig. 3, C and D). As could be seen in the crystal structure, upon binding to the colchicine site, KXO1 formed extensive hydrophobic interactions with various residues of β-tubulin, including βIle-4, βPhe-169, βLeu-242, βLeu-248, βLeu-252, βLeu-255, βMet-259, βIle-318, βIle-376, and βLys-352. The amide and pyridine moieties of KXO1 formed hydrogen bonds with the side chain of βGlu-200 via a water molecule (Fig. 3D).Table 1Data collection and refinement statisticsTubulin–KXO1Data collection Space groupP 21 21 21 Cell dimensionsa, b, c (Å)104.9, 157.1, 182.2α, β, γ (°)90.0, 90.0, 90.0 Resolution (Å)50.0–2.50 (2.54–2.50)aHighest-resolution shell is shown in parentheses.

Open table in a new tab KXO1 is much longer than colchicine. Superimposition of the tubulin–KXO1 structure onto that of tubulin–colchicine showed that KXO1 occupied a much broader position upon binding to the colchicine site than did colchicine (Fig. 4). We have proposed a structure-based colchicine-binding site inhibitor (CBSI) pharmacophore model consisting of three hydrophobic centers (I, II, and III) and two hydrogen bond centers (IV and V) (25Wang Y. Zhang H. Gigant B. Yu Y. Wu Y. Chen X. Lai Q. Yang Z. Chen Q. Yang J. Structures of a diverse set of colchicine binding site inhibitors in complex with tubulin provide a rationale for drug discovery.FEBS J. 2016; 283 (10.1111/febs.13555, 26462166): 102-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). KXO1 occupied hydrophobic centers I and II and hydrophilic center IV of this model. Compared with all other reported CBSI–tubulin structures, the morpholine group of KXO1 extended out of the colchicine pocket and approached the GTP molecule of α-tubulin. KXO1 has exhibited good pharmacological activity together with low toxicity in preclinical and clinical studies. The reversibility of its binding to tubulin is an effective predictor of the toxicity of a microtubule inhibitor (19Yan W. Yang T. Yang J. Wang T. Yu Y. Wang Y. Chen Q. Bai P. Li D. Ye H. Qiu Q.

Generally, irreversible tubulin inhibitors accumulate in cells over a long period and affect the functions of normal cells, resulting in toxicity (26Wozniak K.M. Vornov J.J. Wu Y. Nomoto K.

We used a method developed by Towle et al. (27Towle M.J. Salvato K.A. Wels B.F. Aalfs K.K. Zheng W. Seletsky B.M. Zhu X. Lewis B.M. Kishi Y. Yu M.J.

As shown in Fig. 5A, HeLa cells were treated with a wide range of concentrations of KXO1 (1–10,000 nm) at −12 h, and compounds were totally washed out at 0 h. Cell cycling was detected at 0 and 10 h, and cell viability was detected at 5 days. Fig. 5B shows cell cycle profiles of KXO1 and positive compound colchicine (an irreversible tubulin inhibitor (27Towle M.J. Salvato K.A. Wels B.F. Aalfs K.K. Zheng W. Seletsky B.M. Zhu X. Lewis B.M.

A proportion of cells in the G2/M phase greater than 50% was considered to indicate significant mitotic block (SMB). At 0 h, both KXO1 and colchicine presented SMB at the concentration of 30 nm. However, 10 h after washout, significant differences were observed regarding mitotic block; colchicine at 30 nm continued to induce SMB, whereas a very high concentration (10,000 nm) of KXO1 was required to sustain SMB at this time point. Detection of p-H3 (a marker of G2/M phase cell cycle arrest) by immunoblotting at 0 and 12 h gave similar results (Fig. S1). All these results indicate that colchicine is an irreversible tubulin inhibitor, but KXO1 is a totally reversible tubulin inhibitor. Fig. 5C shows 5-day cell viability data for colchicine and KXO1. After 5 days of culture, both colchicine and KXO1 reduced cell viability at the same concentrations that were capable of inducing SMB at 10 h; colchicine inhibited cell growth at concentrations higher than 30 nm, whereas KXO1 only decreased cell viability at 10,000 nm. Overall, KXO1 exhibited no toxicity to cells after washout at concentrations below 3000 nm, consistent with its observed low toxicity in clinical studies. We further investigated the mechanism underlying the difference in reversibility between colchicine and KXO1 inhibition by detecting the binding of compounds to purified tubulin following our previously published method (29Yang J.

Purified tubulin (25 μm) was incubated with 20 μm colchicine or 20 μm KXO1 for 1 h and then washed three times by ultrafiltration. Compounds in the filtrate and retentate were detected using high-performance LC (HPLC). As shown in Fig. 6A, 20 μm colchicine and 20 μm KXO1 were detectable by HPLC in controls. After ultrafiltration, we were able to detect almost the same amount of KXO1 in the filtrate as in the control group, whereas there was almost no detectable colchicine (Fig. 6B). By contrast, colchicine, but not KXO1, was detected in the retentate (Fig. 6C). This suggests that KXO1 can be easily washed from tubulin, as almost all KXO1 was detached from tubulin after washing three times, implying that KXO1 binds to purified tubulin in a totally reversible manner. Tubulin inhibitors are a major class of chemotherapy drugs for the treatment of cancer; examples include docetaxel, eribulin, and cabazitaxel (30van Vuuren R.J. Visagie M.H. Theron A.E. Joub"

The recent advent of large-scale culturing methods, and in particular that of culturomics have demonstrated that these prokaryotes can in fact be cultured. This is increasing in a dramatic manner the repertoire of commensal microbes inhabiting the human gut. Following eight years of culturomics approach applied on more than 900 samples, we propose herein a remake of the pioneering study applying a dual approach including culturomics and metagenomics on a cohort of 8 healthy specimen. Here we show that culturomics enable a 20% higher richness when compared to molecular approaches by culturing 1 archaeal species and 494 bacterial species of which 19 were new taxa. Species discovered as a part of previous culturomics studies represent 30% of the cultivated isolates, while sequences derived from these new taxa enabled to increase by 22% the bacterial richness retrieved by metagenomics. Overall, 67% of the total reads generated were covered by cultured isolates, significantly reducing the hidden content of sequencing methods compared to the pioneering study. By redefining culture conditions to recover microbes previously considered fastidious, there are greater opportunities than ever to eradicate metagenomics dark matter."

Our data indicate that CAR T-cells do not express sLeX and do not bind E-selectin. However, enforced sLeX display can be achieved on human CAR T-cells by surface fucosylation, with resultant robust E-selectin binding under hemodynamic shear. Importantly, following intravascular administration into mice, fucosylated human CAR-T cells infiltrate marrow with 10-fold higher efficiency than do unfucosylated cells.

https://openalex.org/W2981293123,"This secondary analysis explored the association between gestational weight gain, pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI), and prenatal diet quality in a United States national sample. The sample comprised 1322 pregnant women in the longitudinal Infant Feeding Practices Study II with Diet History Questionnaire data. Diet quality in the third trimester was assessed using the Alternative Healthy Eating Index for Pregnancy. Self-reported pre-pregnancy BMI (categorized as underweight<18.5, normal weight 18.5–24.9, overweight 25.0–29.9, and obese≥30.0) and total gestational weight gain were used to categorize adherence to the Institute of Medicine’s recommendations as inadequate, adequate, or excessive weight gain. Diet quality in pre-pregnancy BMI and gestational weight gain groups were compared using Tukey-adjusted generalized linear models adjusted for sociodemographic factors, Women, Infants, and Children participation, parity, and energy intake. Due to missing gestational weight gain data, sensitivity analyses with multiply imputed data were conducted. Women were on average 28.9 years old and of higher socioeconomic status (40% college graduates) and mostly non-Hispanic White (84%), and the mean Alternative Healthy Eating Index for Pregnancy score was 61.2 (of 130). Both pre-pregnancy BMI and gestational weight gain were inversely associated with diet quality scores (p<0.01). The interaction between pre-pregnancy BMI and gestational weight gain was significant (p = 0.04), therefore gestational weight gain models were stratified by BMI group. In stratified adjusted models, gestational weight gain was differently associated with diet quality scores (p<0.05) among women with underweight, normal weight, overweight, and obesity. The relationship between gestational weight gain and prenatal diet quality depended on pre-pregnancy BMI. For example, within women with normal weight, higher diet quality was observed in the adequate gestational weight gain group. Interventions to broadly improve prenatal diet quality are needed, however, resources can be used to target women with higher pre-pregnancy BMIs and women with inadequate or excessive gestational weight gain."
https://openalex.org/W2980822654,"The gut bacteria of insects positively influence the physiology of their host, however, the dynamics of this complicated ecosystem are not fully clear. To improve our understanding, we characterized the gut prokaryotic of Henosepilachna vigintioctopunctata that fed on two host plants, Solanum melongena (referred to as QZ hereafter) and Solanum nigrum (referred to as LK hereafter), by sequencing the V3-V4 hypervariable region of the 16S rRNA gene using the Illumina MiSeq system. The results revealed that the gut bacterial composition varied between specimens that fed on different host plants. The unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean analyses and principal coordinate analysis showed that the bacterial communities of the LK and QZ groups were distinct. Four phyla (Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Actinobacteria) were present in all H. vigintioctopunctata gut samples. It is noteworthy that bacteria of the phylum Cyanobacteria were only found in the LK group, with a low relative abundance. Proteobacteria and Enterobacteriaceae were the predominant phylum and family, respectively, in both the LK and QZ groups. Linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) analyses showed that the QZ group enriched the Bacilli class and Lactococcus genus; while the LK group enriched the Alphaproteobacteria class and Ochrobactrum genus. PICRUSt analysis showed that genes predicted to be involved in xenobiotic biodegradation and metabolism, metabolism of other amino acids, signaling molecules, and interaction were significantly higher in the QZ group. Genes predicted to be involved in the metabolism of cofactors and vitamins were significantly higher in the LK group. Furthermore, the complexity of the network structure and the modularity were higher in the LK group than in the QZ group. This is the first study to characterize the gut bacteria of H. vigintioctopunctat, our results demonstrate that the two host plants tested had a considerable impact on bacterial composition in the gut of H. vigintioctopunctata and that the bacterial communities were dominated by relatively few taxa."
https://openalex.org/W2980891695,"The invasive parasitic fly, Philornis downsi (Muscidae), is one of the greatest threats to the avifauna of the Galapagos Islands. The larvae of this fly feed on the blood and tissues of developing nestlings of at least 18 endemic and native birds. The aim of the current study was to investigate biotic and abiotic factors that may influence the population dynamics of this invasive parasite. To study the influence of vegetation zone and related climatic factors on fly numbers, a bi-weekly monitoring program using papaya-baited traps was carried out at a dry, lowland site and at a humid, highland site on Santa Cruz Island between 2012–2014. Female flies, a large proportion of which were inseminated and gravid, were collected throughout the year at both sites, indicating females were active during and between the bird breeding seasons. This is the first evidence that female flies are able to persist even when hosts are scarce. On the other hand, catch rates of male flies declined between bird breeding seasons. Overall, catch rates of P. downsi were higher in the drier, lowland habitat, which may be a consequence of host or resource availability. Time was a stronger predictor of adult fly numbers than climate, further suggesting that P. downsi does not appear to be limited by its environment, but rather by host availability. Seasonal catch rates suggested that populations in both habitats were continuous and multivoltine. Numbers of adult female flies appeared to be regulated chiefly by simple direct density dependence, and may be governed by availability of bird nests with nestlings. Nevertheless, confounding factors such as the existence of reservoir hosts that perpetuate fly populations and changes in behavior of P. downsi may increase the vulnerability of bird hosts that are already IUCN red-listed or in decline."

Increased homocysteine (Hcy), a feature of hyperhomocysteinemia, is correlated with advanced vascular calcification and phenotypic switching of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Oxidative stress and high phosphate levels also induce VSMC calcification, suggesting that the Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) signaling pathway may also contribute to vascular calcification. In this study, we investigated this possibility and the role and mechanisms of Hcy in vascular calcification. We found that in atherosclerotic apolipoprotein E–deficient (ApoE−/−) mice, Hcy significantly increases vascular calcification in vivo, as well as VSMC calcification in vitro. Of note, the Hcy-induced VSMC calcification was correlated with elevated KLF4 levels. Hcy promoted KLF4 expression in calcified atherosclerotic lesions in vivo and in calcified VSMCs in vitro. shRNA-mediated KLF4 knockdown blocked the Hcy-induced up-regulation of runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) and VSMC calcification. RUNX2 inhibition abolished Hcy-induced VSMC calcification. Using ChIP analysis, we demonstrate that KLF4 interacts with RUNX2, an interaction promoted by Hcy stimulation. Our experiments also revealed that the KLF4 knockdown attenuates Hcy-induced RUNX2 transactivity, indicating that KLF4 is important in modulating RUNX2 transactivity. These findings support a role for Hcy in regulating vascular calcification through a KLF4–RUNX2 interaction and indicate that Hcy-induced, enhanced RUNX2 transactivity increases VSMC calcification. These insights reveal possible opportunities for developing interventions that prevent or manage vascular calcification.

AMPARs mediate the majority of fast transmission, whereas NMDARs are responsible for synaptic plasticity. KARs are expressed in subsets of neuronal types in the brain. They not only contribute to excitatory postsynaptic currents on postsynaptic cells; they also regulate neurotransmitter release on the presynaptic terminal (2Lerma J. Marques J.M.

Ionotropic glutamate receptors are tetramers.

Among these domains, the NTD is the largest, but its function, until recently, has been poorly understood.

The differential trafficking properties and dependence on Netos between GluK1 and GluK2 rely on their NTDs (11Sheng N. Shi Y.S. Nicoll R.A.

Here we find that GluK2NTD specifically binds the CUB1 domain of Neto proteins. In addition, GluK2 without NTD (GluK2_core) can still bind to Neto proteins with or without the CUB1 domain. The effects of NTD-CUB1 and core-Neto interactions on GluK2 gating, including desensitization, deactivation, and recovery from desensitization, are systemically studied. Our data suggest a two-step model for Neto regulation of KAR gating and emphasize an important regulatory role for the NTD-CUB1 interaction.

To test this hypothesis, we expressed the NTD of GluK2 by introducing a stop codon at position 401; thus, the NTD (residues 31–400) will be synthesized through the secretory ER pathway under the guidance of the signal peptide. To facilitate its detection, an HA tag was inserted after the signal peptide, and a FLAG epitope was inserted at the C termini of Netos. Consistent with our prediction, GluK2NTD was co-immunoprecipitated with Neto proteins (Fig. 1, A and B). We also observed that GluK2ΔNTD, in which the NTD was deleted, co-immunoprecipitated with Netos (Fig. 1, A and B), indicating that GluK2 interacts with Netos through multiple sites. In Netos, two CUB domains and an LDLa domain are located extracellularly. Which of these domains might interact with GluK2NTD? Because the NTD is the distal extracellular domain of KARs and is about 80 Å above the membrane plane (30Meyerson J.R. Chittori S. Merk A. Rao P. Han T.H. Serpe M. Mayer M.L. Subramaniam S. Structural basis of kainate subtype glutamate receptor desensitization.Nature. 2016; 537 (27580033): 567-57110.1038/nature19352Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), it is reasonable to suspect that the very distal CUB1 domain of Netos might interact with GluK2NTD. Indeed, GluK2NTD was efficiently co-immunoprecipitated with Neto1CUB1 or Neto2CUB1 (Fig. 1C). Meanwhile, GluK2ΔNTD was pulled down by Neto1/2ΔCUB1 (Fig. 1D), indicating a second interaction, which we named as the core-Neto interaction. Furthermore, deletion of CUB1 domains largely diminished Neto interaction with GluK2NTD (Fig. 1, E–G), suggesting that GluK2NTD specifically interacts with the CUB1 domains of Neto proteins. Thus, our observation suggested that GluK2 bind Netos through at least two interaction sites, the NTD-CUB1 interaction and the core-Neto interaction (Fig. 1H). Previous work demonstrated that NTD-truncated GluK2 receptors are functional (10Plested A.J. Mayer M.L. Structure and mechanism of kainate receptor modulation by anions.Neuron. 2007; 53 (17359918): 829-84110.1016/j.neuron.2007.02.025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). We thus used GluK2ΔNTD to study Neto related gating (Fig. S1A). Western blot analysis from cell lysate showed a similar expression level of GluK2ΔNTD and intact GluK2 receptors (Fig. S1B). Surface biotinylation revealed that the surface expression of GluK2 receptors was unaffected by NTD truncation (Fig. S1B). Furthermore, immunofluorescence experiments examining an HA tag inserted at N termini of full-length and NTD-deleted GluK2 showed that GluK2ΔNTD could express and traffic to the plasma membrane like full-length GluK2 receptors (Fig. S1C). Together, these observations suggest that the NTD is not required for GluK2 expression and membrane trafficking. We then tested the effects of NTD truncation on gating kinetics by applying a saturating concentration of glutamate (10 mm) to outside-out patches excised from the transfected HEK cells using a fast piezoelectric system (25Zhang W. St-Gelais F. Grabner C.P. Trinidad J.C. Sumioka A. Morimoto-Tomita M. Kim K.S. Straub C. Burlingame A.L. Howe J.R. Tomita S.

The desensitization kinetics recorded by 500-ms application of glutamate displayed no difference between full-length and NTD-deleted GluK2 receptors (Fig. 2A and Fig. S2A). Similarly, the deactivation kinetics recorded by brief application (1 ms) of 10 mm glutamate was unchanged by NTD truncation (Fig. 3A and Fig. S2B). These observations are consistent with previous reports (10Plested A.J. Mayer M.L. Structure and mechanism of kainate receptor modulation by anions.Neuron. 2007; 53 (17359918): 829-84110.1016/j.neuron.2007.02.025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), suggesting that the NTD itself has little effect on the deactivation and desensitization kinetics of KARs.Figure 3Neto regulation on GluK2 deactivation.

Similarly, Neto1 speeds and Neto2 slows GluK2 desensitization when overexpressed in hippocampal CA1 neurons (11Sheng N. Shi Y.S. Nicoll R.A. Amino-terminal domains of kainate receptors determine the differential dependence on Neto auxiliary subunits for trafficking.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2017; 114 (28100490): 1159-116410.1073/pnas.1619253114Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Here, we found in HEK cells that Neto2 dramatically slows the desensitization of GluK2 by ∼4 times, whereas Neto1 has little effect (Fig. 2, A and B), indicating that Neto1 and Neto2 differentially regulate GluK2 desensitization. Interestingly, in the absence of NTD, GluK2ΔNTD was slightly slowed by both Neto1 and Neto2 (Fig. 2C) to a similar extent. When CUB1 domains of Netos were removed, GluK2 desensitization was not changed by Neto1ΔCUB1 or Neto2ΔCUB1 (Fig. 2D). Furthermore, GluK2ΔNTD desensitization was similarly slowed by Neto1ΔCUB1 and Neto2ΔCUB1 (Fig. 2E). These results thus demonstrated that the differential regulation of GluK2 desensitization by Neto1 and Neto2 relies on the NTD-CUB1 interaction. In addition, in the cases of ΔNTD (Fig. 2C), ΔCUB1 (Fig. 2D), and ΔNTD + ΔCUB1 (Fig. 2E), conditions in which NTD-CUB1 interactions were disrupted, KAR desensitization was generally slowed by Netos, indicating that the core-Neto interactions slow desensitization. Comparing the Neto effects on desensitization in Fig. 2B and those in Fig. 2 (C–E) leads to the conclusion that NTD-Neto1CUB1 speeds KAR desensitization and NTD-Neto2CUB1 slows it. We further studied the Neto regulatory effects on GluK2 deactivation. Neto2 but not Neto1 slowed GluK2 deactivation (Fig. 3A and Fig. S2B). Whereas the NTD was removed, GluK2ΔNTD was moderately slowed by Neto1 and Neto2 to a similar extent (Fig. 3C). When CUB1 domains were deleted, GluK2 deactivation was slightly slowed by Neto1ΔCUB1 and not by Neto2ΔCUB1 (Fig. 3D), but the effects of Neto1ΔCUB1 and Neto2ΔCUB1 were not significantly different. Furthermore, GluK2ΔNTD deactivation was slowed by Neto1ΔCUB1 and Neto2ΔCUB1 to similar extent (Fig. 3E). The results thus revealed that the different effects of Neto1 and Neto2 on GluK2 deactivation rely on the NTD-CUB1 interaction. Also, as with the desensitization data, it can be concluded that the core-Neto interactions slow deactivation in general. Taken together, these data revealed that the NTD-CUB1 interaction is critical for Neto1/2 modulation of GluK2 fast gating kinetics. Deletion of NTDs of AMPA receptors facilitates their recovery from desensitization (7Möykkynen T. Coleman S.K. Semenov A. Keinänen K. The N-terminal domain modulates α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor desensitization.J. Biol.

The recovery rate of full-length and NTD-deleted GluK2 receptors was monitored through a pair of glutamate (10 mm for 50 ms) applications with variable intervals. GluK2 receptors completely recovered from desensitization in seconds with a τrec value of 2.62 ± 0.54 s, similar to previous reports (25Zhang W. St-Gelais F. Grabner C.P. Trinidad J.C. Sumioka A. Morimoto-Tomita M. Kim K.S. Straub C. Burlingame A.L. Howe J.R. Tomita S.

NTD truncation dramatically sped up this process by about 3 times (τrec = 0.91 ± 0.23 s) (Fig. 4 (A and B) and Fig. S3). These data thus suggest that the NTDs of KARs strongly inhibit the recovery from desensitization. When GluK2 was coexpressed with Neto1 or Neto2, the recovery from desensitization were facilitated (Fig. 4C), consistent with previous reports (25Zhang W. St-Gelais F. Grabner C.P. Trinidad J.C.

This study investigated soil properties and bacterial communities of both rhizosphere and bulk soils of Caragana microphylla from four sites with different aridity indices, and one site with three different types of dunes. All sites were located in the desert regions of northern China. The results indicated that compared with the bulk soil, the soil nutrient content of rhizosphere, especially the content of total phosphorus, was generally significantly improved in different desertification environments. The bacterial richness and diversity were also higher than those of bulk soil, especially in arid regions and fixed dunes. Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, and Acidobacteria were the most dominant phyla in all samples. The regression analyses showed that at different sites, soil total organic C, total N, Na+, and total P played key roles in determining the bacterial community structure while total organic carbon, electronic conductivity, pH and total phosphorus were the dominant factors at the different dunes. The results further revealed that the dominant phyla strongly affected by environmental factors at different sites were Acidobacteria, Gemmatimonadetes, and Actinobacteria among which, Acidobacteria and Gemmatimonadetes were negatively correlated with Na+ content. At different types of dunes, Actinobacteria, Planctomycetes, and Gemmatimonadetes were particularly affected by environmental factors. The increased abundance of Actinobacteria in the rhizosphere soil was mainly caused by the decreased soil pH."
https://openalex.org/W2981605510,"This study was designed to evaluate cardiac and respiratory dysfunction in a mouse model of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy i.e., SUDEP. We simultaneously monitored respiration via plethysmography and the electrocardiogram via telemetry before, during, and after an audiogenic seizure. DBA/1 mice responded to an acoustic stimulus with one or two cycles of circling and jumping before entering a clonic/tonic seizure. This was followed by death unless the mice were resuscitated by mechanical ventilation using room air. During the initial clonic phase, respiration declined and cardiac rhythm is slowed. By the tonic phase, respiration had ceased, atrial P-waves were absent or dissociated from the QRS complex, and heart rate had decreased from 771±11 to 252±16 bpm. Heart rate further deteriorated terminating in asystole unless the mice were resuscitated at the end of the tonic phase which resulted in abrupt recovery of P-waves and a return to normal sinus rhythm, associated with gasping. Interestingly, P-waves were preserved in the mice treated with methylatropine during the pre-ictal period (to block parasympathetic stimulation) and heart rate remained unchanged through the end of the tonic phase (765±8 vs. 748±21 bpm), but as in control, methylatropine treated mice died from respiratory arrest. These results demonstrate that a clonic/tonic seizure in the DBA/1 mouse results in abrupt and simultaneous respiratory and cardiac depression. Although death clearly results from respiratory arrest, our results suggest that seizure activates two central nervous system pathways in this model—one inhibits respiratory drive, whereas the other inhibits cardiac function via vagal efferents. The abrupt and simultaneous recovery of both respiration and cardiac function with mechanical ventilation within an early post-ictal timeframe shows that the vagal discharge can be rapidly terminated. Understanding the central mechanism associated with the abrupt cardiorespiratory dysfunction and equally abrupt recovery may provide clues for therapeutic targets for SUDEP."

SSLs represent a large biomass, likely involved in the biological carbon pump and the structure of marine trophic webs. Yet, the taxonomic composition remains largely unknown for many SSLs. To investigate the challenges of SSL sampling, we performed a survey in a small study area in the Northern Bay of Biscay (France) by combining broadband and narrowband acoustics, net sampling, imagery and video recordings. In order to identify organisms contributing to the observed SSLs, we compared measured frequency spectra to forward predicted spectra derived from biological data. Furthermore, to assess the confidence in SSL characterization, we evaluated uncertainties in modeling, acoustical and biological samplings. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that SSL backscattering intensity in the Bay of Biscay can be dominated in springtime by resonant gas bearing organisms below 100 kHz, namely siphonophores and juvenile fishes and by pteropods at higher frequencies. Thus, we demonstrate the importance of broadband acoustics combined to nets, imagery and video to characterize resonant backscatterers and mixed mesozooplankton assemblages."

The miR-17/92 cluster is involved in the molecular etiology of the SCLL syndrome driven by the BCR-FGFR1 chimeric kinase.Oncogene. 2018; 37 (10.1038/s41388-017-0091-1, 29367757): 1926-1938Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). fibroblast growth factor receptor stem cell leukemia/lymphoma acute myeloid leukemia microRNA chronic myeloid leukemia hematopoietic stem cell DNA methyltransferase quantitative PCR acute lymphoblastic leukemia. miR-150-5p appears to be differentially expressed during normal hematopoiesis and is frequently deregulated in various types of hematological malignancies (10He Y. Jiang X. Chen J. The role of miR150 in normal and malignant hematopoiesis.Oncogene. 2014; 33 (10.1038/onc.2013.346, 23955084): 3887-3893Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Down-regulation of miR-150-5p has also been reported in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and lymphoma (10He Y. Jiang X. Chen J. The role of miR150 in normal and malignant hematopoiesis.Oncogene. 2014; 33 (10.1038/onc.2013.346, 23955084): 3887-3893Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), and up-regulation has been reported in myelodysplastic syndrome and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (10He Y. Jiang X. Chen J. The role of miR150 in normal and malignant hematopoiesis.Oncogene. 2014; 33 (10.1038/onc.2013.346, 23955084): 3887-3893Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). miR-150-5p is thought to control development of the myeloid lineage by fine-tuning the transcription factor Myb and its downstream products (11Xiao C. Calado D.P. Galler G. Thai T.H. Patterson H.C. Wang J. Rajewsky N. Bender T.P. Rajewsky K. MiR-150 controls B cell differentiation by targeting the transcription factor c-Myb.Cell. 2007; 131 (10.1016/j.cell.2007.07.021, 17923094): 146-159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar), promoting differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Here we demonstrate that miR-150-5p expression is silenced by promoter methylation by Dnmt1, which is highly up-regulated in SCLL cells as a result of FGFR1-driven up-regulation of Myc. Constitutive FGFR1 expression in SCLL, therefore, appears to drive up-regulation of Myb through a cascade of intermediate steps, and pharmacological inhibition of Myb in these cells suppresses cell growth in vitro and leukemia progression in vivo. As part of our analysis of miRNAs regulated by FGFR1 in cells derived from BCR-FGFR1 transformed mouse hematopoietic stem cells (BBC2), we identified an association between the presence of activated FGFR1 kinase and down-regulation of miR-150-5p (8Hu T. Chong Y. Qin H. Kitamura E. Chang C.-S. Silva J. Ren M. Cowell J.K. The miR-17/92 cluster is involved in the molecular etiology of the SCLL syndrome driven by the BCR-FGFR1 chimeric kinase.Oncogene. 2018; 37 (10.1038/s41388-017-0091-1, 29367757): 1926-1938Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). To expand this analysis, we compared other SCLL cell lines with their normal cell counterparts isolated from the spleens of normal mice. BBC2 cells are arrested in a pre/pro-B cell stage (14Ren M. Tidwell J.A. Sharma S. Cowell J.K. Acute progression of BCR-FGFR1 induced murine B-lympho/myeloproliferative disorder suggests involvement of lineages at the pro-B Cell Stage.PLoS ONE. 2012; 7 (10.1371/journal.pone.0038265, 22701616): e38265Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and were compared with B220+/IgM− cells isolated from normal spleen. ZNF112 cells, derived from stem cells transformed with ZMYM2-FGFR1 (15Ren M. Li X. Cowell J.K. Genetic fingerprinting of the development and progression of T-cell lymphoma in a murine model of atypical myeloproliferative disorder initiated by the ZNF198-FGFR1 chimeric tyrosine kinase.Blood. 2009; 114 (10.1182/blood-2009-03-212704, 19506298): 1576-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), exhibit a CD4+/CD8+ immunophenotype and were compared with double-positive T cells from normal spleen. BCRF8C was derived from NSG hematopoietic stem cells and shows a Sca1+ immunophenotype (7Silva J. Chang C.-S. Hu T. Qin H. Kitamura E. Hawthorn L. Ren M. Cowell J.K. Distinct signaling programs associated with progression of FGFR1 driven leukemia in a mouse model of stem cell leukemia lymphoma syndrome.Genomics. 2018; (10.1016/j.ygeno.2018.10.015, 30439482)Google Scholar). Normal Sca1+ cells were isolated from normal mouse bone marrow. KG1 cells (16Furley A.J. Reeves B.R. Mizutani S. Altass L.J. Watt S.M. Jacob M.C. van den Elsen P. Terhorst C. Greaves M.F. Divergent molecular phenotypes of KG1 and KG1a myeloid cell lines.Blood. 1986; 68 (10.1182/blood.V68.5.1101.1101, 3094604): 1101-1107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were derived from a human AML patient and express the FGFR1OP2-FGFR1 chimeric kinase. As controls for this human cell line, we used human-derived mononuclear cells. As shown in Fig. 1A, the expression levels of miR-150-5p in these four cells lines was reduced significantly (>95%) compared with their normal cell counterparts. When the same cell lines were treated with the BGJ389 FGFR1 inhibitor (17Wu Q. Bhole A. Qin H. Karp J. Malek S. Cowell J.K. Ren M. Targeting FGFR1 to suppress leukemogenesis in syndromic and de novo AML in murine models.Oncotarget. 2016; 7 (27391347): 49733-49742Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), miR-150-5p expression levels were highly up-regulated in all cases (Fig. 1B). The miRNA levels in primary SCLL cells developed in syngeneic hosts using the transduction and transplantation approach described previously (15Ren M. Li X. Cowell J.K. Genetic fingerprinting of the development and progression of T-cell lymphoma in a murine model of atypical myeloproliferative disorder initiated by the ZNF198-FGFR1 chimeric tyrosine kinase.Blood. 2009; 114 (10.1182/blood-2009-03-212704, 19506298): 1576-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) also showed that miR-150-5p levels were significantly reduced in spleen-derived cells from diseased mice (n = 3) from both BCR-FGFR1 and ZMYM2-FGFR1 (Fig. 1C) transformed stem cells compared with normal spleen cells (n = 3). It appears, therefore, that the high-level expression of FGFR1 in SCLL cells correlates with low-level expression of miR-150-5p both in vitro and in vivo and that pharmacological suppression of FGFR1 function leads directly to increased miR-150-5p expression levels. In contrast, a housekeeping miRNA, Let-7a, shows no difference in levels in these comparisons (Fig. S1), supporting the specificity of the observations for miR-150-5p. To investigate the effect of miR-150-5p on cell viability, we overexpressed miR-150-5p in mouse BBC2 and human KG1 cells (Fig. 1D). When miR-150-5p expression levels were analyzed in BBC2 cells, there was a >600-fold increase compared with parental cells transduced with the empty vector, which led to reduced (∼35%) viability (Fig. 1, D and E), a reduced percentage of cells in G2/M, and an increase in Annexin V–positive cells in overexpressing cells (Fig. S2). The same effects were seen in KG1 cells overexpressing miR-150-5p (Fig. 1E and Fig. S2). Thus, it appears that increased apoptosis is one of the consequences of high-level miR-150-5p expression. The Myb gene is one of the known targets of miR-150-5p in both humans and mice (11Xiao C. Calado D.P. Galler G. Thai T.H. Patterson H.C. Wang J. Rajewsky N. Bender T.P. Rajewsky K. MiR-150 controls B cell differentiation by targeting the transcription factor c-Myb.Cell. 2007; 131 (10.1016/j.cell.2007.07.021, 17923094): 146-159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar, 18Lin Y.C. Kuo M.W. Yu J. Kuo H.H. Lin R.J. Lo W.L. Yu A.L. c-Myb is an evolutionary conserved miR-150 target and miR-150/c-Myb interaction is important for embryonic development.Mol. Biol. Evol. 2008; 25 (10.1093/molbev/msn165, 18667440): 2189-2198Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2A and Fig. S3, there are highly conserved target sites in the murine Myb 3′ UTR with homology to miR-150-5p. Overexpression of miR-150-5p in BBC2 cells shows a significant down-regulation of Myb (Fig. 2B), supporting the idea that miR-150-5p may affect SCLL progression through regulation of Myb expression. Analysis of spleen cells from syngeneic mice transplanted with BCR-FGFR1–transduced hematopoietic stem cells (Fig. 2C) confirms up-regulation of Myb in in vivo models. Similarly, there are conserved target sites in the human MYB gene (Fig. 2D), and overexpression of miR-150-5p in human KG1 SCLL cells (Fig. 2E) shows significantly reduced MYB levels. In human cell SCLL models in NSG mice transplanted with BCR-FGFR1–transduced human CD34+ cells, MYB is also up-regulated (Fig. 2F). Thus, it appears that expression of the FGFR1 chimeric kinases leads to Myb activation in SCLL cells by down-regulating miR-150-5p in vivo as well as in vitro. To investigate the mechanism underlying the down-regulation of miR-150-5p in SCLL cells, we analyzed the promoter region in BBC2 and KG1 cells (Fig. 3A). There are fewer CpG dinucleotides in the murine promoter region compared with the human promoter. We designed primers to investigate the methylation status of promoter regions with the highest density of CpGs, as shown in Fig. 3A, and compared mouse normal CD19+IgM− flow-sorted cells from the spleen with BBC2 cells. Human peripheral mononuclear cells were used as the normal counterpart for human KG1 AML cells. Following bisulfite conversion of DNA from both cell lines and controls, the miR-150-5p promoter regions were PCR-amplified and cloned into the pGEM-T Easy vector. Sanger sequencing of randomly selected individual clones identified methylated CpG sites. As seen in Fig. 3B, there was limited methylation in either promoter region from the normal cells. In contrast, extensive methylation was seen throughout the promoter region in both cell lines, suggesting a mechanism for miR-150-5p silencing. When BBC2 and KG1 cells were treated with the 5′-azacytidine methylation inhibitor, compared with DMSO-treated cells, there is a dose-dependent increase in miR-150-5p expression levels in both cell lines, demonstrating the functional relationship between methylation in the miR-150-5p promoter and its expression levels (Fig. 3C). To investigate the relationship between methylation in the miR-150-5p promoter and clinical parameters in leukemic samples, we retrospectively analyzed the GSE 38235 dataset from the GEO (19Busche S. Ge B. Vidal R. Spinella J.F. Saillour V. Richer C. Healy J. Chen S.-H. Droit A. Sinnett D. Pastinen T. Integration of high-resolution methylome and transcriptome analyses to dissect epigenomic changes in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia.Cancer Res. 2013; 73 (10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-12-4367, 23722552): 4323-4336Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), which compared the methylome and transcriptome between matched pre-B-ALL tumor samples containing high levels of leukemic blasts and blast-free remission samples from 46 patients. The methylation data for the miR-150-5p promoter showed a highly significant reduction in methylation levels in the remission samples compared with their tumor counterparts (Fig. 3D), supporting the correlation between inactivation of miR-150-5p and increased aggressiveness of this leukemia. Because methylation status is determined by the action of proteins such as those in the DNMT and ten-eleven translocation families, we analyzed RNA-Seq data generated from the SCLL cell lines BBC2, ZNF112, BCRF8C, and KG1. In each case, there was consistent high-level expression of Dnmt1. When the data for these four cell lines were combined (Fig. 4A), the selective up-regulation of Dnmt1 was confirmed. In a comparison of BBC2 with normal CD19+IgM− pre/pro-B cells, KG1 with PBMCs, CEP2A and ZNF112 cells with normal CD4+CD8+ cells, increased Dnmt1 levels were seen in all cases of SCLL (Fig. 4B). Similarly, analysis of splenic cells derived from mouse stem cells transformed with BCR-FGFR1 showed increased levels of Dnmt1 compared with normal spleen cells (Fig. 4C). Consistently, analysis of leukemic cells derived from BCR-FGFR1–transformed human CD34+ cord blood cells transplanted into immunocompromised mice (NSG) also showed increased Dnmt1 protein levels. Analysis of expression and protein levels in four different SCLL cell lines after treatment with the BGJ398, FGFR1 inhibitor showed a significant reduction in Dnmt1 expression levels (Fig. 4D). Down-regulation of Dnmt1 using shRNA (Fig. 4E) showed a proportional increase in miR-150-5p expression levels and increased Myb levels. These data suggest that methylation of the miR-150-5p promoter and, hence, silencing of its expression are mediated by Dnmt1, which is a consequence of FGFR1 activation. It has been shown that MYC is one of the transcription factors that regulates DNMT1 expression (20Poole C.J. Zheng W. Lodh A. Yevtodiyenko A. Liefwalker D. Li H. Felsher D.W. van Riggelen J. DNMT3B overexpression contributes to aberrant DNA methylation and MYC-driven tumor maintenance in T-ALL and Burkitt's lymphoma.Oncotarget. 2017; 8 (29100357): 76898-76920Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and we have shown previously that FGFR1 up-regulates Myc in SCLL cells (13Hu T. Wu Q. Chong Y. Qin H. Poole C.J. van Riggelen J. Ren M. Cowell J.K. FGFR1 fusion kinase regulation of MYC expression drives development of stem cell leukemia/lymphoma syndrome.Leukemia. 2018; 32 (10.1038/s41375-018-0124-y, 29720732): 2363-2373Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In a ChIP-qPCR analysis of the Dnmt1 promoter regions in mouse BBC2 and ZNF112 cells as well as human KG1 cells, a significantly increased level of occupancy was seen in reported Myc-binding regions (20Poole C.J. Zheng W. Lodh A. Yevtodiyenko A. Liefwalker D. Li H. Felsher D.W. van Riggelen J. DNMT3B overexpression contributes to aberrant DNA methylation and MYC-driven tumor maintenance in T-ALL and Burkitt's lymphoma.Oncotarget. 2017; 8 (29100357): 76898-76920Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5A and Fig. S4). Knockdown of Myc in BBC2 cells (Fig. 5B) using shRNAs showed a concomitant reduction in Dnmt1 expression levels. Analysis of miR-150-5p expression in these cells showed a consequential proportional increase in expression levels, supporting the suggestion that Myc, which is up-regulated by FGFR1, in turn leads to activation of Dnmt1 and epigenetic silencing of miR-150-5p. Down-regulation of Myc also leads to reduced Myb expression levels, demonstrating that Myc cooperates with Myb to promote SCLL syndrome via Dnmt1-mediated epigenetic silencing of miR-150-5p. Myc has been shown to activate Myb by inducing epigenetic silencing of miR-150-5p, which normally suppresses Myb expression. It appears, therefore, that Myb up-regulation is important in SCLL development and that its expression is a direct consequence of FGFR1 activation. To investigate the role of Myb in SCLL cell survival, we treated SCLL cells with mebendazole, which has been shown to lead to Myb degradation (21Walf-Vorderwülbecke V. Pearce K. Brooks T. Hubank M. van den Heuvel-Eibrink M.M. Zwaan C.M. Adams S. Edwards D. Bartram J. Samarasinghe S. Ancliff P. Khwaja A. Goulden N. Williams G. de Boer J. Williams O. Targeting acute myeloid leukemia by drug-induced c-MYB degradation.Leukemia. 2018; 32 (10.1038/leu.2017.317, 29089643): 882-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). When BBC2, ZNF112, and KG1 cells were treated with mebendazole (Fig. S5), there was a dose-dependent reduction in cell viability in all three cell lines, supporting an active role of Myb in SCLL development. Consistently, when Myb was inactivated in BBC2 cells using shRNAs (Fig. 6A), there was a significant reduction in cell viability and proliferation compared with treatment with a scrambled shRNA (Fig. 6B). Mebendazole inactivation of Myb inactivation in BBC2 and KG1 cells (Fig. 6C) led to up-regulation of p21, demonstrating withdrawal from the cell cycle and a reduction in the levels of survivin, which normally reduces apoptosis. Consistent with protein expression changes, flow cytometric analysis demonstrated that mebendazole treatment of SCLL cells reduced progression through the cell cycle and led to significantly increased ratios of Annexin V+ cells among both BBC2 and KG1 (Fig. 5) cells compared with vehicle-only-treated cells, demonstrating increased apoptosis. To evaluate the role of Myb on SCLL progression in vivo, we treated mice that had been transplanted with BCR-FGFR1–transformed HSCs with an oral suspension of mebendazole using 1 mg/mouse/day for 2 weeks (22Mukhopadhyay T. Sasaki J. Ramesh R. Roth J.A. Mebendazole elicits a potent antitumor effect on human cancer cell lines both in vitro and in vivo.Clin. Cancer Res. 2002; 8 (12231542): 2963-2969PubMed Google Scholar). These cells coexpress GFP from the transduction vector (14Ren M. Tidwell J.A. Sharma S. Cowell J.K. Acute progression of BCR-FGFR1 induced murine B-lympho/myeloproliferative disorder suggests involvement of lineages at the pro-B Cell Stage.PLoS ONE. 2012; 7 (10.1371/journal.pone.0038265, 22701616): e38265Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and flow cytometry can monitor the disease load in these animals during disease development and at autopsy. As shown by the Kaplan-Meier analysis (Fig. 6D), mice treated with mebendazole showed a significant improvement in survival compared with vehicle-treated mice (n = 5). Although there were no effects on body weight, both spleen weight and white blood cell count in peripheral blood were reduced in drug-treated animals (Fig. 6E). This suppression of leukemogenesis was evident from the reduced spleen sizes in treated animals (Fig. 6F) as well as the presence of reduced GFP-positive cells in spleen samples (Fig. 6G). Development of the hematopoietic system is regulated by a dynamic interplay between various transcription factors in response to environmental cues. One way that rapid responses in levels of transcription factors can be regulated is through microRNA-mediated suppression of expression. MicroRNAs have been extensively implicated in normal and abnormal development of hematopoiesis, and miR-150-5p has been shown to be selectively expressed in mature and resting B and T cells but not in their progenitors. The same is true in the stem cell leukemias seen in the SCLL syndrome we describe here, where miR-150-5p is down-regulated in immature T, B, and myeloid leukemic cells compared with high levels in normal cell counterparts. The expression levels of miR-150-5p are also markedly decreased in ALL, AML, and CML compared with healthy controls (10He Y. Jiang X. Chen J. The role of miR150 in normal and malignant hematopoiesis.Oncogene. 2014; 33 (10.1038/onc.2013.346, 23955084): 3887-3893Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Recently, an essential role of miR-150-5p was identified in the pathogenesis of MLL-rearranged AML. Repression of miR-150-5p maturation by MLL fusion genes accelerated leukemogenesis in an MLL/AF9 murine model, and miR-150-5p expression in this model inhibited leukemia cell growth by targeting MYB and FLT3 (23Jiang X. Bugno J. Hu C. Yang Y. Herold T. Qi J. Chen P. Gurbuxani S. Arnovitz S. Strong J. Ferchen K. Ulrich B. Weng H. Wang Y. Huang H. et al.Eradication of acute myeloid leukemia with FLT3 ligand-targeted miR-150-5p nanoparticles.Cancer Res. 2016; 76 (10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-15-2949, 27280396): 4470-4480Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). miR-150-5p is thought to control development of the myeloid lineage by fine-tuning the Myb transcription factor and its downstream products, promoting differentiation of HSCs toward megakaryocytes rather than erythrocytes. Myb is highly expressed in lymphocyte progenitors, down-regulated upon maturation, and again up-regulated after activation of the mature cells. Myb has also been shown to play a critical role in normal development of hematopoietic cells through control of cell cycle progression and differentiation in stem and progenitor cells (10He Y. Jiang X. Chen J. The role of miR150 in normal and malignant hematopoiesis.Oncogene. 2014; 33 (10.1038/onc.2013.346, 23955084): 3887-3893Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Loss of Myb expression in mice results in significantly abnormal development of the hematopoietic system and has also been frequently associated with hematopoietic malignancies (24Pattabiraman D.R. Gonda T.J. Role and potential for therapeutic targeting of MYB in leukemia.Leukemia. 2013; 27 (10.1038/leu.2012.225, 22874877): 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In FGFR1-driven leukemogenesis, we show that Myb is highly expressed in cells from this stem cell leukemia syndrome and that degradation of Myb by either forced expression of miR-150-5p or treatment with mebendazole leads to reduced cell proliferation and increased cell apoptosis, suggesting a tumor promotion role of Myb in this context. The Myc oncogene is frequently overexpressed in leukemias, as we have shown in various SCLL cell models (13Hu T. Wu Q. Chong Y. Qin H. Poole C.J. van Riggelen J. Ren M. Cowell J.K. FGFR1 fusion kinase regulation of MYC expression drives development of stem cell leukemia/lymphoma syndrome.Leukemia. 2018; 32 (10.1038/s41375-018-0124-y, 29720732): 2363-2373Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Inactivation of Myc using the 10058-F4 inhibitor in these cells results in suppression of leukemogenesis in vivo and, in this study, we demonstrate that Myc activation leads to epigenetic silencing of miR-150-5p as a result of direct regulation of the Dnmt1 promoter. Dnmt1 is responsible for maintenance of methylation in the genome through cell division, whereas other members of the family establish methylation marks de novo (25Gujar H. Weisenberger D.J. Liang G. The roles of human DNA methyltransferases and their isoforms in shaping the epigenome.Genes. 2019; 10 (30813436): E172Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Similarly, the ten-eleven translocation family of enzymes is involved in removing epigenetic marks, and, although they are frequently mutated in hematopoietic malignancies (26Solary E. Bernard O.A. Tefferi A. Fuks F. Vainchenker W. The ten-eleven translocation-2 (TET2) gene in hematopoiesis and hematopoietic diseases.Leukemia. 2014; 28 (10.1038/leu.2013.337, 24220273): 485-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), they do not appear to be affected by overexpression of FGFR1. Tumor development is usually the consequence of dysregulation of multiple oncogenes. Here we demonstrate a paradigm that the Myc oncogene activates Myb through epigenetic silencing of miR-150-5p by direct promoter binding and activation of Dnmt1 to promote leukemogenesis in SCLL. There are a number of parallels between chimeric FGFR1-driven leukemias and BCR-ABL1 in CML, which develops as a chronic myeloproliferative disease, that extend to the studies presented here. Transformation of CD34+ cells by various fusion kinases leads to up-regulation of Myc and down-regulation of miR-150-5p, suggesting, in a large correlative study, transformation of CD34+ cells by BCR-ABL1 fusion kinases leads to up-regulation of MYC and MYB, and down-regulation and miR-150-5p, suggesting that MYC and miR-150-5p are associated with MYB expression in CML (27Srutova K. Curik N. Burda P. Savvulidi F. Silvestri G. Trotta R. Klamova H. Pecherkova P. Sovova Z. Koblihova J. Stopka T. Perrotti D. Polakova K.M. BCR-ABL1 mediated miR-150-5p downregulation through MYC contributed to myeloid differentiation block and drug resistance in chronic myeloid leukemia.Haematologica. 2018; 103 (10.3324/haematol.2018.193086, 30049824): 2016-2025Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In that study, MYC reportedly occupied the −11.7 kb and −0.35 kb regulatory regions of the miR-150 promoter, which is in contrast to our observations in SCLL, where we demonstrate that miR-150-5p silencing is mediated by methylation of its promoter by Dnmt1 as a result of Myc activation. This conclusion regarding our mouse SCLL models is supported following our analysis of a human pre-B-ALL patient cohort, comparing samples with disease and in remission, revealing that differential methylation of the miR-150-5p promoter is associated with remission samples. Previous studies showed that targeting SCLL cells with FGFR1 inhibitors, most notably BGJ398, can suppress leukemogenesis in mouse models in vivo and affects cell proliferation in SCLL cell lines in vitro (17Wu Q. Bhole A. Qin H. Karp J. Malek S. Cowell J.K. Ren M. Targeting FGFR1 to suppress leukemogenesis in syndromic and de novo AML in murine models.Oncotarget. 2016; 7 (27391347): 49733-49742Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Through a better understanding of the molecular etiology of FGFR1-driven neoplasms of lymphoid and myeloid origin, we demonstrated that targeting these downstream effects also suppress leukemogenesis to a greater or lesser degree. The identification of miR-150-5p as a silenced tumor suppressor in SCLL provides an additional treatment option to target this pathway. As a proof of concept, there have been attempts to restore miR-150-5p expression not only in solid tumors but also in hematological malignancies (23Jiang X. Bugno J. Hu C. Yang Y. Herold T. Qi J. Chen P. Gurbuxani S. Arnovitz S. Strong J. Ferchen K. Ulrich B. Weng H. Wang Y.

Notably, treatment of FLT3-overexpressing AML with FLT3L-guided miR-150-5p–based nanoparticles shows high selectivity and efficiency and significant inhibition of AML progression (23Jiang X. Bugno J.

Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FBS. Cell viability was measured using the CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega, Madison, WI). To evaluate the effect of methylation on miR-150-5p expression, BBC2 and KG1 cells were treated with 0.3 and 1 μm 2′-deoxy-5-azacytidine for 72 h. For FGFR and Myb inhibition assays, cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of BGJ398 and mebendazole (Selleckchem, Houston, TX) for 24 h, and then cells were harvested for further cellular and molecular analysis. 106 cells were labeled with Hoechst 33342 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) for 1 h at 37 °C, and cell cycle profiles were determined using the BD LSR II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). To measure apoptosis, 106 cells were stained with APC Annexin V and the DNA-binding dye 7-amino-actinomycin (Biolegend, San Diego, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol and analyzed by BD FACSCanto II flow cytometry (BD Biosciences). For overexpression of miR-150-5p, the ∼500-bp fragment including miR-150-5p and flanking sequences was cloned into the pMSCV-PIG vector, and a retrovirus was prepared using the amphotropic packing system as described previously (9Hu T. Chong Y. Lu S. Wang R. Qin H. Silva J. Kitamura E. Chang C.-S. Hawthorn L. Cowell J.K. MicroRNA 339 promotes development of stem cell leukemia/lymphoma syndrome through downregulation of the BCL2L11 and BAX pro-apoptotic genes.Cancer Res. 2018; 78 (29735550): 3522-3531PubMed Google Scholar). For shRNA knockdown, BBC2 cells were transduced with lentiviral particles prepared from clones TRCN225698 and TRCN225699 for shDnmt1, TRCN42513 and TRCN42517 for shMyc, and TRCN42499 and TRCN426969 for shMyb (Sigma) and then selected with 1 μg/ml puromycin to generate stable cell lines. Western blotting, DNA preparation/cloning, RNA extraction, and reverse transcription of mRNA are standard procedures that have been described previously in detail. For miRNA expression quantification, total RNA was reverse-transcribed with the miRNA cDNA Synthesis Kit (Applied Biological Materials Inc., Richmond, BC, Canada), and then standard real-time PCR reactions were performed. For bisulfite Sanger sequencing, bisulfite conversion was performed as described previously (12Hu T. Zhu X. Pi W. Yu M. Shi H. Tuan D. Hypermethylated LTR retrotransposon exhibits enhancer activity.Epigenetics. 2017; 12 (10.1080/15592294.2017.1289300, 28165867): 226-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) using the EZ DNA Methylation-Gold Kit (Zymo Research Corp., Irvine, CA) according to the vendor's protocol. Briefly, 0.5 μg of DNA isolated from target cells was heat-denatured, treated with bisulfite (98 °C for 10 min and then 55 °C for 4 h) to convert unmethylated cytosine to uracil, followed by nested PCR with appropriate PCR primers. The PCR products were cloned into the TA vector, and single colonies were selected for Sanger sequencing (MCLAB, San Francisco, CA). The RNA-Seq data for BGJ398- and DMSO-treated SCLL lines have been described previously (7Silva J. Chang C.-S. Hu T. Qin H. Kitamura E. Hawthorn L. Ren M. Cowell J.K. Distinct signaling programs associated with progression of FGFR1 driven leukemia in a mouse model of stem cell leukemia lymphoma syndrome.Genomics. 2018; (10.1016/j.ygeno.2018.10.015, 30439482)Google Scholar) and deposited into the GEO database (accession number GSE110457). The normalized fragments per kilobase of transcripts per one million mapped reads data were used to evaluate the expression level of DNA methylation–related genes. ChIP assays were performed using a ChIP assay kit (Millipore) as described previously (13Hu T. Wu Q. Chong Y. Qin H. Poole C.J. van Riggelen J. Ren M. Cowell J.K. FGFR1 fusion kinase regulation of MYC expression drives development of stem cell leukemia/lymphoma syndrome.Leukemia. 2018; 32 (10.1038/s41375-018-0124-y, 29720732): 2363-2373Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In brief, chromatin was cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature, sheared to an average size of ∼500 bp, and then immunoprecipitated with an anti-Myc antibody (Abcam). The ChIP-qPCR primers were designed to amplify a proximal promoter region containing putative Myc binding sites (5′-ACCACATGGT-3′ for the mouse locus and 5′-ACCACGTGGC-3′ for the human locus) in the DNMT1 promoter. An intronic region was selected as a negative control. Each immunoprecipitated DNA sample was quantified using qPCR, and all ChIP-qPCR signals were normalized to an IgG control to calculate the relative -fold of enrichment. Animal protocols followed guidelines and procedures approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Augusta University. Approximately 1 × 106 cells were injected into the tail veins of 6- to 8-week-old, female, sublethally (600 rad) irradiated BALB/c mice, and after 1 week of expansion growth, randomly grouped mice were treated with either inhibitor or vehicle control as described previously (4Ren M.

https://openalex.org/W2980475372,"We investigated the hemodynamic and mortality effects of continuous ketamine infusion in critically ill pediatric patients. We conducted a retrospective cohort study in a tertiary pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). Patients who used continuous sedative from 2015 to 2017 for 24 hours or more were included. We compared blood pressure, heart and respiratory rates, vasogenic medications, and sedation and pain scores for 12 hours before and after initiation of continuous ketamine. The mortality rates for continuous ketamine and Non-ketamine groups were compared by multivariate logistic regression. A total of 240 patients used continuous sedation, and 82 used continuous ketamine. The median infusion rate of ketamine was 8.1 mcg/kg/min, and the median duration was 6 days. Heart rates (138 vs. 135 beat/minute, P = .033) and respiratory rates (31 vs. 25 respiration/minute, P = .001) decreased, but blood pressure (99.9 vs. 101.1 mm Hg, P = .124) and vasogenic medications did not change after ketamine infusion. Continuous ketamine was not a significant risk factor for mortality (hazard ratio 1.352, confidence interval 0.458–3.996). Continous ketamine could be used in PICU without hemodynamic instability. Further studies in randomized controlled design about the effects of continuous ketamine infusion on hemodynamic changes, sedation, and mortality are required."

Here we describe the development of a multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) protocol for the characterization of M. hyorhinis field isolates. A total of 104 field isolates from different geographical locations, swine production systems, and clinical backgrounds, were analyzed. Twenty-seven genes, including housekeeping and those encoding surface proteins, were evaluated to index diversity. Genes encoding surface proteins were included to increase the discriminatory power of the MLST. Four target gene fragments were selected to be included in the final MLST-s (surface) protocol: pdhB, p95, mtlD and ung. Within each locus the nucleotide variation ranged from 1.4% to 20%. The 104 field isolates were classified into 39 distinct sequence types (STs). Multiple STs were found within the same production system and within the same pig. The majority of STs grouped strains from the same production system; however, cases existed where multiple systems shared a ST, indicating potential relationships between pig flows. The majority of the nucleotide changes observed in these genes generated synonymous changes, while non-synonymous changes were exclusively in the mtlD gene fragment, suggesting that this protein is undergoing selection. Molecular typing of M. hyorhinis will primarily aid swine practitioners with pig flow management and identifying sources of infection during outbreaks."
https://openalex.org/W2980842043,"Background Increasing access to conventional cancer treatment (CT) in low-income countries (LICs) is an important public health initiative to address the global burden of cancer. However, LICs have a high prevalence of use of traditional and complementary medicine (T&CM). It is important to consider the factors that influence a patient’s choice to use T&CM, CT, or both for their cancer treatment. Methods We conducted focus groups among adult cancer patients in Lilongwe, Malawi to identify facilitators and barriers of T&CM use. Focus groups were recorded, transcribed, translated, and underwent thematic content analysis. Results Cultural norms, T&CM access, T&CM success, and CT failure were all identified as facilitators to T&CM use. CT success and T&CM failure were identified as barriers. Access and norms appear to determine initial treatment selection, while treatment outcomes dictate continued use of T&CM or CT. Conclusion This study identified a pragmatic and experience-based treatment selection process that aligns with the social cognitive theory of behavior and assists in comprehending the factors that influence T&CM use among cancer patients in a low resource setting."
https://openalex.org/W2980761981,"We investigate publications in medical research that have gone unnoticed for a number of years after being published and then suddenly become cited to a significant degree. Such publications are called Sleeping Beauties (SBs). This study focuses on SBs that are cited in patents. We find that the increasing trend of the relative number of SBs comes to an end around 1998. However, still a constant fraction of publications becomes an SB. Many SBs become highly cited publications, they even belong to the top-10 to 20% most cited publications in their field. We measured the scaling of the number of SBs in relation to the sleeping period length, during-sleep citation-intensity, and with awakening citation-intensity. We determined the Grand Sleeping Beauty Equation for these medical SBs which shows that the probability of awakening after a period of deep sleep is becoming rapidly smaller for longer sleeping periods and that the probability for higher awakening intensities decreases extremely rapidly. The exponents of the scaling functions show a time-dependent behavior which suggests a decreasing occurrence of SBs with longer sleeping periods. We demonstrate that the fraction of SBs cited by patents before scientific awakening exponentially increases. This finding shows that the technological time lag is becoming shorter than the sleeping time. Inventor-author self-citations may result in shorter technological time lags, but this effect is small. Finally, we discuss characteristics of an SBs that became one of the highest cited medical papers ever."
https://openalex.org/W2980471574,"Brassica juncea is used as a condiment, as vegetables and as an oilseed crop, especially in semiarid areas. In the present study, we constructed a genetic map using one recombinant inbred line (RIL) of B. juncea. A total of 304 ILP (intron length polymorphism) markers were mapped to 18 linkage groups designated LG01-LG18 in B. juncea. The constructed map covered a total genetic length of 1671.13 cM with an average marker interval of 5.50 cM. The QTLs for 2-propenyl glucosinolates (GSLs) colocalized with the QTLs for 3-butenyl GSLs between At1g26180 and BnapPIP1580 on LG08 in the field experiments of 2016 and 2017. These QTLs accounted for an average of 42.3% and 42.6% phenotypic variation for 2-propenyl and 3-butenyl GSLs, respectively. Furthermore, the Illumina RNA-sequencing technique was used to excavate the genes responsible for the synthesis of GSLs in the siliques of the parental lines of the RIL mapping population, because the bulk of the seed GSLs might originate from the siliques. Comparative analysis and annotation by gene ontology (GO) and kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) revealed that 324 genes were involved in GSL metabolism, among which only 24 transcripts were differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Among those DEGs, 15 genes were involved in the biosynthesis and transport of aliphatic GSLs, and their expression patterns were further validated by qRT-PCR analysis. Joint QTL mapping and RNA-sequencing analyses reveal one candidate gene of IIL1 (LOC106416451) for GSL metabolism in B. juncea. These results will be helpful for further fine mapping, gene cloning and genetic mechanisms of 2-propenyl and 3-butenyl GSLs in B. juncea."
https://openalex.org/W2980772009,"Glomerulonephritis (GN) has been associated with many solid and hematologic malignancies. However, cancer prevalence at the time of GN diagnosis has been rarely examined. We aimed to evaluate the cancer prevalence in patients with GN at the time of kidney biopsy and to compare the results to those of the general population. A total of 1,155 patients who underwent kidney biopsy between 2003 and 2017 were included. We investigated patients diagnosed with cancer within one month of kidney biopsy. The occurrence of cancer was compared with that of the Korean general population using the observed-to-expected rates (O/E ratio). Twenty-nine patients with GN had cancer. The mean age of patients with and without cancer was 49 and 66 years old, respectively. The proportion of male patients with and without cancer was 49.4% and 58.6%, respectively. The glomerular filtration rate was different between the groups (78.1 ± 37.0, 58.0 ± 43.6 ml/min/1.73 m2, p = 0.006), but the urine protein/creatinine ratio was not (3.21 ± 4.01, 5.38 ± 7.47 g/gCr, p = 0.172). Immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN) was the most common GN (37.9%), followed by membranous GN (13.5%), focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (9.7%), minimal change disease (9.2%), amyloidosis (1.2%). Amyloidosis was the most common GN associated with malignancy (20.7%). In patients with amyloidosis, cancer was observed almost 28 times more than expected and these patients showed higher cancer occurrence than patients with other GN (Relative Risk [RR]: 15.73; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 4.82–51.30; p < 0.01). Cancer occurrence was three times greater in GN patients aged > 50 years compared to the general population (O/E ratio: 3.42; 95% CI: 1.37–5.46; p = 0.027). Patients with GN, especially amyloidosis, have higher risk of cancer than the general population at the time of GN diagnosis. Older age (> 50 years) was one of the major determinants of the presence of cancer in GN patients."
https://openalex.org/W2981301687,"Several studies have shown protective effects between health outcomes and subjective reports of religious/spiritual (R/S) importance, as measured by a single self-report item. In a 3-generation study of individuals at high or low familial risk for depression, R/S importance was found to be protective against depression, as indicated by clinical and neurobiological outcomes. The psychological components underlying these protective effects, however, remain little understood. Hence, to clarify the meaning of answering the R/S importance item, we employed a comprehensive set of validated scales assessing religious beliefs and experiences and exploratory factor analysis to uncover latent R/S constructs that strongly and independently correlated with the single-item measure of R/S importance. A Varimax-rotated principal component analysis (PCA) resulted in a 23-factor solution (Eigenvalue > 1; 71.5% explained variance) with 8 factors that, respectively, accounted for at least 3% of the total variance. The first factor (15.8%) was directly related to the R/S importance item (r = .819), as well as personal relationship with the Divine, forgiveness by God, religious activities, and religious coping, while precluding gratitude, altruism, and social support, among other survey subscales. The corresponding factor scores were greater in older individuals and those at low familial risk. Moreover, Spearman rank-order correlations between the R/S importance item and other subscales revealed relative consistency across generations and risk groups. Taken together, the single R/S importance item constituted a robust measure of what may be generally conceived of as “religious importance,” ranking highest among a diverse latent factor structure of R/S. As this suggests adequate single-item construct validity, it may be adequate for use in health studies lacking the resources for more extensive measures. Nonetheless, given that this single item accounted for only a small fraction of the total survey variance, results based on the item should be interpreted and applied with caution."
https://openalex.org/W2981247381,"A highly specialized cytoskeletal protein, keratin 75 (K75), expressed primarily in hair follicles, nail beds, and lingual papillae, was recently discovered in dental enamel, the most highly mineralized hard tissue in the human body. Among many questions this discovery poses, the fundamental question regarding the trafficking and secretion of this protein, which lacks a signal peptide, is of an utmost importance. Here, we present evidence that K75 is expressed during the secretory stage of enamel formation and is present in the forming enamel matrix. We further show that K75 is secreted together with major enamel matrix proteins amelogenin and ameloblastin, and it was detected in Golgi and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)–Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) but not in rough ER (rER). Inhibition of ER–Golgi transport by brefeldin A did not affect the association of K75 with Golgi, whereas ameloblastin accumulated in rER, and its transport from rER into Golgi was disrupted. Together, these results indicate that K75, a cytosolic protein lacking a signal sequence, is secreted into the forming enamel matrix utilizing portions of the conventional ER–Golgi secretory pathway. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study providing insights into mechanisms of keratin secretion."
https://openalex.org/W2980351611,"Introduction Anthrax is endemic in Georgia and recent outbreaks prompted a livestock-handler case-control study with a component to evaluate anthrax knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) among livestock handlers or owners. Methods Cases were handlers of livestock with confirmed animal anthrax from June 2013-May 2015. Handlers of four matched unaffected animals were selected as controls, two from the same village as the case animal (“village control”) and two from 3–10 km away (“area control”). Descriptive statistics were reported and conditional logistic regression was performed to estimate the magnitude of the association of cases with specific study KAP factors. Results Cases were more likely male, had lower level college education, less animal care experience, and provided more animal care to their cattle. Cases had lower odds of burying a suddenly dead animal compared to all controls (Odds Ratio [OR]: 0.32, 95% Confidence interval [CI]:0.12, 0.88) and area controls (OR: 0.32, 95% CI: 0.11, 0.91). On an 8-point knowledge scale, cases having an animal with anthrax had a 1.31 times greater knowledge score compared to all controls (95% CI: 1.03, 1.67). Cases had higher odds of ever having human anthrax or knowing another person who had anthrax compared to all controls (OR: 4.56, 95% CI: 1.45, 14.30) and area controls (OR: 7.16, 95% CI: 1.52, 33.80). Discussion Cases were more knowledgeable of anthrax and had better anthrax prevention practices, but these are likely a result of the case investigation and ring vaccination following the death of their animal. Conclusions The findings reveal a low level of knowledge and practices related to anthrax control and prevention, and will guide educational material development to fill these gaps."
https://openalex.org/W2980396119,"Biological diversity is being lost at unprecedented rates, with genetic admixture and introgression presenting major threats to biodiversity. Our ability to accurately identify introgression is critical to manage species, obtain insights into evolutionary processes, and ultimately contribute to the Aichi Targets developed under the Convention on Biological Diversity. The current study concerns roan antelope, the second largest antelope in Africa. Despite their large size, these antelope are sensitive to habitat disturbance and interspecific competition, leading to the species being listed as Least Concern but with decreasing population trends, and as extinct over parts of its range. Molecular research identified the presence of two evolutionary significant units across their sub-Saharan range, corresponding to a West African lineage and a second larger group which includes animals from East, Central and Southern Africa. Within South Africa, one of the remaining bastions with increasing population sizes, there are a number of West African roan antelope populations on private farms, and concerns are that these animals hybridize with roan that naturally occur in the southern African region. We used a suite of 27 microsatellite markers to conduct admixture analysis. Our results indicate evidence of hybridization, with our developed tests using a simulated dataset being able to accurately identify F1, F2 and non-admixed individuals at threshold values of qi > 0.80 and qi > 0.85. However, further backcrosses were not always detectable with backcrossed-Western roan individuals (46.7–60%), backcrossed-East, Central and Southern African roan individuals (28.3–45%) and double backcrossed (83.3–98.3%) being incorrectly classified as non-admixed. Our study is the first to confirm ongoing hybridization in this within this iconic African antelope, and we provide recommendations for the future conservation and management of this species."
https://openalex.org/W2980510070,"Although observing other’s gaze and body movements provides a crucial source of information to successfully interact with other people, it remains unclear whether observers weigh differently these cues and whether the convergence of gaze and body’s directions determines facilitation effects. Here we aim to shed more light on this issue by testing the reliance upon these cues from both a behavioral and a neurophysiological perspective in a social interactive context. In Experiment 1, we manipulated the convergence between the direction of an actor’s upper limb movement and gaze direction while he attempts to socially interact with the participants observing the scene. We determined the direction of gaze as well as the duration of participants’ ocular fixations during the observation of the scene. In Experiment 2, we measured and correlated the effect of the body/gaze manipulation on corticospinal excitability and on the readiness to interact—a disposition to engage in social situations. Eye-tracking data revealed that participants fixated chiefly the actor’s head when his hand and gaze directions were divergent. Possibly a strategy to disambiguate the scene. Whereas participants mainly fixated the actor’s hand when he performed an interactive request toward the participants. From a neurophysiological point of view, the more participants felt involved in the interaction, the lower was motor preparation in the muscle potentially needed to fulfill the actor’s request. We contend that social contexts are more likely to elicit motor preparation compared to non-social ones, and that muscular inhibition is a necessary mechanism in order to prevent unwanted overt reactions during action observation tasks."
https://openalex.org/W2980527072,"Semi-quantitative dietary assessment methods are frequently used in low income countries, and the use of photographic series for portion size estimation is gaining popularity. However, when adequate data on commonly consumed foods and portion sizes are not available to design these tools, alternative data sources are needed. This study aimed to develop and test methods to: (i) identify foods likely to be consumed in a study population in rural Uganda, and; (ii) to derive distributions of portion sizes for common foods and dishes. A process was designed to derive detailed food and recipe lists using guided group interviews with women from the survey population, including a score for the likelihood of foods being consumed. A rapid recall method for portion size distribution estimation (PSDE) using direct weight by a representative sample of the survey population was designed and implemented. Results were compared to data from a 24 hour dietary recall (24HR). Of the 82 food items reported in the 24HR survey, 87% were among those scored with a high or medium likelihood of being consumed and accounted for 95% of kilocalories. Of the most frequently reported foods in the 24HR, portion sizes for many (15/25), but not all foods did not differ significantly (p<0.05) from those in the portion size estimation method. The percent of portion sizes reported in the 24 hour recall falling between the 5th and 95th percentiles as determined by the PSDE method ranged from 18% up to 100%. In conclusion, a simple food listing and scoring method effectively identified foods most likely to occur in a dietary survey. A novel PSDE method produced similar estimates as for the 24HR, while the approach for others should be further considered and validated. These methods are an improvement on those in current use."

The key feature problems covered four typical clinical situations. The items were presented in short- and long-menu question formats. Third- and fourth-year medical students undergoing the Neurology Course at our department participated in this study. The students' perception of the KFPE was assessed via a questionnaire. Students also had to pass a summative multiple-choice question examination (MCQE) containing 39 Type-A questions. All key feature and multiple-choice questions were classified using a modified Bloom's taxonomy.The results from 81 KFPE participants were analyzed. The average score was 6.7/12 points. Cronbach's alpha for the 12 key-feature problems was 0.53. Item difficulty level scores were between 0.39 and 0.77, and item-total correlations between 0.05 and 0.36. Thirty-two key feature items of the KFPE were categorized as testers of comprehension, application and problem-solving, and 12 questions as testers of knowledge (MCQE: 15 comprehension and 24 knowledge, respectively). Overall correlations between the KFPE and the MCQE were intermediate. The KFPE was perceived well by the students.Adherence to previously-established principles enables the creation of a valid KFPE in the field of Neurology."
https://openalex.org/W2980376742,"The purpose of the study was to describe the characteristics and demonstrate proof-of-concept and clinical use of a barium sulfate infused polypropylene radiopaque tissue marker for soft tissue localization and in vivo measurement of lengths and areas.Marker mechanical properties were evaluated by tensile tests. Biocompatibility was evaluated following 8-12 weeks' implantation in a pig model. Proof-of-concept of marker application was performed in a human cadaveric shoulder model, and methods for CT imaging and measurement of dimensions were established. Lastly, the method of clinical use of the markers was described in one patient undergoing arthroscopic rotator cuff repair (RCR).The radiopaque markers had a tensile strength of 28 ±4.7 N and were associated with minimal to mild inflammatory tissue reaction similar to polypropylene control. CT-based measurements showed relatively high precisions for lengths (0.66 mm), areas (6.97 mm2), and humeral orientation angles (2.1°) in the cadaveric model, and demonstrated 19 ±3 mm medio-lateral tendon retraction and 227 ±3 mm2 increase in tendon area in the patient during 26 weeks following RCR. No radiographic leaching, calcification or local adverse events were observed.The radiopaque tissue marker was biocompatible and had adequate strength for handling and affixation to soft tissues using standard suturing techniques. The marker could be used with low-dose, sequential CT imaging to quantitatively measure rotator cuff tendon retractions with clinically acceptable accuracy. We envision the radiopaque tissue marker to be useful for soft tissue localization and in vivo measurement of tissue and organ dimensions following surgery."
https://openalex.org/W2980754754,"Purpose This study examined the association between perceived organizational justice (i.e., procedural justice and interactional justice) and reporting of illness to one's company (illness reporting) among Japanese employees with chronic diseases. Methods This online cross-sectional survey included 1,134 employees (aged 18–65 years) who required workplace support to combine work with disease treatment. Participants were classified into tertiles of perceived organizational justice (low, moderate, and high). Multiple logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine sex differences in the associations between perceived justice and illness reporting. Results Males reporting perceived high levels of procedural and interactional justice had significantly higher odds of illness reporting than those with perceived low levels of procedural (odds ratio [OR] 2.62, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.47–4.66) and interactional justice (OR 4.34, 95% CI: 2.28–8.27). Females with perceived high levels of interactional justice had significantly higher odds of illness reporting than those with perceived low levels of interactional justice (OR 1.74, 95% CI: 1.08–2.80). There was no significant association between procedural justice and illness reporting among females. Conclusion The findings indicate that high perceived organizational justice is positively associated with illness reporting among Japanese employees who require workplace support to combine work and disease treatment."

Patient related data including mean age, sex, body weight and height didn't show significant difference between two groups (p > 0.05 for all). Among the image quality scoring, overall image quality, motion artifact, showed significant difference between two groups with improved inadequate timing and centering after adaptation of immobilization device. Dose related data showed significantly decreased shot number, mean fluoroscopic time with decreased mean dose area product (DAP) value and effective dose after adaptation of immobilization device (p < 0.05 for all).Adaptation of immobilization device can improve overall image quality with decreased motion artifact and improved centering and timing with even shot number, mean fluoroscopic time with decreased mean DAP value and effective dose."

To help understand their interplay, we have created a tailored visualization based on the Minardo layout, highlighting over 80 essential events. This complements our earlier visualization of M-phase, and both can be displayed together, giving a comprehensive overview of the events regulating the cell division cycle.

https://openalex.org/W2977607607,The automated design of meander line RFID antennas is a discrete self-avoiding walk (SAW) problem for which efficiency is to be maximized while resonant frequency is to be minimized. This work presents a novel exploration of how discrete local search may be incorporated into a continuous solver such as differential evolution (DE). A prior DE algorithm for this problem that incorporates an adaptive solution encoding and a bias favoring antennas with low resonant frequency is extended by the addition of the backbite local search operator and a variety of schemes for reintroducing modified designs into the DE population. The algorithm is extremely competitive with an existing ACO approach and the technique is transferable to other SAW problems and other continuous solvers. The findings indicate that careful reintegration of discrete local search results into the continuous population is necessary for effective performance.
https://openalex.org/W2981252555,"Whether or not depth perception influences brightness and/or lightness perception has been repeatedly discussed, and some studies have emphasized its importance. In addition, a small number of studies have empirically tested and shown the effect of depth inversion, such as seen in the Mach card illusion, on perceived lightness, and they interpreted such results in terms of lightness constancy. However, how perceived brightness changes contingent on depth inversion remains unexplained. Therefore, this study used the matching method to examine changes in brightness perception when depth inversion is observed. We created and used a three-dimensional (3D) concave object, composed of three sides made of card stock, which could be perceived as having two different shapes in 3D; it could be perceived as a horizontal concave object, corresponding to its actual physical structure, and as a convex standing object, similar in shape to a building. Participants observed this object as both a concave object and as a convex object, and judged the brightness of its surfaces during each observation. Our results show that the perception of the brightness of the object’s surfaces clearly changed depending on the perception of depth. When the object was seen as convex, one part of the surface was perceived as darker than when the object was seen as concave, but the other part of the surface remained unchanged. Here we discuss the relationship between depth perception and brightness perception in terms of perceptual organization."
https://openalex.org/W2980734728,"Background The head-tilt/chin-lift (HT/CL) maneuver is simple and routinely used to open a closed upper airway. Objectives It has yet to be determined whether increasing the HT/CL angle further would be beneficial. Methods We enrolled 60 (30 males) 20-year-old conscious participants. Pre-HT/CL, post-HT/CL #1, and post-HT/CL #2 positions were defined as positions in which the angle between the ear–eye line and the horizontal line was 80°, 65°, and 50°, respectively. Peak exploratory flow rates (PEFRs) pre-HT/CL, post-HT/CL #1, and post-HT/CL #2 positions were recorded continuously at 1-minute intervals (one set). Five sets of measurements were performed (total, 15 measurements for each participant). Results We analysed 900 measurements (180 sets). The mean PEFRs pre-HT/CL, post-HT/CL #1, and post-HT/CL #2 positions were 348.4 ± 96.9, 366.4 ± 104.9, and 378.8 ± 111.2 L/min (percentage change compared to pre-HT/CL, 5.2% and 8.7%), respectively. Significant differences were observed among pre-HT/CL, post-HT/CL #1, and post-HT/CL #2 positions in all participants, as well as in subgroup classified according to sex, and medians of height, body weight, and body mass index. Conclusion Our findings suggest that a greater HT/CL angle would be beneficial, as the PEFR increased gradually. The decreasing manner in the PEFR increase with the HT/CL angle implies the existence of an angle threshold beyond which there were no further benefits in airflow, indicating a minimum in airway resistance. A HT/CL maneuver may be appropriate until locking the atlanto-occipital and cervical spine joints in extension occurs and the chest (sternal notch) begins to rise."
