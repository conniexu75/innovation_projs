By periodically interrupting the growth and exposing the grown material to hydrogen, the film composition can be varied continuously from a non-equilibrium amorphous structure to that of a crystalline solid. Furthermore, by tuning the hydrogen exposure it is possible to discriminate between Si-Si bonds formed on different substrates, thereby allowing substrate-selective growth. The evolution of the film structure during hydrogen exposure is directly observed by scanning tunneling microscopy, and a model describing the role of hydrogen is presented."

The key evidence for their existence came from a series of inelastic electron-nucleon scattering experiments conducted between 1967 and 1973 at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center. Other theoretical and experimental advances of the 1970s confirmed this discovery, leading to the present standard model of elementary particle physics."

https://openalex.org/W2106934717,"Nuclear proliferation is not one but a complex of problems. One relates to the collapse of the Soviet Union and its effect on the spread of nuclear weapons and knowledge. Second, Iraq's violation of its Non-Proliferation Treaty obligation has exposed certain weaknesses in the traditional regime of multilateral nonproliferation institutions and treaties. Third, Pakistan's achievement of a nuclear weapons capability in the late 1980s brings the postproliferation question to the forefront in South Asia. There is no single solution to this complex set of problems, but the beginning of wisdom is to build upon the successes of the past, add new policy procedures, and, above all, increase the priority given to the issue. Otherwise, we may be faced with the ironic outcome that the widely welcomed end of the Cold War may increase the prospect of nuclear use."
