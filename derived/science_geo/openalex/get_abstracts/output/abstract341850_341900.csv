https://openalex.org/W2093527402,"The abundance and distribution of iron on the moon is derived from a near-global data set from Clementine. The determined iron content of the lunar highlands crust ( approximately 3 percent iron by weight) supports the hypothesis that much of the lunar crust was derived from a magma ocean. The iron content of lower crustal material exposed by the South Pole-Aitken impact basin on the lunar farside is higher ( approximately 7 to 8 percent by weight) and consistent with a basaltic composition. This composition supports earlier evidence that the lunar crust becomes more mafic with depth. The data also suggest that the bulk composition of the moon differs from that of the Earth's mantle. This difference excludes models for lunar origin that require the Earth and moon to have the same compositions, such as fission and coaccretion, and favors giant impact and capture."

The products of the hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) oxidation of 2,4,6-trichlorophenol (TCP) catalyzed by the iron complex 2,9,16,23-tetrasulfophthalocyanine (FePcS) were observed to be chloromaleic, chlorofumaric, maleic, and fumaric acids from dechlorination and aromatic cycle cleavage, as well as additional products that resulted from oxidative coupling. Quantitative analysis of the TCP oxidation reaction revealed that up to two chloride ions were released per TCP molecule. This chemical system, consisting of an environmentally safe oxidant (H2O2) and an easily accessible catalyst (FePcS), can perform several key steps in the oxidative mineralization of TCP, a paradigm of recalcitrant pollutants."

This gives a parameter-free determination of penetration depth lambda and coherence length xi for this superconductor that are in agreement with experiment."

Progeny raised in warm seawater grew at least four times as fast as lobsters grown at ambient ocean temperatures. These studies demonstrate that lobsters will reach sexual maturity (a weight of about 454 grams) in less than 2 years, compared to 8 years at ambient temperatures in Canadian waters. A further reduction in this time has been achieved by phenotypic selection for fast-growing lobsters. Our initial success in accelerating growth and in mating selected parents suggests that lobster farming may be possible."

These crack-like instabilities are identified as the sources of dislocation nucleation and multiplication in films of high misfit. This link between morphological instability and dislocation nucleation provides a method for studying the basic micromechanisms that determine the strength and mechanical properties of materials."

https://openalex.org/W1993797392,"Radiance gradients determined from data gathered by the infrared spectrometers aboard the Nimbus III and Nimbus IV satellites were related to the probabilities of clear air turbulence, as inferred from regular pilot reports. Such radiance gradients represent rather large-scale vertical wind shear. Clear air turbulence is least likely in regions where the radiance gradient is small. The results of this exploratory study show that satellite data can be used to design flight paths so that the probability of encountering clear air turbulence is extremely small."
