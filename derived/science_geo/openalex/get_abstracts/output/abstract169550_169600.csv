https://openalex.org/W1985555064,"Miniaturization in electronics through improvements in established ""top-down"" fabrication techniques is approaching the point where fundamental issues are expected to limit the dramatic increases in computing seen over the past several decades. Here we report a ""bottom-up"" approach in which functional device elements and element arrays have been assembled from solution through the use of electronically well-defined semiconductor nanowire building blocks. We show that crossed nanowire p-n junctions and junction arrays can be assembled in over 95% yield with controllable electrical characteristics, and in addition, that these junctions can be used to create integrated nanoscale field-effect transistor arrays with nanowires as both the conducting channel and gate electrode. Nanowire junction arrays have been configured as key OR, AND, and NOR logic-gate structures with substantial gain and have been used to implement basic computation."

Here, we show that the murine Suv39h histone methyltransferases (HMTases) govern H3-K9 methylation at pericentric heterochromatin and induce a specialized histone methylation pattern that differs from the broad H3-K9 methylation present at other chromosomal regions. Suv39h-deficient mice display severely impaired viability and chromosomal instabilities that are associated with an increased tumor risk and perturbed chromosome interactions during male meiosis. These in vivo data assign a crucial role for pericentric H3-K9 methylation in protecting genome stability, and define the Suv39h HMTases as important epigenetic regulators for mammalian development."

https://openalex.org/W2137336591,"Knowledge of carbon exchange between the atmosphere, land and the oceans is important, given that the terrestrial and marine environments are currently absorbing about half of the carbon dioxide that is emitted by fossil-fuel combustion. This carbon uptake is therefore limiting the extent of atmospheric and climatic change, but its long-term nature remains uncertain. Here we provide an overview of the current state of knowledge of global and regional patterns of carbon exchange by terrestrial ecosystems. Atmospheric carbon dioxide and oxygen data confirm that the terrestrial biosphere was largely neutral with respect to net carbon exchange during the 1980s, but became a net carbon sink in the 1990s. This recent sink can be largely attributed to northern extratropical areas, and is roughly split between North America and Eurasia. Tropical land areas, however, were approximately in balance with respect to carbon exchange, implying a carbon sink that offset emissions due to tropical deforestation. The evolution of the terrestrial carbon sink is largely the result of changes in land use over time, such as regrowth on abandoned agricultural land and fire prevention, in addition to responses to environmental changes, such as longer growing seasons, and fertilization by carbon dioxide and nitrogen. Nevertheless, there remain considerable uncertainties as to the magnitude of the sink in different regions and the contribution of different processes."
https://openalex.org/W2096018896,"We examined the role of ATP in the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway. Our data reveal two ATP-dependent steps and suggest that the RNAi reaction comprises at least four sequential steps: ATP-dependent processing of double-stranded RNA into small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), incorporation of siRNAs into an inactive approximately 360 kDa protein/RNA complex, ATP-dependent unwinding of the siRNA duplex to generate an active complex, and ATP-independent recognition and cleavage of the RNA target. Furthermore, ATP is used to maintain 5' phosphates on siRNAs. A 5' phosphate on the target-complementary strand of the siRNA duplex is required for siRNA function, suggesting that cells check the authenticity of siRNAs and license only bona fide siRNAs to direct target RNA destruction."

https://openalex.org/W2080222756,"Oleylethanolamide (OEA) is a natural analogue of the endogenous cannabinoid anandamide. Like anandamide, OEA is produced in cells in a stimulus-dependent manner and is rapidly eliminated by enzymatic hydrolysis, suggesting a function in cellular signalling. However, OEA does not activate cannabinoid receptors and its biological functions are still unknown. Here we show that, in rats, food deprivation markedly reduces OEA biosynthesis in the small intestine. Administration of OEA causes a potent and persistent decrease in food intake and gain in body mass. This anorexic effect is behaviourally selective and is associated with the discrete activation of brain regions (the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus and the nucleus of the solitary tract) involved in the control of satiety. OEA does not affect food intake when injected into the brain ventricles, and its anorexic actions are prevented when peripheral sensory fibres are removed by treatment with capsaicin. These results indicate that OEA is a lipid mediator involved in the peripheral regulation of feeding."

https://openalex.org/W2108551329,"A cryo-EM reconstruction of the translating yeast 80S ribosome was analyzed. Computationally separated rRNA and protein densities were used for docking of appropriately modified rRNA models and homology models of yeast ribosomal proteins. The core of the ribosome shows a remarkable degree of conservation. However, some significant differences in functionally important regions and dramatic changes in the periphery due to expansion segments and additional ribosomal proteins are evident. As in the bacterial ribosome, bridges between the subunits are mainly formed by RNA contacts. Four new bridges are present at the periphery. The position of the P site tRNA coincides precisely with its prokaryotic counterpart, with mainly rRNA contributing to its molecular environment. This analysis presents an exhaustive inventory of an eukaryotic ribosome at the molecular level."
https://openalex.org/W2000206128,"Lethal factor (LF) is a protein (relative molecular mass 90,000) that is critical in the pathogenesis of anthrax. It is a highly specific protease that cleaves members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MAPKK) family near to their amino termini, leading to the inhibition of one or more signalling pathways. Here we describe the crystal structure of LF and its complex with the N terminus of MAPKK-2. LF comprises four domains: domain I binds the membrane-translocating component of anthrax toxin, the protective antigen (PA); domains II, III and IV together create a long deep groove that holds the 16-residue N-terminal tail of MAPKK-2 before cleavage. Domain II resembles the ADP-ribosylating toxin from Bacillus cereus, but the active site has been mutated and recruited to augment substrate recognition. Domain III is inserted into domain II, and seems to have arisen from a repeated duplication of a structural element of domain II. Domain IV is distantly related to the zinc metalloprotease family, and contains the catalytic centre; it also resembles domain I. The structure thus reveals a protein that has evolved through a process of gene duplication, mutation and fusion, into an enzyme with high and unusual specificity."
https://openalex.org/W1964195679,"We describe a molecular switch based on the controlled methylation of nucleosome and the transcriptional cofactors, the CREB-binding proteins (CBP)/p300. The CBP/p300 methylation site is localized to an arginine residue that is essential for stabilizing the structure of the KIX domain, which mediates CREB recruitment. Methylation of KIX by coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1 (CARM1) blocks CREB activation by disabling the interaction between KIX and the kinase inducible domain (KID) of CREB. Thus, CARM1 functions as a corepressor in cyclic adenosine monophosphate signaling pathway via its methyltransferase activity while acting as a coactivator for nuclear hormones. These results provide strong in vivo and in vitro evidence that histone methylation plays a key role in hormone-induced gene activation and define cofactor methylation as a new regulatory mechanism in hormone signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2113942795,"In vitro assembled yeast ribosome-nascent chain complexes (RNCs) containing a signal sequence in the nascent chain were immunopurified and reconstituted with the purified protein-conducting channel (PCC) of yeast endoplasmic reticulum, the Sec61 complex. A cryo-EM reconstruction of the RNC-Sec61 complex at 15.4 A resolution shows a tRNA in the P site. Distinct rRNA elements and proteins of the large ribosomal subunit form four connections with the PCC across a gap of about 10-20 A. Binding of the PCC influences the position of the highly dynamic rRNA expansion segment 27. The RNC-bound Sec61 complex has a compact appearance and was estimated to be a trimer. We propose a binary model of cotranslational translocation entailing only two basic functional states of the translating ribosome-channel complex."
https://openalex.org/W2026139002,"In posttranscriptional gene silencing (PTGS), ""quelling,"" and RNA interference (RNAi), 21-25 nucleotide RNA fragments are produced from the initiating dsRNA. These short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) mediate RNAi by an unknown mechanism. Here, we show that GFP and Pp-Luc siRNAs, isolated from a protein complex in Drosophila embryo extract, target mRNA degradation in vitro. Most importantly, these siRNAs, as well as a synthetic 21-nucleotide duplex GFP siRNA, serve as primers to transform the target mRNA into dsRNA. The nascent dsRNA is degraded to eliminate the incorporated target mRNA while generating new siRNAs in a cycle of dsRNA synthesis and degradation. Evidence is presented that mRNA-dependent siRNA incorporation to form dsRNA is carried out by an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity (RdRP)."

https://openalex.org/W2089380061,"Telomerase activity is critical for normal and transformed human cells to escape from crisis and is implicated in oncogenesis. Here we describe a novel Pin2/TRF1 binding protein, PinX1 that inhibits telomerase activity and affects tumorigenicity. PinX1 and its small TID domain bind the telomerase catalytic subunit hTERT and potently inhibit its activity. Overexpression of PinX1 or its TID domain inhibits telomerase activity, shortens telomeres, and induces crisis, whereas depletion of endogenous PinX1 increases telomerase activity and elongates telomeres. Depletion of PinX1 also increases tumorigenicity in nude mice, consistent with its chromosome localization at 8p23, a region with frequent loss of heterozygosity in a number of human cancers. Thus, PinX1 is a potent telomerase inhibitor and a putative tumor suppressor."
https://openalex.org/W1908051699,"Apoptosis is primarily executed by active caspases, which are derived from the inactive procaspase zymogens through proteolytic cleavage. Here we report the crystal structures of a caspase zymogen, procaspase-7, and an active caspase-7 without any bound inhibitors. Compared to the inhibitor-bound caspase-7, procaspase-7 zymogen exhibits significant structural differences surrounding the catalytic cleft, which precludes the formation of a productive conformation. Proteolytic cleavage between the large and small subunits allows rearrangement of essential loops in the active site, priming active caspase-7 for inhibitor/substrate binding. Strikingly, binding by inhibitors causes a 180° flipping of the N terminus in the small subunit, which interacts with and stabilizes the catalytic cleft. These analyses reveal the structural mechanisms of caspase activation and demonstrate that the inhibitor/substrate binding is a process of induced fit."

https://openalex.org/W2018445507,"Aminoglycosides are antibiotics commonly used to treat life-threatening Gram-negative bacterial infections. However, their use is hampered by their severe nephrotoxicity due to accumulation in renal proximal tubules.

Here, we have used mouse models with genetic or functional megalin deficiency to explore the contribution of megalin and other pathways to renal aminoglycoside uptake in vivo. We demonstrate that the uptake of aminoglycosides into the kidney directly correlates with renal megalin activity and is completely eliminated in mice lacking the receptor.

Thus, our studies provide unequivocal evidence that megalin is the only major pathway responsible for renal aminoglycoside accumulation and that the receptor represents a unique drug target to prevent aminoglycoside-induced nephrotoxicity in patients. Aminoglycosides are among the most commonly used antibiotics worldwide. They are active against a wide range of Gram-negative bacteria, including Pseudomonas, Enterobacter,Proteus, and Neisseria species. Because of their effectiveness and the low rate of true resistance, aminoglycosides are often considered the drug of choice to treat life-threatening infections such as bacterial endocarditis, peritonitis, and sepsis, as well as tuberculosis. Their relatively low costs make them attractive, particularly in developing countries. The clinical importance of aminoglycosides is likely to increase in the future due to the rapid rise in pathogens resistant to other classes of antibiotics (1Davey P. Rev. Med. Microbiol. 1991; 2: 22-30Google Scholar, 2Begg E.J. Barclay M.L. Br. J. Clin. Pharmacol. 1995; 39: 597-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The main obstacle in the clinical use of aminoglycosides is their severe nephro- and ototoxicity. Aminoglycosides specifically accumulate in epithelial cells of the renal proximal tubule and in hair cells of the inner ear causing a variety of deleterious effects and eventual cell death (3Luft F.C. Kleit S.A. J. Infect. Dis. 1974; 130: 656-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 4Tran Ba Huy P. Bernard P. Schacht J. J. Clin.

In recent years, changes in treatment regimens such as single daily dosing and monitoring procedures reduced the risk associated with aminoglycoside therapy. Nevertheless, still up to 10% of patients suffer from the toxic side effects of these antibiotics (1Davey P. Rev. Med. Microbiol. 1991; 2: 22-30Google Scholar,2Begg E.J. Barclay M.L. Br. J. Clin. Pharmacol. 1995; 39: 597-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). When applied systemically, aminoglycosides remain largely inert. They do not adhere to plasma proteins and are eliminated from the body through glomerular filtration. After 24 h, 70–90% of the antibiotic has been excreted into the urine. In general, the tissue penetrance of aminoglycosides is low, with the exception of the renal cortex that may absorb up to 5% of the compound. There, aminoglycosides persist for a long time (half-life > 100 h) causing renal damage (10Mathews A. Bailie G.R. J. Clin. Pharmacol. Ther. 1987; 12: 273-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Because the accumulation of aminoglycosides in epithelial cells of the proximal tubules is the main factor determining their nephrotoxicity, much attention had been focused on the identification of pathways responsible for cellular aminoglycoside uptake. Fluid phase uptake, adsorptive binding, and clearance by low affinity sites or receptor-mediated endocytosis all have been held responsible for renal aminoglycoside accumulation (7Molitoris B.A. Curr. Opin. Nephrol. Hypertens. 1997; 6: 384-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 8Mingeot-Leclercq M.P. Tulkens P.M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1999; 43: 1003-1012Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Among other pathways, megalin, an endocytic receptor expressed on the apical surface of the proximal tubular epithelium, has been implicated in renal aminoglycoside uptake (11Moestrup S.K. Cui S. Vorum H. Bregengard C. Bjorn S.E. Norris K. Gliemann J. Christensen E.I. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1404-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 12Farquhar M.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 961184Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Megalin constitutes the main endocytic pathway for clearance of low molecular weight plasma proteins from the glomerular filtrate (13Christensen E.I. Willnow T.E. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 2224-2236PubMed Google Scholar). In megalin-deficient mice, lack of this uptake pathway results in tubular resorption deficiency and low molecular weight proteinuria (14Leheste J.-R. Rolinski B. Vorum H. Hilpert J. Nykjaer A.

Physiological ligands taken up by megalin include insulin (15Orlando R.A. Rader K. Authier F. Yamazaki H. Posner B.I. Bergeron J.J. Farquhar M.G. J. Am. Soc.

Nykjaer A. Blomhoff R. Willnow T.E. Moestrup S.K. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 685-695Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Besides the uptake of filtered plasma proteins, megalin may also be responsible for the clearance of xenobiotic compounds from the primary urine. In particular, polybasic substances such as aminoglycosides may interact with abundant negative charges on the extracellular receptor domain thereby gaining entrance to proximal tubular cells (11Moestrup S.K. Cui S. Vorum H. Bregengard C. Bjorn S.E. Norris K. Gliemann J. Christensen E.I. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1404-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Several studies in the rat, an animal model of aminoglycoside-induced nephrotoxicity, have addressed a possible role of megalin in renal aminoglycoside uptake. Moestrup et al. (11Moestrup S.K. Cui S. Vorum H. Bregengard C. Bjorn S.E. Norris K. Gliemann J. Christensen E.I. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1404-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar) used a specific megalin antagonist, the receptor-associated protein (RAP), 1The abbreviation used is RAP, receptor-associated protein.1The abbreviation used is RAP, receptor-associated protein. to block the activity of the receptor in perfused rat proximal tubules. Inhibition of megalin reduced the clearance of gentamicin by ∼20% (11Moestrup S.K. Cui S. Vorum H. Bregengard C. Bjorn S.E. Norris K. Gliemann J. Christensen E.I. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1404-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Nagai et al. (19Nagai Y. Tanaka H. Nakanishi N. Murakami T. Takano M. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2001; 281: F337-F344Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) analyzed the aminoglycoside clearance in rats treated with maleate. This substance causes shedding of megalin from the brush-border surface, thus impairing receptor-mediated ligand uptake. In maleate-treated animals, the tubular clearance of aminoglycosides was decreased to the same extent as that of megalin ligands, suggesting uptake via the same receptor pathway (19Nagai Y. Tanaka H. Nakanishi N. Murakami T. Takano M. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2001; 281: F337-F344Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). While some experimental evidence links megalin activity with tubular uptake of aminoglycosides in the rat, the quantitative contribution of the receptor to renal aminoglycoside accumulation remained unclear. So far, inhibitors used to interfere with megalin activity were only marginally effective in blocking aminoglycoside clearance (e.g. RAP) or may have had additional unspecific effects on other tubular uptake pathways (e.g. maleate). Furthermore, studies by others suggested that renal aminoglycoside uptake also proceeds from the basolateral surface of the tubules (20Ford D.M. Dahl R.H. Lamp C.A. Molitoris B.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C52-C57Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or that uptake is independent of endocytosis (21Holohan P.D. Sokol P.P. Ross C.R. Coulson R. Trimble M.E. Laska D.A. Williams P.D. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1988; 247: 349-354PubMed Google Scholar, 22Decorti G. Malusa N. Furlan G. Candussio L. Klugmann F.B. Life Sci. 1999; 65: 1115-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Mice with genetically induced megalin deficiencies represent unique model systems to test a role of megalin in uptake of aminoglycoside into the kidney. Here, we have used two mouse models with induced receptor defects to dissect the quantitative contribution of megalin and other pathways to renal aminoglycoside accumulation. We demonstrate that aminoglycoside uptake into the kidney correlates with renal megalin activity and is absent in mice lacking the receptor (megalin knockout mice). As such, our studies provide clear evidence that megalin is the only major pathway for renal accumulation of aminoglycosides. Wild type and megalin-deficient mice (C57BL/6J × 129SvJ hybrids) were bred in house; RAP-deficient mice (C57BL/6J) were purchased from the Jackson Laboratories (www.jax.org). [3H]Gentamicin (58.1 GBq/mmol) was obtained from Amersham Biosciences, Inc. (www.apbiotech.com); gentamicin was purchased from Sigma (www.sigma-aldrich.com). For application in mice, [3H]gentamicin was diluted in 50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, and injected intraperitoneally or intravenously at a dose of 2.2 × 105 dpm/g body weight (45 μg of gentamicin/kg). Then, the animals were placed in metabolic cages for urine collection. At the end of the experiment, blood was sampled by retroorbital puncture, and the animals were killed by cervical dislocation. Organs were collected, weighed, and homogenized for 45 s in 10 ml of H2O. 500 μl of homogenate were added to 10 ml of scintillation fluid (ReadySafe, Beckman; www.beckman.com) and counted. The statistical significance of values was determined by Student's t test. [3H]Gentamicin was injected intraperitoneally into laboratory animals at a dose of 2.2 × 106 (mice) or 7.2 × 106 (rats) dpm/g body weight. After 24 h, the kidneys were fixed by retrograde perfusion through the abdominal aorta using 1% glutaraldehyde in 0.1m sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4, postfixed, dehydrated, and embedded in Epon. Unless indicated otherwise, the tissues were prepared for light microscope autoradiography on 1-μm Epon sections using Ilford K2 emulsion. The sections were exposed for 2–4 weeks. For electron microscope autoradiography, Ilford L4 emulsion was applied to 60-nm sections as described (23Christensen E.I. Gliemann J. Moestrup S.K. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1992; 40: 1481-1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The sections were exposed for 2–4 months. Previous studies on the renal metabolism of aminoglycosides have mainly focused on the rat because this animal model exhibits similar susceptibility to aminoglycoside-induced nephrotoxicity as patients (3Luft F.C. Kleit S.A. J. Infect. Dis. 1974; 130: 656-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar,24Suzuki S. Hatashima S. Shinzawa Y. Niwa O. Tamatani R. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. C Pharmacol. Toxicol.

In contrast, for reasons largely unknown mice are resistant to aminoglycoside nephrotoxicity (24Suzuki S. Hatashima S. Shinzawa Y. Niwa O. Tamatani R. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. C Pharmacol. Toxicol. Endocrinol. 1994; 109: 77-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 25Suzuki S. Takamura S. Yoshida J. Shinzawa Y. Niwa O. Tamatani R. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. C Pharmacol. Toxicol. Endocrinol. 1995; 112: 15-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). To ensure that murine resistance to nephrotoxicity was not due to differences in the renal handling of aminoglycosides as compared with patients and rats, we initially characterized the metabolism of gentamicin in wild type mice. We injected [3H]gentamicin intraperitoneally into the animals and determined the distribution of the tracer in plasma, urine, and tissues 24 h later. As seen in Fig.1, 10% of the tracer was recovered in the kidneys, whereas 45% was found in the urine. No significant amounts of radioactivity were detected in any other tissue. Thus, the remainder of the tracer was most likely lost in the metabolic cages used for urine collection. The renal uptake of [3H]gentamicin was rapid with 10% of the tracer accumulating in the kidneys as early as 30 min after drug administration (Fig. 2A). The radioactivity persisted in the kidneys for more than 24 h and slowly declined thereafter (Fig. 2A). Still after 148 h, 3.4% of the tracer resided in the kidneys (data not shown). The kinetics of renal uptake was identical regardless of whether the tracer was applied intraperitoneally (Fig. 2A) or intravenously (data not shown).Figure 2Pharmacokinetics of [3H]gentamicin uptake into mouse kidneys.A, wild type mice were injected intraperitoneally with [3H]gentamicin (45 μg/kg). At the indicated time points, kidney samples were collected, and the amount of radioactivity taken up into the tissue was determined. B, wild type mice were injected intraperitoneally with [3H]gentamicin (45 μg/kg) together with the indicated concentrations of unlabeled gentamicin. The amount of radioactivity in the kidneys was determined 24 h later. Values are the mean ± S.E. of 3–10 animals.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) One of the hallmarks of renal aminoglycoside uptake in rats and patients is concentration dependence and saturability at clinically relevant doses (2–6 mg/kg in patients) (28Giuliano R.A. Verpooten G.A. Verbist L. Wedeen R.P. De Broe M.E. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1986; 236: 470-475PubMed Google Scholar). The same effect was observed in the mouse (Fig. 2B). When [3H]gentamicin was injected together with increasing concentrations of unlabeled gentamicin, the renal uptake of the tracer decreased accordingly. Half-saturating concentrations for gentamicin were reached at ∼5 mg/kg body weight. As shown by autoradiography, the tracer specifically accumulated in the renal cortex of the mice (Fig. 3). To further characterize this uptake pathway at the cellular level, we compared the renal distribution and subcellular localization of [3H]gentamicin in mice and rats. In both animal models, [3H]gentamicin was detected exclusively in proximal tubular cells (Fig. 4, C andD). No tracer was seen in any other renal cell type (Fig. 4,A and B). In mice, the autoradiographic signal for [3H]gentamicin was concentrated in the apical cytoplasm (Fig. 4B). In contrast, in proximal tubules of the rat the tracer was more evenly distributed throughout the interior of the cells (Fig. 4A). This observation is consistent with an accumulation of gentamicin in lysosomes in both species because these vesicles are localized in the subapical space in mouse tubules and found deeper in the cytoplasm in the rat (13Christensen E.I.

The presence of the antibiotic in identical lysosomal compartments of rat and mouse cells was finally confirmed by autoradiography of electron micrographs (Fig.5).

Therefore, the mouse constituted an appropriate animal model to study the common molecular pathways involved in renal aminoglycoside accumulation. To determine the quantitative contribution of megalin and other pathways to renal aminoglycoside uptake in vivo, we compared the pharmacokinetics of [3H]gentamicin in wild type and megalin-deficient mice. In wild type animals, 10.6 ± 0.5% (mean ± S.E.) of the tracer accumulated in the kidneys 24 h after drug administration; 46.9 ± 3.4% was excreted into the urine (Fig.6). Megalin-deficient mice excreted similar amounts of the tracer (38.2 ± 8.6%), suggesting identical glomerular filtration rates. However, receptor-deficient animals did not exhibit any significant [3H]gentamicin accumulation in their kidneys (0.6 ± 0.1%, Fig. 6). This effect was not due to a metabolic turnover of aminoglycosides by expression of the neomycin phosphotransferase gene used for megalin gene targeting because mice carrying unrelated gene knockouts were indistinguishable from wild type controls (renin-binding protein knockout, Fig. 6). To confirm that the rate of aminoglycoside accumulation directly correlated with the amount of megalin in the kidney, we tested the turnover of [3H]gentamicin in a mouse model of reduced receptor expression. In mice genetically deficient for RAP, the amount of megalin in the kidney is reduced by ∼50% as compared with wild type animals (Fig. 7, inset). The reduction in megalin expression is most pronounced when the animals are kept on a C57BL/6J genetic background (29Willnow T.E. Rohlmann A. Horton J. Otani H. Braun J.R. Hammer R.E. Herz J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2632-2639Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 30Birn H. Vorum H. Verroust P.J. Moestrup S.K. Christensen E.I. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2001; 11: 191-202Google Scholar). RAP is a cellular chaperone that blocks binding of ligands to the receptor and is required for proper biosynthesis and intracellular transport of megalin (29Willnow T.E. Rohlmann A. Horton J. Otani H. Braun J.R. Hammer R.E. Herz J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2632-2639Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 31Bu G. Geuze H.J. Strous G.J. Schwartz A.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2269-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Consequently, in mice lacking this chaperone, the biosynthetic pathway of the receptor is disrupted resulting in decreased expression levels (29Willnow T.E. Rohlmann A. Horton J. Otani H. Braun J.R. Hammer R.E. Herz J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2632-2639Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 30Birn H. Vorum H. Verroust P.J. Moestrup S.K. Christensen E.I. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2001; 11: 191-202Google Scholar). To be able to detect subtle differences in renal aminoglycoside uptake in RAP knockoutversus wild type mice, we injected [3H]gentamicin together with 30 mg/kg unlabeled gentamicin (saturating concentrations, see Fig. 2B). Consistent with a reduction in receptor levels, the amount of [3H]gentamicin in RAP−/− kidneys was decreased by ∼50% as compared with control tissues (p < 0.001, Fig. 7). Here, we have demonstrated that megalin, an endocytic receptor in the renal proximal tubules, represents the only major pathway for accumulation of aminoglycosides in the mouse kidney. Renal uptake of the antibiotic directly correlates with the levels of receptor activity in mouse models of reduced megalin function (RAP−/−, Fig.7). No renal uptake of aminoglycosides can be observed in mice completely devoid of the receptor (megalin−/−, Fig. 6). This lack of uptake is a direct consequence of the megalin deficiency and is not caused by unspecific kidney defects because renal functions such as glomerular filtration, urine output, or tubular resorption of electrolytes and other metabolites are normal in megalin−/− animals (14Leheste J.-R. Rolinski B. Vorum H. Hilpert J. Nykjaer A. Jacobsen C. Aucouturier P. Moskaug J.O. Otto A. Christensen E.I. Willnow T.E. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 155: 1361-1370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). The identification of an endocytic pathway responsible for cellular uptake of aminoglycosides confirms earlier findings that localized these antibiotics within endosomes and lysosomes of proximal tubular cells (27Weinberg J.M. Hunt D. Humes H.D. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1985; 34: 1779-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 32Silverblatt F.J. Kuehn C. Kidney Int. 1979; 15: 335-345Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). In contrast, our results argue against a significant role of other routes such as fluid phase uptake or non-endocytic pathways in entry of aminoglycosides into cells in vivo. Because megalin is exclusively present on the apical membranes of the tubular epithelium (33Christensen E.I. Birn H. Verroust P. Moestrup S.K. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1998; 180: 237-284Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Kerjaschki D. Farquhar M.G. J. Exp. Med. 1983; 157: 667-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar), in vivo uptake of aminoglycosides from the basolateral surface into tubular cells also seems less likely. Previous studies on the role of megalin in renal aminoglycoside accumulation focused on the rat as a model system (11Moestrup S.K. Cui S. Vorum H. Bregengard C. Bjorn S.E. Norris K. Gliemann J. Christensen E.I. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1404-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 19Nagai Y. Tanaka H. Nakanishi N. Murakami T. Takano M. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2001; 281: F337-F344Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Megalin antagonists were used to interfere with the activity of receptor and to test the consequences for aminoglycoside uptake in vivo. In these studies, RAP reduced the tubular clearance of gentamicin by 20% suggesting a minor role of megalin in renal aminoglycoside accumulation (11Moestrup S.K. Cui S. Vorum H. Bregengard C. Bjorn S.E. Norris K. Gliemann J. Christensen E.I. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1404-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Contrary to the rat, mouse models with induced megalin deficiencies represent the first genetically defined animal models to quantify the contribution of megalin to renal aminoglycoside uptake. In these models, megalin represents the only major pathway for aminoglycoside uptake and lack of the receptor offers protection from renal accumulation of the antibiotic. The moderate effect of RAP on gentamicin uptake observed in the rat is not due to differences in aminoglycoside uptake pathways in this animal model as compared with the mouse. Rather, the ineffectiveness of this inhibitor is explained by its inability to efficiently interfere with gentamicin binding to megalin. Approximately 60–100 molecules of gentamicin bind per megalin molecule whereas RAP occupies only 1–2 ligand binding sites on the receptor. 2J. Hilpert, C. Jacobsen, and T. E. Willnow, unpublished observations. Therefore, the antagonist is largely ineffective in blocking gentamicin binding to megalin. It is well established that renal uptake of aminoglycosides is the main factor that determines their nephrotoxicity. Thus, aminoglycoside derivatives with reduced tendency to accumulate in the renal cortex also proved less nephrotoxic (35Williams P.D. Bennett D.B. Gleason C.R. Hottendorf G.H. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1987; 31: 570-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Given its central role in renal aminoglycoside uptake, megalin activity can be assumed to be a critical factor contributing to aminoglycoside-induced nephrotoxicity. Conceivably, functional megalin deficiency should prevent nephrotoxic side effects of aminoglycoside treatment. Unfortunately, the resistance of mice to aminoglycoside-induced nephrotoxicity precludes testing of this hypothesis in our mouse models. Even after prolonged exposure of wild type mice to high doses of gentamicin, we have not been able to detect major signs of tubular damage. Similar findings were also seen by others (24Suzuki S. Hatashima S. Shinzawa Y. Niwa O. Tamatani R. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. C Pharmacol. Toxicol. Endocrinol. 1994; 109: 77-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 25Suzuki S. Takamura S. Yoshida J. Shinzawa Y. Niwa O. Tamatani R. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. C Pharmacol. Toxicol. Endocrinol. 1995; 112: 15-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The reasons for this resistance remain unknown. To confirm that the insensitivity of mice to aminoglycosides is not due to the existence of different uptake routes, we compared renal gentamicin clearance in mice and rats. All parameters including plasma and renal half-life, tissue distribution, concentration dependence, and saturability of renal uptake were identical in both models. Moreover, gentamicin was detected in the same intracellular compartments (lysosomes) in rat and mouse proximal tubules. Taken together, these findings clearly demonstrate that identical pathways for aminoglycoside uptake exist in both species and that megalin is likely to play an equally crucial role in renal uptake and nephrotoxicity of aminoglycosides in rats and patients. Accumulation of aminoglycosides in lysosomes with subsequent rupture of the vesicles is considered the main mechanism causing nephrotoxicity in rats and humans (7Molitoris B.A. Curr. Opin. Nephrol. Hypertens. 1997; 6: 384-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Because aminoglycosides are directed to the very same organelles in mouse proximal tubules, murine resistance to aminoglycoside-induced nephrotoxicity likely involves alternative strategies of the mouse to deal with the consequences of intracellular aminoglycoside accumulation. Consistent with this hypothesis, specific protective mechanisms in the mouse to inactivate internalized aminoglycosides or to repair damaged renal tissues are being discussed (8Mingeot-Leclercq M.P. Tulkens P.M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1999; 43: 1003-1012Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Elucidation of these mechanisms may reveal possible strategies also to deal with aminoglycoside accumulation in patients. These investigations are, however, beyond the scope of this study. In conclusion, acute renal failure caused by aminoglycosides is still an important clinical entity that hampers the unrestricted use of these antibiotics. In industrialized nations, elaborate dosing and monitoring procedures have been implemented to minimize toxic side effects of aminoglycoside treatment. However, these measures result in a dramatic increase in therapy costs. While a standard gentamicin therapy amounts to only $20 for drugs, supplies, and labor costs, therapy requires an additional $17 for monitoring and $180 for treatment of nephrotoxic side effects (36Eisenberg J.M.

Nightingale C.H. Quintiliani R. Nicolau D.P. Pharmacotherapy. 1997; 17: 810-814PubMed Google Scholar). In developing countries where no monitoring procedures are implemented and aminoglycosides are often available freely over the counter, side effects of aminoglycoside therapy constitute a major health problem (38Schacht J. Otolaryngol. Clin. North Am. 1993; 26: 845-856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our studies now suggest a novel approach to prevent aminoglycoside-induced toxicity using megalin antagonists. All available data support the concept that filtrated aminoglycosides adhere to this receptor that represents an abundant surface area in the renal proximal tubule. Conceivably, receptor antagonists that occupy the same binding sites on the receptor should be effective in blocking tubular uptake of aminoglycosides. We are indebted to C. Raeder, H. Schulz, H. Sidelmann, I. Kristoffersen, and A. Meier for expert technical assistance and to A. Nykjaer for critical reading of the manuscript."

Shimada A. Shima A. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 381-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). In this fish, mutations in Aim-1 produce albino-like depigmentation of black melanophores, leaving gold-red xanthophores, white leukophores, and silver iridophores as the remaining pigmented cells. The gene product is predicted to be a 12-transmembrane-transporter protein that shows homology to yeast and plant sucrose transporters (1Fukamachi S. Shimada A. Shima A. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 381-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Human AIM-1 has been previously identified as a melanoma antigen that was recognized by autologous, patient-derived T cells (2Harada M. Li Y.F. El-Gamil M. Rosenberg S.A. Robbins P.F. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 1089-1094PubMed Google Scholar). Its expression was shown to be restricted to the melanocyte lineage by Northern analysis (2Harada M. Li Y.F. El-Gamil M. Rosenberg S.A. Robbins P.F. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 1089-1094PubMed Google Scholar). MurineAim-1 is located on chromosome 15 in a region containing the pigmentation locus, underwhite. A series of mouse mutants has been described for this locus. All are characterized by various degrees of pigment reduction (from partial to complete albinism) in the eyes and fur (3Sweet H.O. Brilliant M.H. Cook S.A. Johnson K.R. Davisson M.T. J. Hered. 1998; 89: 546-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). MITF is a tissue-restricted transcription factor essential to melanocyte development. It binds the canonical E-box sequence CACGTG as well as the non-palindromic sequence CACATG. The major pigmentation hormone, melanocyte-stimulating hormone, up-regulates MITF expression through cAMP signaling followed by cAMP-response element-binding protein phosphorylation and activation of the melanocyte-specific MITF promoter and may modulate multiple pigmentation genes through up-regulating MITF expression (4Price E.R.

Examination of the homologous region in the mouse genome revealed a previously described hypopigmentation locus, underwhite. Here experiments were carried out to explore a potential link betweenAim-1 and the underwhite mutants. Distinct mutations in Aim-1 were found in three underwhitealleles, including a frameshift, as compared with wild-type controls. In addition, evidence is presented that suggests that the global transcriptional regulator of pigmentation, MITF, also resides upstream of Aim-1, linking this gene to the major pigmentation pathway in melanocytes.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay (ChIPs)1 was performed in human primary melanocytes (provided by Dr. Ruth Halaban, Yale University), SKMEL5, or IMR90 cells (ATCC) grown in logarithmic phase. Cells were harvested by scraping, homogenized in a hypotonic buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 15 mm NaCl, 60 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P40, 5% sucrose, 1× CompleteTM proteinase inhibitor mixture (Roche)) on ice using a Dounce homogenizer. The nuclei were isolated by centrifugation onto a 10% sucrose pad and then cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 20 min at room temperature with gentle shaking. Nuclei were then spun down and resuspended in ChIPs buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 60 mm KCl, 0.1% Nonidet P40, 1× proteinase inhibitors) and sonicated by two 1-min pulses using a Fisher dismembranator fitted with a micro-tip on ice. Antibodies against USF1 (C-20, Santa Cruz), USF2 (N-18, Santa Cruz), c-Myc (N-262X, Santa Cruz), polyclonal rabbit anti-MITF, or acetylated Histone H3 (Upstate) were then added to a 10-fold ChIPs buffer diluted sample and incubated on a nutator for 3 h at room temperature. Subsequently, Ultralink protein A/G beads (Pierce) were added to the sample and a control sample and incubated for an additional hour. Immunoprecipitates were then washed twice with ChIPs buffer, twice with 500 mmNaCl ChIPs buffer and once with TE, pH 8. The immunoprecipitates were released from the beads by incubating at 65 °C for 20 min in 1% SDS/TE, and proteins were digested by proteinase K treatment side-by-side with an additional unprecipitated sample as input control. Cross-links were released by heating at 70 °C for 10 h, DNA recovered by extraction with phenol and chloroform at high salt (0.6 m sodium acetate, pH 8), and then ethanol precipitated. Semi-quantitative PCR was then performed on samples to amplify fragments spanning the 5′- or 3′-adjacent region to the E box repeat (see Fig. 2a). The forward and reverse primers for the 5′-region are 5′-TGT TAA GTA CCA CGA GGA GAA ATA-3′ and 5′-ACA TGG CCG TGA GGT AAT AAA G-3′, respectively, (annealing temperature 59 °C). The primers for the 3′-region are 5′-CAG CAC CAC CCC CTC CCT CTC ATC ATA AC-3′ and 5′-CCA CAG AGT CAA AGG GGC CAT CAT CAG C-3′ (annealing temperature 65 °C). The primers for the MITF-positive ChIP control region (intron 1 of PMEL17) are 5′-CAT AAG ATA CCC CAT TCT TTC TCC ACT T-3′ and 5′-GAG AAT GTG GTA TTG GGT AAG AAC AC-3′ (annealing temperature 57 °C). PCR was carried out for 45 s at 94 °C, 45 s at annealing temperatures as indicated for each primer set, and 90 s at 72 °C for a total 35 cycles with Taq polymerase (Fisher). Null adenovirus was purchased from Q-BIOgene. Adenoviruses encoding wild-type MITF, dominant-negative mutant MITF, or vector control encoding a fusion of green fluorescence protein-Wee1 for nuclear localization, were generated as previously described (18Wu M.

Briefly, 106 human SKMEL5 melanoma cells were plated per 100-mm plate. On the second day, cells were overlaid with 2 ml of serum-free F10 media containing 10 mm MgCl2, and concentrated adenovirus was added at multiplicity of infection of 100 for each virus. The cells were incubated at 37 °C for half an hour after which virus was removed and fresh full media was added. Total RNA was isolated with RNAqueousTM-4PCR kit (Ambion 1914) at 48 and 72 h after infection. The real-time PCR primers for human AIM-1 were 5′-CCTGGGCTTTCTGGTCAACA-3′ and 5′-ACCGCAGACGCTGTGATCA-3′. The probe for human AIM-1 were 5′-6-FAM-AGCCGGGACCGTTGTCGTCG-TAMRA-3′ (PE Biosystems). The total volume of each reaction is 25 μl including 12.5 μl 2× Master Mix without UNG (uracil-N-glycosylase), 0.625 μl MultiScribe Reverse Transcriptase and RNase inhibitor (PE Biosystems), 0.5μl of each primer (10 μm stock), 0.25 μl of the probe (5 μm stock) and 1 μl of the template at 100 ng/μl. Reverse transcription proceeded at 48 °C for 30 min. Then 40 cycles of PCR reaction were carried out at 95 °C for 15 s and at 60 °C for 1 min. Real-time PCR was carried out using ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems) with analysis using the integrated Sequence Detection System Software Version 1.7. We used human map viewer (ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) to determine that the human ortholog of Aim-1 is located on chromosome 5p. We identified a region homologous to the human Aim-1 locus on mouse chromosome 15 and noted that this site maps to the murineunderwhite locus (ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Homology/and Ref. 19Blake J.A. Eppig J.T. Richardson J.E. Bult C.J. Kadin J.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The complete mouse Aim-1 cDNA sequence (accession number AF360357) was BLASTed against the mouse Trace Archive to identify the exon/intron boundaries (TableI). Primer pairs located in the intron regions were designed to span individual exons. Each exon was amplified from the genomic DNA of uw, uwd andUwDbr mice as well as the control C57BL/6J and BALB/c strains. All PCR products matched the predicted lengths (data not shown). DNA sequencing identified mutations in all three mutant alleles, but none of their wild-type controls (Fig.1a). The uw mutant was found to harbor a 7-base pair deletion in Exon 3 ofAim-1 (Fig. 1a), which results in a 43-amino acid frameshift followed by a premature stop at codon 308 (Fig. 1,b and c). The uw allele thus encodes a protein that lacks the C-terminal 6 transmembrane domains of the predicted protein. The uwd mutant harbors a single nucleotide mutation from T to C in Exon 6 of Aim-1(Fig. 1a), which leads to a mutation from a conserved serine to proline in the tenth transmembrane domain (Fig. 1, b andc). The dominant allele UwDbrcontains a nucleotide alteration from G to A in the second exon (Fig.1a), which causes a missense point mutation of D153N (conserved residue from medaka to human) in the fourth transmembrane domain (Fig. 1, b and c). These studies thus identify Aim-1 as the mutant gene in underwhitemice.Table IExon/Intron organization of human and mouse Aim-1 geneAim-1 exon no.Exon sizeCoded amino acid no.5′-end sequence of exon3′-end sequence of exonIntron sizebpbphuman410128GTTGTAGCAGgtaagtgggc17861mouse389128GTCGTATCAGgtaagtggathuman17759tttcttttagCTTTGATTGCCTCTTCACAGgtagggaata182152mouse17759tttcttttagCTTTGGTTGCCTCTTCACAGgtagggaatahuman326109tgctttccagGTTTTGGAGGTGCTGAACAGgtaaagatgc91793mouse326109tgctttctagGTTTTGGAGGTTCTGGCCAGgtaaagatgchuman14448tttatttcagACTCGCAGGGCATGGGCCAGgtaatgaacg26834mouse14448cttttgccagAGTCAGAGGACATGGGACAGgtaacggatghuman12441tctctttcagATTGTGTACCCTTTATTCTTgtaagtcttt41785mouse12441tctctttcagATTGTATACCGTTTATTCATgtaagtgttchuman21271cttcccacagACTTTCAGAAAGAAAAGGAGgtgtgctgtc22896mouse21271ctctctacagACTTTCAGAAGGAGAAAGAGgtgggtgacahuman24874tcctttgcagAGGCAGCAGG7mouse59774tcccttgtagAAGGGGCAGG Open table in a new tab Through recognition of E-1 box DNA elements (CA(C/T)GTG) MITF is thought to modulate expression of many major pigmentation genes including tyrosinase, TYRP1, and DCT (6Hemesath T.J.

Endogenous MITF activity was manipulated in human melanoma cells (SKMEL5) by infecting with a series of adenoviruses (see “Experimental Procedures”) including null adenovirus, adenoviruses over-expressing a control green fluorescence protein fusion from the same promoter, wild-type MITF, or dominant-negative MITF (Arg-218 deletion, which preserves dimerization but ablates DNA binding by heterodimers) (6Hemesath T.J. Steingrimsson E. McGill G. Hansen M.J. Vaught J. Hodgkinson C.A. Arnheiter H. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Fisher D.E. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2770-2780Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar, 18Wu M.

Western analyses revealed that expression of adenovirus-encoded MITF proteins is maximal at about 48 h after infection and lasts until at least 96 h (data not shown). Electrophoretic mobility shift assay demonstrated that the DNA binding activities of the wild-type protein and the dominant-negative effects of the mutant protein are strongest during this same period of time (data not shown). To examine the consequences of altering endogenous MITF on AIM-1 expression, RNA was harvested from virus-infected cells 48 and 72 h after infection. Real-time (quantitative) PCR was performed on the RNA samples, and AIM-1 expression values were normalized to GAPDH quantitative PCR signals. As shown in Fig. 2, wild-type MITF stimulated AIM-1 expression significantly over baseline control while dominant-negative MITF repressed its expression. Similar results were also observed in human primary melanocytes (data not shown). These effects were consistently seen at multiple time points examined. The data suggest that MITF can modulate the expression of AIM-1 in human melanoma cells. Examination of the upstream region of the human Aim-1 gene revealed a 1.2-kb repetitive sequence containing 55 E boxes (CACGTG or CATGTG). Fig.3a depicts representative smaller repeat units seen in this region. It is unclear whether this promoter structure (or specific sequence) is conserved in the mouse. A CENSOR (20Jurka J. Klonowski P. Dagman V. Pelton P. Comput. Chem. 1996; 20: 119-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar) search on this repeat against RepBase (21Jurka J. Curr. Opin. Struct.

Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 657-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar) showed no homology to known human repetitive sequences. Also, a BLAST search against the human genome revealed only a few shorter copies of this repeat distributed in non-coding regions. Repeats can arise very quickly during genome propagation, especially if they by chance contain short transcription, recombination, or replication signals. One common mechanism for rapid generation of repeats within one or a few generations is via short repeat expansion, replication, and/or recombination errors. It appears plausible, for example, that the hexanucleotide repeat (CATGTG) might be derived from a dinucleotide repeat (CA = TG). 2G. Church, personal communication. To examine occupancy by MITF and other E box binding factors such as c-Myc, USF1, and USF2 on the AIM-1 5′-flanking region, chromatin immunoprecipitation was carried out on human primary melanocytes, human melanoma cells (SKMEL5), and IMR90 cells (human fibroblast). Primers were designed that span the 5′- or 3′-region of the repeat (Fig.3a). In primary melanocytes, but not fibroblasts (Fig.3b), PCR products were amplified in samples immunoprecipitated with an antibody directed against acetylated histone H3, a component of transcriptionally active chromatin. In addition, quantitative PCR were performed on total RNA from all three cell types. AIM-1 transcripts were detected in primary human melanocytes, SKMEL5 melanoma cells but not IMR90 fibroblasts (Fig. 3c). These results are consistent with melanocyte-restricted expression of AIM-1 (2Harada M. Li Y.F. El-Gamil M. Rosenberg S.A. Robbins P.F. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 1089-1094PubMed Google Scholar). However, the various E-box-binding proteins tested, including MITF, do not measurably interact with this region despite the consensus E-boxes. Positive control ChIPs for MITF are shown for a different E-box-containing genomic fragment (Fig. 3a). Similar results were also obtained from SKMEL5 melanoma cells, except detection of acetylated histone H3 did not extend as far in the 5′-region, perhaps reflecting differences in transcriptional regulation of AIM-1 in this unpigmented melanoma line. These results suggest that MITF or other E-box-recognizing proteins do not directly bind the E-box repeat in the melanocyte lineage. Correspondingly, luciferase reporter assays from this region (−1689 to +28 and −264 to +28) demonstrated substantially increased basal activity in melanocytes versusnon-melanocytes, but no significant responsiveness to MITF overexpression (data not shown). These data suggest that MITF does not modulate AIM-1 transcription via direct interactions at the proximal promoter, but rather likely utilizes a more remote binding element, or operates through a different transcriptional intermediate. It is also formally possible that the altered RNA levels of AIM-1 by MITF could reflect changes in RNA stability, although such an activity has not previously been described for MITF. The studies described here identify the Aim-1 gene as the locus responsible for the mouse underwhite mutations. Truncation of more than 40% of the protein in the recessiveuw mutant leads to complete loss of pigmentation and exhibits the greatest pigment deficiency of the three alleles inuw/uw mice. In contrast, the S435P mutation inuwd allele produces a mild coat color dilution in homozygotes. Thus, the uw mutation is a strong loss-of-function mutant, which might behave as a functional null while the uwd C-terminal mutation implies a partial loss of function that does not measurably interfere with the product of the remaining wild-type allele. In addition, uwheterozygotes appear normally pigmented, suggesting that haploinsufficiency does not occur for this gene, a finding consistent with other pigment loci, such as albino (19Blake J.A. Eppig J.T. Richardson J.E. Bult C.J. Kadin J.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), although quantitative measurements of pigmentation might reveal subtle differences that are not appreciated visually. The dominant inheritance pattern of UwDbrstrongly suggests that Aim-1 functions in a molecular complex with other species, possibly as a homo- or hetero-oligomer.Aim-1 bears remote sequence homology to the sucrose transporter family (1Fukamachi S. Shimada A. Shima A. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 381-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) whose oligomerization properties are not well studied although dimer or tetramer formation has been reported for other transporter families and genetic data even suggest interactions between different transporters in yeast (24Van Belle D. Andre B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 389-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Since theUwDbr mutation occurs within a putative transmembrane motif, it is likely that the altered charge of the asparagine side chain (versus aspartate) disrupts a salt bridge or other necessary secondary structure that contributes to function in a manner that does not ablate intermolecular interactions. However, despite its dominant genetic behavior, this mutation produces a milder phenotype in homozygotes as compared with the frameshift allele (uw), indicating that even in homozygous form the mutant protein retains some wild-type function. The putative transcriptional start described in this study is based on published data using 5′-RACE (1Fukamachi S. Shimada A. Shima A. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 381-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). However, more definitive methods (such as primer extension) will be needed to ascertain the transcriptional start site in mammals. This is of particular importance because the medaka AIM-1 mRNA contains an N-terminal region that is not present in the currently defined human and mouse sequences. Furthermore, no in-frame stop codon is present prior to the putative initiation ATG for human or mouse, suggesting that the current sequence may not contain the true 5′-untranslated region. Identification of a large E-box containing insertion within the human 5′-flanking region did not correlate with binding by the bHLHzip protein MITF, despite the fact that MITF could regulate endogenous AIM-1 expression levels. Thus, MITF likely regulates AIM-1 expression via an indirect mechanism (such as an intermediate transcription factor) or via an enhancer element located at a distance from this region. It is also possible that the reported transcriptional start site is incorrect (as discussed above), in which case a different promoter region may be subject to direct MITF binding and regulation. Nonetheless, AIM-1's position downstream of MITF places it into the company of multiple other genes of known importance in the pigmentation response, several of which are important as melanoma antigens. Finally, identification of AIM-1 as a rodent pigmentation gene suggests the possibility that human mutations in the same factor might occur. The uw allele displays age-dependent improvement in the eye pigmentation phenotype and complete absence of pigment in the fur (25Dickie M. Mouse Newsletter. 1964; 30: 30Google Scholar, 26Lehman A.L.

Interestingly, Minimal Pigment Oculocutaneous Albinism patients (affected gene unknown) display similar phenotypes: no skin or eye pigment at birth and development of detectable eye pigment during the first decade of life (27King R.A. Wirtschafter J.D. Olds D.P. Brumbaugh J. Clin. Genet. 1986; 29: 42-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In addition, while this article was under review, M. Brilliant and colleagues published the identification of two of the underwhite alleles described in this study and further reported the assignment of theunderwhite locus to human oculocutaneous albinism type 4 (OCA4) (28Newton J.M.

The muscle precursors form organs by executing tissue-specific migrations and cell fusions. We identified a novel gene, jelly belly (jeb), which is required for visceral mesoderm development. jeb encodes a secreted protein that contains an LDL receptor repeat. In jeb mutants, visceral mesoderm precursors form, but they fail to migrate or differentiate normally; no visceral muscles develop. Jeb protein is produced in somatic muscle precursors and taken up by visceral muscle precursors. jeb reveals a signaling process in which somatic muscle precursors support the proper migration and differentiation of visceral muscle cells. Later in embryogenesis, jeb is transcribed in neurons and Jeb protein is found in axons."

The immunosuppressant activity of NSAID correlates with their ability to block transcription factors required for the expression of inducible response genes triggered by T-cell antigen receptor (TCR) engagement. Whereas the inhibition of nuclear factor-κB by aspirin and sodium salicylate can be partly accounted for by their binding to IκB kinase-β, the broad range of transcriptional targets of NSAID suggests that the products of COX activity might affect one or more among the early steps in the TCR-signaling cascade. Here we show that the inhibition of NF-AT activation by NSAID correlates with a selective inhibition of p38 MAP kinase induction. The suppression of TCR-dependent p38 activation by NSAID can be fully overcome by prostaglandin E2, underlining the requirement for COX activity in p38 activation. Furthermore, the inhibition of COX-1 results in defective induction of theCOX-2 gene, which behaves as an early TCR responsive gene.

Two COX isoforms have been identified in eucaryotic cells. Although closely related by their enzymatic activity, COX-1 and COX-2 are implicated in different facets of the interaction of cells with their internal and external environments. COX-1 is constitutively expressed in most cells and is thought to play an important role in tissue homeostasis. In contrast, COX-2 is inducibly expressed in a more limited array of cell types in response to proinflammatory and mitogenic stimuli and is considered as the crucial mediator of inflammation (1Smith W.L. DeWitt D.L. Garavito R.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 145-182Google Scholar). In agreement with the dominant role of COX-2 in inflammation, COX-2-selective NSAID have anti-inflammatory activity but limited unwanted side effects such as gastric damage and hemorrhage, typical of nonselective NSAID, which are likely to be accounted for by the inhibition of COX-1 (2DeWitt D.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 625-631Google Scholar). NSAID harbor additional immunomodulatory properties that have been correlated with their ability to block the activation of transcription factors implicated in the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and are likely to result, at least in part, from their well characterized activity on COX as exemplified by the inhibition of NF-κB by cyclopentenone PG through covalent modification of IκB kinase β (3Rossi A. Kapahi P. Natoli G. Takahashi T. Chen Y. Karin M. Santoro M.G. Nature. 2000; 403: 103-108Google Scholar). However, additional COX-independent targets of NSAID are emerging, including IκB kinase itself (4Yin M.-J. Yamamoto Y. Gaynor R. Nature. 1998; 396: 77-80Google Scholar) and the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor δ (5He T.-C. Chan T.A. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Cell. 1999; 99: 335-345Google Scholar). Although the principal cellular targets of NSAID are inflammatory cells such as macrophages and neutrophils, NSAID suppress T-cell proliferation, expression of surface activation markers such as CD25 and CD71, and the production of cytokines such as interleukin-2, interferon-γ, and tumor necrosis factor-α (6Kopp E. Ghosh S. Science. 1994; 265: 956-958Google Scholar, 7Kazmi S.M.I. Plante R.K. Visconti V. Taylor G.R. Zhou L. Lau C.Y. J. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 57: 299-310Google Scholar, 8Hall V. Wolf R.E. J.

The immunosuppressant activity of NSAID correlates with their ability to block transcription factors required for the expression of inducible response genes triggered by the T-cell antigen receptor (TCR) following encounter with antigens, including NF-κB, NF-AT, and activated protein 1 (5He T.-C. Chan T.A. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Cell. 1999; 99: 335-345Google Scholar, 6Kopp E. Ghosh S. Science. 1994; 265: 956-958Google Scholar, 9Iñiguez M.A. Punzón C. Fresno M. J.

The broad range of transcriptional targets of NSAID suggests that these drugs not only inhibit the distal components of individual transcription factor activation pathways but might also affect one or more steps in the early TCR-signaling cascade leading to transcription factor activation, potentially implicating COX in this process. In support for a potential role of COX in T-cell activation, COX-1 is constitutively expressed in T-cells, whereas the gene encoding COX-2 is inducibly activated as an early response gene in response to T-cell-activating stimuli (9Iñiguez M.A. Punzón C. Fresno M. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 111-119Google Scholar). Here we have assessed the effect of NSAID on the TCR-signaling cascade. Using as a read-out NF-AT activation, we show that NSAID affect the MAP kinase cascade and specifically the activation of p38 MAP kinase, an effect that can be reversed by PGE2 and is therefore dependent on COX activity. Furthermore, the inhibition of COX-1 results in defective induction of COX-2 expression in response to TCR engagement, highlighting a sequential role of COX-1 and COX-2 in TCR signaling to p38. Cell lines included a stably transfected Jurkat T-cell line expressing luciferase under the control of a trimer of the distal NF-AT binding site on the human interleukin-2 gene promoter (11Di Baldari C.T. Somma M.M. Majolini M.B. Ulivieri C. Milia E. Telford J.L. Biologicals. 1998; 26: 1-5Google Scholar), the monocyte line U937, and the Raji B-leukemia cell line. A stably transfected Jurkat T-cell line expressing luciferase under the control of a trimer of a NF-κB binding site was generated as described previously (11Di Baldari C.T. Somma M.M. Majolini M.B. Ulivieri C. Milia E. Telford J.L. Biologicals. 1998; 26: 1-5Google Scholar). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from whole blood by density centrifugation on Ficoll-Paque (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) and subsequently depleted of macrophages by adherence. NSAID, SB203580, PD098059, and PGE2 were purchased from Calbiochem and Sigma. Phosphospecific antibodies recognizing the phosphorylated active forms of p38 and Erk1/Erk2 were from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Anti-p38 and anti-Erk2 antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), anti-actin mAb was from Amersham Pharmacia, and anti-COX-2 mAb was from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, UK). IgG antibodies from OKT3 hybridoma supernatants were purified on Mabtrap (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) and titrated by flow cytometry. Anti-IgM antibodies were purchased from Cappel (Durham, NC). All NSAID at the highest concentration used were tested for lack of toxicity by trypan blue exclusion. RAV-2 reverse transcriptase and Taqpolymerase were purchased from Takara Shutzo Co. (Shiga, Japan) and Roche Diagnostics SpA (Milan, Italy). To assay p38 and Erk1/Erk2 phosphorylation, 2–5 × 106 Jurkat cells or PBL were activated by TCR cross-linking for 1 min at 37 °C using the anti-CD3 mAb OKT3 as described previously (12Plyte S. Majolini M.B. Pacini S. Scarpini F. Bianchini C. Lanfrancone L. Pelicci P.G. Baldari C.T. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1529-1537Google Scholar). Macrophages and U937 cells were activated with 10 μg/ml LPS (Sigma) for 10 min at 37 °C. Raji cells were activated by surface Ig cross-linking for 1 min at 37 °C using anti-IgM antibodies. To analyze COX-2 expression, cells were activated either by TCR/CD3 cross-linking on secondary antibody-coated plates using OKT3 mAb (PBL) or 10 μg/ml LPS (macrophages and U937) or by a combination of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (50 ng/ml) and A32187 (100 ng/ml) for 16–24 h. NSAID or carrier were added to the culture medium 1 h prior to activation, and PGE2 was added to culture medium 30 min prior to activation. Cell lysates, obtained as described previously (12Plyte S. Majolini M.B. Pacini S. Scarpini F. Bianchini C. Lanfrancone L. Pelicci P.G. Baldari C.T. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1529-1537Google Scholar), were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose filters, and subjected to immunoblot using peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences) and a chemoluminescence detection kit (Pierce). To assay NF-AT activation, reporter Jurkat cells were activated either by CD3 cross-linking on a secondary antibody-coated plate using OKT3 mAb or by a combination of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (100 ng/ml) and A23187 (500 ng/ml) as described previously (11Di Baldari C.T. Somma M.M. Majolini M.B. Ulivieri C. Milia E. Telford J.L. Biologicals. 1998; 26: 1-5Google Scholar). NSAID or carrier was added 10 min prior to activation. With the exception of time course experiments, cells were collected 5 h after activation and processed for luciferase assays as described previously (10Dong Z. Huang C. Brown R.E. Ma W.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9962-9970Google Scholar). All samples were in duplicate, and each experiment was repeated 3–5 times. 5 × 105 cells/sample were resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10 μg/ml insulin, 5.5 μg/ml transferrin, 6.5 ng/ml sodium selenite (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 20 μm 2′,7′dichlorofluorescein diacetate medium (Sigma) and preincubated 30 min in the dark at room temperature. Carrier or NSAID were added, and cells were further incubated for 10 min on ice. Cells were subsequently spun, resuspended in the same medium, added with saturating concentrations of OKT3, and incubated for 30 min on ice. After two washes in phosphate-buffered saline/1% serum, cells were resuspended in 500 μl of 2′,7′dichlorofluorescein diacetate medium, added with carrier or NSAID, incubated for further 30 min at 37 °C, washed in phosphate-buffered saline/1% serum, and analyzed by flow cytometry in a Becton Dickinson FACScan (San Jose, CA). Total RNA was extracted from Jurkat cells and either not activated or activated for 2, 4, 6, 8, and 16 h by TCR/CD3 cross-linking as described above using the RNA WIZ reagent (Ambion Inc, Austin, Texas). Reverse transcription-PCR was carried out using as first strand oligo(dT), whereas pairs of primers specific for human COX-2 (9Iñiguez M.A. Punzón C. Fresno M. J.

Immunol. 1999; 163: 111-119Google Scholar) in a Perkin-Elmer 2400 Thermal Cycler (Norwalk, CT). PCR products were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, and the intensity of the ethidium bromide-stained bands was quantitated by laser densitometry. The identity of theCOX-2-specific reverse transcription-PCR product was confirmed by automatic sequencing. Confocal microscopy was carried out on Jurkat cells transiently transfected by the DEAE/dextran procedure as described previously (12Plyte S. Majolini M.B. Pacini S. Scarpini F. Bianchini C.

Scanning of the human COX-2gene promoter (GenBankTM accession number AF276953) for transcription factor binding sites was carried out using the matrix search program TRANSFAC MatInspector (14Wingender E.

To assess their impact on the TCR-signaling cascade, we assayed the capacity of NSAID to inhibit the activation of the transcription factor NF-AT using as a read-out a reporter Jurkat T-cell line stably transfected with a plasmid encoding firefly luciferase under the control of NF-AT (11Di Baldari C.T. Somma M.M. Majolini M.B. Ulivieri C. Milia E. Telford J.L. Biologicals. 1998; 26: 1-5Google Scholar). The nonselective COX inhibitors, aspirin and ibuprofen, the COX-1-selective inhibitor resveratrol (15Jang M. Cai L. Udeani G.O. Slowing K.V. Thomas C.F. Beecher C.W. Fong H.H. Farnsworth N.R. Kinghorn A.D. Mehta R.G. Moon R.C. Pezzuto J.M. Science. 1997; 275: 218-220Google Scholar), and the COX-2-selective inhibitor NS-398 (16Futaki N. Arai I. Hamasaka Y. Takahashi S. Higuchi S. Otomo S. J. Pharm. Pharmacol. 1993; 45: 753-755Google Scholar) all inhibited in a dose-dependent fashion the activation of NF-AT induced either by triggering the TCR/CD3 complex with agonistic mAb (Fig. 1) or pharmacologically using a combination of phorbol ester and a calcium ionophore (data not shown). A similar profile of inhibition was also observed in a Jurkat line stably transfected with an NF-κB/luciferase reporter and activated using the same pharmacological agonists (data not shown). Hence, both COX-1 and COX-2 activities are required for TCR signaling in T-cells. Although COX-2-specific mRNA was detectable as early as 2 h after stimulation (Fig. 2A), NS-398 only partially blocked NF-AT (Fig. 1) and NF-κB (data not shown) activation, suggesting a dominant role for the costitutively expressed COX-1 in this process.Figure 2COX-1 is required for the inducible expression of COX-2.A, time course analysis by reverse transcription-PCR of COX-2 expression in Jurkat T-cells.

Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 259-274Google Scholar). We assessed the effect of NSAID on both pathways. The inhibitors of both Erk and p38 MAPKs reduced NF-AT activation in response to TCR engagement (Fig. 1). However TCR-induced p38 activity but not Erk1/Erk2 activity was dramatically inhibited both by the nonselective and by the COX-1-selective NSAID as assessed by immunoblot analysis of Jurkat T-cell lysates with phosphospecific antibodies (Fig. 3A). Consistent with the lack of COX-2 expression before cell stimulation (Fig. 2A and Ref. 9Iñiguez M.A. Punzón C. Fresno M. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 111-119Google Scholar), no effect on early p38 activation was observed in the presence of the COX-2 inhibitor NS-398. Similar results were obtained on purified peripheral blood lymphocytes (data not shown). Hence, whereas Erk and p38 MAPKs are both required for TCR signaling to NF-AT, NSAID selectively inhibited p38 activation. The inhibition of p38 by both the nonselective and the COX-1-selective NSAID was also observed in Raji B-cells stimulated with anti-IgM antibodies (data not shown). Although both mitogenic stimuli and oxidative stress can induce p38 activation (18Ono K. Han J. Cell. Signalling. 2000; 12: 1-13Google Scholar), no effect of NSAID on p38 activation was observed either in normal LPS-activated macrophages or in H2O2-treated Jurkat T-cells (Fig. 3B). Hence, NSAID selectively affect coupling of the mitogenic pathways triggered by the T-cell and B-cell antigen receptors to p38 activation. Whereas an increase in ROS, which contributes to p38 (19Finkel T. FEBS Lett. 2000; 476: 52-54Google Scholar) activation, is induced by TCR engagement (20Tatla S. Woodhead V. Foreman J.C. Chain B.M. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1999; 26: 14-24Google Scholar), no effect of any of the NSAID was observed on the TCR-dependent up-regulation of intracellular ROS with the exception of resveratrol, which has anti-oxidant properties (15Jang M. Cai L. Udeani G.O. Slowing K.V. Thomas C.F. Beecher C.W. Fong H.H. Farnsworth N.R. Kinghorn A.D. Mehta R.G. Moon R.C. Pezzuto J.M. Science. 1997; 275: 218-220Google Scholar) (data not shown). The data are in agreement with a role for ROS upstream of COX (1Smith W.L. DeWitt D.L. Garavito R.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 145-182Google Scholar) and rule out the molecules implicated in the inducible ROS production as the target of NSAID responsible for their inhibitory effect on p38 activation. NSAID did not affect the Ca2+/calcineurin pathway. As shown in Fig. 3D, NF-AT localization was completely cytosolic in Jurkat cells transiently transfected with a construct encoding green fluorescent protein-tagged NF-AT1 in the absence of stimulation, whereas a massive NF-AT translocation to the nucleus fully repressible by cyclosporin A was observed following treatment with a calcium ionophore. Ibuprofen did not affect the inducible nuclear translocation of NF-AT (Fig. 3D). Hence, the suppression of NF-AT activation by NSAID is achieved by inhibition of the MAPK pathway and specifically of p38 activation but not of the Ca2+/calcineurin pathway. Of note, although in heterologous cells, active p38 has been shown to dampen NF-AT activity by promoting its phosphorylation-dependent export from the nucleus (21Del Arco G. Mattinez-Martinez S. Maldonado J.L. Ortega-Perez I. Redondo M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13871-13878Google Scholar). In Jurkat T-cells, both NSAID and the p38 inhibitor SB203580 blocked NF-AT activation (Fig. 1) in agreement with the requirement for p38 in interleukin-2 production (22Matsuda S. Moriguchi T. Koyasu S. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12378-12382Google Scholar), suggesting that p38 might play opposing roles in the early activation and subsequent deactivation of gene expression. The block by NSAID of TCR-dependent p38 activation suggests that the products of COX activity are required for TCR signaling. PGE2 indeed increased both the low basal level of NF-AT activity and its response to TCR triggering (Fig. 1). Furthermore, the treatment of Jurkat cells with PGE2 resulted in the up-regulation of p38 activity, but not Erk1/Erk2, in the absence of stimulation (Fig. 3C). Of note, PGE2 could fully overcome the inhibition of TCR-dependent p38 activation by both ibuprofen (data not shown) and the COX-1-selective inhibitor resveratrol (Fig. 3C). Hence, the reduction in PGE2 synthesis by COX can account for the inhibitory effect of NSAID on TCR-dependent p38 and NF-AT activation. In agreement with a role for COX upstream of p38 activation, PGE2 failed to overcome the inhibition of NF-AT activation by the p38 inhibitor SB203580 (data not shown). p38 can be activated by distinct pathways triggered by mitogenic stimuli and cellular stress (18Ono K. Han J. Cell. Signalling. 2000; 12: 1-13Google Scholar). The selective effect of NSAID on the activation of p38 triggered by the TCR and B-cell antigen receptor as opposed to LPS or H2O2 (Fig. 3, A and B) suggests that PGE2, which is produced in response to all these stimuli, does not directly activate p38 but a component upstream of p38 in the antigen receptor-signaling cascade. Specifically, because tyrosine kinase-dependent pathways leading to Erk and p38 activation are believed to diverge at the level of the small GTPases Ras and Rac, respectively (23Waskiewicz A.J. Cooper J.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 798-805Google Scholar), our data indicate a requirement for COX in the serine-threonine kinase cascade initiated by Rac. p38 activity is required both for COX-2 gene expression and for post-transcriptional stabilization of COX-2 mRNA (24Pouliot M. Baillargeon J. Lee J.C. Cleland L.G. James M.J. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 4930-4937Google Scholar, 25Jang B.C. Sanchez T. Schaefers H.J. Trifan O.C. Liu C.H. Creminon C. Huang C.K. Hla T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39507-39515Google Scholar). The block in p38 activation by nonselective and COX-1-selective NSAID (Fig.3A) suggests that COX-1, which is constitutively expressed in T-cells (9Iñiguez M.A. Punzón C. Fresno M. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 111-119Google Scholar), is implicated in the initial activation of p38 and might therefore be required for the induction of COX-2 expression. To assess this possibility, we analyzed COX-2 expression in normal PBL. TCR/CD3 stimulation as well as a combination of phorbol ester and calcium ionophore induced the expression of COX-2, albeit at levels significantly lower than in macrophages stimulated with LPS or pharmacological agonists (Fig. 2B). Of note, the monocyte line U937 constitutively expressed high levels of COX-2 (Fig.2B), which were parallelled by a high constitutive p38 activity (Fig. 3B) in support of a key role for p38 in COX-2 expression. A pretreatment of PBL with the COX-1 inhibitor resveratrol completely blocked the TCR-dependent expression of COX-2 (Fig. 2C). Hence, COX-1 participates in the TCR-dependent induction of the gene encoding COX-2 probably by contributing to p38 activation. In agreement with the lack of effect of NSAID on LPS-dependent p38 activation in macrophages (Fig. 3B), the induction of COX-2 expression by LPS is not impaired in COX-1−/− macrophages (26Langenbach R. Morham S.G. Tiano H.F. Loftin C.D. Ghanayem B.I. Chulada P.C. Mahler J.F. Lee C.A. Goulding E.H. Kluckman K.D. Kim H.S. Smithies O. Cell. 1995; 83: 483-492Google Scholar). Interestingly, p38 is required for NF-AT activation (Fig. 1) and interleukin-2 expression (22Matsuda S. Moriguchi T. Koyasu S. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12378-12382Google Scholar). Furthermore, cyclosporin A, which potently blocks NF-AT activation, also inhibits the induction of COX-2 gene expression, suggesting a role for NF-AT in this process. In support of this possibility, scanning of the ∼500-bp region upstream of theCOX-2 gene containing the essential elements for its transcriptional regulation (27Yamamoto K Arakawa T. Ueda N. Yamamoto S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31315-31320Google Scholar) revealed four potential NF-AT binding sites at positions −308/−297, −292/−281, −109/−98 and −80/−69. The immunosuppressant activity of NSAID on T-cells underlines a role for COX activity not only in the induction of proinflammatory cytokine gene expression during inflammation but also in the normal process of lymphocyte activation. COX-2 has indeed been identified as an early response gene in peripheral T-cells (9Iñiguez M.A. Punzón C. Fresno M. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 111-119Google Scholar). Furthermore, genetic and pharmacological evidence supports a key role for COX-1, specifically mediated by PGE2 in the CD4−CD8−to the CD4+CD8+ transition during thymocyte development (28Rocca B. Spain L.M. Pure E. Langenbach R. Patronom C. FitzGerald G.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1469-1477Google Scholar). COX-2-mediated PGE2 synthesis by thymic stromal cells is also required for the maturation of CD4+thymocytes (28Rocca B. Spain L.M. Pure E. Langenbach R. Patronom C. FitzGerald G.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1469-1477Google Scholar). Our data show that COX-1 is a strategic component of the TCR-signaling cascade in that it promotes the activation of p38 and of transcription factors regulated by this MAPK. Among the transcriptional targets of these factors is COX-2. In this scenario, the initial burst of ROS production following TCR engagement, as well as the rapid early increase in the concentration of arachidonic acid due to the sequential activity of phospholipase Cγ and cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2), would result in the up-regulation of COX-1 activity and increased synthesis of PG, thereby promoting p38 activation. This would in turn lead to COX-2 expression and a delayed phase of PG synthesis. In this context, the partial inhibition of NF-AT activation by the COX-2 inhibitor NS-398 (Fig. 1 and Ref. 9Iñiguez M.A. Punzón C. Fresno M. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 111-119Google Scholar) suggests that COX-2-dependent PG production might contribute to sustaining NF-AT activity at later stages of T-cell activation. Interestingly, mast cells from cPLA2−/− mice fail to express COX-2 in response to cytokines, however arachidonic acid restores COX-2 expression (29Fujishima H. Sanchez Mejia R.O. Bingham C.O. Lam B.K. Sapirstein A. Bonventre J.V. Austen K.F. Arm J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4803-4807Google Scholar), supporting our proposed role for COX-1-dependent PG production in the regulation ofCOX-2 transcription. Collectively, our data not only provide novel insight into the mechanisms underlying the immunosuppressant activity of NSAID in T-cells but suggest that selective p38 inhibitors might be a valid alternative to classical immunosuppressants as a tool to control T-cell activation in disease.

https://openalex.org/W2172024880,"The activity of the transcription factor σF is confined to one (the forespore) of two cells created by asymmetric division during sporulation in B. subtilis. We show that σF activation is partly governed by the position of the gene for the unstable anti-σF factor SpoIIAB. Because cytokinesis precedes chromosome segregation, most of the chromosome is translocated into the forespore after division. We hypothesize that because spoIIAB enters the forespore late, SpoIIAB lost to proteolysis is temporarily not replenished. Thus, chromosome asymmetry would be translated into the asymmetric distribution of SpoIIAB. Supporting this idea, transposition of spoIIAB to sites present in the forespore at the time of division impaired sporulation when a second pathway that participates in σF activation was disabled."

Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity indicated that there were interactions between αA- (or αB-) and βB2- or γC-crystallins but with an intensity of one-third that of αA-αB interactions. Hsp27, a member of the family of the small heat-shock proteins, showed a similar interaction property with αB-crystallin. Using the N- and C-terminal domain-truncated mutants, we demonstrated that both domains were important in the αA-crystallin self-interaction, but that only the C-terminal domain was important in the αB-crystallin self-interaction.

Cataract: Biochemistry, Epidemiology, and Pharmacology. Chapman & Hall, London1991: 195-217Google Scholar). They have distinct structures and/or functions. However, little is known about whether they interact with one another. From the functional viewpoint that cellular functions arise basically from the formation of protein complexes, it is reasonable to assume that protein-protein interactions exist among the proteins in lens cells, and that the interactions are the basic mechanisms for lens transparency. Traditionally, a short range order among crystallins was thought to be sufficient to explain lens transparency (2Benedek G.B. Appl. Opt. 1971; 10: 459-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar, 3Delaye M. Tardieu A. Nature. 1983; 302: 415-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar, 4Bettelheim F.A. Maisel H.

Some attempts to detect the protein-protein interactions among crystallins at high concentrations using biochemical and spectroscopic studies (5Siezen R.J. Owen E.A. Biophys.

Biopolymers. 1981; 20: 2093-2120Crossref Scopus (468) Google Scholar). Detection of protein-protein interactions by spectroscopy, such as circular dichroism and fluorescence, usually is based on conformational changes, which at high concentrations may be appreciable even in the absence of interactions. Other techniques such as light scattering, which is not conformation-specific, provide some convincing evidence for protein-protein interactions among crystallins (11Mach H. Trautman P.A. Thomson J.A. Lewis R.V. Middaugh C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4844-4848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Bettelheim F.A. Chen A. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 1998; 22: 247-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The report by Mach et al. (11Mach H. Trautman P.A. Thomson J.A. Lewis R.V. Middaugh C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4844-4848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) indicates that the ability of α-crystallin to associate is inhibited by the presence of γ- or β-crystallin, possibly through the interaction between α-crystallin and γ- or β-crystallin. A more recent report also supports protein-protein interactions among crystallins by showing an enhanced thermodynamic stability of α-crystallin in the presence of γ-crystallin or a mixture of γ- and β-crystallins (12Bettelheim F.A. Chen A. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 1998; 22: 247-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). However, evidence for protein-protein interactions from these two reports is indirect. To obtain direct evidence, we turn to a two-hybrid system assay, which is an in vivo assay and is physiologically more relevant than in vitro study. The earlier two-hybrid system designed in a yeast host (13Fields S. Song O.K. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4799) Google Scholar,14Bartel P.L. Fields S. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 254: 241-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar) exploits the modular nature of a transcriptional activator that contains two domains, a DNA-binding domain (BD)1 and a transcription-activation domain (AD). Reconstitution of these domains in trans restores their activity. This objective is achieved by making two fusion proteins. The first fusion is between the BD and a bait protein, and the second fusion is between AD and a prey or target protein. Both fusions are expressed in the presence of a reporter gene. The interaction of these two fused proteins restores activation of the transcriptional activator, and turning on the reporter gene allows the cells to be identified. So far there are only two reports of crystallin interactions in the yeast two-hybrid system (15Boelens W.C. Croes Y. de Ruwe M. de Reu L. de Jong W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28085-28090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 16Liu C. Welsh M.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 255: 256-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The first of which is a study of protein-protein interactions between αB-crystallin and its C- and N-terminal truncated mutants as well as some nonspecific mutants. The major finding is that the conserved C-terminal domain is essential for the interaction (15Boelens W.C. Croes Y. de Ruwe M. de Reu L. de Jong W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28085-28090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The second study deals with the interaction between αB-crystallin and full-length and fragmented Hsp27, and again the C-terminal region of Hsp27 is responsible for interactions (16Liu C. Welsh M.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 255: 256-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Hsp27 and αB-crystallin are two members of the highly homologous small heat-shock proteins (17Ingolia T.D. Craig E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 2360-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). Although these two reports present some interesting results, they are far from comprehensive and do not include β- and γ-crystallins. In addition, the yeast two-hybrid system has significant limitations. The host yeast, although a eukaryote, is far removed from human, mammalian, and higher eukaryotic organisms. Therefore, the use of a mammalian system for studying lens protein-protein interactions may be more appropriate than the use of the yeast system (18Dang C.V. Barrett J. Villa-Garcia M. Resar L.M. Kato G.J. Fearon E.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 954-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Mammalian proteins are likely to retain their native conformation in a mammalian host, and the results would probably represent biologically significant interactions. In the present studies, we used a mammalian two-hybrid system to assay the protein-protein interactions among the three major crystallins and with a small heat-shock protein Hsp27. We have cloned αA-, αB-, βB2-, and γC-crystallins (19Sun T.-X. Das B.K. Liang J.J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6220-6225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 20Fu L. Liang J.J.N. Mol. Vis. 2001; 7: 178-182PubMed Google Scholar) and used them in this study. αA-, βB2-, and γC-Crystallins are the major components of α-, β-, and γ-crystallins, respectively (21Lampi K.J. Ma Z. Shih M. Shearer T.R. Smith J.B. Smith D.L. David L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2268-2275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that there are specific interactions among these crystallins in both homogenous and heterogeneous systems. The mammalian Matchmaker two-hybrid assay kit, obtained from CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA), contains three vectors, pM-cloning vector for the DNA binding domain of the GAL4, pVP16-cloning vector for the transcriptional activation domain of VP16, and pG5CAT reporter vector. Cell culture reagents were purchased from Invitrogen. The monoclonal antibodies specific to GAL4 DNA-BD and to GAL4-AD were purchased fromCLONTECH. Two sets of constructs were generated from the two vectors, pM and pVP16. αA-, αB-, βB2-, and γC-Crystallin genes were subcloned from previously prepared plasmids pAED4-αA, pAED4-αB, pET-βB2, and pET-γC (19Sun T.-X.

Vis. 2001; 7: 178-182PubMed Google Scholar) into the pM and pVP16 vectors. PCR was performed for each gene using the appropriate 5′ and 3′ primers (see TableI). All of the primers were incorporated with EcoRI and XbaI restriction sites, and the PCR products were digested by the restriction enzyme EcoRI and XbaI and subcloned into BD and AD vectors, respectively, to yield plasmids pM-αA, pM-αB, pM-βB2, and pM-γC and pVP-αA, pVP-αB, pVP-βB2, and pVP-γC. All constructs were verified by Sanger sequencing in an ABI Automatic Sequencing System (PerkinElmer Applied Biosystems Inc, Foster City, CA) at Brigham and Women's Hospital automatic sequencing and genotyping facilities. The primers were custom-synthesized by Invitrogen.Table IThe 5′ and 3′ primers for subcloning experiments5′ Primer3′ PrimerαACGGAATTCATGGACGTGACCATCGCTCTAGATTAGGACGAGGGAGCαBCACCTAGAATTCATGGACATCGCCGCAATCTAGACTATTTCTTGGGGGCTβB2CAGGAATTCATGGCCTCAGATCACCATGGTCTAGAGGGCACTAGTTGGγCGGAATTCATGGGGAAGATCACCTTCCGGTAGTGTTAATCTAGATTAATαAnCGGAATTCATGGACGTGACCATCGCTCTAGATGTCCCGGTCGGATCGαAcGAGGTTGAATTCGACCGGGACAAGCGCTCTAGATTAGGACGAGGGAGCαBnCACCTAGAATTCATGGACATCGCCTCCAGTGTTCTAGAAGCTGGGTGCαBcGGAATTCCTGGAGAAGGACAGGTTCGCAATCTAGACTATTTCTTGGGGGCTHsp27CGGAATTCATGACCGAGCGCCGCGTGCTCTAGATTTACTTGGCGGCAGTThe underlined sequences are EcoRI and XbaI restriction sites for 5′ and 3′ primers, respectively.

For the N-terminal gene fragments (αAn with amino acid residues 1–68 and αBn with amino acid residues 1–70) and the C-terminal gene fragments (αAc with amino acid residues 68–173 and αBc with amino acid residues 70–175), a similar PCR was performed using the appropriate primers (Table I), and each PCR product was subcloned into pVP16 vector. For subcloning of the Hsp27 full-length gene, PCR was performed using the plasmid pT7T3D-Pac (ATCC 834387, American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) as a template and the two primers (Table I). The PCR product was subcloned into pM and pVP16 vectors. HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (low glucose, GlutaMAX) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Cells were seeded at ∼6.6 × 104/well in six well plates 1 day before transfection. Transfections were performed with the LipofectAMINE. The detailed protocol was provided in the kit. All three plasmids were cotransfected into HeLa cells. 2.0 μg of both the pM-based plasmids and VP16-based plasmids, 1.0 μg of reporter plasmid pG5CAT, and 6.0 μl of LipofectAMINEreagent were used per well. After cells were cultured for 72 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2, the cells were harvested and lysed for CAT activity assay using the CAT enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Each experiment was done in duplicate, and three independent transfections were performed. Basal control (pM and pVP16), X-control (pM and pVP16-X), and Y-control (pM and pVIP-Y) were included. The inclusion of X- and Y-controls was to ensure that X or Y protein did not function autonomously as a transcriptional activator. The data for basal control were used for the conversion of CAT activity to -fold activation. The transfected cells were lysed, and the cell extracts (containing CAT enzyme) were added to the wells of a microtiter plate, which was precoated with a polyclonal antibody to CAT. All CAT in the cell extracts bound to the polyclonal antibody to CAT on the plate surface. A digoxigenin-labeled antibody to CAT was added to bind to CAT, and an antibody to digoxigenin conjugated to peroxidase was added to bind to the digoxigenin. Finally, the peroxidase substrate ABTS was added. The peroxidase enzyme catalyzed the cleavage of the substrate, yielding a colored reaction product. The absorbance of the sample was determined with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader and was directly correlated to the level of CAT present in the cell extracts. The results were normalized with respect to total protein concentration determined by the Pierce BCA assay (22Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klent D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 150: 76-80Crossref Scopus (18349) Google Scholar). Expressions of αA-, αB-, βB2-, γC-crystallins, and Hsp27-BD fusion and AD fusion proteins were analyzed by Western blot analysis. Proteins from cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline buffer for 30 min followed by incubation with monoclonal antibody specific to GAL4 DNA-BD or VP16-AD (1:1000 dilution) at 4 °C for 16 h. The membrane was then washed and incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (Bio-Rad) in Tris-buffered saline buffer (1:1000 dilution) at room temperature. This incubation was followed by three 10-min washes in Tween 20-Tris-buffered saline. Protein bands were detected by enhanced ECL. 2 μg of both the pM-based plasmids and VP16-based plasmids were cotransfected into HeLa cells. 48 h after transfection, cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 120 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1% Triton X-100, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmsodium vanadate, 1 mm sodium fluoride, and 1 mmEDTA for 30 min on ice and then sonicated for 10 s. Particulate matter was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 g for 10 min at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitation was carried out with mixing at 4 °C for 16 h with antibodies (anti-αA-, αB-, βB2- and γC-crystallin polyclonal antibodies). A slurry of protein A/protein G agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) was added, and the system was rotated for 2 h. The beads were washed five times with lysis buffer. The resulting immunoprecipitated immunocomplexes were solubilized and boiled in 1× SDS buffer for 5 min. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to membranes. Blots were probed with monoclonal antibody specific to DNA-BD horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody and detected by ECL. Transfected cells were examined for the distribution of BD and AD fusion proteins. HeLa cells were grown and transfected on chamber slides. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100, and blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline followed by incubation with polyclonal antibodies to αA-, αB-, βB2- and γC-crystallins and monoclonal antibody to Hsp27, respectively. The slides were then washed and incubated for 1 h in the dark with green fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG and goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 1:200 dilutions. The cells were viewed with a fluorescence microscope (Eclipse TE300, Nikon Corp., Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a high performance C-imaging system (Compix, Tualatin, OR). The CAT activities for various heterogeneous systems, such as αA-αB and αA-βB2, indicated a very efficient interaction between αA- and αB-crystallins (Fig.1A). The interactions of other heterogeneous systems were rather weak but significantly greater than those of the controls. The same intense interaction was observed when the two proteins were cloned in reverse order (e.g. αB-αA and βB2-αA) (data not shown), indicating that the interactions were not vector-specific. The results of coimmunoprecipitation confirmed the observed interactions (Fig. 1B, top panel). Western blots indicated complex formation between two crystallins, and the αA-αB system showed the strongest staining intensity, which was consistent with the results of the two-hybrid system assays. The pattern of direct immunoblotting with monoclonal antibody specific to DNA-BD indicated that fusion proteins were expressed fairly equally (Fig. 1B, bottom panel). As assessed by two-hybrid system (Fig.2A), both αA- and αB-crystallins showed considerable self-interaction, whereas βB2- and γC-crystallins showed a rather weak self-interaction. These results were expected, because both αA- and αB-crystallins are oligomer proteins. There are intersubunit interactions responsible for the oligomerization (23Kim K.K. Kim R. Kim S.H. Nature. 1998; 394: 595-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar, 24Muchowski P.J. Wu G.J.S. Liang J.J.N. Adman E.T. Clark J.I. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 397-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence cell staining indicated that the majority of αA-AD or αB-AD and αA-BD or αB-BD fusion proteins were located in the nucleus (Fig.2B), suggesting that either oligomer αA- and αB-crystallin were able to enter the nucleus or the freshly expressed αA- and αB-crystallins were in a monomer state. Other fusion proteins showed a similar nuclear localization (data not shown). There was a strong interaction between Hsp27 and αA- or αB-crystallin but a weak interaction between Hsp27 and βB2-crystallin and a very weak or no interaction between Hsp27 and γC-crystallin (Fig.3A), results confirmed by immunoprecipitation assays (Fig. 3B, top). The direct immunoblotting with monoclonal antibody specific to GAL4 DNA-BD showed an expression of almost equal levels for various BD fusion proteins (Fig. 3B, bottom). The interaction between the wild-type αA-crystallin and the αAn mutant was slightly greater than that between αA-crystallin and the αAc mutant, indicating that the N-terminal domain was more important than the C-terminal domain in the αA-crystallin self-interaction (Fig.4). However, for αB-crystallin the reverse was true; the interaction between the wild-type αB-crystallin and the αBc mutant was much greater than that between αB-crystallin and αBn mutant. For cross-interactions, αA-crystallin interacted with αBc far more than it did with αBn, and αB-crystallin interacted with αAn far more than it did with αAc. These results suggest that both the N- and C-terminal domains of αA-crystallin but only the C-terminal domain of αB-crystallin are involved in the interactions that lead to oligomerization. It is to be noted that αAc and αBc mutants include the “α-crystallin” domain, which contains most of the conserved residues (25Caspers G.J. Leunissen J.A. de Jong W.W. J. Mol. Evol. 1995; 40: 238-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) and has been reported to contain regions important in chaperone function (24Muchowski P.J. Wu G.J.S. Liang J.J.N. Adman E.T. Clark J.I. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 397-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Earlier reports of the presence of heterogeneous interactions among α-, β-, and γ-crystallins are either controversial or the evidence is indirect (5Siezen R.J. Owen E.A. Biophys. Chem. 1983; 18: 181-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 6Liang J.N. Li X.Y. Exp. Eye Res. 1991; 53: 61-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 11Mach H. Trautman P.A. Thomson J.A.

Macromol. 1998; 22: 247-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Our data from two-hybrid system assays provide direct evidence for such interactions and are further supported by the results of coimmunoprecipitation. The discrepancy may arise from many factors including in vivo versus in vitro environments, protein concentrations, and sensitivity of measurements. Among those factors, the most important difference is environment. In biochemical and spectroscopic measurements, the proteins used had undergone many steps of purification in which their conformation may have been altered from those in vivo and thus may have influenced their interactions. The factor of protein concentration may not be important, because concentrations of fusion proteins in the two-hybrid system are not higher than those of in vitro studies (5Siezen R.J. Owen E.A. Biophys. Chem. 1983; 18: 181-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 6Liang J.N. Li X.Y. Exp. Eye Res. 1991; 53: 61-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 11Mach H. Trautman P.A.

Macromol. 1998; 22: 247-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The estimated concentrations of fusion proteins are less than 0.5 mg/ml (total protein concentrations of lysates are approximately 0.5 mg/ml). Furthermore, the interactions detected in the two-hybrid system appear not to be concentration-dependent. The difference of sensitivity apparently is an important factor; the two-hybrid system assay is more sensitive than in vitromeasurements and can detect even weak and transient interactions. The present finding of detected heterogeneous interactions among crystallins of different classes (α- and β-crystallins, α- and γ-crystallins, or β- and γ-crystallins) is the first such report of in vivo assay. Because the two-hybrid system assays are highly specific, the observed heterogeneous interactions cannot be nonspecific. Compared with homogeneous αA-αA and αB-αB interactions, which are known to be attributed to intersubunit domain interactions, the heterogeneous interactions are rather weak. From earlier studies (15Boelens W.C. Croes Y. de Ruwe M. de Reu L. de Jong W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28085-28090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 23Kim K.K. Kim R. Kim S.H. Nature. 1998; 394: 595-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar, 24Muchowski P.J. Wu G.J.S. Liang J.J.N. Adman E.T. Clark J.I. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 397-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), subunit domain interaction and interactions among negatively charged amino acid residues are suggested to be responsible for oligomerization of αB-crystallin. For detailed consideration of various interactions in α-crystallin, we use the reported X-crystallographic structure of a small heat-shock protein Mj Hsp16.5 (23Kim K.K. Kim R. Kim S.H. Nature. 1998; 394: 595-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar), in which 24 subunits form a hollow spherical complex of octahedral symmetry with eight trigonal and six square windows. Each subunit has nine β-strands arranged into two anti-parallel β-sheets. In the formation of a dimer, the building block for an oligomer, one of the strands from one subunit interacts with a β-sheet of the neighboring subunit to form an intersubunit composite β-sheet. In this 2-fold structure, hydrogen bonds are the main force. In oligomerization, 3- and 4-fold symmetrical structures are formed through interactions among negatively charged amino acid residues. A structure similar to that of hsp16.5 has been constructed for αB-crystallin based on homology to Mj Hsp16.5 and site-specific mutagenesis (24Muchowski P.J. Wu G.J.S. Liang J.J.N. Adman E.T. Clark J.I. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 397-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The strong CAT activities for homogeneous systems of αA- and αB-crystallins must arise from these domain and charge interactions. In contrast, the heterogeneous interactions among αB-, β-, and γ-crystallins were weak and may be explained in terms of the facts that β- and γ-crystallins have a unique Greek motif structure (26Blundell T. Lindley P. Miller L. Moss D. Slingsby C. Tickle I. Turnell B. Wistow G. Nature. 1981; 289: 771-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 27Lapatto R. Nalini V. Bax B. Driessen H. Lindley P.F. Blundell T.L. Slingsby C. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 1067-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and are unable to form domain interactions with other crystallins. Whether the heterogeneous interactions among α-, β-, and γ-crystallins are due to charge interactions may be resolved by site-specific mutagenesis. Because highly sensitive two-hybrid system assay can detect even transient interactions, it is possible that the detected heterogeneous interactions are transient. The two-hybrid system assay alone cannot differentiate between a transient and a weak interaction, a further study with mutation in the domain region, which affects a weak but not a transient interaction, is required. The other two homogeneous systems, βB2-βB2 and γC-γC, did not show strong CAT activity. βB2-Crystallin is a dimeric protein, but its CAT activity was almost the same as that of the monomeric γC-crystallin (Fig. 2A). The most likely explanation is that βB2-crystallin, like βA3-crystallin, is in a reversible monomer-dimer equilibrium and favors the monomer state at low concentration (28Sergeev Y.V. Wingfield P.T. Hejtmancik J.F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15799-15806Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The interaction between αA- and αB-crystallin is very important physiologically. The quaternary structure of oligomer αA- or αB-crystallin is in a dynamic state; the subunits constantly undergo subunit exchange (29Bova M.P. Ding L.L. Horwitz J. Fung B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29511-29517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 30Sun T.-X. Liang J.J.N. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 1998; 430: 401-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). A study of αA-crystallin knockout mice indicates that the lens develops opacity early and that most of the αB-crystallins are in the inclusion body (32Brady J.P. Garland D. Duglas-Tabor Y. Robison Jr., W.G. Groome A. Wawrousek E.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 884-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar); αB-crystallin expressed alone is relatively unstable. Heating experiments also indicate that αB-crystallin is thermally less stable than αA-crystallin (19Sun T.-X. Das B.K. Liang J.J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6220-6225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 30Sun T.-X. Liang J.J.N. J. Biol.

Eye (London). 1999; 13: 403-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The stability of αB-crystallin is increased by the addition of αA-crystallin. A 3:1 ratio of αA-crystallin:αB-crystallin in the mixture, which coincides with the ratio in the mammalian lens, is found to be the most stable combination (30Sun T.-X. Liang J.J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 286-290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 33Horwitz J. Bova M.P. Ding L.L. Haley D.A. Stewart P.L. Eye (London). 1999; 13: 403-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Based on the above observations, a question arises on the state of αB-crystallin in the nonlenticular tissues; is it also in an insoluble state? For example, we do not know the state of αB-crystallin in the neurotoxic plaques of patients with Alzheimer's disease (34Renkawek K. Bosman G.J. de Jong W.W. Acta Neuropathol. 1994; 87: 511-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 35Renkawek K. Voorter C.E. Bosman G.J. van Workum F.P. de Jong W.W. Acta Neuropathol. 1994; 87: 155-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), in which αB-crystallin but not αA-crystallin colocalizes with amyloid peptides. The results of studies with N- and C-terminal truncated mutants indicate the importance of the C-terminal domain in oligomerization of αB-crystallin and of the N-terminal domain in the oligomerization of αA-crystallin, consistent with previous reports (15Boelens W.C. Croes Y. de Ruwe M. de Reu L. de Jong W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28085-28090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 36Bova M.P. McHaourab H.S. Han Y. Fung B.K. J.

Acta. 1992; 1130: 267-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). From our present data and those of Bova et al. (36Bova M.P. McHaourab H.S. Han Y. Fung B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1035-1042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), oligomerization potency appears to correlate with CAT activity. It is not clear what makes αAn more potent than αBn in oligomerization. Depending on the evaluation methods, there is either no β-strand or only one β-strand in the N-terminal domain in αA- and αB-crystallins (23Kim K.K. Kim R. Kim S.H. Nature. 1998; 394: 595-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar, 24Muchowski P.J. Wu G.J.S. Liang J.J.N. Adman E.T. Clark J.I. J. Mol.

Frasconi P. Soda G. Pollastri G. Bioinformatics (Oxf). 1999; 15: 937-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar), and there would not be any interacting surfaces of β-sheets. Regardless of the nature of interaction of the N-terminal domain, it is likely that oligomerization needs both N- and C-terminal domains to interact cooperatively, so that almost the same sizes of oligomers are produced for the homogeneous αA- and αB-crystallins or for the heterogeneous α-crystallin. The two-hybrid system assays have many applications including mapping the interaction surfaces using site-directed mutagenesis (15Boelens W.C. Croes Y. de Ruwe M. de Reu L. de Jong W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28085-28090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 40Takacs A.M. Das T. Banerjee A.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10375-10379Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Such mapping will be particularly useful in the structural study of αA- and αB-crystallins, of which three-dimensional structures have not been determined. Previous use of spin-labeling, site-directed mutagenesis, and chaperone activity in the detection of β-strands provides enormous information regarding αA-crystallin structure (38Koteiche H.A. Mchaourab H.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 561-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Instead of determining chaperone function, the use of the two-hybrid system to detect protein-protein interactions may provide a more precise evaluation. From the data of β-strands in the protein polypeptides (39Baldi P. Brunak S. Frasconi P. Soda G. Pollastri G. Bioinformatics (Oxf). 1999; 15: 937-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar), an amino acid in a particular β-strand may be replaced with proline, a strong β-strand breaker (41Chou P.Y. Fasman G.D. Prediction of Protein Structures and the Principles of Protein Conformation. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1989: 549-586Google Scholar). By repeating the process for each β-strand, the contribution of individual β-strands to protein-protein interaction may be assessed. The two-hybrid system assay can also be used to determine whether cataract mutant genes alter the protein-protein interactions. The information may demonstrate an important role for protein-protein interactions in lens transparency. Many cataract genes have been detected, including CRYAA (R116C) in autosomal dominant congenital zonular central nuclear cataract (42Litt M. Kramer P. LaMorticella D.M. Murphey W. Lovrien E.W.

Recently, we have also observed conformational change, destabilization, and insolubilization of the γC-crystallin T5P mutant. 2L. Fu and J. J. N. Liang, unpublished results. It will be interesting to determine whether these gene mutations also alter protein-protein interactions. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the lens crystallins interact both homogenously and heterogeneously. The interactions among αA-, βB2- and γC-crystallins, however, are far less intense than the interaction between αA- and αB-crystallins. The significance of protein-protein interactions is that structural changes such as those caused by posttranslational modification and gene mutation may alter the interactions and thus affect protein solubility and lens transparency."

https://openalex.org/W2056600266,"The sandfly Phlebotomus papatasi transmits Leishmania major, the agent of cutaneous leishmaniasis, in desert and savannah regions of the Old World1, where seasonal stress of dehydration and heat reduces the quantity of sugar in plant leaves2. Without essential sugar, only a few flies that feed on leaves can survive for long enough to deposit eggs and transmit Leishmania3,4. Accordingly, selection for hunger tolerance may also select for pathogen susceptibility in flies. Here we provide evidence of a link between these advantageous and costly5,6 properties by testing the susceptibility of flies selected by sugar deprivation and of flies from irrigated and arid habitats."
https://openalex.org/W1503855102,"T cell activation requires presentation of antigen by antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Before the antigen can be presented on the APC surface, it must be processed within the endosomes and lysosomes of APCs into short peptides, which are then assembled into complexes with MHC class II molecules. In a Perspective, [Watts][1] identifies the enzyme GILT as a necessary component for efficient processing of antigen containing disulfide bonds ([ Maric et al .][2]).
