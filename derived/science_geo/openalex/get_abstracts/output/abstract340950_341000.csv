https://openalex.org/W2010280268,"Carbonate is a substituent in the apatite structure; when present, it limits the size of the growing apatite crystals and so influences their shape that they grow more equiaxed than needle-like. The tendency for carbonate apatites to be equiaxed is related to the nature of the chemical bonds formed in the crystal. The interference of carbonate with the good crystallization of apatite, and its weakening effect on the bonds in the structure, increase the dissolution rate and the solubility, thereby presumably contributing to the susceptibility to caries of dental apatites containing carbonate."
https://openalex.org/W2019070598,"The Hugoniot of the rutile phase of titanium dioxide has been determined to 1.25 megabars, and data show the existence of a phase change at about 0.33 megabar. The volume decrease associated with this transformation appears to be quite large (approximately 21 percent). Rutile, when recovered from shockloading in excess of the transformation pressure, is found to be irreversibly transformed to the orthorhombic lead dioxide structure (a distortion of the fluorite structure) with parameters a, 4.529; b, 5.464; and c, 4.905 angstroms and a calculated density of 4.374 grams per cubic centimeter. The new phase reverts to rutile at temperatures above 450 degrees C. It is suggested that the new phase may be another diagnostic indicator of meteorite impact on the earth's surface."

When vapor fails to nucleate again on partial melting, the resulting negative pressure (hydrostatic tension) inside the inclusions permits the existence of ice I crystals under reversible, metastable equilibrium, at temperatures as high as +6.5 degrees C and negative pressures possibly exceeding 1000 bars."
https://openalex.org/W2010635440,Silicate minerals typical of those carried in the suspended load of streams release silica to silica-deficient sea water and abstract silica from silicaenriched sea water. Experimental rates of release and uptake permit the conclusion that the suspended solids carried into the oceans by streams are a major control of the concentration of silica in the ocean.

https://openalex.org/W2000637945,"Samples of both fossil and modern resins have been investigated by x-ray diffraction techniques. Most fossil resins (ambers) yield only diffuse x-ray diffraction patterns, though some (settlingite, Highgate copalite, and guayaquillite) have relatively sharp patterns. Many modern resins, including those from species of Pinus and other conifers such as Picea and Abies, and many of those from Protium and Bursera, and Styrax benzoin, give sharp and distinctive patterns. Some crystalline constituents of the resins which yield the x-ray diffraction patterns have been identified. The similarity between the Protium and Bursera patterns and those of Highgate copalite and guayaquillite may indicate a possible genetic relationship between these modern and fossil resins."
https://openalex.org/W2065031567,"Archeological excavations at San Lorenzo Tenochtitlan, Veracruz, show that the Olmec sculptures of this zone are associated with the San Lorenzo phase, which can be placed in the Early Formative period (1500-800 B.C.) on the basis of ceramic comparisons. Five of six radiocarbon dates for the San Lorenzo phase fall within the 1200-900 B.C. span. The San Lorenzo phase therefore marks the beginning of Olmec civilization, and the sites forming the San Lorenzo Tenochtitlan group represent the oldest civilized communities known in Mexico or Central America."
https://openalex.org/W2039834067,"Two recent observations appear to have provided critical information about the past history of the universe. The thermal character of the microwave background radiation suggests that the universe has expanded from a state of high temperature and density, and places constraints on such a big-bang cosmology. The observations of very weak helium lines in the spectra of certain stars in the halo of our galaxy are possibly due to a low primeval abundance of this element. However, the simplest model of a big-bang cosmology leads to much higher helium abundances, such as are observed in the solar system and in many stars. The production of helium can be reduced either by altering the early expansion rate or by introducing degenerate electron neutrinos. Observations of interstellar and intergalactic deuterium and He(4), and possibly even He(3) and Li(7), are needed to test the various models."
https://openalex.org/W2080247641,Objective-prism and objective-grating spectrograms were obtained in six star fields during the Gemini 11 mission. The grating spectra show absorption lines in the 2000 to 3000 angstrom wavelength region of Canopus and Sirius and provide ultraviolet-energy distribution data for approximately 50 stars. Many prism spectra show the Balmer discontinuity due to hydrogen and two absorption features probably due to ultraviolet iron multiplets.

When the Schrodinger cat paradox was first proposed in 1935, it was difficult to envision an experimental system in which to model Schrodinger's experiment. But C. Monroe et al. describe such a system in their research article “A ‘Schrodinger cat’ superposition state of an atom” ([24 May, p. 1131][2]). In an accompanying Research News article ([24 May, p. 1101][3]), Gary Taubes writes

> … Erwin Schrodinger described a cat shut up in what he called a “diabolical device”: a closed box also containing a small amount of a radioactive substance. Over the course of an hour, the radioactive substance has a 50-50 chance of decaying. If it does, the decay is detected by a counter, which shatters a flask of deadly acid, killing the cat. If it doesn't, the cat lives.

But for the experiment to be a true paradox, the box must contain only one radioactive atom, as specified by Schrodinger. If there are numerous atoms in the box, it is a statistical certainty that at least one atom (but we cannot know which one) will decay in the course of the experiment, and the unfortunate cat will undoubtedly be killed. If, on the other hand, there is only one or very few atoms in the box, we will not know whether the cat is dead or alive.

# {#article-title-2}

As a naive molecular biologist, I am perplexed by one facet of the problem of Schrodinger's cat as it is usually presented. Why can't the cat be considered an observer and therefore remove the uncertainty about its own life or death status?

# {#article-title-3}

My 12-year-old daughter Phoebe is a student of quantum paradoxes, but she was concerned about an error in the illustration accompanying the Research News article with regard to feline anatomy. Presumably, even Schrodinger's cat would have foreleg “elbows,” not “knees.”

# {#article-title-4}

The title of the Research News article “Schizophrenic atom doubles as Schrodinger's cat—or kitten” perpetuates a misconception about schizophrenia—which is nothing like split personality—and trivializes a potentially disabling mental disorder.

# {#article-title-5}

“Kitten,” as used by Taubes, seems needlessly macroscopic as a metaphor for a single trapped atom. How about “Schrodinger's furball”?

First appearance of trend below top of core has been calculated, and the results of these tests are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1988519766,"As an American postdoc at the end of a 27-month research (24 months) and “tourist” (3 months) visit to a Japanese government laboratory, I tire of seeing the high cost of living in Japan cited in Science as a valid reason for foreign scientists shunning Japan (Random Samples, 3 May, p. 655; Science in Japan, 18 Nov. 1994, p. 1181). Living costs should have little influence on scientists' decision-making about Japan (in contrast to those of potential exchange students) because generous salaries, free housing for most foreign researchers, employer-purchased plane tickets, and favorable tax settings more than compensate for the costs. (These circumstances explain why almost all foreign researchers I have met here are happy.)

In my case, I am returning home with a net worth of about $50,000 more than when I arrived. My 1995 taxable income, in Japan and the United States combined, was zero.

The language barrier and the lack of technicians are real considerations that prospective visitors must weigh, along with appropriate employment for a spouse and schools for children. But the price of sushi is not a concern. Worrywarts can always order the cheap omelete variety in fast-food restaurants where dishes arrive on a conveyor belt."

This machine will be completely superconducting—with elongated plasmas, lower hybrid current drive, and steady-state (about 1000-s) divertor operation. Its conceptual design was completed in 1995 and was reviewed by an international panel of experts headed by Jim Sinnis of the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory in January 1996. The preliminary conceptual design of this machine has also been presented at international forums and conferences. The engineering design of SST 1 is now under way, and the machine is likely to be commissioned by the end of 2000. SST 1 is a successor to the Indian tokamak ADITYA, which has been operating since 1989 and has made interesting contributions to the physics of edge turbulence in tokamaks.
