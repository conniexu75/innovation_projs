https://openalex.org/W3006963925,"In response to stressors, individuals adopt different behavioral styles, which are essential for survival and form the basis of differential susceptibility to stress-related disorders. Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) have predominantly been studied in behavioral response to stress, while the role of mPFC CRF neurons is poorly understood. Using morphology, electrophysiology, and calcium imaging approaches, we characterized mPFC CRF neurons as a unique subtype of GABAergic inhibitory interneurons that were directly engaged in the tail suspension challenge. Genetic ablation or chemogenetic inhibition of dorsal mPFC (dmPFC) CRF neurons increased immobility under the tail-suspension and forced-swimming challenges and induced social avoidance behavior, whereas activation had the opposite effect on the same measures. Furthermore, increasing CRF neuronal activity promoted durable resilience to repeated social defeat stress. These results uncover a critical role of mPFC CRF interneurons in bidirectionally controlling motivated behavioral style selection under stress."
https://openalex.org/W3007059419,"Many studies have been conducted to improve economically important livestock traits such as feed efficiency and muscle growth. Genome editing technologies represent a major advancement for both basic research and agronomic biotechnology development. The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 technical platform is a powerful tool used to engineer specific targeted loci. However, the potential occurrence of off-target effects, including the cleavage of unintended targets, limits the practical applications of Cas9-mediated genome editing. In this study, to minimize the off-target effects of this technology, we utilized D10A-Cas9 nickase to generate myostatin-knockout (MSTN KO) chickens via primordial germ cells. D10A-Cas9 nickase (Cas9n)-mediated MSTN KO chickens exhibited significantly larger skeletal muscles in the breast and leg. Degrees of skeletal muscle hypertrophy and hyperplasia induced by myostatin deletion differed by sex and muscle type. The abdominal fat deposition was dramatically lower in MSTN KO chickens than in wild-type chickens. Our results demonstrate that the D10A-Cas9 technical platform can facilitate precise and efficient targeted genome engineering and may broaden the range of applications for genome-edited chickens in practical industrialization and as animal models of human diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3007447439,"Agricultural soil pests, including wireworms (Coleoptera: Elateridae), are managed primarily with pesticides applied directly to seeds before sowing. Seeds coated with neonicotinoids have been used widely in Quebec (Canada) for several years. To assess the agronomic and economic value of neonicotinoid seed treatments in soybeans and corn in Quebec, trials were conducted from 2012 to 2016 in 84 fields across seven regions in Quebec. We evaluated the effect of neonicotinoid seed treatments on soil pest densities, crop damage and yield. The results showed that 92.6% of corn fields and 69.0% of soybean fields had less than 1 wireworm per bait trap. However, no significant differences in plant stand or yield were observed between treated and untreated corn or soybeans during the study. This study shows that neonicotinoid seed treatments in field crops in Quebec are useful in less than 5% of cases, given the very low level of pest-associated pressure and damage, and that they should not be used prophylactically. Integrated pest management (IPM) strategies need to be developed for soil insect pests to offer effective alternative solutions to producers."
https://openalex.org/W3009029371,"There is concern that influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) may be attenuated by passage in eggs during manufacture. We compared quadrivalent cell-culture vaccine with egg-based vaccines, most of which were trivalent, against influenza A and B during 2017–2018 when A(H3N2) and B/Yamagata (present only in quadrivalent vaccines) predominated. We retrospectively examined risk of PCR-confirmed influenza A and B in members of Kaiser Permanente Northern California aged 4–64 years. We estimated the relative VE (rVE) of cell-culture vaccine versus egg-based vaccines, and the absolute VE (aVE) of each vaccine comparing vaccinated to unvaccinated individuals. Analyses used Cox regression with a calendar timeline, stratified by birth year, and adjusted for demographics, co-morbidities and utilization. One-third (1,016,965/3,053,248) of the population was vaccinated; 932,545 (91.7% of vaccinees) received egg-based and 84,420 (8.3%) received cell-culture vaccines. The rVE against influenza A was 8.0% (95% CI: –10, 23); aVE was 31.7% (CI: 18.7, 42.6) for cell-culture and 20.1% (CI: 14.5, 25.4) for egg-based vaccines. The rVE against influenza B was 39.6% (CI: 27.9, 49.3); aVE was 40.9% (CI: 30, 50.1) for cell-culture and 9.7% (CI 3.5, 15.6) for egg-based trivalent vaccines. Inclusion of the B/Yamagata lineage in the quadrivalent cell-based vaccine provided better protection against influenza B but vaccine effectiveness against influenza A was low for both the cell-culture vaccine and the egg-based vaccines. Improving influenza vaccines requires ongoing comparative vaccine effectiveness monitoring."
https://openalex.org/W3007747349,"The proinflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-18 are products of activation of the inflammasome, an innate sensing system, and important in the pathogenesis of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1). The release of IL-18 and IL-1β from monocytes/macrophages is critical for protection from HSV-1 based on animal models of encephalitis and genital infection, yet if and how HSV-1 activates inflammasomes in human macrophages is unknown. To investigate this, we utilized both primary human monocyte derived macrophages and human monocytic cell lines (THP-1 cells) with various inflammasome components knocked-out. We found that HSV-1 activates inflammasome signaling in proinflammatory primary human macrophages, but not in resting macrophages. Additionally, HSV-1 inflammasome activation in THP-1 cells is dependent on nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat-containing receptor 3 (NLRP3), apoptosis-associated speck-like molecule containing a caspase recruitment domain (ASC), and caspase-1, but not on absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2), or gamma interferon-inducible protein 16 (IFI16). In contrast, HSV-1 activates non-canonical inflammasome signaling in proinflammatory macrophages that results in IL-1β, but not IL-18, release that is independent of NLRP3, ASC, and caspase-1. Ultraviolet irradiation of HSV-1 enhanced inflammasome activation, demonstrating that viral replication suppresses inflammasome activation. These results confirm that HSV-1 is capable of activating the inflammasome in human macrophages through an NLRP3 dependent process and that the virus has evolved an NLRP3 specific mechanism to inhibit inflammasome activation in macrophages."
https://openalex.org/W3006793062,"Background Multidrug-resistant (MDR) E. coli with extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs) is becoming endemic in health care settings around the world. Baseline data on virulence and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) of specific lineages of E. coli circulating in developing countries like India is currently lacking. Methods Whole-genome sequencing was performed for 60 MDR E. coli isolates. The analysis was performed at single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) level resolution to identify the presence of their virulence and AMR genes. Results Genome comparison revealed the presence of ST-131 global MDR and ST410 as emerging-MDR clades of E. coli in India. AMR gene profile for cephalosporin and carbapenem resistance differed between the clades. Genotypes blaCTX-M-15 and blaNDM-5 were common among cephalosporinases and carbapenemases, respectively. For aminoglycoside resistance, rmtB was positive for 31.7% of the isolates, of which 95% were co-harboring carbapenemases. In addition, the FimH types and virulence gene profile positively correlated with the SNP based phylogeny, and also revealed the evolution of MDR clones among the study population with temporal accumulation of SNPs. The predominant clone was ST167 (blaNDM lineage) followed by ST405 (global clone ST131 equivalent) and ST410 (fast spreading high risk clone). Conclusions This is the first report on the whole genome analysis of MDR E. coli lineages circulating in India. Data from this study will provide public health agencies with baseline information on AMR and virulent genes in pathogenic E. coli in the region."
https://openalex.org/W3007477427,"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have attracted increasing attention because of their potential roles in various biological processes and medical applications. However, isolation of EVs is technically challenging mainly due to their small and heterogeneous size and contaminants that are often co-isolated. We have thus designed a two-step magnetic bead-based (2MBB) method for isolation a subset of EVs as well as their microRNAs from samples of a limited amount. The process involves utilizing magnetic beads coated with capture molecules that recognize EV surface markers, such as CD63. Captured EVs could be eluted from beads or lyzed directly for subsequent analysis. In this study, we used a second set of magnetic beads coated with complementary oligonucleotides to isolate EV-associated microRNAs (EV-miRNAs). The efficiencies of 2MBB processes were assessed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with spiked-in exogenous cel-miR-238 molecules. Experimental results demonstrated the high efficiency in EV enrichment (74 ± 7%, n = 4) and miRNA extraction (91 ± 4%, n = 4). Transmission electron micrographs (TEM) and nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) show that captured EVs enriched by 2MBB method could be released and achieved a higher purity than the differential ultracentrifugation (DUC) method (p < 0.001, n = 3). As a pilot study, EV-miR126-3p and total circulating cell-free miR126-3p (cf-miR126-3p) in eight clinical plasma samples were measured and compared with the level of protein markers. Compared to cf-miR126-3p, a significant increase in correlations between EV-miR126-3p and cardiac troponin I (cTnI) and N-terminal propeptide of B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) was detected. Furthermore, EV-miR126-3p levels in plasma samples from healthy volunteers (n = 18) and high-risk cardiovascular disease (CVD) patients (n = 10) were significantly different (p = 0.006), suggesting EV-miR126 may be a potential biomarker for cardiovascular diseases. 2MBB technique is easy, versatile, and provides an efficient means for enriching EVs and EV-associated nucleic acid molecules."
https://openalex.org/W3009020735,"Control charts are popular tools in the statistical process control toolkit and the exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) chart is one of its essential component for efficient process monitoring. In the present study, a new Bayesian Modified-EWMA chart is proposed for the monitoring of the location parameter in a process. Four various loss functions and a conjugate prior distribution are used in this study. The average run length is used as a performance evaluation tool for the proposed chart and its counterparts. The results advocate that the proposed chart performs very well for the monitoring of small to moderate shifts in the process and beats the existing counterparts. The significance of the proposed scheme has proved through two real-life examples: (1) For the monitoring of the reaming process which is used in the mechanical industry. (2) For the monitoring of golf ball performance in the sports industry."
https://openalex.org/W3006963707,"Purpose “Quantile-dependent expressivity” describes an effect of the genotype that depends upon the level of the phenotype (e.g., whether a subject’s triglycerides are high or low relative to its population distribution). Prior analyses suggest that the effect of a genetic risk score (GRS) on fasting plasma triglyceride levels increases with the percentile of the triglyceride distribution. Postprandial lipemia is well suited for testing quantile-dependent expressivity because it exposes each individual’s genotype to substantial increases in their plasma triglyceride concentrations. Ninety-seven published papers were identified that plotted mean triglyceride response vs. time and genotype, which were converted into quantitative data. Separately, for each published graph, standard least-squares regression analysis was used to compare the genotype differences at time t (dependent variable) to average triglyceride concentrations at time t (independent variable) to assess whether the genetic effect size increased in association with higher triglyceride concentrations and whether the phenomenon could explain purported genetic interactions with sex, diet, disease, BMI, and drugs. Results Consistent with the phenomenon, genetic effect sizes increased (P≤0.05) with increasing triglyceride concentrations for polymorphisms associated with ABCA1, ANGPTL4, APOA1, APOA2, APOA4, APOA5, APOB, APOC3, APOE, CETP, FABP2, FATP6, GALNT2, GCKR, HL, IL1b, LEPR, LOX-1, LPL, MC4R, MTTP, NPY, SORT1, SULF2, TNFA, TCF7L2, and TM6SF2. The effect size for these polymorphisms showed a progressively increasing dose-response, with intermediate effect sizes at intermediate triglyceride concentrations. Quantile-dependent expressivity provided an alternative interpretation to their interactions with sex, drugs, disease, diet, and age, which have been traditionally ascribed to gene-environment interactions and genetic predictors of drug efficacy (i.e., personalized medicine). Conclusion Quantile-dependent expressivity applies to the majority of genetic variants affecting postprandial triglycerides, which may arise because the impaired functionalities of these variants increase at higher triglyceride concentrations. Purported gene-drug interactions may be the manifestations of quantile-dependent expressivity, rather than genetic predictors of drug efficacy."
https://openalex.org/W3007668050,"There has been a heightened emphasis on prioritizing data to inform evidence-based HIV responses, including data focused on both defining the content and scale of HIV programs in response to evidence-based need. Consequently, population size estimation (PSE) studies for key populations have become increasingly common to define the necessary scale of specific programs for key populations. This study aims to assess the research utilization of these size estimates in informing HIV policy and program documents across the African continent.This study included two phases; Phase 1 was a review of all PSE for key populations, including men who have sex with men (MSM), female sex workers (FSW), people who use drugs (PWUD), and transgender persons in the 54 countries across Africa published from January 2009-December 2017. Phase 2 was a review of 23 different types of documents released between January 2009 -January 2019, with a focus on the US President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) and The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria investments, for evidence of stakeholder engagement in PSE studies, as well as key population PSE research utilization to inform HIV programming and international HIV investments.Of 118 size estimates identified in 39 studies, less than 15% were utilized in PEPFAR Country Operational Plans or national strategic health plan documents, and less than 2% in Global Fund Concept Notes. Of 39 PSE studies, over 50% engaged stakeholders in study implementation and identified target population stakeholders, a third of studies identified policy or program stakeholders, and 15% involved stakeholders in study design.The past decade has seen an increase in PSE studies conducted for key populations in more generalized HIV epidemic settings which involve significant investments of finances and human resources. However, there remains limited evidence of sustained uptake of these data to guide the HIV responses. Increasing uptake necessitates effective stakeholder engagement and data-oriented capacity building to optimize research utilization and facilitate data-driven and human rights-affirming HIV responses."
https://openalex.org/W3007895729,"Background The emergence of a large population of orphaned youth in sub-Saharan Africa is due to the natural maturity of orphaned children. Research indicates that orphaned youth face more negative psychosocial challenges than their younger counterparts do. Furthermore, these challenges are intensified for early school leavers. This paper describes how experiencing maternal death affects the psychosocial wellbeing of orphaned youth who left school before completing high school. Methods An exploratory qualitative study was undertaken among purposively sampled orphaned youth using in-depth interviews with open-ended questions. Fifty participants were recruited through social workers, community based organisations, and tribal authorities in a rural local municipality of Mpumalanga Province, South Africa. All data analyses were performed using NVivo10, following an inductive thematic approach. Results The narratives with the participants revealed that they live in a socially depressed environment and are subjected to extreme poverty characterised by frequent hunger. Furthermore, they do not enjoy family support and when they live with their extended families, they experience ill treatment and unsympathetic gestures. The death of their mothers has made a negative psychological impact on their psychosocial wellbeing, resulting in the development of internalising depressive symptoms. They suffer from emotional distress and prolonged bereavement characterised by perpetual yearning for the mother and, they resort to silence as a coping strategy. The study established that they were forced to leave school early for a variety of reasons. However, leaving school early became a major stressor and contributed to their negative psychosocial wellbeing. Conclusion Maternal death has a negative impact on the psychosocial wellbeing of the participants even after they have crossed the 18 years threshold of orphan hood. Yearning for their mothers negatively affected their ability to develop coping strategies, which led to isolation, sadness, hopelessness, lack of peace, and fear of an uncertain future. The lack of routine screening for mental health in schools and other settings in South Africa increases their vulnerability to undiagnosed depression. The school health services should develop interventions for mental health screening in schools. For early school leavers, relevant policies should consider the continuation of support through NGOs and community networks."
https://openalex.org/W3008747227,"Introduction At low mutation-detection thresholds, next generation sequencing (NGS) for HIV-1 genotypic resistance testing is susceptible to artifactual detection of mutations arising from PCR error and APOBEC-mediated G-to-A hypermutation. Methods We analyzed published HIV-1 pol Illumina NGS data to characterize the distribution of mutations at eight NGS mutation detection thresholds: 20%, 10%, 5%, 2%, 1%, 0.5%, 0.2%, and 0.1%. At each threshold, we determined proportions of amino acid mutations that were unusual (defined as having a prevalence <0.01% in HIV-1 group M sequences) or signature APOBEC mutations. Results Eight studies, containing 855 samples, in the NCBI Sequence Read Archive were analyzed. As detection thresholds were lowered, there was a progressive increase in the proportion of positions with usual and unusual mutations and in the proportion of all mutations that were unusual. The median proportion of positions with an unusual mutation increased gradually from 0% at the 20% threshold to 0.3% at the 1% threshold and then exponentially to 1.3% (0.5% threshold), 6.9% (0.2% threshold), and 23.2% (0.1% threshold). In two of three studies with available plasma HIV-1 RNA levels, the proportion of positions with unusual mutations was negatively associated with virus levels. Although the complete set of signature APOBEC mutations was much smaller than that of unusual mutations, the former outnumbered the latter in one-sixth of samples at the 0.5%, 1%, and 2% thresholds. Conclusions The marked increase in the proportion of positions with unusual mutations at thresholds below 1% and in samples with lower virus loads suggests that, at low thresholds, many unusual mutations are artifactual, reflecting PCR error or G-to-A hypermutation. Profiling the numbers of unusual and signature APOBEC pol mutations at different NGS mutation detection thresholds may be useful to avoid selecting a threshold that is too low and poses an unacceptable risk of identifying artifactual mutations."
https://openalex.org/W3008526870,"Background and objective Surgical complications after kidney transplantation can lead to catastrophic outcomes. Frailty has been associated with important kidney transplantation outcomes; however, there are no studies assessing this measure of physiological reserve as a specific predictor of surgical complications in this population. Such an assessment was, therefore, the objective of the present study. Methods A total of 87 individuals aged ≥ 18 years who underwent kidney transplantation between March 2017 and March 2018 were included. At the time of admission for kidney transplantation, demographic, clinical, and kidney transplantation data were collected, and the frailty score was calculated according to Fried et al., which comprises five components: shrinking, weakness, exhaustion, low activity, and slowed walking speed. Urological, vascular, and general surgical complications were assessed three months later, or until graft loss or death. The propensity score was used to achieve a better homogeneity of the sample, and new analyses were performed in this new, balanced sample. Results Of the 87 individuals included, 30 (34.5%) had surgical complications. After propensity score matching, the risk of surgical complications was significantly higher among the frail individuals (RR 2.14; 95% CI 1.01–4.54; p = 0.035); specifically, the risk of noninfectious surgical complications was significantly higher among these individuals (RR 2.50; 95% CI 1.11–5.62; p = 0.017). Conclusion The results showed that individuals with some degree of frailty before kidney transplantation were more subject to surgical complications. The calculation of the frailty score for transplant candidates and the implementations of measures to increase the physiological reserve of these patients at the time of kidney transplantation may possibly reduce the occurrence of surgical complications."
https://openalex.org/W3007577139,"The type VI secretion system (T6SS) is a contractile injection apparatus that translocates a spike loaded with various effectors directly into eukaryotic or prokaryotic target cells. Pseudomonas aeruginosa can load either one of its three T6SSs with a variety of toxic bullets using different but specific modes. The T6SS spike, which punctures the bacterial cell envelope allowing effector transport, consists of a torch-like VgrG trimer on which sits a PAAR protein sharpening the VgrG tip. VgrG itself sits on the Hcp tube and all elements, packed into a T6SS sheath, are propelled out of the cell and into target cells. On occasion, effectors are covalent extensions of VgrG, PAAR or Hcp proteins, which are then coined ""evolved"" components as opposed to canonical. Here, we show how various passenger domains could be fused to the C terminus of a canonical VgrG, VgrG1a from P. aeruginosa, and be sent into the bacterial culture supernatant. There is no restriction on the passenger type, although the efficacy may vary greatly, since we used either an unrelated T6SS protein, β-lactamase, a covalent extension of an ""evolved"" VgrG, VgrG2b, or a Hcp-dependent T6SS toxin, Tse2. Our data further highlights an exceptional modularity/flexibility for loading the T6SS nano-weapon. Refining the parameters to optimize delivery of passenger proteins of interest would have attractive medical and industrial applications. This may for example involve engineering the T6SS as a delivery system to shuttle toxins into either bacterial pathogens or tumour cells which would be an original approach in the fight against antimicrobial resistant bacteria or cancer."
https://openalex.org/W3008846579,"A contradictory role of CD36 in insulin resistance was found to be related to the nutrient state. Here, we examined that the physiological functions of CD36 in insulin signal transduction in mice fed a low-fat diet. CD36 deficiency led to hepatic insulin resistance and decreased insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor β (IRβ) in mice fed a low-fat diet. The ability of insulin to bind with IR did not differ between WT and CD36-deficient hepatocytes. CD36 formed a complex with IRβ and dissociation of CD36/Fyn complex or inhibition of Fyn only partially reversed the effects of CD36 on hepatic insulin signaling. Furthermore, we found that CD36 deficiency led to abnormally increased hepatic protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) expression and enhanced PTP1B and IR interactions, which contributed to the decreased insulin signaling and disordered glucose metabolism. In addition, increased endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress was found in the livers of the CD36-deficient mice, while inhibited ER stress normalized the PTP1B expression and restored insulin signaling in the CD36-deficient mice. Our findings suggest that the loss of CD36 impairs hepatic insulin signaling by enhancing the PTP1B/IR interaction that is induced by ER stress, indicating a possible critical step in the progression of hepatic insulin resistance."
https://openalex.org/W3007749934,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) inhibit protein function by silencing the translation of target mRNAs. However, in primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL), the expression and functions of miRNAs are inadequately known. Here, we examined the expression of 847 miRNAs in 40 PCNSL patients with a microarray and investigated for the miRNA predictors associated with cancer immunity-related genes such as T helper cell type 1/2 (Th-1/Th-2) and regulatory T cell (T-reg) status, and stimulatory and inhibitory checkpoint genes, for prognosis prediction in PCNSL. The aim of this study is to find promising prognosis markers based on the miRNA expression in PCNSL. We detected 334 miRNAs related to 66 cancer immunity-related genes in the microarray profiling. Variable importance measured by the random survival forest analysis and Cox proportional hazards regression model elucidated that 11 miRNAs successfully constitute the survival formulae dividing the Kaplan-Meier curve of the respective PCNSL subgroups. On the other hand, univariate analysis shortlisted 23 miRNAs for overall survival times, with four miRNAs clearly dividing the survival curves-miR-101/548b/554/1202. These miRNAs regulated Th-1/Th-2 status, T-reg cell status, and immune checkpoints. The miRNAs were also associated with gene ontology terms as Ras/MAP-kinase, ubiquitin ligase, PRC2 and acetylation, CDK, and phosphorylation, and several diseases including acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, glioma, and those related to blood and hippocampus with statistical significance. In conclusion, the results demonstrated that the four miRNAs comprising miR-101/548b/554/1202 associated with cancer immunity can be a useful prognostic marker in PCNSL and would help us understand target pathways for PCNSL treatments."
https://openalex.org/W3008820509,"Temozolomide (TMZ) is a drug of choice in glioblastoma treatment. Its therapeutic applications expand also beyond high grade gliomas. However, a significant number of recurrences and resistance to the drug is observed. The key factor in each chemotherapy is to achieve the therapeutic doses of a drug at the pathologic site. Nonetheless, the rate of temozolomide penetration from blood to cerebrospinal fluid is only 20–30%, and even smaller into brain intestinum. That makes a challenge for the therapeutic regimens to obtain effective drug concentrations with minimal toxicity and minor side effects. The aim of our research was to explore a novel epigenetic mechanism of temozolomide action in therapeutic conditions. We analyzed the epigenetic effects of TMZ influence on different glioblastoma cell lines in therapeutically achieved TMZ concentrations through total changes of the level of 5-methylcytosine in DNA, the main epigenetic marker. That was done with classical approach of radioactive nucleotide post-labelling and separation on thin-layer chromatography. In the range of therapeutically achieved temozolomide concentrations we observed total DNA hypomethylation. The significant hypermethylating effect was visible after reaching TMZ concentrations of 10–50 μM (depending on the cell line). Longer exposure time promoted DNA hypomethylation. The demethylated state of the glioblastoma cell lines was overcome by repeated TMZ applications, where dose-dependent increase in DNA 5-methylcytosine contents was observed. Those effects were not seen in non-cancerous cell line. The increase of DNA methylation resulting in global gene silencing and consecutive down regulation of gene expression after TMZ treatment may explain better glioblastoma patients’ survival."
https://openalex.org/W3007444627,"Objective To determine whether the presence of co-existing sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is associated with worse perinatal outcomes among women diagnosed with a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy (HDP), compared with normotensive controls. Study design Women diagnosed with HDP (gestational hypertension or preeclampsia) and BMI- and gestation-matched controls underwent polysomnography in late pregnancy to determine if they had coexisting SDB. Fetal heart rate (FHR) monitoring accompanied the sleep study, and third trimester fetal growth velocity was assessed using ultrasound. Cord blood was taken at delivery to measure key regulators of fetal growth. Results SDB was diagnosed in 52.5% of the HDP group (n = 40) and 38.1% of the control group (n = 42); p = .19. FHR decelerations were commonly observed during sleep, but the presence of SDB did not increase this risk in either the HDP or control group (HDP group—SDB = 35.3% vs. No SDB = 40.0%, p = 1.0; control group—SDB = 41.7% vs. No SDB = 25.0%, p = .44), nor did SDB affect the total number of decelerations overnight (HDP group—SDB = 2.7 ± 1.0 vs. No SDB = 2.8 ± 2.1, p = .94; control group—SDB = 2.0 ± 0.8 vs. No SDB = 2.0 ± 0.7, p = 1.0). Fetal growth restriction was the strongest predictor of fetal heart rate events during sleep (aOR 5.31 (95% CI 1.26–22.26), p = .02). The presence of SDB also did not adversely affect fetal growth; in fact among women with HDP, SDB was associated with significantly larger customised birthweight centiles (43.2% ± 38.3 vs. 16.2% ± 27.0, p = .015) and fewer growth restricted babies at birth (30% vs. 68.4%, p = .026) compared to HDP women without SDB. There was no impact of SDB on measures of fetal growth for the control group. Cord blood measures of fetal growth did not show any adverse effect among women with SDB, either in the HDP or control group. Conclusion We did not find that the presence of mild SDB worsened fetal acute or longitudinal outcomes, either among women with HDP or BMI-matched normotensive controls. Unexpectedly, we found the presence of SDB conferred a better prognosis in HDP in terms of fetal growth. The fetus has considerable adaptive capacity to withstand in utero hypoxia, which may explain our mostly negative findings. In addition, SDB in this cohort was mostly mild. It may be that fetal sequelae will only be unmasked in the setting of more severe degrees of SDB and/or underlying placental disease."
https://openalex.org/W3007538248,"Vertebrate fossils embedded in amber represent a particularly valuable paleobiological record as amber is supposed to be a barrier to the environment, precluding significant alteration of the animals’ body over geological time. The mode and processes of amber preservation are still under debate, and it is questionable to what extent original material may be preserved. Due to their high value, vertebrates in amber have never been examined with analytical methods, which means that the composition of bone tissue in amber is unknown. Here, we report our results of a study on a left forelimb from a fossil Anolis sp. indet. (Squamata) that was fully embedded in Miocene Dominican amber. Our results show a transformation of the bioapatite to fluorapatite associated with a severe alteration of the collagen phase and the formation of an unidentified carbonate. These findings argue for a poor survival potential of macromolecules in Dominican amber fossils."
https://openalex.org/W3007984265,"There is increased consumer interest in grass-finished beef (GFB) with retail sales reaching $272 million in 2016. GFB contains higher omega-3 fatty acid levels compared to grain-finished beef, but variations in fatty acid (FA), mineral, and antioxidant content by producers and season is poorly documented. Hence, GFB samples from cattle finished in both fall and spring were obtained from four producers representing several US sub-regions. FAs were extracted using microwave-assisted extraction, derivatized to methyl-esters, and quantified using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Mineral content was quantified using coupled plasma mass-spectrometry and antioxidants were quantified via UV-absorption. Overall, total omega-3 FA content was greater in beef from cattle finished in the spring (13.4 mg/100g beef) than the fall (10.3; P<0.001). Additionally, α-tocopherol was present in greater amounts in spring-finished beef (259 vs. 223 ug/100g beef, P<0.001) as was the micromineral selenium (18.2 vs. 17.3ug/100g beef, P = 0.008). Despite using the same feed in fall and spring, cattle from producer 4 had higher total omega-3, omega-6, and total polyunsaturated fatty acids in spring compared to fall (P<0.010). These results suggest there are seasonal differences in omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, minerals and antioxidants in grass-finished beef independent of finishing diet."
https://openalex.org/W3008209413,"On the latest 60 years the degradation and fragmentation of native habitats have been modifying the landscape in the eastern Brazilian Amazon. The adaptive plasticity of an organism has been crucial for its long-term survival and success in these novel ecosystems. In this study, we investigated the response of four endangered species of large terrestrial mammals to the variations in the quality of their original habitats, in a context of high anthropogenic pressure. The distribution of the Myrmecophaga tridactyla (Giant anteater), Priodontes maximus (Giant armadillo), Tapirus terrestris (Lowland tapir) and Tayassu pecari (White-lipped peccary) in all sampled habitats suggests their tolerance to degradation. However, the survival ability of each species in the different habitats was not the same. Among the four species, T. pecari seems to be the one with the least ability to survive in more altered environments. The positive influence of the anthropogenically altered habitats on abundances of three of the four species studied, as observed at the regeneration areas, can be considered as a potential indication of the ecological trap phenomenon. This study reinforces the importance of the forest remnants for the survival of endangered mammal species, in regions of high anthropogenic pressure, as in the eastern Brazilian Amazon."
https://openalex.org/W2911492020,"This study is the first to investigate whether the introduction of additional assistant referees in the UEFA Europa League (2009-2010 season) and the UEFA Champions League (2010-2011 season) was associated with lower referee bias in terms of home and ""big"" team favouritism. To this end, we analyse a unique database with pre- and within-game characteristics of all games in seven recent seasons in these leagues by means of bivariate probit regression models. We find evidence for substantial referee bias before the introduction of additional referees, while no such evidence is found after the introduction. Furthermore, additional assistants go hand in hand with more yellow cards for both home and away teams. We show that these findings are robust to multiple operationalisations of referee bias and that they are not just picking up a general time evolution towards less referee bias or the effect of parallel reforms."
https://openalex.org/W3006681986,"Clinical interpretation of arterial spin labeling (ASL) perfusion MRI in cerebrovascular disease remains challenging mainly because of the method’s sensitivity to concomitant contributions from both intravascular and tissue compartments. While acquisition of multi-delay images can differentiate between the two contributions, the prolonged acquisition is prone to artifacts and not practical for clinical applications. Here, the utility of the spatial coefficient of variation (sCoV) of a single-delay ASL image as a marker of the intravascular contribution was evaluated by testing the hypothesis that sCoV can detect the effects of differences in label arrival times between ipsi- and contra-lateral hemispheres even in the absence of a hemispheric difference in CBF. Hemispheric lateralization values for sCoV and CBF were computed from ASL images acquired on 28 patients (age 73.9 ± 10.2 years, 8 women) with asymptomatic unilateral carotid occlusion. The results showed that sCoV lateralization predicted the occluded side with 96.4% sensitivity, missing only 1 patient. In contrast, the sensitivity of the CBF lateralization was 71.4%, with 8 patients showing no difference in CBF between hemispheres. The findings demonstrate the potential clinical utility of sCoV as a cerebrovascular correlate of large vessel disease. Using sCoV in tandem with CBF, vascular information can be obtained in image processing without the need for additional scan-time."
https://openalex.org/W3007987746,"Background Cholera remains a public health problem in Kenya despite increased efforts to create awareness. Assessment of knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) in the community is essential for the planning and implementation of preventive measures. We assessed cholera KAP in a community in Isiolo County, Kenya. Methods This cross-sectional study involved a mixed-methods approach utilizing a questionnaire survey and focus group discussions (FGDs). Using multistage sampling with household as the secondary sampling unit, interviewers administered structured questionnaires to one respondent aged ≥18 years old per household. We created knowledge score by allotting one point for each correct response, considered any total score ≥ median score as high knowledge score, calculated descriptive statistics and used multivariate logistic regression to examine factors associated with high knowledge score. In FGDs, we randomly selected the participants aged ≥18 years and had lived in Isiolo for >1 year, conducted the FGDs using an interview guide and used content analysis to identify salient emerging themes. Results We interviewed 428 participants (median age = 30 years; Q1 = 25, Q3 = 38) comprising 372 (86.9%) females. Of the 425/428 (99.3%) who had heard about cholera, 311/425 (73.2%) knew that it is communicable. Although 273/428 (63.8%) respondents knew the importance of treating drinking water, only 216/421 (51.3%) treated drinking water. Those with good defecation practice were 209/428 (48.8%). Respondents with high knowledge score were 227/428 (53.0%). Positive attitude (aOR = 2.88, 95% C.I = 1.34–6.20), treating drinking water (aOR = 2.21, 95% C.I = 1.47–3.33), age <36 years (aOR = 1.75, 95% C.I = 1.11–2.74) and formal education (aOR = 1.71, 95% C.I = 1.08–2.68) were independently associated with high knowledge score. FGDs showed poor latrine coverage, inadequate water treatment and socio-cultural beliefs as barriers to cholera prevention and control. Conclusions There was a high knowledge score on cholera with gaps in preventive practices. We recommend targeted health education to the old and uneducated persons and general strengthening of health education in the community."
https://openalex.org/W3008242309,"Objective Based on the theoretical basis of Gabor wavelet transformation, the application effects of feature extraction algorithm in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and the role of feature extraction algorithm in the diagnosis of lumbar vertebra degenerative diseases were explored. Method The structure of lumbar vertebra and degenerative changes were respectively introduced to clarify the onset mechanism and pathological changes of lumbar vertebra degenerative changes. Most importantly, the theoretical basis of Gabor wavelet transformation and the extraction effect of feature information in lumbar vertebra MRI images were introduced. The differentiation effects of feature information extraction algorithm on annulus fibrosus and nucleus pulposus were analyzed. In this study, the data of lumbar spine MRI was randomly selected from the Wenzhou Lumbar Spine Research Database as research objects. A total of 130 discs were successfully fitted, and 109 images were graded by a doctor after observation, which was compared with the results of the artificial diagnosis. Through the comparison with the results of observation and diagnosis by professional doctors, the accuracy of feature extraction algorithm based on Gabor wavelet transformation in the diagnosis of lumbar vertebra degenerative changes was analyzed. Results 1. Compared with the results of the manual diagnosis, the accuracy of the classification method was 88.3%. In addition, the specificity (SPE), accuracy (ACC), and sensitivity (SEN) of the classification method were respectively 89.5%, 92.4%, and 87.6%. 2. The mutual information method and the KLT algorithm were utilized for vertebral body tracking. The maximum mutual information method was more effective in the case of fewer image sequences; however, with the increase of image frames, the accumulation of errors would make the tracking effects of images get worse. Based on the KLT algorithm, the enhanced vertebral boundary information was selected; the soft tissues showed in the obtained images were smooth, the boundary information of vertebral body was enhanced, and the results were more accurate. Conclusion The feature extraction algorithm based on Gabor wavelet transformation could easily and quickly realize the localization of the lumbar intervertebral disc, and the accuracy of the results was ensured. In addition, from the aspect of vertebral body tracking, the tracking effects based on the KLT algorithm were better and faster than those based on the maximum mutual information method."
https://openalex.org/W3008262770,"Patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) have access to fewer health care resources and therapies compared to other diseases, which contributes to increased morbidity and health care utilization. We compared health care utilization (inpatient hospital days, emergency care visits) and health care-related costs between SCD adults that underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) using a nonmyeloblative conditioning regimen versus those referred for HSCT but did not proceed due to lack of an HLA-matched sibling donor, denial by insurance, red blood cell antibodies to the potential donor, or declining further evaluation. Between 8/2011 and 4/2016, 83 SCD patients were referred for allogeneic HSCT and 16 underwent the procedure. The HSCT and non-HSCT groups were similar by age, sex, prior SCD-related therapy and complications. Compared to pre HSCT, significantly fewer inpatient hospital days (median of 1 versus 22 days, P = 0.003) and emergency care visits (median of 1 versus 4 visits, P = 0.04) were observed by the 2nd year post-HSCT. Similar results were observed in comparison to the standard-of-care group (median of 1 versus 12 hospital days, P = 0.002; median of 1 versus 3 emergency visits, P = 0.03). Lower health care costs were observed by the 2nd year post-HSCT (median of $16,281 versus $64,634 pre-HSCT (P = 0.01) and versus $54,082 in the standard-of-care group (P = 0.05). A median reduction of -$20,833/patient/year (IQR, -$67,078-+$4,442/patient/year) in health care costs compared to pre-HSCT was observed in the 2nd year post-HSCT. In conclusion, allogeneic HSCT leads to improvements in health care utilization and costs compared to standard-of-care therapy in high-risk SCD adults."
https://openalex.org/W3008189204,"Ionizing radiation induces amongst other the most critical type of DNA damage: double-strand breaks (DSBs). Efficient repair of such damage is crucial for cell survival and genomic stability. The analysis of DSB associated foci assays is often performed manually or with automatic systems. Manual evaluation is time consuming and subjective, while most automatic approaches are prone to changes in experimental conditions or to image artefacts. Here, we examined multiple machine learning models, namely a multi-layer perceptron classifier (MLP), linear support vector machine classifier (SVM), complement naive bayes classifier (cNB) and random forest classifier (RF), to correctly classify γH2AX foci in manually labeled images containing multiple types of artefacts. All models yielded reasonable agreements to the manual rating on the training images (Matthews correlation coefficient >0.4). Afterwards, the best performing models were applied on images obtained under different experimental conditions. Thereby, the MLP model produced the best results with an F1 Score >0.9. As a consequence, we have demonstrated that the used approach is sufficient to mimic manual counting and is robust against image artefacts and changes in experimental conditions."
https://openalex.org/W3007403147,"We hypothesize that by simulating the natural priming in seeds of a species that forms transient seed banks it is possible to clarify molecular aspects of germination that lead to the recruitment of seedlings when the next rainy season begins. We used seeds of Solanum lycocarpum as a biological model. Our findings support the idea that the increment of seed germination kinetics when the rainy season returns is mainly based on the metabolism and embryonic growth, and that the hydropriming, at the end of seed dispersion, increases the germination window time of these seeds by mainly increasing the degradation of galactomannan of the cell wall. This can improve the energy supply (based on carbon metabolism) for seedling growth in post-germination, which improves the seedling’s survival chances. From these findings, we promote a hypothetical model about how the priming at the end of the rainy season acts on mRNA synthesis in the germination of seeds from transient banks and the consequence of this priming at the beginning of the following rainy season. This model predicts that besides the Gibberellin and Abscisic Acid balance (content and sensitivity), Auxin would be a key component for the seed-seedling transition in Neotropical areas. Seed collection was performed under authorization number SISGEN AB0EB45."
https://openalex.org/W3007801384,"Since dogs play a central role in the contamination of humans and livestock with Echinococcus granulosus, the development of an effective vaccine for dogs is essential to control the disease caused by this parasite. For this purpose, a formulation based on biodegradable polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) as delivery system of recombinant Echinococcus granulosus antigen (tropomyosin EgTrp) adjuved with monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA) has been developed. The obtained nanoparticles had a size of approximately 200 nm in diameter into which the antigen was correctly preserved and encapsulated. The efficiency of this system to deliver the antigen was evaluated in vitro on canine monocyte-derived dendritic cells (cMoDCs) generated from peripheral blood monocytes. After 48 h of contact between the formulations and cMoDCs, we observed no toxic effect on the cells but a strong internalization of the NPs, probably through different pathways depending on the presence or not of MPLA. An evaluation of cMoDCs activation by flow cytometry showed a stronger expression of CD80, CD86, CD40 and MHCII by cells treated with any of the tested formulations or with LPS (positive control) in comparison to cells treated with PBS (negative control). A higher activation was observed for cells challenged with EgTrp-NPs-MPLA compared to EgTrp alone. Formulations with MPLA, even at low ratio of MPLA, give better results than formulations without MPLA, proving the importance of the adjuvant in the nanoparticles structure. Moreover, autologous T CD4+ cell proliferation observed in presence of cMoDCs challenged with EgTrp-NPs-MPLA was higher than those observed after challenged with EgTrp alone (p<0.05). These first results suggest that our formulation could be used as an antigen delivery system to targeting canine dendritic cells in the course of Echinococcus granulosus vaccine development."
https://openalex.org/W3006743433,"Background Previous studies have demonstrated that opioids are often prescribed and associated with complications in outpatients with cirrhosis. Less is known about opioids among hospitalized patients with cirrhosis. We aimed to describe the patterns and complications of opioid use among inpatients with cirrhosis. Methods This retrospective cohort study included adult patients with cirrhosis admitted to a single hospital system from 4/4/2014 to 9/30/2015. We excluded hospitalizations with a surgery, invasive procedure, or palliative care/hospice consult in order to understand opioid use that may be avoidable. We determined the frequency, dosage, and type of opioids given during hospitalization. Using bivariable and multivariable analyses, we assessed length of stay, intensive care unit transfer, and in-hospital mortality by opioid use. Results Of 217 inpatients with cirrhosis, 118 (54.4%) received opioids during hospitalization, including 41.7% of patients without prior outpatient opioid prescriptions. Benzodiazepines or hypnotic sleep aids were given to 28.8% of opioid recipients. In the multivariable model, younger age and outpatient opioid prescription were associated with inpatient opioids. Hospitalization was longer among opioid recipients (median 3.9 vs 3.0 days, p = 0.002) and this difference remained after adjusting for age, cirrhosis severity, and medical comorbidities. There was no difference in intensive care unit transfers and no deaths occurred. At discharge, 22 patients were newly started on opioids of whom 10 (45.5%) had opioid prescriptions at 90 days post-discharge. Conclusion In non-surgical inpatients with cirrhosis, opioid prescribing was common and associated with prolonged length of stay. A high proportion of patients newly discharged with opioid prescriptions had ongoing prescriptions at 90 days post-discharge."
https://openalex.org/W3006838790,"In the last decade, a cross-national community of like-minded young men has emerged, commonly known as ‘the seduction community’. This community is led by professional ‘pick-up artists’ who teach these young men a variety of techniques and mindsets with the stated aim of improving their success with women, or ‘game’. There has been little research on the men who participate in this community, and none from a mental health angle. As such, this study is propelled by two specific objectives, namely documenting and understanding (i) the reasons why young men join the seduction community; and (ii) the impacts of community involvement on participants’ lives. To meet these aims, we used an inductive qualitative methodology giving ample scope for bottom-up understandings to emerge. Specifically, we recruited young men participating in the seduction community for an in-depth qualitative interview (N = 34) to explore self-reported motives and impacts. Interviews were augmented by lengthy participant observation, and data was analyzed by content analysis techniques. The results reveal that men often join the community to address a range of psychosocial deficits, and that community involvement successfully equips participants with numerous valued social and communication skills. The community appears to fill a void in providing a place of hope, fellowship and learning for young (often immigrant) men. The findings are summarized in five themes (i) loneliness and social inclusion; (ii) lack of male role models and need for guidance; (iii) mental health and well-being issues; (iv) skill acquisition and personal development; and (v) the dark side of pick-up. Interestingly, some of the practices commonly taught and utilized within the community resemble aspects of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and mental health peer support. This may explain its evident appeal. We conclude by reflecting on the implications of the findings for official mental health service provision for young men."
https://openalex.org/W3007366222,"As in vertebrates, dopaminergic neural systems are key regulators of motor programs in insects, including the fly Drosophila melanogaster. Dopaminergic systems innervate the Mushroom Bodies (MB), an important association area in the insect brain primarily associated to olfactory learning and memory, but that has been also implicated with the execution of motor programs. The main objectives of this work is to assess the idea that dopaminergic systems contribute to the execution of motor programs in Drosophila larvae, and then, to evaluate the contribution of specific dopaminergic receptors expressed in MB to these programs. Our results show that animals bearing a mutation in the dopamine transporter show reduced locomotion, while mutants for the dopaminergic biosynthetic enzymes or the dopamine receptor Dop1R1 exhibit increased locomotion. Pan-neuronal expression of an RNAi for the Dop1R1 confirmed these results. Further studies show that animals expressing the RNAi for Dop1R1 in the entire MB neuronal population or only in the MB γ-lobe forming neurons, exhibit an increased motor output, as well. Interestingly, our results also suggest that other dopaminergic receptors do not contribute to larval motor behavior. Thus, our data support the proposition that CNS dopamine systems innervating MB neurons modulate larval locomotion and that Dop1R1 mediates this effect."
https://openalex.org/W3007713756,"The cultivation of genetically modified organisms (GMO) continues to expand worldwide. Still, many consumers express concerns about the use of GMO in food or feed, and many countries have legislated on labelling systems to indicate the presence of GMO in commercial products. To deal with the increased number of GMO events and to address related regulations, alternative detection methods for GMO inspection are required. In this work, a genosensor based on Surface Plasmon Resonance under continuous flow was developed for the detection and quantification of a genetically modified soybean (event GTS 40-3-2). In a single chip, the simultaneous detection of the event-specific and the taxon-specific samples were achieved, whose detection limits were 20 pM and 16 pM, respectively. The reproducibility was 1.4%, which supports the use of the chip as a reliable and cost-effective alternative to other DNA-based techniques. The results indicate that the proposed method is a versatile tool for GMO quantification in food and feed samples."
https://openalex.org/W3008787032,"Mast cells have secretory granules containing chemical mediators such as histamine and play important roles in the immune system. Polyamines are essential factors for cellular processes such as gene expression and translation. It has been reported that secretory granules contain both histamine and polyamines, which have similar chemical structures and are produced from the metabolism of cationic amino acids. We investigated the effect of polyamine depletion on mast cells using bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs). Polyamine depletion was induced using α-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), an irreversible inhibitor of ornithine decarboxylase. DFMO treatment resulted in a significant reduction of cell number and abnormal secretory granules in BMMCs. Moreover, the cells showed a 2.3-fold increase in intracellular histamine and up-regulation of histidine decarboxylase (HDC) at the transcriptional level during BMMC differentiation. Levels of the transcription factor kruppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) greatly decreased upon DFMO treatment; however, Klf4 mRNA was expressed at levels similar to controls. We determined the translational regulation of KLF4 using reporter genes encoding Klf4-luc2 fusion mRNA, for transfecting NIH3T3 cells, and performed in vitro translation. We found that the efficiency of KLF4 synthesis in response to DFMO treatment was enhanced by the existence of a GC-rich 5′-untranslated region (5′-UTR) on Klf4 mRNA, regardless of the recognition of the initiation codon. Taken together, these results indicate that the enhancement of histamine synthesis by DFMO depends on the up-regulation of Hdc expression, achieved by removal of transcriptional suppression of KLF4, during differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W3007237359,"Currently, the role of adjuvant irradiation in head and neck cancer (HNC) patients with N1-lymph node status is not clarified.To assess the population-based effect of recent developments in radiotherapy such as intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) in relation to overall survival (OS) together with surgery in N1 HNC patients.We used 9,318 HNC cases with pT1/2 N0/1 disease from German cancer registries. Time of diagnosis ranged from January 2000 to December 2014, which we divided into three periods: (low [LIA] vs intermediate [IA] vs high [HIA] IMRT availability period) based on usage of IMRT in Germany. For each period, we examined a possible association between treatment (surgery vs. surgery and radiotherapy) in terms of OS. Statistical analyses included Kaplan-Meier and multivariate Cox regression (models adjusted for HPV-related cancer site).Temporal analysis revealed increasing usage of IMRT in Germany. In patients with N1 tumours, a comparison of patients treated with and without radiotherapy during the HIA period showed a superiority of the combined treatment as opposed to surgery alone (HR 0.54, 95%CI: 0.35-0.85, p = 0.003). The survival analyses related to treatments in terms of period underlined the superiority of surgery plus radiotherapy between periods IA and HIA (p = 0.03).The advent of IMRT, additional radiotherapy may present a survival advantage in patients with N1 HNC when combined with surgery."
https://openalex.org/W3008017487,"Males of widow spiders courting on the web of females engage in web-reduction behavior which entails excising a section of the web, bundling it up, and wrapping it with their silk. Males of the false black widow spider, Steatoda grossa, in European populations also produce stridulatory courtship sound which has not yet been studied in their invaded North American range. Working with a North American population of S. grossa, we tested the hypotheses that (1) web reduction by males renders webs less attractive to rival males; (2) deposition of silk by courting males has an inter-sexual (male-female) signal function that enhances their likelihood of copulation; and (3) stridulatory sound is a courtship signal of males. Testing anemotactic attraction of males in Y-tube olfactometer experiments revealed that reduced webs (indicative of a mated female) and intact webs (indicative of a virgin female) were equally attractive to males. Recording courtship behavior of males with either functional (silk-releasing) spinnerets or spinnerets experimentally occluded on the web of virgin females showed that males with functional spinnerets were more likely to copulate with the female they courted. Although males possess the stridulatory apparatus to produce courtship sound, they did not stridulate when courting or copulating on the web of females. Our data support the conclusion that web-reduction behavior of S. grossa males in their invaded North American range has no long-range effect on mate seeking males. Instead, web-reduction behavior has an inter-sexual signaling function that seems to be linked to functional spinnerets of the courting male. The signal produced by a male likely entails a volatile silk-borne pheromone, but may also embody a gauge of his endurance (the amount of time he engages in web reduction causing web vibrations)."
https://openalex.org/W3008726330,"Piscivorous avian species are the main source of catfish depredation at aquaculture facilities in Mississippi, resulting in the economic loss of millions of dollars every year. Most notable of these avian species are the double-crested cormorant (Phalacrocorax auritus), great blue heron (Ardea herodias), and great egret (A. alba). Understanding why these species select specific ponds can increase management efficiency directed at avian dispersal and provide insight into their decision making with respect to foraging behavior. We collected species presence data on catfish ponds by flying 35 surveys from October through April of 2015–2017, during which an average of 973 catfish ponds were observed each year. We collected data associated with each pond’s physical surroundings and contents and used occupancy modeling to determine their influence on avian occupancy probability. We also collected data associated with stocking practices and catfish health on a subset of ponds, and constructed resource selection functions to model their influence on avian presence. Pond area was positively related to occupancy probability of each species. Cormorant occupancy increased as pond distance from forest cover and activity centers, such as workshops and offices, increased. Distance to nearest activity center was positively related to egret occupancy, while distance to nearest forested area was negative. Ponds containing diseased catfish had an increased probability of use by both herons and egrets. In general, cormorants and egrets showed greater probability of use on the periphery of pond clusters. The abundance of catfish was positively related to cormorant and heron presence. Specific pond contents and characteristics influenced presence of each avian species in different ways, including fish species cultured, production methods, pond systems, and fish types. Many pond selection relationships were species-specific, illustrating inherent differences in their foraging ecology. Consequently, specific management actions aimed to reduce avian presence will depend on the targeted species."
https://openalex.org/W3008861511,"Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) were formally used as flame-retardants and are chemically stable, lipophlic persistent organic pollutants which are known to bioaccumulate in humans. Although its toxicities are well characterized, little is known about the changes in transcriptional regulation caused by PBDE exposure. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are increasingly recognized as key regulators of transcriptional and translational processes. It is hypothesized that lncRNAs can regulate nearby protein-coding genes (PCGs) and changes in the transcription of lncRNAs may act in cis to perturb gene expression of its neighboring PCGs. The goals of this study were to 1) characterize PCGs and lncRNAs that are differentially regulated from exposure to PBDEs; 2) identify PCG-lncRNA pairs through genome annotation and predictive binding tools; and 3) determine enriched canonical pathways caused by differentially expressed lncRNA-PCGs pairs. HepaRG cells, which are human-derived hepatic cells that accurately represent gene expression profiles of human liver tissue, were exposed to BDE-47 and BDE-99 at a dose of 25 μM for 24 hours. Differentially expressed lncRNA-PCG pairs were identified through DESeq2 and HOMER; significant canonical pathways were determined through Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). LncTar was used to predict the binding of 19 lncRNA-PCG pairs with known roles in drug-processing pathways. Genome annotation revealed that the majority of the differentially expressed lncRNAs map to PCG introns. PBDEs regulated overlapping pathways with PXR and CAR such as protein ubiqutination pathway and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha-retinoid X receptor alpha (PPARα-RXRα) activation but also regulate distinctive pathways involved in intermediary metabolism. PBDEs uniquely down-regulated GDP-L-fucose biosynthesis, suggesting its role in modifying important pathways involved in intermediary metabolism such as carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. In conclusion, we provide strong evidence that PBDEs regulate both PCGs and lncRNAs in a PXR/CAR ligand-dependent and independent manner."
https://openalex.org/W3006880682,"A series of 3D obstacle limitation surfaces (OLS) define the limits to which objects may project in the airspace in order to configure the airspace around aerodromes that must be kept free from obstacles. The aim is to ensure that aircraft can safely carry out their scheduled operations, and to prevent the aerodromes from becoming unusable due to the proliferation of obstacles in the surrounding area. One such possible obstacle is the vegetation growing in the zone. This work consists of a study of the variation in the vegetation in the El Prat airport (Barcelona-El Prat Josep Tarradellas) and the surrounding area in the years 2011–2018, and of the way in which it has influenced the configuration of the OLS. Until 2010, obstacle studies were carried out every four years but the growth of plant obstacles during this period was not controlled. Although the rate of tree growth depends on several factors such as age, species, site quality and forestry treatment, the parameter analysed in this research is height, as this is what will interfere in the OLS. This study therefore focuses on measuring the height and geolocation of the obstacle in order to determine its influence on the OLS, and on determining the subsequent actions, if any, that need to be taken in regard to this vegetation element to avoid it becoming a risk to operational safety. As a result, the growth and vulnerability of 84 vegetation obstacles from 794 terrain elements have been detected. The result of this study is the design, using geographic information systems, of a tool to assist airport managers in the automated control and monitoring of the vegetation in the obstacle limitation surfaces to avoid compromising the safety of airport operations and mitigating environmental impacts."

https://openalex.org/W3007996928,"Experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU) in rodents recapitulates many features of the disease in humans and has served as a useful tool for the development of therapeutics. A peptide from C-terminus of interferon α1, conjugated to palmitoyl-lysine for cell penetration, denoted as IFNα-C, was tested for its anti-inflammatory properties in ARPE-19 cells, followed by testing in a mouse model of EAU. Treatment with IFNα-C and evaluation by RT-qPCR showed the induction of anti-inflammatory cytokines and chemokine. Inflammatory markers induced by treatment with TNFα were suppressed when IFNα-C was simultaneously present. TNF-α mediated induction of NF-κB and signaling by IL-17A were attenuated by IFNα-C. Differentiated ARPE-19 cells were treated with TNFα in the presence or absence IFNα-C and analyzed by immmunhistochemistry. IFNα-C protected against the disruption integrity of tight junction proteins. Similarly, loss of transepithelial resistance caused by TNFα was prevented by IFNα-C. B10.RIII mice were immunized with a peptide from interphotoreceptor binding protein (IRBP) and treated by gavage with IFNα-C. Development of uveitis was monitored by histology, fundoscopy, SD-OCT, and ERG. Treatment with IFNα-C prevented uveitis in mice immunized with the IRBP peptide. Splenocytes isolated from mice with ongoing EAU exhibited antigen-specific T cell proliferation that was inhibited in the presence of IFNα-C. IFNα-C peptide exhibits anti-inflammatory properties and protects mice against damage to retinal structure and function suggesting that it has therapeutic potential for the treatment of autoimmune uveitis."
https://openalex.org/W3007670454,"Background Limited evidence exists on the treatment outcome and factors that are associated with the duration from the initiation of treatment to death or treatment failure in children with drug resistant tuberculosis (DR-TB). Thus, we aimed to determine the proportion of treatment enrollment, status of treatment outcome and determine factors that are associated with the duration from treatment initiation to death or treatment failure in children treated for DR-TB in Ethiopia. Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study in children younger than 15 years old who were treated for DR-TB from February 2009 to February 2019 in Ethiopia. We collected data on socio-demographic and clinical characteristics from clinical charts, registration books and laboratory result reports on 155 children. Proportion of enrollment to the treatment was calculated by dividing the total number of children who were receiving the treatment by the total number of DR-TB patients treated during the specified years. We used Cox proportional hazard models to determine factors that were associated with the duration from the beginning of the treatment to death or treatment failure. Data was analyzed using STATA version 14. Results Of the 3,478 DR-TB patients enrolled into the treatment and fulfilling our inclusion criteria during the past ten years, 155 (4.5%) were children. Of the 155 children, 75 (48.4%) completed the treatment and 51 (32.9%) were cured. Furthermore, 18 (11.6%) children were died, seven (4.5%) lost to follow up and treatment of four (2.6%) children was failed. The overall treatment success was 126 (81.3%). Age younger than 5 years old [Adjusted Hazard Ratio (AHR) = 3.2, 95%CI (1.2–8.3)], HIV sero-reactivity [AHR = 5.3, 95%CI (1.8–14.9)] and being anemic [AHR = 4.3, 95%CI (1.8–10.3)] were significantly associated with the duration from the enrollment into the treatment to death or treatment failure. Conclusion In this study, the proportion of children enrolled into DR-TB treatment was lower than the proportion of adults enrolled to the treatment (4.5% in children versus 95.5% in adults) in last ten years. Our findings also suggest that children with DR-TB can be successfully treated with standardized long term regimen. Further prospective cohort study is required to investigate factors contributing to death or treatment failure."
https://openalex.org/W3007862968,"The time-averaged and instantaneous flow velocity structures of flood waters are not well understood for irregular surfaces such as are created by the presence of roots and fallen branches on forested floodplains. Natural flow structures commonly depart systematically from those described for idealised roughness elements, and an important knowledge gap exists surrounding the effects of natural flow structures on vertical exchanges of fluid and momentum. An improved understanding of the flow structure is required to model flows over forested floodplains more accurately, and to distinguish their dynamics from non-vegetated floodplains or indeed floodplains with other vegetation types, such as reed or grass. Here we present a quantification of the three-dimensional structure of mean flow velocity and turbulence as measured under controlled conditions in an experimental flume using a physical reproduction of a patch of forested floodplain. The results conform in part to existing models of local flow structure over simple roughness elements in aspects such as flow separation downstream of protruding roots, flow reattachment, and the lowering of the velocity maximum further downstream. However, the irregular shape of the surface of the floodplain with exposed roots causes the three-dimensional flow structure to deviate from that anticipated based on previous studies of flows over idealised two-dimensional roughness elements. The results emphasise varied effects of inheritance of flow structures that are generated upstream-the local response of the flow to similar obstacles depends on their spatial organisation and larger-scale context. Key differences from idealised models include the absence of a fully-developed flow at any location in the test section, and various interactions of flow structures such as a reduction of flow separation due to cross-stream circulation and the diversion of the flow over and around the irregular shapes of the roots."
https://openalex.org/W3008011163,"Treatment of neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) with VEGF can be performed with several posologies. The purpose of our cross-sectional study was to analyze retinal vessel density by quantitative OCT-angiography (OCT-A) and to compare treat-and-extend (T&E) and fixed treatment protocols to a control group with dry AMD. Altogether 48 patients were enrolled: 13 eyes with T&E protocol ranibizumab treatment (group A) and 17 eyes with fixed regimen aflibercept therapy (group B), the control group comprised 18 eyes with dry AMD (group C). One year after the start of the treatment, quantitative OCT-A (AngioVue—Optovue, Fermont, USA) was performed: superficial and deep retinal vessel densities were analyzed in the foveal and parafoveal regions. Our results show, that the density of retinal superficial vasculature in the fovea was not different between the treatment groups (A: 25.9±9.1%; B: 24.3%±8.9), neither from group C (25.6±4.8%). Superficial parafoveal vascular density of the retina, however, was decreased in both treated groups (A: 46.7±9.1%, B: 42.9±6.1%, C: 49.7±4.9%). In the deep retinal plexus, vascular density was lower in both treatment groups compared to that of in controls in both the foveal and parafoveal area (A: 29.8±6.3%, B: 32.5±6.9%, C: 36.4±1.7% and A: 46.3±3.8%, B: 47.1±5.3%, C: 49.7±4.9%, foveal and parafoveal respectively). Our data suggest, that after one year of anti-VEGF treatment, reduced macular vessel density in three of the four examined vascular regions can be found independent of the treatment regimen."
https://openalex.org/W3008135613,"Using measures of reflex impairment and injury to quantify an aquatic organism’s vitality have gained popularity as survival predictors of discarded non-target fisheries catch. To evaluate the robustness of this method with respect to ‘rater’ subjectivity, we tested inter- and intra-rater repeatability and the role of ‘expectation bias’. From video clips, multiple raters determined impairment levels of four reflexes of beam-trawled common sole (Solea solea) intended for discard. Raters had a range of technical experience, including veterinary students, practicing veterinarians, and fisheries scientists. Expectation bias was evaluated by first assessing a rater’s assumption about the effect of air exposure on vitality, then comparing their reflex ratings of the same fish, once when the true air exposure duration was indicated and once when the time was exaggerated (by either 15 or 30 min). Inter-rater repeatability was assessed by having multiple raters evaluate those clips with true air exposure information; and intra- and inter-rater repeatability was determined by having individual raters evaluate a series of duplicated clips, all with true air exposure. Results indicate that inter- and intra-rater repeatability were high (intra-class correlation coefficients of 74% for both), and were not significantly affected by background type nor expectation bias related to assumed impact from prolonged air exposure. This suggests that reflex impairment as a metric for predicting fish survival is robust to involving multiple raters with diverse backgrounds. Bias is potentially more likely to be introduced through subjective reflexes than raters, given that consistency in scoring differed for some reflexes based on rater experience type. This study highlights the need to provide ample training for raters, and that no prior experience is needed to become a reliable rater. Moreover, before implementing reflexes in a vitality study, it is important to evaluate whether the determination of presence/absence is subjective."
https://openalex.org/W3007877531,"The objective of this study was to assess whether use of matrix assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF), through improvements in identification time, reduces time to directed antibiotic coverage. We therefore conducted a retrospective review of 377 blood cultures from hospitalized patients with gram negative bacteremia that underwent testing by MALDI-TOF compared to standard identification methods (VITEK 2) for blood cultures from January 2016 to December 2017. We found that MALDI significantly reduced time between blood culture collection to reach pathogen identification and was associated with a significantly reduced time to initiate more specific therapy, with a mean difference of 16.37 hours, 95% CI 10.05 to 22.69 (mean time 50.34 hours (+/- 21.21) vs VITEK: 66.71 hrs (+/- 27.12), p<0.001 as well as a reduced time to discontinue previous therapy (p = 0.004). In conclusion, in reducing time to identification of gram negative bacteremia, MALDI-TOF led to improvements in antibiotic coverage."
https://openalex.org/W3008125399,"Due to differential treatment responses of patients to pharmacotherapy, drug development and practice in medicine are concerned with personalized medicine, which includes identifying subgroups of population that exhibit differential treatment effect. For time–to–event data, available methods only focus on detecting and testing treatment–by–covariate interactions and may not consider multiplicity. In this work, we introduce the Bayesian credible subgroups approach for time–to–event endpoints. It provides two bounding subgroups for the true benefiting subgroup: one which is likely to be contained by the benefiting subgroup and one which is likely to contain the benefiting subgroup. A personalized treatment effect is estimated by two common measures of survival time: the hazard ratio and restricted mean survival time. We apply the method to identify benefiting subgroups in a case study of prostate carcinoma patients and a simulated large clinical dataset."
https://openalex.org/W3007987158,"The number of characters in a movie is an important feature. However, it is non-trivial to measure directly, for example naive metrics such as the number of credited characters vary wildly. Here, we show that a metric based on the notion of ecological diversity as expressed through a Shannon-entropy based metric can characterise the number of characters in a movie, and is useful in taxonomic classification. We also show how the metric can be generalised using Jensen-Shannon divergence to provide a measure of the similarity of characters appearing in different movies, for instance of use in recommendation systems, e.g., Netflix. We apply our measures to the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), and show what they teach us about this highly successful franchise of movies. In particular, these measures provide a useful predictor of success for films in the MCU, as well as a natural means to understand the relationships between the stories in the overall film arc."
https://openalex.org/W3007966612,"We investigated the effects of voluntary hand movements and continuously present objects on the automatic detection of deviant stimuli in a passive oddball paradigm. The visual mismatch negativity (vMMN) component of event-related potentials (ERPs) was measured as the index of automatic deviant detection. The stimuli were textures consisting of parallel, oblique bars with frequent (standard) and infrequent (deviant) orientation. Traditional vMMN was measured by the difference between ERPs to frequent (standard) and infrequent (deviant) textures. Additionally, we measured ‘genuine’ vMMN by comparing the ERPs to deviant and control textures in the equal probability procedure. Compatible and incompatible hand movement directions to the standard texture had no influence on ‘traditional’ vMMN and elicited no ‘genuine’ vMMN. However, the deviant texture elicited ‘genuine’ vMMN if the orientation of a continuously present rectangle was different from the standard (and identical to the deviant) texture orientation. Our results suggest that the direction of voluntary hand movement and the orientation of task-irrelevant visual patterns do not acquire common memory representation, but a continuously present object contributes to the detection of sequential regularity violation."
