https://openalex.org/W2726248338,"A huge smartphone dataset of physical activity yields global insights, revealing that activity inequality predicts obesity better than does volume of activity and that much of the inequality is a result of reduced activity in females. Globally, millions of deaths each year are associated with physical inactivity but our understanding of activity patterns in different populations remains limited owing to a lack of large-scale measurements. Jure Leskovec and colleagues analysed smartphone sensor-based activity patterns from over 600,000 people in 46 countries. They find a large range of distributions of activity levels across populations, which are primarily driven by the activity level of women. The inequality between the least and most active segments of populations is more predictive of obesity prevalence in each population than the mean activity levels. Additionally, inequality is reduced in the more walkable cities where the greatest gains in activity are observed in females. These findings suggest the potential benefits of focusing urban planning and public health policy on increasing activity on the most activity-poor subgroups. To be able to curb the global pandemic of physical inactivity1,2,3,4,5,6,7 and the associated 5.3 million deaths per year2, we need to understand the basic principles that govern physical activity. However, there is a lack of large-scale measurements of physical activity patterns across free-living populations worldwide1,6. Here we leverage the wide usage of smartphones with built-in accelerometry to measure physical activity at the global scale. We study a dataset consisting of 68 million days of physical activity for 717,527 people, giving us a window into activity in 111 countries across the globe. We find inequality in how activity is distributed within countries and that this inequality is a better predictor of obesity prevalence in the population than average activity volume. Reduced activity in females contributes to a large portion of the observed activity inequality. Aspects of the built environment, such as the walkability of a city, are associated with a smaller gender gap in activity and lower activity inequality. In more walkable cities, activity is greater throughout the day and throughout the week, across age, gender, and body mass index (BMI) groups, with the greatest increases in activity found for females. Our findings have implications for global public health policy and urban planning and highlight the role of activity inequality and the built environment in improving physical activity and health."
https://openalex.org/W2734880494,"Two independent systems impairing hepatocyte proliferation during liver injury cause physiologically significant levels of functional hepatocyte regeneration from biliary cells. Liver injury triggers regeneration through proliferation of hepatocytes to compensate for the loss of cells. However, in humans, this process is impaired in chronic liver diseases and it has been difficult to reproduce this impairment in mouse models of liver injury. Stuart Forbes and colleagues have used two systems to impair hepatocyte proliferation, via impairment of β-integrin or overexpression of the cell cycle inhibitor p21. They observe that, following injury under these conditions, epithelial bile duct cells are able to adopt hepatic fate and regenerate up to 25% of functional hepatocytes. After liver injury, regeneration occurs through self-replication of hepatocytes. In severe liver injury, hepatocyte proliferation is impaired—a feature of human chronic liver disease1,2. It is unclear whether other liver cell types can regenerate hepatocytes3,4,5. Here we use two independent systems to impair hepatocyte proliferation during liver injury to evaluate the contribution of non-hepatocytes to parenchymal regeneration. First, loss of β1-integrin in hepatocytes with liver injury triggered a ductular reaction of cholangiocyte origin, with approximately 25% of hepatocytes being derived from a non-hepatocyte origin. Second, cholangiocytes were lineage traced with concurrent inhibition of hepatocyte proliferation by β1-integrin knockdown or p21 overexpression, resulting in the significant emergence of cholangiocyte-derived hepatocytes. We describe a model of combined liver injury and inhibition of hepatocyte proliferation that causes physiologically significant levels of regeneration of functional hepatocytes from biliary cells."
https://openalex.org/W2735589681,"DNA is an excellent medium for archiving data. Recent efforts have illustrated the potential for information storage in DNA using synthesized oligonucleotides assembled in vitro. A relatively unexplored avenue of information storage in DNA is the ability to write information into the genome of a living cell by the addition of nucleotides over time. Using the Cas1-Cas2 integrase, the CRISPR-Cas microbial immune system stores the nucleotide content of invading viruses to confer adaptive immunity. When harnessed, this system has the potential to write arbitrary information into the genome. Here we use the CRISPR-Cas system to encode the pixel values of black and white images and a short movie into the genomes of a population of living bacteria. In doing so, we push the technical limits of this information storage system and optimize strategies to minimize those limitations. We also uncover underlying principles of the CRISPR-Cas adaptation system, including sequence determinants of spacer acquisition that are relevant for understanding both the basic biology of bacterial adaptation and its technological applications. This work demonstrates that this system can capture and stably store practical amounts of real data within the genomes of populations of living cells."
https://openalex.org/W2734881930,"For many enveloped viruses, binding to a receptor(s) on a host cell acts as the first step in a series of events culminating in fusion with the host cell membrane and transfer of genetic material for replication. The envelope glycoprotein (Env) trimer on the surface of HIV is responsible for receptor binding and fusion. Although Env can tolerate a high degree of mutation in five variable regions (V1-V5), and also at N-linked glycosylation sites that contribute roughly half the mass of Env, the functional sites for recognition of receptor CD4 and co-receptor CXCR4/CCR5 are conserved and essential for viral fitness. Soluble SOSIP Env trimers are structural and antigenic mimics of the pre-fusion native, surface-presented Env, and are targets of broadly neutralizing antibodies. Thus, they are attractive immunogens for vaccine development. Here we present high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy structures of subtype B B41 SOSIP Env trimers in complex with CD4 and antibody 17b, or with antibody b12, at resolutions of 3.7 Å and 3.6 Å, respectively. We compare these to cryo-electron microscopy reconstructions of B41 SOSIP Env trimers with no ligand or in complex with either CD4 or the CD4-binding-site antibody PGV04 at 5.6 Å, 5.2 Å and 7.4 Å resolution, respectively. Consequently, we present the most complete description yet, to our knowledge, of the CD4-17b-induced intermediate and provide the molecular basis of the receptor-binding-induced conformational change required for HIV-1 entry into host cells. Both CD4 and b12 induce large, previously uncharacterized conformational rearrangements in the gp41 subunits, and the fusion peptide becomes buried in a newly formed pocket. These structures provide key details on the biological function of the type I viral fusion machine from HIV-1 as well as new templates for inhibitor design."
https://openalex.org/W2736039329,"How a sensory stimulus is processed and perceived depends on the surrounding sensory scene. In the visual cortex, contextual signals can be conveyed by an extensive network of intra- and inter-areal excitatory connections that link neurons representing stimulus features separated in visual space. However, the connectional logic of visual contextual inputs remains unknown; it is not clear what information individual neurons receive from different parts of the visual field, nor how this input relates to the visual features that a neuron encodes, defined by its spatial receptive field. Here we determine the organization of excitatory synaptic inputs responding to different locations in the visual scene by mapping spatial receptive fields in dendritic spines of mouse visual cortex neurons using two-photon calcium imaging. We find that neurons receive functionally diverse inputs from extended regions of visual space. Inputs representing similar visual features from the same location in visual space are more likely to cluster on neighbouring spines. Inputs from visual field regions beyond the receptive field of the postsynaptic neuron often synapse on higher-order dendritic branches. These putative long-range inputs are more frequent and more likely to share the preference for oriented edges with the postsynaptic neuron when the receptive field of the input is spatially displaced along the axis of the receptive field orientation of the postsynaptic neuron. Therefore, the connectivity between neurons with displaced receptive fields obeys a specific rule, whereby they connect preferentially when their receptive fields are co-oriented and co-axially aligned. This organization of synaptic connectivity is ideally suited for the amplification of elongated edges, which are enriched in the visual environment, and thus provides a potential substrate for contour integration and object grouping."
https://openalex.org/W2724716579,"Crystal structures of an activated two-pore potassium channel reveal a cryptic binding pocket that binds small-molecule activators that restrict the mobility of the selectivity filter and surrounding structure, stabilizing an active ‘leak-mode’ conformation. The two-pore domain potassium channels (K2P) are dimeric channels of the voltage-gated ion channel superfamily and are responsive to temperature, mechanical stimuli and small molecules. Despite their physiological importance in pain and temperature perception as well as mood regulation, their pharmacology (how small molecules modulate their activity) is not well understood. In this work, crystal structures of an activated K2P channel are reported, revealing a cryptic binding pocket behind the selectivity filter of the chanel. The small-molecule activators bind to this pocket and restrict the mobility of the selectivity filter and the surrounding structure. This stabilizes a 'leak-mode' conformation, activating the channel and allowing current to leak through. Polymodal thermo- and mechanosensitive two-pore domain potassium (K2P) channels of the TREK1 subfamily generate ‘leak’ currents that regulate neuronal excitability, respond to lipids, temperature and mechanical stretch, and influence pain, temperature perception and anaesthetic responses1,2,3. These dimeric voltage-gated ion channel (VGIC) superfamily members have a unique topology comprising two pore-forming regions per subunit4,5,6. In contrast to other potassium channels, K2P channels use a selectivity filter ‘C-type’ gate7,8,9,10 as the principal gating site. Despite recent advances3,11,12, poor pharmacological profiles of K2P channels limit mechanistic and biological studies. Here we describe a class of small-molecule TREK activators that directly stimulate the C-type gate by acting as molecular wedges that restrict interdomain interface movement behind the selectivity filter. Structures of K2P2.1 (also known as TREK-1) alone and with two selective K2P2.1 (TREK-1) and K2P10.1 (TREK-2) activators—an N-aryl-sulfonamide, ML335, and a thiophene-carboxamide, ML402—define a cryptic binding pocket unlike other ion channel small-molecule binding sites and, together with functional studies, identify a cation–π interaction that controls selectivity. Together, our data reveal a druggable K2P site that stabilizes the C-type gate ‘leak mode’ and provide direct evidence for K2P selectivity filter gating."
https://openalex.org/W2735682848,"Protective high-affinity antibody responses depend on competitive selection of B cells carrying somatically mutated B-cell receptors by follicular helper T (TFH) cells in germinal centres. The rapid T-B-cell interactions that occur during this process are reminiscent of neural synaptic transmission pathways. Here we show that a proportion of human TFH cells contain dense-core granules marked by chromogranin B, which are normally found in neuronal presynaptic terminals storing catecholamines such as dopamine. TFH cells produce high amounts of dopamine and release it upon cognate interaction with B cells. Dopamine causes rapid translocation of intracellular ICOSL (inducible T-cell co-stimulator ligand, also known as ICOSLG) to the B-cell surface, which enhances accumulation of CD40L and chromogranin B granules at the human TFH cell synapse and increases the synapse area. Mathematical modelling suggests that faster dopamine-induced T-B-cell interactions increase total germinal centre output and accelerate it by days. Delivery of neurotransmitters across the T-B-cell synapse may be advantageous in the face of infection."

Metabolic stress from hyperglycemia and elevated free fatty acids have been shown to inhibit endothelial angiogenesis. However, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this study, we show that dysregulation of the Hippo–Yes-associated protein (YAP) pathway, an important signaling mechanism in regulating tissue repair and regeneration, underlies palmitic acid (PA)-induced inhibition of endothelial angiogenesis. PA inhibited endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and tube formation, which were associated with increased expression of mammalian Ste20-like kinases 1 (MST1), YAP phosphorylation/inactivation, and nuclear exclusion. Overexpression of YAP or knockdown of MST1 prevented PA-induced inhibition of angiogenesis. When searching upstream signaling mechanisms, we found that PA dysregulated the Hippo–YAP pathway by inducing mitochondrial damage. PA treatment induced mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) release to cytosol, and activated cytosolic DNA sensor cGAS–STING–IRF3 signaling. Activated IRF3 bound to the MST1 gene promoter and induced MST1 expression, leading to MST1 up-regulation, YAP inactivation, and angiogenesis inhibition. Thus, mitochondrial damage and cytosolic DNA sensor cGAS–STING–IRF3 signaling are critically involved in PA-induced Hippo–YAP dysregulation and angiogenesis suppression. This mechanism may have implication in impairment of angiogenesis and wound healing in diabetes.

YAP and TAZ in epithelial stem cells: a sensor for cell polarity, mechanical forces and tissue damage.Bioessays. 2016; 38: 644-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Given the importance of the Hippo–YAP pathway in angiogenesis, we hypothesized that dysregulation of this pathway is involved in metabolic stress-induced inhibition of endothelial angiogenesis. In the current study, we found that palmitic acid (PA) induced MST1 expression, and subsequently suppressed YAP and endothelial angiogenesis. PA induced MST1 expression through the induction of mitochondrial damage and mitochondrial DNA release, and activation of the cytosolic DNA sensor cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)–interferon genes protein (STING)–interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) pathway. To examine the effects of metabolic stress on endothelial angiogenesis, we treated human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) with PA, the main type of free fatty acid in metabolic syndrome (24.Vessby B. Dietary fat, fatty acid composition in plasma and the metabolic syndrome.Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2003; 14: 15-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). We found that high concentrations of PA significantly reduced endothelial proliferation (Fig. 1, A and B) and impaired endothelial migration (Fig. 1C). HAECs were able to form tubules spontaneously. However, PA treatment severely destroyed tube formation, indicating angiogenesis deficiency (Fig. 1D). These findings suggest that PA inhibits endothelial proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis. We next examined whether PA-induced inhibition of angiogenesis was associated with dysregulation of the Hippo–YAP pathway. As shown in Fig. 2A, PA induced MST1 expression and phosphorylation, indicative of MST1 activation. Consistently, PA induced YAP phosphorylation (Fig. 2A) and nucleus exclusion (Fig. 2B), indicating its inactivation. Overexpression of wild type (WT) YAP not only promoted basal endothelial proliferation (Fig. 2C) and tube formation (Fig. 2D), but also prevented PA-induced reduction in endothelial proliferation (Fig. 2C) and tube formation (Fig. 2D). Overexpression of constitutively active YAP S127A mutant, in which mutation of the phosphorylation site in YAP results in its resistance to phosphorylation and inactivation (25.Meng Z. Moroishi T. Guan K.L. Mechanisms of Hippo pathway regulation.Genes Dev. 2016; 30: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar), also exhibited protective effects (Fig. 2, C and D). In contrast, knocking down YAP with siRNA (supplemental Figs. S1A and S2A) not only reduced endothelial proliferation (supplemental Fig. S1, B and C) and tube formation (supplemental Fig. S1D) at basal conditions, but also amplified PA-induced inhibition of endothelial proliferation (supplemental Fig. S1, B and C) and tube formation (supplemental Fig. S1D). These results indicate that YAP inactivation underlies PA-induced inhibition of endothelial proliferation and angiogenesis. We then investigated the role of MST1 in the inhibition of YAP and endothelial angiogenesis. Knocking down MST1 (supplemental Fig. S2B) prevented PA-induced YAP phosphorylation (Fig. 3A) and cytoplasm retention (Fig. 3B). Additionally, silencing MST1 promoted endothelial proliferation at basal levels, and prevented PA-induced inhibition of endothelial proliferation (Fig. 3, C and D). Similarly, knocking down MST1 alleviated PA-induced inhibition of tube formation (Fig. 3E). Together, these results suggest that MST1 is involved in PA-induced inactivation of YAP and impairment of endothelial angiogenesis. We further studied the mechanism by which PA activated MST1 and inhibited YAP and endothelial angiogenesis. One of the significant adverse effects of free fatty acid oversupply is mitochondrial damage that can trigger cell dysfunction and even cell death (26.Schrauwen P. Hesselink M.K.

We asked whether this mechanism also mediated PA-induced angiogenesis suppression. We first confirmed the effects of PA on mitochondrial function by measuring mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) using tetraethylbenzimidazolylcarbocyanine iodide (JC-1) staining. JC-1 is a cationic fluorescent dye that forms red aggregates in polarized functional mitochondria and stays as a green monomer outside depolarized mitochondria. We observed that PA treatment decreased red aggregates and increased green monomers with an increased green/red fluorescence ratio (Fig. 4A), indicating reduction in Δψm and mitochondrial dysfunction. Additionally, co-staining of double strand DNA (dsDNA) and mitochondria (MitoTracker) showed that PA treatment significantly increased cytosolic dsDNA (dsDNA that did not co-localize with either mitochondria or the nucleus) (28.Mao Y. Luo W. Zhang L. Wu W. Yuan L. Xu H. Song J. Fujiwara K. Abe J.I. LeMaire S.A. Wang X.L. Shen Y.H. STING-IRF3 triggers endothelial inflammation in response to free fatty acid-induced mitochondrial damage in diet-induced obesity.Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2017; 37: 920-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4B). Further cytosolic mtDNA analysis (by PCR of cytosolic DNA with mtDNA sequences as primers) showed PA significantly increased cytosolic mtDNA (Fig. 4C). Furthermore, prolonged PA treatment increased the levels of cGAS, STING, phosphorylated IRF3 (Fig. 4D), suggesting activation of the cGAS–STING–IRF3 pathway. The up-regulation of cGAS–STING–IRF3 was associated with increased MST1 protein and YAP phosphorylation/inactivation (Fig. 4D). Finally, inducing mitochondrial damage with carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone (CCCP), an agent that increases mitochondrial permeability and damage, increased levels of cGAS, STING, and phosphorylated IRF3 (Fig. 4E), and stimulated STING perinuclear translocation and IRF3 nuclear translocation (Fig. 4F), indicating a direct effect of mitochondrial damage in cGAS–STING–IRF3 activation. Together, these data suggest that PA treatment and mitochondrial damage can result in cytosolic release of mtDNA and activation of cytosolic DNA sensor cGAS–STING–IRF3 signaling, which are associated with dysregulation of the Hippo–YAP pathway. We further examined the involvement of the cGAS–STING–IRF3 pathway in the regulation of MST1 and YAP. Silencing cGAS (supplemental Fig. S2C) with siRNA inhibited PA-induced IRF3 phosphorylation, MST1 expression, and YAP phosphorylation (Fig. 5A), suggesting the involvement of cGAS in STING–IRF3 activation and Hippo–Yap dysregulation. Similarly, knocking down STING and IRF3 (supplemental Fig. S2, E and F) prevented PA-induced MST1 expression and YAP phosphorylation (Fig. 5B), and YAP cytosolic retention (Fig. 5C). These results indicate that the cGAS–STING–IRF3 pathway is critical to PA-induced MST1 up-regulation and YAP inhibition in endothelial cells. We then asked how the cGAS–STING–IRF3 pathway regulates the Hippo–YAP pathway. It has been shown that activated MST1 promotes immune reaction and inflammatory response (38.Geng J. Sun X. Wang P. Zhang S. Wang X. Wu H. Hong L. Xie C. Li X. Zhao H. Liu Q. Jiang M. Chen Q. Zhang J.

Invest. 2016; 126: 4125-4139Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Because IRF3 induces the transcription of proinflammatory factors (40.Ishikawa H. Barber G.N. STING is an endoplasmic reticulum adaptor that facilitates innate immune signalling.Nature. 2008; 455: 674-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (1945) Google Scholar), we asked whether IRF3 also promoted MST1 expression. Indeed, silencing STING and IRF3 with specific siRNA reduced PA-induced MST1 mRNA (Fig. 6A), suggesting that IRF3 regulates MST1 at the mRNA level. Sequencing analysis of the MST1 promoter revealed putative IRF3-binding sites in the 5′ untranslated region (Fig. 6B) of the MST1 gene. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay showed that IRF3 bound to the MST1 promoter (Fig. 6C), and this binding was enhanced by treating cells with PA or CCCP. Together, these findings suggest that IRF3 directly binds to the MST1 promoter and promotes MST1 expression in response to PA challenge and mitochondrial damage. Finally, we show that silencing cGAS, STING, and IRF3 promoted endothelial proliferation at basal levels, and partially prevented PA-induced inhibition of endothelial proliferation (Fig. 7, A and B). Similarly, knocking down cGAS, STING, and IRF3 improved endothelial tube formation and reversed PA-induced impairment of endothelial angiogenesis (Fig. 7C). Together, these findings suggest a critical role of the cGAS–STING–IRF3 pathway in PA-induced inhibition of endothelial proliferation and angiogenesis. In this study, we show that PA dysregulates the Hippo–YAP pathway and inhibits angiogenesis. PA induces mitochondrial damage and cytosolic release of mtDNA, which activates the cytosolic DNA sensor cGAS–STING–IRF3 pathway. Activated IRF3 binds to the MST1 promoter and induces MST1 expression, leading to YAP phosphorylation/inactivation and angiogenesis suppression (Fig. 7D). Although impaired angiogenesis and wound healing in diabetes is widely reported, the pathogenesis remains incomplete understood. Hippo–YAP (16.Zhao B. Tumaneng K. Guan K.L.

In contrast, the Hippo pathway, by inactivating YAP, inhibits angiogenesis and tissue repair (42.Moya I.M. Halder G. The Hippo pathway in cellular reprogramming and regeneration of different organs.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2016; 43: 62-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Here we show that dysregulation of Hippo–YAP signaling is also responsible for PA-induced inhibition of angiogenesis. PA treatment activated MST1 and subsequently inhibited YAP, leading to the inhibition of endothelial proliferation and tube formation. This finding implies that dysregulation of Hippo–YAP may represent an important mechanism underlying impaired angiogenesis and wound healing in diabetes.

Mitochondrial dysfunction and damage are significant features in diabetes (46.Szendroedi J. Phielix E. Roden M. The role of mitochondria in insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus.Nat. Rev.

Cell biology: metabolic control of cell death.Science. 2014; 345: 1250256Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar) triggers endothelial dysfunction and injury, contributing to the development of cardiovascular diseases (48.Green D.R.

Res. 2013; 112: 1171-1188Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Here we show that mitochondrial damage is an important mechanism responsible for PA-induced angiogenesis inhibition. We show that PA-induced mtDNA release to cytosol, which may activate cytosolic DNA sensor cGAS–STING–IRF3 signaling, leading to up-regulation of MST1 and inhibition of YAP and angiogenesis. Thus, mitochondrial damage, in addition to inducing endothelial dysfunction and inflammation, can also inhibit endothelial angiogenesis. Protecting mitochondria from damage and/or promoting the removal of damaged mitochondria may be critical in preserving endothelial angiogenesis capacity. The Hippo–YAP pathway can be regulated by multiple mechanisms such as cell–cell interaction and mechanical signals, and by various signaling pathways (25.Meng Z. Moroishi T. Guan K.L. Mechanisms of Hippo pathway regulation.Genes Dev. 2016; 30: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar). Although pathways such as PI3-kinase signaling activate YAP (51.Fan R. Kim N.G. Gumbiner B.M. Regulation of Hippo pathway by mitogenic growth factors via phosphoinositide 3-kinase and phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Res. 2016; 119: 596-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Here, we identified a new signaling pathway, the proinflammatory DNA sensor cGAS–STING–IRF3 pathway as a trigger for Hippo pathway activation and YAP inhibition. We found that the cGAS–STING–IRF3 pathway was involved in dysregulation of the Hippo–YAP pathway in endothelial cells. IRF3 directly bound to the MST1 promoter and induced MST1 expression, leading to YAP phosphorylation and inactivation, and angiogenesis inhibition. Interestingly, a recent study showed that MST1 directly phosphorylated and inactivated IRF3, reduced IRF3 dimerization, and DNA-binding and transcription activity (54.Meng F. Zhou R. Wu S. Zhang Q. Jin Q. Zhou Y. Plouffe S.W. Liu S. Song H. Xia Z. Zhao B. Ye S. Feng X.H. Guan K.L. Zou J. Xu P. Mst1 shuts off cytosolic antiviral defense through IRF3 phosphorylation.Genes Dev. 2016; 30: 1086-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Thus, the cross-talk between the Hippo–YAP and the cGAS–STING–IRF3 pathways can be highly specific to factors such as cell types and stress conditions. Whether the cGAS–STING–IRF3 pathway can also activate Hippo–YAP signaling under other stimulators (e.g. hyperglycemia) or in other cells (e.g. inflammatory cells) remains to be determined. The cGAS–STING–IRF3 pathway plays a critical role in the innate immune response by promoting the expression of genes that suppress pathogen replication or facilitate adaptive immunity (55.You F.

Here our in vitro study shows that activation of the STING pathway is also involved in metabolic stress-induced angiogenesis inhibition. However, further in vivo studies are needed to determine whether this pathway plays a role in angiogenesis defects in diabetes, or whether wound healing in the diabetic condition can be improved by genetic deletion or pharmacological inhibition of STING. Our study has demonstrated that PA dysregulates the Hippo–YAP pathway and inhibits endothelial angiogenesis. PA induces mtDNA cytosolic release and activates the cytosolic DNA sensor cGAS–STING–IRF3 pathway, which promotes MST1 expression, leading to inhibition of YAP and endothelial angiogenesis. This mechanism may have implications in impaired wound healing in diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2735229032,"Seed longevity, defined as the ability to remain alive during storage, is an important agronomic factor. Poor longevity negatively impacts seedling establishment and consequently crop yield. This is particularly problematic for soybean as seeds have a short lifespan. While the economic importance of soybean has fueled a large number of transcriptome studies during embryogenesis and seed filling, the mechanisms regulating seed longevity during late maturation remain poorly understood. Here, a detailed physiological and molecular characterization of late seed maturation was performed in soybean to obtain a comprehensive overview of the regulatory genes that are potentially involved in longevity. Longevity appeared at physiological maturity at the end of seed filling before maturation drying and progressively doubled until the seeds reached the dry state. The increase in longevity was associated with the expression of genes encoding protective chaperones such as heat shock proteins and the repression of nuclear and chloroplast genes involved in a range of chloroplast activities, including photosynthesis. An increase in the raffinose family oligosaccharides (RFO)/sucrose ratio together with changes in RFO metabolism genes was also associated with longevity. A gene co-expression network analysis revealed 27 transcription factors whose expression profiles were highly correlated with longevity. Eight of them were previously identified in the longevity network of Medicago truncatula, including homologues of ERF110, HSF6AB, NFXL1 and members of the DREB2 family. The network also contained several transcription factors associated with auxin and developmental cell fate during flowering, organ growth and differentiation. A transcriptional transition occurred concomitant with seed chlorophyll loss and detachment from the mother plant, suggesting the activation of a post-abscission program. This transition was enriched with AP2/EREBP and WRKY transcription factors and genes associated with growth, germination and post-transcriptional processes, suggesting that this program prepares the seed for the dry quiescent state and germination."
https://openalex.org/W2734574050,"This communication describes a glove capable of wirelessly translating the American Sign Language (ASL) alphabet into text displayable on a computer or smartphone. The key components of the device are strain sensors comprising a piezoresistive composite of carbon particles embedded in a fluoroelastomer. These sensors are integrated with a wearable electronic module consisting of digitizers, a microcontroller, and a Bluetooth radio. Finite-element analysis predicts a peak strain on the sensors of 5% when the knuckles are fully bent. Fatigue studies suggest that the sensors successfully detect the articulation of the knuckles even when bent to their maximal degree 1,000 times. In concert with an accelerometer and pressure sensors, the glove is able to translate all 26 letters of the ASL alphabet. Lastly, data taken from the glove are used to control a virtual hand; this application suggests new ways in which stretchable and wearable electronics can enable humans to interface with virtual environments. Critically, this system was constructed of components costing less than $100 and did not require chemical synthesis or access to a cleanroom. It can thus be used as a test bed for materials scientists to evaluate the performance of new materials and flexible and stretchable hybrid electronics."
https://openalex.org/W2735934063,"Drought is a major threat to maize growth and production. Understanding the molecular regulation network of drought tolerance in maize is of great importance. In this study, two maize inbred lines with contrasting drought tolerance were tested in the field under natural soil drought and well-watered conditions. In addition, the transcriptomes of their leaves was analyzed by RNA-Seq. In total, 555 and 2,558 genes were detected to specifically respond to drought in the tolerant and the sensitive line, respectively, with a more positive regulation tendency in the tolerant genotype. Furthermore, 4,700, 4,748, 4,403 and 4,288 genes showed differential expression between the two lines under moderate drought, severe drought and their well-watered controls, respectively. Transcription factors were enriched in both genotypic differentially expressed genes and specifically responsive genes of the tolerant line. It was speculated that the genotype-specific response of 20 transcription factors in the tolerance line and the sustained genotypically differential expression of 22 transcription factors might enhance tolerance to drought in maize. Our results provide new insight into maize drought tolerance-related regulation systems and provide gene resources for subsequent studies and drought tolerance improvement."

Here we show that ER-localized THBS1 is cytoprotective to rat, mouse, and human β-cells exposed to cytokines or thapsigargin-induced ER stress. THBS1 confers cytoprotection by maintaining expression of mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neutrotrophic factor (MANF) in β-cells and thereby prevents the BH3-only protein BIM (BCL2-interacting mediator of cell death)-dependent triggering of the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis. Prolonged exposure of β-cells to cytokines or thapsigargin leads to THBS1 and MANF degradation and loss of this prosurvival mechanism.

Type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T1D 3The abbreviations used are: T1D, type 1 diabetes; T2D, type 2 diabetes; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; PERK, protein kinase R-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase; MANF, mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neutrotrophic factor; BiP, binding immunoglobulin protein; DCF, 2‘,7‘-dichlorofluorescein diacetate; THBS, thrombospondin; PUMA, p53-upregulated modulator of apoptosis; DP5, death protein 5; BIM, BCL2-interacting mediator of cell death; BAD, BCL-2-associated death promoter; BAX, BCL-2-associated protein X; NOD, nonobese diabetic; THA, thapsigargin; ad, adenovirus; Luc, luciferase. 3The abbreviations used are: T1D, type 1 diabetes; T2D, type 2 diabetes; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; PERK, protein kinase R-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase; MANF, mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neutrotrophic factor; BiP, binding immunoglobulin protein; DCF, 2‘,7‘-dichlorofluorescein diacetate; THBS, thrombospondin; PUMA, p53-upregulated modulator of apoptosis; DP5, death protein 5; BIM, BCL2-interacting mediator of cell death; BAD, BCL-2-associated death promoter; BAX, BCL-2-associated protein X; NOD, nonobese diabetic; THA, thapsigargin; ad, adenovirus; Luc, luciferase. and T2D, respectively) are characterized by failure of the pancreatic β-cells. In T1D, this is caused by autoimmune aggression against β-cells that leads to progressive β-cell dysfunction and death. The pathogenesis of T2D is characterized by different degrees of β-cell failure/loss relative to variable degrees of insulin resistance (1.Cnop M. Welsh N. Jonas J.C. Jörns A. Lenzen S. Eizirik D.L. Mechanisms of pancreatic β-cell death in type 1 and type 2 diabetes: many differences, few similarities.Diabetes. 2005; 54: S97-S107Crossref PubMed Scopus (1177) Google Scholar). Apoptosis seems to be the main form of β-cell death in both forms of the disease. In T1D, invading immune cells trigger β-cell death by cell-to-cell contact and local production of proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1β and IFN-γ (2.Eizirik D.L. Colli M.L. Ortis F. The role of inflammation in insulitis and β-cell loss in type 1 diabetes.Nat. Rev. Endocrinol. 2009; 5: 219-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar). The recent observation that gene expression in laser-captured islets from recent-onset T1D patients (3.Lundberg M. Krogvold L. Kuric E. Dahl-Jørgensen K. Skog O. Expression of interferon-stimulated genes in insulitic pancreatic islets of patients recently diagnosed with type 1 diabetes.Diabetes. 2016; 65: 3104-3110Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) is remarkably similar to gene expression in human islets exposed in vitro to IL-1β and IFN-γ (4.Eizirik D.L. Sammeth M. Bouckenooghe T. Bottu G. Sisino G. Igoillo-Esteve M. Ortis F. Santin I. Colli M.L. Barthson J. Bouwens L. Hughes L. Gregory L. Lunter G. Marselli L. et al.The human pancreatic islet transcriptome: expression of candidate genes for type 1 diabetes and the impact of pro-inflammatory cytokines.PLoS Genet. 2012; 8: e1002552Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar) supports the idea that these cytokines (or other cytokines that elicit similar signal transduction) play a role in the human disease. In the context of T2D, the metabolic stress of chronic exposure to elevated levels of saturated free fatty acids, such as palmitate, and glucose contribute to β-cell dysfunction and apoptosis (5.Cnop M. Fatty acids and glucolipotoxicity in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes.Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2008; 36: 348-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 6.Poitout V. Robertson R.P. Glucolipotoxicity: fuel excess and β-cell dysfunction.Endocr. Rev. 2008; 29: 351-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar). It is of high interest to identify approaches that prevent both immune-mediated and metabolic β-cell demise; such an approach would be very useful in the prevention or early treatment of T1D and T2D. This task is made difficult, however, by the fact that proinflammatory cytokines (4.Eizirik D.L. Sammeth M. Bouckenooghe T. Bottu G. Sisino G. Igoillo-Esteve M. Ortis F. Santin I. Colli M.L.

Marchetti P. et al.RNA sequencing identifies dysregulation of the human pancreatic islet transcriptome by the saturated fatty acid palmitate.Diabetes. 2014; 63: 1978-1993Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) induce different gene networks and lead to pancreatic β-cell apoptosis by different mechanisms (1.Cnop M. Welsh N. Jonas J.C. Jörns A. Lenzen S. Eizirik D.L. Mechanisms of pancreatic β-cell death in type 1 and type 2 diabetes: many differences, few similarities.Diabetes. 2005; 54: S97-S107Crossref PubMed Scopus (1177) Google Scholar). One cellular stress response that is, however, present in β-cells in both forms of diabetes is endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress (8.Marchetti P. Bugliani M. Lupi R. Marselli L. Masini M. Boggi U. Filipponi F. Weir G.C. Eizirik D.L. Cnop M.

Pharmacological modulation of the ER stress response might therefore hold promise for β-cell therapy (10.Engin F. Yermalovich A. Nguyen T. Ngyuen T. Hummasti S. Fu W. Eizirik D.L. Mathis D.

The multimeric Ca2+-binding glycoprotein thrombospondin 1 (THBS1) protects cardiomyocytes against ER stress via activation of ATF6 and downstream chaperones (12.Lynch J.M. Maillet M. Vanhoutte D.

A thrombospondin-dependent pathway for a protective ER stress response.Cell. 2012; 149: 1257-1268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). We have shown recently that THBS1 protects human and rodent β-cells from palmitate-induced apoptosis (13.Cunha D.A. Cito M. Carlsson P.O. Vanderwinden J.M. Molkentin J.D. Bugliani M. Marchetti P. Eizirik D.L. Cnop M. Thrombospondin 1 protects pancreatic β-cells from lipotoxicity via the PERK-NRF2 pathway.Cell Death Differ. 2016; 23: 1995-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Different from cardiomyocytes, however, this takes place through activation of the ER stress transducer protein kinase R-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) and the downstream transcription factor NRF2, increasing the β-cell capacity to withstand oxidative stress induced by saturated fatty acids (13.Cunha D.A. Cito M. Carlsson P.O. Vanderwinden J.M. Molkentin J.D. Bugliani M. Marchetti P. Eizirik D.L. Cnop M. Thrombospondin 1 protects pancreatic β-cells from lipotoxicity via the PERK-NRF2 pathway.Cell Death Differ. 2016; 23: 1995-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Here we tested whether THBS1 is equally beneficial to rodent and human β-cells exposed to cytokines or chemically induced ER stress. THBS1 was clearly protective, but this was mediated by a different mechanism compared with protection against lipotoxic β-cell demise (13.Cunha D.A. Cito M. Carlsson P.O. Vanderwinden J.M. Molkentin J.D. Bugliani M. Marchetti P. Eizirik D.L. Cnop M. Thrombospondin 1 protects pancreatic β-cells from lipotoxicity via the PERK-NRF2 pathway.Cell Death Differ. 2016; 23: 1995-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) or cardiomyopathy (12.Lynch J.M. Maillet M. Vanhoutte D. Schloemer A. Sargent M.A. Blair N.S. Lynch K.A. Okada T. Aronow B.J. Osinska H. Prywes R. Lorenz J.N. Mori K. Lawler J. Robbins J. Molkentin J.D. A thrombospondin-dependent pathway for a protective ER stress response.Cell. 2012; 149: 1257-1268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar); namely, through induction of the mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neutrotrophic factor (MANF). This raises the intriguing possibility that the multifunctional protein THBS1 changes roles and/or partner affinities in a cell- or stress-specific manner, as suggested recently for other complex biological systems (14.Hu J.X. Thomas C.E. Brunak S. Network biology concepts in complex disease comorbidities.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2016; 17: 615-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Furthermore, these findings indicate that THBS1-inducing agents may represent a novel strategy for β-cell protection in both T1D and T2D. Knockdown of THBS1 in rat INS-1E cells by two independent siRNAs did not affect basal expression of cleaved caspase 9 and 3 and apoptosis (Fig. 1, A and B), but it augmented caspase cleavage and cell death following exposure to the chemical ER stressor thapsigargin (an inhibitor of the SERCA2 pump that depletes ER Ca2+) and the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IFN-γ, which cause ER stress, at least in part, via inhibition of SERCA2 (15.Cardozo A.K. Ortis F. Storling J. Feng Y.M. Rasschaert J. Tonnesen M. Van Eylen F. Mandrup-Poulsen T. Herchuelz A. Eizirik D.L. Cytokines downregulate the sarcoendoplasmic reticulum pump Ca2+ ATPase 2b and deplete endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+, leading to induction of endoplasmic reticulum stress in pancreatic β-cells.Diabetes. 2005; 54: 452-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). The cleavage of both caspase 9 and 3 indicates that THBS1 knockdown favors activation of the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis by thapsigargin and cytokines (16.Gurzov E.N. Eizirik D.L. Bcl-2 proteins in diabetes: mitochondrial pathways of β-cell death and dysfunction.Trends Cell Biol. 2011; 21: 424-431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). These findings were confirmed in human islets silenced for THBS1 (Fig. 1, C and D). Apoptosis was also detected by immunostaining for cleaved caspase 3 in THBS1-depleted human β-cells exposed to thapsigargin (Fig. 1E and supplemental Fig. S1) or cytokines (supplemental Fig. S1). Islets isolated from THBS1 knock-out mice were also significantly sensitized to thapsigargin and cytokines (Fig. 1F); in both cases, lack of THBS1 sensitized the cells to thapsigargin- and cytokine-induced apoptosis. In mirror experiments, THBS1 was overexpressed in INS-1E cells (Fig. 1G) and human islet cells (Fig. 1I) using an adenoviral vector. THBS1 overexpression partially reduced thapsigargin- and cytokine-induced caspase 9 and 3 cleavage (Fig. 1G) and apoptosis in rat β-cells (Fig. 1H) and human islet cells (Fig. 1J). Because the above findings indicate that THBS1 protects human, rat, and mouse β-cells from cytokine- and ER stress–induced cell death, we evaluated whether these stresses affect THBS1 expression. Exposure of human islets to two different ER stressors, brefeldin A (which blocks transfer of cargo from the ER to the Golgi) and thapsigargin, decreased THBS1 mRNA expression by nearly 80% (Fig. 2A). A similar inhibition was observed in IL-1β and IFN-γ-exposed human islets (Fig. 2A), and these findings were confirmed at the protein level for thapsigargin and cytokines (Fig. 2B). Thapsigargin, which rapidly induces severe ER stress in INS-1E cells (15.Cardozo A.K. Ortis F. Storling J. Feng Y.M. Rasschaert J. Tonnesen M. Van Eylen F. Mandrup-Poulsen T. Herchuelz A. Eizirik D.L. Cytokines downregulate the sarcoendoplasmic reticulum pump Ca2+ ATPase 2b and deplete endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+, leading to induction of endoplasmic reticulum stress in pancreatic β-cells.Diabetes. 2005; 54: 452-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar), already reduced THBS1 protein expression by 2 h, with a progressive decrease up to 24 h (Fig. 2C). Cytokines, which induce ER stress more slowly in INS-1E cells (by 6–8 h) (15.Cardozo A.K. Ortis F. Storling J. Feng Y.M. Rasschaert J. Tonnesen M. Van Eylen F. Mandrup-Poulsen T. Herchuelz A. Eizirik D.L. Cytokines downregulate the sarcoendoplasmic reticulum pump Ca2+ ATPase 2b and deplete endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+, leading to induction of endoplasmic reticulum stress in pancreatic β-cells.Diabetes. 2005; 54: 452-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar), inhibited THBS1 expression by 8 h, with a nadir at 24 h. These observations suggest that chemical or cytokine-mediated ER stress progressively decreases THBS1 expression in β-cells, sensitizing these cells to a pro-apoptotic outcome. In addition to transcriptional inhibition (Fig. 2A), proteasomal degradation contributes to THBS1 depletion, as proteasome inhibition by MG132 prevented the loss of THBS1 (Fig. 2E). THBS1 may reside in the ER and/or be secreted into the extracellular milieu (13.Cunha D.A. Cito M. Carlsson P.O. Vanderwinden J.M. Molkentin J.D. Bugliani M. Marchetti P. Eizirik D.L. Cnop M.

We thus investigated whether intra- or extracellular THBS1 mediates cytoprotection against cytokines or thapsigargin (Fig. 1). Conditioned medium from INS-1E cells overexpressing THBS1 (Fig. 3A) or exogenously added recombinant THBS1 (Fig. 3B), shown previously by us to transduce signals in β-cells (13.Cunha D.A. Cito M. Carlsson P.O. Vanderwinden J.M. Molkentin J.D. Bugliani M. Marchetti P. Eizirik D.L. Cnop M. Thrombospondin 1 protects pancreatic β-cells from lipotoxicity via the PERK-NRF2 pathway.Cell Death Differ. 2016; 23: 1995-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), failed to protect INS-1E cells against thapsigargin- or cytokine-induced apoptosis. On the other hand, an adenovirus for THBS1 containing the ER retention sequence KDEL (13.Cunha D.A. Cito M. Carlsson P.O. Vanderwinden J.M. Molkentin J.D. Bugliani M. Marchetti P. Eizirik D.L. Cnop M. Thrombospondin 1 protects pancreatic β-cells from lipotoxicity via the PERK-NRF2 pathway.Cell Death Differ. 2016; 23: 1995-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) was cytoprotective to the same extent as the control THBS1-FLAG adenovirus (Fig. 3, C and D). Islet cells from THBS1−/− mice have increased susceptibility to cell death induced by ER stressors or cytokines (Fig. 1F), and we next evaluated whether ER-retained THBS1-KDEL could rescue this phenotype. The THBS1-KDEL adenovirus markedly induced THBS1 mRNA expression under both control or stressed conditions (Fig. 3E). As in human islet cells (Fig. 1J), THBS1+/+ mouse islet cells were protected against thapsigargin or cytokines (Fig. 3F). Importantly, overexpression of ER-retained THBS1 in islet cells that lack endogenous THBS1 (THBS1−/−) abrogated the marked susceptibility to thapsigargin or cytokines (Fig. 3F), indicating that the ER-retained form of THBS1 is necessary and sufficient for the cytoprotective effects. It has been shown that THBS1 protects cardiomyocytes against ER stress by activating the transcription factor ATF6 and, thereby, up-regulating protective chaperones such as binding immunoglobulin protein (BiP) (12.Lynch J.M. Maillet M. Vanhoutte D. Schloemer A. Sargent M.A. Blair N.S. Lynch K.A. Okada T. Aronow B.J. Osinska H. Prywes R. Lorenz J.N. Mori K. Lawler J. Robbins J. Molkentin J.D. A thrombospondin-dependent pathway for a protective ER stress response.Cell. 2012; 149: 1257-1268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). This does not, however, explain β-cell protection by THBS1. THBS1 silencing did not impair ATF6 activity, as assessed using a luciferase reporter, or BiP expression (supplemental Fig. S2, A and B). In keeping with previous findings (12.Lynch J.M. Maillet M. Vanhoutte D. Schloemer A. Sargent M.A. Blair N.S. Lynch K.A. Okada T. Aronow B.J. Osinska H. Prywes R. Lorenz J.N. Mori K. Lawler J.

Thrombospondin 1 protects pancreatic β-cells from lipotoxicity via the PERK-NRF2 pathway.Cell Death Differ. 2016; 23: 1995-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), THBS1 knockdown reduced signaling in the PERK pathway (supplemental Fig. S2A). Conversely, THBS1 overexpression did not induce expression of BiP protein or mRNA, nor did it induce the ATF6 target GRP94 (supplemental Fig. S2, C and D). Our recent findings indicate that THBS1 protects β-cells from lipotoxicity via the PERK-NRF2 pathway and consequent up-regulation of antioxidant defenses (13.Cunha D.A. Cito M. Carlsson P.O. Vanderwinden J.M. Molkentin J.D. Bugliani M. Marchetti P. Eizirik D.L. Cnop M. Thrombospondin 1 protects pancreatic β-cells from lipotoxicity via the PERK-NRF2 pathway.Cell Death Differ. 2016; 23: 1995-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). THBS1 loss or gain of function did not, however, alter oxidative stress (supplemental Fig. S3, A and B). Cytokines, but not thapsigargin, increased oxidation of 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCF), and this was not altered by modulation of THBS1 expression (supplemental Fig. S3, A and B). In line with these findings, neither THBS1 silencing nor overexpression modified expression of the antioxidant genes GSTm1, catalase, and SOD2 (supplemental Fig. S3, C and D). THBS1 knockdown did not affect the activity of an antioxidant response element luciferase reporter (supplemental Fig. S3E), which we found previously to be activated by palmitate via up-regulation of NRF2 (13.Cunha D.A. Cito M. Carlsson P.O. Vanderwinden J.M. Molkentin J.D. Bugliani M. Marchetti P. Eizirik D.L. Cnop M. Thrombospondin 1 protects pancreatic β-cells from lipotoxicity via the PERK-NRF2 pathway.Cell Death Differ. 2016; 23: 1995-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). As a whole, these observations indicate that THBS1 protects β-cells against palmitate or cytokines/ER stressors by different mechanisms. We next explored alternative mechanisms underlying the THBS1 cytoprotection and examined the expression of MANF, shown previously to be up-regulated by THBS (12.Lynch J.M. Maillet M. Vanhoutte D. Schloemer A. Sargent M.A. Blair N.S. Lynch K.A. Okada T. Aronow B.J. Osinska H. Prywes R. Lorenz J.N. Mori K. Lawler J. Robbins J. Molkentin J.D. A thrombospondin-dependent pathway for a protective ER stress response.Cell. 2012; 149: 1257-1268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). MANF is an ER stress–regulated protein that is crucial for postnatal mouse β-cell survival (19.Lindahl M. Danilova T. Palm E. Lindholm P. Võikar V. Hakonen E. Ustinov J. Andressoo J.O. Harvey B.K. Otonkoski T. Rossi J. Saarma M. MANF is indispensable for the proliferation and survival of pancreatic β cells.Cell Rep. 2014; 7: 366-375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Thapsigargin and cytokines inhibited MANF protein expression, and this was aggravated by THBS1 knockdown (Fig. 4A). Palmitate, on the other hand, did not reduce MANF expression (Fig. 4A). A time course analysis in INS-1E cells exposed to cytokines showed that MANF expression already decreased at 4 h, and more so in THBS1-depleted cells (Fig. 4B). On the other hand, adenoviral THBS1 overexpression induced and preserved MANF expression for up to 8 h of cytokine exposure (Fig. 4C). MANF depletion by cytokines was not associated with a change in its subcellular localization, which remained cytoplasmic (Fig. 4D). As for THBS1, proteasome inhibition by MG132 prevented the cytokine-induced loss of MANF protein (Fig. 4E). We next examined the role of MANF directly using two independent siRNAs. Efficient MANF knockdown (Fig. 4F) did not affect basal cell survival but sensitized INS-1E cells to both thapsigargin- and cytokine-induced apoptosis (Fig. 4G). A similar sensitization was seen in human insulin-producing EndoC-βH1 cells (Fig. 4H). Apoptosis was further confirmed by immunostaining for cleaved caspase 3 in MANF-depleted thapsigargin- or cytokine-treated EndoC-βH1 cells (supplemental Fig. S4). MANF silencing also induced caspase 3 cleavage in insulin-stained primary human β-cells exposed to thapsigargin (Fig. 4I and supplemental Fig. S5) or cytokines (supplemental Fig. S5). We next examined whether cytoprotection could be achieved by exogenously added MANF protein. Recombinant MANF protein failed to protect clonal rat INS-1E cells against thapsigargin or cytokines (Fig. 5A). In clonal human EndoC-βH1 cells, however, partial protection was observed from both stresses (Fig. 5B). Comparable cytoprotection was seen in dispersed mouse islet cells (Fig. 5C). Apoptosis was further assessed by TUNEL assay, confirming that recombinant MANF decreases thapsigargin-induced apoptosis in insulin-positive mouse β-cells (Fig. 5D). Taken together, these data show significant protection conferred by exogenous MANF in mouse and human but not rat β-cells, pointing to a species difference. To evaluate whether MANF is indeed an important mediator of the protective effects of THBS1, we adenovirally overexpressed THBS1 and knocked down MANF in parallel (Fig. 6A). Inhibition of MANF abrogated the beneficial effects of THBS1 overexpression in INS-1E cells (Fig. 6B). Similarly, efficient THBS1 overexpression and MANF silencing in human islet cells (Fig. 6C) abolished the cytoprotection conferred by THBS1 (Fig. 6D). In mirror experiments, lentiviral MANF overexpression concurrent to THBS1 silencing (Fig. 6E) completely prevented sensitization to cytokine-induced apoptosis (Fig. 6F). These data show that MANF is necessary and sufficient for THBS1-mediated β-cell protection against cytokines or ER stress. We next evaluated the effector mechanisms downstream of THBS1-MANF that regulate β-cell apoptosis. Previous data indicate that the BH3-only proteins PUMA (p53-upregulated modulator of apoptosis, also known as BBC3) (20.Gurzov E.N. Germano C.M. Cunha D.A. Ortis F. Vanderwinden J.M. Marchetti P. Zhang L. Eizirik D.L. p53 up-regulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA) activation contributes to pancreatic β-cell apoptosis induced by proinflammatory cytokines and endoplasmic reticulum stress.J.

Germano C.M. Moore F. Maida A. Drucker D.J. Marchetti P. Gysemans C. Mathieu C. Nuñez G. Jurisicova A. Eizirik D.L. Gurzov E.N.

Chem. 2011; 286: 39632-39643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) are critical mediators of cytokine-induced apoptosis, whereas the Bcl-2 family proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL antagonize these effects (16.Gurzov E.N.

Bcl-2 proteins in diabetes: mitochondrial pathways of β-cell death and dysfunction.Trends Cell Biol. 2011; 21: 424-431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Knockdown or overexpression of THBS1 did not modify the expression of DP5, PUMA, BIM, Bcl-2, and Bcl-XL in INS-1E cells (supplemental Fig. S6, A–E). BH3-only proteins may be a necessary component for cytokine-induced apoptosis, even under conditions where their expression is not up-regulated (16.Gurzov E.N. Eizirik D.L. Bcl-2 proteins in diabetes: mitochondrial pathways of β-cell death and dysfunction.Trends Cell Biol. 2011; 21: 424-431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 23.Marroquí L.

To test whether this was the case here, we silenced THBS1 in parallel with BIM, DP5, PUMA, or BCL-2-associated death promoter (BAD) (Fig. 7A). Efficient knockdown was achieved for BIM (by 52%; Fig. 7, B and D), DP5 (silencing of mRNA by 63%), PUMA (by 74%), and BAD (by 89%). BIM silencing, but not DP5, PUMA, or BAD knockdown, partially prevented cytokine-induced apoptosis in THBS1-depleted β-cells (Fig. 7A). In a similar experimental approach, BIM also mediated apoptosis induced by thapsigargin (Fig. 7, B and C). Because THBS1 cytoprotection requires MANF expression (see above), we examined whether BIM also mediates cell death induced by MANF deficiency. BIM knockdown fully abrogated sensitization to cytokine-induced apoptosis in MANF-depleted cells (Fig. 7, D and E). These observations indicate that BIM is the downstream mediator of β-cell apoptosis following inhibition of the THBS1–MANF pathway. The local release of proinflammatory mediators by infiltrating immune cells contributes to pancreatic β-cell demise in T1D. Cytokine-induced ER stress is one of the molecular mechanisms activating the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis in β-cells (9.Marhfour I. Lopez X.M. Lefkaditis D. Salmon I. Allagnat F.

https://openalex.org/W2734598365,"Cattle farming is a major source of greenhouse gases (GHGs). Recent research suggests that GHG fluxes from dung pats could be affected by biotic interactions involving dung beetles. Whether and how these effects vary among beetle species and with assemblage composition is yet to be established. To examine the link between GHGs and different dung beetle species assemblages, we used a closed chamber system to measure fluxes of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) from cattle dung pats. Targeting a total of four dung beetle species (a pat-dwelling species, a roller of dung balls, a large and a small tunnelling species), we ran six experimental treatments (four monospecific and two mixed) and two controls (one with dung but without beetles, and one with neither dung nor beetles). In this setting, the overall presence of beetles significantly affected the gas fluxes, but different species contributed unequally to GHG emissions. When compared to the control with dung, we detected an overall reduction in the total cumulative CO2 flux from all treatments with beetles and a reduction in N2O flux from the treatments with the three most abundant dung beetle species. These reductions can be seen as beneficial ecosystem services. Nonetheless, we also observed a disservice provided by the large tunneler, Copris lunaris, which significantly increased the CH4 flux–an effect potentially traceable to the species’ nesting strategy involving the construction of large brood balls. When fluxes were summed into CO2-equivalents across individual GHG compounds, dung with beetles proved to emit less GHGs than did beetle-free dung, with the mix of the three most abundant species providing the highest reduction (-32%). As the mix of multiple species proved the most effective in reducing CO2-equivalents, the conservation of diverse assemblages of dung beetles emerges as a priority in agro-pastoral ecosystems."

https://openalex.org/W2735501845,"In humans, nonhomologous DNA end-joining (NHEJ) is the major pathway by which DNA double-strand breaks are repaired. Recognition of each broken DNA end by the DNA repair protein Ku is the first step in NHEJ, followed by the iterative binding of nucleases, DNA polymerases, and the XRCC4-DNA ligase IV (X4-LIV) complex in an order influenced by the configuration of the two DNA ends at the break site. The endonuclease Artemis improves joining efficiency by functioning in a complex with DNA-dependent protein kinase, catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) that carries out endonucleolytic cleavage of 5' and 3' overhangs. Previously, we observed that X4-LIV alone can stimulate Artemis activity on 3' overhangs, but this DNA-PKcs-independent endonuclease activity of Artemis awaited confirmation. Here, using in vitro nuclease and ligation assays, we find that stimulation of Artemis nuclease activity by X4-LIV and the efficiency of blunt-end ligation are determined by structural configurations at the DNA end. Specifically, X4-LIV stimulated Artemis to cut near the end of 3' overhangs without the involvement of other NHEJ proteins. Of note, this ligase complex is not able to stimulate Artemis activity at hairpins or at 5' overhangs. We also found that X4-LIV and DNA-PKcs interfere with one another with respect to stimulating Artemis activity at 3' overhangs, favoring the view that these NHEJ proteins are sequentially rather than concurrently recruited to DNA ends. These data suggest specific functional and positional relationships among these components that explain genetic and molecular features of NHEJ and V(D)J recombination within cells."

A total of 25 patients with CRPS and 25 matched healthy controls underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging at rest. With the anterior and posterior insular cortices as seed regions, we compared the strength of the resting-state functional connectivity between the two groups. Functional connectivity between the anterior and posterior insular cortices and the postcentral and inferior frontal gyri, cingulate cortices was reduced in patients with CRPS compared with controls. Additionally, greater reductions in functional connectivity between the anterior insula and right postcentral gyrus were associated with more severe sensory pain in patients with CRPS (short-form McGill Pain Questionnaire sensory subscores, r = -.517, P = .023). The present results imply a possible role of the insula in aberrant processing of pain information in patients with CRPS. The findings suggest that a functional derangement of the connection between one of the somatosensory cortical functions of perception and one of the insular functions of awareness can play a significant role in the persistent experience of regional pain that is not confined to a specific nerve territory."

This case-control study was aimed at assessing the risk of oral cancer associated with a smokeless tobacco product (Naswar). The study was conducted from September 2014 till May 2015 in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan. Exposure and covariate information was collected through a structured questionnaire. Conditional logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios (OR) along with their 95% confidence intervals (CI). 84 oral cancer cases (62% males) and 174 age- and sex-matched controls were recruited. Ever users of Naswar had more than a 20-fold higher risk of oral cancer compared to never-users (OR 21.2, 95% CI 8.4–53.8). Females had a higher risk of oral cancer with the use of Naswar (OR 29.0, 95% CI 5.4–153.9) as compared to males (OR 21.0, 95% CI 6.1–72.1). Based on this result, 68% (men) and 38% (women) of the oral cancer burden in Pakistan is attributable to Naswar. The risk estimates observed in this study are comparable to risk estimates reported by previous studies on other forms of SLT use and the risk of oral cancer in Pakistan. The exposure-response relationship also supports a strong role of Naswar in the etiology of oral cancer in Pakistan. Although still requiring further validation through independent studies, these findings may be used for smokeless tobacco control in countries where Naswar use is common."

The total small RNA of diapause-destined silkworm eggs and HCl-treated eggs was extracted and then sequenced using HiSeq high-throughput method. 44 novel miRNAs were discovered. Compared to those in the diapause-destined eggs, 61 miRNAs showed significant changes in the acid-treated eggs, with 23 being up-regulated and 38 being down-regulated. The potential target genes of differentially expressed miRNAs were predicted by miRanda. Gene Ontology and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of these potential target genes revealed that they were mainly located within cells and organelles, involved in cellular and metabolic processes, and participated in protein production, processing and transportation. Two differentially expressed genes, Bombyx mori SDH and Bmo-miR-2761-3p, were further analyzed with qRT-PCR. BmSDH was significantly up-regulated in the HCl-treated eggs, while Bmo-miR-2761-3p was down-regulated. These results suggested that these two genes were well coordinated in silkworm eggs. Dual luciferase reporter assay demonstrated that Bmo-miR-2761-3p inhibited the expression of BmSDH."

Our objectives were to compare validity of five missing data imputation methods to estimate underlying BP and longitudinal associations of underlying BP and age. We simulated BP treatment in untreated hypertensive participants from Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) in visits 1-5 (1987-2013) using matched treated hypertensive participants. The underlying BP was imputed: #1, set as missing; #2, add 10 mmHg for systolic, 5 mmHg for diastolic; #3, add medication class-specific constant; #4, truncated normal regression; and #5, truncated normal regression including prior visit data. Longitudinal associations were estimated using linear mixed models of imputed underlying BP for simulated treated and measured BP for untreated participants. Method 3 was the best-performing for systolic BP; lowest relative bias (5.3% for intercept at age 50, 0% for age coefficient) and average deviation from expected (0.04 to -1.79). Method 2 performed best for diastolic BP; lowest relative bias (0.6% intercept at age 50, 33.3% age <60, 9.1% age 60+) and average deviation (-1.25 to -1.68). Methods 4 and 5 were comparable or slightly inferior. In conclusion, constant addition methods yielded valid and precise underlying BP and longitudinal associations."

Using new approaches to 3D imaging and morphometric analysis, we here quantify bifacial asymmetry among early North American projectile point styles to better understand changes in knapping technique and cultural transmission. Using a sample of 100 fluted bifaces of Clovis and post-Clovis styles in the eastern United States ca. 13,100–9,000 cal BP (i.e., Clovis, Debert-Vail, Bull Brook, Michaud-Neponset/Barnes, and Crowfield), we employed two different approaches for statistical shape analysis: our previously presented method for analysis of 2D flake scar contours, and a new approach for 3D surface analysis using spherical harmonics (SPHARM). Whereas bifacial asymmetry in point shape does not vary significantly across this stylistic sequence, our measure of asymmetric flake scar patterning shows temporal variation that may signify the beginning of regionalization among early New World colonists."
https://openalex.org/W2735900176,"The homotrimeric HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env) undergoes receptor-triggered structural changes that mediate viral entry through membrane fusion. This process is inhibited by chemokine receptor antagonists (CoRAs) that block Env–receptor interactions and by fusion inhibitors (FIs) that disrupt Env conformational transitions. Synergy between CoRAs and FIs has been attributed to a CoRA-dependent decrease in the rate of viral membrane fusion that extends the lifetime of the intermediate state targeted by FIs. Here, we demonstrated that the magnitude of CoRA/FI synergy unexpectedly depends on FI-binding affinity and the stoichiometry of chemokine receptor binding to trimeric Env. For C-peptide FIs (clinically represented by enfuvirtide), synergy waned as binding strength decreased until inhibitor combinations behaved additively. Curiously, this affinity dependence on synergy was absent for 5-Helix-type FIs. We linked this complex behavior to the CoRA dependence of Env deactivation following FI binding. For both FI classes, reducing chemokine receptor levels on target cells or eliminating competent chemokine receptor-binding sites on Env trimers resulted in a loss of synergistic activity. These data imply that the stoichiometry required for CoRA/FI synergy exceeds that required for HIV-1 entry. Our analysis suggests two distinct roles for chemokine receptor binding, one to trigger formation of the FI-sensitive intermediate state and another to facilitate subsequent conformational transitions. Together, our results could explain the wide variety of previously reported activities for CoRA/FI combinations.

This contribution reports new data describing the prenatal enamel development of 18 central deciduous incisors from the Imperial Roman necropolis of Velia (I-II century CE, Salerno, Italy). Histomorphometrical analysis was performed to collect data on prenatal crown formation times, daily secretion rates and enamel extension rates. Results for the Velia sample allowed us to derive a new regression formula, using a robust statistical approach, that describes the average rates of deciduous enamel formation. This can now be used as a reference for pre-industrial populations. The same regression formula, even when daily incremental markings are difficult to visualize, may provide a clue to predicting the proportion of infants born full term and pre-term in an archaeological series."

https://openalex.org/W2735412146,"As parasites coevolve with their hosts, they can evolve counter-defenses that render host immune responses ineffective. These counter-defenses are more likely to evolve in specialist parasites than generalist parasites; the latter face variable selection pressures between the different hosts they infect. Natural populations of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster are commonly threatened by endoparasitoid wasps in the genus Leptopilina, including the specialist L. boulardi and the generalist L. heterotoma, and both wasp species can incapacitate the cellular immune response of D. melanogaster larvae. Given that ethanol tolerance is high in D. melanogaster and stronger in the specialist wasp than the generalist, we tested whether fly larvae could use ethanol as an anti-parasite defense and whether its effectiveness would differ against the two wasp species. We found that fly larvae benefited from eating ethanol-containing food during exposure to L. heterotoma; we observed a two-fold decrease in parasitization intensity and a 24-fold increase in fly survival to adulthood. Although host ethanol consumption did not affect L. boulardi parasitization rates or intensities, it led to a modest increase in fly survival. Thus, ethanol conferred stronger protection against the generalist wasp than the specialist. We tested whether fly larvae can self-medicate by seeking ethanol-containing food after being attacked by wasps, but found no support for this hypothesis. We also allowed female flies to choose between control and ethanol-containing oviposition sites in the presence vs. absence of wasps and generally found significant preferences for ethanol regardless of wasp presence. Overall, our results suggest that D. melanogaster larvae obtain protection from certain parasitoid wasp species through their mothers’ innate oviposition preferences for ethanol-containing food sources."

The aim of this study was to observe the long-term outcomes of endoscopic bile duct stone extraction for naïve major duodenal papilla and to assess the predictors for recurrence. Methods This was a retrospective cohort study that consisted of 384 patients with naïve papilla who underwent initial endoscopic bile duct stone extraction. Patients were followed up in outpatient department subsequent to complete stone clearance. Recurrence was defined as symptomatic repeated stone formation observed at least three months after the procedure. Stone recurrence, predictors of recurrence, and the recurrence rate, depending on each endoscopic treatment for major duodenal papilla, were examined. Results In this study, 34 patients (8.9%) developed stone recurrence. The median time to recurrence was 439 days. Periampullary diverticulum and multiple stones were strong predictors of bile duct stone recurrence (RR, 5.065; 95% CI, 2.435–10.539 and RR: 2.4401; 95% CI: 1.0946–5.4396, respectively). The above two factors were independent predictors of stone recurrence as per logistic regression analysis adjusted for confounders (Periampullary diverticulum: OR, 7.768; 95% CI, 3.27–18.471; multiple stones: OR, 4.144; 95% CI, 1.33–12.915). No recurrence was observed after endoscopic papillary large balloon dilatation (0/20), whereas recurrence was observed in 7 patients after endoscopic papillary balloon dilatation (7/45) and in 27 patients after endoscopic sphincterotomy (27/319). However, these differences were not statistically significant (p = 0.105). Conclusions We determined that the presence of periampullary diverticulum and multiple stones are strong predictors for recurrence after endoscopic stone extraction. Moreover, endoscopic papillary large balloon dilatation tended to be correlated with non-recurrence of bile duct stone."

They also frequently lead complete training sessions delivering physical examination skills without the aid of faculty teaching staff–acting as “patient instructors” (PIs). An important part of this training is their ability to provide detailed structured feedback to students which has a strong impact on their learning success. Yet, to date no study has assessed the quality of physical examination related feedback by PIs. Therefore, we conducted a randomized controlled study comparing feedback of PIs and faculty staff following a physical examination assessed by students and video assessors. Methods 14 PIs and 14 different faculty staff physicians both delivered feedback to 40 medical students that had performed a physical examination on the respective PI while the physicians observed the performance. The physical examination was rated by two independent video assessors to provide an objective performance standard (gold standard). Feedback of PI and physicians was content analyzed by two different independent video assessors based on a provided checklist and compared to the performance standard. Feedback of PIs and physicians was also rated by medical students and video assessors using a questionnaire consisting of 12 items. Results There was no statistical significant difference concerning overall matching of physician or PI feedback with gold standard ratings by video assessment (p = .219). There was also no statistical difference when focusing only on items that were classified as major key steps (p = .802), mistakes or parts that were left out during physical examination (p = .219) or mistakes in communication items (p = .517). The feedback of physicians was significantly better rated than PI feedback both by students (p = .043) as well as by video assessors (p = .034). Conclusions In summary, our study demonstrates that trained PIs are able to provide feedback of equal quantitative value to that of faculty staff physicians with regard to a physical examination performed on them. However, both the students and the video raters judged the quality of the feedback given by the physicians to be significantly better than that of the PIs."

Kinetochores assemble at the centromeric region of chromosomes as a multiprotein complex. However, the molecular mechanisms of kinetochore assembly have not yet been fully elucidated. In this study, we identified pleckstrin homology domain and leucine-rich repeat protein phosphatase 1 (PHLPP1) as a regulatory phosphatase that facilitates proper kinetochore assembly. We found that PHLPP1 interacted with the essential outer-kinetochore protein SGT1 and stabilized its protein levels. Loss of PHLPP1 from cells led to SGT1 degradation and thereby caused defective kinetochore assembly. We also found that the ring finger protein 41 (RNF41) as an E3 ligase ubiquitinated and degraded SGT1 in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. PHLPP1 dephosphorylated SGT1 at four conserved residues (Ser-17, Ser-249, Ser-289, and Thr-233) and thereby prevented SGT1 from associating with RNF41, in turn, countering SGT1 degradation. Importantly, depletion of RNF41 or expression of a non-phosphorylatable SGT1 mutant rescued the kinetochore defects caused by the loss of PHLPP1. Taken together, our results suggest that PHLPP1 plays an important role in the assembly of kinetochores by counteracting RNF41-mediated SGT1 degradation."

This work aimed to identify factors and processes that influence the formation and spatial distribution of the mounds, which are commonly associated with termite activity. In order to characterize pedological processes, macro and micro morphological descriptions, satellite image interpretation, dating of the sandy sedimentary material using OSL and carbon dating using 14C AMS were carried out. This dating of the materials indicates that the sediments in which the soils were formed were deposited during the Pleistocene, while the carbonates are from the Holocene. The basin-like format of the laminar structures suggests that part of the more clayey material was deposited in lacustrine environments. The more humid climate in the Holocene intensified argilluviation, which at an advanced stage, led to a more pronounced textural gradient, reducing drainage and leading to ferrolysis and thickening of the E horizon. Besides pedogenic processes, more erosive flooding during the Holocene began reducing and rounding the landscape’s more elevated structures (paleolevees). In the final stage, these structures were occupied by termites to shelter from flooding. Thereafter, the bio-cementation action of the termite nests has increased the resistance of the vegetated mounds to processes of erosion."

In addition to thyA, Bacillus subtilis possesses thyB, whose expression occurs under conditions of cell stress; therefore, we generated a thyB- thyA+ mutant strain. Tmpr colonies of this strain were produced with a spontaneous mutation frequency of ~1.4 × 10-9. Genetic disruption of the canonical mismatch (MMR) and guanine oxidized (GO) repair pathways increased the Tmpr frequency of mutation by ~2-3 orders of magnitude. A wide spectrum of base substitutions as well as insertion and deletions in the ORF of thyA were found to confer a Tmpr phenotype. Stationary-phase-associated mutagenesis (SPM) assays revealed that colonies with a Tmpr phenotype, accumulated over a period of ten days with a frequency of ~ 60 ×10-7. The Tmpr system was further modified to study TMM by constructing a ΔthyA ΔthyB strain carrying an IPTG-inducible Pspac-thyA cassette. In conditions of transcriptional induction of thyA, the generation of Tmpr colonies increased ~3-fold compared to conditions of transcriptional repression. Further, the Mfd and GreA factors were necessary for the generation of Tmpr colonies in the presence of IPTG in B. subtilis. Because GreA and Mfd facilitate transcription-coupled repair, our results suggest that TMM is a mechanim to produce genetic diversity in highly transcribed regions in growth-limited B. subtilis cells."
