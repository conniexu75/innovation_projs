https://openalex.org/W2787902098,"Human gut microbiome composition is shaped by multiple factors but the relative contribution of host genetics remains elusive. Here we examine genotype and microbiome data from 1,046 healthy individuals with several distinct ancestral origins who share a relatively common environment, and demonstrate that the gut microbiome is not significantly associated with genetic ancestry, and that host genetics have a minor role in determining microbiome composition. We show that, by contrast, there are significant similarities in the compositions of the microbiomes of genetically unrelated individuals who share a household, and that over 20% of the inter-person microbiome variability is associated with factors related to diet, drugs and anthropometric measurements. We further demonstrate that microbiome data significantly improve the prediction accuracy for many human traits, such as glucose and obesity measures, compared to models that use only host genetic and environmental data. These results suggest that microbiome alterations aimed at improving clinical outcomes may be carried out across diverse genetic backgrounds."
https://openalex.org/W2789869568,"Abstract Pan-cancer analyses that examine commonalities and differences among various cancer types have emerged as a powerful way to obtain novel insights into cancer biology. Here we present a comprehensive analysis of genetic alterations in a pan-cancer cohort including 961 tumours from children, adolescents, and young adults, comprising 24 distinct molecular types of cancer. Using a standardized workflow, we identified marked differences in terms of mutation frequency and significantly mutated genes in comparison to previously analysed adult cancers. Genetic alterations in 149 putative cancer driver genes separate the tumours into two classes: small mutation and structural/copy-number variant (correlating with germline variants). Structural variants, hyperdiploidy, and chromothripsis are linked to TP53 mutation status and mutational signatures. Our data suggest that 7–8% of the children in this cohort carry an unambiguous predisposing germline variant and that nearly 50% of paediatric neoplasms harbour a potentially druggable event, which is highly relevant for the design of future clinical trials."
https://openalex.org/W2789924919,"Analysis of molecular aberrations across multiple cancer types, known as pan-cancer analysis, identifies commonalities and differences in key biological processes that are dysregulated in cancer cells from diverse lineages. Pan-cancer analyses have been performed for adult but not paediatric cancers, which commonly occur in developing mesodermic rather than adult epithelial tissues. Here we present a pan-cancer study of somatic alterations, including single nucleotide variants, small insertions or deletions, structural variations, copy number alterations, gene fusions and internal tandem duplications in 1,699 paediatric leukaemias and solid tumours across six histotypes, with whole-genome, whole-exome and transcriptome sequencing data processed under a uniform analytical framework. We report 142 driver genes in paediatric cancers, of which only 45% match those found in adult pan-cancer studies; copy number alterations and structural variants constituted the majority (62%) of events. Eleven genome-wide mutational signatures were identified, including one attributed to ultraviolet-light exposure in eight aneuploid leukaemias. Transcription of the mutant allele was detectable for 34% of protein-coding mutations, and 20% exhibited allele-specific expression. These data provide a comprehensive genomic architecture for paediatric cancers and emphasize the need for paediatric cancer-specific development of precision therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2788439692,"Functional tissue regeneration is required for the restoration of normal organ homeostasis after severe injury. Some organs, such as the intestine, harbour active stem cells throughout homeostasis and regeneration; more quiescent organs, such as the lung, often contain facultative progenitor cells that are recruited after injury to participate in regeneration. Here we show that a Wnt-responsive alveolar epithelial progenitor (AEP) lineage within the alveolar type 2 cell population acts as a major facultative progenitor cell in the distal lung. AEPs are a stable lineage during alveolar homeostasis but expand rapidly to regenerate a large proportion of the alveolar epithelium after acute lung injury. AEPs exhibit a distinct transcriptome, epigenome and functional phenotype and respond specifically to Wnt and Fgf signalling. In contrast to other proposed lung progenitor cells, human AEPs can be directly isolated by expression of the conserved cell surface marker TM4SF1, and act as functional human alveolar epithelial progenitor cells in 3D organoids. Our results identify the AEP lineage as an evolutionarily conserved alveolar progenitor that represents a new target for human lung regeneration strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2792403811,"We developed a new way to engineer complex proteins toward multidimensional specifications using a simple, yet scalable, directed evolution strategy. By robotically picking mammalian cells that were identified, under a microscope, as expressing proteins that simultaneously exhibit several specific properties, we can screen hundreds of thousands of proteins in a library in just a few hours, evaluating each along multiple performance axes. To demonstrate the power of this approach, we created a genetically encoded fluorescent voltage indicator, simultaneously optimizing its brightness and membrane localization using our microscopy-guided cell-picking strategy. We produced the high-performance opsin-based fluorescent voltage reporter Archon1 and demonstrated its utility by imaging spiking and millivolt-scale subthreshold and synaptic activity in acute mouse brain slices and in larval zebrafish in vivo. We also measured postsynaptic responses downstream of optogenetically controlled neurons in C. elegans."
https://openalex.org/W2788604588,"The TGFβ pathway has essential roles in embryonic development, organ homeostasis, tissue repair and disease. These diverse effects are mediated through the intracellular effectors SMAD2 and SMAD3 (hereafter SMAD2/3), whose canonical function is to control the activity of target genes by interacting with transcriptional regulators. Therefore, a complete description of the factors that interact with SMAD2/3 in a given cell type would have broad implications for many areas of cell biology. Here we describe the interactome of SMAD2/3 in human pluripotent stem cells. This analysis reveals that SMAD2/3 is involved in multiple molecular processes in addition to its role in transcription. In particular, we identify a functional interaction with the METTL3-METTL14-WTAP complex, which mediates the conversion of adenosine to N6-methyladenosine (m6A) on RNA. We show that SMAD2/3 promotes binding of the m6A methyltransferase complex to a subset of transcripts involved in early cell fate decisions. This mechanism destabilizes specific SMAD2/3 transcriptional targets, including the pluripotency factor gene NANOG, priming them for rapid downregulation upon differentiation to enable timely exit from pluripotency. Collectively, these findings reveal the mechanism by which extracellular signalling can induce rapid cellular responses through regulation of the epitranscriptome. These aspects of TGFβ signalling could have far-reaching implications in many other cell types and in diseases such as cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2787975097,"In vitro experiments, using purified proteins and an assay that detects DNA unwinding, reveal the mechanism of activation of eukaryotic DNA replication. DNA replication in eukaryotes begins with the loading of a double hexamer of minichromosome maintenance (MCM) proteins onto the origin. Replication is then activated by separating the double hexamer into single-hexamer MCM rings that, together with Cdc45 and GINS, make up the CMG helicase, which is required for DNA unwinding. John Diffley and colleagues describe the role of ATP hydrolysis in regulating double-hexamer assembly and then CMG formation. Notably, there is an inactive CMG state that precedes the helicase-active CMG form that can translocate along the unwound DNA strand. The active CMG moves unidirectionally so that the two helicases pass by each other to establish bidirectional replication. The initiation of eukaryotic DNA replication occurs in two discrete stages1: first, the minichromosome maintenance (MCM) complex assembles as a head-to-head double hexamer that encircles duplex replication origin DNA during G1 phase; then, ‘firing factors’ convert each double hexamer into two active Cdc45–MCM–GINS helicases (CMG) during S phase. This second stage requires separation of the two origin DNA strands and remodelling of the double hexamer so that each MCM hexamer encircles a single DNA strand. Here we show that the MCM complex, which hydrolyses ATP during double-hexamer formation2,3, remains stably bound to ADP in the double hexamer. Firing factors trigger ADP release, and subsequent ATP binding promotes stable CMG assembly. CMG assembly is accompanied by initial DNA untwisting and separation of the double hexamer into two discrete but inactive CMG helicases. Mcm10, together with ATP hydrolysis, then triggers further DNA untwisting and helicase activation. After activation, the two CMG helicases translocate in an ‘N terminus-first’ direction, and in doing so pass each other within the origin; this requires that each helicase is bound entirely to single-stranded DNA. Our experiments elucidate the mechanism of eukaryotic replicative helicase activation, which we propose provides a fail-safe mechanism for bidirectional replisome establishment."
https://openalex.org/W2789607808,"The C-type lectin receptor MelLec recognizes DHN-melanin in conidial spores of Aspergillus fumigatus and other DHN-melanized fungi, revealing an important role for this receptor in antifungal immunity in both mice and humans. Defence against fungal pathogens in mammals relies on pattern recognition receptors, which are often activated by pathogen virulence factors. One such factor is melanin, a component of the fungal cell wall. Gordon Brown and colleagues identify the melanin-sensing C-type lectin receptor (MelLec) as an endothelial cell receptor for fungal melanin. Activation of this receptor triggers a protective inflammatory response against infection by Aspergillus fungi in mice and humans. MelLec thereby has an important role in host defence against disseminated Aspergillosis. Resistance to infection is critically dependent on the ability of pattern recognition receptors to recognize microbial invasion and induce protective immune responses. One such family of receptors are the C-type lectins, which are central to antifungal immunity1. These receptors activate key effector mechanisms upon recognition of conserved fungal cell-wall carbohydrates. However, several other immunologically active fungal ligands have been described; these include melanin2,3, for which the mechanism of recognition is hitherto undefined. Here we identify a C-type lectin receptor, melanin-sensing C-type lectin receptor (MelLec), that has an essential role in antifungal immunity through recognition of the naphthalene-diol unit of 1,8-dihydroxynaphthalene (DHN)-melanin. MelLec recognizes melanin in conidial spores of Aspergillus fumigatus as well as in other DHN-melanized fungi. MelLec is ubiquitously expressed by CD31+ endothelial cells in mice, and is also expressed by a sub-population of these cells that co-express epithelial cell adhesion molecule and are detected only in the lung and the liver. In mouse models, MelLec was required for protection against disseminated infection with A. fumigatus. In humans, MelLec is also expressed by myeloid cells, and we identified a single nucleotide polymorphism of this receptor that negatively affected myeloid inflammatory responses and significantly increased the susceptibility of stem-cell transplant recipients to disseminated Aspergillus infections. MelLec therefore recognizes an immunologically active component commonly found on fungi and has an essential role in protective antifungal immunity in both mice and humans."
https://openalex.org/W2952487041,"The variable responses of sensory neurons tend to be weakly correlated (spike-count correlation, rsc). This is widely thought to reflect noise in shared afferents, in which case rsc can limit the reliability of sensory coding. However, it could also be due to feedback from higher-order brain regions. Currently, the relative contributions of these sources are unknown. We addressed this by recording from populations of V1 neurons in macaques performing different discrimination tasks involving the same visual input. We found that the structure of rsc (the way rsc varied with neuronal stimulus preference) changed systematically with task instruction. Therefore, even at the earliest stage in the cortical visual hierarchy, rsc structure during task performance primarily reflects feedback dynamics. Consequently, previous proposals for how rsc constrains sensory processing need not apply. Furthermore, we show that correlations between the activity of single neurons and choice depend on feedback engaged by the task. The way spike count variability is correlated between two neurons depends on the neurons' stimulus preferences. Here the authors show that this dependency itself varies systematically with behavioral task, implying a feedback origin of correlations."
https://openalex.org/W2791154320,"Ten-eleven translocation (TET) proteins play key roles in the regulation of DNA-methylation status by oxidizing 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to generate 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), which can both serve as a stable epigenetic mark and participate in active demethylation. Unlike the other members of the TET family, TET2 does not contain a DNA-binding domain, and it remains unclear how it is recruited to chromatin. Here we show that TET2 is recruited by the RNA-binding protein Paraspeckle component 1 (PSPC1) through transcriptionally active loci, including endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) whose long terminal repeats (LTRs) have been co-opted by mammalian genomes as stage- and tissue-specific transcriptional regulatory modules. We found that PSPC1 and TET2 contribute to ERVL and ERVL-associated gene regulation by both transcriptional repression via histone deacetylases and post-transcriptional destabilization of RNAs through 5hmC modification. Our findings provide evidence for a functional role of transcriptionally active ERVs as specific docking sites for RNA epigenetic modulation and gene regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2793800590,"Neural circuits for appetites are regulated by both homeostatic perturbations and ingestive behaviour. However, the circuit organization that integrates these internal and external stimuli is unclear. Here we show in mice that excitatory neural populations in the lamina terminalis form a hierarchical circuit architecture to regulate thirst. Among them, nitric oxide synthase-expressing neurons in the median preoptic nucleus (MnPO) are essential for the integration of signals from the thirst-driving neurons of the subfornical organ (SFO). Conversely, a distinct inhibitory circuit, involving MnPO GABAergic neurons that express glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor (GLP1R), is activated immediately upon drinking and monosynaptically inhibits SFO thirst neurons. These responses are induced by the ingestion of fluids but not solids, and are time-locked to the onset and offset of drinking. Furthermore, loss-of-function manipulations of GLP1R-expressing MnPO neurons lead to a polydipsic, overdrinking phenotype. These neurons therefore facilitate rapid satiety of thirst by monitoring real-time fluid ingestion. Our study reveals dynamic thirst circuits that integrate the homeostatic-instinctive requirement for fluids and the consequent drinking behaviour to maintain internal water balance."
https://openalex.org/W2790063341,"The complex skills underlying verbal and musical expression can be learned without external punishment or reward, indicating their learning is internally guided. The neural mechanisms that mediate internally guided learning are poorly understood, but a circuit comprising dopamine-releasing neurons in the midbrain ventral tegmental area (VTA) and their targets in the basal ganglia are important to externally reinforced learning. Juvenile zebra finches copy a tutor song in a process that is internally guided and, in adulthood, can learn to modify the fundamental frequency (pitch) of a target syllable in response to external reinforcement with white noise. Here we combined intersectional genetic ablation of VTA neurons, reversible blockade of dopamine receptors in the basal ganglia, and singing-triggered optogenetic stimulation of VTA terminals to establish that a common VTA-basal ganglia circuit enables internally guided song copying and externally reinforced syllable pitch learning."

Dysregulation of the epithelial cell barrier coincides with profound shifts in metabolic energy, especially in the colon, which exists in an energetically depleting state of physiological hypoxia. However, studies that systematically examine energy flux and adenylate metabolism during intestinal epithelial barrier development and restoration after disruption are lacking. Here, to delineate barrier-related energy flux, we developed an HPLC-based profiling method to track changes in energy flux and adenylate metabolites during barrier development and restoration.

EDTA-induced epithelial barrier disruption revealed that hypoxanthine levels correlated with barrier resistance. Further studies uncovered that hypoxanthine supplementation improves barrier function and wound healing and that hypoxanthine appears to do so by increasing intracellular ATP, which improved cytoskeletal G- to F-actin polymerization. Hypoxanthine supplementation increased the adenylate energy charge in the murine colon, indicating potential to regulate adenylate energy charge–mediated metabolism in intestinal epithelial cells. Moreover, experiments in a murine colitis model disclosed that hypoxanthine loss during active inflammation correlates with markers of disease severity.

Selective permeability of the polarized, intact epithelium is mediated by specialized intercellular junctions termed the apical junctional complex (AJC), comprising the tight junction and adjacent adherens junction (1Capaldo C.T. Nusrat A. Claudin switching: physiological plasticity of the tight junction.Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2015; 42 (25957515): 22-2910.1016/j.semcdb.2015.04.003Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The AJC is supported by a highly cross-linked actin cytoskeleton built from an extensive network of F-actin bundles associating with tight junctions and a dense circumferential ring of actin and myosin contiguous with adherens junctions (2Hirokawa N.

Tissues lined by epithelial cells are supplied by a rich and complex vasculature. The gastrointestinal tract, for example, adapts to profound fluctuations in blood perfusion on a daily basis (4Colgan S.P. Taylor C.T. Hypoxia: an alarm signal during intestinal inflammation.Nat.

Areas of a healthy gastrointestinal mucosa withstand pO2 levels approaching anoxia, existing in a homeostatic state termed “physiologic hypoxia” (5Karhausen J. Haase V.H. Colgan S.P.

Analysis of oxygen exchange within the intestine revealed that arterial blood-derived O2 diffuses across the villus to parallel venules, resulting in graded hypoxia as the oxygen emanating from the submucosa depletes as it traverses toward the anaerobic lumen (6Shepherd A.P. Metabolic control of intestinal oxygenation and blood flow.Fed. Proc. 1982; 41 (7075783): 2084-2089PubMed Google Scholar). Colonic epithelia endure the hypoxic end of the O2 gradient, existing in one of the more austere microenvironments found in mammals (7Albenberg L. Esipova T.V. Judge C.P. Bittinger K. Chen J.

In this environment, small perturbations in blood flow can result in relatively large decreases in O2 delivery and resultant ischemia/hypoxia, which can be particularly profound during injury. The high-energy demands of the mucosa and fundamental need of barrier function for intestinal homeostasis have driven the evolution of a number of mechanisms to cope with this energetically depleting, low-oxygen state (8Colgan S.P. Campbell E.L. Kominsky D.J. Hypoxia and mucosal inflammation.Annu. Rev. Pathol. 2016; 11 (27193451): 77-10010.1146/annurev-pathol-012615-044231Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Barrier dysregulation in a variety of disease states is accompanied by profound shifts in metabolic energy. We previously identified a family of genes involved in creatine metabolism that are coordinately regulated by the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) (9Glover L.E. Bowers B.E. Saeedi B. Ehrentraut S.F. Campbell E.L. Bayless A.J. Dobrinskikh E. Kendrick A.A. Kelly C.J. Burgess A. Miller L. Kominsky D.J. Jedlicka P. Colgan S.P.

Subcellular localization of creatine kinase (CK) isoforms revealed coupling to the AJC, with CK inhibition attenuating junctional assembly and barrier function. Despite these observations, studies that systematically examine energy flux and adenylate metabolism during intestinal epithelial barrier development and restoration after disruption are lacking. To delineate barrier-related adenylate energy flux, we developed an HPLC-based profiling method to characterize changes in high-energy phosphates and associated adenylate metabolites. We identified an ability in IECs to maintain ATP and pool phosphocreatine during barrier development that associated with the accumulation of downstream adenylate metabolites. Extensions of these studies with models of barrier stress identified a capacity for hypoxanthine (Hpx) to promote epithelial cellular function through improving cellular energetics and cytoskeletal capability. An unbiased metabolomic screen in murine colon tissue identified a loss of Hpx during active inflammation, which correlated with indicators of disease severity, suggesting that Hpx may also serve as an in vivo biomarker of barrier function. The work contained herein identifies Hpx as a central metabolite in IEC function. Our recent studies revealed that barrier function is tightly linked to creatine (Cr) and phosphocreatine (PCr) metabolism, where a loss of functional CK attenuated barrier development and restitution (9Glover L.E. Bowers B.E. Saeedi B. Ehrentraut S.F. Campbell E.L. Bayless A.J. Dobrinskikh E. Kendrick A.A. Kelly C.J. Burgess A. Miller L. Kominsky D.J. Jedlicka P. Colgan S.P.

For this reason, we broadened our analysis of adenylate energy metabolites during IEC barrier formation. An extraction protocol and HPLC-based analytical method was developed to quantitate Cr, PCr, and 10 adenylate energy-related metabolites (Fig. 1). Using this protocol, adenylate metabolites were profiled during barrier formation in T84 cells. As barrier resistance increased, Cr and PCr accumulated (∼1300 and 500 μm, respectively), indicating that stored energy capacity rises in conjunction with barrier (Figs. 2, A and B). Early in the barrier formation process (transepithelial resistance <25% of maximum), ATP and xanthine (Xan) levels equilibrate (∼25 and 7.5 μm, respectively), whereas inosine (Ino) and hypoxanthine (Hpx) equilibrate later (transepithelial resistance >85% of maximum) to ∼2 and 1 μm, respectively (Fig. 2B). ADP was observed at <1 μm throughout barrier formation, whereas low (<500 nm) to undetectable levels of AMP, IMP, adenosine (Ado), adenine (Ad), and uric acid (UA) were observed (Fig. 2C).Figure 2Quantification of T84 cell metabolite extracts during barrier development.

Furuta G.T. Comerford K.M. Louis N. Karhausen J. Eltzschig H.K. Hansen K.R. Thompson L.F. Colgan S.P. Ecto-5′-nucleotidase (CD73) regulation by hypoxia-inducible factor-1 mediates permeability changes in intestinal epithelia.J. Clin.

This model utilizes transient divalent cation chelation to disrupt epithelial tight junctions in fully confluent cells. As shown in Fig. 3A, this maneuver results in a >90% loss of measureable barrier that can be restored over time. Significant changes were observed in the creatine pool, with PCr increasing from ∼275 to 500 μm (p = 0.04) and Cr decreasing from ∼1100 to 950 μm (p < 0.03) at points along the experiment (Fig. 3, B and C). To our surprise, this analysis identified an inverse correlation between Hpx and barrier, with Hpx spiking from ∼1 to 3.5 μm (p < 0.004) at the barrier nadir (Fig. 3, B and C). This observation suggests that epithelia have the capacity to rapidly regulate adenylate metabolite pools, with Hpx serving as a marker of such metabolite flux. All other metabolite responses were insignificant or undetectable (Fig. 3D). To extend this observation, T84 cells were supplemented with Hpx (range 0.1–1 mm, 20 h), and a calcium switch assay was performed. Such pre-exposure to Hpx typically increased intracellular Hpx levels up to 100-fold. Functionally, Hpx preloading proved protective of cellular barrier and promoted barrier reformation in a dose-responsive manner (Fig. 3E). Cells supplemented with 300 μm and 1 mm Hpx (p < 0.03) exhibited improved barrier throughout the course of the experiment, indicating that Hpx promotes epithelial barrier restitution following disruption. As an additional model, we examined the influence of Hpx supplementation on T84 cell barrier formation from a subconfluent state. This analysis revealed that Hpx enhances the barrier formation rate (∼1.2-fold based upon time to 50% maximal transepithelial resistance (TER), p < 0.001) and resulted in a monolayer with significantly higher resistance (∼1.2-fold, p < 0.001; Fig. 4A). Parallel studies employed a scratch wound assay to assess the influence of Hpx supplementation on cellular restitution. Hypoxanthine significantly increased epithelial wound closure rate following scratching (∼1.5-fold, p < 0.001; Fig. 4, B and C), revealing a capacity to improve cellular migratory ability. The energy and adenylate metabolite responses of T84 cells to Hpx supplementation were determined next. As shown in Fig. 5A, Hpx was effectively used by the cells as an energetic source, where supplementation significantly increased both PCr from ∼300 to 450 μm (p = 0.01) and ATP from ∼15 to 24 μm (p = 0.03), resulting in an ∼365 to 480 μm increase (p = 0.01) in total available energy (TAE; PCr + ATP + 0.5 × ADP; Fig. 5B). Adenosine diphosphate amounts did not significantly change, whereas the initially low AMP levels abated (p < 0.05). Inosine rose from ∼600 nm to 3 μm (p < 0.001), and xanthine increased from ∼6 to 9 μm (p < 0.001). Intriguingly, UA did not significantly change, indicating that Hpx can function as a purine reservoir. Allopurinol (Allo) is a structural analog of hypoxanthine commonly used to treat gout. The drug is metabolized into oxipurinol by xanthine oxidase (XO), which in turn inhibits XO and decreases UA. Allopurinol was employed here to function as a competitive substrate/inhibitor for hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HGPRT) to assess the contribution of Hpx salvage to the barrier formation process. Supplementation with Allo (1 mm) significantly attenuated T84 cell barrier formation (p < 0.001; Fig. 6A). In subconfluent (restituting) T84 cells treated with Allo (20 h), small increases in Xan and Ino were observed, but to our surprise, Hpx decreased from ∼400 to 250 nm (p < 0.05), whereas Ado increased from trace/undetectable levels to ∼400 nm (p = 0.02; Fig. 6B). An ∼20 to 27 μm (p = 0.03) PCr increase accounted for a corresponding increase in TAE (Fig. 6C). Adenine, IMP, and UA were observed at undetectable to trace levels. Allopurinol can be metabolized into a ribosyl derivative (alloribosyl) that inhibits purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) (11Krenitsky T.A. Elion G.B. Strelitz R.A. Hitchings G.H.

Inhibition of purine nucleoside phosphorylase activity and of T-cell function with allopurinol-riboside.Agents Actions. 1979; 9 (121041): 549-55210.1007/BF01968126Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Indeed, a new peak in the HPLC analyses exclusive to allopurinol-treated samples was observed and has a retention time compatible with what could be expected for alloribosyl (Fig. S1). Purine nucleoside phosphorylase inhibition can account for the lower Hpx and higher Ado and Ino observed in Allo-treated, restituting T84 cells (Fig. 6D). If PNP inhibition is the case, alloribosyl performs the intended purpose of Allo treatment, perhaps in conjunction with competitive HGPRT inhibition, by attenuating adenylate degradation to Hpx and demonstrates the necessity of adenylate flux through the purine salvage pathway(s) for proper cellular function. To examine the impact of Hpx supplementation on epithelial function during physiologically relevant metabolic stress, T84 cells were exposed to hypoxia (1% O2, 40 h) in the presence and absence of 1 mm Hpx, and barrier and adenylate metabolites were monitored. Hypoxia elicited an ∼32% decrease (p < 0.03) in measured barrier in the control cells (Fig. 7A). The hypoxia-induced fall in TER was not only prevented by Hpx supplementation but perhaps even overcompensated to increase overall barrier resistance above control conditions (1.3-fold; Fig. 7A). Hypoxia proved depleting to the creatine pool, with Cr and PCr drastically decreasing from ∼900 to 500 μm (p < 0.001) and from ∼300 to 5 μm (p < 0.001), respectively. Hypoxanthine nearly prevented the hypoxia-induced loss of Cr by increasing levels to ∼800 μm (p < 0.001) while increasing PCr levels to ∼40 μm (p < 0.03). In a similar fashion, hypoxia induced a ∼20 to 15 μm decrease in ATP that was recovered by Hpx supplementation to ∼28 μm (p < 0.001). Hypoxia also increased ADP and AMP from <500 nm to nearly 7 and 2 μm (p < 0.001), respectively, with the increases counteracted by Hpx (p < 0.001), resulting in the normalization of ATP, ADP, and AMP to normoxic levels. Inosine levels rose ∼5-fold to 10 μm (p < 0.002), Hpx rose ∼1.3-fold to 1.6 μm, and Xan rose ∼2-fold to 5 μm (p < 0.008) under hypoxia. Inosine further rose to ∼13 μm and xanthine rose to ∼7.5 μm (p = 0.04) with Hpx supplementation (Fig. 7B). The TAE was detrimentally impacted by hypoxia, dropping from ∼320 to 21 μm (p < 0.001), but showed significant recovery with hypoxanthine to ∼69 μm (p = 0.01; Fig. 7C). Adenine, Ado, IMP, and UA were observed at undetectable to trace levels. In further analyses, we monitored the oxygen consumption of T84 cells in the late restitution/early barrier-forming stage. The medium was found to be quite hypoxic at 1% O2 for control cells. Hypoxanthine-supplemented cells consumed less oxygen, with supplemented medium O2 ranging between 2 and 3% (p < 0.05; Fig. 7D), indicating a capacity for Hpx to alleviate the aerobic respiratory burden of T84 cells. To extend our models of energetic stress, we defined the energy and adenylate metabolic shifts in chemical ATP-depleting conditions. For these purposes, T84 cells were incubated with 2-deoxy-d-glucose (2-DOG; 20 mm, 2 h). Transepithelial resistance did not significantly change over the course of the 2-DOG experiment (Fig. 8A). Cells submitted to 2-DOG produced extracts that exhibited a ∼900 to 1050 μm (p < 0.002) Cr increase, ∼300 to 100 μm (p < 0.003) PCr decrease, ∼20 to 13 μm ATP decrease, slight ADP and AMP increases to <1 μm, ∼2 to 5 μm (p < 0.004) Ino increase, 1.2 to 1.7 μm (p = 0.01) Hpx increase, and small Xan decrease (Fig. 8B). These energy metabolite shifts concomitantly decreased the TAE from ∼320 to 110 μm (p < 0.005; Fig. 8C). Adenine, Ado, IMP, and UA were observed at undetectable to trace levels. Hypoxanthine supplementation did not improve cellular energetics during 2-DOG–induced glycolytic inhibition despite increasing the intracellular Hpx over 40-fold. Instead, decreases in ATP and increases in AMP, Ino, and Xan were observed (Fig. 8B), resulting in no significant improvement of TAE (Fig. 8C). In a separate experiment, the 2-DOG + Hpx results were generally recapitulated in cells treated with 2-DOG + oligomycin A + Hpx (2 μm oligomycin A, 30 min; Fig. S2). To determine the contribution of energy to cytoskeletal activity during barrier restitution in intestinal epithelial cells, subconfluent (restituting) T84 cells were treated with 30 μm phalloidin for 20 h, and their energy metabolites were analyzed (a 30 μm treatment was determined best after an initial experiment screening 0–100 μm treatments). Phalloidin is a phallotoxin that binds and stabilizes filamentous actin (F-actin), halting actin treadmilling activity and thus cellular migratory capability (Fig. 9A) (15Matthews J.B. Awtrey C.S. Madara J.L. Microfilament-dependent activation of Na+/K+/2Cl-cotransport by cAMP in intestinal epithelial monolayers.J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90 (1328303): 1608-161310.1172/JCI116030Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Phalloidin-treated cells showed significant increases in both PCr and ATP (Fig. 9B), resulting in a TAE increase from ∼28 to 34 μm (p < 0.02; Fig. 9C). From these data, we estimate that the epithelial cells commit 19 ± 1% of TAE to actin-based activity during restitution. This estimate approximates previous findings where vascular endothelial cells commit 18% of energy to actomyosin ATPase activity (16Culic O. Gruwel M.L. Schrader J. Energy turnover of vascular endothelial cells.Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273 (9252458): C205-C21310.1152/ajpcell.1997.273.1.C205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Restituting cells supplemented with hypoxanthine doubled their Cr to ∼30 μm (p = 0.02) but displayed only moderate increases in PCr and ATP and in turn an equally moderate increase in TAE (Fig. 9, D and E). This modest hypoxanthine-derived energetic benefit is a remnant of the actual benefit, which was utilized to polymerize G-actin into F-actin, as indicated by a 0.68 to 0.96 (p < 0.04) increase in the cellular F- to G-actin ratio (Fig. 9F). We further extended our in vitro observations to the in vivo setting. Initially, we profiled adenylate metabolites in wildtype C57Bl/6 murine colonic tissue (Fig. 10A). This analysis revealed a surprisingly broad distribution of adenylate and energy metabolites at baseline. For example, adenine and adenosine exhibit concentrations <1 nmol/g, whereas basal Cr and PCr levels exceed 1 μmol/g. Moreover, ATP, ADP, AMP levels exist at nearly equimolar concentrations at baseline. To define the influence of Hpx in vivo, we compared murine colonic energy and adenylate metabolites with and without Hpx supplementation (1 mm Hpx in drinking water for 2 weeks). This analysis revealed a capacity for Hpx (∼1.2-fold increase) to significantly modulate relative [ATP], [ADP], and [AMP] in a manner similar to that observed in T84 cells. Specifically, Hpx induced an ∼80 to 125 nmol/g (p < 0.001) ATP increase, ∼60 to 25 nmol/g ADP decrease, and ∼65 to 40 nmol/g (p = 0.02) AMP decrease. Also of note were ∼0.6 to 1.2 nmol/g (p < 0.05) Ado and ∼175 to 385 nmol/g (p < 0.03) IMP increases (Fig. 10A). Hypoxanthine supplementation did not significantly alter the TAE in the tissue (Fig. 10B) but did increase the adenylate energy charge (AEC; (ATP + 0.5 × ADP)/(ATP + ADP + AMP)) from ∼0.52 to 0.73 (p = 0.008). The relative concentrations of the adenine phosphate pool ([ATP], [ADP], and [AMP]) operate to allosterically control many regulatory enzymes, notably the AEC-controlled AMPK (17Oakhill J.S. Steel R. Chen Z.-P. Scott J.W. Ling N. Tam S. Kemp B.E. AMPK is a direct adenylate charge-regulated protein kinase.Science. 2011; 332 (21680840): 1433-143510.1126/science.1200094Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 18Sun X. Zhu M.-J.

Given the prominent role of Hpx in epithelial energetics and barrier function in vitro, we tracked the impact of a mucosal disease model on Hpx levels in the colon in vivo. For these purposes, we utilized the dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) colitis model of acute inflammation. An unbiased metabolomic analysis of tissue extracts from healthy and DSS colitic murine colons (19Lanis J.M. Alexeev E.E. Curtis V.F. Kitzenberg D.A. Kao D.J. Battista K.D. Gerich M.E. Glover L.E. Kominsky D.J. Colgan S.P. Tryptophan metabolite activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor regulates IL10 receptor expression on intestinal epithelia.Mucosal Immunol. 2017; 10 (28098246): 1133-114410.1038/mi.2016.133Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) revealed a >65% decrease in Hpx (p < 0.001) in colitic mice during active inflammation, including a loss of crypt architecture and infiltration of large numbers of leukocytes (Fig. 11, A and B). Importantly, among the colitic animals, the DSS-associated Hpx loss strongly correlated with disease markers, such as decreased colon length (p < 0.01) and increased weight loss (p < 0.01; Fig. 11B). Taken together, these results identify Hpx as a potential biomarker for intestinal disease severity. Adenine nucleotides are connected to every sequence in a living cell. A functional metabolism relies upon regulating energy deposit and energy withdrawal rates, as unchecked shifts in relative ATP, ADP, and AMP amounts inevitably disrupt the rates of all metabolic reactions, impeding cellular function (20Atkinson D.E. Adenylate control and the adenylate energy charge.in: Cellular Energy Metabolism and its Regulation. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1977: 85-107Crossref Google Scholar). Perhaps unsurprisingly, original studies using ATP depletion models revealed an important role for high-energy phosphates in the regulation of barrier function (21Bacallao R. Garginkel A. Monke S.

We randomly studied nine healthy human subjects twice-with and without continuous infusion of 3-hydroxybutyrate-to define potential underlying mechanisms, assessed regionally (parietal, occipital, temporal, cortical grey, and frontal) by PET scan. During 3-hydroxybutyrate infusions concentrations increased to 5.5±0.4 mmol/l and cerebral glucose utilisation decreased 14%, oxygen consumption remained unchanged, and cerebral blood flow increased 30%. We conclude that acute 3-hydroxybutyrate infusion reduces cerebral glucose uptake and increases cerebral blood flow in all measured brain regions, without detectable effects on cerebral oxygen uptake though oxygen extraction decreased. Increased oxygen supply concomitant with unchanged oxygen utilisation may contribute to the neuroprotective effects of ketone bodies."

Targeted therapies and immunotherapy have improved the survival of patients with metastatic melanoma in the last few years; however, available treatments are still unsatisfactory. While the role of the BRAF-MEK1/2-ERK1/2 pathway in melanoma is well established, the involvement of mitogen-activated protein kinases MEK5-ERK5 remains poorly explored. Here we investigated the function of ERK5 signaling in melanoma. We show that ERK5 is consistently expressed in human melanoma tissues and is active in melanoma cells. Genetic silencing and pharmacological inhibition of ERK5 pathway drastically reduce the growth of melanoma cells and xenografts harboring wild-type (wt) or mutated BRAF (V600E). We also found that oncogenic BRAF positively regulates expression, phosphorylation, and nuclear localization of ERK5. Importantly, ERK5 kinase and transcriptional transactivator activities are enhanced by BRAF. Nevertheless, combined pharmacological inhibition of BRAFV600E and MEK5 is required to decrease nuclear ERK5, that is critical for the regulation of cell proliferation. Accordingly, combination of MEK5 or ERK5 inhibitors with BRAFV600E inhibitor vemurafenib is more effective than single treatments in reducing colony formation and growth of BRAFV600E melanoma cells and xenografts. Overall, these data support a key role of the ERK5 pathway for melanoma growth in vitro and in vivo and suggest that targeting ERK5, alone or in combination with BRAF-MEK1/2 inhibitors, might represent a novel approach for melanoma treatment."

ACCESS proved more effective compared to standard care (ACCESS-I study) and was successfully implemented into clinical routine (ACCESS-II study). In this article, we report the 4-year outcomes of the ACCESS-II study. Between May 2007 and December 2013, 115 patients received continuous ACCESS-care. We hypothesized that the low 2-year disengagement and hospitalization rates and significant improvements in psychopathology, functioning, and quality of life could be sustained over 4 years. Over 4 years, only 10 patients disengaged from ACCESS. Another 23 left for practical reasons and were successfully transferred to other services. Hospitalization rates remained low (13.0% in year 3; 9.1% in year 4). Involuntary admissions decreased from 35% in the 2 years prior to ACCESS to 8% over 4 years in ACCESS. Outpatient contacts remained stably high at 2.0–2.4 per week. We detected significant improvements in psychopathology (effect size d = 0.79), illness severity (d = 1.29), level of functioning (d = 0.77), quality of life (d = 0.47) and stably high client satisfaction (d = 0.02) over 4 years. Most positive effects were observed within the first 2 years with the exception of illness severity, which further improved from year 2 to 4. Within continuous intensive 4-year ACCESS-care, sustained improvements in psychopathology, functioning, quality of life, low service disengagement and re-hospitalization rates, as well as low rates of involuntary treatment, were observed in contrast to other studies, which reported a decline in these parameters once a specific treatment model was stopped. Yet, stronger evidence to prove these results is required. Trial registration: Clinical Trial Registration Number: NCT01888627"

Because controlled food deprivation in laboratory animals and intermittent energy restriction in humans is a potent physiologic stimulus for ketosis, we designed a study to determine the impact of intermittent food deprivation during endurance training on performance and to elucidate the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms. Male mice were randomly assigned to either ad libitum feeding or alternate-day food deprivation (ADF) groups, and half of the mice in each diet group were trained daily on a treadmill for 1 mo. A run to exhaustion endurance test performed at the end of the training period revealed superior performance in the mice maintained on ADF during training compared to mice fed ad libitum during training. Maximal O2 consumption was increased similarly by treadmill training in mice on ADF or ad libitum diets, whereas respiratory exchange ratio was reduced in ADF mice on food-deprivation days and during running. Analyses of gene expression in liver and soleus tissues, and metabolomics analysis of blood suggest that the metabolic switch invoked by ADF and potentiated by exercise strongly modulates molecular pathways involved in mitochondrial biogenesis, metabolism, and cellular plasticity. Our findings demonstrate that ADF engages metabolic and cellular signaling pathways that result in increased metabolic efficiency and endurance capacity.—Marosi, K., Moehl, K., Navas-Enamorado, I., Mitchell, S.J., Zhang, Y., Lehrmann, E., Aon, M.A., Cortassa, S., Becker, K.G., Mattson, M.P.

https://openalex.org/W2791303335,"Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is the most common pediatric soft tissue sarcoma and outcomes have stagnated, highlighting a need for novel therapies. Genomic analysis of RMS has revealed that alterations in the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)/RAS/PI3K axis are common and that FGFR4 is frequently mutated or overexpressed. Although FGFR4 is a potentially druggable receptor tyrosine kinase, its functions in RMS are undefined. This study tested FGFR4-activating mutations and overexpression for the ability to generate RMS in mice. Murine tumor models were subsequently used to discover potential therapeutic targets and to test a dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor in a preclinical setting. Specifically, we provide the first mechanistic evidence of differential potency in the most common human RMS mutations, V550E or N535K, compared to FGFR4wt overexpression as murine myoblasts expressing FGFR4V550E undergo higher rates of cellular transformation, engraftment into mice, and rapidly form sarcomas that highly resemble human RMS. Murine tumor cells overexpressing FGFR4V550E were tested in an in vitro dose–response drug screen along with human RMS cell lines. Compounds were grouped by target class, and potency was determined using average percentage of area under the dose–response curve (AUC). RMS cells were highly sensitive to PI3K/mTOR inhibitors, in particular, GSK2126458 (omipalisib) was a potent inhibitor of FGFR4V550E tumor-derived cell and human RMS cell viability. FGFR4V550E-overexpressing myoblasts and tumor cells had low nanomolar GSK2126458 EC50 values. Mass cytometry using mouse and human RMS cell lines validated GSK2126458 specificity at single-cell resolution, decreasing the abundance of phosphorylated Akt as well as decreasing phosphorylation of the downstream mTOR effectors 4ebp1, Eif4e, and S6. Moreover, PI3K/mTOR inhibition also robustly decreased the growth of RMS tumors in vivo. Thus, by developing a preclinical platform for testing novel therapies, we identified PI3K/mTOR inhibition as a promising new therapy for this devastating pediatric cancer."

Methods In this prospective study, the right eyes of 108 healthy subjects were included. Three consecutive scans were obtained by 2 observers using the Tomey OA-2000, and in the same session one observer used the IOLMaster (version 5.4.4.0006) for the measurements. About 1 week later, 3 scans were obtained by one observer using the Tomey OA-2000. The axial length (AL), central corneal thickness (CCT), anterior chamber depth (ACD), lens thickness (LT), keratometer readings, pupil diameter (PD) and corneal diameter (CD) values measured by the Tomey OA-2000 and IOLMaster were analyzed. The coefficient of variation (CoV), intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), within subject standard deviation (Sw) and 2.77Sw were calculated to assess the repeatability and reproducibility. The paired t test and Bland-Altman plots were used to analyze the differences and agreements of parameters measured by the two devices, respectively. Results Intraobserver repeatability, and interobserver and intersession reproducibility of the AL, CCT, ACD, LT, Kf, Ks, Km, PD and CD values measured by the Tomey OA-2000 biometer showed a CoV of less than 1% except that for PD, and an ICC of more than 0.97 except that for PD and CD.

The 95% linite of agreement (LoA) of the AL, ACD, CD and all keratometer readings were no more than 0.24 mm, 0.14 mm 0.60 mm and 0.5 D, respectively. Conclusion Except for the PD and CD, the ocular parameters measured by the Tomey OA-2000 were highly repeatable and reproducible. Except for the CD value, there was good agreement of ocular parameters measured by the Tomey OA-2000 and the IOLMaster in healthy eyes."

The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is well-suited for the study of neuropeptide biochemistry and function, as neuropeptide biosynthesis enzymes are not essential for C. elegans viability. This permits the study of neuropeptide biosynthesis in mutants lacking certain neuropeptide-processing enzymes. Mass spectrometry has been used to study the effects of proprotein convertase and carboxypeptidase mutations on proteolytic processing of neuropeptide precursors and on the peptidome in C. elegans. However, the enzymes required for the last step in the production of many bioactive peptides, the carboxyl-terminal amidation reaction, have not been characterized in this manner. Here, we describe three genes that encode homologs of neuropeptide amidation enzymes in C. elegans and used tandem LC-MS to compare neuropeptides in WT animals with those in newly generated mutants for these putative amidation enzymes. We report that mutants lacking both a functional peptidylglycine α-hydroxylating monooxygenase and a peptidylglycine α-amidating monooxygenase had a severely altered neuropeptide profile and also a decreased number of offspring. Interestingly, single mutants of the amidation enzymes still expressed some fully processed amidated neuropeptides, indicating the existence of a redundant amidation mechanism in C. elegans. All MS data are available via ProteomeXchange with the identifier PXD008942. In summary, the key steps in neuropeptide processing in C. elegans seem to be executed by redundant enzymes, and loss of these enzymes severely affects brood size, supporting the need of amidated peptides for C. elegans reproduction.

https://openalex.org/W2792609326,"Ecotourism as a strategy for achieving biodiversity conservation often results in limited conservation impact relative to its investment and revenue return. In cases where an ecotourism strategy has been used, projects are frequently criticized for not providing sufficient evidence on how the strategy has reduced threats or improved the status of the biodiversity it purports to protect. In Lao PDR, revenue from ecotourism has not been directly linked to or dependent on improvements in biodiversity and there is no evidence that ecotourism enterprises have contributed to conservation. In other developing countries, direct payments through explicit contracts in return for ecosystem services have been proposed as a more cost-effective means for achieving conservation, although further research is needed to evaluate the impact of this approach. To address this need, a new model was tested in the Nam Et-Phou Louey National Protected Area (NPA) in Lao PDR using a direct payments approach to create ecotourism incentives for villagers to increase wildlife populations. Over a four-year period, we monitored along a theory of change to evaluate assumptions about the linkages between intermediate results and biological outcomes. Preliminary results show a negative correlation between ecotourism benefits and hunting infractions in target villages; no increase in hunting sign in the ecotourism sector of the NPA relative to a three-fold increase in hunting sign across the NPA's non-tourism sectors; and an overall increase in wildlife sightings. This case provides key lessons on the design of a direct payments approach for an ecotourism strategy, including how to combine threat monitoring and data on wildlife sightings to evaluate strategy effectiveness, on setting rates for wildlife sightings and village fees, and the utility of the approach for protecting very rare species."
https://openalex.org/W2790051262,"Tick chemokine-binding proteins (evasins) are an emerging class of biologicals that target multiple chemokines and show anti-inflammatory activities in preclinical disease models. Using yeast surface display, we identified a CCL8-binding evasin, P672, from the tick Rhipicephalus pulchellus. We found that P672 binds CCL8 and eight other CC-class chemokines with a Kd < 10 nm and four other CC chemokines with a Kd between 10 and 100 nm and neutralizes CCL3, CCL3L1, and CCL8 with an IC50 < 10 nm. The CC chemokine–binding profile was distinct from that of evasin 1 (EVA1), which does not bind CCL8. We also show that P672’s binding activity can be markedly modulated by the location of a StrepII-His purification tag. Combining native MS and bottom-up proteomics, we further demonstrated that P672 is glycosylated and forms a 1:1 complex with CCL8, disrupting CCL8 homodimerization. Homology modeling of P672 using the crystal structure of the EVA1 and CCL3 complex as template suggested that 44 N-terminal residues of P672 form most of the contacts with CCL8. Replacing the 29 N-terminal residues of EVA1 with the 44 N-terminal residues of P672 enabled this hybrid evasin to bind and neutralize CCL8, indicating that the CCL8-binding properties of P672 reside, in part, in its N-terminal residues. This study shows that the function of certain tick evasins can be manipulated simply by adding a tag. We conclude that homology modeling helps identify regions with transportable chemokine-binding functions within evasins, which can be used to construct hybrid evasins with altered properties.

Chemokines are a family of secreted proteins that are major drivers of both physiological and pathological inflammation (1Garin A. Proudfoot A.E. Chemokines as targets for therapy.Exp.

They fall into four groups, CC, CXC, XC, and CX3C, which are defined by the spacing between their N-terminal cysteine residues (2Schall T.J. Proudfoot A.E.

Structural features common to all chemokines include: a flexible N terminus followed by the double cysteine motif, the N-loop, a helix, a three-stranded sheet with 30S (between β1 and β2) and 40S (between β2 and β3) loops, and a C-terminal helix. The distal N terminus of the chemokine binds to the chemokine recognition site 2 (CRS2) 6The abbreviations used are: CRSchemokine recognition siteCKBPchemokine-binding proteinEVAevasinMS/MStandem mass spectrometryHCDhigher-energy collision dissociationAF647Alexa Fluor 647IMACimmobilized metal ion affinity chromatographyTCEPtris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphineECeffective concentrationSIDsource-induced dissociation. pocket of G-protein–coupled chemokine receptors, whereas the proximal N terminus and N-loop/40S loop grooves bind chemokine recognition site 1 (CRS1) in the extracellular N terminus of the receptor (3Zheng Y.

Binding to the CRS2 pocket results in conformational changes in the G-protein–coupled receptor that activates signaling. Binding of chemokines to target receptors is typically a “one-to-many” interaction, with several chemokines binding more than one receptor and several receptors binding more than one chemokine. Chemokines also bind with low affinity to endothelial cell surface glycosaminoglycans, which is necessary for chemokine function in vivo (5Kufareva I. Salanga C.L. Handel T.M.

The one-to-many interactions between chemokines and receptors, the expression of multiple receptor types on immune and inflammatory cells, and the expression of multiple chemokines at the site of injury or diseased tissues leads to the creation of a robust network that is not amenable to traditional therapeutics that monovalently target either chemokines or their receptors. chemokine recognition site chemokine-binding protein evasin tandem mass spectrometry higher-energy collision dissociation Alexa Fluor 647 immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine effective concentration source-induced dissociation. Natural selection in viruses, helminths, and ticks has resulted in the convergent evolution of proteins that target the chemokine network by different mechanisms (reviewed in Refs. 9González -Motos V.

For instance, the viral proteins MC148 and vMIP-II bind and inhibit multiple chemokine receptors. Other viruses have evolved chemokine-binding proteins (CKBPs) that bind multiple CC and CXC chemokines and disrupt glycosaminoglycan binding or disrupt chemokine binding to the receptor or both (11Kufareva I. Chemokines and their receptors: Insights from molecular modeling and crystallography.Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2016; 30 (27459124): 27-3710.1016/j.coph.2016.07.006Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Helminth CKBP also binds multiple CC and CXC chemokines, but the mechanism of action is not clearly understood (12Smith P. Fallon R.E. Mangan N.E. Walsh C.M. Saraiva M. Sayers J.R. McKenzie A.N.

Ticks, uniquely, have two classes of CKBPs, called evasins, with one class typically containing eight conserved Cys residues (“8-Cys” tick CKBPs) that bind subsets of CC chemokines and another class containing six conserved Cys residues (“6-Cys” CKBPs) that bind CXC chemokines. Following the initial identification of class I tick CKBPs, exemplified by evasin 1 (EVA1_RHISA, abbreviated to EVA1) and evasin 4 (EVA4_RHISA, abbreviated to EVA4), and a class II CKBP, exemplified by evasin 3 (EVA3_RHISA (13Bonvin P.

The structure of EVA1 in complex with CCL3 shows that it has 1:1 stoichiometry, with the N and C termini of EVA1 binding the N terminus and N-loop of CCL3 (16Dias J.M. Losberger C. Déruaz M. Power C.A. Proudfoot A.E. Shaw J.P. Structural basis of chemokine sequestration by a tick chemokine binding protein: The crystal structure of the complex between Evasin-1 and CCL3.PLoS ONE. 2009; 4 (20041127)e851410.1371/journal.pone.0008514Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The selectivity of the EVA1–CCL3 interaction resides in the six residues that immediately precede the double cysteine motif in CCL3. Binding results in a conformational change of the N terminus of CCL3, and this, together with the binding of the N-loop, explains the inhibition of chemokine activity (16Dias J.M. Losberger C.

In silico modeling and mutagenesis studies indicate that EVA4 also targets the CCL3 N terminus (17Bonvin P. Dunn S.M. Rousseau F. Dyer D.P. Shaw J. Power C.A. Handel T.M. Proudfoot A.E. Identification of the pharmacophore of the CC chemokine-binding proteins Evasin-1 and-4 using phage display.J. Biol.

Both EVA1 and EVA4 have been shown to have anti-inflammatory efficacy in several preclinical disease models, suggesting that they may be potential therapeutics in inflammatory disease (13Bonvin P. Power C.A. Proudfoot A.E. Evasins: Therapeutic potential of a new family of chemokine-binding proteins from ticks.Front. Immunol. 2016; 7 (27375615): 208Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Using yeast surface display, we have isolated a novel CCL8-binding CKBP from the tick Rhipicephalus pulchellus called P672_RHIPU (abbreviated to P672). We show that P672 binds and neutralizes several CC chemokines and that its ability to bind and neutralize chemokines is modulated by the location of a purification tag. We show that binding to CCL8 occurs with 1:1 stoichiometry and disrupts CCL8 homodimer formation. Using molecular modeling we identified a CCL8-binding region in P672 that can be transplanted to EVA1, a protein that does not bind CCL8. These results show that tick CKBP function can be modulated in some cases by the addition of a tag, providing proof of the concept that regions within tick CC-CKBPs with transportable properties can be identified and manipulated to create non-natural hybrid proteins with altered characteristics. We used fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to screen a yeast surface display library as described in detail previously (14Singh K. Davies G. Alenazi Y. Eaton J.R.O. Kawamura A. Bhattacharya S. Yeast surface display identifies a family of evasins from ticks with novel polyvalent CC chemokine-binding activities.Sci. Rep. 2017; 7 (28655871)426710.1038/s41598-017-04378-1Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The plasmid library was constructed to express 352 putative tick CKBPs with either N-terminal (AGA2) or C-terminal (SAG1 or AGA2) surface display tags. The plasmid library was transformed as a pool into yeast, and the cells were labeled with biotinylated CCL8 and streptavidin-AF647. The labeled cells were sorted by two rounds of FACS (Fig. 1, A and B). In each round, we used a sorting gate determined by FACS analysis of the yeast cells with streptavidin-AF647 alone. The sorting gate was used to exclude yeast cells displaying background fluorescence generated by streptavidin-AF647 binding to yeast. Cells that were recovered in the first sort were regrown and then sorted once again (Fig. 1C). Cells recovered in the second sort were next plated at low density, and individual yeast clones were picked and retested by labeling them with biotinylated CCL8 and streptavidin–Alexa Fluor 647. The clones picked were compared with control yeast expressing the relevant surface display tag (Fig. 1D). In these experiments, we found that only a proportion (30.8%) of the clonal yeast population would bind CCL8. Two independent clones recovered in this screen encoded a novel tick CKBP, P672 (GenBankTM accession number JAA60789.1). Both clones were obtained with an N-terminal surface display tag. P672 has 104 amino acid residues with a predicted molecular mass of 11.7 kDa and a predicted isoelectric point (pI) of 4.45. The glycosylation site prediction indicates several N-glycosylations and a single O-glycosylation site. Protein sequence alignment with EVA1, EVA4, and other CC-CKBPs identified by yeast surface display shows that P672 retains the eight Cys residues that form disulfide bonds in EVA1. The arrangement of the Cys residues is consistent with the motif CX(14,17)CX(3)CX(11,16)CX(17,20)CX(4)CX(4)CX(8)C that we have described previously (14Singh K. Davies G. Alenazi Y. Eaton J.R.O. Kawamura A. Bhattacharya S. Yeast surface display identifies a family of evasins from ticks with novel polyvalent CC chemokine-binding activities.Sci.

Phylogenetic analysis of the protein sequence shows that P672 is most closely related to EVA4 (Fig. 2B), with which it shares 36% identity over an alignment length of 105 residues. It shares only 29% identity with EVA1, over an alignment length of 89 residues. There is no significant homology to EVA3. The Pro residue in EVA1 that immediately follows the first Cys residue and contacts the disulfide bond in CCL3 (18Lubman O.Y. Fremont D.H. Parallel Evolution of chemokine binding by structurally related herpesvirus decoy receptors.Structure. 2016; 24 (26671708): 57-6910.1016/j.str.2015.10.018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) is replaced by a Tyr residue, as is the case for EVA4. The conservation plot (Fig. 2C) shows that the N and C termini of CC-CKBPs are less well conserved than the central core region. We expressed P672 as a secreted protein from mammalian cells essentially as described previously (14Singh K. Davies G. Alenazi Y. Eaton J.R.O. Kawamura A. Bhattacharya S. Yeast surface display identifies a family of evasins from ticks with novel polyvalent CC chemokine-binding activities.Sci. Rep. 2017; 7 (28655871)426710.1038/s41598-017-04378-1Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We purified P672 with a C-terminal StrepII-His purification tag by nickel affinity followed by size exclusion chromatography. However, as P672 was obtained only in an N-terminally tagged orientation in the yeast surface display screen, we also used an N-terminal His-StrepII tag approach to purify the protein. The purified protein in each case migrated at a larger molecular mass than expected (Fig. 3 and Fig. S1). This is consistent with its predicted glycosylation, which was confirmed by digestion of the protein with the glycosidases PNGaseF and Endo F1. On digestion, the smeared band collapses to a single band close to the predicted molecular mass on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3) together with a corresponding change in retention volume on size exclusion chromatography (Fig. S1A). Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) analysis at the peptide level of P672 treated with PNGaseF and Endo F1 was performed, and we were able to achieve sequence coverage of 87%, excepting the residues indicated in Fig. 2A. This identified several deamidated residues that had converted from Asn to Asp, corresponding to a mass shift of +0.98 Da in NX(S/T) motifs (supplemental material Table S1). Deamidation of Asn is a characteristic feature of N-glycosylation cleavage by PNGaseF (19Yen T.Y. Dutta S.M. Litsakos-Cheung C. Corona A.A. Timpe L.C. Macher B.A. Overcoming challenges and opening new opportunities in glycoproteomics.Biomolecules. 2013; 3 (24790834): 270-28610.3390/biom3020270Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) and indicates that the Asn residues are N-glycosylated. Only partial deglycosylation by PNGaseF and Endo F1 was achieved as supported by the finding of several peptides in deamidated and glycosylated forms carrying N-acetylglucosamine and/or N-acetylgalactosamine (HexNAc) moieties. The presence of HexNAc can be explained by the Endo F1 cleavage. The N-glycosylation sites identified by MS/MS are indicated in Fig. 2A. We next explored the binding profile of glycosylated P672, with both the N- and C-terminally tagged forms to a chemokine panel using biolayer interferometry (20Concepcion J. Witte K. Wartchow C. Choo S. Yao D. Persson H. Wei J. Li P. Heidecker B. Ma W. Varma R. Zhao L.S. Perillat D. Carricato G. Recknor M.

CKBPs were immobilized on the sensor through their His tag, and initial screening assays performed at 300 nm chemokine concentration indicated that P672 bound only certain CC chemokines. No binding was detected to CXC, XC, or CX3C chemokines (data not shown). Binding affinities (Kd) were subsequently determined through biolayer interferometry titration studies against these CC chemokines (Fig. 4). Notably, we observed different binding patterns when P672 was tagged at the C terminus, specifically the loss of binding to CCL14, CCL15, CCL11, CCL7, CCL2, CCL13, CCL1, and CCL16 at 300 nm chemokine concentration. We also noted a marked variation in target residence time (calculated from the off-rate) with P672 tag positioning, e.g. for its binding to CCL8. We next explored the ability of P672, in N- and C-terminally tagged versions, to inhibit chemokine function. We monitored their effects on the migration of THP-1 human monocyte cells in response to human CC chemokines in 96-well Boyden chamber assays (Fig. 5). We determined the effect of titrating in progressively increasing doses of P672 at the effective concentration (EC) dose, EC80, for each CC chemokine and found that N-terminally tagged P672 inhibits THP-1 cell migration in response to CC chemokines with IC50 <10 nm (Fig. 5, A–C). The relative effects of tag position were determined by comparing the ability of the N- or C-terminally tagged form of P672 to inhibit THP-1 cell migration (Fig. 5D). The C-terminal tag position had marked effects on the ability of P672 to inhibit CCL2- and CCL7-activated chemotaxis. Tag position had no significant effect on the ability of P672 to inhibit CCL3, CCL3L1, or CCL8 function. This is consistent with the binding data presented above and indicates that tag position can affect not only the binding of P672 to chemokines but also its function in solution. To understand the mechanism of P672 binding to CCL8, we characterized individual proteins and the complex using native mass spectrometry. As glycosylation can affect native mass spectrometry unpredictably, we used partially deglycosylated P672 for these experiments. The affinity of partially deglycosylated N-terminally tagged P672 for CCL8 was 7.25E-8 m (Fig. S1B), indicating that native mass spectrometry of the P672-CCL8 complex would be feasible and would allow us to elucidate the stoichiometry of the interaction. Initially, CCL8 and P672 were characterized separately. CCL8 was expressed bacterially as an N-terminal His-SUMO fusion, which following SUMO cleavage produced a new N terminus corresponding to glutamine (Gln-24). The presence of the glutamine N-terminal residue was confirmed using high resolution native MS/MS. The N-terminal glutamine of CCL8 can cyclize to form pyroglutamic acid, which is required for CCL8 biological activity (21Van Coillie E. Proost P. Van Aelst I. Struyf S. Polfliet M. De Meester I. Harvey D.J. Van Damme J. Opdenakker G. Functional comparison of two human monocyte chemotactic protein-2 isoforms, role of the amino-terminal pyroglutamic acid and processing by CD26/dipeptidyl peptidase IV.Biochemistry. 1998; 37 (9730840): 12672-1268010.1021/bi980497dCrossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). During electrospray ionization the N-terminal glutamine can also readily cyclize to form pyroglutamic acid. This change corresponded to the most intense peak observed, and the identity and site of modification were supported by higher-energy collision dissociation (HCD) fragment ions (Fig. S2). Purified CCL8 was biologically active in a cell migration assay (data not shown). We found that CCL8 formed a homodimer under native mass spectrometric conditions with an average mass of 22,566.6 ± 0.8 Da (Fig. 6A). In the case of P672 treated with PNGaseF and Endo F1, native MS spectra were more complex due to the presence of partial glycosylations, deamidations, and sodium adducts (Fig. 6B). The average masses observed ranged from 14,588 to 16,628 Da depending on the modifications present. Moreover, mass differences of ∼203 Da were observed, suggesting the presence of HexNAc moieties, which supports the results obtained by bottom-up proteomics (Fig. S3). Native mass spectrometry of the CCL8-P672 complex (mixed in at a 1:1 ratio) showed peaks of average masses ranging from 25.9 to 27.9 kDa, which corresponds well with that expected for a glycosylated and sodiated CCL8-P672 heterodimer (Fig. 6C, top panel). To demonstrate that this was the CCL8-P672 complex, the m/z 2956 was isolated with a 100 m/z isolation window and fragmented with HCD at 100 V. We observed that the complex clearly dissociated into CCL8 and a partially glycosylated P672 (Fig. 6C, bottom panel). To further explore complex formation, we performed native mass spectrometry of the P672-CCL8 complex with increasing amounts of CCL8 (Fig. S4). At a 1:1 and 2:1 ratios of CCL8:P672, we observed three peaks corresponding to 1:1 heterodimers. At a 3:1 ratio of CCL8:P672, the 1:1 heterodimeric complex continued to be observed along with monomeric and homodimeric CCL8 species. This confirms the 1:1 complex of P672 with CCL8 and indicates that CCL8 homodimers are disrupted by P672. The published structure of the EVA1-CCL3 complex (Protein Data Bank ID 3FPU) also has 1:1 stoichiometry (16Dias J.M. Losberger C. Déruaz M. Power C.A. Proudfoot A.E. Shaw J.P. Structural basis of chemokine sequestration by a tick chemokine binding protein: The crystal structure of the complex between Evasin-1 and CCL3.PLoS ONE. 2009; 4 (20041127)e851410.1371/journal.pone.0008514Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and this template allowed the modeling of the P672-CCL8 complex using the program MODELLER (22Webb B. Sali A. Protein structure modeling with MODELLER.Methods Mol. Biol. 2014; 1137 (24573470): 1-1510.1007/978-1-4939-0366-5_1Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar) (Fig. 7). The model suggested that the conserved Cys residues in P672 formed disulfide bonds in a manner similar to EVA1. We next used the Arpeggio (23Jubb H.C. Higueruelo A.P. Ochoa-Montaño B. Pitt W.R. Ascher D.B. Blundell T.L. Arpeggio: A web server for calculating and visualising interatomic interactions in protein structures.J. Mol. Biol. 2017; 429 (27964945): 365-37110.1016/j.jmb.2016.12.004Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) Web server to identify interchain interactions and the binding surface on P672. The model suggested that key CCL8-interacting residues were present in the N terminus of P672, i.e. residues Glu-17—Asn-44. The model does not provide any role for the extended N terminus of P672 (i.e. residues Val-1—Thr-16), which do not align to EVA1 (Fig. 2A). Truncation of residues Val-1—Thr-16 in P672 resulted in a modest decrease in binding affinity to CCL8 (Kd = 30.4 nm) suggesting that these residues may contribute to binding (Fig. S5). The model also shows that part of the binding surface (residue Asn-34) is adjacent to the C-terminal residue of P672 in the 3D structure (Fig. 7). The homology model constructed above suggested that the N-terminal residues of P672 may represent a region that confers binding to CCL8. To evaluate this hypothesis, we took advantage of the fact the EVA1 does not bind CCL8. The alignment of EVA1 with P672 (Fig. 2A) indicated that the predicted CCL8-binding residues are proximal to the second conserved Cys in P672. We replaced the N-terminal 29 residues of EVA1 with the equivalent N-terminal 44 residues of P672. This construct maximized the predicted CCL8 binding interface. We also created other, more extended hybrid molecules, replacing longer regions of EVA1 with the equivalent residues of P672 (Fig. 8A). These proteins were tagged at the C terminus with a StrepII-His tag so that changes (e.g. deletions) at the N terminus of P672 could be made without creating steric effects. We also constructed an identically tagged version of EVA1. We expressed these proteins as described above (Fig. S6) and characterized them for binding to target chemokines by biolayer interferometry. We initially assessed all CKBPs for binding at 300 nm chemokine concentration and then performed titration experiments to determine Kd (Fig. 8B). EVA1 bound to the closely related chemokines CCL4L1, CCL4, CCL3L, CCL3, CCL18, and CCL14. No binding was detected to other CC chemokines, consistent with previously reported results (16Dias J.M. Losberger C. Déruaz M. Power C.A. Proudfoot A.E. Shaw J.P. Structural basis of chemokine sequestration by a tick chemokine binding protein: The crystal structure of the complex between Evasin-1 and CCL3.PLoS ONE. 2009; 4 (20041127)e851410.1371/journal.pone.0008514Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Binding to CCL3, CCL3L1, and CCL23 was lost in all the hybrids. All hybrid CKBPs bound CCL8 and CCL18. We next tested for whether the P672 (1_44)-EVA1(29_94) hybrid would neutralize CCL8 function, and we found that it did so with a mean IC50 of 48 nm (Fig. 8C). As wildtype EVA1 does not bind CCL8, these results indicate that the N-terminal 44 residues of P672, which represent 42% of the P672 protein, contain a CCL8-binding region that is transportable to another evasin. In this work, we have identified, using yeast surface display approach, a novel evasin-like protein, P672_RHIPU (P672) encoded in the salivary transcriptome of the tick R. pulchellus. In the yeast surface display experiment, we found that only a proportion of the clonal yeast population would bind CCL8. This finding is likely due, in part, to the fact that only a proportion of clonal yeast express surface display proteins (24Chao G. Lau W.L. Hackel B.J. Sazinsky S.L. Lippow S.M. Wittrup K.D.

However, little is known about their economic impact. The objective of this study is to determine the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of an integrated care pathway designed for patients with complex health problems transferring from the hospital, a geriatric rehabilitation facility and primary care.This economic evaluation was performed from a societal perspective alongside a prospective cohort study with two cohorts of patients. The care as usual cohort was included before implementation of the pathway and the care pathway cohort after implementation of the pathway. Both cohorts were measured over nine months, during which intervention costs, healthcare costs, patient and family costs were identified. The outcome measures were dependence in activities of daily living (measured with the KATZ-15) and quality adjusted life years (EQ-5D-3L). Costs and effects were bootstrapped and various sensitivity analyses were performed to assess robustness of the results.After nine months, the average societal costs were significantly lower for patients in the care pathway cohort (€50,791) versus patients in the care as usual cohort (€62,170; CI = -22,090, -988). Patients in the care pathway cohort had better scores on the KATZ-15 (1.04), indicating cost-effectiveness. No significant differences were found between the two groups on QALY scores (0.01).The results of this study indicate that the integrated care pathway is a cost-effective intervention. Therefore, dissemination of the integrated care pathway on a wider scale could be considered. This would provide us the opportunity to confirm the findings of our study in larger economic evaluations. When looking at QALYs, no effects were found. Therefore, it is also recommended to explore if therapy in geriatric rehabilitation could also pay attention to other quality of life-related domains, such as mood and social participation."
https://openalex.org/W2792367722,"Approximately 80% of patients diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) die as a consequence of failure to eradicate the tumor from the bone marrow microenvironment. We have recently shown that stroma-derived interleukin-8 (IL-8) promotes AML growth and survival in the bone marrow in response to AML-derived macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF). In the present study we show that high constitutive expression of MIF in AML blasts in the bone marrow is hypoxia-driven and, through knockdown of MIF, HIF1α and HIF2α, establish that hypoxia supports AML tumor proliferation through HIF1α signaling. In vivo targeting of leukemic cell HIF1α inhibits AML proliferation in the tumor microenvironment through transcriptional regulation of MIF, but inhibition of HIF2α had no measurable effect on AML blast survival. Functionally, targeted inhibition of MIF in vivo improves survival in models of AML. Here we present a mechanism linking HIF1α to a pro-tumoral chemokine factor signaling pathway and in doing so, we establish a potential strategy to target AML."

However, to date, there are no reports available on clinical features and the risk factors for the asymptomatic reflux esophagitis in Nepalese adults. Methods Data were gathered from 142 erosive patients who had undergone endoscopy at Bir Hospital, Kathmandu. Los Angeles classification was used to grade the severity of the disease. Patients were interviewed to find out the presence of various reflux symptoms. Results Based on the Los Angeles classification, the severity of the disease assessed was; grade A 31.8% (31/142), grade B 39.4% (56/142), grade C 33.8% (48/142), and grade D 4.9% (7/142). One hundred and twenty six (88.7%) subjects had reflux symptoms. Prevalence of asymptomatic esophagitis was 16(11.3%). Age was independently linked to asymptomatic esophagitis (P<0.05), and the odd of being asymptomatic appeared lower in younger adults (P<0.05; OR: 0.118; CI: 0.014-.994). Conclusion A low prevalence of asymptomatic reflux esophagitis (RE) was seen. Most subjects experienced mild to moderate RE. Age remained an independent factor associated with reflux esophagitis, and the odds of being asymptomatic was lower in younger age."

The training dataset included 66 patients. A decision tree model was developed with 9 variables, and validated with 49 patients: short and long diameters of LNs, ratio of short and long diameters, maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) of LN, mean hounsfield unit, ratio of LN SUVmax and ascending aorta SUVmax (LN/AA), and ratio of LN SUVmax and superior vena cava SUVmax. A total of 301 LNs of 115 patients were evaluated in this study. Nodular calcification was applied as the initial imaging parameter, and LN SUVmax (≥3.95) was assessed as the second. LN/AA (≥2.92) was required to high LN SUVmax. Sensitivity was 50% for training dataset, and 40% for validation dataset. However, specificity was 99.28% for training dataset, and 96.23% for validation dataset. In conclusion, we have developed a new decision tree model for interpreting mediastinal LNs. All LNs with nodular calcification were benign, and LNs with high LN SUVmax and high LN/AA were metastatic Further studies are needed to incorporate subjective parameters and pathologic evaluations into a decision tree model to improve the test performance of PET/CT."
https://openalex.org/W2789178889,"Loose smut, caused by Ustilago tritici (Pers.) Rostr., is a systemic disease of tetraploid durum wheat (Triticum turgidum L.). Loose smut can be economically controlled by growing resistant varieties, making it important to find and deploy new sources of resistance. Blackbird, a variety of T. turgidum L. subsp. carthlicum (Nevski) A. Love & D. Love, carries a high level of resistance to loose smut. Blackbird was crossed with the loose smut susceptible durum cultivar Strongfield to produce a doubled haploid (DH) mapping population. The parents and progenies were inoculated with U. tritici races T26, T32 and T33 individually and as a mixture at Swift Current, Canada in 2011 and 2012 and loose smut incidence (LSI) was assessed. Genotyping of the DH population and parents using an Infinium iSelect 90K single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array identified 12,952 polymorphic SNPs. The SNPs and 426 SSRs (previously genotyped in the same population) were mapped to 16 linkage groups spanning 3008.4 cM at an average inter-marker space of 0.2 cM in a high-density genetic map. Composite interval mapping analysis revealed three significant quantitative trait loci (QTL) for loose smut resistance on chromosomes 3A, 6B and 7A. The loose smut resistance QTL on 6B (QUt.spa-6B.2) and 7A (QUt.spa-7A.2) were derived from Blackbird. Strongfield contributed the minor QTL on 3A (QUt.spa-3A.2). The resistance on 6B was a stable major QTL effective against all individual races and the mixture of the three races; it explained up to 74% of the phenotypic variation. This study is the first attempt in durum wheat to identify and map loose smut resistance QTL using a high-density genetic map. The QTL QUt.spa-6B.2 would be an effective source for breeding resistance to multiple races of the loose smut pathogen because it provides near-complete broad resistance to the predominant virulence on the Canadian prairies."
https://openalex.org/W2789570440,"Angiogenin (ANG), a member of the RNase superfamily (also known as RNase 5) has neurotrophic, neuroprotective and angiogenic activities. Recently it has also been shown to be important in stem cell homeostasis. Mutations in ANG are associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and Fronto-temporal dementia (FTD). ANG is a secreted protein which is taken up by cells and translocated to the nucleus. However, the import pathway/s through which ANG is taken up is/are still largely unclear. We have characterised the uptake of ANG in neuronal, astrocytic and microglial cell lines as well as primary neurons and astrocytes using pharmacological agents as well as dominant negative dynamin and Rab5 to perturb uptake and intracellular trafficking. We find that uptake of ANG is largely clathrin/dynamin independent and microtubule depolymerisation has a marginal effect. Perturbation of membrane ruffling and macropinocytosis significantly inhibited ANG uptake suggesting an uptake mechanism similar to RNase A. Our findings shed light on why mutations which do not overtly affect RNase activity but cause impaired localization are associated with neurodegenerative disease."
https://openalex.org/W2788191541,"The emergence of the vector Ixodes scapularis in Ontario, Canada poses a significant public health risk. Both passive and active surveillance approaches have been employed by public health professionals (i.e., government employees) to monitor for the range expansion of this tick. Field surveillance using drag sampling for questing ticks is a recognized and effective method to identify reproducing tick populations. The degree of effort (i.e., number of visits per site) can enhance the sensitivity and specificity of surveillance, but increased effort conflicts with the cost to public health for field surveillance. Here we developed an indicator to determine the likelihood of I. scapularis establishment based on field sampling results. Field data from two established populations of I. scapularis in Ontario were incorporated with previous analyses of surveillance data to create the indicator, which is in the form of a scoring system. The life stage(s) collected, overall abundance and past surveillance findings from a site are all considered and a level is assigned for the likelihood of I. scapularis establishment based on current field sampling results. The likelihood levels are non-zero (i.e., no I. scapularis detected, but risk still present due to adventitious ticks), low, medium or high, and recommendations for future surveillance and public health measures are provided. The indicator was validated against field sampling results from five other established sites in the province and correctly categorized all five areas as high likelihood of establishment. The indicator was also applied to field sampling results from 36 sites of unknown status that were visited twice during the period of 2014–2016. There was substantial agreement of levels between measurements, as calculated using a weighted kappa. The indicator can assist public health professionals with the interpretation of field sampling results and direct their efforts for ongoing surveillance and public health interventions for I. scapularis-borne diseases, including Lyme disease."
https://openalex.org/W2791789356,"Spider mites, a cosmopolitan pest of agricultural and landscape plants, thrive under hot and dry conditions, which could become more frequent and extreme due to climate change. Recent work has shown that neonicotinoids, a widely used class of systemic insecticides that have come under scrutiny for non-target effects, can elevate spider mite populations. Both water-stress and neonicotinoids independently alter plant resistance against herbivores. Yet, the interaction between these two factors on spider mites is unclear, particularly for Banks grass mite (Oligonychus pratensis; BGM). We conducted a field study to examine the effects of water-stress (optimal irrigation = 100% estimated evapotranspiration (ET) replacement, water stress = 25% of the water provided to optimally irrigated plants) and neonicotinoid seed treatments (control, clothianidin, thiamethoxam) on resident mite populations in corn (Zea mays, hybrid KSC7112). Our field study was followed by a manipulative field cage study and a parallel greenhouse study, where we tested the effects of water-stress and neonicotinoids on BGM and plant responses. We found that water-stress and clothianidin consistently increased BGM densities, while thiamethoxam-treated plants only had this effect when plants were mature. Water-stress and BGM herbivory had a greater effect on plant defenses than neonicotinoids alone, and the combination of BGM herbivory with the two abiotic factors increased the concentration of total soluble proteins. These results suggest that spider mite outbreaks by combinations of changes in plant defenses and protein concentration are triggered by water-stress and neonicotinoids, but the severity of the infestations varies depending on the insecticide active ingredient."
https://openalex.org/W2792668590,"We evaluate the world terrestrial network of protected areas (PAs) for its partnership potential in responding to climate change. That is, if a PA engaged in collaborative, trans-boundary management of species, by investing in conservation partnerships with neighboring areas, what climate change adaptation benefits might accrue? We consider core tenets of conservation biology related to protecting large areas with high environmental heterogeneity and low climate change velocity and ask how a series of biodiversity adaptation indicators change across spatial scales encompassing potential PA and non-PA partners. Less than 1% of current world terrestrial PAs equal or exceed the size of established and successful conservation partnerships. Partnering at this scale would increase the biodiversity adaptation indicators by factors up to two orders of magnitude, compared to a null model in which each PA is isolated. Most partnership area surrounding PAs is comprised of non-PAs (70%), indicating the importance of looking beyond the current network of PAs when promoting climate change adaptation. Given monumental challenges with PA-based species conservation in the face of climate change, partnerships provide a logical and achievable strategy for helping areas adapt. Our findings identify where strategic partnering efforts in highly vulnerable areas of the world may prove critical in safeguarding biodiversity."

Determining the risk factors associated with reversals in LST goals can improve patient and provider appreciation for the natural history and epidemiology of critical care and inform decision making around the (continued) use of LSTs. Methods This is a single institution retrospective cohort study of patients receiving life sustaining treatment in an academic tertiary hospital from 2009 to 2013. Deidentified patient electronic medical record data was collected via the clinical data warehouse to study the outcomes of treatment limiting Comfort Care and do-not-resuscitate (DNR) orders. Extended multivariable Cox regression models were used to estimate the association of patient and clinical factors with subsequent treatment limiting orders. Results 10,157 patients received life-sustaining treatment while initially Full Code (allowing all resuscitative measures). Of these, 770 (8.0%) transitioned to Comfort Care (with discontinuation of any life-sustaining treatments) while 1,669 (16%) patients received new DNR orders that reflect preferences to limit further life-sustaining treatment options. Patients who were older (Hazard Ratio(HR) 1.37 [95% CI 1.28–1.47] per decade), with cerebrovascular disease (HR 2.18 [95% CI 1.69–2.81]), treated by the Medical ICU (HR 1.92 [95% CI 1.49–2.49]) and Hematology-Oncology (HR 1.87 [95% CI 1.27–2.74]) services, receiving vasoactive infusions (HR 1.76 [95% CI 1.28, 2.43]) or continuous renal replacement (HR 1.83 [95% CI 1.34, 2.48]) were more likely to transition to Comfort Care. Any new DNR orders were more likely for patients who were older (HR 1.43 [95% CI 1.38–1.48] per decade), female (HR 1.30 [95% CI 1.17–1.44]), with cerebrovascular disease (HR 1.45 [95% CI 1.25–1.67]) or metastatic solid cancers (HR 1.92 [95% CI 1.48–2.49]), or treated by Medical ICU (HR 1.63 [95% CI 1.42–1.86]), Hematology-Oncology (HR 1.63 [95% CI 1.33–1.98]) and Cardiac Care Unit-Heart Failure (HR 1.41 [95% CI 1.15–1.72]).

Methods 358 female migrants were recruited from entertainment venues in a rapidly growing urban city in China. A survey which included measures of depressive symptoms, health-risk behaviors, social capital, and socio-demographic characteristics was administered. Multivariable logistic regression was conducted to identify the independent correlates of depression. Results Of participants, 31.0% had clinically significant depressive symptoms (CES-D score ≥ 16). In multivariable models, greater likelihood of depressive symptoms was associated with working in massage centers/hotels (OR = 3.20, 95% CI: 1.80–5.70), having probable alcohol dependence (OR = 2.25, 95% CI: 1.22–4.16), self-reported lifetime use of illicit drugs (OR = 2.98, 95% CI: 1.26–7.06), growing up in a non-nuclear family (OR = 2.46, 95% CI: 1.18–5.16), and poor social capital (OR = 6.01, 95% CI = 2.02–17.87).

https://openalex.org/W2791376627,"Insufficient membrane penetration of drugs, in particular biotherapeutics and/or low target specificity remain a major drawback in their efficacy. We propose here the rational characterization and optimization of peptides to be developed as vectors that target cells expressing specific receptors involved in endocytosis or transcytosis. Among receptors involved in receptor-mediated transport is the LDL receptor. Screening complex phage-displayed peptide libraries on the human LDLR (hLDLR) stably expressed in cell lines led to the characterization of a family of cyclic and linear peptides that specifically bind the hLDLR. The VH411 lead cyclic peptide allowed endocytosis of payloads such as the S-Tag peptide or antibodies into cells expressing the hLDLR. Size reduction and chemical optimization of this lead peptide-vector led to improved receptor affinity. The optimized peptide-vectors were successfully conjugated to cargos of different nature and size including small organic molecules, siRNAs, peptides or a protein moiety such as an Fc fragment. We show that in all cases, the peptide-vectors retain their binding affinity to the hLDLR and potential for endocytosis. Following i.v. administration in wild type or ldlr-/- mice, an Fc fragment chemically conjugated or fused in C-terminal to peptide-vectors showed significant biodistribution in LDLR-enriched organs. We have thus developed highly versatile peptide-vectors endowed with good affinity for the LDLR as a target receptor. These peptide-vectors have the potential to be further developed for efficient transport of therapeutic or imaging agents into cells -including pathological cells—or organs that express the LDLR."
https://openalex.org/W2793731600,"Demonstrability—the extent to which group members can recognize a correct solution to a problem—has a significant effect on group performance. However, the interplay between group size, demonstrability and performance is not well understood. This paper addresses these gaps by studying the joint effect of two factors—the difficulty of solving a problem and the difficulty of verifying the correctness of a solution—on the ability of groups of varying sizes to converge to correct solutions. Our empirical investigations use problem instances from different computational complexity classes, NP-Complete (NPC) and PSPACE-complete (PSC), that exhibit similar solution difficulty but differ in verification difficulty. Our study focuses on nominal groups to isolate the effect of problem complexity on performance. We show that NPC problems have higher demonstrability than PSC problems: participants were significantly more likely to recognize correct and incorrect solutions for NPC problems than for PSC problems. We further show that increasing the group size can actually decrease group performance for some problems of low demonstrability. We analytically derive the boundary that distinguishes these problems from others for which group performance monotonically improves with group size. These findings increase our understanding of the mechanisms that underlie group problem-solving processes, and can inform the design of systems and processes that would better facilitate collective decision-making."
https://openalex.org/W2788933792,"Heme cytotoxicity is minimized by a two-step catabolic reaction that generates biliverdin (BV) and bilirubin (BR) tetrapyrroles. The second step is regulated by two non-redundant biliverdin reductases (IXα (BLVRA) and IXβ (BLVRB)), which retain isomeric specificity and NAD(P)H-dependent redox coupling linked to BR's antioxidant function. Defective BLVRB enzymatic activity with antioxidant mishandling has been implicated in metabolic consequences of hematopoietic lineage fate and enhanced platelet counts in humans. We now outline an integrated platform of in silico and crystallographic studies for the identification of an initial class of compounds inhibiting BLVRB with potencies in the nanomolar range. We found that the most potent BLVRB inhibitors contain a tricyclic hydrocarbon core structure similar to the isoalloxazine ring of flavin mononucleotide and that both xanthene- and acridine-based compounds inhibit BLVRB's flavin and dichlorophenolindophenol (DCPIP) reductase functions. Crystallographic studies of ternary complexes with BLVRB-NADP+-xanthene-based compounds confirmed inhibitor binding adjacent to the cofactor nicotinamide and interactions with the Ser-111 side chain. This residue previously has been identified as critical for maintaining the enzymatic active site and cellular reductase functions in hematopoietic cells. Both acridine- and xanthene-based compounds caused selective and concentration-dependent loss of redox coupling in BLVRB-overexpressing promyelocytic HL-60 cells. These results provide promising chemical scaffolds for the development of enhanced BLVRB inhibitors and identify chemical probes to better dissect the role of biliverdins, alternative substrates, and BLVRB function in physiologically relevant cellular contexts."

We used this approach to generate new lines of mice that will be useful for a variety of aspects of neuroscience research. These lines have been bred to homozygosity and details of the expression and function of the transgenes are reported. Two lines target the Rosa26-locus and have been engineered to allow Cre-dependent expression of the avian tva receptor, and Cre-dependent expression of a cell surface targeted spaghetti-monster carrying many copies of the “ollas-tag”. Another line expresses red fluorescent protein and tva in Tac1-positive neurons; the fourth line targets FlpO expression to Plekhg1 expressing neurons, providing a powerful approach to modify gene expression in thalamic excitatory neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2791703566,"Quality control, global biases, normalization, and analysis methods for RNA-Seq data are quite different than those for microarray-based studies. The assumption of normality is reasonable for microarray based gene expression data; however, RNA-Seq data tend to follow an over-dispersed Poisson or negative binomial distribution. Little research has been done to assess how data transformations impact Gaussian model-based clustering with respect to clustering performance and accuracy in estimating the correct number of clusters in RNA-Seq data. In this article, we investigate Gaussian model-based clustering performance and accuracy in estimating the correct number of clusters by applying four data transformations (i.e., naïve, logarithmic, Blom, and variance stabilizing transformation) to simulated RNA-Seq data. To do so, an extensive simulation study was carried out in which the scenarios varied in terms of: how genes were selected to be included in the clustering analyses, size of the clusters, and number of clusters. Following the application of the different transformations to the simulated data, Gaussian model-based clustering was carried out. To assess clustering performance for each of the data transformations, the adjusted rand index, clustering error rate, and concordance index were utilized. As expected, our results showed that clustering performance was gained in scenarios where data transformations were applied to make the data appear ""more"" Gaussian in distribution."

The osteocyte has long been considered the principle mechanosensory cell type in bone, although recent evidence suggests the sensory nervous system may play a role in mechanosensing. The specific signaling pathways responsible for functional adaptation of the skeleton through modeling and remodeling are not clearly defined. In vitro studies suggest involvement of intracellular signaling through mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt), and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). However, anabolic signaling responses to bone loading using a whole animal in vivo model have not been studied in detail. Therefore, we examined mechanically-induced signaling events at five time points from 0 to 24 hours after loading using the rat in vivo ulna end-loading model. Western blot analysis of bone for MAPK’s, PI3K/Akt, and mTOR signaling, and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) to estimate gene expression of calcitonin gene-related protein alpha (CGRP-α), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), nerve growth factor (NGF), c-jun, and c-fos in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) of the brachial intumescence were performed. There was a significant increase in signaling through MAPK’s including extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) in loaded limbs at 15 minutes after mechanical loading. Ulna loading did not significantly influence expression of the genes of interest in DRG neurons. Bone signaling and DRG gene expression from the loaded and contralateral limbs was correlated (SR>0.40, P<0.05). However, bone signaling did not correlate with expression of the genes of interest in DRG neurons. These results suggest that signaling through the MAPK pathway may be involved in load-induced bone formation in vivo. Further characterization of the molecular events involved in regulation of bone adaptation is needed to understand the timing and impact of loading events, and the contribution of the neuronal signaling to functional adaptation of bone."
https://openalex.org/W2791287830,"Agencies are increasingly called upon to implement their natural resource management programs within an adaptive management (AM) framework. This article provides the background and motivation for the R package, AMModels. AMModels was developed under R version 3.2.2. The overall goal of AMModels is simple: To codify knowledge in the form of models and to store it, along with models generated from numerous analyses and datasets that may come our way, so that it can be used or recalled in the future. AMModels facilitates this process by storing all models and datasets in a single object that can be saved to an .RData file and routinely augmented to track changes in knowledge through time. Through this process, AMModels allows the capture, development, sharing, and use of knowledge that may help organizations achieve their mission. While AMModels was designed to facilitate adaptive management, its utility is far more general. Many R packages exist for creating and summarizing models, but to our knowledge, AMModels is the only package dedicated not to the mechanics of analysis but to organizing analysis inputs, analysis outputs, and preserving descriptive metadata. We anticipate that this package will assist users hoping to preserve the key elements of an analysis so they may be more confidently revisited at a later date."
https://openalex.org/W2789390334,"Most deaths occur in the pre-hospital setting, whereas mortality in the emergency department (ED) is low (<1%). However, our clinical impression is that some patients are being transported to hospital in devastating conditions with no likelihood of survival, but demanding extensive hospital resources. The decision on whether to transport a dying person to hospital or not is a difficult task for emergency medical services (EMS) personnel. As there is little epidemiological data about these patients, this paper aims to describe this special population.Retrospective cross-sectional study on adult patients transported by ground ambulance to the ED of a Swiss university hospital, who died during their stay in the ED between January 2008 and December 2012. Data was collected on the basis of ambulance report forms and discharge summaries of the ED.One hundred and sixty-one patients were analysed. Most deaths were due to cardiovascular diseases (43%). Only 9% of patients died of trauma. The median age was 70 years (IQR 56-81 years) and 70% (n = 112) were men. Trauma patients were significantly younger (median age 55 years, p<0.001). The overall mortality rate was 0.9% for all patients transported by EMS to the ED. About one third of all patients received cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) from bystanders (n = 53). The most common electrocardiogram (ECG) findings were asystole (n = 57) and pulseless electrical activity (n = 91). Fifty percent (n = 64) of the resuscitated patients were defibrillated. Three quarters (n = 115, 72%) of all patients were intubated on site. The mechanical chest compression device Lucas™2 was mainly used in cases of cardiovascular or uncertain cause of death and did not reduce the operating time on site.The low ED mortality rate of 0.9% shows that only a few dying patients are transported to hospital. However, transport to hospital has to be carefully evaluated, especially for elderly patients with asystole or PEA due to medical conditions. The low CPR rate from bystanders demonstrates that public CPR training should be promoted further. The use of Lucas™2 did not reduce the operating time on site. For further investigations, comparison with survivors would be needed."
https://openalex.org/W2789703325,"β-Arrestins (β-arrestin-1 and -2) are multifunctional proteins that play important roles in the regulation of inflammation and cell survival that need to be tightly controlled; however, the mechanism that underlies their gene expression is largely unclear. Here, we demonstrate that β-arrestin-1 is a transcriptional target of NF-κB. mRNA and protein levels of β-arrestin-1 were up-regulated by NF-κB inducers. Inhibition of NF-κB prevented the up-regulation of β-arrestin-1 mRNA, whereas activation of NF-κB led to increased β-arrestin-1 expression. β-Arrestin-1 promoter activity was consistently enhanced upon NF-κB activation as a result of the presence of a highly conserved κB site. β-Arrestin-1, in turn, suppressed the transcriptional activity of NF-κB by interfering with the interaction between p65 and p50. β-Arrestin-1-deficient mice displayed reduced TNF-α-induced cell death and increased expression of antiapoptotic genes. Reintroduction of β-arrestin-1, but not its mutant, which is unable to interfere with the p65-p50 interaction, into β-arrestin-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts partially restored sensitivity to TNF-α-induced cell death. These findings reveal NF-κB and β-arrestin-1 to be key components of a negative feedback circuit that is necessary to regulate cell death.-Li, J., Guo, A., Wang, Q., Li, Y., Zhao, J., Lu, J., Pei, G. NF-κB directly regulates β-arrestin-1 expression and forms a negative feedback circuit in TNF-α-induced cell death."
