https://openalex.org/W2165499430,"Coiled-coil sequences in proteins consist of heptad repeats containing two characteristic hydrophobic positions. The role of these buried hydrophobic residues in determining the structures of coiled coils was investigated by studying mutants of the GCN4 leucine zipper. When sets of buried residues were altered, two-, three-, and four-helix structures were formed. The x-ray crystal structure of the tetramer revealed a parallel, four-stranded coiled coil. In the tetramer conformation, the local packing geometry of the two hydrophobic positions in the heptad repeat is reversed relative to that in the dimer. These studies demonstrate that conserved, buried residues in the GCN4 leucine zipper direct dimer formation. In contrast to proposals that the pattern of hydrophobic and polar amino acids in a protein sequence is sufficient to determine three-dimensional structure, the shapes of buried side chains in coiled coils are essential determinants of the global fold."
https://openalex.org/W2086041680,"Hypertrophy is a fundamental adaptive process employed by postmitotic cardiac and skeletal muscle in response to mechanical load. How muscle cells convert mechanical stimuli into growth signals has been a long-standing question. Using an in vitro model of load (stretch)-induced cardiac hypertrophy, we demonstrate that mechanical stretch causes release of angiotensin II (Ang II) from cardiac myocytes and that Ang II acts as an initial mediator of the stretch-induced hypertrophic response. The results not only provide direct evidence for the autocrine mechanism in load-induced growth of cardiac muscle cells, but also define the pathophysiological role of the local (cardiac) renin-angiotensin system."
https://openalex.org/W2148922163,"A DNA sequence rich in (A+T), located upstream of the -10, -35 region of the Escherichia coli ribosomal RNA promoter rrnB P1 and called the UP element, stimulates transcription by a factor of 30 in vivo, as well as in vitro in the absence of protein factors other than RNA polymerase (RNAP). When fused to other promoters, such as lacUV5, the UP element also stimulates transcription, indicating that it is a separable promoter module. Mutations in the carboxyl-terminal region of the α subunit of RNAP prevent stimulation of these promoters by the UP element although the mutant enzymes are effective in transcribing the ""core"" promoters (those lacking the UP element). Protection of UP element DNA by the mutant RNAPs is severely reduced in footprinting experiments, suggesting that the selective decrease in transcription might result from defective interactions between α and the UP element. Purified α binds specifically to the UP element, confirming that α acts directly in promoter recognition. Transcription of three other promoters was also reduced by the COOH-terminal α mutations. These results suggest that UP elements comprise a third promoter recognition region (in addition to the -10, -35 recognition hexamers, which interact with the σ subunit) and may account for the presence of (A+T)-rich DNA upstream of many prokaryotic promoters. Since the same α mutations also block activation by some transcription factors, mechanisms of promoter stimulation by upstream DNA elements and positive control by certain transcription factors may be related."

VSV-G (IND) can be found in a highly repetitive form the envelope of VSV-IND and in a poorly organized form on the surface of infected cells. In VSV-G (IND) transgenic mice, B cells were unresponsive to the poorly organized VSV-G (IND) present as self antigen but responded promptly to the same antigen presented in the highly organized form. Thus, antigen organization influences B cell tolerance."
https://openalex.org/W2103923927,"An attenuated form of familial adenomatous polyposis coli, AAPC, causes relatively few colonic polyps, but still carries a significant risk of colon cancer. The mutant alleles responsible for this attenuated phenotype have been mapped in several families to the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) locus on human chromosome 5q. Four distinct mutations in the APC gene have now been identified in seven AAPC families. These mutations that predict truncation products, either by single base pair changes or frameshifts, are similar to mutations identified in families with classical APC. However, they differ in that the four mutated sites are located very close to one another and nearer the 5' end of the APC gene than any base substitutions or small deletions yet discovered in patients with classical APC."
https://openalex.org/W2006254842,"cAMP-responsive element modulator (CREM) expression is tissue specific and developmentally regulated. Here we report that CREM is unique within the family of cAMP-responsive promoter element (CRE)-binding factors since it is inducible by activation of the cAMP signaling pathway. The kinetic of expression is characteristic of an early response gene. The induction is transient and cell specific, does not involve increased transcript stability, and does not require protein synthesis. Significantly, the subsequent decline in CREM expression requires de novo protein synthesis. The induced transcript encodes a novel repressor, inducible cAMP early repressor (ICER), and is generated from an alternative intronic promoter. A cluster of four CREs in this promoter directs cAMP inducibility. ICER binds to these elements and thereby represses the activity of its own promoter, thus constituting a negative autoregulatory loop."
https://openalex.org/W1970195231,"The role of profilin in the regulation of actin assembly has been reexamined. The affinity of profilin for ATP-actin appears 10-fold higher than previously thought. In the presence of ATP, the participation of the profilin-actin complex to filament elongation at the barbed end is linked to a decrease in the steady-state concentration of globular actin. This surprising effect is made possible by the involvement of the irreversible ATP hydrolysis accompanying actin polymerization. As a consequence, in the presence of thymosin beta 4 (T beta 4), low amounts of profilin promote extensive actin assembly off of the pool of actin-T beta 4 complex. When barbed ends are capped, profilin simply sequesters globular actin. A model is proposed for the function of profilin in actin-based motility."
https://openalex.org/W1983475354,"Interaction with SV40 small tumor antigen (small t) compromised the ability of multimeric protein phosphatase 2A to inactivate the mitogen-activated protein kinase ERK1 and the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase MEK1. Transient expression of small t in CV-1 cells activated MEK and ERK but did not affect Raf activity. Small t stimulated the growth of quiescent CV-1 cells almost as effectively as did serum. Coexpression of kinase-deficient ERK2 blocked most, but not all, of the proliferation caused by small t. Activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway and stimulation of cell growth were dependent on the interaction of small t with protein phosphatase 2A. These findings indicate that SV40 small t is capable of inducing cell growth through blockade of protein phosphatase and deregulation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade."
https://openalex.org/W2049866297,"During inflammation, neutrophils migrate from the vascular lumen into extravascular sites. In vitro assays have suggested that platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 [PECAM-1 (CD31)], a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily, is required for the transmigration of neutrophils across endothelial monolayers. Antibody to human PECAM-1, which cross-reacts with rat PECAM-1, was found to block not only in vivo accumulation of rat neutrophils into the peritoneal cavity and the alveolar compartment of the lung but also neutrophil accumulation in human skin grafts transplanted onto immunodeficient mice. On the basis of these findings in three different models of inflammation, it appears that PECAM-1 is required for neutrophil transmigration in vivo and may thus be a potential therapeutic target."
https://openalex.org/W1985669808,"Polyketide synthases (PKSs) are multifunctional enzymes that catalyze the biosynthesis of a huge variety of carbon chains differing in their length and patterns of functionality and cyclization. Many polyketides are valuable therapeutic agents. A Streptomyces host-vector system has been developed for efficient construction and expression of recombinant PKSs. Using this expression system, several novel compounds have been synthesized in vivo in significant quantities. Characterization of these metabolites has provided new insights into key features of actinomycete aromatic PKS specificity. Thus, carbon chain length is dictated, at least in part, by a protein that appears to be distinctive to this family of PKSs, whereas the acyl carrier proteins of different PKSs can be interchanged without affecting product structure. A given ketoreductase can recognize and reduce polyketide chains of different length; this ketoreduction always occurs at the C-9 position. The regiospecificity of the first cyclization of the nascent polyketide chain is either determined by the ketoreductase, or the chain-extending enzymes themselves. However, the regiospecificity of the second cyclization is determined by a distinct cyclase, which can discriminate between substrates of different chain lengths."
https://openalex.org/W2023229923,"Development of the Drosophila retina occurs asynchronously; differentiation, its front marked by the morphogenetic furrow, progresses across the eye disc epithelium over a 2 day period. We have investigated the mechanism by which this front advances, and our results suggest that developing retinal cells drive the progression of morphogenesis utilizing the products of the hedgehog (hh) and decapentaplegic (dpp) genes. Analysis of hh and dpp genetic mosaics indicates that the products of these genes act as diffusible signals in this process. Expression of dpp in the morphogenetic furrow is closely correlated with the progression of the furrow under a variety of conditions. We show that hh, synthesized by differentiating cells, induces the expression of dpp, which appears to be a primary mediator of furrow movement."

https://openalex.org/W1977027703,"Cell-type specification in the Drosophila compound eye begins at the morphogenetic furrow. The furrow sweeps across the developing eye epithelium and is coincident with four classes of cellular events: coordinated changes in cell shape, changes in gene expression, synchronization of the cell cycle, and the specification of a regular array of ommatidial founder cells. The molecular mechanisms that induce these events in the developing eye have hitherto been unknown. We identify here a gene specifically required for furrow progression, hedgehog (hh). We show that hh expression posterior to the morphogenetic furrow is continuously required for its progression. We propose that forward diffusion of hh protein induces anterior cells to enter the furrow."
https://openalex.org/W2010307195,"Cell adhesion has an essential role in regulating proliferation during the G1 phase of the cell cycle, and loss of this adhesion requirement is a classic feature of oncogenic transformation. The appearance of cyclin A messenger RNA and protein in late G1 was dependent on cell adhesion in both NRK and NIH 3T3 fibroblasts. In contrast, the expression of Cdc2, Cdk2, cyclin D1, and cyclin E was independent of adhesion in both cell lines. Transfection of NRK cells with a cyclin A complementary DNA resulted in adhesion-independent accumulation of cyclin A protein and cyclin A-associated kinase activity. These transfected cells also entered S phase and complete multiple rounds of cell division in the absence of cell adhesion. Thus, cyclin A is a target of the adhesion-dependent signals that control cell proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W2073989221,"Mast cells and basophils, which are activated by immunoglobulin E (IgE) and allergen, play a prominent role in anaphylaxis. However, they express at least three types of IgE receptor, including the high affinity IgE receptor (Fc epsilon RI). The relative contribution of these IgE receptors, and possibly other receptors such as Fc epsilon RII/CD23 and Mac-2, to the genesis of in vivo anaphylaxis is still unclear. To address this question, we have generated Fc epsilon RI-deficient mice. These mice appear normal and express a normal number of mast cells, but they are resistant to cutaneous and systemic anaphylaxis. These data demonstrate that Fc epsilon RI is necessary for the initiation of IgE-dependent anaphylactic reactions. Therefore, interfering with its function should be an effective means of treating allergy, regardless of the allergen specificity."

https://openalex.org/W2022743955,"Budding of COP-coated vesicles (the likely carriers of newly synthesized proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum through the Golgi stack) from Golgi cisternae requires ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF), coatomer proteins from the cytosol, GTP, and fatty acyl-coenzyme A (CoA). The assembly of coated buds on the membranes requires coatomer, ARF, and GTP. When palmitoyl-CoA is added, membrane fission occurs at the coated bud, releasing coated vesicles. We show that COP-coated vesicles can be generated stepwise in vitro and isolated in a functionally active form, demonstrating that the minimal set of cytosolic components required for their formation as well as principal steps in their assembly have been identified."
https://openalex.org/W2036669020,"In humans, alteration of the tumor suppressor gene, APC, causes adenomatous polyposis coli, a condition causing predisposition to colorectal cancer. The syndrome inconsistently associates characteristic patches of congenital hypertrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium (CHRPE). Ocular examination revealed that patients expressing CHRPE tend to cluster within specific families. The exact APC mutation was identified in 42 unrelated patients. In all cases these mutations were predicted to lead to the synthesis of a truncated protein. The extent of CHRPE was found to be dependent on the position of the mutation along the coding sequence. CHRPE lesions are almost always absent if the mutation occurs before exon 9, but are systematically present if it occurs after this exon. Thus, the range of phenotypic expression observed among affected patients may result in part from different allelic manifestations of APC mutations."

https://openalex.org/W2157446482,"To identify the gene or genes associated with insulin resistance in Type II (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus, subtraction libraries were prepared from skeletal muscle of normal and diabetic humans and screened with subtracted probes. Only one clone out of 4000 was selectively overexpressed in Type II diabetic muscle as compared to muscle of non-diabetic or Type I diabetic individuals. This clone encoded a new 29-kilodalton member of the Ras-guanosine triphosphatase superfamily and was termed Rad (Ras associated with diabetes). Messenger ribonucleic acid of Rad was expressed primarily in skeletal and cardiac muscle and was increased an average of 8.6-fold in the muscle of Type II diabetics as compared to normal individuals."
https://openalex.org/W2122295685,"Transcription requires that RNA polymerase binds to promoters buried in nonspecific sites on DNA. The search for promoters may be facilitated if the polymerase slides along the molecule of DNA. Single molecules of Escherichia coli RNA polymerase were visualized, and their movements on immobilized bacteriophage lambda and T7 DNAs were examined. Deviating from drifts by bulk flow, about 40 percent of the enzyme molecules moved along the extended DNA. The results provide direct evidence for sliding as a mechanism for relocation of the enzyme on DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1992802797,"The E2F family of transcription factors functions in the control of the mammalian cell cycle. Here it is shown that two family members, E2F-1 and DP-1, form specific heterodimers in vivo, a process that enhances DNA binding, transactivation, and the binding of the retinoblastoma gene product. These results suggest that heterodimerization regulates E2F function and contributes to cell cycle control."

https://openalex.org/W2025122344,"To determine the physiological processes in which the transcription factor c-Rel may act, we have examined its pattern of expression in the avian embryo by in situ hybridization. These studies showed that c-rel is expressed ubiquitously at low levels and at high levels in isolated cells undergoing programmed cell death by apoptosis or autophagocytosis. To further establish a functional link between expression of c-rel and cell death, we examined the biological consequences of c-rel overexpression in vitro. In primary avian fibroblasts, overexpression of c-rel leads to transformation and dramatic life span extension. In contrast, bone marrow cells expressing high levels of c-rel undergo a process of programmed cell death displaying features of both apoptosis and autophagocytic cell death. Thus, these experiments suggest a critical role for c-rel not only in the control of cell proliferation, but also in the induction of cell death."

https://openalex.org/W2071601231,"Cellular compartmentalization of RNAs is thought to influence their susceptibility to ribozyme cleavage. As a test of this idea, two retroviral vectors—one encoding a hammer-head ribozyme designed to cleave lacZ transcripts and another encoding the lacZ messenger RNA—were coexpressed inside retroviral packaging cells. Because of the retroviral packaging signal, the ribozyme would be expected to colocalize with the lacZ-containing viral genomic RNA but not with the lacZ messenger RNA. The ribozyme was found to reduce the titer of infectious virus containing lacZ by 90 percent, but had no effect on translation of lacZ messenger RNA. These results indicate that sorting gene inhibitors to appropriate intracellular sites may increase their effectiveness."

https://openalex.org/W2003190277,"Phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) 4-kinase catalyzes the first step in the biosynthesis of PtdIns-4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns[4,5]P2). Hydrolysis of PtdIns[4,5]P2 in response to extracellular stimuli is thought to initiate intracellular signaling cascades that modulate cell proliferation and differentiation. The PIK1 gene encoding a PtdIns 4-kinase from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae was isolated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with oligonucleotides based on the sequence of peptides derived from the purified enzyme. The sequence of the PIK1 gene product bears similarities to that of PtdIns 3-kinases from mammals (p110) and yeast (Vps34p). Expression of PIK1 from a multicopy plasmid elevated PtdIns 4-kinase activity and enhanced the response to mating pheromone. A pik1 null mutant was inviable, indicating that PtdIns4P and presumably PtdIns[4,5]P2 are indispensable phospholipids."

https://openalex.org/W2086868295,"Rhodopsin has been selectively spin-labeled near the cytoplasmic termini of helices C and G. Photoactivation with a light flash induces an electron paramagnetic resonance spectral change in the millisecond time domain, coincident with the appearance of the active metarhodopsin II intermediate. The spectral change is consistent with a small movement near the cytoplasmic termination of the C helix and reverses upon formation of the MIII state. These results provide an important link between the optical changes associated with the retinal chromophore and protein conformational states."

https://openalex.org/W1965454202,"Microorganisms and plants manufacture a large collection of medically and commercially useful natural products called polyketides by a process that resembles fatty acid biosynthesis. Genetically engineered microorganisms with modified polyketide synthase (PKS) genes can produce new metabolites that may have new or improved pharmacological activity. A potentially general method to prepare cell-free systems for studying bacterial type II PKS enzymes has been developed that facilitates the purification and reconstitution of their constituent proteins. Selective expression of different combinations of the Streptomyces glaucescens tetracenomycin (Tcm) tcmJKLMN genes in a tcmGHIJKLMNO null background has been used to show that the Tcm PKS consists of at least the TcmKLMN proteins. Addition of the TcmJ protein to the latter four enzymes resulted in a greater than fourfold increase of overall activity and thus represents the optimal Tcm PKS. Polyclonal antibodies raised against each of the TcmKLMN proteins strongly inhibit the Tcm PKS, as do known inhibitors targeted to the active site Cys and Ser residues of a fatty acid synthase. This system exhibits a strict starter unit specificity because neither propionyl, butyryl, or isobutyryl coenzyme A substitute for acetyl coenzyme A in assembly of the Tcm decaketide. Because the Tcm PKS activity is significantly diminished by removal of the TcmM acyl carrier protein and can be restored by addition of separately purified TcmM to two different types of TcmM-deficient PKS, it should be possible to use such preparations to assay for each of the constituents of the Tcm PKS."

https://openalex.org/W2109644636,"A short RNA oligonucleotide comprising the 5' splice site consensus sequence (5'SS RNA) is sufficient to bind U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle (snRNP) or to induce the association of U2 snRNP and U4-U5-U6 triple snRNP. Analysis of the requirements of these interactions demonstrates that the 5'SS RNA is recognized independently by at least two different elements during spliceosome assembly: the 5' end of U1 snRNA and a component(s) of the U2-U4-U5-U6 snRNP complex. Since stable 5'SS RNA-U1 snRNA base pairing prevents interaction of the 5'SS RNA with U2-U4-U5-U6 snRNP complex, we conclude that disruption of the initial base pairing between the 5'SS RNA and the 5' end of U1 snRNA is required for subsequent spliceosome assembly."
https://openalex.org/W1529902870,"Angiotensin II is a potent growth factor for vascular smooth muscle cells and shares many signal transduction mechanisms with mitogens, including stimulation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases and protein tyrosine phosphorylation. Regulation of tyrosine phosphorylation involves both protein-tyrosine kinases and protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPases). To investigate the role of PTPases in angiotensin II-mediated events, we studied the expression of a transcriptionally regulated PTPase, 3CH134, which has selective activity toward MAP kinase. Angiotensin II rapidly induced 3CH134 mRNA (30 min maximum) in a concentration-dependent manner (100 nM maximum). Platelet-derived growth factor, alpha-thrombin, hydrogen peroxide, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, and ionomycin also induced 3CH134 but to levels lower than angiotensin II. Induction of 3CH134 by angiotensin II was partially inhibited after down-regulating protein kinase C but was fully inhibited after chelating intracellular Ca2+. Treatment with both phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and ionomycin induced 3CH134 mRNA to levels seen with angiotensin II, indicating that Ca2+ mobilization and protein kinase C activation can act synergistically to induce 3CH134. Angiotensin II stimulated 3CH134 protein synthesis after 1 h as measured by immunoprecipitation of 3CH134 from [35S]methionine-labeled cells using affinity-purified antibodies. These results establish 3CH134 as a dynamically regulated, immediate early gene in vascular smooth muscle cells and suggest a role for PTPases in regulating angiotensin II-stimulated events mediated by MAP kinases and tyrosine kinases."
https://openalex.org/W1545800501,"The cytochrome bo complex is a heme-copper terminal quinol oxidase in the aerobic respiratory chain of Escherichia coli and contains low spin heme B, high spin heme O and CuB as the redox metal centers in subunit I. Based on site-directed mutagenesis studies on the cyoE gene in the cytochrome bo operon, we have postulated that the cyoE gene encodes a protoheme IX farnesyltransferase (heme O synthase) (Saiki, K., Mogi, T., and Anraku, Y. (1992) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 189, 1491-1497). The present study demonstrates that the CyoE protein is localized in the cytoplasmic membrane and that the CyoE-overproduced membranes efficiently catalyze a conversion of exogenous ferrous protoheme IX and farnesyl diphosphate to heme O in the presence of divalent cations such as Mg2+ or Ca2+. Thus, the cyoABCDE operon in E. coli encodes not only subunits of the cytochrome bo complex but also heme O synthase that is specifically required for functional expression of the bo-type quinol oxidase. Heme O seems to be an intermediate in heme A biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2101023417,"Studies in vivo and in vitro have shown that the packaging of DNA into chromatin can affect gene expression. Here, binding of the yeast transcriptional activator GAL4 to DNA in chromatin has been investigated in vivo with a yeast episome. A positioned nucleosome that is present in cells grown in glucose and contains a single GAL4 binding site is disrupted by GAL4 binding in galactose. GAL4 can also bind to DNA in chromatin when the carboxyl-terminal activation domain of GAL4 is either masked by GAL80 or is absent. These results show that a transcription factor can bind to its site in vivo in what would appear to be a repressive chromatin structure."
https://openalex.org/W2057948541,"Protein phosphatases play important roles in the regulation of cell growth and metabolism, yet little is known about their enzymatic mechanism. By extrapolation from data on inhibitors of other types of hydrolases, an inhibitor of prostatic acid phosphatase was designed that is likely to function as a mechanism-based phosphotyrosine phosphatase inactivator. This molecule, 4-(fluoromethyl)phenyl phosphate, represents a useful paradigm for the design of potent and specific phosphatase inhibitors."
