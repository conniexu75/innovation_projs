https://openalex.org/W1998464620,"Abstract The established cloned line, 3T3-L1, is a preadipose line. When the cells enter a resting state, either in monolayers or in suspension culture stabilized with methyl cellulose, they accumulate triglyceride fat and become adipose cells. A high serum concentration in the culture medium increases the rapidity and extent of the fat accumulation. The adipose conversion can be delayed indefinitely in surface cultures by keeping the cells in a growing state. 3T3-L1 is also specialized for collagen synthesis; prior to its adipose conversion, it makes about as much collagen as other 3T3 cells. We may therefore regard 3T3-L1 as a fibroblast line with an additional form of specialization. After 3T3-L1 cells are grown to confluence in the presence of low concentrations of bromodeoxyuridine, their rate of collagen synthesis is not affected, but their conversion to adipose cells is completely prevented. If the cells are then permitted to grow in medium free of bromodeoxyuridine, their ability to convert to adipose cells is regained. The conversion of 3T3-L1 from pre-adipose to adipose cells therefore involves a process of differentiation which can be studied under cell culture conditions."

N,N-Dimethyltryptamine was not formed. With tryptamine as substrate the product is 2,3,4,9-tetrahydro-1H-pyrido[3,4b]indole and not N-methyltryptamine. These pyridoindoles were not formed when S-adenosylmethionine was cosubstrate."

Elliott1 reported that intravenous administration of soybean oil and lecithin to children suffering from CF caused their sweat sodium concentration to decrease towards normal values. This prompted us to investigate the fatty acid spectra of the various serum lipid classes of children with CF. We have found that affected children are deficient in certain essential fatty acids."

https://openalex.org/W1553604966,"Abstract The treatment of purified rat muscle AMP deaminase with pryidoxal-5'-P produces a decrease of the enzyme activity which is time- and pyridoxal-5'-P concentration-dependent. The reaction is reversible and can be changed to an irreversible reaction by reduction with NaBH4. The reduced pyridoxal-5'-P-AMP deaminase complex shows an absorption spectrum which is typical for pyridoxamine derivatives. Chromatographic analyses confirm the formation of a Schiff base between pyridoxal-5'-P and the e-amino group of lysine residues in the enzyme. The loss of activity is not a simple inactivation process due to modification of the catalytic site of the enzyme. GTP and ATP, which are allosteric inhibitors of AMP deaminase, show a protective effect against pyridoxal-5'-P inactivation whereas KCl at high concentration exerts a little protection and Pi and P-creatine are ineffective. The reduced pyridoxal-5'-P-AMP deaminase derivative with 30 to 35% residual activity and 6 to 7 moles of pyridoxal-5'-P bound per mole of protein has different kinetic and regulatory properties from the native enzyme: Vmax is the same but the Km value is increased; the enzyme shows a homotropic cooperativity also in the presence of activators, K+ and ADP, and is no longer sensitive to GTP, ATP, and high salt concentration inhibitions. Pi and P-creatine still exert an inhibitory effect. These kinetic properties are similar to those of the native enzyme in the presence of nucleoside triphosphates. The reduced pyridoxal-5'-P-AMP deaminase derivative prepared in the presence of GTP is still sensitive to inhibition by nucleoside triphosphates. It is likely that pyridoxal-5'-P binds at or near the binding sites for these compounds."

https://openalex.org/W2066013913,Abstract Isolated HeLa cell nuclei are capable of synthesizing a precursor to 4S RNA. The 3′ terminus of the molecule made in vitro can be determined by four separate incubations with the four iritiated ribonucleoside triphosphates. The pre-4S was found to terminate specifically with uridine and be uniformly labeled. These facts are discussed in relation to specific termination of RNA molecules and possible reinitiation of RNA synthesis in isolated nuclei.

https://openalex.org/W1556870551,"Initial velocity studies of the malate thiokinase reaction were conducted in the direction of malyl-CoA synthesis. At a fixed concentration of the third substrate, all substrate pairs showed an intersecting kinetic pattern. These results, along with the results of inhibition studies utilizing succinylCoA and phosphate as product inhibitors and chromiumATP as a dead-end inhibitor, indicate that the reaction involves the random addition of substrates to the enzyme. Initial velocity studies were also conducted on the enzyme-catalyzed arsenolysis of succinyl-CoA. By utilizing ATP and sulfate as inhibitors, this reaction was shown to be sequentially ordered, with succinyl-CoA binding prior to arsenate. The enzyme catalyzes a slow ATP-ADP exchange reaction, which is stimulated by coenzyme A or succinyl-CoA, and a slow succinate-succinyl-CoA exchange reaction, which appears to require phosphate. Incubation of enzyme with [γ-32P]ATP leads to the incorporation of 0.5 mole of phosphate per mole of enzyme. These results suggest the existence of phosphorylated enzyme and succinyl phosphate as reaction intermediates."

https://openalex.org/W2069949240,"TRITIUM-labelled steroids have been widely used as tracers in the investigation of steroid metabolism, due to their high specific activity, low cost and low radiation dosage in vivo. The validity of any experiment using labelled steroids depends on the fact that the labelled and the endogenous materials are metabolised in a similar manner. In the case of the in vivo metabolism of the 1,2-3H-labelled and endogenous cortisol in man, proof of this is lacking. The experiments of Cope and Pearson1, and of Gold and Crigler2 using mixtures of 1,2-3H-cortisol and 4-14C-cortisol suggested that these two different species of labelled cortisol were metabolised in a similar manner, and from this it was inferred that they could both be used as valid tracers for studying cortisol metabolism."
