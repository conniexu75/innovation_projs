https://openalex.org/W2006077930,Three species of Antarctic fishes which live in constantly near-freezing waters have a markedly low upper-lethal temperature of 6 degrees C ; this is the lowest upper-lethal temperature reported for any organism. The fishes survive supercooling to -2.5 degrees C. Data on brain metabolism in vitro support the hypothesis that the central nervous system is a primary site of thermal injury.
https://openalex.org/W1985543379,Handling rat pups either for 10 or 20 days after birth resulted in a reduction of adrenocortical steroids in the plasma at weaning after the pups were exposed to novel stimuli as compared with controls that were not handled. Nonhandled offspring of mothers which had been handled in infancy also show a reduction in plasma steroids in response to novel stimuli when compared to nonhandled weanling rats of nonhandled mothers. Handling of the offspring when they are infants appears to counteract the influence of the experience of the mother during her infancy.
https://openalex.org/W1995418510,"DDT residues in the soil of an extensive salt marsh on the south shore of Long Island averaged more than 13 pounds per acre (15 kilograms per hectare); the maximum was 32 pounds per acre (36 kilograms per hectare). A systematic sampling of various organisms from the vicinity showed concentrations of DDT increasing with trophic level through more than three orders of magnitude from 0.04 part per million in plankton to 75 parts per million in a ring-billed gull. Highest concentrations occurred in scavenging and carnivorous fish and birds, although birds had 10 to 100 times more than fish. These concentrations approach those in animals dying from DDT poisoning, which suggests that many natural populations in this area are now being affected, possibly limited, by DDT residues. Similar concentrations have been reported elsewhere in North America."
https://openalex.org/W2038476778,"Ammonium persulfate, a common polymerizing agent for acrylamide gels, can inactivate yeast enolase and produce increased electrophoretic heterogeneity during disc electrophoresis in gels containing 8M urea. The use of riboflavin and light for polymerization or thioglycolate for removal of the persulfate are feasible alternatives."
https://openalex.org/W2092070223,"When the eye is illuminated by an intense flash, the visual pigment rhodopsin begins to pass rapidly through a series of intermediate states, eventually becoming bleached. If a second flash is delivered during the lifetimes of these intermediates the rhodopsin can be photoregenerated. A fast electrical response of the visual receptors, the early receptor potential, is elicited by the first flash. A similar response is elicited by the second flash, but the polarity of this response is reversed. Moreover, this response can be separated into three components, each arising from the action of light on a different intermediate. It is likely that all these fast responses, including the early receptor potential, arise from charge displacements in the visual-pigment molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1967446411,"The fifth component of complement that reacts hemolytically in the guinea pig or rat complement system, C'3b, is intimately associated with the generation of anaphylatoxin. Anaphylatoxin was formed (i) if this purified component reacted with a washed, intermediate complex consisting of antigen, antibody, and the first four components of complement; (ii) if the component was treated with trypsin; or (iii) if the component was incubated with a material isolated from cobra venom together with a fraction from serum other than complement. The significance of this fifth component as anaphylatoxinogen is discussed, and a common mechanism is proposed for the generation of anaphylatoxin in whole serum."

These organelles are not seen after treatment with colchicine, which has various functional effects on these cells but does not inhibit phagocytosis."
https://openalex.org/W1488485686,"Hyaluronidase isolated from the lysosomes of rat liver (1) was purified 1300-fold by ammonium sulfate precipitation, chromatography on hydroxylapatite, and chromatography on Sephadex G-100. The most purified fraction gave two peaks on sedimentation in the ultracentrifuge, the faster of the two being yellow and possessing no enzymic activity. The slower peak showed a single band on acrylamide gel electrophoresis. The molecular weight of the enzyme was calculated to be 89,000 based on sedimentation equilibrium data."
https://openalex.org/W1596064896,Abstract Comparisons were made of the ratios of the specific activities of stearic acid to oleic acid in adipose tissue and liver triglycerides of rats given methyl stearate-1-14C dissolved in 0.25 ml of corn oil and Sterculia foetida oil. The ratios were about 3 in the corn oil control animals compared to 31 to 43 in adipose tissue and 44 to 246 in liver triglycerides of the S. foetida test animals. When the labeled stearate was administered in 0.5 ml of S. foetida oil almost no label appeared in tissue oleic acid. The inhibition was also shown to be affected by sterculic acid in vitro with rat liver preparations. Evidence was obtained that the mechanism of inhibition is the irreversible binding of enzyme sulfhydryl groups by the cyclopropene group.

https://openalex.org/W1504056475,"Abstract An enzyme that catalyzes disulfide interchange in proteins, localized in the microsomes of all tissues tested, has been isolated in pure form from bovine liver microsomes. The protein contains 3 half-cystine residues, only 1 of which appears to be essential for enzymic activity. This unique residue must be in the sulfhydryl form for catalysis. The enzyme has been shown to catalyze the rearrangement of random, incorrect pairs of half-cystine residues to the native disulfide bonds in several protein substrates. Rearrangement occurs when the enzyme is used in the presence of low levels of mercaptoethanol, or in the absence of mercaptoethanol after previous reduction. The efficiency of the enzyme in the conversion of randomly cross-linked proteins to their native states appears to be a function of the number of disulfide bonds in the substrate."

These cleistothecia, apparently of a new genus, produced eight spored asci. Monoascospore cultures developed hyphae and conidia typical of B. dermatitidis. Mice were successfully infected with inocula from a monoascospore culture."

https://openalex.org/W2094647111,"The biographical approach to the identification of scientific talent has shown significant results in a variety of situations which included different laboratories, fields of specialization, and age groups. Much remains to be accomplished, however. The biographical approach needs to be validated in other organizational settings employing relevant criteria. Although this kind of research is being initiated, a number of studies are needed to define the advantages and limitations. The use of biographical information to identify the creative and other talents of executives, composers, administrators, and artists has been largely unexplored. Furthermore, the meaning of the biographical items has not been correlated with existing psychological theory and knowledge. All evidence to date indicates that the investigation of biographical information and its relationship to various criteria of performance and other psychological measures is a rapidly expanding area of investigation which will make further contributions to the identification of talent in a variety of fields."
https://openalex.org/W2023776717,Structural changes within fish schools correlate with declines in environmental oxygen. The changes may result from the responses of individual fish to the environmental consequences of group metabolism. Individual behaviors are adaptive to the school in that they tend to maintain stability between school members and their environment.
https://openalex.org/W2100179283,"Bad scientific writing involves more than stylistic inelegance: it is often the outward and visible form of an inward confusion of thought. The scientific literature at its present standard distorts rather than forms the graduate student's view of scientific knowledge and thought, and corrupts his ability to write, to read, and to think. Strong educational measures are needed to effect reform. I advocate a course on scientific writing as an essential feature in every scientist's training. Such a course delves deep into the philosophy and method of science if it deals with logic, precision, and clarity; on how these qualities can be achieved in writing; and on how such achievement strengthens the corresponding faculties in thinking."
https://openalex.org/W2007320597,"In a series of Xenopus larvae (stages 28 to 35), the left eye cup was dorsoventrally and anteroposteriorly inverted. After metamorphosis, the retinotectal projection was mapped by recording action potentials evoked in the tectum by a small spot of light projected on the retina. Normal retinotectal projection was found following rotation of the eye cup at stage 28 to 29. Rotation of the eye cup at stage 30 resulted in anteroposterior inversion of the retinotectal projection; rotation at stages 31, 32, and 35 resulted in inversion of the projection in anteroposterior and dorsoventral axis of the retina. Therefore the retinal ganglion cells were unspecified at stage 28 to 29; spatial specification of ganglion cells occurred in the anteroposterior axis of the eye cup at stage 30 and in the dorsoventral axis between stages 30 and 31."
https://openalex.org/W2038373110,"The incorporation of progestrone-7α-3H and pregnenolone-7α-3H into digitoxigenin, gitoxigenin, and digoxigenin in isolated, surviving leaves of Digitalis lanata was demonstrated. In addition, the conversion of pregnenolone to progesterone in the same system was proved. The results tend to indicate that progesterone is as good a precursor of cardenolides as pregnenolone. It is suggested that the biosynthesis of cardenolides might proceed through the intermediacy of progesterone."
https://openalex.org/W2070862594,"Xylulose-, fructose-, and octulose-diphosphates are substrates for rabbit muscle aldolase with essentially identical Km values, but they are cleaved at different rates. After treatment with carboxypeptidase, chymotrypsin, or subtilisin, aldolase cleaves all of these substrates at the same (deceased) rate; the modified aldolase preparations are also equally impaired in their ability to catalyze the detritiation of specifically labeled dihydroxyacetone phosphate. These results suggest that aldolase exhibits ""induced fit,"" in which the rate of cleavage is determined by the distance between the sites on the protein to which the two phosphate groups of a substrate are bound. The activity of the modified aldolases is limited by a step involving making or breaking a carbon-hydrogen bond."

Mid-gestation embryos and adult fibroblasts show an increase in late-replicating DNA. Here, one X-chromosome is labeled in one arm; the other is labeled throughout."
https://openalex.org/W1497592739,"Abstract The deoxycytidylate deaminase induced in Escherichia coli by infection with T6 bacteriophage has been purified approximately 350-fold over the crude extract. At its present state of purity, 29 µmoles of deoxycytidylate are deaminated per mg of protein per min, and deoxycytidylate is the only active substrate so far tested. Neither 5-methyldeoxycytidylate nor 5-hydroxymethyldeoxycytidylate is deaminated. The enzymatic activity is highly stimulated by deoxycytidine triphosphate and 5-hydroxymethyldeoxycytidine triphosphate, and is inhibited by deoxythymidine triphosphate. This regulation of enzymatic activity affords a means of controlling the rate of conversion of deoxycytidylate to deoxythymidylate, depending on the relative concentrations of deoxycytidine triphosphate, 5-hydroxymethyldeoxycytidine triphosphate, and deoxythymidine triphosphate in the nucleotide pool."
https://openalex.org/W2059847399,"Fast electrical responses elicited from the transient intermediates in the bleaching of rhodopsin have been investigated in the retina of the albino rat. In the experiments we used two-flash stimuli triggered sequentially with a continuously variable time delay between them. At room temperature the potential is biphasic in wave-form. The dominant, corneal-positive component is preceded by a small, corneal-negative component. Cooling the retina to about 0°C suppresses the positive component and isolates the faster, negative component. Experiments with color filters show that these two components display different spectral sensitivities and, hence, suggest that each of them is produced by a different photoproduct of bleaching."
https://openalex.org/W2013497655,"Genetic complementation tests of ochre-type suppressible mutants of bacteriophage S13 have revealed a seventh gene. A mutation of this gene has no significant effect on synthesis of the phage replicative form DNA, but like five other phage genes it prevents the appearance of single-stranded DNA. With the new gene, it seems likely that approximately 70 to 100 percent of the phage genes are accounted for."
https://openalex.org/W1997547142,"Repeated combinations of a previously well-learned size clue preference with the previously negative form cue followed by gradual reduction of the size cue resulted in nearly errorless performance by two sea lion. on a series of nine form-discriminination reversals. Systematic insertion of probe trials, during which the size cue was not present, revealed that attention was primarily focused on the size dimension during early stages of training, when size differences were large, and then was gradually shifted to the form dimension as a function of the increasing difficulty of the size discrimination."
https://openalex.org/W2081113500,"The serological properties of thymus cells of inbred mice bearing Ehrlich ascites tumors and treated with cortisol were investigated. Thymusdistinctive antigenicity and sensitivity to the cytotoxic effect of guinea pig serum and rabbit serum were significantly decreased, without change in reactivity to H-2 isoantibodies."
https://openalex.org/W1618885326,"Abstract An enzyme system has been isolated from Streptomyces hygroscopicus that catalyzes the transfer of glucose from guanosine diphosphate d-glucose-14C to glucose 6-phosphate to form trehalose phosphate. The reaction appears to be specific for GDP-glucose; relatively little activity was found in trehalose phosphate when other 14C-glucose nucleotides were used in place of GDP-d-glucose. Glucose-6-P, mannose-6-P, and fructose-6-P all served as acceptors because of the presence of phosphohexose isomerase, but other phosphorylated sugars were inactive. The product formed in the presence of GDP-d-glucose-14C and glucose-6-P was characterized as trehalose phosphate by chemical, enzymatic, and chromatographic methods."
https://openalex.org/W1498732418,"Abstract Protons, AsO=4, and NH+4 are competitive inhibitors of Pi in the oxidative esterification of Pi in chloroplasts. Pi, AsO=4, NH+4, and other monovalent cations are competitive inhibitors of H+ in the cation-H+ exchange reaction of chloroplasts. Since Pi and protons compete for the same electron-activated fixed anionic sites in chloroplasts, it is proposed that the initial energy-requiring step in oxidative phosphorylation is the removal, or activation, of the proton from bound magnesium Pi by the passage of an electron through a semiconducting anionic lattice, possibly acidic lipids, within chloroplasts."
https://openalex.org/W1586130720,"Abstract In studies on the mechanisms whereby chloramphenicol inhibits the induction of liver cancer by the carcinogen N-2-fluorenyldiacetamide, observations were made on the effect of chloramphenicol on protein synthesis, on the need for protein synthesis of effect protein binding of carcinogen, and on the metabolism of the carcinogen in rats. After a pulse of uniformly labeled l-leucine-14C, labeling of liver proteins was not affected by 500 mg of chloramphenicol per kg injected 3 or 24 hours earlier, but was increased slightly after 7 weeks of 2% dietary chloramphenicol and was significantly higher after 0.05% dietary N-2-fluorenyldiacetamide with or without chloramphenicol. The weight of liver proteins per 100 g of body weight was larger in the two groups fed chloramphenicol, with or without carcinogen. Puromycin lowered leucine incorporation, but did not affect the binding of isotope from the active carcinogenic intermediate, N-hydroxy-N-2-fluoren-9-14C-ylacetamide. After 6 weeks of dietary N-2-fluorenyldiacetamide followed by a single intraperitoneal dose of the labeled agent, 83% of the radioactivity was excreted in the urine in 24 hours, of which 2.2, 47, and 14% were free compounds, glucosiduronic acids, and sulfuric acid esters, respectively. The main metabolites in the glucosiduronic acid fraction were N-hydroxy-N-2-fluorenylacetamide and the 3-, 5-, and 7-hydroxy derivatives, accounting for 5.8, 4.9, 5.5, and 21% of the dose, respectively. Concurrent feeding of chloramphenicol increased the N-hydroxy isomer. The total 14C in liver was alike with and without chloramphenicol. The important finding was that proteins from liver, plasma, and red cells in the chloramphenicol group contained only 32, 58, and 15%, respectively, of the isotope in controls, indicating that binding of the active carcinogenic intermediate to cellular or molecular receptors was inhibited by the antibiotic."
https://openalex.org/W2093742990,"Isolated perfused rat hearts exposed to increased calcium concentrations demonstrated a marked activation of phosphorylase, the maximum occurring about 15 seconds after the peak of the positive inotropic response. These observations provide an explanation for the failure of earlier investigations to demonstrate a significant calcium-induced increase in the active form of phosphorylase in the intact heart."

https://openalex.org/W2017981519,"Regression analysis (analysis of covariance) is contrasted with the conventional ""mean period length"" for estimating the length of period of the spontaneous activity frequency (free-running period) in population samples of Gila monsters (Heloderma suspectum) and kangaroo rats (Dipodomys merriami) in the Sonoran Desert. The mean period length in each population does not differ significantly from 24:00 hours (P > .05) and it does not differ significantly (P > .05) between the species studied; the probability that the free-running period a(in constant dark) in natural populations of Gila monsters and kangaroo rats is different from 24:00.0 is less than 1 in 1000 (P < .001). The so-called ""mean period length"" is of little or no use for precise determination of the period and phase relationships in circadian rhythms; moreover, it is entirely without value for statistical testing of differences either within or between populations."

https://openalex.org/W2071703562,"Saline washings obtained in vivo from the lung of young calves produce pulmonary hypertension upon intrayascular (systemic or pulmonary) injection into either the dog or the calf. This pulmonary hypertension is produced by vasoconstriction of small, precapillary pulmonary vessels. The active agent, pulmonary arterial constrictor substance, differs chemically and physiologically from other substances which have been investigated with respect to vasomotor activity in the pulmonary circulation. Although the chemical nature of the active agent is not known it appears to have a relatively large molecular weight. Whether this agent plays a role in the physiological regulation of the pulmonary circulation is not known."
https://openalex.org/W1569912971,"Abstract It has been shown that, when chloranil is used as electron acceptor in photophosphorylation, phosphorylation has an absolute requirement for molecular oxygen. Although oxygen consumption does proceed in the absence of adenosine diphosphate, the rate of oxygen consumption is doubled in the presence of ADP. The observed P:O and ADP:O ratios at high light intensities are over 3 when chloranil is the acceptor. Under these conditions, the maximum quantum yields at low light intensity for phosphorylation were 0.6, and the quantum yields for electrons (with the use of oxygen as the acceptor) were 1.0. Arguments and data supporting the thesis that chloranil acts only as a noncyclic electron acceptor are given. These high P:O ratios are observed only at low concentrations (approximately 10-8 m) of the oxidized acceptor."
https://openalex.org/W2000566626,The activity of cholinesterase was measured in the plasma of 543 mice of both sexes from 23 inbred mouse strains. Differences between strains were highly significant. The heritability of this characteristic was 0.70 in females and 0.67 in males.

It has no effect when added to the mucosal bathing medium. Oxygen consumption by suspensions of minced bladder tissue is stimulated by the toxin. These effects are neutralized by staphylococcal antitoxin."
https://openalex.org/W1518512267,"Abstract The reduction of 3-methyleneoxindole, a biologically active metabolite of natural plant auxin, to the inert 3-methyloxindole is catalyzed by four or five reduced triphosphopyridine nucleotide-linked enzymes. Two of the reductases, which can be separated completely by column chromatography, exhibit differential sensitivity to the synthetic auxins, 1-naphthaleneacetic acid and 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid. Reductase A is inhibited noncompetitively by 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid which is a weak competitive inhibitor of reductase B. Reductase B, on the other hand, is inhibited competitively by 1-naphthaleneacetic acid, a weak competitive inhibitor of reductase A. Reductase A is labile, losing activity as well as its pH-dependent sensitivity to 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid. Reductase B is stable, and its inhibition by the synthetic auxins is pH independent."
https://openalex.org/W2093223666,"The National Standard Reference Data System is a government-wide effort to give to the technical community of the United States optimum access to the quantitative data of physical science, critically evaluated and compiled for convenience.

After reaching a maximum, the ratio of the specific activity of heme to that of globin remained constant within each hemoglobin. Explanations considered include dilution by preformed subunits, differential turnover of hemoglobins, and possibly more than one heme-synthesizing pool."
