https://openalex.org/W2064614845,"Wilms' tumor 1-associating protein (WTAP) is a putative splicing regulator that is thought to be required for cell cycle progression through the stabilization of cyclin A2 mRNA and mammalian early embryo development. To further understand how WTAP acts in the context of the cellular machinery, we identified its interacting proteins in human umbilical vein endothelial cells and HeLa cells using shotgun proteomics. Here we show that WTAP forms a novel protein complex including Hakai, Virilizer homolog, KIAA0853, RBM15, the arginine/serine-rich domain-containing proteins BCLAF1 and THRAP3, and certain general splicing regulators, most of which have reported roles in post-transcriptional regulation. The depletion of these respective components of the complex resulted in reduced cell proliferation along with G2/M accumulation. Double knockdown of the serine/arginine-rich (SR)-like proteins BCLAF1 and THRAP3 by siRNA resulted in a decrease in the nuclear speckle localization of WTAP, whereas the nuclear speckles were intact. Furthermore, we found that the WTAP complex regulates alternative splicing of the WTAP pre-mRNA by promoting the production of a truncated isoform, leading to a change in WTAP protein expression. Collectively, these findings show that the WTAP complex is a novel component of the RNA processing machinery, implying an important role in both posttranscriptional control and cell cycle regulation."

However, YAP/TAZ independent functions of the Hippo pathway are largely unknown. Here we report a novel role of the Hippo pathway in angiogenesis. Angiomotin p130 isoform (AMOTp130) is phosphorylated on a conserved HXRXXS motif by Lats1/2 downstream of GPCR signaling. Phosphorylation disrupts AMOT interaction with F-actin and correlates with reduced F-actin stress fibers and focal adhesions. Furthermore, phosphorylation of AMOT by Lats1/2 inhibits endothelial cell migration in vitro and angiogenesis in zebrafish embryos in vivo. Thus AMOT is a direct substrate of Lats1/2 mediating functions of the Hippo pathway in endothelial cell migration and angiogenesis.

However, YAP/TAZ-independent functions of the Hippo pathway were poorly studied. lysophosphatidic acid Angiomotin G-protein-coupled receptor p-nitrobenzyl mesylate adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate). Here we report that the angiomotin p130 isoform (AMOTp130) is phosphorylated on a conserved HXRXXS motif by Lats1/2 downstream of GPCR signaling. Phosphorylation disrupts AMOT interaction with F-actin and correlates with reduced F-actin stress fibers and focal adhesions. Furthermore, phosphorylation of AMOT by Lats1/2 inhibits endothelial cell migration in vitro and zebrafish embryonic angiogenesis in vivo. These studies identified AMOT as a critical effector of the Hippo pathway downstream of GPCR signaling in regulation of cell migration and angiogenesis. We obtained anti-AMOT antibodies from Bethyl Lab; anti-Lats1 and anti-Lats2 from Cell Signaling Technologies; anti-GST from Genscript; anti-α-tubulin, anti-Flag, and anti-vinculin from Sigma; anti-thiophosphate ester from Epitomics; anti-HSP90 from BD Biosciences; anti-HA and anti-Myc from Covance; Alexa Fluor 488- or 594-conjugated secondary antibodies and Alexa Fluor 488-phalloidin from Invitrogen; Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies from GE Healthcare. Anti-phosphoAMOTp130 (S175) antibody was generated by immunizing rabbits with phospho-peptide KQGHVRSLS(p)ERL. Human AMOTp130 were subcloned from other vectors into pCMV-Flag, pcDNA3-HA, pGEX-KG, and pQCXIH vectors. Human AMOTp80, mouse AMOTL1 and AMOTL2 were subcloned into pcDNA3-HA and pCMV-Flag vectors. Human AMOTp130 mutants were generated by site-directed mutagenesis. Other plasmids were described before (16Yu F.X. Zhao B. Panupinthu N. Jewell J.L. Lian I. Wang L.H. Zhao J. Yuan H. Tumaneng K.

Phos-tag conjugated acrylamide was purchased from Wako Chemicals. All other chemicals were from Sigma. HEK293, HEK293T, COS7, HEK293P, and HUVEC cells were cultured in DMEM (Invitrogen) containing 10% FBS (Invitrogen) and 50 μg/ml penicillin/streptomycin (P/S). Transfection with Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. For viral infection, HEK293P cells were transfected with viral constructs and packaging plasmids. 48 h later, viral supernatant was supplemented with 5 μg/ml polybrene, filtered through a 0.45 μm filter, and used to infect target cells. For Lats2 kinase assays, HEK293 cells were transfected with indicated plasmids. 48 h post-transfection, cells were lysed with lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES at pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm pyrophosphate, 10 mm glycerophosphate, 50 mm NaF, 1.5 mm Na3VO4, protease inhibitor mixture (Roche), 1 mm DTT, 1 mm PMSF) and immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody. The immunoprecipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer, once with wash buffer (40 mm HEPES, 200 mm NaCl), and once with kinase assay buffer (30 mm HEPES, 50 mm potassium acetate, 5 mm MgCl2). The immunoprecipitated Lats2 was subjected to kinase assay in the presence of 500 μm ATP or ATP-γS and 1 μg of recombinant GST-AMOTp130 purified from Escherichia coli as substrates. The reaction mixtures were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. For detection by anti-thiophosphate-ester antibody, the reaction mixtures were further supplemented with 2.5 mm PNBM. Alkylating reactions were allowed to proceed for 1 h at room temperature. The reactions were terminated with SDS sample buffer and boiled before analysis by SDS-PAGE. Actin Binding Protein Biochem Kit was obtained from Cytoskeleton. The assay was performed following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, F-actin was polymerized and mixed with GST-AMOTp130 proteins purified from E. coli. The mixture was then centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 1.5 h at 24 °C. Supernatants and pellets were then collected and processed for electrophoresis. Proteins were visualized by Coomassie Blue staining or Western blots. Cell migration assay was performed using BD Falcon Cell culture inserts for 24-well plates with 8.0 μm pore size. Bottom sides of filters were pre-coated with 20 mg/ml fibronectin. HUVEC cells were serum-starved for 12 h and then seeded into the upper chambers of the inserts at 4 × 104 cells/well in serum-free medium, and lower chambers were filled with serum-free or 10% FBS-containing medium. After 12 h, cells were stained with 0.5% crystal violet. Cells in upper chambers were carefully removed, and bottom sides of the chambers were pictured. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min and then permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100. Cells may be treated with 100 μg/ml digitonin for 5 min as indicated. After blocking in 2% BSA for 30 min, slides were incubated with first antibody diluted in 1% BSA overnight at 4 °C. After washing with PBS, slides were incubated with Alexa Fluor 488- or 594-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1.5 h. For staining of F-actin, cells were incubated with Alexa Fluor 488-phalloidin for 1.5 h. The slides were then washed and mounted. Short interfering RNA (siRNA) oligonucleotides toward human Lats1, Lats2, AMOT, and control siRNA toward firefly luciferase were transfected into indicated cells using Lipofectamine RNAiMax Reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were analyzed 72 h post-transfection. Zebrafish embryos were produced by pairwise matings, raised at 28.5 °C and staged as described (35Kimmel C.B. Ballard W.W. Kimmel S.R. Ullmann B.

Angiomotin-like proteins associate with and negatively regulate YAP1.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 4364-4370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, we found that Lats2 induced a dramatic electrophoretic mobility shift of AMOTp130 comparable to that of YAP on Phos-tag-containing gels which specifically retards phosphorylated proteins (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, Lats2 also induced dramatic up-shift of other AMOT family proteins AMOTL1 and AMOTL2 (Fig. 1A). The Lats2-induced mobility shift of AMOTp130 was eliminated by treatment of the protein with lambda protein phosphatase (Fig. 1B). In addition, co-transfection of AMOTp130 with other Hippo pathway components Mst2, Sav, Mob, and Lats2 induced AMOTp130 mobility shift in a synergistic manner (Fig. 1C). These experiments indicate that Lats1/2 in the Hippo pathway could induce phosphorylation of AMOT family proteins. We then examined whether Lats2 could phosphorylate AMOT in vitro. In this assay, the kinase utilizes ATP-γS as phosphate donor to generate thiophosphorylated substrate, which in turn reacts with p-nitrobenzyl mesylate (PNBM) to form a thiophosphate-ester (45Shah K. Shokat K.M. A chemical genetic approach for the identification of direct substrates of protein kinases.Methods Mol. Biol. 2003; 233: 253-271PubMed Google Scholar). As detected by a thiophosphate-ester-specific antibody, recombinant AMOTp130 could be phosphorylated by Lats2 in vitro (Fig. 1D). The phosphorylation is more efficient when Mob and Sav were co-transfected. In contrast, the kinase inactive Lats2-KR could not phosphorylate AMOTp130. Thus, Lats2 phosphorylates AMOTp130 both in vitro and in vivo. Previous studies have revealed the optimal Lats1/2 phosphorylation target consensus motif as HXRXXS (22Zhao B. Wei X. Li W. Udan R.S. Yang Q. Kim J. Xie J. Ikenoue T. Yu J. Li L. Zheng P. Ye K. Chinnaiyan A. Halder G. Lai Z.C. Guan K.L.

Interestingly, we found one HXRXXS motif, and one HXKXXS motif, also permissive for phosphorylation by Lats1/2, on AMOTp130 (Fig. 2A). Both motifs are conserved in AMOT family members and across species (Fig. 2A). As shown in Fig. 2B, mutation of Ser-175 in the N-terminal motif to alanine largely repressed Lats2-induced up-shift of AMOTp130, suggesting that this reside is phosphorylated by Lats2. Further mutation of Ser-859 eliminates the mild shift of S175A, suggesting that Ser-859 is also phosphorylated by Lats2. However, individual mutation of Ser-859 did not repress the up-shift possibly due to limited sensitivity of the Phos-tag method. The histidine in the HXRXXS motif is crucial for substrate recognition. Indeed, similar to S175A, mutation of H170 largely abolished AMOTp130 up-shift in response to Lats2 (Fig. 2B). These experiments demonstrate that phosphorylation of Ser-175 is largely responsible for Lats2-induced up-shift of AMOTp130. To further confirm that AMOTp130 Ser-175 is indeed phosphorylated by Lats2, we generated an anti-pAMOT (Ser-175) antibody. As expected, this antibody detected phosphorylation of ectopically expressed AMOTp130, which was markedly enhanced by Lats2 co-expression and eliminated by phosphatase treatment (Fig. 2C). Furthermore, AMOTp130 is phosphorylated on Ser-175 by Lats2 but not Lats2-KR in vitro (Fig. 2D). Thus, AMOTp130 is phosphorylated on Ser-175 by Lats2 in vitro and in vivo. Following identification of the phosphorylation site we further examined the role of the Hippo pathway in physiological regulation of AMOT. Consistent with the inhibition of the Hippo pathway by serum and LPA, these stimulations inhibit endogenous AMOTp130 phosphorylation on Ser-175 (Fig. 2, E and F). LPA in serum represses the Hippo pathway via activation of GPCRs such as LPAR2, and the coupled G-proteins such as Gq and G12 (16Yu F.X. Zhao B. Panupinthu N. Jewell J.L. Lian I. Wang L.H. Zhao J. Yuan H. Tumaneng K. Li H. Fu X.D. Mills G.B. Guan K.L. Regulation of the Hippo-YAP pathway by G-protein-coupled receptor signaling.Cell. 2012; 150: 780-791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1109) Google Scholar). Consistently, expression of LPAR2 or active QL mutants of Gq or G12 potently inhibits endogenous AMOTp130 phosphorylation in serum-deprived cells (Fig. 2G). Furthermore, siRNA knockdown of Lats1 and Lats2 largely eliminates AMOTp130 phosphorylation on Ser-175 in serum-deprived cells (Fig. 2H). Integrity of the actin cytoskeleton is required for GPCR-induced repression of the Hippo pathway (16Yu F.X. Zhao B. Panupinthu N. Jewell J.L. Lian I. Wang L.H. Zhao J. Yuan H. Tumaneng K. Li H.

Indeed, disruption of F-actin induced AMOTp130 phosphorylation in cells cultured in serum-rich medium (Fig. 2I). Taken together, serum and GPCR signaling regulate AMOTp130 phosphorylation on Ser-175 through Lats1/2 kinases. AMOTp130 is known to colocalize with F-actin in cells dependent on its N-terminal domain containing Ser-175 (46Ernkvist M. Aase K. Ukomadu C. Wohlschlegel J. Blackman R. Veitonmäki N. Bratt A. Dutta A. Holmgren L. p130-angiomotin associates to actin and controls endothelial cell shape.FEBS J. 2006; 273: 2000-2011Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). By immunofluorescence staining, we indeed observed colocalization of ectopically expressed AMOTp130 with F-actin filaments (Fig. 3A). At lower expression level of AMOT, the AMOT-F-actin filaments closely resemble actin stress fibers (Fig. 3A). However, at higher expression level, the filaments are thicker possibly represent AMOT-F-actin filament bundles (Fig. 3A, middle panel). In support of a real stress fiber identity of AMOT-F-actin filaments, they are resistant to digitonin treatment before fixation and are anchored to focal adhesions (Fig. 3, B and C). Interestingly, expression of Lats2 disrupted the filamentous AMOTp130 and results in diffused and irregular dots-like localization of AMOT (Fig. 3, A and F). Thus phosphorylation of AMOTp130 on Ser-175 by Lats2 may disrupt AMOT-F-actin interaction. Consistently, the S175A mutant colocalizes with F-actin in a manner insensitive to Lats2 (Fig. 3, D and F). More strikingly, irrespective to Lats2 expression, the phospho-mimetic S175D mutant exhibited dots-like cytoplasmic localization (Fig. 3, E and F). Importantly, using two independent antibodies, we demonstrated that endogenous AMOT colocalizes with F-actin in 293T cells (Fig. 4, A, B, D). The filamentous localization of endogenous AMOT is also disrupted by Lats2 in a kinase-dependent manner (Fig. 4, C and D). These data demonstrate that phosphorylation of AMOTp130 by Lats2 on Ser-175 inhibits AMOTp130-F-actin interaction in vivo.FIGURE 4Phosphorylation inhibits endogenous AMOTp130-F-actin interaction and direct AMOTp130-F-actin interaction in vitro.

B, endogenous AMOT colocalizes with F-actin. Experiments were similar to these in A except that endogenous AMOT was stained with anti-AMOT antibody #2.

Current models consider that Bax and Bak form pores at the mitochondrial outer membrane that are responsible for the release of cytochrome c and other larger mitochondrial apoptotic factors (i.e. Smac/DIABLO, AIF, and endoglycosidase G). However, the properties and nature of Bax/Bak apoptotic pores remain enigmatic. Here, we performed a detailed analysis of the membrane permeabilizing activity of Bax and Bak at the single vesicle level. We directly visualized that cBid-activated Bax and BakΔC21 can form membrane pores large enough to release not only cytochrome c, but also allophycocyanine, a protein of 104 kDa. Interestingly, the size of Bax and BakΔC21 pores is not constant, as typically observed in purely proteinaceous channels, but evolves with time and depends on protein concentration. We found that Bax and BakΔC21 formed long-lived pores, whose areas changed with the amount of Bax/BakΔC21 but not with cardiolipin concentration. Altogether, our results demonstrate that Bax and BakΔC21 follow similar mechanisms of membrane permeabilization characterized by the formation of protein-permeable pores of dynamic size, in agreement with the proteolipidic nature of these apoptotic pores."

The nine members of the tmAC gene family share a common structural organization; they possess 12 transmembrane-spanning domains and localize on the plasma membrane. They differ in their tissue distributions and regulation by other second messengers and kinases (1Kamenetsky M. Middelhaufe S. Bank E.M. Levin L.R. Buck J. Steegborn C. Molecular details of cAMP generation in mammalian cells: a tale of two systems.J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 362: 623-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). In contrast, sAC lacks transmembrane domains and localizes to a variety of subcellular organelles and compartments (2Zippin J.H. Chen Y. Nahirney P. Kamenetsky M. Wuttke M.S. Fischman D.A. Levin L.R.

Due to the ubiquitous presence of carbonic anhydrases, which instantaneously equilibrate HCO3− with carbon dioxide (CO2) and pHi, sAC functions as a physiological CO2/HCO3−/pHi sensor (6Tresguerres M.

As originally described, the in vitro activity of sAC isolated from mammalian testis was thought to require millimolar concentrations of ATP (7Braun T. Purification of soluble form of adenylyl cyclase from testes.Methods Enzymol. 1991; 195: 130-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). After cloning and heterologously expressing sAC, we determined its Km for ATP, under physiological conditions, to be ∼1 mm (4Litvin T.N. Kamenetsky M. Zarifyan A. Buck J. Levin L.R.

Because intracellular ATP concentrations are in the millimolar range, we hypothesized that intracellular sAC activity and cAMP generation should be affected by even small physiologically relevant fluctuations of ATP. β cells secrete insulin in response to an elevation of blood glucose. This glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) requires glycolytic and mitochondrial oxidative glucose metabolism (8Jensen M.V. Joseph J.W. Ronnebaum S.M. Burgess S.C. Sherry A.D. Newgard C.B. Metabolic cycling in control of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion.Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2008; 295: E1287-E1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). In β cells, glucose metabolism is coupled to an increase in the cytosolic ATP/ADP concentration ratio, which leads to the closure of ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) channels. KATP channel closure depolarizes the cell membrane, leading to an influx of Ca2+, which triggers insulin secretory granule exocytosis. Metabolism of glucose also produces CO2 from the decarboxylation of pyruvate and the subsequent metabolism of acetyl-CoA in the Krebs cycle. Thus, glucose metabolism in β cells leads to the production of three intracellular signaling messengers (CO2, ATP, and Ca2+) that are able to regulate sAC activity (9Ramos L.S. Zippin J.H. Kamenetsky M. Buck J. Levin L.R. Glucose and GLP-1 stimulate cAMP production via distinct adenylyl cyclases in INS-1E insulinoma cells.J. Gen.

We demonstrated previously that sAC is present in β cell-like insulinoma INS-1E cells and that it is responsible for generating cAMP in response to elevated glucose (9Ramos L.S. Zippin J.H. Kamenetsky M. Buck J. Levin L.R. Glucose and GLP-1 stimulate cAMP production via distinct adenylyl cyclases in INS-1E insulinoma cells.J. Gen. Physiol. 2008; 132: 329-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). We further showed that the glucose-dependent influx of Ca2+ is essential for sAC activation. Here, we explored whether intracellular sAC activity may also be sensitive to intracellular fluctuations in ATP. To create stably sAC-transfected HEK293 cells, HEK293 cells were transfected with plasmid containing the sACt cDNA (12Buck J. Sinclair M.L. Schapal L. Cann M.J. Levin L.R. Cytosolic adenylyl cyclase defines a unique signaling molecule in mammals.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 79-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar) and placed under selection pressure with gentamycin. After selection, single clones were established via dilution. Once single clones were grown for multiple generations, gentamycin was removed from the medium. Overexpression of sACt was periodically confirmed by Western blot or activity assay. INS-1E cells were cultured as described previously (13Merglen A. Theander S. Rubi B. Chaffard G. Wollheim C.B. Maechler P. Glucose sensitivity and metabolism-secretion coupling studied during two-year continuous culture in INS-1E insulinoma cells.Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 667-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). Adenylyl cyclase activity was measured in whole cell extracts (50 μg of protein) from HEK293 or sAC-stable cell lines in buffer containing 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) in the presence of 1 mm ATP, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.5 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX) with or without 25 mm NaHCO3 or 50 μm forskolin (FSK) for 15 min at 30 °C. cAMP generated was quantitated by enzyme immunoassay-correlate ELISA (Enzo Life Sciences). For inhibition of ATP production, HEK293 or sAC-stable cell lines were treated for 10 min with the indicated drugs in the presence of 0.5 mm IBMX. For glucose stimulation of HEK293 and sAC-stable cell lines, cells were starved of glucose by incubation in glucose-free DMEM for 1 h prior to the experiment, and then at time 0, cells were changed into DMEM containing the indicated amount of glucose in the presence of 0.5 mm IBMX. Intracellular ATP was measured using exogenously supplied luciferase and luciferin (Promega). The intracellular cAMP concentration was measured in the same lysate using enzyme immunoassay-correlate ELISA. To measure cAMP accumulation due to the addition of HCO3− (see Fig. 1B), cells are grown in HEPES-buffered DMEM under ambient CO2 for 1 h prior to HCO3− addition (and growth in 5% CO2). Insulin release from INS-1E cells was performed as described previously (14Antinozzi P.A. Ishihara H. Newgard C.B. Wollheim C.B. Mitochondrial metabolism sets the maximal limit of fuel-stimulated insulin secretion in a model pancreatic beta cell. A survey of four fuel secretagogues.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11746-11755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). INS-1E cells were incubated for 1 h in Krebs-Ringer buffer/HEPES in the presence of 2.5 mm glucose, followed by incubation in Krebs-Ringer buffer/HEPES with 2.5 or 16 mm glucose in the presence of either the vehicle control (Me2SO or methanol) or the indicated addition. Secreted insulin was measured by insulin ELISA (LINCO). If cAMP was to be concomitantly measured, 0.5 mm IBMX was included in all incubations. RNAi oligonucleotides were purchased from Qiagen (high performance 2-for-1 silencing) and reconstituted at 20 μm following the manufacturer's instructions. The sAC2 RNAi oligonucleotide (TCGGAGCATGATTGAAATCGA) was transfected into INS-1E cells using Opti-MEM I (Gene Therapy Systems). Western analysis was performed using anti-sAC monoclonal antibody R21. The same membrane was stripped and reprobed with anti-actin antisera for normalization. Band intensities were quantitated using the Alpha Innotech FluorChem imaging system and normalized to actin. Control (non-specific oligonucleotide) lane intensity was set to 100%; duplicate transfections were averaged. Because metabolic phenotypes are often affected by multiple genetic loci and are sensitive to strain differences, we backcrossed the Sacytm1Lex allele into the C57BL/6 genetic background and analyzed mutant mice following the 10th generation of backcrossing; we refer to these mice (i.e. Sacytm1Lex/Sacytm1Lex in the C57BL/6 genetic background) as sAC-C1 KO mice. WT and sAC KO C57BL/6 mice were used and allowed food and water ad libitum. After CO2 asphyxiation, the pancreases were surgically removed, and the islets were isolated by collagenase digestion. The islets were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium with 11.1 mm glucose for 24 h prior to use. Krebs-Ringer buffer/HEPES containing 129 mmol/liter NaCl, 5 mmol/liter NaHCO3, 4.8 mmol/liter KCl, 1.2 mmol/liter KH2PO4, 2.5 mmol/liter CaCl2, 1.2 mmol/liter MgSO4, and 10 mmol/liter HEPES (pH 7.4) supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin was used for the studies. 20 islets were placed into each of the 70-μl perifusion chambers. An equilibration period of 30 min of perifusion with Krebs-Ringer buffer and 5 mmol/liter glucose at 37 °C was followed by the test period. Samples for insulin measurement were collected at 1-min intervals at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Insulin in the perifusate samples was measured by radioimmunoassay using a charcoal separation method (15Herbert V. Lau K.S. Gottlieb C.W. Bleicher S.J. Coated charcoal immunoassay of insulin.J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1965; 25: 1375-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (2564) Google Scholar). After a 14–16-h overnight fast with free access to water, adult (3–7 months old) male sAC-C1 KO mice (Sacytm1Lex/Sacytm1Lex) and heterozygous littermates (Sacytm1Lex/Sacy+) were injected intraperitoneally with 1 g/kg glucose (20% solution), and blood was collected from the tail vein to measure glucose and insulin. Body fat, lean tissue, and body water were determined via quantitative magnetic resonance (16Tinsley F.C. Taicher G.Z. Heiman M.L. Evaluation of a quantitative magnetic resonance method for mouse whole body composition analysis.Obes. Res. 2004; 12: 150-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Gross necroscopy was performed on six WT, six heterozygous, and six sAC-C1 KO mice (three males and three females of each genotype). Pancreases from WT and sAC-C1 KO mice were fixed in 10% formalin and embedded in paraffin. Sections were immunostained using anti-insulin antibody (Cell Signaling) at 1:400 in heat induced epitope retrieval solution 1 (HIER1, Leica Microsystems) and visualized using alkaline phosphatase with mixed red substrate. Thus far, characterization of sAC adenylyl cyclase activity has examined its in vitro activity using either native sAC protein purified or immunoprecipitated from testis (3Jaiswal B.S. Conti M.

These studies demonstrated that the affinity of sAC for its substrate ATP is ∼1 mm, which is close to the levels found inside cells (18Traut T.W. Physiological concentrations of purines and pyrimidines.Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 140: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar). To examine whether cellular sAC activity might be sensitive to fluctuations of ATP inside cells, we required a cellular system in which we could measure cAMP generation due to sAC. In most cells and tissues, sAC is expressed alongside tmACs, making it difficult to discern the specific contribution of sAC to total cAMP generation. The only exceptions are male germ cells and testis cytosol (19Esposito G. Jaiswal B.S. Xie F. Krajnc-Franken M.A. Robben T.J. Strik A.M. Kuil C. Philipsen R.L. van Duin M. Conti M. Gossen J.A.

Therefore, to specifically study sAC-dependent cAMP synthesis in a cellular context, we generated three independent stable cell lines overexpressing the sACt isoform (12Buck J. Sinclair M.L.

Chem. 2001; 276: 31698-31708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). We overexpressed sAC in HEK293 cells, which are not known to generate cAMP in response to changes in ATP. Overexpression of sAC protein in stable clones was demonstrated by Western blotting (data not shown) and by cyclase assay (Fig. 1A). The basal in vitro cAMP-producing activity in whole cell extracts of the parental HEK293 cells was insensitive to HCO3− addition but was stimulated by the tmAC-specific activator FSK (Fig. 1A). This FSK-stimulated activity was detectable at MgATP concentrations starting at 10 μm, commensurate with the known affinities of tmACs for substrate (their Km values for MgATP are ∼100 μm) (1Kamenetsky M. Middelhaufe S. Bank E.M. Levin L.R. Buck J. Steegborn C. Molecular details of cAMP generation in mammalian cells: a tale of two systems.J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 362: 623-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). In whole cell extracts of the three stable sACt-overexpressing clones, the basal activities were elevated relative to those in parental HEK293 cells and were potently stimulated by the addition of HCO3−. The basal and HCO3−-stimulated activities in each clone were first observed as ATP levels reached 100 μm and increased with ATP concentrations up to 10 mm (the highest value used) without reaching a plateau. Thus, the contribution of sAC to cAMP generation, reflected in the elevated basal and bicarbonate-stimulated activities in sAC-overexpressing stables, required at least 10-fold higher ATP concentrations compared with tmACs, consistent with the relatively high Km of sAC for ATP (4Litvin T.N. Kamenetsky M. Zarifyan A. Buck J. Levin L.R. Kinetic properties of “soluble” adenylyl cyclase. Synergism between calcium and bicarbonate.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15922-15926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Of note, when assayed in whole cell lysates, the stably overexpressed sACt isoform did not show inhibition at high ATP concentrations (in excess of 5 mm) as observed with purified sACt (4Litvin T.N. Kamenetsky M. Zarifyan A. Buck J. Levin L.R. Kinetic properties of “soluble” adenylyl cyclase. Synergism between calcium and bicarbonate.J. Biol.

The cellular levels of cAMP are determined by the balance between synthesizing adenylyl cyclases and catabolizing phosphodiesterases. Therefore, to measure cyclase activity in intact cells, we measured cAMP accumulation over 10 min in the presence of the broad specificity phosphodiesterase inhibitor IBMX. The parental HEK293 cells accumulated <1 pmol of cAMP/2.5 × 105 cells/10 min, and this activity was insensitive to the addition of HCO3− (Fig. 1B). In agreement with the in vitro cyclase assay results, under the same conditions, the cAMP accumulation in each of the sAC-overexpressing cell lines was 2–5 pmol of cAMP/2.5 × 105 cells/10 min, and this activity was stimulated by the addition of HCO3−. The tmAC-specific activator FSK stimulated the cAMP accumulation in HEK293 cells to ∼6 pmol of cAMP/2.5 × 105 cells/10 min. Thus, in each of the three independent sAC-stable cell lines, cAMP accumulation reflects predominantly the contribution of sAC, whereas the FSK-stimulated cAMP accumulation in the parental HEK293 cells reflects almost exclusively tmAC-generated cAMP. To study the effect of intracellular ATP concentration fluctuations on the activity of the different forms of adenylyl cyclase, we measured cAMP accumulation when cellular ATP levels were diminished. The pharmacological ATP synthase inhibitor oligomycin lowered intracellular ATP levels in both parental and sAC-overexpressing cells, with a similar dose dependence (Fig. 2A). Although FSK-stimulated cAMP accumulation in parental cells (which reflects tmAC activity) was not appreciably affected (Fig. 2B, black line), cAMP accumulation in the sAC-stable clones (which reflects predominantly cellular sAC activity) decreased (Fig. 2B, red lines) in concert with the decrease in intracellular ATP (Fig. 2A). We confirmed that the decreased sAC-dependent accumulation was due to alterations in ATP by using other means of inhibiting ATP production. 2-Deoxyglucose inhibits glycolysis, whereas rotenone and azide inhibit Complexes I and IV of the respiratory chain, respectively. In all cases, down-regulation of intracellular ATP diminished the accumulation of cAMP in sAC-overexpressing cell lines (i.e. sAC-dependent cAMP accumulation) while leaving the levels of FSK-stimulated cAMP accumulation in HEK293 cells (i.e. tmAC-dependent cAMP) virtually unchanged (Fig. 2, C–H). Thus, consistent with its in vitro affinity for its substrate ATP, cellular sAC activity is sensitive to changes in intracellular ATP levels, whereas tmACs, which exhibit much higher affinities for substrate ATP, appear to be insensitive to these fluctuations in intracellular ATP. sAC activity in the sAC-overexpressing cells also responded to glucose-induced increases in intracellular ATP. Feeding glucose to starved parental or sAC-overexpressing cells raised the intracellular ATP concentration (Fig. 3A). Although this increase had no effect on FSK-stimulated cAMP levels in parental HEK293 cells, feeding glucose to starved sAC-overexpressing cells resulted in a 2-fold elevation of cAMP accumulation (Fig. 3B). Thus, overexpressing CO2/HCO3−-, ATP-, and Ca2+-responsive sAC converted cells that do not modulate cAMP in response to glucose (i.e. HEK293 cells) into glucose-responsive cells. Interestingly, the ATP levels in the sAC-overexpressing cell lines were elevated relative to those in the parental HEK293 cells (Fig. 3A); this could reflect a contribution from increased expression of intramitochondrial sAC, which has been shown to stimulate ATP production (23Acin-Perez R.

We next explored whether sAC might sense physiologically relevant changes in ATP in pancreatic β cells, which are naturally glucose-responsive. In high glucose, β cells have elevated ATP and cAMP levels (10Tengholm A. Cyclic AMP dynamics in the pancreatic β-cell.Ups. J. Med.

Physiol. 2008; 132: 329-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). As expected, in high glucose, the ATP levels were sensitive to the respiratory chain inhibitor azide (Fig. 4A), and similar to the cAMP generated in sAC-overexpressing HEK293 cells, diminishing ATP levels with azide also blunted the cAMP accumulation (Fig. 4B) and insulin release (Fig. 4C) in INS-1E cells. Although the sAC-specific inhibitor KH7 inhibits glucose-dependent cAMP (9Ramos L.S. Zippin J.H. Kamenetsky M. Buck J. Levin L.R.

Physiol. 2008; 132: 329-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), it did not alter the azide-insensitive cAMP pool (Fig. 4D), suggesting that sAC is responsible for ATP-dependent cAMP generation. We showed previously that the glucose-induced cAMP generation in INS-1E cells due to sAC is dependent on the Ca2+ influx subsequent to KATP channel closure (9Ramos L.S. Zippin J.H. Kamenetsky M.

Cyclic AMP dynamics in the pancreatic β-cell.Ups. J. Med. Sci. 2012; 117: 355-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), and we showed previously that KCl-induced Ca2+ influx is sufficient to activate sAC (9Ramos L.S. Zippin J.H. Kamenetsky M. Buck J.

In high glucose, KCl addition did not further stimulate cAMP accumulation (Fig. 4B) or insulin release (Fig. 4C) presumably because INS-1E cells are maximally depolarized. Reducing ATP levels with azide, which will diminish glucose-dependent depolarization, allowed KCl addition to enhance cAMP accumulation and insulin release. However, the sAC-dependent cAMP accumulation was still dependent on cellular ATP levels. The addition of ≥2 mm azide completely blocked the KCl-dependent depolarization-induced cAMP accumulation (Fig. 4B). Thus, in β cell-like INS-1E cells, glucose-stimulated sAC activity is dependent on both Ca2+ (9Ramos L.S. Zippin J.H. Kamenetsky M. Buck J. Levin L.R.

The structural features of pectin involved in this activity remain unclear. We investigated the effects of different ginseng pectins on galectin-3 action. The rhamnogalacturonan I-rich pectin fragment, RG-I-4, potently inhibited galectin-3-mediated hemagglutination, cancer cell adhesion and homotypic aggregation, and binding of galectin-3 to T-cells. RG-I-4 specifically bound to the carbohydrate recognition domain of galectin-3 with a dissociation constant of 22.2 nm, which was determined by surface plasmon resonance analysis. The structure-activity relationship of RG-I-4 was investigated by modifying the structure through various enzymatic and chemical methods followed by activity tests. The results showed that (a) galactan side chains were essential to the activity of RG-I-4, whereas arabinan side chains positively or negatively regulated the activity depending on their location within the RG-I-4 molecule. (b) The activity of galactan chain was proportional to its length up to 4 Gal residues and largely unchanged thereafter. (c) The majority of galactan side chains in RG-I-4 were short with low activities. (d) The high activity of RG-I-4 resulted from the cooperative action of these side chains. (e) The backbone of the molecule was very important to RG-I-4 activity, possibly by maintaining a structural conformation of the whole molecule. (f) The isolated backbone could bind galectin-3, which was insensitive to lactose treatment. The novel discovery that the side chains and backbone play distinct roles in regulating RG-I-4 activity is valuable for producing highly active pectin-based galectin-3 inhibitors."

It has been shown that TGF-β1 treatment decreases the invasiveness of trophoblast cells. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying TGF-β1-decreased trophoblast invasion are still not fully understood. In the current study, we demonstrated that treatment of HTR-8/SVneo human trophoblast cells with TGF-β1 decreased cell invasion and down-regulated the expression of vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin). In addition, the inhibitory effect of TGF-β1 on VE-cadherin was confirmed in primary cultures of human trophoblast cells. Moreover, knockdown of VE-cadherin using siRNA decreased the invasiveness of HTR-8/SVneo cells and primary cultures of trophoblast cells. Treatment with TGF-β1 induced the activation of Smad-dependent signaling pathways and the expression of Snail and Slug. Knockdown of Smads attenuated TGF-β1-induced up-regulation of Snail and Slug and down-regulation of VE-cadherin. Interestingly, depletion of Snail, but not Slug, attenuated TGF-β1-induced down-regulation of VE-cadherin. Furthermore, overexpression of Snail suppressed VE-cadherin expression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses showed the direct binding of Snail to the VE-cadherin promoter. These results provide evidence that Snail mediates TGF-β1-induced down-regulation of VE-cadherin, which subsequently contributed to TGF-β1-decreased trophoblast cell invasion."
https://openalex.org/W2005368083,"Post-translational modifications of histones including methylation play important roles in cell differentiation. Jumonji domain-containing 3 (Jmjd3) is a histone demethylase, which specifically catalyzes the removal of trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27me3). In this study, we examined the expression of Jmjd3 in osteoblasts and its roles in osteoblast differentiation. Jmjd3 expression in the nucleus was induced in response to the stimulation of osteoblast differentiation as well as treatment of bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2). Either treatment with Noggin, an inhibitor of BMP-2, or silencing of Smad1/5 suppressed Jmjd3 expression during osteoblast differentiation. Silencing of Jmjd3 expression suppressed osteoblast differentiation through the expression of bone-related genes including Runx2, osterix, osteopontin, bone sialoprotein (BSP), and osteocalcin (OCN). Silencing of Jmjd3 decreased the promoter activities of Runx2 and osterix and increased the level of H3K27me3 on the promoter regions of Runx2 and osterix. Introduction of the exogenous Runx2 and osterix partly rescued osteoblast differentiation in the shJmjd3 cells. The present results indicate that Jmjd3 plays important roles in osteoblast differentiation and regulates the expressions of BSP and OCN via transcription factors Runx2 and osterix."
https://openalex.org/W2047491209,"Pulses of insulin released from pancreatic β-cells maintain blood glucose in a narrow range, although the source of these pulses is unclear. We and others have proposed that positive feedback mediated by the glycolytic enzyme phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK1) enables β-cells to generate metabolic oscillations via autocatalytic activation by its product fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (FBP). Although much indirect evidence has accumulated in favor of this hypothesis, a direct measurement of oscillating glycolytic intermediates has been lacking. To probe glycolysis directly, we engineered a family of inter- and intramolecular FRET biosensors based on the glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase M2 (PKAR; pyruvate kinase activity reporter), which multimerizes and is activated upon binding FBP. When introduced into Min6 β-cells, PKAR FRET efficiency increased rapidly in response to glucose. Importantly, however, metabolites entering downstream of PFK1 (glyceraldehyde, pyruvate, and ketoisocaproate) failed to activate PKAR, consistent with sensor activation by FBP; the dependence of PKAR on FBP was further confirmed using purified sensor in vitro. Using a novel imaging modality for monitoring mitochondrial flavin fluorescence in mouse islets, we show that slow oscillations in mitochondrial redox potential stimulated by 10 mm glucose are in phase with glycolytic efflux through PKM2, measured simultaneously from neighboring islet β-cells expressing PKAR.

Unlike the other isoforms, the catalytic activity of PKM2 is directly linked to the enzyme's quaternary structure; tetrameric PKM2 has high catalytic activity, whereas monomeric and dimeric PKM2 have low catalytic activity (32Mazurek S.

The highly active tetrameric state of PKM2 is primarily increased in proportion to allosteric activation by FBP (34Ashizawa K. Willingham M.C. Liang C.M. Cheng S.Y.

FBP can also overcome the inhibition by allosteric inhibitors of PKM2 such as phenylalanine and other amino acids (36Ikeda Y. Noguchi T.

U.S.A. 2013; 110: 5881-5886Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). To determine whether glycolytic oscillations occur in β-cells, we designed a family of genetically encoded FRET biosensors to measure PKM2 oligomerization in living cells as a direct monitor of allosteric regulation by FBP and activity. We reasoned that if PFK1-mediated oscillations in FBP occur in response to glucose stimulation, then these should in turn trigger cycles of PKM2 activity as FBP induces tetramerization and concomitant FRET activity. We also introduce two new imaging modalities to measure mitochondrial flavin fluorescence, a high throughput and a high sensitivity measurement, with the latter being capable of resolving even small high frequency oscillations superimposed upon slower mitochondrial redox oscillations. Using these techniques in combination, we demonstrate that islet PKM2 activity is not only oscillatory but is also synchronized between the β-cells of an islet and in phase with mitochondrial redox potential. Human PKM2 and PKM1 were cloned from a cDNA library (Invitrogen) into pENTR-DS (SalI/XhoI) using the In-Fusion cloning system (Clontech). ClonaseII/Gateway (Invitrogen) was then used to transfer full-length PKM2 into acceptor vectors containing monomeric pH-insensitive variants of GFP (pD-CeruleanN, pD-CitrineN, pD-CeruleanC, pD-CitrineC) (19Merrins M.J.

Phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase modulates oscillations of pancreatic islet metabolism.PLoS ONE. 2012; 7: e34036Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), yielding the single-chain pyruvate kinase activity reporter (PKAR) constructs (pG-Cerulean-PKM2, pG-Citrine-PKM2, pG-PKM2-Cerulean, pG-PKM2-Citrine). Finally, the multichain PKARs (pG-Cerulean-PKM2-Citrine, pG-Citrine-PKM2-Cerulean) were constructed by adding an N-terminal (HindIII/KpnI digest) or C-terminal (SacII/AgeI digest) fluorophore using the In-Fusion cloning system; substitution of circularly permuted Cerulean3 (cpCerulean3), yielding pG-Citrine-PKM2-cpCerulean3 and pG-cpCerulean3-PKM2-Citrine, was performed using the same sites. The linker regions of PKAR were initially formed from the attB sites inherent to the Gateway system and were modified as described in Table 1 using PCR mutagenesis. For yeast expression, Citrine-PKM2-cpCerulean3 was subcloned into NdeI/XhoI of pGADT7-myc (Clontech), yielding pGAD-T7-myc-Citrine-PKM2-cpCerulean3. For expression in pancreatic islet β-cells, myc-Citrine-PKM2-cpCerulean3 was cloned downstream of the rat insulin promoter and rabbit β-globin1 intron (RIP-BGI) (38Ravier M.A. Daro D. Roma L.P.

Mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation according to the regulations of the University of Michigan Committee on the Use and Care of Animals, who approved this study (protocol 10147). Islets were isolated from the pancreas (21Merrins M.J. Fendler B. Zhang M. Sherman A. Bertram R. Satin L.S.

Groups of 25 freshly isolated islets were immediately infected with 2000 multiplicity of infection of adenovirus for 1.5 h in a 95/5% air/CO2 incubator at 37 °C followed by fresh culture media lacking virus. Imaging was performed 2–3 days after infection. For NAD(P)H/flavin (365/430 nm excitation) or Fura2 (340/380 nm excitation) imaging, excitation from a Polychrome V monochrometer (Till Photonics) was passed through a 430HSP exciter (Omega), 458LP dichroic (Semrock), and D500/100m emitter (Chroma) mounted in an IX71 microscope (Olympus) equipped with a 0.3 NA UPlanFL 10× objective. For measurements of intracellular Ca2+, islets were preloaded with 2.5 μm Fura2-AM (Molecular Probes) in 0.1% (v/v) DMSO for 30 min at 37 °C and washed for 10 min before recording; Ca2+ is reported as the emission ratio R340/380. The recording solution contained 145 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 2.6 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES and glucose as indicated, pH 7.4, 310 milliosmolar. Exposure times were 50–150 ms at 0.2 Hz, the excitation bandwidth was 15 nm (FWHM), the camera's (QuantEM, Photometrics) and electron multiplication gain was 100–200, controlled with MetaFluor software (Molecular Devices). Min6 cells (39Miyazaki J. Araki K. Yamato E. Ikegami H. Asano T. Shibasaki Y. Oka Y. Yamamura K. Establishment of a pancreatic beta cell line that retains glucose-inducible insulin secretion. Special reference to expression of glucose transporter isoforms.Endocrinology. 1990; 127: 126-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar) were cultured in DMEM, 15% (v/v) FBS, 285 μm β-mercaptoethanol, 100 unit/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin and kept at 37 °C under 5% CO2. FRET studies in Min6 cells were performed using a 1.4 NA UPlanSApo 100X oil immersion objective (Olympus). For these experiments, 436-nm (Cerulean or cpCerulean3) and 500-nm (Citrine) excitation was passed through a dual pass excitation filter (430/24; 500/20) and polychroic mirror (89006bs, Chroma, Brattleboro, VT), and emission was passed through a DualView2 beamsplitter (Photometrics) containing a dichroic mirror (T495LPXR) and emission filters (ET470/24m and ET535/30m) (Chroma) to allow simultaneous two-channel monitoring of donor and acceptor emission. All analyses of acquired images were performed using Metamorph/MetaFluor (Molecular Devices). A linked Cerulean-Citrine reference construct of known FRET efficiency (0.3014) (40Hoppe A. Christensen K. Swanson J.A. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based stoichiometry in living cells.Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 3652-3664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) was used for calibration in each experiment. Cells expressing Cerulean or Citrine alone were used to generate correction constants for cross-talk (α) and spectral bleed-through (β). The apparent efficiency of acceptor (Citrine) in complex (EA), the apparent efficiency of donor (Cerulean or cpCerulean3) in complex (ED), and the mole fraction of acceptor to donor (ratio) values were determined using the following equations: EA = γ[((DA − βDD)/αAA) − 1](1/EC); ED = [1 − (DD/((DA − αAA − βDD)(ξ/γ) + DD))](1/EC), ratio = (ξ/γ2)[αAA/((DA − αAA − βDD)(ξ/γ) + DD)], where DD is donor excitation-donor emission. DA is donor excitation-acceptor emission, AA is acceptor excitation-acceptor emission, and EC is characteristic efficiency (0.3014). For multichain biosensors we report %E as (EA + ED)/2; in the single-chain biosensors, EA = ED. The filter sets used were identical to those used for the calculation of FRET efficiency. In this case, 436-nm excitation was passed through a 1.2 NA UPlanSApo 60× water immersion objective, and emission was collected as the ratio of the ET535/30m and ET470/24m channels (R535/470). Camera electron multiplication was turned off to reduce multiplicative noise. A 40% neutral density filter in the ET535/30m emission channel compensated for the 2.5-fold brightness of Citrine relative to Cerulean. In cases where flavin fluorescence was recorded without a FRET probe present, R470/535 was reported because this ratio is directly proportional to the cellular redox potential. Saccharomyces cerevisiae (LS41), containing pGADT7-myc or pGADT7-myc-PKAR2.3 were grown under semi-aerobic conditions at 30 °C on a rotary shaker in media containing 1.7 g liter−1 yeast nitrogen base, 5 g liter−1 ammonium sulfate, 2% glucose (w/v), and 2 g of yeast dropout base (−Leu). At A660 = 2 the cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed twice with PBS pH 7.4, starved by incubating at 30 °C for 3 h, and stored on ice (A660 = 2) until use. Oscillations were induced by adding 30 mm glucose to the starved cells and after 4 min adding 5 mm KCN (11Richard P. Diderich J.A. Bakker B.M. Teusink B. van Dam K. Westerhoff H.V. Yeast cells with a specific cellular make-up and an environment that removes acetaldehyde are prone to sustained glycolytic oscillations.FEBS Lett. 1994; 341: 223-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Imaging of NAD(P)H and PKAR was performed immediately by pipetting 2 ml of diluted yeast suspension into a 35-mm glass bottom chamber (World Precision Instruments). These experiments employed a 1.2 NA UPlanSApo 60× water immersion objective. Alternating 365-nm (NAD(P)H) and 430-nm (PKAR FRET) light was passed through a 430HSP exciter (Omega Optical) and a 458LP dichroic mirror (Semrock); FRET was collected as the ratio of the ET535/30m and ET470/24m channels (R535/470), and NAD(P)H emission was collected in the ET470/24m channel of the DualView2. Immunoprecipitation of PKM2 was carried out as in Anastasiou et al. (41Anastasiou D. Poulogiannis G. Asara J.M. Boxer M.B. Jiang J.K. Shen M. Bellinger G. Sasaki A.T. Locasale J.W. Auld D.S.

Inhibition of pyruvate kinase M2 by reactive oxygen species contributes to cellular antioxidant responses.Science. 2011; 334: 1278-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar), except that FRET imaging was used in place of the Western blot. HEK293T cells were transiently transfected with pC-myc-PKAR2.3 and pC-PKAR2.3 or reference constructs for calculation of FRET efficiency (pC-myc-Cerulean, pC-myc-Citrine, or pC-myc-Cerulean-Citrine). After 2 days expression, the cells were rinsed twice in PBS, scraped into PK lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Igepal CA630, and Roche Complete Protease Inhibitors) and lysed with 10 sonicating pulses (1 s−1, 0.5 Hz). Lysates were placed on ice for 30 min and then centrifuged for 10 min at 18,000 × g at 4 °C. Supernatants were pooled, at which time rabbit antibodies to myc (ICL) and protein A-agarose beads (Invitrogen) were added, and the samples were re-divided for treatment with either vehicle, 200 μm FBP, or 10 mm serine. After overnight incubation at 4 °C, samples were washed 3 times with PK lysis buffer and once in PK assay buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, Roche Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitors, and vehicle, FBP, or serine) before imaging the beads using a 0.7 NA 20× water objective and the FRET filter sets described above. The extent of PKAR-PKAR oligomerization (Binding) was calculated as the normalized fluorescence intensity in response to direct excitation of Citrine (500 nm), which is unaffected by FRET. FRET Efficiency was calculated from the images, as described above. The structure of PKM2 is directly linked to its catalytic activity; tetrameric PKM2 is highly active, whereas the dimeric or monomeric forms are inactive at any physiological concentration of phosphoenolpyruvate (32Mazurek S. Pyruvate kinase type M2. A key regulator of the metabolic budget system in tumor cells.Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2011; 43: 969-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). The design principle of PKAR takes advantage of this structural requirement for catalysis. As depicted in Fig. 1A, multichain PKARs consist of PKM2 monomers labeled with either Cerulean or Citrine. Upon activation by FBP, dimers of PKM2 tetramerize, bringing their fluorophores within close proximity and thereby increasing FRET. It is important to note that dimeric and tetrameric sensors contain a mixture of probe combinations; donor-acceptor combinations are ideal, donor-donor and acceptor-acceptor interactions are not measurable, and donors that interact with multiple acceptors yield surplus energy transfer (42Koushik S.V. Blank P.S. Vogel S.S. Anomalous surplus energy transfer observed with multiple FRET acceptors.PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e8031Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Therefore, the average change in FRET for all possible combinations is measured. Homology modeling of the apo and FBP-bound PKM2 crystal structures (43Christofk H.R. Vander Heiden M.G. Wu N.

https://openalex.org/W2031250543,"Pancreatic β-cells secrete insulin in response to metabolic and hormonal signals to maintain glucose homeostasis. Insulin secretion is under the control of ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels that play key roles in setting β-cell membrane potential. Leptin, a hormone secreted by adipocytes, inhibits insulin secretion by increasing KATP channel conductance in β-cells. We investigated the mechanism by which leptin increases KATP channel conductance. We show that leptin causes a transient increase in surface expression of KATP channels without affecting channel gating properties. This increase results primarily from increased channel trafficking to the plasma membrane rather than reduced endocytosis of surface channels. The effect of leptin on KATP channels is dependent on the protein kinases AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and PKA. Activation of AMPK or PKA mimics and inhibition of AMPK or PKA abrogates the effect of leptin. Leptin activates AMPK directly by increasing AMPK phosphorylation at threonine 172. Activation of PKA leads to increased channel surface expression even in the presence of AMPK inhibitors, suggesting AMPK lies upstream of PKA in the leptin signaling pathway. Leptin signaling also leads to F-actin depolymerization. Stabilization of F-actin pharmacologically occludes, whereas destabilization of F-actin simulates, the effect of leptin on KATP channel trafficking, indicating that leptin-induced actin reorganization underlies enhanced channel trafficking to the plasma membrane. Our study uncovers the signaling and cellular mechanism by which leptin regulates KATP channel trafficking to modulate β-cell function and insulin secretion."

Data from a number of pain models showed significant up-regulation of VGF in sensory neurons.

However, the precise role of VGF-derived neuropeptides in neuropathic pain and the molecular identity of the receptor for VGF-derived peptides are yet to be investigated. Here we identified gC1qR, the globular heads of the C1q receptor, as the receptor for TLQP-21 using chemical cross-linking combined with mass spectrometry analysis. TLQP-21 caused an increase in intracellular Ca2+ levels in rat macrophages and microglia. Inoculation of TLQP-21-stimulated macrophages into rat hind paw caused mechanical hypersensitivity. The increase in intracellular Ca2+ levels in macrophages was attenuated by either siRNA or neutralizing antibodies against gC1qR. Furthermore, application of the gC1qR-neutralizing antibody to rats with partial sciatic nerve ligation resulted in a delayed onset of nerve injury-associated mechanical hypersensitivity. These results indicate that gC1qR is the receptor for TLQP-21 and plays an important role in chronic pain through activation of macrophages. Because direct association between TLQP-21 and gC1qR is required for activation of macrophages and causes hypersensitivity, disrupting this interaction may be a useful new approach to develop novel analgesics.

Information about its genetic diversity and population structure is essential for rice breeding and efficient control of the disease. This study compared the genome sequences of two U. virens isolates. Three SNP-rich genomic regions were identified as molecular markers that could be used to analyze the genetic diversity and population structure of U. virens in China. A total of 56 multilocus sequence types (haplotypes) were identified out of 162 representative isolates from 15 provinces covering five major rice-growing areas in China. However, the phylogeny, based on sequences at individual SNP-rich regions, strongly conflicted with each other and there were significant genetic differences between different geographical populations. Gene flow between the different geographical populations and genetic differentiation within each geographical population were also detected. In addition, genetic recombination and genetic isolation resulting from geographic separation was also found."
https://openalex.org/W2008380444,"Staphylococcus aureus strains of the 8325 lineage, especially 8325-4 and derivatives lacking prophage, have been used extensively for decades of research. We report herein the results of our deep sequence analysis of strain 8325-4. Assignment of sequence variants compared with the reference strain 8325 (NRS77/PS47) required correction of errors in the 8325 reference genome, and reassessment of variation previously attributed to chemical mutagenesis of the restriction-defective RN4220. Using an extensive strain pedigree analysis, we discovered that 8325-4 contains 16 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) arising prior to the construction of RN4220. We identified 5 indels in 8325-4 compared with 8325. Three indels correspond to expected Φ11, 12, 13 excisions, one indel is explained by a sequence assembly artifact, and the final indel (Δ63bp) in the spa-sarS intergenic region is common to only a sub-lineage of 8325-4 strains including SH1000. This deletion was found to significantly decrease (75%) steady state sarS but not spa transcript levels in post-exponential phase. The sub-lineage 8325-4 was also found to harbor 4 additional SNPs. We also found large sequence variation between 8325, 8325-4 and RN4220 in a cluster of repetitive hypothetical proteins (SA0282 homologs) near the Ess secretion cluster. The overall 8325-4 SNP set results in 17 alterations within coding sequences. Remarkably, we discovered that all tested strains of the 8325-4 lineage lack phenol soluble modulin α3 (PSMα3), a virulence determinant implicated in neutrophil chemotaxis, biofilm architecture and surface spreading. Collectively, our results clarify and define the 8325-4 pedigree and reveal clear evidence that mutations existing throughout all branches of this lineage, including the widely used RN6390 and SH1000 strains, could conceivably impact virulence regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2034346419,"Polysialic acid is a linear homopolymer of α2-8-linked sialic acids attached mainly onto glycoproteins. Cell surface polysialic acid plays roles in cell adhesion and differentiation events in a manner that is often dependent on the degree of polymerization (DP). Anti-oligo/polysialic acid antibodies have DP-dependent antigenic specificity, and such antibodies are widely utilized in biological studies for detecting and distinguishing between different oligo/polysialic acids. A murine monoclonal antibody mAb735 has a unique preference for longer polymers of polysialic acid (DP >10), yet the mechanism of recognition at the atomic level remains unclear. Here, we report the crystal structure of mAb735 single chain variable fragment (scFv735) in complex with octasialic acid at 1.8 Å resolution. In the asymmetric unit, two scFv735 molecules associate with one octasialic acid. In both complexes of the unit, all the complementarity-determining regions except for L3 interact with three consecutive sialic acid residues out of the eight. A striking feature of the complex is that 11 ordered water molecules bridge the gap between antibody and ligand, whereas the direct antibody-ligand interaction is less extensive. The dihedral angles of the trisialic acid unit directly interacting with scFv735 are not uniform, indicating that mAb735 does not strictly favor the previously proposed helical conformation. Importantly, both reducing and nonreducing ends of the bound ligand are completely exposed to solvent. We suggest that mAb735 gains its apparent high affinity for a longer polysialic acid chain by recognizing every three sialic acid units in a paired manner."
https://openalex.org/W2060374593,"Metabolic reprogramming in cancer is manifested by persistent aerobic glycolysis and suppression of mitochondrial function and is known as the Warburg effect. The Warburg effect contributes to cancer progression and is considered to be a promising therapeutic target. Understanding the mechanisms used by cancer cells to suppress their mitochondria may lead to development of new approaches to reverse metabolic reprogramming. We have evaluated mitochondrial function and morphology in poorly respiring LM7 and 143B osteosarcoma (OS) cell lines showing the Warburg effect in comparison with actively respiring Saos2 and HOS OS cells and noncancerous osteoblastic hFOB cells. In LM7 and 143B cells, we detected markers of the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT), such as mitochondrial swelling, depolarization, and membrane permeabilization. In addition, we detected mitochondrial swelling in human OS xenografts in mice and archival human OS specimens using electron microscopy. The MPT inhibitor sanglifehrin A reversed MPT markers and increased respiration in LM7 and 143B cells.

Cell-based studies indicate that the regulation of the activity of DUBs is important for homeostasis and is achieved by multiple mechanisms, including through their own ubiquitination. However, the physiological significance of the ubiquitination of DUBs to their functions in vivo is unclear. Here, we report that ubiquitination of the DUB ataxin-3 at lysine residue 117, which markedly enhances its protease activity in vitro, is critical for its ability to suppress toxic protein-dependent degeneration in Drosophila melanogaster. Compared with ataxin-3 with only Lys-117 present, ataxin-3 that does not become ubiquitinated performs significantly less efficiently in suppressing or delaying the onset of toxic protein-dependent degeneration in flies. According to further studies, the C terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein (CHIP), an E3 ubiquitin ligase that ubiquitinates ataxin-3 in vitro, is dispensable for its ubiquitination in vivo and is not required for the neuroprotective function of this DUB in Drosophila. Our work also suggests that ataxin-3 suppresses degeneration by regulating toxic protein aggregation rather than stability."
https://openalex.org/W2120566679,"α-Conotoxin AuIB is a selective α3β4 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subtype inhibitor. Its analgesic properties are believed to result from it activating GABAB receptors and subsequently inhibiting CaV2.2 voltage-gated calcium channels. The structural determinants that mediate diverging AuIB activity at these targets are unknown. We performed alanine scanning mutagenesis of AuIB and α3β4 nAChR, homology modeling, and molecular dynamics simulations to identify the structural determinants of the AuIB·α3β4 nAChR interaction. Two alanine-substituted AuIB analogues, [P6A]AuIB and [F9A]AuIB, did not inhibit the α3β4 nAChR. NMR and CD spectroscopy studies demonstrated that [F9A]AuIB retains its native globular structure, so its activity loss is probably due to loss of specific toxin-receptor residue pairwise contacts. Compared with AuIB, the concentration-response curve for inhibition of α3β4 by [F9A]AuIB shifted rightward more than 10-fold, and its subtype selectivity profile changed. Homology modeling and molecular dynamics simulations suggest that Phe-9 of AuIB interacts with a two-residue binding pocket on the β4 nAChR subunit. This hypothesis was confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis of the β4-Trp-59 and β4-Lys-61 residues of loop D, which form a putative binding pocket. AuIB analogues with Phe-9 substitutions corroborated the finding of a binding pocket on the β4 subunit and gave further insight into how AuIB Phe-9 interacts with the β4 subunit. In summary, we identified critical residues that mediate interactions between AuIB and its cognate nAChR subtype. These findings might help improve the design of analgesic conopeptides that selectively ""avoid"" nAChR receptors while targeting receptors involved with nociception."
https://openalex.org/W1974835124,"The inositol-requiring enzyme 1α (IRE1α) is a serine-threonine kinase that plays crucial roles in activating the unfolded protein response. Studies suggest that IRE1α is activated during thymic T cell development and in effector CD8(+) T cells. However, its role in regulating T helper cell differentiation remains unknown. We find that IRE1α is up-regulated and activated upon CD4(+) T cell activation and plays an important role in promoting cytokine IL-4 production. CD4(+) T cells from IRE1α KO mice have reduced IL-4 protein expression, and this impaired IL-4 production is not due to the altered expression of Th2 lineage-specific transcription factors, such as GATA3. Instead, IL-4 mRNA stability is reduced in IRE1α KO T cells. Furthermore, treatment of T cells with an IRE1α-specific inhibitor, 4μ8C, leads to a block in IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 production, confirming the role of IRE1α in the regulation of IL-4. This study identifies a regulatory function for IRE1α in the promotion of IL-4 in T cells."
https://openalex.org/W2068160415,"Rho GTPases such as Rac, RhoA, and Cdc42 are vital for normal platelet function, but the role of RhoG in platelets has not been studied. In other cells, RhoG orchestrates processes integral to platelet function, including actin cytoskeletal rearrangement and membrane trafficking. We therefore hypothesized that RhoG would play a critical role in platelets. Here, we show that RhoG is expressed in human and mouse platelets and is activated by both collagen-related peptide (CRP) and thrombin stimulation. We used RhoG−/− mice to study the function of RhoG in platelets. Integrin activation and aggregation were reduced in RhoG−/− platelets stimulated by CRP, but responses to thrombin were normal. The central defect in RhoG−/− platelets was reduced secretion from α-granules, dense granules, and lysosomes following CRP stimulation. The integrin activation and aggregation defects could be rescued by ADP co-stimulation, indicating that they are a consequence of diminished dense granule secretion. Defective dense granule secretion in RhoG−/− platelets limited recruitment of additional platelets to growing thrombi in flowing blood in vitro and translated into reduced thrombus formation in vivo. Interestingly, tail bleeding times were normal in RhoG−/− mice, suggesting that the functions of RhoG in platelets are particularly relevant to thrombotic disorders.

Under high-shear conditions in stenotic arteries, positive autocrine and paracrine feedback mechanisms augment and stabilize platelet-rich thrombi. Secretion of ADP from platelet dense granules and consequent activation of the platelet P2Y1 and P2Y12 receptors are required for thrombus growth and stability (6Lenain N. Freund M. Léon C.

On encountering subendothelial collagen or thrombin generated at sites of vessel injury, platelets become activated through multiple signaling pathways (11Stalker T.J. Newman D.K. Ma P.

Intriguingly, in addition to these three GTPases, transcript and proteomics studies suggest that human platelets also express other Rho family members, including RhoB, RhoC, Rif (RhoF), RhoG, RhoH, and RhoQ (16Rowley J.W.

We were particularly interested in the role of RhoG in platelets. In other cells, RhoG regulates the actin cytoskeleton and is involved in formation of filopodia (18Gauthier-Rouvière C. Vignal E.

Wennerberg K. Arthur W.T. Dunty J.M. Bowman D.R. DeMali K.A. Der C. Burridge K. SGEF, a RhoG guanine nucleotide exchange factor that stimulates macropinocytosis.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 3309-3319Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and the microtubule rearrangements necessary for lysosomal trafficking (24Vignal E. Blangy A. Martin M. Gauthier-Rouvière C. Fort P. Kinectin is a key effector of RhoG microtubule-dependent cellular activity.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8022-8034Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Given the importance of actin cytoskeletal rearrangements, microtubule dynamics, and granule trafficking to platelet function, we hypothesized that platelets lacking RhoG would be dysfunctional, leading to defective hemostasis in RhoG−/− mice. In this study, we combined RhoG activation assays, pharmacologic approaches, proteomics, and a RhoG null mouse line to examine the roles and regulation of RhoG in platelets. We found that in both human and mouse platelets, RhoG is activated by stimulation with thrombin or with the glycoprotein (GP) 3The abbreviations used are: GPglycoproteinCRPcollagen-related peptidePLCγ2phospholipase Cγ2BAPTA-AM1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid tetrakis(acetoxymethyl ester)GTPγSguanosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate)GEFguanine nucleotide exchange factorTRITCtetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate. VI-specific agonist collagen-related peptide (CRP) and that this activation is dependent on the activity of Src family kinases and Syk. We show that integrin activation, aggregation, cell adhesion, and in vitro thrombus formation are all reduced downstream of GPVI in RhoG−/− platelets. In seeking to explain these defects, we identified interactions between active RhoG and regulators of the actin cytoskeleton and secretion. Following CRP stimulation, RhoG operates independently of Rac to control platelet secretion from α-granules, dense granules, and lysosomes. Secretion in RhoG−/− platelets is normal following thrombin stimulation. We propose that reduced dense granule secretion is the central abnormality in RhoG−/− platelets because function can be “rescued” by co-stimulation with ADP. Most importantly, defective platelet function in RhoG−/− mice translates into a reduction in thrombus formation in vivo, without adversely affecting hemostatic potential.

Age-matched RhoG+/+ littermates (henceforth known as wild-type) were used as controls. Mice were bred and maintained in the University of Bristol animal facilities according to United Kingdom Home Office regulations. All procedures undertaken complied with the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 (licenses 30/2386 and 30/2908). The University of Bristol Local Research Ethics Committee approved use of mice for this study. 8–16-week-old mice of mixed gender were used. Blood was drawn into 4% trisodium citrate (1:9) by descending vena cava puncture of mice humanely killed by rising CO2 inhalation per Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act Schedule 1 (1986). Prior to platelet preparation, complete blood counts were conducted (Pentra ES 60, Horiba) and adjusted for anticoagulant volume. Washed mouse platelets were prepared as described previously (26Goggs R. Savage J.S. Mellor H. Poole A.W. The small GTPase Rif is dispensable for platelet filopodia generation in mice.PLoS ONE. 2013; 8: e54663Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Human blood was obtained from healthy drug-free volunteers in accordance with Local Research Ethics Committee-approved guidelines (E5736). Written informed consent was obtained in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Indomethacin (10 μm) and apyrase (0.02 units/ml) and prostaglandin E1 (140 nm) were added to platelet-rich plasma as described previously (27Harper M.T. Poole A.W. PKC inhibition markedly enhances Ca2+ signaling and phosphatidylserine exposure downstream of protease-activated receptor-1 but not protease-activated receptor-4 in human platelets.J. Thromb. Haemost. 2011; 9: 1599-1607Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). All platelets were resuspended in Tyrode's HEPES buffer (135 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, 5 mm glucose, and 1 mm MgCl2·6H2O, pH 7.3), counted using a Z1 Coulter Counter (Beckman Coulter), diluted as required, and rested for 30 min at 30 °C in the presence of indomethacin and apyrase before use. pGEX plasmids containing the sequence for RhoG and GST-RhoG fusion proteins were made using standard techniques. GST-RhoG-Sepharose beads were washed with exchange buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) and then loaded with 1 mm GDP or 100 μm GTPγS (final concentrations) for 30 min at 4 °C with rotation. The nucleotide exchange reaction was terminated by the addition of MgCl2 to a final concentration of 60 mm. Nucleotide-loaded GST-RhoG beads (or equal volumes of GSH-Sepharose beads only) were then rotated with washed platelet lysates (500 μl, 5 × 108/ml) for 1 h at 4 °C. Beads were recovered by centrifugation, and unbound proteins were removed by repeated washing. Bound proteins were eluted in 2× Laemmli buffer by boiling at 98 °C for 5 min, and samples were then processed for mass spectrometry or for immunoblotting. Proteomics was performed as described previously (28Steinberg F. Heesom K.J. Bass M.D. Cullen P.J. SNX17 protects integrins from degradation by sorting between lysosomal and recycling pathways.J. Cell Biol. 2012; 197: 219-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) with modifications. Proteins were fractionated by SDS-PAGE. Gel lanes were sectioned and subjected to in-gel tryptic digestion, and the resulting peptides were fractionated by HPLC. Peptides were ionized by nanoelectrospray, and tandem mass spectra were acquired using a mass spectrometer (LTQ Orbitrap Velos, Thermo Scientific) operated in data-dependent acquisition mode. The spectrometer was set to analyze the survey scans at 60,000 resolution (m/z 400) at m/z 300–2000. The top 20 multiply charged ions in each duty cycle were selected for MS/MS in the LTQ linear ion trap. Charge state filtering, where unassigned precursor ions were not selected for fragmentation, and dynamic exclusion (repeat count of 1, repeat duration of 30 s, and exclusion list size of 500) were used. Fragmentation conditions in the LTQ were as follows: normalized collision energy of 40%, activation q of 0.25, activation time of 10 ms, and minimum ion selection intensity of 500 counts. Raw data files acquired using Xcalibur v2.1 software were processed and quantified using Proteome Discoverer v1.2 software (both from Thermo Scientific) and searched against UniProt/Swiss-Prot human database release version 57.3 (20,326 entries) using the SEQUEST (v28.13) algorithm. Peptide precursor mass tolerance was set at 10 ppm, and MS/MS tolerance was set at 0.8 Da. Search criteria included carbamidomethylation of cysteine (+57.0214) as a fixed modification and oxidation of methionine (+15.9949) as a variable modification. Searches were performed with full tryptic digestion, and a maximum of 1 missed cleavage was allowed. The reverse database search option was enabled, and peptide data were filtered to satisfy a 5% false discovery rate. Databases were then manually reviewed to remove contaminant proteins such as keratin, plasma proteins, and proteins from cells other than platelets. UniProt/Swiss-Prot database accessions were checked, and where necessary, BLASTp searches were performed to confirm the identity of the peptides. All original and subsequently refined lists are presented. Washed platelets (4 × 108/ml) stimulated as indicated were lysed in Laemmli buffer containing 50 mm dithiothreitol. Proteins were separated by electrophoresis using 8–15% Tris glycine-polyacrylamide gels against known molecular weight markers and transferred onto PVDF membranes. After blocking with 5% BSA in Tris-buffered saline/Tween-20 (10 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20), membranes were probed with the appropriate primary and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, and proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence. The pGEX plasmid containing the sequence for ELMO2 (amino acids 1–362) was a gift from Dr. H. Katoh (Kyoto University, Kyoto Japan). GST-ELMO fusion proteins bound to GSH-Sepharose were prepared by standard techniques. Washed platelet aliquots (500 μl, 5 × 108/ml) stimulated as indicated (20 °C) were lysed on ice with equal volumes of 2× lysis buffer (0.1 m Tris-Cl, 1 m NaCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 2% Triton X-100, and EDTA-free protease inhibitors). GST-ELMO beads were rotated with platelet lysates for 1 h at 4 °C, and unbound proteins were removed by washing. Bound proteins were eluted in Laemmli buffer and separated by electrophoresis, and RhoG was identified by immunoblotting. Subcellular platelet morphology was analyzed by transmission electron microscopy. Ultrathin counterstained sections were prepared as described previously (29Konopatskaya O. Gilio K. Harper M.T.

Invest. 2009; 119: 399-407PubMed Google Scholar), imaged with a Tecnai Spirit T12 microscope (FEI), and analyzed with NIH ImageJ 1.46. Granule numbers were quantified manually and expressed as granules/cell/image. Aggregation studies were conducted using aliquots of washed platelets (245 μl, 2 × 108/ml) in a Born lumi-aggregometer (560-VS, Chrono-Log) and stirred at 1000 rpm (37 °C). ATP secretion was measured simultaneously using a luciferin-luciferase assay calibrated with 2 nmol of ATP standards. Static platelet adhesion and spreading assays were performed as described previously (26Goggs R. Savage J.S. Mellor H. Poole A.W. The small GTPase Rif is dispensable for platelet filopodia generation in mice.PLoS ONE. 2013; 8: e54663Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Images were analyzed with ImageJ in a blinded fashion. Assays were as described (26Goggs R. Savage J.S. Mellor H. Poole A.W. The small GTPase Rif is dispensable for platelet filopodia generation in mice.PLoS ONE. 2013; 8: e54663Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Surface glycoprotein expression was determined in duplicate, and median values were used for calculations. Integrin αIIbβ3 activation and P-selectin expression in response to agonist stimulation were determined simultaneously. Intracellular F-actin levels were estimated using FITC-phalloidin binding to Triton X-100-permeabilized platelets. Analyses were performed using a flow cytometer with proprietary software (FACSCanto II and FACSDiva, BD Biosciences). At least 30,000 platelet-gate events were collected per experiment. Changes in cytosolic [Ca2+]i were measured by spectrofluorometry in washed platelets (5 × 107/ml) loaded with the Ca2+-sensitive dye Fura-PE3 as described previously (30Harper M.T. Poole A.W. Protein kinase Cθ negatively regulates store-independent Ca2+ entry and phosphatidylserine exposure downstream of glycoprotein VI in platelets.J. Biol.

Platelets were stimulated (37 °C) with agonists in the absence or presence of inhibitors as indicated, with continuous stirring. Fura-PE3 was excited alternately at 340 and 380 nm, and fluorescence emission was detected at 510 nm. Fluorescence signals were corrected for autofluorescence and calibrated in terms of [Ca2+]i. Lysosomal secretion was measured as described (31Chen D. Lemons P.P. Schraw T. Whiteheart S.W.

Briefly, 100-μl aliquots of 10 mm 4-nitrophenyl N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminide in citrate/phosphate buffer (0.2 m Na2HPO4 and 0.1 m citric acid, pH 4.2) were placed into 96-well plates. Washed platelet aliquots (45 μl, 2 × 108/ml) were stimulated for 10 min at 20 °C as indicated and immediately centrifuged for 5 min at 500 × g, and supernatant (6 μl) was added to relevant wells. Tyrode's HEPES buffer was used for blanks. Total β-hexosaminidase activity was measured on repeated snap-frozen/thawed samples. After 18 h of incubation at 37 °C, plates were quenched with 100 μl of 0.12 m NaOH and read at 405 nm (Opsys MR, Dynex Technologies). Blank values were subtracted, and secreted β-hexosaminidase was expressed as a percentage of the total activity. Plate-based activation assays for Rac and RhoA (Cytoskeleton, Inc.) were conducted following the manufacturer's instructions with modifications for lysate preparation. Briefly, washed platelet aliquots (50 μl, 7.5 × 108/ml) were stimulated as indicated (20 °C) and lysed on ice with equal volumes of 2× lysis buffer, and 50 μl of lysate was added to relevant wells. Whole blood flow chamber assays were performed as described previously (32Gilio K. Harper M.T. Cosemans J.M. Konopatskaya O. Munnix I.C. Prinzen L. Leitges M. Liu Q. Molkentin J.D. Heemskerk J.W.

Blood anticoagulated with sodium citrate, heparin (2 units/ml), and d-phenylalanyl-prolyl-arginyl chloromethyl ketone (40 μm) and labeled with 3,3′-dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide (1 μm) was flowed at 1000 s−1 for 3 min over immobilized collagen (50 μg/ml) in parallel plate perfusion chambers. Phase-contrast and fluorescence images were captured at 2 frames/s with a 40× water dipping objective (BX51WI, Olympus), a Rolera-XR digital camera, and QCapture software (QImaging). Non-adherent cells were removed by flowing Tyrode's HEPES buffer through the chambers. Thirty random images of the collagen-coated surface were collected per experiment, and the surface area covered by platelets was analyzed with ImageJ. In vivo thrombus formation assays were performed as described previously (33Savage J.S. Williams C.M. Konopatskaya O. Hers I. Harper M.T. Poole A.W. Munc13-4 is critical for thrombosis through regulating release of ADP from platelets.J. Thromb. Haemost. 2013; 11: 771-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Mice were anesthetized with 100 mg/kg ketamine (Vetalar V, Pfizer) and 10 mg/kg xylazine (Rompun, Bayer). Platelets were labeled by intravenous administration of 100 mg/kg DyLight 488-conjugated anti-GPIbβ antibody. Right carotid arteries were exposed, and 15% ferric chloride-soaked filter paper (2 × 1 mm) was placed on the arterial adventitia for 3 min. Time-lapse microscopy of the injury site for 20 min was performed, and images were processed using ImageJ. Background florescence values measured upstream of the injury site were subtracted from thrombus-specific fluorescence, and data are expressed as integrated density values. Mice were anesthetized as described above. Using a scalpel, 5 mm of tail was resected from the tip, and the tail was immersed in saline (37 °C). Times from incision to cessation of bleeding and total bleeding time (including re-bleeds) were recorded. The maximum allowable bleeding time was 600 s. Unless stated otherwise, the data presented are means ± S.E., with statistical significance determined by Student's t test performed using Prism 5.0 (GraphPad Software). p < 0.05 was considered significant. Immunoblotting confirmed expression of RhoG in human platelets (Fig. 1A). GST-ELMO binding assays were used to evaluate RhoG activation in platelets following stimulation with thrombin or CRP. In human platelets, both agonists activated RhoG robustly, but activation in response to thrombin occurred more rapidly than in response to CRP stimulation (Fig. 1A). The GPVI signaling pathway is well characterized, so we used pharmacologic inhibitors to investigate which signaling events are required for RhoG activation. In CRP-stimulated platelets, the activation of RhoG was inhibited by the Src inhibitor Su6656 and the Syk inhibitor piceatannol (Fig. 1, B and C). RhoG activation was not inhibited by U73122, wortmannin, or BIM1, however, showing that PLCγ2, PI3K, and PKC activities are not required. Similarly, intracellular calcium signaling, outside-in signaling through αIIbβ3, and P2Y12 signaling are not required because treatment with BAPTA-AM, Abciximab, and the P2Y12 antagonist AR-C66096 did not affect RhoG activation. These data suggest that RhoG activation downstream of GPVI is a membrane-proximal event, which likely follows assembly of the LAT signalsome, resulting from Syk activation (34Watson S.P. Auger J.M.

To study the function of RhoG in platelets, we used a previously reported constitutive RhoG−/− mouse line (25Vigorito E. Bell S. Hebeis B.J. Reynolds H. McAdam S. Emson P.C. McKenzie A. Turner M.

To gain insight into the causes of misfolding and to define the contributions of specific residues to receptor stability and function, we evaluated the responses of these mutants to 11-cis-retinal pharmacological chaperone rescue or disulfide bond-mediated repair. Pharmacological rescue restored folding in all mutants, but the purified mutant pigments in all cases were thermo-unstable and exhibited abnormal photobleaching, metarhodopsin II decay, and G protein activation.

More than 100 ADRP mutations map to RHO, the gene encoding the visual receptor rhodopsin located in rod photoreceptor cells (2Fanelli F. Seeber M. Structural insights into retinitis pigmentosa from unfolding simulations of rhodopsin mutants.FASEB J. 2010; 24: 3196-3209Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Most of these mutations result in rod opsin misfolding, but the molecular details of pathogenesis remain elusive, and there is no effective treatment. To gain insight into the underlying causes of receptor misfolding and malfunction, we performed a side-by-side comparison using two complementary experimental approaches. The first, pharmacological rescue, is an established procedure for rescuing folding in mutant G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), including ADRP rhodopsin mutants (3Bernier V. Lagacé M. Bichet D.G. Bouvier M. Pharmacological chaperones: potential treatment for conformational diseases.Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2004; 15: 222-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). However, it is our seldom used second tool, disulfide bond-mediated repair, that provided us with novel insight into mechanisms of disease and receptor function. Our first target, a cluster of ADRP mutations (T4K, N15S, T17M, V20G, P23A/H/L, and Q28H) located in the N-terminal tail of rhodopsin (Fig. 1), includes P23H, which accounts for the largest fraction of ADRP mutations in the United States (4Dryja T.P.

The tight association between the N terminus and the extracellular domain was also inferred from binding studies using B6-30N, a monoclonal antibody to rhodopsin N-terminal residues Gly-3–Ser-14 (11Cha K. Reeves P.J. Khorana H.G.

These ideas were integrated into the general proposition that folding of the extracellular and seven-transmembrane (7TM) domains is tightly coupled (12Hwa J. Garriga P. Liu X. Khorana H.G. Structure and function in rhodopsin: packing of the helices in the transmembrane domain and folding to a tertiary structure in the intradiscal domain are coupled.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 10571-10576Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), as are conformational changes in these domains during photoactivation and G protein activation (13Farrens D.L. Altenbach C. Yang K. Hubbell W.L. Khorana H.G.

Structure and activation of the visual pigment rhodopsin.Annu. Rev. Biophys. 2010; 39: 309-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). During biosynthesis, rod opsin inserts into and folds within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of rod cell inner segments. Misfolded forms are withheld and targeted for elimination (see Fig. 6) by the ER-associated protein degradation machinery (15Sitia R. Braakman I. Quality control in the endoplasmic reticulum protein factory.Nature. 2003; 426: 891-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). Correctly folded rod opsin is transported to the rod outer segment (ROS) and becomes densely packed into ROS disc membranes (16Palczewski K. G protein-coupled receptor rhodopsin.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 743-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). In non-rod cell recombinant expression systems, correctly folded rod opsin is transported instead to the cell surface. As part of the visual cycle in rod cells, 11-cis-retinal, synthesized by retinal pigment epithelial cells, is delivered to ROS and combines with rod opsin to form rhodopsin. However, it is not known when or where de novo synthesized rod opsin first encounters and combines with 11-cis-retinal, an event that can influence folding, especially for ADRP mutants susceptible to 11-cis-retinal-mediated pharmacological chaperone rescue (17Noorwez S.M.

ADRP rhodopsin mutants were previously classified according to their expression profiles in transfected HEK-293S or COS-1 cells (19Sung C.H. Davenport C.M. Nathans J.

Point mutations associated with autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa.Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6121-6128Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Type I rod opsin mutants fold normally and reach the cell surface, whereas Type II mutants have reduced expression levels, traffic abnormally, and form pigment inefficiently (19Sung C.H. Davenport C.M. Nathans J. Rhodopsin mutations responsible for autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa. Clustering of functional classes along the polypeptide chain.J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26645-26649Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The absence of 11-cis-retinal during rod opsin folding in these and many similar studies has led us and others to question the relevance of these folding outcomes because, in rod cells, 11-cis-retinal is naturally abundant and may circulate to the ER located in rod cell inner segments. Pharmacological rescue was previously shown to restore pigment formation in ADRP mutant T17M (21Li T. Sandberg M.A. Pawlyk B.S. Rosner B. Hayes K.C. Dryja T.P. Berson E.L. Effect of vitamin A supplementation on rhodopsin mutants threonine-17 → methionine and proline-347 → serine in transgenic mice and in cell cultures.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 11933-11938Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), as well as T4R and P23A/H/L (22Krebs M.P. Holden D.C. Joshi P. Clark 3rd, C.L. Lee A.H. Kaushal S. Molecular mechanisms of rhodopsin retinitis pigmentosa and the efficacy of pharmacological rescue.J. Mol. Biol. 2010; 395: 1063-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Here, we have extended these analyses to all known human ADRP rhodopsin mutations in the N terminus (T4K, T17M, N15S, V20G, P23A/H/L, and Q28H), and for the first time, we have assessed the active-state properties of these rescued mutant pigments. As the mutant pigments resulting from pharmacological rescue were found to be defective, we used an alternative strategy to repair the defects in the N-terminal cap. Our hypothesis was that mutations within the N terminus of rhodopsin destabilize the entire protein by decoupling key interactions of the cap with the extracellular loops. Stabilization of the transmembrane helices and connecting loops with bound ligand can overcome these defects, as we have shown here. However, to test our hypothesis directly, we introduced a disulfide bond in an attempt to tether the damaged cap to the 7TM domain. This was achieved by superimposing this panel of ADRP mutants onto a rhodopsin background containing a juxtaposed cysteine pair (N2C/D282C) known to form a disulfide bond (Cys-2–Cys-282) that increases the thermostability of rod opsin (23Xie G. Gross A.K. Oprian D.D. An opsin mutant with increased thermal stability.Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1995-2001Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). For a subset of these ADRP mutants, the N2C/D282C background restored folding of rod opsin, and the resulting pigments had much improved thermostability, photobleaching behavior, and activation of the G protein transducin (GT). These findings highlight how the extracellular domain of rhodopsin has evolved, under selection pressure constraints requiring high sensitivity vision in dim light, to contribute to receptor stability and signaling efficiency.

Site-directed mutagenesis using complementary primer pairs was performed with a synthetic bovine opsin gene in the expression plasmid pMT4 (25Oprian D.D. Molday R.S. Kaufman R.J. Khorana H.G.

All mutants were also superimposed onto the N2C/D282C rhodopsin background (23Xie G. Gross A.K. Oprian D.D.

Mutations were verified by DNA sequencing of both strands of the entire opsin gene. HEK-293S cells were maintained in DMEM/Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with heat-treated (55 °C, 30 min) 10% (v/v) FBS, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. HEK-293S cells were grown in a humidified incubator under a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. Calcium phosphate precipitation-mediated transfection was performed as follows using a modification to a procedure developed by Chen and Okayama (26Chen C. Okayama H. High-efficiency transformation of mammalian cells by plasmid DNA.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4820) Google Scholar) and O'Mahoney and Adams (27O'Mahoney J.V. Adams T.E. Optimization of experimental variables influencing reporter gene expression in hepatoma cells following calcium phosphate transfection.DNA Cell Biol. 1994; 13: 1227-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). On the day before transfection, confluent cell monolayers of HEK-293S cells were trypsinized and seeded at a density of 2–2.5 × 106 cells in 22.5 ml of DMEM (supplemented as described above) in a 15-cm tissue culture dish. 24 h after cells were seeded, a transfection mixture (2.5 ml) containing plasmid DNA and Buffers I and J was added to the pre-confluent cell monolayer. To prepare the transfection mixture, plasmid pMT4 containing opsin genes (54 μg) and pRSV-TAg (6 μg) was diluted in sterile water (1.125 ml). Buffer J (125 μl) was then added slowly with continuous mixing. Finally, Buffer I was added over 1 min with Vortex mixing, and the mixture was immediately added dispersed over the cell monolayers. The cells were then kept for 19 h in a humidified incubator set at 1% CO2 and 37 °C. After this incubation period, the spent medium was removed, and the cells were carefully washed once with unsupplemented DMEM (20 ml). The cells were subsequently fed with DMEM (25 ml) containing supplements and kept for a further 48 h in a humidified incubator set at 5% CO2 and 37 °C prior to harvest. HPLC-purified retinal isomers were added to transfected cells using a slight modification to the method described previously (17Noorwez S.M. Kuksa V. Imanishi Y. Zhu L. Filipek S. Palczewski K. Kaushal S. Pharmacological chaperone-mediated in vivo folding and stabilization of the P23H-opsin mutant associated with autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa.J. Biol.

Briefly, 11-cis-retinal or 9-cis-retinal, prepared as 100 mm solutions in cell culture-grade dimethyl sulfoxide, was dispensed over transfected HEK-293S cells using safelight illumination conditions (Kodak No. 2 filter). These retinoids were added to cells in two 10 μm installments, 24 and 48 h after removal of the transfection mixture, to give a final retinoid concentration of 20 μm. The culture dishes were wrapped with a single layer of aluminum foil to maintain dark conditions during incubation. Cells were harvested under safelight illumination 24 h after the final addition of retinoids. Transfected HEK-293S cells obtained from a single 15-cm tissue culture dish were washed twice with 10 ml of ice-cold Buffer A prior to resuspension in 0.9 ml of chilled Buffer B. Pigment formation and subsequent procedures were carried out in a dark room illuminated by Kodak No. 2 safelight filters. Cell suspensions were treated with 11-cis-retinal or 9-cis-retinal (5 μm) added in two installments over 3 h at 4 °C with end-over-end nutator mixing. Whole cells were solubilized with 1% (w/v) DDM for 1 h at 4 °C with end-over-end mixing. The solubilized cell extracts containing pigment were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C to remove insoluble material prior to purification of pigments. A fraction of the supernatant was kept for examination by UV-visible difference spectroscopy and SDS-PAGE for an assessment of rhodopsin yield. Rhodopsin was purified from solubilized bovine ROS membranes or from detergent-solubilized transfected HEK-293S cell extracts using Rho-1D4-Sepharose 4B beads with modifications to the methods described previously (25Oprian D.D.

All purification procedures and manipulations were carried out at 4 °C. 50 μl of Rho-1D4-Sepharose beads with a binding capacity of ∼1 μg of rhodopsin/μl of settled beads was added to the cell lysate and mixed end-over-end at 4 °C for 2 h to allow binding. The suspension was packed into a 2-ml disposable column and washed with 40 ml of Buffer D (high salt), followed by 20 ml of salt-free Buffer E. Correctly folded rhodopsin was purified by elution with salt-free Buffer H (0.5 ml) for up to three elutions. Once elution of rhodopsin pigment was complete, rod opsin was recovered from the column using Buffer G (high salt). Pigments were stored in the dark at 4 °C. UV-visible spectra of pigments purified in Buffer H were recorded at 20 °C using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences λ35 UV-visible spectrophotometer equipped with water-jacketed cell holders. Spectra were acquired between 250 and 650 nm using a 2-nm bandwidth, a response time of 1 s, and a scan speed of 480 nm/min. The molar extinction coefficient value used to calculate rhodopsin yields was 40,600 m−1 cm−1 at 500 nm (30Wald G. Brown P.K. The molar extinction of rhodopsin.J. Gen. Physiol. 1953; 37: 189-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Purified rhodopsin samples were photobleached at 20 °C by direct illumination in a cuvette using a Schott KL 1500 compact fiber optic light guide fitted with a >495-nm long-pass filter. Rhodopsin samples were manually bleached for 30 s, followed immediately by UV-visible spectroscopy. This process was repeated four times. Finally, the protonated Schiff base was trapped by acidification of the sample (500 μl) by the addition of 2 n H2SO4 (2 μl). Purified rhodopsin pigments in Buffer H were monitored by UV-visible spectroscopy. Samples were kept at either 37 or 55 °C for 2 min in quartz cuvettes to allow for temperature equilibration. UV-visible spectra were recorded at 2-min intervals for 30 min and afterward at 20-min intervals for at least another 24 h, except as stated otherwise. Normalized data were best fit using the single- or double-component exponential decay function of SigmaPlot 12.0, and these values were used to calculate the half-life (t½) of the mutant rhodopsin pigments. Pigments that decayed rapidly at 55 °C were monitored at 5-s intervals using the time drive function on the spectrometer. Schiff base hydrolysis of rhodopsin by hydroxylamine (22Krebs M.P. Holden D.C. Joshi P. Clark 3rd, C.L. Lee A.H. Kaushal S. Molecular mechanisms of rhodopsin retinitis pigmentosa and the efficacy of pharmacological rescue.J. Mol. Biol. 2010; 395: 1063-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) was measured in Buffer F; the final concentration of hydroxylamine hydrochloride (titrated to pH 6.0 using NaOH) was 50 mm. UV-visible absorbance spectra were collected at the same time intervals described above. Metarhodopsin II (MII) decay was monitored at 20 °C as described previously (31Farrens D.L. Khorana H.G. Structure and function in rhodopsin. Measurement of the rate of metarhodopsin II decay by fluorescence spectroscopy.J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5073-5076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) using instead a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS 50 fluorometer. Excitation of rhodopsin tryptophans (0.25 μm in Buffer F) was at 280 nm (2.5-nm slit width), and emission was monitored at 330 nm (15-nm slit width). Rhodopsin was converted to MII by photobleaching the sample for 30 s with light (>495 nm). Fluorescence was recorded at 30-s intervals with a 2-s integration time for 120 min. Data were normalized and best fit to either a single- or double-component rise-to-plateau exponential function (SigmaPlot 12.0). Derived rate constants were used to calculate the half-life of MII decay. Freshly prepared (1–2 days old), similarly aged rhodopsin mutants with no measurable loss of pigment during storage were used for this assay. GT was purified from ROS membranes according to the method of Kühn (32Kühn H. Light- and GTP-regulated interaction of GTPase and other proteins with bovine photoreceptor membranes.Nature. 1980; 283: 587-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), except that the final supernatant containing GT was concentrated using a 60-ml JumbosepTM centrifugal concentration device fitted with a 10-kDa cutoff filter (Pall Corp.) before dialysis against the storage buffer (Buffer L). The activation of GT by rhodopsin MII was measured by monitoring the increase in intrinsic fluorescence of GT that accompanies the exchange of GDP for GTP (33Phillips W.J. Cerione R.A. The intrinsic fluorescence of the α subunit of transducin. Measurement of receptor-dependent guanine nucleotide exchange.J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15498-15505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GT activation was measured at 20 °C in Buffer K using the PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS 50 fluorometer as described above. The fluorometer was equipped with an electronic stirrer (Model 300, Rank Brothers Ltd.) set to mix the reaction cuvette contents at 240 rpm. Excitation of GT was at 280 nm, and emission was recorded at 340 nm. The interval for data collection was 3 s, and the reaction was followed for 1 h. The reaction mixture contained 250 nm GT in 1 ml of Buffer K. Rhodopsin (20 nm) was added and allowed to equilibrate for 1 min before bleaching the sample for 30 s with light (>495 nm). GTPγS (5 μm) was then added to initiate the reaction. The relative initial rate of GT activation was determined from the slope of the increase in relative fluorescence over the first 60 s following the addition of GTPγS. The GT activation rates for ADRP mutants were expressed as a percentage of WT rhodopsin initial activation rates. To reduce the Cys-2–Cys-282 disulfide bond, rhodopsin pigments were incubated with DTT (50 mm final concentration) on ice for 1 h prior to commencement of the GT activation assay. The packing analysis of the N-terminal domain of rhodopsin was carried out using the method of occluded surfaces (34Pattabiraman N. Ward K.B. Fleming P.J. Occluded molecular surface: analysis of protein packing.J. Mol. Recognit. 1995; 8: 334-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The occluded surface method calculates packing values at the level of individual atoms, amino acids, or entire proteins. Packing values range from 0.0 to 1.0, corresponding to totally exposed and totally occluded environments. Hexagonally packed spheres have a maximum packing value of 0.8 due to the void space that exists where the spheres are not in direct contact (35Richards F.M. Lim W.A. An analysis of packing in the protein-folding problem.Q. Rev. Biophys. 1993; 26: 423-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). In the occluded surface calculation, van der Waals surfaces are drawn around each atom in the protein, and normals are constructed that extend outward until they reach another surface or a length of 2.8 Å, the diameter of a water molecule. The cutoff of 2.8 Å between amino acid surfaces accounts for the possibility that water can occupy that space, and therefore, the corresponding surface is defined as being non-occluded. The definition of the occluded surface packing value takes into account the normalized occluded (or buried) surface area weighted by the distance to the occluding neighbors. HEK-293S cells transfected with ADRP rhodopsin mutants were incubated in the presence or absence of 11-cis-retinal during expression. Harvested cells were treated with 11-cis-retinal, and rhodopsin pigments were purified from solubilized cell extracts by Rho-1D4-Sepharose immunoaffinity chromatography (see “Experimental Procedures”). Preferential elution of correctly folded rhodopsin was achieved using salt-free Buffer H. Eluted rhodopsin fractions were examined by UV-visible absorbance spectroscopy, and the results are presented in Fig. 2A and Table 1. These N-terminal ADRP mutants made very small or undetectable amounts of pigment. These very low yields are attributed to receptor misfolding and inefficient formatio"

https://openalex.org/W2018854341,"Dehaloperoxidase (DHP) from Amphitrite ornata, having been shown to catalyze the hydrogen peroxide-dependent oxidation of trihalophenols to dihaloquinones, is the first oxygen binding globin that possesses a biologically relevant peroxidase activity. The catalytically competent species in DHP appears to be Compound ES, a reactive intermediate that contains both a ferryl heme and a tyrosyl radical. By simulating the EPR spectra of DHP activated by H2O2, Thompson et al. (Thompson, M. K., Franzen, S., Ghiladi, R. A., Reeder, B. J., and Svistunenko, D. A. (2010) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 132, 17501-17510) proposed that two different radicals, depending on the pH, are formed, one located on either Tyr-34 or Tyr-28 and the other on Tyr-38. To provide additional support for these simulation-based assignments and to deduce the role(s) that tyrosyl radicals play in DHP, stopped-flow UV-visible and rapid-freeze-quench EPR spectroscopic methods were employed to study radical formation in DHP when three tyrosine residues, Tyr-28, Tyr-34, and Tyr-38, were replaced either individually or in combination with phenylalanines. The results indicate that radicals form on all three tyrosines in DHP. Evidence for the formation of DHP Compound I in several tyrosine mutants was obtained. Variants that formed Compound I showed an increase in the catalytic rate for substrate oxidation but also an increase in heme bleaching, suggesting that the tyrosines are necessary for protecting the enzyme from oxidizing itself. This protective role of tyrosines is likely an evolutionary adaptation allowing DHP to avoid self-inflicted damage in the oxidative environment."
https://openalex.org/W2141355670,"Type III polyketide synthases (PKSs) show diverse cyclization specificity. We previously characterized two Azotobacter type III PKSs (ArsB and ArsC) with different cyclization specificity. ArsB and ArsC, which share a high sequence identity (71%), produce alkylresorcinols and alkylpyrones through aldol condensation and lactonization of the same polyketomethylene intermediate, respectively. Here we identified a key amino acid residue for the cyclization specificity of each enzyme by site-directed mutagenesis. Trp-281 of ArsB corresponded to Gly-284 of ArsC in the amino acid sequence alignment. The ArsB W281G mutant synthesized alkylpyrone but not alkylresorcinol. In contrast, the ArsC G284W mutant synthesized alkylresorcinol with a small amount of alkylpyrone. These results indicate that this amino acid residue (Trp-281 of ArsB or Gly-284 of ArsC) should occupy a critical position for the cyclization specificity of each enzyme. We then determined crystal structures of the wild-type and G284W ArsC proteins at resolutions of 1.76 and 1.99 Å, respectively. Comparison of these two ArsC structures indicates that the G284W substitution brings a steric wall to the active site cavity, resulting in a significant reduction of the cavity volume. We postulate that the polyketomethylene intermediate can be folded to a suitable form for aldol condensation only in such a relatively narrow cavity of ArsC G284W (and presumably ArsB). This is the first report on the alteration of cyclization specificity from lactonization to aldol condensation for a type III PKS. The ArsC G284W structure is significant as it is the first reported structure of a microbial resorcinol synthase."

Beyond hemostasis, platelets are known to play a role in mediating inflammatory and immune responses via expression and release of proinflammatory factors, including CD154 (CD40L). CD40L is a type II protein ligand member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily that, via interaction with CD40, is a key immunomodulatory factor responsible for modulating nearly all aspects of the adaptive immune response. CD40L/CD40 interaction is required for enhancing antigen-presenting functions of dendritic cells, macrophages, and B cells; maturation of humoral responses; and enhancement of effector T cell responses (1Schönbeck U. Libby P. The CD40/CD154 receptor/ligand dyad.Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 4-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

In light of these findings, the present study sought to understand mechanisms of CD40L regulation in platelets as a possible therapeutic target for the treatment of the aforementioned diseases. It was established previously that platelet CD40L is derived from megakaryocytes and regulated via calcium mobilization-dependent activation of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT), 2The abbreviations used are: NFATnuclear factor of activated T cellsEGRearly growth responseBAPTA-AM1,2-bis-(o-aminophenoxy)-ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid, tetraacetoxymethyl esterPMAphorbol 12-myristate 13-acetateCsAcyclosporine AZbenzyloxycarbonylfmkfluoromethyl ketoneI+Pionomycin plus PMAEBSEts transcription factor family binding site. a family of calcium-dependent transcription factors most commonly associated with cytokine expression in activated T cells (13Crist S.A.

Although each of the four calcium-dependent NFAT family members (NFATc1, -c2, -c3, and -c4) is expressed in T cells and has apparently redundant function, NFATc1 and NFATc2 are considered principle regulators of cytokines in activated T cells (14Alfonso-Jaume M.A. Mahimkar R.

Although intracellular calcium flux is sufficient for nuclear translocation, NFAT weakly binds to its recognition site and requires additional co-factors for transcriptional activity (18Horsley V.

Recently, specific members of the early growth response (EGR) transcription factor gene family, notably EGR-1, were identified as factors required for NFAT-dependent CD40L expression in activated T cells (21Cron R.Q.

The observation that EGR-1 is expressed in megakaryocytes and modulates NFAT-dependent expression of CD40L in T cells prompted the investigation of EGR-1 as a potential modulator of NFAT-dependent expression of CD40L in megakaryocytes and, hence, platelet inflammatory activity. The current study further characterizes the mechanism of NFAT-mediated regulation of CD40L and shows that EGR-1 is required for NFAT-mediated expression of CD40L in megakaryocytes. It was determined that NFATc2 specifically modulates CD40L transcription and that EGR-1 is required for NFATc2 binding and transactivation of the CD40L promoter. Importantly, biochemically inhibiting NFAT activity or abrogating NFATc2 expression in vivo significantly decreased CD40L mRNA expression in bone marrow megakaryocytes and CD40L protein in circulating platelets. These data show for the first time that modulation of upstream regulatory mechanisms of CD40L expression in megakaryocytes can impact inflammatory activity of platelets and suggest that NFATc2 and EGR-1 activity may be potential therapeutic targets for the modulation of platelet-mediated inflammation in disease. The CMK, K562, and Jurkat cell lines were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and were routinely maintained in RPMI 1640, supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FCS, 10 mm l-glutamine, and 100 mg/ml penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C and 5% CO2. 1,2-bis-(o-aminophenoxy)-ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid, tetraacetoxymethyl ester (BAPTA-AM), phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), ionomycin, and cyclosporine A (CsA) were all purchased from Sigma. Injectable CsA was purchased from Bedford Laboratories (Cleveland, OH). The pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk was purchased from BioMol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Megakaryocyte differentiation of the K562 and CMK cell lines were performed as described (13Crist S.A. Sprague D.L. Ratliff T.L.

Briefly, CMK cells were cultured in complete medium with 10 nm PMA for 4 days. The cells were then washed and rested for an additional 48 h to complete differentiation. K562 cells were cultured in complete medium with 10 nm PMA for 72 h. For the transient activation studies, the cells where stimulated with 1 μg/ml ionomycin, 81 nm PMA, the two in combination (I+P), or the appropriate vehicle control (DMSO or ethanol).

Hyperproliferation and dysregulation of IL-4 expression in NF-ATp-deficient mice.Immunity. 1996; 4: 397-405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). All animals were maintained at the Purdue University Animal Care Facility, and all animal experiments followed approved Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and Institutional Review Board protocols. To generate NFATc2null on a C57Bl/6 (B6) background, NFATc2−/+ were backcrossed with wild type B6 mice for 13 generations then crossed with heterozygous littermates to generate B6 NFATc2−/−. K562 and CMK cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) using the manufacturer's protocol. Each transfection used 3.2 μg of reporter plasmid along with 0.5 μg of pSv-βGal as a transfection efficiency control plasmid. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were lysed in 200 μl/well of reporter lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, WI). Luciferase activity was determined by mixing the lysate with luciferase substrate (Promega) and immediately reading the sample in a Monolight 2010 luminometer (BD Biosciences). β-Galactosidase activity was determined using Galactolyte β-galactosidase substrate (Tropix, Bedford, MA) and reading the sample in the luminometer. Luciferase activity was normalized by dividing the mean luciferase relative light units by the mean β-galactosidase relative light units. Total cellular RNA was isolated from all cells using the RNAeasy kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), and cDNA synthesis was performed using Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen), following the manufacturer's instructions. Diluted cDNA was subjected to real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) using proprietary TaqMan primer and probe sets for human and mouse CD40L, EGR1, Fli-1, NFATc1, NFATc2, NFATc3, NFATc4, MCP-1 mRNA, and 18 S rRNA purchased from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA) and Perfecta qPCR Supermix (Quanta Biosciences, Gaithersburg, MD). For each sample, three PCRs were performed. The resulting relative increase in reporter fluorescent dye emission was monitored by the TaqMan system (GeneAmp 5700 sequence detection system and software, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The level of test mRNA, relative to 18 S rRNA, was calculated using the formula, relative mRNA expression = 2−(Ct(test) − Ct(18 S rRNA)), where Ct is the threshold cycle value. The p-391wt, p-391DNFATmut, and p-391PNFATmut CD40L promoter-luciferase reporter constructs have been described previously (13Crist S.A. Sprague D.L. Ratliff T.L. Nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) mediates CD154 expression in megakaryocytes.Blood. 2008; 111: 3553-3561Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The p-391EBSmut and p-391NFATKOmut vectors were produced using PCR-based site directed mutagenesis and subcloning of the modified CD40L promoter region into the pGL-3 basic luciferase reporter vector (Promega) as described previously (13Crist S.A. Sprague D.L. Ratliff T.L. Nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) mediates CD154 expression in megakaryocytes.Blood. 2008; 111: 3553-3561Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The EGR-1 expression vector, obtained from the Addgene plasmid repository (Addgene plasmid 11729) was described previously and was a generous gift from Eileen Adamson (27Yu J. de Belle I. Liang H. Adamson E.D. Coactivating factors p300 and CBP are transcriptionally crossregulated by Egr1 in prostate cells, leading to divergent responses.Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 83-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The NFATc3 expression vector (Addgene plasmid 11790) was a generous gift from Anjana Rao (Harvard University). The NFATc2 expression vector was produced by cloning the NFATc2 cDNA from pENTR11 (Addgene plasmid 11791, also a gift from Anjana Rao) into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). CMK cells were transfected with the EGR-1 expression vector (EGR1 cDNA in the pcDNA3.1 vector backbone) or pcDNA3.1 only using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturers' instructions. Stable clones were isolated after a 14-day culture in medium containing 400 mg/ml G418 (Geneticin, Life Technologies). Neo-resistant colonies were cultivated and assessed for EGR-1 expression in the cell lysates by EGR-1 ELISA using anti-EGR-1 monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, MA). The CMK clone c4 (CMK(EGR-1)c4) shows high level EGR-1 expression (data not shown) and was further cultivated for use in the experiments described in the legend to Fig. 6. Nuclear extract was prepared from PMA-differentiated CMK cells treated with I+P for 4 h as described previously (13Crist S.A. Sprague D.L. Ratliff T.L. Nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) mediates CD154 expression in megakaryocytes.Blood. 2008; 111: 3553-3561Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides corresponding to the sense (5′-end-labeled with biotin) and antisense strands of each probe (90 μm) were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA) and annealed by heating at 95 °C for 10 min, followed by slow cooling to room temperature. The identities and sequences of the biotin-labeled oligonucleotide probes and the non-labeled competitor/non-competitor oligonucleotides are shown in Fig. 4. EMSA and supershifting was performed using the LightShift Chemoluminescent EMSA kit from Pierce according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 20 fmol of biotin-labeled probe was incubated with nuclear extract (2.5 μg of total protein) for 20 min at room temperature in binding buffer with 5 mg/ml poly(dI-dC). Protein-DNA complexes were subjected to electrophoresis through 6% DNA retardation gels (Invitrogen) in Tris borate, EDTA (TBE) buffer for 1–2 h at room temperature and then transferred to Biodyne® B positively charged nylon membrane (Pall, Port Washington, NY). Thereafter, detection was carried out using the Chemiluminescence Nucleic Acid Detection Module (Pierce), as described by the manufacturer. The membrane was visualized on a UVP ChemiDarkroom and analyzed with VisionWorks software (Upland, CA). In binding reactions containing competitor oligonucleotides, 200-fold molar excesses (4 pmol) of non-labeled double-stranded competitors/non-competitors were added for 20 min before electrophoresis. For supershift assays, nuclear extract (2.5 μg of total protein) was preincubated with 3 μg of anti-NFATc1, anti-NFATc2, anti-NFATc3, anti-EGR-1, anti-Fli-1, or normal rabbit IgG (IgCon) (all purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) for 20 min at 4 °C. Thereafter, the nuclear extract/antibody mixtures were incubated for 20 min at room temperature with the biotin-labeled probe before electrophoresis and detection as described. The preparation of chromatin from differentiated and undifferentiated CMK cells is described in the supplemental material. ChIP was performed using monoclonal antibodies to NFATc2 (sc-7296, mouse IgG2a; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), NFATc1 (sc-7294, mouse IgG1; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or EGR-1 (sc-189, rabbit polyclonal IgG; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and agarose-Protein A/G beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Control precipitations were performed using isotype control antibodies (for NFATc1 and -c2) or non-immune rabbit IgG (for EGR-1), all purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Immunoprecipitated DNA eluted from protein A/G beads was amplified by quantitative PCR using a Chromo4 real-time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad) and dual-labeled fluorescent probe sets (IDT) to the distal NFAT and proximal NFAT/Ets transcription factor family binding site (EBS) in the CD40L promoter. Probe sets with the indicated fluorescent dye (FAM) and quenchers (ZEN/Iowa Black FQ) used are described in the supplemental Materials and Methods. The generation of the EGR1 shRNA knockdown vectors was performed using the BLOCK-iT lentiviral RNAi expression system (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the selection of shRNA sequences was based on Web-based shRNA design software (Invitrogen). Candidate sequences were analyzed for EGR1 mRNA specificity using the BLAST. Four individual sequences were selected for testing. The sense and antisense oligonucleotides were ordered from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA) and were annealed and cloned into the BLOCK-iT U6 RNAi entry vector according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). The U6-RNAi cassette was then transferred into pLenti6/BLOCK-iT-DEST promoterless lentiviral vector by LR clonase-mediated recombination (Invitrogen). The pLenti6 shRNA vectors containing the candidate sequences were transiently transfected into K562 cells and then monitored for endogenous EGR1 mRNA expression knockdown by qRT-PCR as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The 1508 sequence (5′-GGCATACCAAGATCCACTTG-3′) was shown to suppress EGR1 mRNA to less than 35% of normal expression in K562 cells and results in an 82% reduction of endogenous EGR-1 protein by ELISA (supplemental Fig. S1). A second pLenti6 U6 construct was then produced, consisting of the 1508 sequence scrambled to serve as an shRNA control. Mice were anesthetized and bled by cardiac puncture. Blood was collected into syringes containing 1.0 ml of acid/citrate/dextrose (12.5 g/liter sodium citrate, 10.0 g/liter d-glucose, and 6.85 g/liter citric acid), added to 6 ml of PIPES buffer (150 mm NaCl and 20 mm PIPES (pH 6.5)), and spun at 100 × g for 15 min. The platelet-rich supernatant was collected, and 1 unit/ml apyrase and 1 μm prostaglandin E1 (final concentrations) (Sigma) were added and spun at 1000 × g for 10 min. The platelet pellet was washed once in Tyrode's buffer (134 mm NaCl, 2.9 mm KCl, 0.34 mm Na2PO4, 12 mm NaHCO3, 20 mm HEPES, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm glucose, and 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, pH 6.5), repelleted, and then lysed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min on ice. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation. Total protein analysis of the platelet lysates were performed using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). All cleared lysates were stabilized by the addition of protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) and stored at −80 ºC until analysis. CD40L protein expression in the platelet lysates was determined by ELISA using the mouse sCD40L ELISA kit (BMS6010, Bender Medsystems) according to the manufacturer's protocol. All samples were performed in at least triplicate, and absolute CD40L levels were normalized to total protein. All statistical analyses of data were carried out using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software Inc). The unpaired Student's t test was used to compare experiments between two groups. Where noted, luciferase experiments were expressed as means ± S.E. of comparative -fold differences. Values were considered significant at a p value of <0.05 (*), <0.01 (**), and <0.001 (***). To verify CD40L induction in the absence of cytokines and growth factors that may alter calcium mobilization and/or PKC activation, the expression of CD40L mRNA was assessed in ionomycin and PMA-induced, freshly isolated primary megakaryocytes. Primary CD41+ megakaryocytes were isolated from total mononuclear bone marrow cells from normal C57Bl/6 mice, as described in the supplemental Materials and Methods. The purified CD41+ megakaryocytes were pretreated for 30 min in the presence of vehicle alone, CsA, or BAPTA-AM before the addition of ionomycin, PMA, or I+P for 4 h. The expression of CD40L mRNA was then assessed by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). The data in Fig. 1A show that although ionomycin treatment alone was sufficient to induce levels of CD40L mRNA, I+P significantly enhanced expression in CD41+ megakaryocytes. The data also show that pretreatment with either the CsA or BAPTA-AM completely blocks I+P-induced expression of CD40L mRNA, indicating that calcium mobilization is required for induced expression in primary megakaryocytes. Similar results were obtained when we performed identical experiments using the megakaryocytic cell line CMK after PMA-induced terminal megakaryocytes differentiation (Fig. 1B), validating the use of the CMK cell line for the elucidation of inducible expression of CD40L in megakaryocytes. Overall, these data indicate the both calcium mobilization and PKC activation were required for maximal CD40L expression. We previously demonstrated that two consensus NFAT binding elements (core sequence GGAAAA), a distal site (DNFAT) located at −256 bp, and proximal NFAT site (PNFAT) at −57 bp upstream of the transcription start site of the CD40L promoter, play a key role in differentiation-mediated CD40L transcription in megakaryocytes (13Crist S.A. Sprague D.L. Ratliff T.L. Nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) mediates CD154 expression in megakaryocytes.Blood. 2008; 111: 3553-3561Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In addition to the NFAT binding sites, a consensus EBS immediately downstream from the proximal NFAT element was recently shown to be required for NFAT-dependent transactivation of CD40L in activated T cells (21Cron R.Q. Bandyopadhyay R. Genin A. Brunner M. Kersh G.J. Yin J. Finkel T.H. Crow M.K. Early growth response-1 is required for CD154 transcription.J. Immunol. 2006; 176: 811-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Because NFAT sites are often dependent on neighboring cis-acting elements for transcriptional function, and several Ets family transcription factors are shown to be important in the regulation of megakaryocyte-associated genes, the role of the EBS in the modulation of CD40L promoter activity was assessed in megakaryocytes (28Athanasiou M.

https://openalex.org/W2334950205,"One transcription factor mediator of Ca(2+)-signals is cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB). CREB expression and/or activity negatively correlates with vascular smooth muscle (VSM) cell proliferation and migration. Multifunctional Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases, including CaMKII, have been demonstrated to regulate CREB activity through both positive and negative phosphorylation events in vitro, but the function of CaMKII as a proximal regulator of CREB in intact cell systems, including VSM, is not clear. In this study, we used gain- and loss-of-function approaches to determine the function of CaMKIIδ in regulating CREB phosphorylation, localization, and activity in VSM. Overexpression of constitutively active CaMKIIδ specifically increased CREB phosphorylation on Ser(142) and silencing CaMKIIδ expression by siRNA or blocking endogenous CaMKII activity with KN93 abolished thrombin- or ionomycin-induced CREB phosphorylation on Ser(142) without affecting Ser(133) phosphorylation. CREB-Ser(142) phosphorylation correlated with transient nucleocytoplasmic translocation of CREB. Thrombin-induced CREB promoter activity, CREB binding to Sik1 and Rgs2 promoters, and Sik1/Rgs2 transcription were enhanced by a kinase-negative CaMKIIδ2 (K43A) mutant and inhibited by a constitutively active (T287D) mutant. Taken together, these studies establish negative regulation of CREB activity by endogenous CaMKIIδ-dependent CREB-Ser(142) phosphorylation and suggest a potential mechanism for CaMKIIδ/CREB signaling in modulating proliferation and migration in VSM cells."
https://openalex.org/W2141613786,"Vaccines that incorporate peptide mimics of tumor antigens, or mimotope vaccines, are commonly used in cancer immunotherapy and function by eliciting increased numbers of T cells that cross-react with the native tumor antigen. Unfortunately, they often elicit T cells that do not cross-react with or that have low affinity for the tumor antigen. Using a high affinity tumor-specific T cell clone, we identified a panel of mimotope vaccines for the dominant peptide antigen from a mouse colon tumor that elicits a range of tumor protection following vaccination. The TCR from this high affinity T cell clone was rarely identified in ex vivo evaluation of tumor-specific T cells elicited by mimotope vaccination. Conversely, a low affinity clone found in the tumor and following immunization was frequently identified. Using peptide libraries, we determined if this frequently identified TCR improved the discovery of efficacious mimotopes. We demonstrated that the representative TCR identified more protective mimotopes than the high affinity TCR. These results suggest that targeting a dominant fraction of tumor-specific T cells generates potent immunity and that consideration of the available T cell repertoire is necessary for targeted T cell therapy.

The most highly variable region of the TCR, the complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3), confers the specificity of TCRs by interacting with short peptide sequences presented on the cell surface in the peptide binding groove of MHC class I molecules. Although TCRs are exquisitely specific, they are also flexible and can adopt different conformations, depending on the peptide-MHC (pMHC) complex (3Colf L.A. Bankovich A.J. Hanick N.A. Bowerman N.A.

The flexibility and cross-reactivity of TCRs is essential for the host to overcome the physical constraints on the T cell repertoire and the limited number of potential peptide antigens that can be presented by host MHC (9Sewell A.K.

However, T cell cross-reactivity may also contribute to the initiation of autoimmune responses (11Chastain E.M. Miller S.D.

T cell receptor complementarity-determining region 3 peptide-MHC baculovirus recombinant BV enhanced GFP multiplicity of infection antibody. Autoreactive cytotoxic T lymphocytes with high affinity for autoantigens are usually deleted during development in the thymus. However, T cells specific for self-antigens can escape central tolerance and enter the periphery, where they mediate autoimmune disease and respond to self-tumor antigens (13Miller J.F. Basten A. Mechanisms of tolerance to self.Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1996; 8: 815-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Some autoreactive T cells escape central tolerance because they have a low affinity for self-antigens, below the threshold for negative selection (14Liu G.Y. Fairchild P.J. Smith R.M. Prowle J.R.

Learning self-control in the thymus.Nat. Rev. 2005; 5: 772-782Google Scholar). Peripheral tolerance mechanisms, such as anergy and ignorance, normally suppress the expansion of these cells (17Ohlén C. Kalos M. Cheng L.E. Shur A.C. Hong D.J. Carson B.D. Kokot N.C. Lerner C.G. Sather B.D. Huseby E.S. Greenberg P.D. CD8(+) T cell tolerance to a tumor-associated antigen is maintained at the level of expansion rather than effector function.J. Exp. Med. 2002; 195: 1407-1418Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). However, vaccination with foreign or altered self-antigens that cross-react with these low affinity T cells overcomes peripheral tolerance, leading to their proliferation and differentiation (18Tam R.C.

Termination of peripheral tolerance to a T cell epitope by heteroclitic antigen analogues.J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 1705-1709PubMed Google Scholar). Overcoming tolerance is particularly relevant toward the development of vaccines against cancers that express tumor-associated self-antigens. T cell tolerance, low affinity of self-antigens for MHCs or TCRs, and the immunosuppressive environment of tumors may all contribute to the minimal expansion of tumor-specific T cells in response to peptide vaccines used to treat cancer patients (20De Visser K.E.

Determining which mimotopes are most effective upon vaccination and how best to identify those mimotopes remains a challenge. Understanding the fundamental requirements for the activation and expansion of tumor-specific T cells may facilitate the discovery of ideal peptide vaccines for use in a clinical setting.

We screened these peptide libraries for candidate mimotope vaccines based on the response of a high affinity tumor-specific T cell clone, CT, which was propagated after limiting dilution of T cells from a CT26-GM-vaccinated mouse (37Slansky J.E.

Although vaccination with the candidate mimotopes elicited more AH1-tetramer-specific T cells than vaccination with the AH1 peptide itself, not all mimotopes significantly improved anti-tumor immunity (39Jordan K.R. McMahan R.H. Kemmler C.B. Kappler J.W. Slansky J.E. Peptide vaccines prevent tumor growth by activating T cells that respond to native tumor antigens.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 4652-4657Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). To understand the range of anti-tumor immunity elicited by mimotopes, we sequenced the tumor-specific TCRs responding to different mimotope vaccines (40Jordan K.R. Buhrman J.D. Sprague J. Moore B.L. Gao D. Kappler J.W. Slansky J.E. TCR hypervariable regions expressed by T cells that respond to effective tumor vaccines.Cancer Immunol. Immunother. 2012; 61: 1627-1638Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). These studies revealed a frequently expressed motif within the CDR3 β-chain in mice vaccinated with more protective mimotopes. Therefore, we expanded the 1D4 T cell clone, which expressed a common CDR3β motif, bound to mimotopes that prevented tumor growth, and did not bind to the less protective mimotopes (40Jordan K.R. Buhrman J.D. Sprague J. Moore B.L. Gao D. Kappler J.W. Slansky J.E. TCR hypervariable regions expressed by T cells that respond to effective tumor vaccines.Cancer Immunol. Immunother. 2012; 61: 1627-1638Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that screening mimotope libraries with TCRs that are representative of endogenous tumor-specific T cells, rather than using rare high affinity clones, would improve the discovery of efficacious mimotopes for cancer immunotherapy. We demonstrate here that the 1D4 TCR identifies more protective mimotopes and, perhaps more importantly, fewer poorly protective mimotopes than the CT TCR despite the 1D4 TCR having a lower affinity for the AH1 peptide. Screening a recombinant baculovirus peptide-MHC library with the 1D4 TCR, we identified candidate mimotopes that enhanced the expansion of AH1-specific T cells compared with those identified by the CT TCR. Furthermore, T cells elicited by 1D4-identified mimotopes had increased functional recognition for the native AH1 tumor antigen. These results have important implications for developing strategies to identify effective peptide vaccines for immunotherapy. Recent advances in sequencing technology allowed for in depth investigation of endogenous T cell responses within tumors and the identification of optimal TCRs to be exploited for mimotope discovery. 6–8-week-old female BALB/cAnNCr mice were purchased from the National Cancer Institute/Charles River Laboratories. All animal protocols were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at National Jewish Health.

Briefly, DNA from the library acceptor virus, Ld-eGFP, was isolated and linearized using SceI and CeuI homing enzymes, releasing the eGFP insert. Peptide library fragments were generated by PCR using specific primers that randomize predetermined nucleotides and encode each of the 20 amino acids. The BVM library was designed with the following sequence: SPXYXYXX(F/L), where X indicates a randomized position. Positions 2 (P2) and 9 (P9) were held constant with proline and phenylalanine/leucine, respectively, because these residues are highly conserved anchor residues for the H-2Ld molecule (44Khilko S.N.

Ligated BV DNA was transfected into Sf9 insect cells using calcium phosphate. After 3 days, insect cells were screened by flow cytometry for H-2Ld and eGFP expression.

TCR+ 28.14.8s+ eGFP− insect cells were separated using a MoFlo® high performance cell sorter (Dako-Cytomation), and the isolated cells were added to a fresh flask of 3 × 107 insect cells. This process was repeated until a clear population of TCR+ cells was visible by flow cytometry. Individual peptides were identified by single cell-sorting positive cells into 96-well plates containing 105 Sf9 insect cells. Viruses were grown for 7–10 days, and the supernatant was used to infect insect cells, which were stained with TCR and 28.14.8s antibody as above. DNA from TCR+ 28.14.8+ eGFP− cells was extracted, and the peptide region was PCR-amplified. The PCR products were sequenced, and individual peptides were identified. Purified rBVs (2.5 × 109 infectious particles) containing specific peptide libraries were concentrated by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 2 h and resuspended in 50 ml of extraction buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8.5, 0.01% gelatin, 0.45% Triton X-100, 0.45% Tween 20, 50 mm KCl, 20 units of proteinase K). Viruses were digested for 2 h at 56 °C, and the proteinase K was inactivated for 20 min at 95 °C. A 5-fold excess of template DNA was used to cover the maximum theoretical nucleotide diversity of the library (324 × 2 = 2,097,152 unique nucleotide sequences).

However, many cancer cells are resistant to TRAIL, and the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Here, we show that the regulation of the PP2A and Src interaction plays a critical role in TRAIL resistance. Specifically, we show that TRAIL treatment activates the tyrosine kinase Src, which subsequently phosphorylates caspase-8 at tyrosine 380, leading to the inhibition of caspase-8 activation. We also show that upon TRAIL treatment, Src, caspase-8, and PP2A/C (a catalytic subunit of the PP2A phosphatase) are redistributed into lipid rafts, a microdomain of the plasma membrane enriched with cholesterol, where PP2A dephosphorylates Src at tyrosine 418 and in turn inhibits caspase-8 phosphorylation. Furthermore, we find that TRAIL treatment causes PP2A/C degradation. These data suggest that the balance between Src-mediated caspase-8 phosphorylation and the inactivation of Src-mediated caspase-8 phosphorylation by PP2A determines the outcome of TRAIL treatment in breast cancer cells. Therefore, this work identifies a novel mechanism by which the interaction between PP2A and Src in the context of caspase-8 activation modulates TRAIL sensitivity in cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2027377158,"We investigated the mechanism of activation and functional role of a hitherto uncharacterized signaling molecule, RhoG, in platelets. We demonstrate for the first time the expression and activation of RhoG in platelets. Platelet aggregation, integrin αIIbβ3 activation, and α-granule and dense granule secretion in response to the glycoprotein VI (GPVI) agonists collagen-related peptide (CRP) and convulxin were significantly inhibited in RhoG-deficient platelets. In contrast, 2-MeSADP- and AYPGKF-induced platelet aggregation and secretion were minimally affected in RhoG-deficient platelets, indicating that the function of RhoG in platelets is GPVI-specific. CRP-induced phosphorylation of Syk, Akt, and ERK, but not SFK (Src family kinase), was significantly reduced in RhoG-deficient platelets. CRP-induced RhoG activation was consistently abolished by a pan-SFK inhibitor but not by Syk or PI3K inhibitors. Interestingly, unlike CRP, platelet aggregation and Syk phosphorylation induced by fucoidan, a CLEC-2 agonist, were unaffected in RhoG-deficient platelets. Finally, RhoG(-/-) mice had a significant delay in time to thrombotic occlusion in cremaster arterioles compared with wild-type littermates, indicating the important in vivo functional role of RhoG in platelets. Our data demonstrate that RhoG is expressed and activated in platelets, plays an important role in GPVI-Fc receptor γ-chain complex-mediated platelet activation, and is critical for thrombus formation in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W2043514265,"Nab3 and Nrd1 are yeast heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP)-like proteins that heterodimerize and bind RNA. Genetic and biochemical evidence reveals that they are integral to the termination of transcription of short non-coding RNAs by RNA polymerase II. Here we define a Nab3 mutation (nab3Δ134) that removes an essential part of the protein's C terminus but nevertheless can rescue, in trans, the phenotype resulting from a mutation in the RNA recognition motif of Nab3. This low complexity region of Nab3 appears intrinsically unstructured and can form a hydrogel in vitro. These data support a model in which multiple Nrd1-Nab3 heterodimers polymerize onto substrate RNA to effect termination, allowing complementation of one mutant Nab3 molecule by another lacking a different function. The self-association property of Nab3 adds to the previously documented interactions between these hnRNP-like proteins, RNA polymerase II, and the nascent transcript, leading to a network of nucleoprotein interactions that define a higher order Nrd1-Nab3 complex. This was underscored from the synthetic phenotypes of yeast strains with pairwise combinations of Nrd1 and Nab3 mutations known to affect their distinct biochemical activities. The mutations included a Nab3 self-association defect, a Nab3-Nrd1 heterodimerization defect, a Nrd1-polymerase II binding defect, and an Nab3-RNA recognition motif mutation. Although no single mutation was lethal, cells with any two mutations were not viable for four such pairings, and a fifth displayed a synthetic growth defect. These data strengthen the idea that a multiplicity of interactions is needed to assemble a higher order Nrd1-Nab3 complex that coats specific nascent RNAs in preparation for termination."

https://openalex.org/W2028189542,"Two haemoglobin-binding proteins, HmbR and HpuAB, contribute to iron acquisition by Neisseria meningitidis. These receptors are subject to high frequency, reversible switches in gene expression--phase variation (PV)--due to mutations in homopolymeric (poly-G) repeats present in the open reading frame. The distribution and PV state of these receptors was assessed for a representative collection of isolates from invasive meningococcal disease patients of England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Most of the major clonal complexes had only the HmbR receptor whilst the recently expanding ST-275-centred cluster of the ST-269 clonal complex had both receptors. At least one of the receptors was in an 'ON' configuration in 76.3% of the isolates, a finding that was largely consistent with phenotypic analyses. As PV status may change during isolation and culture of meningococci, a PCR-based protocol was utilised to confirm the expression status of the receptors within contemporaneously acquired clinical specimens (blood/cerebrospinal fluid) from the respective patients. The expression state was confirmed for all isolate/specimen pairs with <15 tract repeats indicating that the PV status of these receptors is stable during isolation. This study therefore establishes a protocol for determining in vivo PV status to aid in determining the contributions of phase variable genes to invasive meningococcal disease. Furthermore, the results of the study support a putative but non-essential role of the meningococcal haemoglobin receptors as virulence factors whilst further highlighting their vaccine candidacy."

PAFR-deficient mice did not show changes in the expression of critical genes involved in anabolic and catabolic metabolism in adipose, liver, and muscle tissues between 6 and 36 wk. However, a 38-81% reduction in β3/β1-adrenergic receptor (AR) and uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) mRNA and protein levels was observed in the interscapular brown adipose tissue (BAT) of PAFR-deficient mice. Whereas a single injection of the β3-adrenergic agonist, CL-316,243 (25 μg/kg) increased temperatures in the brown fat and rectums of WT mice, this increase in temperature was markedly suppressed in PAFR-deficient mice. Acetyl-CoA:lyso-platelet-activating factor (PAF) acetyltransferase, which is involved in PAF biosynthesis, and the PAF receptor were predominantly localized in BAT macrophages, whereas brown adipocytes possessed the enzyme and functional PAF receptors. The stimulation of brown adipocytes by PAF induced the expression of β3-AR mRNA and protein (1.5- and 1.9-fold, respectively), but not that of UCP1. These results indicate that obesity in PAFR-deficient mice resulted from impaired BAT activity and suggest that the antiobese function of PAF occurs through β3-AR/UCP1 expression in BAT."

Ten healthy human subjects were studied twice with [(11)C]FLB 457 following an acute amphetamine (oral, 0.5 mg kg(-1) dose) challenge on two-separate days approximately one week apart. D2/3 receptor binding parameters were estimated using a two-tissue compartment kinetic analysis in the cortical regions of interest and cerebellum (reference region).

The test-retest variability of [(11)C]FLB 457 V(T), BP(P) and BP(ND) were ≤ 17%, 22% and 11% respectively. These results, which are consistent with the published test-retest variability for this ligand measured under baseline conditions demonstrate that the post-amphetamine [(11)C]FLB 457 BP(ND) is reproducible.

The cochlea, with its exquisite mechanical machinery, its complex arrangement of more than 15,000 sensory hair cells, and its 30,000 neurons, could not possibly be replaced by a crude and undifferentiated stimulation of many neurons en masse. The argument was a good one. However, the pioneers in the field persevered in the face of the vociferous criticism. Foremost among these pioneers was William F. House, who developed with Jack Urban the first cochlear implant system that could be safely applied over a patient’s lifetime and that generally provided an awareness of environmental sounds and an aid to lipreading1. This achievement was a huge step forward. The House system and other early systems used a single channel of processing to transform sound sensed by a microphone into patterns of electrical stimulation, as well as a single site of stimulation in or on the cochlea.

This point mutation does not impair the folding of NEMO ZF or mono-ubiquitin binding but is sufficient to alter NEMO function, as NEMO-deficient fibroblasts and Jurkat T lymphocytes reconstituted with full-length D406V NEMO lead to partial and strong defects in NF-κB activation, respectively. To further characterize the ubiquitin binding properties of NEMO ZF, we employed di-ubiquitin (di-Ub) chains composed of several different linkages (Lys-48, Lys-63, and linear (Met-1-linked)). We showed that the pathogenic mutation preferentially impairs the interaction with Lys-63 and Met-1-linked di-Ub, which correlates with its ubiquitin binding defect in vivo. Furthermore, sedimentation velocity and gel filtration showed that NEMO ZF, like other NEMO related-ZFs, binds mono-Ub and di-Ub with distinct stoichiometries, indicating the presence of a new Ub site within the NEMO ZF. Extensive mutagenesis was then performed on NEMO ZF and characterization of mutants allowed the proposal of a structural model of NEMO ZF in interaction with a Lys-63 di-Ub chain."

Viral delivery has been the most efficient method for generation of induced pluripotent stem cells. Transfection, which precedes virus production, is a commonly-used process for delivery of nucleic acids into cells. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficiency of PLGA/ bPEI nanoparticles in transfection and virus production. Using a modified method of producing PLGA nanoparticles, PLGA/bPEI-DNA nanoparticles were examined for transfection efficiency and virus production yield in comparison with PLGA-DNA, bPEI-DNA nanoparticles or liposome-DNA complexes. After testing various ratios of PLGA, bPEI, and DNA, the ratio of 6:3:1 (PLGA:bPEI:DNA, w/w/w) was determined to be optimal, with acceptable cellular toxicity. PLGA/bPEI-DNA (6:3:1) nanoparticles showed superior transfection efficiency, especially in multiple gene transfection, and viral yield when compared with liposome-DNA complexes. The culture supernatants of HEK293FT cells transfected with PLGA/bPEI-DNA of viral constructs containing reprogramming factors (Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, or c-Myc) successfully and more efficiently generated induced pluripotent stem cell colonies from mouse embryonic fibroblasts. These results strongly suggest that PLGA/bPEI-DNA nanoparticles can provide significant advantages in studying the effect of multiple factor delivery such as in reprogramming or direct conversion of cell fate."

https://openalex.org/W2070818872,"The evolutionarily conserved Sgs1/Top3/Rmi1 (STR) complex plays vital roles in DNA replication and repair. One crucial activity of the complex is dissolution of toxic X-shaped recombination intermediates that accumulate during replication of damaged DNA. However, despite several years of study the nature of these X-shaped molecules remains debated. Here we use genetic approaches and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of genomic DNA to show that Top3, unassisted by Sgs1 and Rmi1, has modest capacities to provide resistance to MMS and to resolve recombination-dependent X-shaped molecules. The X-shaped molecules have structural properties consistent with hemicatenane-related template switch recombination intermediates (Rec-Xs) but not Holliday junction (HJ) intermediates. Consistent with these findings, we demonstrate that purified Top3 can resolve a synthetic Rec-X but not a synthetic double HJ in vitro. We also find that unassisted Top3 does not affect crossing over during double strand break repair, which is known to involve double HJ intermediates, confirming that unassisted Top3 activities are restricted to substrates that are distinct from HJs. These data help illuminate the nature of the X-shaped molecules that accumulate during replication of damaged DNA templates, and also clarify the roles played by Top3 and the STR complex as a whole during the resolution of replication-associated recombination intermediates."
