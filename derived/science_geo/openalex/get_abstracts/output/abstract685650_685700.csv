https://openalex.org/W4200166643,"Over the last decade, mobile health applications (mHealth App) have evolved exponentially to assess and support our health and well-being.This paper presents an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-enabled mHealth app rating tool, called ACCU3RATE, which takes multidimensional measures such as user star rating, user review and features declared by the developer to generate the rating of an app. However, currently, there is very little conceptual understanding on how user reviews affect app rating from a multi-dimensional perspective. This study applies AI-based text mining technique to develop more comprehensive understanding of user feedback based on several important factors, determining the mHealth app ratings.Based on the literature, six variables were identified that influence the mHealth app rating scale. These factors are user star rating, user text review, user interface (UI) design, functionality, security and privacy, and clinical approval. Natural Language Toolkit package is used for interpreting text and to identify the App users' sentiment. Additional considerations were accessibility, protection and privacy, UI design for people living with physical disability. Moreover, the details of clinical approval, if exists, were taken from the developer's statement. Finally, we fused all the inputs using fuzzy logic to calculate the new app rating score.ACCU3RATE concentrates on heart related Apps found in the play store and App gallery. The findings indicate the efficacy of the proposed method as opposed to the current device scale. This study has implications for both App developers and consumers who are using mHealth Apps to monitor and track their health. The performance evaluation shows that the proposed mHealth scale has shown excellent reliability as well as internal consistency of the scale, and high inter-rater reliability index. It has also been noticed that the fuzzy based rating scale, as in ACCU3RATE, matches more closely to the rating performed by experts."
https://openalex.org/W4200318716,"Background Mental health problems, such as depression in children have far-reaching negative effects on child, family and society as whole. It is necessary to identify the reasons that contribute to this mental illness. Detecting the appropriate signs to anticipate mental illness as depression in children and adolescents is vital in making an early and accurate diagnosis to avoid severe consequences in the future. There has been no research employing machine learning (ML) approaches for depression detection among children and adolescents aged 4–17 years in a precisely constructed high prediction dataset, such as Young Minds Matter (YMM). As a result, our objective is to 1) create a model that can predict depression in children and adolescents aged 4–17 years old, 2) evaluate the results of ML algorithms to determine which one outperforms the others and 3) associate with the related issues of family activities and socioeconomic difficulties that contribute to depression. Methods The YMM, the second Australian Child and Adolescent Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing 2013–14 has been used as data source in this research. The variables of yes/no value of low correlation with the target variable (depression status) have been eliminated. The Boruta algorithm has been utilized in association with a Random Forest (RF) classifier to extract the most important features for depression detection among the high correlated variables with target variable. The Tree-based Pipeline Optimization Tool (TPOTclassifier) has been used to choose suitable supervised learning models. In the depression detection step, RF, XGBoost (XGB), Decision Tree (DT), and Gaussian Naive Bayes (GaussianNB) have been used. Results Unhappy, nothing fun, irritable mood, diminished interest, weight loss/gain, insomnia or hypersomnia, psychomotor agitation or retardation, fatigue, thinking or concentration problems or indecisiveness, suicide attempt or plan, presence of any of these five symptoms have been identified as 11 important features to detect depression among children and adolescents. Although model performance varied somewhat, RF outperformed all other algorithms in predicting depressed classes by 99% with 95% accuracy rate and 99% precision rate in 315 milliseconds (ms). Conclusion This RF-based prediction model is more accurate and informative in predicting child and adolescent depression that outperforms in all four confusion matrix performance measures as well as execution duration."
https://openalex.org/W4200330806,"This study explored the mechanism by which metformin (Met) inhibits osteoclast activation and determined its effects on osteoarthritis (OA) mice. Bone marrow-derived macrophages were isolated. Osteoclastogenesis was detected using tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining. Cell proliferation was evaluated using CCK-8, F-actin rings were detected by immunofluorescence staining, and bone resorption was detected using bone slices. Nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) and nuclear factor of activated T-cell cytoplasmic 1 (NFATc1) were detected using luciferase assays, and the adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), NF-κB, and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways were detected using western blotting. Finally, expression of genes involved in osteoclastogenesis was measured using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. A knee OA mouse model was established by destabilization of the medial meniscus (DMM). Male C57BL/6J mice were assigned to sham-operated, DMM+vehicle, and DMM+Met groups. Met (100 mg/kg/d) or vehicle was administered from the first day postoperative until sacrifice. At 4- and 8-week post OA induction, micro-computed tomography was performed to analyze microstructural changes in the subchondral bone, hematoxylin and eosin staining and Safranin-O/Fast Green staining were performed to evaluate the degenerated cartilage, TRAP-stained osteoclasts were enumerated, and receptor activator of nuclear factor κB ligand (RANKL), AMPK, and NF-κB were detected using immunohistochemistry. BMM proliferation was not affected by Met treatment below 2 mM. Met inhibited osteoclast formation and bone resorption in a dose-dependent manner in vitro. Met suppressed RANKL-induced activation of p-AMPK, NF-κB, phosphorylated extracellular regulated protein kinases (p-ERK) and up-regulation of genes involved in osteoclastogenesis. Met reversed decreases in BV/TV, Tb.Th, Tb.N, and CD, and an increase in Tb.Sp at 4 weeks postoperatively. The number of osteoclasts and OARSI score were decreased by Met without effect on body weight or blood glucose levels. Met inhibited RANKL, p-AMPK, and NF-κB expression in early OA. The mechanism by which Met inhibits osteoclast activation may be associated with AMPK/NF-κB/ERK signaling pathway, indicating a novel strategy for OA treatment."
https://openalex.org/W4200520388,"As digital finance is widely spread and applied in China, this new format of financial technology could become a new way to reduce poverty in rural areas. By matching digital financial indexes of the prefectural-level cities with microdata on rural households from the China Household Finance Survey (CHFS) in 2017, we find that digital finance significantly suppresses absolute poverty and relative poverty among rural households in China, which is supported by a series of robustness tests, such as the instrumental variable approach, using alternative specifications, and excluding extreme observations. Additionally, we provide evidence that the poverty reduction effect of digital finance is likely to be explained by alleviating credit constraints and information constraints, broadening social networks, and promoting entrepreneurship. Our findings further complement the research field on financial poverty reduction and offer insights for the development of public financial policies of poverty reduction in other countries, especially in some developing countries."
https://openalex.org/W4200615333,"During the early COVID-19 pandemic travel in Uganda was tightly restricted which affected demand for and access to care for pregnant women and small and sick newborns. In this study we describe changes to neonatal outcomes in one rural central Ugandan newborn unit before and during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic.We report outcomes from admissions captured in an electronic dataset of a well-established newborn unit before (September 2019 to March 2020) and during the early COVID-19 period (April-September 2020) as well as two seasonally matched periods one year prior. We report excess mortality as the percent change in mortality over what was expected based on seasonal trends.The study included 2,494 patients, 567 of whom were admitted during the early COVID-19 period. During the pandemic admissions decreased by 14%. Patients born outside the facility were older on admission than previously (median 1 day of age vs. admission on the day of birth). There was an increase in admissions with birth asphyxia (22% vs. 15% of patients). Mortality was higher during COVID-19 than previously [16% vs. 11%, p = 0.017]. Patients born outside the facility had a relative increase of 55% above seasonal expected mortality (21% vs. 14%, p = 0.028). During this period patients had decreased antenatal care, restricted transport and difficulty with expenses and support. The hospital had difficulty with maternity staffing and supplies. There was significant community and staff fear of COVID-19.Increased newborn mortality during the early COVID-19 pandemic at this facility was likely attributed to disruptions affecting maternal and newborn demand for, access to and quality of perinatal healthcare. Lockdown conditions and restrictions to public transit were significant barriers to maternal and newborn wellbeing, and require further focus by national and regional health officials."
https://openalex.org/W4200103082,"Macrophages are key players in the development of atherosclerosis: they scavenge lipid, transform into foam cells, and produce proinflammatory mediators. At the same time, the arterial wall undergoes profound changes in its mechanical properties. We recently showed that macrophage morphology and proinflammatory potential are regulated by the linear stiffness of the growth surface. Here we asked whether linear stiffness also regulates lipid uptake by macrophages. We cultured murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) on polyacrylamide gels modeling stiffness of healthy (1kPa) and diseased (10-150kPa) blood vessels. In unprimed BMMs, increased linear stiffness increased uptake of oxidized (oxLDL) and acetylated (acLDL) low density lipoproteins and generation of reactive oxygen species, but did not alter phagocytosis of bacteria or silica particles. Macrophages adapted to stiff growth surfaces had increased mRNA and protein expression of two key lipoprotein receptors: CD36 and scavenger receptor b1. Regulation of the lipoprotein receptor, lectin-like receptor for ox-LDL, was more complex: mRNA expression decreased but surface protein expression increased with increased stiffness. Focal adhesion kinase was required for maximal uptake of oxLDL, but not of acLDL. Uptake of oxLDL and acLDL was independent of rho-associated coiled coil kinase. Through pharmacologic inhibition and genetic deletion, we found that transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4), a mechanosensitive ion channel, plays an inhibitory role in the uptake of acLDL, but not oxLDL. Together, these results implicate mechanical signaling in the uptake of acLDL and oxLDL, opening up the possibility of new pharmacologic targets to modulate lipid uptake by macrophages in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W4200259327,"Dehydration Responsive Element Binding (DREB) regulates the expression of numerous stress-responsive genes, and hence plays a pivotal role in abiotic stress responses and tolerance in plants. The study aimed to develop a complete overview of the cis-acting regulatory elements (CAREs) present in S. tuberosum DREB gene promoters. A total of one hundred and four (104) cis-regulatory elements (CREs) were identified from 2.5kbp upstream of the start codon (ATG). The in-silico promoter analysis revealed variable sets of cis-elements and functional diversity with the predominance of light-responsive (30%), development-related (20%), abiotic stress-responsive (14%), and hormone-responsive (12%) elements in StDREBs. Among them, two light-responsive elements (Box-4 and G-box) were predicted in 64 and 61 StDREB genes, respectively. Two development-related motifs (AAGAA-motif and as-1) were abundant in StDREB gene promoters. Most of the DREB genes contained one or more Myeloblastosis (MYB) and Myelocytometosis (MYC) elements associated with abiotic stress responses. Hormone-responsive element i.e. ABRE was found in 59 out of 66 StDREB genes, which implied their role in dehydration and salinity stress. Moreover, six proteins were chosen corresponding to A1-A6 StDREB subgroups for secondary structure analysis and three-dimensional protein modeling followed by model validation through PROCHECK server by Ramachandran Plot. The predicted models demonstrated >90% of the residues in the favorable region, which further ensured their reliability. The present study also anticipated pocket binding sites and disordered regions (DRs) to gain insights into the structural flexibility and functional annotation of StDREB proteins. The protein association network determined the interaction of six selected StDREB proteins with potato proteins encoded by other gene families such as MYB and NAC, suggesting their similar functional roles in biological and molecular pathways. Overall, our results provide fundamental information for future functional analysis to understand the precise molecular mechanisms of the DREB gene family in S. tuberosum."
https://openalex.org/W4200011300,"Cellular senescence causes irreversible growth arrest of cells. Prolonged accumulation of senescent cells in tissues leads to increased detrimental effects due to senescence associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Recent findings suggest that elimination of senescent cells has a beneficial effect on organismal aging and lifespan. In this study, using a validated replicative senescent human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs) model, we showed that elimination of senescent cells is possible through the activation of an apoptotic mechanism. We have shown in this replicative senescence model, that cell senescence is associated with DNA damage and cell cycle arrest (p21, p53 markers). We have shown that Silybum marianum flower extract (SMFE) is a safe and selective senolytic agent targeting only senescent cells. The elimination of the cells is induced through the activation of apoptotic pathway confirmed by annexin V/propidium iodide and caspase-3/PARP staining. Moreover, SMFE suppresses the expression of SASP factors such as IL-6 and MMP-1 in senescent HDFs. In a co-culture model of senescent and young fibroblasts, we demonstrated that senescent cells impaired the proliferative capacities of young cells. Interestingly, when the co-culture is treated with SMFE, the cell proliferation rate of young cells is increased due to the decrease of the senescent burden. Moreover, we demonstrated in vitro that senescent fibroblasts trigger senescent process in normal keratinocytes through a paracrine effect. Indeed, the conditioned medium of senescent HDFs treated with SMFE reduced the level of senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA-β-Gal), p16INK4A and SASP factors in keratinocytes compared with CM of senescent HDFs. These results indicate that SMFE can prevent premature aging due to senescence and even reprograms aged skin. Indeed, thanks to its senolytic and senomorphic properties SMFE is a candidate for anti-senescence strategies."
https://openalex.org/W4200174680,"Peripheral edema (i.e., lower limb swelling) can cause pain, weakness, and limited range of motion. However, few studies have examined its prevalence in the U.S. or its association with demographics, comorbidities, activity, or mobility. This study used data from the Health and Retirement Study, a nationally representative longitudinal survey of U.S. adults (age 51+/ N = 19,988 for 2016), to evaluate time trends and correlates of peripheral edema using weighted descriptive statistics and logistic regressions, respectively. Peripheral edema was assessed with the question ""Have you had… // Persistent swelling in your feet or ankles?"" The weighted prevalence of edema among older U.S. adults was 19% to 20% between 2000 and 2016. Peripheral edema was associated with older age, female sex, non-white race, low wealth, obesity, diabetes, hypertension, pain, low activity levels, and mobility limitations (odds ratios ranging from 1.2-5.6; p-values ≤0.001). This study provides the first estimates of national prevalence and correlates of peripheral edema among older Americans. Peripheral edema is common and strongly associated with comorbidities, pain, low activity levels, and mobility limitations, and disproportionately affects poorer and minority groups. Peripheral edema should be a focus of future research in order to develop novel and cost-effective interventions."
https://openalex.org/W4200609041,"The primary aims of this study were to examine the effects of bio-banding players on passing networks created during 4v4 small-sided games (SSGs), while also examining the interaction of pitch size using passing network analysis compared to a coach-based scoring system of player performance. Using a repeated measures design, 32 players from two English Championship soccer clubs contested mixed maturity and bio-banded SSGs. Each week, a different pitch size was used: Week 1) small (36.1 m2 per player); week 2) medium (72.0 m2 per player); week 3) large (108.8 m2 per player); and week 4) expansive (144.50 m2 per player). All players contested 12 maturity (mis)matched and 12 mixed maturity SSGs. Technical-tactical outcome measures were collected automatically using a foot-mounted device containing an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and the Game Technical Scoring Chart (GTSC) was used to subjectively quantify the technical performance of players. Passing data collected from the IMUs were used to construct passing networks. Mixed effect models were used with statistical inferences made using generalized likelihood ratio tests, accompanied by Cohen's local f2 to quantify the effect magnitude of each independent variable (game type, pitch size and maturation). Consistent trends were identified with mean values for all passing network and coach-based scoring metrics indicating better performance and more effective collective behaviours for early compared with late maturation players. Network metrics established differences (f2 = 0.00 to 0.05) primarily for early maturation players indicating that they became more integral to passing and team dynamics when playing in a mixed-maturation team. However, coach-based scoring was unable to identify differences across bio-banding game types (f2 = 0.00 to 0.02). Pitch size had the largest effect on metrics captured at the team level (f2 = 0.24 to 0.27) with smaller pitch areas leading to increased technical actions. The results of this study suggest that the use of passing networks may provide additional insight into the effects of interventions such as bio-banding and that the number of early-maturing players should be considered when using mixed-maturity playing formats to help to minimize late-maturing players over-relying on their early-maturing counterparts during match-play."
https://openalex.org/W4226006930,"Salmonid fish raised in hatcheries often have lower fitness (number of returning adult offspring) than wild fish when both spawn in the wild. Body size at release from hatcheries is positively correlated with survival at sea. So one explanation for reduced fitness is that hatcheries inadvertently select for trait values that enhance growth rate under the unnatural environment of a hatchery, but that are maladaptive in the wild environment. A simple prediction of this hypothesis is that juveniles of hatchery origin should grow more quickly than fish of wild origin under hatchery conditions, but should have lower survival under wild conditions. We tested that hypothesis using multiple full sibling families of steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss) that were spawned using either two wild parents (WxW) or two first-generation hatchery (HxH) parents. Offspring from all the families were grown together under hatchery conditions and under semi-natural conditions in artificial streams. HxH families grew significantly faster in the hatchery, but had significantly lower survival in the streams. That we see this tradeoff after only a single generation of selection suggests that the traits involved are under very strong selection. We also considered one possible alteration to the hatchery environment that might reduce the intensity of selection among families in size at release. Here we tested whether reducing the fat content of hatchery feed would reduce the variance among families in body size. Although fish raised under a low-fat diet were slightly smaller, the variation among families in final size was unchanged. Thus, there is no evidence that reducing the fat content of hatchery feed would reduce the opportunity for selection among families on size at release."
https://openalex.org/W4200136710,"A fetal anomaly scan in mid-pregnancy is performed, to check for the presence of congenital anomalies, including congenital heart disease (CHD). Unfortunately, 40% of CHD is still missed. The combined use of ultrasound and electrocardiography might boost detection rates. The electrical heart axis is one of the characteristics which can be deduced from an electrocardiogram (ECG). The aim of this study was to determine reference values for the electrical heart axis in healthy fetuses around 20 weeks of gestation.Non-invasive fetal electrocardiography was performed subsequent to the fetal anomaly scan in pregnant women carrying a healthy singleton fetus between 18 and 24 weeks of gestation. Eight adhesive electrodes were applied on the maternal abdomen including one ground and one reference electrode, yielding six channels of bipolar electrophysiological measurements. After removal of interferences, a fetal vectorcardiogram was calculated and then corrected for fetal orientation. The orientation of the electrical heart axis was determined from this normalized fetal vectorcardiogram. Descriptive statistics were used on normalized cartesian coordinates to determine the average electrical heart axis in the frontal plane. Furthermore, 90% prediction intervals (PI) for abnormality were calculated.Of the 328 fetal ECGs performed, 281 were included in the analysis. The average electrical heart axis in the frontal plane was determined at 122.7° (90% PI: -25.6°; 270.9°).The average electrical heart axis of healthy fetuses around mid-gestation is oriented to the right, which is, due to the unique fetal circulation, in line with muscle distribution in the fetal heart."
https://openalex.org/W4200469286,"With the increase of patients with retinopathy, retinopathy recognition has become a research hotspot. In this article, we describe the etiology and symptoms of three kinds of retinal diseases, including drusen(DRUSEN), choroidal neovascularization(CNV) and diabetic macular edema(DME). In addition, we also propose a hybrid attention mechanism to classify and recognize different types of retinopathy images. In particular, the hybrid attention mechanism proposed in this paper includes parallel spatial attention mechanism and channel attention mechanism. It can extract the key features in the channel dimension and spatial dimension of retinopathy images, and reduce the negative impact of background information on classification results. The experimental results show that the hybrid attention mechanism proposed in this paper can better assist the network to focus on extracting thr fetures of the retinopathy area and enhance the adaptability to the differences of different data sets. Finally, the hybrid attention mechanism achieved 96.5% and 99.76% classification accuracy on two public OCT data sets of retinopathy, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W4200283823,"Understanding the points in a species breeding cycle when they are most vulnerable to environmental fluctuations is key to understanding interannual demography and guiding effective conservation and management. Seabirds represent one of the most threatened groups of birds in the world, and climate change and severe weather is a prominent and increasing threat to this group. We used a multi-state capture-recapture model to examine how the demographic rates of a long-lived trans-oceanic migrant seabird, the Manx shearwater Puffinus puffinus, are influenced by environmental conditions experienced at different stages of the annual breeding cycle and whether these relationships vary with an individual's breeding state in the previous year (i.e., successful breeder, failed breeder and non-breeder). Our results imply that populations of Manx shearwaters are comprised of individuals with different demographic profiles, whereby more successful reproduction is associated with higher rates of survival and breeding propensity. However, we found that all birds experienced the same negative relationship between rates of survival and wind force during the breeding season, indicating a cost of reproduction (or central place constraint for non-breeders) during years with severe weather conditions. We also found that environmental effects differentially influence the breeding propensity of individuals in different breeding states. This suggests individual spatio-temporal variation in habitat use during the annual cycle, such that climate change could alter the frequency that individuals with different demographic profiles breed thereby driving a complex and less predictable population response. More broadly, our study highlights the importance of considering individual-level factors when examining population demography and predicting how species may respond to climate change."
https://openalex.org/W4200343723,"Background The association between salt intake and clinical outcomes in hemodialysis patients has been controversial. This study aimed to clarify the association between salt intake and mortality in hemodialysis patients. Method The present study included patients who underwent hemodialysis from June 1st 2016 to May 31st 2020. Corrected salt intake by ideal body weight was the main predictor of outcomes. Ideal body weight was calculated assuming that the ideal body mass index is 22 kg/m 2 for the Japanese population. The multivariate Cox proportional hazards model was used to determine the association between corrected salt intake and mortality, adjusting for potential confounders. The outcomes considered were all-cause mortality and cumulative incidence of cardiovascular events at year 4. Result A total of 492 adult patients were enrolled in the study. The mean daily salt intake and corrected salt intake at baseline were 9.5 g/day and 0.17 g/kg/day, respectively. The low corrected salt intake group (&lt; 0.13 g/kg/day) demonstrated the highest 4-year all-cause mortality. No association was observed between corrected salt intake and the cumulative incidence of cardiovascular events. In multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis, only the group with corrected salt intake of 0.16–0.20 g/kg/day was associated with a decreased hazard risk for all-cause death compared with the low corrected salt intake group. Conclusion The present study found that a low salt intake was associated with high all-cause mortality in hemodialysis patients. Reduced long-term survival may be attributed to malnutrition resulting from excessive salt restriction."
https://openalex.org/W4200446756,"Clinical comparisons do not usually take laterality into account and thus may report erroneous or misleading data. The concept of laterality, well evaluated in brain and motor systems, may also apply at the level of peripheral nerves. Therefore, we sought to evaluate the extent to which we could observe an effect of laterality in MRI-collected white matter indices of the sciatic nerve and its two branches (tibial and fibular).We enrolled 17 healthy persons and performed peripheral nerve diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) and magnetization transfer imaging (MTI) of the sciatic, tibial and fibular nerve. Participants were scanned bilaterally, and findings were divided into ipsilateral and contralateral nerve fibers relative to self-reporting of hand dominance. Generalized estimating equation modeling was used to evaluate nerve fiber differences between ipsilateral and contralateral legs while controlling for confounding variables. All findings controlled for age, sex and number of scans performed.A main effect of laterality was found in radial, axial, and mean diffusivity for the tibial nerve. Axial diffusivity was found to be lateralized in the sciatic nerve. When evaluating mean MTR, a main effect of laterality was found for each nerve division. A main effect of sex was found in the tibial and fibular nerve fiber bundles.For the evaluation of nerve measures using DWI and MTI, in either healthy or disease states, consideration of underlying biological metrics of laterality in peripheral nerve fiber characteristics need to considered for data analysis. Integrating knowledge regarding biological laterality of peripheral nerve microstructure may be applied to improve how we diagnosis pain disorders, how we track patients' recovery and how we forecast pain chronification."
https://openalex.org/W4200517526,"Knowledge about how science works, trust in scientists, and the perceived utility of science currently appear to be eroding in these times in which ""alternative facts"" or personal experiences and opinions are used as arguments. Yet, in many situations, it would be beneficial for the individual and all of society if scientific findings were considered in decision-making. For this to happen, people have to trust in scientists and perceive science as useful. Still, in university contexts, it might not be desirable to report negative beliefs about science. In addition, science-utility and science-trust associations may differ from explicit beliefs because associations were learned through the co-occurrence of stimuli rather than being based on propositional reasoning. We developed two IATs to measure science-utility and science-trust associations in university students and tested the psychometric properties and predictive potential of these measures. In a study of 261 university students, the IATs were found to have good psychometric properties and small correlations with their corresponding self-report scales. Science-utility and science-trust associations predicted knowledge about how science works over and above self-reported beliefs. The results suggest that indirect measures are useful for assessing beliefs about science and can be used to predict outcome measures."
https://openalex.org/W4200570249,"There are a wide variety of porcine parvoviruses (PPVs) referred to as PPV1 to PPV7. The latter was discovered in 2016 and later reported in some countries in America, Asia, and Europe. PPV7 as a pathogenic agent or coinfection with other pathogens causing disease has not yet been determined. In the present study, we report the identification of PPV7 for the first time in Colombia, where it was found retrospectively since 2015 in 40% of the provinces that make up the country (13/32), and the virus was ratified for 2018 in 4/5 provinces evaluated. Additionally, partial sequencing (nucleotides 380 to 4000) was performed of four Colombian strains completely covering the VP2 and NS1 viral genes. A sequence identity greater than 99% was found when comparing them with reference strains from the USA and China. In three of the four Colombian strains, an insertion of 15 nucleotides (five amino acids) was found in the PPV7-VP2 capsid protein (540-5554 nt; 180-184 aa). Based on this insertion, the VP2 phylogenetic analysis exhibited two well-differentiated evolutionarily related groups. To evaluate the impact of this insertion on the structure of the PPV7-VP2 capsid protein, the secondary structure of two different Colombian strains was predicted, and it was determined that the insertion is located in the coil region and not involved in significant changes in the structure of the protein. The 3D structure of the PPV7-VP2 capsid protein was determined by threading and homology modeling, and it was shown that the insertion did not imply a change in the shape of the protein. Additionally, it was determined that the insertion is not involved in suppressing a potential B cell epitope, although the increase in length of the epitope could affect the interaction with molecules that allow a specific immune response."
https://openalex.org/W4200015580,"Plasmid transformation of chlamydiae has created new opportunities to investigate host–microbe interactions during chlamydial infections; however, there are still limitations. Plasmid transformation requires a replicon derived from the native Chlamydia plasmid, and these transformations are species-specific. We explored the utility of a broad host-range plasmid, pBBR1MCS-4, to transform chlamydiae, with a goal of simplifying the transformation process. The plasmid was modified to contain chromosomal DNA from C . trachomatis to facilitate homologous recombination. Sequences flanking incA were cloned into the pBBR1MCS-4 vector along with the GFP:CAT cassette from the pSW2-GFP chlamydial shuttle vector. The final plasmid construct, pBVR2, was successfully transformed into C . trachomatis strain L2-434. Chlamydial transformants were analyzed by immunofluorescence microscopy and positive clones were sequentially purified using limiting dilution. PCR and PacBio-based whole genome sequencing were used to determine if the plasmid was maintained within the chromosome or as an episome. PacBio sequencing of the cloned transformants revealed allelic exchange events between the chromosome and plasmid pBVR2 that replaced chromosomal incA with the plasmid GFP:CAT cassette. The data also showed evidence of full integration of the plasmid into the bacterial chromosome. While some plasmids were fully integrated, some were maintained as episomes and could be purified and retransformed into E . coli . Thus, the plasmid can be successfully transformed into chlamydia without a chlamydial origin of replication and can exist in multiple states within a transformed population."
https://openalex.org/W4200061304,"Audio-visual integration relies on temporal synchrony between visual and auditory inputs. However, differences in traveling and transmitting speeds between visual and auditory stimuli exist; therefore, audio-visual synchrony perception exhibits flexible functions. The processing speed of visual stimuli affects the perception of audio-visual synchrony. The present study examined the effects of visual fields, in which visual stimuli are presented, for the processing of audio-visual temporal synchrony. The point of subjective simultaneity, the temporal binding window, and the rapid recalibration effect were measured using temporal order judgment, simultaneity judgment, and stream/bounce perception, because different mechanisms of temporal processing have been suggested among these three paradigms. The results indicate that auditory stimuli should be presented earlier for visual stimuli in the central visual field than in the peripheral visual field condition in order to perceive subjective simultaneity in the temporal order judgment task conducted in this study. Meanwhile, the subjective simultaneity bandwidth was broader in the central visual field than in the peripheral visual field during the simultaneity judgment task. In the stream/bounce perception task, neither the point of subjective simultaneity nor the temporal binding window differed between the two types of visual fields. Moreover, rapid recalibration occurred in both visual fields during the simultaneity judgment tasks. However, during the temporal order judgment task and stream/bounce perception, rapid recalibration occurred only in the central visual field. These results suggest that differences in visual processing speed based on the visual field modulate the temporal processing of audio-visual stimuli. Furthermore, these three tasks, temporal order judgment, simultaneity judgment, and stream/bounce perception, each have distinct functional characteristics for audio-visual synchrony perception. Future studies are necessary to confirm the effects of compensation regarding differences in the temporal resolution of the visual field in later cortical visual pathways on visual field differences in audio-visual temporal synchrony."

Weak grip strength was key role in diagnosis of sarcopenia and reported increased mortality, function declined in elderly. This study evaluated the association between GS and each common anthropometric characteristic in community-dwelling elderly.From 2017 to 2019, we conducted a community-based health survey among the elderly in Chiayi county, Taiwan. Participants were 65 years old or older, and total of 3,739 elderly subjects (1,600 males and 2,139 females) with a mean age of 76 years (range 65-85 years old) were recruited. General demographic data and lifestyle patterns were measured using a standard questionnaire. Anthropometric characteristics such as body height, body weight, body mass index (BMI), body waist and hip circumference, and body fat were measured by standard methods. GS was measured using a digital dynamometers (TKK5101) method.The mean GS was 32.8 ± 7.1 kg for males and 21.6 ± 4.8 kg for females (p < 0.001). For both sexes, elderly subjects with the same body weight but smaller body waist circumference had greater GS. The subjects with the same body waist size but heavier weight had greater GS. Furthermore, after adjusting for age, lifestyles, disease status, and potential anthropometric variable, multivariate regression analyses indicated that BMI was positively associated with GS (for males, beta = 0.310 and for females beta = 0.143, both p < 0.001) and body waist was negatively associated with GS (for males, beta = -0.108, p < 0.001; for females, beta = -0.030, p = 0.061).This study suggested that old adults with higher waist circumstance had weaker GS. Waist circumstance was negatively associated with GS, body weight was positively associated with GS in contrast. It may implies that central obesity was more important than overweight for GS in elderly."

Seventy five (75) study participants were recruited in the study using convenient sampling technique. Bacterial culture and identification was performed using standard microbiology laboratory procedures whereas broth microdilution method was used to establish the susceptibility of the identified pathogens. Data for objective one (1) was summarized as proportions while the categorized variables were analyzed using logistic regression to determine whether they were associated with the resistance patterns. The level of significance was preset at 5% and p-values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.Generally, all isolates had complete susceptibility (100%) to Cefoperazone+Sulbactam 2g except 7.1% of proteus spp that were resistant. Of all the bacterial isolates studied, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacter agglomerans, providencia spp and pseudomonas earuginosa had complete resistance (100%) to Cefopodoxime 200mg while providencia spp and pseudomomas earuginosa had complete resistance (100%) to Cefixime 400mg and cefotaxime 1g. Finally, higher odds of bacterial resistance to more 2 brands of the third generation cephalosporins were observed among participants who had prior exposure to the third generation cephalosporins (OR, 2.22, 95% CI, 0.80-6.14), comorbidities (OR, 1.76, 95% CI, 0.62-4.96) and those who had more than two hospitalizations in a year (OR, 1.39, 95% CI 0.46-4.25). However, multivariate logistic regression was not performed since no factor was significantly associated with resistance to more than two brands of third generation cephalosporins (p >0.05).This study found that cefixime and cefpodoixme had high rates of resistance and should not be used in routine management of infected chronic wounds. In addition, the factors investigated in this study were not significantly associated with bacterial resistance to more than two brands of third generation cephalosporins."
https://openalex.org/W4200565365,"To investigate the effect of influenza vaccination with or without probiotic supplementation on the immune response and incidence of influenza-like illness (ILI) in the elderly.A randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with a modified factorial design was conducted in 554 healthy elderly subjects aged 67 ± 5.6 (ranging from 60-90) years old in the Primary Health Care Center (Puskesmas area) of the Pulo Gadung District East Jakarta. Subjects received either a trivalent influenza vaccine or placebo at the start of the study, and a probiotic supplement (Lactobacillus helveticus R0052 and Lactobacillus rhamnosus R0011) or a placebo for 6 months. Subjects were randomly assigned into four intervention groups: influenza vaccine and probiotics (n = 141), influenza vaccine and placebo (n = 136), placebo and probiotics (n = 140), and both placebo (n = 137). The primary outcome was ILI incidence within 6 months. The secondary outcomes were seroprotection and seroconversion rates at 1, 4, and 6 months after administering the interventions.This study showed that the trivalent influenza vaccine increased seroprotection (RR 3.6 [95%CI 2.92-4.47]; p<0.010) and seroconversion (RR 29.8 [95%CI 11.1-79.5]; p<0.010) rates 1 month after vaccination in elderly people while the probiotic supplement did not alter influenza antibody titers (p = 1.000 and p = 0.210). The relative ILI incidence risk was similar between vaccinated and non-vaccinated groups, as well as in the probiotic group compared to the non-probiotic group.The tested trivalent influenza vaccine significantly induced seroprotection and seroconversion in the vaccinated subjects, while probiotics administration did not influence these parameters. Vaccinated individuals displayed a similarly low ILI incidence as those in the Control Group. However, the observed trend towards a reduction of ILI incidence with probiotics supplementation warrants further assessments in a larger, at-risk population.NCT03695432."

We investigated the impact of statin use in patients with early LB.In this post-hoc analysis, the association between statin use and clinical and microbiologic characteristics was investigated in 1520 adult patients with early LB manifesting as erythema migrans (EM), enrolled prospectively in several clinical trials between June 2006 and October 2019 at a single-center university hospital. Patients were assessed at enrollment and followed for 12 months.Statin users were older than patients not using statins, but statin use was not associated with Borrelia seropositivity rate, Borrelia skin culture positivity rate, or disease severity as assessed by erythema size or the presence of LB-associated symptoms. The time to resolution of EM was comparable in both groups. The odds for incomplete recovery decreased with time from enrollment, were higher in women, in patients with multiple EM, and in those reporting LB-associated symptoms at enrollment, but were unaffected by statin use.Statin use was not associated with clinical and microbiologic characteristics or long-term outcome in early LB."

While it is expected that residents will provide feedback to peers, there has been no social network study of the hierarchy through which feedback flows.Data for this study was drawn from clinical records of peer corrections exchanged between TC residents in six units kept over periods of less than two to over eight years. Four of the units served men while two served women. Hierarchy position was measured using eigenvector centrality, on the assumption that residents who were more central in the network of corrections were lower in the hierarchy. It was hypothesized that residents would rise in the hierarchy over time. This was tested using Wilcoxon paired samples tests comparing the mean and maximum eigenvector centrality for time in treatment with those in the last month of treatment. It was also hypothesized that residents who rose higher in the hierarchy were more likely to graduate, the outcome of primary interest. Logistic regression was used to test hierarchy position as a predictor of graduation, controlling for age, race, risk of recidivism as measured by the Level of Services Inventory-Revised (LSI-R) and days spent in the program.Residents averaged a statistically significantly lower eigenvector centrality in the last month in all units, indicating a rise in the hierarchy over time. Residents with lower maximum and average eigenvector centrality both over the length of treatment and in the last month of treatment were more likely to graduate in four of the six units, those with lower maximum and average eigenvector centrality in the last month but not over the length of treatment were more likely to graduate in one of the six units, while eigenvector centrality did not predict graduation in one unit. However, this last unit was much smaller than the others, which may have influenced the results.These results suggest that TC residents move through a social network hierarchy and that movement through the hierarchy predicts successful graduation."
https://openalex.org/W4200166220,"The detection and identification of heavy metal contaminants are becoming increasingly important as environmental pollution causes an ever-increasing health hazard in the last decades. Bacterial heavy metal reporters, which constitute an environmentally friendly and cheap approach, offer great help in this process. Although their application has great potential in the detection of heavy metal contamination, their sensitivity still needs to be improved. In this study, we describe a simple molecular biology approach to improve the sensitivity of bacterial heavy metal biosensors. The constructs are luxAB marker genes regulated by the promoters of heavy metal exporter genes. We constructed a mutant strain lacking the cluster of genes responsible for heavy metal transport and hence achieved increased intracellular heavy metal content of the Synechocystis PCC6803 cyanobacterium. Taking advantage of this increased intracellular heavy metal concentration the Ni2+; Co2+ and Zn2+ detection limits of the constructs were three to tenfold decreased compared to the sensitivity of the same constructs in the wild-type cyanobacterium."
https://openalex.org/W4200169041,"We have used long-read single molecule, real-time (SMRT) sequencing to fully characterize a ~12Mb genomic region on chromosome Xq24-q27, significantly linked to bipolar disorder (BD) in an extended family from a genetic sub-isolate. This family segregates BD in at least four generations with 24 affected individuals.We selected 16 family members for targeted sequencing. The selected individuals either carried the disease haplotype, were non-carriers of the disease haplotype, or served as married-in controls. We designed hybrid capture probes enriching for 5-9Kb fragments spanning the entire 12Mb region that were then sequenced to screen for candidate structural variants (SVs) that could explain the increased risk for BD in this extended family.Altogether, 201 variants were detected in the critically linked region. Although most of these represented common variants, three variants emerged that showed near-perfect segregation among all BD type I affected individuals. Two of the SVs were identified in or near genes belonging to the RNA Binding Motif Protein, X-Linked (RBMX) gene family-a 330bp Alu (subfamily AluYa5) deletion in intron 3 of the RBMX2 gene and an intergenic 27bp tandem repeat deletion between the RBMX and G protein-coupled receptor 101 (GPR101) genes. The third SV was a 50bp tandem repeat insertion in intron 1 of the Coagulation Factor IX (F9) gene.Among the three genetically linked SVs, additional evidence supported the Alu element deletion in RBMX2 as the leading candidate for contributing directly to the disease development of BD type I in this extended family."
https://openalex.org/W4200324914,"Physicians and nurses working in acute care settings, such as tertiary hospitals, are involved in various stages of critical and terminal care, ranging from diagnosis of life-threatening diseases to care for the dying. It is well known that critical and terminal care causes moral distress to healthcare professionals. This study aimed to explore moral distress in critical and terminal care in acute hospital settings by analyzing the experiences of physicians and nurses from various departments. Semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted in two tertiary hospitals in South Korea. The collected data were analyzed using grounded theory. A total of 22 physicians and nurses who had experienced moral difficulties regarding critical and terminal care were recruited via purposive maximum variation sampling, and 21 reported moral distress. The following points were what participants believed to be right for the patients: minimizing meaningless interventions during the terminal stage, letting patients know of their poor prognosis, saving lives, offering palliative care, and providing care with compassion. However, family dominance, hierarchy, the clinical culture of avoiding the discussion of death, lack of support for the surviving patients, and intensive workload challenged what the participants were pursuing and frustrated them. As a result, the participants experienced stress, lack of enthusiasm, guilt, depression, and skepticism. This study revealed that healthcare professionals working in tertiary hospitals in South Korea experienced moral distress when taking care of critically and terminally ill patients, in similar ways to the medical staff working in other settings. On the other hand, the present study uniquely identified that the aspects of saving lives and the necessity of palliative care were reported as those valued by healthcare professionals. This study contributes to the literature by adding data collected from two tertiary hospitals in South Korea."
https://openalex.org/W4200326798,"Compressive Sensing (CS) based data collection schemes are found to be effective in enhancing the data collection performance and lifetime of IoT based WSNs. However, they face major challenges related to key distribution and adversary attacks in hostile and complex network deployments. As a result, such schemes cannot effectively ensure the security of data. Towards the goal of providing high security and efficiency in data collection performance of IoT based WSNs, we propose a new security scheme that amalgamates the advantages of CS and Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC). We present an efficient algorithms to enhance the security and efficiency of CS based data collection in IoT-based WSNs. The proposed scheme operates in five main phases, namely Key Generation, CS-Key Exchange, Data Compression with CS Encryption, Data Aggregation and Encryption with ECC algorithm, and CS Key Re-generation. It considers the benefits of ECC as public key algorithm and CS as encryption and compression method to provide security as well as energy efficiency for cluster based WSNs. Also, it solves the CS- Encryption key distribution problem by introducing a new key sharing method that enables secure exchange of pseudo-random key between the BS and the nodes in a simple way. In addition, a new method is introduced to safeguard the CS scheme from potential security attacks. The efficiency of our proposed technique in terms of security, energy consumption and network lifetime is proved through simulation analysis."
https://openalex.org/W4200407874,"We studied farmworker practices and beliefs potentially contributing to transmission of bacteria and their associated antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) among animals and farm workers to identify potential behavioral interventions to reduce the risk of bacterial transmission. Ten focus groups were conducted on eight Wisconsin dairy farms to assess potentially high-risk practices and farmworker knowledge and experiences with antibiotic use and resistance using the Systems Engineering in Patient Safety (SEIPS) framework. Farmworkers were asked to describe common on-farm tasks and the policies guiding these practices. We found workers demonstrated knowledge of the role of antibiotic stewardship in preventing the spread of ARGs. Worker knowledge of various forms of personal protective equipment was higher for workers who commonly reported glove-use. Additionally, workers knowledge regarding the importance of reducing ARG transmission varied but was higher than we had hypothesized. Programs to reduce ARG spread on dairy farms should focus on proper hand hygiene and personal protective equipment use at the level of knowledge, beliefs, and practices."
https://openalex.org/W4200416329,"Despite remarkable academic efforts, why Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) post-implementation success occurs still remains elusive. A reason for this shortage may be the insufficient addressing of an ERP-specific interior boundary condition, i.e., the multi-stakeholder perspective, in explaining this phenomenon. This issue may entail a gap between how ERP success is supposed to occur and how ERP success may actually occur, leading to theoretical inconsistency when investigating its causal roots. Through a case-based, inductive approach, this manuscript presents an ERP success causal network that embeds the overlooked boundary condition and offers a theoretical explanation of why the most relevant observed causal relationships may occur. The results provide a deeper understanding of the ERP success causal mechanisms and informative managerial suggestions to steer ERP initiatives towards long-haul success."

Results Aiming at the problems of poor data integrity, low efficiency and poor serialization efficiency of traditional data storage information, this article introduces Protobuf technology to study the serialization of data storage information. The serpentine gap method is used to complete the allocation interval of the sequence nodes, so that the working state and the resting state always maintain a dynamic balance. According to the first-level rules, the storage data of the completed target node is obtained, and the grammatical structure and the semantics of the target data are analyzed, Meanwhile corresponding correspondences are established, and the data storage information is serialized. In order to verify the effectiveness of Protobuf’s data storage information serialization method, a comparative experiment is designed. By using three methods of HDVM, Redis and Protobuf to serialize JSON data, the comparative analysis shows that HDVM has the longest processing time and Protobuf has the shortest processing time, and the data integrity is not affected. The simulation data shows that the Protobuf serialization method has short conversion time, high space utilization, and the Obvious advantages in correctness and integrity. It is vary suitable for serialization of JSON data in the case of limited bandwidth."
https://openalex.org/W4200505414,"Corrosion in carbon-steel pipelines leads to failure, which is a major cause of breakdown maintenance in the oil and gas industries. The acoustic emission (AE) signal is a reliable method for corrosion detection and classification in the modern Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) system. The efficiency of this system in detection and classification mainly depends on the suitable AE features. Therefore, many feature extraction and classification methods have been developed for corrosion detection and severity assessment. However, the extraction of appropriate AE features and classification of various levels of corrosion utilizing these extracted features are still challenging issues. To overcome these issues, this article proposes a hybrid machine learning approach that combines Wavelet Packet Transform (WPT) integrated with Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) for multiresolution feature extraction and Linear Support Vector Classifier (L-SVC) for predicting corrosion severity levels. A Laboratory-based Linear Polarization Resistance (LPR) test was performed on carbon-steel samples for AE data acquisition over a different time span. AE signals were collected at a high sampling rate with a sound well AE sensor using AEWin software. Simulation results show a linear relationship between the proposed approach-based extracted AE features and the corrosion process. For multi-class problems, three corrosion severity stages have been made based on the corrosion rate over time and AE activity. The ANOVA test results indicate the significance within and between the feature-groups where F-values (F-value>1) rejects the null hypothesis and P-values (P-value<0.05) are less than the significance level. The utilized L-SVC classifier achieves higher prediction accuracy of 99.0% than the accuracy of other benchmarked classifiers. Findings of our proposed machine learning approach confirm that it can be effectively utilized for corrosion detection and severity assessment in SHM applications."

However, real-world data on the use and outcomes of FFR-guided PCI remain limited. Thus, we investigated the outcomes of patients undergoing FFR-guided PCI compared to angiography-guided PCI in a large, state-wide unselected cohort.All patients undergoing PCI between June 2017 and June 2018 in New South Wales, Australia, were included. The cohort was stratified into the FFR-guided group when concomitant FFR was performed, and the angiography-guided group when no FFR was performed. The primary outcome was a combined endpoint of death or myocardial infarction (MI). Secondary outcomes included all-cause death, cardiovascular (CVS) death, and MI. The cohort comprised 10,304 patients, of which 542 (5%) underwent FFR-guided PCI. During a mean follow-up of 12±4 months, the FFR-guided PCI group had reduced occurrence of the primary outcome (hazard ratio [HR] 0.34, 95% confidence intervals [CI] 0.20-0.56, P<0.001), all-cause death (HR 0.18, 95% CI 0.07-0.47, P = 0.001), CVS death (HR 0.21, 95% CI 0.07-0.66, P = 0.01), and MI (HR 0.46, 95% CI 0.25-0.84, P = 0.01) compared to the angiography-guided PCI group. Multivariable Cox regression analysis showed FFR-guidance to be an independent predictor of the primary outcome (HR 0.45, 95% CI 0.27-0.75, P = 0.002), all-cause death (HR 0.22, 95% CI 0.08-0.59, P = 0.003), and CVS death (HR 0.27, 95% CI 0.09-0.83, P = 0.02).In this real-world study of patients undergoing PCI, FFR-guidance was associated with lower rates of the primary outcome of death or MI, as well as the secondary outcomes of all-cause death and CVS death."

In this study, the effect of automation of measurements of retinal vessel oxygen saturation and vessel diameter is explored.Until now, operators have had to choose each vessel segment to be measured explicitly. A new, automatic version of the software automatically selects the vessels once the operator defines a measurement area. Five operators analyzed image pairs from the right eye of 23 healthy subjects with semiautomated retinal oximetry analysis software, Oxymap Analyzer (v2.5.1), and an automated version (v3.0). Inter- and intra-operator variability was investigated using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) between oxygen saturation measurements of vessel segments in the same area of the retina.For semiautomated saturation measurements, the inter-rater ICC was 0.80 for arterioles and venules. For automated saturation measurements, the inter-rater ICC was 0.97 for arterioles and 0.96 for venules. For semiautomated diameter measurements, the inter-rater ICC was 0.71 for arterioles and venules. For automated diameter measurements the inter-rater ICC was 0.97 for arterioles and 0.95 for venules. The inter-rater ICCs were different (p < 0.01) between the semiautomated and automated version in all instances.Automated measurements of retinal oximetry values are more repeatable compared to measurements where vessels are selected manually."

Here we present MFmap (model fidelity map), a machine learning model to simultaneously predict the cancer subtype of a cell line and its similarity to an individual tumour sample. The MFmap is a semi-supervised generative model, which compresses high dimensional gene expression, copy number variation and mutation data into cancer subtype informed low dimensional latent representations. The accuracy (test set F1 score >90%) of the MFmap subtype prediction is validated in ten different cancer datasets. We use breast cancer and glioblastoma cohorts as examples to show how subtype specific drug sensitivity can be translated to individual tumour samples. The low dimensional latent representations extracted by MFmap explain known and novel subtype specific features and enable the analysis of cell-state transformations between different subtypes. From a methodological perspective, we report that MFmap is a semi-supervised method which simultaneously achieves good generative and predictive performance and thus opens opportunities in other areas of computational biology."
https://openalex.org/W4200080656,"We propose a framework of Resources, Achievement, Status, and Events (RASE) that allows the many disparate but well-documented phenomena affecting underrepresented groups in STEM to be assembled into a story of career trajectories, illuminating the possible cumulative impact of many small inequities. Our framework contains a three-component deterministic cycle of (1) production of Achievements from Resources, (2) updated community Status due to Achievements, and (3) accrual of additional Resources based on community Status. A fourth component, stochastic Events, can influence an individual’s level of Resources or Achievements at each time step of the cycle. We build a specific mathematical model within the RASE framework and use it to investigate the impact of accumulated disadvantages from multiple compounding variables. We demonstrate that the model can reproduce data of observed disparities in academia. Finally, we use a publicly available visualization and networking tool to provide a sandbox for exploring career outcomes within the model. The modeling exercise, results, and visualization tool may be useful in the context of training STEM faculty to recognize and reduce effects of bias."
https://openalex.org/W4200167522,"Feedback is essential for many kinds of learning, but the cognitive processes involved in learning from feedback are unclear. Models of category learning incorporate selective attention to stimulus features while generating a response, but during the feedback phase of an experiment, it is assumed that participants receive complete information about stimulus features as well as the correct category. The present work looks at eye tracking data from six category learning datasets covering a variety of category complexities and types. We find that selective attention to task-relevant information is pervasive throughout feedback processing, suggesting a role for selective attention in memory encoding of category exemplars. We also find that error trials elicit additional stimulus processing during the feedback phase. Finally, our data reveal that participants increasingly skip the processing of feedback altogether. At the broadest level, these three findings reveal that selective attention is ubiquitous throughout the entire category learning task, functioning to emphasize the importance of certain stimulus features, the helpfulness of extra stimulus encoding during times of uncertainty, and the superfluousness of feedback once one has learned the task. We discuss the implications of our findings for modelling efforts in category learning from the perspective of researchers trying to capture the full dynamic interaction of selective attention and learning, as well as for researchers focused on other issues, such as category representation, whose work only requires simplifications that do a reasonable job of capturing learning."

The proportion of households that owned at least one ITN was 97.1%. The number of households having at least one ITN for every two members was 386 (65.8%) and 3159 (86.8%) household population had access to ITN. The household population that slept in ITN the night before this survey was 2370 (65.1%). Lack of household access to ITN (AOR = 1.80; CI: 1.31, 2.47), having a family size of more than 10 members (AOR = 2.53; CI: 1.20, 4.24), having more than 10 rooms for sleeping in a household (AOR = 10.18; CI: 1.28, 81.00), having 2-4 screened windows (AOR = 1.49; CI: 1.00, 2.20), and having 8-10 screened windows (AOR = 3.57; CI: 1.25, 10.17) were significantly associated with increased odds of not sleeping in ITN the night before the survey. A total of 193 female sand flies were trapped from various locations within the study communities.Factors associated with ITN non-use such as lack of household access to ITN should be incorporated into future efforts to improve ITN use.

https://openalex.org/W4200468215,"In this paper, the algebraic topological characteristics of brain networks composed of electroencephalogram(EEG) signals induced by different quality images were studied, and on that basis, a neurophysiological image quality assessment approach was proposed. Our approach acquired quality perception-related neural information via integrating the EEG collection with conventional image assessment procedures, and the physiologically meaningful brain responses to different distortion-level images were obtained by topological data analysis. According to the validation experiment results, statistically significant discrepancies of the algebraic topological characteristics of EEG data evoked by a clear image compared to that of an unclear image are observed in several frequency bands, especially in the beta band. Furthermore, the phase transition difference of brain network caused by JPEG compression is more significant, indicating that humans are more sensitive to JPEG compression other than Gaussian blur. In general, the algebraic topological characteristics of EEG signals evoked by distorted images were investigated in this paper, which contributes to the study of neurophysiological assessment of image quality."
https://openalex.org/W4200470958,"Feature extraction is an important part of data processing that provides a basis for more complicated tasks such as classification or clustering. Recently many approaches for signal feature extraction were created. However, plenty of proposed methods are based on convolutional neural networks. This class of models requires a high amount of computational power to train and deploy and large dataset. Our work introduces a novel feature extraction method that uses wavelet transform to provide additional information in the Independent Component Analysis mixing matrix. The goal of our work is to combine good performance with a low inference cost. We used the task of Electrocardiography (ECG) heartbeat classification to evaluate the usefulness of the proposed approach. Experiments were carried out with an MIT-BIH database with four target classes (Normal, Vestibular ectopic beats, Ventricular ectopic beats, and Fusion strikes). Several base wavelet functions with different classifiers were used in experiments. Best was selected with 5-fold cross-validation and Wilcoxon test with significance level 0.05. With the proposed method for feature extraction and multi-layer perceptron classifier, we obtained 95.81% BAC-score. Compared to other literature methods, our approach was better than most feature extraction methods except for convolutional neural networks. Further analysis indicates that our method performance is close to convolutional neural networks for classes with a limited number of learning examples. We also analyze the number of required operations at test time and argue that our method enables easy deployment in environments with limited computing power."
https://openalex.org/W4200596135,"Monitoring oxidative stress biomarkers has become a powerful and common tool to estimate organismal condition and response to endogenous and environmental factors. In the present study, we used round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) from non-native European populations, as a model species to test sex differences in oxidative stress biomarkers. Considering sex differences in reproductive investment, we hypothesized that males would display lower resistance to abiotic stress. Fish were exposed to a heat shock (temperature elevated by 10°C) for 1h, 6h, and 12h and catalase activity (CAT), reduced glutathione (GSH), total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and lipid peroxidation (LPO) were measured in liver and muscle tissues. Liver of males was significantly more responsive compared to liver of females in all tested parameters. GSH was found to be the most responsive to heat stress exposure in both sexes. The results supported our hypothesis that male reproductive investment (territoriality, courtship, and brood care) and likelihood of only a single spawning period in their lifetime influenced on higher sensitivity of their antioxidant defence. On the other hand, for females antioxidant defence is considered more important to survive the environmental changes and successfully reproduce in the next season. Our experiments exposed fish to acute thermal stress. Further research should determine the effects of exposure to chronic thermal stress to corroborate our understanding on sex differences in antioxidant defence in the round goby."
https://openalex.org/W4226091512,"The paper discusses the analysis of the effect of using sewage sludge for fertilization on the level of soil and groundwater contamination with drug-resistant bacteria. Other sanitary contaminants in these environments were also analysed. Composted sewage sludge was introduced into the sandy soil over a period of 6 months. The examinations were conducted under conditions of a lysimetric experiment with the possibility of collecting soil leachates (in natural conditions). The following doses of sewage sludge were used: 0, 10, 20, 30 and 40 t/ha calculated per experimental object containing 10 kg of sandy soil. The research were carried out within the time frame of one year. Dactylis glomerata grass was grown on the fertilized soils. In soils and leachates from soils (which may have polluted groundwater) collected from fertilized experimental objects, the sanitary condition and quantity of drug-resistant bacteria (mainly from the families Enterobacteriaceae and Enterococcus) were analysed one year after fertilization. Their drug resistance to selected antibiotics was also analysed based on current recommendations. The study showed that fertilization with sewage sludge (even after stabilization and hygienization) results in contamination of soil and infiltrating waters with many species of drug-resistant pathogenic bacteria. The lowest level of contamination of soil and water environment was found after the application of sewage sludge at a dose of 10 t/ha. The isolated drug-resistant strains of intestinal bacteria were less sensitive to older generations of antibiotics including cefazolin, ampicillin, and co-amoxiclav."

The reference data for this study was provided by Finnish Food Authority (FFA) containing crop loss information of approximately 1.4 million field parcels in Finland covering about 3.5 million ha from 2000 to 2015. This reference data was combined with Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) derived from Landsat 7 images, in which more than 80% of the possible data are missing. Despite the hard problem with extremely noisy data, among the four ML models we tested, random forest (with mean imputation and missing value indicators) achieved the average AUC (area under the ROC curve) of 0.688±0.059 over all 16 years with the range [0.602, 0.795] in identifying new crop-loss fields based on reference fields of the same year. To our knowledge, this is one of the first large scale benchmark study of using machine learning for crop loss classification at field parcel scale. The classification setting and trained models have numerous potential applications, for example, allowing government agencies or insurance companies to verify crop-loss claims by farmers and realise efficient agricultural monitoring."
https://openalex.org/W4200118759,"The experiment was conducted to study the effect of chicory root powder on the gut performance of broilers. For this purpose, two hundred commercial male broiler chicks were randomly divided into 5 treatment groups with 8 replications of 5 birds each and reared in battery brooders up to 42 days of age. The experimental design consisted of; T1 basal diet (BD) without antibiotic, T2: BD + antibiotic (BMD at 500 gm/ton), T3: BD + chicory root powder (0.5%), T4: BD + chicory root powder (1.0%), T5: BD + chicory root powder (1.5%). The results revealed that supplementation of 1.0% chicory root powder recorded significantly (P&lt;0.05) higher body weight gain, feed intake and better feed conversion ratio (FCR) compared to antibiotic, control and 0.5 &amp; 1.5% chicory powder at 42 days of age. Supplementation of various levels of chicory root powder significantly (P&lt;0.05) lowered (P&lt;0.05) the pH in duodenum, jejunum, ileum and caecum compared to control. Supplementation of chicory root powder (0.5, 1.0 &amp; 1.5%) significantly (P&lt;0.05) decreased the E . coli and Salmonella counts and (P&lt;0.05) increased the Lactobacilli counts in ileum when compared to control and antibiotic groups. Supplementation of chicory (1.0% and 1.5%) groups significantly (P&lt;0.05) increased the villus height (VH), crypt depth (CD), VH:CD ratio and villus width (VW) in the duodenum, ileum and jejunum at 42 d of age. Supplementation of chicory 1.0% and 1.5% groups significantly (P&lt;0.05) increased the goblet cell number in duodenum, jejunum and ileum of broilers. Therefore, chicory root powder (1.0 and 1.5%) can be used as an alternative to antibiotic for improving gut performance of broiler chicken."
https://openalex.org/W4200415210,"Shared decision-making is recommended for decisions with multiple reasonable options, yet clinicians often subtly or explicitly guide choices. Using purposive sampling, we performed a secondary analysis of 142 audio-recorded encounters between 13 surgeons and women eligible for breast-conserving surgery with radiation or mastectomy. We trained 9 surgeons in shared decision-making and provided them one of two conversation aids; 4 surgeons practiced as usual. Based on a published taxonomy of treatment recommendations (pronouncements, suggestions, proposals, offers, assertions), we examined how surgeons framed choices with patients. Many surgeons made assertions providing information and advice (usual care 71% vs. intervention 66%; p = 0.54). Some made strong pronouncements (usual care 51% vs. intervention 36%; p = .09). Few made proposals and offers, leaving the door open for deliberation (proposals usual care 21% vs. intervention 26%; p = 0.51; offers usual care 40% vs. intervention 40%; p = 0.98). Surgeons were significantly more likely to describe options as comparable when using a conversation aid, mentioning this in all intervention group encounters (usual care 64% vs. intervention 100%; p<0.001). Conversation aids can facilitate offers of comparable options, but other conversational actions can inhibit aspects of shared decision-making."
https://openalex.org/W4200490176,"As advocated by WHO in ""Closing the Health Gap in a Generation"", dramatic differences in child health are closely linked to degrees of social disadvantage, both within and between communities. Nevertheless, research has not examined whether child health inequalities include, but are not confined to, worse acute respiratory infection (ARI) symptoms among the socioeconomic disadvantaged in Pakistan. In addition to such disadvantages as the child's gender, maternal education, and household poverty, the present study also examined the linkages between the community environment and ARI symptoms among Pakistan children under five. Furthermore, we have assessed gender contingencies related to the aforementioned associations.Using data from the nationally representative 2017-2018 Pakistan Demographic and Health Survey, a total of 11,908 surviving preschool age children (0-59 months old) living in 561 communities were analyzed. We employed two-level multilevel logistic regressions to model the relationship between ARI symptoms and individual-level and community-level social factors.The social factors at individual and community levels were found to be significantly associated with an increased risk of the child suffering from ARI symptoms. A particularly higher risk was observed among girls who resided in urban areas (AOR = 1.42; p<0.01) and who had a birth order of three or greater.Our results underscore the need for socioeconomic interventions in Pakistan that are targeted at densely populated households and communities within urban areas, with a particular emphasis on out-migration, in order to improve unequal economic underdevelopment. This could be done by targeting improvements in socio-economic structures, including maternal education."
https://openalex.org/W4200498780,"Directional response biases due to a conceptual link between space and number, such as a left-to-right hand bias for increasing numerical magnitude, are known as the SNARC (Spatial-Numerical Association of Response Codes) effect. We investigated how the SNARC effect for numerosities would be influenced by reading-writing direction, task instructions, and ambient visual environment in four literate populations exemplifying opposite reading-writing cultures—namely, Arabic (right-to-left script) and English (left-to-right script). Monoliterates and biliterates in Jordan and the U.S. completed a speeded numerosity comparison task to assess the directionality and magnitude of a SNARC effect in their numerosity processing. Monoliterates’ results replicated previously documented effects of reading-writing direction and task instructions: the SNARC effect found in left-to-right readers was weakened in right-to-left readers, and the left-to-right group exhibited a task-dependency effect (SNARC effect in the smaller condition, reverse SNARC effect in the larger condition). Biliterates’ results did not show a clear effect of environment; instead, both biliterate groups resembled English monoliterates in showing a left-to-right, task-dependent SNARC effect, albeit weaker than English monoliterates’. The absence of significant biases in all Arabic-reading groups (biliterates and Arabic monoliterates) points to a potential conflict between distinct spatial-numerical mapping codes. This view is explained in terms of the proposed Multiple Competing Codes Theory (MCCT), which posits three distinct spatial-numerical mapping codes (innate, cardinal, ordinal) during numerical processing—each involved at varying levels depending on individual and task factors."
https://openalex.org/W4200603266,"Foot health in zoo giraffe has been a topic of recent research, although little is known about the foot health of free-ranging giraffe. This study describes the foot shape and radiographic pathological changes in 27 young adult Nubian giraffe ( Giraffa camelopardalis camelopardalis ) from a translocation in Uganda (August 2017). Giraffe feet were observed to have a concave sole, the hoof wall was longest by the toe tip, and the weight-bearing surface of the foot was primarily along the periphery of the foot including hoof wall, parts of the heel, and the edge of the sole. Radiographs showed that pedal osteitis and sesamoid bone cysts were relatively uncommon (3/24 giraffe with osteitis, 1/24 giraffe with sesamoid cysts), and that no giraffe in the study had P3 joint osteoarthritis, P3 rotation, or P3 fractures. Radiographs consistently demonstrated a positive palmar/plantar angle with the sole of the hoof thicker at the heel than by the toe tip, with the non weight-bearing palmar/plantar angle measuring 1.6°- 4.3°. This is the first systematic review of foot shape and radiographs in free-ranging giraffe and demonstrates a low prevalence of foot pathologies. This study suggests qualitative differences in foot shape, foot health, radiographic anatomy, and foot pathologies when comparing free-ranging and zoo giraffe. Further research is needed to identify why these differences occur and whether husbandry modifications could help improve zoo giraffe foot health and prevent associated lameness."
https://openalex.org/W4226381421,"ST8SIA2 is an important molecule regulating expression of the phenotype involved in schizophrenia. Lowered promoter activity of the ST8SIA2 gene is considered to be protective against schizophrenia by conferring tolerance to psychosocial stress. Here, we examined the promoter-type composition of anatomically modern humans (AMHs) and archaic humans (AHs; Neanderthals and Denisovans), and compared the promoter activity at the population level (population promoter activity; PPA) between them. In AMHs, the TCT-type, showing the second lowest promoter activity, was most prevalent in the ancestral population of non-Africans. However, the detection of only the CGT-type from AH samples and recombination tracts in AH sequences showed that the CGT- and TGT-types, exhibiting the two highest promoter activities, were common in AH populations. Furthermore, interspecies gene flow occurred into AMHs from AHs and into Denisovans from Neanderthals, influencing promoter-type compositions independently in both AMHs and AHs. The difference of promoter-type composition makes PPA unique in each population. East and Southeast Asian populations show the lowest PPA. This results from the selective increase of the CGC-type, showing the lowest promoter activity, in these populations. Every non-African population shows significantly lower PPA than African populations, resulting from the TCT-type having the highest prevalence in the ancestral population of non-Africans. In addition, PPA reduction is also found among subpopulations within Africa via a slight increase of the TCT-type. These findings indicate a trend toward lower PPA in the spread of AMHs, interpreted as a continuous adaptation to psychosocial stress arising in migration. This trend is considered as genetic tuning for the evolution of collective brains. The inferred promoter-type composition of AHs differed markedly from that of AMHs, resulting in higher PPA in AHs than in AMHs. This suggests that the trend toward lower PPA is a unique feature in AMH spread."
