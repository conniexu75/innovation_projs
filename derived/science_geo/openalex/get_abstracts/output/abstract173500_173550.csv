https://openalex.org/W2039483201,"We report the observation of neural processing that occurs within 265 milliseconds after outcome stimuli that inform human participants about gains and losses in a gambling task. A negative-polarity event-related brain potential, probably generated by a medial-frontal region in or near the anterior cingulate cortex, was greater in amplitude when a participant's choice between two alternatives resulted in a loss than when it resulted in a gain. The sensitivity to losses was not simply a reflection of detecting an error; gains did not elicit the medial-frontal activity when the alternative choice would have yielded a greater gain, and losses elicited the activity even when the alternative choice would have yielded a greater loss. Choices made after losses were riskier and were associated with greater loss-related activity than choices made after gains. It follows that medial-frontal computations may contribute to mental states that participate in higher level decisions, including economic choices."

Although glia are affected by activity and ensheathe synapses, their influence on synaptic strength has largely been ignored. Here, we show that a protein produced by glia, tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), enhances synaptic efficacy by increasing surface expression of AMPA receptors. Preventing the actions of endogenous TNFα has the opposite effects. Thus, the continual presence of TNFα is required for preservation of synaptic strength at excitatory synapses. Through its effects on AMPA receptor trafficking, TNFα may play roles in synaptic plasticity and modulating responses to neural injury."

https://openalex.org/W2058614488,"The deposition of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides into amyloid plaques precedes the cognitive dysfunction of Alzheimer's disease (AD) by years. Biomarkers indicative of brain amyloid burden could be useful for identifying individuals at high risk for developing AD. As in AD in humans, baseline plasma Abeta levels in a transgenic mouse model of AD did not correlate with brain amyloid burden. However, after peripheral administration of a monoclonal antibody to Abeta (m266), we observed a rapid increase in plasma Abeta and the magnitude of this increase was highly correlated with amyloid burden in the hippocampus and cortex. This method may be useful for quantifying brain amyloid burden in patients at risk for or those who have been diagnosed with AD."
https://openalex.org/W2123577912,"One role of messenger RNA (mRNA) degradation is to maintain the fidelity of gene expression by degrading aberrant transcripts. Recent results show that mRNAs without translation termination codons are unstable in eukaryotic cells. We used yeast mutants to demonstrate that these ""nonstop"" mRNAs are degraded by the exosome in a 3'-to-5' direction. The degradation of nonstop transcripts requires the exosome-associated protein Ski7p. Ski7p is closely related to the translation elongation factor EF1A and the translation termination factor eRF3. This suggests that the recognition of nonstop mRNAs involves the binding of Ski7p to an empty aminoacyl-(RNA-binding) site (A site) on the ribosome, thereby bringing the exosome to a mRNA with a ribosome stalled near the 3' end. This system efficiently degrades mRNAs that are prematurely polyadenylated within the coding region and prevents their expression."
https://openalex.org/W2115809836,"Translation is an important mechanism to monitor the quality of messenger RNAs (mRNAs), as exemplified by the translation-dependent recognition and degradation of transcripts harboring premature termination codons (PTCs) by the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway. We demonstrate in yeast that mRNAs lacking all termination codons are as labile as nonsense transcripts. Decay of ""nonstop"" transcripts in yeast requires translation but is mechanistically distinguished from NMD and the major mRNA turnover pathway that requires deadenylation, decapping, and 5'-to-3' exonucleolytic decay. These data suggest that nonstop decay is initiated when the ribosome reaches the 3' terminus of the message. We demonstrate multiple physiologic sources of nonstop transcripts and conservation of their accelerated decay in mammalian cells. This process regulates the stability and expression of mRNAs that fail to signal translational termination."
https://openalex.org/W2101189282,"The heat shock protein Gp96 has been shown to induce specific immune responses. On one hand, this phenomenon is based on the specific interaction with CD91 that mediates endocytosis and results in major histocompatibility complex class I-restricted representation of the Gp96-associated peptides. On the other hand, Gp96 induces activation of professional antigen-presenting cells, resulting in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and up-regulation of costimulatory molecules by unknown mechanisms. In this study, we have analyzed the consequences of Gp96 interaction with cells expressing different Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and with bone marrow-derived dendritic cells from mice lacking functional TLR2 and/or TLR4 molecules. We find that the Gp96-TLR2/4 interaction results in activation of nuclear factor κB-driven reporter genes and mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinases and induces IκBα degradation. Bone marrow-derived dendritic cells of C3H/HeJ and more pronounced C3H/HeJ/TLR2−/− mice fail to respond to Gp96. Interestingly, activation of bone marrow-derived dendritic cells depends on endocytosis of Gp96 molecules. Our results provide, for the first time, the molecular basis for understanding the Gp96-mediated activation of antigen-presenting cells by describing the simultaneous stimulation of the innate and adaptive immune system.

Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1991; 3: 654-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Specificity of the immune response is based on peptides that associate with HSPs as a consequence of their function as molecular chaperones (2Srivastava P.K. Menoret A. Basu S. Binder R.J.

Srivastava P.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 301: 919-981Google Scholar) and by the ability to generate cytotoxic T lymphocyte cell lines specific for a variety of antigens from mice immunized with HSP molecules (5Blachere N.E.

The HSPs that mediated this effect include the cytosolic HSP70 and HSP90 and the endoplasmic reticulum-resident chaperones calreticulin and Gp96 (8Udono H. Srivastava P.K. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 5398-5403PubMed Google Scholar, 9Basu S. Binder R.J. Ramalingam T. Srivastava P.K. Immunity. 2001; 14: 303-313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Gp96 molecules have been shown to induce cytotoxic T lymphocyte cross-priming against viral and minor histocompatibility antigens, supporting the hypothesis that Gp96 molecules are associated with a large repertoire of peptides not influenced by the cellular major histocompatibility complex expression (6Arnold D. Faath S. Rammensee H. Schild H. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 885-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 7Suto R. Srivastava P.K. Science. 1995; 269: 1585-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). HSP molecules can also provide an immunogenic context to synthetic peptides complexed to HSP70 or Gp96 molecules in vitro (10Blachere N.E., Li, Z. Chandawarkar R.Y. Suto R. Jaikaria N.S. Basu S. Udono H. Srivastava P.K. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1315-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 11Rock K.L. Gamble S. Rothstein L. Science. 1990; 249: 918-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Because of this, HSP molecules have been called adjuvants of mammalian origin (12Bevan M.J. J. Immunol. 1976; 117: 2233-2238PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, progress has been made in understanding the mechanisms that contribute to the efficient induction of immune responses against HSP-associated peptides.A receptor responsible for the uptake of HSP-peptide complexes has been identified as the α2-macroglobulin receptor CD91, expressed on professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs) (9Basu S. Binder R.J. Ramalingam T. Srivastava P.K. Immunity. 2001; 14: 303-313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar, 13Binder R.J. Han D.K. Srivastava P.K. Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). Only receptor-mediated endocytosis has been shown to result in the representation of HSP-associated peptides by MHC class I molecules, thus explaining the high efficiency of this process (14Singh-Jasuja H. Toes R.E. Spee P. Munz C. Hilf N. Schoenberger S.P. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Neefjes J. Rammensee H.G. Arnold-Schild D. Schild H. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 1965-1974Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). However, the ideal adjuvant should not only target the antigen to professional APCs, it should also induce APC activation to provide the proper costimuli required for efficient induction of the immune response. For HSPs, especially HSP70, HSP90, and Gp96, this ability has been demonstrated recently. The exposure of macrophages or DCs to HSPs resulted in up-regulation of major histocompatibility complex class II and costimulatory molecules and in tumor necrosis factor α and IL-12 secretion (15Asea A. Kraeft S.K. Kurt-Jones E.A. Stevenson M.A. Chen L.B. Finberg R.W. Koo G.C. Calderwood S.K. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 435-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (1354) Google Scholar, 16Singh-Jasuja H. Scherer H.U.

Srivastava P.K. Int. Immunol. 2000; 12: 1539-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar). The contribution of this mechanism in situations of physiological relevance is supported by the observation that necrotic but not apoptotic cell death leads to the release of HSPs (17Basu S. Binder R.J. Suto R. Anderson K.M. Srivastava P.K. Int. Immunol. 2000; 12: 1539-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar, 18Berwin B. Reed R.C. Nicchitta C.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21083-21088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), thus activating the innate arm of the immune system to attract cells equipped with antigen-specific receptors.The molecular basis for this process, however, has not been understood thus far. Studies investigating the stimulatory effect of HSP60 on epithelial cells and that of HSP60 and HSP70 on macrophages demonstrated the involvement of CD14 molecules, suggesting the participation of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) (19Chen W. Syldath U. Bellmann K. Burkart V. Kolb H. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 3212-3219PubMed Google Scholar). In Drosophila, Toll participates, in addition to the induction (coordination) of dorsal-ventral patterning during embryogenesis, in the defense against fungi by the induction of drosomycin secretion as an early form of innate immune response against infection (20Lemaitre B. Nicolas E. Michaut L. Reichhart J.M. Hoffmann J.A. Cell. 1996; 86: 973-983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2954) Google Scholar). In mammals, TLRs are involved in the response to pathogens by the recognition of so-called pathogen-associated molecular patterns. These include lipopolysaccharide (LPS), peptidoglycans, and lipoproteins and bacterial CpG DNA, which are recognized by TLR4, TLR2, and TLR9, respectively (21Aderem A. Ulevitch R.J. Nature. 2000; 406: 782-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2603) Google Scholar, 22Hemmi H. Takeuchi O. Kawai T. Kaisho T. Sato S. Sanjo H. Matsumoto M. Hoshino K. Wagner H. Takeda K. Akira S. Nature. 2000; 408: 740-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (5310) Google Scholar). The TLR signaling pathway shares most components with the IL-1 receptor signaling pathway responsible for activation of the innate immune system (21Aderem A. Ulevitch R.J. Nature. 2000; 406: 782-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2603) Google Scholar).Recently, HSPs have been linked to TLRs by the observation that HSP60 failed to activate TLR4-defective macrophages from C3H/HeJ mice (23Ohashi K. Burkart V. Flohe S. Kolb H. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 558-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (1356) Google Scholar). Subsequently, it was shown that genetic complementation of nonresponder cells with TLR4 or TLR2 restores responsiveness (gain of function) to HSP60, whereas TLR2−/− or TLR4-deficient cells exhibit a “loss of function.” Surprisingly, macrophage activation was equally well induced by bacterial and endogenous mammalian HSP60. Thus, the presence of molecular patterns that interact with members of the TLR family is not limited to pathogen-derived molecules. Because of this, HSP60 has been proposed to serve as a danger signal for the innate immune system (19Chen W. Syldath U. Bellmann K. Burkart V. Kolb H. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 3212-3219PubMed Google Scholar). HSP60 is not associated with antigenic peptides 2A. Schild and H. Schild, unpublished observation.2A. Schild and H. Schild, unpublished observation. and is found much earlier in phylogeny, as are the TLR and IL-1 receptor families. Therefore, it remains unclear whether the HSP/TLR pathway is used solely by the innate immune system to fight pathogens by unspecific mechanisms or whether HSPs with peptide binding ability, such as Gp96, also use this mechanism to link nonspecific immunostimulatory capacities with their specific, peptide-based features with the activation of the adaptive immune system.In this study, we decided to analyze the functional consequences of the interaction of Gp96 with members of the TLR family.DISCUSSIONWe identified the molecular mechanism of APC activation by the endoplasmic reticulum-resident chaperone Gp96. We find that TLR2 and TLR4 mediate NF-κB-driven luciferase induction (Fig. 1) and that mainly TLR4 and, to a small extent, TLR2 are responsible for the up-regulation of CD86 and the secretion of IL-12 and tumor necrosis factor α (Figs. 2 and 3). IL-10 was not detectable (<1.5 ng/ml; data not shown), which is in line with the previously reported secretion of only pro-inflammatory cytokines (14Singh-Jasuja H. Toes R.E. Spee P. Munz C. Hilf N. Schoenberger S.P. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Neefjes J. Rammensee H.G. Arnold-Schild D. Schild H. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 1965-1974Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 17Basu S. Binder R.J. Suto R. Anderson K.M. Srivastava P.K. Int. Immunol. 2000; 12: 1539-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar). TLR3, TLR7, and TLR8 molecules appear not to be involved in Gp96-mediated signaling (data not shown). Expression of CD86 and cytokine secretion are preceded by the NF-κB pathway and activation of the SAPKs JNK1/2 and p38 as well as the mitogen-activated protein kinase ERK1/2 (Fig. 4). DC activation is inhibited by MDC, which interferes with receptor-mediated endocytosis (Figs. Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7).Despite the fact that Gp96 and LPS are very different molecules, they both mediate DC activation via TLR4 and TLR2. The nature of the pathogen-associated molecular pattern of HSPs that allows their specific interaction with TLR2 and TLR4 is unknown. We are currently investigating the possibility that Gp96 and microbial components interfere with each other in binding to both TLRs. However, regardless of their shared interaction with TLR2 and TLR4 molecules, several differences in their mode of action are apparent. The most striking observation is that the Gp96-mediated DC activation strictly depends on the endocytosis of Gp96, whereas LPS-mediated DC activation does not require endocytosis and thus functions in the presence of the endocytosis inhibitor MDC. As a consequence, Gp96- but not LPS-mediated secretion of cytokines is impaired in the presence of MDC (Fig. 6). This, together with the observed sensitivity of Gp96-mediated DC activation to heat denaturation, also demonstrates that an endotoxin contamination in the Gp96 preparation does not account for the observed effects.This is further supported by the observation that cells expressing Gp96 molecules targeted to their surface induce efficient DC maturation upon cell-to-cell contact (35Zheng H. Dai J. Stoilova D. Li Z. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 6731-6735Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Internalization of TLR2 during the activation of macrophages has been observed previously (29Underhill D.M. Ozinsky A. Hajjar A.M. Stevens A. Wilson C.B. Bassetti M. Aderem A. Nature. 1999; 401: 811-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (1187) Google Scholar). In this series of experiments, TLR2 was found to accumulate in phagosomes of macrophages activated with the yeast cell wall particle zymosan. Whether or not endocytosis was a prerequisite for activation was not investigated. Our results obtained with Gp96 as an agonist for TLR2 and TLR4 suggest this to be the case.The importance of HSP endocytosis for macrophage activation has very recently been reported for the HSP60/TLR2/4-mediated activation of macrophages (30Vabulas R.M. Ahmad-Nejad P. da Costa C. Miethke T. Kirschning C.J. Haecker H. Wagner H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31332-31339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). Here we observe the same effect for the new TLR2 and TLR4 ligand, Gp96, and extent. Our finding parallels the need for Gp96 endocytosis during receptor-mediated uptake and representation of Gp96-associated peptides (14Singh-Jasuja H. Toes R.E. Spee P. Munz C. Hilf N. Schoenberger S.P. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Neefjes J. Rammensee H.G. Arnold-Schild D. Schild H. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 1965-1974Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 26Arnold-Schild D. Hanau D. Spehner D. Schmid C. Rammensee H.G. de la Salle H. Schild H. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 3757-3760PubMed Google Scholar) that is mediated through the interaction of Gp96 with CD91, the receptor for α2-macroglobulin (9Basu S. Binder R.J. Ramalingam T. Srivastava P.K. Immunity. 2001; 14: 303-313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar, 13Binder R.J. Han D.K. Srivastava P.K. Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). Interestingly, MDC had first been described as an inhibitor of endocytosis of the α2-macroglobulin receptor (28Davies P.J. Davies D.R. Levitzki A. Maxfield F.R. Milhaud P. Willingham M.C. Pastan I.H. Nature. 1980; 283: 162-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar).An interesting scenario can be postulated from the above findings: similar to the proposed requirement of LPS-mediated activation for CD14 and LPS-binding protein on the cell surface (reviewed in Ref. 31Golenbock D.T. Fenton M.J. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 286-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), Gp96-mediated DC activation might depend on the presence of CD91 molecules that endocytose bound Gp96 molecules and subsequently mediate their transport to endocytic vesicles, as described previously (26Arnold-Schild D. Hanau D. Spehner D. Schmid C. Rammensee H.G. de la Salle H. Schild H. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 3757-3760PubMed Google Scholar). This process will increase the local concentration of Gp96, now able to trigger signaling through TLR2 and TLR4 present in these vesicles (32Wagner H. Immunity. 2001; 14: 499-502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) by the recruitment of cytosolic MyD88 to the outer membrane of endocytic vesicles.The contribution of TLR2 to Gp96-mediated DC activation is not clear. Whereas transfection of TLR2 induces NF-κB-driven luciferase activity (Fig. 1), TLR2−/− mice show normal Gp96-mediated DC activation profiles (Figs. 2 and 3 b). On the other hand, Gp96-mediated DC activation in C3H/HeJ mice is always stronger than that in TLR2−/−/TLR4-deficient mice, which are not able to respond to a Gp96 stimulus at all. This observation suggests a minor contribution of TLR2. In TLR2−/− mice, the lack of TLR2 signaling can apparently be completely compensated by TLR4, but TLR2 can induce only minimal activation when TLR4 is not functional, as observed for BMDCs from C3H/HeJ mice. One explanation could be an imbalance in the expression of TLR2 and TLR4 on BMDCs, favoring effects mediated by TLR4.However, the interaction of both TLR molecules with Gp96 is strongly supported by the recent finding that the interaction of TLR2 and TLR4 with Gp96 inside the endoplasmic reticulum is crucial for the expression of these receptors on the cell surface (33Randow F. Seed B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 891-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar).Thus far, TLRs have been described as sensors for pathogen-associated molecular patterns crucial for the initiation of an innate immune response. These mechanisms were developed long before the adaptive immune system. One of the newest additions to the list of TLR ligands identified is HSP60. Interestingly, not only bacterial but also human HSP60 cross-reacts with TLRs (30Vabulas R.M. Ahmad-Nejad P. da Costa C. Miethke T. Kirschning C.J. Haecker H. Wagner H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31332-31339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). Our results now demonstrate that the exclusive association of TLRs with pathogen-associated molecular patterns is obsolete. Gp96 is not expressed in bacteria or fungi and provides the first example of a non-pathogen-derived ligand of TLRs. More importantly, our results show for the first time how the innate and adaptive immune system can be stimulated simultaneously by the same molecule that is released under physiological situations from necrotic cells (17Basu S. Binder R.J. Suto R. Anderson K.M. Srivastava P.K. Int. Immunol. 2000; 12: 1539-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar, 18Berwin B. Reed R.C. Nicchitta C.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21083-21088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The importance of these TLR-mediated stimuli for the induction of T helper type 1-dominated immune responses has been observed recently using MyD88−/− mice (34Schnare M. Barton G.M. Holt A.C. Takeda K. Akira S. Medzhitor R. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 947-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (1169) Google Scholar).Gp96 has kept the ability (probably HSP60-derived) to stimulate APCs nonspecifically via TLRs but has added a new function: to act as a carrier for antigenic peptides and to promote receptor-mediated uptake by professional APCs (14Singh-Jasuja H. Toes R.E. Spee P. Munz C. Hilf N. Schoenberger S.P. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Neefjes J. Rammensee H.G. Arnold-Schild D. Schild H. J. Exp.

Immunol. 1999; 162: 3757-3760PubMed Google Scholar). The unique combination of both features now allows the major histocompatibility complex-restricted presentation of antigenic peptides to cells of the adaptive immune system in an immunostimulatory context and enables DCs to act as coordinators of innate and adaptive immune responses. Being able to understand these mechanisms will make it possible to interfere with the HSP-mediated activation of APCs and to rationally modulate immune responses toward either immunity or tolerance.

The HSPs that mediated this effect include the cytosolic HSP70 and HSP90 and the endoplasmic reticulum-resident chaperones calreticulin and Gp96 (8Udono H. Srivastava P.K. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 5398-5403PubMed Google Scholar, 9Basu S. Binder R.J. Ramalingam T. Srivastava P.K. Immunity. 2001; 14: 303-313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Gp96 molecules have been shown to induce cytotoxic T lymphocyte cross-priming against viral and minor histocompatibility antigens, supporting the hypothesis that Gp96 molecules are associated with a large repertoire of peptides not influenced by the cellular major histocompatibility complex expression (6Arnold D. Faath S. Rammensee H. Schild H. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 885-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 7Suto R. Srivastava P.K. Science. 1995; 269: 1585-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). HSP molecules can also provide an immunogenic context to synthetic peptides complexed to HSP70 or Gp96 molecules in vitro (10Blachere N.E., Li, Z. Chandawarkar R.Y. Suto R. Jaikaria N.S. Basu S.

Science. 1990; 249: 918-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Because of this, HSP molecules have been called adjuvants of mammalian origin (12Bevan M.J. J. Immunol. 1976; 117: 2233-2238PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, progress has been made in understanding the mechanisms that contribute to the efficient induction of immune responses against HSP-associated peptides. heat shock protein antigen-presenting cell bone marrow-derived dendritic cell monodansylcadaverine Toll-like receptor interleukin lipopolysaccharide dendritic cell nuclear factor κB mitogen-activated protein kinase extracellular signal-regulated kinase stress-activated protein kinase c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase fluorescein isothiocyanate heat shock protein antigen-presenting cell bone marrow-derived dendritic cell monodansylcadaverine Toll-like receptor interleukin lipopolysaccharide dendritic cell nuclear factor κB mitogen-activated protein kinase extracellular signal-regulated kinase stress-activated protein kinase c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase fluorescein isothiocyanate A receptor responsible for the uptake of HSP-peptide complexes has been identified as the α2-macroglobulin receptor CD91, expressed on professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs) (9Basu S. Binder R.J. Ramalingam T. Srivastava P.K. Immunity. 2001; 14: 303-313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar, 13Binder R.J. Han D.K. Srivastava P.K. Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). Only receptor-mediated endocytosis has been shown to result in the representation of HSP-associated peptides by MHC class I molecules, thus explaining the high efficiency of this process (14Singh-Jasuja H. Toes R.E. Spee P. Munz C. Hilf N. Schoenberger S.P. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Neefjes J. Rammensee H.G. Arnold-Schild D. Schild H. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 1965-1974Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). However, the ideal adjuvant should not only target the antigen to professional APCs, it should also induce APC activation to provide the proper costimuli required for efficient induction of the immune response. For HSPs, especially HSP70, HSP90, and Gp96, this ability has been demonstrated recently. The exposure of macrophages or DCs to HSPs resulted in up-regulation of major histocompatibility complex class II and costimulatory molecules and in tumor necrosis factor α and IL-12 secretion (15Asea A.

Srivastava P.K. Int. Immunol. 2000; 12: 1539-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar). The contribution of this mechanism in situations of physiological relevance is supported by the observation that necrotic but not apoptotic cell death leads to the release of HSPs (17Basu S. Binder R.J. Suto R. Anderson K.M. Srivastava P.K. Int. Immunol. 2000; 12: 1539-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar, 18Berwin B. Reed R.C. Nicchitta C.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21083-21088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), thus activating the innate arm of the immune system to attract cells equipped with antigen-specific receptors. The molecular basis for this process, however, has not been understood thus far. Studies investigating the stimulatory effect of HSP60 on epithelial cells and that of HSP60 and HSP70 on macrophages demonstrated the involvement of CD14 molecules, suggesting the participation of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) (19Chen W. Syldath U. Bellmann K. Burkart V. Kolb H. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 3212-3219PubMed Google Scholar). In Drosophila, Toll participates, in addition to the induction (coordination) of dorsal-ventral patterning during embryogenesis, in the defense against fungi by the induction of drosomycin secretion as an early form of innate immune response against infection (20Lemaitre B. Nicolas E. Michaut L. Reichhart J.M. Hoffmann J.A. Cell. 1996; 86: 973-983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2954) Google Scholar). In mammals, TLRs are involved in the response to pathogens by the recognition of so-called pathogen-associated molecular patterns. These include lipopolysaccharide (LPS), peptidoglycans, and lipoproteins and bacterial CpG DNA, which are recognized by TLR4, TLR2, and TLR9, respectively (21Aderem A. Ulevitch R.J. Nature. 2000; 406: 782-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2603) Google Scholar, 22Hemmi H. Takeuchi O. Kawai T. Kaisho T. Sato S. Sanjo H. Matsumoto M. Hoshino K. Wagner H. Takeda K. Akira S. Nature. 2000; 408: 740-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (5310) Google Scholar). The TLR signaling pathway shares most components with the IL-1 receptor signaling pathway responsible for activation of the innate immune system (21Aderem A. Ulevitch R.J. Nature. 2000; 406: 782-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2603) Google Scholar). Recently, HSPs have been linked to TLRs by the observation that HSP60 failed to activate TLR4-defective macrophages from C3H/HeJ mice (23Ohashi K. Burkart V. Flohe S. Kolb H. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 558-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (1356) Google Scholar). Subsequently, it was shown that genetic complementation of nonresponder cells with TLR4 or TLR2 restores responsiveness (gain of function) to HSP60, whereas TLR2−/− or TLR4-deficient cells exhibit a “loss of function.” Surprisingly, macrophage activation was equally well induced by bacterial and endogenous mammalian HSP60. Thus, the presence of molecular patterns that interact with members of the TLR family is not limited to pathogen-derived molecules. Because of this, HSP60 has been proposed to serve as a danger signal for the innate immune system (19Chen W. Syldath U. Bellmann K. Burkart V. Kolb H. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 3212-3219PubMed Google Scholar). HSP60 is not associated with antigenic peptides 2A. Schild and H. Schild, unpublished observation.2A. Schild and H. Schild, unpublished observation. and is found much earlier in phylogeny, as are the TLR and IL-1 receptor families. Therefore, it remains unclear whether the HSP/TLR pathway is used solely by the innate immune system to fight pathogens by unspecific mechanisms or whether HSPs with peptide binding ability, such as Gp96, also use this mechanism to link nonspecific immunostimulatory capacities with their specific, peptide-based features with the activation of the adaptive immune system. In this study, we decided to analyze the functional consequences of the interaction of Gp96 with members of the TLR family. DISCUSSIONWe identified the molecular mechanism of APC activation by the endoplasmic reticulum-resident chaperone Gp96. We find that TLR2 and TLR4 mediate NF-κB-driven luciferase induction (Fig. 1) and that mainly TLR4 and, to a small extent, TLR2 are responsible for the up-regulation of CD86 and the secretion of IL-12 and tumor necrosis factor α (Figs. 2 and 3). IL-10 was not detectable (<1.5 ng/ml; data not shown), which is in line with the previously reported secretion of only pro-inflammatory cytokines (14Singh-Jasuja H. Toes R.E. Spee P. Munz C. Hilf N. Schoenberger S.P. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Neefjes J. Rammensee H.G. Arnold-Schild D. Schild H. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 1965-1974Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 17Basu S. Binder R.J. Suto R. Anderson K.M. Srivastava P.K. Int. Immunol. 2000; 12: 1539-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar). TLR3, TLR7, and TLR8 molecules appear not to be involved in Gp96-mediated signaling (data not shown). Expression of CD86 and cytokine secretion are preceded by the NF-κB pathway and activation of the SAPKs JNK1/2 and p38 as well as the mitogen-activated protein kinase ERK1/2 (Fig. 4). DC activation is inhibited by MDC, which interferes with receptor-mediated endocytosis (Figs. Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7).Despite the fact that Gp96 and LPS are very different molecules, they both mediate DC activation via TLR4 and TLR2. The nature of the pathogen-associated molecular pattern of HSPs that allows their specific interaction with TLR2 and TLR4 is unknown. We are currently investigating the possibility that Gp96 and microbial components interfere with each other in binding to both TLRs. However, regardless of their shared interaction with TLR2 and TLR4 molecules, several differences in their mode of action are apparent. The most striking observation is that the Gp96-mediated DC activation strictly depends on the endocytosis of Gp96, whereas LPS-mediated DC activation does not require endocytosis and thus functions in the presence of the endocytosis inhibitor MDC. As a consequence, Gp96- but not LPS-mediated secretion of cytokines is impaired in the presence of MDC (Fig. 6). This, together with the observed sensitivity of Gp96-mediated DC activation to heat denaturation, also demonstrates that an endotoxin contamination in the Gp96 preparation does not account for the observed effects.This is further supported by the observation that cells expressing Gp96 molecules targeted to their surface induce efficient DC maturation upon cell-to-cell contact (35Zheng H. Dai J. Stoilova D. Li Z. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 6731-6735Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Internalization of TLR2 during the activation of macrophages has been observed previously (29Underhill D.M. Ozinsky A. Hajjar A.M. Stevens A. Wilson C.B. Bassetti M. Aderem A. Nature. 1999; 401: 811-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (1187) Google Scholar). In this series of experiments, TLR2 was found to accumulate in phagosomes of macrophages activated with the yeast cell wall particle zymosan. Whether or not endocytosis was a prerequisite for activation was not investigated. Our results obtained with Gp96 as an agonist for TLR2 and TLR4 suggest this to be the case.The importance of HSP endocytosis for macrophage activation has very recently been reported for the HSP60/TLR2/4-mediated activation of macrophages (30Vabulas R.M. Ahmad-Nejad P. da Costa C. Miethke T. Kirschning C.J. Haecker H. Wagner H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31332-31339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). Here we observe the same effect for the new TLR2 and TLR4 ligand, Gp96, and extent. Our finding parallels the need for Gp96 endocytosis during receptor-mediated uptake and representation of Gp96-associated peptides (14Singh-Jasuja H. Toes R.E. Spee P. Munz C. Hilf N. Schoenberger S.P. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Neefjes J. Rammensee H.G. Arnold-Schild D. Schild H. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 1965-1974Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 26Arnold-Schild D. Hanau D. Spehner D. Schmid C. Rammensee H.G. de la Salle H. Schild H. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 3757-3760PubMed Google Scholar) that is mediated through the interaction of Gp96 with CD91, the receptor for α2-macroglobulin (9Basu S. Binder R.J. Ramalingam T. Srivastava P.K. Immunity. 2001; 14: 303-313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar, 13Binder R.J. Han D.K. Srivastava P.K. Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). Interestingly, MDC had first been described as an inhibitor of endocytosis of the α2-macroglobulin receptor (28Davies P.J. Davies D.R. Levitzki A. Maxfield F.R. Milhaud P. Willingham M.C. Pastan I.H. Nature. 1980; 283: 162-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar).An interesting scenario can be postulated from the above findings: similar to the proposed requirement of LPS-mediated activation for CD14 and LPS-binding protein on the cell surface (reviewed in Ref. 31Golenbock D.T. Fenton M.J. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 286-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), Gp96-mediated DC activation might depend on the presence of CD91 molecules that endocytose bound Gp96 molecules and subsequently mediate their transport to endocytic vesicles, as described previously (26Arnold-Schild D. Hanau D. Spehner D. Schmid C. Rammensee H.G. de la Salle H. Schild H. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 3757-3760PubMed Google Scholar). This process will increase the local concentration of Gp96, now able to trigger signaling through TLR2 and TLR4 present in these vesicles (32Wagner H. Immunity. 2001; 14: 499-502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) by the recruitment of cytosolic MyD88 to the outer membrane of endocytic vesicles.The contribution of TLR2 to Gp96-mediated DC activation is not clear. Whereas transfection of TLR2 induces NF-κB-driven luciferase activity (Fig. 1), TLR2−/− mice show normal Gp96-mediated DC activation profiles (Figs. 2 and 3 b). On the other hand, Gp96-mediated DC activation in C3H/HeJ mice is always stronger than that in TLR2−/−/TLR4-deficient mice, which are not able to respond to a Gp96 stimulus at all. This observation suggests a minor contribution of TLR2. In TLR2−/− mice, the lack of TLR2 signaling can apparently be completely compensated by TLR4, but TLR2 can induce only minimal activation when TLR4 is not functional, as observed for BMDCs from C3H/HeJ mice. One explanation could be an imbalance in the expression of TLR2 and TLR4 on BMDCs, favoring effects mediated by TLR4.However, the interaction of both TLR molecules with Gp96 is strongly supported by the recent finding that the interaction of TLR2 and TLR4 with Gp96 inside the endoplasmic reticulum is crucial for the expression of these receptors on the cell surface (33Randow F. Seed B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 891-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar).Thus far, TLRs have been described as sensors for pathogen-associated molecular patterns crucial for the initiation of an innate immune response. These mechanisms were developed long before the adaptive immune system. One of the newest additions to the list of TLR ligands identified is HSP60. Interestingly, not only bacterial but also human HSP60 cross-reacts with TLRs (30Vabulas R.M. Ahmad-Nejad P. da Costa C. Miethke T. Kirschning C.J. Haecker H. Wagner H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31332-31339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). Our results now demonstrate that the exclusive association of TLRs with pathogen-associated molecular patterns is obsolete. Gp96 is not expressed in bacteria or fungi and provides the first example of a non-pathogen-derived ligand of TLRs. More importantly, our results show for the first time how the innate and adaptive immune system can be stimulated simultaneously by the same molecule that is released under physiological situations from necrotic cells (17Basu S. Binder R.J. Suto R. Anderson K.M. Srivastava P.K. Int. Immunol. 2000; 12: 1539-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar, 18Berwin B. Reed R.C. Nicchitta C.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21083-21088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The importance of these TLR-mediated stimuli for the induction of T helper type 1-dominated immune responses has been observed recently using MyD88−/− mice (34Schnare M. Barton G.M. Holt A.C. Takeda K. Akira S. Medzhitor R. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 947-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (1169) Google Scholar).Gp96 has kept the ability (probably HSP60-derived) to stimulate APCs nonspecifically via TLRs but has added a new function: to act as a carrier for antigenic peptides and to promote receptor-mediated uptake by professional APCs (14Singh-Jasuja H. Toes R.E. Spee P. Munz C. Hilf N. Schoenberger S.P. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Neefjes J. Rammensee H.G. Arnold-Schild D. Schild H. J. Exp.

Immunol. 1999; 162: 3757-3760PubMed Google Scholar). The unique combination of both features now allows the major histocompatibility complex-restricted presentation of antigenic peptides to cells of the adaptive immune system in an immunostimulatory context and enables DCs to act as coordinators of innate and adaptive immune responses. Being able to understand these mechanisms will make it possible to interfere with the HSP-mediated activation of APCs and to rationally modulate immune responses toward either immunity or tolerance. We identified the molecular mechanism of APC activation by the endoplasmic reticulum-resident chaperone Gp96. We find that TLR2 and TLR4 mediate NF-κB-driven luciferase induction (Fig. 1) and that mainly TLR4 and, to a small extent, TLR2 are responsible for the up-regulation of CD86 and the secretion of IL-12 and tumor necrosis factor α (Figs. 2 and 3).

The unique combination of both features now allows the major histocompatibility complex-restricted presentation of antigenic peptides to cells of the adaptive immune system in an immunostimulatory context and enables DCs to act as coordinators of innate and adaptive immune responses. Being able to understand these mechanisms will make it possible to interfere with the HSP-mediated activation of APCs and to rationally modulate immune responses toward either immunity or tolerance.

https://openalex.org/W2014666871,"Population density in plants and animals is thought to scale with size as a result of mass-related energy requirements. Variation in resources, however, naturally limits population density and may alter expected scaling patterns. We develop and test a general model for variation within and between species in population density across the order Carnivora. We find that 10,000 kilograms of prey supports about 90 kilograms of a given species of carnivore, irrespective of body mass, and that the ratio of carnivore number to prey biomass scales to the reciprocal of carnivore mass. Using mass-specific equations of prey productivity, we show that carnivore number per unit prey productivity scales to carnivore mass near -0.75, and that the scaling rule can predict population density across more than three orders of magnitude. The relationship provides a basis for identifying declining carnivore species that require conservation measures."

In vivo and recent in vitro experiments demonstrate that the misfolded pathological isoform of PrP1(prion protein), designated PrPSc, directs the conversion of PrPC, the normal cellular isoform, into PrPSc (1Prusiner S.B. Science. 1997; 278: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar). This conversion requires a substantial conformational change: PrPC is a proteinase K (PK)-sensitive, α-helical monomer, whereas PrPSc is a PK-resistant, aggregated β-sheet-rich multimer (2Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 793-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). Upon PK digestion, PrPSc loses residues 23 to ∼89, and the PK-resistant core, PrP 27–30 (residues ∼90–231), forms amyloid fibrils (3Prusiner S.B. McKinley M.P. Bowman K.A. Bolton D.C. Bendheim P.E. Groth D.F. Glenner G.G. Cell. 1983; 35: 349-358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). PrP 27–30 remains fully infectious and retains high β-sheet content (4Pan K.-M. Baldwin M.

A. 1993; 90: 10962-10966Crossref PubMed Scopus (2084) Google Scholar). The infectivity of PrPSc and PrP 27–30 presumably owes to the ability of the protein to traffic to the brain and templates the conversion of PrPC to PrPSc. Different strains of prions have unique neurohistological and biochemical features as well as distinct clinical patterns (5Bessen R.A. Marsh R.F. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 2096-21011Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Hecker R. Taraboulos A. Scott M. Pan K.-M. Torchia M. Jendroska K. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B.

Clinicopathological features include the specific incubation time, the neuroanatomic distribution, and the degree of PK resistance (7Scott M.R. Groth D. Tatzelt J. Torchia M. Tremblay P.

These features, which are stable following serial transmission in a given animal, have been attributed to conformationally distinct multimeric arrangements of PrPSc. During the past several years, a considerable body of evidence has accumulated arguing that the properties of prion strains are enciphered in their conformations (8Bessen R.A. Marsh R.F. J.

Although it seems clear that prion strains are comprised of different conformers of PrPSc, glycosylation patterns and specific polymorphisms may add to strain diversity (13Somerville R.A. J. Gen. Virol. 1999; 80: 1865-1872Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Here we examine the ability of unglycosylated recombinant (rec) PrP with an intact disulfide bond and without a GPI anchor to form different non-native β-sheet-rich isoforms in vitro. Recent studies by J. Y. Chang and co-workers (14Lu B.Y. Beck P.J. Chang J.Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 3767-3773Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 15Lu B.Y. Chang J.Y. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13390-13396Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the reduced form of recPrP 23–231 exists in four β-sheet-rich isoforms as judged by their distinct retention times in reverse-phase chromatography. However, other differences in the physicochemical properties of these isoforms have not been characterized. Because PrPSc and PrPC both maintain a disulfide bridge (16Turk E. Teplow D.B. Hood L.E. Prusiner S.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 176: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), we believe that it is important to focus on the ability of a nonreduced form of recPrP to adopt non-native conformations. Several recent studies have reported that nonreduced recPrP forms oligomeric β-sheet-rich isoforms (17Swietnicki W. Morillas M. Chen S.G. Gambetti P. Surewicz W.K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 424-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 18Baskakov I.V. Legname G. Prusiner S.B. Cohen F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19687-19690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 19Morillas M. Vanik D.L. Surewicz W.K. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6982-6987Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, a consistent picture of the differences between these distinct abnormal isoforms has yet to emerge. By studying mouse and Syrian hamster PrP (designated Mo recPrP 89–231 and SHa recPrP 90–231, respectively), we demonstrated that the protein can adopt the α-helical native isoform, two non-native β-sheet-rich isoforms, a β-oligomer, and an amyloid fibril. These two abnormal isoforms may coexist under certain experimental conditions; however, the β-oligomer is not on the kinetic pathway to amyloid formation and is not a substructure in the assembling fibril. Instead, we have identified two novel multimeric transient intermediates in amyloid formation. The preferences for forming either a β-oligomer or amyloid can be dictated by experimental conditions, with acidic pH similar to that observed in endocytic vesicles favoring the β-oligomer and neutral pH favoring amyloid. Although both abnormal isoforms have high β-sheet content and bind 1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonate (ANS), they are dissimilar structurally. In the amyloid form, residues 90–120 are buried in a manner reminiscent of PrP 27–30, whereas in the β-oligomer, this region is available for antibody binding. After PK digestion, the amyloid form is digested into a number of small fragments, whereas residues 122–221 of the β-oligomer remain intact. Analysis of the oligomerization state using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) indicates that the β-oligomer is predominantly octameric. Our data demonstrate that PrP is capable of forming several abnormal isoforms and that the preference to fold into a particular abnormal isoform is influenced substantially by experimental conditions. The expression and purification of Mo recPrP 89–231 and SHa recPrP 90–231 were performed as described previously (20Mehlhorn I. Groth D. Stöckel J. Moffat B. Reilly D. Yansura D. Willett W.S. Baldwin M. Fletterick R. Cohen F.E. Vandlen R. Henner D. Prusiner S.B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5528-5537Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The purified protein was seen to be a single pure species with an intact disulfide bond as confirmed by SDS-PAGE and electrospray mass spectrometry (Applied Biosystems Mariner; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). recPrP folds into its native α-helical conformation upon dilution from 10 m urea (20 mm sodium acetate, pH 3.7) to 1 m urea (20 mm sodium acetate, 0.2m NaCl, pH 5.5). To refold the protein into the β-oligomeric isoform, recPrP was diluted from 10 to 5 murea (20 mm sodium acetate, 0.2 NaCl, pH 3.7) and incubated overnight at room temperature in 5 m urea (18Baskakov I.V. Legname G. Prusiner S.B. Cohen F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19687-19690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The process of assembling to the β-oligomer was monitored by CD and size exclusion chromatography (SEC). Once recPrP was refolded into the β-oligomer, it remained stable after dilution from 5 to 1m urea in 20 mm sodium acetate, 0.2m NaCl, pH 5.5. The binding of Congo red (Sigma) was monitored using absorption spectroscopy. A fresh solution of Congo red was prepared by dissolving the dye in 5 mm potassium phosphate and 150 mm NaCl, filtering it five times with a 0.22-mm filter (Millipore, Bedford, MA), and adjusting the concentration to 0.3 mm. The difference spectra were obtained by subtracting the Congo red spectra obtained in the absence of protein from the Congo red spectra measured in the presence of protein. These measurements were corrected for light scattering as described by Klunk et al. (21Klunk W.E. Jacob R.F. Mason R.P. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 309: 285-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Thioflavin T (ThT; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) fluorescence was monitored using a LS50B fluorimeter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at 482 nm (excitation at 450 nm; excitation slit was 5 nm; emission slit was 10 nm; 0.4-cm rectangular cuvettes) as described (22LeVine H. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 404-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (1962) Google Scholar). The fluorescence of ANS (Sigma) was monitored at 475 nm (excitation at 385 nm; excitation slit was 5 nm; emission slit was 10 nm; 0.4-cm rectangular cuvettes) as described (23Safar J. Roller P.P. Gajdusek D.C. Gibbs C.J., Jr. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8375-8383Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In the time course of amyloid formation, aliquots of recPrP were diluted 20 times by phosphate buffered saline, pH 7.0, and incubated with either 5 μm ThT or 110 μm ANS for 15 min at room temperature before monitoring fluorescence. Negative staining was performed on carbon-coated, 600-mesh copper grids that were glow-discharged prior to staining. The samples were adsorbed for 30 s, stained with freshly filtered 2% ammonium molybdate or 2% uranyl acetate, dried, and then viewed in a JEOL 100CX II electron microscope (Tokyo, Japan) at 80 kV at standard magnifications of 40,000 and 80,000 as described previously (24Wille H. Zhang G.-F. Baldwin M.A. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 608-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The pattern of epitope presentation of the amyloid isoform of SHa recPrP 90–231 was assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as described by Peretz et al. (25Peretz D. Williamson R.A. Matsunaga Y. Serban H. Pinilla C. Bastidas R.B. Rozenshteyn R. James T.L. Houghten R.A. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Burton D.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 614-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). CD spectra were recorded with a J-720 CD spectrometer (Jasco, Easton, MD) scanning at 20 nm/min, with a band width of 1 nm and data spacing of 0.5 nm using a 0.1-cm cuvette as described previously (18Baskakov I.V.

Three individual scans were averaged, and the background spectra were subtracted. All of the separations were performed at 23 °C with a flow rate of 1 ml/min using a TSK-3000 HPLC gel filtration column (300 mm × 7.80 mm) equilibrated in a running buffer (pH 3.7) of 20 mm sodium acetate, 0.2m NaCl, and 1 m urea. During the time course of amyloid formation, the aliquots of recPrP were diluted twice using the running buffer and immediately analyzed by SEC. All of the measurements were carried out using a DynaPro-801 TC Dynamic Light Scattering Instrument (Protein Solution Inc., Lakewood, NJ). The samples (30 ml) were filtered through 100-nm membrane filters (Whatman Inc., Ann Arbor, MI), placed in the quartz cuvette of DynaPro-MSTC, and measured at a constant temperature of 23 °C (26Baskakov I.V.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2792-2804Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). recPrP was incubated with PK at a 40:1 ratio at 37 °C in 20 mm sodium acetate, 0.2m NaCl, pH 5.5. The digestion was stopped by adding phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride to a 1 mm final concentration and Pefabloc (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) to a 3 mm final concentration. The samples were analyzed by 16% Tris SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot or by HPLC-MS (26Baskakov I.V. Aagaard C. Mehlhorn I. Wille H. Groth D. Baldwin M.A. Prusiner S.B. Cohen F.E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2792-2804Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The PK digestion products were separated by reverse-phase HPLC-MS as described previously (26Baskakov I.V. Aagaard C. Mehlhorn I. Wille H. Groth D. Baldwin M.A. Prusiner S.B. Cohen F.E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2792-2804Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). HPLC was carried out with an Applied Biosystems 140B syringe pump solvent delivery system using a 1 × 150-mm C-18 Vydac column with a 300-Å pore size and a 5-μm particle size, connected to a 759A UV detector with a 35-nl capillary flow cell. Solvent A was 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and solvent B was acetonitrile with 0.08% trifluoroacetic acid, with a linear gradient of 5–95% over 30 min at a flow rate of 50 ml/min. The eluate was split such that ∼10% was introduced into the electrospray ionization source of the orthogonal accelerated time of flight mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems). The mass spectra were recorded continuously at 5-s intervals over the range of 600–2000m/z. UV chromatograms recorded at 215 nm were compared with total ion current traces obtained from the mass spectrometer. Either ESI-MS spectra corresponding to peaks in the UV and total ion current traces were selected for averaging and deconvoluted using the software provided with the mass spectrometer, or spectra containing signals from multiple unresolved peptides were deconvoluted manually by visual inspection and by selection of related multiply charged ions. Deconvolution converted each multiply charged ion series into a single peak of zero charge, giving the relative molecular masses of the peptides. The experimentally determined values were compared with calculations for all possible fragments of the Mo recPrP 89–231 sequence. The calculated values were based on monoisotopic atomic masses for the smaller peptides (<3000 Da) and on average masses for the larger peptides, for which the isotopic components could not be resolved. For supramolecular ESI-MS, salt was removed from the protein samples by dialysis, and organic solvent (20% methanol or other solvent) was added to the buffer to enhance vaporization. The solutions were sprayed into the mass spectrometer, giving multiply charged ions of the oligomers in the gas phase with the pattern of peaks shown in Fig.5a. This pattern was deconvoluted to give the oligomeric species shown in Fig. 5b. In a previous study, we showed that recPrP can be folded either to its native, monomeric α-helical isoform or to a β-sheet-rich, oligomeric form (18Baskakov I.V. Legname G. Prusiner S.B. Cohen F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19687-19690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). There is an equilibrium between the α-helical and the β-sheet-rich isoforms, where partially denaturing conditions (acidic pH and urea) and increased concentrations of PrP favor conversion to the β-oligomer. The conformational transition from the α-helical to the β-sheet-rich isoform is separated by a large energy barrier that is associated with unfolding and with a higher order kinetic process related to the oligomerization. Because of the height of the energy barrier, the conformational transition from the α-isoform to the β-isoform occurs very slowly, and PrP is kinetically trapped in its native α-helical conformation. Based on our preliminary data, we suggested that the β-oligomer could be a thermodynamically stable, on-pathway intermediate in amyloid formation. To explore further the pathway of amyloid formation, we studied the behavior of the β-oligomer in greater detail. We incubated the β-oligomer at 37 °C under constant shaking, which led to the formation of amyloid fibrils as measured by ThT binding (Fig.1). The kinetics of fibrillogenesis exhibit a lag phase followed by an exponential increase in fibril formation. The length of the lag phase was a function of pH, ranging from 10 h at pH 6.1 or pH 7.2 to 3 days at pH 3.7 (Fig.1a). Additionally, the lag phase could be prolonged by increasing concentrations of urea (Fig. 1b). We found that after the kinetic trace reached a plateau, additional incubation of samples at 37 °C resulted in a decrease in the ThT binding. Under these conditions or following dialysis out of urea, fibrils tended to aggregate into large insoluble particles as seen by electron microscopy (Fig. 1c). Both Mo recPrP 89–231 and SHa recPrP 90–231 formed amyloid fibrils under similar conditions, but each had a distinct morphology. Fibrils of Mo recPrP were formed by twisted protofibrils with a diameter of ∼20 nm (Fig. 1d), whereas those of SHa recPrP had a diameter of 10–15 nm (Fig. 1c). The addition of a 0.5% seed of prefolded amyloid to the fresh reaction substantially reduced the lag phase of the process, demonstrating that the process can be induced by seeding (data not shown). Spectroscopic measurements were used to distinguish the β-oligomer from the fibrillar form. In contrast to the β-oligomer, the fibrils bind Congo red and ThT (Fig. 2), a common feature of amyloid structures. The binding of Congo red was detected as a typical red shift in its absorbance spectra (Fig. 2a) and as birefringence under polarized light (data not shown). Congo red binding was saturated at a 5:1 ratio of dye molecule to polypeptide chain. Specific binding of ThT resulted in substantial increases of fluorescence with a maximum at 482 nm (Fig. 2b). ANS has been used to study the partially folded states of globular proteins as well as the binding pockets of a number of carrier proteins and enzymes. ANS has also been used to characterize fibrillar forms of amyloidogenic proteins and infectious isoforms of PrP (27Litvinovich S.V. Brew S.A. Aota S. Akiyama S.K. Haudenschild C. Ingham K.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 245-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 28Kayed R. Bernhagen J. Greenfield N. Sweimeh K. Brunner H. Voelter W. Kapurniotu A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 781-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). According to Safar et al. (23Safar J. Roller P.P. Gajdusek D.C. Gibbs C.J., Jr. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8375-8383Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), ANS binds to PrP 27–30, as detected by increased ANS fluorescence and a blue shift of its fluorescence maxima from 540 to 490 nm. Similarly, ANS binding to fibrils of Mo recPrP 89–231 was accompanied by a substantial increase in the fluorescence yield and a blue shift of its fluorescence spectrum (Fig. 2c). However, similar changes in the fluorescence spectra were observed when ANS was added to a solution of the β-oligomer. The α-helix-rich monomeric structure did not show any evidence of ANS binding (Fig. 2c). Hence, ANS binds to both β-sheet-rich forms, amyloid fibrils, and the β-oligomer but not to the α-helical isoform. The process of amyloid formation of recPrP can be used as a model to study the self-propagating conformational transition of PrP. However, in vitro formation of the β-oligomer and amyloid has not produced infectious prions thus far. Because these refolded molecules are not equivalent to the infectious form, we sought to characterize the structural similarities of these isoforms with PrPSc. One of the properties that distinguishes PrPSc from PrPC is the loss of antigenicity of residues 90–120. Accessibility of this epitope can be determined from a difference in the reactivities of specific antibodies to the nondenatured and denatured forms of PrP (25Peretz D. Williamson R.A. Matsunaga Y. Serban H. Pinilla C. Bastidas R.B. Rozenshteyn R. James T.L. Houghten R.A. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Burton D.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 614-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). To determine whether residues 90–120 are exposed or buried in the amyloid form of recPrP, we probed the binding of two antibody fragments (Fabs), D13 and 3F4, which are specific to epitopes 96–106 and 108–112, respectively. Binding of both Fabs to the nondenatured amyloid was relatively weak, whereas their reactivities were substantially greater after denaturation of the amyloid (Fig. 3). The increased reactivities of these Fabs reflect the greater exposure of epitope 96–112 to the solvent upon denaturation. In contrast to the epitope 96–112 of the N-terminal region, the C-terminal epitope 225–231 is exposed in the PrPSc isoform (25Peretz D. Williamson R.A. Matsunaga Y. Serban H. Pinilla C. Bastidas R.B. Rozenshteyn R. James T.L. Houghten R.A. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Burton D.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 614-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). The accessibility of this region in the amyloid form of recPrP was assayed using R1 and R2 Fabs, both of which bind to residues in the epitope 225–231. The reactivities of these Fabs were very similar regardless of whether or not the amyloid fibrils were denatured. A similar epitope presentation in the amyloid of SHa recPrP 90–231 and PrP 27–30 indicates that both forms have some common features. To understand the basic principles involved in the conformational transition and oligomerization of PrP, we studied the kinetic pathway of amyloidogenesis in vitro. One question we wanted to address is whether the β-oligomer is on the pathway to amyloid formation. To dissect the in vitro folding pathway, the kinetics of amyloid formation were monitored in parallel by three biophysical techniques: SEC, ThT binding, and ANS binding. Employing SEC, we found four isoforms of Mo recPrP 89–231 with distinct oligomerization states (Fig.4a). The isoform with an elution volume of 10.2 ml corresponded to the monomer, had an α-helical conformation as measured by CD, and was characterized by the absence of ThT and ANS binding. The isoform eluted at 7.2 ml corresponded to the β-oligomer and did not bind ThT but bound ANS. There were two distinct multimeric forms of recPrP with very similar elution volumes of 5.45 ml (multimer I) and 5.22 ml (multimer II) (Table I). Because of their similar elution volumes, both multimers appeared as one asymmetrical peak in most SEC experiments (Fig. 4b). However, these two multimeric isoforms could be distinguished following a 15-h incubation. Under these conditions, the multimer I and II peaks were equally populated (Fig. 4b). Both multimeric isoforms were enriched in β-sheet content and bound ANS. However, only multimer II bound ThT (data not shown).

Because of the very similar elution volumes for the peaks of multimers I and II, a single kinetic trace represents the sum of both isoforms. A decrease in the α-monomer population was accompanied by an immediate and simultaneous growth of both the β-oligomer and the combined population of the multimers (Fig. 4c). Because there was no time delay between the kinetic traces of the formation of the multimer and β-oligomer, it was difficult to judge whether the β-oligomer was an on- or off-pathway intermediate to amyloid fibril formation. To investigate this further, we monitored the kinetics of amyloidogenesis starting from the β-oligomer of Mo recPrP 89–231 (Fig. 4d). A decrease in the β-oligomer population coincided with a growth in the α-monomer population, whereas the kinetics of accumulation of the multimer showed a lag phase (Fig.4d). The multimer fraction started to increase only after the α-monomer concentration reached a certain level. As soon as the multimer appeared, its population grew rapidly. This coincided with a rapid decrease in the population of the α-monomer (Fig.4d). It seems that the conversion of the β-oligomer into the α-monomer was slower than the consumption of the α-monomer during amyloidogenesis. Thus, the population of the α-monomer was exhausted after 20 h, and then temporarily increased again because of a slow dissociation of the β-oligomer. These data indicate that the β-oligomer may be off the pathway to amyloid formation and that the refolding and dissociation of the β-oligomer back into the α-monomer most likely precede fibril formation. Comparison of the kinetic traces monitored by SEC and ThT binding provides important insight into the mechanism of amyloidogenesis. The kinetics of ThT binding was delayed relative to multimer formation (Fig. 4c). The initial growth of ThT fluorescence corresponded to the time point when multimer II appeared (Fig.4c, bottom panel). This agrees with our previous result that the conversion from multimer I to multimer II is critical with respect to ThT binding (Table I). ThT binding continued to increase even after the trace for the combined population of multimers reached a plateau. Consequently, at this stage of the amyloidogenic process, the growth of ThT fluorescence cannot be explained solely by the increased multimer II population. Instead, we observed that increased ThT signals coincided with a gradual shift of the elution volume of multimer II from 5.25 to 5.0 ml (Fig. 4c). Because the SEC column has nonlinear properties in the range of 5.0–6.0 ml, even a modest change in the elution volume of multimer II corresponded to a substantial increase in its molecular mass. Hence, the kinetic trace of ThT fluorescence may represent two processes, (i) an increase in the population of multimer II and (ii) a growth in the size of multimeric species. Furthermore, the shift in the elution volume of the multimer II peak was followed by a decrease in the peak area (Fig. 4c, middle panel). It is likely that the disappearance of this peak was caused by an inability of the species to penetrate the SEC column as a result of the substantial size of multimer II. In addition, both kinetic experiments showed that the species identified by ANS binding coincided with that representing the total population of all isoforms excluding the α-monomer. This suggests that ANS binds nonselectively to all β-sheet-rich isoforms. The level of ANS fluorescence remained stable during the last stage of the fibrillogenic process, whereas the area of the multimer peak eluted from SEC decreased. This result also indicates that the last stage of amyloidogenesis monitored by SEC represents an elongation of multimer II, which affects its ability to penetrate the column. Overall, our kinetic experiments indicate that the β-oligomer is not on a direct path to amyloid formation. Furtherm"

These effects were particularly marked in Beringia (northeastern Siberia, northwestern North America, and the exposed Bering Strait) during the late Pleistocene. To investigate the evolutionary impact of these events, we studied genetic change in the brown bear, Ursus arctos, in eastern Beringia over the past 60,000 years using DNA preserved in permafrost remains. A marked degree of genetic structure is observed in populations throughout this period despite local extinctions, reinvasions, and potential interspecies competition with the short-faced bear, Arctodus simus. The major phylogeographic changes occurred 35 to 21 ka B.P., before the glacial maximum, and little change is observed after this time. Late Pleistocene histories of mammalian taxa may be more complex than those that might be inferred from the fossil record or contemporary DNA sequences alone."

However, bacterially produced full-length adiponectin is functionally inactive. Here, we show that endogenous adiponectin secreted by adipocytes is post-translationally modified into eight different isoforms, as shown by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Carbohydrate detection revealed that six of the adiponectin isoforms are glycosylated. The glycosylation sites were mapped to several lysines (residues 68, 71, 80, and 104) located in the collagenous domain of adiponectin, each having the surrounding motif of G XKGE(D). These four lysines were found to be hydroxylated and subsequently glycosylated. The glycosides attached to each of these four hydroxylated lysines are possibly glucosylgalactosyl groups. Functional analysis revealed that full-length adiponectin produced by mammalian cells is much more potent than bacterially generated adiponectin in enhancing the ability of subphysiological concentrations of insulin to inhibit gluconeogenesis in primary rat hepatocytes, whereas this insulin-sensitizing ability was significantly attenuated when the four glycosylated lysines were substituted with arginines.

In addition to serving as an energy storage depot for triglycerides, adipose tissue is now recognized as an active endocrine organ that can secret a variety of biologically active molecules (adipocytokines) in response to extracellular signals (1Bradley R.L.

Some of these adipocytokines, such as leptin, tumor necrosis factor-α, and resistin, have been shown to play critical roles in the regulation of systemic energy homeostasis, and altered expression and/or secretion of these adipocytokines may contribute to the causation of insulin resistance, type II diabetes, and its complications such as cardiovascular diseases. Adiponectin (also called ACRP30, adipoQ, and GBP28) is a protein exclusively secreted by adipocytes and was originally cloned by four research groups using different approaches (5Scherer P.E.

The adiponectin gene is located in chromosome 3q27, a susceptibility locus for type II diabetes and related metabolic syndromes (12Saito K. Tobe T. Minoshima S. Asakawa S. Sumiya J. Yoda M. Nakano Y.

Notably, treatment with the insulin-sensitizing peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ agonist thiazolidinedione in several insulin-resistant animal models and human patients significantly increases the plasma concentration of adiponectin (21Combatsiaris T.P.

Thus, adiponectin correlates well with the insulin-sensitive state, and its absence is associated with insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and hyperglycemia. Evidence is accumulating that adiponectin or its synthetic analogs might be useful in the treatment of type II diabetes and other metabolic syndromes associated with insulin resistance. Lodish and co-workers (10Fruebis J. Tsao T.S. Javorschi S. Ebbets-Reed D. Erickson M.R. Yen F.T. Bihain B.E. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2005-2010Crossref PubMed Scopus (1757) Google Scholar) have recently reported that acute in vivo administration of truncated adiponectin decreases postprandial plasma free fatty acid following a high fat meal and that chronic administration of this protein causes sustained weight loss in mice without affecting food intake. Scherer and co-workers (9Berg A.H. Combs T.P., Du, X. Brownlee M. Scherer P.E. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 947-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (2210) Google Scholar) demonstrated that injection of recombinant adiponectin acutely abolishes hyperglycemia in several diabetic animal models, including ob/ob, non-obese diabetic, and streptozotocin-treated mice. Furthermore, Kadowaki and co-workers (11Yamauchi T. Kamon J. Waki H. Terauchi Y. Kubota N. Hara K. Mori Y. Ide T. Murakami K. Tsuboyama-Kasaoka N. Ezaki O. Akanuma Y. Gavrilova O. Vinson C.

Med. 2001; 7: 941-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (4074) Google Scholar) showed that replenishment of adiponectin can restore insulin resistance in both high fat-fed and lipoatropic mice, perhaps by increasing β-oxidation of fatty acid in muscle and thus decreasing muscular triglyceride content. Mouse adiponectin is composed of 247 amino acid residues with an N-terminal collagenous domain and a C-terminal globular domain (7Hu E. Liang P. Spiegelman B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10697-10703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1890) Google Scholar). The N-terminal collagenous domain is required for the high order multimerization of this protein (5Scherer P.E. Williams S. Fogliano M. Baldini G. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26746-26749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2744) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of the C-terminal globular region is strikingly similar to that of tumor necrosis factor-α, even though there is no homology at the primary sequence level (23Shapiro L. Scherer P.E. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 335-338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms underlying the metabolic functions of adiponectin are largely unknown. Bacterially produced full-length recombinant adiponectin is inactive in restoring insulin sensitivity as well as in decreasing hyperglycemia (9Berg A.H. Combs T.P., Du, X. Brownlee M. Scherer P.E. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 947-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (2210) Google Scholar, 11Yamauchi T. Kamon J. Waki H. Terauchi Y. Kubota N. Hara K. Mori Y. Ide T. Murakami K. Tsuboyama-Kasaoka N. Ezaki O.

Med. 2001; 7: 941-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (4074) Google Scholar), indicating that post-translational modification might be critical for the insulin-sensitizing actions of adiponectin. Here, we have shown that adiponectin secreted by adipocytes exists in multiple glycosylated isoforms. We also mapped the glycosylation sites to several conserved lysines (residues 68, 71, 80, and 104) that are located in the collagenous domain of adiponectin, with surrounding consensus sequences of G XKGE(D). These lysine residues are hydroxylated and subsequently glycosylated. Furthermore, the important role of this hydroxylysyl glycosylation was confirmed by mutational analysis, which showed that substitution of these lysine residues with arginine significantly attenuated the ability of adiponectin to enhance insulin's inhibitory actions on hepatic glucose production. Dexamethasone, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid, collagenase, rat tail collagen type I, amino acid standards, FLAG peptide, anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel, and the glucose Trinder assay kit were purchased from Sigma. Human insulin (Actrapid) was obtained from Novo Nordisk. The total cellular RNA extraction reagent (Trizol), tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease, mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1(+), and prokaryotic expression vector pPROEX-HTb were from Invitrogen.

For differentiation, post-confluent cells were induced by incubation with 0.25 μm dexamethasone, 0.5 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, and 10 μg/ml insulin for 2 days. This was followed by incubation with 10 μg/ml insulin for 2 days. The cells were then maintained in DMEM with 10% fetal calf serum for another 4 days. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry To harvest proteins secreted by adipocytes, the cells at day 8 following differentiation were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and then incubated with serum-free medium for another 4 h. The medium was collected, centrifuged at 3000 ×g for 10 min, filtered through a 0.20-μm filter, and then concentrated and desalted using a concentrator with a molecular mass cutoff of 5000 Da (Vivascience Ltd.). The proteins were quantitated using BCA reagent and stored at −80 °C until used. The proteins secreted by either adipocytes or 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis as described previously (24Wang Y., Xu, A., Ye, J. Kraegen E.W. Tse C.A. Cooper G.J. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 1821-1827Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The separated proteins were stained with either silver or Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. For immunoblotting, proteins separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes using a Multiphor II Novablot electrophoretic transfer unit (AmershamBiosciences). The membranes were blocked and then incubated with rabbit anti-adiponectin polyclonal antibody (1:1000) overnight at 4 °C. After incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature, the bound antibodies were detected using the ECL detection kit. Glycoproteins were detected using the commercial Immu-Blot kit according to the manufacturer's instruction. Protein spots of interest separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis were excised and subjected to in-gel trypsin digestion as described previously (25Wang Y., Xu, A. Pearson R.B. Cooper G.J. FEBS Lett. 1999; 462: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The extracted tryptic peptide mixtures were fractionated by RP-HPLC on a Jupiter 5μ C18 column (250 × 2.00 mm; Phenomenex Inc.). The prewarmed column (37 °C) was washed for 7 min with 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid, followed by elution using a 50-min linear gradient of 8–36% acetonitrile at a flow rate of 200 μl/min. Each fraction was collected manually and subjected to further analysis as described below. 3H-Labeled glycopeptides were detected by liquid scintillation counting. Protein spots separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250, excised, and subjected to amino acid sequencing by Edman degradation using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Procise Model 492 protein sequencer. Internal amino acid sequences were obtained by sequencing the tryptic peptides following RP-HPLC fractionation. For amino acid analysis, 5 μg of the tryptic peptides was vacuum-dried and hydrolyzed in the gas phase with 6 m HCl and 1% phenol for 24 h at 110 °C. This treatment destroyed sugar residues, but still permitted detection and quantitation of hydroxylysine and hydroxyproline (26Johnson, R. G., Stollery, J., Keeley, F. W., and Herbert, M. A. (1980) Clin. Orthop. Relat. Res.282–288Google Scholar). Free amino acid residues were dissolved in 40 μl of 0.025% K3EDTA, derivatized with phenyl isothiocyanate, separated on a Spheri-5 PTC 5μ column (220 × 2.1 mm), and analyzed with an Applied Biosystems Model 421 amino acid analyzer. 0.5 μl of the tryptic peptide mixtures or RP-HPLC-separated peptides was mixed with an equal amount of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid matrix (10 mg/ml in 60% acetonitrile and 0.3% trifluoroacetic acid), spotted onto the sample plates, and air-dried. Reflectron mass spectrometric analyses were performed on a Voyager DE PRO biospectrometry workstation (Applied Biosystems) using a pulsed laser beam (nitrogen laser, λ = 337 nm). All ion spectra were recorded in the positive mode with an accelerating voltage of 20.0 kV. The spectrometer was externally calibrated using Cal Mix 2 standard mixture. Total RNA was obtained from 3T3-L1 adipocytes using Trizol reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. Reverse transcription-PCR was performed based on the mouse adiponectin nucleotide sequence (GenBankTM/EBI accession number U37222). Full-length adiponectin cDNA was then inserted into the pGEMT-easy vector, and its sequence was verified by DNA sequencing. The protein sequence was counted starting from the methionine residue. For prokaryotic expression, the mouse adiponectin cDNA sequence was amplified using 5′-ATCGGGATCCGAAGATGACGTTACTACAACT-3′ as the sense primer and 5′-TACGAATTCTCAGTTGGTATCATGGTAGAG-3′ as the antisense primer. The BamHI/SalI fragment of the amplified DNA product was subcloned into the pPROEX-HTb plasmid, resulting in expression vector pPRO-His-Ad, which encodes full-length adiponectin with a His6 tag at its N terminus. A similar strategy was used for the construction of prokaryotic expression vector pPRO-His-gAd, which expresses the His6-tagged globular region of adiponectin (amino acid residues 110–247), except that the sense primer used was 5′-ATCGGGATCCGCCGCTTATATGTATCGCTC-3′. The expression of His-tagged full-length adiponectin or its globular region in BL21 cells was induced by the addition of 1 mm of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to the growth medium. Full-length adiponectin or its globular region was purified from the bacterial lysates using the Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column according to the manufacturer's instructions. Following purification, the N-terminal tag was removed by cleavage with recombinant TEV protease. The purity of the protein was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and HPLC. The vector for mammalian expression was generated by amplification of adiponectin cDNA using 5′-GCCCGCGGATCCATGCTACTGTTGCAAGCTCT-3′ as the sense primer and 5′-GGCCGCGAATTCTCACTTGTCATCGTCGTCCTTGTAGTCGTTGGTATCATGGTAGAG-3′ as the antisense primer. Following digestion with BamHI/EcoRI, the fragment was inserted into pcDNA3.1(+) to produce expression vector pcDNA-Ad-F, which encodes full-length adiponectin with a FLAG epitope tag at its C terminus. This expression vector was then used as a template to construct the vectors encoding adiponectin variants in which the four lysines (residues 68, 71, 80, and 104) were replaced with arginines using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit. The mutagenic oligonucleotide primers were designed according to the criteria recommended by the manufacturer, with a codon change from AAG to CGG (for residues 68 and 80) or from AAA to CGA (for residues 71 and 104). A plasmid (pcDNA-Ad(K→R)-F) encoding a FLAG-tagged adiponectin variant with all four lysine residues substituted with arginines was obtained by sequential mutation of each site, and all mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. These mammalian expression vectors were transfected into COS-7 cells using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent, and the cells were allowed to secrete adiponectin into serum-free medium for 48 h. The medium was then harvested and precipitated by incubation with 40% ammonium sulfate overnight at 4 °C. After subsequent centrifugation at 8000 × g for 1 h, the pellets were resuspended in Tris-buffered saline and dialyzed against the same buffer using SnakeSkin tubing with a molecular mass cutoff of 7000 Da (Pierce). FLAG-tagged adiponectin was purified using anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel and eluted with 150 μg/ml FLAG peptide. His-tagged recombinant adiponectin produced by Escherichia coli was mixed with Freund's complete adjuvant and then intraperitoneally injected into female Wistar rats (50 μg/rat) or subcutaneously injected into female New Zealand rabbits (100 μg/rabbit). The animals were boosted twice with the same amount of protein mixed with Freund's incomplete adjuvant, and blood was collected 1 week after the last boost. Primary hepatocytes were prepared from male Wistar rats (200 g) as described previously (27Leffert H.L. Koch K.S. Moran T. Williams M. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 58: 536-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) and plated on collagen type I-coated 12-well plates in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 10 μmdexamethasone, and 10 μg/ml insulin at a density of 5 × 105 cells/well. The cells were allowed to adhere to the cell culture dishes for 24 h and then incubated overnight in DMEM with 5.5 mm glucose and no insulin or dexamethasone. Subsequently, the cells were stimulated with different concentrations of insulin and/or adiponectin for another 24 h. The medium was then replaced with 0.5 ml of glucose-free DMEM without phenol red and supplemented with 5 mm each alanine, valine, glycine, pyruvate, and lactate. After incubation for 6 h, the glucose level in the medium was measured using the glucose Trinder assay kit. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis analysis identified eight protein spots that were preferentially expressed and secreted by adipocytes, and not from undifferentiated 3T3-L1 preadipocytes (Fig. 1, A and B). N-terminal amino acid sequencing revealed that all of these proteins (spots 1–8) share an identical N-terminal sequence (EDDVTTTE), which unequivocally matches amino acid residues 18–25 of mouse adiponectin, a secretory protein expressed exclusively by adipocytes (5Scherer P.E.

Chem. 1996; 271: 10697-10703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1890) Google Scholar). This sequenced fragment (EDDVTTTE) is located immediately after the hypothetical signal peptide cleavage site, suggesting that the heterogeneous isoforms of adiponectin are not caused by different protease cleavage during its secretion. The identities of these proteins as adiponectin were further confirmed by Western blot analysis, which showed that all eight proteins were immunoreactive to an antibody against mouse adiponectin (Fig. 1C). Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis separation of recombinant adiponectin produced by E. coli detected only a single spot (data not shown), suggesting that the existence of multiple isoforms of adiponectin produced by adipocytes is due to post-translational modification occurring during its secretion. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis analysis of recombinant adiponectin transiently expressed and secreted by COS-7 cells also demonstrated multiple isoforms of this protein, a pattern similar to that in adipocytes (data not shown). Carbohydrate-based detection of proteins separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis revealed that six isoforms of adiponectin (spots 3–8) derived from adipocytes are glycosylated (Fig. 1D), suggesting that glycosylation may at least partly contribute to the heterogeneity of adiponectin. Although there are two consensus N-linked glycosylation sites (Asn53and Asn233), treatment with tunicamycin, an inhibitor of N-linked glycosylation (28Wu G.C. Lai H.L. Lin Y.W. Chu Y.T. Chern Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35450-35457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), did not affect the glycosylation pattern (data not shown), thus excluding the possibility of N-linked glycosylation of adiponectin. A previous study using endoglycosidase H treatment also suggested that no N-glycosylation occurs on adiponectin (5Scherer P.E. Williams S. Fogliano M. Baldini G. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26746-26749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2744) Google Scholar). Furthermore, there were no potential serine and threonine residues predicted to be O-glycosylated using the NetOGlyc Version 2.0 prediction server (29Hansen J.E. Lund O. Tolstrup N. Gooley A.A. Williams K.L. Brunak S. Glycoconj. J. 1998; 15: 115-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar), which produces network predictions of mucin-type O-glycosylation sites in mammalian proteins. To further characterize the nature of the glycosylation and to map the glycosylation sites of adiponectin, tryptic peptide mixtures from each isoform of adiponectin derived from adipocytes, transiently transfected COS-7 cells, or E. coli were analyzed by MALDI-TOF-MS. Comparison of the mass spectra for these samples detected three prominent peptide fragments (with masses of 1679, 4260, and 4276 Da, respectively) that existed only in the six glycosylated isoforms, but not in the two unglycosylated isoforms or in adiponectin produced by E. coli (Fig. 2). Moreover, the masses of these three tryptic peptide fragments did not match any of the unmodified tryptic fragments of adiponectin, indicating that glycosylation of adiponectin may occur in these three fragments. To isolate these three peptide fragments, the tryptic peptide mixtures from all of the glycosylated isoforms were pooled and separated by RP-HPLC, and each fraction was analyzed by MALDI-TOF-MS (Fig. 3). This analysis found that fraction A, which eluted at 16.4% acetonitrile, contains the peptide with a mass of 1679 Da. The peptides with masses of 4276 and 4260 Da were detected in fractions B and C, which eluted at 18 and 18.4% acetonitrile, respectively. Amino acid sequence analysis identified the peptide with a mass of 1679 Da as K GEPGEAAYVYR, a fragment corresponding to amino acid residues 104–115 of mouse adiponectin. The peptides with masses of 4276 and 4260 Da were derived from the same fragment (DGTPGEK GEK GDAGLLGPK GETGDVGMTGAEGPR), which matches amino acid residues 62–95 of adiponectin. Notably, amino acid sequence analysis easily detected all of the amino acid residues in these three peptide fragments, except for the four lysine residues (lysine 104 in the peptide with a mass of 1679 Da and lysines 68, 71, and 80 in the peptides with masses of 4260 and 4276 Da). This result indicates that these lysine residues might be modified by hydrophilic groups such as carbohydrates so that the hydrophilic amino acid derivatives could not be efficiently extracted in nonpolar solvent by conventional liquid-phase sequencing. The conclusion that these four lysine residues are modified was further supported by the observation that they were resistant to digestion with trypsin, a proteinase that specifically cleaves at the C terminus of either arginine or lysine residues. Interestingly, these four lysines (residues 68, 71, 80, and 104) are located in the collagenous domain of adiponectin, with surrounding motifs of G XKGE(D). Sequence alignment revealed that these four lysines and their surrounding m"

However, their involvement in the development of the early phase of diabetic nephropathy has not been fully elucidated. We investigated the effects of AGE on growth and on vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) expression in human cultured mesangial cells. We prepared three immunochemically distinct AGE by incubating bovine serum albumin (BSA) with glucose, glyceraldehyde, or glycolaldehyde. When human mesangial cells were cultured with various types of AGE-BSA, viable cell numbers as well as DNA syntheses were significantly decreased. All of the AGE-BSA were found to significantly increase p53 and Bax protein accumulations and subsequently induce apoptotic cell death in mesangial cells. An antioxidant, N-acetylcysteine, significantly prevented the AGE-induced apoptotic cell death in mesangial cells. Human mesangial cells stimulated prostacyclin production by co-cultured glomerular endothelial cells. Furthermore, various types of AGE-BSA were found to up-regulate the levels of mRNAs for VEGF and stimulate the secretion of VEGF and MCP-1 proteins in mesangial cells. The results suggest that AGE disturbed glomerular homeostasis by inducing apoptotic cell death in mesangial cells and elicited hyperfiltration and microalbuminuria by stimulating the secretion of VEGF and MCP-1 proteins, thereby being involved in the pathogenesis of the early phase of diabetic nephropathy.

Diabetic nephropathy is a leading cause of end-stage renal disease and accounts for disabilities and high mortality rates in patients with diabetes (1Friedman E.A. Lifkin H. Porte D.

The development of diabetic nephropathy is characterized by glomerular hyperfiltration and thickening of glomerular basement membranes followed by an expansion of extracellular matrix in mesangial areas and increased albumin excretion rate. Diabetic nephropathy ultimately progresses to glomerular sclerosis associated with renal dysfunction (3Sharma K. Ziyadeh F.N. Diabetes. 1995; 44: 1139-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). Reducing sugars including glucose, fructose, and trioses can react non-enzymatically with the amino groups of proteins to form reversible Schiff bases and then Amadori products. These early glycation products undergo further complex reactions such as rearrangement, dehydration, and condensation to become irreversibly cross-linked heterogeneous fluorescent derivatives termed advanced glycation end products (AGE) 1The abbreviations used are: AGEadvanced glycation end productsBSAbovine serum albumingluglucoseglycerglyceraldehydeglycolglycolaldehydeVEGFvascular endothelial growth factorMCP-1monocyte chemoattractant protein-1NACN-acetylcysteinePGI2prostacyclinELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assayCMLcarboxylmethyllysine6-keto-PGF1α6-keto-prostaglandin F1α1The abbreviations used are: AGEadvanced glycation end productsBSAbovine serum albumingluglucoseglycerglyceraldehydeglycolglycolaldehydeVEGFvascular endothelial growth factorMCP-1monocyte chemoattractant protein-1NACN-acetylcysteinePGI2prostacyclinELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assayCMLcarboxylmethyllysine6-keto-PGF1α6-keto-prostaglandin F1α (4Brownlee M.

In fact, there is compelling evidence that the formation and accumulation of AGE mediates the progressive alteration in renal architecture and loss of renal function (15Makino H. Shikata K.

Therefore, we prepared three immunochemically distinct AGE in vitro by incubating bovine serum albumin (BSA) with glucose (glu)-AGE-BSA, glyceraldehyde (glycer)-AGE-BSA, or glycolaldehyde (glycol)-AGE-BSA. We then investigated the effects of AGE-BSA on growth and on vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) expression in human cultured mesangial cells. We demonstrated that all of the different types of AGE not only caused apoptotic cell death in mesangial cells but also elicited hyperfiltration and microalbuminuria by stimulating secretion of VEGF and MCP-1 proteins and thus were involved in the pathogenesis of the early phase of diabetic nephropathy. BSA (fraction V), 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid, N-acetylcysteine (NAC), Tris-HCl, EGTA, and EDTA were purchased from Sigma. d-Glyceraldehyde, glycolaldehyde, Triton X-100, sucrose, NaF, and protease inhibitor cocktails were from Nakalai Tesque (Kyoto, Japan). d-Glucose was purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd. (Osaka, Japan). Pyrraline, pentosidine, and argpyrimidine were kindly provided by Mitsubishi Kagaku Bio-clinical Laboratories, Inc. (Tokyo, Japan). 3-Deoxyglucosone hydroimidazolones, glyoxal-lysine dimer, and methylglyoxal-lysine dimer were generously provided by Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. (Tokushima, Japan). [3H]Thymidine, [γ-32P]ATP, [α-32P]UTP, Hybond-N+ nylon membrane, CDP-Star chemiluminescence system, enhanced chemiluminescence system, and prostacyclin (PGI2) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) system were from AmershamBiosciences (Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom). Reverse transcriptase and T4 polynucleotide kinase were from Takara (Kyoto, Japan). VEGF and MCP-1 ELISA systems were from R&D systems (Minneapolis, MN). AGE-BSA was prepared as described previously (18Takeuchi M. Bucala R. Suzuki T. Ohkubo T. Yamazaki M. Koike T. Kameda Y. Makita Z. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 2000; 59: 1094-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). BSA was incubated under sterile conditions with d-glucose for 8 weeks or withd-glyceraldehyde or glycolaldehyde for 7 days. Unincorporated sugars were then removed by dialysis against phosphate-buffered saline. Control non-glycated BSA was incubated in the same conditions with the exception of the absence of reducing sugars. Preparations were tested for endotoxin using Endospecy ES-20S system (Seikagaku Co., Tokyo, Japan) where no endotoxin was detectable. Carboxylmethyllysine (CML) and Carboxylethyllysine were prepared as described previously (18Takeuchi M. Bucala R. Suzuki T. Ohkubo T. Yamazaki M. Koike T. Kameda Y. Makita Z. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 2000; 59: 1094-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The extent of chemical modification was determined as described with 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid as a difference in lysine residues of modified and unmodified protein preparations (19Habeeb A.F.S.A. Anal. Biochem. 1966; 14: 328-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (1911) Google Scholar). The extent of lysine modification (%) of modified BSA preparations was 42% for glu-AGE-BSA, 65% for glycer-AGE-BSA, and 90% for glycol-AGE-BSA. Mesangial cells from human kidney were maintained in MsGM medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum and GA-1000 according to the manufacturer's instructions (Clonetics Corp., San Diego, CA). AGE treatments were carried out in a medium containing 0.5% fetal bovine serum and GA-1000. Medium was changed every 2 days. Human glomerular endothelial cells were purchased from Cell Systems Corporation (Kirkland, WA) and maintained in CS-C medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells at 2–4 passages were used for the experiments. Human mesangial cells cultured for the indicated time periods in the presence or absence of various types of AGE-BSA were dislodged with trypsin, and the number of viable cells was counted by the dye exclusion method (20Yamagishi S. Kawakami T. Fujimori H. Yonekura H. Tanaka N. Yamamoto Y. Urayama H. Watanabe Y. Yamamoto H. Microvasc. Res. 1999; 57: 329-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). [3H]Thymidine incorporation was determined as described previously (21Yamagishi S. Kobayashi K. Yamamoto H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 190: 418-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Human mesangial cells were incubated with various types of AGE-BSA for 4 or 6 days in the presence or absence of 1 mmNAC. Cells were then lysed, and the supernatant was analyzed in an ELISA for DNA fragments (Cell Death Detection ELISA, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Antibodies against glu-AGE-BSA was prepared as described previously (18Takeuchi M. Bucala R. Suzuki T. Ohkubo T. Yamazaki M. Koike T. Kameda Y. Makita Z. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 2000; 59: 1094-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Reactivity of antibodies to several AGE-modified BSA or non-glycated BSA was examined by competitive ELISA systems as described previously (22Takeuchi M. Makita Z. Yanagisawa K. Kameda Y. Koike T. Mol. Med. 1999; 5: 393-405Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Human mesangial cells treated with or without various types of AGE-BSA for 4 days were lysed in 30 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 10 mm EGTA, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm NaF, and protease inhibitor cocktails. 15 μg of proteins were loaded per lane and separated by SDS-PAGE (15%) and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The filter was then treated with mouse monoclonal antibody against human p53 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), and the resultant immunocomplexes were visualized with CDP-Star chemiluminescence system according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNase protection assay was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (RiboQuant multi-probe RNase protection assay system, BD PharMingen). Single-stranded antisense 32P-labeled probes were prepared from bax, bcl-2, and L32 templates, and then they were hybridized in excess to target RNA in solution, after which free probes and other single-stranded RNA were digested with RNase. The remaining RNase-protected probes are purified, resolved on denaturing polyacrylamide gels, and quantified by autoradiography. Human mesangial cells treated with or without various types of AGE-BSA for 4 days were lysed in 30 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 10 mm EGTA, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm NaF, and protease inhibitor cocktails. 15 μg of proteins were loaded per lane and separated by SDS-PAGE (15%) and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The filter was then treated with a polyclonal antibody against human Bax (Daco Corporation, Carpinteria, CA), and the resultant immunocomplexes were visualized with an enhanced chemiluminescence system as described previously (23Yamagishi S. Yonekura H. Yamamoto Y. Fujimori H. Sakurai S. Tanaka N. Yamamoto H. Lab. Invest. 1999; 79: 501-509PubMed Google Scholar). Human glomerular endothelial cells were plated in a 0.4-μm pore-sized 24-mm diameter well (Corning Coster Corporation, Cambridge, MA). The next day, the medium was changed to MsGM medium (Clonetics Corp., San Diego, CA) supplemented with 0.5% fetal bovine serum and GA-1000, and then the Transwell was inserted into a 6-well dish in which mesangial cells had been grown. After 24 h, the conditioned medium in the Transwell was corrected and analyzed in an ELISA for 6-keto-PGF1α. 6-keto-PGF1α, a stable metabolite of PGI2, released into media was measured with an ELISA system according to the manufacturer's instructions. Sequences of the upstream and downstream primers and the internal probe used in quantitative reverse transcription (RT)-PCR for detecting human VEGF and β-actin mRNAs were the same as described previously (24Nomura M. Yamagishi S. Harada S. Hayashi Y. Yamashima T. Yamashita J. Yamamoto H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28316-28324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Poly(A)+ RNAs were isolated (24Nomura M. Yamagishi S. Harada S. Hayashi Y. Yamashima T. Yamashita J. Yamamoto H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28316-28324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar) from cells treated with or without AGE-BSA for the various time periods, and they were analyzed by RT-PCR as described previously (24Nomura M.

Chem. 1995; 270: 28316-28324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). 10-μl aliquots of each RT-PCR reaction mixture were electrophoresed on a 1.2% agarose gel, transferred to a Hybond-N+ nylon membrane, and the membrane was hybridized with the respective32P end-labeled probes (25Yamagishi S. Hsu C.-C. Kobayashi K. Yamamoto H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 191: 840-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The amounts of poly(A)+ RNA templates (30 ng) and cycle numbers (35 cycles) for amplification were chosen in quantitative ranges where reactions proceeded linearly, which had been determined by plotting signal intensities as the functions of the template amounts and cycle numbers (24Nomura M. Yamagishi S. Harada S. Hayashi Y. Yamashima T. Yamashita J. Yamamoto H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28316-28324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Signal intensities of hybridized bands were measured by microcomputer-assisted NIH Image (Version 1.56). Human mesangial cells were incubated with various types of AGE-BSA for 4 days, and then VEGF and MCP-1 proteins released into media were measured with ELISA systems according to the manufacturer's instructions (26Yamagishi S. Edelstein D. Du X.L. Kaneda Y. Guzmán M. Brownlee M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25096-25100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). All values were presented as the means ± S.E. Statistical significance was evaluated using the Student's t test for paired comparison. p< 0.05 was considered significant. Mesangial cells were cultured with various types of AGE-BSA or non-glycated BSA, and viable cell numbers were determined at days 2 and 4 after AGE addition. As shown in Fig. 1 A, the growth curve was found to be shifted downwards by the treatments of AGE. Viable cell numbers of mesangial cells decreased to 40% of those of control cells when exposed to glycer-AGE for 4 days. All of the AGE-BSA also significantly inhibited DNA synthesis in mesangial cells (Fig. 1 B). Although CML was present in trace amounts in these AGE-BSA preparations, carboxylmethylated BSA added to the culture medium failed to inhibit DNA synthesis in human mesangial cells (data not shown). We next investigated whether AGE-BSA could induce apoptotic cell death in cultured mesangial cells. Apoptosis is characterized by DNA fragmentations because of endogenous endonuclease activation (27Schwartzman R.A. Cidlowski J.A. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 133-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar). Therefore, we quantitatively measured DNA fragments in the cytoplasm of mesangial cells exposed to AGE-BSA or non-glycated BSA. As shown in Fig. 2, various types of AGE-BSA slightly but significantly induced apoptotic cell death in mesangial cells. We prepared polyclonal antibodies against glu-AGE-BSA and then examined the reactivity of antibodies to several structurally identified AGE-modified BSA including pyrraline-BSA, pentosidine-BSA, argpyrimidine-BSA, 3-deoxyglucosone imidazolone-BSA, CML-BSA, carboxylethyllysine-BSA, glyoxal-lysine dimer, or methylglyoxal-lysine dimer. As shown in Fig. 3, A and B, the antibodies were found not to cross-react with these structurally well defined AGE epitopes. We next investigated whether the antibodies could neutralize the glu-AGE-induced apoptotic cell death in mesangial cells. As shown in Fig. 4 A, the antibodies were found to prevent the glu-AGE-induced mesangial cell apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. The results demonstrated that the structurally well defined AGE epitopes could not be involved in the AGE-induced apoptotic cell death in mesangial cells. We next investigated whether reactive oxygen species were involved in apoptotic cell death in mesangial cells. As shown in Fig. 4 B, an antioxidant, NAC was found to completely inhibit the glu-AGE-induced apoptotic cell death in mesangial cells. The tumor suppressor gene p53 not only controls the transition of cells from the G1 to S phase, but it is also capable of inducing programmed cell death (28Yonis-Rouach E. Grunwald D. Wilder S. Kimchi A. May E. Lawrence J.J. May P. Oren M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1415-1423Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated the effects of AGE-BSA on p53 protein accumulation in mesangial cells. As shown in Fig. 5 A, various types of AGE-BSA significantly increased p53 accumulation in mesangial cells. Proteins of Bcl-2 family are well known inducers and integrators of survival and death signals (29Adams J.M. Cory S.

Pathol. 2000; 156: 1025-1032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), and pro-apoptotic molecule Bax has also been shown to be a p53 target (31Choudhuri T. Pal S. Agwarwal M.L. Das T. Sa G. FEBS Lett. 2002; 512: 334-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Therefore, we next studied whether AGE-BSA could affect the expression of Bax in mesangial cells. As shown in Fig. 6 A, the level of bax mRNA was increased by the treatments of various types of AGE-BSA. When standardized to L32 mRNA-derived signals, the bax mRNA level in mesangial cells exposed to glycol-AGE for 4 days was ∼2-fold higher than that in controls. However, pro-survival molecule bcl-2 gene was found not to be expressed in cultured mesangial cells (data not shown). Western blot analysis also showed that various types of AGE actually increased the expression of the Bax protein in mesangial cells (Fig. 6 C). We next investigated whether human mesangial cells could affect the ability of glomerular endothelial cells to produce PGI2, the key substance endowing the endothelium with antithrombogenic activities (32Moncada S. Vane J.R. Pharmacol. Rev. 1979; 30: 293-331Google Scholar). Human glomerular endothelial cells were co-cultured with mesangial cells for 1 day, and the culture medium was assayed for 6-keto-PGF1α, a stable metabolite of PGI2. As shown in Fig. 7, the amount of 6-keto-PGF1α released from glomerular endothelial cells was significantly elevated when they were co-cultured on the mesangial feeder layer (mesangial cells caused a 3-fold increase in PGI2 production by co-cultured glomerular endothelial cells). Poly(A)+ RNAs were isolated from mesangial cells treated with various types of AGE-BSA for various time periods and analyzed by a quantitative RT-PCR technique to determine the effects of AGE on the expression of VEGF genes. It has been reported that there are five alternatively spliced products from the single VEGF gene, VEGF121, VEGF145, VEGF165, VEGF189, and VEGF206 (33Houck K.A. Ferrara N. Winer J. Cachianes G., Li, B. Leung D.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1806-1814Crossref PubMed Scopus (1228) Google Scholar). Because Northern blot analysis can not clearly discriminate the five mRNA products, we employed a more sensitive RT-PCR technique as described previously (24Nomura M. Yamagishi S. Harada S. Hayashi Y. Yamashima T. Yamashita J. Yamamoto H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28316-28324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). In these experiments, 486- and 618-base pair-long cDNA products would be amplified from mRNAs for VEGF121 and VEGF165, respectively (24Nomura M. Yamagishi S. Harada S. Hayashi Y. Yamashima T. Yamashita J. Yamamoto H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28316-28324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 8,A and B, human mesangial cells expressed mRNAs for VEGF121 and VEGF165, the secretory forms of VEGF. The VEGF mRNA levels began to increase at 2 h and reached a maximum at 4 h in the presence of various types of AGE-BSA. the peak value was 3-fold higher than the basal level when exposed to glycer-AGE-BSA. To confirm whether AGE actually increased the secretion of VEGF proteins, we further performed an ELISA for VEGF proteins in a medium of cells that had been treated with or without 100 μg/ml of various types of AGE-BSA for 4 days. As shown in Fig. 8 C, AGE were found to stimulate the secretions of VEGF proteins by mesangial cells. MCP-1 is a C-C chemokine for monocytes that can mediate monocyte infiltration in mesangial areas (34Wenzel U.O. Abboud H.E. Am. J. Kidney Dis. 1995; 26: 982-994Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). We investigated the effects of AGE on MCP-1 production by mesangial cells. As shown in Fig. 9, various types of AGE-BSA significantly stimulated the secretion of MCP-1 proteins by mesangial cells. We have demonstrated for the first time that various types of AGE, non-enzymatically glycated protein derivatives formed at an accelerated rate in diabetes (18Takeuchi M. Bucala R. Suzuki T. Ohkubo T. Yamazaki M. Koike T. Kameda Y. Makita Z. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 2000; 59: 1094-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), not only inhibit DNA synthesis but also induce apoptotic cell death in human mesangial cells. Mesangial cells occupy a central anatomical position in the glomerulus, playing crucial roles in maintaining structure and function of glomerular capillary tufts (35Dworkin L.D. Ichikawa I. Brenner B.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1983; 244: F95-F104PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, they actually provide structural support for capillary loops and modulate glomerular filtration by its smooth muscle activity (35Dworkin L.D. Ichikawa I. Brenner B.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1983; 244: F95-F104PubMed Google Scholar, 36Kreisbberg J. Venkatachalam M. Troyer D. Am. J. Physiol. 1985; 249: F457-F463PubMed Google Scholar, 37Schlondrorff D. FASEB J. 1987; 1: 272-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Therefore, AGE-induced mesangial cell loss and the resultant mesangial cell-altered contractility may contribute in part to glomerular hyperfiltration, an early renal dysfunction in diabetes (3Sharma K. Ziyadeh F.N. Diabetes. 1995; 44: 1139-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). In this study, AGE antibodies that did not cross-react with well defined AGE epitopes completely neutralized the cytopathic effects of glu-AGE-BSA on mesangial cells. Therefore, it is unlikely that such structurally identified AGE proteins are relevant epitopes in the preparations of AGE-BSA. Furthermore, we have recently found that structural epitopes of in vitro prepared AGE actually existed in the serum of diabetic patients, and glu-AGE acted on mesangial cells at the physiological concentration of diabetic patients (18Takeuchi M. Bucala R. Suzuki T. Ohkubo T. Yamazaki M. Koike T. Kameda Y. Makita Z. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 2000; 59: 1094-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 22Takeuchi M. Makita Z. Yanagisawa K. Kameda Y. Koike T. Mol. Med. 1999; 5: 393-405Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The results suggest that structurally unidentified AGE epitope in the preparations of AGE-BSA might be involved in the development of diabetic nephropathy. In this study, CML added to the culture medium failed to inhibit DNA synthesis in mesangial cells (data not shown). Because CML adducts of proteins have been reported to be ligands for receptor for AGE termed RAGE (38Kislinger T., Fu, C. Huber B, Qu, W. Taguchi A., Du Yan S. Hofmann M. Yan S.F. Pischetsrieder M. Stern D. Schmidt A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31740-31749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar), it is probable that AGE receptors other than RAGE might mediate the AGE effects. We have found in this study that various types of AGE increased p53 accumulation in mesangial cells. Furthermore, pro-apoptotic molecule bax mRNA and protein were induced by treatments with AGE. Because p53 has been reported to mediate programmed cell death through Bax protein expression in response to a number of stress signals (31Choudhuri T. Pal S. Agwarwal M.L. Das T. Sa G. FEBS Lett. 2002; 512: 334-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 39Agarwal M.L. Taylor W.R. Chernov M.V. Chernov O.B. Stark G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar), AGE might induce apoptotic cell death in mesangial cells through p53-dependent Bax expression. In this study, NAC completely prevented the glu-AGE-induced mesangial cell apoptosis. Therefore, reactive oxygen species generation induced by AGE might also be involved in mesangial cell apoptosis. Recently, Sandau et al. (40Sandau K. Pfeilschifter J. Brune B. Kidney Int. 1997; 52: 378-386Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) reported that superoxide induced p53 and Bax accumulation during mesangial cell apoptosis, supporting our observation. We have previously shown that AGE exerted a growth inhibitory effect and a cell type-specific immediate toxicity on retinal pericytes, the microvascular counterpart of mesangial cells, and have proposed a novel mechanism for pericyte loss, the earliest histopathological hallmark in diabetic retinopathy (8Yamagishi S. Hsu C.-C. Taniguchi M. Harada S. Yamamoto Y. Ohsawa K. Kobayashi K. Yamamoto H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 213: 681-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The results suggest that AGE-induced loss of vascular wall cells in kidney and retina may be an initial event that leads to the progression of diabetic microangiopathies. Recently, Bax is reported to be increased in the retina of diabetic subjects and associated with apoptosis of pericytes (30Podestá F. Romeo G. Liu W.H. Krajewski S. Reed J.C. Gerhardinger C. Lorenzi M. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 156: 1025-1032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is probable that AGE may be mainly involved in apoptotic cell death of pericytes through the induction of Bax in diabetic retinopathy. There is a growing body of evidence that platelet activation may participate in the pathogenesis of diabetic vascular complications by promoting microthrombus formation (41Bern M.M. Diabetes. 1978; 27: 342-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 42Brownlee M. Cerami A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 385-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 43Yamagishi S. Edelstein D. Du X.L. Brownlee M. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 1491-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). In addition, antiplatelet agents such as thromboxane synthetase inhibitor and dipyridamole have been reported to decrease microalbuminuria and retard the progression of diabetic nephropathy (44Giustina A. Perini P. Desenzani P. Bossoni S. Ianniello P. Milani M. Davi G. Romanello G. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 423-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 45Donadio J.V., Jr. Iistrup D.M. Holley K.E. Romero J.C. Mayo Clin. Proc. 1988; 63: 3-15Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In this study, we found for the first time that mesangial cells can stimulate the production of PGI2, an antithrombogenic prostanoid, by co-cultured glomerular endothelial cells. Pericytes also possess the ability to stimulate PGI2 production by endothelial cells (21Yamagishi S. Kobayashi K. Yamamoto H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 190: 418-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Therefore, AGE-induced vascular wall cell loss could predispose the neighboring endothelial cells to thrombogenesis by impairing PGI2 production and thus be implicated in the development and progression of diabetic microangiopathies. Recently, a novel bioactive peptide PGI2-stimulating factor was cloned, and its mRNA expression found to be suppressed in the kidney of streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats (46Ono Y. Umeda F. Sekiguchi N. Masakado M. Nawata H. J. Diabetes Complications. 1998; 12: 252-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Mesangial cells could contribute to the maintenance of glomerular hemostasis by producing PGI2-stimulating factor. VEGF is a specific mitogen to endothelial cells, also known as vascular permeability factor, and is generally thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy (47Adamis A.P. Miler J.W. Bernal M.T. D'Amico D.J. Folkman J. Yeo T.K. Yeo K.T. Am. J. Ophthalmol. 1994; 118: 445-450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1194) Google Scholar). Recently, antibodies against VEGF have been found to improve hyperfiltration and albuminuria in experimental diabetes (48De Vriese A.S. Tilton R.G. Elger M. Stephan C.C. Kriz W. Lameire N.H. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2001; 12: 993-1000Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, AGE-induced VEGF overproduction by mesangial cells might play a central role in the early phase of diabetic nephropathy (49Tsuchida K. Makita Z. Yamagishi S. Atsumi T. Miyoshi H. Obara S. Ishida M. Ishikawa S. Yasumura K. Koike T. Diabetologia. 1999; 42: 579-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). In support of our observations, pronounced immunostaining of mesangial VEGF was observed in diabetic nephropathy, and significant correlation was found between VEGF excretion and the level of microalbuminuria in patients with diabetes (50Cha D.R. Kim N.H. Yoon J.W. Jo S.K. Cho W.K. Kim H.K. Wo N.H. Kidney Int. 2000; 77: 5104-5112Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have recently found that all of the AGE preparations used in these experiments increased levels of VEGF mRNAs in bovine retinal pericytes (51Yamagishi S. Amano S. Inagaki Y. Okamoto T. Koga K. Sasaki N. Yamamoto H. Takeuchi M. Makita Z. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 290: 973-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that AGE could induce similar metabolic and functional abnormalities in vascular wall cells such as mesangial cells and pericytes and thus participate in the development of diabetic microangiopathies. MCP-1 is a specific chemokine that recruits and activates monocytes from circulation to inflammatory sites (34Wenzel U.O. Abboud H.E. Am. J. Kidney Dis. 1995; 26: 982-994Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Increased MCP-1 expression associated with monocyte infiltration in mesangium has been observed in the early phase of diabetic nephropathy (52Banba N. Nakamura T. Matsumura M. Kuroda H. Hattori Y. Kasai K. Kidney Int. 2000; 58: 684-690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). AGE accumulation in glomerulus could be implicated in the initiation of diabetic nephropathy by promoting the secretion of MCP-1 in mesangial cells. In conclusion, AGE could not only disturb glomerular homeostasis by inducing apoptotic cell death in mesangial cells but also elicit hyperfiltration and microalbuminuria by stimulating the secretion of VEGF and MCP-1 proteins and thereby could be involved in the pathogenesis of the early phase of diabetic nephropathy."

Oxidative DNA damage is generated by a variety of environmental and endogenous agents, including ionizing radiation, certain chemicals, and products of aerobic metabolism (1von Sonntag C. The Chemical Basis of Radiation Biology.

In Escherichia coli, formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase (Fpg, EC 3.2.2.23) removes 8-oxoG, Me-FaPy, and several structurally related lesions from damaged DNA (7Tchou J. Kasai H. Shibutani S.

Fpg is a component of the “GO system” that includes MutY, a mismatch adenine-DNA glycosylase, and MutT, an 8-oxodGTPase (9Michaels M.L. Tchou J. Grollman A.P. Miller J.H.

Both proteins belong to a family unrelated by sequence or tertiary structure to a larger family of DNA glycosylases, for which the prototype is endonuclease III (Nth) (13Thayer M.M. Ahern H. Xing D.

Fpg also possesses AP lyase activity, nicking the phosphodiester backbone of DNA at the site of the lesion. Base excision by Fpg is followed immediately by two β-elimination steps, resulting in a single nucleotide gap flanked by phosphate termini (7Tchou J. Kasai H. Shibutani S. Chung M.-H. Laval J.

A Schiff base intermediate, involving Pro-1 of the enzyme and C1′ of the damaged nucleotide, forms early in the reaction sequence and can be reductively trapped by treatment with NaBH4 forming a stable covalent complex (18Tchou J.

Comparing the structures of Fpg, Nei, and Ogg1 provides a unique opportunity to analyze features of damage recognition and catalysis common to DNA glycosylases/AP lyases. The presence of DNA enhances the analytic power of the model by revealing the precise nature of enzyme-DNA interactions. The structure of the human Ogg1 catalytic domain complexed to DNA has been solved (21Bruner S.D. Norman D.P.G. Verdine G.L.

The structure of Fpg from Thermus thermophilus HB8 (Tth-Fpg) has recently been solved in the absence of DNA (24Sugahara M. Mikawa T. Kumasaka T. Yamamoto M. Kato R. Fukuyama K. Inoue Y. Kuramitsu S.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5084-5096Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), many questions remain unanswered regarding the mode of Fpg-DNA interactions and the catalytic reaction mechanism of this important DNA repair protein. To investigate the mechanisms of Fpg-DNA interactions, we have utilized NaBH4 reduction of the Schiff base intermediate to produce a stable covalent cross-link between Fpg and duplex DNA. We crystallized and determined the three-dimensional structure of this complex at 2.1 Å, revealing for the first time the three dimensional precise mode of DNA binding by Fpg as well as several important features of the catalytic mechanism of this enzyme. We used this model to rationalize numerous biochemical observations and site-directed mutagenesis studies of Fpg. The present study provides insight into the structural basis of Fpg-DNA binding, furnishing information essential for a mechanistic understanding of DNA glycosylases. The 13-mers CCAGGA(8-oxoG)GAAGCC and GGCTTCATCCTGG were synthesized by established phosphoramidite chemistry (26Bodepudi V. Shibutani S. Johnson F. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1992; 5: 608-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and annealed in a 1:1 ratio. The E. coli fpg gene was amplified from E. coli genomic DNA by PCR using Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene); NdeI and BamHI restriction sites were present on the primers. The amplified fragment was inserted into the NdeI-BamHI site of the pET13a plasmid (27Gerchman S.E. Graziano V. Ramakrishnan V. Protein Expr. Purif. 1994; 5: 242-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and used to transform B834(DE3) E. coli cells. To purify recombinant Fpg, cells from 1 liter of culture, induced with 50 μm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 6 h at 37 °C, were lysed by treatment with 50 μg/ml lysozyme in Tris/EDTA buffer, pH 8.0, containing 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. DNA was precipitated with 0.01% polyethyleneimine, 1 m NaCl, and the supernatant was treated with 45% saturated (NH4)2SO4. The pellet was dissolved in Buffer A (20 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 200 mm NaCl), loaded on a Fractogel EMD SO3− 650 (Merck) column equilibrated in the same buffer and eluted by a 200–600 mm NaCl gradient in Buffer A. Fractions containing Fpg were diluted, applied to a heparin-Sepharose CL-6B (Amersham Biosciences) column, and eluted with a 200–800% mm NaCl gradient in Buffer A. Fractions of at least 90% purity were used directly for cross-linking. The cross-linking reaction mixture (10 ml), including 100–200 nmol of duplex oligonucleotide, 1–2 mg of Fpg, 25 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.8, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 50 mm NaBH4 was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C and then quenched by adding 400 mm glucose. The sample was loaded onto a Poros HQ 4.6/50 column (PerSeptive Biosystems) equilibrated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 200 mm NaCl, eluted at 460 mm NaCl, concentrated to 1.8–2.0 mg/ml in a Centricon-3 device (Millipore), and used for crystallization experiments. Crystals were obtained by mixing 2-μl volumes of Fpg-DNA complex and reservoir solution (30% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000, 0.2 m(NH4)2SO4, 0.1 m sodium cacodylate pH 6.5), and equilibrating the drop with 1 ml of reservoir solution at 15 °C for several days. X-ray diffraction data (Table I) were collected on crystals soaked for ∼3 min in a solution composed of 80% reservoir solution, 20% glycerol and flash-cooled to 100 K under a cold nitrogen gas stream. Data were obtained with a Quantum-4 CCD area detector (ADSC) at the National Synchroton Light Source X26C beamline, Brookhaven National Laboratory, and processed with DENZO and SCALEPACK (28Otwinowski Z.

Open table in a new tab Matthews coefficient calculations suggest four Fpg-DNA monomers in an asymmetric unit. The Fpg-DNA structure was determined by molecular replacement (MR), using REPLACE (29Tong L. Rossmann M.G. Acta Crystallogr. 1990; A46: 783-792Crossref Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 30Tong L. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 748-751Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and CNS (31Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S.

Polar angle self-rotation function calculations resulted in two major peaks, indicating an asymmetric unit of 222 non-crystallographic symmetry. Rotation and translation functions calculations employed all data in the 10.0–4.0-Å resolution range. Structures of Tth-Fpg (24Sugahara M. Mikawa T. Kumasaka T. Yamamoto M. Kato R. Fukuyama K. Inoue Y. Kuramitsu S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3857-3869Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) (1EE8) and a recently determined Nei-DNA complex (Ref. 23Zharkov D.O. Golan G. Gilboa R. Fernandes A.S.

Taylor & Francis, London1987Google ScholarK3W) were combined to form a search model for MR. Calculations imposing non-crystallographic symmetry, implemented in the “locked” cross rotation function in REPLACE, resulted in clear separation between the top and the second peaks, with no overlap between monomers in the unit cell. A translation function search was performed with CNS, using the constructed Fpg-DNA tetramer as a search model and including Patterson correlation refinement (32Brünger A.T. Acta Crystallogr. 1990; A46: 46-57Crossref Scopus (361) Google Scholar) and rigid body refinement for each of the monomers. This search gave a clear MR solution that was used for later stages of refinement. Solvent flipping (33Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Acta Crystallogr. 1996; D52: 30-42Crossref Scopus (1142) Google Scholar) and 4-fold averaging, calculated to 2.1 Å resolution, increased the overall figure of merit from 0.42 to 0.89. Electron density maps were calculated from the refined MR phases. An initial model was constructed using the program “O” (34Jones T.A. Zou J.-Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. 1991; A47: 110-119Crossref Scopus (13014) Google Scholar), allowing clear determination of most of the structure, including components (e.g. zinc ion and most of the DNA bases) missing from the search model. The model was subjected to simulated annealing and iterative cycles of positional and temperature factor refinement, followed by manual fitting and rebuilding. An overall anisotropic temperature factor and bulk solvent correction factor were applied throughout the calculation. Progress of the refinement was monitored via Rfree (35Brünger A.T. Nature. 1992; 355: 472-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (3872) Google Scholar). Strict non-crystallographic symmetry constraints were applied in the initial rounds of refinement. Subsequently, tight non-crystallographic symmetry restraints (force constant of 300 kcal/mol) were applied to allow proper refinement of regions significantly different in structure from that of the search model. All of the DNA and most of the protein residues were identified, except for the loop including residues 217–224 and the side chains of several amino acids remote from the protein-DNA interface. Water molecules were assigned to peaks in the [Fo −Fc] electron density maps larger than 3ς and within potential hydrogen-bonding distance. The figures were prepared using MidasPlus (36Ferrin T.E.

Proteins. 1991; 11: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (5318) Google Scholar). 3DNA (41Lu X.-J. Shakked Z. Olson W.K. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 819-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) was used to calculate various DNA structural parameters. A model of Fpg complexed with the DNA duplex containing an everted 8-oxodG residue was built based on the current structure and the structure of 8-oxoG-containing DNA from the Ogg1-DNA complex (1EBM, Ref. 21Bruner S.D. Norman D.P.G. Verdine G.L. Nature. 2000; 403: 859-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar). The missing residues 217–224 were modeled based on the corresponding loop of Tth-Fpg (1EE8, Ref. 24Sugahara M. Mikawa T. Kumasaka T. Yamamoto M. Kato R. Fukuyama K. Inoue Y. Kuramitsu S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3857-3869Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The model was subjected to a series of energy minimization steps using the Discover module of Insight II (Accelrys) until the root mean-squared gradient was smaller than 0.001 kcal/(mol·Å). All energy optimizations were performed using the AMBER force field (42Weiner S.J. Kollman P.A. Case D.A. Singh U.C. Ghio C. Alagona G. Profeta S., Jr. Weiner P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1984; 106: 765-784Crossref Scopus (4895) Google Scholar) with a distance-dependent dielectric constant of 4r, using the steepest descent and conjugate gradient methods. The phosphorus atoms of the DNA and the Cα atoms of the protein, except for the newly built loop, were restrained with harmonic forces. To find a conformation with lower energy for the missing loop and the everted 8-oxodG, we also performed simulated annealing molecular dynamic runs from 1000 to 298 K. The conservation of residues within the Nei and Fpg subfamilies of the Fpg family was analyzed using the AMAS algorithm (43Livingstone C.D. Barton G.J. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1993; 9: 745-756PubMed Google Scholar) and the cluster of orthologous groups data base (44Tatusov R.L. Natale D.A. Garkavtsev I.V. Tatusova T.A. Shankavaram U.T. Rao B.S. Kiryutin B.

Gerchman S.E. Kycia J.H. Rieger R.A. Grollman A.P. Shoham G. EMBO J. 2002; 23: 789-800Crossref Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The overall structure of Fpg comprises two domains connected by a hinge polypeptide (Fig. 1, a and b) and resembles that of Tth-Fpg (24Sugahara M. Mikawa T. Kumasaka T. Yamamoto M. Kato R. Fukuyama K. Inoue Y. Kuramitsu S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3857-3869Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) and E. coli Nei (23Zharkov D.O. Golan G. Gilboa R. Fernandes A.S. Gerchman S.E. Kycia J.H. Rieger R.A. Grollman A.P. Shoham G. EMBO J. 2002; 23: 789-800Crossref Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The N-terminal domain contains eight β-strands, forming a β-sandwich with two α-helices parallel to its edges. The C-terminal domain includes four α-helices, two of which, αD and αE, form the helix-two turn-helix (H2TH) motif, and two β-strands that form a β-hairpin zinc finger. The excised base, 8-oxoG, is not retained in the crystal. The ring-opened deoxyribitol moiety (dRbl), formed after base excision and NaBH4 reduction, is everted from the helix with C1′ bound covalently to Nα of Pro-1 (Fig. 2), as suggested by biochemical experiments identifying Pro-1 as the residue involved in Schiff base formation (18Tchou J.

DNA is severely kinked at the lesion point (roll angle, 66°), and the minor groove is significantly widened. Except at the lesion site, the DNA is essentially B-form. As commonly observed in DNA-binding proteins, the DNA-binding groove is positively charged (Fig. 3).Figure 3The solvent-accessible surface of Fpg, colored according to electrostatic potential and demonstrating the positive DNA binding cleft. The bound 13-mer DNA duplex is superimposed on the positively charged surface as a stick model (yellow). The negatively charged binding pocket is clearly seen in the center of the groove, containing the modeled 8-oxoG (inset).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Binding to DNA involves extensive interactions between Fpg and DNA (Fig. 4). A hydrogen bond network involving all loops that face DNA comprises 2512 Å2 of contact surface area. This relatively large buried surface area is consistent with the heat capacity change reported for Fpg binding to a lesion-containing duplex. 2C. A. Minetti, D. P. Remeter, E. G. Plum, and K. J. Breslauer, unpublished observations. A similar value for binding-induced burial of previously exposed solvent accessible surface area (2268 Å2) has been reported for Ogg1 (21Bruner S.D. Norman D.P.G. Verdine G.L. Nature. 2000; 403: 859-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar); significantly higher than for human alkylpurine-DNA glycosylase (1034 Å2) (45Lau A.Y. Schärer O.D. Samson L. Verdine G.L. Ellenberger T. Cell. 1998; 95: 249-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar) and uracil-DNA glycosylase (700 Å2) (46Parikh S.S. Mol C.D. Slupphaug G. Bharati S. Krokan H.E. Tainer J.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5214-5226Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Fpg mainly contacts the damaged strand 3′ to dRbl (P0, P−1, P−2) via side chains and backbone hydrogen atoms of the highly conserved Lys-56, His-70, Asn-168, Tyr-236, and Arg-258 residues. Fpg binds DNA in the minor groove; the damaged base is extruded from the helix through the major groove (Fig. 3). The complementary strand is held in position largely through Watson-Crick bonds; interactions with the enzyme are few, and except for His-89, the amino acids involved are not conserved. Asn-168, Arg-258, and Lys-56 contact P0, P−1, and P−2, stabilizing the complex (Fig. 5 a). Asn-168 is part of the H2TH motif and forms bonds through backbone and side chain amides to P−1 and P0, respectively. The zinc finger forms four hydrogen bonds with the phosphodiester backbone, three of which involve Arg-258 (two to P0, one to P−1) and one via Gln-257, to P(3). Lys-56, located on the β2-β3 loop, forms hydrogen bonds with P−1 and P−2. Extrusion of the damaged base, which facilitates its binding in the enzyme active site, is a common structural feature of DNA glycosylases (21Bruner S.D. Norman D.P.G. Verdine G.L. Nature. 2000; 403: 859-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar, 45Lau A.Y. Schärer O.D. Samson L. Verdine G.L. Ellenberger T.

Eversion of deoxyribose is achieved by rotation around the P-O5′ and O3′-P bonds. The geometry of Fpg-induced DNA kinking differs from that observed for uracil-DNA glycosylase (46Parikh S.S. Mol C.D.

Nature. 2000; 403: 859-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar), which “pinch” the DNA backbone at the extrusion site, decreasing the normal distance (∼12 Å in B-DNA) between P−1 and P1 by 30–50%. Similar to E. coli and human alkylpurine-DNA glycosylases complexed with DNA (45Lau A.Y. Schärer O.D. Samson L. Verdine G.L. Ellenberger T. Cell. 1998; 95: 249-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 48Hollis T. Ichikawa Y. Ellenberger T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 758-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), Fpg does not compress the phosphodiester backbone (P−1–P1is 11.4 Å). Thus, base eversion is not absolutely dependent on strain induced by massive backbone compression (46Parikh S.S. Mol C.D. Slupphaug G. Bharati S. Krokan H.E. Tainer J.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5214-5226Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar, 47Slupphaug G. Mol C.D. Kavli B. Arvai A.S. Krokan H.E. Tainer J.A. Nature. 1996; 384: 87-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Nucleotide eversion effected by Fpg may be achieved by “holding” the flanking phosphates with Lys-56, Asn-168, and Arg-258, coupled with intercalation of hydrophobic residues into duplex DNA (49Werner R.M. Jiang Y.L. Gordley R.G. Jagadeesh G.J. Ladner J.E. Xiao G. Tordova M. Gilliland G.L. Stivers J.T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12585-12594Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5,a and b). The energy required for extruding a single base from kinked double helical DNA has been estimated at ∼3 kcal/mol (50van Aalten D.M.F. Erlanson D.A. Verdine G.L. Joshua-Tor L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11809-11814Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), a barrier readily attained through noncovalent enzyme-DNA interactions. Eversion of dRb1, coupled with loss of a base, creates a substantial gap between opposite strands, reflected in the 14.7 Å distance between C1′ of dRb1 and C(0), as compared with 10.5 Å in B-DNA. The gap is filled by the hydrophobic residues Met-73, Arg-108, and Phe-110 (Fig. 5 b). Met-73, part of the β4-β5 loop, enters the helix through the minor groove, occupying the position vacated by the extruded base. Arg-108 and Phe-110 are located on the β7-β8 loop. Phe-110, wedged between C(1)and C(0), engages in face-to-face π interactions (51Burley S.K. Petsko G.A. Science. 1985; 229: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (2256) Google Scholar) with the C(1) pyrimidine ring. Unstacking of these bases may contribute significantly to DNA kinking. C(0) remains intrahelical, stabilized by hydrogen bonds from O2 and N3 to Arg-108, contributing to Fpg specificity through opposite base recognition (Fig. 5 b). The position of dRb1 is fixed by the Nα–C1′ covalent bond and the absolutely conserved Glu-2, which forms a hydrogen bond with O4′. Glu-2 is stabilized by hydrogen bonds to backbone amides of Ile-169 and Gly-167 located in the H2TH αE helix.

By crossing presenilin 1 transgenic mice carrying the A246E mutation with plaque-producing amyloid precursor protein K670N/M671L transgenic mice (Tg2576), we show that co-expression of both mutant transgenes results in acceleration of amyloid accumulation and associative learning deficits. At 5 months of age with no detectable plaque pathology, amyloid precursor protein transgenic animals are impaired in contextual fear learning following two pairings of conditioned and unconditioned stimuli but appear normal following a more robust five-pairing training. At 9 months of age when β-amyloid deposition is evident, these mice are impaired following both two-pairing and five-pairing protocols. Mice carrying both transgenes are impaired in contextual fear conditioning at either age. All transgenic animal groups performed as well as controls in cued fear conditioning, indicating that the contextual fear learning deficits are hippocampus-specific. The associative learning impairments are coincident with elevated α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor protein in the dentate gyrus.

Familial AD (FAD) is associated with several risk factors, the best-correlated being age and the inheritance of specific genes (mutations or allele type) that result in increased β-amyloid (Aβ) production. The discovery that soluble Aβ is elevated in the brains of AD patients raises the issue whether these molecules play a causative role in AD (1Kuo Y.M. Emmerling M.R. Vigo-Pelfrey C. Kasunic T.C.

Aβ42 is highly fibrillogenic and exhibits trophic and toxic effects on neurons (3Lambert M.P. Barlow A.K. Chromy B.A. Edwards C. Freed R. Liosatos M. Morgan T.E. Rozovsky I. Trommer B. Viola K.L.

Westerman M. Bui D. Bell K. Ashe K.H. Sweatt J.D. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 4125-4133Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We also demonstrated that elevation of Aβ in vivo using an animal model for AD (Tg2576) (7Hsiao K. Chapman P. Nilsen S. Eckman C. Harigaya Y. Younkin S. Yang F. Cole G. Science. 1996; 274: 99-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (3668) Google Scholar), leads to the up-regulation of hippocampal α7 nAChR protein. α7 nAChR up-regulation in the hippocampus of Tg2576 animals negatively correlates with their performance in the Morris water maze, a hippocampus-dependent spatial learning task, and α7 nAChR up-regulation occurs concomitantly with dysregulation of the 42-kDa isoform of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK2) MAPK (6Dineley K.T.

Our working model posits that hippocampus-dependent learning and memory impairments in AD arise because of increased Aβ burden and chronic activation of the ERK MAPK cascade in hippocampus through α7 nAChRs. We tested the hypothesis that transgenic animals in which Aβ is elevated to varying degrees will exhibit hippocampus-dependent behavioral impairments. We also tested whether the cognitive deficits might precede plaque deposition and coincide with increased α7 nAChR protein in the hippocampus. In this study, we performed a histopathological, biochemical, and behavioral characterization of three transgenic mouse lines expressing mutant human PS-1 (A246E) (11Qian S. Jiang P. Guan X.M.

Cole G. Science. 1996; 274: 99-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (3668) Google Scholar), or both the mutated human genes that are linked to FAD. We found that plaque appearance is accelerated in the brains of PS-1/APP transgenic animals. In addition, the three groups of transgenic animals and non-transgenic controls were evaluated for behavioral and associative learning performance at 5 and 9 months of age. Behavioral analyses were followed by biochemical measurement of α7 nAChR levels in CA1 and DG of the hippocampus. We found an age-dependent decrement in hippocampus-dependent associative learning. This cognitive defect coincides with elevated α7 nAChR protein in DG. Our data provide evidence that the age-of-onset for behavioral manifestation of hippocampal dysfunction precedes gross plaque deposition, and α7 nAChR protein level in the hippocampus serves as a biochemical marker for this defect. To generate the four mouse genotypes used in this study, heterozygous mutant (K670N/M671L) APP (50% C57B6, 50% SJL) (7Hsiao K. Chapman P. Nilsen S. Eckman C. Harigaya Y. Younkin S. Yang F. Cole G.

Nomenclature for the transgenic animal lines is as follows: PS-1 refers to animals heterozygous for the PS-1 A246E transgene; APP refers to animals heterozygous for the APP K670N/M671L transgene; PS-1/APP refers to animals heterozygous for both mutant transgenes. Nontransgenic control animals were littermates generated in the breeding for PS-1/APP transgenic animals. As a control for the effects of mutant PS-1 on plaque deposition and Aβ levels, transgenic animals heterozygous for both human wild-type PS-1 and mutant PS-1 transgenes were generated. Mouse genotype was determined by PCR (11Qian S. Jiang P. Guan X.M. Singh G. Trumbauer M.E., Yu, H. Chen H.Y. Van de Ploeg L.H. Zheng H. Neuron. 1998; 20: 611-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The genetic backgrounds of the mice analyzed were 50% C57B6, 50% SJL. Male and female mice were used. All animal experiments were performed in accordance with the Baylor College of Medicine Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and with national regulations and policies. Mice were cardiac-perfused with phosphate buffered saline (10 mm NaHPO4, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.2) and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. Frozen brain sections were sectioned coronally at a 12-μm thickness using a cryostat, mounted on ProbeOn Plus microscope slides (Fisher Scientific), and air-dried. Immediately before staining, the brain sections were fixed with acetone. Tissue sections were incubated for 30 min in 0.3% H2O2 and 0.3% normal goat serum, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated with 1.5% normal goat serum in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min. Brain sections were then incubated with anti-Aβ antibody 6E10 (1:1000, Senetik) stained with biotinylated anti-mouse IgG (1:200, Vector Laboratories), and immunodetected with Vectastain ABC Reagent (1:100, Vector Laboratories). Sections were counter-stained with hematoxylin. Animals were decapitated, and both hippocampi removed and placed into ice-cold cutting solution (1.25 mm NaH2PO4, 28 mmNaHCO3, 60 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 110 mm sucrose, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 7 mm MgCl2, 5 mm glucose, 0.6 mm ascorbate). Area CA1 and DG were subdissected from each hippocampus by trimming away the alveus and fimbria of cross-sections of ventral hippocampus. CA1 and DG were separated from CA3 by slicing cross-wise at the lateral aspect of the hippocampal fissure. The slice was then sectioned through the hippocampal fissure to separate CA1 and DG. Isolated hippocampal regions were prepared for quantitative immunoblotting as described. Quantitative immunoblotting was previously described in Dineley et al. (6Dineley K.T. Westerman M. Bui D. Bell K. Ashe K.H. Sweatt J.D. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 4125-4133Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, harvested brain tissue was sonicated in sonication buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mmNaF, 1 mm ED/EGTA, 10 mmNa4P2O7, 200 nmcalyculin A, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μm microcystin-LR, 1 mmNa3VO4), and protein concentration was determined with BCA (Pierce). Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to Immobilon-P (Millipore), and followed by immunoblot with the appropriate primary and secondary antibodies and chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Band intensity was quantified with Scion Image software (NIH Image) from film exposures (BioMax, Kodak) in the linear range for each antibody and normalized to control level. Normalized control values were determined for each immunoblot by averaging control values, dividing each control and transgenic sample density by the average of the control set, and then determining the average and standard error of the mean (S.E.) for control and transgenic samples: 5 months, n = 9 control animals,n = 6 PS-1, n = 15 APP, andn = 10 PS-1/APP transgenic animals; 9 months,n = 14 control animals, n = 5 PS-1,n = 11 APP, and n = 11 PS-1/APP transgenic animals. Each subject was placed into the center of an open field chamber, a clear arena 43 × 43 cm in dimension illuminated by a 75-W bulb. The open field was divided into 225 equally sized squares by 15 photoreceptor beams on each side of the arena. Locomotor activity was quantified using a Digiscan optical animal activity system (RXYZCM, Accuscan Electronics) (16McNish K.A. Gewirtz J.C. Davis M. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 9353-9360Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Activity measures represent the number of photoreceptor beam breaks in both the horizontal and vertical planes collected in 2-min intervals over a 30-min test period. Additional activity data include the total distance traveled in the horizontal plane (in cm) and the ratio of the time spent in the 16 most centrally located squares compared with the total distance traveled (center:distance ratio): 5 months, n= 11 control animals, n = 6 PS-1, n = 19 APP, and n = 12 PS-1/APP transgenic animals; 9 months, n = 11 control animals, n = 9 PS-1, n = 15 APP, and n = 9 PS-1/APP transgenic animals. Motor coordination, balance, and motor learning were evaluated with the accelerating rotarod test. In this test, mice were assessed for their ability to maintain their balance on a rotating bar that accelerates 7.2 rpm/min. Over the course of each 5-min trial, the speed of the rotarod accelerated from 4 to 40 rpm. The amount of time before the subject fell from the rod was measured. Mice underwent four rotarod trials per day for two consecutive days with an intertrial interval of no less than 30 min: 5 months, n= 10 control animals, n = 6 PS-1, n = 18 APP, and n = 11 PS-1/APP transgenic animals; 9 months, n = 11 control animals, n = 9 PS-1, n = 14 APP, and n = 7 PS-1/APP transgenic animals. Sensory perception of the shock used in fear conditioning was determined through shock threshold assessment. A sequence of single foot shocks was delivered to animals placed on the same electrified grid used for fear conditioning. Initially, a 0.1-mV shock was delivered for 1 s, and the animals' behavior was evaluated for flinching, jumping, and vocalization. At 30-s intervals the shock intensity was increase by 0.1 mV up to 0.7 mV and then returned to 0 mV in 0.1-mV increments at 30-s intervals. Threshold to vocalization, flinching, and then jumping was quantified for each animal by averaging the shock intensity at which each animal manifested a behavioral response to the foot shock: 9 months, n = 11 control animals, n = 6 PS-1, n = 4 APP, and n = 5 PS-1/APP transgenic animals. First, with a two-pairing paradigm of cue and mild foot shock, animals were placed in the fear conditioning apparatus for a total of 7 min. Animals were left free to explore for 3 min, and then a 30-s acoustic-conditioned stimulus (CS; white noise, 80 dB) was delivered. At the end of the CS, a 2-s shock unconditioned stimulus (US; 0.5 mA) was applied to the grid floor. The CS-US pairing was delivered again at the 5-min mark. To evaluate contextual fear learning, the animals were returned to the training context 24 h posttraining, and freezing behavior was scored for 5 min. To evaluate cued fear learning, the animals were placed in a different context (novel odor, lighting, cage floor, and visual cues) following contextual testing. Baseline behavior was scored for 3 min, and then the CS was presented for a period of 3 min. Freezing behavior was scored as follows: each animal was observed for ∼1 s every 5 s and judged to be freezing or not by postural criteria. Data is expressed as percent freezing in 30- or 60-s epochs, each epoch divided into 6 or 12 5-s bins. The experimenter was blind to the genotype of the subjects. No less than six animals of each genotype were tested per group. For the five-pairing paradigm, 20-s acoustic CS-US pairings were given five times. There was a 40-s interval between each CS-US pairing. All other aspects of this protocol were the same as in the two-pairing paradigm. To produce mice of the desired genotypes, APP K670N/M671L transgenic mice (7Hsiao K. Chapman P. Nilsen S. Eckman C. Harigaya Y. Younkin S. Yang F. Cole G. Science. 1996; 274: 99-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (3668) Google Scholar) were crossed with PS-1 transgenic mice containing the A246E FAD mutation (11Qian S. Jiang P. Guan X.M. Singh G. Trumbauer M.E., Yu, H. Chen H.Y. Van de Ploeg L.H. Zheng H. Neuron. 1998; 20: 611-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Nomenclature for the transgenic animal lines is as follows: PS-1 refers to animals heterozygous for the PS-1 A246E transgene; APP refers to animals heterozygous for the APP K670N/M671L transgene; and PS-1/APP refers to animals heterozygous for both mutant transgenes. Nontransgenic control animals were littermates generated in the breeding for PS-1/APP transgenic animals. Mice heterozygous for the following genotypes were generated at equal ratios: wild-type, PS-1 or APP single transgenic, and PS-1/APP double transgenic. APP and PS-1/APP mice were subjected to immunohistological analysis at various ages using the anti-human Aβ monoclonal antibody 6E10 to visualize plaques (Fig. 1). We estimate that, with our methodology, we can detect plaques >5 μm in diameter. At all ages examined, both the density and the size of plaques in PS-1/APP mice exceeded that of APP mice at comparable ages. Plaque deposition pattern for PS-1/APP mice was similar to that reported for the APP mice from which they were generated (7Hsiao K. Chapman P. Nilsen S. Eckman C. Harigaya Y. Younkin S. Yang F. Cole G. Science. 1996; 274: 99-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (3668) Google Scholar, 12Frautschy S.A. Yang F. Irrizarry M. Hyman B. Saido T.C. Hsiao K. Cole G.M. Am. J.

Plaques were first observed in cortical regions, followed by hippocampus. Plaques were not detected in any group at five months of age (data not shown). β-amyloid plaques were consistently detected in the neocortex of 7-month-old PS-1/APP transgenic mice when APP transgenic mice were free of plaques (Fig. 1). At nine months of age, although APP transgenic mice exhibit occasional Aβ plaques in the cortex, positive staining cannot be detected in the hippocampus. At this age, however, PS-1/APP transgenic mice show numerous Aβ deposits in various regions of the brain, including neocortex and hippocampus (Fig. 1). Plaque deposits were further enhanced in 13-month-old PS-1/APP mice; multiple brain areas were covered with plaques (Fig. 1). Littermates that express PS-1 A246E alone do not develop detectable amyloid plaques up to 24 months of age, and the wild-type human PS-1 transgene does not facilitate plaque deposition in mice when co-expressed with the mutant APP transgene (data not shown). Having seen differences in Aβ load and deposition rates between the various transgenic animals, we wanted to determine whether there were any cognitive correlates of plaque deposition. Behavioral characterization of non-transgenic control mice and APP, PS-1, or PS-1/APP transgenic mouse lines included the open field test, rotarod test, and an associative learning test, fear conditioning. In addition, each group of mice was subjected to a general health assessment and evaluated for normal sensory processing. As reported in previous studies, the APP and PS-1 animals exhibited no apparent differences in general health from control animals (7Hsiao K. Chapman P. Nilsen S. Eckman C. Harigaya Y. Younkin S.

Similarly, differences in general health between PS-1/APP mice and singly transgenic or control animals were undetectable. PS-1, APP, PS-1/APP, and control mice were monitored in the open field test to evaluate locomotor activity and anxiety-related behavior. Each animal's movements in both the horizontal and vertical planes were recorded and quantified. Open field data can be used to evaluate a mouse's anxiety-related response to being in a novel, well lit, and unsheltered area by calculating the ratio between the amount of time spent in the center of the open field and the total distance traveled during the 30-min observation period. In a brightly lit open area, mice will tend to stay near the walls of the open field rather than enter the center region; more so for highly anxious rodents. Genotype had no significant effect on locomotor activity at any of the ages tested (5 or 9 months of age). One-way ANOVA revealed no significant effect of genotype on total distance traveled, number of vertical rearings, time spent in the center of the grid, or in the center:distance ratio during the 30-min evaluation time (Table I). We conclude from these observations that PS-1, APP, or PS-1/APP animals are not abnormally active in the open field test, nor do they exhibit anomalous anxiety-related behavior.Table ISummary of open field test results5 Months9 MonthsTot. dist.Ver. act.Time in ctr.Ctr.: dist.Tot. dist.Ver. actTime in ctr.Ctr.: dist.Nontransgenic86.66478.90219.130.02771.92540.00176.410.02617.7088.9440.220.00418.0967.1919.530.003PS-165.17408.17205.750.03155.33309.78100.230.0167.64150.1687.960.0105.8671.2727.100.004APP112.40309.53389.330.037114.11276.13211.950.02628.3560.71106.510.00527.7869.7357.240.010PS-1/APP141.69274.45335.300.027116.05476.57222.710.02855.1970.82105.410.00534.6368.0063.570.012For each genotypic group of 5- and 9-month-old animals, total distance traveled (cm × 100), number of vertical rearings, amount of time spent in the center of the observation grid, and center: distance ratio are reported. Values below the mean value represent S.E. Open table in a new tab For each genotypic group of 5- and 9-month-old animals, total distance traveled (cm × 100), number of vertical rearings, amount of time spent in the center of the observation grid, and center: distance ratio are reported. Values below the mean value represent S.E. The motor abilities of PS-1, APP, PS-1/APP, and control mice were probed using the rotarod test. The amount of time an animal can remain on an accelerating rotating wheel is an index of the animal's motor coordination. In addition, it is expected that the animals gain proficiency in the task with increasing trial number, and this is taken as an indication of motor learning. As anticipated, each animal group remained on the rotarod for longer periods of time with increasing trial number over the course of two training days: 5 months,F(7,312) = 7.87, p <0.0001; 9 months, F(7, 296) = 25.08, p <0.0001 (Fig.2). Two-way ANOVA with repeated measures did not detect an interaction between genotype and trial number, demonstrating that all groups of mice learned the task at similar rates. Although the 9-month-old APP and PS-1/APP animals appeared to plateau in their performance at a lower total time spent on the rotarod, this effect was not statistically significant. Overall, these data indicate that PS-1, APP, and PS-1/APP mice are unimpaired in motor coordination and motor learning as compared with control animals. After all other behavioral tests were complete a subset of 9-month-old animals was evaluated for their ability to perceive shock stimuli. The shock threshold to flinch (Fig.3 a), to jump (Fig.3 b), and to vocalize (Fig. 3 c) was quantified for each animal group. One-way ANOVA and Tukey post hoc analysis did not detect any significant differences between any of the genotypes except between the PS-1 transgenic and PS-1/APP transgenic animals in their threshold to vocalize (F(3,22) = 4.11,p < 0.05; Fig. 3). The implications of this difference are unclear. On the whole, transgenic animals do not appear to be impaired in their ability to detect mild foot-shock. Although no differences in baseline motor and sensory behaviors were detected between each genotypic group of mice, we sought to determine whether there might be defects in higher order cognitive function. A well defined cognitive deficit is both a hallmark of human AD and an important component of valid animal models of AD. Thus far, learning and memory impairments described for various transgenic animal models of AD have been detected with behavioral tasks that require multiple days of training and testing (7Hsiao K.

We investigated the use of the fear conditioning associative learning paradigm in our mouse models of AD to potentially develop a rapid cognition assay for application in these systems. Fear conditioning is associative and comes in two forms: one that is hippocampus-dependent (contextual fear learning) and one that is hippocampus-independent (cued fear learning) (16McNish K.A.

We chose this learning paradigm because we can probe cognitive function with a single training day followed in 24 h by tests for contextual and cued fear learning, each requiring just minutes to perform. Most relevant, contextual fear learning is dependent upon a brain area that has been implicated as a locus for cognitive decline in AD, the hippocampus. PS-1, APP, PS-1/AP, and control mice were subjected to a standard fear conditioning paradigm in which the animals learn to associate neutral stimuli with an aversive one. The mice were placed in a novel context (fear conditioning box) and exposed to two pairings of a white noise cue and mild foot shock. Fear learning was assessed 24 h later by measuring freezing behavior in response to representation of the context or of the auditory cue within a completely different context. At 5 months of age, there were no apparent differences in the freezing behavior of the different mouse genotypes during the two-pairing training phase of fear conditioning (Fig.4 a). In the contextual test for fear learning, the APP and PS-1/APP animals exhibited decreased freezing behavior compared with both the control and PS-1 groups (Figs.4 b, 8 a). Two-way ANOVA with repeated measures did not detect a significant interaction between genotype and time spent in the context, demonstrating that time spent in the context did not differentially influence a genotypic group of mice. One-way ANOVA and Tukey post hoc analysis detected a significant difference in freezing behavior at the 1–4-min time epochs compared with controls and at the 1-, 2-, 3-, and 5-min epochs compared with the PS-1 group (Fig.4 b; min 1: F(3,60) = 5.60; min 2:F = 7.68; min 3: F = 8.51; min 4:F = 4.26; min 5: F = 4.35;p < 0.05 all groups). Analysis of total freezing behavior indicates that APP and PS-1/APP animals freeze significantly less than control and PS-1 animals (see Fig. 9 a; Tukey's multiple comparison test: F(5,16) = 27.97; controlversus APP,"

We investigated whether neuronal calcium sensor 1 (NCS-1) may underlie this phenomenon. Direct loading of NCS-1 into the nerve terminal mimicked activity-dependent I pCa facilitation by accelerating the activation time of I pCa in a Ca 2+ -dependent manner. A presynaptically loaded carboxyl-terminal peptide of NCS-1 abolished I pCa facilitation. These results suggest that residual Ca 2+ activates endogenous NCS-1, thereby facilitating I pCa . Because both P/Q-type Ca 2+ channels and NCS-1 are widely expressed in mammalian nerve terminals, NCS-1 may contribute to the activity-dependent synaptic facilitation at many synapses."

Approximately 85% of all cases of ADPKD are caused by mutations in the PKD1 gene, with most (if not all) of the remaining cases being caused by defects in the PKD2 gene. The PKD1 gene product, polycystin-1, appears to be a large membrane-associated glycoprotein (5The European Polycystic Kidney Disease Consortium, Cell 77, 1994, 881–894Google Scholar, 6The American PKD1 Consortium, Hum.

Nephrol. 2001; 12: 834-845Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Polycystin-1 is composed of a large N-terminal extracellular domain of about 3,000 amino acids, a multimembrane spanning domain of about 1,000 amino acids containing 11 transmembrane segments, and a C-terminal cytosolic domain of about 200–225 amino acids. Polycystin-2, the protein product of the PKD2 gene, appears to be a Ca2+-permeable, nonselective cation channel whose activity may be regulated by a direct interaction with the C-terminal cytosolic domain of polycystin-1 (11Gonzalez-Perrett S.

Sequence analysis of polycystin-1 has suggested that the C-terminal cytosolic domain of the protein is involved in protein-protein interactions and signal transduction (15Calvet J.P. J. Nephrol. 1998; 11: 24-34PubMed Google Scholar). Biochemical analyses support this hypothesis, as transient transfection of the C-tail of polycystin-1 modulates Wnt signaling via stabilization of β-catenin (16Kim E. Arnould T. Sellin L.K.

Polycystin signaling has also been implicated in the regulation of a cell growth phenotype, as ADPKD renal epithelial cells are susceptible to abnormal proliferation in response to cAMP (18Yamaguchi T. Pelling J.C. Ramaswamy N.T. Eppler J.W. Wallace D.P. Nagao S. Rome L.A. Sullivan L.P. Grantham J.J.

Furthermore, stable transfection of full-length polycystin-1 in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells suppresses spontaneous cyst formation and inhibits cellular growth rates and apoptosis (21Boletta A. Qian F. Onuchic L.F. Bhunia A.K. Phakdeekitcharoen B. Hanaoka K. Guggino W. Monaco L. Germino G.G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1267-1273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Despite these clues, however, the primary cytosolic events that initiate these signaling cascades have remained unclear. A number of observations have suggested that heterotrimeric G proteins play a role in polycystin-1-mediated signaling. Polycystin-1 has been shown to bind and stabilize RGS7 (regulator of G protein signaling 7) (22Kim E. Arnould T. Sellin L. Benzing T. Comella N. Kocher O. Tsiokas L. Sukhatme V.P. Walz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6371-6376Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), a member of the newly identified family of RGS proteins that are capable of regulating G protein-dependent signaling cascades by accelerating the hydrolysis of GTP bound to Gα subunits of certain heterotrimeric G proteins (23Ross E.M. Wilkie T.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 795-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar). Furthermore, RGS7 has been identified as a candidate for a genetic modifier of bpk, a murine model of PKD that is similar to human autosomal recessive PKD (24Guay-Woodford L.M. Wright C.J. Walz G. Churchill G.A. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2000; 11: 1253-1260PubMed Google Scholar). We have also shown that polycystin-1 binds and activates heterotrimeric Gi/Go proteins in vitro (25Parnell S.C. Magenheimer B.S. Maser R.L. Rankin C.A. Smine A. Okamoto T. Calvet J.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 625-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). However, a direct link between polycystin-1-mediated signaling pathways and heterotrimeric G proteins has not been established. To determine whether heterotrimeric G proteins mediate polycystin-1 signaling, we tested the effects of expression of the Gβγ sequestering constructs, dominant-negative Gαi2 and β-adrenergic receptor kinase C-terminal tail (βARK-ct), on polycystin-mediated JNK activation. The evidence demonstrated that polycystin-1 activates JNK signaling via Gβγ subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins. We also showed that a dominant-negative p115RhoGEF construct inhibited AP-1 activation and that wild-type Gα12 and Gα13 subunits effectively augmented polycystin-1 signaling to AP-1. Gαiand Gαq family subunits were also found to be capable of stimulating polycystin-1 signaling to AP-1 but less effectively than Gα12 family subunits. These results, taken together with our previous in vitro G protein binding and activation studies (25Parnell S.C. Magenheimer B.S. Maser R.L. Rankin C.A. Smine A. Okamoto T. Calvet J.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 625-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), indicate that polycystin-1 can couple with and signal via heterotrimeric G proteins and thus is an atypical heterotrimeric G protein-coupled receptor. The sIg-PKD-MN6 (MN6) construct (obtained from Dr. G. Walz (17Arnould T. Kim E. Tsiokas L. Jochimsen F. Gruning W. Chang J.D. Walz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6013-6018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar)) contains the C-terminal cytosolic tail of human polycystin-1 (amino acids 4077–4241) fused to the membrane targeting cassette, sIg.7 (Fig. 1). The sIg.7 cassette consists of the CD5 signal peptide, the CH2-CH3 domains of human IgG, and the CD7 transmembrane domain. MN6 terminates in the coiled-coil region of polycystin-1. The sIg-PKD222 construct (Fig. 1) was made from a mouse polycystin-1 cDNA (obtained from Dr. G. Germino), which was subcloned downstream of sIg.7 in pcDNA1.1/Amp (Invitrogen) such that it encodes the C-terminal 222 amino acids of polycystin-1 (25Parnell S.C. Magenheimer B.S. Maser R.L. Rankin C.A. Smine A. Okamoto T. Calvet J.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 625-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). For controls, sIg.7 alone was inserted in pcDM12 (a derivative of pcDM8; Invitrogen) (sIg-0-12; control for sIg-PKD-MN6) or pcDNA1.1/Amp (sIg-0-1.1; control for sIg-PKD222). The sIg-PKD1284 polycystin-1 fusion construct (Fig. 1) was made from the 3′ portion of a mouse polycystin-1 cDNA clone (26Lohning C. Nowicka U. Frischauf A.M. Mamm. Genome. 1997; 8: 307-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) encoding amino acid residues 3,010–4,293, which was subcloned downstream of the CD5 signal sequence and the CH2-CH3 IgG domains in pcDNA1.1/Amp (Invitrogen). As a control, a stop codon was introduced in place of amino acid 3092 to create the construct sIg-stop. The HA-JNK1β construct was obtained from Dr. L. E. Heasley; βARK-ct and pRK5 were obtained from Dr. R. J. Lefkowitz; dominant-negative (DN) and wild-type (WT) Gαi2 were obtained from Dr. T. Okamoto; and a vector encoding a GST-Jun-(1–79) was obtained from Dr. J. Pelling. A Myc-tagged DN p115RhoGEF (Lsc-RGS, amino acids 1–283 (27Rumenapp U. Asmus M. Schablowski H. Woznicki M. Han L.

An out-of-frame control plasmid was constructed by cutting and end-filling at the BamHI site just downstream of the Myc tag. EE-tagged Gαi1, Gαi2, Gαi3, Gαq, Gα12, and Gα13 in pcDNA3.1 were obtained from the Guthrie cDNA Resource Center (www.guthrie.org/AboutGuthrie/Research/cDNA). pFR-Luc, pFA2-cJun, pAP-1-Luc, pFC-MEKK, and pBlueScript (pBS) were from Stratagene, and pRL-null was from Promega. Human embryonic kidney 293T cells were maintained in DMEM (1× MOD) with l-glutamine and 1 g/liter glucose (CellGro) with 500 units/liter penicillin and 0.5 mg/liter streptomycin (Sigma) and 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C in 5% CO2 (4.5 g/liter glucose and heat-inactivated serum were used for the endogenous JNK and AP-1 assays). Cells were transfected using a modified calcium phosphate protocol as described previously (28Rogers J.A. Read R.D., Li, J. Peters K.L. Smithgall T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17519-17525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Following the addition of DNA precipitates, cells were then incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 4 h, after which the medium was replaced with serum-free growth medium or with medium containing 0.5% serum. Pertussis toxin (200 ng/ml) was added either 1 h before or 4 h after transfection. Cells were lysed 16 or 24–26 h following transfection. They were then washed in phosphate-buffered saline and scraped into 0.5 ml per T25 flask of Tris/Triton lysis buffer (TLB) (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl, 25 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 2 mm Na2P2O7, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol) plus 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 mmbenzamidine, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol (TLB+). The cells were vortexed 20 s at 4 °C and incubated on ice for 20 min, and the lysates were clarified by centrifugation (14,000 ×g) for 10 min. Supernatants were placed at −80 °C until use. Protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad Detergent Compatible Assay Kit. Protein A/G+-agarose beads (50 μl per reaction; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were washed twice in TLB and once in TLB+ and were suspended in 0.5 ml of TLB+ per 6 reactions plus 0.4 μg per reaction of anti-HA probe F-7 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for assaying HA-JNK1β activity. The beads were rotated at 4 °C for ∼45 min and spun down briefly in a microcentrifuge; the supernatant was decanted, and the beads were resuspended in aliquots of 100 μl/reaction. 200 μg of cellular lysate and TLB+ was added to a final volume of 0.6 ml; the reactions were rotated at 4 °C for 2 h and then washed 3 times in TLB+ and twice in kinase buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 25 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 25 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mmNa3VO4, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol). The beads were then resuspended in 31 μl of kinase buffer containing 1 mm ATP, 8 μg of GST-Jun-(1–79) substrate, and [γ-32P]ATP (3,000 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and were incubated in a room temperature water bath for 5 min. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 20 μl of 2× Laemmli loading buffer and were placed on dry ice until loading. Reactions were boiled 5 min and then loaded and electrophoresed, and fusion protein was detected as described previously (29Parnell S.C. Magenheimer B.S. Maser R.L. Calvet J.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 259: 539-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). 32P incorporation was quantified using a PhosphorImager SI (Molecular Dynamics). Endogenous JNK was assayed with the PathDetect Trans-Reporting System (Stratagene) by following the manufacturer's instructions. Endogenous AP-1 was assayed with the PathDetect Cis-Reporting System (Stratagene), which utilizes a 7× AP-1 reporter. 293T cells were plated 24 h prior to transfection at ∼7.5 × 105 cells per well in 6-well plates. A total of 7 μg of DNA was used for calcium phosphate precipitation, with 3 μg of control or polycystin-1 construct, 1 μg of reporter, 5 ng of RL-null, 100 or 500 ng of Gα construct, 1 μg of DN p115RhoGEF (DN p115), and pBS as the filler. The medium, lacking serum, was changed 3.5–4 h after transfection was begun, and cells were incubated for 24–26 h longer. Cells were lysed in Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega), and 20 μl of lysate were used for the Dual-Luciferase assay (Promega) on an EG & G Berthold 9507 luminometer. Expression of the Gα constructs was confirmed by Western blotting. All Western blots were performed with Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore) using antibodies for βARK-ct (anti-GRK2), Gαi3, Gαq, Gα12, Gα13, p115RhoGEF (anti-9E10 Myc tag), and JNK (anti-JNK1) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; for Gαi1/Gαi2 from Calbiochem; and for EE-tagged Gα subunits from Babco, according to the manufacturer's specifications. Anti-human IgG Western blots were performed as described previously (25Parnell S.C. Magenheimer B.S. Maser R.L. Rankin C.A. Smine A. Okamoto T. Calvet J.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 625-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). For combined chemiluminescence and colorimetric development, membranes were incubated in chemiluminescence buffer and developed with CDP-Star (Amersham Biosciences) according to manufacturer's instructions. Following chemiluminescence, blots were developed with BCIP/NBT (Sigma). Transfection of a human C-terminal cytosolic polycystin-1 construct into 293T cells was shown to activate c-Jun N-terminal kinase (17Arnould T. Kim E. Tsiokas L. Jochimsen F. Gruning W. Chang J.D. Walz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6013-6018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Because JNK is known to be activated by Gβγ subunits (30Coso O.A. Teramoto H. Simonds W.F. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3963-3966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 31Yamauchi J. Kaziro Y. Itoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1957-1965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), 293T cells were cotransfected with cDNAs encoding a C-terminal polycystin-1 fusion protein, HA-JNK1β, and a Gβγ-sequestering construct, the β-adrenergic receptor kinase C-terminal tail (βARK-ct) (32Koch W.J. Hawes B.E. Inglese J. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6193-6197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Following transfection with the human C-tail MN6 construct (see Fig. 1), cells were lysed; HA-JNK1β was immunoprecipitated with an anti-HA antibody, and HA-JNK activity was determined by an immune complex kinase assay. JNK activity in MN6-transfected cells was increased >7-fold over that of control cells transfected with sIg-0 (Fig. 2 A). Cotransfection of βARK-ct reduced JNK activity ∼30% (Fig. 2 A), suggesting that this JNK activation is mediated by Gβγ subunits. Because overexpression of Gα subunits can also sequester Gβγ subunits, 293T cells were cotransfected with cDNAs encoding MN6, HA-JNK1β, and a dominant-negative DN Gαi2 that remains in an inactive, βγ-bound state upon GTP binding (Gαi2G204A) (33Hermouet S. Merendino J.J. Gutkind J.S. Spiegel A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10455-10459Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Cotransfection of increasing amounts of DN Gαi2 decreased JNK activation in a dose-dependent fashion by an average of ∼65% (Fig. 2 B). A similar experiment was carried out using a wild-type (WT) Gαi2 construct. As seen in Fig 2 C, cotransfection of the WT construct inhibited JNK activation to nearly the same degree as the DN construct (∼60% inhibition). The observation that both DN and WT Gαi2 subunits reduce polycystin-mediated JNK activation suggests that they inhibit signaling by sequestering Gβγ subunits. To investigate the effects of these inhibitors on endogenous JNK activity, 293T cells were cotransfected with a murine polycystin-1 C-tail construct, sIg-PKD222 (see Fig. 1), one of the inhibitor constructs, a c-Jun activation domain/GAL4 DNA binding domain fusion protein, and a GAL4 promoter-reporter construct (Fig. 3). Under these conditions, all three constructs completely inhibited endogenous JNK activation, supporting the idea that Gβγ subunits mediate polycystin-1-induced JNK activation from the C-tail constructs. The WT and DN inhibitors utilized in these studies were ineffective in inhibiting either endogenous JNK or HA-JNK1β activated by constitutively active MEKK, a kinase that acts upstream of JNK (34Ramirez M.T. Sah V.P. Zhao X.L. Hunter J.J. Chien K.R. Brown J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14057-14061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), demonstrating the specificity of inhibition by βARK-ct and the DN and WT Gαi2 constructs (data not shown). The results shown in Figs. 2 and 3 suggest that the C-terminal tail of polycystin-1 signals in a constitutive fashion, because the C-tail constructs do not contain extracellular polycystin-1 sequences. Because many GPCRs utilize intracellular loops to initiate signaling, we wanted to determine whether a larger polycystin-1 construct containing all of the putative intra- and extracellular loops would behave in a manner similar to that of the human sIg-PKD-MN6 and the murine sIg-PKD222 constructs. Thus, a cDNA encoding the C-terminal 1,284 amino acids of murine polycystin-1 was fused to the extracellular portion of the sIg.7 membrane targeting cassette (lacking the CD7 transmembrane domain). This construct, sIg-PKD1284 (see Fig. 1), encodes the complete, predicted multimembrane spanning and intra- and extracellular loops of polycystin-1 (8Hughes J. Ward C.J. Peral B. Aspinwall R. Clark K. San Millan J.L. Gamble V. Harris P.C. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 151-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar) and might be expected to function similarly to native polycystin-1. Consistent with observations using the shorter C-terminal tail constructs, sIg-PKD1284 also activated HA-JNK1β. βARK-ct (Fig. 4 A) and DN Gαi2(data not shown) were both effective at blocking JNK activity, reducing this activation ∼65 and ∼35%, respectively. However, in contrast to our observations with the shorter polycystin-1 constructs, WT Gαi2 caused a stimulation in JNK activity, which was more effective at lower amounts of the transfected WT Gαi2(Fig. 4 B). The stimulation of JNK at low concentrations of WT Gαi2 suggested that polycystin-1 may be capable of utilizing Gαi2 for signaling and that the reduced JNK activation at higher concentrations of WT Gαi2 may be due to sequestration of Gβγ by overwhelming amounts of the Gα subunits. Endogenous JNK was also completely inhibited by βARK-ct and DN Gαi2 but showed some stimulation with WT Gαi2 when activated by the sIg-PKD1284 polycystin-1 construct (data not shown). Despite this stimulation of JNK activity by exogenous WT Gαi2, we could only partially block polycystin-induced JNK activation with pertussis toxin. In four experiments in which inhibition was seen, HA-JNK1β activation by the mouse and human C-tail constructs was inhibited from 9 to 43% (mean = 25%). These results suggest that polycystin-induced JNK signaling is only partially mediated by Gi and may therefore involve other G protein families. AP-1 can be activated by a number of signaling pathways, including the JNK pathway (35Wisdom R. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 180-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 36Jochum W. Passegue E.

Chem. 1998; 273: 6013-6018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) had shown that the human polycystin-1 C-tail can activate AP-1 in a JNK- and PKC-dependent fashion. We have seen that the sIg-PKD1284 construct (data not shown), as well as the sIg-PKD222, can activate AP-1 when assayed using a 7× AP-1 promoter. To identify the G protein families that can be activated by polycystin-1, wild-type Gi, Gq, and G12 family α subunits were cotransfected into 293T cells with the sIg-PKD222 construct, and AP-1 was assayed. At 100 ng of transfected Gα construct, Gα12 and Gα13 were found to be quite effective at stimulating polycystin-1-induced AP-1 activity (Fig. 5 A). Gαi1, Gαi2, Gαi3, and Gαq were much less effective compared with Gα12 and Gα13(Fig. 5 A and data not shown). At 500 ng of transfected Gα construct, Gαi1, Gαi2, and Gαi3 were found to be more effective, and Gαq was comparable with Gα12 in stimulating AP-1 (Fig. 5 B and data not shown). To determine the contribution of endogenous Gα12 family subunits to polycystin-induced activation of AP-1, we tested the effect of the dominant-negative inhibitor of Gα12 family subunits, DN p115RhoGEF (DN p115). The DN p115 construct lacks the RhoGEF domain of p115RhoGEF, but contains the RGS domain, and therefore can bind to and inhibit Gα12 and Gα13subunits (27Rumenapp U. Asmus M. Schablowski H.

Fig. 6 shows two representative experiments (left and right) in which AP-1 activity in polycystin-transfected cells was inhibited ∼24 and 38% by the DN p115 construct, confirming that polycystin-induced AP-1 activity is mediated in part by endogenous G12 family heterotrimeric G proteins.Figure 6Inhibition of mouse polycystin-1-induced AP-1 activity by DN p115. Endogenous AP-1 was assayed in 293T cells transfected as described under “Experimental Procedures,” with a total of 7 μg of DNA which included 3 μg of control or polycystin-1 construct, 1 μg of DN p115 or control plasmid, 1 μg of AP-1 reporter, 5 ng of RL-null, and pBS as the filler. Data for two independent experiments, each carried out in triplicate (n = 3), are expressed as direct firefly luciferase activity. AP-1 activity was inhibited by DN p115 ∼24 and ∼38%, representing 42 and 30% drops in fold increase, respectively.Error bars represent S.D. Significant differences between DN p115-inhibited and control samples are indicated by one asterisk (p < 0.05) or two asterisks(p < 0.01), as determined by one-way ANOVA.

Polycystin-1 contains sequence elements found in a number of GPCRs, including a latrophilin/CL-1-like GPCR proteolytic site (40Ponting C.P. Hofmann K. Bork P. Curr.

This GPCR proteolytic site domain has been identified in CIRL-l, a member of a recently identified subfamily of large orphan receptors that contains structural features typical of cell adhesion proteins and GPCRs (41Sugita S.

As determined by the intracellular staining pattern and the release of β-hexosaminidase into the cytosol, apoE4-transfected cells treated with aggregated Aβ1–42 showed a greater tendency toward lysosomal leakage than neo- or apoE3-transfected cells. Aβ1–42 caused significantly greater cell death and more than 2-fold greater DNA fragmentation in apoE4-secreting than in apoE3-secreting or control cells. H2O2 or staurosporine enhanced cell death and apoptosis in apoE4-transfected cells but not in apoE3-transfected cells. A caspase-9 inhibitor abolished the potentiation of Aβ1–42-induced apoptosis by apoE4. Similar results were obtained with conditioned medium from cells secreting apoE3 or apoE4. Cells preincubated for 4 h with a source of apoE3 or apoE4, followed by removal of apoE from the medium and from the cell surface, still exhibited the isoform-specific response to Aβ1–42, indicating that the potentiation of apoptosis required intracellular apoE, presumably in the endosomes or lysosomes. Studies of phospholipid (dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine) bilayer vesicles encapsulating 5-(and-6)-carboxyfluorescein dye showed that apoE4 remodeled and disrupted the phospholipid vesicles to a greater extent than apoE3 or apoE2. In response to Aβ1–42, vesicles containing apoE4 were disrupted to a greater extent than those containing apoE3. These findings are consistent with apoE4 forming a reactive molecular intermediate that avidly binds phospholipid and may insert into the lysosomal membrane, destabilizing it and causing lysosomal leakage and apoptosis in response to Aβ1–42.

Aβ-induced intracellular oxidative stress may be caused by endogenously synthesized or exogenously added Aβ (38Nakagawa T. Zhu H. Morishima N., Li, E., Xu, J. Yankner B.A. Yuan J. Nature. 2000; 403: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (2778) Google Scholar). As a means of reducing toxicity, Aβ is removed from interstitial fluids surrounding central nervous system cells by extracellular proteolysis and receptor-mediated endocytosis and degradation (55Ulery P.G.

Neuron. 1996; 17: 553-565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). Aβ uptake mediated by the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein requires a ligand that can form a complex with Aβ and mediate its internalization (61Yang D.S. Small D.H. Seydel U. Smith J.D. Hallmayer J. Gandy S.E. Martins R.N. Neuroscience. 1999; 90: 1217-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). One such ligand is apoE, which binds to the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein and other members of the low density lipoprotein receptor gene family and is a key protein for transport and redistribution of lipids among cells (62Mahley R.W.

Although lysosomal degradation of Aβ had been considered a mechanism for reducing Aβ toxicity, Aβ1–42 is resistant to degradation by lysosomes (50Burdick D. Kosmoski J. Knauer M.F. Glabe C.G. Brain Res. 1997; 746: 275-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In vitro, the accumulation of Aβ1–42 in lysosomes damages lysosomal membranes, resulting in leakage and ultimately in cell death (51Yang A.J. Chandswangbhuvana D. Margol L. Glabe C.G. J. Neurosci. Res. 1998; 52: 691-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). This finding correlates with the observation that the endosomes and lysosomes in neurons in Alzheimer's disease brains are structurally abnormal, e.g. the number of endosomes and lysosomes is increased 2–8-fold in cells in all areas of the brain that are susceptible to the neuropathologic effects of Alzheimer's disease (52Cataldo A.M. Hamilton D.J. Barnett J.L. Paskevich P.A. Nixon R.A. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 186-199Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we examined the interactions between apoE isoforms and Aβ and assessed the effects of apoE3 and apoE4 on lysosomal stability, cell death, and apoptosis in cultured neuronal cells. We show that apoE4, in concert with Aβ1–42, stimulates lysosomal leakage and potentiates cell death and apoptosis.

Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42 were from Bachem (Torrance, CA). 1,2-Dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) was from Avanti (Alabaster, AL), and 5-(and-6)-carboxyfluorescein (CF) dye was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Αβ1–42 was iodinated with IODO-GEN (Pierce), as described (68Hussain M.M. Maxfield F.R. Más-Oliva J. Tabas I., Ji, Z.-S. Innerarity T.L. Mahley R.W. J. Biol.

Rabbit β-very low density lipoproteins (β-VLDL) were prepared as described (69Ji Z.-S. Brecht W.J. Miranda R.D. Hussain M.M. Innerarity T.L. Mahley R.W. J. Biol.

Anti-apoE serum, staurosporine, caspase-3 inhibitor I (catalog no. 235423) and caspase-9 inhibitor II (catalog no. 218776) were purchased from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). Recombinant human apoE2, apoE3, and apoE4 were expressed inEscherichia coli and purified as described (70Dong L.-M. Wilson C. Wardell M.R. Simmons T. Mahley R.W. Weisgraber K.H. Agard D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22358-22365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The purified apoE was incubated with 2% β-mercaptoethanol at room temperature for 4 h and then dialyzed against 0.1 mphosphate-buffered saline (4 liters × 4 changes, pH 7.4) for 24 h prior to use. Neuro-2a cells were maintained in NB medium (50% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 50% F-12 medium) containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Neuro-2a cells were transfected with apoE3 or apoE4 genomic DNA by the LipofectAMINE method as described (71Huang Y. Liu X.Q. Rall S.C., Jr. Taylor J.M. von Eckardstein A. Assmann G. Mahley R.W. J.

The amount of apoE secreted into the culture medium by transfected cells was measured by immunoblot (71Huang Y. Liu X.Q. Rall S.C., Jr. Taylor J.M. von Eckardstein A. Assmann G. Mahley R.W. J. Biol.

ApoE3- and apoE4-transfected cells secreting 40 or 80 ng of apoE/ml of medium/24 h were chosen for the studies; cells secreting 80 ng of apoE/ml of medium/24 h were used unless otherwise noted. Aβ1–42 or Aβ1–40 (1 mg) was dissolved in 100 μl of dimethyl sulfoxide and diluted in water to 1 ml. Aβ was incubated at 37 °C for 72 h to form aggregates before use (46Behl C. Davis J.B. Lesley R. Schubert D. Cell. 1994; 77: 817-827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1976) Google Scholar, 72Boland K. Behrens M. Choi D. Manias K. Perlmutter D.H. J. Biol.

Biophys. 1993; 303: 474-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (993) Google Scholar). DNA fragmentation of apoptotic cells was determined with Cell Death Detection enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cells were treated with Aβ1–42 or apoE as described, and membrane stability and leakage of lysosomes were measured in the cytosol by Lucifer Yellow release and β-hexosaminidase activity (75Swanson J. Burke E. Silverstein S.C. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 1217-1222Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 76Kaback M.M. Shapiro L.J. Hirsch P. Roy C. Prog. Clin. Biol. Res. 1977; 18: 267-279PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were incubated with Lucifer Yellow (100 μg/ml) overnight, washed three times, and incubated with Aβ1–42 or Aβ1–40 (20 μm) at 37 °C for 24 h. After incubation, the cells were observed by fluorescence (Zeiss) or confocal microscopy (MRC-1024, Bio-Rad) to determine whether Lucifer Yellow had leaked into the cytoplasm from membrane-limited lysosomes. The percentage of cells showing a diffuse fluorescence staining pattern indicative of lysosomal leakage was determined by counting ∼30 cells in each of 15 fields (magnification, ×60) under a fluorescence microscope. In some experiments, cells were grown in 10% NB medium to ∼90% confluence and washed twice with serum-free medium. The cells were incubated with or without Aβ1–42 (20 μm) at 37 °C for 24 h, scraped from the plates, and homogenized with a Kontes homogenizer pestle B (eight strokes). The cytosolic fraction was obtained by ultracentrifugation (51Yang A.J. Chandswangbhuvana D. Margol L. Glabe C.G. J. Neurosci. Res. 1998; 52: 691-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), and the cytosolic β-hexosaminidase activity was measured as described (75Swanson J. Burke E. Silverstein S.C. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 1217-1222Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 76Kaback M.M. Shapiro L.J. Hirsch P. Roy C. Prog. Clin. Biol. Res. 1977; 18: 267-279PubMed Google Scholar). Neo-, apoE3-, and apoE4-transfected Neuro-2a cells were grown to ∼90% confluence, washed once with N2 medium (NB medium plus supplement), and incubated with 125I-Aβ1–42 (20 μm) at 37 °C for 6, 12, or 24 h. The cells were placed on ice, and the culture medium was collected for degradation studies. The cells were washed five times with 0.2% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline and then dissolved in 0.1 n NaOH. The cell association of125I-Aβ was measured with a γ counter. The degradation of Aβ1–42 was determined as described (77Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). DMPC was dissolved in benzene, lyophilized, and resuspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl containing 0.15 m NaCl and 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4. DMPC was sonicated, and CF dye was encapsulated by the DMPC as described (78Lu B. Morrow J.A. Weisgraber K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20775-20781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Briefly, the lyophilized DMPC and CF were mixed to final concentrations of 10 mg/ml and 100 mm, respectively. Small vesicles were prepared by sonicating the DMPC solution at 24 °C for 20 min. The DMPC and the DMPC vesicles containing CF dye were purified by gel filtration on a Superdex 200 column (Amersham Biosciences). The phospholipid concentration of DMPC was measured with an enzymatic colorimetric method (Wako, Richmond, VA). The release of CF dye from the DMPC vesicles was measured with a Hitachi F-2000 spectrofluorometer at excitation and emission settings of 480 and 518 nm, respectively. Fluorescence was recorded after 10 μl of the protein solution (at various concentrations as indicated) was added to a jacketed cuvette containing 500 μl of DMPC solution (60 μm final concentration). All solutions and protein samples were kept at 23.9 °C, the transition temperature for DMPC. Release of fluorescent dye by apoE or Aβ was quantitated and expressed as a percentage of the total amount of dye released by 2% Triton (20 μl), which represented the control (100%), as described (79Weinstein J.N. Klausner R.D. Innerarity T. Ralston E. Blumenthal R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 647: 270-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). To determine whether apoE has isoform-specific effects on Aβ-induced lysosomal leakage, neo-, apoE3-, and apoE4-transfected Neuro-2a cells were incubated first with Lucifer Yellow, a marker of fluid-phase pinocytosis that accumulates in secondary lysosomes (75Swanson J. Burke E. Silverstein S.C. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 1217-1222Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and then with 20 μm Aβ1–42 (or Aβ1–40) for 20 h at 37 °C, and examined by confocal microscopy. As shown in Fig.1, untreated control cells displayed a punctate pattern of fluorescence, revealing small, circumscribed vesicular structures resembling intact lysosomes. No significant lysosomal leakage was observed in untreated apoE3- or apoE4-transfected cells. After treatment with Aβ1–42, however, it was readily apparent that more apoE4-transfected Neuro-2a cells than neo- or apoE3-transfected cells displayed a diffuse intracellular pattern of fluorescence, indicating lysosomal leakage into the cytosol (Fig. 1, arrows). To confirm this finding, we counted the number of cells in multiple fields that showed the diffuse pattern of fluorescence after treatment with Aβ1–42. Lysosomal leakage was seen in only 15% of the neo- and apoE3-transfected cells but in more than 25% of the apoE4-transfected cells (Fig. 2A). ApoE4 also potentiated lysosomal leakage induced by Aβ1–40 (Fig.2A), albeit to a lesser extent than that induced by Aβ1–42. The effects of apoE3 and apoE4 on Aβ1–42-induced lysosomal leakage were also assayed by measuring the lysosomal enzyme β-hexosaminidase in the cytosol (Fig. 2B). Aβ treatment increased cytosolic β-hexosaminidase activity to a significantly greater extent in apoE4-transfected cells than in neo- and apoE3-transfected cells (∼85% versus ∼40 and ∼30%, respectively; p < 0.001). The differences observed for the neo- versus the apoE3-transfected cells treated with Aβ were not statistically significant. Transfected Neuro-2a cells were incubated with 20 μm Aβ1–42 for 18 h at 37 °C, and cell survival was measured with an MTT assay (Fig. 3). Cell survival (as a percentage of control) was significantly lower in apoE4-transfected cells than in neo- or apoE3-transfected cells (48%versus 62 and 70%, respectively; p < 0.05). In all three cell lines, cell death was reduced by pretreatment with Z-VAD, an inhibitor of various caspases (80Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 3), indicating that apoptosis caused a significant portion of the Aβ-induced cell death. To investigate more specifically the differential effects of apoE3 and apoE4 on Aβ-induced apoptosis, we measured DNA fragmentation in neo-, apoE3-, and apoE4-transfected Neuro-2a cells 18 h after the addition of 20 μm Aβ1–42. DNA fragmentation was increased to a much greater extent in apoE4- than in neo- and apoE3-transfected cells (∼250% versus ∼140 and 110%, respectively, of that in Z-VAD-treated control cells) (Fig.4). There was only a trend toward apoE3 being protective; however, the potentiation of Aβ1–42-induced apoptosis by apoE4 was highly significant (p< 0.001)."
https://openalex.org/W2029850319,"The nuclear transcription factors NF-κB/Rel have been shown to function as key regulators of either cell death or survival in neuronal cells. Here, we investigated whether selective activation of diverse NF-κB/Rel family members might lead to distinct effects on neuron viability. In both cultured rat cerebellar granule cells and mouse hippocampal slices, we examined NF-κB/Rel activation induced by two opposing modulators of cell viability: 1) interleukin-1β (IL-1β), which promotes neuron survival and 2) glutamate, which can elicit toxicity. IL-1β produced a prolonged stimulation of NF-κB/Rel factors by inducing both IκBα and IκBβ degradation. Glutamate produced a delayed and transient activation of NF-κB/Rel, which was associated with a brief loss of IκBα. Moreover, IL-1β activated the p50, p65, and c-Rel subunits of NF-κB/Rel, whereas glutamate activated only the p50 and p65 proteins. The inhibition of NF-κB/Rel protein expression by antisense oligonucleotides in cerebellar granule cells showed that p65 was involved in glutamate-mediated cell death, whereas c-Rel was essential for IL-1β-preserved cell survival. Furthermore, the depletion of c-Rel in cultured neurons as well as in the hippocampus from the c-Rel−/− mouse converted the IL-1β effect into toxicity. These findings suggest that, within a single neuron, the balance between cell death and survival in response to external stimuli may rely on the activation of distinct NF-κB/Rel proteins.

These findings suggest that, within a single neuron, the balance between cell death and survival in response to external stimuli may rely on the activation of distinct NF-κB/Rel proteins. The transcription factors NF-κB/Rel play a key role in regulating a diverse array of genes involved in cell growth, differentiation, and adaptive responses to environmental factors that are cell- and stimulus-specific (1Liou H.-C. Baltimore D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 477-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). In the central nervous system, NF-κB/Rel proteins are ubiquitously expressed in neurons and glia (2Kaltschmidt B. Baeuerle P.A. Kaltschmidt C. Mol.

Whether NF-κB/Rel participates in a neurodegenerative program or otherwise in a neuroprotective process by increasing neuronal resistance to various noxae is still debated. Although many studies support the anti-apoptotic effects of NF-κB/Rel in cultured neurons (12Lezoualc'h F. Sagara Y. Holsboer F. Behl C. J.

For example, some studies showed that NF-κB/Rel mediates the neuroprotection elicited by the tumor necrosis factor in hippocampal cells (16Mattson M.P. Goodman Y. Luo H., Fu, W. Furukawa K. J. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 49: 681-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar, 17Tamatani M. Che Y.H. Matsuzaki H. Ogawa S. Okado H. Miyake S. Mizuno T. Tohyama M. J. Biol.

Other studies demonstrated that the activation of NF-κB/Rel triggers neuronal degeneration after cerebral ischemia (6Clemens J.A. Stephenson D.T. Smalstig E.B. Dixon E.P. Little S.P.

Neurosci. 1999; 19: 4023-4033Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).NF-κB/Rel proteins are a family of transcription factors composed of several members, including p50, p52, p65/RelA, RelB, and c-Rel, that form homo- and heterodimers capable of transmitting receptor signals to the nucleus (3O'Neill L.A.J. Kaltschmidt C. Trends Neurosci. 1997; 20: 252-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar, 22Gosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4570) Google Scholar). In resting cells, NF-κB/Rel factors are retained in the cytoplasm by association with the inhibitory IκB proteins. In stimulated cells, IκB is phosphorylated and degradated, thus allowing the release and nuclear translocation of NF-κB dimers. Recently, a more complex regulation of NF-κB/Rel activation that involves modulatory phosphorylations has been emerging. The phosphorylation of NF-κB/Rel components may operate to optimize their DNA binding and transcriptional activities, as well as functional interaction with coactivators (23Schmitz M.L. Bacher S. Kracht M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 186-190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The diverse phenotypes of different NF-κB/Rel knockout mice suggest that each NF-κB/Rel member serves unique physiological roles in vivo, presumably via the regulation of distinct sets of target genes. Thus, the opposite regulation of neuron survival by NF-κB/Rel may very well depend on the activation of a distinct combination of subunits, resulting in the differential regulation of target genes and the induction of diverse genetic programs that dictate the cell fate (24Perkins N.D. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 1433-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 25Lin S.C. Wortis H.H. Stavnezer J. Mol. Cell.

IL-1β, undetectable in healthy brains, increases after a variety of neuronal insults. It was found to primarily elicit neuroprotection against excitotoxicity at concentrations lower than 13,000 units/ml and exhibits toxicity only when applied for a prolonged period at much higher concentrations (28Strijbos P.J.L.M. Rothwell N.J. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 3468-3474Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, glutamate is widely recognized for its ability to trigger neuronal cell death and to mediate most neurodegenerative events in brain injuries (29Lipton S.A. Rosenberg P.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 1994; 330: 613-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (2521) Google Scholar). We demonstrated here that the opposite effects of IL-1β and glutamate on cell survival rely on the activation of different NF-κB/Rel proteins. Glutamate activation of a p50/p65 dimer promoted cell death, whereas IL-1β activation of p50/c-Rel, in addition to p50/p65, preserved cell survival in both primary neurons and mouse hippocampal slices. Treatment of the cells with p65 antisense reduced glutamate-mediated cell death. The deletion of c-Rel, as in c-Rel-null neurons, made IL-1β as toxic as glutamate. We conclude that within a single neuron the balance between p65 and c-Rel activation may account for the differential modulation of cell survival elicited by glutamate and IL-1β.DISCUSSIONThe common participation of NF-κB/Rel in either cell survival (16Mattson M.P. Goodman Y. Luo H., Fu, W. Furukawa K. J. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 49: 681-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar, 17Tamatani M. Che Y.H. Matsuzaki H. Ogawa S. Okado H. Miyake S. Mizuno T.

Chen R.-W. Wang Y. Nakai M. Chuang D.-M. Chase T.N. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 4023-4033Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) strongly supports the relevance of this signaling pathway in regulating neuronal vulnerability. The data presented here demonstrate that the activation of distinct NF-κB/Rel proteins can yield an opposite modulation of neuron survival. The nuclear translocation of dimers containing p50 and p65 subunits, as triggered by glutamate, is associated with cell death. Additional activation of the c-Rel subunit, as induced by IL-1β, switches the cell response from death to survival.The study was conducted both on primary cultures of pure cerebellar granule cells and in hippocampal slices from adult mice. In both models, NMDA receptor activation by excitatory amino acids could cause neuronal degeneration (30Pizzi M. Galli P. Consolandi O. Arrighi V. Memo M. Spano P.F. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 586-594PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the IL-1β cytokine preserved cell survival and protected against excitotoxic injury (28Strijbos P.J.L.M. Rothwell N.J. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 3468-3474Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The characterization of NF-κB/Rel activation elicited by the two stimuli revealed significant kinetic differences. Glutamate induced a delayed and transient stimulation of NF-κB/Rel, whereas IL-1β produced a more persistent effect. The transient activation of NF-κB mediated by glutamate correlated with a brief loss of IκBα as described previously in striatal neurons (36Qin Z.-H. Wang Y. Chasea T.N. Mol. Brain Res. 2000; 80: 111-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The sustained translocation of NF-κB/Rel promoted by IL-1β, however, was associated with both IκBα and IκBβ degradation. The difference in NF-κB/Rel activation kinetics by the two stimuli may be partially explained by the diverse features of IκBα and IκBβ. Indeed, because IκBα is a κB-responsive gene, upon NF-κB/Rel stimulation the protein can rapidly recover and accumulate in the cytoplasm via an autoregulatory feedback loop (22Gosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4570) Google Scholar). In addition, the newly synthesized IκBα can shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm, thus operating an active export of NF-κB/Rel proteins from the nucleus through interaction with the nuclear export receptor CRM1 (37Tam W.F. Sen R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7701-7704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). These properties are not shared by IκBβ (37Tam W.F. Sen R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7701-7704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), which is less efficient in exporting nuclear NF-κB/Rel proteins and can allow a persistent activation of the transcription factor (22Gosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4570) Google Scholar).The different kinetics of NF-κB/Rel in response to glutamate and IL-1β were associated with the activation of distinct NF-κB/Rel proteins to form active κB binding dimers. Excitotoxic stimuli mainly activated p50 and p65 subunits, as previously found in the hippocampus from kainate-injected mice (18Yu Z.F. Zhou D. Bruce-Keller A.J. Kindy M.S. Mattson M.P. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 8856-8865Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or in mouse brains exposed to focal ischemia (8Schneider A. Martin-Villalba A. Weih F. Vogel J. Wirth T. Schwaninger M. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 554-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In contrast, IL-1β activated dimers mainly composed of p50, p65, and c-Rel proteins. The complete disappearance of the NF-κB/Rel binding complex in nuclear extracts supershifted with the p50 antibody suggests a common participation of p50 to form both p50/p65 and p50/cRel dimers.To delineate the specific involvement of different NF-κB subunits in mediating cell death or cell survival, we treated primary neuronal cultures with antisense oligonucleotides directed to p65 or c-Rel proteins. The antisense technique was successfully applied to demonstrate specific NF-κB/Rel regulation of proinflammatory mediators in peripheral cells (26Roshak A.K. Jackson J.R. McGough K. Chabot-Fletcher M. Mochan E. Marshall L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31496-31501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). We found a differential role of p65 and c-Rel in modulating neuronal survival. Antisense to p65 completely reversed glutamate-mediated cell death. Antisense to c-Rel showed no effect on glutamate injury but did convert IL-1β neuroprotection into toxicity. The functional balance between c-Rel and p65 in IL-1β-promoting cell survival was further supported by experiments on hippocampal slices from c-Rel−/− mice. The lack of the c-Rel subunit did not compromise either p65 activation by both stimuli or NMDA-mediated toxicity. Conversely, the knockout of the c-Rel protein made hippocampal neurons become vulnerable to IL-1β. Thus, by specifically targeting the p65 or the c-Rel subunit, the opposite regulation elicited by NF-κB/Rel on cell survival of mature neurons was unmasked. Dimers mainly composed of p50 and p65 can mediate neuronal death. The inclusion of c-Rel in a dimer combination switches the NF-κB/Rel effect into neuroprotection. Consistent with this proposal, c-Rel overexpression mediates cell viability and reproduces the anti-apoptotic response of the nerve growth factor in sympathetic neurons (14Maggirwar S.B. Sarmiere P.D. Dewhurst S. Freeman R.S. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 10356-10365Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or of insulin-like growth factor-1 in immortalized hippocampal cells and in cerebellar granule cells (38Heck S. Lezoualc'h F. Engert S. Behl C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9828-9835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Finally, the common participation of p50 in both cell death and cell survival dimers might account for the opposing results reported on neuron vulnerability in p50 knockout mice (8Schneider A. Martin-Villalba A. Weih F. Vogel J. Wirth T. Schwaninger M. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 554-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 18Yu Z.F. Zhou D. Bruce-Keller A.J. Kindy M.S. Mattson M.P. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 8856-8865Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).To our knowledge, these data provide the first direct evidence for a dual role for NF-κB/Rel proteins as either cell death- or cell survival-promoting factors within a single neuron. Moreover, they demonstrate that the activation of distinct NF-κB/Rel proteins can be a functional “end point,” dictating neuronal cell death or survival in response to external stimuli.These findings raise and leave unanswered many general questions. The mechanisms by which glutamate and IL-1β regulate specific NF-κB/Rel dimers remain elusive, as well as the mechanism by which they differently regulate the breakdown of IκBs. Here, we report that the calcium-permeable NMDA receptor channel can only engage in IκBα degradation. This can presumably occur via activation of the canonical IKKα·IKKβ·IKKγ complex as well as by activation of more cell type- and stimulus-specific IκB kinases (39Israël A. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 129-133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). A recent study that investigated the NMDA receptor-mediated activation of NF-κB in striatal neurons likewise reported a selective degradation of IκBα (36Qin Z.-H. Wang Y. Chasea T.N. Mol. Brain Res. 2000; 80: 111-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Because the participation of proteasomes in NMDA-mediated IκBα degradation appeared negligible, the existence of an alternative signaling pathway was also thought to contribute to NF-κB induction in neurons exposed to excitotoxic stimuli (36Qin Z.-H. Wang Y. Chasea T.N. Mol. Brain Res. 2000; 80: 111-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Based on structural information, it has been shown that IκBα and IκBβ differentially associate with homo-and heterodimers containing c-Rel and p65 (22Gosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4570) Google Scholar, 40Phelps C.B. Sengchanthalangsy L.L. Huxford T. Ghosh G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29840-29846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), although to date most of the divergence appears in their capability to respond to incoming signals and to dictate the timing of the onset and duration of the response (22Gosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4570) Google Scholar, 37Tam W.F. Sen R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7701-7704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that IL-1β, by activating different signal transduction pathways from NMDA receptors such as the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT pathway, may engage the activation of different IKK complexes that trigger both IκBα and IκBβ degradation (22Gosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4570) Google Scholar, 39Israël A. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 129-133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar) in addition to direct NF-κB/Rel subunit phosphorylation and transactivation (23Schmitz M.L. Bacher S. Kracht M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 186-190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 41Sizemore N. Lerner N. Dombrowski N. Sakurai H. Stark G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3863-3869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Identifying specific IKK complexes that associate with each type of receptor, together with all IKK molecular targets, will help clarify the issue of NF-κB/Rel subunit specificity.How specific NF-κB proteins might exert opposing regulation of neuron survival is another topic of primary importance. Indeed, in conjunction with the selective activation of NF-κB/Rel complexes, other regulatory mechanisms may contribute to the specificity of the NF-κB/Rel response. NF-κB/Rel proteins can cooperate with a large number of heterologous transcription factors to either enhance (such as with the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein β, SP1, and members of Fos/Jun family) or repress (such as with Egr1) NF-κB-mediated transactivation (24Perkins N.D. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 1433-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 42Chapman N.R. Perkins N.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4719-4725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In addition, the NF-κB function may be modulated through interaction with non-DNA binding transcriptional co-activators, such as the p300/CREB-binding protein, or through phosphorylation of NF-κB subunits achieved by signaling pathways that modulate transcription activities (23Schmitz M.L. Bacher S. Kracht M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 186-190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 24Perkins N.D. Int. J. Biochem.

Chem. 2002; 277: 3863-3869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). All these regulatory mechanisms may integrate NF-κB/Rel activation with other signaling molecules, thus adding selectivity and specificity to cell response. It is not known whether and which of these mechanisms operate in neurons exposed to glutamate or IL-1β.Among the κB-responsive genes possibly involved in the control of neuronal cell death, various pro-apoptotic genes such as p53, c -Myc, or the Fas ligand and its receptor (FAS/CD95) genes are activated upon excitotoxic stimulation (4Grilli M. Memo M. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 22-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 8Schneider A. Martin-Villalba A. Weih F. Vogel J. Wirth T. Schwaninger M. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 554-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 21Qin Z.H. Chen R.-W. Wang Y. Nakai M. Chuang D.-M. Chase T.N. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 4023-4033Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and might mediate NF-κB/Rel-induced cell death in neurons. On the other hand, other NF-κB/Rel target genes endowed with anti-apoptotic function might be involved in NF-κB-promoted neuron survival. These include the manganese superoxide dismutase (16Mattson M.P. Goodman Y. Luo H., Fu, W. Furukawa K. J. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 49: 681-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar), which is responsive to IL-1β in insulin-producing cells (43Darville M.I. Ho Y.S. Eizirik D.L. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 153-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), the calcium-binding protein calbindin (44Cheng B. Christakos S. Mattson M.P. Neuron. 1994; 12: 139-153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar), members of the inhibitors of apoptosis (IAP) family (45Stehlik C. de Martin R. Kumabashiri I. Schmid J.A. Binder B.R. Lipp J. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar), and Bcl-xL and Bfl-1, two members of Bcl2 family acting at the mitochondrial level (46Chen C. Edelstein L.C. Gélinas C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2687-2695Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar, 47Grumont R.J. Rourke I.J. Gerondakis S.

Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2656-2664PubMed Google Scholar) or Bcl-xL and Bfl-1 (46Chen C. Edelstein L.C. Gélinas C. Mol. Cell.

Edelstein L.C. Chen C. Bash J. Gelinas C. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 382-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar) were found to be direct transcriptional targets of the c-Rel protein. Most of this evidence has been obtained in non-neuronal cells. However, a recent study also suggests that in the hippocampus, p50/c-Rel activation after hypoxia is associated with Bcl-xLexpression. In that situation, hippocampal neurons display higher cell resistance to hypoxia when compared with basal forebrain neurons, wherein only p50/p50 and p50/p65 dimers are activated (51Qiu J. Grafe M.R. Schmura S.M. Glasgow J.N. Kent T.A. Rassin D.K. Perez- Polo J.R. J. Neurosci. Res. 2001; 64: 223-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Thus, the possibility that these groups of genes may be differentially involved in the opposing modulation of neuron survival by glutamate and IL-1β is intriguing and deserves further investigation. Understanding how distinct NF-κB/Rel dimers can differently switch on arrays of cell death or cell survival genes by acting individually or cooperatively with other transcriptional factors might have a relevant implication for intervention in neurodegenerative diseases. The transcription factors NF-κB/Rel play a key role in regulating a diverse array of genes involved in cell growth, differentiation, and adaptive responses to environmental factors that are cell- and stimulus-specific (1Liou H.-C. Baltimore D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 477-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). In the central nervous system, NF-κB/Rel proteins are ubiquitously expressed in neurons and glia (2Kaltschmidt B. Baeuerle P.A. Kaltschmidt C. Mol. Aspects Med. 1993; 14: 171-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 3O'Neill L.A.J. Kaltschmidt C. Trends Neurosci. 1997; 20: 252-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar) where, in addition to regulating physiological processes, they participate in pathological events associated with neurodegeneration (3O'Neill L.A.J.

https://openalex.org/W2031565865,"We have isolated a novel protein based on its association with Drosophila APP-like protein (APPL), a homolog of the β-amyloid precursor protein (APP) that is implicated in Alzheimer's disease. This novelAPPL-interactingprotein 1 (APLIP1) contains a Src homology 3 domain and a phosphotyrosine interaction domain and is expressed abundantly in neural tissues. The phosphotyrosine interaction domain of APLIP1 interacts with a sequence containing GYENPTY in the cytoplasmic domain of APPL. APLIP1 is highly homologous to the carboxyl-terminal halves of mammalian c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK)-interacting protein 1b (JIP1b) and 2 (JIP2), which also contain Src homology 3 and phosphotyrosine interaction domains. The similarity of APLIP1 to JIP1b and JIP2 includes interaction with component(s) of the JNK signaling pathway and with the motor protein kinesin and the formation of homo-oligomers. JIP1b interacts strongly with the cytoplasmic domain of APP (APPcyt), as APLIP1 does with APPL, but the interaction of JIP2 with APPcyt is weak. Overexpression of JIP1b slightly enhances the JNK-dependent threonine phosphorylation of APP in cultured cells, but that of JIP2 suppresses it. These observations suggest that the interactions of APP family proteins with APLIP1, JIP1b, and JIP2 are conserved and play important roles in the metabolism and/or the function of APPs including the regulation of APP phosphorylation by JNK. Analysis of APP family proteins and their associated proteins is expected to contribute to understanding the molecular process of neural degeneration in Alzheimer's disease.

Nature. 1999; 399: A23-A31Crossref PubMed Scopus (1515) Google Scholar). APP belongs to the conserved APP family (APPs), which includes amyloid precursor-like protein 1 and 2 (APLP1 and APLP2) in mammals, APP747 in Xenopus, elAPP in electric ray, APL-1 in Caenorhabditis elegans, and APP-like (APPL) in Drosophila (for review, see Ref. 2Coulson E.J. Paliga K. Beyreuther K. Masters C.L. Neurochem. Int. 2000; 36: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Besides the involvement of APP in the pathogenic process of Alzheimer's disease, APPs are expected to be functionally important because mice lacking all of the APP family genes die in the early postnatal period (3Heber S. Herms J. Gajic V. Hainfellner J. Aguzzi A. Rulicke T. Kretzschmar H. von Koch C. Sisodia S. Tremml P. Lipp H.P. Wolfer D.P. Müller U. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7951-7963Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but the physiological role of APPs has not been analyzed sufficiently in mammal. Except for mammalian APPs, Drosophila APPL is the most characterized (4Rosen D.R. Martin-Morris L. Luo L.Q. White K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2478-2482Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). APPL is expressed abundantly in neural tissue (5Martin-Morris L.E. White K. Development. 1990; 110: 185-195PubMed Google Scholar) and has been associated with synaptic differentiation at the neuromuscular junction (6Torroja L. Packard M. Gorczyca M. White K. Budnik V. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 7793-7803Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). APPL is metabolized in the same manner as mammalian APPs (7Luo L.Q. Martin-Morris L.E. White K. J. Neurosci. 1990; 10: 3849-3861Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and human APP expressed in fly is transported normally in neurons (8Yagi Y. Tomita S. Nakamura M. Suzuki T. Mol. Cell. Biol. Res. Commun. 2000; 4: 43-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the behavioral defect of APPL-null flies is partially rescued by the expression of human APP (9Luo L. Tully T. White K. Neuron. 1992; 9: 595-605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). These facts suggest that the molecular mechanism of metabolism and physiological roles of APPs may be basically conserved among species. Revealing the characteristics of APPs which have been conserved among species may be helpful in understanding the character of APP and the molecular mechanism of the pathogenic process of Alzheimer's disease.

In invertebrates the protein interaction of APPs has been scarcely identified. In this study we identified a novel gene in Drosophila, named APLIP1, which encodes a protein that interacts with the cytoplasmic domain of APPL (APPLcyt). APLIP1 was homologous to mammalian scaffold proteins JIP1b and JIP2, which were implicated in the JNK signaling cascade and/or intracellular transport (22Dickens M. Rogers J.S. Cavanagh J. Raitano A.

They could interact with APPs and in addition shared abundant expression in neural tissue and the properties to bind JNK kinase and kinesin. Moreover, we propose a possible function of mammalian JIP to modulate the phosphorylation of APP. Analysis of this evolutionarily conserved interaction of APPs with APLIP1 and JIP contributes to our knowledge of the mechanism of Alzheimer's disease progression. The yeast two-hybrid screening was executed with the MATCH MAKER two-hybrid system (Clontech) as described (18Tomita S. Ozaki T. Taru H. Oguchi S. Takeda S. Yagi Y. Sakiyama S. Kirino Y. Suzuki T. J.

The pGBT9APPLcyt “bait” plasmid encoding the cytoplasmic domain (amino acids 834–886) of APPL (4Rosen D.R. Martin-Morris L. Luo L.Q. White K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2478-2482Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) and a Drosophila whole adult cDNA library cloned into the vector pACT2 (Clontech) were cotransfected into the yeast HF7c strain. Cotransfectants were grown on a selective medium lacking Trp, Leu, and His and were assayed for their activation of lacZ reporter genes. Positive clones were recloned into Escherichia coli HB101, and their nucleotide sequences were determined. Quantification of the β-galactosidase activity of cotransfectants was executed with a liquid assay using o-nitrophenyl galactopyranoside according to the manufacturer's protocol (Clontech) and was described in Miller units. The cDNA encoding full-length APLIP1 was isolated from a Drosophila embryonic cDNA library (a kind gift from Dr. Ueda) using a radiolabeled probe prepared from a partial fragment of APLIP1 (nucleotides 841–1788). Hybridizations were carried out with a standard procedure (26Sambrook, J., Fritsch, E. F., and Maniatis, T. (1989)Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Ed., Chap. 12, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NYGoogle Scholar). Positive clones were subjected to excision of the pBluescript phagemid from the λZAPII vector using the ExAssist/SOLR system (Stratagene). Mouse clones were isolated by cross-hybridization with a mouse brain cDNA library cloned into the UNIZAP XR phage vector (Stratagene) using an APLIP1 fragment as a probe. The 5′-upstream sequence of mouse JIP2 cDNA was obtained by 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (version 2; Invitrogen) from mouse whole brain total RNA using a reverse primer (5′-CCTTTTCACAGTGGTCCGAG-3′) and a nested PCR reverse primer (5′-TAAGGCCCAGGCCACAGT-3′). The cDNA encoding APPLcyt was produced by RT-PCR using adult total RNA, and the resulting cDNA fragment encoding amino acid positions 834–886 of APPL (4Rosen D.R. Martin-Morris L. Luo L.Q. White K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2478-2482Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) was cloned into pGBT9 (Clontech) at EcoRI/BamHI sites for yeast two-hybrid screening. Various deletions of APPLcyt were produced by PCR and cloned into pGBT9 for two-hybrid analysis: ΔN12 (846–886), ΔN21 (855–886), ΔC25 (834–861), and Δ873–882 (internal 873–882 deletion in APPLcyt 834–886). cDNAs encoding APPLcyt(834–886) and APPLcytΔ873–882 were inserted into a pGEX-4T-1 vector (Amersham Biosciences) at EcoRI/SalI sites to produce GST fusion proteins. The cDNA encoding the full-length APLIP1 protein (APLIP1) and the PCR-produced carboxyl-terminal deletion construct CΔ137 (amino acids 1–353) were cloned into pGAD424 (Clontech) at SmaI/PstI sites. Other various amino-terminal truncated proteins of APLIP1 (NΔ84 (amino acids 85–490), NΔ207 (208–490), NΔ280 (281–490), NΔ330 (331–490), and NΔ387 (388–490)) were also produced by PCR and cloned into pGAD424 (Clontech) at EcoRI/PstI. cDNAs of APLIP1, NΔ207, and CΔ137 were cloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1Myc/HisA (Invitrogen) to produce pcDNA3.1APLIP1Myc/HisA, pcDNA3.1APLIP1-NΔ207Myc/HisA, and pcDNA3.1APLIP1-CΔ137Myc/HisA, respectively; these constructs express proteins tagged with a c-Myc epitope at the carboxyl terminus in mammalian cells. Full-length cDNAs of Drosophila APPL (GenBank J04516),Drosophila JNK (DJNK; GenBank U49249), and Drosophila hemipterous (Hep; GenBank U93032), and a partial cDNA encoding amino acids 162–508 of the Drosophila kinesin light chain (DKLC; GenBank L11013) were obtained by RT-PCR from poly(A)+ RNA of 12–18-h embryos. APPL cDNA was inserted into pcDNA3 at EcoRI/XbaI. Hep and DKLC cDNA were inserted into pcDNA3 at EcoRI/XhoI with a FLAG tag at the amino terminus. DJNK and Hep were cloned into pGEX-4T-1 (AmershamBiosciences) at SmaI/XhoI and EcoRI/XhoI sites, respectively, to produce GST fusion proteins. The constructs pcDNA3APP695 (18Tomita S. Ozaki T.

Full-length cDNAs of JIP1 (GenBank AF054611) and JIP2 (GenBank AF220195) were obtained from mouse brain total RNA by RT-PCR and cloned into pcDNA3 at EcoRI/XbaI and EcoRI/XhoI sites, respectively, with FLAG or hemagglutinin (HA) tags at the their amino termini. The cDNA encoding JIP1a (GenBank AF003115), which is also known as a splicing variant of JIP1 with an internal deletion of amino acids 557–603 in JIP1b (22Dickens M. Rogers J.S. Cavanagh J.

The cDNA encoding dual leucine zipper-bearing kinase (DLK; GenBank NM006301) was obtained from human brain total RNA (Clontech) by RT-PCR and cloned into pcDNA3.1Myc/HisA to express proteins tagged with a c-Myc epitope at the carboxyl terminus. Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from various developmental stages of embryos, larvae, pupae, and adult flies (Canton-S) using a μMACS RNA isolation kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). For Northern blotting, 1 μg of poly(A)+ RNA was loaded onto a 1% (w/v) agarose gel under denatured conditions, electrophoresed, and transferred to a membrane. Radiolabeled probes (>108 cpm/μg DNA) of APLIP1 and ribosomal protein 49 (rp49) were prepared with [α-32P]dCTP (3,000 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and a random primer labeling kit (Roche Diagnostics). Hybridization was carried out using ExpresHyb hybridization solution (Clontech) according to the user's manual, and signals were detected by autoradiography. A cDNA of rp49 (GenBank U92431) was obtained by RT-PCR with adult head poly(A)+RNA. For RT-PCR analysis, poly(A)+ RNA, prepared from adult heads and bodies separated using glass beads and a sieve, were reverse transcribed with SuperScript II (Invitrogen) using an oligo(dT) primer for 2 h at 37 °C and treated with RNase H (Takara). A PCR was performed with Ex-Taq (Takara) using [α-32P]dCTP and primer sets specific for APLIP1 and rp49 as follows: APLIP1, 5′-AATGCGGCTACTTGATG-3′ and 5′-GTGGTGCCGCGGCACAAA-3′; rp49, 5′-AGTCGGATCGATATGCTAAG-3′ and 5′-AGTAAACGCGGTTCTGCATG-3′. The resulting products were electrophoresed on 5% (w/v) acrylamide gels and quantified with a Fuji BAS image analyzer. A digoxigenin-labeled RNA probe was prepared with T7 RNA polymerase (Roche Diagnostics), digoxigenin-11-UTP, and APLIP1 cDNA in pBluescript SKII digested with EcoRI as a template for the antisense probe. Embryos were dechorionated and fixed as described previously (27Yagi Y. Hayashi S. Genes Cells. 1997; 2: 41-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Hybridization was performed with antisense probes and visualized using an anti-digoxigenin antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase and an nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-phosphate substrate (Roche Diagnostics). The rabbit polyclonal anti-APP antibody G369 has been described previously (28Oishi M. Nairn A.C. Czernik A.J. Lim G.S. Isohara T. Gandy S.E. Greengard P. Suzuki T. Mol.

Anti-FLAG (M2; Sigma), anti-HA (12CA5; Roche Diagnostics), and anti-c-Myc (Invitrogen) monoclonal antibodies were purchased. Polyclonal APP phosphorylation state-specific antibody (pAbThr-668) UT-33 was raised against a phosphopeptide APP665–673[Cys][PiThr-668] of APP695 and described previously (12Ando K. Oishi M.

African green monkey kidney COS-7 and mouse neuroblastoma Neuro-2a cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. To express proteins, 5 × 105 ∼1 × 106 COS-7 or ∼1 × 106 Neuro-2a cells were transiently transfected with 0.5–2 μg of each plasmid in LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) or LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol and cultured for 24–48 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. The cells were harvested and lysed in CHAPS lysis buffer (phosphate-buffered saline containing 10 mm CHAPS, 5 μg/ml chymostatin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 1 mm NaF) for 0.5 h at 4 °C. Microcystine-LR (1 μm) was added to the buffer to analyze the phosphorylation. The lysed cells were centrifuged at 12,000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was used for the following analysis. A pGEX-4T-1 cDNA construct was introduced into E. coli BL21, and a GST fusion protein was prepared. The protein was purified with glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) as described (18Tomita S. Ozaki T. Taru H. Oguchi S. Takeda S. Yagi Y. Sakiyama S. Kirino Y. Suzuki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2243-2254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), and the purity of the protein was examined by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 after SDS-PAGE. The purified GST fusion proteins (∼1 nmol) coupled to glutathione-Sepharose 4B were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with cell lysates derived from COS-7 cells transiently expressing the recombinant protein. The beads were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl) three times, and the protein bound to the GST fusion protein was eluted with SDS sample buffer and analyzed by Western blot with ECL (Amersham Biosciences) or125I-protein A (Amersham Biosciences). The supernatant prepared from double transfected COS-7 cells was incubated with 5–10 μg of antibody at 4 °C for 1 h. The resulting immunocomplex bound to mouse antibodies was recovered using protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) and analyzed by Western blot with the antibody indicated. APPs are thought to function through interaction of their cytoplasmic domains with cytoplasmic proteins. Therefore, we screened a Drosophila adult cDNA library with the yeast two-hybrid system using APPLcyt as bait and obtained clones encoding part of a novel protein. The full-length cDNA was isolated from an embryonic cDNA library by plaque hybridization using partial cDNA as a probe. The full-length cDNA obtained encoded a protein consisting of 490 amino acids and containing putative SH3 and PI domains in its carboxyl-terminal half (Fig. 1, A and B). We called this novel protein APLIP1, for APP-like proteininteracting protein 1. From an analysis of the Drosophila genomic data base (32Celera Genomics, Inc. Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project teamScience. 2000; 287: 2185-2195Crossref PubMed Scopus (4744) Google Scholar), the APLIP1 gene was revealed to be composed of five exons and to be located on region 61F1–61F4 of chromosome 3L. No other gene resembling APLIP1 was found in the data base. In this two-hybrid screening, a cDNA encoding the carboxyl-terminal fragment of the Drosophila homolog of X11L (dX11L) (GenBank AF208839) 2M. Hase, Y. Yagi, H. Taru, S. Tomita, A. Sumioka, K. Hori, Y. Miyamoto, T. Sasamura, M. Nakamura, K. Matsuno, and T. Suzuki, J. Neurochem. (2002) in press. and a putative Ser/Thr protein kinase, Bin4 (GenBank AF096866), were also selected as positive clones. The binding activities of these clones with APPL examined in yeast are comparable with that of APLIP1. 3H. Taru, K. Iijima, M. Hase, Y. Kirino, Y. Yagi, and T. Suzuki, unpublished observation. APPL is expressed specifically in neural tissues during development (4Rosen D.R. Martin-Morris L. Luo L.Q. White K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2478-2482Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 7Luo L.Q. Martin-Morris L.E. White K. J. Neurosci. 1990; 10: 3849-3861Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). If APLIP1 interacts with the cytoplasmic domain of APPL in vivo, we would expect APLIP1 to be expressed in neural tissues as well. Therefore, we examined the expression profile of APLIP1. Northern blot analysis was performed against poly(A)+ RNA prepared from various developmental stages (Fig. 2 A). A 2.4-kb transcript showed strong expression during late embryonic (12–18 h after egg deposition (E12–18)) to adult stages. No signal could be detected in the lane containing RNA from an E0–6 embryo, and only a weak signal was observed in E6–12 embryos. This expression profile is similar to that of APPL, although expression of APPL is weak in larval stages (4Rosen D.R. Martin-Morris L. Luo L.Q. White K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2478-2482Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Next we examined whether the expression of APLIP1 is enriched in the nervous system. We prepared poly(A)+ RNA from the heads and bodies of adult flies and quantified the amount of transcript of the APLIP1 and rp49 by RT-PCR using specific primer sets (Fig. 2 B). A larger amount of the APLIP1 PCR product was obtained from the heads than from the bodies, whereas comparable amounts of the PCR product derived from the rp49 RNA were observed in the heads and bodies. This result suggests that APLIP1 is expressed largely in neural tissues, as is APPL. The abundant expression of the APLIP1 in the neural tissues was confirmed by in situ hybridization (Fig. 2 C).APLIP1 expression was detected in the brain and central nervous system of late embryos (Fig. 2 C), whereas no signal was observed in early embryos (data not shown). These observations suggest the possibility that APLIP1 interacts with APPL in neural tissues. The APLIP1 protein interacted with APPL in yeast cells. To investigate whether they interact in other systems, we examined protein-protein interactions between APLIP1 and APPL in vitro using a GST fusion protein. A GST-APLIP1 fusion protein was prepared in bacteria, purified, immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose, and incubated with a lysate of COS-7 cells expressing APPL. APPL expressed in COS-7 cells exhibits several bands probably differing in glycosylation. APPL attached to the beads was washed, eluted together with GST-APLIP1, and detected by Western blot analysis using an anti-APPL antibody (Fig. 3 A). APPL bound to the beads coupled with the GST-APLIP1 fusion protein but not to GST alone. We examined the interaction of APLIP1 with APPL in cells (Fig. 3 B). APLIP1 tagged with FLAG epitope (FLAG-APLIP1) was expressed in COS-7 cells together with or without APPL (left panel of Fig. 3 B). The proteins were immunoprecipitated from the cell lysate with an anti-FLAG antibody and analyzed by immunoblot with anti-APPL and anti-FLAG antibodies. We observed that APPL was coimmunoprecipitated from the cell lysate with the FLAG-APLIP1 (middle panel of Fig. 3 B). Conversely, when we immunoprecipitated APPL from the cell lysates with anti-APPL antibody, FLAG-APLIP1 was recovered with APPL (right panel of Fig. 3 B). These results indicate that APLIP1 binds to APPL both in vitro and in the cell. The region required for the interaction between APLIP1 and APPL was determined. The ability of various truncated protein constructs derived from APLIP1 to bind to the APPLcyt was examined using the yeast two-hybrid system. Growth in a selective medium and β-galactosidase activity were analyzed (Fig. 4 A). Proteins that were truncated but still contained the putative SH3 and PI domains in the carboxyl-terminal half (NΔ84, NΔ207, and NΔ280) were able to bind APPLcyt. A transformant harboring a protein lacking the SH3 region (NΔ330) showed no significant difference in β-galactosidase activity compared with the control (mock) but still could grow in the selective medium. However, NΔ387, which lacked the amino-terminal side of the PI domain, and CΔ137, which lacks the carboxyl-terminal region including the PI domain, exhibited neither β-galactosidase activity nor growth in the selective medium. This result suggests that the carboxyl-terminal region containing the PI domain of APLIP1 is essential for binding to APPLcyt and that the SH3 domain may be involved in the preservation of the struct"
https://openalex.org/W2114258015,"The present study examined phosphorylation-dependent cellular localization and the thermoprotective role of heat shock protein (HSP) 25 in hippocampal HiB5 cells. HSP25 was induced and phosphorylated by heat shock (at 43 °C for 3 h). HSP25, which was located in the cytoplasm in the normal condition, translocated into the nucleus after the heat shock. Transfection experiments with hsp27 mutants in which specific serine phosphorylation residues (Ser78and Ser82) were substituted with alanines or aspartic acids showed that phosphorylation of HSP27 is accompanied by its nuclear translocation. Phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) such as p38 MAPK and ERK was markedly increased by the heat shock, and SB203580 (a p38 MAPK kinase inhibitor) and/or PD098059 (a MEK inhibitor) inhibited the phosphorylation of HSP25, indicating that p38 MAPK and ERK are upstream regulators of HSP25 phosphorylation in the heat shock condition. In the absence of heat shock, actin filament stability was not affected by SB203580 and/or PD098059. Heat shock caused disruption of the actin filament and cell death when phosphorylation of HSP25 was inhibited by SB203580 and/or PD098059. In addition, actin filament was more stable in Asp78,82-hsp27 (mimics the phosphorylated form) transfected HiB5 cells than in the normal and Ala78,82-hsp27 (nonphosphorylative form) transfected cells. In accordance with actin filament stability, the survival rate against the heat shock increased markedly in Asp15,78,82-hsp27 expressing HiB5 cells but decreased in Ala15,78,82-hsp27 expressing cells. These results support the idea that phosphorylation of HSP25 is critical for the maintenance of actin filament and enhancement of thermoresistance. Interestingly, HSP25 was dephosphorylated and returned to cytoplasm in a recovery time-dependent manner. This phenomenon was accompanied by an increment of apoptotic cell death as determined by nuclear and DNA fragmentation and fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis. These results suggest that nuclear-translocated HSP25 might function to protect nuclear structure, thereby preventing apoptotic cell death.

Temperature upshifts and a number of other stress conditions result in rapid production of important families of proteins called heat shock proteins (HSPs). 1The abbreviations used are: HSPheat shock proteinMAPKmitogen-activated protein kinaseMAPKAPMAPK-activated proteinERKextracellular signal-regulated kinaseD-PBSDulbecco's phosphate-buffered salineFITCfluorescein isothiocyanateTRITCtetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanateJNKc-Jun N-terminal kinase, SAPK, stress-activated protein kinaseDAPI4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole These families of proteins (HSP110, HSP90, HSP70, HSP60, and small HSP) are known to function as molecular chaperones that help other proteins to adopt a biologically active conformation (1Schwarz E. Lilie H. Rudolph R. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1996; 377: 411-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). HSPs interact with nascent proteins that are not fully modified to maintain their folding/unfolding status and to regulate appropriate cellular compartmentalization. HSPs also recognize and bind to other proteins that are in a non-native conformation because of protein-denaturing environmental stress. HSPs either minimize aggregation of non-native proteins or target damaged proteins for hydrolysis and removal from the cell (2Feder M.E. Hofmann G.E. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1999; 61: 243-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (3192) Google Scholar). heat shock protein mitogen-activated protein kinase MAPK-activated protein extracellular signal-regulated kinase Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline fluorescein isothiocyanate tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate c-Jun N-terminal kinase, SAPK, stress-activated protein kinase 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole Among these HSP families, little is known about the small HSPs because of their wide range of molecular masses from 15 to 40 kDa and lower amino acid sequence homology. However, all members of small HSPs share a conserved C-terminal α-crystalline domain, which is responsible for conferring their native structure (3Plesofsky-Vig N. Vig J. Brambl R. J. Mol. Evol. 1992; 35: 537-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). HSP25 is a mammalian homologue of the small HSP family and is also induced by various kinds of cellular stresses. Its expression is mainly regulated at the transcriptional level; it is induced upon binding of pre-existing heat shock transcription factors to the conserved heat shock elements (4Frohli E. Aoyama A. Klemenz R. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 128: 273-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). HSP25 is also regulated by post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, deamidation, and acylation (5Welch W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3058-3062Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of HSP25 is catalyzed by MAPKAP kinase 2, a serine protein kinase, in a stress-dependent manner (6Stokoe D. Engel K. Campbell D.G. Cohen P. Gaestel M. FEBS Lett. 1992; 313: 307-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). However, the influence of the HSP25 phosphorylation on cellular stress responses such as thermoresistance is still controversial and not clearly defined (7Knauf U. Jakob U. Engel K. Buchner J.

Biol. 1995; 15: 505-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). HSP25 has a wide variety of different and seemingly unrelated cellular functions ranging from a molecular chaperone to a mediator of thermoresistance and chemoresistance (9Jakob U. Gaestel M. Engel K. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1517-1520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,10Landry J. Chretien P. Lambert H. Hickey E. Weber L.A. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 7-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). It also inhibits actin polymerization, regulates apoptosis, and protects ribonucleic acids (11Huot J. Roy Y. Lambert H. Chestien P. Landry J. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 5245-5252PubMed Google Scholar, 12Miron T. Vancompernolle K. Vandekerckhove J. Wilchek M. Geiger B. J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 16510-16514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). However, the functional roles and regulatory mechanisms of HSP25 remain largely unknown. Hippocampus is a brain region most vulnerable to a variety of environmental stresses; various forms of stress lead to hippocampal cell damage and eventually cell death (14Tan S. Wood M. Maher P. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 15McEwen B.S. Front. Neuroendocrinol. 1999; 20: 40-79Crossref Scopus (205) Google Scholar). However, little is known about protective roles of HSPs in the hippocampus. In the present study, we attempted to elucidate the thermoprotective function of HSP25 in hippocampal HiB5 cells (16Renfranz P.J. Cunningham M.G. McKay R.D.G. Cell. 1991; 66: 713-729Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). We examined the signal transduction pathway of HSP25 phosphorylation, phosphorylation-dependent cellular localization, and actin stabilizing activity and the thermoprotective role of HSP25. HiB5 cells (kindly provided by Dr. R.D.G. McKay, National Institutes of Health) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 4 mm glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin, and 10% fetal bovine serum under humidifying atmosphere containing 5% CO2 at 32 °C for proliferation (16Renfranz P.J. Cunningham M.G. McKay R.D.G. Cell. 1991; 66: 713-729Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, 17Kwon Y.K. Mol. Cells. 1997; 7: 320-325PubMed Google Scholar). The medium was changed every 2 days. The photographs were taken under a phase contrast inverted microscope or a fluorescence microscope. For cell counting, HiB5 cells (4 × 104) were replated in 6-well tissue culture plates and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. The cells were harvested at appropriate time points by trypsinization and stained with 0.4% trypan blue. The number of trypan blue-stained dead cells and trypan blue-exclusive viable cells were counted on a hemacytometer. The cells were grown on coverslips until 70% confluence, washed twice with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (D-PBS) and fixed in 2.5% paraformaldehyde. The fixed cells were then treated with 0.3% Triton X-100 in 3% fetal calf serum for 30 min. After washing with D-PBS, the cells were incubated with primary antibody for 1 h, rinsed with D-PBS two times, and treated with FITC- or TRITC-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h in dark. For actin filament staining, the cells were treated with phalloidine-TRITC (1 μm) for 15 min. After washing with D-PBS, the cells were mounted with mounting solution containing 0.1 μm of DAPI. The cell extracts were resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA) in a Bio-Rad Trans-Blot electrophoresis apparatus using Towbin's buffer (25 mmTris, pH 8.3, 192 mm glycine, and 20% (v/v) methanol) (18Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 43350-43354Crossref Scopus (44923) Google Scholar). The blots were blocked in Tris-buffered saline (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-base, and 2 mmMgCl2) containing 0.5% Tween 20 and 3% bovine serum albumin, and incubated with anti-HSP25, HSP70, phosphoserine, phospho-p38 MAPK, phospho-ERK1/2, or phospho-JNK/SAPK antibodies (1:3000) at room temperature for 1 h. The blots were then washed three times with Tris-buffered saline with 0.5% Tween 20. Primary antibody binding was subsequently detected by incubation with secondary antibodies linked to horseradish peroxidase (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA). The blots were then washed four times as described above. Immunoreactive bands were visualized by AmershamBiosciences ECL reagents according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cytosolic and nuclear extracts were prepared by the method described by Andrew and Faller (19Andrew N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2211) Google Scholar) with a minor modification. HiB5 cells in 10 cell culture dishes (100 mm in diameter) were scraped and pooled in cold D-PBS. The cells were pelleted at 2500 rpm for 30 s, resuspended in 1 ml of cold buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors such as 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin), and incubated on ice for 10 min. The swollen cells were homogenized until 90% of cells were lysed (determined with trypan blue staining) and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 20 min. The supernatant was collected and used for cytosolic fraction. The pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of ice cold buffer C (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 0.42 m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors) and stirred for 30 min on ice for high salt extraction. The debris was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 20 min. The supernatant was collected and used for nuclear fraction. The cytosolic and nuclear fractions were dialyzed against modified RIPA buffer (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, 10 mmNa4P2O7, 2 mmNa3VO4, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1% Nonidet P-40). 1 mg of whole cell lysates or nuclear extracts were immunoprecipitated by incubation with anti-HSP25 or anti-phosphoserine antibody for 2 h at 4 °C, and the resulting immunoprecipitates were captured by 10% protein A-Sepharose (AmershamBiosciences) for 2 h. The immunoprecipitates were subsequently washed three times with modified RIPA buffer and subjected to Western blot analysis as described above. Total RNA was isolated by a single step acid-guanidinium-phenol-chloroform method with minor modifications (20Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63187) Google Scholar). 20 μg of the total RNAs were denatured, resolved on a 1.2% formaldehyde denaturing gel, and transferred to Nylon membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). The membrane was prehybridized at 42 °C for 2 h and then hybridized for 16–24 h with32P-labeled hsp25 cDNA probe (kindly provided by Dr. Y. J. Lee, University of Pittsburgh). After autoradiography, the membranes were stripped and rehybridized with 18 S rRNA cDNA probe to ensure that equal amounts have been loaded. HiB5 cells were replated in 12-well plates and grown to 70% confluence. The cells were washed twice with 1× D-PBS, received 800 μl of fresh medium, and were incubated at 32 °C for 10 min. Transfections were carried out by using EffecteneTM reagent procedure with 300 ng of Ala78,82-hsp27, Ala15,78,82-hsp27, Asp78,82-hsp27, or Asp15,78,82-hsp27 plasmids/dish according to the manufacturer's instructions. Stably transfected cell lines were established under 3 μg/ml puromysin for 2 months. DNA fragmentation was analyzed essentially as described by Hockenbery et al. (21Hockenbery D.M. Oltvai Z.N. Yin X.M. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 241-251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3294) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were lysed for 20 min at 4 °C in a medium containing 5 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.4, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 20 mm EDTA. After centrifugation at 20,000 ×g for 15 min, the nucleic acids were extracted with phenol-chloroform, precipitated in ethanol, and analyzed by gel electrophoresis (1.5% agarose). The gel was then incubated for at least 3 h at 37 °C in the presence of 20 μg/ml RNase A and stained with ethidium bromide. Dead floating cells and surviving cells dissociated by trypsinization were collected together by centrifugation at 800 × g. The cells were then fixed with 70% ethanol at 4 °C overnight. The fixed cells were washed with D-PBS and then resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline containing 500 μg/ml RNase A and 40 μg/ml propidium iodide (Sigma). The cells were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min and analyzed for DNA content by Becton Dickinson FACScan (BD immunocytometry systems, San Jose, CA) using LYSYSII software. Haploid cells were considered apoptotic. The data from cell counting and flow cytometric analysis were statistically evaluated using Student's t test or one-way analysis of variance followed by Fisher's least significant difference test for a post-hoc comparison. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. At first, we examined the induction of HSP25 in HiB5 cells in response to heat shock (at 43 °C, for 3 h) by Northern blot and immunoblot hybridizations. The hsp25 mRNA level was up-regulated by 3-fold, and the protein level was up-regulated 5-fold by the heat shock (Fig. 1). Because cellular localization of HSP25 is known to be important for its function (22Arrigo A.P. Suhan J.P. Welch W.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 5059-5071Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar), we examined the cellular localization of HSP25 in HiB5 cells by immunocytochemistry. In the absence of heat shock, HSP25 was mainly located in the cytoplasm, but a large portion of HSP25 was translocated into the nucleus by 3 h of the heat shock (Fig. 2A). On the other hand, HSP70 was evenly located in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus under the normal condition, and its cellular localization was not affected by the heat shock (Fig. 2A). To confirm these findings, we isolated cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions and analyzed by immunoblot analysis with anti-HSP25 and anti-HSP70 antibodies, respectively. The level of HSP25 in the cytoplasmic fraction was much higher than that in the nuclear fraction under the normal condition, which was reversed in the heat shock condition (Fig. 2B). In the case of HSP70, however, the proportion between the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions was not altered by the heat shock (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, nuclear translocation of HSP25 was dependent on the duration of the heat shock (Fig. 2C)Figure 2Cellular localization of HSP25 and HSP70 after 3 h heat shock at 43 °C. HiB5 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C with 5% CO2 and then heat shocked at 43 °C for 3 h. A, three hours after the heat shock (HS), the cells were fixed in 2.5% paraformaldehyde and immunostained with anti-HSP25 antibody followed by FITC (green)-conjugated secondary antibody and anti-HSP70 antibody followed by TRITC (red)-conjugated secondary antibody, respectively. The nucleus was stained with DAPI (1 μm) in blue. B, cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins were prepared and quantified by the Lowry method. The samples (20 μg/lane) were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblot hybridization was performed with anti-HSP25 and anti-HSP70 antibodies, respectively. C, HiB5 cells were heat shocked for 1, 2, and 3 h, then fixed in 2.5% paraformaldehyde, and immunostained with anti-HSP25 antibody followed by FITC (green)-conjugated secondary antibody.

Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 273-279PubMed Google Scholar). However, it is yet controversial whether phosphorylation is crucial for the cellular distribution of HSP25 in HiB5 cells as shown in many different cell lines (24Arrigo A.P. Michel M.R. FEBS Lett. 1991; 282: 152-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 25Lavoie J.N. Gingras-Breton G. Tanguay R.M. Landry J. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1998; 75: 38-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). HSP25 is phosphorylated at two serine residues, and thus we examined the phosphorylation state of HSP25 in the heat shock conditions. We immunoprecipitated nuclear extracts with anti-HSP25 antibody followed by immunoblot analysis with anti-phosphoserine antibody and vice versa. The level of serine-phosphorylated HSP25 in the nucleus was increased profoundly under heat shock conditions (Fig. 3). To further delineate the involvement of HSP25 phosphorylation for its nuclear translocation, we analyzed cellular localization of mutant HSP27s. We used human HSP27, a human homologue of murine HSP25, to distinguish it from the endogenous murine HSP25 in HiB5 cells. Human HSP27 is known to be phosphorylated at three serine residues (Ser15, Ser78, and Ser82), and Ser-78 and Ser-82 are the major phosphorylation sites (27Landry J. Lambert H. Zhou M. Lavoie J.N. Hickay E. Weber L.A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 267: 794-803Google Scholar). We introduced mutations to HSP27 at these two serine residues with alanines (Ala78,82-HSP27, nonphosphorylative form) or aspartic acids (Asp78,82-HSP27, mimics the phosphorylated form) and transiently transfected each to HiB5 cells (Fig. 4A). We then examined cellular localization of the transfected Ala78,82-HSP27 and Asp78,82-HSP27 by immunocytochemistry with anti-HSP27 antibody that has no cross-reactivity with murine HSP25. Ala78,82-HSP27 was located in the cytoplasm even after the heat shock (Fig. 4B). On the contrary, a majority of Asp78,82-HSP27 was constitutively located in the nucleus even in the absence of heat shock (Fig. 4C). These results clearly indicate that phosphorylation of HSP27 at Ser78 and Ser82 is important for its nuclear localization. It has been reported that HSP25 is phosphorylated by MAPKAP kinase 2 in mouse and Chinese hamster cells and that MAPKAP kinase 2 is phosphorylated by members of MAPK (6Stokoe D. Engel K. Campbell D.G. Cohen P. Gaestel M. FEBS Lett. 1992; 313: 307-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar, 28Rouse J. Cohen P. Trigon S. Morange M. Alonso-Llamazares A. Zammanillo D. Hunt T. Nebreda A.R. Cell. 1994; 78: 1027-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1503) Google Scholar). In an attempt to determine which kind of MAPK is involved in the phosphorylation of HSP25 in HiB5 cells in response to heat shock, we examined phosphorylation of three MAPKs: p38 MAPK, JNK/SAPK, and ERK. The phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and ERK was markedly induced by the heat shock, whereas that of JNK/SAPK was not altered (Fig. 5A). To confirm these findings, we inhibited p38 MAPK and ERK signal cascades with their specific inhibitors SB203580 and PD098059, respectively, and examined whether HSP25 is phosphorylated. The heat shock-induced phosphorylation of HSP25 was markedly inhibited by PD098059 but slightly by SB203580 (Fig. 5B). Treatment with SB203580 plus PD098059 clearly blocked the phosphorylation. It appears that p38 MAPK and ERK signal transduction pathways are involved in the phosphorylation of HSP25. One of the major functions of HSP25 is that it binds F-actin and inhibits actin polymerization. It has been known that phosphorylation causes release of the protein from F-actin (29Benndorf R. Hayess K. Ryazantsev S. Wieske M. Behlke J. Lutsch G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20780-20784Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In an attempt to examine whether the phosphorylation-dependent actin binding activity of HSP25 correlates with actin filament stability and thermoprotection, we inhibited phosphorylation with SB203580 and/or PD098059 and examined actin filament stability and cell survival under the heat shock condition. Actin stress fibers were stable both in normal and heat shock conditions. Inhibition of the phosphorylation could not affect actin filament in normal condition. However, actin filament was severely disrupted by heat shock in the SB203580- and/or PD098059-treated groups, suggesting that the phosphorylation of HSP25 is critical for actin filament stability in response to heat shock (Fig. 6). Consistent with actin filament stabilities, the cell death rate (6.9 ± 1.1% in cells treated with vehicle, determined by trypan blue staining) was also not significantly altered by treatment with SB203580 and/or PD098059 in normal condition. Heat shock markedly induced cell death by 3-fold (22.2 ± 5.1% in vehicle-treated cells) without altering the morphology. When the phosphorylation was inhibited, most cells were shrunken to a round form by the heat shock, and 53.8 ± 6.1% of the cells died (Fig. 7). To further delineate the importance of HSP25 phosphorylation on actin filament stability, we examined the effect of heat shock or cytochalasin D, an actin filament disruptor, on cellular morphology in the cells transfected with Ala78,82-hsp27 and Asp78,82-hsp27. Actin filament in control or Asp78,82-hsp27-transfected HiB5 cells was stable despite heat shock; however, a majority of Ala78,82-hsp27-transfected cells showed shrunken morphology with disruption of actin filament. Cytochalasin D disrupted actin filament in the normal and Ala78,82-hsp27 transfected HiB5 cells but not in the Asp78,82-hsp27 transfected cells (Fig. 8). It seems likely then that phosphorylation of HSP27 at Ser78 and Ser82 is essential for the stability of actin filaments. To confirm the importance of HSP27 phosphorylation in thermoresistance, we mutated all three serine phosphorylation sites (Ser15, Ser78, and Ser82) with alanines or aspartic acids and then established two stable HiB5 cell lines (Ala15,78,82-hsp27 and Asp15,78,82-hsp27). In the absence of heat shock, about 5.2 ± 1.3% of the cells died in normal as well as mutant HiB5 cells (Ala15,78,82-hsp27 and Asp15,78,82-hsp27) determined by trypan blue staining (Fig. 9). In the heat shock condition, however, 17.9 ± 1.8%, 30.4 ± 1.5%, and 8.2 ± 1.5% of cells died in normal, Ala15,78,82-hsp27, and Asp15,78,82-hsp27 cells, respectively. These results clearly suggest that HSP27 phosphorylation is important for maintenance of the actin stress fibers in response to heat shock and thus enhances thermoresistance. Finally, we examined cellular level, phosphorylation, and localization of HSP25 during the recovery period. The heat shock-induced rise in HSP25 gradually decreased in time; however, HSP25 was rapidly dephosphorylated to basal level within 6 h (Fig. 10A). During the recovery period, most of the nuclear-translocated HSP25 returned to the cytoplasm gradually and redistributed in the cytoplasm within 9 h (Fig. 10B). Based on recent reports that HSP25 prevents apoptosis (30Bruey J.M. Ducasse C. Bonniaud P. Ravagnan L. Susin S.A. Diaz-Latoud C. Gurbuxani S. Arrigo A.P. Kroemer G. Solary E. Garrido C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 645-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar), we also investigated apoptotic cell death of HiB5 cells in normal, heat shock, and heat shock recovery conditions. DNA contents determined by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis showed that the haploid apoptotic cells were 1.4 ± 0.4% in normal and 1.6 ± 0.2% in heat shock conditions. However, the apoptotic cells increased to 7.3 ± 0.8% at 6 h of recovery, indicating an increment of apoptosis during the recovery period (Fig. 11A). One of the apoptotic cell death markers, DNA fragmentation, occurred during the recovery period at 32 °C but not in normal or heat shock conditions (Fig. 11B). Nuclear fragmentation determined by DAPI staining also supported the above results (Fig. 11C). These results clearly indicate that apoptotic cell death occurred during the recovery period.Figure 11Proportion of apoptotic cell death during recovery period. HiB5 cells were heat shocked at 43 °C for 3 h and recovered at 32 °C permissive temperature for 3, 6, and 9 h. A, apoptic cell death population was examined by flow cytometry. The cells were harvested at each time point indicated, fixed in 70% ethanol, and stained with propidium iodide (50 μg/ml). DNA content was analyzed with fluorescence associated flow cytometry.

In the present study, we show that HSP25 is located mainly in the cytoplasm in the normal condition, but a large portion translocated into the nucleus in response to heat shock in HiB5 hippocampal cells. This nuclear translocation of HSP25 is accompanied by its phosphorylation. Involvement of the phosphorylation of HSP25 in its nuclear translocation is still controversial (8Lavoie J.N. Lambert H. Hickey E. Weber L.A. Landry J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 505-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar, 26van de Klundert F.A. Gijsen M.L. van den Ijssel P.R. Snoeckx L.H. de Jong W.W. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 75: 38-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), but our study with the mutants Ala78,82-hsp27 and Asp78,82-hsp27 clearly shows that phosphorylation at Ser78 and Ser82 is important for its nuclear translocation. HSP27 has three serine phosphorylation sites, and Ser78 and Ser82 are more susceptible for phosphorylation than Ser15 (28Rouse J. Cohen P. Trigon S. Morange M. Alonso-Llamazares A. Zammanillo D. Hunt T. Nebreda A.R. Cell. 1994; 78: 1027-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1503) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is reasonable that phosphorylation at these two sites is sufficient for the nuclear translocation. The phosphorylation of HSP25 is dependent on MAPKAP kinase 2/3, which is phosphorylated and activated by various MAPKs such as p38 MAPK, JNK/SAPK, and ERK in a cell type-specific manner (34Guay J. Lambert H. Gingras-Breton G. Lavoie J.N. Huot J. Landry J. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 357-368Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Huot J. Lambert H. Lavoie J.N. Guimond A. Houle F. Landry J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 416-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 36Clerk A. Michael A. Sugden P.H. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 581-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Among these MAPKs, phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and ERK was increased by heat shock in hippocampal HiB5 cells, and inhibition of their phosphorylation by SB203580 and/or PD098059 reduced the phosphorylation of HSP25. These results clearly indicate that p38 MAPK and ERK are upstream regulators of HSP25 phosphorylation in the heat shock condition. Interestingly, we found that the inhibition of HSP25 phosphorylation resulted in the destruction of actin filaments and shrinkage of HiB5 cells to death in the heat shock condition. In the normal condition, however, SB203580 and/or PD098059 have no effect on morphology and survival of HiB5 cells. These findings further indicate that phosphorylation of HSP25 is important for stability of actin filaments and thermoresistance. Actin filament stability is dependent on polymerization and depolymerization of actin monomers. Actin polymerization/depolymerization is regulated by the concentration of free actin monomers, the number of nucleation sites, GDP-GTP exchange on G-actin, and the affinity of G-actin for the barbed ends (37Hall A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 31-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar, 38Pantaloni D. CarlierM M.F. Cell. 1993; 75: 1007-1014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar, 39Zigmond S.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 66-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). One of the important features of HSP25 is the actin capping activity, thereby inhibiting actin polymerization (12Miron T. Vancompernolle K. Vandekerckhove J. Wilchek M. Geiger B. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 255-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 29Benndorf R. Hayess K. Ryazantsev S. Wieske M. Behlke J. Lutsch G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20780-20784Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of HSP25, however, causes a conformational change leading to its dissociation from the barbed ends of actin filaments. Therefore, phosphorylation of HSP25 could regulate spatial organization of F-actin by freeing the barbed ends of microfilaments for the addition of monomers. Considering the facts mentioned above, it seems likely that the destruction of actin filaments observed after the heat shock and treatments with SB203580 and PD098095 results from inhibition of HSP25 phosphorylation. To confirm the importance of HSP25 phosphorylation on actin filament stability more precisely, we examined the actin filament stability in Ala78,82-hsp27- and Asp78,82-hsp27-transfected HiB5 cells in combination with heat shock or cytochalasin D treatment. Consistent with the results from SB203580- and/or PD098059-treated cells, the majority of Ala78,82-hsp27-expressing cells showed disruption of actin filament, although a significant portion of cells remained actin filament. Phosphorylation of endogenous HSP25 and expression of Asp78,82-hsp27 successfully protected actin filament structure against heat shock. Cytochalasin D, an actin filament disruptor, interacts with both F-actin and G-actin and reduces actin polymerization activities (40Sampath P. Pollard T.D. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1973-1980Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Cytochalasin D disrupted actin filaments in both normal and Ala78,82-HSP27-expressing HiB5 cells, but not in Asp78,82-HSP27-expressing cells (Fig. 8). These results clearly support the idea that phosphorylation of HSP25 is important for the stability of actin filament and enhances thermoresistance against heat shock. In support of the idea mentioned above, Asp15,78,82-hsp27-transfected HiB5 cells are more protective against the heat shock. On the contrary, more cells died by the heat shock in Ala15,78,82-hsp27 transfected cells, because this nonphosphorylative form binds to the barbed end of actin filaments and thus inhibits actin filament polymerization. One of the unique and important findings of our study is the nuclear translocation of HSP25 in response to heat shock accompanied by phosphorylation and redistribution to the cytoplasm with decreased phosphorylation during recovery accompanied by apoptosis. The reasons why HSP25 is translocated into the nucleus and functional role of HSP25 in the nucleus under stress conditions such as heat shock remain unknown. Our result that HSP25 time-dependently relocates into the cytoplasm during the recovery period, however, gives an insight into the functional role of HSP25 in the nucleus. During the recovery period, HiB5 cells underwent apoptosis along with nucleus and DNA fragmentation. Recently, it has been reported that HSP15, a new member of small HSPs, binds to nucleic acids, which is different from the known functions of HSPs such as molecular chaperone or protease activities (41Korber P. Zander T. Herschlag D. Bardwell J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 249-256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). It is then presumed that HSP25 in the nucleus may protect the nucleic acids from heat shock induced-DNA fragmentation. Although there is no direct evidence, the simultaneous events of HSP25 release from the nucleus and nuclear breakdown surmise the idea that HSP25 might protect nuclear lamina and thus prevent nuclear breakdown during the heat shock process. It is well known that apoptosis can occur by oxidative stress (42Ishikawa Y. Satoh T. Enokido Y. Nishio C. Ikeuchi T. Hatanaka H. Brain Res. 1999; 824: 71-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Our preliminary data that increased the level of manganese-superoxide dismutase and dichlorofluoroscein-stained cells (data not shown) by the heat shock may suggest that thermal stress might evoke apoptotic cell death as oxidative stress. Further studies on the mechanism of action are needed. In conclusion, HSP25 is phosphorylated by heat shock via the p38 MAPK and ERK signal transduction pathways. The phosphorylated HSP25 in the cytoplasm protects the actin microfilaments and thus enhances thermoresistance against heat stress. A large portion of the phosphorylated HSP25 translocates into the nucleus, where it may attenuate DNA fragmentation and nuclear breakdown."

We have previously identified a developmentally regulated gene family in Leishmania encoding the amastin surface proteins and showed that stage-specific accumulation of the amastin mRNA is mediated by sequences within the 3′-UTR. Here we identified a 450-nt region within the amastin 3′-UTR that can confer amastigote-specific gene expression by a novel mechanism that increases mRNA translation without an increase in mRNA stability. Remarkably, this 450-nt 3′-UTR element is highly conserved among a large number of Leishmania mRNAs in several Leishmania species. Here we show that several of these mRNAs are differentially expressed in the intracellular amastigote stage of the parasite and that the 450-nt conserved element in their 3′-UTRs is responsible for stage-specific gene regulation. We propose that the 450-nt conserved element, which is unlike any other regulatory element identified thus far, is part of a common mechanism of stage-regulated gene expression in Leishmania that regulates mRNA translation in response to intracellular stresses.

Parasites of the genus Leishmania cause cutaneous, mucocutaneous, and visceral infections affecting ∼400,000 people each year of the 397 million that are at risk worldwide (1Ashford R.W. Desjeux P. de Raadt P. Parasitol. Today. 1996; 8: 104-105Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (337) Google Scholar). During its digenetic life cycle, Leishmania alternates between the alimentary tract of the sand fly vector as an extracellular promastigote and the acidic phagolysosomes of macrophages as an intracellular amastigote. Differentiation of the parasite into the amastigote form is a prerequisite for its intracellular survival. Several environmental factors including acidic pH, elevated temperature, and the harmful phagolysosomal milieu trigger cytodifferentiation accompanied by the differential expression of a variety of genes (2MacFarlane J.

Such stage-specific gene expression is crucial for adaptation because Leishmania differentiates from an extracellular to an intracellular parasite. Gene regulation in Leishmania and related trypanosomatids shares unique features that include polycistronic transcription of large RNA units by an α-amanitin-sensitive RNA polymerase II, probably in the absence of promoter elements, and pre-mRNA processing into monocistronic mRNAs through a post-transcriptional control mediated by trans-splicing and polyadenylation (7Borst P.

The role of 3′-UTRs and/or intercistronic regions in stage-specific gene regulation is further supported by the observation that differential expression of tandemly repeated genes is dependent on sequences present downstream of the different copies, which are often divergent within the same genomic locus (18Brooks D.R.

Sereno D. Tamar S. Papadopoulou B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 110: 345-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). We have now delineated a 450-nt region within the last third of the amastin 3′-UTR that confers stage-specific regulation and showed that this sequence is highly conserved among the 3′-UTRs of a large number of Leishmania mRNAs, several of which are known or shown in this study to be developmentally regulated in the mammalian-living form of the parasite. We show here that the 3′-UTR 450-nt conserved sequence can increase expression from a reporter mRNA in a stage-specific manner. Regulation by this 3′-UTR element does not increase mRNA abundance or stability, a major way of generating stage-specific gene expression in Leishmania and other trypanosomatids (12Aly R. Argaman M.

Our data point to a common mechanism of stage-specific regulation in Leishmania that might be utilized by a number of similarly regulated mRNAs. This is the first example of a common mechanism of stage-specific gene expression in protozoan parasites. Leishmania infantum LEM1317 and Leishmania major Friedlin MHOM/IL/80/FRIEDLIN strains have been described previously (33Lamontagne J. Papadopoulou B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6602-6609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 34Tamar S. Dumas C. Papadopoulou B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 111: 401-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar).Leishmania promastigotes were cultured at pH 7.0 and 25 °C in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and 5 mg/ml hemin. Adapted axenic amastigotes of L. infantum were maintained in MAA/20 medium at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere as described previously (35Sereno D. Lemesre J.L. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1997; 41: 972-976Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). L. major amastigotes were isolated from footpad lesions of infected BALB/c mice as described (36Muyombwe A. Olivier M. Harvie P. Bergeron M.G. Ouellette M. Papadopoulou B. J. Infect. Dis. 1998; 177: 188-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In vitroJ774 murine macrophage infections were done as indicated previously (17Wu Y., El- Fakhry Y. Sereno D. Tamar S. Papadopoulou B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 110: 345-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 37Sereno D. Roy G. Lemesre J.L. Papadopoulou B. Ouellette M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2001; 45: 1168-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The luciferase (LUC) activity of the recombinant parasites was determined as reported previously (38Roy G. Dumas C. Sereno D., Wu, Y. Singh A.K. Tremblay M.J. Ouellette M., M., O. Papadopoulou B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 110: 195-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The mean LUC activity was expressed in relative light units, and it was ranged from 400,000 to 700,000 in Leishmania grown as promastigotes, from 10,000 to 120,000 in axenic amastigotes, and from 500 to 12,000 in intramacrophage amastigotes. These marked differences in LUC activity depending on the medium and on the conditions of parasite growth are probably due to the extracellular acidic pH in which lysed amastigote cells are exposed and to the higher protease activity found in the phagolysosomes of the macrophages. It has been indeed reported that firefly luciferases are highly susceptible to acidic pH and to proteolysis (39Thompson J.F. Geoghegan K.F. Lloyd D.B. Lanzetti A.J. Magyar R.A. Anderson S.M.

The level of infection was also determined by optical microscopy examination following Diff Quick staining of cell preparation. Leishmania chromosomes were separated by clamped homogeneous electric field electrophoresis as described (41Dumas C. Ouellette M. Tovar J. Cunningham M.L. Fairlamb A.H. Tamar S. Olivier M. Papadopoulou B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2590-2598Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Total RNA of Leishmania cells was isolated using the guanidinium isothiocyanate method with TRIzol (Invitrogen). Southern and Northern blot hybridizations were performed following standard procedures (42Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Probes used in Fig. 5were amplified by PCR from L. major Friedlin genomic DNA using the following set of primers: P31_02-5′, 5′-ATGCAGCGCAGAATCAGCTCTA-3′, and P31_02-3′, 5′-AAACCCACTTGCGGGCACGA-3′ for the Lmflchr31_02 gene; P32_14-5′, 5′-GCTGTTGCGTTAGGTGGTGG-3′ and P32_14-3′: 5′-CCACCGCTGTGAAAACCAGA-3′ for the Lmflchr32_14 gene; and AL117263-P1, 5′-ACGCACCTGCAGGCGGTGTCCC-3′ and AL117263-P2, 5′-ACACTGCCCCTTCATCTGCC-3′ for the 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase gene. To prepare soluble protein lysates, Leishmania cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed with Hepes-NaCl, resuspended in lysis buffer (8 m urea, 4% CHAPS, 40 mmTris-base), and sonicated three times for 30 s. The proteins were quantified by the Amido Black 10B (Bio-Rad), and ∼35 μg of total protein extracts were loaded onto a 10% SDS-PAGE. The gels were transferred on a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore) and blocked for 16 h with PBST (phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20, plus 1% gelatin solution). The first antibody, a goat anti-luciferase pAp (Promega) was diluted at 1:2000 in PBST with 1% gelatin and incubated 90 min with agitation. Following a few washes with PBST, a donkey anti-goat horseradish peroxidase conjugate antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) diluted at 1:5000 in PBST with 1% gelatin was added and incubated for 60 min with the membrane. After additional washes, the final reaction was done with a Renaissance kit (New Life Science Products). LUC protein levels were estimated by densitometric analysis using a PhosphorImager with the ImageQuant 3.1 software. Expression vector pSPYNEOαLUC was made as described previously (17Wu Y., El- Fakhry Y. Sereno D. Tamar S. Papadopoulou B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 110: 345-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). To construct vector pSPYNEOαLUC-IR, a 467-bp fragment (IR) containing the last 40 nucleotides of the amastin 3′-UTR with the natural poly(A) site (position 3250) and part of the intercistronic sequence between two amastin copies (see Fig. 1A) was amplified by PCR using Pwo DNA polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and primers IR-5′ (5′-GCTTGCTTTTTGCTTTCTGTCA-3′) and IR-3′ (5′-GCGGCTCGCCAGTGTAGCAGA-3′) and subcloned into pSPYNEOαLUC digested with BamHI and filled in by Klenow fragment. To generate the different LUC-chimeric constructs listed in Fig. 1B, various parts of the 3′-UTR of the L. infantum amastin mRNA amplified by PCR by Pwo DNA polymerase and the following sets of primers (P35, 5′-GAGGAAATGAAGTGAAGGCG-3′ and P37, 5′-GAGGAACGGAGACAATAATG-3′ for amplifying the full-length 3′-UTR; P35 and P40, 5′-TTCCAGGCCTGCAGCGCACG-3′ for the first 415 nt; P35 and P41, 5′-CCTCGTCGTCCCCTCGATCA-3′ for the first 1000 nt; P37 and P44, 5′-GTGGCTGTCTAACTACACTT-3′ for the last 770 nt; P44 and P45, 5′-CCTTGTCTTTGCTCGTCCATTC-3′ for the 347-nt subregion within the 770 nt and primers P42, 5′-TGCGGCACGCACCTACACCA-3′ and P43, 5′-TAGCGGCCCGCCTTGTCTTTG-3′ for the 184-nt subregion) were subcloned into the BamHI site of pSPYNEOαLUC filled in by Klenow. The 467-bp fragment (IR) was introduced into Hin dIII site of the above LUC-chimeric vectors. To construct vectors pSPYNEOαLUC-A2 and pSPYNEOαLUC-A2–309 shown in Fig. 6, the full-length 3′-UTR of the Leishmania donovani A2 mRNA (A2-5′, 5′-GGCTCGGCGTCCGCTTTCCG-3′; A2-3′, 5′-TGCACTTTTCGTTTTTCCCGCA-3′) (23Charest H. Matlashewski G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2975-2984Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) and the 309-nt region within the A2 3′-UTR (A2–309-5′, 5′-GCGGATCCCGGAAGCGTGGCGA-3′, A2–309-3′, 5′-CCGGATCCCACCACGAACAA-3′) that is homologous to the 450-nt region of the amastin 3′-UTR (see Fig. 4) were amplified using Pwo polymerase and the primers indicated above and subcloned downstream of the LUC gene into the BamHI site of vector pSPYNEOαLUC. Vector pSPYNEOαLUC-AC008242 (see Fig. 6) was generated by subcloning the PCR-amplified 394-bp region (Lm-ch27/5′, 5′-AAGCGCGACGAGAGCACCCT-3′, and Lm-ch27/3′, 5′-TCGAACAGGGCCATGCGTAT-3′) part of the SW3.1 L. major transcript showing homology to the 450-nt conserved element in the amastin 3′-UTR (see Fig. 4), into vector pSPYNEOαLUC digested with BamHI and filled in by Klenow. Finally, vector pSPYNEOαLUC-31_02 was constructed by subcloning a PCR-amplified fragment of 433 bp (31_02-5′, 5′-ACGCCAACGAGTTCTCCAGA-3′, and 31_02-3′, 5′-GCACAGCTCACCCCCGCCTC-3′) present in the 3′-UTR of the Lmflchr31_02 mRNA and shown 73% identity with the amastin 450-nt region into pSPYNEOαLUC as indicated above. The 467-bp IR sequence was then introduced downstream of these LUC chimeras as indicated above. 10–20 μg of purified plasmid DNA (Qiagen) was transfected into L. infantum by electroporation as described previously (43Papadopoulou B.

For the majority of the LUC chimeras corresponding to different parts of the amastin 3′-UTR fused to the LUC coding region, polyadenylation started at the amastin mRNA poly(A) site present in the 467-bp amplified IR sequence (see Fig. 1A), as determined by RT-PCR assays (data not shown).Figure 6The conserved 3′-UTR element in several amastigote-specific transcripts confers stage-specific gene regulation. The conserved region within the 3′-UTRs of A2, (309 nt), SW3.1 (394 nt), and the Lmflchr31_02 amastin homolog (433 nt) mRNAs, which is highly homologous to the amastin 450-nt element were subcloned downstream of the LUC reporter gene, transfected into L. infantum, and their role in amastigote-specific gene regulation was evaluated by measuring LUC activity in the transfectants grown under promastigote and axenic amastigote conditions. LUC assays were done in L. infantum, because it is not possible to axenically grow L. major amastigotes. The full-length A2 3′-UTR and the amastin intergenic sequence (IR; see Fig. 1A) were used as controls. 5′- and 3′-end processing of the LUC chimeric mRNAs is as described for Figs. 1 and 2. The results are presented as the relative luciferase fold increase compared with the control transfectant for each growth condition and are the averages of three separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 4Many amastigote-specific transcripts in Leishmania share a highly homologous 450-nt element in their 3′-UTRs.In silico screening using the 770-nt regulatory region of the amastin 3′-UTR as bait depicted a large number of Leishmania sequences displaying a 68–78% identity with the first 450 nucleotides of the 770-nt region. The homologous sequences within the 3′-UTRs of a selected number of amastigote-specific transcripts were aligned using the GCG Pileup program.

The conserved region within the 3′-UTRs of the HSP100 and A2 amastigote-specific mRNAs was smaller than the average size of 450 nt found in a large number of Leishmania mRNAs (this figure and Table I). Nucleotide 1 corresponds to the position 2500 in the amastin mRNA, and nucleotide 454 corresponds to the position 2948 (see Fig. 1A and Ref. 17Wu Y., El- Fakhry Y. Sereno D. Tamar S. Papadopoulou B.

Papadopoulou B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6602-6609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Total RNA was extracted at various time points (0, 1, 3, and 5 h) following actinomycin D treatment. The RNA samples were subjected to Northern blot analysis using the LUC coding region as a probe. The levels of mRNA were normalized by hybridizing the blots with α-tubulin probe. We have recently identified a new developmentally regulated gene family in Leishmania, which shares a significant homology to the amastin surface proteins of T. cruzi and showed that stage-specific regulation of the amastin mRNA is mediated by sequences within the 3′-UTR (17Wu Y., El- Fakhry Y. Sereno D. Tamar S. Papadopoulou B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 110: 345-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). To expand our studies on amastin gene developmental regulation, we made a series of chimeric constructs with regions spanning the 3′-UTR and cloned these sequences downstream of the luciferase reporter gene (LUC) (Fig. 1). To direct accurate 5′ and 3′ processing of the LUC chimeric transcripts, these cassettes were flanked by an upstream α-tubulin intergenic region and by a downstream region of 467 bp including the few last nucleotides of the amastin 3′-UTR with the natural poly(A) site of the amastin transcript followed by the amastin intergenic region (17Wu Y., El- Fakhry Y. Sereno D. Tamar S. Papadopoulou B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 110: 345-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In trypanosomatids, polyadenylation is often directed by trans-splicing signals that are located 100–400 nt downstream of the polyadenylation site (10LeBowitz J.H. Smith H.Q. Rusche L. Beverley S.M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 996-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 11Matthews K.R. Tschudi C. Ullu E. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 491-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 44Vassella E.

Biol. 1994; 14: 3668-3675Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The LUC chimeras were subcloned into a neomycin phosphotransferase (NEO)-expression vector and introduced by electroporation into L. infantum cells (see “Experimental Procedures”). The LUC activity of the stable transfectants was evaluated in promastigotes, axenic amastigotes, and infected murine macrophages in vitro. We have previously shown (17Wu Y., El- Fakhry Y. Sereno D. Tamar S. Papadopoulou B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 110: 345-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and reconfirmed in this study that the full-length 3′-UTR of the amastin mRNA is able to increase LUC activity by 13–17-fold specifically in axenic and intramacrophage amastigotes, respectively (Fig. 1B). Deletion mutagenesis demonstrated that the first 1000 nucleotides of the amastin 3′-UTR are not associated with stage-specific regulation of LUC activity. However, the last 770 nucleotides of the amastin 3′-UTR are shown to induce LUC activity by 13-fold in axenic amastigotes and by 24.5-fold in intramacrophage amastigotes but not in promastigotes (Fig. 1B). Deletions spanning the 770-nt region of the amastin 3′-UTR significantly decreased regulation (Fig. 1B). Indeed, a subregion covering the first 347 nucleotides of the 770-nt region showed a 4–5-fold decrease in LUC activity in comparison with the LUC-770 construct (Fig. 1B). Further deletion within the 347-nt region giving rise to the LUC-184-nt chimeric construct has decreased LUC activity by another 50% (Fig. 1B). Thus, these deletion studies localized the cis-acting regulatory element responsible for stage-specific regulation of the amastin mRNA to a 350–770-nt region at the end of the amastin 3′-UTR. As previously reported for several amastigote-specific transcripts in Leishmania, mRNA abundance is mainly associated to a mechanism controlling mRNA turnover (13Charest H. Zhang W.W. Matlashewski G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17081-17090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 17Wu Y., El- Fakhry Y. Sereno D. Tamar S. Papadopoulou B. Mol. Biochem.

Such an increase in mRNA stability was previously observed with the full-length 3′-UTR of the amastin mRNA (17Wu Y., El- Fakhry Y. Sereno D. Tamar S. Papadopoulou B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 110: 345-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). We have now examined the role of the 770-nt regulatory region of the amastin 3′-UTR in inducing LUC mRNA stability in a stage-specific manner. To our surprise, the accumulation and/or the stability of the LUC -770 mRNA did not increase in the amastigote stage compared with promastigotes (Fig. 2), despite the fact that the 770-nt region is capable of inducing LUC activity by 25-fold specifically in amastigotes (Fig. 1B).

It has been suggested that oxidation of methionine 35 in Aβ has implications for Alzheimer disease, and it has been shown that oxidation of Met-35 significantly inhibits aggregation in vitro. In this study, the aggregational properties of Aβ-(1–40) before and after Met-35 oxidation were investigated using electrospray ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry. The results show that Aβ-(1–40)Met-35(O) trimer and tetramer formation is significantly attenuated as compared with Aβ-(1–40). This suggests that oxidation of Met-35 inhibits a conformational switch in Aβ-(1–40) necessary for trimer but not dimer formation. Random incorporation of Aβ-(1–40) and Aβ-(1–40)Met-35(O) in homo- and heterooligomers could also be observed. This is the first report of an early rate-limiting step in Aβ-(1–40) aggregation. Slowing of the fibrillization process at this early step is likely to support prolonged solubility and clearance of Aβ from brain and may reduce disease progression.

These findings have yet to be extended, eradicating the possibility of a post-mortem delay or a preparatively induced oxidation artifact before in vivo extrapolation can be made. Few studies have explored the consequences of Met-35 oxidation on peptide chemical characteristics or biological actions. There are, however, some intriguing findings and some contradicting reports. Substituting synthetic Aβ1–42 with methionine sulfoxide Met-35(O) results in enhanced Aβ1–42-mediated cellular toxicity (9Pike C.J. Walencewicz-Wasserman A.J. Kosmoski J. Cribbs D.H. Glabe C.G.

Aβ-(1–40)Met-35(O) is dramatically less prone to aggregation and fibril formation as compared with Aβ-(1–40), shown in circular dichroism studies (12Watson A.A. Fairlie D.P. Craik D.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12700-12706Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). This is also reflected by the inhibition of conformational switching of Aβ-(1–40)Met-35(O) from random coil to β-sheet, observed using millimolar peptide concentrations and NMR (12Watson A.A. Fairlie D.P. Craik D.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12700-12706Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The inhibited aggregation can, however, be overcome by increasing the concentration of Aβ-(1–40)Met-35(O). 2A. Westlind-Danielsson, unpublished observations. Using size exclusion chromatography and oxidation of Aβ-(1–40) with H2O2, we have verified the attenuated fibril formation associated with Aβ-(1–40)Met-35(O). However, the structural and conformational changes underlying this phenomenon have not yet been identified. Peptide fibril formation is a complex multistep reaction involving the transitional formation of numerous oligomeric (13Klein W.L. Krafft G.A. Finch C.E. Trends Neurosci. 2001; 24: 219-224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar) and protofibrillar (14Walsh D.M. Lomakin A. Benedek G.B. Condron M.M. Teplow D.B. J. Biol.

Clarification of what steps in the oligomerization cascade underlie the affected aggregation rate of Aβ-(1–40)Met-35(O) would not only increase our understanding of the fibrillization reaction but also our understanding of the forces determining peptide structure and folding. This could in turn be important for understanding the potential toxicities of different Aβ species. This study was aimed at investigating the consequences of Met-35 oxidation on the formation of small Aβ peptide oligomers and also at attempting to find oxidation-mediated rate-limiting steps in the fibrillization cascade of the Met-35(O)-modified Aβ-(1–40) peptide using a Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FTICR) mass spectrometer and a homebuilt electrospray device. Electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectrometry has been used previously to detect and characterize Aβ peptides in vitro (16Chen X.G. Brining S.K. Nguyen V.Q. Yergey A.L. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 817-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) as well as in vivo (17Golde T.E. Eckman C.B. Younkin S.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1502: 172-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Using gentle ESI conditions, small aggregates of Aβ-(1–40) in water can be transferred to the gas phase and detected, making it possible to monitor the aggregation of Aβ-(1–40) over time (16Chen X.G. Brining S.K. Nguyen V.Q. Yergey A.L. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 817-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The oligomer distribution detected by ESI mass spectrometry (16Chen X.G. Brining S.K. Nguyen V.Q. Yergey A.L. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 817-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) is similar to that approached in the short irradiation time limit of photo-induced cross-linking experiments (18Bitan G. Lomakin A. Teplow D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35176-35184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). An advantage in using the high resolving power of a 9.4 T FTICR instrument is that homo- and heterooligomers of Aβ-(1–40) and Aβ-(1–40)Met-35(O) can be resolved. Furthermore, the sensitivity of the technique allows aggregation kinetics to be studied using nano- and micromolar concentrations of Aβ, more closely resembling the in vivo situation (19Sennvik K. Fastbom J. Blomberg M. Wahlund L.O. Winblad B. Benedikz E. Neurosci. Lett. 2000; 278: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Aβ-(1–40) was obtained from Bachem (Bachem AG, Bubendorf, Switzerland). A 4.0 μm Aβ-(1–40) solution was prepared in deionized water/acetic acid 99:1 (v/v), pH ∼3. Immediately after dissolving the peptide, an aliquot was taken out, and 30% (w/w) hydrogen peroxide in water (Merck KGaA) was added to a final concentration of 2.7% (w/w). The experiment was also reproduced using H2O and 2.7% H2O2 solutions in absence of acetic acid. Additional 2.0 μm solutions were prepared in 49.5:49.5:1 deionized water/acetonitrile/acetic acid solution (v/v/v) with and without the addition of hydrogen peroxide to a final concentration of 2.7% (w/w). A homebuilt instrument controlled the direct infusion where helium gas at a pressure of 1.3 bars was used to push the sample through a 30-cm fused silica capillary with an inner diameter of 25 μm. One end of the capillary was lowered into the sample, and the other end, coated by a conductive graphite/polymer layer (20Nilsson S. Wetterhall M. Bergquist J. Nyholm L. Markides K.E. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 2001; 15: 1997-2000Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), was connected to ground, functioning as an electrospray needle. No sheath flow or nebulizing gas was used. The flow rate was ∼40 nl/min. The ion source was coupled to an Analytica atmosphere-vacuum interface (Analytica, Branford, CT). A potential difference of 2.0–3.0 kV was applied across a distance of 3–5 mm between the spraying needle and the inlet capillary. To confirm the formation of Aβ-(1–40)Met-35(O), the peptide was sequenced by collision-induced dissociation (21Hayes R.N. Gross M.L. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 193: 237-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) in the capillary/skimmer region in the ESI atmosphere/vacuum interface by raising the capillary potential from ∼60 to ∼270 V. All mass spectra were acquired using a Bruker Daltonics (Billerica, MA) BioAPEX-94e superconducting, 9.4 T FTICR mass spectrometer (22Palmblad M. Håkansson K. Håkansson P. Feng X. Cooper H.J. Giannakopulos A.E. Green P.S. Derrick P.J. Eur. Mass Spectrom. 2000; 6: 267-275Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar) in broadband mode. Typically, 524,288 data points were acquired, adding a minimum of 128 spectra (∼3 min of acquisition time). Fig. 1 shows regions of superimposed mass spectra of Aβ-(1–40) and Aβ-(1–40)Met-35(O) (methionine sulfoxide) containing monomers, dimers, trimers, and tetramers of Aβ-(1–40) and Aβ-(1–40)Met-35(O). The isotopic peaks of [Aβ-(1–40) + 2H+]2+ and the odd isotopic peaks of [Aβ-(1–40)2 + 4H+]4+were resolved to the baseline as shown in the inset. The isotopic clusters were shifted 16.00 Da per Aβ-(1–40) monomer oxidized. The unoxidized Aβ-(1–40) spectrum was acquired between 41 and 95 min, and the Aβ-(1–40)Met-35(O) spectrum was acquired between 100 and 116 min. The intensities were adjusted to compensate for the different acquisition times. These long times are not necessary but improve the signal-to-background ratio. Similar spectra taken between 20 and 30 min shows less than 1% Aβ-(1–40)Met-35(O) in the unoxidized Aβ-(1–40) sample and less than 1% unoxidized Aβ-(1–40) in the oxidized sample. Putative dehydrated species (−18 Da) were also observed, likely to be the result of aspartimide formation. 3U. Bartenstein, Bachem AG, personal communication. Fig. 2 shows the C-terminal sequence of Aβ-(1–40)Met-35(O) read from a series of quadruply charged b-ions (23Roepstorff P. Fohlman J. Biol. Mass Spectrom. 1984; 11: 601Crossref Scopus (2389) Google Scholar) from the quadruply charged parent ion [Aβ-(1–40)Met-35(O) + 4H+]4+ resulting from collision-induced dissociation in the capillary/skimmer region. The b-ions covering residues 3–40 could be identified in this spectrum, b 1+ and b 2+ being outside the set m/z range. The mass difference between the most intense isotopic peak of b 344+ and the corresponding isotopic peak of b 354+ was found to be 147.0356 Da, within the experimental error of 1.5–2 ppm (24Palmblad M. Wetterhall M. Markides K. Håkansson P. Bergquist J. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 2000; 14: 1029-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) from the theoretical monoisotopic mass of Met(O) (C5H9NO2S) of 147.0354 Da. As a comparison, the mass difference corresponding to a phenylalanine residue (C9H9NO) in this position would be 147.0684 Da. The almost complete sequence coverage demonstrates the ability to identify modifications of Aβ peptides while studying aggregation kinetics using the FTICR mass spectrometer. After dissolving Aβ-(1–40) in H2O or in 2.7% H2O2 in H2O, monomers and dimers of Aβ-(1–40) and Aβ-(1–40)Met-35(O) could be detected in the first acquired mass spectra. The monomer and dimer signal intensities were the same for Aβ-(1–40) and Aβ-(1–40)Met-35(O) (Fig. 3). Trimers Aβ-(1–40)3 and tetramers Aβ-(1–40)4 could also be detected in the first spectra of Aβ-(1–40) in H2O. However, trimers Aβ-(1–40)Met-35(O)3and tetramers Aβ-(1–40)Met-35(O)4 were not found in the first spectra of Aβ-(1–40) in 3% H2O2 or after 27–32 min (Fig. 3). After >100 min of incubation, the Aβ-(1–40) and Aβ-(1–40)Met-35(O) trimer and tetramer signals were also similar except for the mass shift of 16.00 Da per Aβ-(1–40) monomer caused by oxidation of Met-35. This lag phase was associated with the formation of Aβ-(1–40)Met-35(O)3 from Aβ-(1–40)Met(O) and Aβ-(1–40)Met-35(O)2 and has not been reported previously, although lag phases in Aβ aggregation have been observed in Aβ-(1–40) and Aβ-(1–42) mixtures (25Hasegawa K. Yamaguchi I. Omata S. Gejyo F. Naiki H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15514-15521Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 26Westlind-Danielsson A. Arnerup G. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14736-14743Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Aβ-(1–40) and Aβ-(1–40)Met-35(O) could be detected at 4.0 μm, 40 nm, 4.0 nm, and 400 pm concentrations; however, trimers and tetramers could only be detected at 4.0 μm, whereas dimers could still be detected at 40 nm. As a comparison, the concentration of Aβ-(1–40) is about 10 ng/ml or 2.3 nm in cerebrospinal fluid (27Mehta P.D. Pirttila T. Mehta S.P. Sersen E.A. Aisen P.S. Wisniewski H.M. Arch.

The Aβ-(1–40) dimers were distributed ∼0.25:0.5:0.25 among Aβ-(1–40)2, Aβ-(1–40)Aβ-(1–40)Met-35(O), and Aβ-(1–40)Met-35(O)2 (Fig. 5), indicating random incorporation of Aβ-(1–40) and Aβ-(1–40)Met-35(O) in dimers after 12 h. Similarly, a binomial distribution 0.125:0.375:0.375:0.125 is consistent with the measured signal of Aβ-(1–40) trimers (Fig. 6), although only Aβ-(1–40)2Aβ-(1–40)Met-35(O) and Aβ-(1–40)Aβ-(1–40)Met-35(O)2 have significant signal-to-background ratios to be detected in this spectrum. This indicates the random incorporation of Aβ-(1–40) and Aβ-(1–40)Met-35(O) also in heterotrimers formed after 12 h.Figure 5Mass spectrum showing the distribution of dimeric forms of Aβ-(1–40) and Aβ-(1–40)Met-35(O). If Aβ-(1–40) and Aβ-(1–40)Met-35(O) are randomly incorporated into dimers, a 0.25:0.5:0.25, or binomial, distribution of Aβ-(1–40)2, Aβ-(1–40)Aβ-(1–40)Met-35(O), and Aβ-(1–40)Met-35(O)2 would be expected. In this spectrum, the distribution is 0.290:0.446:0:263 and thus consistent with the assignment of little or no importance of oxidization of Met-35 in the formation of dimers at longer incubation times.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 6Distribution of Aβ-(1–40)2Aβ-(1–40)Met-35(O) and Aβ-(1–40)Aβ-(1–40)Met-35(O)2after 12 h, indicating little or no preference between Aβ-(1–40) and Aβ-(1–40)Met-35(O) in heterotrimers at longer incubation times.

Murphy R.M. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 640-651Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The pentameric form has not been reported previously in mass spectrometric studies. Aggregates could be selectively removed from the spectra by collisional heating in the hexapole ion trap in the ESI interface (29Håkansson K. Axelsson J. Palmblad M. Håkansson P. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 2000; 11: 210-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) without significant fragmentation or loss of monomer. After complete (>99%) oxidization of Met-35, no aggregates could be found in the mass spectra of Aβ-(1–40)Met(O) in H2O2 and acetonitrile even after several hours of incubation. These results suggest that oxidation of Met-35 inhibits a conformational switch of Aβ-(1–40) necessary for trimer formation but also that this conformational change does not significantly affect the formation of dimers of Aβ-(1–40) at low micromolar concentrations. Whether this switch occurs primarily in free monomers or in dimers or whether dimers formed in one Aβ molecule can go on to induce the same switch in other Aβ molecules remains to be investigated. The random incorporation of Aβ-(1–40) and Aβ-(1–40)Met-35(O) in homo- and heterodimers indicates that oxidization of Met-35 is of little or no importance in the formation of dimers. This is also consistent with the predicted structure of Aβ-(1–42) dimers where the Met-35 side chains are not located in the dimer interface (30Chaney M.O. Webster S.D. Kuo Y.M. Roher A.E. Protein Eng. 1998; 11: 761-767Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). From several structural predictions, Met-35 would be part of the second α-helix of the Aβ-(1–40) molecule, comprising amino acid residues 28–36 (31Barrow C.J. Yasuda A. Kenny P.T. Zagorski M.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 225: 1075-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar, 32Shao H. Jao S., Ma, K. Zagorski M.G. J. Mol.

Reportedly, Aβ-(1–40) shows predominant α-helical structure at conditions that are thought to mimic the membrane environment, including SDS and trifluoroethanol (31Barrow C.J. Yasuda A. Kenny P.T. Zagorski M.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 225: 1075-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar, 33Coles M. Bicknell W. Watson A.A. Fairlie D.P. Craik D.J.

Kusumoto Y. Fezoui Y. Condron M.M. Lomakin A. Benedek G.B. Selkoe D.J. Teplow D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25945-25952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (984) Google Scholar) but not known to be a prerequisite for β-sheet formation. However, recently careful temporal CD studies by Kirkitadze et al. (36Kirkitadze M.D. Condron M.M. Teplow D.B. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 312: 1103-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar) revealed that α-helical structure is formed in water solution by 18 biologically relevant forms of the Aβ peptide (including Aβ-(1–40)) as a transitory structure en route to the β-sheet structure. Interestingly, Kallberg et al.(37Kallberg Y. Gustafsson M. Persson B. Thyberg J. Johansson J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12945-12950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar) have identified the so-called α/β discordance as a predictor of β-amyloid formation, including the Aβ peptide, which further strengthens the α-helix→β-sheet transition hypothesis. Aβ is, like SDS, an amphipathic molecule, and evidence was recently presented that it forms micelle-like structures (38Yong W. Lomakin A. Kirkitadze M.D. Teplow D.B. Chen S.H. Benedek G.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 150-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), previously predicted to comprise a step in the fibrillization process (39Lomakin A. Teplow D.B. Kirschner D.A. Benedek G.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7942-7947Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). These allegedly constitute centers for fibril nucleation (38Yong W. Lomakin A. Kirkitadze M.D. Teplow D.B. Chen S.H. Benedek G.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 150-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). One can therefore envision that, similarly to its dissolution by SDS, Aβ forms α-helix-competent environments on its own accord, in micell-like aggregates, once it reaches the critical “micellar” concentration needed for this structural transition. The amphipathic nature of Aβ stems from its relatively polar N-terminal and extremely hydrophobic C-terminal region. There is also the central hydrophobic core, composed of amino acids 17–21. These hydrophobic regions, and in particular the C-terminal residues, Ile-41 and Ala-42 of the Aβ1–42 peptide (36Kirkitadze M.D. Condron M.M. Teplow D.B. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 312: 1103-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar), are critical determinants of the aggregation rate (40Kirschner D.A. Inouye H. Duffy L.K. Sinclair A. Lind M. Selkoe D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6953-6957Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar, 41Tjernberg L.O. Näslund J. Lindqvist F. Johansson J. Karlstrom A.R. Thyberg J. Terenius L. Nordstedt C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8545-8548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar). The oxidation may also change the stability of the second α-helix. However, the α-helix structure of Aβ has been detected just prior to maximum β-sheet formation when preparations are rich in higher molecular weight aggregates (36Kirkitadze M.D. Condron M.M. Teplow D.B. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 312: 1103-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). Although the effect of Met-35(O) may be substantial in these instances, it is not likely to provide an explanation of our observations given the low concentrations and short time frames used in this work and when low molecular weight oligomers have been the focus of attention. Therefore, the driving force for the association of these small oligomeric structures may be more dependent on hydrophobic interactions than on secondary structural driving forces. Aβ dimer methionine sulfoxide groups pointing outwards, as suggested by molecular modeling (30Chaney M.O. Webster S.D. Kuo Y.M. Roher A.E. Protein Eng. 1998; 11: 761-767Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and indirectly supported by our observations, would reduce the total hydrophobic surface available for further molecular association. Interestingly, Shen and Murphy (28Shen C.L. Murphy R.M. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 640-651Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) have observed faster fibril growth rates in acidic acetonitrile/water solution. The secondary structure of dimers and trimers remains to be determined using direct methods such as NMR, and the discussion on α-helical contents has to be considered in this context. In the experiments presented here, the ionization efficiencies and charge state distributions of monomer and dimers did not differ significantly between Aβ-(1–40) and Aβ-(1–40)Met-35(O) and therefore could be expected to be similar for trimers and tetramers as well, which is also supported by the fact that trimer and tetramer signal intensities are comparable after the initial lag phase. One should be cautious not to draw conclusions from the measurements of single charge states as charge state distribution can (and does, at least to a small degree) change upon oxidation of Met-35. The alteration of ionization efficiency and charge state distribution are possible sources of artifacts in electrospray ionization and could be caused by slight shifts in pH or altered potentials in the atmosphere/vacuum interface due to contamination. Finally, the results also demonstrate the applicability of electrospray ionization mass spectrometry to the study of the formation of small amyloid peptide aggregates and their kinetics in the nanomolar to micromolar range. Larger aggregates (decamers or larger) of Aβ peptides should be possible to detect in mass spectrometers of this type if present in micromolar concentrations (22Palmblad M. Håkansson K. Håkansson P. Feng X. Cooper H.J. Giannakopulos A.E. Green P.S. Derrick P.J. Eur. Mass Spectrom. 2000; 6: 267-275Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar), provided they survive the transition from liquid to gas phase and provided that stable electrospray conditions can be obtained in such solutions. In conclusion, we believe these results emphasize the need for more detailed molecular and mechanistic knowledge of the complex multistep Aβ fibrillization reaction to rapidly provide a more profound understanding of both cause and effect of Aβ-mediated actions in vitro and also in vivo. In addition, the post-translational Met-35 modification, if it is effectuated in vivo, provides an intriguing possibility for the brain involving rerouting Aβ from a potential protofibrillar/fibrillar pathway to a pathway that opens up better prospects of keeping low molecular weight Aβ species in solution longer, thereby increasing the likelihood of proteolysis and clearance while decreasing the risks of deposition.

Sci. 1999; 893: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) along with the recent shift in focus from the role of fibrillar to prefibrillar (13Klein W.L. Krafft G.A. Finch C.E.

In this study we assessed the changes induced in hippocampus by exposure of rats to whole body irradiation; the findings reveal that irradiation leads to apoptotic cell death in hippocampus, and as a consequence, long term potentiation in perforant path-granule cell synapses is markedly impaired. The evidence is consistent with the view that irradiation induced an increase in reactive oxygen species and that this leads to stimulation of the stress-activated protein kinase, JNK, and activation of the transcription factor, c-Jun. Consequent upon activation of JNK, a cascade of cell signaling events was stimulated that ultimately resulted in apoptosis, as suggested by parallel increases in cytochrome c translocation, caspase-3 activation, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage, and terminal dUTP nick-end labeling staining. Treatment of rats with eicosapentaenoic acid inhibited the irradiation-induced increase in reactive oxygen species production and the subsequent cellular signaling events, suggesting that oxidative stress triggered apoptotic cell death in the hippocampus of rats exposed to irradiation. Significantly, when the compromise in cell viability induced by irradiation was prevented by eicosapentaenoic acid, long term potentiation was sustained in a manner similar to that in the sham-treated control group.

It has been recognized for some time that neuronal tissue is susceptible to oxidative stress because of its high oxygen consumption and modest antioxidant defenses (1Halliwell B. J. Neurochem. 1992; 59: 1609-1623Crossref PubMed Scopus (2666) Google Scholar). These features are coupled with a high concentration of iron (2Benkovic S.A. Connor J.R. J. Comp. Neurol. 1993; 338: 97-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) and high concentrations of polyunsaturated fatty acids, which are easily oxidized and known to generate oxygen radicals following oxidation (3Rice-Evans C. Burdon R. Prog. Lipid Res. 1993; 32: 71-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar).

Daniel S.E. Lees A.J. Marsden D.C. Halliwell B. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 2112-2122PubMed Google Scholar) and Alzheimer's disease (5Smith M.A. Sayre L.M. Anderson V.E. Harris P.L. Beal M.F. Kowall N. Perry G. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1998; 46: 731-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Indeed recent data from studies undertaken in this laboratory have indicated that there is an increase in ROS accumulation in the hippocampus prepared from aged, compared with young, rats and that this is accompanied by an impairment in long term potentiation (LTP) in perforant path-granule cell synapses (6Murray C. Lynch M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12161-12168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Further studies have revealed that activities of two mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 MAP kinase, are increased in vivo when ROS accumulation is increased, for example in hippocampal tissue prepared from aged rats (7O'Donnell E. Vereker E. Lynch M.A. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2000; 12: 345-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) or rats injected intracerebroventricularly with the proinflammatory cytokine, interleukin-1β (IL-1β) (8Vereker E. O'Donnell E. Lynch M.A. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 6811-6819Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Significantly, dietary manipulation with ω-3 fatty acids, which restored the ability of aged rats to sustain LTP, reversed the age-related activation of JNK and p38, which accompanied the deficit in LTP (7O'Donnell E.

Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 1994; 65: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (1154) Google Scholar), and therefore, it is not surprising to find that at least some effects of exposure of cells to ROS are mimicked by exposure of cells to ionizing radiation. For example, exposure of guinea pigs to γ-irradiation is associated with impaired LTP in CA1 slices (10Tolliver J.M. Pellmar T.C. Radiat. Res. 1987; 112: 555-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 11Pellmar T.C. Schauer D.A. Zeman G.H. Radiat. Res. 1990; 122: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 12Pellmar T.C. Lepinski D.L. Radiat. Res. 1993; 136: 255-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and H2O2 has been shown to inhibit LTP in CA1 in guinea pig slices (13Pellmar T.C. Hollinden G.E. Sarvey J.M. Neuroscience. 1991; 44: 353-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Similarly, LTP is diminished in dentate gyrus in vivo in rats which received H2O2intracerebroventricularly (14Vereker E. O'Donnell E. Lynch A.M. Kelly Á. Nolan Y. Lynch M.A. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2001; 14: 1809-1819Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and in IL-1β-treated and aged rats (7O'Donnell E. Vereker E. Lynch M.A. Eur.

Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2974-2981Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in which an increase in hippocampal ROS accumulation has been described. It has also been shown that the activities of both JNK and p38 are increased by irradiation (16Chen Y.-R. Meyer C.F. Tan T.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 631-634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar, 17Zanke B.W. Boudreau K. Rubie E. Winnett E. Tibbles L.A. Zon L. Kyriakis J. Liu F.-F. Woodgett J.R. Curr.

Neurosci. 2000; 12: 345-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Interestingly, it has been reported that exposure of Jurkat T cells to γ-irradiation led to increased JNK activation (16Chen Y.-R. Meyer C.F. Tan T.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 631-634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar), and its activation (but not activation of either p42 MAP kinase or p38) was correlated with apoptotic changes (18Chen Y.-R. Wang X. Templeton D. Davis R.J. Tan T.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31929-31936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar). Several reports have implicated the JNK pathway in apoptosis in a variety of cell types (for example, PC12 cells (19Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5045) Google Scholar, 20Mielke K. Herdegen T. Prog.

Res. 1999; 57: 86-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). It is considered that JNK-stimulated phosphorylation of the transcription factor, c-Jun, represents an important step in the cascade of events leading to apoptosis (23Neary J.T. News Physiol. Sci. 1997; 12: 286-293Google Scholar, 24Ip Y.T. Davis R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1998; 10: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1386) Google Scholar, 25Harper S.J. LoGrasso P. Cell. Signal. 2001; 13: 299-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). The JNK signaling pathway is modulated by JNK-interacting protein (JIP), which was originally identified as a cytoplasmic inhibitor of JNK (26Dickens M. Rogers J.S. Cavanagh J. Raitano A. Xia Z. Halpern J.R. Greenberg M.E. Sawyers C.L. Davis R.J. Science. 1997; 277: 693-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar) and is now recognized as a scaffold protein which, when overexpressed in cells, prevents translocation of JNK to the nucleus and consequently inhibits JNK-mediated gene expression (27Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Tournier C. Yasuda J. Davis R.J. Science. 1998; 281: 1671-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). Significantly, the mouse homologue of JIP, islet brain 1 (IB1), has been shown to be highly expressed in hippocampus (28Pettel J.-B. Heafliger J.-A. Stable J.K. Widmann C. Welker E. Hirling H. Bonny C. Nicod P. Catsicas S. Waeber G. Reiderer B.M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2000; 12: 621-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). We have reported that age-related deficits in LTP and the accompanying changes in IL-1β concentration, ROS accumulation, and JNK and p38 activation can be prevented by dietary manipulation with essential fatty acids, for example the ω-3 fatty acid, docosahexaenoic acid (7O'Donnell E. Vereker E. Lynch M.A. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2000; 12: 345-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar,29McGahon B.M. Murray C.A. Horrobin D.F. Lynch M.A. Neurobiol. Aging. 1999; 20: 643-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Here we investigate the possibility that its precursor, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), which has been shown to have anti-inflammatory properties (30Hayashi H. Tanaka Y. Hibino H. Umeda Y. Kawamitsu H. Fujimoto H. Amakawa T. Curr. Med. Res. Opin. 1999; 15: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 31Babcock T. Helton W.S. Espat N.J. Nutrition. 2000; 16: 1116-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and which inhibited the age-related increase in IL-1β in hippocampus (32Martin D.S.D. Spencer P. Horrobin D. Lynch M.A. Soc. Neurosci. 2000; 26 (abstr.): 889Google Scholar), might be effective in protecting hippocampal neurons from damage induced by whole body irradiation. We present evidence that indicates that hippocampal tissue prepared from rats exposed to whole body irradiation exhibited increases in ROS accumulation and JNK activation and that these changes were coupled with evidence of apoptosis and with impairment in LTP. The data indicate that treatment with EPA prevented these changes and therefore acted as a neuroprotective and antiapoptotic agent. In this experiment 24 male Wistar rats were divided into four groups of 6. The animals were housed in groups of 6 in the BioResources Unit, Trinity College, Dublin, Ireland, under a 12-h light schedule, with the ambient temperature controlled between 22 and 23 °C. Food and water intake was measured daily for 1 week, and at the end of this period, 12 rats were assigned to a group that was fed on normal laboratory chow supplemented with ethyl EPA (2% v/w, dissolved in corn oil; Laxdale Ltd., UK) for 4 weeks. The remaining 12 rats received control diet (laboratory chow to which only corn oil was added). Rats were offered 100% of their average daily food intake so that the full daily allowance of EPA would be ingested. Sufficient diet was prepared for 2–3 days at a time. Food and water intake did not vary between groups, and there was no significant difference in daily food and water intake before and after dietary modifications were made. Rats were maintained under veterinary supervision for the duration of this experiment. At the end of this 4-week period, half of rats were exposed to whole body irradiation (10 gray at a rate of 10 gray/min; Nordion Gammacell Cesium Irradiator). The remaining rats were sham-irradiated. Rats were monitored for the 4 days following irradiation and were then assessed for their ability to sustain LTP. LTP was induced as described previously (29McGahon B.M. Murray C.A. Horrobin D.F. Lynch M.A. Neurobiol. Aging. 1999; 20: 643-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Rats were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of urethane (1.5 g/kg) and placed in a head holder in a stereotaxic frame. A window of skull was removed to allow placement of recording and stimulating electrodes in the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus (2.5 mm lateral and 3.9 mm posterior to bregma) and perforant path, respectively (angular bundle, 4.4 mm lateral to lambda). The depth of the electrodes was adjusted to obtain maximal responses in the cell body region. Test shocks at the rate of 1/30 s were delivered to the perforant path; base-line recordings were allowed to stabilize for about 15 min, and then electrophysiological recording commenced and continued for 10 min before and 40 min after tetanic stimulation (3 trains of stimuli; 250 Hz for 200 ms; intertrain interval 30 s). At the end of the electrophysiological recording period, rats were killed by decapitation; the hippocampus was removed, dissected on ice, and cross-chopped into slices (350 × 350 μm) using a McIlwain tissue chopper. The time taken to prepare slices from the time of death was 2.5–3.5 min. All samples were frozen separately in 1 ml of Krebs solution (composition of Krebs in mm: NaCl 136, KCl 2.54, KH2PO4 1.18, MgSO4·7H2O 1.18, NaHCO3 16, glucose 10, CaCl2 1.13) containing 10% dimethyl sulfoxide as described previously (29McGahon B.M. Murray C.A. Horrobin D.F. Lynch M.A. Neurobiol. Aging. 1999; 20: 643-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 33McGahon B.M. Martin D.S.D. Horrobin D.F. Lynch M.A. Neuroscience. 1999; 94: 305-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). For analysis, thawed slices of tissue were rinsed 3 times in fresh Krebs buffer and homogenized in fresh lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4); 10 mm KCl; 1.5 mm MgCl2; 1 mm EGTA; 1 mm EDTA; 1 mm dithiothreitol; 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; 2 μg/ml leupeptin; 2 μg/ml aprotinin; 200 mm sucrose), except in the case of tissue that was used for analysis of ROS, which was homogenized in 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4). The formation of reactive oxygen species was assessed in the impure synaptosomal preparation, P2, as described previously (34Lebel C.P. Bondy S.C. Neurochem. Int. 1990; 17: 435-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). The method relies on oxidation of the non-fluorescent probe, 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescin diacetate, by reactive oxygen species, to the highly fluorescent 2′,7-dichlorofluorescein. To assess reactive oxygen species production, synaptosomes were prepared as described previously (29McGahon B.M. Murray C.A. Horrobin D.F. Lynch M.A. Neurobiol. Aging. 1999; 20: 643-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 33McGahon B.M. Martin D.S.D. Horrobin D.F. Lynch M.A. Neuroscience. 1999; 94: 305-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) from hippocampal slices obtained from γ-irradiated and sham-irradiated rats treated with either diet. The resultant pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of ice-cold 40 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.4), and aliquots (1 ml) of homogenate were incubated with 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescin diacetate (10 μl; final concentration 5 μm; from a stock solution of 500 μm in methanol; Molecular Probes) at 37 °C for 15 min. To terminate the reaction, the dye-loaded synaptosomes were centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 8 min. The pellet was resuspended in 1.5 ml of ice-cold 40 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.4), and fluorescence was monitored at a constant temperature of 37 °C at 488 nm excitation (bandwidth 5 nm) and 525 nm emission (bandwidth 20 nm). Reactive oxygen species formation was quantified from a standard curve of 2′,7-dichlorofluorescein in methanol (range 0.05 to 1 μm). Results were expressed as nmol/mg tissue corrected for protein. JNK phosphorylation, cytochrome c translocation, PARP cleavage, c-Jun phosphorylation, and JIP-1 expression were analyzed in samples prepared from hippocampal tissue using a method described previously (35Vereker E. Campbell V. Roche E. McEntee E. Lynch M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26252-26528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In the case of JNK, PARP, c-Jun, and JIP tissue homogenates were diluted to equalize for protein concentration, and aliquots (100 μl, 2 mg/ml) were added to 100 μl of sample buffer (Tris-HCl, 0.5 mm (pH 6.8); glycerol 20%; SDS, 2%; β-mercaptoethanol, 5%; bromphenol blue, 0.05% w/v), boiled for 5 min, and loaded onto gels (10% SDS for PARP, c-Jun, and JIP and 12% for JNK). In the case of cytochrome c, the cytosolic fraction was prepared by homogenizing slices of hippocampus in lysis buffer and incubating for 20 min on ice and centrifuging (15,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C). The supernatant (i.e. cytosolic fraction) was suspended in sample buffer to a final concentration of 300 μg/ml, boiled for 3 min, and loaded (6 μg/lane) onto 12% gels. In all cases proteins were separated by application of 30 mA constant current for 25–30 min, transferred onto nitrocellulose strips (225 mA for 75 min), and immunoblotted with the appropriate antibody. To assess JNK activity, proteins were immunoblotted with an antibody that specifically targets phosphorylated JNK (1:300 in Tris-buffered saline/Tween (0.05% Tween 20) containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 2 h at room temperature. To assess cleavage of PARP, we immunoblotted with an antibody (1:500 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)/Tween (0.1% Tween 20) containing 2% non-fat dried milk) raised against the epitope corresponding to amino acids 764–1014 of PARP of human origin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.). To assess cytochrome c, a rabbit polyclonal antibody (1:250 in PBS/Tween containing 2% non-fat dried milk; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) raised against recombinant protein corresponding to amino acids 1–104 of cytochrome c was used. In the case of JIP-1, we immunoblotted with a goat polyclonal antibody (1:1000 in Tris-buffered saline/Tween containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) raised against a peptide mapped at the carboxyl terminus of JIP-1 of mouse origin for 2 h. To assess phosphorylation of c-Jun, a mouse monoclonal antibody (1:200 in PBS/Tween containing 2% non-fat dried milk; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) raised against a peptide corresponding to amino acids 56–69 of c-Jun of human origin was used. Immunoreactive bands were detected as follows: peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Sigma) and SuperSignal chemiluminescence (Pierce) for JNK and c-Jun, peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma) and SuperSignal (Pierce) for PARP, peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma) and ECL (AmershamBiosciences) for cytochrome c and peroxide-labeled anti-goat IgG (Vector Laboratories) and SuperSignal (Pierce) for JIP. All immunoblots were exposed to film and processed using a Fuji x-ray processor. Bands were quantified using densitometry (ZERO-Dscan Image Analysis System, Scanalytics, Inc.). The effects of H2O2 and VIP were also assessed on the activity of JNK. Hippocampal slices were homogenized in either Krebs solution or VIP (10 μm) and incubated for 20 min at 37 °C with O2 in Krebs solution in the presence or absence of H2O2 (200 μm). The analysis proceeded as described above. Cleavage of the caspase-3 substrate (Ac-DEVD-7-amino-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin peptide, Alexis Corp.) to its fluorescent product was used as a measure of caspase-3 activity. Slices of hippocampal tissue were washed, homogenized in lysis buffer (400 μl; 25 mm HEPES, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin (pH 7.4)), incubated on ice for 20 min, analyzed for protein concentration, and diluted to equalize for protein concentration. Homogenates (98 μl) were added to 2 μl of caspase-3 substrate (final concentration 5 μm, from a stock solution of 5 mm in incubation buffer; 100 mm HEPES, 5 mm dithiothreitol (pH 7.4)), transferred to a 96-well plate, and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Fluorescence was assessed (excitation, 390 nm; emission 510 nm), and enzyme activity was calculated with reference to a standard curve of 7-amino-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin (0–10 μm) concentration versus absorbance; values were therefore expressed as nmol of 7-amino-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin/mg of protein/min. The effects of H2O2 and VIP were also assessed on the activity of caspase-3. Hippocampal slices were homogenized in either Krebs solution or VIP (10 μm) and incubated for 20 min at 37 °C with O2 in Krebs solution in the presence or absence of H2O2 (200 μm). The analysis of caspase-3 activity proceeded as described above. Dissociated cells were prepared from slices of hippocampus as described previously (36MacManus A. Ramsden M. Murray M. Pearson H.A. Campbell V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4713-4718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Briefly, slices were incubated for 45 min in HEPES-buffered Krebs solution (pH 7.4; composition in mm: NaCl, 145; KCl, 5; MgCl2, 1; CaCl2, 2; Mg2SO4, 1; KH2PO4, 1; glucose, 10; HEPES, 30) containing trypsin (1 mg/ml) and DNase (1600 units/liter) protease X (1 mg/ml), protease XIV (1 mg/ml), and DNase (1600 units/liter). Washed slices were resuspended in 750 μl of PBS, triturated with a fire-polished Pasteur pipette, and passed through a nylon mesh filter to remove tissue clumps. Aliquots (100 μl) of the cell suspension were spun onto glass slides at 600 rpm for 2 min (Shandon Cytospin 3), and cells were fixed in methanol and stored at room temperature for later use. Apoptotic cell death was assessed using the DeadEnd Colorimetric Apoptosis Detection System (Promega). The cytospun cells were fixed for 25 min with 4% paraformaldehyde, washed twice for 5 min in PBS, permeabilized with proteinase K, and washed. Cells were immersed for 10 min in equilibration buffer and incubated at 37 °C for 60 min with TDT mix, containing TdT enzyme (25 units/μl), biotinylated nucleotide mix, and equilibration buffer. The reaction was terminated by incubating the cells in sodium chloride/sodium citrate buffer for 15 min at room temperature. Cells were washed three times in PBS to remove unincorporated biotinylated nucleotides, and endogenous peroxidases were blocked by incubating in the presence of 0.3% H2O2 for 5 min. Cells were washed, incubated with streptavidin horseradish peroxidase (1:500 in PBS) for 30 min at room temperature, and washed again, and staining was developed by addition of the chromogene 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride and H2O2 for 20 min. By using this procedure, apoptotic nuclei were stained dark brown. Negative cells were counter-stained with toluidine blue, dehydrated through alcohol to xylene, and mounted in distyrene plasticizer in xylene and viewed under ×40 magnification. Data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to determine whether there were significant differences between conditions. When this analysis indicated significance (at the 0.05 level), post hoc Student's Newmann-Keuls test analysis was used to determine which conditions were significantly different from each other. Fig. 1 demonstrates that LTP was impaired in rats that were exposed to irradiation; the mean percentage change (± S.E.) in excitatory postsynaptic potential slope in the 2 min immediately following tetanic stimulation (compared with that in the 5 min immediately prior to stimulation) was 127.99% (± 3.61), which was significantly decreased compared with the corresponding value in sham-irradiated rats, 148.18% (±7.31; p < 0.05; ANOVA; n = 6 in both groups). The mean percentage changes in the last 5 min of the experiment were 134.17 (±3.60) and 98.82% (±12.51) in sham-irradiated and irradiated rats, respectively (p < 0.001; n = 6 in both groups). The mean percentage changes in the 2 min immediately following tetanic stimulation and in the last 5 min of the experiment were 155.83 (±6.23) and 120.45% (±1.14) in sham-irradiated rats that were treated with EPA for 4 weeks prior to analysis of LTP; the corresponding values in irradiated rats that were treated with EPA were 146.22 (±5.01) and 119.38% (±1.16). Although irradiation resulted in a significant attenuation of LTP (p < 0.001; ANOVA), the inhibitory effect of irradiation was reversed by treatment with EPA so that there was a significant difference in the response to tetanic stimulation in control-treated and EPA-treated irradiated rats (p < 0.001; ANOVA). However, it should be noted that the degree of LTP sustained by control-treated, sham-irradiated rats was greater than EPA-treated irradiated rats (p < 0.05; ANOVA). Mean ROS accumulation was similar in control-treated and EPA-treated sham-irradiated rats but was significantly enhanced in hippocampal tissue prepared from irradiated rats compared with sham-irradiated rats (Fig. 2 a; p < 0.05; ANOVA). Treatment with EPA reversed the irradiation-induced change, so that this value was similar to the values in tissue prepared from sham-irradiated rats. The irradiation-stimulated changes in ROS accumulation were mirrored by the changes in JNK activation. Thus JNK activation was similar in hippocampal tissue prepared from control-treated and EPA-treated sham-irradiated rats (Fig. 2 b), and although it was significantly increased in tissue prepared from control-treated, irradiated rats (p < 0.05; ANOVA), this increase in JNK activation was prevented in EPA-treated rats. The sample immunoblot illustrates the irradiation-induced increase in JNK activation (lane 3) compared with the tissue prepared from the EPA-treated irradiated (lane 4) or sham-irradiated (lane 2) rats or from control-treated sham-irradiated rats (lane 1). JNK activation has been shown to trigger phosphorylation of c-Jun in a number of cell types, and therefore it was predicted that it would induce a similar change in hippocampus. Fig. 2 c shows one sample immunoblot that indicates that c-Jun phosphorylation was enhanced in hippocampal tissue prepared from control-treated irradiated rats (lane 3) compared with tissue prepared from rats in the other treatment groups. Assessments of the mean data obtained from densitometric analysis revealed that the increase in c-Jun phosphorylation induced by irradiation in control-treated rats was significantly different from the mean value in the sham-irradiated control group (p < 0.05; ANOVA). Treatment with EPA suppressed the irradiation-induced increase in c-Jun phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of c-Jun by JNK has been shown to be modified by JIP, and the current data indicate that although expression of JIP was similar in hippocampal tissue prepared from both sham-irradiated groups of rats (see lanes 1–3; Fig. 2 d), it was markedly enhanced in hippocampal tissue prepared from irradiated rats that were treated with EPA (lane 4; Fig. 2 d;p < 0.05; ANOVA compared with the mean values in any of the other three groups). Cytochrome c translocation was examined by investigating expression of the protein in the cytosol (Fig. 3 a). The data indicate that there was an irradiation-induced increase in cytochrome c translocation (compare lane 3 with each of the other lanes), and analysis of mean data indicates that this increase was significantly different from that in any of the other groups (p < 0.01; ANOVA). Caspase-3 activation is one consequence of an increase in cytochrome c expression in cytosol, and the data presented in Fig. 3 b indicate that activity of caspase-3 paralleled the changes in cytochrome c. Thus enzyme activity was similar in both treatment groups of sham-irradiated rats, but significantly enhanced in hippocampal tissue prepared from control-treated irradiated rats (p< 0.05; ANOVA). EPA treatment prevented the irradiation-induced increase so that mean caspase-3 activity was similar in this group and the sham-irradiated groups of rats. PARP cleavage was increased with irradiation as reflected by the decreased expression of the 116-kDa fragment of the protein (Fig. 4 a); thi"
https://openalex.org/W1963993768,"The highly conserved RAD51 protein has a central role in homologous recombination. Five novel RAD51-like genes have been identified in mammalian cells, but little is known about their functions. A DNA damage-sensitive hamster cell line, irs3, was found to have a mutation in the RAD51L2 gene and an undetectable level of RAD51L2 protein. Resistance of irs3 to DNA-damaging agents was significantly increased by expression of the human RAD51L2 gene, but not by other RAD51-like genes or RAD51 itself. Consistent with a role for RAD51L2 in homologous recombination, irs3 cells show a reduction in sister chromatid exchange, an increase in isochromatid breaks, and a decrease in damage-dependent RAD51 focus formation compared with wild type cells. As recently demonstrated for human cells, we show that RAD51L2 forms part of two separate complexes of hamster RAD51-like proteins. Strikingly, neither complex of RAD51-like proteins is formed in irs3 cells. Our results demonstrate that RAD51L2 has a key role in mammalian RAD51-dependent processes, contingent on the formation of protein complexes involved in homologous recombination repair.

Our results demonstrate that RAD51L2 has a key role in mammalian RAD51-dependent processes, contingent on the formation of protein complexes involved in homologous recombination repair. The use of cultured mammalian cell lines selected for sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents to identify genes and gene functions has had a major impact on our understanding of DNA repair pathways. In particular, components of the nucleotide excision repair and DNA end joining pathways were identified and their cellular responses characterized using DNA damage-sensitive cell lines (1Hoeijmakers J.H. Trends Genet. 1993; 9: 211-217Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 2Jeggo P.A. Radiat. Res. 1998; 150: S80-S91Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Recently, the value of this approach has been reinforced by the identification of genes from the homologous recombination repair pathway, with the cloning of the XRCC2 and XRCC3 genes by their ability to complement sensitive mammalian cell lines (3Thacker J. Biochimie (Paris). 1999; 81: 77-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 4Thompson L.H. Schild D. Biochimie (Paris). 1999; 81: 87-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The repair of DNA damage by homologous recombination is important for the maintenance of genetic stability in cells. The RAD51 protein is central to the recombination process, and this protein is highly conserved from yeast to humans (5Baumann P. West S.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 247-251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). Using molecular recombination assays, yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and human RAD51 proteins have been shown to promote DNA strand exchange. In S. cerevisiae, two RAD51-like proteins, Rad55p and Rad57p, form a heterodimer and stimulate Rad51-mediated recombination reactions (6Sung P. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1111-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). Yeast mutants that lack either Rad51 or these Rad51-like recombination proteins are extremely sensitive to agents causing severe forms of damage to DNA, such as double-strand breaks and interstrand cross-links (7Game J.C. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1993; 4: 73-83PubMed Google Scholar). Rad55p and Rad57p also have counterparts in mammalian cells, including XRCC2, XRCC3, RAD51L1 1RAD51L is the recommended symbol for the RAD51-like genes/proteins (Human Gene Nomenclature Committee). (hREC2, RAD51B, R51H2), RAD51L2 (RAD51C), and RAD51L3 (R51H3, RAD51D) (8Thacker J. Trends Genet. 1999; 15: 166-168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar).

At present very little is known about the functions of these mammalian RAD51-like proteins, although specific protein-protein interactions have been described which suggest that they form heterodimers and larger complexes that may help recruit RAD51 to sites of DNA damage (14Braybrooke J.P.

A series of DNA damage-sensitive hamster cell lines, termed the irs mutants, were previously isolated in this laboratory (23Jones N.J. Cox R. Thacker J. Mutat. Res. 1987; 183: 279-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). We and others used the irs1 cell line to clone the XRCC2 gene by its complementing ability for sensitivity to the potent DNA cross-linking agent, mitomycin-C (24Tambini C.E. George A.M. Rommens J.M.

The irs1 line is also sensitive to other DNA-damaging agents, including ionizing radiation, ultraviolet light, and alkylating agents (23Jones N.J. Cox R. Thacker J. Mutat. Res. 1987; 183: 279-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). It shows spontaneous genetic instability, with increased frequencies of mutations (27Thacker J. Ganesh A.N. Stretch A. Benjamin D.M. Zahalsky A.J. Hendrickson E.A. Mutagenesis. 1994; 9: 163-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), chromosomal aberrations (28Tucker J.D. Jones N.J. Allen N.A. Minkler J.L.

Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 757-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that the repair of a site-specific double-strand break by homologous recombination is severely reduced in irs1 compared with the paternal V79 cells (30Johnson R.D. Liu N. Jasin M. Nature. 1999; 401: 397-399Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have recently established a functional link between XRCC2 and RAD51 by showing that the irs1 line is defective in the formation of damage-dependent RAD51 focus formation (31O'Regan P. Wilson C. Townsend S. Thacker J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22148-22153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The irs3 cell line is another member of this series of damage-sensitive cell lines. In cell fusions, irs3 was found to be able to complement damage sensitivity in several other radiation-sensitive mammalian cell lines, including irs1, showing that it has a unique genetic defect (32Jones N.J. Cox R. Thacker J. Mutat. Res. 1988; 193: 139-144PubMed Google Scholar). However, the irs3 cell line has a similar damage sensitivity profile to irs1, being sensitive to x-rays (2-fold), ethyl methanesulfonate (2.5-fold) and especially MMC 2The abbreviations used are: MMCmitomycin-CRTreverse transcriptaseSCEsister chromatid exchangespAbpolyclonal antibodymAbmonoclonal antibodyIRESinternal ribosome entry site (7-fold), and shows chromosomal instability (23Jones N.J.

The human cDNAs were cloned into mammalian expression vectors; RAD51L1 in pEBS7 (34Peterson C. Legerski R. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 107: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and RAD51L3 in pZeoSV2(−) (Invitrogen). Human RAD51L2 (also called RAD51C (12Dosanjh M.K. Collins D.W. Fan W. Lennon G.G. Albala J.S. Shen Z. Schild D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1179-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar)) was cloned from a human testis cDNA library (CLONTECH) into pZeoSV2(−), and was subsequently recloned into the bicistronic mammalian expression vector pIRESneo2 (CLONTECH). The human RAD51 gene was cloned from the same cDNA library into pIRESneo2. The Chinese hamster RAD51L2 gene was cloned from a CHO-K1 cDNA library (Invitrogen); the central portion of the gene was cloned first using primers designed to conserved regions of the human (12Dosanjh M.K. Collins D.W. Fan W. Lennon G.G. Albala J.S. Shen Z. Schild D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1179-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) and mouse genes (mouse gene data came from sequencing a mouse IMAGE clone 3598583 found by data base search to have close homology to the human cDNA; data not shown). The remainder of the hamster gene was cloned from the same library using nested primers designed to the central portion and to the library vector, pCDNA1. The accession number of the Chinese hamster RAD51L2 sequence is AJ413202. All cloned genes were verified by sequencing. Gridded filters and clones from the human genomic PAC library RPCI1 were supplied by the UK HGMP Resource Centre. Filters were probed with full-length human RAD51L2 cDNA, and DNA from positive clones was isolated using a Qiagen large-construct kit. One PAC clone (259-O5) was mapped to human metaphase chromosomes using a biotinylated probe, detected with Texas Red avidin. Well spread metaphases were captured and karyotyped using the Genus Applied Imaging system. Parental V79 and mutant irs3 cells were cultured at 37 °C as monolayers in minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine and antibiotics. 10 μg of the RAD51L1, RAD51L2, RAD51L3, or RAD51 constructs were electroporated into 106 irs3 cells (BioRad Gene Pulser set at 500 μF, 400 V) and transfected clones were selected in the appropriate drugs. Following clone isolation, resistance to mitomycin-C (MMC) was initially tested in 24-well plates by seeding 100–300 cells/well in graded concentrations of MMC (31O'Regan P. Wilson C. Townsend S. Thacker J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22148-22153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In control experiments we did not see any reversion of the irs3 phenotype (i.e. no background clonal growth under selective conditions; data not shown). PAC 259-O5 was chosen to test complementation with genomic RAD51L2 DNA. 15 μg of PAC DNA was co-transfected with 2 μg of the vector pEGFP-N2 (CLONTECH) into irs3 cells as described above, followed by selection in 500 μg/ml G418. Colonies of G418-resistant cells were pooled and respread in 300 μg/ml G418 and 4 × 10−8 m MMC. The presence of the appropriate RAD51L gene (cDNA or PAC) was tested in drug-resistant irs3 clones by PCR using cellular DNA, and gene expression was checked by reverse transcriptase (RT-) PCR (Superscript II, Invitrogen) of cellular RNA with oligo(dT) as the first-strand primer. Subconfluent cells were harvested as a single-celled suspension. Appropriate numbers of cells were reseeded into 9-cm dishes for MMC treatment, which lasted for the duration of the experiment. Compared with acute treatment (23Jones N.J. Cox R. Thacker J. Mutat. Res. 1987; 183: 279-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), chronic MMC treatment increased the survival difference between irs3 and V79 cells to about 20-fold. X-ray treatment (250 kV) was given to 2 × 105 cells in suspension, followed by reseeding appropriate numbers into 9-cm dishes. Three dishes were used for each dose point. Cells were seeded onto coverslips and grown for 48 h to subconfluent levels before being mock-treated or exposed to 10 Gray X-rays, a dose previously shown to induce a measurable frequency of foci (31O'Regan P. Wilson C. Townsend S. Thacker J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22148-22153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 35Bishop D.K. Ear U. Bhattacharyya A. Calderone C. Beckett M.

After a further 5-h incubation at 37 °C, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde for 2 h at 4 °C. Fixed cells were permeabilized for 10 min at room temperature in 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1 × SSC and then blocked for 1 h at room temperature in phosphate-buffered saline, 5% normal horse serum. Cells were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 1:100 dilution primary antibody, rabbit polyclonal anti-RAD51 (Ab-1) antibody (Oncogene Research), then incubated with 1:100 dilution secondary antibody, Cy5-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch) for 1 h at room temperature in the dark. The coverslips were mounted in Vectashield anti-fade medium and the cells analyzed by confocal microscopy at 633 nm (BioRad MRC600). Images were selected at random, and were scored from coded slides by two independent scorers, recording the number of discrete strongly fluorescing nuclear foci present in each cell. At least 50 cells were scored for each data point, and data were compared statistically to assess homogeneity using the Mann-Whitney U test. To measure sister chromatid exchanges (SCE), cells were incubated in the dark with bromodeoxyuridine (10 μg/ml) for 2 cell cycles to differentially label sister chromatids. MMC was added for 2 h at the start of the experiment. Colcemid (0.05 μg/ml) was added for 2 h prior to harvesting the cells. Metaphase preparations were made using standard techniques. Differential staining of chromatids was achieved with the fluorescence plus Giemsa (FPG, “harlequin”) staining method (36Perry P. Wolff S. Nature. 1974; 251: 156-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (3026) Google Scholar). Chromatid and chromosome aberrations were scored and classified (37Savage J.R. J. Med. Genet. 1976; 13: 103-122Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) from coded slides. Chromatid breaks were scored where a physical displacement of the broken fragment was seen. RNA was isolated from parental V79 and from the damage-sensitive lines irs1, irs2, and irs3 using an RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen). This RNA was used in an RT-PCR reaction (as above). The resulting cDNA was used as a template for PCR primers designed to amplify the full-length RAD51L2 hamster gene. Individual PCR products were sliced out of gels and cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO (Invitrogen) before sequencing. In analyzing PCR products for splice variants, intron/exon boundaries were assumed to be the same as in human genomic sequence (9 exons found using data from accession numbers AC021455 and AC025521). All antibodies were raised against human recombinant denatured protein as described (17Masson J.Y. Stasiak A.Z. Stasiak A. Benson F.E. West S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8440-8446Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The monoclonal antibodies 1E11 (RAD51L1), 2H11 (RAD51L2), 5A8 (RAD51L3), 1G4 (XRCC2), and 7F12 (XRCC3) specifically recognized the corresponding human proteins. The anti-RAD51 mAb (14B4) was purchased from Abcam. V79 or irs3 cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5m NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) containing protease inhibitors, incubated for 30 min on ice, dounced 10 times and sonicated twice for 30 s. Insoluble material was removed by high-speed centrifugation. Protein complexes in the supernatant (equivalent to ∼15 mg of extract) were pulled down for 1.5 h at 4 °C using preimmune serum or pAbs raised against RAD51L2 or XRCC2 cross-linked to Aminolink beads (Pierce). Complexes were washed four times in lysis buffer and visualized by Western blotting using monoclonal antibodies. To establish a link between RAD51L2 and the irs3 phenotype, we sought to clone the hamster RAD51L2 gene and check its integrity in irs3. We used sequence homologies between mouse and human RAD51L2 genes to design primers for the isolation of the hamster gene (see “Experimental Procedures”). Cloning of the full-length hamster cDNA showed that its predicted protein sequence is highly conserved in comparison to the human and mouse RAD51L2 proteins. The mouse and hamster proteins show 84% identity to each other, and each shows 77% identity to the human protein with only one amino acid difference in length (Fig. 1). Reverse-transcribed RNA from the V79 parent and irs3 lines was used to make RAD51L2 cDNA. Using full-length gene primers in PCR, both cell lines showed a number of different sized cDNA products (Fig. 2 A). To check that the altered profile of cDNA products in irs3 was related to the RAD51L2 gene defect, we assayed the RAD51L2 cDNA profiles in two other radiation-sensitive mutants isolated in the same screen from mutagenized V79 cells. The irs1 line (XRCC2-deficient) and the irs2 line (shown by complementation testing to be defective in a different gene from irs1 or irs3 (32Jones N.J. Cox R. Thacker J. Mutat. Res. 1988; 193: 139-144PubMed Google Scholar)) both showed RAD51L2 profiles that were essentially the same as that for V79 (Fig. 2 A).Figure 2RAD51L2 is mutated in irs3 cells.

In repeated amplifications of cDNA from irs3 the full-length gene product was either of very low abundance or not present, but there were also visible levels of some splice variants (Fig. 2 A). The largest RAD51L2 product that could be seen readily from irs3 preparations was found to lack exon 6. Exon 6 could not be cloned from irs3 using primers to cDNA sequence either side of the exon (Fig. 2 B). However, we were able to obtain sufficient product for cloning by “forcing” the amplification of exon 6 in two pieces, using a combination of overlapping primers internal and external to the exon. The sequence of exon 6 from irs3 consistently showed a single nucleotide change (G → T) at position +1 (Fig. 2 C). This base substitution is consistent with the mutation spectrum of ethyl nitrosourea, which was used to derive the irs3 cell line, although G → T is one of the less common types of substitution found (38Shibuya T. Morimoto K. Mutat. Res. 1993; 297: 3-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 39Justice M.J. Noveroske J.K. Weber J.S. Zheng B. Bradley A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 1955-1963Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). This change alters the consensus for the 3′ acceptor splice site (see “Discussion”), and gives an amino acid change (Val → Phe). While it is difficult to comment on the importance of this residue for mammalian species, since it is one of many highly conserved amino acids (Fig. 1), comparisons to putative RAD51L2 orthologues in plant species show that this valine is widely conserved (Fig. 2 C, which shows comparisons to the cress Arabidopsis thaliana and rice Oryza sativa where the overall identity to the human protein is reduced to about 40%). The effect of this mutation on RAD51L2 protein levels is seen in Fig. 2 D. We found that polyclonal (not shown) or monoclonal antibodies raised against human RAD51L2 recognized the hamster protein (V79 extract, lane 2), whereas RAD51L2 was not seen in the irs3 extract (lane 3). The levels of RAD51 were the same in wild type V79 and the irs3 cell lines (lanes 5 and 6). To show that the phenotype of irs3 is related to the observed RAD51L2 defect, we transfected the human RAD51L2 cDNA into irs3 cells. To ensure that any responses found were specific to this gene, we also transfected separately the human RAD51L1 and RAD51L3 cDNAs into irs3. Cell clones carrying stably integrated cDNAs were selected using dominant drug-resistant markers present in the vectors, and were subsequently tested for resistance to MMC. None of the clones transfected with RAD51L1 or RAD51L3 showed an increase in MMC resistance, despite the presence of transcripts from the full-length gene as seen by RT-PCR (data not shown). However, with RAD51L2, a fraction of the selected clones showed significant MMC resistance. To verify this result under conditions where the RAD51L2 cDNA is expressed coordinately with the dominant selectable marker, we recloned RAD51L2 into an expression vector with an internal ribosome entry (IRES) site. Following transfection of this construct, every clone showing the presence of transcripts from the RAD51L2 gene product was found to be resistant to MMC (Fig. 3 A). In addition to complementation tests with the human RAD51L2 cDNA, we identified human genomic (PAC) DNA carrying the RAD51L2 gene (see “Experimental Procedures”). In Fig. 3 B we show that the PAC DNA mapped to the expected chromosomal site of the gene, chromosome 17q (12Dosanjh M.K. Collins D.W. Fan W. Lennon G.G. Albala J.S. Shen Z. Schild D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1179-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) (now known to be at 17q23; see genome.ucsc.edu/). Stable PAC-transfected clones of irs3 cells gave a similar level of MMC resistance to the cDNA carrying clones (Fig. 3 A). We conclude that there is a direct correlation between the presence of the RAD51L2 gene and the restoration of MMC resistance to irs3 cells. Cells deficient in homologous recombination genes show sensitivity to a number of DNA-damaging agents, in addition to MMC. We have previously shown an ∼2-fold increase in sensitivity to x-rays in irs3 (23Jones N.J. Cox R. Thacker J. Mutat. Res. 1987; 183: 279-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). In the present series of experiments, we confirmed this radiation response and in agreement with the MMC data showed that the RAD51L2 cDNA was able to partially complement the irs3 X-ray sensitivity (Fig. 3 C). Importantly, recombination-deficient cells show spontaneous genetic instability, and irs3 is no exception to this finding. The frequency of chromosome damage in irs3 cells was substantially higher than in the V79 parent line, and we found again that the presence of RAD51L2 largely complemented this defect (Table I). It is notable that that the frequency of isochromatid breaks was especially high in irs3 (77% of total breaks; see “Discussion”).Table IHigh levels of spontaneous chromosome damage in irs3Cell lineCells scoredChromatid breaksIsochromatid breaksExchangesTotal aberrations (per 100 cells)V792040202 (1.0)irs32495171133 (13.2)irs3 +RAD51L2 clone 12051326 (2.9)irs3 +RAD51L2 clone 22064408 (3.9) Open table in a new tab SCE are thought to result from molecular crossing over of DNA strands, especially arising during replication when recombination may rescue forks stalled at sites of damage. A small reduction in spontaneous SCE frequency was found for irs3 (Table II). However, using the same MMC concentration for both V79 and irs3 cells (4 × 10−7 m; i.e. not allowing for their survival difference) irs3 cells gave a highly significant 30% reduction in SCE frequency. If differences in the MMC sensitivity of V79 and irs3 are taken into account, using approximately equitoxic MMC concentrations, much larger differences in SCE frequency were found. Again, stable clones transfected with the RAD51L2 cDNA showed a substantial increase in SCE frequencies compared with the irs3 line (Table II).Table IIReduced frequencies of spontaneous and mitomycin C-induced sister chromatid exchanges in irs3Cell lineCells scoredSCE/cell (± se)pValue2-aBased on Mann-Whitney U-tests, comparing either V79 with irs3 or the RAD51L2-transfected clones with irs3 at the same dose of MMC.V791015.5 ± 0.20.0002irs31034.4 ± 0.2V79 + MMC (4 × 10−7 m)2-bData summed from two independent experiments, where the frequencies for V79 were 47.5 and 48.9 SCE/cell, and for irs3 were 33.2 and 33.2 SCE/cell, respectively.15348.0 ± 1.1<10−6irs3 + MMC (4 × 10−7 m)2-bData summed from two independent experiments, where the frequencies for V79 were 47.5 and 48.9 SCE/cell, and for irs3 were 33.2 and 33.2 SCE/cell, respectively.12733.2 ± 1.1irs3 + RAD51L2 clone 1 (4 × 10−7 m)9851.0 ± 1.2<10−6irs3 +RAD51L2 clone 2 (4 × 10−7 m)10042.4 ± 1.2<10−6V79 + MMC (4 × 10−6 m)2-cEquivalent survival level to 4 × 10−7 m for irs3.7688.2 ± 2.4irs3 + MMC (4 × 10−8 m)2-dEquivalent survival level to 4 × 10−7 m for V79.1058.1 ± 0.32-a Based on Mann-Whitney U-tests, comparing either V79 with irs3 or the RAD51L2-transfected clones with irs3 at the same dose of MMC.2-b Data summed from two independent experiments, where the frequencies for V79 were 47.5 and 48.9 SCE/cell, and for irs3 were 33.2 and 33.2 SCE/cell, respectively.2-c Equivalent survival level to 4 × 10−7 m for irs3.2-d Equivalent survival level to 4 × 10−7 m for V79.

Transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1) is a pleiotropic cytokine involved in cellular proliferation and differentiation. The level of TGF-β1 is elevated in many chronic inflammatory lung disorders associated with oxidant/antioxidant imbalance. In this study, we show that TGF-β1 depletes GSH by down-regulating expression of the enzyme responsible for its formation, γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase (γ-GCS) and induces reactive oxygen species production in type II alveolar epithelial cells (A549). To investigate the molecular mechanisms of inhibition of glutathione synthesis, we employed reporters containing fragments from the promoter region of the γ-GCS heavy subunit (h), the gene that encodes the catalytic subunit of γ-GCS. We found that TGF-β1reduced the expression of the long γ-GCSh construct (−3802/GCSh-5′-Luc), suggesting that an antioxidant response element (ARE) may be responsible for mediating the TGF-β1 effect. Interestingly, the electrophoretic mobility shift assay revealed that the DNA binding activity of both activator protein-1 (AP-1) and ARE was increased in TGF-β1-treated epithelial cells. The γ-GCSh ARE contains a perfect AP-1 site embedded within it, and mutation of this internal AP-1 sequence, but not the surrounding ARE, prevented DNA binding.

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 711-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (5972) Google Scholar). GSH is required for signal transduction, immune modulation, maintenance of surfactant, remodeling of extracellular matrix, regulation of apoptosis, proliferation, mitochondrial respiration, and control of pro-inflammatory processes in the lungs (2Rahman I. MacNee Eur. Respir. J. 2000; 16: 534-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). This tripeptide is the principal antioxidant in the lung and is present in large quantities in the epithelial lining fluid, presumably due to release from type II cells (3Cantin A.M. North S.L. Hubbard R.C. Crystal R.G. J. Appl. Physiol. 1987; 63: 152-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). Several disorders, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (4Bunnel E. Pacht E.R. Am.

Dis. 1989; 139: 370-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar), are characterized by a depletion of this essential antioxidant in the airways, suggesting a role for oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of these chronic inflammatory lung diseases. The underlying causes of these diseases, in particular IPF, are unknown, and an effective antioxidant/anti-inflammatory treatment strategy remains to be developed. Recent studies have suggested that the depletion of the antioxidant defense shield in the lungs of IPF patients may leave the respiratory epithelium more susceptible to oxidant-mediated damage and subsequent fibrosis (7MacNee W. Rahman I. Thorax. 1995; 50: S53-S58Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 8Rahman I. Skwarska E. Henry M. Davis M. O'Connor C.M. FitzGerald M.X. Greening A. MacNee W. Free Rad. Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 60-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The mechanism of glutathione depletion in patients with IPF remains to be elucidated; however, there is now evidence to indicate that the cytokine transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) may be involved (9Arsalane K. Dubois C.M. Muanza T. Bégin R. Boudreau F. Asselin C. Cantin A.M. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1997; 17: 599-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). TGF-β1, which is elevated in IPF, mediates fibrosis by inducing fibroblast proliferation, differentiation, and extracellular matrix production (10Khalil N. O'Connor R.N. Unruh H.W. Warren P.W. Flanders K.C. Kemp A. Bereznay O.H. Greenberg A.H. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1991; 5: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that TGF-β1 can deplete glutathione levels in alveolar epithelial cells in vitro, although the molecular mechanisms that regulate this process have not yet been investigated. A greater understanding of the mechanism that leads to the depletion of glutathione in the lungs of IPF patients may aid the development of effective antioxidant treatment strategies. GSH formation is controlled by the actions of the enzymes γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase (γ-GCS) and glutathione synthetase, with the former enzyme catalyzing the rate-limiting step (1Meister A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 711-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (5972) Google Scholar). γ-GCS is a holoenzyme comprised of a heavy chain (γ-GCSh, 73 kDa) and a light subunit (γ-GCSl, 28 kDa), which functions to stabilize the enzyme and is therefore termed the regulatory chain (11Seelig G.F. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 9345-9347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As the entire catalytic activity of the enzyme resides within the heavy chain, regulation of glutathione synthesis is routinely considered in terms of γ-GCSh gene expression. GSH and γ-GCS expression are induced by a variety of agents, such as oxidants, phenolic antioxidants, and inflammatory mediators (12Rahman I. MacNee W. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: L1067-L1088PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism of γ-GCSh up-regulation has been extensively studied. We have previously shown that basal and inducible γ-GCSh expression in alveolar epithelial cells is controlled by a TPA (12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate)-responsive element (TRE) situated between −269 and −263 bp in the 5′-flanking region of the promoter (13Rahman I.

This early response is followed by an increase in the DNA binding activity of the transcription factor activator protein 1 (AP-1), which binds to the TRE and induces transcription of the γ-GCSh gene, resulting in elevated intracellular GSH concentrations (13Rahman I.

MacNee W. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: L1067-L1088PubMed Google Scholar, 18Dahl E.L. Mulcahy R.T. Toxicol. Sci. 2001; 61: 265-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In an elegant study, Mulcahy et al. (19Mulcahy R.T. Wartman M.A. Bailey H.H. Gipp J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7445-7454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar) have suggested that basal γ-GCSh expression in liver HepG2 cells is controlled by an antioxidant response element (ARE), which lies 3.1 kb upstream from the start of the gene. This ARE (denoted ARE4) contains an AP-1 binding site embedded within it, and subsequent studies showed that basal γ-GCSh gene expression was mediated by the TRE, whereas transcription induced by the phenolic antioxidant β-naphthoflavone was regulated by the surrounding ARE4 (20Wild A.C. Gipp J.J. Mulcahy R.T. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 373-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). All of these studies showed up-regulation of γ-GCSh expression at the transcriptional level in various cells. However, the molecular mechanism of γ-GCS down-regulation has not been investigated so far. Identification and characterization of the regulatory elements controlling transcription of γ-GCSh will provide information for the modulation of GSH synthesis in pathophysiology. The aim of this study was to determine the molecular mechanism of TGF-β1-induced glutathione depletion in human alveolar epithelial cells (A549). TGF-β1 caused a dose- and time-dependent decrease in GSH and γ-GCS activity, reduced γ-GCSh mRNA expression, and caused a rise in intracellular ROS levels. We hypothesized that TGF-β1depletes GSH by down-regulating either AP-1- or ARE4-mediated γ-GCSh gene expression. To investigate this, we employed both the short γ-GCSh 1.1-kb construct and the longer γ-GCSh 3.8-kb reporter systems, which have been used to study the regulation of γ-GCSh in various cells (13Rahman I. Smith C.A.D. Antonicelli F. MacNee W. FEBS Lett. 1998; 427: 129-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 19Mulcahy R.T. Wartman M.A. Bailey H.H. Gipp J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7445-7454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). We show that TGF-β1enhanced expression of the short γ-GCSh 1.1-kb reporter, but down-regulated the longer γ-GCSh 3.8-kb construct, indicating that the ARE4 consensus site may play a role in the inhibition of γ-GCSh by TGF-β1. Analysis of the DNA binding properties of the ARE4 consensus sequence showed a dramatic increase in binding activity and that the embedded AP-1 site, but not the surrounding ARE, was the critical response element. Supershift analysis revealed that the AP-1/ARE4 DNA binding complex was composed of c-Jun and Fra-1 dimers, AP-1 family members that have previously been shown to exert a negative effect on phase II gene expression (21Venugopal R. Jaiswal A.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14960-14965Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar). We propose a novel mechanism of γ-GCSh down-regulation, where recruitment of c-Jun/Fra-1 proteins plays a critical role in controlling GSH levels in alveolar epithelial cells. All reagents were purchased from Sigma unless stated otherwise. A549 type II lung epithelial cells were obtained from the European Collection for Animal Cell Cultures (ECACC number 86012804) and were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Labtech International), 2 mml-glutamine, 100 μg/ml penicillin, and 100 units/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen Life Technologies). The cells were grown to confluence at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2, washed with Ca2+/Mg2+-free PBS (PBS-CMF), and harvested with 0.25% trypsin, 1 mm EDTA in HBSS (Invitrogen). Following passage, the cells were seeded at a density of 2.2 × 104 cells/cm2 and cultured overnight until monolayers of 60–80% confluency were formed. The cells were then treated with TGF-β1 (R&D Systems, Oxon, UK) or solvent control (2 μm HCl with 0.5 μg/ml bovine serum albumin) for the indicated times. Monolayers of A549 cells were treated with TGF-β1 (1–5 ng/ml) or solvent control for various times (1–72 h). The cells were then washed with PBS-CMF, harvested with trypsin/EDTA, and then washed again in PBS-CMF. Total intracellular glutathione was determined according to the method of Tietze (22Tietze F. Anal. Biochem. 1969; 27: 502-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (5547) Google Scholar) using dithiobis[2-nitrobenzoic acid]-GSSG/glutathione reductase recycling, modified for a 96-well plate (23Vandeputte C. Guizon I. Genestie-Denis I. Vannier B. Lorenzon G. Cell Biol. Toxicol. 1994; 10: 415-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). The actual total concentration of glutathione in the samples was determined using linear regression to calculate the values obtained from a standard curve and expressed as nmol per mg of protein. γ-GCS activity was assessed using a coupled assay with pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase as described previously (11Seelig G.F. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 9345-9347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The rate of decrease in absorbance at 340 nm was followed at 37 °C. Enzyme specific activity was measured as mmol of NADH oxidized/min/mg protein, which is equal to 1 international unit (IU). Cells treated with TGF-β1 or solvent control for the indicated times were washed with PBS-CMF, and total cellular RNA was isolated using TRIzol Reagent® (Invitrogen) based on the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (24Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63189) Google Scholar). The RNA was reverse-transcribed, using M-MLV-RT (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and the resultant cDNA was stored at −20 °C until required. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed using oligonucleotide primers chosen from the published sequences for human γ-GCSh cDNA (25Gipp J.J. Chang C. Mulcahy R.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 185: 29-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (26Maier J.A.M. Voulalas P. Roeder D. Maciag T. Science. 1990; 249: 1570-1573Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar), and the reaction was conducted using the conditions described previously (14Rahman I. Bel A. Mulier B. Lawson M.F. Harrison D.J. MacNee W. Smith C.A.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 229: 832-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The sequences of the primers used in PCR were γ-GCSh: sense, 5′-GTG GTA CTG CTC ACC AGA GTG ATC CT-3′) and antisense, 5′-TGA TCC AAG TAA CTC TGG ACA TTC ACA-3′); GAPDH: sense, 5′-CC ACC CAT GGC AAA TTC CAT GGC A-3′ and antisense, 5′-TC TAG ACG GCA GGT CAG GTC AAC C-3′. The RT-PCR product was then resolved on a 1.5% agarose gel, and the bands were visualized using a UVP High Performance Ultraviolet Transilluminator (Laboratory Products) and Grab-IT Version 2.5 software. The intensity of the γ-GCSh mRNA bands (531 bp) was expressed as a percentage of the intensity of the GAPDH bands (600 bp) with the aid of GelBase/GelBlot software. The pKS-hGCS plasmid (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA; I.M.A.G.E clone ID 79023) was used as a positive control for γ-GCSh PCR specificity. Cells exposed to TGF-β1 or solvent control were incubated with 40 μm of the fluorescent probe dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H2DCFDA) for 30 min at 37 °C, washed with PBS-CMF, harvested, and then washed again. The degree of fluorescence, which correlated to the level of intracellular ROS, was determined using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD PharMingen) with an excitation wavelength of 530 nm (emission, 488 nm). The proportion of fluorescent cells was determined using CellQuest software (BD PharMingen) on a G3 workstation (Apple MacIntosh). The reporter construct −1050/GCSh-5′-CAT (pCBGCS) was created by cloning the fragment from −1050 to +82 bp of the human γ-GCSh promoter into the plasmid pCAT Basic Vector (Promega), which has CAT activity and has been previously described (13Rahman I. Smith C.A.D. Antonicelli F. MacNee W. FEBS Lett. 1998; 427: 129-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The recombinant plasmid −3802/GCSh-5′-Luc was a kind gift from Professor R. T. Mulcahy (University of Wisconsin), which was generated by cloning a 4.2-kb sequence of the 5′-flanking region of the human γ-GCSh promoter into the pGL3 basic vector (Promega), as described elsewhere (19Mulcahy R.T. Wartman M.A. Bailey H.H. Gipp J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7445-7454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). A549 cells were grown until they reached 60–70% confluence and were then transiently transfected with 2 μg of plasmid DNA using LipofectAMINE Reagent® (Invitrogen) for 20 h. The cells were then allowed to recover for 24 h prior to treatment with 3 ng/ml TGF-β1 or solvent control for 24 h. Following treatment, the monolayers were washed with PBS-CMF, and cellular extracts were prepared using reporter lysis buffer (Promega) for the CAT-transfected cells or luciferase lysis buffer (25 mm Tris phosphate buffer, pH 7.8, 8 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Triton X-100, 15% glycerol) for the luciferase-transfected cells. Luciferase activity was assessed immediately by adding the extracts to luciferin reagent (0.25 mm luciferin, 1% bovine serum albumin, and 1 mm ATP in luciferase lysis buffer) and measuring the degree of light intensity generated with a Biomac 2500 Luminometer. CAT activity was determined using a CAT enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Transfection efficiency was monitored by co-transfecting the cells with a β-galactosidase expression vector (PSVgal) (Promega), and β-galactosidase activity was measured in the extracts using an ELISA kit. In all experiments empty vectors were used as negative controls. Nuclear extracts were prepared on ice according to the method of Staal et al. (27Staal F.J.T. Roederer M. Herzenberg L.A. Herzenberg L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9943-9947Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar). The EMSAs were conducted using a commercially available AP-1 oligonucleotide (5′-CGC TTG ATG AGT CAG CCG GAA-3′, obtained from Promega) and oligonucleotides for ARE4 consensus and mutant sequences (20Wild A.C. Gipp J.J. Mulcahy R.T. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 373-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) (Table II) and γ-GCSh AP-1 consensus and mutant sequences (13Rahman I. Smith C.A.D. Antonicelli F. MacNee W. FEBS Lett. 1998; 427: 129-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) that were specifically synthesized (MWG Biotech, Ebersberg, Germany). Electrophoresis was conducted on 10 μg of nuclear protein as previously described (13Rahman I. Smith C.A.D. Antonicelli F. MacNee W. FEBS Lett. 1998; 427: 129-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). A549 cells treated with 10 ng/ml tumor necrosis factor-α (R&D Systems) for 24 h (15Rahman I. Antonicelli F. MacNee W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5088-5096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) or HeLa nuclear extract (Promega) served as a positive control for DNA binding, and a negative control was established by substituting the nuclear extracts for distilled water. To prove specificity of binding, the nuclear extracts were preincubated for 10 min with a 100-fold molar excess of either non-labeled AP-1, ARE4. or NF-κB oligonucleotides (Promega) prior to electrophoresis, which acted as cold- and non-competitors, respectively. To characterize the particular DNA-protein complexes, the reaction mixture described above was preincubated with 2 μl of various antibodies or appropriate preimmune sera for 2 h prior to running the gel overnight at 4 °C; the antibodies used were anti-c-Jun (KM-1), anti-c-Fos (4Bunnel E. Pacht E.R. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1993; 148: 1174-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), anti-Fra-1 (R-20), and anti-Nrf2 (C-20) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA).Table IISequences of the ARE4 consensus and mutant oligonucleotides used in this studyOligonucleotide SequenceARE4 Oligonucleotide5′-...CCCGTGACTCAGCGCTT...-3′mut 1 (ARE4 and AP-1)5′-...CCCGgGACTCAGCGCTT...-3′mut 2 (AP-1 only)5′-...CCCGTGACTtgGCGCTT...-3′mut 3 (ARE4 only)5′-...CCCGTGACTCAttGCTT...-3′ Open table in a new tab Individual experiments were conducted in triplicate, and the data represent the mean ± S.E. (n = 3) unless stated otherwise. Statistical significance was determined using one way analysis of variance with post-hoc Tukey's pairwise comparison (*, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001). Treatment of A549 epithelial cells with various amounts of TGF-β1 for 72 h caused a dose-dependent depletion of GSH (p < 0.001) (Fig. 1A). Exposure of the epithelial cells to 3 ng/ml TGF-β1 for 6 h or longer also caused a decrease in intracellular glutathione concentrations (p < 0.01 and p < 0.001) (Fig. 1B). In preliminary studies, treatment of primary rat type II epithelial cells with 5 ng/ml TGF-β1for 72 h also depleted intracellular GSH from 0.99 ± 0.01 to 0.34 ± 0.01 nmol/mg protein, a decrease of 66%. We also investigated the effects of TGF-β1 on the activity of γ-GCS, the enzyme responsible for catalyzing the rate-limiting step in glutathione formation (Fig. 2). The growth factor caused a dose-dependent reduction in γ-GCS activity when the epithelial cells were exposed for 72 h (Fig. 2A). TGF-β1 (3 ng/ml) also induced a significant decline in γ-GCS activity when the cells were treated for 24, 48, and 72 h (Fig. 2B). We examined the effects of TGF-β1 on γ-GCSh mRNA expression by RT-PCR (Fig. 3). A549 cells treated with 3 ng/ml TGF-β1 for 24, 48, and 72 h had significantly less γ-GCSh mRNA than control cells. Similar results were found in preliminary studies using primary rat type II cells that were exposed to 5 ng/ml TGF-β1 for 72 h, as γ-GCSh mRNA was reduced to 76 ± 1% of the control value. To determine the effects of GSH depletion on intracellular redox status, we measured ROS levels in epithelial cells using the fluorescent probe H2DCFDA and flow cytometry (Fig. 4A). TGF-β1 caused a dose-dependent accumulation of ROS in epithelial cells treated for 72 h (Fig. 4B). When epithelial cells were exposed to TGF-β1 (3 ng/ml) for 24, 48, and 72 h, there was also a significant increase in oxidative stress (Fig. 4C). This suggests that TGF-β1 is having a profound effect on the redox balance and that intracellular ROS may be responsible for initiating additional signaling cascades within the epithelial cells. We hypothesized that TGF-β1 inhibits γ-GCSh gene expression by exerting a negative effect on the promoter. To investigate this possibility, we employed two reporter constructs, −1050/GCSh-5′-CAT and −3802/GCSh-5′-Luc, which have previously been used to study γ-GCSh gene expression. Fig.5A shows a schematic drawing of the two reporters, detailing the relative base pair positions of the transcription factor binding sites. In each experiment a promoter-less vector control was used, but did not yield any significant reporter gene expression. TGF-β1 stimulated CAT activity, but repressed luciferase expression in alveolar epithelial cells at 24 h (Fig. 5B). This suggests a role for the ARE4 site in controlling TGF-β1-mediated down-regulation of γ-GCSh. We hypothesized that TGF-β1 may stimulate −1050/GCSh-5′-CAT by increasing AP-1 DNA binding and down-regulate −3802/GCSh-5′-Luc by reducing ARE4 activity. Surprisingly, TGF-β1 actually enhanced both AP-1 (Fig.6, A and B) and ARE4 activity (Fig. 6, C and D), with a noticeable difference after 8 h of treatment. The DNA binding activity of both responsive elements increased with time and was maximal after 72 h of treatment. TGF-β1 also increased the DNA binding activity of the native γ-GCSh AP-1-like sequence to a similar extent as commercial AP-1 (data not shown). Unlike the majority of AREs identified to date, the γ-GCSh ARE4 nucleotide sequence contains a perfect AP-1 site within it (some examples are given in Table I). We synthesized a series of ARE4 oligonucleotide mutants (20Wild A.C. Gipp J.J. Mulcahy R.T. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 373-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) in which the consensus AP-1 and ARE4 sites were changed, to determine which particular bases were required for the TGF-β1-induced effect. Table II describes the following consensus and mutant (mut) sequences: in ARE4mut1, both the AP-1 and the ARE4 consensus sites were affected; in ARE4 mut2, only the AP-1 binding site was disrupted as these bases are not required for ARE binding (28Rushmore T.H.

This DNA binding was completely eliminated by mutating both the core ARE4 and AP-1 sites (ARE4 mut1) (Fig.7A, lanes 5 and 6) or the consensus AP-1 site alone (ARE4 mut2) (Fig. 7A, lanes 7 and 8). Mutation of the consensus ARE4 sequence (ARE4mut3) (Fig. 7A, lanes 9 and 10) did not prevent DNA binding; however, the intensity of the bands for both the control and TGF-β1-treated extracts is slightly diminished. To confirm these findings, the commercial AP-1 and mutated ARE4 oligonucleotides were used as cold competitors to establish whether or not they could compete with the consensus ARE4 oligonucleotide for DNA binding.

We now report that PIMT strongly interacts with transcriptional coactivators, CBP, p300, and PBP but not with SRC-1 and PGC-1α under in vitro and in vivo conditions. The PIMT binding sites on CBP and p300 are located in the cysteine-histidine-rich C/H1 and C/H3 domains, and the PIMT binding site on PBP is in the region encompassing amino acids 1101–1560. The N-terminal of PIMT (residues 1–369) containing the RNA binding domain interacts with both C/H1 and C/H3 domains of CBP and p300 and with the C-terminal portion of PBP that encompasses amino acids 1371–1560. The C-terminal of PIMT (residues 611–852), which binds S-adenosyl-l-methionine, interacts respectively with the C/H3 domain of CBP/p300 and with a region encompassing amino acids 1101–1370 of PBP. Immunoprecipitation data showed that PIMT forms a complex in vivo with CBP, p300, PBP, and PRIP. PIMT appeared to be co-localized in the nucleus with CBP, p300, and PBP. PIMT enhanced PBP-mediated transcriptional activity of the PPARγ, as it did for PRIP, indicating synergism between PIMT and PBP. In contrast, PIMT functioned as a repressor of CBP/p300-mediated transactivation of PPARγ. Based on these observations, we suggest that PIMT bridges the CBP/p300-anchored coactivator complex with the PBP-anchored coactivator complex but differentially modulates coactivator function such that inhibition of the CBP/p300 effect may be designed to enhance the activity of PBP and PRIP.

Liganded nuclear receptors participate in diverse biological processes by controlling gene expression patterns in a cell-specific manner. This is accomplished by interacting with specific response elements (DNA sequence) located in the promoter regions of target genes, by recruiting transcriptional cofactors that function in nucleosome remodeling, and by recruiting RNA polymerase II holoenzyme to initiate transcription (1Mangelsdorf D.J.

These coactivators also recruit other proteins with HAT activity to form a multiprotein complex anchored by CBP/p300. This complex regulates transcription through remodeling chromatin by acetylating histones (30Blanco J.C. Minucci S., Lu, J. Yang X-J. Walker K. Chen H. Evans R.M. Nakatani Y. Ozato K. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1638-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Recently, coactivator-associated enhancement of transcription has also been shown to involve the recruitment of coactivator-associated proteins such as coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1 (CARM1), a member of the S-adenosyl-l-methionine-dependent, protein arginine methyltransferase (PRMT) family (31Chen D., Ma, H. Hong H. Koh S.S. Huang S-M. Schurter B.T. Aswad D.W. Stallcup M.R. Science. 1999; 284: 2174-2177Crossref PubMed Scopus (983) Google Scholar). CARM1 catalyzes the methylation of arginine residues particularly in histone 3 (31Chen D., Ma, H. Hong H. Koh S.S. Huang S-M. Schurter B.T. Aswad D.W. Stallcup M.R. Science. 1999; 284: 2174-2177Crossref PubMed Scopus (983) Google Scholar). The PRMT family consists of at least five members (PRMT1, PRMT2, PRMT3, PRMT4/CARM1, and PRMT5) (32Koh S.S. Chen D. Lee Y-H. Stallcup M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1089-1098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar) of which CARM1/PRMT4 is known to enhance the function of the p160 family of coactivators by increasing nuclear receptor-dependent gene transcription. CARM1/PRMT4 does this by binding to and methylating the KIX domain of CBP/p300 in addition to its initially described role in histone 3 methylation (33Xu W. Chen H., Du, K. Asahara H. Tini M. Emerson B.M. Montminy M. Evans R.M. Science. 2001; 294: 2507-2511Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). The KIX domain-methylated CBP/p300 fails to activate CREB-dependent genes. Therefore, the CBP/p300 is able to direct nuclear receptor-dependent gene transcription (33Xu W. Chen H., Du, K. Asahara H. Tini M. Emerson B.M. Montminy M. Evans R.M. Science. 2001; 294: 2507-2511Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). From these observations it appears that histone acetylation, histone methylation, and selective coactivator methylation (namely CBP/p300 methylation) constitute novel regulatory mechanisms that involve the CBP/p300-anchored coactivator complex in nuclear receptor-mediated gene transcription. The next step in the multistep transcriptional activation process involves participation of the TRAP/DRIP/ARC mediator complex anchored by the coactivator PBP (4Malik S. Roeder R.G. Trends Biochem.

While CBP/p300 and the p160 family of cofactors that form the initial multiprotein complex function by exhibiting HAT and arginine methyltransferase activities, there is limited functional information about the coactivator PBP and other proteins that form the TRAP/DRIP/ARC complex. This complex facilitates interaction with RNA polymerase II complexes of the basal transcriptional machinery, but how this is accomplished remains unclear (4Malik S. Roeder R.G. Trends Biochem.

PBP lacks HAT activity, and it is uncertain if the other members of the TRAP/DRIP/ARC complex in mammals possess enzymatic activity of any kind. Disruption of the PBP and CBP/p300 genes in the mouse results in embryonic lethality around E11.5 days, indicating that disruption of these pivotal anchoring coactivators affects the function of many nuclear receptors and possibly other transcription factors (27Crawford S.E., Qi, C.

Thus, PRIP appears to serve as a bridge between the initial histone acetyltransferase-histone methyltransferase complex of CBP/p300 and p160 coactivators and the downstream TRAP/DRIP/ARC complex. Disruption of this PRIP gene in the mouse leads to embryonic lethality around E13.5 days, implying that PRIP (like CBP/p300 and PBP) is also critical for embryonic development and survival. 2C. Qi and J. K. Reddy, unpublished observations.2C. Qi and J. K. Reddy, unpublished observations. We have previously isolated a PRIP-interacting protein, designated PIMT, using the yeast two-hybrid approach with PRIP as bait. We found that PIMT enhances the nuclear receptor coactivator function of PRIP (41Zhu Y., Qi, C. Cao W-Q. Yeldandi A.V. Rao M.S. Reddy J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

PIMT, which has an invariant G XXG XXI segment found in K-homology motifs and many RNA-binding proteins, binds RNA (41Zhu Y., Qi, C. Cao W-Q. Yeldandi A.V. Rao M.S. Reddy J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10380-10385Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). PIMT also has a nine amino acid VVDAFCGVG methyltransferase motif I and binds S-adenosyl-l-methionine, the methyl donor for the methyltransfer reaction, suggesting that it may be a putative RNA methyltransferase (41Zhu Y., Qi, C.

We report here that PIMT interacts with CBP, p300, and PBP but not with SRC-1 and PGC-1α, suggesting that PIMT functions as a link between the two major multiprotein complexes anchored by CBP/p300 and PBP, respectively. Of considerable interest is that while PIMT enhances the PRIP and PBP-mediated nuclear receptor transcriptional activity, it inhibits the CBP/p300-mediated nuclear receptor function. pCDNA3.1-PIMT, pCDNA3.1-PIMT (aa 1–369), pGEX-PIMT (aa 577–852), pGEX-PIMT (aa 326–852), pCMV-3XFLAG-PIMT, pCMX-PBP, pCDNA3.1-PRIP, pCDNA3.1-SRC1, pCMV-p300, 3XPPRE-Luc, and pCMV-PPARγ1 have been described (41Zhu Y., Qi, C.

Spiegelman. pCDNA3.1-CBP-HA was constructed by subcloning the HindIII-NotI fragment containing the entire coding region of CBP from pRC/RSV-CBP.HA into pCDNA3.1. Sequences encoding peptide fragments of entire CBP, p300 and PBP fused to glutathione S-transferase (GST) (hereafter GST-CBP, GST-p300, and GST-PBP) were generated by subcloning respective PCR fragments amplified from the appropriate plasmids into the correct reading frame of pGEX4T1 (Amersham Biosciences). GST-PIMT (aa 1–334), pCDNA3.1-PIMT (aa 370–610), and pCDNA3.1 PIMT (aa 611–852) were generated by subcloning PCR fragments into the pGEX and pCDNA3.1, respectively. Sequences of all clones were verified by sequencing. To construct recombinant adenovirus-PIMT (Ad/PIMT), the full-length PIMT coding region was cloned by PCR from plasmid pCMV-PIMT (41Zhu Y., Qi, C.

The entire coding region of PIMT with the hexahistidine affinity tag was cut with RsrII/XhoI and transferred to the SalI site of pShuttle vector (Quantum Biotechnologies, Inc.) by blunting the ends. The recombinant Ad/PIMT was generated as described previously (42Yu S. Cao W-Q. Kashireddy P. Meyer K. Jia Y. Hughes D.E. Tan Y. Feng J. Yeldandi A.V. Rao M.S. Costa R.H. Gonzalez F.J. Reddy J.K. J.

GST fusions or GST alone was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) and incubated with [35S]methionine-labeled coactivator/coactivator-binding protein expressed by in vitro translation by using the TnT-coupled transcription-translation system (Promega). Briefly, the binding assays were carried out by incubating 10 μl of [35S]methionine-labeled coactivator/coactivator-binding protein for 2 h at 4 °C with the immobilized GST fusion protein in GST binding buffer (180 mm KCl, 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.9, 1 mm EDTA, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Beads were washed four times with 1 ml of binding buffer containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and bound protein was eluted by boiling for 2 min in 20 μl of SDS sample buffer, was analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and was subjected to autoradiography. COS-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and transfected with pCMV-PIMT-FLAG plasmid encoding FLAG-tagged PIMT along with one of the coactivator expression plasmids. After 72 h cells were harvested and lysed at 4 °C by vortexing in lysis buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 250 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA) containing protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 18,000 ×g for 20 min and immunoprecipitated at 4 °C for 2 h with anti-CBP, anti-p300, anti-PBP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or anti-PRIP, respectively, followed by precipitation with 50 μl of protein A/G-Sepharose (Sigma) overnight at 4 °C. After four washes with lysis buffer (described above), the immunoprecipitates were eluted by boiling for 5 min in Laemmli sample buffer. Resulting immunoprecipitates were electrophoresed in 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane, immunoblotted with anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody M2 (Sigma), and detected using ECL chemiluminescence (AmershamBiosciences). Alternatively, PIMT-binding proteins were immunoprecipitated from HEK293 cells that were infected with Ad/PIMT or Ad/LacZ. HEK293 cells were cultured to 95% confluence in 150-cm plates. The cells were at first incubated with 10 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum with Ad/PIMT or Ad/LacZ respectively at a multiplicity of infection of 100. After 1.5 h, 35 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum was added. Infected HEK293 cells were harvested 24 h after infection. The cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-His tag (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) followed by precipitation with protein A/G-Sepharose as described above and immunoblotted with anti-CBP, anti-p300, anti-PRIP, and anti-PBP. The antigen-antibody complexes were then detected using the alkaline phosphatase-conjugated substrate kit (Bio-Rad). COS-1 cells were transfected with pCMV-PIMT-FLAG along with one of the coactivator expression plasmids, namely CBP, p300, and PBP using Polyfect (Qiagen). After 48 h transfection, the cells were washed and fixed in 1% formaldehyde and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, after which autofluorescence was quenched with 50 mm ammonium chloride in phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, and then blocked with 0.2% fish skin gelatin. Cells were incubated with the primary antibody anti-FLAG (Sigma) along with one of the antibodies (anti-CBP, anti-p300, or anti-PBP) followed by incubation with secondary antibodies. Fluorescence microscopy and digital image collection were performed by using an Olympus (New Hyde Park, NY) microscope and a photometrix cooled charge-coupled device camera driven by DELTAVISION software from Applied Precision (Seattle). CV1 cells (for CBP transactivation) and HEK293 cells (for p300 and PBP transactivation) were plated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum without antibiotics in six well plates and cultured for 24 h before transfection. Transfections were carried out with LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions for 5 h. Each transfection contains 20 ηg of PPAR expression vector, 1.5 μg of luciferase reporter plasmid DNA, 0.1 μg of β-galactosidase expression vector, and 1 μg of appropriate expression vector. Cell extracts were analyzed 24 h after transfection for luciferase and β-galactosidase activities (Tropix). Previously, we have shown that PIMT interacts with PRIP (41Zhu Y., Qi, C. Cao W-Q.

These integral membrane proteins assemble within the endoplasmic reticulum of infected cells and are subsequently endoproteolyzed in the Golgi, generating noncovalently associated S1 and S2 fragments. Once on the surface of infected cells and virions, peripheral S1 fragments bind carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule (CEACAM) receptors, and this triggers membrane fusion reactions mediated by integral membrane S2 fragments. We focused on the quaternary structure of S and its interaction with CEACAMs. We discovered that soluble S1 fragments were dimers and that CEACAM binding was entirely dependent on this quaternary structure. However, two differentially tagged CEACAMs could not co-precipitate with the S dimers, suggesting that binding sites were closely juxtaposed in the dimer (steric hindrance) or that a single CEACAM generated global conformational changes that precluded additional interactions (negative cooperativity). CEACAM binding did indeed alter S1 conformations, generating alternative disulfide linkages that were revealed on SDS gels. CEACAM binding also induced separation of S1 and S2. Differentially tagged S2 fragments that were free of S1 dimers were not co-precipitated, suggesting that S1 harbored the primary oligomerization determinants. We discuss the distinctions between the S·CEACAM interaction and other virus-receptor complexes involved in receptor-triggered entry.

For enveloped viruses, efficient infection requires a regulated coalescence of virion and cellular membranes. Temporal and spatial regulation of this membrane fusion event must occur for viral genomes to enter into a milieu suitable for subsequent replicative processes. Protruding virion glycoproteins, each poised to induce membrane coalescence, have therefore evolved sensitivities to the environmental conditions found at entry sites. These conditions trigger coordinated and irreversible changes in virion glycoprotein conformations that can culminate in membrane fusion. Well known triggers for conformational change include cellular receptor binding (1Hernandez L.D. Hoffman L.R. Wolfsberg T.G. White J.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

Because the distinct species specificity and tissue tropism of coronavirus strains largely correlate with changes in the spike (S) protein (9Sanchez C.M. Izeta A. Sanchez-Morgado J.M. Alonso S.

Within the trans-Golgi network, a furin-like protease cleaves the full-length spike into two similar-sized fragments, a peripheral S1, and a membrane-anchored S2 (14Sturman L.S. Ricard C.S. Holmes K.V. J. Virol. 1985; 56: 904-911Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Frana M.F. Behnke J.N. Sturman L.S. Holmes K.V. J. Virol. 1985; 56: 912-920Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). S1, which associates with S2 through noncovalent interactions, is responsible for binding to cellular receptors. S2 contains the core machinery necessary for membrane fusion (16Yoo D.W. Parker M.D. Babiuk L.A. Virology. 1991; 180: 395-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Receptors for the MHV S proteins include numerous members of thecarcinoembryogenic antigen-relatedcell adhesion molecule (CEACAM) family, immunoglobulin-like glycoproteins that serve as entry portals for a relatively wide variety of pathogens (17Dveksler G.S.

The prototype receptor for MHV, murine CEACAM isoform 1a, is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein with four Ig-like ectodomains designated as N (amino-terminal)-A1a-Ba-A2a (22Beauchemin N. Draber P. Dveksler G. Gold P. Gray-Owen S. Hammarstrom S. Holmes K.V. Karlsson A. Kuorki M. Lin S.-H. Lucka L. Najjar S.M. Neumaier M. Obrink B. Shively J.E. Skubitz K.M. Stanners C.P. Thomas P. Thompson J.A. Virji M.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 252: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). The N-domain binds to S proteins (17Dveksler G.S. Pensiero M.N. Dieffenbach C.W. Cardellichio C.B. Basile A.A. Elia P.E. Holmes K.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1716-1720Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). After binding to a soluble N-CEACAM fragment, spikes undergo a conformational change that can, in some cases, be revealed as S1 shedding from S2 (23Krueger D.K. Kelly S.M. Lewicki D.N. Ruffolo R. Gallagher T.M. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 2792-2802Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). This structural change may be relevant to MHV entry, as S1 separation from S2 correlates with increased membrane fusion activity (23Krueger D.K. Kelly S.M. Lewicki D.N. Ruffolo R. Gallagher T.M. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 2792-2802Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). A conservative view is that the CEACAM binding to S releases free energy that drives the conformational changes required to promote coalescence of the virus and cell membranes. Indeed, soluble forms of CEACAM can, through binding S proteins, increase the propensity of S to fuse membranes (24Taguchi F. Matsuyama S. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 950-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Understanding the connections between CEACAM binding and membrane fusion depends in part on a view of the actual CEACAM-binding site(s) on the S protein. Kubo et al. (25Kubo H. Yamada Y.K. Taguchi F. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 5403-5410Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar) mapped the CEACAM-binding sites to the amino-terminal 330 residues of S1, but high resolution protein structures are currently unknown. Questions also remain concerning quaternary structures, both S dimers and trimers have been proposed (13Vennema H. Rottier P.J.M. Heijnen L. Godeke G.J. Horzinek M.C. Spaan W.J.M. Cananaugh D. Brown T.D.K. Coronavirus and Their Diseases. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1990: 9-19Google Scholar, 26Delmas B. Laude H. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 5367-5375Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, we embarked on studies assessing the oligomeric organization of S and S·CEACAM complexes. Here we report that S1, when shed from S2 or when produced independently from cDNAs, exists stably as a dimer. We discovered that S1 dimers, but not monomers, will bind to CEACAM receptors. In fact, we found that the region conferring dimerization resides at or near the CEACAM1a-binding site, an unexpected finding because oligomerization determinants in functionally analogous spike proteins of other viruses reside within the integral membrane fragments (27Wilson I.A.

Remarkably, only one CEACAM bound each S1 dimer, and we identified a novel disulfide-linked S1 conformation in S1·CEACAM complexes. Our findings refine the current understanding of CEACAM receptors as mediators of conformational change, and they form the basis for a preliminary model of receptor-triggered entry with both parallels and deviations from established paradigms for enveloped virus entry (36Weissenhorn W.

HeLa-tTA and rabbit kidney clone 13 (RK13) cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS). 293 EBNA cells secreting N-CEACAMFc (formerly known as sMHVR-Ig) (42Gallagher T.M. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 3129-3137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were grown in DMEM, 10% FCS containing the antibiotics G418 (100 μg/ml) and hygromycin B (200 μg/ml). We used murine CEACAM1a cDNA (22Beauchemin N. Draber P. Dveksler G. Gold P. Gray-Owen S. Hammarstrom S. Holmes K.V. Karlsson A. Kuorki M. Lin S.-H. Lucka L. Najjar S.M. Neumaier M. Obrink B.

Virol. 1997; 71: 3129-3137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as template for PCR amplification of N-CEACAM6×His, using the primer 5′ GTCGAGTCAGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGTACATGAAATCG 3′, which encodes a hexahistidine tag. We used cDNA of S (strain JHM) (43Parker S.E. Gallagher T.M. Buchmeier M.J. Virology. 1989; 173: 664-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) as a template for PCR amplification of S gene and truncated S fragments. To create ST212S/Y214S/Y216S, mutagenic oligonucleotides 5′ GGTGGTTCTTTTTCTGCGTCCTATGCGGAT 3′ and its complement were used in PCRs. To generate enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-tagged spikes, we engineered pTM1-S (42Gallagher T.M. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 3129-3137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with a unique NotI restriction site using the following oligonucleotide: 5′ GGGCTCGAGTCAGCGGCCGCTCACAGGGATCCAGTGCATCCTCATGGGC 3′. EGFP DNA was PCR-amplified from pEGFP (Clontech), and 741-nucleotide Not-I/BamHI restriction fragment was cloned into the aforementioned pTM1-S(NotI). Mutations in the CEACAM and S genes were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Restriction fragment exchanges with the vaccinia virus insertion-expression vector pTM1-S and pTM3-S1 were all performed as described previously (42Gallagher T.M. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 3129-3137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All recombinant plasmids were cloned and amplified in E. coli DH5α (for pTM1 vector) or HB101 (for pTM3 vector). Plasmids pTM1-SΔDPR2 (23Krueger D.K. Kelly S.M. Lewicki D.N. Ruffolo R. Gallagher T.M. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 2792-2802Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and pTM1-SEGFP were used directly, without recombination into vaccinia vectors. The SEGFP protein includes the entire SΔDPR2 followed by an eight-residue linker (ALDPPVAT) and a C-terminal 238-residue EGFP. Plasmids were recombined into the thymidine kinase (TK) gene of vaccinia virus (strain WR) by standard methods (44Mackett M. Smith G.L. Moss B. J. Virol. 1984; 49: 857-864Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and TK-negative virus isolates were amplified in RK13 cells. TK-negative virus stocks were screened for S or CEACAM cDNA expression by co-infection with vTF7.3 (45Fuerst T.R. Earl P.L. Moss B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2538-2544Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar) and immunoblot detection of the respective proteins in cell lysates, as described previously (23Krueger D.K. Kelly S.M. Lewicki D.N. Ruffolo R. Gallagher T.M. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 2792-2802Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). We used the following vaccinia recombinants: vTM3-S1 (encodes 769-residue S1 of JHM strain); vTM3-S1330(encodes 330-residue amino-terminal S1 fragment); vTM3-S1ΔDPR1 (encodes S1 with internal deletion of residues 446–598); vTM3-S1ΔDPR2 (encodes S1 with internal deletion of residues 429–586); vTM1-SECTO(encodes 1320 residue S1/S2 lacking transmembrane span and cytoplasmic tail); vTM1-ST212S/Y214S/Y216S (encodes full-length S of JHM strain with the indicated substitutions); vTM3-CEACAMECTO (encodes N-A1-B-A2 Ig-like domains of CEACAM); vTM3-N-CEACAM6×His (encodes N-domain of CEACAM with 6 carboxyl-terminal histidines). To obtain N-CEACAMFc, 293 EBNA:N-CEACAMFc cells (42Gallagher T.M. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 3129-3137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were incubated overnight in serum-free DMEM. Culture supernatant was collected, filtered through a 0.22-μm membrane, dialyzed against PBS-P (PBS (pH 7.4) containing 0.01% protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma)), and concentrated 100-fold by ultrafiltration. In some cases, N-CEACAMFc was further purified by affinity chromatography on Sepharose-protein G (Amersham Biosciences). Supernatants typically yielded ∼2 μg of N-CEACAMFc per ml. To obtain 35S-labeled recombinant S proteins and CEACAMECTO, monolayers of HeLa-tTA cells were inoculated at 2 plaque-forming units/cell for 1 h at 37 °C with vTF7.3 and the respective recombinant vaccinia viruses. At 6 h post-infection, the medium was replaced with labeling media (DMEM, 1% dialyzed FCS lacking cysteine and methionine). After 1 h, the labeling media was replaced with serum-free labeling media supplemented with 25 μCi/ml Tran35S-label (ICN). After a 5-h incubation, the harvested media were clarified by centrifugation, dialyzed, and concentrated ∼100-fold by ultrafiltration as described above. S proteins were collected from media or from cytoplasmic extracts. Extracts were obtained by lysing infected cell monolayers with PBS-P containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40, followed by removal of nuclei by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 15 min. S proteins were immunoprecipitated with N-CEACAMFc, with polyclonal anti-JHM serum (R33 serum, a gift from Dr. Stanley Perlman, University of Iowa), or with monoclonal anti-S antibody J.2.6 (J.2.6 hybridoma (46Fleming J.O. Stohlman S.A. Harmon R.C. Lai M.M.C. Frelinger J.A. Werner L.P. Virology. 1983; 131: 296-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), a gift from Dr. John Fleming, University of Wisconsin, Madison) or with monoclonal anti-S antibody number 2 (a gift from Dr. Fumihiro Taguchi, National Institute of Neuroscience, Tokyo, Japan). Briefly, these Igs were bound for 4 h at 4 °C to Gamma Bind G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). The beads were then rinsed three times with PBS-P by centrifugation and resuspension. After overnight incubation at 4 °C with media or cytoplasmic extracts, beads were rinsed by five cycles of centrifugation and resuspension with PBS-P containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40. The final bead pellets were mixed with SDS solubilizer (2% SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol (β-ME), 2.5% Ficoll, 0.005% bromphenol blue) for 5 min at 100 °C. Dissolved proteins were then visualized after SDS-PAGE by fluorography or immunoblotting, as described previously (23Krueger D.K. Kelly S.M. Lewicki D.N. Ruffolo R. Gallagher T.M. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 2792-2802Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Samples containing35S-labeled S1 or S1·CEACAM complexes were overlaid onto linear 5 ml of 5–20% w/w sucrose gradients in PBS-P containing 0.01% BSA. A parallel gradient was overlaid with an extract containing the sedimentation markers horseradish peroxidase (HRPO 4 S), human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG 7 S), and E. coliβ-galactosidase (16 S). After sedimentation at 55,000 rpm at 5 °C for 5.95 h in a Beckman Spinco SW55 rotor, fractions (20 per gradient) were collected. The S proteins in gradient fractions were then immunoprecipitated and visualized by fluorography after SDS-PAGE. Sedimentation standards were identified in the fractions by enzymatic assays (HRPO by turnover of 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid substrate; IgG by immunoblotting with goat anti-human IgG:alkaline phosphatase; β-galactosidase by turnover of chlorophenol red-β-d-galactopyranoside substrate). Dithiobis(succinimidylproprionate) (DSP) (25 mm in dimethyl sulfoxide) was added at various dilutions to35S-labeled S1 in PBS (pH 7.4). After 30 min at 22 °C, reactions were quenched with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0). The35S-labeled S1 proteins were then immunoprecipitated with N-CEACAMFc, eluted with SDS solubilizer lacking β-ME, electrophoresed on a 4–20% polyacrylamide gradient gel under reducing and non-reducing conditions, and then visualized via fluorography. vTF7.3-infected HeLa-tTA cells were lipofected with pTM1-S and with pTM1-SEFGP, alone or together, using LipofectAMINE PLUS according to manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). At 4 h post-lipofection, media were removed and replaced for 1 h with labeling media and then 5 h with labeling media containing 25 μCi/ml Tran35S-label. Cell monolayers were lysed with PBS-P (pH 8.5) containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation (3000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C). To separate 35S-labeled S1 from S2, leaving S1 associated with Sepharose beads,35S-labeled S proteins in clarified cytoplasmic extracts were captured by incubation for 4 h at 4 °C with Sepharose G:N-CEACAMFc beads, and suspensions were incubated for an additional 4 h at 37 °C before pelleting beads (3000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C). Supernatants enriched in S2 were further depleted of residual S1 by two additional cycles of incubation with fresh Sepharose G:N-CEACAMFcbeads. The final supernatants were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with Sepharose G:anti-GFP antiserum to capture S2EGFPfragments. Beads were rinsed extensively with PBS-P containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40, suspended in SDS solubilizer, and heated to 100 °C for 5 min. Dissolved proteins were visualized by immunoblot with anti-S2 mAb 10G (a gift from Drs. Stuart Siddell and Fumihiro Taguchi) (47Routledge E. Stauber R. Pfleiderer M. Siddell S.G. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 254-262Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) after SDS-PAGE. Fluorograms of immunoblots were obtained using a Molecular Dynamics Typhoon 8600 PhosphorImager. It is still unclear whether coronavirus peplomers are dimers or trimers. Vennema et al. (13Vennema H. Rottier P.J.M. Heijnen L. Godeke G.J. Horzinek M.C. Spaan W.J.M. Cananaugh D. Brown T.D.K. Coronavirus and Their Diseases. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1990: 9-19Google Scholar) reported that MHV spikes are dimers, and Delmas and Laude (26Delmas B. Laude H. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 5367-5375Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) provided evidence for cross-linking of transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus spikes into trimers. Noting the importance of quaternary structure in viral glycoprotein function, we decided to return to the question of S protein oligomerization in the MHV system. We initially used velocity gradient ultracentrifugation and chemical cross-linking to determine the quaternary structure of peripheral S1 fragments. We found that S1 produced independently from cDNA sedimented to an ∼9 S position on sucrose gradients (Fig. 1A). Identical results were obtained for S1 fragments that had separated from S2 (data not shown). Formulas based on isokinetic sedimentation of globular proteins indicated that the ∼9 S material would have a molecular mass of ∼200 kDa, consistent with S1 homodimers (48Young B.D. Rickwood D. Centrifugation: A Practical Approach. 2nd Ed. IRL Press, Washington D. C.1984: 127-140Google Scholar). However, elongated molecules like the coronavirus spike peplomer (49Cavanagh D. Siddell S.G. The Coronaviridae. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1995: 73-103Crossref Google Scholar) might exhibit unusual sedimentation behavior in sucrose gradients; therefore, we further addressed quaternary structure by cross-linking35S-labeled S1 with DSP, a thiol-cleavable chemical cross-linker. Cross-linked spikes were then immunoprecipitated and electrophoresed under non-reducing and reducing conditions (Fig. 1B). S1 dimers appeared with increasing concentrations of DSP, and β-ME reduced these dimers into monomers. Extraordinarily high DSP concentrations (25 mm) did not complex35S-labeled S1 into higher order oligomers (data not shown). In previous experiments, we found that polyclonal anti-spike antibodies captured newly synthesized35S-labeled S proteins, whereas N-CEACAMFc, an immunoadhesion consisting of the N-domain of murine CEACAM1a linked to a carboxyl-terminal IgG1 Fc, did not. The 35S-labeled spikes bound N-CEACAMFc only after ∼30 min of maturation (23Krueger D.K. Kelly S.M. Lewicki D.N. Ruffolo R. Gallagher T.M. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 2792-2802Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). One possible explanation for this finding was that S proteins oligomerized during the 30-min maturation process and that soluble receptors only recognized oligomers. This contention was consistent with numerous reports that glycoprotein oligomerization is required to maintain native tertiary structures (50Doms R.W. Lamb R.A. Rose J.K. Helenius A. Virology. 1993; 19: 545-562Crossref Scopus (416) Google Scholar,51Tatu U. Hammond C. Helenius A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1340-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Therefore, we separated newly synthesized spikes by rate-zonal sedimentation through sucrose gradients prior to immunoprecipitation and detection on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Polyclonal anti-spike serum captured a range of spike forms from ∼6 S to ∼14 S (Fig. 2, 0 hour anti-S). In contrast, N-CEACAMFc specifically immunoprecipitated ∼14 S macromolecules (Fig. 2, 0 hour N-CEACAMFc). When a 2-h chase period occurred prior to cell lysis and sedimentation, N-CEACAMFc and anti-S antiserum captured only the ∼14 S forms (Fig. 2, 2 hour panels). The two endoproteolytic cleavage products S1 (lower band) and S2 (upper band) indicated that most of the spikes had encountered a trans-Golgi-localized furin-like protease (14Sturman L.S. Ricard C.S. Holmes K.V. J. Virol. 1985; 56: 904-911Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These findings indicate that newly synthesized S proteins form CEACAM-binding sites concomitant with their oligomerization. We next considered whether CEACAM-binding sites disappeared when S proteins dissociated into monomers. We could address this question because our S1 preparations moderately break down when incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. On sucrose gradient sedimentation, the 37 °C-treated S1 occupied two positions, ∼9 S and ∼6 S, with ∼6 S being consistent with 110-kilodalton monomers (48Young B.D. Rickwood D. Centrifugation: A Practical Approach. 2nd Ed. IRL Press, Washington D. C.1984: 127-140Google Scholar) (Fig. 3, top panel). N-CEACAMFc only precipitated the ∼9 S material (Fig. 3,bottom panel), suggesting that monomers do not contain a CEACAM-binding site. Interestingly, soluble ectodomain fragments of S2 co-sedimented with the ∼6 S S1 monomers in these gradients.

When stimulated by its putative physiological agonist, α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH) inhibits feeding in mice through MC4R. Furthermore, mice with MC4R deletion develop hyperphagia, hyperinsulinism, and obesity (4Huszar D. Lynch C.A. Fairchild-Huntress V. Dunmore J.H. Fang Q. Berkemeier L.R., Gu, W. Kesterson R.A.

MC4R mutations may play a particularly important role in the early onset of childhood obesity, resulting in more severe obesity-related complications, such as hypertension and diabetes, when compared with late onset obesity found in adults (8Vaisse C.

In light of these findings, the molecular basis of the role that MC4R plays in obesity has been the subject of intense investigation.Many new, potent, and enzyme-resistant analogs of melanocortin peptides have been developed based on the extensive studies of the melanocortin peptide, α-MSH (10Sawyer T.K. Sanfilippo P.J. Hruby V.J. Engel M.H. Heward C.B. Burnett J.B. Hadley M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 5754-5758Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar, 11Sawyer T.K. Hruby V.J.

These include NDP-MSH ([Nle4-d-Phe7]α-MSH) and melanotan II (MTII, the lactam Ac-Nle4cycle[Asp-His6-d-Phe7-Arg8-Trp9-Lys10]amide), which have been identified as potent, non-selective agonists at human melanocortin-1, -3, -4, and -5 receptors. In addition, the analog, SHU9119, a synthetic peptide with a β-(2-naphthyl)-d-alanine (d-Nal) substituted in position 7 of MTII, has been found to be a potent but non-selective antagonist for the MC3 and MC4 receptors (13Hruby V.J., Lu, D.

Intracerebroventricular administration of MTII has been found to induce weight loss, whereas SHU9119 has been found to increase animal food intake and body weight (15Thiele T.E. van Dijk G.

Structure-function studies of NDP-MSH have demonstrated that d-Phe-Arg-Trp of NDP-MSH is the minimal peptide required for hMC4R binding and activation. Furthermore, the conserved residues in the third transmembrane (TM3) and the sixth transmembrane (TM6) domains of melanocortin receptors have been found to be involved in NDP-MSH and MTII binding (18Yang Y.K. Fong T.M. Dickinson C.J. Mao C. Li J.Y. Tota M.R. Mosley R. van der Ploeg L.H. Gantz I. Biochemisty. 2000; 39: 14900-14911Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Mutation of the conserved MC4R TM3 residues aspartic acids 122 and 126 and TM6 residues phenylalanine 261 and histidine 264 significantly decrease the binding affinity and potency of NDP-MSH and MTII (18Yang Y.K. Fong T.M. Dickinson C.J. Mao C. Li J.Y. Tota M.R. Mosley R. van der Ploeg L.H. Gantz I. Biochemisty. 2000; 39: 14900-14911Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Little information is available, however, regarding the molecular basis of hMC4R interaction with the antagonist SHU9119. Whether SHU9119 utilizes the same hMC4R-binding site as NDP-MSH and MTII is unknown. To gain insight into the molecular determinants of hMC4R responsible for SHU9119 selectivity, and particularly to define hMC4R residues essential for SHU9119 antagonist selectivity, we have taken a broad approach to investigating the role of the transmembrane amino acid residues of MC4R in discriminating between MTII and SHU9119 receptor activation. Chimeras and mutants of MC4R were constructed and studied. We hope this approach will provide valuable insight into the molecular basis of ligand-receptor interaction between hMC4R as well as SHU9119 and provide new information for rational drug design of selective MC4R agonists and antagonists.DISCUSSIONHypothalamic MC4R plays an important role in the regulation of animal food intake. The melanocortin receptor agonist, MTII, and antagonist SHU9119 have been widely used in the study of MC receptor functions (20Jonsson L. Skarphedinsson J.O. Skuladottir G.V. Atlason P.T. Eiriksdottir V.H. Franzson L. Schioth H.B. Neuroreport. 2001; 12: 3703-3708Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 21Schioth H.B. Muceniece R. Mutulis F. Prusis P. Lindeberg G. Sharma S.D.

Analg. 2001; 93: 1572-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The identification of the essential amino acid residues of human MC4R responsible for SHU9119 antagonism should be important for understanding the signaling events that regulate the melanocortin system under physiologic circumstances. In addition, a molecular understanding of SHU9119 activity at hMC4R may have important implications in the design of drugs that may regulate feeding behavior in conditions such as obesity or anorexia.The natural melanocortins (α-MSH, β-MSH, γ-MSH, and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)) and synthetic melanocortins (NDP-MSH, MTII, and SHU9119) have distinct affinity profiles for each of the five MC receptor subtypes. The natural melanocortins are all agonists for hMCRs with the exception of MC2R, for which only ACTH is a full agonist (23Schioth H.B. Chhajlani V. Muceniece R. Klusa V. Wikberg J.E. Life Sci. 1996; 59: 797-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). However, synthetic melanocortins have different pharmacological profiles for the five MC receptor subtypes. For example, NDP-MSH and MTII are agonists for all human MC receptor subtypes except hMC2R (24Haskell-Luevano C. Nikiforovich G. Sharma S.D. Yang Y.K. Dickinson C. Hruby V.J. Gantz I. J. Med. Chem. 1997; 40: 1738-1748Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The varying pharmacological profiles of the five MC receptor subtypes suggest that they have different ligand-binding sites and/or utilize different residues for binding and functional selectivity. The identification of the role that the amino acid residue Phe7 plays in MSH binding and activity led to the discovery of SHU9119, in which a bulky hydrophobic amino acid in position 7 of MTII converts the peptide from an agonist to an antagonist at the MC3R and MC4R (13Hruby V.J., Lu, D. Sharma S.D. Castrucci A.L. Kesterson R.A. al-Obeidi F.A. Hadley M.E. Cone R.D. J. Med. Chem. 1995; 38: 3454-3461Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). However, the molecular basis responsible for this antagonism is unclear. In the present study, we use a domain-swapping strategy to localize regions of the hMC4R responsible for SHU9119 antagonism. hMC4R and hMC1R were chosen to construct chimeras because the hMC4R and hMC1R belong to the same receptor family, yet SHU9119 is an agonist at MC1R and an antagonist at MC4R (25Bednarek M.A. MacNeil T. Kalyani R.N. Tang R. van der Ploeg L.H. Weinberg D.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 272: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 26Haskell-Luevano C. Lim S. Yuan W. Cone R.D. Hruby V.J. Peptides. 2000; 21: 49-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Our chimeric receptor studies demonstrated that the TM3 of the hMC4R is responsible for SHU9119 selectivity because the substitution of the TM3 of the hMC4R with the corresponding region of hMC1R (hMC4R/3TMhMC1R) switched SHU9119 from antagonist to agonist but did not alter NDP-MSH, MTII, and SHU9119 binding affinity. Therefore, TM3 of hMC4R plays a critical role in SHU9119 antagonism without affecting SHU9119 binding. This suggests that ligand binding and receptor activation by SHU9119 require different amino acids. To determine which residues of the MC4R TM3 are responsible for SHU9119 specific activity, mutagenesis studies were performed. Sequence analysis studies of hMC4R and hMC1R have indicated that both receptors have conserved residues that are known to be involved in receptor binding and activation of NDP-MSH. Our binding studies reported here show no significant differences in the agonist NDP-MSH binding affinities at all chimeric receptors we studied. This has led us to propose that melanocortin ligand binding affinity is directed by ligand interaction with conserved receptor residues. However, functional selectivity might be directed by ligand interactions with non-conserved receptor residues located at equivalent positions in different receptor subtypes. Moreover, residues located at different positions in different receptors may also contribute to ligand functional selectivity. Because of the findings that the substitution of the TM3 did not alter ligand binding affinity we theorized that SHU9119 might utilize receptor-conserved residues to occupy the receptor-binding sites but that d-Nal, in position 7, could not interact with certain non-conserved residue to activate the receptor. Analysis of the hMC4R sequence indicates that there are nine non-conserved amino acids in TM3 that are different from hMC1R. Amino acid residues Ser127, Val128, Ile129, Leu133, Ala135, Ile137, and Ser139 are potential candidates for critical activation molecules. Leu141 and Ser142 are located on the deep intracellular side of the membrane and are not believed to be involved in ligand binding and receptor activation. To investigate which amino acids might be important for SHU9119 specific activity we individually substituted these seven candidate amino acids of hMC4R with the corresponding amino acid of the hMC1R TM3 region. Our results show that substitution of S127V, V128I, I129T, A135S, I137T, and S139F does not affect NDP-MSH, MTII, and SHU9119 binding affinity. In addition, SHU9119 remains a MC4R antagonist, whereas MTII and NDP-MSH remain agonists. However, when Leu133 is replaced with Met133 SHU9119 switches from antagonist SHU9119 to an agonist. This finding suggests that leucine in position 133 of hMC4R is critical for SHU9119 antagonism because the mutation of hMC4R gains ability for SHU9119 to stimulate cAMP generation. Our results suggest that SHU9119 utilizes conserved receptor residues for ligand binding but non-conserved residues for its specific activity. It has been reported that d-Phe of NDP-MSH is important for hMC4R binding and activation with its activation being dramatically reduced if d-Phe is replaced with d-Ala (18Yang Y.K. Fong T.M. Dickinson C.J. Mao C. Li J.Y. Tota M.R. Mosley R. van der Ploeg L.H. Gantz I. Biochemisty. 2000; 39: 14900-14911Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Combined with our current findings, these data suggest that both the stereochemistry and the bulky naphthyl ring in position 7 of MTII are important for positioning of ligand residues with the responding hMC4R residues but that receptor subtypes, not ligands, determine functional selectivity.To determine whether residue TM3 leucine 133 of hMC4R is specific for SHU9119 activity or whether it is a critical residue common for other melanocortin receptors, we mutated the homologous residue in TM3 of hMC1R, methionine 128 to leucine 128. Our results indicate that the mutation of M128L does not affect NDP-MSH binding affinity but does dramatically decrease MTII and SHU9119 binding affinity. This finding strongly suggested that NDP-MSH had different binding sites from MTII and SHU9119 at hMC1R and that Met128 is crucial for MTII and SHU9119 binding but is not important for NDP-MSH binding. One possible explanation for this finding might be that NDP-MSH is a linear peptide and can compensate the binding site, whereas MTII and SHU9119 are cyclic peptides. Cyclic peptide structures are more restricted than that of NDP-MSH. Therefore the fact that substitution of Met128 in hMC1R, the amino acid corresponding to Leu133 of hMC4R, did not switch SHU9119 from agonist to antagonist indicates that residue 133 in hMC4R is unique for SHU9119 selectivity. It is not the common nature for all melanocortin receptor subtypes. Our results indicated that more than one amino acid residue is required for SHU9119 activation at the hMC1R. Residue Met128 at the hMC1R is involved in both MTII and SHU9119 binding, but the Leu133 residue at the hMC4R is the only specific residue that differentiates d-Phe andd-Nal activity.It has been reported that two phenylalanines in positions 254 and 259 in TM6 of mouse MC4R are involved in SHU9119 antagonism (27Haskell-Luevano C. Cone R.D. Monck E.K. Wan Y.P. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6164-6179Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). However, our data demonstrate that replacement of TM6 of human MC4R with TM6 of human MC1R has no effect on SHU9119 activity. Furthermore, sequence analysis of both hMC1R and hMC4R TM6 indicates that both receptors have two phenylalanine residues at the same position. If phenylalanine in TM6 of hMC4R was crucial for SHU9119 specific activity it would be unlikely that SHU9119 would have a different action at hMC1R compared with hMC4R. One explanation for this discrepancy might be that human MC4R has different binding sites for SHU9119 compared with that of mouse MC4R.In conclusion, these results provide insight into the molecular features of hMC4R responsible for SHU9119 antagonist specific activity. This study shows that the mutation of hMC4R Leu133 to methionine switches SHU9119 from antagonist to agonist while not changing NDP-MSH, MTII, or SHU9119 binding affinity, and Met128 in hMC1R is important for MTII and SHU9119 binding and activation. This report also suggests that melanocortin peptides utilize conserved residues for receptor binding while utilizing non-conserved residues for receptor functional selectivity.

In addition, the analog, SHU9119, a synthetic peptide with a β-(2-naphthyl)-d-alanine (d-Nal) substituted in position 7 of MTII, has been found to be a potent but non-selective antagonist for the MC3 and MC4 receptors (13Hruby V.J., Lu, D.

Because of potentially important therapeutic implications in the treatment of obesity and perhaps anorexia syndromes, determination of the molecular basis for ligand-receptor interaction between hMC4R and melanocortin peptides is valuable (17Yang Y.K.

Structure-function studies of NDP-MSH have demonstrated that d-Phe-Arg-Trp of NDP-MSH is the minimal peptide required for hMC4R binding and activation. Furthermore, the conserved residues in the third transmembrane (TM3) and the sixth transmembrane (TM6) domains of melanocortin receptors have been found to be involved in NDP-MSH and MTII binding (18Yang Y.K. Fong T.M. Dickinson C.J. Mao C. Li J.Y. Tota M.R. Mosley R. van der Ploeg L.H. Gantz I. Biochemisty. 2000; 39: 14900-14911Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Mutation of the conserved MC4R TM3 residues aspartic acids 122 and 126 and TM6 residues phenylalanine 261 and histidine 264 significantly decrease the binding affinity and potency of NDP-MSH and MTII (18Yang Y.K.

Little information is available, however, regarding the molecular basis of hMC4R interaction with the antagonist SHU9119. Whether SHU9119 utilizes the same hMC4R-binding site as NDP-MSH and MTII is unknown. To gain insight into the molecular determinants of hMC4R responsible for SHU9119 selectivity, and particularly to define hMC4R residues essential for SHU9119 antagonist selectivity, we have taken a broad approach to investigating the role of the transmembrane amino acid residues of MC4R in discriminating between MTII and SHU9119 receptor activation. Chimeras and mutants of MC4R were constructed and studied. We hope this approach will provide valuable insight into the molecular basis of ligand-receptor interaction between hMC4R as well as SHU9119 and provide new information for rational drug design of selective MC4R agonists and antagonists. DISCUSSIONHypothalamic MC4R plays an important role in the regulation of animal food intake. The melanocortin receptor agonist, MTII, and antagonist SHU9119 have been widely used in the study of MC receptor functions (20Jonsson L. Skarphedinsson J.O. Skuladottir G.V. Atlason P.T.

Analg. 2001; 93: 1572-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The identification of the essential amino acid residues of human MC4R responsible for SHU9119 antagonism should be important for understanding the signaling events that regulate the melanocortin system under physiologic circumstances. In addition, a molecular understanding of SHU9119 activity at hMC4R may have important implications in the design of drugs that may regulate feeding behavior in conditions such as obesity or anorexia.The natural melanocortins (α-MSH, β-MSH, γ-MSH, and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)) and synthetic melanocortins (NDP-MSH, MTII, and SHU9119) have distinct affinity profiles for each of the five MC receptor subtypes. The natural melanocortins are all agonists for hMCRs with the exception of MC2R, for which only ACTH is a full agonist (23Schioth H.B. Chhajlani V. Muceniece R. Klusa V. Wikberg J.E. Life Sci. 1996; 59: 797-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). However, synthetic melanocortins have different pharmacological profiles for the five MC receptor subtypes. For example, NDP-MSH and MTII are agonists for all human MC receptor subtypes except hMC2R (24Haskell-Luevano C. Nikiforovich G. Sharma S.D. Yang Y.K. Dickinson C. Hruby V.J. Gantz I. J. Med. Chem. 1997; 40: 1738-1748Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The varying pharmacological profiles of the five MC receptor subtypes suggest that they have different ligand-binding sites and/or utilize different residues for binding and functional selectivity. The identification of the role that the amino acid residue Phe7 plays in MSH binding and activity led to the discovery of SHU9119, in which a bulky hydrophobic amino acid in position 7 of MTII converts the peptide from an agonist to an antagonist at the MC3R and MC4R (13Hruby V.J., Lu, D. Sharma S.D. Castrucci A.L. Kesterson R.A. al-Obeidi F.A. Hadley M.E. Cone R.D. J. Med. Chem. 1995; 38: 3454-3461Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). However, the molecular basis responsible for this antagonism is unclear. In the present study, we use a domain-swapping strategy to localize regions of the hMC4R responsible for SHU9119 antagonism. hMC4R and hMC1R were chosen to construct chimeras because the hMC4R and hMC1R belong to the same receptor family, yet SHU9119 is an agonist at MC1R and an antagonist at MC4R (25Bednarek M.A. MacNeil T. Kalyani R.N. Tang R. van der Ploeg L.H. Weinberg D.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 272: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 26Haskell-Luevano C. Lim S. Yuan W. Cone R.D. Hruby V.J. Peptides. 2000; 21: 49-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Our chimeric receptor studies demonstrated that the TM3 of the hMC4R is responsible for SHU9119 selectivity because the substitution of the TM3 of the hMC4R with the corresponding region of hMC1R (hMC4R/3TMhMC1R) switched SHU9119 from antagonist to agonist but did not alter NDP-MSH, MTII, and SHU9119 binding affinity. Therefore, TM3 of hMC4R plays a critical role in SHU9119 antagonism without affecting SHU9119 binding. This suggests that ligand binding and receptor activation by SHU9119 require different amino acids. To determine which residues of the MC4R TM3 are responsible for SHU9119 specific activity, mutagenesis studies were performed. Sequence analysis studies of hMC4R and hMC1R have indicated that both receptors have conserved residues that are known to be involved in receptor binding and activation of NDP-MSH. Our binding studies reported here show no significant differences in the agonist NDP-MSH binding affinities at all chimeric receptors we studied. This has led us to propose that melanocortin ligand binding affinity is directed by ligand interaction with conserved receptor residues. However, functional selectivity might be directed by ligand interactions with non-conserved receptor residues located at equivalent positions in different receptor subtypes. Moreover, residues located at different positions in different receptors may also contribute to ligand functional selectivity. Because of the findings that the substitution of the TM3 did not alter ligand binding affinity we theorized that SHU9119 might utilize receptor-conserved residues to occupy the receptor-binding sites but that d-Nal, in position 7, could not interact with certain non-conserved residue to activate the receptor. Analysis of the hMC4R sequence indicates that there are nine non-conserved amino acids in TM3 that are different from hMC1R. Amino acid residues Ser127, Val128, Ile129, Leu133, Ala135, Ile137, and Ser139 are potential candidates for critical activation molecules. Leu141 and Ser142 are located on the deep intracellular side of the membrane and are not believed to be involved in ligand binding and receptor activation. To investigate which amino acids might be important for SHU9119 specific activity we individually substituted these seven candidate amino acids of hMC4R with the corresponding amino acid of the hMC1R TM3 region. Our results show that substitution of S127V, V128I, I129T, A135S, I137T, and S139F does not affect NDP-MSH, MTII, and SHU9119 binding affinity. In addition, SHU9119 remains a MC4R antagonist, whereas MTII and NDP-MSH remain agonists. However, when Leu133 is replaced with Met133 SHU9119 switches from antagonist SHU9119 to an agonist. This finding suggests that leucine in position 133 of hMC4R is critical for SHU9119 antagonism because the mutation of hMC4R gains ability for SHU9119 to stimulate cAMP generation. Our results suggest that SHU9119 utilizes conserved receptor residues for ligand binding but non-conserved residues for its specific activity. It has been reported that d-Phe of NDP-MSH is important for hMC4R binding and activation with its activation being dramatically reduced if d-Phe is replaced with d-Ala (18Yang Y.K. Fong T.M. Dickinson C.J. Mao C. Li J.Y. Tota M.R. Mosley R. van der Ploeg L.H. Gantz I. Biochemisty. 2000; 39: 14900-14911Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Combined with our current findings, these data suggest that both the stereochemistry and the bulky naphthyl ring in position 7 of MTII are important for positioning of ligand residues with the responding hMC4R residues but that receptor subtypes, not ligands, determine functional selectivity.To determine whether residue TM3 leucine 133 of hMC4R is specific for SHU9119 activity or whether it is a critical residue common for other melanocortin receptors, we mutated the homologous residue in TM3 of hMC1R, methionine 128 to leucine 128. Our results indicate that the mutation of M128L does not affect NDP-MSH binding affinity but does dramatically decrease MTII and SHU9119 binding affinity. This finding strongly suggested that NDP-MSH had different binding sites from MTII and SHU9119 at hMC1R and that Met128 is crucial for MTII and SHU9119 binding but is not important for NDP-MSH binding. One possible explanation for this finding might be that NDP-MSH is a linear peptide and can compensate the binding site, whereas MTII and SHU9119 are cyclic peptides. Cyclic peptide structures are more restricted than that of NDP-MSH. Therefore the fact that substitution of Met128 in hMC1R, the amino acid corresponding to Leu133 of hMC4R, did not switch SHU9119 from agonist to antagonist indicates that residue 133 in hMC4R is unique for SHU9119 selectivity. It is not the common nature for all melanocortin receptor subtypes. Our results indicated that more than one amino acid residue is required for SHU9119 activation at the hMC1R. Residue Met128 at the hMC1R is involved in both MTII and SHU9119 binding, but the Leu133 residue at the hMC4R is the only specific residue that differentiates d-Phe andd-Nal activity.It has been reported that two phenylalanines in positions 254 and 259 in TM6 of mouse MC4R are involved in SHU9119 antagonism (27Haskell-Luevano C. Cone R.D. Monck E.K. Wan Y.P. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6164-6179Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). However, our data demonstrate that replacement of TM6 of human MC4R with TM6 of human MC1R has no effect on SHU9119 activity. Furthermore, sequence analysis of both hMC1R and hMC4R TM6 indicates that both receptors have two phenylalanine residues at the same position. If phenylalanine in TM6 of hMC4R was crucial for SHU9119 specific activity it would be unlikely that SHU9119 would have a different action at hMC1R compared with hMC4R.

Residue Met128 at the hMC1R is involved in both MTII and SHU9119 binding, but the Leu133 residue at the hMC4R is the only specific residue that differentiates d-Phe andd-Nal activity. It has been reported that two phenylalanines in positions 254 and 259 in TM6 of mouse MC4R are involved in SHU9119 antagonism (27Haskell-Luevano C. Cone R.D. Monck E.K. Wan Y.P. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6164-6179Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). However, our data demonstrate that replacement of TM6 of human MC4R with TM6 of human MC1R has no effect on SHU9119 activity. Furthermore, sequence analysis of both hMC1R and hMC4R TM6 indicates that both receptors have two phenylalanine residues at the same position. If phenylalanine in TM6 of hMC4R was crucial for SHU9119 specific activity it would be unlikely that SHU9119 would have a different action at hMC1R compared with hMC4R. One explanation for this discrepancy might be that human MC4R has different binding sites for SHU9119 compared with that of mouse MC4R. In conclusion, these results provide insight into the molecular features of hMC4R responsible for SHU9119 antagonist specific activity. This study shows that the mutation of hMC4R Leu133 to methionine switches SHU9119 from antagonist to agonist while not changing NDP-MSH, MTII, or SHU9119 binding affinity, and Met128 in hMC1R is important for MTII and SHU9119 binding and activation. This report also suggests that melanocortin peptides utilize conserved residues for receptor binding while utilizing non-conserved residues for receptor functional selectivity."

This protein is a Ca2+-sensitive calmodulin (CaM)-binding protein whose CaM-binding affinity is modulated by phosphorylation and oxidation. To investigate the role of Ng in neural function, a strain of Ng knockout mouse (KO) was generated. Previously we reported (Pak, J. H., Huang, F. L., Li, J., Balschun, D., Reymann, K. G., Chiang, C., Westphal, H., and Huang, K.-P. (2000) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In this report, we analyzed several downstream phosphorylation targets in phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate- and forskolin-treated hippocampal slices from wild type (WT) and KO mice. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate caused phosphorylation of Ng in WT mice and promoted the translocation of PKC from the cytosolic to the particulate fractions of both the WT and KO mice, albeit to a lesser extent in the latter. Phosphorylation of downstream targets, including mitogen-activated protein kinases, 90-kDa ribosomal S6 kinase, and the cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) was significantly attenuated in KO mice. Stimulation of hippocampal slices with forskolin also caused greater stimulation of protein kinase A (PKA) in the WT as compared with those of the KO mice. Again, phosphorylation of the downstream targets of PKA was attenuated in the KO mice. These results suggest that Ng plays a pivotal role in regulating both PKC- and PKA-mediated signaling pathways, and that the deficits in learning and memory of spatial tasks detected in the KO mice may be the result of defects in the signaling pathways leading to the phosphorylation of CREB.

These mutant mice displayed no obvious neuroanatomical abnormality; however, they exhibited deficits in learning the spatial tasks when tested with Morris water maze. In addition, Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) in the hippocampal slices of these KO mice is less readily autophosphorylated as compared with those of the wild type (WT) mice upon treatments that enhance Ng phosphorylation and oxidation. neurogranin protein kinase C protein kinase A calmodulin knockout wild type phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate artificial cerebrospinal fluid mitogen-activated protein 90-kDa ribosomal S6 kinase cAMP response element-binding protein Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinase II long term potentiation Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20 cytosolic particulate membrane neurogranin protein kinase C protein kinase A calmodulin knockout wild type phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate artificial cerebrospinal fluid mitogen-activated protein 90-kDa ribosomal S6 kinase cAMP response element-binding protein Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinase II long term potentiation Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20 cytosolic particulate membrane Induction of hippocampal long term potentiation (LTP, an experimental model of learning and memory) is well recognized to be initiated by the stimulation of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor, and perhaps also metabotropic glutamate receptors, and is dependent on the influx of Ca2+ through N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors as well as voltage-dependent calcium channel. Subsequently, the expression and the maintenance of LTP and the eventual consolidation and storage of information into the long term memory are known to depend on the stimulation of several Ca2+/CaM-sensitive enzymes (including CaMKII), PKC, protein kinase A (PKA), and other kinases in the phosphorylation cascade, and eventual de novo protein synthesis (13Giese K.P.

Judging from its CaM-binding property, Ng would have assumed a fairly upstream regulatory role in the biochemical mechanisms involved in the memory formation. Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase), also known as extracellular signal-regulated kinase, is a family of serine/threonine protein kinases having widespread distributions. MAP kinase cascade was originally discovered as a critical regulator of cell division and differentiation (18Miyasaka T. Miyasaka J. Saltiel A.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 168: 1237-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 19Posada J. Cooper J.A. Science. 1992; 255: 212-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 20Seger R. Krebs E.G.

Interestingly, MAP kinase signaling cascades were discovered also to play a pivotal role in synaptic plasticity and learning and memory (16Sweatt J.D. J.

Moore A.N. Adams F. Dash P.K. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 3535-3544Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, many studies indicated that signal transductions lead to activation of either PKC or PKA can elicit hippocampal MAP kinase activation, and MAP kinase is an important regulator of cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) phosphorylation in the hippocampus (15Roberson E.D.

Science. 1996; 273: 959-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar) also show that 90-kDa ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK2) is a likely candidate coupling MAP kinase to CREB phosphorylation. RSK2, which is directly activated by MAP kinase via phosphorylation, in turn phosphorylates CREB at Ser-133 and thereby regulates its activity as a transcriptional activator. In light of its unique CaM-binding ability in the absence of Ca2+, Ng generally can be considered as a CaM depot. Upon activation of glutamatergic neurons, the rising intracellular Ca2+ would be expected to displace Ng from the CaM/Ng complex, and the resulting Ca2+/CaM became available for the various Ca2+/CaM-dependent enzymes, these in turn regulate the downstream targets including those in the aforementioned MAP kinase cascade. In the absence of Ng, as in the KO mice, lack of the CaM depot will lead to the perturbation of most, if not all, of these signaling steps. In the present study, we analyzed several downstream phosphorylation components in responding to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and forskolin in the hippocampal slices of both WT and KO mice. The results show that both PKC and PKA are activated to greater degrees by PMA and forskolin, respectively, in the WT than those of KO mice. Consequently, the activation of downstream signaling components, including MAP kinases, p90RSK, and CREB, are greatly attenuated in KO as compared with the WT mice. These results, together with our previous observation of the defect of CaMKII autophosphorylation in the KO mice, strongly support the notion that Ng plays an important role in neuronal signal transductions. As a result of genetic knockout of Ng, many defects including those reported presently render the mutant mice poorer learners as compared with WT mice. These Ng KO mice will be a useful model to delineate the signal transduction pathways in the hippocampus-dependent memory acquisition, storage, and retrieval. The following materials were obtained from the indicated sources: PMA, LC Laboratories; forskolin, Alexis Biochemicals; Ng peptide (residues 28–43) and Leu-Arg-Arg-Ala-Ser-Leu-Gly (Kemptide), Bachem Inc.; PKA inhibitor peptide (residues 5–22), SynPep Corp.; [γ-32P]ATP, PerkinElmer Life Sciences; AG 1-X8 resin, protein assay reagent, and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG and goat anti-mouse IgG, Bio-Rad; phosphatidylserine and 1,2-dioleoylglycerol, Avanti Polar Lipids; and bovine serum albumin and cAMP, Sigma. Hippocampi from adult mouse brain (3–4 months old) were removed immediately after decapitation and placed into ice-cold artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF, in mm: NaCl 125, KCl 2.5, CaCl2 2.0, NaHCO3 26, NaH2PO4 1.25, MgCl2 1.0, glucose 25) bubbling with 95% O2, 5% CO2. Transverse hippocampal slices (400 μm) were prepared with a McIlwain tissue chopper and incubated in ACSF in a chamber saturated with 95% O2, 5% CO2 at room temperature for at least 3 h before treatment. Hippocampal slices (5–6 slices each) from either WT or KO mice were treated with 4 μm PMA or 50 μm forskolin in ACSF for the indicated times, and the tissues were washed and kept frozen at −70 °C until processing. Each sample was sonicated in Homogenization Buffer (50 mmTris-Cl, pH 7.5, containing 2 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 50 μm4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonylfluoride hydrochloride, 5 mg/ml leupeptin, 50 mm KF, 50 nm okadaic acid, and 1% SDS), and the clear homogenate used for protein determination and immunoblot analysis. Control experiments where slices were left untreated or mock-treated with carrier ACSF were also carried out. These samples, when analyzed by immunoblot with various antibodies, did not produce any changes in the states of phosphorylation over the period of incubation. Frozen slices (6–7 slices) were rapidly thawed and homogenized at 4 °C in 100 μl of Buffer A (Homogenization Buffer without SDS, but with 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate). Homogenates were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C in a Optima™ TLX Ultracentrifuge to yield cytosol. The pellet fractions were resuspended in 100 μl of Buffer A containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40, sonicated, and centrifuged again. The resulting supernatants, taken as the particulate fractions, together with the cytosolic fractions, were assayed for PKC activities and immunoreactivities. PKC activity was determined in both the cytosolic and particulate fractions as previously described (30Huang K.-P. Huang F.L. Nakabayashi H. Yoshida Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 14839-14845Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, measurement was at 30 °C for 5 min in a mixture (25 μl) containing 30 mmTris-Cl (pH 7.5), 6 mm MgCl2, 120 μm [γ-32P]ATP, 1.0 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 20 μm Ng-(28–43) peptide substrate, 0.1 mg/ml phosphatidylserine, 0.02 mg/ml 1,2-dioleoylglycerol, 0.4 mmCaCl2 or 1.5 mm EGTA, and 1 μg protein of tissue extract. Reactions were stopped with 100 μl of ice-cold 20% trichloroacetic acid containing 50 mm ATP. After standing in ice for 10 min, the mixture was centrifuged, and the supernatant passed through a minicolumn (0.5 ml) of AG 1-X8 resin in acetate form. The column was washed twice each with 1 ml of 30% acetic acid.32P-Labeled peptide substrates eluted were measured in a scintillation counter. All reactions were run in duplicate; PKC activities were expressed as picomoles of 32P incorporated into peptide/μg of protein/5 min. Hippocampal slices (4–5 slices) were homogenized and briefly sonicated on ice in 120 μl of Buffer A containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40. Homogenates were centrifuged at 20,800 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was used for protein determination and PKA assay. PKA activity was measured at 30 °C for 5 min in a mixture (25 μl) containing 30 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 6 mm MgCl2, 120 μm [γ-32P]ATP, 1.0 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 40 μm Kemptide, with or without 10 μm cAMP, and 1 μg protein of tissue extract. Reactions were stopped, and 32P incorporation into peptide was determined as described for PKC activity measurement. All reactions were run in duplicate. PKA activities were expressed as picomoles of32P incorporated into peptide substrate/μg of protein/5 min. Activities measured with cAMP were considered as total PKA activity, which remained near constant throughout the incubation period whereas activities measured without cAMP increased following forskolin treatment as a result of elevated level of cAMP. Thus, increase in –cAMP activities calculated as percentage of total activity (+cAMP) was used as an index of PKA activation. Kinase assay in the presence of synthetic PKA inhibitor peptide (residues 5–22), abolished near completely the cAMP-activated activity and the increase in the −cAMP activity resulting from forskolin treatment. Throughout the study, protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method (31Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214351) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as standard. For MAP kinase, RSK2, and CREB blots, 30 μg of protein from each sample was loaded per lane for SDS-PAGE (10% gel). For PKC and Ng, 20 μg of protein was used for electrophoresis in SDS-PAGE (8 and 10–20% gradient gels, respectively). After electrophoresis and transfer of proteins onto nitrocellulose membrane at 4 °C, the membrane was washed for 10 min with TTBS (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, containing 0.15 m NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20), blocked with 5% nonfat dried milk in TTBS for 40 min, washed three times with TTBS, and then incubated with primary and secondary antibodies in TTBS, consecutively, for 3–4 and 1 h, respectively. For phospho-MAP kinase, an anti-dual phospho-MAP kinase monoclonal antibody (Cell Signaling Technology; selectively detects doubly phosphorylated Thr-202 and Tyr-204 of p44 and p42 MAP kinases) was used at 1:1000 dilution. In this and all other Western blot protocols described below, the blots were washed extensively in TTBS after incubations with primary and second antibodies (typically three washes, each for 10 min). For monoclonal antibodies, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG was used as secondary antibody; for polyclonal antibodies, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG was used. Both were used at 1:5000 dilution. Signals were revealed via enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (ECL, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). For phospho-RSK2, we used two different primary antibodies specific for two separate phosphorylation sites, phospho-p90RSK Ser-380 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) and Thr-360/Ser-364 (Cell Signaling Technology). For phospho-CREB, the primary antibody (diluted 1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology) detects CREB only when activated by phosphorylation at Ser-133. For total MAP kinase and total CREB immunoreactivities, those membranes previously blotted with phosphorylation-dependent antibodies were stripped using buffer containing 62.5 mmTris-Cl, pH 6.7, 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 2% SDS for 30–60 min at 55 °C with constant shaking. The blots were washed several times and re-blocked, and treated the same way as for the phosphospecific antibody. Both total MAP kinase antibodies (New England Biolabs), recognize both p44 and p42 MAP kinases, and total CREB antibodies are phosphorylation state-independent and were used at 1:1000 dilution. For PKC, an anti-conventional PKC antibodies previously prepared in our laboratory (32Huang K.-P. Nakabayashi H. Huang F.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8535-8539Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar) was used at 1:3000 dilution. Use of antibodies 3615 and 270 for the detection of phosphorylated and total Ng were as described previously (6Huang K.-P. Huang F.L. Chen H.-C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 305: 570-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 8Li J. Pak J.H. Huang F.L. Huang K.-P. J. Biol.

The data were expressed as mean ± S.E. of at least three independent experiments when using KO mice, where the responses elicited by the various treatments were minimal, and of five to six independent experiments using WT mice. Quantitative analysis for immunoblot was done by scanning the x-ray film and determined using the Fotodyne Gel-Pro Analyzer program. Statistical analysis was conducted by one-way analysis of variance followed by paired comparisons using Student's t test. Under control conditions, specific PKC activities determined in the cytosolic (S) and particulate membrane (P) fractions of WT and KO mice hippocampal slices were, respectively, 188 ± 27.4 (WT, S, n = 7), 173 ± 9.3 (KO, S,n = 4), 155 ± 11.8 (WT, P, n = 7), and 145 ± 10.0 (KO, P, n = 4) pmol/μg of protein/5 min. Exposure of these hippocampal slices to PMA, a PKC activator, caused an apparent translocation of protein kinase C activity from the cytosolic to the particulate membrane fractions (Fig. 1B). Brief (2-min) incubation with 4 μm PMA resulted in a rapid decrease in the cytosolic PKC activity, and the reduction of cytosolic PKC in the WT was significantly greater than that of the KO (80 ± 4.7% (WT, S,n = 7) versus 91 ± 8.2% (KO, S,n = 4), p < 0.05). After 5 min of incubation, PKC activity in the cytosolic fraction of WT mice slightly recovered, but then decreased continuously until the end of incubation at 60 min. In contrast, in the KO mice, there was a slow decrease of PKC activity in cytosolic fraction. At 60 min, the remaining level of cytosolic PKC in the WT was much less than that of the KO mice (53 ± 6.4% (WT, S, n = 7) versus 71 ± 14.0% (KO, S, n = 4), p < 0.05). On the other hand, in the particulate membrane fractions, at 2 min, the translocated PKC activity is significantly higher in the WT mice than that in the KO mice (percentage of control values, 126 ± 6.0% (WT, P, n = 7) versus 111 ± 12.1% (KO, P, n = 4), p < 0.05). For the WT, after an initial increase in the activity of the particulate fraction at 2 min, there was a slight dip at 5 min, and then the level immediately increased after 10 min until the end of incubation. In contrast, there was only a small and slow increase of PKC activity in the particulate fractions of KO mice. The level of particulate PKC in the KO at 60 min was significantly less than that of the WT mice (118 ± 16.3% (KO, P, n = 4) versus140 ± 11.2% (WT, P, n = 7), p < 0.05). The data suggested that the degree of translocation of PKC in the KO is less than that of the WT mice. The immunoblot analysis with a conventional PKC antibody (Fig. 1A) supported this conclusion. Ng has been shown to be a specific PKC substrate. As PMA treatment promotes the translocation and activation of PKC in hippocampal slices (Fig. 1), it is of interest to test the status of Ng phosphorylation during PMA treatment. Fig. 2A (top panel) shows that 4 μm PMA, the concentration used in the previous PKC translocation experiment, induced a time-dependent phosphorylation of Ng determined by immunoblot analysis with antibodies specific for phosphorylated Ng. It reached a maximal level in 10 min and declined slightly afterward until the end of incubation at 60 min (Fig. 2B). Degrees of Ng phosphorylation at 2, 5, 10, 30, and 60 min were, respectively, 135 ± 5.5, 148 ± 11.3, 157 ± 11.4, 129 ± 9.9, and 127 ± 13.5% of basal level (p < 0.001). Total Ng levels were unchanged by the above treatments (Fig. 2A, bottom panel), as shown in the immunoblot analyses with antibodies independent of phosphorylation state of Ng. These results demonstrate that the phosphorylation of Ng does occur in the neurons when PKC is activated either directly by PMA (present study) or indirectly by carbachol. 2J. Wu and F. L. Huang, unpublished data. Needless to say, such reaction does not take place in the KO mice, as Ng is completely devoid in these mice. It was reported that PKC activation in hippocampal slices resulted in an activation of mostly p42 MAP kinase, an effect that has been observed in a wide variety of cell types (16Sweatt J.D. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar, 33Lo L.W. Cheng J.J. Chiu J.J. Wung B.S. Liu Y.C. Wang D.L. J. Cell.

In the present studies we found that PMA elicited activation of both p44 and p42 MAP kinases. Fig. 3A(left panels) showed that, in hippocampal slices of WT mice, 4 μm PMA produced a rapid increase in immunoreactivities of phospho-MAP kinases within 2 min of stimulation; the phosphorylation and activation remained high and only declined to near basal level after 60 min of incubation. In contrast, the same concentration of PMA did not induce much increase in MAP kinase phosphorylation in Ng KO mice (Fig. 3A, right panels). After 2, 5, 10, and 30 min of incubations, activations of p42 MAP kinase in WT mice were averaged 1.4–1.9-fold greater than those of the KO mice (percentages of control values were, for WT, 171 ± 16.9%, 2 min; 190 ± 24.7%, 5 min; 204 ± 22.2%, 10 min; and 162 ± 29.8%, 30 min; n = 6; and for KO, 100.3 ± 0.9%, 2 min; 107 ± 2.7%, 5 min; 110 ± 1.2%, 10 min; and 114 ± 1.8%, 30 min;n = 3, p < 0.05) (Fig. 3B). It is worth of noting that the phospho-p44 MAP kinase, although its immunoreactivity is relatively less intense than that of phospho-p42 MAP kinase, also shows a time-dependent increase in the WT mice parallel to that of the phospho-p42 MAP kinase. Again, such an increase is hardly discernible in the KO mice. These observations suggest that PKC activation in hippocampal slices of WT mice leads to activations of both p44 and p42 MAP kinases, and at no time point in KO mice was stimulation of phospho-MAP kinases meaningfully obtained. Total MAP kinase levels were unchanged by the above treatments in both WT and KO mice (Fig. 3A, bottom panels). We next analyzed the downstream target of MAP kinases in the hippocampus. We focused on RSK2, because RSK2 lies immediately downstream of MAP kinase in the phorbol ester- and growth factor-mediated signaling pathways; additionally, RSK2 has been shown to be activated by MAP kinase in vitro and in vivo via phosphorylation. So far, several phosphorylation sites of RSK2, including Ser-381 (referred to as Ser-380 for the Upstate Biotechnology antibodies) and Thr-360/Ser-364, have been identified to be important for its activation (35Dalby K.N.

Classically, PDGF is a dimeric molecule consisting of disulfide-bonded A and B polypeptides that assemble into homo- and heterodimers; i.e. PDGF-AA, PDGF-BB, and PDGF-AB (3Hammacher A. Nister M. Westermark B. Heldin C.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 176: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). PDGF transduces cellular responses by binding to two related protein tyrosine kinase receptors, the PDGF α- and β-receptors. PDGF-AB and PDGF-BB bind to both PDGF α- and β-receptors with similar affinity (4Heldin C.H. Bäckstrom G. Östman A. Hammacher A. Rönnstrand L. Rubin K. Nister M. Westermark B.

The phosphorylated tyrosine residues, in combination with surrounding amino acid residues, form binding sites for signaling proteins equipped with Src homology (SH) 2 domains. The PDGF receptors are known to associate with members of the Src family of cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases, phospholipase C-γ, the regulatory p85 subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase, the adaptor Grb2, and the Src homology-containing phosphatase 2 (Shp-2) (Ref. 11Pawson T.

Binding of SH2 domain proteins in turn leads to initiation of signaling cascades involving mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and protein kinase B (PKB/Akt) that provide survival signals for the cell. The PDGF-A chain appears as two variants, a longer form (PDGF-AL) and a shorter form (PDGF-AS), that are generated through alternative splicing of exons 6 and 7 of the PDGF-A gene. The PDGF-B chain, on the other hand, is proteolytically processed into a shorter form and a longer form. The PDGF-AS and the short form of PDGF-B are effectively secreted into the medium, whereas PDGF-AL and the long form of PDGF-B are retained at the cell surface (14Bonthron D.T. Morton C.C. Orkin S.H.

Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 503-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The retention of the long PDGF polypeptides is due at least in part to binding to glycosaminoglycans, particularly those of heparan sulfate proteoglycans (16Sundberg C. Branting M. Gerdin B. Rubin K. Am. J. Pathol. 1997; 151: 479-492PubMed Google Scholar, 17Kelly J.L. Sanchez A. Brown G.S. Chesterman C.N. Sleigh M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 1153-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Heparan sulfate proteoglycans are expressed on most cell types but are also secreted and deposited in the extracellular matrix. The binding of proteins to HS and other glycosaminoglycans is largely electrostatic in nature and involves the negatively charged carboxyl and sulfate groups in the HS chains and basic amino acid residues in the protein. Sulfation of HS may occur at the N-, 3-O and 6-O positions of the glucosamine units and at the 2-O position of the hexuronic acid residues (18Jacobsson I. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 5094-5100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Notably, the sulfation patterns of HS are tissue-specific, developmentally regulated, and apparently designed to accommodate selective interactions with a spectrum of proteins (19Lindahl U. Kusche-Gullberg M. Kjellen L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24979-24982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have investigated effects of heparin on PDGF-BB-stimulated PDGF receptor activation and determined the influence of oligosaccharide chain length and O-sulfation on receptor activation and downstream signaling events. Wild-type Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) KI cells and mutated, HS-deficient CHO 677 cells (20Esko J.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1991; 3: 805-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) were cultured in Ham's F-12 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Confluent CHO 677 cells were washed with PBS-B/BSA (PBS plus 0.077 mm CaCl2 and 0.083 mm MgSO4 supplemented with 1% BSA) and incubated for 1 h on ice with increasing amounts of unlabeled PDGF-BB (24,300 Da; Peprotech) in the presence or absence of 100 ng/ml heparin. The cells were then incubated for 1 h with 1 ng/ml125I-PDGF-BB (20,000 cpm/ng; Amersham Biosciences). The cells were washed three times with PBS-B/BSA and then lysed for 15 min on ice in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, and 10% glycerol. Cell-associated 125I was estimated using a gamma counter. For detection of cell surface HS and chondroitin sulfate (CS), CHO KI and CHO 677 cells were suspended at a concentration of 1 × 106 cells/ml in RPMI 1640 medium and 10% fetal calf serum containing 10 μg/ml anti-HS antibody 10E4 (21David G. Bai X.M. Van der Schueren B. Cassiman J.J. Van den Berghe H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 961-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar) or an anti-CS antibody (catalogue number C8035; Sigma) for 1 h on ice. Cells were washed with RPMI 1640/10% fetal calf serum, incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (Dako) for 30 min on ice, and then washed with PBS/2% BSA. The cells were analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Purification of heparin from pig intestinal mucosa (22Lindahl U. Roden L. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 2113-2119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and selective chemical O-desulfation followed by re-N-sulfation of bovine lung heparin (23Feyzi E. Trybala E. Bergström T. Lindahl U. Spillmann D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24850-24857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) were performed as described. In the 2-O-desulfated heparin, 1% of the iduronic acid residues were 2-O-sulfated, whereas >80% of the glucosamine residues were 6-O-sulfated. In the 6-O-desulfated preparations, the degree of glucosamine 6-O sulfation was <10%, but the treatment also resulted in the removal of ∼30% of the 2-O sulfate groups. The preparations were subjected to high-resolution gel filtration and sterile-filtered to remove possible contamination. There was no sign of toxicity of these preparations in the tissue culture. Chemical depolymerization of bovine lung heparin was performed by limited deamination with nitrous acid at pH 1.5 as described. Heparin fragments were radiolabeled by reduction with NaB3H4 (24Spillmann D. Witt D. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15487-15493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) and then separated with regard to size by gel chromatography on a column (1 × 146 cm) of BioGel P-10 in 0.5 m NH4HCO3. All nonlabeled GAGs were quantified by colorimetric determination of hexuronic acid using the meta-hydroxydiphenyl method with glucoronic acid as a standard (25Blumenkrantz N. Asboe-Hansen G. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 56: 10-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). A factor of 3 was arbitrarily employed to convert values to saccharide mass. Radiolabeled heparin, 2-O-desulfated heparin, and preferentially 6-O-desulfated heparin (0.75 μm) of ≥20-mer size were incubated at room temperature for 60 min with PDGF (0–10 μm) in a final volume of 40 μl of Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% BSA. Protein, along with protein-bound oligosaccharides, was trapped on nitrocellulose filters (2.5 cm, diameter) (Schleicher & Schuell) through vacuum suction, whereas nonbound oligosaccharides were washed off with phosphate-buffered saline (26Maccarana M. Casu B. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23898-23905Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The protein-bound oligosaccharides were dissociated from the filter in 2 ml of 2 m NaCl and quantitated by scintillation counting. Cell cultures at 70% confluence in 10-cm dishes were serum-starved for 16 h in Ham's F-12 medium. Cells were treated for 1 h on ice and for 10 min at 37 °C with PDGF-BB at the indicated concentrations in the absence or presence of various polysaccharides and then rinsed with ice-cold PBS. Cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mmNaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1% Trasylol (Bayer), and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Clarified supernatants were incubated with PDGF α- or β-receptor antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 2 h at 4 °C and then incubated for 45 min with 40 μl of immobilized protein A (EC Diagnostics, Uppsala, Sweden). Beads were washed twice with lysis buffer and once with water. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, followed by electroblotting to Hybond-C extra membranes (Amersham Biosciences). The membranes were blocked for 1 h at room temperature in TBS-T containing 5% BSA or 5% nonfat milk. Anti-phosphotyrosine antibody PY99 or anti-PDGF receptor antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were diluted in 0.2% Tween 20/0.1% BSA or 0.2% Tween 20/5% milk and incubated overnight on the membranes, which were then washed in TBS-T. Membranes were incubated for 1 h with the appropriate secondary antibody diluted in 0.2% Tween 20/0.1% BSA or 0.2% Tween 20/5% milk. After several washes in TBS-T, immune reactivity was visualized by an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Before reprobing, filters were stripped in 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7, 2% SDS, and 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol at 50 °C for 30 min. Heparin (5 μg/ml) was incubated with 50 ng/ml PDGF-BB in 0.5 or 0.15 m NaCl in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer, end over end for 1 h at 4 °C, followed by a 2-h incubation of a mixture of two HS proteoglycan monoclonal antibodies, 10E4 (21David G. Bai X.M. Van der Schueren B. Cassiman J.J. Van den Berghe H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 961-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar) and HepSS-1 (Seikagaku), or anti-PDGF-BB anti-serum, a kind gift from Dr. Carl-Henrik Heldin (Ludwig Institute, Uppsala, Sweden). Rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulins (Dako) and mouse serum (a kind gift from Mikael Karlsson, Department of Genetics and Pathology, Rudbeck Laboratory) were used as controls. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were performed as described above. The migration capacity of CHO KI and CHO 677 cells was investigated using a modified Boyden chamber with a micropore nitrocellulose filter (8-μm thick, 8-μm pore size) precoated with 50 μg/ml type I collagen solution overnight. Subconfluent cells were starved in Ham's F-12 medium containing 0.25% BSA (starvation medium) for 16 h. Cells were detached using a nonenzymatic cell dissociation solution (Sigma) for 20 min, washed, and resuspended in starvation medium. Cells were loaded into the upper Boyden chamber wells (25 × 103 cells/well) with or without 1 μg/ml heparin. Ham's F-12 medium containing 10 ng/ml PDGF-BB was used as a chemoattractant in the lower wells. The migration assay was run for 4 h at 37 °C, and then the membrane was fixed in ice-cold methanol and stained with Giemsa solution, and cells on the upper side were removed mechanically. Cells on the lower side were counted in a microscope (×20) in three separate fields. All samples were analyzed in triplicate on four separate occasions. We analyzed HS-deficient CHO 677 cells for their ability to respond to PDGF-BB stimulation with increased tyrosine phosphorylation of PDGF α- and β-receptors. Both receptor types were expressed on the cells, and ligand stimulation led to increased tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptors, indicative of activation of their intrinsic tyrosine kinase activities (Fig. 1 A). To verify the phenotype of the cells with regard to cell surface proteoglycans, fluorescence-activated cell-sorting analysis was performed after incubation of the cells with antibodies against HS or, as a control, against CS. As seen in Fig. 1 B, the CHO 677 cells lacked expression of HS but showed CS expression comparable to that of the wild-type CHO KI cells. Based on indications in the literature that HS-related polysaccharides may affect PDGF function, we decided to examine in more detail the potential effects of heparin on PDGF receptor activation. PDGF-BB was chosen as the ligand because it binds to both PDGF receptors. We first characterized the heparin binding ability of the commercial 24,300-Da PDGF-BB in nitrocellulose filter trapping assays. PDGF-BB clearly bound to 3H-labeled heparin oligosaccharides in a dose-dependent fashion. Thus, incubation of 0.75 μm heparin (≥20-mer fragments) with PDGF-BB at physiological ionic strength resulted in saturation of the saccharide at a ∼5-fold molar excess of the protein and an estimated dissociation constant in the micromolar range. Similar results were obtained with 2-O- or 6-O-desulfated heparin oligomers, although these experiments could not be pursued to define the relative affinities of the various saccharides for the growth factor. Nevertheless, the results obtained suggest that significant proportions of the PDGF-BB added to cells in subsequent experiments were complexed to heparin or to its partially O-desulfated derivatives. Furthermore, stable complex formation between PDGF-BB and heparin was obtained in co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Immunoprecipitation was performed using antibodies against PDGF-BB or a mixture of antibodies (10E4 and HepSS-1) against HS proteoglycans, followed by immunoblotting for PDGF-BB. The 10E4 antibody probably recognizes an l-iduronic acid epitope. The HepSS-1 antibody epitope is likely an N-O-sulfated glucoronic acid-rich sequence that recognizes N-sulfates, but not free amino groups, l-iduronic acid, N-acetyl groups, or O-sulfates. There was appreciable co-precipitation of PDGF-BB with heparin, using the anti-HS monoclonal antibodies, whereas the isotype-matched control mouse serum essentially failed to precipitate PDGF-BB (Fig. 2). Washing the immobilized precipitate with 0.5 m NaCl eliminated co-precipitation with the HS antibodies. Next, HS-deficient CHO 677 cells were treated with PDGF-BB and heparin at increasing concentrations to analyze the effects on PDGF α- and β-receptor tyrosine phosphorylation. Cells were lysed, divided equally, and immunoprecipitated with antibodies specific for PDGF β- (Fig. 3 A) or α-receptors (Fig. 3 B), and samples were subjected to immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. The results showed that PDGF α-receptor tyrosine phosphorylation was amplified by heparin in a dose-dependent manner, with a maximal 4-fold effect at 100 ng/ml heparin. At higher concentrations of heparin, the level of PDGF α-receptor tyrosine phosphorylation returned to the basal level. In contrast, PDGF-BB stimulated PDGF β-receptor tyrosine phosphorylation efficiently in the absence of heparin, and the addition of the polysaccharide did not augment the reaction, set in relation to the loading control. Similar results were obtained in at least three repeated experiments; the augmenting effect of heparin on PDGF β-receptor activation was small or nonexistent, whereas the effect on the PDGF α-receptor was stable and significant. Furthermore, there was a small effect or no effect of heparin on PDGF-AA-stimulated PDGF α-receptor tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 3 C). PDGF-AA does not bind appreciably to the PDGF β-receptor, and this combination was therefore not tested. Heparin alone, in the absence of PDGF, did not induce phosphorylation of either PDGF receptor (Fig. 3 C). For comparison, wild-type CHO KI cells were treated similarly with heparin in the presence or absence of PDGF-BB, followed by immunoprecipitation of PDGF receptors and immunoblotting (Fig. 4). In these HS-expressing cells, heparin had no effect on PDGF-BB-induced PDGF α- or β-receptor tyrosine phosphorylation. The possibility that heparin may increase the affinity of PDGF-BB binding for the PDGF α-receptor was tested in a Scatchard analysis. CHO 677 cells were incubated in the presence of 1 ng/ml125I-PDGF-BB and increasing concentrations of unlabeled ligand. As shown in Fig. 5, the affinity of PDGF-BB binding to PDGF receptors expressed on CHO 677 cells was similar in the presence and absence of heparin. We further tested the effects of selectively desulfated heparin preparations on PDGF-BB-induced PDGF α- and β-receptor tyrosine phosphorylation. CHO 677 cells were treated with PDGF-BB in the absence or presence of 2-O-desulfated heparin (Fig. 6, A and B) or 6-O-desulfated heparin (Fig. 6, C and D) at different concentrations. The cells were lysed, and lysates were immunoprecipitated with PDGF β- (Fig. 6, A and C) or α-receptor (Fig. 6, B and D) antibodies. There was no appreciable effect of 2-O- or 6-O-desulfated heparin on the PDGF β-receptor, in agreement with the lack of effect of native heparin on this receptor (cf. Fig. 3 A). On the other hand, 2-O- as well as 6-O-desulfated heparin amplified PDGF-BB-induced PDGF α-receptor phosphorylation, albeit to a lower extent than native heparin. However, contrary to the pattern seen with native heparin, there was no dose-dependent decrease in PDGF α-receptor activation at higher concentrations of the desulfated heparin preparations. We examined the effect of heparin oligosaccharide size on PDGF-BB-induced PDGF receptor tyrosine phosphorylation. As expected, heparin fragments from four monosaccharide units to full-length heparin showed little or no effect on PDGF β-receptor tyrosine phosphorylation in the CHO 677 cells (Fig. 7 A). In contrast, PDGF α-receptor tyrosine phosphorylation in the same cells was induced 4-fold by PDGF-BB in the presence of the 4-mer at 100 ng/ml (Fig. 7 B). Treatment with the decasaccharide fragment led to 6-fold amplification of PDGF α-receptor tyrosine phosphorylation by PDGF-BB, whereas longer saccharide fragments were slightly less efficient. To test potential effects of heparin on signal transduction, CHO 677 cells were treated with heparin at different doses in combination with a low dose of PDGF-BB. Heparin augmented MAPK and PKB/Akt phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 8), indicative of HS-modulated activation of these signaling components in the intact, PDGF-BB-stimulated cell. To determine whether co-treatment with heparin would increase cellular responsiveness to PDGF-BB, we analyzed directed migration of CHO 677 cells, compared with CHO KI cells, under different conditions as shown in Fig. 9. The HS-expressing CHO KI cells displayed a relatively high basal migration and only a slight increase in migration toward PDGF-BB; there was no appreciable additional stimulation when cells also received heparin. The CHO 677 cells also migrated poorly toward PDGF-BB, but the addition of heparin significantly augmented the chemotactic migration of the cells. In this study, we show that the addition of heparin augmented PDGF-BB-induced activation of the PDGF α-receptor, but not PDGF β-receptor, in HS-deficient CHO 677 cells expressing endogenous PDGF receptors. Moreover, heparin promoted PDGF-BB-induced intracellular signaling and increased chemotaxis of such cells. Heparin alone had no effect on PDGF receptor tyrosine phosphorylation. The lack of effect of heparin on PDGF β-receptor tyrosine phosphorylation is in agreement with previous data (27Pukac L.A. Carter J.E. Ottlinger M.E. Karnovsky M.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1997; 172: 69-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Moreover, heparin had no effect on PDGF-AA-stimulated PDGF α-receptor tyrosine phosphorylation. The effect of heparin on the PDGF-BB-stimulated PDGF α-receptor did not appear to be due to increased binding affinity. However, the CHO 677 cells express both PDGF α- and β- receptors, and it is possible that PDGF-BB binding to the PDGF β-receptor obscured any heparin-related changes in affinity for the PDGF α-receptor. The dose-dependent effect of heparin was maximal at around 100 ng/ml heparin, whereas higher concentrations of 1–5 μg/ml lacked effect. Short oligosaccharide fragments (4-mers and longer) were active in this model. Heparin lacking either the 2-O-sulfate groups on iduronic acid units or the 6-O-sulfate groups on glucosamine units retained the ability to augment PDGF-BB-induced PDGF α-receptor activation, although the effect was reduced, and the dose-response pattern was changed. Notably, there was no absolute requirement for heparin in PDGF α-receptor activation by PDGF-BB. This is in agreement with previous data on chlorate-treated fibroblasts deficient in cell surface HS, which still respond to PDGF-BB with increased mitogenic activity (28Rapraeger A.C. Krufka A. Olwin B.B. Science. 1991; 252: 1705-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (1290) Google Scholar). Previous reports in the literature indicate that PDGF-BB does indeed bind heparin and that biological responses to PDGF may depend on interaction with HS. Thus, heparin-binding fragments from fibronectin (29Chon J.H. Chaikof E.L. Am. J. Physiol. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 280: C1394-C1402Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or apolipoprotein E (30Swertfeger D.K. Hui D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25043-25048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) negatively modulate proliferative responses to PDGF-BB. Furthermore, PDGF-BB may be deposited in the matrix through binding to heparan sulfate proteoglycans because treatment with heparatinase I allows release of biologically active growth factor (16Sundberg C. Branting M. Gerdin B. Rubin K. Am. J. Pathol. 1997; 151: 479-492PubMed Google Scholar). Binding of heparin to the long PDGF-AA isoform is dependent on N-, 2-O-, and 6-O-sulfation (31Feyzi E. Lustig F. Fager G. Spillmann D. Lindahl U. Salmivirta M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5518-5524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar); the minimal size binding to PDGF-AAL is an octasaccharide. The long PDGF-A isoform contains an 18-amino acid residue polybasic stretch encoded by the alternatively spliced exon 6 in the PDGF-A chain gene. The PDGF-B isoform contains a similar but not identical polybasic stretch encoded by exon 6 in the PDGF-B chain gene. This stretch is proteolytically removed to generate the mature processed PDGF-BB. The removal of the polybasic stretch does not preclude heparin binding because the short PDGF-AA isoform, which lacks this stretch, still binds heparin, although with reduced affinity (32Fager G. Camejo G. Olsson U. Östergren-Lunden G. Lustig F. Bondjers G. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 163: 380-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Furthermore, three basic residues in the loop III receptor-binding domain present in the short and long form of PDGF-BB have been identified as important for heparin binding (33Schilling D. Reid I.J. Hujer A. Morgan D. Demoll E. Bummer P. Fenstermaker R.A. Kaetzel D.M. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 637-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The commercially available short form of PDGF-BB (Mr 24,300) used in this study presumably lacked the exon 6-encoded polybasic heparin-binding sequence but nevertheless retained binding capacity for heparin and modified heparin fragments as shown in a filter binding assay. The mode of action of heparin/HS in relation to PDGF-BB and its PDGF α-receptor remains unclear. The effect appears highly specific for this combination of ligand and receptor because heparin did not modulate PDGF-AA-stimulated PDGF α-receptor tyrosine phosphorylation. This is compatible with the observation that PDGF-AA and -BB bind with different affinities and induce different conformational changes in the PDGF α-receptor extracellular domain (34Mahadevan D. Yu J.C. Saldanha J.W. Thanki N. McPhie P. Uren A. LaRochelle W.J. Heidaran M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27595-27600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The possibility that heparin/HS may physically interact not only with growth factors but also with their receptors has been argued for fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) and the corresponding receptors (FGFRs) (35Plotnikov A.N. Schlessinger J. Hubbard S.R. Mohammadi M. Cell. 1999; 98: 641-650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar, 36Gao G. Goldfarb M.

Chem. 1993; 268: 23906-23914Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, x-ray crystallography studies of ternary complexes show heparin oligosaccharides in contact with both FGF and FGFR proteins (35Plotnikov A.N. Schlessinger J. Hubbard S.R. Mohammadi M. Cell. 1999; 98: 641-650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar, 39Pellegrini L. Burke D.F. von Delft F. Mulloy B. Blundell T.L. Nature. 2000; 407: 1029-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). We do not know whether PDGF receptor ectodomains bind heparin/HS. The interaction between heparin and FGFR-1 appears to involve a basic stretch, denoted K18K, in the FGFR-1 extracellular domain (residues Lys160 to Lys177) (40Kan M. Wang F., Xu, J. Crabb J.W. Hou J. McKeehan W.L. Science. 1993; 259: 1918-1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). Although there is no obvious polybasic region in the PDGF α-receptor extracellular domain, there is some sequence similarity between the FGFR-1 K18K sequence and regions in the PDGF α-receptor (data not shown); such a similarity is not recorded for the PDGF β-receptor in homology searches. Additional studies are needed to show whether the PDGF α-receptor binds heparin with any measurable affinity. Our observation that PDGF α-receptor activation by PDGF-BB is augmented not only by full-sized heparin but also by relatively short oligosaccharides would seem to argue against a bridging function for the saccharide in a ternary complex with growth factor and receptor. However, we note that similar (and unexplained) effects of small saccharides have been observed also in connection with FGF action (41Ornitz D.M. Herr A.B. Nilsson N. Westman J. Svahn C.M. Waksman G. Science. 1995; 268: 432-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar,42Ostrovsky O. Berman B. Gallagher J. Mulloy B. Fernig D.G. Delhedde M. Ron D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2444-2453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Several additional possibilities may be considered. Saccharide binding may change the conformation of PDGF-BB in such a way that its interaction with the PDGF α-receptor, but not with the PDGF β-receptor, is promoted. Alternatively, receptor binding of the saccharide may selectively make the PDGF α-receptor more receptive to the growth factor. On the other hand, the involvement of a more extended “bridging” domain could explain why the receptor-stimulatory effect decreases at higher heparin concentrations; under these conditions, the probability of binding PDGF-BB and its receptor to the same polysaccharide chain will decrease. Conversely, the partially O-desulfated heparin derivatives may present fewer binding sites along the chain, thus explaining the persistent stimulation at higher saccharide concentration. Finally, we cannot exclude the possibility that the selective effect of heparin on PDGF α-receptor phosphorylation is mediated by an as yet unidentified protein ligand(s). Notably, FGF-2 stimulation of FGF receptor-1 in the absence of heparin/HS elicits FGF receptor activation and signal transduction, but the spectrum of autophosphorylation sites employed and the range of signal transduction pathways that become initiated are limited compared with stimulation in the presence of heparin. 2L. Lundin, L. Rönnstrand, U. Lindahl, and L. Claesson-Welsh, submitted for publication. These data indicate that signal transduction by receptor tyrosine kinases can be directed by heparin-mediated changes in receptor conformation or by effects on other properties of the kinase. Our data indicate that signal transduction and cellular responses to PDGF-BB are augmented by heparin. Whether this effect is purely quantitative or also qualitative is an interesting issue for future studies.

These interactions activate many intracellular signaling pathways that regulate processes such as cell adhesion, migration, and survival. Here we demonstrate that cells lacking Src family kinases showed reduced ability to assemble FN fibrils as detected by immunofluorescence and by analysis of detergent extracts. The amount of FN matrix was further reduced by treatment with the phosphatidylinositol 3 (PI 3-kinase) inhibitor, wortmannin. CHOα5 cells, which are dependent on exogenous FN to initiate fibril formation, also showed significant reductions in matrix when treated with inhibitors of Src and PI 3-kinase. Combination of both inhibitors showed an additive inhibitory effect on assembly, which was concomitant with a loss of focal adhesion kinase phosphorylation. Decreased binding of the 70-kDa amino-terminal FN fragment at matrix assembly sites further supports a role for these kinases early during the process.

Composition of the matrix varies from tissue to tissue; however, FN is a major component of most matrices (1Mosher, D. F. (ed) (1989) Fibronectin, Academic Press, New YorkGoogle Scholar,2Hynes R.O. Fibronectins. Springer-Verlag, New York1990Crossref Google Scholar). FN influences diverse processes including inflammation, wound repair, malignant metastasis, microorganism attachment, and thrombosis. It does this not as a soluble protein but as a major component of a fibrillar network. FN is assembled into fibrils through a regulated stepwise process (3Schwarzbauer J.E. Sechler J.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 622-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The initiation of matrix assembly depends on interaction of FN with its cell surface receptor α5β1 integrin. FN binding induces integrin interactions with the actin cytoskeleton inside the cell, whereas addition of FN dimers to growing multimers results in elongation of fibrils outside. Fibrils are then gradually converted into detergent-insoluble stable matrix. extracellular matrix fibronectin phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase Chinese hamster ovary focal adhesion kinase cells lacking Src family kinases rhodamine-labeled 70-kDa fragment phosphate-buffered saline plasma FN mitogen-activated protein MAP kinase extracellular signal-regulated kinase Integrin-mediated interactions with FN-coated substrates induce reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and associated proteins and lead to the formation of focal adhesions (4Geiger B. Bershadsky A. Pankov R. Yamada K.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 793-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (1857) Google Scholar). These sites contain a multitude of cytoskeletal and adapter proteins such as vinculin, paxillin, and talin as well as signal transduction molecules such as focal adhesion kinase (FAK), Src family kinases, and protein kinase C. Many of these focal adhesion components are multidomain molecules that can interact with several distinct partners. Focal adhesions have been shown to serve both structural and functional roles as the sites where activation of intracellular pathways takes place. Some of these pathways have been implicated in FN matrix assembly. For example, treatment of fibroblasts with phorbol esters or other protein kinase C activators resulted in increased FN binding to the cell surface (5Somers C.E. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22277-22280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An FN fragment containing the first type III repeat, which can modify FN matrix assembly (6Hocking D.C. Smith R.K.

Interaction of FN with integrins also results in activation of FAK, which then binds to the signaling proteins Src (10Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T. Curr. Opin.

Chem. 1999; 274: 24425-24430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Src associates with FAK through direct interaction of its Src homology (SH)2 domain with the major autophosphorylation site Tyr-397 on FAK. Association of Src with FAK is believed to be important for reciprocal activation of those two kinases (14Guan J.L. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 1085-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Src binding to FAK leads to phosphorylation of additional tyrosine residues on FAK that not only create new binding sites but also increase FAK catalytic activity (15Calalb M.B. Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 954-963Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Src/FAK complex formation results in phosphorylation of other proteins such as paxillin, tensin, and p130cas. The Tyr-397 site on FAK also serves as a binding site for PI 3-kinase. Integrin-induced PI 3-kinase association with FAK has been demonstrated in platelets (16Guinebault C. Payrastre B. Racaud-Sultan C. Mazarguil H. Breton M. Mauco G. Plantavid M. Chap H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 831-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) and fibroblasts (17Chen H.C. Guan J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10148-10152Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated previously that a mutant FN, which forms a structurally altered FN matrix, inhibited phosphorylation of FAK and blocked cell cycle progression (18Sechler J.L. Schwarzbauer J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25533-25536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The role of signaling effectors downstream of FAK in the assembly of FN into fibrils has not been extensively studied. Here we investigated the requirement for active Src and PI 3-kinase in FN matrix assembly. We demonstrate that both Src and PI 3-kinase regulate early stages of matrix assembly, suggesting that FAK acts through multiple pathways to regulate matrix formation. SYF and SYFwtSrc cells were a kind gift from Dr. Philippe Soriano (Fred Hutchison Cancer Center, Seattle, WA). Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. CHOα5 cells (19Sechler J.L. Takada Y. Schwarzbauer J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 573-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum (HyClone Laboratories), 2 mm glutamine, 1% nonessential amino acids, and 100 μg/ml Geneticin (Invitrogen). To prepare FN-depleted serum, fetal calf serum was passed over a gelatin-agarose column as described (20Engvall E. Ruoslahti E. Int. J. Cancer. 1977; 20: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (1429) Google Scholar). PP1 was a gift from Dr. Kevan Shokat (UCSF). Radicicol was obtained from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA), wortmannin from Calbiochem, and LY294002 from Promega (Madison, WI). PT-66 anti-phosphotyrosine-specific monoclonal antibody was purchased from Sigma, and (anti-[Tyr(P)-577]FAK) antibody was purchased from BioSource International (Camarillo, CA). Cells were plated at 1.5 × 105 cells/well on 24-well plates with glass coverslips. SYF cells were allowed to attach for 1 h before the addition of FN, whereas CHOα5 cells (which do not make FN) attached and spread overnight. Spread cells were then incubated with 25 μg/ml rat plasma FN (pFN). In some experiments, 5 μm PP1 and/or 100 nm wortmannin were added to the cells along with FN. After the desired incubation time, cells were fixed and stained with IC3 anti-rat FN monoclonal antibody (1:1,000 dilution) (19Sechler J.L. Takada Y. Schwarzbauer J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 573-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) followed by incubation with fluorescein-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) (1:600 dilution) and rhodamine-phalloidin (Molecular Probes) (1:1,000 dilution). Coverslips were mounted with FluoroGuard Antifade reagent (Bio-Rad). Fibrils were visualized with a Nikon Optiphot microscope with epifluorescence. Images were captured using a CoolSNAP digital camera (RP Photometrics, Tucson, AZ). Cells were plated at 1.5 × 105cells/well on 24-well plates and incubated with 25 μg/ml rat pFN and/or inhibitors for indicated times using the same conditions as described for immunofluorescence staining. Deoxycholate-soluble and -insoluble fractions were isolated and analyzed as described previously (19Sechler J.L. Takada Y. Schwarzbauer J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 573-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Total protein concentration was determined using BCA protein assay (Pierce). Equal amounts of total protein reduced with 0.1m dithiothreitol were electrophoresed on 5% polyacrylamide SDS gel and transferred to nitrocellulose for immunodetection using a 1:10,000 dilution of IC3 anti-rat FN ascites fluid followed with 1:40,000 dilution of goat anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Pierce). Immunoblots were developed with chemiluminescence reagents (Pierce). Equal amounts of total protein from deoxycholate-insoluble fractions were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. After overnight incubation in blocking buffer (5% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl)), the membranes were incubated with a 1:10,000 dilution of IC3 monoclonal antibody for 1 h and then with 1 μg/ml unconjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG (Pierce) for 1 h, both in blocking buffer. 6 μCi of 125I-protein A (specific activity 10 mCi/mg, ICN Pharmaceuticals, Costa Mesa, CA) in 10 ml of blocking buffer was then used for a 1-h incubation as described by Sechler et al. (19Sechler J.L. Takada Y. Schwarzbauer J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 573-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The membranes were then exposed to a phosphor storage screen and analyzed using an Amersham Biosciences Storm 860. The amount of radioactivity associated with each band was measured. The number of counts for untreated cells was regarded as 100%. The number of counts for cells treated with inhibitors was calculated in comparison with untreated cells. Results are presented as the means ± S.E. of three independent experiments. Glass coverslips in 24-well plates were coated overnight with 10 μg/ml human pFN in PBS at 4 °C. Coverslips were washed with PBS, and 1 × 105 cells/well were placed in 500 μl of FN-depleted medium containing 25 μg/ml rhodamine-labeled 70-kDa fragment (Rh-70 kDa). The 70-kDa fragment of FN was prepared using the baculovirus expression system (21Aguirre K.M. McCormick R.J. Schwarzbauer J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27863-27868Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and labeled with N-hydroxysuccinimide-rhodamine as suggested by the manufacturer (Pierce). Cells were incubated for 30 and 120 min in the presence or absence of 5 μm PP1, 100 nmwortmannin, or both inhibitors. After incubation cells were gently rinsed with PBS + 0.5 mm MgCl2 and fixed with fresh formaldehyde solution (3.7% in PBS) for 15 min at room temperature. Coverslips were mounted with FluoroGuard Antifade reagent (Bio-Rad). Rh-70 kDa rhodamine was visualized using a Nikon Optiphot microscope with epifluorescence. Images were captured using a CoolSNAP digital camera (RP Photometrics). Cells were plated at 1.2 × 105 cells/well on 24-well plates, allowed to attach and spread for ∼2 h, and incubated in serum-depleted medium overnight. The cells then were incubated in complete medium in the presence of 25 μg/ml rat pFN for 15, 30, and 60 min. After incubation, cells were washed with cold PBS and lysed with 200 μl of modified radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1% Triton, 1% Na-deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS). 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mmNa4P2O7, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 100 units/ml aprotinin were used as different enzyme inhibitors. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 4 °C for 15 min at 14,000 rpm. Supernatant was collected, and total protein concentration was determined using BCA protein assay (Pierce). 2 μg of total protein reduced with 0.1 m dithiothreitol was resolved by 7% polyacrylamide SDS gel and transferred to nitrocellulose. Immunoblot analysis was performed as for the deoxycholate lysates except a 1:3,300 dilution of PT-66 anti-phosphotyrosine antibody was used. SYF fibroblasts lacking three Src family kinases (Src, Yes, and Fyn) display no Src-related kinase activity but will attach and spread on FN-coated substrates (22Klinghoffer R.A. Sachsenmaier C. Cooper J.A. Soriano P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2459-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). To examine the requirement for Src kinases in integrin-mediated assembly of FN matrix, assembly of FN fibrils was monitored by immunofluorescence. SYF cells were compared with SYFwtSrc cells, which are SYF cells transfected with wtSrc cDNA. Exogenous rat pFN was included in the medium to ensure a sufficient supply of FN. Both cell lines assembled FN into a fibrillar matrix; however, SYFwtSrc cells appeared to assemble more matrix than SYF cells (Fig. 1). Analysis of deoxycholate-insoluble matrix fractions showed that over a 5-h period SYF cells assembled significantly less matrix than SYFwtSrc cells (Fig. 2A). Very early time points were examined to determine the ability of these cells to initiate assembly. To enhance our ability to examine assembly at early times, chemiluminescence exposures were increased for samples from shorter time points. A difference was detected at the earliest time point, 15 min after adding FN to the medium (Fig. 2B). SYFwtSrc cells produced detectable FN matrix by this time, whereas SYF cells showed very little FN matrix (even 30 min after addition of FN). This delayed assembly of FN matrix by SYF cells suggests that Src family kinases may regulate the early stages of FN matrix assembly.Figure 2Analysis of deoxycholate-insoluble FN matrix. SYF and SYFwtSrc cells were incubated with 25 μg/ml pFN for 1, 3, and 5 h (A) or 15, 30, 60, and 120 min (B). The cells were then lysed with deoxycholate lysis buffer, and equal amounts of total protein were separated by 5% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. FN was detected using rat-specific monoclonal antibody IC3 followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG and chemiluminescence reagents.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Products of PI 3-kinase activity such as PIP2 are involved in integrin-related processes, and PI 3-kinase itself acts to integrate multiple pathways downstream of integrins (23King W.G.

Chem. 1999; 274: 12361-12366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). We therefore tested the requirement for active PI 3-kinase in SYF cells. SYF cells were incubated with FN in the presence of wortmannin, a PI 3-kinase inhibitor (26Wymann M.P. Bulgarelli-Leva G. Zvelebil M.J. Pirola L. Vanhaesebroeck B. Waterfield M.D. Panayotou G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1722-1733Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3A, wortmannin treatment resulted in almost complete inhibition of deoxycholate-insoluble FN matrix formation. No major effects of wortmannin on actin stress fibers were observed (Fig. 3B). These results show that together functional Src kinases and PI 3-kinase play a regulatory role in matrix formation by acting to enhance initiation of FN fibril assembly. A third pathway downstream of integrins leads to ERK/MAP kinase activation. Inhibition of this pathway with the MEK1 inhibitor PD98059 had no effect on initiation of fibril formation (data not shown). SYF cells produce endogenous FN, which makes it difficult to control the timing of assembly by addition of FN. Therefore, we used CHO cells transfected with human α5 cDNA (CHOα5 cells) (19Sechler J.L. Takada Y. Schwarzbauer J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 573-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) because these cells lack an endogenous FN matrix but are capable of assembling a matrix when provided with exogenous FN. CHOα5 cells were allowed to attach overnight and were then incubated in fresh medium containing 25 μg/ml rat pFN plus the Src inhibitor PP1 (27Hanke J.H. Gardner J.P. Dow R.L. Changelian P.S. Brissette W.H. Weringer E.J. Pollok B.A. Connelly P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 695-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1790) Google Scholar). CHOα5 cells in the absence of PP1 assembled an extensive matrix between and on top of the cells (Fig. 4A). In contrast, cells incubated with PP1 formed less matrix, with fibrils mainly between cells even after 6 h of incubation (Fig. 4A). A dramatic difference in deoxycholate-insoluble material was also observed at times up to 6 h (Fig. 4B). Treatment of CHOα5 cells with another Src inhibitor, radicicol (28Kwon H.J. Yoshida M. Fukui Y. Horinouchi S. Beppu T. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 6926-6930PubMed Google Scholar), also inhibited FN matrix assembly similarly to PP1 (data not shown). Similar to SYF cells, assembly was perturbed at a very early stage with reduced deoxycholate-insoluble material observed as early as 30 min (Fig. 5A). This process was also inhibited by wortmannin, although the level of inhibition appeared lower than with PP1 (Fig. 5A). Addition of Src and PI 3-kinase inhibitors together resulted in almost complete inhibition of FN matrix assembly over a 2-h incubation. No major effects of these inhibitors on actin stress fibers were noted (Fig. 5C). The effect of LY294002, another PI 3-kinase inhibitor (29Vlahos C.J. Matter W.F. Hui K.Y. Brown R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5241-5248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), on FN matrix assembly was identical to that of wortmannin (data not shown). In combination, inhibition of Src and PI 3-kinase caused a dramatic decrease in the amount of FN matrix. Quantitation of deoxycholate-insoluble fractions revealed that during 2 h of assembly both inhibitors together reduced matrix to about one-quarter of the control level (Fig. 5B). This level of inhibition was twice as high as when either inhibitor was added alone, suggesting that the combined effects of Src and PI 3-kinase on FN matrix assembly are additive. We also observed that after only 1 h the effect of wortmannin was much less than that of PP1, suggesting that Src may affect matrix formation earlier than PI 3-kinase (not shown). FN assembly into fibrils is a stepwise process that is initiated through α5β1 integrin binding to FN. Clustering of receptors promotes fibrillogenesis, which requires FN-FN interactions mediated by the amino-terminal domain and multimerization of FN dimers into fibrils (30Schwarzbauer J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 1463-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The 70-kDa amino-terminal fragment of FN (which contains a FN self-association site) can be used to identify sites of assembly within the matrix (6Hocking D.C. Smith R.K. McKeown-Longo P.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 431-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar,31Dzamba B.J. Bultmann H. Akiyama S.K. Peters D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19646-19652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 70-kDa fragment binding is dependent on interactions with intact FN immobilized within newly formed matrix fibrils (32Sottile J. Wiley S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17192-17198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether Src and PI 3-kinase activities are required for formation of matrix assembly sites, the presence of these sites was detected with rhodamine-labeled 70-kDa fragment (Rh-70 kDa). CHOα5 cells were plated on FN-coated glass coverslips in medium containing Rh-70 kDa and in the presence or absence of PP1, wortmannin, or both inhibitors. CHOα5 cells reorganized the surface-coated FN into short fibrils that generated binding sites for Rh-70 kDa within 30 min with more extensive incorporation by 2 h (Fig. 6, A and A′). PP1 (Fig. 6, B and B′) and wortmannin (Fig. 6,C and C′) alone inhibited formation of Rh-70 kDa binding sites. The inhibitory effects were strongest, however, when PP1 and wortmannin were used in combination (Fig. 6, D and D′). These results demonstrate that active Src and PI 3-kinase are required for formation of FN matrix assembly sites and indicate that these enzymes regulate initiation of FN fibril assembly. Both PI 3-kinase and Src family kinases interact with FAK and are involved in activation of downstream pathways. SYF cells plated on FN-coated substrate do not show FAK phosphorylation (22Klinghoffer R.A. Sachsenmaier C. Cooper J.A. Soriano P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2459-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). To determine whether FAK activation correlates with FN matrix assembly, levels of FAK phosphorylation were analyzed. SYF cells showed no detectable FAK phosphorylation during the time course of this experiment (Fig. 7). In contrast, significant levels of FAK phosphorylation were observed in SYFwtSrc cells during the same period. Identical results were obtained when FAK phosphorylation was detected using FAK Tyr-577 phosphospecific antibody (anti-[Tyr(P)-577]FAK) (data not shown). Perturbation in FAK phosphorylation correlates with the timing of reduced FN assembly. Interestingly, FAK-null fibroblasts show very little detectable deoxycholate-insoluble FN matrix. 2D. Ilic and C. Damsky, manuscript in preparation. Taken together, these results suggest that stimulation of Src and PI 3-kinase by FAK is required for efficient initiation of FN matrix assembly. In this report, we show using two different cell systems that inhibition of Src by mutation of Src family kinase genes in SYF cells or with Src-specific inhibitors in CHOα5 cells results in significant reduction of FN matrix assembly. A further reduction in matrix was seen with concomitant inhibition of PI 3-kinase activity. The major effects of blocking kinase action occurred early during fibril formation and could be demonstrated by detergent insolubility as well as by monitoring development of matrix assembly sites with 70-kDa binding. Both Src and PI 3-kinase lie immediately downstream of FAK. Inhibition of MAP kinase signaling, a third pathway downstream of FAK, had no effect on initiation of fibril formation. Therefore, we propose that a subset of signaling pathways activated by FAK are essential for proper initiation of FN matrix assembly. Src family kinases govern many cellular functions such as growth factor-induced proliferation and gene expression, ECM-promoted adhesion, spreading, migration, and protection from apoptosis (33Brown M.T.

Mutation of three ubiquitous members (Src, Yes, and Fyn) leads to severe developmental defects and lethality by mid-gestation. Interestingly, the SYF triple mutant embryonic defects resemble those of FN-null embryos, suggesting overlapping functions during development (22Klinghoffer R.A. Sachsenmaier C. Cooper J.A. Soriano P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2459-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar, 37George E.L. Georges-Labouesse E.N. Patel-King R.S. Rayburn H. Hynes R.O. Development. 1993; 119: 1079-1091Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SYF cells are able to adhere to FN substrata but show dramatically reduced FN-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation (22Klinghoffer R.A. Sachsenmaier C. Cooper J.A. Soriano P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2459-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). Similarly, we found that FAK phosphorylation was ablated in SYF cells during matrix assembly and that this reduction in phosphorylation correlated with decreased fibril formation. In contrast, SYF cells overexpressing c-Src showed FN-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion proteins (including FAK) as well as normal levels of FN fibrils. These findings provide evidence for a link between Src kinase activity and FN matrix assembly. PI 3-kinase phosphorylates phosphatidylinositol and together with its lipid derivatives acts as a second messenger in a variety of signaling pathways including cell survival through activation of PKB/Akt (23King W.G.

Chem. 1996; 271: 26329-26334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar) and has been shown to associate with FAK upon integrin activation in platelets (16Guinebault C. Payrastre B. Racaud-Sultan C. Mazarguil H. Breton M. Mauco G. Plantavid M. Chap H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 831-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) and fibroblasts (17Chen H.C. Guan J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10148-10152Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that PI 3-kinase also regulates FN fibril formation. In combination, inhibition of both Src and PI 3-kinase dramatically reduced FN matrix assembly. At 2 h the effect was twice as potent as with either inhibitor used alone, suggesting that the effects are additive. Interestingly, however, we consistently observed that Src activity was required at the earliest times tested, although PI 3-kinase inhibition had its major impact after 2 h. This suggests that although both kinases participate in this process, their roles are not identical. A major mechanism of activation of Src and PI 3-kinase is through binding to phosphorylated FAK in response to integrin ligation by FN (43Schwartz M.A. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 466-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 44Zhao J.H. Guan J.L. Prog. Mol. Subcell. Biol. 2000; 25: 37-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 45Shen T.L. Guan J.L. FEBS Lett. 2001; 499: 176-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). FAK itself has been implicated in regulatory responses to FN matrix in that alterations in FN matrix structure modulate the level of FAK tyrosine phosphorylation (18Sechler J.L. Schwarzbauer J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25533-25536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In addition, FAK-null cells show a dramatically reduced ability to assemble FN matrix 3D. Ilic and C. Damsky, manuscript in preparation; I. Wierzbicka-Patynowski, unpublished data. although the ability to attach to immobilized FN is only slightly impaired (46Ilic D. Furuta Y. Kanazawa S. Takeda N. Sobue K. Nakatsuji N. Nomura S. Fujimoto J. Okada M. Yamamoto T. Nature. 1995; 377: 539-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1591) Google Scholar). One plausible model for regulation of integrin-mediated FN fibril initiation is that active FAK recruits Src and PI 3-kinase, which in turn transduce downstream signals required to initiate and maintain propagation of FN fibrils. Inhibition of any one of these kinases, either through mutation or with specific inhibitors, reduces the extent of fibril formation. There is evidence that association of Src with FAK may further stimulate both kinases (14Guan J.L. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 1085-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Similarly, the inhibition of PI 3-kinase leads to partial inhibition of FAK tyrosine phosphorylation in COS7 cells (23King W.G. Mattaliano M.D. Chan T.O. Tsichlis P.N. Brugge J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4406-4418Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that there may be a feedback loop between FAK, Src, and PI 3-kinase that results in mutual activation of these signaling components through direct interactions. Both Src and PI 3-kinase bind to phosphorylated Tyr-397 on FAK, presenting an attractive idea that cells require phosphorylation of this tyrosine to regulate matrix assembly. The initial interaction of FN dimers with cell surface receptors leads to receptor clustering, which not only promotes FN self-association but also connects FN to the actin cytoskeleton. Both an intact cytoskeleton and the β integrin cytoplasmic domain are required for FN matrix assembly (47Solowska J. Guan J.L. Marcantonio E.E. Trevithick J.E. Buck C.A. Hynes R.O. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 853-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 48Wu C. Kevins V. O'Toole T.E. McDonald J.A. Ginsberg M.H. Cell. 1995; 83: 715-724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Choquet et al. (49Choquet D. Felsenfeld D.P. Sheetz M.P. Cell. 1997; 88: 39-48Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1074) Google Scholar) showed that initial connections between FN, α5β1 integrin, and actin filaments are relatively weak in adherent cells but become reinforced in response to applied force. This strengthening mechanism appears to require phosphoproteins, although the specific components have not been reported. It seems likely that reinforcement of cell-FN connections is also required during fibril assembly. FAK, Src, and/or PI 3-kinase may contribute to reinforcement of transmembrane connections because integrins assemble FN fibrils and may thus represent some of the necessary phosphoproteins. We did not observe any major effects of Src and PI 3-kinase inhibitors on actin stress fibers, but it remains possible that these kinases exert effects by strengthening existing links between integrins and actin. The deposition of FN into the ECM is a complex, integrin-dependent, and highly regulated process. The ECM has important effects on cell morphology, growth, and gene expression. Defects in matrix organization contribute to disease and developmental defects. Therefore, it is important to understand regulation of FN matrix formation. The data presented here demonstrate that Src and PI 3-kinase, two downstream effectors of FAK, are important in this regulation, particularly during initiation. Assembly is a multistep process, and other signaling molecules have been implicated in both early and late stages, further demonstrating the complexities of regulating FN fibril formation. It remains possible that other signaling molecules downstream of FAK, such as Grb7 (50Han D.C. Shen T.L. Guan J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28911-28917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) or the γ1 isoform of phospholipase C (51Zhang X. Chattopadhyay A. Ji Q.S. Owen J.D. Ruest P.J.

Clearly, further investigation is needed to sort out the intracellular components that control each step of FN matrix assembly. We thank Drs. Hisaaki Kawakatsu and Dusko Ilic from UCSF for helpful discussions and Nedra Guckert for technical assistance."

This structural characteristic could contribute to the binding of substrate fatty acyl chains (for PI) but also to the binding of the PC activator. Tryptophan residues are often elements inserted into bilayers when a peripheral protein binds (e.g. annexin V (10Pigault C. Follenius-Wund A. Chabbert M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 484-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) or phospholipase A2 (11Sumandea M. Das S. Sumandea C. Cho W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16290-16297Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar)). Two of the seven tryptophans (Trp-47 and Trp-242) in PI-PLC are among the exposed hydrophobic amino acids. Their structural orientation is consistent with previous spectroscopic data (12Volwerk J.J. Filthuth E. Griffith O.H. Jain M.K. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3464-3474Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 13Zhou C. Roberts M.F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16430-16439Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), which showed enzyme intrinsic fluorescence increases significantly upon binding to micelles or vesicles. However, the details of any conformational changes in the proteins induced by activating surfaces have not yet been investigated. A definition for where activator molecules versus substrate acyl chains bind is needed to understand how the kinetic activation occurs. If helix B and loop 237–243 at the opening of active site are involved in lipid activation of the protein, mutations of the tryptophans in each element should affect PI-PLC intrinsic fluorescence and may alter the kinetic activation by PC surfaces. To test this hypothesis, we prepared the following mutant PI-PLCs: W47A, W242A, the double mutant W47A/W242A, W47F, W47I, W242F, and W242I. These were characterized for kinetic activation of PI and cIP hydrolysis by diC7PC and organic solvent, ability to bind to PC interfaces (comparing both intrinsic fluorescence and a filtration assays), and any changes in secondary structure (analyzed by CD spectroscopy). As controls, two other tryptophans were mutated: W178A and W280A. Trp-178 fulfills a dual function in PI-PLC by separating the bottom of the active site from the core of the protein and by forming a hydrogen bond with the side chain of Asp-198, a residue shown to be critical for substrate binding. The conservative replacement of Trp-178 by tyrosine eliminates the hydrogen bonding potential between position Trp-178 and Asp-198 and has been shown to decrease the rate of PI hydrolysis (14Gassler C.S. Ryan M. Liu T. Griffith O.H. Heinz D.W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12802-12813Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). W178A was prepared to see how this change affects enzyme fluorescence as well as kinetic activation by interfaces. Trp-280 is located in the C-terminal loop that connects with the eighth strand and helix of the αβ-barrel; it is far away from the hypothesized activator binding and the active sites. Modification of this residue should play little role in substrate and activator binding. Analyses of these mutant PI-PLCs show that the two tryptophan residues Trp-47 and Trp-242 are critical for the enzyme to bind to zwitterionic activating interfaces. Trp-242 is also the major fluorophore responding to micelle binding. POPC, diC6PC, diC7PC, and PI were purchased from Avanti; crude PI for preparing cIP was purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. diC6PA was prepared from the corresponding short-chain PCs using Streptomyces chromofuscus phospholipase D (13Zhou C. Roberts M.F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16430-16439Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). cIP was prepared from PI as described previously (8Zhou C., Wu, Y. Roberts M.F. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 347-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). myo-Inositol was purchased from Sigma. A plasmid containing the B. thuringiensisPI-PLC gene obtained from Dr. Ming-Daw Tsai (Ohio State University) was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 cells (BL21-Codonplus(DE3)-RIL from Stratagene). Overexpression of the recombinant protein was induced by addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (0.8 mm) to the E. coli grown at 37 °C to an A600 ∼ 0.7 in LB medium, pH 7.0, containing ampicillin and chloramphenicol. Continued incubation until A600 reached 1.2 (2–3 h) yielded a reasonable amount of PI-PLC protein in the cytoplasm. After centrifugation, the cell pellet was lysed by sonication, and the solution was centrifuged again. The supernatant was subjected to two chromatographic steps, a Q-Sepharose fast flow column followed by a phenyl-Sepharose column, to purify the PI-PLC. Millipore Centraplus 10 filters were used to concentrate the protein. All of the mutations of the PI-PLC gene were carried out by QuikChange methodology (15Braman J. Papworth C. Greener A. Methods Mol. Biol. 1996; 57: 31-44PubMed Google Scholar, 16Wang W. Malcolm B.A. BioTechniques. 1999; 26: 680-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar) using a site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene. Two complimentary mutagenic primers (all purchased from Operon) containing the desired mutation (codon indicated in bold) were annealed to the same sequence on opposite strands of the plasmid. The 33 base mutagenic primers CCGATTAAGCAAGTGGCG GGAATGACGCAAG, CCGATTAAGCAAGTGATC GGAATGACGCAAG, and CCGATTAAGCAAGTGTTC GGAATGACGCAAG were used for W47A, W47I, and W47F; for W242A, W242I, and W242F, the mutagenic primers were CTTCTGGTGGTACAGCAGCG AATAGTCCATATTAC, CTTCTGGTGGTACAGCAATC AATAGTCCATATTAC, and CTTCTGGTGGTACAGCATTC AATAGTCCATATTAC. Construction of the double mutant W47A/W242A introduced a second mutation (W242A) into the W47A gene using the appropriate primer. The primers GGATATAATAATTTTTATGCG CCAGATAATGAGACG and CTACATAAATGAAAAGGCG TCACCATTAT TGTATC were used for the preparation of W178A and W280A, respectively. All primers were purified by high performance liquid chromatography before mutagenesis. WT and mutant secondary structure and thermal stability as monitored by the thermal denaturation transition (Tm) were measured by CD spectroscopy using an AVIV 202 spectrophotometer. Proteins were dialyzed in 10 mmborate buffer, pH 8.0. For Tm measurements, protein (0.03∼0.04 mg/ml) was incubated in a 1-cm cell, and the wavelength at 222 nm was monitored as the temperature was increased from 25 to 75 °C in 1o steps with an equilibration time of 1 or 2 min. For comparing secondary structure, wavelength scans (180–300 nm) were carried out at 25 °C with protein (0.2–0.3 mg/ml) in a 0.1-cm cell. Estimation of secondary structure content was done with CDNN using ellipticity in the 195- to 300-nm range (17Zhong L. Johnson W.C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2121-2128Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 18Bohm G. Muhr R. Jaenicke R. Prot. Eng. 1992; 5: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar, 19Andrade M.A. Chacon P. Merelo J.J. Moran F. Prot. Eng. 1993; 6: 383-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar). PI-PLC intrinsic fluorescence spectra were obtained with a Shimadzu RF5000U spectrofluorometer. All fluorescence measurements were carried out at 25 °C with ∼2 μm protein in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, with 1 mm EDTA. The excitation wavelength was 290 nm, with both excitation and emission slit widths set at 5 nm. The wavelength for the maximum in PI-PLC fluorescence was the same, 337 nm, for WT and all the tryptophan mutants. Changes in the fluorescence intensity were expressed as (I −I0)/I0, where I0 is the intensity of protein alone, and I is the intensity in the presence of an additive. PI-PLC activity was assayed by two methods. (i) For long-chain PI as substrate, 200-μl aliquots were removed from the reaction mixture at defined intervals and extracted with 300 μl of CHCl3 (this also stops the reaction). The content of cIP and I1P in the water-soluble phase was determined by 31P NMR (202.3 MHz) spectroscopy as described previously (8Zhou C., Wu, Y. Roberts M.F. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 347-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 13Zhou C. Roberts M.F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16430-16439Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) using a Varian INOVA spectrometer. (ii) For cIP, hydrolysis was monitored by 31P NMR spectroscopy by measuring the decrease of substrate and increase in product (I1P) resonance intensities as a function of incubation time with the enzyme. The amount of protein added was adjusted so that no more than 20% substrate hydrolysis occurred within 2 h. Assays to check for activation by PC typically used 5 mm cIP in the absence or presence of 5 mm diC7PC to probe for PC activation. SDS-PAGE (12% polyacrylamide) was used to quantify free PI-PLC separated (via centrifugation/filtration) from PI-PLC bound to POPC vesicles. A similar method was used to quantify S. chromofuscus phospholipase D partitioning to phospholipid vesicles (20Stieglitz K. Seaton B. Roberts M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35367-35374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). A stock of small unilamellar POPC vesicles (5 mm) with an average diameter ∼300 Å was prepared by sonication in 10 mmTris, pH 7.5. Large unilamellar vesicles were prepared by multiple passages of an aqueous POPC solution through polycarbonate membranes (100-nm pore diameter). Samples for binding assays with SUVs were prepared with 0.03 mg/ml protein in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5; the bulk POPC concentration was 0, 0.01, 0.02, 0.05, 0.1, and 0.2 mm for WT PI-PLC, W47I, W242I, W47F and 0, 0.02, 0.04, 0.08, 0.15, and 0.3 mm for W47A and W242A. In the POPC binding assay with W47A/W242A (and binding of PI-PLC to LUVs), the bulk POPC concentration was increased to 2 mm. After incubation for 15 min, the samples were applied to 2-ml Amicon Centricon YM10 filters (100-kDa molecular mass cutoff) and centrifuged at 4000 rpm in a DYNAC centrifuge for ∼2 h until all the solution passed through the filter. The protein bound to vesicles was left on the membrane of the filter, while free protein passed through the membrane. The eluant was collected and lyophilized overnight. As a control, enzyme in the absence of vesicles was centrifuged through the filter, and less than 5% of the total protein was lost on the filter. Samples for SDS-PAGE were made by adding 20 μl of water and 15 μl of SDS loading buffer to the dry solid. Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue. After destaining, the gels were imaged using EAGLE EYE from Stratagene, and the PI-PLC intensities were monitored. Comparison of band intensities to a sample incubated without POPC vesicles was used to measure the fraction of free enzyme (Ef/ET, where ET is the total amount of enzyme). The fraction of enzyme bound,Eb/ET, was then evaluated as (1 − Ef/ET). The apparent dissociation constant (KD) was calculated with equation Eb/ET = [POPC]/(KD + [POPC]). With this analysis, 1/KD is the molar partition coefficient for the protein interacting with POPC surfaces. The crystal structure of bacterial PI-PLC enzyme shows a single distorted (βα)6-barrel domain with the active site located at the C-terminal side (as determined by strand orientation) of the β-barrel (Fig. 1). Replacement of tryptophan residues at the mouth of the barrel is unlikely to have a dramatic effect on secondary structure as long as the mutant proteins fold correctly. To check this, CD spectra of WT and mutant PI-PLC proteins were acquired and used to check for overall structural elements. WT and mutant thermostabilities were also measured by monitoring the loss of secondary structure with temperature. As shown in Table I, estimates of WT secondary structure calculated from the CD wavelength spectra by CDNN (17Zhong L. Johnson W.C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2121-2128Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 18Bohm G. Muhr R. Jaenicke R. Prot.

Eng. 1993; 6: 383-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar) agreed moderately well with the secondary structure elements in the crystal structure (9Heinz D.W. Ryan M. Bullock T.L. Griffith O.H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3855-3863Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). All the tryptophan mutants except W178A had essentially the same proportion of secondary structure elements. They also had very similar thermal denaturation temperatures (Table I). Thus, any changes in PC binding and kinetics are unlikely to be due to protein that has a significantly altered structure from WT.Table IComparison of secondary structure content of WT and tryptophan mutant PI-PLC enzymesEnzymeSecondary Structure1-aEstimated using the program CDNN and data for the wavelength range 195–300 nm.Tm1-bThe Tm was extrapolated from the loss of negative ellipticity at 222 nm with temperature; Tm is the maximum in the derivative of the temperature dependence of this signal.

The error in each Tm is less than 0.4 °C. Open table in a new tab W178A was the least stable mutant (Tm decreased from 54 °C for the WT to 41.5 °C), and it also showed a significant drop in β-sheet and increase in random coil. The side chain of Trp-178, at the bottom of active site, is critical for hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions that stabilize the barrel and active site. Loss of these interactions would be expected to modify secondary structure, destabilize PI-PLC, and possibly reduce the mutant enzyme activity. The only other mutant with a significantly reduced stability was W280A. Trp-280 is positioned at a relatively unstructured region near the C terminus of the protein. Given its position, replacement of the aromatic side chain might not be expected to alter secondary structure elements as reflected in Table I. However, the stability of this mutant is decreased compared with WT, perhaps suggesting that packing of this tryptophan residue does contribute to stabilization of the structure. Replacement of either tryptophan at the barrel rim had minor effects on the protein stability. The Tm of W47A was within the error of the Tm for WT PI-PLC. A large change might not be expected, because Trp-47 is at the middle of helix B. However, the Tm of W242A was increased to 56.2 °C. Replacement of the bulky side chain of the tryptophan in the loop at the opening of the barrel slightly stabilized the protein. This might correlate with a small increase in α-helix (at the expense of random loop structure). It might also reflect a reduced hydrophobicity of the loop that affects its tertiary structure and dynamics; it is this change that leads to a small stabilization of the protein. PI-PLC has seven tryptophan residues that contribute to its fluorescence emission spectrum. Previous studies have shown that the binding of PC activator micelles (12Volwerk J.J. Filthuth E. Griffith O.H. Jain M.K. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3464-3474Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 21Zhou C. Qian X. Roberts M.F.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3464-3474Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) causes an increase in PI-PLC intrinsic fluorescence intensity, whereas molecules that bind to the active site (PA, PME, PG) cause a decrease in fluorescence (12Volwerk J.J. Filthuth E. Griffith O.H. Jain M.K. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3464-3474Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar,13Zhou C. Roberts M.F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16430-16439Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Mutants where a specific tryptophan has been replaced by alanine should lose some or all of this sensitivity if, indeed, that particular tryptophan were responsible for much of the spectral change upon interfacial binding. W47A, W242A, W178A, W280A, and W47A/W280A were examined as a function of added diC6PC and diC7PC and compared with WT PI-PLC. The emission maximum, 337 nm, was the same for all unliganded proteins and unshifted by the addition of PC micelles (up to 35 mm diC6PC or 4.0 mm diC7PC). As shown in Fig. 2A, the change in fluorescence intensity of WT at 337 nm showed a small increase below the diC6PC CMC (14 mm), then increased dramatically once micelles were formed and bound to the WT protein. Three of the tryptophan mutants, W47A, W178A, and W280A, exhibited similar behavior (Fig. 2). However, W242A showed significantly reduced sensitivity to diC6PC micelle binding. The fluorescence intensity still increased slightly with micelle formation but the enhancement of fluorescence was roughly one-third that of WT. The double mutant, missing the tryptophan in helix B and the 237–243 loop, showed no change in intrinsic fluorescence upon micelle binding (Fig. 2B). The effect of diC7PC micelles on PI-PLC intrinsic fluorescence was similar to that for diC6PC (increase in fluorescence around the diC7PC CMC of 1.5 mm) with the exception that now W47A as well as W242A also showed a significantly lower fractional increase in fluorescence (Fig. 3). However, the fractional increase in fluorescence upon micelle binding was still the least for W242A. Again, the double mutant displayed no sensitivity to PC micelle binding. Micellar diC6PA inhibits PI-PLC hydrolysis of cIP whereas monomeric diC6PA can partially activate the enzyme (13Zhou C. Roberts M.F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16430-16439Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Binding of monomeric diC6PA caused a decrease in WT PI-PLC fluorescence that correlates with binding of this molecule to the active site; as PA micelles formed, the intrinsic fluorescence increased. As shown in Fig. 4, low concentrations of diC6PA decreased PI-PLC fluorescence for all the PI-PLC mutants indicating active site binding of this molecule is not abolished by the tryptophan substitutions. The decrease in fluorescence was the least for W242A and the double mutant. Upon micelle formation of diC6PA (the CMC depends on the ionic strength and pH of the medium and is likely to be 5–7 mm under these buffer conditions (22Garigapatic V.R. Bian J. Roberts M.F. J. Coll. Int. Sci. 1995; 169: 486-492Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar)), all proteins except W242A and the double mutant showed large increases in fluorescence consistent with micelle binding as well as active site binding of the PA molecule. This could suggest that Trp-242 not only senses micelle binding but contributes to the decrease in fluorescence as lipids bind to the active site. myo-Inositol is a poor competitive inhibitor of PI-PLC (23Shashidhar M.S. Volwerk J.J. Keena J.F.W. Griffith O.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1042: 410-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Because it is not amphiphilic it has no tendency to form interfaces. Like other molecules that bind to the PI-PLC active site,myo-inositol caused a decrease in the fluorescence intensity of WT PI-PLC (Fig. 5). Tryptophan mutants that required more myo-inositol added to exhibit a decreased fluorescence also exhibited a reduced sensitivity to short-chain PC micelles. That the fractional decrease in fluorescence for W47A, W242A, and the double mutant was less than that observed with WT PI-PLC, might suggest that the interfacial site is coupled to substrate binding. Interestingly, the double mutant showed a more pronounced decrease in fluorescence with increasing myo-inositol than both W47A and W242A. If the decreased fluorescence is correlated with binding, this would indicate that removal of both tryptophan residues may actually enhance the binding of small water-soluble inositol compounds at the active site. However, the altered changes in fluorescence with myo-inositol could also reflect changes in the disposition of the fluorophores or removal of ones that are the major reporters of this small molecule binding to the active site. To investigate the role, if any, of the different tryptophans in the interfacial activation of PI-PLC, cIP hydrolysis (phosphodiesterase) and PI cleavage (phosphotransferase) were examined for WT and mutant proteins with and without PC activator (diC7PC). As summarized in Table II, removing either Trp-47 or Trp-242, which reside at the rim of the barrel, reduced the PI-PLC specific activity toward cIP to 60 and 82% of WT, respectively. Both single mutants exhibited kinetic activation by micellar diC7PC (5 mm), but not to the same extent as WT (Table II). That the reduction in the extent of PC activation is real was provided by measuring diC7PC activation of W280A, which was essentially the same as WT. Trp-280 is near the C-terminal end of the protein and far away from the active site and interfacial activation site (if it is near the mouth of the barrel). In the absence of an interface, the specific activity of the double mutant, where both Trp-47 and Trp-242 have been removed, toward cIP was 53% that of the WT. However, instead of the 6- to 9-fold increase observed with diC7PC added, this mutant showed only a 1.5-fold increase. The lack of kinetic activation of W47A/W242A by PC micelles suggests that the two tryptophan residues are key players in the interfacial binding site of the enzyme. Interaction of these bulky side chains with the phospholipid surface may be key to anchoring the protein to a surface. Furthermore, the lack of significant PC activation for W47A/W242A explains the lack of change in the intrinsic fluorescence when diC7PC was titrated into the double mutant. There was no fluorescence change, because the micelle binding site was perturbed.Table IISpecific activity (S.A.) of PI-PLC and mutants toward cIP (5 mm) and the effect of different activatorsEnzymeSpecific activityS.A.

Trp-178 is at the bottom of the active site where its side chain forms a hydrogen bond with the side chain of Asp-198, a residue shown to be critical for substrate binding. Replacement of Trp-178 with alanine would significantly alter the disposition of Asp-198, and this in turn could reduce the ability of the mutant to bind substrates. The specific activity of W178A toward cIP is 6% of WT; with PI solubilized in Triton X-100, the activity is 9.5% that of WT. A previous mutation of this residue to tyrosine showed a similarly reduced activity toward substrates. Although it is a less efficient enzyme, W178A can still be activated by diC7PC (Table II). The ratio of specific activity of W178A with and without activator is essentially the same as WT PI-PLC for both cIP hydrolysis and PI cleavage. Thus, of the four tryptophans examined, only Trp-47 and Trp-242 appear to have roles in activator binding. Although myo-inositol is a poor competitive inhibitor of PI-PLC, the effectiveness of it as an inhibitor can be used to monitor how mutants bind this portion of the substrate.

Tapia-Conyer R. Contrib. Microbiol. 1999; 3: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Indeed, the characteristics of all members of this viral subfamily are their ability to establish latency in sensory ganglia after primary infection and to reactivate decades later. Molecular events leading to the establishment and maintenance of the virus latency, as well as to its reactivation, are still poorly understood. It appears to be the result of a delicate balance between cellular factors, viral proteins and the host immune system (2Lungu O. Annunziato P.W. Contrib. Microbiol. 1999; 3: 61-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In lytically infected cells, the expression of VZV genes seems to occur in cascade-like events, previously described for herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) (3Honess R.W. Roizman B. J. Virol. 1974; 14: 8-19Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Immediate early (IE) gene-encoded proteins are the first ones to be active because they act as regulators on their own expression, as well as on the transcriptional activation of early (E) and late (L) genes. Among the immediate early proteins, IE62 seems to be the major regulating factor with regard to its transactivation properties on all classes of viral genes (4Inchaupse G. Nagpal S. Ostrove J.M.

Moreover, several of the corresponding proteins have been detected in latently infected cells (16Mahalingam R. Wellish M. Cohrs R. Debrus S. Piette J. Rentier B. Gilden D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2122-2124Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 17Lungu O. Panagiotidis C.A. Annunziato P.W. Gershon A.A. Silverstein S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

During latency, the expression of viral proteins also present during the lytic phase of infection is an original feature that VZV does not share with HSV-1. IE63 was the first protein described in a latency context, first in an animal model (19Spengler M. Niesen N. Grose C. Ruyechan W.T. Hay J. Arch. Virol. 2001; 17 (suppl.): 71-79Google Scholar) and second in human tissue sections (16Mahalingam R. Wellish M. Cohrs R. Debrus S. Piette J. Rentier B. Gilden D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2122-2124Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 17Lungu O. Panagiotidis C.A. Annunziato P.W. Gershon A.A. Silverstein S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This 45-kDa phosphoprotein, encoded by two identical ORFs (ORF63 and ORF70), is present in the virion tegument (19Spengler M. Niesen N. Grose C. Ruyechan W.T. Hay J. Arch. Virol. 2001; 17 (suppl.): 71-79Google Scholar). IE63 is abundantly produced during the early phase of infection (20Debrus S. Sadzot-Delvaux C. Nikkels A.F. Piette J. Rentier B. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3240-3245Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and is essential for VZV replication (21Sommer M.H. Zagha E. Serrano O.K. Ku C.C. Zerboni L. Baiker A. Santos R. Spengler M. Lynch J. Grose C. Ruyechan W. Hay J. Arvin A.M. J. Virol. 2001; 17: 8224-8239Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Its activity as a potential transcription factor remains unclear. IE63 has been shown to exert positive or negative effects on gene transcription, depending on the type of promoter studied (22Jackers P. Defechereux P. Baudoux L. Lambert C. Massaer M. Merville-Louis M.P. Rentier B. Piette J. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 3899-3903Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, others claimed that IE63 played only a minor role in the control of VZV gene expression (23Kost R.G. Kupinsky H. Straus S.E. Virology. 1995; 209: 218-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). An interesting feature of the VZV IE63 protein is its cellular localization during the different stages of the viral cycle. Indeed, in the early phase of infection, IE63 is predominantly present in the nucleus of infected cells (20Debrus S. Sadzot-Delvaux C. Nikkels A.F. Piette J. Rentier B. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3240-3245Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, IE63 exhibits an exclusive cytoplasmic localization during latency and can be found both in the nucleus and the cytoplasm when reactivation occurs (17Lungu O. Panagiotidis C.A. Annunziato P.W. Gershon A.A. Silverstein S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7080-7085Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The presence of IE63 and its localization modification might reflect an important role in the latency process. Phosphorylation and dephosphorylation events are known to be usually involved in regulation mechanisms such as nuclear and cytoplasmic translocation, for example.In vitro phosphorylation of IE63 may be achieved using recombinant casein kinase II (CKII), and the protein is also phosphorylated in VZV-transfected Mewo cells (24Stevenson D. Xue M. Hay J. Ruyechan W.T. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 658-662Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The phosphorylation sites used in these in vivo and in vitro assays are located predominantly at the carboxyl-terminal region of the protein. Recently, it has also been shown that IE63 is a substrate for ORF47, one of the VZV-encoded kinases (25Kenyon T.K. Lynch J. Hay J. Ruyechan W. Grose C. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 8854-8858Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Indeed, using stringent in vitro conditions, an extensive phosphorylation of the protein is catalyzed by the ORF47-encoded kinase, which can compete with CKII for the binding to IE63. This viral serine/threonine kinase has often been compared with CKII, notably because they may both use ATP or GTP as phosphate donor (26Ng T.I. Grose C. Virology. 1992; 191: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). These results demonstrate that viral and cellular kinases are capable of phosphorylating IE63.The purpose of this paper was to analyze in further detail the IE63 phosphorylation status. For this, we used a mutational approach to investigate the importance of some of the putative phosphorylation sites on the cellular localization of IE63 and on its activity. Ten potential phosphorylation sites for casein kinase I (CKI), CKII, and protein kinase C (PKC) or Cdc2 were mutated, and in vitro kinase assays were carried out using these mutated proteins as substrates. Results indicated that these sites are important in the phosphorylation process of IE63, using either recombinant CKI and CKII or protein extracts from Vero (non-neuronal) or ND7 (neuronal) cells. Immunofluorescent studies on these neuronal and non-neuronal cell lines transfected with the mutated IE63 proteins indicated that phosphorylation on these residues is required for a suitable cellular localization of the protein in Vero but not in ND7 cells. We also demonstrated that wild-type IE63 protein possesses some repressive properties on two VZV promoters (DNA polymerase and thymidine kinase) and that mutation of the phosphorylation sites strongly impaired its activity. Finally, we also witnessed evidence of an important feature of this protein: IE63 is able to exert its repressive activity both in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm of transfected cells, suggesting that IE63 acts through a transcriptional or post-transcriptional mechanism in the nucleus and/or through a post-transcriptional mechanism in the cytoplasm of transfected cells.DISCUSSIONThe viral tegument is an amorphous structure located between the capsid and the external envelope of herpesviruses. Four different proteins, ORF10, IE4, IE62 and IE63, have been identified within the VZV tegument (35Rahaus M. Schünemann S. Wolff M.H. Contrib. Microbiol. 1999; 3: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). They have all been described previously as regulatory proteins; ORF10, the homologue of HSV-1 VP16 protein, is able to transactivate the VZV IE62 promoter (36Moriuchi H. Moriuchi M. Straus S.E. Cohen J.I. J. Virol. 1992; 67: 2739-2746Crossref Google Scholar), whereas IE4 and IE62 are phosphoproteins known for their ability to stimulate the expression of all three classes of VZV genes (IE, E, and L) (4Inchaupse G. Nagpal S. Ostrove J.M. Virology. 1989; 173: 700-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 5Perera L.P. Mosca J.D. Sadeghi-Zadeh M. Ruyechan W.T. Hay J.

Piette J. J. Virol. 1993; 7: 4379-4385Crossref Google Scholar). The activity of IE63 is not so well defined. This tegument protein possesses regulatory properties on the viral gene expression as shown previously (22Jackers P. Defechereux P. Baudoux L. Lambert C. Massaer M. Merville-Louis M.P. Rentier B. Piette J. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 3899-3903Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but these results were disputed (23Kost R.G. Kupinsky H. Straus S.E. Virology. 1995; 209: 218-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar).The first part of this report was devoted to the analysis of the important phosphorylation sites of IE63. We showed that cellular kinases from both Vero and ND7 cells were able to phosphorylate this protein and that the phosphorylation rate of IE63 was higher in the permissive and non-neuronal cell line (Vero), compared with the neuronal but not permissive ND7 cells. Immunoprecipitation experiments and the use of a CKI and CKII inhibitor (DRB) in an in vitro kinase assay allowed us to conclude that those cellular kinases were implicated in IE63 phosphorylation. CKI and CKII are ubiquitous proteins involved in many cellular events; CKII is known to be implicated in various biological processes such as signal transduction, cell cycle, apoptosis, and cell transformation, and it can phosphorylate more than 160 proteins including many viral proteins (37Guerra B. Issinger O.-G. Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 391-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). CKI was also described as a pleiotropic kinase with a large number of substrates (38Gross S.D. Anderson R.A. Cell. Signal. 1998; 10: 699-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of IE63 in Mewo cells, or using recombinant CKII, was described previously (24Stevenson D. Xue M. Hay J. Ruyechan W.T. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 658-662Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and potential phosphorylation sites were predicted in the carboxyl-terminal region of the protein (between residues 142 and 278). A site-directed mutagenesis strategy allowed us to show that phosphorylation of IE63 was not restricted to the five serine or threonine residues targeted by CKII in this region (Ser-150, Ser-165, Thr-171, Ser-181, and Ser-186). Indeed, the IE63-5M protein, where all these potential CKII sites are mutated into alanine residues, may still be phosphorylated using recombinant CKII. These results suggest that CKII might also use target sites located elsewhere in the protein. Analysis of the amino acid sequence of the protein revealed the presence of two other putative phosphorylation sites for CKII in the amino-terminal (Thr-8) and in the central (Thr-124) parts of the protein. Using two other prediction programs (NetPhos 2.0 (39Blom N. Gammeltoft S. Brunak S. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 1351-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (2475) Google Scholar) and Scansite (40Yaffe M.B. Leparc G.G. Lai J. Obata T. Volinia S. Cantley L.C. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 348-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar)) Ser-197 can also be identified as a residue with a high probability of being phosphorylated. According to the scansite program Ser-197 might be a potential target for CKII. The relevance and the implication of these sites in the phosphorylation of IE63 remain to be elucidated. We also observed a slightly higher CKI phosphorylation rate of IE63-5M in comparison with the wild-type protein. We suspect that mutations introduced in this mutant might modify the accessibility and/or the affinity of CKI for its target sites.Four potential sites for CKI (Ser-173, Ser-185, Thr-201, and Thr-244) and 1 site for PKC/Cdc2 (Ser-224) are present in the carboxyl-terminal region of IE63. The impact of their mutation, in combination with those for CKII, was investigated (IE63-10M). These results indicated that CKI was implicated in the phosphorylation process of IE63. Indeed, we showed that wild-type IE63 may be phosphorylated in vitro using recombinant CKI and that the mutation of the four phosphorylation sites largely abrogated its phosphorylation by CKI. Netphos and Scansite analyses also revealed the presence of two other sites of high probability for being phosphorylated by CKI, Ser-15 and Ser-203. These residues might be responsible for the slight phosphorylation remaining in the IE63-10M mutated protein. Interestingly, we also noticed a lower CKII phosphorylation rate of the IE63-10M protein in comparison to what was observed with the IE63-5M. We postulate that the last mutations introduced in the IE63-10M protein (and especially the mutation of the residue 201) could have modified Ser-197 accessibility to CKII.Kinase assays performed using cellular protein extracts and measure of the casein kinase activity revealed an important decrease (60–70% using Vero and ND7 protein extracts, respectively) of the phosphorylation rate of IE63-10M in comparison with the wild-type protein. This observation has been made regardless of the nature of the cell type, even if the phosphorylation rate of IE63 was more important using protein extracts from Vero than from ND7 cells. These results obtained with the neuronal and non-neuronal cellular models suggested that members of the casein kinase family are implicated in the phosphorylation of IE63.Phosphorylation and dephosphorylation events are implicated in many cellular regulatory activities such as cell cycle, signal transduction, or gene expression (41Karin M. Hunter T. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 747-757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar, 42Calkhoven F. AB G. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 329-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 43Nigg E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 21-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (1238) Google Scholar). Many transcription factors are common targets for cellular kinases and are regulated by phosphorylation mechanisms (41Karin M. Hunter T. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 747-757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar, 42Calkhoven F. AB G. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 329-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Indeed, one of the strategies developed by cells to regulate the expression of cellular genes is the control of transcription factors localization and their shuttling through the nucleus. For example, phosphorylation of IE62 by the viral ORF66 kinase led to its delocalization from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, impairing its transactivation properties (44Kinchington P.R. Fite K. Seman A. Turse S.E. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 9106-9113Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In this context, we investigate the impact of phosphorylation event on the cellular localization of IE63. The use of two different cell lines allowed us to compare the behavior of IE63 in a non-neuronal cell line permissive to VZV (Vero) and in neuronal ND7 cells, previously shown to be of low permissivity to HSV-1 infection (26Ng T.I. Grose C. Virology. 1992; 191: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). We demonstrated here that VZV does not replicate in this cell type. The wild-type IE63 protein exhibits a major nuclear localization in Vero- and ND7-transfected cells, as observed previously (20Debrus S. Sadzot-Delvaux C. Nikkels A.F. Piette J. Rentier B. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3240-3245Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in infection studies. The removal of the four amino acids located between residues 260 and 264 (KRRR) led to a predominant cytoplasmic localization of the protein in both cell lines, suggesting that this short basic sequence acts as an effective, but not exclusive, nuclear localization signal for IE63. The removal of a large part of the carboxyl-terminal region of the protein (IE63-ΔK) induced a cytoplasmic delocalization of the protein when transfected in Vero and in ND7 cells, confirming the observations of others in Mewo cells (24Stevenson D. Xue M. Hay J. Ruyechan W.T. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 658-662Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mutation of the five potential phosphorylation sites for CKII located in the carboxyl-terminal region of IE63 led to a slight delocalization of the protein from the nucleus to the cytoplasm of Vero cells. Experiments carried out with mutants IE63-1M, IE63-2M, IE63-3M, and IE63-4M, where only some of the CKII phosphorylation sites were mutated, did not shed light on determining the CKII site responsible for this slight delocalization. Furthermore, the mutation of all CKI, CKII, and PKC/Cdc2 phosphorylation sites located in this area (IE63-10M) considerably alters the localization of IE63 in Vero cells, as more than 65% of them exhibited a major cytoplasmic staining. In this case, we also observed a striking localization of the protein at the nuclear membrane, suggesting that the absence of phosphorylation impaired its transport into the nucleus. Results obtained with several intermediate constructs, such as IE63-6M, IE63-7M, IE63-8M, and IE63-9M, did not allow us to identify a key site in the process (data not shown). Our observations suggest that the correct import of IE63 into the nucleus requires a complete phosphorylation of the carboxyl-terminal region of the protein, rather than the phosphorylation of one or two particular sites. However, it should be pointed out that Ser-224 could also be considered as a potential target site for p34cdc2, a member of the cyclin-dependent serine/threonine kinase family involved in the G2/M transition of the cell cycle (45King R.W. Jackson P.K. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1994; 79: 563-571Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). It has been shown previously that, during HSV-1 infection, this cellular kinase is required for the expression of a subset of late viral proteins and that its own expression is induced by UL13 and ICP22, the latter being the HSV-1 homologue of IE63 (46Advani S.J. Weichselbaum R.R. Roizman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10996-11001Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Furthermore, several reports (46Advani S.J. Weichselbaum R.R. Roizman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10996-11001Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 47El-Hodiri H.M. Che S. Nelman-Gonzales M. Kuang J. Etkin L.D. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 1994; 352: 236-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) also indicated that Cdc2 could modulate the cellular localization and the function of several transcription factors. In this context, it would be interesting to define the potential role that this kinase could play on the localization and/or activity of IE63. An interesting observation was also made when the cellular localization of IE63 mutated in some of its phosphorylation sites was investigated in ND7 cells. Indeed, in this neuronal cell line, no impact of the mutations of the phosphorylation sites was observed; the IE63-5M and IE63-10M proteins exhibited a nuclear localization like the wild-type protein, and after deletion of its NLS, the protein remains in the cytoplasm of transfected cells. These results indicate that in permissive cells (Vero), phosphorylation of the IE63 protein is important for its accurate localization, whereas in cells that do not support VZV infection (ND7), the phosphorylation rate of IE63 does not seem to be a critical factor for its subcellular localization. This suggests that, depending on the cell type, IE63 might use different transport mechanisms that could be more or less sensitive to its phosphorylation status. Numerous reports indicate that phosphorylation-dependent mechanisms may regulate the subcellular localization of proteins such as those containing a CcN motif, a short region containing phosphorylation sites for CKII and Cdc2 in the vicinity of a nuclear localization signal (50Hicks G.R. Raikhel N.V. Annu. Rev. Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 155-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 51Briggs L.J. Johnstone R.W. Elliot R.M. Xiao C.-Y. Dawson M. Trapani J.A. Jans D.A. Biochem.

Rev. 1996; 76: 651-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar).To understand the relevance of the phosphorylation-dependent localization of IE63, we developed an activity assay with the wild-type protein and then examined the behavior of the mutated proteins in this context. Because the trans-repressive properties of IE63 on IE promoters have been questioned (23Kost R.G. Kupinsky H. Straus S.E. Virology. 1995; 209: 218-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), we investigated the activity of IE63 on the regulation of the gene encoding the DNA polymerase, a putative early protein (ORF28). Results indicated that the wild-type IE63 protein was able, in a dose-dependent way, to down-regulate the expression of the luciferase reporter gene driven by this promoter (pPol) in both cell lines tested. This repressive activity was clearly observed either in the basal activity of the pPol or after its stimulation by IE62. This down-regulating property might reflect an important role played by IE63 in the infectious cycle. An important feature of IE63 was observed when experiments were carried out with the 63ΔNLS protein. Indeed, despite its cytoplasmic localization, this protein was still capable of repressing the basal expression of the pPol. This property was established in neuronal and in non-neuronal cells with an efficiency similar to the wild-type protein. IE63 thus acts as a repressor either in the nucleus or in the cytoplasm of transfected cells, and this viral protein could exert its activity by two independent ways, through transcriptional and/or post-transcriptional mechanisms. Experiments carried out with the IE63-10M protein indicated that the phosphorylation status of IE63 is important for its activity. Indeed, in neuronal cells we observed a complete loss of the pPol repression when phosphorylation sites of the protein were mutated. These observations were made when pPol was stimulated by IE62 and on its basal activity. In Vero cells, the repression property of IE63 on the basal expression of the promoter was also slightly reduced. Hence, the phosphorylation status of IE63, rather than its cellular localization, is critical for the fulfillment of its repressive activity, and casein kinases are involved in the regulatory process. Several reports (37Guerra B. Issinger O.-G. Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 391-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar,55Sakanaka C. Sun T.Q. Williams L.T. Recent Prog. Horm.

(New York). 2000; 60: 211-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) indicate that members of the CK family possess regulatory properties and are involved in the control of cellular or viral gene expression.Taken together, these results indicate that in the models studied, cellular CKI and CKII are important for the correct nuclear localization of IE63 and for its repressive properties in a cell type-dependent way. Furthermore, we showed that IE63 exerts its repressive properties in the nucleus as well as in the cytoplasm of transfected cell, suggesting its implication in transcriptional and/or post-transcriptional mechanism(s). In order to determine the biological relevance of our observations and to evaluate them in an infectious context, we intend to develop a VZV recombinant virus carrying mutations in the phosphorylation sites of IE63 genes. The replication of this recombinant virus will be tested in cultured cells, and its infectivity and its ability to establish latency in dorsal root gang"

Although cyclin-dependent kinases are established substrates, Cdc25A may also affect other proteins. We have shown here that Cdc25A interacts with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) both physically and functionally in Hep3B human hepatoma cells. Cdc25A inhibitor Cpd 5, a vitamin K analog, inhibited Cdc25A activity in the Cdc25A-EGFR immunocomplex and consequently caused prolonged EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation. Both purified GST-Cdc25A protein and endogenous Hep3B cellular Cdc25A dephosphorylated tyrosine-phosphorylated EGFR, and Cpd 5 antagonized the phosphatase activity of Cdc25A. A functional Cdc25A-EGFR interaction was seen in NR-6 fibroblasts expressing ectopic EGFR but not with a receptor lacking the C terminus or a mutated kinase domain. These data link the cell cycle control Cdc25A phosphatase to an EGFR-linked mitogenic signaling pathway specifically involving EGFR dephosphorylation.

Phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of proteins provide a well studied regulatory mechanism for eliciting major changes in cell growth and differentiation.

Tyrosine-phosphorylated growth factor receptors are rapidly inactivated by dephosphorylation, a process that is believed to negatively modulate signaling activity (2Lammers R. Bossenmaier B. Cool DE.

The identity of many of the protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPases) involved in receptor dephosphorylation is unknown. PTPases constitute a diverse family of enzymes that can be divided into several subgroups, including receptor PTPases and non-receptor PTPases (4Fischer E.H. Charbonneau H. Tonks N.K. Science. 1991; 253: 401-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar, 5Tonks N.K. Neel B.G. Cell. 1996; 87: 365-368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). All PTPases contain an essential cysteine residue in the enzyme active site, and this essential cysteine is the target for specific modification by various sulfhydryl-alkylating reagents (6Lohse D.L.

Recently, a synthetic vitamin K analog, 2-(2-mercaptoethanol)-3-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone or Compound 5 (Cpd 5), has been found to be a potent growth inhibitor for both normal rat hepatocytes and hepatoma cells. This growth inhibition is associated with enhanced and prolonged EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation (8Wang Z. Wang M. Carr B.I. J. Cell.

Thus, PTPases are a likely group of target proteins for Cpd 5. The inactivation of PTPases by Cpd 5 may cause an imbalance of EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation and dephosphorylation and thus perturb the regulation of cell growth and other cellular functions.Cdc25 phosphatases are a PTPase subfamily; they contain a catalytic cysteine residue and are essential regulators of cell cycle transitions. In mammalian cells, three Cdc25-related proteins have been identified (11Sadhu K. Reed S.I. Richardson H. Russell P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Among them, Cdc25B and Cdc25C appear to regulate progression from G2 to M phase while Cdc25A is required for S phase entry, and its overexpression leads to an acceleration in S phase entry (13Millar J.B.A. Blevitt J.

Although Cdc25A clearly can dephosphorylate the cyclin-dependent kinases including Cdk2/cyclin A(E) and Cdk4 (Cdk6)/cyclin D, the identities of other potential substrates remain unclear (18Gu Y.

Recent work indicates that Cdc25A can act on substrates other than Cdks because it dephosphorylates the homeodomain transcription factor cut, leading to a decrease in p21 promoter activity (25Coqueret O. Berube G. Nepveu A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4680-4694Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Cdc25A was found to interact with and dephosphorylate the proto-oncogene Raf-1 on tyrosine residues, resulting in a significant decrease in Raf-1 kinase activity (26Galaktionov K. Jessus C. Beach D. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1046-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 27Xia K. Lee R.S. Narsimhan R.P. Mukhopadhyay N.K. Neel B.G. Roberts T.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4819-4824Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). That Cdc25A is not highly promiscuous was suggested by the work of Zou et al. (28Zou X. Tsutsui T. Ray D. Blomquist J.F. Ichijo H. Ucker D.S. Kiyokawa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4818-4828Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), which used a yeast two-hybrid system to screen >106 clones and found Cdc25A bound only to 14-3-3ζ, apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1, and three other as yet unidentified proteins.We have previously shown that Cpd 5 causes persistent EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation, which is related to inhibition of EGFR tyrosine phosphatases. However, the target PTPases are still not identified. We examined SH-PTP1 and SH-PTP2, two prototype PTPases for EGFR dephosphorylation, and found that their activity was not inhibited by Cpd 5 (Ref. 8Wang Z. Wang M. Carr B.I. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 183: 338-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). 2Z. Wang and B. I. Carr, unpublished data.2Z. Wang and B. I. Carr, unpublished data. There is growing evidence that the Cdc25A dual-specificity phosphatase plays an important role in regulating signal transduction pathways and cell growth, and some recent reports show that vitamin K3 and Cpd 5 inhibit cellular Cdc25 activity (29Wu FY-H. Sun T-P. Eur. J. Cancer. 1999; 35: 1388-1393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 30Rice R. Rusnak J.M. Yokokawa F. Yokokawa S. Messner D.J. Boynton A.L. Wipf P.

Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1317-1325PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we considered that Cpd 5 would be a useful tool to study EGFR and Cdc25A interactions. Here we provide evidence that Cdc25A physically and functionally interacted with EGFR and dephosphorylated EGFR that had been tyrosine-phosphorylated in vitro and in culture. Furthermore, in EGFR kinase-mutated and its C-terminal-deleted NR-6 fibroblast cells, no Cdc25A-EGFR functional interaction was found. The inhibition of Cdc25A activity by Cpd 5 caused EGFR hyperphosphorylation. These data identify EGFR as a substrate for Cdc25A phosphatase.DISCUSSIONThe activated and autophosphorylated growth factor receptors are subject to a rapid dephosphorylation by PTPases (36Swarup G. Cohen S. Garbers D.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 107: 1104-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar, 37Bohmer F.D. Bohmer S.A. Heldin C.H. FEBS Lett. 1993; 331: 276-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Receptor dephosphorylation is believed to represent a major mechanism of negative regulation of receptor function, and the identification of the involved PTPases is therefore important for understanding receptor signaling. We have previously shown that a PTPase inhibitor, Cpd 5, can strongly activate EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation, which is perhaps paradoxically related to cell growth inhibition (8Wang Z. Wang M. Carr B.I. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 183: 338-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). We excluded two prototype EGFR phosphatases, SH-PTP1 and SH-PTP2, as candidate targets for Cpd 5, because SH-PTP1 was not expressed in Hep3B cells and SH-PTP2 did not dephosphorylate EGFR (data not shown). Because our previous studies have shown that Cdc25A activity was inhibited by Cpd 5 in vitro and in cell cultures (31Tamura K. Southwick E.C. Kerns J. Rosi K.S. Carr B.I. Wilcox C.S. Lazo J.S. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1317-1325PubMed Google Scholar, 35Wang Z. Southwick E.C. Wang M. Kar S. Rosi K.S. Wilcox C.S. Lazo J.S. Carr B.I. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 7211-7216PubMed Google Scholar), we examined the relationship between EGFR and Cdc25A. Cdc25A belongs to the Cdc25 phosphatase family in human cells and is well known as a G1/S and G2/M phase cell cycle regulator that catalyzes dephosphorylation and activation of cyclin-Cdk through removal of the inhibitory phosphates (17Molinari M. Mercurio C. Dominguez J. Goubin F. Draetta G.F. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 71-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 22Jinno S. Suto A. Nagata A. Igarashi M. Kanaoka Y. Nojima H. Okayama H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1549-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). However, the nature of its substrates remains unclear. Besides the likely substrates of cyclin-Cdk, it has been reported recently that Cdc25A binds to and dephosphorylates the homeodomain transcription factor cut (25Coqueret O. Berube G. Nepveu A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4680-4694Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) and phosphoprotein Raf-1 (26Galaktionov K. Jessus C. Beach D. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1046-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 27Xia K. Lee R.S. Narsimhan R.P. Mukhopadhyay N.K. Neel B.G. Roberts T.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4819-4824Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We have reported here for the first time that EGFR is likely to be a substrate of Cdc25A. This conclusion is based on the following findings. First, Cdc25A co-immunoprecipitated with EGFR in Cpd 5-treated Hep3B cells, and GST-Cdc25A directly bound to purified EGFR protein in vitro. Second, Cpd 5, a known inhibitor of Cdc25A phosphatase activity, induced a prolonged EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation. By contrast, in Hep3B cells expressing an inactivated Cdc25A, no EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation was found after the treatment with Cpd 5. This result is consistent with the report that the inactive mutant Cdc25A-C430S protein strongly interacts with both cyclin A-Cdk2 and cyclin E-Cdk2 but does not lead to an activation of Cdk2 kinase activity (38Xu X. Burke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5118-5124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Third, both purified GST-Cdc25A and endogenous Hep3B cellular Cdc25A dephosphorylated EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation in vitro and in cell culture; their dephosphorylation activity can be inhibited by Cpd 5, demonstrating that EGFR is a direct target of Cdc25A. Finally, in EGFR-transfected fibroblast NR-6 cells, Cdc25A was found to bind to wild-type and kinase-mutated EGFR but not to C-terminal-deleted EGFR. Furthermore, only wild-type EGFR was able to be tyrosine-phosphorylated with Cpd 5 treatment. These results suggest that Cdc25A binds to the C-terminal of EGFR and that EGFR kinase activity may be important to the action of Cdc25A on EGFR dephosphorylationIt seems that EGFR dephosphorylation by Cdc25A is selective, because Cdc25A has no effect on insulin receptor tyrosine dephosphorylation. This selectivity is probably because of the structural differences between EGFR and insulin receptor. Most RTKs, such as EGFR and platelet-derived growth factor receptor, are monomers in the cell membrane. Ligand binding induces dimerization of these receptors (1Schlessinger J. Cell. 2000; 103: 211-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3484) Google Scholar). However, members of the insulin receptor family are disulfide-linked dimers of two polypeptide chains forming an α2β2 heterodimer (39Van Obberghen E. Diabetologia. 1994; 27: S125-S134Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Insulin binding to the extracellular domain of the insulin receptor induces a rearrangement in the quaternary heterotetrameric structure that leads to increased autophosphorylation of the cytoplasmic domain (40Hubbard S.R. Mohhammadi M. Schlessinger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11987-11990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). This structure may not be suitable for Cdc25A binding. The fact that the Cdc25A inhibitor Cpd 5 cannot induce insulin receptor tyrosine phosphorylation further supports our hypothesis. In the Cdc25 family, only Cdc25A showed marked tyrosine phosphatase activity directed against EGFR. Our results are consistent with those previous findings that Cdc25A is a more potent tyrosine phosphatase than Cdc25B or Cdc25C when Raf-1 and Cdk are used as the substrates (26Galaktionov K. Jessus C. Beach D. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1046-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 35Wang Z. Southwick E.C. Wang M. Kar S. Rosi K.S. Wilcox C.S. Lazo J.S. Carr B.I.

The mechanisms for this discrepancy have not yet been elucidated. One possibility is that the Cdc25 phosphatase activity is regulated by extensive phosphorylation of the N-terminal regulatory domain, since the alignment of all known dual-specific protein-tyrosine phosphatases shows that they are very different from each other in terms of length and amino acid sequence outside the putative catalytic domain (38Xu X. Burke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5118-5124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar,41Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Cell. 1992; 70: 139-151Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar).The Cdc25 protein phosphatase family has long been regarded as only a cell cycle regulator. However, recent studies have shown that Cdc25A may also play a central role in regulating mitogenic signal transduction pathways. For instance, it has been reported that Cdc25A can physically associate with Raf-1 and regulates Raf-1 tyrosine phosphorylation and its activity (26Galaktionov K. Jessus C. Beach D. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1046-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 27Xia K. Lee R.S. Narsimhan R.P. Mukhopadhyay N.K. Neel B.G. Roberts T.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4819-4824Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The fact that Raf-1 kinase can form complexes with the cell cycle activator Cdc25A provides strong evidence that signal transduction pathways are linked with the cell cycle directly. In HeLa cells, overexpression of Cdc25A in whole cells induced ERK dephosphorylation, and the Cdc25A inhibitor Cpd 5 restored ERK phosphorylation and nuclear translocation, demonstrating that Cdc25A regulated endogenous ERK phosphorylation status in whole cells (34Vogt A. Adachi T. Ducruet A.P. Chesebrough J. Nemoto K. Carr B.I. Lazo J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20544-20550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). We also found that Cpd 5-inhibited Cdc25A activity could contribute to Cdk4 tyrosine phosphorylation and subsequent cell cycle block and cell growth inhibition (35Wang Z. Southwick E.C. Wang M. Kar S. Rosi K.S. Wilcox C.S. Lazo J.S. Carr B.I. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 7211-7216PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we again used Cpd 5 as a tool to reveal that Cdc25A was an EGFR phosphatase and that inhibition of Cdc25A activity by Cpd 5 caused prolonged EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation. These data suggest that Cdc25A acts as the phosphatase for several different substrates in the MAPK pathway and that Cpd 5-induced activation of the MAPK pathway can be triggered by either upstream activation of EGFR or Raf-1 or by direct inhibition of ERK phosphatase Cdc25A. Taken together, our data establish Cdc25A protein phosphatase as a key molecule in regulating and linking cell cycle progression and signal transduction pathway. Inhibition of Cdc25A activity by Cpd 5 not only overstimulates the MAPK pathway from membrane receptor to nuclear, which down-regulates gene transcription, but also directly inhibits cell cycle progression, eventually leading to growth inhibition and cell death. Thus, finding an efficient Cdc25A inhibitor may be of significant importance in controlling cancer cell growth and proliferation. Phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of proteins provide a well studied regulatory mechanism for eliciting major changes in cell growth and differentiation. Among the proteins involved are cell surface receptors that are endowed with intrinsic protein-tyrosine kinase activity. These receptor-tyrosine kinases (RTKs) 1The abbreviations used are: RTK(s)receptor-tyrosine kinase(s)PTPase(s)protein-tyrosine phosphatase(s)EGFepidermal growth factorEGFREGF receptorMAPKmitogen-activated protein kinaseGSTglutathione S- transferaseERKextracellular signal-related kinase1The abbreviations used are: RTK(s)receptor-tyrosine kinase(s)PTPase(s)protein-tyrosine phosphatase(s)EGFepidermal growth factorEGFREGF receptorMAPKmitogen-activated protein kinaseGSTglutathione S- transferaseERKextracellular signal-related kinase play an important role in the control of many fundamental cellular processes including cell cycle control, survival, metabolism, and differentiation (1Schlessinger J.

Tyrosine-phosphorylated growth factor receptors are rapidly inactivated by dephosphorylation, a process that is believed to negatively modulate signaling activity (2Lammers R. Bossenmaier B. Cool DE.

Lazo J.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15965-15974Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 31Tamura K. Southwick E.C. Kerns J. Rosi K.S. Carr B.I. Wilcox C.S. Lazo J.S. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1317-1325PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we considered that Cpd 5 would be a useful tool to study EGFR and Cdc25A interactions. Here we provide evidence that Cdc25A physically and functionally interacted with EGFR and dephosphorylated EGFR that had been tyrosine-phosphorylated in vitro and in culture. Furthermore, in EGFR kinase-mutated and its C-terminal-deleted NR-6 fibroblast cells, no Cdc25A-EGFR functional interaction was found. The inhibition of Cdc25A activity by Cpd 5 caused EGFR hyperphosphorylation. These data identify EGFR as a substrate for Cdc25A phosphatase. DISCUSSIONThe activated and autophosphorylated growth factor receptors are subject to a rapid dephosphorylation by PTPases (36Swarup G. Cohen S. Garbers D.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 107: 1104-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar, 37Bohmer F.D. Bohmer S.A. Heldin C.H. FEBS Lett. 1993; 331: 276-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Receptor dephosphorylation is believed to represent a major mechanism of negative regulation of receptor function, and the identification of the involved PTPases is therefore important for understanding receptor signaling. We have previously shown that a PTPase inhibitor, Cpd 5, can strongly activate EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation, which is perhaps paradoxically related to cell growth inhibition (8Wang Z. Wang M. Carr B.I. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 183: 338-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). We excluded two prototype EGFR phosphatases, SH-PTP1 and SH-PTP2, as candidate targets for Cpd 5, because SH-PTP1 was not expressed in Hep3B cells and SH-PTP2 did not dephosphorylate EGFR (data not shown). Because our previous studies have shown that Cdc25A activity was inhibited by Cpd 5 in vitro and in cell cultures (31Tamura K. Southwick E.C. Kerns J. Rosi K.S. Carr B.I. Wilcox C.S. Lazo J.S. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1317-1325PubMed Google Scholar, 35Wang Z. Southwick E.C. Wang M. Kar S. Rosi K.S. Wilcox C.S. Lazo J.S. Carr B.I. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 7211-7216PubMed Google Scholar), we examined the relationship between EGFR and Cdc25A. Cdc25A belongs to the Cdc25 phosphatase family in human cells and is well known as a G1/S and G2/M phase cell cycle regulator that catalyzes dephosphorylation and activation of cyclin-Cdk through removal of the inhibitory phosphates (17Molinari M. Mercurio C. Dominguez J. Goubin F. Draetta G.F. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 71-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 22Jinno S. Suto A. Nagata A. Igarashi M. Kanaoka Y. Nojima H. Okayama H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1549-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). However, the nature of its substrates remains unclear. Besides the likely substrates of cyclin-Cdk, it has been reported recently that Cdc25A binds to and dephosphorylates the homeodomain transcription factor cut (25Coqueret O. Berube G. Nepveu A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4680-4694Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) and phosphoprotein Raf-1 (26Galaktionov K. Jessus C. Beach D. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1046-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 27Xia K. Lee R.S. Narsimhan R.P. Mukhopadhyay N.K. Neel B.G. Roberts T.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4819-4824Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We have reported here for the first time that EGFR is likely to be a substrate of Cdc25A. This conclusion is based on the following findings. First, Cdc25A co-immunoprecipitated with EGFR in Cpd 5-treated Hep3B cells, and GST-Cdc25A directly bound to purified EGFR protein in vitro. Second, Cpd 5, a known inhibitor of Cdc25A phosphatase activity, induced a prolonged EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation. By contrast, in Hep3B cells expressing an inactivated Cdc25A, no EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation was found after the treatment with Cpd 5. This result is consistent with the report that the inactive mutant Cdc25A-C430S protein strongly interacts with both cyclin A-Cdk2 and cyclin E-Cdk2 but does not lead to an activation of Cdk2 kinase activity (38Xu X. Burke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5118-5124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Third, both purified GST-Cdc25A and endogenous Hep3B cellular Cdc25A dephosphorylated EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation in vitro and in cell culture; their dephosphorylation activity can be inhibited by Cpd 5, demonstrating that EGFR is a direct target of Cdc25A. Finally, in EGFR-transfected fibroblast NR-6 cells, Cdc25A was found to bind to wild-type and kinase-mutated EGFR but not to C-terminal-deleted EGFR. Furthermore, only wild-type EGFR was able to be tyrosine-phosphorylated with Cpd 5 treatment. These results suggest that Cdc25A binds to the C-terminal of EGFR and that EGFR kinase activity may be important to the action of Cdc25A on EGFR dephosphorylationIt seems that EGFR dephosphorylation by Cdc25A is selective, because Cdc25A has no effect on insulin receptor tyrosine dephosphorylation. This selectivity is probably because of the structural differences between EGFR and insulin receptor. Most RTKs, such as EGFR and platelet-derived growth factor receptor, are monomers in the cell membrane. Ligand binding induces dimerization of these receptors (1Schlessinger J. Cell. 2000; 103: 211-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3484) Google Scholar). However, members of the insulin receptor family are disulfide-linked dimers of two polypeptide chains forming an α2β2 heterodimer (39Van Obberghen E. Diabetologia. 1994; 27: S125-S134Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Insulin binding to the extracellular domain of the insulin receptor induces a rearrangement in the quaternary heterotetrameric structure that leads to increased autophosphorylation of the cytoplasmic domain (40Hubbard S.R. Mohhammadi M. Schlessinger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11987-11990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). This structure may not be suitable for Cdc25A binding. The fact that the Cdc25A inhibitor Cpd 5 cannot induce insulin receptor tyrosine phosphorylation further supports our hypothesis. In the Cdc25 family, only Cdc25A showed marked tyrosine phosphatase activity directed against EGFR. Our results are consistent with those previous findings that Cdc25A is a more potent tyrosine phosphatase than Cdc25B or Cdc25C when Raf-1 and Cdk are used as the substrates (26Galaktionov K. Jessus C. Beach D. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1046-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 35Wang Z. Southwick E.C. Wang M. Kar S. Rosi K.S. Wilcox C.S. Lazo J.S. Carr B.I.

The mechanisms for this discrepancy have not yet been elucidated. One possibility is that the Cdc25 phosphatase activity is regulated by extensive phosphorylation of the N-terminal regulatory domain, since the alignment of all known dual-specific protein-tyrosine phosphatases shows that they are very different from each other in terms of length and amino acid sequence outside the putative catalytic domain (38Xu X. Burke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5118-5124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar,41Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Cell. 1992; 70: 139-151Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar).The Cdc25 protein phosphatase family has long been regarded as only a cell cycle regulator. However, recent studies have shown that Cdc25A may also play a central role in regulating mitogenic signal transduction pathways. For instance, it has been reported that Cdc25A can physically associate with Raf-1 and regulates Raf-1 tyrosine phosphorylation and its activity (26Galaktionov K. Jessus C. Beach D. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1046-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 27Xia K. Lee R.S. Narsimhan R.P. Mukhopadhyay N.K. Neel B.G. Roberts T.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4819-4824Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The fact that Raf-1 kinase can form complexes with the cell cycle activator Cdc25A provides strong evidence that signal transduction pathways are linked with the cell cycle directly. In HeLa cells, overexpression of Cdc25A in whole cells induced ERK dephosphorylation, and the Cdc25A inhibitor Cpd 5 restored ERK phosphorylation and nuclear translocation, demonstrating that Cdc25A regulated endogenous ERK phosphorylation status in whole cells (34Vogt A. Adachi T. Ducruet A.P. Chesebrough J. Nemoto K. Carr B.I. Lazo J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20544-20550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). We also found that Cpd 5-inhibited Cdc25A activity could contribute to Cdk4 tyrosine phosphorylation and subsequent cell cycle block and cell growth inhibition (35Wang Z. Southwick E.C. Wang M. Kar S. Rosi K.S. Wilcox C.S. Lazo J.S. Carr B.I. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 7211-7216PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we again used Cpd 5 as a tool to reveal that Cdc25A was an EGFR phosphatase and that inhibition of Cdc25A activity by Cpd 5 caused prolonged EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation. These data suggest that Cdc25A acts as the phosphatase for several different substrates in the MAPK pathway and that Cpd 5-induced activation of the MAPK pathway can be triggered by either upstream activation of EGFR or Raf-1 or by direct inhibition of ERK phosphatase Cdc25A. Taken together, our data establish Cdc25A protein phosphatase as a key molecule in regulating and linking cell cycle progression and signal transduction pathway. Inhibition of Cdc25A activity by Cpd 5 not only overstimulates the MAPK pathway from membrane receptor to nuclear, which down-regulates gene transcription, but also directly inhibits cell cycle progression, eventually leading to growth inhibition and cell death. Thus, finding an efficient Cdc25A inhibitor may be of significant importance in controlling cancer cell growth and proliferation. The activated and autophosphorylated growth factor receptors are subject to a rapid dephosphorylation by PTPases (36Swarup G. Cohen S. Garbers D.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

In this study we have searched for proteins that interact with IRS-4 by identifying the proteins that coimmunoprecipitated with IRS-4 from human embryonic kidney 293 cells by microsequencing through mass spectrometry. A group of proteins was found. These included phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, a protein previously identified as an IRS-4 interactor, and several proteins for which there was no previous evidence of IRS-4 association. One of these proteins, named IRAS, that had been found earlier in another context was examined in detail. The results from the overexpression of IRAS, where its amount was about the same as that of IRS-4, indicated that IRAS associated directly with IRS-4 and showed that the increased complexation of IRS-4 with IRAS did not alter the insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-4 or the association of IRS-4 with phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase or Grb2. On the other hand, overexpression of IRAS enhanced IRS-4-dependent insulin stimulation of the extracellularly regulated kinase.

The tyrosine-phosphorylated form of the IRS then binds to various SH2 domain-containing signaling proteins. These include the lipid kinase PI 3-kinase and the linker protein Grb2, which is complexed with Sos, the guanine nucleotide exchanger for Ras. Association of the IRS with PI 3-kinase stimulates its activity, and the resulting elevation of the lipid PI 3,4,5-trisphosphate leads to activation of Akt kinases. Association of the IRS with the Grb2-Sos complex enhances guanine nucleotide exchange on Ras, and the resulting elevation of the GTP form of Ras leads to activation of ERK kinases. The stimulation of PI 3-kinase is a required part of the signal transduction pathway to many of the cellular effects of insulin (2Shepherd P.R. Withers D.J. Siddle K. Biochem.

In the present study, we have searched for proteins that interact with IRS-4 by another method, that of coimmunoprecipitation with IRS-4 followed by separation of the associated proteins by SDS-PAGE and microsequencing of them by mass spectrometry. An advantage of this method over the screening of expression libraries and the yeast two-hybrid screen is that it provides a direct display of all of the main IRS-associated proteins and their relative amounts in the cell type of interest. We chose IRS-4 in HEK293 cells for examination because less was known about the proteins that interact with IRS-4 and because IRS-4 is very abundant in this cell type (14Fantin V.R. Sparling J.D.

Using this approach, we have identified a group of proteins that coimmunoprecipitated with IRS-4 and are thus likely to interact with it. We selected one of these proteins, known as IRAS, for further study. The cDNA encoding IRAS had previously been cloned in a screen of an expression library with antisera raised against the receptor for imidazoline compounds and named IRAS forimidazoline receptor antiseraselected (15Piletz J.E. Ivanov T.R. Sharp J.D. Ernsberger P. Chang C.H. Pickard R.T. Gold G. Roth B. Zhu H. Jones J.C. Baldwin J. Reis D.J. DNA Cell Biol. 2000; 19: 319-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). By itself IRAS may not be an imidazoline receptor, because expression of the protein in COS and Sf9 insect cells did not result in imidazoline binding (15Piletz J.E. Ivanov T.R. Sharp J.D.

However, it is possible IRAS is part of an imidazoline receptor, because expression of IRAS in Chinese hamster ovary cells resulted in an increase in imidazoline-binding sites (15Piletz J.E. Ivanov T.R. Sharp J.D. Ernsberger P. Chang C.H. Pickard R.T. Gold G. Roth B. Zhu H. Jones J.C. Baldwin J. Reis D.J. DNA Cell Biol. 2000; 19: 319-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In this study we provide evidence that full-length IRAS associates directly with IRS-4 and that this association does not affect insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-4 or the binding of PI 3-kinase and Grb2 to IRS-4. However, overexpression of IRAS enhanced the activation of ERK by insulin. Antibodies were purchased from the following sources (listed with the catalog numbers in parentheses): PI 3-kinase (06-195), Tyr(P) (4G10-agarose, 16-101), IRS-1 (06-248), and IRS-2 (06-506) from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.; Tyr(P) (RC20, horseradish peroxidase) from Transduction Laboratories; phosphorylated ERK1/2 (9101), phosphorylated Akt Thr308 (9275), and phosphorylated Akt Ser473 (9271) from New England BioLabs; ERK1/2 (93), Akt 1/2 (8312), Grb2 (255), IRS-2 (1555), and HA epitope tag (7392) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; and the T7 epitope tag (69522-3) from Novagen. Affinity-purified rabbit antibodies against the carboxyl-terminal 16-aa peptide of IRS-4 and against aa 994–1197 of IRS-4 were the ones described in Ref. 14Fantin V.R. Sparling J.D. Slot J.W.

Four types of rabbit antibodies were generated against human IRAS. These were against an amino terminus peptide consisting of aa 7–21, a carboxyl-terminal peptide consisting of aa 1395–1412, the glutathione S-transferase fusion protein with the PX domain of IRAS (aa 10–125), and the glutathione S-transferase fusion protein with the acidic domain of IRAS (aa 559–705).

All four antibodies immunoblotted IRAS, but none was effective for immunoprecipitation (data not shown). Unless noted otherwise, all of the experiments using an antibody against IRAS were performed with the one against the carboxyl-terminal peptide because this antibody was most sensitive for immunoblotting.

DNA fragments encoding the PH-PTB domain (aa 74–339) and the carboxyl-terminal region (aa 331–1257) of IRS-4 were amplified by PCR with 5′ primers containing a BamHI site and 3′ primers without a restriction site. These were ligated into the SRHis vector at the BglII site and the KpnI site that was blunt ended with T7 polymerase. Similarly, DNA fragments encoding the PX domain (aa 1–127), an amino-terminal portion (aa 126–604), the acidic domain (aa 559–705), and the carboxyl-terminal region (aa 685–1504) of IRAS were amplified by PCR and ligated into the BglII/KpnI site of the SRHis vector. The plasmids encoding the pieces of IRS-4 and IRAS each generated a T7 epitope-tagged protein of the expected size (see Fig. 11 B). HEK293 cells were grown on 10- or 3.5-cm plates in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% bovine fetal serum, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin. The medium was changed every other day, and the cells were used upon reaching confluence. To generate HEK293 cells overexpressing IRAS, the cells were transfected with the human IRAS plasmid by means of the LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Stable transfectants were selected and subcloned with 0.8 mg/ml G418. Transfected cell lines were screened for expression of IRAS by immunoblotting. Two lines, one overexpressing IRAS by about 7-fold (designated D5) and another overexpressing it by about 4-fold (designated A2) (see Fig. 3), were selected for experiments. The transfected lines were cultured as described above with the exception that 0.8 mg/ml G418 was included in the medium. For transient transfection, HEK293F cells, which is a subline of HEK293 cells, or Cos7L cells, both of which were purchased from Invitrogen, were used, because the efficiency of transfection of each cell type with the LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent is 99% (Invitrogen literature). The HEK293F cell line and our HEK293 cell line contained the same amounts of IRS-4 and IRAS as assessed by immunoblotting for these proteins (data not shown). The cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and transfected with 0.5 or 1 μg of plasmid for 3.5-cm plates and 5 μg for 10-cm plates with the LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. For experiments on ERK activation, the cells were transfected at about 50% confluence and were used for experiments a day later when they were about 90% confluent. For other experiments transfection was performed with cells at about 90% confluence, and cells were used a day later. For use in experiments the cells were serum-starved in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin for a period of 45 min and then left untreated or treated with 1 μm insulin (Humulin R, Lilly) for the time periods stated in the figure legends. For immunoprecipitations, the cells were then rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and solubilized at 4 °C in lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 40 mm Hepes, pH 7.4) containing either 1.5 or 3% C12E9 detergent (Thesit; Roche Molecular Biochemicals), plus protease inhibitors (1 μm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 10 μm leupeptin, 1 μm pepstatin, 10 μm EP475, 10 μg/ml aprotinin) and phosphatase inhibitors (10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mmsodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium vanadate). Each 10-cm plate was lysed with 3 ml of buffer containing 1.5% C12E9 in the smaller scale immunoprecipitations for immunoblotting or with 1 ml of lysis buffer containing 3% C12E9 in the immunoprecipitations for microsequencing. The lysates were cleared by centrifugation. For direct immunoblotting of whole cell lysates, 35-mm plates of cells were scrapped into 0.5 ml of SDS sample buffer (4% SDS, 20 mmdithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 0.004% bromphenol blue, 1 mm EDTA, 90 mm Tris, pH 6.8, with the same protease and phosphatase inhibitors as given above); the samples were held at 100 °C for 5 min and then passed through a 23-gauge needle to shear the DNA. The protein concentrations of the C12E9 and SDS lysates were measured by a precipitating Lowry assay (23Peterson G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 83: 346-35620Crossref PubMed Scopus (7141) Google Scholar). A 10-cm plate of HEK293 cells contained ∼7 mg of protein. The cells were fractionated exactly as described in Ref. 14Fantin V.R. Sparling J.D. Slot J.W. Keller S.R. Lienhard G.E. Lavan B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10726-10732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar. In brief, the cells were broken by passage through a Balch homogenizer, the cytosol and organelles were separated by centrifugation, the organelles were solubilized in C12E9, and the solubilized proteins were separated from insoluble material by centrifugation. Initially the proteins that coimmunoprecipitated with IRS-4 were examined on a small scale. Cleared lysate (0.5 ml of a lysate in 3% C12E9 containing half of a 10-cm plate) was incubated with 5 μg of antibody against the carboxyl terminus of IRS-4 or with irrelevant IgG at 4 °C for 2 h, and the immunoadsorbates were collected on Pansorbin (5 μl; Calbiochem) or protein A-Sepharose (20 μl;Amersham Biosciences) for 2 h. The beads were washed three times with lysis buffer containing 0.3% C12E9. The immunoprecipitates were solubilized either by holding the beads at 100 °C for 5 min in SDS sample buffer containing 20 mm dithiothreitol (reduced samples) or by mixing at room temperature with SDS sample buffer containing 8 m urea instead of dithiothreitol (nonreduced samples). The SDS samples were separated by SDS-PAGE on gradient gels of 5–12% and 5–15% for the reduced and nonreduced samples, respectively, together with known amounts of standard proteins (Bio-Rad). The separated proteins were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose at 200 mA for 16 h in 25 mm Tris, 190 mm glycine, 20% methanol, 0.005% SDS. The nitrocellulose was stained with colloidal gold total protein stain (Bio-Rad). To isolate the coimmunoprecipitating proteins for microsequencing, the cleared lysate in 3% C12E9 derived from ten 10-cm plates of HEK293 cells was incubated with 50 μg of antibody against IRS-4 or of irrelevant IgG. The immunoprecipitates were collected on 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose, the beads were washed five times, and the proteins were released with 150 μl of SDS sample buffer under reducing or nonreducing conditions. The SDS samples were separated by SDS-PAGE, and the gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (Bio-Rad). The protein bands that were present in the IRS-4 immunoprecipitate but not in the immunoprecipitate with the irrelevant IgG were excised from the gel for sequence analysis. The protein bands were subjected to in-gel reduction, carboxylamidomethylation, and tryptic digestion (Promega). Multiple peptide sequences were determined in a single run by microcapillary reverse-phase chromatography directly coupled to a Finnigan LCQ quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer equipped with a custom nanoelectrospray source. The column was packed in-house with 5 cm of C18 support into a New Objective one-piece 75-μm-internal diameter column terminating in a 8.5-μm tip. The flow rate was 190 nl/min. The ion trap was programmed to acquire successive sets of three scan modes consisting of full scan mass spectroscopy (MS) over alternating ranges of 395–800 m/z or 800–1300 m/z, followed by two data-dependent scans on the most abundant ion in those full scale scans. These data-dependent scans allowed the automatic acquisition of a high resolution (zoom) scan to determine charge state and exact mass and MS/MS spectra for peptide sequence information. MS/MS spectra were acquired with a relative collision energy of 30% and an isolation width of 2.5 Da, and recurring ions were dynamically excluded. Interpretation of the resulting MS/MS spectra of the peptides was facilitated by programs developed at the Harvard Microchemistry Facility and by data base correlation with the algorithm Sequest (24Eng J.K.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10866-10870Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The cleared lysate in 1.5% C12E9 (typically 1 ml containing 1.5 mg of protein) was incubated at 4 °C for 2 h with antibody of interest (typically about 5 μg). The immunoprecipitates were collected on protein A-Sepharose or protein G-Sepharose (20 μl) for 2 h, the beads were washed three times with lysis buffer containing 0.3% C12E9, and the proteins were released by heating with SDS sample buffer at 100 °C for 5 min. The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred electrophoretically to Immobilon-P (Millipore). The blots were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in TBST (150 mm NaCl, 0.3% Tween 20, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.6), incubated with primary antibody in TBST with 0.2% albumin, washed with TBST, incubated with horseradish peroxidase conjugate to antibody against the primary antibody (Bio-Rad) in TBST with 0.2% albumin, and washed. The purchased antibodies were used at dilutions recommended by the manufacturers; the antibodies against IRS-4 and IRAS were used at 4 and 10 μg/ml, respectively. The reactive proteins were then detected with enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (SuperSignal; Pierce). Each blot contained lanes with several different dilutions of a sample that gave a strong signal with the 1× load. These provided an internal measure of signal intensity versus the relative amount, which was used to estimate the relative amounts in the other lanes by visual comparison. In our experience this method of quantitation gives values that are the same as those obtained by densitometry of the autoradiograms. To find proteins that interact with IRS-4, we immunoprecipitated IRS-4 from lysates of HEK293 cells with an antibody against the carboxyl terminus of the protein and analyzed for associated proteins by SDS-PAGE and protein staining. Because the relatively large amount of the precipitating antibody stained strongly and obscured other proteins in the same size range, the immunoprecipitates were examined both under reducing conditions, where the heavy and light chains of the antibody ran at ∼50 and 25 kDa, and under nonreducing conditions, where the intact antibody ran at about 130 kDa. As shown in Fig. 1, a number of proteins, ranging in size from 30 kDa to greater than 200 kDa, were present in the IRS-4 immunoprecipitate but not the control immunoprecipitate. One protein at 66 kDa that was identified as heat shock protein 70 (see below) was present in both but appeared more abundant in the IRS-4 immunoprecipitate. In a similar experiment, the proteins that coimmunoprecipitated with IRS-4 from lysates of HEK293 cells treated with insulin for 10 min were compared with those associated in the unstimulated state under reducing conditions. No difference in the associated proteins was detected (data not shown). To identify the proteins coimmunoprecipitating with IRS-4, the immunoprecipitation was carried out on a larger scale. The associated proteins at 200, 130, 116, 110, 97, 85, 66, 32, and 31 kDa were analyzed by ion trap tandem mass spectrometry as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Table Isummarizes the results of this analysis. These protein bands were identified as: IRAS, a deubiquitinating enzyme, a WD repeat protein, a mixture of the catalytic subunit of PI 3-kinase and a fragment of IRS-4, another fragment of IRS-4, a mixture of the regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase and heat shock protein 90, heat shock protein 70, 14-3-3ε protein, and a mixture of 14-3-3 β and ζ proteins, respectively.Table IProteins coimmunoprecipitating with IRS-4SizeNameAccession numberLengthPeptides1-aNumber sequenced.kDaaa200IRASAAC33104150429130Deubiquitinating enzymeAAF32262108716116WD repeat proteinAAF802441121131101-bMixture of the two proteins.PI 3-kinase catalytic subunitAAB3975310683IRS-4 fragmentNP_00359512571797IRS-4 fragmentNP_003595125722851-bMixture of the two proteins.PI 3-kinase regulatory subunitCCA5686872824Heat shock protein 90HHHU84724766Heat shock protein 70AAA63226641163214–3-3εP426552555311-bMixture of the two proteins.1-cFive peptides common to the β and ζ forms were also sequenced.14–3-3βP31946246114–3-3ζP2931224541-a Number sequenced.1-b Mixture of the two proteins.1-c Five peptides common to the β and ζ forms were also sequenced. Open table in a new tab We decided to investigate the interaction of the protein IRAS with IRS-4, because the limited information about IRAS suggested that it might be an interesting signaling protein. IRS-4 was immunoprecipitated from lysates of untreated and insulin-treated HEK293 cells, and the immunoprecipitates, lysates, and depleted lysates were immunoblotted for IRAS, IRS-4, and Tyr(P). Approximately 90% of the IRS-4 was depleted from the lysate by immunoprecipitation, and approximately the same percentage of the IRAS coimmunoprecipitated with the IRS-4 (Fig. 2 A, compare lanes 11 and 12 versus lanes 5–10). The depleted IRS-4 and IRAS were recovered in the immunoprecipitates (lanes 1 and 2), and insulin treatment had no effect on the amount of IRAS that coimmunoprecipitated with IRS-4 (lanes 1 and 2). Control immunoprecipitations with irrelevant rabbit immunoglobulin yielded no IRS-4 or IRAS (lanes 3 and 4). To be certain that insulin treatment was effective, the samples were blotted for Tyr(P). As expected from our previous study (14Fantin V.R. Sparling J.D. Slot J.W. Keller S.R. Lienhard G.E. Lavan B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10726-10732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), insulin treatment markedly increased the Tyr(P) content of IRS-4 (compare lane 1 with lane 2 and lanes 5–7 with lanes 8–10). No tyrosine phosphorylation of IRAS was detected. The results presented above do not exclude the possibility that rather than being associated with IRS-4, IRAS was directly immunoprecipitated by the antibody against IRS-4. To exclude this possibility, we first attempted to determine whether IRS-4 coimmunoprecipitated with antibody against IRAS. Unfortunately, neither the antibody against a peptide from the carboxyl end of IRAS that was routinely used for immunoblotting nor three other affinity-purified antibodies against other regions of IRAS (see “Experimental Procedures"

Given the importance of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP)-binding elements in the systemic acute-phase response and lung development and the expression of C/EBP isoforms by lung epithelial cells, we hypothesized that conserved C/EBP motifs in the near-distal and proximal promoters contribute to the regulation of SP-D expression by C/EBPs. Five SP-D motifs (−432, −340, −319, −140, and −90) homologous to the C/EBP consensus sequence specifically bound to C/EBPs in gel shift assays, and four of the five sites (−432, −340, −319, and −90) efficiently competed for the binding of C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, or C/EBPδ to consensus oligomers. Cotransfection of C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, or C/EBPδ cDNA in H441 lung adenocarcinoma cells significantly increased the luciferase activity of a wild-type SP-D promoter construct containing 698 bp of upstream sequence (SS698). Transfection of C/EBP also increased the level of endogenous SP-D mRNA in H441 cells. Transactivation of the reporter construct was abrogated by deletion of sequences upstream of −205. Independent site-directed mutagenesis of the sites at −432, −340, and −319 reduced C/EBP-mediated activation by ∼50%, and mutagenesis of the site at −432 in combination with either of the tandem sites at –340 and –319 blocked activation. The conserved AP-1 element at −109 was required for maximal promoter activity, but not for the transactivation of SS698 by C/EBPs. Thus, interactions among C/EBP elements in the near-distal promoter can modulate the promoter activity of SP-D.

Reid K.B. Immunol. Rev. 2000; 173: 66-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 2Crouch E. Wright J.R. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2001; 63: 521-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). SP-D, like pulmonary surfactant protein A and the serum mannose-binding protein (MBL), is a member of the collagenous lectin (collectin) subfamily of mammalian C-type lectins. SP-D is secreted into the distal airways and alveoli by non-ciliated bronchiolar epithelial cells and type II pneumocytes, respectively. Although the lung appears to be a major site of SP-D expression, there is evidence that SP-D is also synthesized by epithelial cells in a variety of extrapulmonary sites, consistent with more generalized roles in innate host defense (3Madsen J. Kliem A. Tornoe I. Skjodt K. Koch C. Holmskov U. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 5866-5870Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Unlike other surfactant proteins, the regulation of SP-D promoter activity is dependent on the combinatorial interactions of relatively ubiquitous transcription factors, including members of the AP-1 family (4He Y. Crouch E.C. Rust K. Spaite E. Brody S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31051-31060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). surfactant protein D acute-phase response CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase retinoblastoma protein hepatocyte nuclear factor-3 The expression of SP-D is increased following many forms of pulmonary injury (5Crouch E.C. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1998; 19: 177-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). For example, the levels of SP-D mRNA and immunoreactive protein in lung lavage increase within several hours to a few days following intratracheal instillation of bacterial endotoxin in rats (6McIntosh J.C. Swyers A.H. Fisher J.H. Wright J.R. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1996; 15: 509-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), following challenge of mice with Pseudomonas aeruginosa(7Jain-Vora S. LeVine A.M. Chroneos Z. Ross G.F. Hull W.M. Whitsett J.A. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 4229-4236Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and in rats exposed to hyperoxia (8Aderibigbe A.O. Thomas R.F. Mercer R.R. Auten R.L. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1999; 20: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In addition, transgenic mice deficient in surfactant protein A or SP-D show abnormal microbial clearance or acute inflammatory responses to microbial challenge (9LeVine A.M. Whitsett J.A. Gwozdz J.A. Richardson T.R. Fisher J.H. Burhans M.S. Korfhagen T.R. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 3934-3940Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Based on these and other data, it has been suggested that the lung collectins contribute to a pulmonary acute-phase response, somewhat analogous to the hepatic acute-phase response (APR) to systemic injury (6McIntosh J.C. Swyers A.H. Fisher J.H. Wright J.R. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1996; 15: 509-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In this regard, a variety of hepatic acute-phase proteins are expressed in the lung, and at least some are elevated following lung injury (10Yang F. Friedrichs W.E.

Molecular regulation of the systemic APR, including the response to endotoxin, is complex and involves a variety of relatively ubiquitous transcription factors. However, members of the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) family of leucine zipper transcription factors figure prominently in the regulation of many APR genes, particularly members of the so-called “Class I” group of APR proteins (15Poli V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29279-29282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar, 16Baumann H. Gauldie J. Immunol.

Rev. 1992; 127: 25-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Like other leucine zipper transcription factors, C/EBPs bind to DNA as homo- or heterodimers and have a diversity of effects that in part reflect tissue and developmental stage-specific expression of various C/EBPs (19Lekstrom-Himes J. Xanthopoulos K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28545-28548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). The expression and activity of different C/EBP isoforms are differentially modulated in response to inflammatory stimuli, including pro-inflammatory cytokines and glucocorticoids. In addition, the activity of these proteins can be influenced by a variety of post-transcriptional mechanisms, including “leaky translation” with the production of truncated forms and protein phosphorylation. C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, and C/EBPδ are expressed by alveolar type II and non-ciliated bronchiolar epithelial cells, the known pulmonary sites of SP-D production (20Li F. Rosenberg E. Smith C.I.

Lung Res. 2000; 26: 383-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). C/EBPα and C/EBPδ are particularly abundant in the lung and increase in fetal rat lung in late gestation during a time when the production of surfactant-associated proteins, including SP-D, is increased. Mice deficient in C/EBPα show abnormalities in alveolar development and often die secondary to the respiratory abnormalities (24Flodby P. Barlow C. Kylefjord H. Ahrlund-Richter L. Xanthopoulos K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24753-24760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Although mice deficient in C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ also expire perinatally, they have no obvious pulmonary phenotype (15Poli V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29279-29282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). Neonatal C/EBPα-null mice show no hepatic APR and fail to induce STAT3 binding in response to systemically administered endotoxin, despite marked increases in C/EBPβ or C/EBPδ (25Burgess-Beusse B.L. Darlington G.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7269-7277Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). However, the pulmonary APR to systemically administered endotoxin is not impaired in this model, and the levels of C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ are increased in the lung following systemic endotoxin administration (25Burgess-Beusse B.L. Darlington G.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7269-7277Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar,26Alam T. An M.R. Papaconstantinou J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5021-5024Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Inspection of the upstream sequence of the SP-D gene revealed five sites consistent with the consensus sequence for C/EBP binding. We have previously utilized H441 human lung adenocarcinoma cells as a model system for studying SP-D promoter activity (27Rust K. Bingle L. Mariencheck W. Persson A. Crouch E.C. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1996; 14: 121-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). To characterize the regulatory role(s) of the putative C/EBP elements, we examined the interactions of oligomers containing these sequences with H441 nuclear proteins from cells cotransfected with cDNAs encoding the three major C/EBP isoforms. We also compared the activity of wild-type constructs and constructs containing mutated consensus sequences in transient transfection assays using luciferase reporter constructs and examined potential functional interactions with the conserved AP-1 element in the proximal promoter. An ∼7-kb EcoRI fragment of the previously described human genomic clone (H5), designated H5E7, containing human SP-D 5′-sequence was isolated and subcloned into pGEM-3Z (Promega) as previously described (4He Y. Crouch E.C. Rust K. Spaite E. Brody S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31051-31060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 27Rust K. Bingle L. Mariencheck W. Persson A. Crouch E.C. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1996; 14: 121-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). All experiments used restriction fragments containing 5′-regulatory sequence; each terminated at a SacI site within the untranslated first exon and were numbered from the transcription start site (27Rust K. Bingle L. Mariencheck W. Persson A. Crouch E.C. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1996; 14: 121-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Most studies employed a SpeI/SacI fragment (SS698) of the human SP-D gene containing 698 bp upstream of the transcription start site (see Fig. 1). For some experiments, we also used a StuI/SacI fragment containing 205 bp upstream of the start site (SS205) and a longer Hin dIII/SacI fragment containing 1674 bp of upstream sequence (HS1674). The restriction fragments were subcloned into a luciferase reporter plasmid (pGL3-Basic, Promega) between the KpnI and SacI sites. NCI H441 human lung adenocarcinoma cells were propagated as previously described (4He Y. Crouch E.C. Rust K. Spaite E. Brody S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31051-31060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 27Rust K. Bingle L. Mariencheck W. Persson A. Crouch E.C. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1996; 14: 121-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In preliminary experiments performed in the late 1990s, we used cells provided by Dr. A. Gazdar (27Rust K. Bingle L. Mariencheck W. Persson A. Crouch E.C. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1996; 14: 121-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). These experiments revealed detectable specific binding of H441 nuclear proteins to C/EBP consensus and NF-IL6 oligomers and to an oligomer containing one of the SP-D motifs, Oligo 340 (see Table I). However, all of the experiments presented here used H441 cells obtained more recently from the American Type Culture Collection. These cells, although similarly supporting SP-D promoter activity and demonstrating detectable levels of endogenous SP-D expression, showed only low levels of endogenous C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, and C/EBPδ as assessed in supershift assays. It is unclear whether these differences reflect substrain variation or differences in culture conditions. However, the reduced levels of endogenous C/EBPs facilitated the cotransfection experiments described below.Table IOligomers synthesized for electrophoretic mobility shift assays Open table in a new tab Several wild-type and mutant oligomers were synthesized (DNA International) for this study (see Table I). A commercial C/EBP consensus oligomer was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Oligomers containing an authentic NF-IL6 site and a mutated NF-IL6 site were also synthesized (see Table I) based on published sequence (28Chen P.L. Riley D.J. Chen-Kiang S. Lee W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 465-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The oligomers and their reverse complements were annealed and used in electrophoretic mobility shift assays as described below. SS698 was subcloned into pGEM-3Z and used for thermal cycling-coupled mutagenesis. Forward- and reverse-directed oligomers were synthesized, each containing a mutated consensus sequence. Plasmid SS698 (SS698) was linearized outside the multiple cloning site by digestion with ScaI and used as template for thermal cycling reactions. Approximately 200 ng of template DNA, 200 ng of forward or reverse mutagenesis oligomer, and 200 ng of an oligomer directed to the appropriate SP6 or T7 RNA polymerase site in pGEM were combined with 200 μm dNTPs (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and 1 unit of Taq polymerase (Fisher) in buffer supplied with the enzyme. Twenty to twenty-five cycles were performed, each consisting of 1 min at 95 °C (denaturing), 1 min at 45 °C (annealing), and 2 min at 70 °C (extension). Resultant DNA fragments were gel-purified using the QIAQuick gel extraction kit (QIAGEN Inc.). The 5′- and 3′-fragments of the mutated promoter DNA were joined together by extension thermal cycling using an overlapping internal oligomer sequence and oligomers to the flanking SP6 and T7 sites for amplification. The mutated fragments were subcloned into a luciferase reporter plasmid as described for the wild-type fragments. The orientation and sequence were verified by restriction mapping and DNA sequencing. Nuclear extracts were prepared from cultured cell lines using a rapid mini-extraction technique (29Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3917) Google Scholar) as previously described (4He Y. Crouch E.C. Rust K. Spaite E. Brody S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31051-31060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The protein content was analyzed by dye binding assay, and the extracts were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −70 °C. Electrophoretic mobility shift (gel retardation) and supershift assays were performed by a modification of a method employed by Bingle and co-workers (30Toonen R.F.G. Gowan S. Bingle C.D. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 467-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) as previously described (4He Y. Crouch E.C. Rust K. Spaite E. Brody S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31051-31060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Antibodies to C/EBPα (14AA), C/EBPβ (C-19), and C/EBPδ (M-17) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Specificity of each antibody was confirmed in supershift assays using nuclear extracts from cells transfected with C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, or C/EBPδ cDNA as described below. For experiments characterizing the promoter activity of mutant constructs, H441 target cells (5 × 105) were transferred to 35-mm plates in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), allowed to attach overnight, and washed twice with RPMI 1640 medium devoid of phenol red (4He Y. Crouch E.C. Rust K. Spaite E. Brody S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31051-31060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The cells were transfected with up to 1.5 μg of the luciferase reporter construct using Lipofectin (Invitrogen) and incubated for 5 h at 37 °C in the absence of serum. The medium was replaced with fresh growth medium, and the cells were incubated overnight. Cells were harvested at 48 h, with one media change at 24 h. C/EBPβ cDNA was obtained by thermal cycling gene amplification of a lung cDNA library (CLONTECH) using a pair of primers: one located at the 5′-end and the other at the 3′-end according to the known human C/EBPβ (NF-IL6) sequence. The full-length DNA sequence was confirmed by automated sequencing. The rat C/EBPα cDNA was a gift from Dr. Steven McKnight (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX), and the rat C/EBPδ cDNA was a gift from Dr. Peter Rotwein (Oregon Health Sciences University, Portland, OR). All cDNAs were subcloned into the pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen) at the Hin dIII and BamHI sites. This vector contains the cytomegalovirus immediate-early promoter, a polylinker, and the bovine growth hormone polyadenylation sequence. The plasmid concentration required for maximal transactivation of the wild-type reporter construct was determined in preliminary dose-response experiments. Although activation by C/EBPα was dose-dependent up to 1.5 μg, activation by C/EBPβ decreased at concentrations above 1.5 μg, whereas activation by C/EBPδ reached a plateau above 0.25 mg. Accordingly, most transfections were performed using 1.5 μg of pcDNA3 containing the desired cDNA or an equivalent weight of the pcDNA3 vector. Protein expression was confirmed by supershift assays. Cell layers were harvested, and transient transfection assays were performed using protein-equivalent amounts of cell extract containing the luciferase reporter constructs. Luciferase activity was measured using a Turner Designs Model TD20/20 luminometer. Transfection efficiency was internally controlled using the pRL-tk vector (Dual-Luciferase kit, Promega). All assays were performed on duplicate or triplicate plates. Except where indicated, at least three separate experiments were performed. In some initial experiments, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assays were performed as previously described (4He Y. Crouch E.C. Rust K. Spaite E. Brody S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31051-31060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). SP-D mRNA was amplified from total RNA isolated from H441 cells. Primers for the full-length product contained untranslated sequence and a several bases of contiguous coding sequence: 5′-primer (+), CCT GCC ATG CTG CTC TTC CTC CTC TCT GC; and 3′-primer (−), CCA GTT GGC TCA GAA CTC GCA GAC CA. Five μg of RNA was reverse-transcribed for 30 min at 50 °C and then denatured for 2 min at 94 °C, followed by 10 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 55 °C, and 1 min at 68 °C. This was followed by 40 more cycles using the same denaturation and annealing conditions, but with the addition of 5 s/cycle of extension at 68 °C. The identity of the amplified fragment was initially confirmed by nested PCR using a different 5′-primer (+), AAT CCT GGA GAC AAA GGA GCA AAG GGA GAA. For this reaction, 1 μl of the full-length PCR product was amplified by conventional PCR. The full-length PCR product was subcloned into the pGEM-T vector (Promega), and the DNA was sequenced from both ends using T7 and SP6 primers. Increases in endogenous mRNA were also estimated by “comparative” PCR using a commercial protocol and reagents (Comparative PCR, Ambion Inc.). This technique is a variant of competitive PCR that competes the cDNAs derived from two preparations of RNA. Each cDNA was tagged with unique reverse transcriptase primers of different lengths. Known amounts of the two tagged cDNAs were mixed in various proportions and then subjected to PCR using an upstream tag-specific primer and a downstream SP-D-specific 3′-sense primer ∼300 nucleotides upstream from the stop codon (TGC TTT CCT GAG CAT GAC TGA T). Short and long tag primers for the amplification of control GAPDH message were provided with the kit. Purified RNA from the control and transfected cells gave essentially identical yields of cDNA/μg of RNA as assessed by incorporation of [α-32P]dATP during the reverse transcription. In most cases, members of the C/EBP family specifically interact with DNA sequences fulfilling the general consensus TT(G/T)NGNAA or TKDNGNAAK (K = G/T; D = A/G/T). Computer-assisted matrix analysis of the upstream sequence of the human SP-D gene using the TRANSFAC Database revealed five sequences consistent with this consensus within 698 bp of the transcription start site at −432, −340, −319, −140, and −90 (Figs. 1and 2A). Two motifs were found in an XbaI/SacI fragment that includes 285 bp upstream of the start site, which we have previously referred to as the “proximal” promoter (4He Y. Crouch E.C. Rust K. Spaite E. Brody S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31051-31060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The first three motifs are located in the region we have designated the “near-distal” promoter. The potential importance of the four most upstream motifs is suggested by the spatial conservation of homologous sequences in the rat and mouse SP-D promoters (27Rust K. Bingle L. Mariencheck W. Persson A. Crouch E.C. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1996; 14: 121-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 31Lawson P.R. Perkins V.C. Holmskov U. Reid K.B. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1999; 20: 953-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and/or in the promoter sequences of bovine conglutinin and CL-43, hepatic host defense collectins believed to have evolved from a primordial SP-D gene (32Kawasaki N. Itoh N. Kawasaki T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 198: 597-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 33Kawasaki N. Satonaka M. Imagawa M. Naito H. Kawasaki T. J. Biochem.

Immunol., in pressGoogle Scholar). A complete C/EBP motif nearly identical to the human sequence at −432 is found in the mouse gene (TTGaGAAA, reverse) (Fig. 2B). The sequence for the corresponding region of the rat promoter is not available. Although the sequences at this position in the CL-43 and conglutinin promoters are quite highly conserved, key elements of the C/EBP motif are absent. Sequences in the region spanning −340 to −319 are highly conserved in the mouse and rat promoters, and the downstream sequences deviate from the C/EBP consensus sequence at only the first position (Fig. 2B) (27Rust K. Bingle L. Mariencheck W. Persson A. Crouch E.C. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1996; 14: 121-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 31Lawson P.R. Perkins V.C. Holmskov U. Reid K.B. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1999; 20: 953-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In addition, these tandem motifs are conserved in the conglutinin and CL-43 promoters (Fig. 2) (32Kawasaki N. Itoh N. Kawasaki T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 198: 597-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 34Hansen, S., Moeller, V., Holm, D., Vitved, L., Bendixen, C., Skjoedt, K., and Holmskov, U. (2002) Mol. Immunol., in pressGoogle Scholar). The C/EBP motif at −140 in the proximal promoter (TTcTGGAA) is nearly identical to the corresponding mouse (cTcTGGAA) and CL-43 or conglutinin (TTcTGGAc) sequences, but diverges significantly in the rat. Interestingly, this motif overlaps an H-APF-1 motif (CTGGRAA) that is completely conserved in the mouse and rat genes and conserved at all but one position in the bovine lectins. By contrast, the motif at –90 is unique to human SP-D. It is not conserved in the bovine collectins or mouse SP-D and is interrupted by a CA repeat in rat SP-D. Thus, the motifs appear to be most highly conserved in the near-distal promoter. Given the low levels of endogenous C/EBP-binding activity in our H441 nuclear extracts (see “Experimental Procedures”), we were able to utilize H441 cells that were transfected with cDNA for C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, or C/EBPδ as a model system for characterizing the interactions of C/EBPs with the motifs. We observed specific binding of the C/EBPs to oligomers containing the motifs at all five sites in electrophoretic mobility shift assays (Figs. Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5). In each case, binding was blocked by competition with the unlabeled oligomer, but not with a mutant oligomer (Table I). In supershift experiments, we also demonstrated binding of each of the three isoforms to each of the five C/EBP motifs.Figure 4C/EBPs bind to the motifs at –340 and −319. H441 cells were transfected with C/EBPδ cDNA, and binding of nuclear proteins was assessed using gel retardation assays.

https://openalex.org/W2010558725,"The herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) a sequence is present as a direct repeat at the two termini of the 152-kilobase viral genome and as an inverted repeat at the junction of the two unique components L and S. During replication, the HSV-1 genome undergoes inversion of L and S, producing an equimolar mixture of the four possible isomers. Isomerization is believed to result from recombination triggered by breakage at the a sequence, a recombinational hot spot. We have identified an enzyme in HeLa cell extracts that preferentially cleaves the a sequence and have purified it to near homogeneity. Microsequencing showed it to be human endonuclease G, an enzyme with a strong preference for G+C-rich sequences. Endonuclease G appears to be the only cellular enzyme that can specifically cleave the a sequence. Endonuclease G also showed the predicted recombination properties in an in vitro recombination assay. Based on these findings, we propose that endonuclease G initiates the a sequence-mediated inversion of the L and S components during HSV-1 DNA replication."
https://openalex.org/W2101772130,"Unregulated expression of vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) plays an important role in tumor growth. We have identified a cell type-specific enhancer, HS-1100, that contributes to VEGF-A transcriptional activation in tumorigenic glioblastoma cell lines. This enhancer exhibits increased accessibility to DNase I in glioblastoma cell lines that express high levels of VEGF-A but not in several other cell lines that express much lower levels of VEGF-A. HS-1100 contains a number of sequence elements that are highly conserved among human, mouse, and rat, including the hypoxia-response element (HRE). We show that the HRE contributes significantly to the cell type-specific enhancer activity of HS-1100 in U87MG glioblastoma cells. We use chromatin immunoprecipitation assays to show that endothelial PAS domain protein 1 (EPAS1) can efficiently bind to the endogenous HRE in U87MG cells but not in HEK293 cells in which the chromosomal HS-1100 is not accessible to DNase I. A dominant negative EPAS1 significantly reduces HS-1100 enhancer activity and VEGF-A levels in U87MG cells. Our results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms of VEGF-A up-regulation during cancer development.

Two hypoxia-inducible factors (Hifs), Hif-1α and endothelial PAS domain protein 1 (EPAS1, also called Hif-2α), have been shown to mediate VEGF-A activation through binding to the HRE upon dimerization with the aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator gene product (ARNT, also called Hif-1β). The transforming growth factor-β pathway and AP-1 protein have been shown to synergize or potentiate hypoxia-induced VEGF-A transcriptional activation (16Sanchez-Elsner T. Botella L.M. Velasco B.

In addition to Hifs and AP-1, SP1 and AP-2 have also been shown to regulate VEGF-A transcription under various conditions (24Shi Q., Le, X. Abbruzzese J.L. Peng Z. Qian C.N. Tang H. Xiong Q. Wang B. Li X.C. Xie K. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 4143-4154PubMed Google Scholar). Many glioblastoma cells constitutively express high levels of VEGF-A without any external stimuli, suggesting that they express intrinsic factors that activate VEGF-A expression to high levels independent of environmental signals. For example, U87MG human glioblastoma cells have been found to express much higher levels of VEGF-A than NIH3T3 fibroblasts, human fetal astrocytes, and A172 glioma cells under tissue culture conditions (25Feldkamp M.M. Lau N. Rak J. Kerbel R.S. Guha A. Int. J. Cancer. 1999; 81: 118-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 26Valter M.M. Wiestler O.D. Pietsche T. Pietsch T. Int. J. Dev. Neurosci. 1999; 17: 565-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Given the prominent role of VEGF-A in tumor angiogenesis, it is critical to understand the molecular basis of high level VEGF-A expression in tumor cells. In this study, we investigated the cis-acting elements and transcription factors involved in constitutive VEGF-A up-regulation in U87MG cells. We identified a new regulatory region of VEGF-A gene that is selectively accessible to DNase I digestion in tumorigenic glioblastoma cell lines and functions as a potent enhancer in U87MG-based reporter assays. This new regulatory region, which we will refer to as “HS-1100,” spans approximately 400 bp of the VEGF-A gene centered on bp −1100 relative to the transcription initiation site and is highly conserved among human, mouse, and rat. We demonstrate that the HRE, which is located within HS-1100, plays an important role in up-regulating VEGF-A expression in U87MG glioblastoma cells and that this is correlated with an enhanced binding of EPAS1 to the HRE. We show further that this enhanced binding appears to be due not to enhanced expression of EPAS1 but rather to the presence of a chromatin architecture that is more permissive for EPAS1 binding in U87MG cells than in other cell types. These results suggest that constitutive chromatin accessibility may facilitate the binding of EPAS1 to the HRE within HS-1100, which acts to up-regulate VEGF-A expression in U87MG cells. The human cervical carcinoma HeLa, the human embryonic kidney HEK293, the human glioblastoma U87MG, U118MG, and A172 cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The human erythroleukemia HEL and chronic myelogenous leukemia K562 cell lines were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The human glioblastoma T98G cell line was cultured in Eagle's minimum essential medium with Earle's balanced salt solution supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. All cell lines were maintained in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. The VEGF-A luciferase reporter plasmids pGL3P.−1100, pGL2P.−550, pGL3P.+500, pGL3P.−1083/−913, pGL3P.−1027/−913, and pGL3P.−1083/−959 were created by cloning the human VEGF-A genomic regions from bp −1302 to −913, −622 to −463, +400/+631, −1083 to −913, −1027 to −913, and −1083 to −959 into the pGL3-promoter vector (Promega). PGL3P.−1083/−913.ΔHRE was created by mutating the consensus Hif-1-binding site (TACGTGGG to TAAAAGGG) in pGL3P.−1083/−913 using QuikChangeTM Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene). EPAS1-(1–481) was created by cloning a fragment encompassing amino acids 1–481 from human EPAS1 plus a FLAG tag sequence at 3′-end into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). All cloned sequences were verified by DNA sequencing. Total RNA was prepared using the High Pure RNA Isolation Kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and subjected to a real time quantitative RT-PCR analysis using the Taqman assay as described previously (27Liu P.Q. Rebar E.J. Zhang L. Liu Q. Jamieson A.C. Liang Y. Qi H. Li P.X. Chen B. Mendel M.C. Zhong X. Lee Y.L. Eisenberg S.P. Spratt S.K. Case C.C. Wolffe A.P. J. Biol.

The VEGF-A mRNA levels were normalized by the 18 S ribosomal RNA levels. Cells were replenished with fresh culture media 24 h before supernatants were collected. VEGF-A concentrations in cell supernatants were determined using a commercial ELISA kit (R & D Systems), following the manufacturer's instructions. Each sample was analyzed in triplicate. Cells were grown to subconfluency and scraped off culture flasks following a brief wash with 1× phosphate-buffered saline. Cell pellets were resuspended in DNase I digestion buffer containing 0.5% IGEPAL at 1–2 × 107 cells/ml buffer. 100-μl aliquots of the resuspended cells were mixed with equal volumes of DNase I buffer containing varying concentrations of DNase I. The DNase I digestion reaction was incubated at 23 °C for 5 min before being stopped with the addition of 8 μl of 0.5 m EDTA and 2 μl of 100 mg/ml RNase A. Following 5 min of RNase A treatment, genomic DNA was isolated using the DNeasy Tissue Kit (Qiagen). 10 μg of each of the DNA samples was digested with EcoRI and resolved in a 1.2% agarose gel by electrophoresis. The DNA from the gel was then transferred onto a nylon membrane. Southern blot was carried out with a radiolabeled DNA probe that corresponds to a region from bp −2274 to −1889 of the human VEGF-A gene, relative to the transcription start site. Following hybridization and washing, the blot was exposed to a PhosphorImager screen. U87MG and HEK293 cells were transfected with the LipofectAMINE Plus Reagent (Invitrogen) in Opti-MEM I reduced serum medium according to the manufacturer's protocol. 24 h after transfection, cells were collected and analyzed for luciferase activities using the Dual-luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega). The luciferase activities were normalized for transfection efficiencies measured by Renilla luciferase activities. 1 × 107 U87MG or HEK293 cells were pelleted, resuspended in 400 μl of buffer A (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and incubated on ice for 10 min. Cells were lysed by adding 25 μl of 10% IGEPAL and vortexing vigorously for 10 s. After centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 30 s at 4 °C, the pellets were resuspended in 100 μl of ice-cold buffer C (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 25% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and gently shaken at 4 °C for 30 min. After centrifugation at 4 °C for 15 min, the supernatants were saved, and protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). 50 μg of protein from each nuclear extract was analyzed via electrophoresis on a 4–20% Tris-HCl gel (Bio-Rad) followed by Western blotting using anti-EPAS1 and anti-ARNT antibodies (Novus Biologicals). The Western blots were visualized by SuperSignal West Dura Extended Duration Substrate (Pierce). Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were carried out using the Acetyl-Histone H3 Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay Kit (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The antisera used are as follows: 1.5–2.0 μg/ml rabbit control serum (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), 1.5 μg/ml anti-EPAS1 antiserum (Novus Biologicals), and 2.0 μg/ml anti-E2F1 antiserum (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). After ChIP, the precipitated genomic DNA was analyzed by Taqman using the following primers and probes. For amplifying a DNA region containing the HRE on the human VEGF-A promoter, sequences of the forward and reverse primers are 5′-CAGGAACAAGGGCCTCTGTCT and 5′-GCACTGTGGAGTCTGGCAAA, respectively; the sequence of the probe is 5′-CCCAGCTGCCTCCCCCTTTGG. For amplifying a site centered on bp 1050 relative to the human VEGF-A transcription start site, sequences of the forward and reverse primers are 5′-GCCTCCGAAACCATGAACTTT and 5′-TGGTGGAGGTAGAGCAGCAA, respectively; the sequence of the probe is 5′-TGCTGTCTTGGGTGCATTGGAGCC. For amplifying the E2F1-binding site on p14ARFpromoter, sequences of the forward and reverse primers are 5′- CATGTGGCCCCAGCACA and 5′-CTCCCCGGTAGGTAGATTTCACT, respectively; the sequence of the probe is 5′-CACGGTGTTGGGTAAA. The genomic DNA measurements were normalized by 18 S genomic levels. Recombinant adenoviruses were constructed using the Adeno-X Expression System (CLONTECH). The β-galactosidase cDNA fragment and the EPAS-(1–481) cDNA fragment, which contains a FLAG tag sequence, were cloned into pShuttle vector. The mammalian expression cassettes in pShuttle were then transferred to Adeno-X viral DNA by in vitro ligation. Recombinant adenoviral plasmids were packaged by transfecting HEK293 cells, and adenoviruses were harvested from transfected HEK293 cells lysed with three consecutive freeze-thaw cycles. Recombinant adenoviruses were amplified in HEK293 cells and titered by the TCID50 assay. Sequence alignments were performed using the Align X module of the Vector NTI Suite 6 software package with default settings. The sequences used are from GenBankTM accession numbers AF095785 (human VEGF-A), U41383 (mouse VEGF-A), U22373 (rat VEGF-A), and unpublished data. 2B. Chen and E. J. Rebar, unpublished data. VEGF-A expression levels in various human cell lines were measured by quantitative RT-PCR (Taqman) and ELISAs (Table I). A human glioblastoma cell line, U87MG, exhibited 9–50-fold higher VEGF-A mRNA levels than several other cell lines, including HeLa, HEK293, HEL, and K562. Correspondingly, U87MG cells also secreted much higher amounts of VEGF-A protein into culture supernatants. The high endogenous VEGF-A levels in U87MG cells are consistent with the fact that these cells are derived from a highly vascularized tumor type.Table IVEGF-A expression levels in various human cell linesCell lineVEGF-A mRNA1-aVEGF-A mRNA levels were measured by Taqman assays and normalized by 18 S ribosomal RNA levels.VEGF-A protein1-bConcentrations of VEGF-A in cell supernatants after 24 h of incubation were measured by ELISAs.

Open table in a new tab To delineate the mechanisms of VEGF-A up-regulation, we set out to identify regulatory elements and transcription factors that activate VEGF-A transcription in U87MG cells. Because DNase I-accessible regions often harbor cell type-specific enhancer elements, DNase I-hypersensitive site mapping was performed in the above-mentioned cell lines (Fig. 1). Two hypersensitive sites centered at bp −550 and +1 relative to the transcription start site of the VEGF-A promoter were clearly observed in all cell lines. A third and weaker hypersensitive site centered at bp +500 could also been seen in all cell lines, which was more apparent under longer exposure (data not shown). These three hypersensitive sites have been described previously (27Liu P.Q. Rebar E.J. Zhang L. Liu Q. Jamieson A.C. Liang Y. Qi H. Li P.X. Chen B. Mendel M.C. Zhong X. Lee Y.L. Eisenberg S.P. Spratt S.K. Case C.C. Wolffe A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11323-11334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) in a variety of cell types. A fourth and very intense hypersensitive site centered at bp −1100 of the VEGF-A promoter, which we will refer to as “HS-1100,” was only observed in U87MG cells. These data suggest that the −550, +1, and +500 DNase I-hypersensitive regions may contain elements that are important for the normal regulation of VEGF-A in various cell types, whereas HS-1100 may contain cell type-specific regulatory elements that contribute to the extremely high level of VEGF-A expression in U87MG cells. An alignment of promoter regions of VEGF-A (Fig. 2A) shows that there is a broad region of enhanced sequence conservation in the VEGF-A locus in the same location as HS-1100 (gray profile), which becomes more prominent when considered in terms of regulatory element-sized sequence blocks (black profile). Although this region encompasses the HRE (−975 to −957 relative to the human VEGF-A transcription initiation site), it clearly extends further upstream and downstream of this element and includes many additional blocks of conserved sequence (Fig. 2B). These results support the notion that regulators of VEGF-A transcription may operate via binding to cis-regulatory elements within HS-1100.Figure 2Sequence alignment of VEGF-A promoters from human, mouse, and rat.A, sequence conservation of the VEGF-A promoter among human, mouse, and rat. Each point in the gray profile indicates the fraction of human bases conserved in mouse and rat for a 50-bp sequence window centered on that point.

The resulting plasmid, pGL3P.-1100, was tested for enhancer activity by transient transfection in U87MG and HEK293 cells. Fig. 3A shows that pGL3P.−1100 exhibited over 10-fold activation of the SV40 promoter in U87MG cells but only 2-fold in HEK293 cells. For comparison, pGL3P.−550 and pGL3P.+500, which contain DNA fragments from the −550 and +500 DNase I-accessible regions, respectively, exhibited no more than 3-fold activation of the SV40 promoter in both cell lines. Therefore, HS-1100 is a U87MG cell-specific enhancer for the VEGF-A gene. Nested deletion analysis was performed to define the boundaries of HS-1100 (Fig. 3B). A 5′ deletion up to bp −1083 (pGL3P.−1083/−913) had no effect on the enhancer activity in U87MG cells, whereas it almost completely abolished the enhancer activity in HEK293 cells. A further 5′ deletion to bp −1027 (pGL3P.−1027/−913) reduced the enhancer activity in U87MG cells by 37%. A further 3′ deletion to bp −959 (pGL3P.−1083/−959), which abolished the HAS, reduced the enhancer activity in U87MG cells by 80%. Both pGL3P.−1027/−913 and pGL3P.−1083/−959 gave similar reductions of HS-1100 enhancer activity as pGL3P.−1083/−913 in HEK293 cells. Therefore, the minimally sized fragment required for full function of HS-1100 as determined by reporter assays runs from bp −1083 to −913 in U87MG cells and from bp −1302 to −913 in HEK293 cells. These results are consistent with the notion that HS-1100 functions in a cell type-specific manner. In addition, these results suggest that multiple elements are required for full activity of HS-1100. Because HS-1100 harbors the HRE, we tested whether the HRE contributes to the function of HS-1100. A 3-bp substitution in the Hif-1-binding site that has previously been shown to abolish the hypoxia response (14Forsythe J.A. Jiang B.H. Iyer N.V. Agani F. Leung S.W. Koos R.D. Semenza G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4604-4613Crossref PubMed Scopus (3195) Google Scholar) caused ∼70% reduction of HS-1100 enhancer activity in U87MG cells (Fig. 3B), suggesting that the HRE accounts for a significant part of the enhancer activity of HS-1100 in these cells. Immunoblotting with nuclear extracts showed that EPAS1 and ARNT were expressed at comparable levels in U87MG and HEK293 cells (Fig. 4), whereas Hif-1α was hardly detectable in both cell lines (data not shown). This result indicates that the different VEGF-A levels observed in U87MG and HEK293 cells cannot be explained by differential expression levels of Hifs. Next, we tested whether there is a difference in the binding of EPAS1 to the HRE in these two cell lines. Although EPAS1 can bind to the HRE in in vitro gel mobility shift assays (28Tian H.

To determine this, ChIP assays were performed in U87MG and HEK293 cells. In U87MG cells (Fig. 5A), immunoprecipitation with an anti-EPAS1 antiserum enriched a DNA region containing the HRE by 5.7-fold compared with a preimmune serum. As an internal control for specificity, a site centered at 1050-bp downstream of the VEGF-A transcription start site was not significantly enriched. In contrast, immunoprecipitation with the anti-EPAS1 antiserum did not significantly enrich the HRE site in HEK293 cells (Fig. 5B). As a positive control in HEK293 cells, an anti-E2F1 antiserum could enrich an E2F1-binding site within a DNase I-accessible region on p14ARFpromoter 3A. Lai, unpublished data. by 3.7-fold. These results show that EPAS1 can bind efficiently to the HRE in U87MG cells, whereas it cannot do so in HEK293 cells, most likely due to the less accessible nature of the HRE in this cell type.Figure 5Chromatin immunoprecipitation of the human VEGF-A promoter.A, chromatin was immunoprecipitated from U87MG cells with the indicated antisera. The enriched genomic DNA was measured by Taqman analysis amplifying a site either containing the HRE (gray bars) or centered at bp +1050 (black bars) on the human VEGF-A promoter as described under “Experimental Procedures.” B, chromatin was immunoprecipitated from HEK293 cells with the indicated antisera, and the enriched genomic DNA was measured by Taqman analysis amplifying a site either containing the HRE on the human VEGF-A promoter (the middle bar) or containing an E2F1-binding site on p14ARF promoter (the right bar) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” For both A and B, the mean values from preimmune serum immunoprecipitated samples were arbitrarily defined as 1.0.

Although the catalytic properties of the domains are established, the role of both domains in the recognition of the DNA substrates is just now emerging (17Rajendran S. Jezewska M.J. Bujalowski W. J.

Biol. 2001; 308: 477-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Quantitative equilibrium studies have shown that both human and rat pol β bind the ssDNA in two binding modes (17Rajendran S.

Biol. 2001; 308: 477-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The binding modes differ in the number of occluded nucleotide residues and have been referred to as the (pol β)16 and (pol β)5 binding modes (19Jezewska M.J. Rajendran S. Bujalowski W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16123-16136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 20Rajendran S. Jezewska M.J. Bujalowski W. J. Mol.

The existence of the two binding modes is a consequence of the presence of the two structural domains of the protein possessing the DNA-binding subsites, with different DNA binding capabilities (17Rajendran S. Jezewska M.J. Bujalowski W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31021-31031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 20Rajendran S. Jezewska M.J. Bujalowski W. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 477-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Both DNA-binding subsites form the total DNA-binding site of the polymerase. In the (pol β)16 binding mode, both the 8- and 31-kDa domains are involved in interactions with the ssDNA, i.e. the total DNA-binding site is engaged in interactions with the nucleic acid. In the (pol β)5 binding mode, only the 8-kDa domain is engaged in interactions with the DNA (17Rajendran S. Jezewska M.J. Bujalowski W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31021-31031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 20Rajendran S. Jezewska M.J. Bujalowski W. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 477-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The subsite located on the 8-kDa domain has similar affinity for both ss and dsDNA, while the subsite on the 31-kDa domain seems to have a preference for the dsDNA, although this has not been rigorously proven.The mechanism of the formation of the (pol β)16 and (pol β)5 binding modes, by human pol β, is a complex, multiple-step sequential process (21Jezewska M.J. Rajendran S. Bujalowski W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11794-11810Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In both ssDNA-binding modes the formation of the protein-nucleic acid complex is initiated through the DNA-binding subsite located on the 8-kDa domain (21Jezewska M.J. Rajendran S. Bujalowski W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11794-11810Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Thus the DNA-binding subsite on the 8-kDa domain plays the role of the initiation-binding site of the enzyme to the ssDNA. Analysis of the kinetic data revealed that transitions to subsequent intermediates are also generated through interactions at the 8-kDa domain-DNA interface resulting in the engagement of the 31-kDa domain in interactions with the nucleic acid. The DNA-binding initiation role of the subsite located on the 8-kDa domain is reflected in its energetically homogeneous structure and the capability of accommodating DNA oligomers of different lengths with similar affinity (22Jezewska M.J. Rajendran S. Bujalowski W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3295-3307Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar).In the base-excision repair processes, human pol β fills the ssDNA gaps formed in the damaged DNA (1Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar, 5Sobol R.W. Horton J.K. Kühn R. Hua G. Singhal R.K. Prasad R. Rajewsky K. Wilson S.H.

Thus, the physiological substrates for the enzyme are gapped DNAs that have a stretch of ssDNA embedded between the primer and the dsDNA downstream from the primer. Thermodynamic studies of human pol β binding to the gapped DNA substrates indicate that the ability of the 8-kDa domain DNA-binding site to interact with different nucleic acid conformations is crucial for anchoring the enzyme on the gap (19Jezewska M.J. Rajendran S. Bujalowski W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16123-16136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 20Rajendran S. Jezewska M.J. Bujalowski W. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 477-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In these complexes, the 8-kDa domain binds to the ss and/or dsDNA part of the DNA, downstream from the primer, depending on the length of the ssDNA gap. The 31-kDa domain of the enzyme associates with the dsDNA part of the gapped DNA substrate that contains the primer. Thus, similar to the formation of the (pol β)16 binding mode, engagement of the entire total DNA-binding site of the enzyme provides a large increase of the affinity for the specific recognition of the gapped DNA structure.Understanding the mechanistic aspects of the pol β-gapped DNA recognition process is of great importance for elucidation of the polymerase mechanism at the molecular level. Such analysis will also provide important insights into the recognition mechanisms of specific DNA substrates by other nucleic acid-dependent polymerases. The fundamental questions that arise here are the following. How does the mechanism of the gapped DNA recognition differ from the mechanisms of the enzyme binding to the ssDNA in its different binding modes? What is the formation rate of the different intermediates? What are the energetics of the conversions between the different intermediates? How does the length of the ssDNA gap and the presence of the 5′-terminal phosphate group affect the mechanism? Is there a particular step that makes a dominant contribution to the recognition process? Despite its paramount importance, the direct analysis of the dynamics of the gapped DNA substrate recognition by human pol β has not been quantitatively addressed before.In this article, we report the stopped-flow kinetic analyses of human pol β interactions with the gapped DNA substrates that differ by the number of the nucleotide residues in the ssDNA gap. We provide direct evidence that the mechanism of the specific gap complex formation by human pol β is a three-step, sequential reaction. The bimolecular step includes a very fast association with the DNA, through the 8-kDa domain, followed by two docking steps. The dynamics of the bimolecular step is independent of the length of the ssDNA gap. The internal transition, directly following the bimolecular step, is the major docking step, and is characterized by a large, favorable free energy change for the examined gapped DNA substrates. In this step the DNA-binding subsite located on the 31-kDa domain engages in interactions with the DNA. The 5′-terminal PO4− group downstream from the primer does not guide the polymerase to the gap, although it stabilizes the first intermediate in the case of the gapped DNA substrate with a longer gap. The data indicate that the phosphate group affects the enzyme orientation in the complex with the DNA and the structure of the ssDNA gap in the complex with the enzyme.

Biol. 2001; 308: 477-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The binding modes differ in the number of occluded nucleotide residues and have been referred to as the (pol β)16 and (pol β)5 binding modes (19Jezewska M.J. Rajendran S. Bujalowski W. J. Biol.

The existence of the two binding modes is a consequence of the presence of the two structural domains of the protein possessing the DNA-binding subsites, with different DNA binding capabilities (17Rajendran S. Jezewska M.J. Bujalowski W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31021-31031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 20Rajendran S. Jezewska M.J. Bujalowski W. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 477-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Both DNA-binding subsites form the total DNA-binding site of the polymerase. In the (pol β)16 binding mode, both the 8- and 31-kDa domains are involved in interactions with the ssDNA, i.e. the total DNA-binding site is engaged in interactions with the nucleic acid. In the (pol β)5 binding mode, only the 8-kDa domain is engaged in interactions with the DNA (17Rajendran S. Jezewska M.J. Bujalowski W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31021-31031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 20Rajendran S. Jezewska M.J. Bujalowski W. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 477-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The subsite located on the 8-kDa domain has similar affinity for both ss and dsDNA, while the subsite on the 31-kDa domain seems to have a preference for the dsDNA, although this has not been rigorously proven. The mechanism of the formation of the (pol β)16 and (pol β)5 binding modes, by human pol β, is a complex, multiple-step sequential process (21Jezewska M.J. Rajendran S. Bujalowski W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11794-11810Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In both ssDNA-binding modes the formation of the protein-nucleic acid complex is initiated through the DNA-binding subsite located on the 8-kDa domain (21Jezewska M.J. Rajendran S. Bujalowski W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11794-11810Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Thus the DNA-binding subsite on the 8-kDa domain plays the role of the initiation-binding site of the enzyme to the ssDNA. Analysis of the kinetic data revealed that transitions to subsequent intermediates are also generated through interactions at the 8-kDa domain-DNA interface resulting in the engagement of the 31-kDa domain in interactions with the nucleic acid. The DNA-binding initiation role of the subsite located on the 8-kDa domain is reflected in its energetically homogeneous structure and the capability of accommodating DNA oligomers of different lengths with similar affinity (22Jezewska M.J. Rajendran S. Bujalowski W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3295-3307Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In the base-excision repair processes, human pol β fills the ssDNA gaps formed in the damaged DNA (1Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar, 5Sobol R.W. Horton J.K. Kühn R. Hua G. Singhal R.K. Prasad R. Rajewsky K. Wilson S.H. Nature. 1996; 379: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar, 9Prasad R. Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18096-18101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the physiological substrates for the enzyme are gapped DNAs that have a stretch of ssDNA embedded between the primer and the dsDNA downstream from the primer. Thermodynamic studies of human pol β binding to the gapped DNA substrates indicate that the ability of the 8-kDa domain DNA-binding site to interact with different nucleic acid conformations is crucial for anchoring the enzyme on the gap (19Jezewska M.J. Rajendran S. Bujalowski W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16123-16136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 20Rajendran S. Jezewska M.J. Bujalowski W. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 477-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In these complexes, the 8-kDa domain binds to the ss and/or dsDNA part of the DNA, downstream from the primer, depending on the length of the ssDNA gap. The 31-kDa domain of the enzyme associates with the dsDNA part of the gapped DNA substrate that contains the primer. Thus, similar to the formation of the (pol β)16 binding mode, engagement of the entire total DNA-binding site of the enzyme provides a large increase of the affinity for the specific recognition of the gapped DNA structure. Understanding the mechanistic aspects of the pol β-gapped DNA recognition process is of great importance for elucidation of the polymerase mechanism at the molecular level. Such analysis will also provide important insights into the recognition mechanisms of specific DNA substrates by other nucleic acid-dependent polymerases. The fundamental questions that arise here are the following. How does the mechanism of the gapped DNA recognition differ from the mechanisms of the enzyme binding to the ssDNA in its different binding modes? What is the formation rate of the different intermediates? What are the energetics of the conversions between the different intermediates? How does the length of the ssDNA gap and the presence of the 5′-terminal phosphate group affect the mechanism? Is there a particular step that makes a dominant contribution to the recognition process? Despite its paramount importance, the direct analysis of the dynamics of the gapped DNA substrate recognition by human pol β has not been quantitatively addressed before. In this article, we report the stopped-flow kinetic analyses of human pol β interactions with the gapped DNA substrates that differ by the number of the nucleotide residues in the ssDNA gap. We provide direct evidence that the mechanism of the specific gap complex formation by human pol β is a three-step, sequential reaction. The bimolecular step includes a very fast association with the DNA, through the 8-kDa domain, followed by two docking steps. The dynamics of the bimolecular step is independent of the length of the ssDNA gap. The internal transition, directly following the bimolecular step, is the major docking step, and is characterized by a large, favorable free energy change for the examined gapped DNA substrates. In this step the DNA-binding subsite located on the 31-kDa domain engages in interactions with the DNA. The 5′-terminal PO4− group downstream from the primer does not guide the polymerase to the gap, although it stabilizes the first intermediate in the case of the gapped DNA substrate with a longer gap. The data indicate that the phosphate group affects the enzyme orientation in the complex with the DNA and the structure of the ssDNA gap in the complex with the enzyme.

All mutations, chimeric or point mutations, were restricted to IVS5, while the YAI-containing segment in IVS6, i.e. the primary interaction site with benzothiazepines, remained intact. Slowed inactivation rate and incomplete steady state inactivation, a behavior of some mutants, were accompanied by a reduced or by a complete loss of use-dependent block by diltiazem. Single channel properties of mutants that lost use dependence toward diltiazem were characterized by drastically elongated mean open times and distinctly slower time constants of open time distribution. Mutation of individual residues of the IVMLF segment in IVS5 did not mimic the complete loss of use dependence as observed for the replacement of the whole stretch. These results establish evidence that amino acids that govern inactivation and the drug-binding site and other amino acids that are located distal from the putative drug-binding site contribute significantly to the function of the benzothiazepine receptor region. The data are consistent with a complex “pocket” conformation that is responsive to a specific class of L-type calcium channel inhibitors. The data allow for a concept that multiple sites within regions of the α1 subunit contribute to auto-regulation of the L-type Ca2+ channel.

L-type Ca2+ channels of cardiac, skeletal, and smooth muscle play a central role in excitation-contraction coupling. It is also believed that these channels may participate in the pathophysiology of some cardiac arrhythmias, hypertension, and angina pectoris (1Weir M.R. Cardiovasc.

Increases in [Ca2+]i have been linked to a variety of changes in membrane properties that contribute to the changes in excitability, conduction, refractoriness, automaticity, and vascular resistance (1Weir M.R.

In terms of excitation-contraction coupling, Ca2+ enters the cell during depolarization through voltage-activated calcium channels and triggers contraction but also is responsible for activation of other cellular functions. In the course of sustained depolarization, Ca2+ currents progressively undergo voltage-dependent inactivation with specific kinetics, primarily regulated by the membrane potential. Ca2+ channels are the target for three main classes of drugs that include dihydropyridines (DHP), 1The abbreviations used are: DHPdihydropyridinesPAAphenylalkylaminesBTZbenzothiazepinesWTwild type1The abbreviations used are: DHPdihydropyridinesPAAphenylalkylaminesBTZbenzothiazepinesWTwild type phenylalkylamines (PAA), and benzothiazepines (BTZ). These molecules bind specifically to different sites of the Ca2+ channel α1subunit, and their binding domains are allosterically linked to each other (5Hering S. Aczel S. Grabner M. Doring F.

Ca2+ channel antagonists, particularly diltiazem and verapamil, block calcium channels in a voltage- and use-dependent manner; thus the binding of the drug facilitates protein conformational changes that alter channel function by interfering with channel gating. These drugs serve as useful tools in dissecting molecular mechanisms of channel inactivation. Several amino acid residues that are involved in Ca2+ antagonist binding, when mutated, change the electrophysiological properties of the channel, such as voltage-dependent inactivation.

Mutation of key amino acids in these segments alters not only the high affinity drug-binding sites but also the complexity of the kinetic behavior of the channels, consequently changing use-dependent block particularly for the PAAs and BTZs (for review, see Ref. 12Hering S.

Consequently, mutants constructed in this region lost the characteristic use-dependent block by PAA and BTZ and recovered from inactivation significantly faster after drug block compared with the wild type channel. However, [3H]PN200–110 (isradipine) binding and allosteric interaction assays revealed that the DHP and BTZ receptor sites maintained normal coupling in the chimeric mutant channels. In the present study, we analyze the impact of individual amino acids in IVS5 (Ile, Val, Met, Leu, Phe) on the inactivation of the human α1C subunit. Our observations with point mutants in IVS5 strongly suggest that amino acid substitutions outside of or distal to the IIIS6 and IVS6 segments, where the key positions for drug interactions are located, play a critical ancillary role in determining inactivation kinetics and use dependence of the channel. Amino acids that reside in the IVS5 region of human heart α1C (Ile, Val, Met, Leu, Phe) were sequentially mutagenized. A two-step PCR method, termed “megaprimer” PCR was utilized. The first set of oligonucleotides (forward primers) carrying the desired bases had at least 15 nucleotides on either side of the mutation and had the sequence GTG GCC CTC CTG ATC TTC ATG CTG TTC TTC ATC; CTC CTG ATC GTG ATG GTG TTC TTC ATC TAC GCG; CTG ATC GTG ATG CTG ATG TTC ATC TAC GCG GTG; CCC TAT GTG GCC CTC CTG CTC TTC CTG GTG TTC TTC ATC TAC GCG for V1339F, L1341V, F1342M, and HHT-5421, respectively. The reverse primer GGT TGA TGA TCA GGA AGG C was designed around the BclI site (4311) of hHT-1 (14Schultz D. Mikala G. Yatani A. Engle D.B. Iles D.E. Segers B. Sinke R.J. Weghuis D.O. Klockner U.

PCR was performed on the hHT-1 template using in each reaction one mutant primer and a BclI primer. The amplification products (526 bp) were isolated from high range agarose gel. After purification, these products were utilized as megaprimers, and PCR amplifications were done between a primer designed around the AatII site (3807) and the individual megaprimers. The products were gel-isolated again and ligated into the EcoRV site of pBlueScript KS (−), and DNA from a number of resultant clones was sequenced to identify correct mutant cDNAs. Finally, the mutant cassettes were liberated by AatII and BclI restriction cleavage, isolated, and ligated into AatII/BclI-cleaved hHT-1 to replace the corresponding wild type segment of α1C. Expression of the wild type and mutant calcium channels was done as previously described (15Klockner U. Mikala G. Varadi M. Varadi G. Schwartz A. J. Biol.

Briefly, female Xenopus laevis (purchased from Xenopus I, Ann Arbor, MI) frogs were anesthetized by exposing them for 15–20 min to 0.15% methanesulfonate salt of 3-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester (MS-222; Sigma) solution before pieces of the ovary were removed. The follicular layers of the oocytes were digested with 2.0 mg/ml collagenase (Type IA; Sigma) dissolved in OR-2 medium (in mm): 82.5 NaCl, 1 KCl, 1 MgCl2, and 5 HEPES, pH 7.5. Stage V-VI oocytes were incubated at 19 °C in P/S medium (in mm): 96 NaCl, 2.0 KCl, 1.0 MgCl2, 1.8 CaCl2, 5 HEPES, 2.5 sodium pyruvate, and 0.5 theophylline at pH 7.5.

Ca2+ channel currents were recorded 2–4 days postinjection of the cRNAs at room temperature (20–21 °C). To minimize contamination with chloride current, oocytes were microinjected with 50 nl of a 40 mm K4-BAPTA solution (potassium 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N, N, N′,N′-tetraacetate in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.05) 60 min prior to current recording. Whole cell currents were recorded using the standard two-microelectrode voltage-clamp technique. The recording medium was a Ca2+- and Cl−-free solution composed of (in mm): 40 Ba(OH)2, 50 N-methyl-d-glucamine, 2 KOH, 5 HEPES, pH adjusted to 7.4, with methanesulfonic acid. Voltage and current electrodes were filled with 3 m KCl and had a resistance of 0.5–1.5 megohms. Currents were recorded using an Axoclamp-2A (Axon Instruments Inc., Foster City, CA) amplifier. Whole cell leakage and capacitive currents were subtracted on line using the P/4 procedure (19Bezanilla F. Armstrong C.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1977; 70: 549-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). Currents were digitized at 1 kHz after being filtered at 1 kHz. The pClamp software (version 5.6 Axon Instruments) was used for data acquisition, and version 6.0.3 was used for analysis. Ba2+ currents were elicited by a 350-ms-long depolarizing pulse from a holding potential of −80 mV to test potentials between −30 mV and +40 mV in 10-mV increments to determine the peak potentials of the current voltage relationship of the Ca2+ channel construct. Use-dependent block was determined as the inhibition of peak IBa during trains of 15 test pulses of 80-ms duration applied at 0.5 Hz from a holding potential of −60 mV to test potentials +20 mV positive to the peak potential of the I-V curves. Identical pulse protocols were used in the presence of drugs. Diltiazem (racemic) was perfused in the bath (for a 2.5-min period) at concentrations of 200 μm. This concentration was selected because it provided sufficient block for the use-dependent measurements in Xenopus oocytes (13Motoike H.K. Bodi I. Nakayama H. Schwartz A. Varadi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9409-9420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). A double pulse protocol was used in those experiments measuring the voltage dependence of steady-state inactivation. The protocol consisted of a 5-s prepulse that ranged from −80 to +50 mV at a holding potential of −80 mV followed by a 30-ms return pulse to −80 mV. Finally a 400-ms-long test pulse was applied at +20 mV. The curves were fit to the Boltzmann equation y =A1 − A2/(1 + exp (x − x0)/dx)*A2. Recovery of IBa from inactivation was studied after depolarizing the calcium channels during a 3-s prepulse to +20 mV. The time course of IBa recovery from inactivation was estimated at a holding protential of −80 mV by applying a 400-ms test pulse to +20 mV at various time intervals after the conditioning prepulse. Peak IBa values were normalized to the peak current amplitude measured during the prepulse. After the double-pulse protocol, the membrane was hyperpolarized to −100 mV for 3 min to permit complete recovery from inactivation and block. Single channel recordings were obtained from cell-attached patches using an AXON 200 amplifier (20Yamaguchi H. Muth J.N. Varadi M. Schwartz A. Varadi G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1357-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). After mechanically removing the vitelline membrane of Xenopus oocytes (after about 5 min of incubation in hypertonic solution composed of in mm: 200 potassium-aspartate, 20 KCl, 1.0 MgCl2, 10 EGTA, 10 HEPES), the membrane potential of the oocytes was “zeroed” with a high potassium medium composed of (in mm): 140 KCl, 2 MgCl2, 5 EGTA, and 5 HEPES, pH 7.4. The patch electrodes were coated with Sylgard, then fire-polished, and had resistances between 5 and 20 megohms. The pipette solution contained (in mm): 110 BaCl2 and 10 HEPES, pH 7.4. Single channel currents were low pass-filtered at 2 kHz, digitized at 10 kHz, and stored for off-line analysis. Only well resolved openings were measured; therefore, all single channel experiments were conducted in the presence of 1 μm Bay K8644 at room temperature (22–23 °C). To cancel capacitive transients and leak currents, blank records with no openings were subtracted from those with openings. Patch potentials were maintained at −80 mV, and 500 depolarizing pulses (180 ms long) to +20, +30, and +40 mV, respectively, were delivered. Open and closed transitions were detected by the half-amplitude threshold criterion. Open time histograms were fitted to multiple exponential functions by using the maximum likelihood method. Analysis was performed on 3–10 patches in which we succeeded in recording from 500 up to 1000 sweeps. To examine the role of individual amino acid residues in governing the participation of transmembrane segment IVS5 in inactivation and use-dependent block, we substituted each amino acid of the wild type α1 in the region where previously we identified a segment with a chimeric construct (HHT-5411) that is a determinant of inactivation (Fig. 1). By analyzing the macroscopic Ba2+ currents, we noticed in mutants I1338L and M1340L that the half-maximal voltage for activation (V0.5 act) was slightly but significantly shifted to negative potentials (Table I). The reversal potential (data not shown), and peak potential (data not shown), were not significantly affected by any of the mutations. There was, however, a slight but significant change in the slope factor (kact) for I1338L, M1340L, and HHT-5421 (Table I).Table IActivation and inactivation parameters of wild type and mutant calcium channelsActivationInactivationV0.5kactV0.5kinactInact. ratemVmVmVmVmsWild type12.3 ± 1.36.2 ± 0.2−7.6 ± 1.811.9 ± 0.51177.5 ± 93.3After drug−22.4 ± 1.39.0 ± 1.0NDI1338L6.5 ± 1.2*5.0 ± 0.3*−8.7 ± 1.56.9 ± 0.5*1196.7 ± 68.2After drug−15.8 ± 2.4*7.6 ± 0.4NDV1339F11.2 ± 0.85.7 ± 0.3−7.9 ± 1.17.4 ± 0.2*1143.5 ± 93.8After drug−22.9 ± 2.67.0 ± 0.5NDM1340L6.8 ± 0.8*5.5 ± 0.2*−7.7 ± 0.86.7 ± 0.3*1021.7 ± 36.9After drug−13.1 ± 0.5*7.8 ± 0.3NDL1341V9.4 ± 1.36.6 ± 0.22.4 ± 4.9*11.0 ± 0.71636.7 ± 175.9*After drug−16.2 ± 2.78.0 ± 0.7NDF1342M9.4 ± 1.75.6 ± 0.3−8.3 ± 0.68.1 ± 0.1*1604.5 ± 122.5*After drug−17.2 ± 0.6*7.0 ± 0.4NDHHT-54219.9 ± 1.24.6 ± 0.1*−0.4 ± 1.6*7.1 ± 0.3*3308.9 ± 336.4*After drug−7.8 ± 1.6*7.0 ± 0.4NDThe voltage dependence of activation was determined from I-V curves obtained by step depolarizations from a holding potential −80 mV to various test potentials.

On the other hand, we observed more widespread alterations in the inactivation properties of mutants. The V0.5 act of the steady-state inactivation drastically shifted to hyperpolarized potentials for L1341V and the HHT-5421 chimera. Also, the inactivation rate was significantly slower for L1341V, F1342M, and the HHT-5421 compared with the wild type. In the next set of experiments, we tested whether the alterations in inactivation properties of certain mutant channels correlated with the use dependence properties. Indeed, the reduced rate in current inactivation of HHT-5421 and L1341V was accompanied by a substantial reduction in use-dependent block of IBa by diltiazem during 80-ms steps at 0.5 Hz. On the contrary, mutation V1339F enhanced use-dependent block by diltiazem (and also by verapamil, data not shown) during low frequency pulse trains compared with wild type (WT) channel. The single phenylalanine to methionine substitution (F1342M) and the other two mutants, M1340L and I1338L in segment IVS5 of α1, induced similar use-dependent IBa inhibition by diltiazem compared with the wild type (Fig. 2, B and C). The voltage dependence of steady-state inactivation, induced by a 5-s prepulse, showed that WT, I1338L, V1339F, M1340L, and F1342M mutant channels are nearly completely inactivated at positive voltages (Table I). In contrast, the steady-state inactivation curves for HHT-5421 and L1341V exhibited a slowed rate of inactivation and also a residual current that appears associated with a loss of voltage dependence. The half-maximal voltage for inactivation (V0.5 inact) was shifted toward more positive potentials for mutant HHT-5421 (−0.4 ± 1.7 mV) and for L1341V (2.4 ± 4.9 mV) compared with that of the wild type channel (−7.6 ± 1.8 mV). The slope factor of the curve was not significantly affected for L1341V (11.0 ± 0.7 mV), but a change occurred for HHT-5421 (7.1 ± 0.3 mV) compared with the WT (11.9 ± 0.5 mV) (Fig. 3 A). These latter two mutant channels inactivated completely after diltiazem addition, and no sustained current remained at the end of the depolarizing pulse (Fig. 3 B). This observation indicates that the transition between the open state and inactivated state and/or the stability of the inactivated state are impaired by these mutations. The accumulation of channels in inactivation during a pulse train depends on how fast inactivation is removed between pulses. To provide a more detailed analysis of the role of channel inactivation in block development, we investigated the effects of the mutations on the time course of recovery from inactivation by employing a double pulse protocol at a holding potential −80 mV (Fig. 3 C). In general, IBa recovered to 80–90% of control within 28 s, whereas the remaining current did not recover within the 28-s period analyzed. The effect of diltiazem appeared in an overall slowing of the recovery time course in the WT and mutant channels. The recovery time courses in the absence of drug were similar for the WT (τ1 = 1655.3 ± 172.9 ms, n = 8) and mutant channels, I1338L, M1340L, and F1342M (see Table II), while HHT-5421 (τ1 = 541.6 ± 180.2 ms, n = 3) and L1341V (τ1 = 782.5 ± 231.9 ms, n = 8) recovered with a faster time course. The recovery of V1339F followed a slower time course than the WT when approximated with a single exponential. The tendency remained similar in the presence of diltiazem (Table II). Approximating the recovery by two exponentials gave more insight into the biphasic nature of the procedure. None of the mutations showed significant differences compared with the WT in the early faster pulse (τ1) of the recovery from inactivation when tested in the absence of drug. However, in the absence of drug, mutation V1339F recovered according to a slower τ2, while L1341V showed a τ2 faster than WT in the slow phase of recovery. This is in good agreement with that observed for the single exponential approximation. Addition of diltiazem drastically slowed the fast phase of recovery from inactivation for WT (τfast = 1531.2 ± 179.8 ms versus 70.4 ± 14.2 ms) and had a smaller, yet noticeable effect (5294.4 ± 673.4 ms versus 2066.1 ± 103.2 ms) on the slow phase of recovery. Mutants I1338L, V1339F, M1340L, L1341M, F1342M, and HHT-5421 recovered significantly faster than wild type in the fast phase (see Table II); however, this behavior was observed only for L1341V and HHT-5421 in the slow phase of recovery (Fig. 3 D).Table IITime constants of recovery from inactivation for wild type and mutants I1338L, V1339F, M1340L, L1341V, F1342M, and HHT-5421 in the absence and presence of 200 μm diltiazemτ1 one exp.no.τ1no.τ2msmsmsWild type1655.3 ± 172.9670.4 ± 14.262066.1 ± 103.2After drug2516.6 ± 294.171534.2 ± 179.875294.4 ± 673.4I1338L2123.0 ± 307.4365.1 ± 14.852132.4 ± 252.1After drug4137.3 ± 391.87163.0 ± 34.984798.6 ± 434.6V1339F2534.8 ± 265.5*875.6 ± 16.573092.6 ± 198.8*After drug6513.6 ± 404.8*5556.6 ± 82.6*47898.5 ± 509.5*M1340L2405.0 ± 450.6467.9 ± 21.942820.8 ± 628.8After drug3542.1 ± 290.17172.6 ± 28.874182.8 ± 227.8L1341V782.5 ± 231.9*752.6 ± 10.97905.3 ± 259.9*After drug1227.2 ± 179.3*5264.5 ± 26.1*52428.4 ± 499.9*F1342M2080.0 ± 446.3452.3 ± 8.542455.8 ± 514.6After drug3573.9 ± 290.610125.6 ± 31.8*94077.4 ± 345.2HHT-5421541.6 ± 180.2*3NDNDAfter drug1228.9 ± 187.7*689.4 ± 18.8*61814.4 ± 212.1**, p < 0.05.

If mutant channels enter the inactivated state from the open state more slowly than the wild type one can assume that these channels will display an increased mean open time compared with the wild type. To obtain further insight into the mechanism as to how the impaired inactivation is established in certain mutants, six of the IVS5 mutants and the wild type channel were analyzed for single channel properties as outlined under “Experimental Procedures.” Single channel recordings were performed in the cell-attached configuration mode with 110 mmBa2+ in the pipette and in the presence of 1 μm Bay K8644 in the recording bath solution. Representative traces of single channel recordings for five mutants and the wild type are depicted in Fig. 4,left. Open time distribution for wild type, V1339F, L1341V, HHT-5371, HHT-5411, HHT-5421 (Fig. 4, right), and F1342M (not shown) were optimally fit with two exponentials (20Yamaguchi H. Muth J.N. Varadi M.

Both fast and slow time constants for the open time distribution were slower for the chimeric mutant HHT-5411 (τfast = 2.70 ± 1.02 ms, τslow = 11.18 ± 1.49 ms) and HHT-5421 (τfast = 1.56 ± 0.29 ms, τslow = 14.92 ± 2.24 ms) at +30 mV compared with WT (τfast= 1.33 ± 0.09 ms, τslow = 5.19 ± 0.49 ms). Surprisingly, the mean open time constants for chimeric mutant HHT-5371 at +30 mV were faster (τfast = 1.05 ± 0.39 ms, τslow = 3.56 ± 0.74 ms) than WT (τfast = 1.33 ± 0.09 ms, τslow = 5.19 ± 0.49 ms); however, this channel had a high frequency of short re-openings throughout the depolarizing pulse. Despite the decreased use-dependent block (Fig. 2), the mean open time for HHT-5371 was also shorter at both +20- and +30-mV depolarizing pulses compared with the WT (Fig. 5 A, Table III). Interestingly, when valine was replaced with the more hydrophobic phenylalanine in mutant V1339F, the open time constants were shortened compared with the WT. This finding suggests crucial roles for size and hydrophobicity of the residue at position 1339 for inactivation. The single channel data for V1339F are supported by an enhanced use dependence and slowed recovery from inactivation. In contrast, substituting leucine for valine at position 1341 had diverse effects on single channel recordings that were anticipated from the reduced use-dependent block for diltiazem. These results are summarized in Table III. The longest open time was observed for the mutants HHT-5411 (6.45 ± 0.6 ms,n = 5) and HHT-5421 (11.17 ± 1.33 ms,n = 7), 123 and 261% of the wild type, respectively (Table III, Fig. 5 B). Thus, these mutants exhibited slowed inactivation from the open state (Fig. 5 B). These observations are also consistent with the data from the inactivation of macroscopic currents (Table I). The average latencies to the first opening for all mutants was similar to that of the wild type, suggesting that these mutation"
https://openalex.org/W1981729504,"Members of the Src family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases play a critical role in mesoderm formation in the frog, Xenopus laevis, acting as required mediators downstream of the fibroblast growth factor receptor. At least four members of this gene family, Src, Fyn, Yes, and Laloo, are expressed during early embryonic development. Ectopic expression of Laloo and Fyn, but not Src, induce mesoderm in ectodermal explants, indicating that these factors are non-redundant during early vertebrate development. Here we investigate the basis for the differential activity of the Src and Laloo kinases during mesoderm formation. We demonstrate that although both Src and Laloo physically interact with the substrate protein SNT-1/FRS2alpha only Laloo phosphorylates SNT-1, an event previously shown to be required for the activity of the latter and for mesoderm induction in vivo. We show that Src is enzymatically capable of stimulating mesoderm formation, as an activated Src construct both phosphorylates SNT-1 and induces mesoderm in explant cultures. However, a chimeric Laloo construct containing a Src C-terminal tail is inactive, suggesting that the early embryo contains a specific Laloo-activating, or Src-inactivating, factor. Finally, through further chimeric analysis, we provide evidence to suggest that differences in Laloo and Src activity are also mediated by the SH2, SH3, and kinase domains of these molecules."
