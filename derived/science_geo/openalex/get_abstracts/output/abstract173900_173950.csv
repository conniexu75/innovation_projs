https://openalex.org/W2108547322,"Higher order chromatin structure presents a barrier to the recognition and repair of DNA damage. Double-strand breaks (DSBs) induce histone H2AX phosphorylation, which is associated with the recruitment of repair factors to damaged DNA. To help clarify the physiological role of H2AX, we targeted H2AX in mice. Although H2AX is not essential for irradiation-induced cell-cycle checkpoints, H2AX −/− mice were radiation sensitive, growth retarded, and immune deficient, and mutant males were infertile. These pleiotropic phenotypes were associated with chromosomal instability, repair defects, and impaired recruitment of Nbs1, 53bp1, and Brca1, but not Rad51, to irradiation-induced foci. Thus, H2AX is critical for facilitating the assembly of specific DNA-repair complexes on damaged DNA."
https://openalex.org/W2159377455,"Experiments, theory, and simulation were used to study glass formation in a simple model system composed of hard spheres with short-range attraction (“sticky hard spheres”). The experiments, using well-characterized colloids, revealed a reentrant glass transition line. Mode-coupling theory calculations and molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the reentrance is due to the existence of two qualitatively different glassy states: one dominated by repulsion (with structural arrest due to caging) and the other by attraction (with structural arrest due to bonding). This picture is consistent with a study of the particle dynamics in the colloid using dynamic light scattering."
https://openalex.org/W1968554285,"Immunoglobulin (Ig) loci are selectively activated for transcription and rearrangement during B lymphocyte development. Using fluorescence in situ hybridization, we show that Ig heavy (H) and Igkappa loci are preferentially positioned at the nuclear periphery in hematopoietic progenitors and pro-T cells but are centrally configured in pro-B nuclei. The inactive loci at the periphery do not associate with centromeric heterochromatin. Upon localization away from the nuclear periphery in pro-B cells, the IgH locus appears to undergo large-scale compaction. We suggest that subnuclear positioning represents a novel means of regulating transcription and recombination of IgH and Igkappa loci during lymphocyte development."

We have examined whether the cell-surface adhesion molecule and hyaluronan receptor CD44 plays a role in resolving lung inflammation. CD44-deficient mice succumb to unremitting inflammation following noninfectious lung injury, characterized by impaired clearance of apoptotic neutrophils, persistent accumulation of hyaluronan fragments at the site of tissue injury, and impaired activation of transforming growth factor-beta1. This phenotype was partially reversed by reconstitution with CD44+ cells, thus demonstrating a critical role for this receptor in resolving lung inflammation."

 explains in her Perspective, at nanometer scale grain sizes this relation no longer holds. Atomistic simulations are providing key insights into the structural and mechanical properties of nanocrystalline metals, shedding light on the distinct mechanism by which these materials deform."
https://openalex.org/W2055125981,"We report the growth of binary colloidal crystals with control over the crystal orientation through a simple layer-by-layer process. Well-ordered single binary colloidal crystals with a stoichiometry of large (L) and small (S) particles of LS2 and LS were generated. In addition, we observed the formation of an LS3 superstructure. The structures formed as a result of the templating effect of the first layer and the forces exerted by the surface tension of the drying liquid. By using spheres of different composition, one component can be selectively removed, as is demonstrated in the growth of a hexagonal non-close-packed colloidal crystal."
https://openalex.org/W1996488588,"We show that reproductively mature male sea lampreys release a bile acid that acts as a potent sex pheromone, inducing preference and searching behavior in ovulated female lampreys. The secreted bile acid 7alpha,12alpha,24-trihydroxy-5alpha-cholan-3-one 24-sulfate was released in much higher amounts relative to known vertebrate steroid pheromones and may be secreted through the gills. Hence, the male of this fish species signals both its reproductive status and location to females by secreting a pheromone that can act over long distances."
https://openalex.org/W2064784013,"The adrenal steroid dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) has no known cellular receptor or unifying mechanism of action, despite evidence suggesting beneficial vascular effects in humans. Based on previous data from our laboratory, we hypothesized that DHEA binds to specific cell-surface receptors to activate intracellular G-proteins and endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS). We now pharmacologically characterize a putative plasma membrane DHEA receptor and define its associated G-proteins. The [3H]DHEA binding to isolated plasma membranes from bovine aortic endothelial cells was of high affinity (Kd = 48.7 pm) and saturable (Bmax = 500 fmol/mg protein). Structurally related steroids failed to compete with DHEA for binding. The putative DHEA receptor was functionally coupled to G-proteins, because guanosine 5′-O-(3-thio)triphosphate (GTPγS) inhibited [3H]DHEA binding to plasma membranes by 69%, and DHEA increased [35S]GTPγS binding by 157%. DHEA stimulated [35S]GTPγS binding to Gαi2 and Gαi3, but not to Gαi1 or Gαo. Pretreatment of plasma membranes with antibody to Gαi2 or Gαi3, but not to Gαi1, inhibited the DHEA activation of eNOS. Thus, DHEA receptors are expressed on endothelial cell plasma membranes and are coupled to eNOS activity through Gαi2 and Gαi3. These novel findings should allow us to isolate the putative receptor and reevaluate the physiological role of DHEA activity.

There are widespread data suggesting a beneficial effect of DHEA on vascular function. Extensive epidemiologic evidence shows an inverse correlation between circulating DHEA levels and the prevalence of atherosclerotic and cardiovascular diseases (1Barrett-Connor E. Khaw K.T. Yen S.S.

Atherosclerosis. 1996; 125: 1-13Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). There are few human intervention studies focused on vascular outcomes of DHEA administration, and these are not of a size or duration to define whether DHEA therapy has an effect on cardiovascular morbidity or mortality. Available studies do suggest a beneficial effect on atherosclerosis (6Herrington D.M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1995; 774: 271-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Studies of the short term effect of DHEA on human vascular function, using sophisticated assays of vascular function, are beginning to emerge. Williams et al. (7Williams M. Dawood T. Sudhir K. Komesaroff P. Proceedings of the 83rd Annual Meeting of the Endocrine Society, Denver, CO, June 20–23, 2001. The Endocrine Society, Denver2001Google Scholar) showed a significant increase in flow-mediated dilatation and systemic arterial compliance in postmenopausal women taking DHEA for 3 months. DHEA reduces atherosclerosis, decreases the accumulation of cholesterol in aortic and coronary arteries (8Gordon G.B. Bush D.E. Weisman H.F. J. Clin.

Sci. 1995; 774: 281-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) in various animal models. DHEA also affects growth factor-induced mitogenesis and proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (11Yoneyama A. Kamiya Y. Kawaguchi M. Fujinami T. Life Sci. 1997; 60: 833-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 12Furutama D. Fukui R. Amakawa M. Ohsawa N. Biochim. Biophys.

However, the molecular mechanisms by which DHEA acts to protect from atherosclerotic and cardiovascular diseases are still unknown. Furthermore, it is unclear whether the effect on vascular tissues is related to DHEA or to its metabolites, which include estradiol. Steroid hormones are known to bind specific intracellular receptors, which function as ligand-dependent gene transcription factors (14Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 451-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (2699) Google Scholar). However, previous efforts to isolate an intracellular receptor for DHEA have failed (15Meikle A.W. Dorchuck R.W.

In contrast to this classical pathway of steroid hormone action, there are also rapid, plasma membrane-dependent, non-genomic effects of steroids in various tissues, which lead to important physiological responses (19Lieberherr M. Grosse B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7217-7223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Wehling M. Neylon C.B. Fullerton M. Bobik A. Funder J.W. Circ.

Plasma membrane-associated receptors are postulated to mediate these non-genomic actions of steroids. Functional plasma membrane binding sites have been identified for several steroids, including estrogen, vitamin D, and progesterone (25Fiorelli G. Gori F. Frediani U. Franceschelli F. Tanini A.

Res. 2000; 87: 677-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). However, besides the receptor for estrogen, no plasma membrane steroid receptor has yet been unequivocally identified and characterized. We have found that DHEA stimulates nitric oxide (NO) generation within minutes from bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC). 2D. Liu and J. S. Dillon, unpublished data. Furthermore, DHEA conjugated to bovine serum albumin (BSA) had similar effects. These cellular responses to DHEA were specific and inhibited by pertussis toxin (PTX). Taken together, these results led to the hypothesis that DHEA activates NO production in endothelial cells by a specific, plasma membrane, G-protein-coupled receptor. The aim of this study was to determine whether there is a specific plasma membrane DHEA receptor, and to pharmacologically characterize that receptor. We show, for the first time, a specific, high affinity, DHEA binding site on the plasma membrane of BAEC. Specific DHEA binding to this site was saturable and reversible. We propose this distinct site of DHEA action as a novel DHEA receptor. In addition, we show that the putative DHEA receptor was functionally coupled to G-proteins of the Gαi2,3subtypes, which mediate the activation of endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS) by DHEA in BAEC. All tissue culture media and reagents were supplied by the Diabetes and Endocrinology Research Center of the University of Iowa. DHEA, DHEAS, and DHEA-17-carboxylmethyl oxime-BSA complexes were obtained from Steraloids (Newport, RI). 16α-Fluoro-5-androsten-17-one (fluasterone) was a gift from Dr. Arthur Schwartz (Temple University, Philadelphia, PA). Other steroids, chemical reagents, PTX, preimmune rabbit serum, IgG, protein A-Sepharose, DEAE glass fiber filters, and assay kits for plasma membrane and cytosolic markers were from Sigma. Radioisotopes and the chemiluminescence detection kit (ECL) were obtained fromAmersham Biosciences. The polyclonal rabbit antisera to Gαo and Gαi were supplied by Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), and antisera specific to Gαi1, Gαi2, and Gαi3 were purchased from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). Whatman GF/B filters were supplied by Fisher. Protein molecular weight markers, nitrocellulose transfer membranes, Dowex 50 WX-8 resin, and protein assay reagents were purchased from Bio-Rad. Bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) were kindly provided by Dr. Robert Bar (Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Iowa City, IA) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were provided by Dr. Arthur Spector (University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA). Both BAEC and HUVEC were grown in M199 medium supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 0.05 mg/ml streptomycin, and incubated at 37 °C in a 5% CO2, 95% air environment. The medium was changed every other day until the cells became confluent. Cells were serially passaged, after brief incubation with 0.25% trypsin-EDTA, and used at passages 4–8 in all experiments. Purified plasma membranes from BAEC were isolated by sucrose gradient centrifugation, as described previously (29Hokland B. Mendez A.J. Oram J.F. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 1335-1342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In some experiments, cytosolic fractions were prepared by differential centrifugation (30Chan T.M. Frampton G. Cameron J.S. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1993; 91: 110-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer in HES buffer (20 mmHEPES, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm benzamidine, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), and 1 μm each of pepstatin A, aprotinin, and leupeptin). Post-nuclear homogenates were collected following centrifugation at 200 × g for 2 min, and the microsomal aggregates were sedimented by centrifugation at 3,000 × g for 15 min. Plasma membranes from HUVEC, rat liver, heart, and kidney were isolated by sucrose gradient centrifugation (29Hokland B. Mendez A.J. Oram J.F. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 1335-1342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,31Trueba M. Ibarrola I. Ogiza K. Marino A. Macarulla J.M. J. Membr.

Plasma membrane purity and exclusion of cytosolic fraction were assessed with measurements of alkaline phosphatase, 5′-nucleotidase, and lactate dehydrogenase, using commercial kits. Protein was determined by the method of Lowry (33Lowry O. Rosebrough N. Farr A. Randall R. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using BSA as a standard. Plasma membranes, prepared as described above, were centrifuged for 30 min at 14,000 × g. The pellet was solubilized in buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.1 mm PMSF, 1 μm each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin A) for 1 h at 4 °C, with gentle stirring. The solubilized preparation was centrifuged at 110,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C. The supernatant and remaining pellet were collected for binding assays. Protein concentration was determined, and ∼65% of the membrane protein preparation was solubilized. The binding assay was performed at 4 °C using 25 μl (∼27,500 cpm, 60 μCi/nmol) of [3H]DHEA, 15 μl (8 μg) of plasma membrane fraction, and 210 μl of buffer (5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.6 mm EDTA, 120 μg of bacitracin, 0.1% BSA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). For saturation binding assays, concentrations of [3H]DHEA between 5 pm and 2 nm were added. For competitive binding studies, the displacement ligands were added at the concentrations noted in the figures. In parallel samples, an excess of unlabeled DHEA (10 μm) was added to determine the nonspecific binding. For PTX experiments, the plasma membranes were pre-incubated in 100 ng/ml PTX for 6 h prior to the addition of [3H]DHEA. The binding reaction was initiated by adding the plasma membranes and proceeded for 15 min, or as otherwise stated in the study of binding kinetics. At the end of the incubation period, duplicate 100-μl aliquots were rapidly filtered under vacuum through DEAE glass fiber filters in a 12-place filter manifold (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Filters were immediately washed four times with 1 ml of ice-cold binding buffer under vacuum. The filters were placed in vials and extracted with 5 ml of Biosafe N/A™ scintillation mixture (Research Products International, Mount Prospect, IL) overnight. The radioactivity of bound ligand retained on the filter was measured using a scintillation counter (Beckman Instruments, Fullerton, CA). Specifically bound [3H]DHEA was determined by subtracting the nonspecific binding from binding to the membranes incubated only with [3H]DHEA (total binding). Before experiments, all drugs were diluted in the binding buffer (100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.6 mm EDTA, 0.1% BSA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). The conditions for DHEA-stimulated [35S]GTPγS binding were optimized in preliminary experiments. Membranes were pelleted by centrifugation at 14,000 × g and 4 °C for 15 min and resuspended in binding buffer. The plasma membranes were pre-incubated in 100 ng/ml PTX for 6 h prior to the addition of [35S]GTPγS, for PTX experiments. [35S]GTPγS binding assay was performed at 25 °C in a total volume of 250 μl. Plasma membranes (8 μg of protein) were added in binding buffer containing 10 μmGDP and 0.5 nm [35S]GTPγS (∼11,000 cpm, 1,082 Ci/mmol). The incubation was carried out with gentle shaking for 30 min, in the absence or presence of 1 pm to 1 μm DHEA. Nonspecific binding was assayed by addition of 10 μm GTPγS and was less than 10% of total binding. After the incubation period, duplicate 100-μl aliquots were subjected to rapid filtration under vacuum through Whatman GF/B glass fiber filters, followed by three washes with 1 ml of ice-cold binding buffer. Bound radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting after overnight extraction of the filters in 4 ml of Biosafe N/A™ scintillation mixture. Specific binding data represent the difference between total binding and nonspecific binding. All assays were performed four times. Plasma membrane proteins (20 μg) were incubated for 25 min at 25 °C in assay buffer (250 μl) containing 5 nm [35S]GTPγS, 10 μm GDP, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.6 mm EDTA, 0.1% BSA, 100 μg/ml bacitracin, 0.1 mm PMSF, and 1 μm each of leupeptin, pepstatin A, and aprotinin. The reaction was initiated with 1 nm DHEA or vehicle and terminated after 25 min by adding 750 μl of ice-cold buffer containing 100 μm each of GDP and unlabeled GTPγS. Samples were then pelleted and resuspended in 200 μl of immunoprecipitation buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 μg/ml bacitracin, 0.1 mm PMSF, and 1 μm each of leupeptin, pepstatin A, and aprotinin. The mixtures were incubated at 4 °C, with gentle rotation, after addition of nonimmune serum or G-protein α-subunit-specific antisera (final dilutions: Go (1:200), Gi1 (1:500), Gi2 (1:500), and Gi3(1:500)). After 6 h, 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose (1 mg/ml) was added to each sample and the mixture incubated overnight at 4 °C with gentle mixing. The immunoprecipitates were collected following centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 2 min and washed three times in a buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 μm NaF, 50 mm sodium phosphate, 100 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and 0.1% SDS. The final pellets were boiled in 0.5% SDS, and the immunoprecipitated [35S]GTPγS-labeled G-proteins were counted in a scintillation counter. Nonspecific activity was determined in the presence of 50 μm unlabeled GTPγS. Twenty μg of BAEC plasma membrane proteins and molecular weight markers were separated by 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as described previously (34Miyamoto A. Laufs U. Pardo C. Liao J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19601-19608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The proteins were electrophoretically transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked at 25 °C for 1 h with 5% nonfat milk and 0.1% Tween 20 in Tris-buffered saline, and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with the following dilutions of specifically reacting rabbit polyclonal antisera: Gαo(1:400), Gαi1 (1:1,000), Gαi2 (1:1,000), and Gαi3 (1:1,000). The membranes were washed four times with Tris-buffered saline buffer containing 0.1% Tween 20 and then blocked for 10 min, prior to the addition of donkey anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase secondary antibody (1:10,000). Chemiluminescence reaction was performed before exposure to radiographic film. Endothelial NOS activity was determined by measuring the conversion ofl-[3H]arginine tol-[3H]citrulline, as previously described (34Miyamoto A. Laufs U. Pardo C. Liao J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19601-19608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 35Lantin-Hermoso R.L. Rosenfeld C.R. Yuhanna I.S. German Z. Chen Z. Shaul P.W. Am. J.

Briefly, purified plasma membranes were reconstituted in Hepes-buffered saline solution buffer (135 mm NaCl, 1.2 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 5.0 mm KOH, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm glucose, pH 7.4) supplemented with 100 μg/ml bacitracin, 0.1 mm PMSF, and 1 μm each of pepstatin A, leupeptin, and aprotinin. Plasma membranes (8 μg in a 100-μl volume) were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C with 1.5 μCi/ml l-[3H]arginine in the presence or absence of DHEA (1 nm), and citrulline production was measured. Studies were also performed in the presence of added calmodulin (5 units/ml), β-NADPH (2 mm/liter), tetrahydrobiopterin (2 μm/liter), flavin adenine dinucleotide (10 μm/liter), flavin mononucleotide (10 μm/liter), and CaCl2 in excess of EDTA (36Chambliss K.L. Yuhanna I.S. Mineo C. Liu P. German Z. Sherman T.S. Mendelsohn M.E. Anderson R.G. Shaul P.W. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: E44-E52Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For PTX experiments, the BAEC were pre-incubated in 100 ng/ml PTX for 6 h prior to isolation of the plasma membranes. In selected studies, plasma membranes were treated with DHEA (1 nm) or 17β-estradiol (10 nm) in the absence or presence of the estrogen antagonist ICI 182,780 (1 μm) for 15 min, without added calmodulin or enzyme cofactors. The reaction was terminated by the addition of HEPES buffer, pH 5.5, containing EDTA (5 mm/liter), and solutions were immediately applied to a column containing 2 ml of Dowex 50 WX-8 resin (Na+ form), added as a 1:1 slurry in water.l-[3H]Citrulline was then eluted with 2 ml of HEPES buffer. A sample of eluate in Biosafe N/A™ scintillation mixture was counted by liquid scintillation. Nonspecific activity was determined by the addition of excess l-arginine (10 μm) and represented ∼10% of total activity. Endothelial NOS activation by the known agonist bradykinin (1 μm) was also tested, as a positive control. In individual experiments, each treatment condition was determined in duplicate and all findings were repeated in four independent studies. In additional experiments, purified plasma membranes were preincubated with buffer alone, nonimmune rabbit IgG, or antibodies against Gαi1, Gαi2, or Gαi3(1:2,000). Endothelial NOS activation by DHEA (1 nm) or bradykinin (1 μm) was evaluated as outlined above. Binding data of [3H]DHEA were analyzed by nonlinear regression using the Prizm GraphPad program (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Affinity (Kd) and maximum binding capacity of [3H]DHEA were calculated from nonlinear curve fitting. Results were analyzed using a one-site model because this was superior to other models tested. All other data were subjected to one-way analysis of variance using the General Linear Model procedure of SAS®, and significant differences were subjected to Duncan's multiple comparison test at 5% probability. All values in each study were derived from at least three separate experiments and expressed as mean ± S.E. Plasma membrane fractions from BAEC were isolated by homogenization and sucrose gradient centrifugation as previously described (29Hokland B. Mendez A.J. Oram J.F. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 1335-1342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The activities of plasma membrane-specific enzymes, 5′-nucleotidase and alkaline phosphatase, were 13–15-fold higher in the plasma membrane preparations than in the post-nuclear homogenate (Table I). The activity of the cytosolic marker, lactate dehydrogenase, was negligible in the plasma membrane preparations compared with that in the postnuclear homogenate fractions. These data confirm that the plasma membrane samples had little contamination with non-membrane proteins.Table IMarker enzyme analysis of endothelial cell plasma membranesEnzymeHomogenatePlasma membranes5′-Nucleotidase (units/mg protein/min)0.4 ± 0.15.2 ± 0.2Alkaline phosphatase (units/mg protein)137 ± 82046 ± 71Lactate dehydrogenase (units/μg protein)1012 ± 1164 ± 3 Open table in a new tab The association kinetic data showed that the binding of [3H]DHEA to plasma membrane fractions occurred rapidly at 4 °C and pH 7.4 (Fig. 1), reaching a plateau at 5 min of incubation and remaining essentially stable for 90 min. To determine the affinity constant, we incubated each sample (8 μg of protein in 250 μl) with increasing concentrations of [3H]DHEA, from 5 pm to 2 nm in the absence or presence of 10 μm unlabeled DHEA. The saturation binding curve and Scatchard analysis of the data indicated a single high affinity membrane binding site, with aKd = 48.7 ± 4.6 pm and Bmax = 500.3 ± 8.7 fmol/mg protein (Fig.2).FIG. 2Saturation binding of [3H] DHEA to BAEC plasma membranes. BAEC plasma membranes (2 μg) were incubated with increasing concentrations of [3H]DHEA for 15 min in Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, at 4 °C. Aliquots of 100 μl, in duplicate, were rapidly filtered through Whatman DEAE glass fiber filters, washed five times with 1 ml of cold Tris-HCl buffer, placed in scintillation vials, and counted. Nonspecific binding, determined in the presence of 10 μm unlabeled DHEA, was below 10% of total binding at saturation. Specific binding represents total minus nonspecific binding. Data are representative of four different experiments. Inset shows a Scatchard analysis of [3H]DHEA binding to the BAEC membranes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To determine whether high affinity DHEA binding sites exist in tissues other than the vascular endothelium, we isolated plasma membranes from rat liver, kidney, and heart. There was no specific binding detected in rat kidney (Fig. 3). The binding activity was higher in heart than in liver, but was only 39.8 and 23.5%, respectively, of the specific binding activity observed in BAEC plasma membranes. Binding to the heart and liver plasma membranes reached saturation at 45 min of incubation and remained constant to 60 min (data not shown). These results suggest that the high affinity binding sites for DHEA are expressed in a differential tissue-specific manner and may not be expressed in all tissues. Furthermore, HUVEC plasma membranes express approximately the same degree of [3H]DHEA binding as do BAEC (616.3 ± 89.5 fmol/mg protein (HUVEC) versus 490.9 ± 45.2 fmol/mg (BAEC)). Thus, the ability of bovine vascular endothelial cells to bind DHEA is not species-specific. We determined the specificity of the [3H]DHEA binding sites in plasma membranes using unlabeled DHEA, or other related steroids, at concentrations from 1 pm to 1 μm. As shown in Fig.4, unlabeled DHEA inhibited binding of [3H]DHEA (0.1 nm) to plasma membranes in a concentration-dependent manner, with a complete inhibition at 1 μm. The monophasic competition binding curve suggests that [3H]DHEA interacts with a single population of binding sites in the plasma membrane preparations. Fluasterone had a very low affinity for the [3H]DHEA binding site, only slightly inhibiting the [3H]DHEA binding to plasma membranes. All other steroids tested, including DHEAS, 17α-hydroxypregnenolone, androstenedione, 17β-estradiol, and testosterone, failed to displace [3H]DHEA from its binding site at concentrations up to 1 μm, demonstrating that the plasma membrane binding site for [3H]DHEA was highly specific. We demonstrated previously2 that the DHEA-stimulated NO release from BAEC is plasma membrane-dependent and sensitive to PTX. This result, along with the above findings, suggests the possible coupling of putative membrane-bound DHEA receptors to G-proteins of the Gi/ofamily. To test this hypothesis, we examined the binding of [3H]DHEA to plasma membranes in the presence or absence of 50 μm GTPγS, a hydrolysis-resistant GTP analogue. As shown in Fig. 5A, the specific binding of [3H]DHEA to plasma membranes was reduced by 69% after preincubation with GTPγS for 30 min. These data showed that the binding of [3H]DHEA to membranes was sensitive to GTPγS, which indicates coupling of membrane-bound DHEA receptors to G-proteins. Consistent with our previous findings, pre-incubation of the plasma membranes with PTX inhibited specific [3H]DHEA binding by 85% (Fig. 5B). Ligand-regulated GTPγS binding to G-proteins is a sensitive method for examining the coupling of G-proteins to a receptor (37Wenzel-Seifert K. Arthur J.M. Liu H.Y. Seifert R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33259-33266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). To confirm that the putative DHEA receptors were coupled to G-proteins, we examined the effect of DHEA on [35S]GTPγS binding to G-proteins in plasma membranes. As shown in Fig. 6A, DHEA increased the specific binding of [35S]GTPγS by 157% over basal binding activity. Kinetic studies showed that DHEA stimulated specific [35S]GTPγS binding in a time-dependent manner, reaching maximum specific binding at 15 min (Fig. 6B). Specific binding declined to zero by 2 h of incubation (data not shown). The stimulation of [35S]GTPγS binding was dependent on DHEA concentration between 1 pm and 1 μm, with a maximal increase of 72% at 10 nm DHEA and an EC50 of 43 pm (Fig. 6C). There was no significant difference in DHEA-stimulated [35S]GTPγS binding between the 0.1, 1, and 10 nm DHEA concentrations. Pre-incubation of the plasma membranes with PTX reversed the DHEA-stimulated increase in [35S]GTPγS binding (Fig.6D). We solubilized membrane proteins with the nondenaturing detergent, Triton X-100 (1%), to investigate whether soluble DHEA receptors retain ligand binding affinity and functional coupling to G-proteins.

Although histones are one likely target for the enzymatic activity of eukaryotic Sir2 proteins, little is known about the substrates and roles of prokaryotic Sir2 homologs. We reveal that an archaeal Sir2 homolog interacts specifically with the major archaeal chromatin protein, Alba, and that Alba exists in acetylated and nonacetylated forms. Furthermore, we show that Sir2 can deacetylate Alba and mediate transcriptional repression in a reconstituted in vitro transcription system. These data provide a paradigm for how Sir2 family proteins influence transcription and suggest that modulation of chromatin structure by acetylation arose before the divergence of the archaeal and eukaryotic lineages."

We generated sur2-/- embryonic stem cells to analyze its function as a mammalian Mediator component. Our results show that Sur2 forms a subcomplex of the Mediator with two other subunits, TRAP/Med100 and 95. Knock-out of Sur2 prevents activation by E1A-CR3 and the mitogen-activated protein kinase-regulated ETS transcription factor Elk-1, but not by multiple other transcription factors. These results imply that specific activation domains stimulate transcription by binding to distinct Mediator subunits. Activation by E1A and Elk-1 requires recruitment of Mediator to a promoter by binding to its Sur2 subunit."

The biogenic silica mass accumulation rate was low during the relatively dry late Pleistocene, when the river flux of silica to the lake was suppressed. Millennial-scale fluctuations, due to upwelling intensity, in the late Pleistocene climate of the Lake Malawi basin appear to have been closely linked to the Northern Hemisphere climate until 11 thousand years ago. Relatively cold conditions in the Northern Hemisphere coincided with more frequent north winds over the Malawi basin, perhaps resulting from a more southward migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone."

The 8-kilometer-long body is highly variegated on a scale of 200 meters, exhibiting large albedo variations (0.01 to 0.03) and complex geologic relationships. Short-wavelength infrared spectra (1.3 to 2.6 micrometers) show a slope toward the red and a hot, dry surface (≤345 kelvin, with no trace of water ice or hydrated minerals), consistent with ∼10% or less of the surface actively sublimating. Borrelly's coma exhibits two types of dust features: fans and highly collimated jets. At encounter, the near-nucleus coma was dominated by a prominent dust jet that resolved into at least three smaller jets emanating from a broad basin in the middle of the nucleus. Because the major dust jet remained fixed in orientation, it is evidently aligned near the rotation axis of the nucleus."

The E6 protein of HPV 16 mediates the rapid degradation of p53, although this is not the only function of E6 and cannot completely explain its transforming potential. Previous work in our laboratory has demonstrated that transfection of HPV 16 E6 into the tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-sensitive LM cell line protects expressing cells from TNF-induced apoptosis in a p53-independent manner, and the purpose of this study was to determine the molecular mechanism underlying this protection. Caspase 3 and caspase 8 activation were significantly reduced in E6-expressing cells, indicating that E6 acts early in the TNF apoptotic pathway. In fact, E6 binds directly to TNF R1, as shown both by co-immunoprecipitation and mammalian two-hybrid approaches. E6 requires the same C-terminal portion of TNF R1 for binding as does TNF R1-associated death domain, and TNF R1/TNF R1-associated death domain interactions are decreased in the presence of E6. HA-E6 also blocked cell death triggered by transfection of the death domain of TNF R1. Together, these results provide strong support for a model in which HPV E6 binding to TNF R1 interferes with formation of the death-inducing signaling complex and thus with transduction of proapoptotic signals.

However, for most of these binding partners, the effect of the E6 interactions on the virus life cycle or its capacity to transform host cells is not well understood. Another area not yet well understood is the molecular mechanism(s) underlying the lack of a vigorous immune response to papillomavirus infections. Papillomaviruses are persistent viruses that remain in their hosts for long periods of time and elicit a weak or undetectable specific immune response and little or no inflammatory response. It may well be that one or more of the interactions between virus and cellular proteins contribute to this evasion of the host immune response. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is capable of inducing apoptosis of cells infected by some viruses (reviewed in Ref. 28Wong G.H.W. Kamb A. Goeddel D.V. Antiviral Properties of TNF. Raven Press, New York1992Google Scholar). Current understanding of molecular mechanisms responsible for TNF-mediated apoptosis begins with the binding of the trimeric TNF molecule to the 55-kDa TNF receptor 1 (TNF R1). This initiates interactions between TNF R1-associated death domain (TRADD) and Fas-associated death domain (FADD), which in turn interact with procaspase 8 (FLICE) to activate the caspase cascade, ultimately resulting in apoptosis (for reviews, see Refs. 23Kiyono T. Hiraiwa A. Fujita M. Hayashi Y. Akiyama T. Ishibashi M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11612-11616Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar, 24Nakagawa S. Huibregtse J. Mol. Cell.

The complex responsible for initiating this process is known as the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC). TNF does not induce apoptosis of every cell to which it binds; in fact, most cells are protected (29Shepard H.M. Lewis G.D. J. Clin. Immunol. 1988; 8: 333-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The reason for this is that TNF also triggers a separate, protective pathway involving activation of NF-κB transcription factor family members, which counteracts the cytolytic actions of TNF in many cells (30Beg A.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1996; 274: 782-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2933) Google Scholar, 31Van Antwerp D.J. Martin S.J. Kafri T. Green D.R. Verma I.M. Science. 1996; 274: 787-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (2447) Google Scholar). The effect of TNF on a given cell, therefore, is determined by the activity in both the proapoptotic and the prosurvival pathways. In previous work, we found that transfection of HPV 16 E6 into TNF-sensitive mouse fibroblast LM cells resulted in a blockade of TNF-induced apoptosis by a p53-independent mechanism (32Duerksen-Hughes P.J. Yang J. Schwartz S.B. Virology. 1999; 264: 55-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In this study, we tested the hypothesis that E6 mediates this apoptosis blockade by interacting with one or more proteins in pathways triggered by TNF signaling. We demonstrated that E6 interacts with TNF R1 and interferes with its capacity to bind TRADD and to transmit a proapoptotic signal. These findings provide a mechanistic explanation for the capacity of E6 to protect cells from TNF-triggered cell death and also suggest that papillomaviruses have developed a way to evade this arm of the host immune system. Lyophilized human recombinant TNF-α (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), was dissolved into serum-free minimal essential medium to yield a 1 μg/ml stock, aliquoted, and stored at −80 °C until use. 3-[4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) (Sigma) was dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline to yield a 5 mg/ml stock and stored at 4 °C until use. Mitomycin C (Sigma) was dissolved in Me2SO to yield a 5 mg/ml stock and stored at 4 °C until use. Cycloheximide (Sigma) was prepared as a 5 mg/ml stock and stored in aliquots at −20 °C prior to use. C2-ceramide (Biomol, Plymouth Meeting, PA) was dissolved in Me2SO to yield a 25 mm stock solution and stored at −20 °C prior to use. Anti-HA was obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. LM (mouse fibroblast), U2OS (human osteosarcoma), U937 (human histiocyte/monocyte), and NIH3T3 (mouse fibroblast) cells were obtained from the ATCC (Manassas, VA). LME6 cells were derived by co-transfection of LM cells with pSV2neo an pSG16E6, which encodes the E6 gene from HPV 16 (32). LM and NIH3T3 cells were cultured in minimal essential medium (Invitrogen). LME6 cells were cultured in minimal essential medium containing G418 (800 μg/ml) (Invitrogen). U937 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640, and U20S cells were cultured in McCoy's 5A medium (Invitrogen). All culture medium was supplemented to contain 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). pSV2neo contains a gene for G418 resistance (33Southern P.J. Berg P. J. Mol. Appl. Genet. 1982; 1: 327-341PubMed Google Scholar). pSG5 is a eukaryotic constitutive expression vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) that includes the early region SV40 promoter for in vivo expression and the T7 promoter for in vitrotranscription. pSG16E6 (a gift from Lamonis Laimins, Northwestern University Medical School, Chicago, IL) is derived from pSG5 and incorporates the wild-type sequence from the E6 gene of HPV type 16. A plasmid expressing epitope-tagged HPV 16 E6 was generated by first inserting the cytomegalovirus promoter (from pC1 neo, Promega, Madison, WI) into the BglII-EcoRI site of the promoterless plasmid pEGFP-1 (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). The PCR product of E6 (derived from plasmid pSG16E6) was then cloned into HA tag Bluescript KS in both the sense and antisense orientations, and the sense and antisense versions of HA-E6 were then cloned into the pEGFP-1 plasmid by exchange with enhanced green fluorescent protein at theXhoI-NotI site. The resulting plasmids then had the HA epitope tag appended to the N terminus of E6 in either the sense (pHA-E6 S) or the antisense orientation (pHA-E6 AS). The pNF-κB-luciferase plasmid (pNFκB-Luc) includes the consensus sequence for NF-κB binding fused to the sequence encoding firefly luciferase (Stratagene). pE-CMV-SEAP was constructed by exchanging the green fluorescent protein reporter gene from plasmid pEGFP-1 (CLONTECH) with the gene encoding secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) from the plasmid pSEAP-enhancer (CLONTECH). The SEAPXhoI-XbaI fragment was cloned into the pEGFP-1XhoI-NotI site after blunting the XbaI and NotI sites using the Klenow fragment. The cytomegalovirus promoter was cloned from pC1-neo (Promega) (BglII-EcoRI) into theBglII-EcoRI site of the pE-SEAP plasmid. The gene encoding the death domain of human TNF R1 (gift of Carl Ware, La Jolla Institute for Allergy and Immunology) was cloned into theHindIII site of the pVP16 plasmid from the Mammalian Two-Hybrid System (CLONTECH) in frame with the activation domain. This plasmid, pVPTNF R1 DD, codes for amino acids 185–456 and was used to test the binding of E6 and TRADD to the TNF R1 death domain. Removal of the SacII-XbaI fragment, coding for the C-terminal 41 amino acids and including the putative E6 binding site, created a plasmid coding for a truncated version of the TNF R1 death domain (amino acids 185–415; pVP TNF R1 Δ DD). Human TRADD (gift from Carl Ware, La Jolla Institute for Allergy and Immunology) and E6 (PCR product as described above) were cloned into the pM plasmid from the CLONTECH Mammalian Two-Hybrid System to generate pMTRADD and pME6, respectively. Transfections were carried out using Fugene VI (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), as directed by the manufacturer. For transient transfections, cells were analyzed 48 h post-transfection. For stable transfections, clones were passaged into selection medium containing G418 (500 μg/ml) 72 h post-transfection. Individual clones were selected, grown, and analyzed for protein expression by immunoblotting. To measure cell survival following TNF treatment, cells were seeded into 96-well plates (1 × 104 cells/well) and allowed to adhere overnight. TNF (final concentration of 1 or 5 ng/ml) was then added in the presence or absence of cycloheximide (final concentration as noted for individual experiments), and the cells were incubated for 16 h prior to measuring the number of viable cells by the MTT assay (described below). To determine the ability of cells to accumulate increased levels of p53 following DNA damage, cells were treated with mitomycin C and assayed for the resulting p53 levels. Cells were seeded into 24-well plates (1 × 105 cells/well) and allowed to adhere overnight. Approximately 24 h later, mitomycin C was added to a final concentration of 10 μg/ml medium. 16 h later, cells were harvested, and the lysates were analyzed for p53 by ELISA (described below). To determine cell survival following ceramide treatment, cells were seeded into 96-well plates (2 × 104 cells/well, 50 μl total volume) and allowed to adhere overnight. For the adherent U2OS cells, the medium was then removed and replaced with medium supplemented to contain 2% serum. For the U937-derived cells (suspension), serum-free medium was added to each well to yield a final serum concentration of 2% (total volume of 250 μl). Ceramide was then added to the indicated final concentration, and cells were incubated for 16 h prior to measurement of the number of viable cells by the MTT assay. The cell death detection ELISA (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was used to measure mono- and oligonucleosomes in the cytoplasmic fraction of cell lysates according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cell lysates were added to wells to which the anti-histone antibody had been fixed adsorptively. Nucleosomes in the sample bound via their histone components to the immobilized anti-histone antibody. Anti-DNA peroxidase, which binds to the DNA portion of the nucleosomes, was then added. The amount of bound peroxidase was determined photometrically by measuring absorbance at 405 nm after the addition of 2,2′-azino-di(3-ethylbenzthiazolin sulfonate) as substrate. Each point was measured in triplicate, and results were normalized to the untreated control. Because the different cell lines each displayed different levels of background cell death, this normalization provided a better comparison between the lines. Two different versions of the MTT assay were used: one for adherent cells (LM and U2OS-derived cells) and one for suspension cells (U937-derived cells). For adherent cells, the incubation medium was removed and exchanged for 80 μl of fresh medium. 20 μl of MTT was then added (5 mg/ml stock), and cells were incubated at 37 °C for 3 h. The medium was removed, and 150 μl of Me2SO was added and allowed to incubate for 10 min. The solution was mixed by pipetting, and the absorbance of each well was determined at 490 nm. For suspension cells, plates were centrifuged (1000 rpm for 10 min) to pellet the cells near the bottom of the wells. The top 240 μl of medium was removed, leaving 60 μl/well, and 15 μl of MTT (5 mg/ml stock) was added. The cells were incubated at 37 °C for 3 h. Two volumes (150 μl) of isopropyl alcohol/HCl (400 μl of HCl plus 100 ml of isopropanol) was added, and the cells were incubated for 10 min. The solution was mixed by pipetting, and the absorbance of each well was determined at 490 nm. Cells (2 × 106) were lysed in 100 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 1 μm dithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). One tablet of protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) per 10 ml of buffer was added just prior to use. The protein concentration in cleared lysates was measured using the BCA assay (Pierce). Lysates (40 μg/lane) were subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon P membranes (Millipore Corp.). After treating membranes with 5% nonfat milk or 1% BSA, rat anti-HA peroxidase-conjugated antibodies (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) were applied (1:500 dilution or 0.05 μg/ml in TBST (50 mmTris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Tween 20)). After incubation with rocking (room temperature, 2 h), membranes were washed with TBST. Detection of HA-E6 protein was performed using the chemiluminescent SuperSignal West Femto or Pico Maximum Sensitivity substrate (Pierce). To detect TNF R1, membranes were probed with monoclonal anti-TNF R1 (H-5) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), diluted at 1:1000 in TBST plus 1% BSA, followed by ImmunoPure Antibody (anti-mouse) conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Pierce). Detection of the truncated TNF R1 death domain fused to VP16 was achieved using monoclonal anti-VP16 (14-5) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as the primary antibody (1:300 dilution in TBST plus 1% BSA) and ImmunoPure Antibody (anti-mouse) conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Pierce) as the secondary antibody. Cells (2–5 × 106) were lysed in 500 μl of lysis buffer, and cleared lysates were incubated with 2 μg of either monoclonal anti-HA antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) or anti-p53 (DO-7) antibody (Novacastra Laboratories) at 4 °C for 1 h with rotation. Protein A-agarose slurry (50 μl) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added to each lysate, and lysates were incubated for 3 h at 4 °C. The protein A slurry was then washed three times with lysis buffer, followed by one wash with high salt buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 1 μm dithiothreitol) and one wash with buffer lacking NaCl. The precipitates were fractionated by 12% SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotting was performed as described above. The reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction was used to analyze the U2OS and U2OSE617 cell lines for the presence of message coding for E6. 3.5 μg of total RNA was isolated from each cell line and used as a template. cDNA was synthesized using SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and an oligo(dT) primer (Amersham Biosciences). Primers for the 5′ and 3′ ends of E6 (5′-GCACCAAAAGAGAACTGCAATGT-3′ and 5′-TGGGTTTCTCTACGTGTTCTTGAT-3′) were used to amplify the 468-nucleotide PCR product for the E6 cDNA, using one-twentieth of the total cDNA reaction mixture. To control for possible contamination by genomic DNA, parallel reactions were run using 0.175 μg of total RNA in the absence of the reverse transcriptase enzyme. Reaction mixtures were separated on a 4.5% NuSieve GTG-agarose gel (FMC BioProducts). Cells were assayed for p53 by ELISA as described previously (34Yang J. Duerksen-Hughes P. Carcinogenesis. 1998; 19: 1117-1125Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mmNa2HPO4, 17 mmNaH2PO4, 68 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, pH 7.4, with 1% aprotinin added before use), and lysates were stored at −80 °C for no more than 1 week prior to analysis. Monoclonal antibody pAB122 (hybridoma obtained from ATCC; antibodies were purified from the culture medium using protein A-Sepharose) was used as the primary or capture antibody, biotinylated anti-p53 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was used as the detection antibody, and glutathione S-transferase-p53 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used as a standard. Each sample was measured in triplicate, and the results were normalized to the amount of protein present in each sample. Protein concentration was determined by the bicinchoninic acid assay (BCA assay) (Pierce). Cells (LM, LME6, U2OS, or U2OSE612) were plated onto 100-mm plates at a density of 2–5 × 106 cells/plate and incubated overnight. TNF (1 ng/ml for LM and LME6 cells; 5 ng/ml for U2OS and U2OSE612 cells) was added, along with cycloheximide (5 μg/ml) in the case of the U2OS and U2OSE612 cells. Cells were harvested by trypsinization at designated intervals and lysed in 160 μl of Caspase 3 Lysis Buffer (Sigma). Protein concentrations were measured using the BCA method (Pierce). Caspase 3 activity was measured using the Caspase 3 Colorimetric Assay Kit (Sigma) as directed by the manufacturer. Cell lysates (20 μl for the LM and LME6 cells; 25 μl for the U2OS and U2OSE612 cells) were incubated with substrate (Ac-DEVD-pNA) in the presence or absence of the caspase 3 inhibitor Ac-DEVD-CHO. Absorbance at 405 nm was determined ∼3 h following initiation of the reaction. The activity in wells treated with inhibitor was subtracted from the activity in untreated wells, and the activity was normalized to the amount of protein present in each sample. Caspase 3 activity in treated samples was expressed as a percentage of caspase 3 activity in the untreated parental cells. Three plates of treated and untreated cells were measured for each time point. Caspase 8 activity was measured using the Caspase 8 Assay Kit (Calbiochem) according to the manufacturer's instructions, using 50 μl of cell lysate per well, using IETD-pNA as the colorimetric substrate, and in the presence or absence of the caspase 8 inhibitor Ac-IETD-CHO. Absorbance at 405 nm was determined ∼6 h following initiation of the reaction, and calculations were performed as described for the caspase 3 assay. U2OSE612 cells (5 × 106) were either untreated or treated with TNF (5 ng/ml) plus cycloheximide (5 μg/ml) and lysed using 500 μl of lysis buffer. Cleared lysates were incubated with 2 μg of monoclonal anti-HA antibody or DO-7 anti-p53 antibody for 1 h at 4 °C with rotation. Protein A-agarose slurry (50 μl) was added to each lysate, and lysates were incubated for 3 h. Each sample was washed three times with the lysis buffer, followed by one wash with high salt buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 1 μm dithiothreitol) and one wash with the high salt buffer lacking NaCl. The precipitates were fractionated by 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a membrane, and TNF R1 was detected by immunoblot using monoclonal anti-TNF R1 antibodies. The mammalian two-hybrid binding assay was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (CLONTECH). cDNAs encoding E6, TRADD, the C-terminal region of TNF R1 (990–1541 bp, including the death domain), and fragment 990–1414 bp of the TNF R1 were cloned into the pVP16 and pM vectors. The indicated combinations of vectors were then transfected into U2OS cells (5 × 105/well, six-well plates) along with the CAT-expressing reporter plasmid using FuGene VI (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as directed by the manufacturer. 48 h following transfection, CAT activity was measured colorimetrically using a commercially available CAT-ELISA kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as directed by the manufacturer. The electrophoretic mobility shift assay for NF-κB activation was performed as described previously (35Connolly J.L. Rodgers S.E. Clarke P. Ballard D.W. Kerr L.D. Tyler K.L. Dermody T.S. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 2981-2989Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 36Connolly J.L. Barton E.S. Dermody T.E. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 4029-4039Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). LM and LME6 cells (5 × 106) grown in 75-ml tissue culture flasks were either untreated or treated with TNF (1 ng/ml) and incubated for 16 h. Nuclear extracts were prepared, and 10 μg of nuclear extract protein was incubated with a 32P-labeled oligonucleotide consisting of the NF-κB consensus binding sequence (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) (0.5 μg) at 4 °C for 20 min. Nucleoprotein complexes were subjected to electrophoresis on native 5% polyacrylamide gels, dried under vacuum, and exposed to Biomax MR film (Eastman Kodak Co.). For the reporter gene assay, cells (4 × 104/well) were plated onto 24-well plates and allowed to adhere overnight. Cells were then cotransfected with pNF-κB-luciferase and pE-CMV-SEAP (for normalization of transfection efficiency) using Fugene 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's protocol. 48 h post-transfection, the culture medium was changed, and TNF (2 ng/ml) was added to half the wells. Medium was again changed 16 h following TNF treatment. SEAP activity was measured in 20 μl of conditioned media using a commercially available assay kit (CLONTECH) following 2 h of SEAP secretion. The cells were then lysed, and the level of luciferase expression in cell lysates was determined using the Luciferase Assay System (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 100 μl of lysis buffer (supplied with kit). Prepared Luciferase Assay Substrate (50 μl) was then mixed with 20 μl of cell lysate, and the luminescent signal was measured using a Turner luminometer. The level of luciferase expression was normalized to the level of SEAP activity and reported as a percentage of the activity in untreated cells. Our laboratory has previously shown that TNF-sensitive, mouse fibroblast LM cells are protected from TNF-induced cell death by the HPV 16 E6 protein in a p53-independent manner (32Duerksen-Hughes P.J. Yang J. Schwartz S.B. Virology. 1999; 264: 55-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In contrast to the LM cells, NIH3T3 mouse fibroblast cells must be treated with cycloheximide or actinomycin D to become sensitive to TNF. To determine whether E6 can protect NIH3T3 cells as well from TNF-induced apoptosis, NIH3T3 cells were co-transfected with pSV2neo and either the empty plasmid pSG5 or the E6-encoding plasmid pSG16E6. Pools of stably transfected cells were selected and either untreated or treated with TNF and/or cycloheximide. The extent of apoptosis was assessed using the Cell Death ELISA (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) (Fig. 1). The results demonstrate that cells transfected with pSG16E6 are protected from treatment with TNF and cycloheximide in comparison with those transfected with the empty plasmid. To provide further evidence for the protective effects of E6 and to obtain sets of stably transfected, clonal human cell lines for further study, we transfected a plasmid encoding epitope-tagged E6 (HA-E6) into the human U937 cell line (histiocyte/monocyte). An epitope-tagged, antisense version of E6 was used as a negative control. Following sele"

Integrins are heterodimeric cell surface receptors that mediate cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix (ECM)1 interactions and have been involved in the regulation of cell growth, migration, survival, and metastasis (1Hughes P.E. Pfaff M. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 359-364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 2Aplin A.E. Howe A.K. Juliano R.L. Curr. Opin.

Eight integrin β subunits and 17 α subunits have been identified to date, and these can form more than 20 distinct heterodimers (4Plow E.F. Haast T.A. Zang L. Loftus J. Smith J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21785-21788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1112) Google Scholar). Integrin affinity and avidity are modulated by intracellular signaling cascades (“inside-out” signaling), leading to changes in adhesion and motility. Conversely, binding of integrins to ECM proteins elicits signals that are transduced into the cell (“outside-in” signaling) to regulate cell growth, migration, and survival. Integrins are central components of focal adhesions, in which they associate with cytoskeleton-associated proteins such as vinculin, talin, and paxillin, and signaling molecules such as focal adhesion kinase and integrin-linked kinase (3Giancotti F.G. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1999; 285: 1028-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (3807) Google Scholar, 5Hemler M.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). A number of intracellular signaling pathways have been involved in the regulation of integrin adhesive functions, including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and the small GTP-binding proteins of the Ras and Rho families (1Hughes P.E. Pfaff M. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 359-364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 6Kolanus W. Seed B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 725-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Among the proteins implicated in inside-out signaling, protein kinase C (PKC) has been found in many instances to play a crucial role in modulating integrin-mediated cell adhesion, spreading, and migration. However, the mechanism of action of PKC in these events remains elusive. PKC is a family of cofactor-dependent serine/threonine kinases involved in the transduction of various biological signals such as proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and migration (7Newton A.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar, 8Mochly-Rosen D. Gordon A.S. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar, 9Jaken S. Parker P.J. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 245-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Twelve PKC isoforms have been identified so far. They have been divided into three subfamilies based on their cofactor requirements for full activation. Conventional PKCs, α, β1, β2, and γ, require Ca2+, diacylglycerol, and phospholipids such as phosphatidylserine for full activation. Novel PKCs, δ, ε, η, θ, ν, and μ, are Ca2+-independent. Atypical PKCs, ι and ζ, are both Ca2+- and diacylglycerol-independent. Several lines of evidence indicate a critical role for PKC in integrin-mediated events. PKC activity is required for adhesion, spreading, migration, and focal adhesion and actin stress fiber assembly on various ECM substrates (10Woods A. Couchman J.R. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 101: 277-290Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21459-21462Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Lewis J.M. Cheresh D.A.

In addition to its role in focal adhesion formation, PKC activation induces the translocation of focal adhesion kinase and proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2 to focal adhesions and their tyrosine phosphorylation in various cell systems (11Vuori K.

In some reports, the identity of the PKC isoform involved in integrin-mediated processes has been investigated. It appears that depending on the cell type, different PKC isoforms are involved in the regulation of integrin function (16Harrington E.O. Loffler J. Nelson P.R. Kent K.C. Simons M. Ware J.A. J. Biol.

For example, in breast carcinoma cells, an interaction between integrin β1 and PKCα was demonstrated, and overexpression of PKCα stimulated β1-dependent migration by facilitating integrin β1 endocytosis and recycling to the plasma membrane (20Ng T.

Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1147-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). For instance, epidermal growth factor-induced integrin-mediated migration was dependent on PKC activity (22Klemke R.L. Yebra M. Bayna E.M. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 859-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 23Rabinovitz I. Toker A. Mercurio A.M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1147-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), illustrating the role of PKC in inside-out signaling cascades. However, despite considerable evidence describing the importance of PKC in integrin-mediated events, the mechanism by which PKC regulates these processes remains poorly understood. A means of PKC regulation is through their association with targeting proteins, providing a tight control of PKC subcellular localization and substrate specificity (8Mochly-Rosen D. Gordon A.S. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar, 9Jaken S. Parker P.J. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 245-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). One such protein, RACK1 (Receptor for ActivatedC-Kinase 1), specifically binds to activated PKC (24Mochly-Rosen D. Khaner H. Lopez J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3997-4000Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar, 25Ron D. Chen C.H. Caldwell J. Jamieson L. Orr E. Mochly-Rosen D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

RACK1 associates with other signaling proteins such as phospholipase Cγ1 (26Disatnik M.H. Hernandez-Sotomayor S.M.T. Jones G. Carpenter G. Mochly-Rosen D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1999; 274: 14909-14917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). RACK1 binding to the type I interferon receptor was required for the recruitment and activation of STAT1 by the receptor (28Croze E. Usacheva A. Asarnow D. Minshall R.D. Perez H.D. Colamonici O. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 5127-5132Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 29Usacheva A. Smith R. Minshall R. Baida G. Seng S. Croze E. Colamonici O.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22948-22953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). RACK1 was found to interact with Src family kinases and to inhibit their kinase activity; and RACK1 overexpression inhibited Src activity and cell proliferation (30Chang B.Y. Conroy K.B. Machleder E.M. Cartwright C.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3245-3256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Chang B.Y. Chiang M. Cartwright C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20346-20356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). RACK1 was constitutively bound to the common β chain of the interleukin-5/interleukin-3/granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptors and allowed the recruitment of PKCβ to the receptor after interleukin-5 or PMA stimulation (32Geijsen N. Spaargaren M. Raaijmakers J.A.M. Lammers J.W.J. Koenderman L. Coffer P.J. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5126-5130Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Thus, RACK1 may act as a scaffold or anchoring protein that regulates the localization of various signaling enzymes to specific subcellular compartments, to allow the formation of signaling complexes. Recently, RACK1 was found to interact with the membrane proximal region of the cytoplasmic tail of integrins β1, β2, β3, and β5, and RACK1-integrin binding was found to be dependent on the presence of PMA, suggesting the involvement of PKC in this interaction (33Liliental J.

Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1691-1698Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the functional significance of the interaction between RACK1 and integrins and the possible involvement of PKC in this interaction have not been investigated. Migration and invasion of glioma cells, leading to tumor recurrence, are a major cause of mortality in glioma patients (35Holland E.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6242-6244Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar); however, the mechanism that these cells utilize to migrate is poorly understood. We have shown previously that U251N glioma cells express the PKC isoforms α, δ, ε, η, μ, and ζ, and that PKCα controls cell cycle progression and proliferation (36Besson A. Yong V.W. Mol. Cell.

PKCε activation induces focal adhesion, lamellipodia formation, and integrin clustering. Moreover, we provide novel evidence of an interaction between PKCε and integrin β chains through the scaffolding protein RACK1 to regulate integrin-mediated adhesion and motility. The cDNA for human PKCε was from ATCC (80050); cDNAs for human PKCα and human RACK1 were obtained from Dr. G. Finkenzeller (Institut für Molekulare Medizin, Freiburg, Germany) and Dr. D. Chang (UCLA, Los Angeles), respectively. PMA, bisindolylmaleimide I, calphostin C, rabbit anti-PKCα antibodies (662–672), poly-l-lysine, laminin, vitronectin, and fibronectin were from Calbiochem. Rabbit anti-PKCζ antibodies were from Invitrogen. Monoclonal antibodies to integrin α2 (mAb 1950Z), α5 (mAb1956Z), αv (mAb1953Z), β1 (mAb1951Z), and polyclonal antibodies to integrin b5 (Ab1926), and b1 (Ab1952) were from Chemicon. Rabbit anti-PKCη (C-15), ε (C-15), and μ (d-20) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Rabbit anti-PKCδ antibodies were a gift from N. Groome (Oxford, UK). The monoclonal antibody to vinculin (hVIN-1) and the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide thiazolyl blue (MTT) were from Sigma. Monoclonal antibodies to PKCα (clone 3), PKCε (clone 21), focal adhesion kinase (clone 77), RACK1 (clone 20, IgM), and integrin β1 (clone 18) were from BD Transduction Laboratories. Secondary antibodies used in this study were from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories with the exception of goat anti-mouse Alexa 488 and goat anti-rabbit Alexa 488 antibodies, which were from Molecular Probes. The U251N human glioma cell line and culture conditions have been described previously (36Besson A. Yong V.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4580-4590Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Stable transfections were performed using the calcium phosphate method; after selection, clones were isolated with cloning rings. Stably transfected cells were kept at all times in the presence of 400 μg/ml G418 (Calbiochem). As20 and As27, and Es1 and Es10 are clones stably overexpressing PKCα and PKCε, respectively. The PKC cDNAs were inserted in the pBKRSV vector (Invitrogen), in which the lacpromoter has been deleted, as recommended by the manufacturer, to allow high expression levels under the control of the RSV promoter. For antisense studies, the PKCε cDNA was cloned in antisense orientation in a pREP9 episomal vector (Invitrogen), and the RACK1 cDNA was inserted in antisense orientation in a pcDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen). The truncated form of RACK1 (amino acids 204–317) was obtained by PCR from the full-length cDNA using the following primers: sense, ATTATGGGATCCCTCTGTGCTTCTGGA; antisense, GCGGCCGCCAGAGAGATGGAT. The PCR product was cloned into the pTARGET vector (Promega). Transient transfections were performed using the FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as described by the manufacturer, for 24 h before the experiment. The plasmid pTracer (Invitrogen), encoding the green fluorescent protein, was used to monitor transient transfection efficiency. The appropriate empty vector-transfected cells were used as control cells in each experiment. Cells were seeded at 80% confluence in 60-mm dishes and grown for an additional 24 h. A linear scratch, ∼1 cm wide, was performed using a rubber policeman across the diameter of the plate. The plate was then rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and refed with growth medium supplemented (or not) with the appropriate activator or inhibitor. Cells were incubated for a given time, rinsed with PBS, and fixed 10 min in 95% ethanol and 5% acetic acid at room temperature. Fixed dishes were then stained with hematoxylin overnight and rinsed with dideoxy H2O. For each plate, pictures were taken on an inverted microscope (Olympus) at a magnification of ×50. The distance migrated from the scratch line by the cells at each time point was then measured (in mm) on the prints. The migratory capacity of cells was also evaluated using Boyden chambers. 15,000 cells were plated into 8-μm pore size modified Boyden chambers. Cells were allowed to migrate for 16 h, fixed, and stained as described above. The cells that migrated to the bottom chambers were counted under the microscope, and the numbers displayed in the text represent an average from six different fields. The subcellular fractionation was performed as described previously (36Besson A. Yong V.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4580-4590Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). All other cell lysates were prepared in immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Tween 20, 1% Nonidet P-40; complemented with 1 mmdithiothreitol, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cells were scraped from the plates, lysed on ice for 30 min, and homogenized. Cellular debris were eliminated by centrifugation for 10 min at 10,000 rpm. The protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay, and the indicated amount of protein was loaded for SDS-PAGE on 12% gels. Proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon; Millipore) for 3 h at 250 mA at 4 °C. Membranes were blocked in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 10% milk for 1 h. Membranes were incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C, and with secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. All antibodies were diluted in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 3% milk, except for the 4G10 antibody, which was diluted in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 5% bovine serum albumin. ECL (AmershamBiosciences) was used for immunodetection. Cell lysates were prepared as described above for Western blotting. For each immunoprecipitation, 4 μg of the appropriate antibody, 300 μg of proteins, and 30 μl of protein A/G-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were incubated for 3 h at 4 °C. For control immunoprecipitations, the primary antibody was replaced by a goat anti-mouse IgG + IgM (H+L). In the case of mouse IgM anti-RACK1 antibodies, 5 μg of goat anti-mouse IgG + IgM (H+L) was added to allow binding of the IgM to the beads. Immunoprecipitates were rinsed three times in immunoprecipitation buffer. The immunoprecipitates were subjected to Western blotting as described above. Cells were grown on glass coverslips for 24 h before treatment. After the appropriate treatment, cells were rinsed in PBS and fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde at 37 °C for 20 min. Coverslips were stored in PBS at 4 °C until stained. Cells were permeabilized for 3 min in 0.2% Triton-X100, rinsed three times in PBS, and incubated for 1 h with primary antibodies diluted in antibody dilution buffer (PBS complemented with 3% bovine serum albumin, 0.05% Tween 20, and 0.08% sodium azide) at 37 °C. The coverslips were rinsed three times in PBS. Incubation with secondary antibodies (at a 1/500 dilution in antibody dilution buffer) was for 30 min at 37 °C. The coverslips were rinsed three times in PBS and mounted on glass slides. Images were obtained on a Leica DMRBE microscope with a 100× objective using a Spot charge coupled device camera. For focal adhesion counts, images were taken using a 40× objective, and counting was performed using the Image Pro image analysis software. A minimum of 160 cells was counted for each condition, and results are expressed as the number of focal adhesions/cell. Plates were coated for 1 h at 37 °C with 10 μg/ml poly-l-lysine in PBS. Where needed, further coating with 10 μg/ml ECM proteins (laminin, vitronectin, or fibronectin) in PBS was performed overnight at 37 °C. Cells were trypsinized, counted, and diluted to a concentration of 5 × 105 cells/ml in serum-free medium. When needed, aliquots of cells were incubated with the appropriate inhibitor at the indicated concentration for 15 min at 4 °C (with the exception of PMA, which was also added 12 h prior to the experiment and replenished at the time of the experiment). For the experiments in Fig. 5, 2.5 × 105 cells were seeded in 24-well plates and incubated for 10 min at 37 °C. Plates were rinsed twice with PBS, and the remaining adhering cells were incubated for 90 min in medium containing 0.5 mg/ml MTT. After three rinses with PBS, the MTT stain was solubilized by incubation 10 min in dimethyl sulfoxide, and the absorbance was measured at 550 or 600 nm. Adhesion assays in Figs. 8and 9 were performed in a similar manner but in 96-well plates, with only 2.5 × 104 cells seeded per well.FIG. 8RACK1 and PKC ε are required for PMA-induced integrin mediated adhesion and migration.A, PKCε levels in U251N (wild type), pREP (control, empty vector), and cells transiently (Eas) or stably (Eas30) transfected with an antisense PKCε construct are shown in the top panel. RACK1 levels in U251N (wild type), pcDNA (control, empty vector), or cells transiently transfected with pcDNA3.1-RACKas (pcRACKas) are shown in thebottom panel. 100 μg of protein was loaded per well for the PKCε Western blot and 10 μg of proteins/well for the RACK1 Western blot.

PMA treatment increased the motility of cells over the 72-h period analyzed (Fig. 1, A and B). We have shown previously that U251N glioma cells express the PKC isoforms α, δ, ε, η, μ, and ζ, but not β1, β2, ι, and θ (36Besson A. Yong V.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4580-4590Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). To determine which isoform was responsible for increasing cell motility, we analyzed the translocation pattern, after PMA stimulation, of the six PKC isoforms expressed over a 72-h period. Translocation of PKC from the cytosol to the membrane is a hallmark of its activation (7Newton A.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar). Upon PMA treatment, PKCα and ε were the only isoforms translocated from the cytosolic to the particulate fraction in these cells (Fig.1C), as observed previously (36Besson A. Yong V.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4580-4590Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). PKCδ, η, μ, and ζ remained unaffected by PMA (neither translocated nor down-regulated). PKCα was totally down-regulated by 24 h of treatment and remained absent at 72 h. On the other hand, PKCε was only partially down-regulated and remained translocated at 72 h. To dissect the role of these two isoforms, we generated clones stably overexpressing either PKCα or ε. Two representative clones for each isoform were used in this study; their respective expression levels are shown in Fig. 2A. The effect of PKC overexpression was compared with the wild type (U251N) and vector-transfected cells (pBK) in a motility assay (Fig.2B). In the absence of PMA stimulation, the PKCα-overexpressing clones (As20 and As27) migrated slightly slower than the wild type or control vector cells, and the PKCε-overexpressing clones migrated slightly faster (Fig.2B, left panel). However, when cells were incubated with 100 nm PMA, these differences were exacerbated, and it became clear that PKCε overexpression increased motility, whereas PKCα overexpression decreased cell motility (Fig.2B, right panel). Together, these results suggest that PKCε positively regulates glioma cell migration, whereas PKCα plays an opposite role. To verify that the increased motility induced by PMA was caused by the activation of PKC, as PMA has been reported to activate other targets (37Kazanietz M.G. Mol. Carcinog. 2000; 28: 5-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), we performed motility assays in the presence of two different PKC-specific inhibitors, calphostin C and bisindolylmaleimide I. The presence of either of these inhibitors substantially decreased the basal migration level (in the absence of PMA) of pBK and Es10 cells and completely abolished the increased motility induced by PMA in both cell lines (Fig. 2C), indicating that the effect of PMA on motility was indeed a consequence of PKC activation. A modified Boyden chamber assay was also used to evaluate glioma cell motility. The higher sensitivity also allowed a shorter time point of 16-h migration to be employed. Fig. 2D shows that the PKCε-overexpressing clones had higher basal levels of migration compared with parent or pBK vector control cells and that PMA treatment further increased migration. In contrast, as observed in the scratch assay (Fig. 2B), PKCα clones had low basal or PMA-stimulated motility. A potential contributing factor to the increased migration of cells across a scratch line is the proliferation rate, whereby a faster proliferating clone produces more cells in a given time than a slower growing clone to fill in the scratch area. Thus, clones plated on coverslips at a fixed density (10,000 cells/12-mm coverslip) were pulsed 24 h after with 10 μm bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd), a thymidine analog. After a 1.5-h BrdUrd pulse, cells were fixed and stained for BrdUrd incorporation as described previously (38Yong V.W. Kim S.U. J. Neurosci. Methods. 1987; 21: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Cells were counterstained with Hoescht dye to label all nuclei, and the proportion of BrdUrd-positive cells in each clone was obtained (between 200 and 300 cells/coverslip, four coverslips/group, were analyzed). No difference was found in the basal proliferation rates of the different clones (vector, 29.2 ± 3.7%; Es1, 32.5 ± 1.6%; Es10, 36.4 ± 2.9; As20, 31.4 ± 2.1%). Focal adhesions are the sit"

Here we report the solution structure of the Cdc13 DNA binding domain in complex with telomeric DNA. The structure reveals the use of a single OB (oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide binding) fold augmented by an unusually large loop for DNA recognition. This OB fold is structurally similar to OB folds found in the ciliated protozoan telomere end-binding protein, although no sequence similarity is apparent between them. The common usage of an OB fold for telomeric DNA interaction demonstrates conservation of end-protection mechanisms among eukaryotes."
https://openalex.org/W2131211659,"Zinc is essential to a wide range of cellular processes; therefore, it is important to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of zinc homeostasis. To date, no zinc transporters expressed at the enterocyte apical membrane, and so essential to mammalian zinc homeostasis, have been discovered. We identified hZTL1 as a human expressed sequence tag with homology to the basolateral enterocyte zinc transporter ZnT1 and deduced the full-length cDNA sequence by PCR. The protein of 523 amino acids belongs to the cation diffusion facilitator family of membrane transporters. Unusually, the predicted topology comprises 12 rather than 6 transmembrane domains. ZTL1 mRNA was detected by reverse transcription-PCR in a range of mouse tissues. A Myc-tagged hZTL1 clone was expressed in transiently transfected polarized human intestinal Caco-2 cells at the apical membrane. Expression of hZTL1 mRNA in Caco-2 cells increased with zinc supplementation of the nutrient medium; however, in the placental cell line JAR hZTL1 appeared not to be regulated by zinc. Heterologous expression of hZTL1 in Xenopus laevis oocytes increased zinc uptake across the plasma membrane. The localization, regulatory properties, and function of hZTL1 indicate a role in regulating the absorption of dietary zinc across the apical enterocyte membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2047742646,"The biochemical properties of PsbS protein, a nuclear-encoded Photosystem II subunit involved in the high energy quenching of chlorophyll fluorescence, have been studied using preparations purified from chloroplasts or obtained by overexpression in bacteria. Despite the homology with chlorophylla/b/xanthophyll-binding proteins of the Lhc family, native PsbS protein does not show any detectable ability to bind chlorophylls or carotenoids in conditions in which Lhc proteins maintain full pigment binding. The recombinant protein, when refoldedin vitro in the presence of purified pigments, neither binds chlorophylls nor xanthophylls, differently from the homologous proteins LHCII, CP26, and CP29 that refold into stable pigment-binding complexes. Thus, it is concluded that if PsbS is a pigment-binding protein in vivo, the binding mechanism must be different from that present in other Lhc proteins. Primary sequence analysis provides evidence for homology of PsbS helices I and III with the central 2-fold symmetric core of chlorophylla/b-binding proteins. Moreover, a structural homology owed to the presence of acidic residues in each of the two lumen-exposed loops is found with the dicyclohexylcarbodiimide/Ca2+-binding domain of CP29. Consistently, both native and recombinant PsbS proteins showed [14C]dicyclohexylcarbodiimide binding, thus supporting a functional basis for its homology with CP29 on the lumen-exposed loops.

Chloroplast gene products are located in the core complex where electron transport reactions are catalyzed, whereas the surrounding light-harvesting system is composed of nuclear-encoded chlorophyll a/b/xanthophyll proteins belonging to the Lhc family (1Jansson S. Trends Plant Sci. 1999; 4: 236-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). Lhc proteins of PSII include Lhcb1–3 gene products that form heterotrimeric complexes (LHCII) located peripherally in the PSII·LHCII supercomplex and Lhcb4–6 proteins, which form a layer of monomeric subunits located between the core complex and trimeric LHCII. Besides the role of harvesting light and transferring excitation energy to the PSII reaction center (RC), Lhc proteins are involved in regulative mechanisms aimed at both the optimization of excitation energy distribution between PSI and PSII and the protection of the PSII RC from photoinhibition when absorbed light exceeds the electron transport capacity of the chloroplast. The former mechanisms acting at moderate to low light intensity include the reversible phosphorylation of LHCII, which leads to the detachment of phospho-LHCII from PSII and its migration to stroma membranes where it transfers energy to PSI (2Allen J.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1098: 275-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). The mechanisms of protection from photoinhibition are elicited at high light intensity and include the reversible phosphorylation of Lhcb4 (CP29) (3Bergantino E. Dainese P. Cerovic Z. Sechi S. Bassi R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8474-8481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and the xanthophyll cycle-dependent non-photochemical energy quenching (NPQ). In excess light conditions, low luminal pH activates the enzyme violaxanthin de-epoxidase leading to the formation of zeaxanthin (4Yamamoto H.Y. Nakayama T.O.M. Chichester C.O. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1962; 97: 168-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), which is found either free in the lipid phase (5Havaux M. Niyogi K.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8762-8767Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar) or bound to the Lhcb proteins (6Bassi R. Pineau B. Dainese P. Marquardt J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 212: 297-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 7Ruban A.V. Young A.J. Pascal A.A. Horton P. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1994; 104: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Concomitantly, a strong quenching of chlorophyll fluorescence takes place, leading to the dissipation of up to 75% Chla S1-excited states into heat (8Demmig-Adams B. Adams W.W. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1992; 43: 599-626Crossref Scopus (2044) Google Scholar). Fluorescence quenching is dependent on protonation events on the luminal side of thylakoid membranes, and it is inhibited by dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD), a protein-modifying agent that covalently binds to acidic residues in hydrophobic environment (9Ruban A.V. Walters R.G. Horton P. FEBS Lett. 1992; 309: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). DCCD binding sites have been localized on the lumen-exposed domains of Lhcb4 (10Pesaresi P. Sandona D. Giuffra E. Bassi R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 402: 151-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and Lhcb5 (11Walters R.G. Ruban A.V. Horton P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14204-14209Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar).Recently, a Lhc-like polypeptide has been shown to be essential for NPQ. The npq-4 Arabidopsis thaliana mutant deleted in thepsbS nuclear gene is defective in qE. However, mutant plants are competent in violaxanthin de-epoxidation (12Li X.P. Bjorkman O. Shih C. Grossman A.R. Rosenquist M. Jansson S. Niyogi K.K. Nature. 2000; 403: 391-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (1148) Google Scholar). Determination of the role of PsbS in qE appears to be an important step in the elucidation of the functional organization of PSII. Nevertheless, information on the biochemical properties of this protein is limited. Primary sequence analysis suggests four transmembrane helices and a strong homology with Chla/b/xanthophyll-binding proteins at least in the helix A/B domains (13Kim S. Sandusky P. Bowlby N.R. Aebersold R. Green B.R. Vlahakis S. Yocum C.F. Pichersky E. FEBS Lett. 1992; 314: 67-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). A point of major interest is the pigment binding properties of PsbS. Chlorophyll and xanthophyll binding to PsbS was previously reported (14Funk C. Schröder W.P. Napiwotzki A. Tjus S.E. Renger G. Andersson B. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11133-11141Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), thus suggesting together with its requirement for qE that this protein rather than CP29 or CP26 (6Bassi R. Pineau B. Dainese P. Marquardt J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 212: 297-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar) is the site of ΔpH and xanthophyll-dependent excitation quenching (12Li X.P. Bjorkman O. Shih C. Grossman A.R. Rosenquist M. Jansson S. Niyogi K.K. Nature. 2000; 403: 391-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (1148) Google Scholar). In this work, we have studied the biochemical properties of PsbS either purified from thylakoid membranes or overexpressed in Escherichia coli and refolded in vitro in the presence of pigments. Our results suggest that PsbS does not bind pigments, or the binding mechanism is very different from that involved in pigment binding in other Lhc proteins. We found that both native and recombinant proteins bind DCCD, suggesting that its function may be the transduction of low luminal pH signal into a conformational change of neighbor chlorophyll-binding proteins where the quenching process could occur.DISCUSSIONTo gain information on the role of PsbS in thermal dissipation of excitation energy (12Li X.P. Bjorkman O. Shih C. Grossman A.R. Rosenquist M. Jansson S. Niyogi K.K. Nature. 2000; 403: 391-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (1148) Google Scholar), its ability of binding pigments is particularly interesting. If PsbS is a Chl-binding protein, a quenching center could be formed within the protein itself and the excitation energy could be transferred from the surrounding Lhc and/or PSII core Chl-binding proteins through pigment-pigment interactions, similar to those involved in excitation energy transfer to PSII RC for catalysis of charge separation. If PsbS is not a pigment-binding protein, the alternative mechanisms of quenching should be considered,e.g. the possibility that PsbS could act as a signal transduction component able to undergo conformational changes upon protonation on its lumen-exposed domains and transfer conformational information to neighbor Chl-binding proteins where the actual quencher would be formed.PsbS Does Not Bind Pigments TightlyWe have investigated the possibility that PsbS, isolated from either thylakoid membranes or from overexpression in E. coli and subsequent in vitrorefolding, binds pigments similarly to other members of the Lhc protein family. In a first approach, PsbS was purified either by cation exchange chromatography or by preparative flat-bed IEF followed by sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation in the presence of mild detergents to purify thylakoid membrane proteins. In both cases, the first purification step yielded a preparation containing small amount of pigments; however, further fractionation by sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation separated pigments and proteins into different fractions. In the few cases in which PsbS-containing fractions were green, the presence of pigments was due to contamination by PSII core subunits or by free pigments as judged by absorption and CD spectra.Because the purification procedures induced partial aggregation of PsbS, the possibility could be considered that aggregation was secondary to a denaturation process proceeding through the loss of pigments and exposure of hydrophobic protein domains. Thus, we explored conditions in which PsbS could be recovered in unaggregated form. Ultracentrifugation in a detergent/lipid sucrose gradient prevented aggregation, but no pigment binding was detected. Similar results were obtained by solubilizing G&Y particles by a combination of detergents. The addition of Ca2+ lead to extensive aggregation of PsbS, whereas the same detergents without Ca2+ were effective in solubilizing PsbS. In solubilized G&Y, PsbS is a major component because its abundance is similar to CP29 as judged from Coomassie Blue stained gel. If PsbS was a pigment-binding protein, the differences would have been detected in the green band pattern obtained by Deriphat PAGE when comparing gel lanes loaded with supernatant fractions enriched or depleted in PsbS (plus Ca2+ versus−Ca2+). Nevertheless, no differences in either the mobility or the relative intensity of green bands could be detected not only by visual inspection but also by densitometry (data not shown), thus strongly suggesting that no pigments were bound to PsbS extracted from thylakoids.Since the first report of in vitro refolding of Lhcb proteins (27Plumley F.G. Schmidt G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 146-150Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the procedure has been improved to obtain pigment proteins indistinguishable from their counterparts purified from membranes and extended to all the members of the protein family including Lhcb1, CP29 (20Giuffra E. Cugini D. Croce R. Bassi R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 112-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), CP26 (37Ros F. Bassi R. Paulsen H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 253: 653-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), CP24 (38Pagano A. Cinque G. Bassi R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17154-17165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), Lhca1, and Lhca4 (39Schmid V.H.R. Cammarata K.V. Bruns B.U. Schmidt G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7667-7672Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In some instances, owing to the relative harshness of the purification procedure and lability of pigment binding, recombinant proteins were shown to be more stable than the same protein purified from thylakoids. This was the case of CP24. The purified protein was reported earlier to bind five Chls/polypeptide (40Dainese P. Bassi R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8136-8142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the recombinant protein refolded in vitro has been shown to bind 10 Chls/polypeptide (38Pagano A. Cinque G. Bassi R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17154-17165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). PsbS was expressed in E. coli and subjected to the in vitro refolding procedure in the presence of purified pigments (19Rogl H. Kosemund K. Kuhlbrandt W. Collinson I. FEBS Lett. 1998; 432: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) in conditions that are effective in producing pigment proteins with Lhcb1. Nevertheless, no pigments were found to be bound to this protein.An additional experiment was performed to investigate the possibility of PsbS binding its hypothetical pigment complement in cooperation with neighbor Lhc proteins CP29 and CP26. In vitro reconstituted Lhc proteins can form both homo and hetero oligomers (39Schmid V.H.R. Cammarata K.V. Bruns B.U. Schmidt G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7667-7672Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 41Kuttkat A. Hartmann A. Hobe S. Paulsen H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 288-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), inducing modification in their spectroscopic properties. PsbS did not establish interactions with other Lhcb proteins stable enough to be detected by our methods.Following in vitro refolding, PsbS behaves similarly to the protein purified from membranes as judged by its recovering in sucrose gradient, partially in a detergent soluble form in the lower part of the gradient and partially in the pellet. It is worth noticing that rPsbS acquired its DCCD binding capacity only if submitted to the refolding procedure. No labeling was obtained with solubilized inclusion bodies, suggesting that the refolding procedure was actually effective with PsbS, although this does not imply pigment binding. This view is supported by the report on another DCCD-binding protein, CP29 (10Pesaresi P. Sandona D. Giuffra E. Bassi R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 402: 151-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), which belongs to Lhc family. In this case, refolding in vitro could be easily followed by pigment binding which appeared together with DCCD binding (10Pesaresi P. Sandona D. Giuffra E. Bassi R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 402: 151-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). This finding suggests that the recombinant protein assumes a conformation similar to that in thylakoids, even in the absence of bound chlorophyll and/or carotenoids.Pigment binding to PsbS was previously hypothesized on the basis of its homology with Lhc proteins (13Kim S. Sandusky P. Bowlby N.R. Aebersold R. Green B.R. Vlahakis S. Yocum C.F. Pichersky E. FEBS Lett. 1992; 314: 67-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 42Wedel N. Klein R. Ljungberg U. Andersson B. Herrmann R.G. FEBS Lett. 1992; 314: 61-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) followed by experimental report of both Chla and Chlb binding (14Funk C. Schröder W.P. Napiwotzki A. Tjus S.E. Renger G. Andersson B. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11133-11141Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Our findings contrast with this report. Not only were we unable to show pigment binding by using both the same techniques described in Funk et al. (14Funk C. Schröder W.P. Napiwotzki A. Tjus S.E. Renger G. Andersson B. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11133-11141Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) and other methods as well, the use of in vitrorefolding, a procedure that was effective in reconstituting pigment binding in many Lhc proteins (actually in all Lhcb and Lhca proteins so far described), was ineffective.Fig. 9 A shows the partial alignment of PsbS sequence with the transmembrane regions of CP29, CP26, and LHCII. The first and the third helices display significant homology. The Glu/Arg ionic pairs involved in the stabilization of the central cross in the structure of LHCII and in the binding of two chlorophylls are conserved. However, six residues shown to bind chlorophyll in both CP29 (43Bassi R. Croce R. Cugini D. Sandona D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10056-10061Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) and LHCII (21Remelli R. Varotto C. Sandona D. Croce R. Bassi R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33510-33521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) are not conserved. Also, four carotenoid binding sequences identified in the extrinsic loops of LHCII at each side of the transmembrane helices (44Pichersky E. Jansson S. Ort D.R. Yocum C.F. Oxygenic Photosynthesis: The Light Reactions. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1996: 507-521Google Scholar) are not conserved in PsbS.We conclude that PsbS is either not a pigment-binding protein or its interaction with pigments is of a different nature with respect to that exhibited by the Lhca1–4 and Lhcb1–6 gene products. We cannot exclude that an interaction with pigments exists in the thylakoid membrane; however, if this is the case, the interaction must be much weaker and of a different nature with respect to that present in the other Lhc proteins. In particular, although Lhc proteins depend on pigment binding for their folding, PsbS seems not to do so because DCCD binding was reconstituted even in the absence of pigments. Our results are consistent with the previous finding that PsbS is stable in etiolated leaves (45Funk C. Adamska I. Green B.R. Andersson B. Renger G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30141-30147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), which do not contain chlorophyll. The previous report of pigment binding to PsbS differs from our present results only with respect to the extent of co-purification of pigments with the PsbS protein, whereas many of the results in Funk et al. (14Funk C. Schröder W.P. Napiwotzki A. Tjus S.E. Renger G. Andersson B. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11133-11141Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) are consistent with the fact that pigments are not bound to the protein. In particular there was no evidence for Chlb to Chlasinglet energy transfer, no circular dichroism spectrum (14Funk C. Schröder W.P. Napiwotzki A. Tjus S.E. Renger G. Andersson B. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11133-11141Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), and no triplet energy transfer. 2Dekker, J., personal communication. We suggest that the contamination of the PsbS protein preparation by pigments was caused by a modification introduced by Funk et al.(14Funk C. Schröder W.P. Napiwotzki A. Tjus S.E. Renger G. Andersson B. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11133-11141Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) in the purification method, consisting in the omission of the sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation step suggested by the original report of the IEF technique (16Dainese P. Hoyer-hansen G. Bassi R. Photochem. Photobiol. 1990; 51: 693-703Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As a result, free pigments in the detergent solution were not separated from the co-eluted PsbS protein. An application of the sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation step resulted into the separation of a free-pigment band from the PsbS-containing fractions.DCCD Binding Supports the Proton-sensing Role for PsbSPigment binding is not the only function of Lhc proteins. Members of this protein family may have either additional/alternative functions besides to chlorophyll a/b and carotenoid binding. In this context, the recent result that CP29 is a Ca2+-binding protein (46Jegerschöld C. Rutherford A.W. Mattioli T.A. Crimi M. Bassi R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12781-12788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) is of particular relevance. It was found that DCCD displaces Ca2+ from its binding site, and yet Chl binding was not affected (46Jegerschöld C. Rutherford A.W. Mattioli T.A. Crimi M. Bassi R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12781-12788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), suggesting that pigment binding and Ca2+/DCCD-binding domains were at least in part distinct in CP29. Acidic residues binding Ca2+ in CP29 have been localized in the luminal loop of CP29. This domain shows three acidic residues, a characteristic shared with the two luminal loops of PsbS (homologous to each other), thus suggesting similar function (Fig.9 B). Although we did not perform45Ca2+-binding experiments, the finding of DCCD binding by PsbS is a strong indication that this protein has two functional domains similar to those characterized as DCCD/Ca2+ binding in CP29. Thus, PsbS appears to be a Lhc-type protein specialized in the function catalyzed by the Ca2+/DCCD-binding domain.The function of DCCD binding domains of Lhc proteins is not completely clear. It has been proposed that reversible protonation of acidic residues induces conformational changes triggering NPQ (11Walters R.G. Ruban A.V. Horton P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14204-14209Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Consistently, DCCD has been shown to inhibit the Δ535-nm absorption signal associated with a pH-induced conformational change (47Jahns P. Junge W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 193: 731-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 48Walters R.G. Ruban A.V. Horton P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 1063-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The 535-nm absorption change is missing in the Arabidopsis thaliana npq-4 mutant, and yet CP26 and CP29 are not affected in this mutant (12Li X.P. Bjorkman O. Shih C. Grossman A.R. Rosenquist M. Jansson S. Niyogi K.K. Nature. 2000; 403: 391-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (1148) Google Scholar). This finding suggests that the conformational changes within the thylakoid membrane associated with NPQ are induced by protonation of PsbS.Our finding that PsbS does not stably bind pigments implies that quenching must be induced through an indirect mechanism. One possibility is that pigments are reversibly bound to PsbS and that the quenching function is catalyzed by the hypothetical pigment binding form present in the thylakoids but not resistant to purification. An alternative possibility is that one or more chlorophyll-binding proteins are involved other than PsbS where actual quenching of Chl-excited states can occur. In this context, it is relevant to determine the identity of the nearest neighbors to PsbS. The extraction of G&Y membranes with mild detergents preserve in part the interaction of PsbS with PSII supramolecular complex as detected by two-dimensional Deriphat PAGE (Fig. 4 C). Previous determinations showed low levels of PsbS in these preparations obtained with β-DM (32Hankamer B. Nield J. Zheleva D. Boekema E. Jansson S. Barber J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 422-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 33Harrer R. Bassi R. Testi M.G. Schäfer C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 196-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 50Nield J. Funk C. Barber J. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond-Biol. Sci. 2000; 355: 1337-1344Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar,51Nield J. Orlova E.V. Morris E.P. Gowen B. van Heel M. Barber J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 44-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), suggesting that this subunit is not firmly bound to other PSII components and can be easily removed. However, our results obtained by using the α isomer of DM show that not only is PsbS a component of the PSII·LHCII supercomplex, its concentration increases when PSII core to LHCII ratio is higher. On the other hand, PsbS accumulated at normal levels in PSII RC mutants, thus suggesting it is not a genuine PSII core subunit but rather an antenna component. In fact, Lhc mutants did not show pleiotropic effects, thus allowing accumulation of Lhc complexes independently from each other (30Bossmann B. Knoetzel J. Jansson S. Photosynth. Res. 1997; 52: 127-136Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Because PsbS is enriched in the G&Y preparation containing PSII core and the inner layer of Lhcb proteins, namely CP29 and in part CP26, our data are thus consistent with the localization of PsbS outside of PSII core complex, possibly in a region where PSII core and CP29 interact. It cannot be excluded that PsbS has more than one possible location within the PSII·LHCII supercomplex.Lifetime fluorescence analysis of CP29, CP26, CP24, and LHCII (52Frank H.A. Das S.K. Bautista J.A. Bruce D. Vasil'ev S. Crimi M. Croce R. Bassi R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1220-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 53Crimi M. Dorra D. Bosinger C.S. Giuffra E. Holzwarth A.R.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12552-12561Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) showed that Lhc proteins in detergent solution are found in two different conformations characterized by either low or high fluorescence yield, the quenched conformation being favored by zeaxanthin binding to xanthophyll site L2 (53Crimi M. Dorra D. Bosinger C.S. Giuffra E. Holzwarth A.R. Bassi R. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 260-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 54Moya I. Silvestri M. Vallon O. Cinque G. Bassi R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12552-12561Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). PsbS could possibly act by detecting low luminal pH through lumen-exposed DCCD-binding domains and undergo conformational change. Although PsbS did not bind pigments in vitro, it is well possible that newly formed zeaxanthin might bind to PsbS and contribute to the stabilization of a new conformation that is transferred to neighbor chlorophyll proteins. Recent work by Resonance Raman Spectroscopy supports this possibility (55Ruban A.V. Pascal A.A. Robert B. Horton P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7785-7789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). These proteins in turn could be induced to change their conformation into a quenched state. Quenching could be amplified through the establishment of new protein-protein interactions within the lipid membrane (49Briantais J.M. Jennings R.C. Zucchelli G. Ghetti F. Colombetti G. Life Sciences, Light as an Energy Source and Information Carrier in Plant Physiology. NATO ASI Series A, Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1996: 113-124Google Scholar) as recently shown in a reconstituted system (54Moya I. Silvestri M. Vallon O. Cinque G. Bassi R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12552-12561Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar).In this paper, we show that the PsbS protein binds the NPQ inhibitor DCCD, and that it either does not bind pigments or the binding is much less stable than in the case of other members of the Lhc protein family. Moreover, pigment binding is not indispensable for the refolding of the protein in vitro. This information is important for the understanding of the role of PsbS on the mechanism of NPQ. Further studies are needed to test the different hypotheses consistent with these findings and particularly if PsbS itself catalyzes the 1Chla*-quenching reaction. Alternatively, PsbS could be a component of a signal transduction device sensing low luminal pH, thus inducing a conformational change in chlorophyll-binding proteins to a quenching state as recently suggested (54Moya I. Silvestri M. Vallon O. Cinque G. Bassi R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12552-12561Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Photosystem II (PSII)1 of higher plants is a multisubunit membrane complex composed of many polypeptides that are encoded by the chloroplast or nuclear genes. Chloroplast gene products are located in the core complex where electron transport reactions are catalyzed, whereas the surrounding light-harvesting system is composed of nuclear-encoded chlorophyll a/b/xanthophyll proteins belonging to the Lhc family (1Jansson S. Trends Plant Sci. 1999; 4: 236-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). Lhc proteins of PSII include Lhcb1–3 gene products that form heterotrimeric complexes (LHCII) located peripherally in the PSII·LHCII supercomplex and Lhcb4–6 proteins, which form a layer of monomeric subunits located between the core complex and"

This study examined the effects of HIV protease inhibitors (PIs) on bone resorption, bone formation, and adipocyte differentiation using ex vivo cultured osteoclasts, osteoblasts, and adipocytes, respectively. Osteoclast activity, measured using a rat neonatal calvaria assay, increased in the presence of nelfinavir (NFV; 47.2%, p = 0.001), indinavir (34.6%, p = 0.001), saquinavir (24.3%,p = 0.001), or ritonavir (18%, p < 0.01). In contrast, lopinavir (LPV) and amprenavir did not increase osteoclast activity. In human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs), the PIs LPV and NFV decreased osteoblast alkaline phosphatase enzyme activity and gene expression significantly (p < 0.05). LPV and NFV diminished calcium deposition and osteoprotegrin expression (p < 0.05), whereas the other PIs investigated did not. Adipogenesis of hMSCs was strongly inhibited by saquinavir and NFV (>50%, p < 0.001) and moderately inhibited by ritonavir and LPV (>40%, p < 0.01). Expression of diacylglycerol transferase, a marker of adipocyte differentiation, decreased in hMSCs treated with NFV. Amprenavir and indinavir did not affect adipogenesis or lipolysis.

Over the last few years a number of unusual adverse events have been observed when HAART is used as a long term therapy (2Jain R.G. Furfine E.S. Pedneault L. White A.J. Lenhard J.M. Antivir. Res. 2001; 51: 151-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Some common complications associated with HAART are: adverse events related to the use of NRTIs (e.g. neuropathy, myopathy, pancreatitis, and lactic acidosis; Ref. 3White A. Sex. Transm.

AIDS. 2001; 15: 975-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Osteonecrosis has been documented in case reports of HIV patients; however, some of these reports predate HAART, and there is no firm evidence that osteonecrosis is associated with HAART (8Meyer D. Behrens G. Schmidt R.E. Stoll M. AIDS. 1999; 13: 1147-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 9Scribner A.N. Troia-Cancio P.V. Cox B.A. Marcantonio D. Hamid F. Keiser P. Levi M. Allen B.

Many factors may influence bone and fat metabolism and could lead to bone dysfunction in HIV patients including the presence of viral infection, therapeutic drugs (PIs, NRTIs, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, or combination therapies), cellular response to the virus/drug, and immune function in the affected individual.Decreased bone formative and increased bone resorptive serum markers have been observed in subjects receiving HAART (4Aukrust P. Haug C.J. Ueland T. Lien E. Muller F. Espevik T. Bollerslev J. Froland S.S. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1999; 84: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 7Huang J.S. Rietschl P. Hadigan C.M. Rosenthal D.I. Grinspoon S. AIDS. 2001; 15: 975-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). However, there are conflicting reports on the cause of the bone disorders observed in these patients. Carr et al. (6Carr A. Miller J. Eisman J.A. Cooper J.A. AIDS. 2001; 15: 703-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) have reported a connection between low pre-therapy body weight, asymptomatic lactic acidemia, and osteopenia in HAART patients. Regardless of specific HIV drug treatment, Huang et al. (7Huang J.S. Rietschl P. Hadigan C.M. Rosenthal D.I. Grinspoon S. AIDS. 2001; 15: 975-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) reported a lower bone mineral density (BMD) associated with an increase in abdominal visceral fat. Interestingly a longitudinal study report (10Nolan D. Upton R. John M. McKinnon E. James I. Adler B. Roff G. Vasikaran S. Mallal S. AIDS. 2001; 15: 1275-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) demonstrates that there may be an increase or no change in BMD after treatment with certain PIs. Contrary to the above reports, Tebas et al. (5Tebas P. Powderly W.G. Claxton S. Marin D. Tantisiriwat W. Teitelbaum S.L. Yarasheski K.E. AIDS. 2000; 14: F63-F67Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar) found no link between increased lipodystrophy and lower BMD in their cross-sectional studies. Instead they suggest a link in the development of osteopenia and osteoporosis to the PIs received by HAART patients, although the role of current or previous NRTI use on bone mineral density was not addressed (11Weiel J.E. Lenhard J.M. AIDS. 2000; 14: 2218-2219Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar).These studies reveal that the effect of HAART on alterations in BMD remains unclear. This is probably due to the complexity of HAART, which can involve a treatment choice of up to 16 drugs in various combinations. Furthermore the response to HAART can be influenced by pre-therapy body weight, progression of the viral infection, and its effect on bone metabolism (12Major N.M. Tehranzadeh J. Radiol. Clin. N. Am. 1997; 35: 1167-1189PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, individual patients may have genetic traits or be exposed to environmental factors that influence their response to HIV and to HAART and alter their risk for the development of osteoporosis.Osteoblasts (OBs) and osteoclasts (OCs) are derived from different cell lineages and play important roles in bone metabolism. OBs are derived from stromal cells or mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) within the bone marrow. OCs are derived from hematopoietic cells and are distantly related to monocytes and macrophages. OBs are involved in active bone formation while OCs are involved in bone degradation and resorption. The functions of OBs and OCs balance one another during normal bone metabolism and any alterations in the function or formation of either of these cell types may result in the development of osteopenia or osteoporosis. The effect of individual HIV-PIs on isolated OB and OC cells remains unknown.PIs have proven to be a very effective drug class for the control of HIV infection by inhibiting the aspartyl HIV protease and interfering with formation of mature viral particles. It is important to note that these drugs vary structurally, and mechanistic studies are essential to determine interclass variability in the development of adverse events (such as osteoporosis). This study uses hMSCs and rat calvaria to study how PIs may influence bone and fat metabolism ex vivo. All commercially available PIs were individually studied in these HIV-free systems. To elucidate and differentiate the individual effect of each PI on bone, specific measurements of osteoclast activity/bone resorption (measured in rodent calvaria), bone formation, adipocyte formation, and fat degradation in the presence of physiological PI concentrations were examined.MATERIALS AND METHODSDexamethasone, sodium β-glycerophosphate, Me2SO, ascorbic acid 2-phosphate, isobutylmethylxanthine, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) diagnostic kit no. 86, and calcium diagnostic kit no. 587 were purchased from Sigma. The PIs used in these studies, amprenavir (APV), indinavir (IDV), lopinavir (LPV), nelfinavir (NFV), ritonavir (RTV), and saquinavir (SQV), were obtained from GlaxoSmithKline Inc. chemical stores. Since PIs are insoluble at >40 μm in aqueous solutions, Me2SO was used to make concentrated stock solutions as reported previously (13Lenhard J.M. Furfine E.S. Jain R.G. Ittoop O. Orband-Miller L.A. Blanchard S.G. Paulik M.A. Weiel J.E. Antivir. Res. 2000; 47: 121-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). We have observed (13Lenhard J.M. Furfine E.S. Jain R.G. Ittoop O. Orband-Miller L.A.

Lenhard, unpublished data. that less than 0.1% Me2SO has no effect on cell growth and differentiation and hence is a satisfactory vehicle and control for these experiments. Human mesenchymal stem cells were purchased from BioWhittaker Inc. (Walkersville, MD). The measurements for osteoblastic and adipogenic parameters were conducted on differentiated cells that were no longer proliferating. Cell culture and lipid accumulation assays were done following published procedures (14Jaiswal N. Haynesworth S.E. Caplan A.I. Bruder S.P. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 64: 295-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (1817) Google Scholar, 15Pittenger M.F. Mackay A.M. Beck S.C. Jaiswal R.K. Douglas R. Mosca J.D. Moorman M.A. Simonetti D.W. Craig S. Marshak D.R. Science. 1999; 284: 143-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (17773) Google Scholar). In summary, hMSCs (passages 3–5) were plated at a density of 104 cells/cm2and cultured in Dulbecco's minimum essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum purchased from BioWhittaker Inc. Osteogenic differentiation was induced using 0.1 μm dexamethasone, 0.05 mm ascorbic acid 2-phosphate, and 10 mmβ-glycerophosphate (osteogenic stimulation (OS) medium) within 24 h of plating. Simultaneously various concentrations of PIs were added to the cells, which were almost >90% confluent. Measurements of ALP activity and histochemical staining in hMSCs (BioWhittaker, Inc.) were performed as described previously (14Jaiswal N. Haynesworth S.E. Caplan A.I. Bruder S.P. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 64: 295-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (1817) Google Scholar). After 7–21 days ALP activity and histochemical staining were measured using the Sigma Fast para-nitrophenyl phosphate substrate and the ALP leukocyte staining kit, respectively, according to the manufacturer's specifications (Sigma). For calcium accumulation measurements, Sigma diagnostic kit no. 587 was used following the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were incubated in 0.6 n HCl for 24 h, and an aliquot was diluted 20× into the calcium working reagent and shaken for 3 min followed by an OD measurement at 575 nm. Alternatively adipogenesis was induced by treating confluent cells for 14–21 days with 0.01 mg/ml insulin, 1 μm BRL49653, 1 μm dexamethasone, 0.5 mmisobutylmethylxanthine, and 1 μm LG100268 for a period of 3 days followed by the removal of dexamethasone and isobutylmethylxanthine for a period of 2 days. After 14–21 days in culture, cellular lipid content was measured using the Sigma diagnostic glycerol-triglyceride assay (i.e. Trinder reagent 337, Sigma).Neonatal rat calvaria were surgically removed from pregnant Wistar female rats and placed in basal medium as described by Vargas et al. (16Vargas S.J. Raisz L.G. Bone. 1990; 11: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). After a 24 h stabilization period, the calvaria were incubated in basal medium containing 10 μm PI for a period of 48 h. After the incubation, the medium was collected, and an aliquot was analyzed for calcium release using Sigma diagnostic kit no. 588 following the manufacturer's instructions. All assays were run in triplicate, and results from each group were compared with untreated calvaria and parathyroid hormone (PTH)-treated calvaria.Total RNA was isolated using Qiagen RNeasy kits (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA) and quantified with Ribogreen (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Taqman probes and primers were designed to match GenBankTMsequences for human diacylglycerol transferase, alkaline phosphatase, and lipoprotein lipase. Real time polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCR) were performed as described by Lenhard et al. (17Lenhard J.M. Croom D.K. Weiel J.E. Winegar D.A. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 2625-2629Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). All samples were assayed in duplicate with three samples per group. Results from each group were averaged and compared with untreated cells to provide a p value using the Student's t test.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONOC activity was measured using a rat neonatal calvaria assay that monitors calcium release as a measure of bone resorption. The effect of a 10 μm concentration of the six PIs (APV, IDV, LPV, NFV, RTV, and SQV) on OC activity was examined. Recombinant PTH was used as a positive control. OC activity was calculated and expressed as the percentage of calcium released. Fig. 1A shows that OC activity increased in the presence of NFV (47.2%, p < 0.01), IDV (34.6%, p < 0.01), SQV (24.3%, p< 0.01), and RTV (18%, p < 0.01). APV and LPV did not alter OC activity significantly (p > 0.05), indicating that these two drugs do not alter bone resorption in ex vivo experiments.hMSCs isolated from marrow aspirates have the potential to differentiate into several mesenchymal tissues, including bone, cartilage, adipose, tendon, muscle, and marrow stroma (Ref. 15Pittenger M.F. Mackay A.M. Beck S.C. Jaiswal R.K. Douglas R. Mosca J.D. Moorman M.A. Simonetti D.W. Craig S. Marshak D.R. Science. 1999; 284: 143-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (17773) Google Scholar;i.e. adipocytic, chondrocytic, and osteogenic lineages). After exposure to OS medium, hMSCs deposit a calcium-enriched matrix after 15 days. This deposit is readily measured using a sensitive colorimetric calcium assay (18Bruder S.P. Jaiswal N. Haynesworth S.E. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 64: 278-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (1268) Google Scholar). In the absence of OS, hMSCs do not deposit detectable amounts of calcium during cell culture. hMSCs were exposed to 10–20 μm PIs in OS medium, and mineralization of the extracellular matrix was measured (Fig. 1B). Calcium accumulation was inhibited in hMSCs treated with 10 μmNFV (37.6%, p = 0.016) and LPV (20.89%,p = 0.057; see Fig. 1B). Other PIs did not alter calcium accumulation significantly (p > 0.05). These results indicate that some PIs accelerate bone resorption by increasing OC activity (NFV, SQV, IDV, and RTV), and some PIs inhibit bone formation and calcium deposition (NFV and LPV) by decreasing OB activity.Osteoprotegrin ligand (OPGL) binds and activates the receptor-activated NF-κB on the surface of the OC (19Kong Y.Y. Feige U. Sarosi I. Bolon B. Tafuri A. Morony S. Capparelli C., Li, J. Elliott R. McCabe S. Wong T. Campagnuolo G. Moran E. Bogoch E.R. Van G. Nguyen L.T. Ohashi P.S. Lacey D.L. Fish E. Boyle W.J. Penninger J.M. Nature. 1999; 402: 304-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (1580) Google Scholar). Osteoprotegrin (OPG) is a member of the soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 family expressed by the OB and is a soluble decoy receptor for OPGL. OPG sequesters OPGL, thereby preventing binding to receptor-activated NF-κB, OC activity, and bone resorption. Decreases in OPG expression by an osteoblast will lead to an increase in osteoclast activity due to the increased availability and hence binding of OPGL to the osteoclast. Gene expression of OPG was measured in hMSCs induced to differentiate into OBs for 16 days in the presence of 5–10 μm PIs (Fig. 1C). Treatment with 5 μm NFV decreased OPG expression by ∼50% (p = 0.04) compared with Me2SO-treated control cells. LPV (10 μm) also decreased OPG expression significantly (33%, p = 0.03), whereas the other PIs did not (p > 0.05). These results indicate that some PIs (NFV and LPV) alter expression of OPG and bone formation/resorption pathways, while other PIs do not alter these pathways ex vivo. One hypothesis is that the decreased osteogenesis and OPG expression could lead to increased osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption potentially explaining an underlying mechanism associated with NFV treatment. However, these data also indicate that not all PIs activate the OPG/OPGL receptor pathway in osteoblasts, and there may be other unknown mechanisms by which these PIs (e.g. RTV, IDV, and SQV) stimulate osteoclast activity in the rat calvaria assay.Select PIs Inhibit Osteogenesis in hMSCsTo further assess the effects of HIV PIs on osteogenic differentiation, hMSCs were cultured in the presence of various PIs under conditions permissive for osteogenesis (15Pittenger M.F. Mackay A.M. Beck S.C. Jaiswal R.K. Douglas R. Mosca J.D. Moorman M.A. Simonetti D.W. Craig S. Marshak D.R. Science. 1999; 284: 143-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (17773) Google Scholar). Osteogenic differentiation is associated with increased ALP activity, calcium accumulation, increased expression of osteogenic genes, and morphological change (spindle shape becomes cuboidal; Refs. 14Jaiswal N. Haynesworth S.E. Caplan A.I. Bruder S.P. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 64: 295-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (1817) Google Scholar and 18Bruder S.P. Jaiswal N. Haynesworth S.E. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 64: 278-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (1268) Google Scholar). Exposure to OS medium for 8 days results in a significant increase in ALP activity, and ALP activity continues to increase linearly for the next 8 days (14Jaiswal N. Haynesworth S.E. Caplan A.I. Bruder S.P. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 64: 295-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (1817) Google Scholar, 18Bruder S.P. Jaiswal N. Haynesworth S.E. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 64: 278-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (1268) Google Scholar). ALP activity was measured on Day 14 after hMSCs were treated with 10 μmHIV PIs in OS medium (control cells were treated with Me2SO). ALP activity was significantly inhibited (p < 0.01) in the presence of NFV (>63%), SQV (53%), LPV (48.8%), and RTV (29.5%, p < 0.05, Fig. 2A). Other PIs did not alter ALP activity significantly (APV and IDV by 20%, p > 0.05), indicating that PIs have pharmacologically distinct effects on osteogenic differentiation ex vivo. ALP gene expression was examined in differentiated hMSCs on Day 16 after exposure to PIs in OS medium. ALP gene transcription decreased significantly in the presence of LPV, NFV, and RTV (p < 0.03); a smaller decrease in ALP transcription was observed in IDV- and APV-treated cells (p> 0.05) (Fig. 2B). Upon microscopic examination, there was a 10–50% reduction in the total number of cells in the NFV- (and to a certain degree LPV-) but not the other PI-treated cells in addition to the decrease in the total number of cells stained positive for ALP enzyme activity as visualized by light microscopy (Fig. 2C). Likewise NFV has demonstrated cellular toxicity under some in vitro conditions as reported by Dowell et al. (20Dowell P. Flexner C. Kwitervich P.O. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41325-41332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar).Figure 2Select protease inhibitors inhibit ALP activity. hMSCs were differentiated into osteoblasts in the presence of 5 μm NFV or a 10 μmconcentration of all other PIs.

Szalkowski D., Li, Z. Berger J. Moller D.E. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1999; 84: 4274-4277Crossref Scopus (148) Google Scholar). These studies indicate that different PIs have different effects on adipocyte function and differentiation. In this study, we utilized the inherent properties of a select population of bone marrow cells, the hMSCs, to study the effect of PIs on adipocyte formation and degradation.The effects of PIs on hMSC adipocyte differentiation were examined in the presence of 10–20 μm PIs. Adipogenic differentiation was assessed on Day 11 by measuring total lipid accumulation (Fig. 3A). Total lipid accumulation was significantly reduced in the presence of 20 μm SQV (59.2%, p < 0.001) and NFV (51.6%, p< 0.001) and moderately by LPV (48.8%, p < 0.01) and RTV (44%, p < 0.01). We previously demonstrated that select PIs stimulate lipolysis in murine adipocytes (13Lenhard J.M. Furfine E.S. Jain R.G. Ittoop O. Orband-Miller L.A. Blanchard S.G. Paulik M.A. Weiel J.E. Antivir. Res. 2000; 47: 121-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Lipolysis was also measured in fully differentiated hMSC adipocytes exposed to PIs for 18–24 h (data not shown) at multiple doses. Free fatty acids were released in a dose-dependent manner in cells treated with >20 μm NFV. No other PIs increased lipolysis, indicating that different PIs alter fat metabolism within the bone marrow through different mechanisms.Figure 3Effects of PIs on adipogenesis. hMSCs were differentiated into adipocytes with an adipogenic mixture in the presence PIs. A, triglyceride accumulation was measured on Day 11 of differentiation in the presence of 20 μm PIs. The means and S.D. are representative data (each point determined in triplicate) for two or more independent experiments. B, expression of adipogenic markers was measured on Day 14 of differentiation in the presence of 5 μm NFV and a 10 μm concentration of all other PIs. The vehicle control was 0.1% Me2SO. DGAT expression was determined by Taqman/RT-PCR. For each treatment three different RNA samples were isolated, and each one was analyzed in duplicate during the real time PCR. Results from each group were averaged and compared with untreated cells to provide a p value using the Student's t test.

DMSO, Me2SO.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Adipocyte differentiation involves changes in expression of certain genes essential for lipid metabolism. Therefore, RT-PCR was used to measure expression of diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT) and lipoprotein lipase (LPL) in hMSCs differentiating into adipocytes that were exposed to PIs. DGAT expression decreased in the presence of 5 μm NFV (Fig. 3B), whereas the other PIs did not have a significant effect. NFV caused a similar decrease in expression of LPL (data not shown). This is consistent with our previous observation that NFV decreases LPL expression in differentiating murine adipocytes (13Lenhard J.M. Furfine E.S. Jain R.G. Ittoop O. Orband-Miller L.A. Blanchard S.G. Paulik M.A. Weiel J.E. Antivir. Res. 2000; 47: 121-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations suggest that the loss of fat in subjects receiving HAART may, in part, be due to decreased expression of genes involved in lipogenesis and increased lipolysis.In summary, this study demonstrates that select PIs alter OC, OB, and adipocyte activity and differentiation ex vivo. The observation that LPV, NFV, and SQV inhibit both osteogenesis and adipogenesis in hMSCs suggests that bone and fat metabolism may be coordinately down-regulated in the bone marrow potentially contributing to altered bone mineral density. Direct effects of PIs on OCs may contribute also to the altered bone mineral density associated with HAART. Not all PIs exhibited the same effects ex vivo, indicating that different PIs have distinct effects on bone and fat metabolism. For example, LPV decreased OPG expression, inhibited calcium accumulation by hMSC osteoblasts, and decreased adipogenesis; however, it did not alter rodent calvaria OC activity. In the case of IDV, OC activity increased significantly, but no change was observed in OB ALP activity, hMSC calcium accumulation, or adipogenesis. This suggests that LPV and IDV may have selective effects on bone formation and resorption, respectively. Interestingly NFV had properties similar to both LPV and IDV. NFV significantly increased osteoclast activity in the calvaria assay and decreased calcium accumulation and OPG expression in the hMSC osteoblasts. Taken together, these data show that individual PIs have distinct effects on bone and fat metabolism, and the structural differences between PIs could help explain the variability observed in clinical reports. Currently limited clinical data are available on BMD measurements on select PI-containing HAART regimens. In contrast to Tebas et al. (5Tebas P. Powderly W.G. Claxton S. Marin D. Tantisiriwat W. Teitelbaum S.L. Yarasheski K.E. AIDS. 2000; 14: F63-F67Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar), Nolan et al. (10Nolan D. Upton R. John M. McKinnon E. James I. Adler B. Roff G. Vasikaran S.

In a prospective study on subjects receiving an APV-containing regimen (n = 14) there was an increase in the total body bone mineral content by 0.04 ± 0.01 kg (p = 0.02) over 48 weeks (22Dube, M.

Type 1 PDZ domains usually require valine, leucine, or isoleucine at the very COOH-terminal (P0) position, and serine or threonine 2 residues upstream at P−2. We quantitatively defined the contributions of carboxyl-terminal residues to binding selectivity of the prototypic interactions of the PDZ domains of postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95) and its homolog synapse-associated protein 90 (SAP102) with the NR2b subunit of theN-methyl-d-aspartate-type glutamate receptor.

The subunits of the Shaker K+channel and NMDA receptor that bind to the first two PDZ domains of PSD-95, SAP102, and PSD-93 have the sequence E(S/T)DV-COOH. The co-crystal structure of the third PDZ domain of PSD-95 and a peptide ligand derived from the very COOH terminus of CRIPT (TKNYKQTSV-COOH) has been solved (23Doyle D.A. Lee A. Lewis J. Kim E. Sheng M. MacKinnon R. Cell. 1996; 85: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar). This work showed that the very COOH-terminal valine and the threonine two positions upstream (the 0- and −2-positions P0 and P−2, respectively) form crucial interactions in the PDZ domain binding pocket. Thus, the minimal consensus sequence for binding to the PSD-95 PDZ domains has been defined as an (S/T)XV motif, where X can represent any residue. However, it is clear that other residues must contribute to specificity for a given PDZ domain, because various proteins and ion channels that have an (S/T)XV motif do not bind any of the PDZ domains of PSD-95 under conditions under which the other ligands do. Examples include the neuronal inwardly rectifying K+ channels Kir3.2 and Kir3.3 (COOH-terminal sequence is in both cases ESKV (24Nehring R.B. Wischmeyer E. Doring F. Veh R.W. Sheng M. Karschin A. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 156-162Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)); the Na+ channel Nav1.5 (ESIV (25Gee S.H. Quenneville S. Lombardo C.R. Chabot J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14638-14646Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar)), which is present not only in muscle but also brain (26Hartmann H.A. Colom L.V. Sutherland M.L. Noebels J.L. Nat.

Furthermore, the β1 adrenergic receptor does not interact with the first two PDZ domains of PSD-95 although it does conform to the (S/T)XV motif (SKV (28Hu L.A. Tang Y. Miller W.E. Cong M. Lau A.G.

This receptor does, however, bind to the third PDZ domain of PSD-95 (28Hu L.A. Tang Y. Miller W.E. Cong M. Lau A.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Hall R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38659-38666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). This PDZ domain possesses a binding preference that is quite different from the first two PDZ domains (e.g. see Ref. 12Niethammer M. Valtschanoff J.G. Kapoor T.M. Allison D.W. Weinberg R.J. Craig A.M. Sheng M. Neuron. 1998; 20: 693-707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) of PSD-95 and does not interact with NR2 subunits (9Kornau H.C. Schenker L.T.

Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2157-2163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or Shaker-type K+ channels (10Kim E. Niethammer M. Rothschild A. Jan Y.N. Sheng M. Nature. 1995; 378: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar). Similarly, Neuroligin carries the sequence TRV at its COOH terminus but only interacts with the third and not the first two PDZ domains of PSD-95 (30Irie M. Hata Y. Takeuchi M. Ichtchenko K. Toyoda A. Hirao K. Takai Y. Rosahl T.W. Sudhof T.C. Science. 1997; 277: 1511-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). PDZ domains can be broadly divided into several categories, based on their general ligand specificity. Type I PDZ domains, found on PSD-95 and its homologs, bind (S/T)X(V/I/L) COOH termini, whereas type II PDZ domains (e.g. the fourth and fifth PDZ domain of GRIP and the PDZ domain of CASK), bind an Φ-X-Φ motif, where Φ represents a hydrophobic residue (preferably tyrosine or phenylalanine at P−2) (31Daniels D.L. Cohen A.R. Anderson J.M. Brunger A.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 317-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 32Songyang Z. Fanning A.S., Fu, C., Xu, J. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Crompton A. Chan A.C. Anderson J.M. Cantley L.C. Science. 1997; 275: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1224) Google Scholar). A third type of PDZ domain present in neuronal nitric-oxide synthase shows a preference for aspartate at P−2 (DXV motif) (33Stricker N.L. Christopherson K.S., Yi, B.A. Schatz P.J. Raab R.W. Dawes G. Bassett D.E., Jr. Bredt D.S. Li M. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 336-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 34Tochio H. Zhang Q. Mandal P., Li, M. Zhang M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 417-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), although it also accepts other residues at P−2 (e.g. isoleucine (35Jaffrey S.R. Snowman A.M. Eliasson M.J. Cohen N.A. Snyder S.H. Neuron. 1998; 20: 115-124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar)). Additionally, another kind of binding has been described and is exemplified by an internal (non COOH-terminal) sequence in neuronal nitric-oxide synthase that binds to syntrophin's PDZ domain and the second PDZ domain of PSD-95 (7Brenman J.E. Christopherson K.S. Craven S.E. McGee A.W. Bredt D.S. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 7407-7415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Hillier B.J. Christopherson K.S. Prehoda K.E. Bredt D.S. Lim W.A. Science. 1999; 284: 812-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). The interaction between the NMDA receptor NR2b subunits and PSD-95 is one of the best defined PDZ domain interactions. The NMDA receptor is critical for a number of neuronal functions such as synaptic transmission and synaptic plasticity. PSD-95 and its homologs may be crucial for the assembly of postsynaptic proteins and signal transduction involving the NMDA receptor (8Kim E. Cho K.-O. Rothschild A. Sheng M. Neuron. 1996; 17: 103-113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar, 13Chen H.-J. Rojas-Soto M. Oguni A. Kennedy M.B.

Grant S.G. Nature. 1998; 396: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar). Therefore, we evaluated the role of the various residues at the very COOH terminus of the NMDA receptor in determining the affinity and specificity of its interaction with PSD-95 and its relative, SAP102. Various combinatorial methods have been employed to study the specificity of PDZ domains. The yeast two-hybrid method has been used extensively in the characterization of PDZ domains and their selectivity. But although it is a powerful and sensitive assay, it is prone to give a high background of false positives and is only useful for a qualitative assessment of binding. Precise affinity determinations are not possible. Oriented peptide libraries have been used to determine the consensus binding sequence for a variety of PDZ domains (32Songyang Z. Fanning A.S., Fu, C., Xu, J. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Crompton A. Chan A.C. Anderson J.M. Cantley L.C. Science. 1997; 275: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1224) Google Scholar). Different PDZ domains were immobilized and incubated with batches of solubilized peptide libraries. Peptides retained by the PDZ domains were sequenced, and the frequency of residues at each position was quantified. An increase in the probability for a given residue at a certain position by a factor of 1.5 was considered to be significant. This method can reveal preferences of the various PDZ domains for certain residues at a given position but does not allow quantitative comparisons of affinities of defined peptides. Because this method does not determine actual sequences of any of the PDZ domain-binding peptides, it does not permit judgment of whether a preference for a residue at one position is linked to the presence of another residue at another position. Furthermore, the method used by Songyang et al. (32Songyang Z. Fanning A.S., Fu, C., Xu, J. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Crompton A. Chan A.C. Anderson J.M. Cantley L.C. Science. 1997; 275: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1224) Google Scholar) is best suited for detecting preferences critical at a given position for high affinity binding. However, it would be difficult if not impossible to determine with this method whether certain residues are forbidden at a given position if this position accepts most of the other residues. Most recently, a COOH-terminal phage display has been used to explore the specificity of the seven PDZ domains of the human homologue of InaD (39Vaccaro P. Brannetti B. Montecchi-Palaizz L. Philipp S. Helmer Citterich M. Cesareni G. Dente L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42122-42130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). This approach identified putative consensus binding sequences for each PDZ domain, although many interactions may have been of low affinity, perhaps withKD values above 10 μm, because the high display density on the phage surface may have resulted in avidity effects (39Vaccaro P. Brannetti B. Montecchi-Palaizz L. Philipp S. Helmer Citterich M. Cesareni G. Dente L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42122-42130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). As for the other methods, it is not possible to determine affinities of the phage-displayed peptides and compare the precise contribution of each residue. To understand how each position in the PDZ binding motif may contribute to the affinity for the PDZ domain, we used several different libraries of selected peptides based on the COOH terminus of the NR2b subunit of the NMDA receptor to identify the important positions and residues involved in the binding of NR2b to the PDZ domains of PSD-95 and SAP102. The use of solid-phase colorimetric and in-solution fluorescence polarimetric peptide binding assays allowed us to quantitatively determine the effects of amino acid substitutions at various positions along the peptide sequence on PDZ domain binding. We were surprised by a strong, often severalfold preference of the first two PDZ domains of PSD-95 and of SAP102 for valine at the 0-position over the related amino acids leucine and isoleucine, for threonine at the −2-position over serine, and for glutamate and glutamine at the −3-position over aspartate. Analysis of the human genome indicated that besides NMDA receptor NR2 subunits and K+ channels of the Shaker-type Kv1 family, only a limited number of other neuronal proteins possess COOH termini that would predict a strong interaction with the first two PDZ domains of PSD-95 or SAP102. Despite the large number of proteins with COOH-terminal (S/T)XV motifs that can potentially bind to PDZ domains, our analysis indicates a clear selectivity of specific PDZ domains for a limited number of proteins. NH2-terminal GST fusion proteins of the second PDZ domain of rat PSD-95 (residues 154–248) and those carrying residues 142–235 (PDZ1), 237–333 (PDZ2), and 399–485 (PDZ3) of rat SAP102 were expressed from a modified pGEX2T vector named pGHEB and kindly provided by Dr. Craig C. Garner (University of Alabama, Birmingham, AL). To create vectors for the expression of GST fusion proteins of the first and third PDZ domain of PSD-95, cDNA sequences encoding human PSD-95 residues 82–202 (PDZ1) and 344–443 (PDZ3; residue numbers refer to full-length human PSD-95 sequence as given in Ref. 40Stathakis D.G. Hoover K.B. You Z. Bryant P.J. Genomics. 1997; 44: 71-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) were excised with EcoRI from corresponding GAD10 vectors, which contained the respective sequences that had originally been inserted into the GAD10EcoRI cloning sites (10Kim E. Niethammer M. Rothschild A. Jan Y.N. Sheng M. Nature. 1995; 378: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar) (kindly provided by Morgan Sheng, MIT, Cambridge, MA). The latter two protein sequences are completely identical to residues 39–159 and 301–400 encoding the first and third PDZ domain of rat PSD-95, respectively. DNA fragments were purified by agarose gel electrophoresis and ligated into EcoRI-digested pGEX 4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences) before screening the resulting clones for correct orientation of the inserts. All vectors were confirmed by DNA sequencing with the AmpliTaq system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Fusion proteins were expressed and purified as described (41Leonard A.S. Davare M.A. Horne M.C.

The vector DNA was electroporated into theE. coli strain BL21 λ-DE3 cells. 50-ml cultures were grown overnight, diluted 1:10 with LB medium, and incubated until the cultures reached an A600 of 1.0 (2–4 h). Fusion protein expression was induced with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (100 μm, 2 h). Cells were harvested; resuspended in TBS (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl); digested with lysozyme; supplemented with 10 mm EDTA, 15 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors (0.2 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 0.1 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.1 μg/ml aprotinin); and lysed by adding 1.5% (final concentration) sarkosyl (43Frangioni J.V. Neel B.G. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 210: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar), followed by sonication. Lysates were clarified by ultracentrifugation (45-Ti rotor, 40,000 rpm, 186,000 × g, 1 h). Sarkosyl was neutralized by adding 2–4% (final concentration) Triton X-100 from a 20% stock solution. Lysates were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose (AmershamBiosciences) overnight at 4 °C. Resins were washed with TBS and eluted by adding 15 mm glutathione in 150 mmNaCl, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8. The fusion proteins were dialyzed against TBS and subsequently quantified by determiningA280 and, in parallel, by the bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce) and a Coomassie assay (Pierce) in microtiter plate format. The purity and quality of all fusion proteins was evaluated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and detection by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue and by immunoblotting with anti-GST antibodies to ensure minimal degradation. Purified GST fusion proteins usually did not show contamination with other proteins by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining and were discarded otherwise. Peptides based on the NR2b COOH terminus and the COOH termini of other potential PDZ ligands were synthesized manually using a Multipin Peptide Synthesis kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Chiron-Mimotopes) (44Geysen H.M. Meloen R.H. Barteling S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 3998-4002Crossref PubMed Scopus (1281) Google Scholar). This method utilizes standard solid phase peptide synthesis with Fmoc-protected amino acids, followed by deprotection and cleavage of the peptide from the solid-phase support with trifluoroacetic acid. We typically synthesized peptides using a 96-well plate array of polystyrene pins serving as the solid phase support. After cleavage, peptides were cleaned with two ether/petroleum ether extractions to remove leftover protecting groups. The remaining trifluoroacetic acid was eliminated by dissolving the peptide in water/acetic acid/acetonitrile followed by lyophilization. Peptides were dissolved in water and stored frozen until used. All peptides contained at their NH2 termini a lysine, followed by a serine-glycine spacer. The NH2-terminal lysine residue was modified with a biotin or fluorescein tag (Fmoc-biotinyl-lysine and Fmoc-fluoresceinyl-lysine were from Anaspec). The NH2-terminal tag-KSG sequences were followed by 11 residues corresponding to the wild type (WT) or modified COOH termini of NR2b and of other PDZ-binding proteins. Selected peptides were analyzed by mass spectrometry, and all of the peptides were quantified with a BCA assay. Saturation binding curves for PDZ domain-peptide interactions were determined by examining the change in fluorescence polarization (FP) (45Lynch B.A. Loiacono K.A. Tiong C.L. Adams S.E. MacNeil I.A. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 247: 77-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) of a fixed concentration of the various fluorescein-labeled peptides (100 nm) with increasing amounts of a GST-PDZ domain fusion protein. Peptides and fusion proteins were diluted using TBS with 1% bovine serum albumin to prevent absorption of the peptide to the plate. After combining the fluorescent peptide and PDZ domain in a black 384-well plate and allowing the system to come to equilibrium (1–2 h), the plate was read on a Victor2 V (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) plate reader in the fluorescence polarimeter mode to obtain polarization values (P). P is calculated according to the equation P = (Iv − g *Ih)/(Iv + g *Ih), with Iv and Ih corresponding to the vertical and horizontal fluorescence intensities, respectively; g is a calibration correction, obtained from reading the polarization value of a 100 nm fluorescein solution, which possesses a Pvalue of 0.027 under our conditions at room temperature. Theg value is calculated from the equation g = (Iv0/Ih0) * (1 − 0.027/1 + 0.027), where Iv0 and Ih0 are the vertical and horizontal fluorescent intensities of the fluorescein solution in TBS plus 1% bovine serum albumin. The P values of fluorescent peptide solutions without PDZ domains were subtracted from the P values obtained by titrations with PDZ domains. The resulting Pvalues were plotted against the concentration of the PDZ domain. To determine the KD value, a curve was fitted by the equation Y = B *X/(KD + X), with Bbeing the maximum P value that would be reached at saturation as indicated by the extrapolation of the fitted curve. Streptavidin-coated 96-well microtiter plates (Pierce) were incubated with 1% bovine serum albumin in TBS and subsequently with saturating amounts of biotinylated peptides. After two washing steps with TBS to remove any unbound peptide, GST-PDZ domain fusion proteins were added in TBS at varying concentrations and allowed to incubate for 1–2 h. Following two quick washing steps with TBS, bound GST fusion proteins were detected by incubation with anti-GST antibodies (41Leonard A.S. Davare M.A. Horne M.C. Garner C.C. Hell J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19518-19524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar) for ½ h, washed twice with 0.1% Triton X-100 in TBS, and incubated with Protein A coupled to horseradish peroxidase (HRP; 1:10,000 in TBS) for ½ h. After washing with 0.1% Triton X-100 in TBS, 100 μl of the colorimetric HRP substrate solution “Slow-TMB” (Pierce) was added to each well. After 5 min, the reaction was stopped with 100 μl of 1 mH2SO4, and the plate was read at 650 nm. The protease inhibitors pepstatin A (1 μg/ml), leupeptin (10 μg/ml), aprotinin (20 μg/ml), phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (200 nm), and calpain inhibitor I and II (8 μg/ml each) were present in all extracts. Membrane fractions were prepared from whole rat brain, extracted with 1% deoxycholate at pH 8.5 (and, in some cases, 1% Triton X-100 or 1% SDS), and cleared by ultracentrifugation as described (41Leonard A.S.

https://openalex.org/W2043422501,"Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a human RNA virus containing three open reading frames. Of these, ORF1encodes the viral nonstructural polyprotein; ORF2 encodes the major capsid protein, which exists in a glycosylated and non-glycosylated form; and ORF3 codes for a phosphoprotein of undefined function. Using fluorescence-based colocalization, yeast two-hybrid experiments, transiently transfected COS-1 cell co-immunoprecipitation, and cell-free coupled transcription-translation techniques, we have shown that the ORF3 protein interacts with the ORF2 protein. The domains involved in this ORF2-ORF3 association have been identified and mapped. Our deletion analysis showed that a 25-amino acid region (residues 57–81) of the ORF3 protein is required for this interaction. Using a Mexican HEV isolate, site-directed mutagenesis of ORF3, and a phosphatase digestion assay, we showed that the ORF2-ORF3 interaction is dependent upon the phosphorylation at Ser80 of ORF3. Finally, using COS-1 cell immunoprecipitation experiments, we found that the phosphorylated ORF3 protein preferentially interacts with the non-glycosylated ORF2 protein. These findings were confirmed using tunicamycin inhibition, point mutants, and deletion mutants expressing only non-glycosylated ORF2. ORF3 maps in the structural region of the HEV genome and now interacts with the major capsid protein, ORF2, in a post-translational modification-dependent manner. Such an interaction of ORF2 with ORF3 suggests a possible well regulated role for ORF3 in HEV structural assembly. Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a human RNA virus containing three open reading frames.

Finally, using COS-1 cell immunoprecipitation experiments, we found that the phosphorylated ORF3 protein preferentially interacts with the non-glycosylated ORF2 protein. These findings were confirmed using tunicamycin inhibition, point mutants, and deletion mutants expressing only non-glycosylated ORF2. ORF3 maps in the structural region of the HEV genome and now interacts with the major capsid protein, ORF2, in a post-translational modification-dependent manner. Such an interaction of ORF2 with ORF3 suggests a possible well regulated role for ORF3 in HEV structural assembly. hepatitis E virus open reading frame virus-like particles Src homology 3 mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphate-buffered saline synthetic dextrose 3-amino-1,2,3-triazole 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside binding domain activation domain nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid glutathioneS-transferase yeast extract/peptone/dextrose Hepatitis E is an acute disease endemic in many countries throughout developing parts of the world, in particular on the continents of Africa and Asia, where it causes epidemics and sporadic infections.

HEV is an RNA virus with a positive-sense genome ∼7.2 kb in length with three open reading frames (ORF1, ORF2, andORF3) encoding three different proteins (2Tam A.W. Smith M.M. Guerra M.E. Huang C.-C.

In the absence of a reliable in vitro culture system for HEV, fundamental studies on its replication and expression strategy have not been undertaken. ORF2 and ORF3 have been expressed in Escherichia coli, animal cells, baculovirus, and yeast and in vitro in a coupled transcription-translation system (7Khudyakov Y.E. Favorov M.O. Jue D.L. Hine T.K.

ORF2 encodes the major HEV structural protein, which has been shown to be an 88-kDa glycoprotein that is expressed intracellularly as well as on the cell surface. It is synthesized as a precursor and is processed through signal sequence cleavage into the mature protein, which is capable of self-association (12Tsarev S.A. Tsareva T.S. Emerson S.U. Kapikian A.Z.

When expressed through the baculoviral expression system, ORF2 was shown to assemble into virus-like particles (VLPs), which were cell-associated as well as secreted in the culture medium (14Khudyakov Y.E.

ORF3 encodes a small 13.5-kDa phosphoprotein that is expressed intracellularly and shows no major processing. It associates with the cytoskeletal and membrane fractions of cells (16Aye T.T.

Virol. 1997; 71: 9045-9053Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, the ORF3 protein has been shown to dimerize in a yeast cellular environment, and its dimerization domain has been mapped to a 43-amino acid region overlapping the SH3 binding and phosphorylation domains (13Tyagi S. Jameel S. Lal S.K. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 2493-2498Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Furthermore, ORF3 has been recently shown to interact with SH3 domains and to activate MAPK (18Korkaya H. Jameel S. Gupta D. Tyagi S. Kumar R. Zafrullah M. Mazumdar M. Lal S.K. Xiaofang L. Sehgal D. Das S.R. Sahal D. J. Biol.

Although ORF3 is located in the 3′-third of the genome and has been termed a structural protein, there is no evidence to date for its involvement in HEV structural assembly. Because ORF2 is the major capsid protein, we undertook studies to examine colocalization of ORF2 and ORF3 in transfected cells and to test for heterotypic interactions between these two viral proteins to evaluate a structural role for ORF3. In the few years since its introduction, the yeast two-hybrid system has proven invaluable for studying physical interactions between genetically defined partners, for identifying contacts among the subunits of multiprotein complexes (19Chien C.T.

In this system, two plasmid-borne gene fusions are cotransformed into yeast cells, and the interaction between these two fusion proteins is measured by the reconstitution of a functional transcriptional activator that triggers the expression of reporter geneslacZ and HIS3. We have used the yeast two-hybrid system along with fluorescence-based colocalization experiments, transiently transfected COS-1 cell immunoprecipitation, and coupled transcription-translation techniques to show the interaction of ORF3 with ORF2. We have further mapped the interaction domain of ORF3 to a 25-amino acid region. Within this region, we have shown that a single amino acid (Ser80) is responsible for this heterotypic protein-protein interaction. Ser80 has been shown to be the site for phosphorylation of ORF3. Our yeast two-hybrid analysis using a Mexican HEV isolate, site-directed mutagenesis, and a phosphatase digestion assay revealed that the ORF2-ORF3 interaction is phosphorylation-dependent. Finally, using immunoprecipitation experiments, followed by tunicamycin inhibition, point mutations, and deletion mutations expressing only the non-glycosylated form of ORF2, we have shown that phosphorylated ORF3 preferentially interacts with non-glycosylated ORF2. A possible role of ORF3 in a post-translational modification-dependent interaction with ORF2 is discussed in light of our results. All strains, plasmids, and plasmid constructs used in this study are described in Table I. The full-length ORF2 and ORF3genes of HEV were excised from the pMT-ORF2 and pSG-ORF3 vectors (9Jameel S. Zafrullah M. Ozdener M.H. Panda S.K. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 207-216Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,25Zafrullah M. Ozdener M.H. Kumar R. Panda S.K. Jameel S. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 4074-4082Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), respectively, and cloned into the yeast two-hybrid vectors, resulting in an N-terminal in-frame fusion with either the GAL4 DNA-binding or activation domain. DNA manipulations were carried out as described by Sambrook et al. (26Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). All deletion constructs were generated by subcloning the full-length ORF2 andORF3 genes of HEV and are described in Table I. Plasmid constructs not containing fully compatible ends were screened for the correct reading frame by sequencing, whereas all other constructs with fully compatible ends were verified by restriction digestion and sequencing.Table IYeast strains, plasmids, and recombinant plasmid constructs used in this studyStrain/plasmid/constructGenotype/description/referenceStrains Y190MATa trp1–901 his3 leu2–3,112 ura3–52 ade2 ga14 ga180URA3::GAL-lacZ LYS2::GAL-HIS3 PJ69–4a MAT a trp1–901 leu2–3,112 ura3–52 his3–200 ga14Δga180ΔLys2::GAL1-HIS3 GAL2-ADE2 met2::GAL7-lacZ PJ69–4α MATα trp1–901 leu2–3,112 ura3–52 his3–200 ga14Δga180ΔLyS2::GAL1-HIS3 GAL2-ADE2 met2::GAL7-lacZPlasmids pGAD424/pACT2GAL4 AD vector (GAL4(768–881));LEU2, 2μm, Ampr pGBT9/pAS2GAL4 DNA-BD vector (GAL4(1–147)); TRP1, 2μm, AmprConstructs pGBT9-ORF3pSG-ORF3 digested withSmaI and BamHI, fragment ligated pGAD424-ORF3pSG-ORF3 digested with SmaI andBamHI, fragment ligated pAS2-ORF2pMT-ORF2 digested with NcoI and BamHI, fragment ligated pACT2-ORF2pMT-ORF2 digested with NcoI andBamHI, fragment ligated pAS2-ORF3pGBT9-ORF3 digested with SmaI and BamHI, fragment ligated pGBT9-ORF3-(1–57)pGBT9-ORF3 digested with BstEII and BamHI and religated pGBT9-ORF3-(57–123)pGBT9-ORF3 digested withBstEII and EcoRI and religated pGBT9-ORF3-(1–81)pGBT9-ORF3 digested with EagI and BamHI and religated pGBT9-ORF3-(83–123)pGBT9-ORF3 digested with EagI and EcoRI and religated pGBT9-ORF3-(57–81)pGBT9-ORF3(57–123) digested withEagI and SalI and religated pAS2-ORF2-(1–230)pAS2-ORF2 digested with EcoRI and BamHI and religated pAS2-ORF2-(231–660)pAS2-ORF2 digested with EcoRI and BamHI, fragment religated pACT2-ORF2-(1–508)pACT2-ORF2 digested with BssHI and BamHI and religated pACT2-ORF2-(510–660)pACT2-ORF2 digested withBssHI and NcoI and religated pRSET-ORF2Ref. 9Jameel S.

The cells were blocked with 5% normal goat serum for 2 h at room temperature and then incubated with appropriately diluted primary antibodies in PBS and 0.5% Tween 20 (PBST) containing 1% normal goat serum for 2 h at room temperature. The primary antibodies used were mouse monoclonal anti-ORF3 antibody (1:200 to 1:500 dilution) and rabbit polyclonal anti-ORF2 antibody (1:100 to 1:200 dilution). Cells were washed three times with PBST for 5 min each and then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with a 1:1000 dilution of conjugated secondary antibodies. For colocalization experiments, the secondary antibodies used were goat anti-mouse IgG coupled to Alexa 488 dye and goat anti-rabbit IgG coupled to Alexa 594 dye (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). These were chosen to label the ORF3 protein with Alexa 488 (green) and the ORF2 protein with Alexa 594 (red). Cells were washed as described above and mounted in 90% glycerol in PBS. Fluorescence images were collected using a 60× or 100× planapo objective in a Bio-Rad 1024 LSM attached to a Nikon inverted microscope. To prevent cross-talk in dual labeling experiments, only one dye was excited at a time, keeping the other channel completely closed. The images were processed using Confocal Assistant, followed by Adobe Photoshop Version 5.0. The GAL4-based two-hybrid system (kindly provided by Dr. Stephen Elledge) contained pAS2 (DNA-binding domain vector) and pACT2 (activation domain vector), together with yeast reporter Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain Y190 (see Table I). The host strain containing pAS2-SNF1 and pACT2-SNF4 was used as a positive control (27Harper J.W. Adami G.R. Wei N. Keyomarsi K. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 805-816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5248) Google Scholar). The Y190 host contains integrated copies of both HIS3 and lacZ reporter genes under the control of GAL4-binding sites. The Y190 yeast strain was transformed with the appropriate plasmids using the lithium acetate procedure and grown on synthetic dextrose (SD) plates in the absence of Trp and Leu (SDTrp− and SDLeu−, respectively). Protein interaction was tested on SD plates without Leu, Trp, and His (SDLeu−Trp−His−). After 3 days at 30 °C, individual colonies were streaked out and tested by liquid and filter-lift β-galactosidase assays, 3-amino-1,2,3-triazole (3-AT) assay (50 mm), and diploid His assay. The filter β-galactosidase assay, a parameter directly reflecting the strength of protein-protein interactions, was performed by streaking doubly transformed yeast colonies onto filter paper and allowing them to grow for 2 days on selection medium. Yeast cells were permeabilized by freezing yeast-impregnated filters in liquid nitrogen and thawing at room temperature. This filter was placed over a second filter that was presoaked in 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 300 mg/ml X-gal and 0.27% β-mercaptoethanol. Filters were left for 48 h to develop a blue color, which indicated a positive protein-protein interaction. Liquid β-galactosidase activity was determined using the substrate X-gal as described previously (28Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990Google Scholar, 29Bai C. Elledge S.J. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 273: 331-347Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Relative enzymatic activity was determined in five independent transformants. Data for quantitative assays were corrected for yeast cell number and are the mean ± S.E. of triplicate assays. Appropriate positive/negative controls and buffer blanks were used. The Y190 host strain containing pAS2-SNF1 and pACT2-SNF4 was used as a positive control (27Harper J.W. Adami G.R. Wei N. Keyomarsi K. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 805-816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5248) Google Scholar). The specificity of thein vivo protein-protein interaction was confirmed using a yeast genetic assay for reconfirming positive two-hybrid interactions (30Tyagi S. Lal S.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 277: 589-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 31Tyagi S. Jameel S. Lal S.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 284: 614-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Plasmid constructs were extracted from the positive Y190 cotransformants (BD-ORF3/AD-ORF2, clones 1 and 2). The plasmids isolated from these clones were separated and verified using E. coli HB101 cells on M9 synthetic medium lacking Leu. Subsequently, these plasmids were singly transformed into the PJ69–4a and PJ69–4α haploid yeast strains (32James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After genetic crossing, the His3 prototrophy of the diploid strains was tested by plating for growth on SD plates in the absence of His (SDHis−). All possible control transformations were conducted and were verified to be negative for His3 prototrophy. The full-length ORF2 protein (pRSET-ORF2, encoding 660 amino acids of ORF2 with an N-terminal His6 tag) and [35S]methionine-radiolabeled full-length ORF3 protein (123 amino acids), along with its deletion mutations (see Table I), were expressed in separate reactions using an in vitrocoupled transcription-translation system (TNT coupled reticulocyte lysate system, Promega) following the manufacturer's instructions. The unlabeled ORF2 protein was then bound to Ni2+-NTA beads (Amersham Biosciences) and washed three times with PBS (pH 7.4). [35S]Methionine-labeled ORF3 protein (full-length or deletion mutation) was then added to the same tube and incubated for 4 h at 4 °C with gentle shaking. The beads were washed three times with PBS, resuspended in 10 ml of SDS-PAGE loading buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, 0.1% bromphenol blue, and 10% glycerol), and boiled for 4 min to dissociate the bound proteins. Aliquots (10 μl) of the supernatants were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and the [35S]methionine-labeled proteins were detected by autoradiography. COS-1 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 20 μg/ml gentamycin. Cells were transfected at a confluency of ∼50% with plasmid DNA using Lipofectin (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's guidelines. For each 60-mm diameter culture dish, 2.5 μg of DNA and 10 μl of Lipofectin were used in 1.2 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without serum or antibiotics, and DNA uptake was allowed to proceed for 6 h at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator. Forty hours post-transfection, cells were washed with 3 ml of methionine-deficient Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) and metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine (Amersham Biosciences), with each 60-mm diameter plate receiving 100 μCi of label in 1 ml of methionine-deficient Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. After 4 h of labeling, cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and harvested for further analysis. In addition to HEV ORF-containing expression plasmids, each experiment also included a control (or mock) transfection, in which the same amount of the parent vector (pSGI) was used. For phosphate labeling, at 40–44 h post-transfection, cells on 60-mm plates were washed once with phosphate-deficient Dulbecco's minimal essential medium (Invitrogen) and incubated in 3 ml of deficient medium for 1 h. Following this step, each plate was labeled for 4 h in a CO2 incubator at 37 °C with 250 μCi of [32P]orthophosphate (Amersham Biosciences or PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in 1 ml of deficient medium. PBS-washed transfected COS-1 cells were harvested directly in 0.5 ml of GST binding buffer (20 mmTris (pH 7.9), 180 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mm dithiothreitol containing 1 μg/ml bovine serum albumin) after incubation on ice for 15 min. Lysates were clarified at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was incubated on ice for 1 h with 5 μl of rabbit antiserum. To this were added 100 μl of a 10% suspension of GST buffer-washed protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences), and the mixture was incubated with constant shaking at 4 °C for 1 h. The beads were washed five times, each time with 0.5 ml of GST buffer, after being centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 s. Washed beads were resuspended in 50 μl of SDS-PAGE loading buffer, heated at 100 °C for 4 min, and centrifuged, and the supernatant was subjected to SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Lysates from cells transfected with the ORF3 expression vectors and labeled with [32P] were subjected to immunoprecipitation with rabbit polyclonal anti-ORF3 antibody as described above. The immunoprecipitates were washed once with 250 μl of λ-protein phosphatase reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 5 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm MnCl2, and 100 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). The washed immunoprecipitates were resuspended in 50 μl of λ-protein phosphatase reaction buffer with or without 1 μl of λ-protein phosphatase (400,000 units/ml; New England Biolabs Inc.) and incubated for 1 h at 30 °C. A control reaction with the same amount of 35S-labeled ORF3 was also conducted to test for protein stability, against λ-protein phosphatase treatment. After washing the beads with GST binding buffer once, clarified cell lysate containing 35S-labeled ORF2 was applied to the tube with phosphatase-treated ORF3 and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h with gentle shaking. The beads were washed five times with GST binding buffer. A control reaction with the same amount of immunoprecipitated 32P-labeled ORF3 was subjected to the same treatment to show that ORF2 was capable of binding under the above experimental conditions. The beads were centrifuged, resuspended in SDS-PAGE loading buffer, heated at 100 °C for 4 min, and centrifuged, and the supernatant was subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by autoradiography. Dual labeling immunofluorescence microscopy revealed colocalization of ORF3 and ORF2 in COS-1 cells transiently transfected with the expression vectors pMT-ORF3 and pMT-ORF2 (Fig.1). The distribution of ORF3 in these cells was cytoplasmic and displayed punctate green staining (Fig. 1,ORF3–488). Distribution of ORF2 was observed in the cytoplasm, too, and was denser around the nucleus, possibly in the endoplasmic reticulum, and stained red (Fig. 1, ORF2–594). Both proteins colocalized in the cytoplasm and did not aggregate in the nucleus or other organelles as shown in yellow (Fig. 1,MERGE). With these initial results showing colocalization of both ORF2 and ORF3, we decided to test the heterotypic interactions of these two HEV structural proteins in vivo and in vitro. The full-length ORF2 gene was cloned into the yeast two-hybrid vector containing the GAL4 DNA-binding domain, resulting in the expression of a fusion protein with ORF2 fused to the C terminus of the GAL4 DNA-binding domain. Similarly, the full-lengthORF3 gene was cloned in-frame into the two-hybrid vector containing the GAL4 activation domain, resulting in the expression of a fusion protein with ORF3 fused to the C terminus of the GAL4 activation domain (Table I). Cotransformation ofS. cerevisiae with plasmids encoding BD-ORF3 and AD-ORF3 induced strong GAL4-dependent HIS3 andlacZ expression as determined by growth on SDTrp−Leu−His− dropout medium and the blue color from filter-lift β-galactosidase assays, respectively (Fig. 2). The yeast extract/peptone/dextrose (YPD) plate (Fig. 2 B) showed unrestricted growth of all transformants shown in the template (Fig.2 A). Neither plasmid alone induced HIS3 orlacZ expression in yeast. Single transformants, the host strain, and the BD-SNF1/AD-SNF4-positive control (27Harper J.W. Adami G.R. Wei N. Keyomarsi K. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 805-816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5248) Google Scholar) were plated on all the restrictive media plates (Fig. 2, C–E). Only transformants that possessed the BD plasmid or constructs containing it grew on SDTrp− plates (Fig. 2 C), whereas only transformants containing the AD plasmid or constructs derived from it grew on SDLeu− plates (Fig. 2 D). Only the positive control (BD-SNF1/AD-SNF4) and the transformants containing both BD-ORF2 and AD-ORF3 were able to grow on SDTrp−Leu−His− plates (Fig.2 E). The second reporter gene (lacZ) was also tested for expression by a filter-lift assay, resulting in a blue color for the positive cotransformants and the positive control (Fig.2 F). Liquid β-galactosidase activity was determined for the positive clones along with all appropriate negative and positive controls using the substrate chlorophenol red β-d-galactopyranoside. The mean relative β-galactosidase activities are shown in Fig.3 A. The host strain (Y190) along with transformants with single plasmids (AD-ORF2 and BD-ORF3) showed negligible β-galactosidase activity. Cotransformants containing none or one of the two ORFs (BD/AD, BD/AD-ORF2, and BD-ORF3/AD) also showed negligible β-galactosidase activity; however, cotransformants containing AD-ORF2 and BD-ORF3 together showed a high β-galactosidase response. We further investigated the level of activation of the HIS3reporter genes for the full-length ORF2-ORF3 interaction in the presence of 50 mm 3-AT. Hundredfold serial dilutions of log-phase cultures of Y190 strains expressing BD-SNF1 and AD-SNF4 (BD-SNF1/AD-SNF4) and AD-ORF2 and BD-ORF3 (BD-ORF3/AD-ORF2) along with appropriate controls were plated on YPD, SDHis−, and SDHis− plus 50 mm3-AT (Fig. 3 B). These results indicate the strength of the protein-protein interactions as a function of His prototrophy. The BD-ORF3/AD-ORF2 cotransformants showed growth up to a 10−4-fold dilution on the SDHis− plus 50 mm 3-AT plate. This experiment showed that the ORF2-ORF3 interaction is strong and true. The specificity of the ORF2-ORF3 interaction was also confirmed using a yeast genetic approach (30Tyagi S. Lal S.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 277: 589-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). After genetic crossing of the single transformants (haploids), the His3 prototrophy of the diploid strains (a/α) was tested. Only the diploids containing both BD-ORF3 and AD-ORF2 (BD-ORF3/AD-ORF2) showed a positive phenotype, similar to the positive diploid control (BD-SNF1/AD-SNF4) (Fig.4). From all the above experiments, we conclude that the two HEV proteins ORF2 and ORF3 interact with each other in a yeast two-hybrid system. To characterize th"

A single CTD phosphatase, Fcp1, has been identified in yeast and metazoans. Here we conducted a biochemical characterization of Fcp1 from the fission yeastSchizosaccharomyces pombe. The 723-amino acid Fcp1 protein was expressed at high levels in bacteria. Recombinant Fcp1 catalyzed the metal-dependent hydrolysis ofpara-nitrophenyl phosphate with a pH optimum of 5.5 (kcat = 2 s−1;Km = 19 mm). Deletion analysis showed that 139- and 143-amino acid segments could be deleted from the N and C termini of Fcp1, respectively, without affecting phosphatase activity. A segment containing amino acids 487–580, deletion of which abolished activity, embraces a BRCT domain present in all known Fcp1 orthologs. Mutations of residues Asp170 and Asp172 abrogated Fcp1 phosphatase activity; the essential aspartates are located within a170DXDXT172 motif that defines a superfamily of metal-dependent phosphotransferases. We exploited defined synthetic CTD phosphopeptide substrates to show for the first time that: (i) Fcp1 CTD phosphatase activity is not confined to native polymerase II and (ii) Fcp1 displays an inherent preference for a particular CTD phosphorylation array. Using equivalent concentrations (25 μm) of CTD peptides of identical amino acid sequence and phosphoserine content, which differed only in the positions of phosphoserine within the heptad, we found that Fcp1 was 10-fold more active in dephosphorylating Ser2-PO4 than Ser5-PO4.

C-terminal domain polymerase p-nitrophenyl phosphate p-nitrophenol The C-terminal domain (CTD)1 of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (pol II) serves as a landing pad for macromolecular assemblies that regulate mRNA synthesis and processing (1Hirose Y. Manley J.L. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1415-1429Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The CTD is composed of a tandemly repeated heptad motif (consensus sequence YSPTSPS). The mammalian pol II CTD has 52 heptad repeats, the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe CTD has 29 repeats, and the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiaeCTD has 26–27 copies. The CTD undergoes a cycle of extensive phosphorylation and dephosphorylation at positions Ser5 and Ser2, which is coordinated with the transcription cycle (2Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19009-19012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). The CTD phosphorylation state is also responsive to developmental cues (3Palancade B. Dubois M.F. Dahmus M.E. Bensaude O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6359-6368Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Multiple CTD kinases are present in eukaryotic cells, e.g. budding yeast has four CTD kinases (4Murray S. Udupam R. Yoa S. Hartzog G. Prelich G. Mol. Cell.

The potential complexity of the CTD serine phosphorylation array comprises 22n different structures, wheren is the number of heptad repeats. Thus, there is ample opportunity to fine tune the putative effector functions of the CTD by remodeling the phosphorylation array, a process that would entail changing the balance between the activities of the CTD kinases and phosphatases at either some or all of the serine phosphorylation sites. The functional effects of varying the phosphorylation array are seen clearly in the case of the mammalian mRNA capping enzyme, Mce1. Binding of Mce1 to defined CTD phosphopeptides containing phosphoserine at position 5 stimulates the catalytic activity of the guanylyltransferase domain, and the extent of stimulation increases with the number of Ser5-PO4 heptad repeats (11Ho C.K. Shuman S. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 405-411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Mce1 also binds to the CTD phosphorylated on Ser2, but this interaction has no effect on guanylyltransferase activity (11Ho C.K. Shuman S. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 405-411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Thus, the total number of CTD phosphates and their position in the heptad determine allosteric effects on an mRNA processing enzyme. In vivo studies confirm that recruitment of the capping apparatus to the pol II elongation complex requires the action of the TFIIH-associated CTD kinase Kin28, which specifically phosphorylates Ser5 (12Schroeder S.

Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2452-2460Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar). Although it has been suggested that dephosphorylation of Ser5 during transcription elongation facilitates recycling of the capping apparatus, there are differing views as to whether Fcp1 is the enzyme responsible for that dephosphorylation step (12Schroeder S.

Early biochemical studies established that Fcp1 phosphatase activity depends on a divalent cation cofactor (5Chambers R.S. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26243-26248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Chambers R.S. Kane C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24498-24504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Fcp1 action on pol II is typically measured by conversion of the phosphorylated IIo isoform of the large subunit to the IIa form that migrates more rapidly during SDS-PAGE (5Chambers R.S. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26243-26248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The large subunit is detected by Western blotting or by prior labeling of the pol II substrate with 32P. Studies of the yeast phosphatase employed the TFIIH-associated kinase to 32P-label the CTD, presumably exclusively at Ser5 (6Chambers R.S. Kane C.M. J. Biol.

The fact that the yeast Fcp1 preparation effected the release of32P from this pol II substrate would suggest that Fcp1 is capable of dephosphorylating Ser5. Whereas human Fcp1 was able to dephosphorylate either free pol IIo or pol IIo in the context of the transcription elongation complex (9Cho H. Kim T. Mancebo H. Lane W.S. Flores O. Reinberg D.

The inference from these data was that binding to a non-CTD site on pol II was required for CTD phosphatase function. Several groups have demonstrated the presence of Fcp1 in a complex with pol II (7Archambault J. Chambers R.S. Kobor M.S., Ho, Y. Cartier M. Bolotin D. Andrews B. Kane C.M. Greenblatt J. Proc. Natl.

Fcp1 also binds to the RAP74 subunit of TFIIF, which results in a stimulation of CTD phosphatase activity (6Chambers R.S. Kane C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24498-24504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 18Chambers R.S. Wang B.Q. Burton Z.F. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol.

Recombinant S. cerevisiae Fcp1per se was capable of dephosphorylating pol II that was32P-labeled in vitro with the TFIIH kinase; however, the reaction required stoichiometric concentrations of Fcp1 (15Kobor M.S.

Cell. 1999; 4: 55-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Recombinant S. cerevisiae Fcp1 also catalyzed dephosphorylation of p-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNØP), albeit at high substrate concentrations and with a low turnover number (15Kobor M.S. Archambault J. Lester W. Holstege F.C.P. Gileadi O. Lansma D.B. Jennngs E.G. Kouyoumdjian F. Davidson A.R. Young R.A. Greenblatt J. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 55-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Here we conducted a biochemical characterization of the Fcp1 ortholog of the fission yeast S. pombe. The S. pombe Fcp1 cDNA encodes a predicted 723-amino acid polypeptide related to the Fcp1 proteins from S. cerevisiae, humans, and other metazoan species; the extent of sequence conservation is highest in a putative catalytic module spanning residues 140–326 of S. pombe Fcp1 (Fig. 1). Our interest in the fission yeast enzyme stems from our prior work on the interactions of theS. pombe capping enzymes with the phosphorylated CTD (19Pei Y. Hausmann S., Ho, C.K. Schwer B. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28075-28082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). We anticipated that knowledge of the enzymology of CTD dephosphorylation in S. pombe would illuminate the potential influence of Fcp1 on the association of the capping enzymes with the pol II elongation complex. We show that S. pombe Fcp1 can be expressed at high levels in bacteria as a soluble catalytically active phosphatase and purified conveniently by affinity chromatography. We characterize its activity using both pNØP and synthetic CTD phosphopeptides as substrates. Fcp1 displays a distinctive acidic pH optimum at 5.5, and there is considerably less activity at pH 7.5–8.0, which are the conditions used in all previously reported studies of Fcp1 activity. We find that whereas purified Fcp1 readily dephosphorylates CTD phosphopeptides consisting of four heptad repeats containing only Ser2-PO4, it is an order of magnitude less active on a CTD substrate containing only Ser5-PO4. Thus, Fcp1 activity is not confined to native pol II, and it displays an intrinsic preference for action at certain phosphorylation arrays. Preferential action of Fcp1 at Ser2-PO4 is consistent with the recent finding that conditional mutations in yeast Fcp1 lead to increased levels of CTD Ser2 phosphorylation in vivo (14Cho E.J. Kobor M.S. Kim M. Greenblatt J. Buratowski S. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3319-3329Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). S. pombeFcp1 was produced in Escherichia coli as a His10-tagged fusion as follows. Thefcp1+ coding sequence (GenBankTMaccession AL390814) was PCR-amplified from a S. pombecDNA library using primers designed to introduce an NcoI site at the translation start codon, a glycine codon following the start codon, and a BamHI site 3′ of the stop codon. The PCR product was restricted with NcoI and BamHI and then inserted between the NcoI and BamHI sites of the yeast vector pYN132 (CEN TRP1). After sequencing thefcp1+ insert to confirm that no other coding changes were introduced compared the sequence in GenBankTM, the insert was excised with NcoI and BamHI and inserted between the NcoI and BamHI sites of a customized bacterial expression vector pET16m (a derivative of pET16b) so as to fuse the Fcp1 protein in-frame with an N-terminal 14-amino acid leader peptide (MGHHHHHHHHHHSA). The pET-Fcp1 plasmid was transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3)-RIL (Stratagene). A 500-ml culture was grown at 37 °C in LB medium containing 0.1 mg/ml ampicillin and 50 μg/ml chloramphenicol until theA600 reached 0.6. The culture was adjusted to 0.2 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and 2% ethanol, and incubation was continued for 20 h at 17 °C. The cells were harvested by centrifugation and stored at −80 °C. All of the subsequent procedures were performed at 4 °C. Thawed bacteria were resuspended in 25 ml of buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol). Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and lysozyme were added to final concentrations of 500 μm and 100 μg/ml, respectively. After incubation on ice for 30 min, Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 0.1%, and the lysate was sonicated to reduce viscosity. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation for 45 min at 18,000 rpm in a Sorvall SS34 rotor. The soluble extract was mixed for 30 min with 4 ml of Ni+2-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) that had been equilibrated with buffer A containing 0.1% Triton X-100. The slurry was poured into a column, and the resin was washed serially with 20-ml aliquots of buffer A containing 0.1% Triton X-100 plus 5 or 10 mm imidazole. Fcp1 was then step-eluted with 250 mm imidazole in buffer A. The enzyme preparation (15–20 mg of protein) was dialyzed against buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 0.01% Triton X-100 and stored at −80 °C. The protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad dye binding method with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Amino acid substitution mutations D170A, D170N, D170E, D172A, D172N, and D172E (and diagnostic restriction sites) were introduced into thefcp1+ cDNA by the two-stage overlap extension method (20Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar). pET-Fcp1 was used as the template for the first stage amplification. The mutated full-length cDNAs generated in the second stage amplification were digested with NcoI and BamHI and then inserted into pET16m. The inserts of the resulting pET-Fcp1* plasmids were sequenced completely to confirm the desired mutations and exclude the acquisition of unwanted changes during amplification or cloning. The pET-Fcp1* plasmids were introduced into E. coli BL21(DE3)-RIL, and the mutant Fcp1 proteins were purified from soluble bacterial lysates using the same protocol described for the wild-type Fcp1. N-terminal deletion mutants were constructed by PCR amplification with mutagenic sense-strand primers that introduced an NcoI restriction site and a methionine codon in lieu of the codon for Gly106 or Gly139. C-terminal deletion mutants were constructed by PCR amplification with mutagenic antisense-strand primers that introduced a stop codon in lieu of the codons for Pro581, Lys487, or Glu400 and aBamHI site 3′ of the new stop codon. The PCR products were digested with NcoI and BamHI and then inserted into pET16m. The inserts of the resulting pET-Fcp1Δ plasmids were sequenced completely to confirm the desired mutations and exclude the acquisition of unwanted changes. The pET-Fcp1Δ plasmids were introduced into E. coli BL21(DE3)-RIL, and the truncated Fcp1 proteins were purified from soluble bacterial lysates as described for the wild-type Fcp1. An aliquot (50 μg) of the wild-type Fcp1 preparation was mixed with catalase (45 μg), bovine serum albumin (45 μg), and cytochrome c (45 μg), and the mixture was applied to a 4.8-ml 15–30% glycerol gradient containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.1 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.05% Triton X-100. The gradient was centrifuged in a SW50 rotor at 50,000 rpm for 15 h at 4 °C. Fractions (0.2 ml) were collected from the bottom of the tube. Aliquots (20 μl) of odd-numbered gradient fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Aliquots (5 μl) of every fraction were assayed for hydrolysis of pNØP. Reaction mixtures (100 μl) containing 50 mm Tris acetate (pH 5.5), 10 mmMgCl2, 10 mm pNØP, and Fcp1 as specified were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. The reactions were quenched by adding 900 μl of 1 m sodium carbonate. Release ofp-nitrophenol (pNØ) was determined by measuringA410 and extrapolating the value to a pNØ standard curve. N-terminal biotinylated CTD phosphopeptides composed of four tandem YSPTSPS repeats containing phosphoserine at either position 2, position 5, or positions 2 and 5 of each repeat were synthesized and purified as described previously (11Ho C.K. Shuman S. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 405-411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar,21Schwer B. Lehman K. Saha N. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1857-1864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). CTD phosphatase reaction mixtures (25 μl) containing 50 mm Tris acetate (pH 5.5), 10 mmMgCl2, 25 μm CTD peptide, and Fcp1 as specified were incubated for 60 min at 37 °C. The reactions were quenched by adding 0.5 or 1 ml of malachite green reagent (BIOMOL green reagent, purchased from BIOMOL Research Laboratories, Plymouth Meeting, PA). Phosphate release was determined by measuringA620 and extrapolating the value to a phosphate standard curve. TheS. pombe open reading frame encoding Fcp1 was PCR-amplified from a cDNA library and cloned into a T7 RNA polymerase-based bacterial expression vector so as to fuse the Fcp1 protein to a 14-amino acid N-terminal leader peptide containing 10 tandem histidines. The expression plasmid was introduced into E. coli BL21(DE3), a strain that contains the T7 RNA polymerase gene under the control of a lacUV5 promoter. A prominent 105-kDa polypeptide was detectable by SDS-PAGE in whole cell extracts of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-induced bacteria grown at 17 °C (not shown). This polypeptide was not present when bacteria containing the pET vector alone were induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. After centrifugal separation of the crude lysate, the Fcp1 protein was recovered in the soluble supernatant fraction and was the single most abundant polypeptide in the soluble fraction (not shown). The His tag facilitated rapid purification of the recombinant Fcp1 by adsorption to an immobilized nickel resin and subsequent elution with buffer containing imidazole. SDS-PAGE analysis of the peak imidazole eluate fraction showed that the preparation was highly enriched with respect to the 105-kDa Fcp1 polypeptide (Fig. 2A). The yield of Fcp1 was 30–40 mg of protein/liter of induced bacterial culture. The apparent size of S. pombe Fcp1 as gauged by SDS-PAGE was greater than the value of 84 kDa predicted for the His-tagged gene product. Aberrant slow electrophoretic mobility of Fcp1 has been noted for native Fcp1 purified from yeast or human cells and for recombinant versions of Fcp1 (7Archambault J. Chambers R.S. Kobor M.S., Ho, Y.

Initial characterization of the phosphatase activity of the purified recombinant Fcp1 protein was performed using 10 mm pNØP as a substrate. The pNØ reaction product was detected via its absorbance at 410 nm. We found that Fcp1 catalyzed the conversion of pNØP to pNØ and that the extent of the reaction was directly proportional to the concentration of the recombinant protein (Fig. 2B). Optimal reaction conditions were delineated via systematic variations of the pH and the concentrations of divalent cation cofactors and the pNØP substrate. The first notable finding was that the Fcp1 phosphatase activity displayed a bell-shaped pH profile with an acidic optimum at pH 5.0–5.5 (Fig. 3A). Phosphatase activity was virtually nil at lower pH (pH ≤ 4.5) and also declined sharply as the pH was increased toward neutrality. The activity of Fcp1 at pH 7.5 was 10% of the activity at pH 5.5. Hydrolysis of pNØP by S. pombe Fcp1 required a divalent cation cofactor. Magnesium supported optimal activity at 5–10 mm concentration; at lower concentrations (≤1.25 mm) activity was directly proportional to the input magnesium (Fig. 3B). Manganese and cobalt were also capable of satisfying the divalent cation requirement (Fig. 3C). The concentrations of manganese and cobalt that supported optimal activity (0.12–1 mm cobalt and 0.06–1 mm manganese) were lower than the optimal effector concentrations for magnesium. The activity levels in 1 mm cobalt and 1 mmmanganese were 60 and 35%, respectively, of the activity in 10 mm magnesium. In contrast, calcium was completely ineffective as a phosphatase cofactor up to 10 mm (Fig.3B). Our finding that calcium could not activate Fcp1 is in agreement with the findings for the human CTD phosphatase (5Chambers R.S. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26243-26248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, S. cerevisiae CTD phosphatase can be activated by calcium (6Chambers R.S. Kane C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24498-24504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The kinetic parameters were gauged by measuring the production of pNØ as a function of substrate concentration in the range of 5–40 mm pNØP. A double-reciprocal plot of the data fit well to a linear function (Fig. 3D). From these data, we calculated a Km of 19 mm pNØP and akcat of 2 s−1. The turnover number of S. pombe Fcp1 is 1000-fold higher than thekcat value of 2 × 10−3s−1 reported for the hydrolysis of pNØP by recombinantS. cerevisiae Fcp1 (15Kobor M.S. Archambault J. Lester W. Holstege F.C.P. Gileadi O. Lansma D.B. Jennngs E.G. Kouyoumdjian F. Davidson A.R. Young R.A. Greenblatt J. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 55-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The Km value of the S. cerevisiae enzyme for pNØP (60 mm) is 3-fold higher than that of S. pombe Fcp1. Increasing ionic strength exerted a modest inhibitory effect on the hydrolysis of pNØP by S. pombe Fcp1. The extents of pNØ formation in the presence of 125, 250, and 500 mm NaCl were 75, 48, and 33% of the activity in the absence of added salt (data not shown). The native size of Fcp1 was gauged by zonal velocity sedimentation through a 15–30% glycerol gradient. Marker proteins catalase (248 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), and cytochrome c (13 kDa) were included as internal standards. After centrifugation, the polypeptide compositions of the odd-numbered gradient fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig.4A). The Fcp1 polypeptide (calculated size, 84 kDa) sedimented as a single discrete peak coincident with bovine serum albumin. The phosphatase activity profile paralleled exactly the sedimentation profile of the Fcp1 polypeptide (Fig. 4B). The peak of Fcp1 activity was one fraction lighter than the bovine serum albumin peak. Centrifugation of the recombinant Fcp1 protein in a parallel gradient without marker proteins resulted in an identical single-peak profile of phosphatase activity that coincided with the distribution of the Fcp1 polypeptide (not shown). These results suggest that S. pombe Fcp1 is a monomeric protein in solution, probably with an elongated shape. Fcp1 proteins from diverse sources display extensive primary structure similarity across the region spanning S. pombe Fcp1 residues 140–326 (Fig. 1). Within this so-called Fcp1 homology domain is a short conserved peptide motif (167LIVDLDQTII176 in S. pombe Fcp1) that corresponds to the signature sequence of a family of metal-dependent phosphohydrolases and phosphotransferases (22Collet J.F.

Females that received additional food in the nestling period in one year laid eggs later in the next year compared with the control birds, whatever the degree of synchronization with the natural food abundance in the previous year. As a result, they raised their brood much later than the peak period of nestling food availability in the next year. The response to experience is adaptive for blue tits, which live in heterogeneous habitats where the peak period of food varies, but once settled will breed at the same location for life."

E2 protein binds to DNA target sequences in the viral long control regions to regulate transcription of the viral genome. It also enhances viral DNA replication by interacting with the viral replication factor E1 and recruiting it to the origin of replication and may also play a more direct role in replication. The cellular proteins with which E2 interacts to carry out these functions are largely unknown. To identify these proteins a yeast two-hybrid screen was carried out with the transcription/replication domain of HPV16 E2. This screen identified several candidate interacting partners for E2 including TopBP1 (topoisomerase IIβ-binding protein 1). TopBP1 has eight BRCA1 carboxyl-terminal domains that are found in proteins regulating the DNA damage response, transcription, and replication. Here we demonstrate that HPV16 E2 and TopBP1 interact in vitro and in vivo and that TopBP1 can enhance the ability of E2 to activate transcription and replication. This is the first time that TopBP1 has been shown to function as a transcriptional coactivator and that E2 interacts with TopBP1.

Virology. 1991; 184: 9-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar). More than 95% of cervical carcinomas harbor HPV sequences, and the most frequently detected is HPV16. The HPV16 E2 protein is a 43-kDa phosphoprotein that binds as a homodimer to 12-bp palindromic DNA sequences in the transcriptional control region of the viral genome (2Ham J. Dostatni N. Gauthier J.M. Yaniv M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 440-444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). After binding E2 can either up-regulate or repress transcription from the adjacent promoter depending upon cell type and protein levels, and this regulation controls the expression of the viral oncoproteins E6 and E7 (3Bouvard V.

As well as regulating transcription, E2 interacts with the viral replication factor E1 and recruits it to the origin of replication enhancing the ability of the E1 protein to interact with the origin (7Gillitzer E. Chen G. Stenlund A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3069-3079Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 8Berg M. Stenlund A. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 3853-3863Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Yasugi T. Benson J.D.

The E2 protein can be divided into three domains: the amino terminus, which mediates the transcription and replication properties of the protein; the carboxyl terminus, responsible for homodimerization and binding to DNA; and the hinge region between these domains, which is of indeterminate function (10Giri I.

However, to our knowledge a systematic approach to identify cellular partners for the activation domain of HPV16 E2 has not been carried out. The transcription/replication domain of HPV16 E2 can activate transcription in yeast making a traditional yeast two-hybrid screen impossible (20Lambert P.F. Dostatni N. McBride A.A. Yaniv M. Howley P.M. Arcangioli B. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 38-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar,21Morrissey L.C. Barsoum J. Androphy E.J. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 4422-4425Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To overcome this we screened several point mutants of the HPV16 E2 transactivation domain and identified a mutant, E39A (glutamic acid at position 39 mutated to an alanine) (22Sakai H. Yasugi T. Benson J.D. Dowhanick J.J. Howley P.M. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 1602-1611Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which failed to activate transcription of the GAL1 promoter in yeast but retained the ability to activate transcription in mammalian cells. Using the E39A mutant activation domain of E2 a yeast two-hybrid screen was carried out, and several candidate E2 partners were identified. One of these candidates was TopBP1, first identified as interacting with topoisomerase IIβ (23Yamane K. Kawabata M. Tsuruo T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 794-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The most striking feature of TopBP1 is that it has eight BRCT domains; these were first identified in BRCA1 and have since been detected in a host of cellular proteins (24Bork P. Hofmann K. Bucher P. Neuwald A.F. Altschul S.F. Koonin E.V. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 68-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). Most of the BRCT domain-containing proteins function in the DNA damage response pathways, although several can act as transcriptional coactivators (25Ouchi T. Monteiro A.N. August A. Aaronson S.A.

Biol. 2001; 21: 3901-3912Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). TopBP1 is an attractive candidate as a functional E2 partner for several reasons. It can interact with topoisomerase IIβ (topoisomerases are essential for transcription and replication) (28Bakshi R.P. Galande S. Muniyappa K. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2001; 36: 1-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), has a transcriptional activation domain (29Makiniemi M. Hillukkala T. Tuusa J. Reini K. Vaara M. Huang D. Pospiech H. Majuri I.

Yamamoto Y. Saunders R.D. Glover D.M. Henderson D.S. Genetics. 2000; 156: 711-721Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), TopBP1 is essential for the cell cycle (31Yamane K., Wu, X. Chen J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 555-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), and it can interact with single stranded and damaged double stranded DNA (32Yamane K. Tsuruo T. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5194-5203Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Because E2 regulates transcription and replication of the viral genome and can regulate the cell cycle (33Desaintes C. Goyat S. Garbay S. Yaniv M. Thierry F. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4538-4545Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 34Webster K. Parish J. Pandya M. Stern P.L. Clarke A.R. Gaston K. J. Biol.

Cell Growth Differ. 2001; 12: 525-534PubMed Google Scholar) these properties of TopBP1 make it an excellent candidate as an in vivo functional interacting partner for E2. Here we show that E2 interacts with the carboxyl terminus of TopBP1 in yeast, in vitro and in vivo, and coactivates transcription with E2 while having little effect upon replication. Deletion of the transcriptional activation domain from TopBP1 abolished any enhancement of E2 transcription and replication properties but failed to act as a dominant negative to block E2 function. The results demonstrate that E2 and TopBP1 can interact functionally in vivo but suggest that TopBP1 may not be essential for mediating either the transcription or replication properties of E2. The results also demonstrate for the first time that TopBP1 can act as a transcriptional coactivator when recruited to a promoter by an interacting partner, E2 in this case. A possible role for the E2-TopBP1 interaction in the viral life cycle is discussed. The Matchmaker 3 system from CLONTECH was used to carry out the two-hybrid screen. A DNA fragment encoding the first 229 amino acids of HPV16 E2 was PCR amplified and digested with EcoRI andBamHI, and these restriction enzyme sites were incorporated into the fragment using the primers. This fragment was then cloned into pGBKT7 to make the bait plasmid for the two-hybrid screen encoding a fusion between the GAL4 DNA binding domain and E2. This plasmid activated transcription in yeast making it unsuitable for use in the two-hybrid screen. Several mutants of E2 were screened for their ability to activate transcription in yeast. Using this approach we identified a mutant, glutamic acid at position 39 mutated to an alanine (E39A), which failed to activate the GAL1 promoter, driving expression of LacZ in yeast strain Y187 and HIS3 in yeast strain PJ629-2A, while still activating the GAL2 promoter driving the expression of ADE2. This mutant also maintained the ability to activate transcription in mammalian cells and was therefore used in the two-hybrid screen. The pGBKT7E2,1–229(E39A) plasmid was transfected into PJ629-2A, and the resulting transformed yeast mated with Y187 cells expressing a HeLa cDNA library fused to the GAL4 transcriptional activation domain. The ability of the resultant mated cells to grow on quadruple dropout medium (lacking ADE/HIS/LEU/TRP) was monitored. The mating efficiency of this procedure was 15% and resulted in the screening of 5 × 106 HeLa cDNAs, more than representative of the expressed human genome. From this screen only 22 clones grew, and 6 of these clones encoded the carboxyl terminus of TopBP1. C33a and U2OS cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum and were passaged routinely every 3–4 days; C33a cells were split 1 in 10 and U2OS 1 in 6. The vector isolated from the HeLa library encoding TopBP1 was pGADGH. The TopBP1 fragment was removed from this vector as an SmaI-XmnI fragment and cloned into pGADT7. As a negative control a cDNA encoding the transcriptional coactivator PC4 (36Ge H. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1994; 78: 513-523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar) was PCR amplified from HeLa cDNA and cloned into pGADT7 as an EcoRI-XmnI fragment. One of the other E2-interacting encoding cDNAs isolated in the two-hybrid screen, POMP (37Witt E. Zantopf D. Schmidt M. Kraft R. Kloetzel P.M. Kruger E. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), was removed from pGADGH as an SmaI-XmnI fragment and cloned into pGADT7 and also used in these assays. All of the vectors were sequenced to confirm the correct sequence had been cloned. To express the respective proteins all of the plasmids carrying these cDNAs were transcribedin vitro and translated using the TNT7 system from Promega. The GST-E2 proteins were prepared in the following manner. Fragments from the wild type E2 sequence were generated using PCR and cloned into pGEX4T2 as EcoRI-BamHI fragments. The restriction sites were incorporated during the PCR amplification. In this way fragments representing E2 amino acids 2–229, 25–229, and 50–229 were cloned into pGEX4T2, and the encoded fusion proteins were expressed and purified essentially as described (38Masterson P.J. Stanley M.A. Lewis A.P. Romanos M.A. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 7407-7419Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All resulting vectors were sequenced. After purification the proteins were run on SDS-PAGE, and the gels were stained with Coomassie Blue to confirm appropriate expression. A similar amount of GST fusion protein for each deletion mutant attached to beads was then mixed with 5 μl of the 50 μlin vitro transcription/translation mix (1 μg of the expression vectors was used in the in vitrotranscription/translation). GST alone was used as a control. The samples were mixed in 200 μl of pull down buffer, which was 50 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The dithiothreitol and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride were added fresh to the buffer just before use. This mixture was rotated at 4 °C for 30 min and then the beads pelleted with a brief centrifugation. The beads were then washed four times with 500 μl of pull down buffer. They were then resuspended in 1× SDS-PAGE loading buffer and then run on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis the gel was fixed in 10% methanol and 7.5% acetic acid for 1 h. The gel was then dried and exposed to film. The region encoding amino acids 861–1287 of TopBP1 was inserted into anEcoRI-XhoI-cut pGEX4T-3. The plasmid generated was pGEX4T-3TopBP1del2. Escherichia coli BL21 was transformed with pGEX4T-3TopBP1del2 and grown in 500 ml of Luria-Bertani medium, supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin, at 37 °C to an A 600 of 0.8 and induced for 5 h with 0.1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 30 °C. Cells were harvested and the bacterial pellet resuspended in 10 ml of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.7, 0.5 m NaCl, 1 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and sonicated for 40 s. The cell extract was spun at 10,000 × g for 30 min, and the cleared extract was incubated with 1.5 ml of glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (50% slurry, AmershamBiosciences) on a slowly rotating mixer for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed once with buffer C (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.7, 2 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40), once with buffer B (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.7, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40). The fusion protein was eluted from the beads by the addition of 1.5 ml of elution buffer (10 mm glutathione, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) for 30 min at room temperature. The elution step was repeated an additional two times. Eluted GST-TopBP1del2 was dialyzed against 4 liters of 50 mm Tris-HCl at 4 °C overnight, expression was confirmed by SDS-PAGE, and protein concentration determined by the BCA method. Antibodies to GST-TopBP1del2 were raised in rabbits by Scottish Diagnostics. 2 × 106 C33a cells were plated out in 100-mm2tissue culture plates. The following day the cells were mixed with 2.5 μg of pCMV-HPV16E2 expression vector in a calcium phosphate precipitation. 16 h later these cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and re-fed. 24 h after the wash the cells were harvested in the following manner. The cells were trypsinized and then washed twice with 10 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. The cell pellet was then resuspended in 1 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and transferred to a 1.5-ml Eppendorf tube and pelleted. They were then resuspended in 100 μl of lysis buffer (0.5% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 150 mm NaCl with a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) dissolved in the lysis buffer). The extracts were then incubated on ice for 30 min with occasional mixing. After this they were centrifuged in a refrigerated microfuge for 10 min at maximum speed at 4 °C. The supernatant was then removed to another tube and the cell debris discarded. 50 μl of this extract was then incubated in a total volume of 100 μl, and 1 μl of a 1:100 dilution of either rabbit α-TopBP1 serum (described above) or preimmune control serum from the same rabbit was added. This was then incubated at 4 °C with rotation for 60 min. After this, 10 μl of protein A beads (Sigma, prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions and washed in lysis buffer) was added and the extracts rotated for another 60 min at 4 °C. The beads were then pelleted and washed four times with 0.5 ml of lysis buffer and resuspended in SDS-polyacrylamide gel sample buffer and electrophoresed through an SDS-PAGE system. The gel was blotted onto membrane and probed for the presence of TopBP1 or E2. The primary antibody used to detect TopBP1 was a murine monoclonal purchased from BD Transduction Laboratories (T10620); TVG261, a kind gift from Merlin Hibma, was used to detect E2 (39Hibma M.H. Raj K. Ely S.J. Stanley M. Crawford L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 517-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). After incubation with the primary antibody a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated α-mouse IgG was added. The membrane was then developed using ECL-Plus (Amersham Biosciences) to detect the horseradish peroxidase conjugate and the membrane exposed to film. C33a and U2OS cells were transfected for the transcription assays using the same protocol. 2 × 105 cells were plated out on a 60-mm plate and transfected 24 h later using the calcium phosphate technique. The next day they were washed, and 24 h later the cells were harvested. Briefly, the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed with 300 μl of reporter lysis buffer (Promega). After a 10-min incubation the lysate was transferred into a 1.5- ml Eppendorf tube and spun in a refrigerated microfuge for 10 min at maximum speed at 4 °C. The supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube and the pellet discarded. 80 μl of the supernatant was assayed for luciferase activity using the luciferase assay system (Promega). To standardize for cell number a protein assay was carried out, and the activities shown are expressed relative to the respective protein concentrations of the samples. pGL3CONT, which contains the SV40 promoter and enhancer driving expression of the luciferase gene, was always included in a parallel transfection to confirm efficient transfection. The assays shown are representative of at least three independent experiments carried out in duplicate. The tk6xE2 luciferase reporter has been described previously (6Vance K.W. Campo M.S. Morgan I.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27839-27844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) as have the E2 (3Bouvard V. Storey A. Pim D. Banks L. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5451-5459Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) and TopBP1 (31Yamane K., Wu, X. Chen J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 555-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) expression vectors used in the transcription assays. Replication assays were carried out as a modification of a previously published technique (22Sakai H. Yasugi T. Benson J.D. Dowhanick J.J. Howley P.M. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 1602-1611Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 6 × 105 C33a or 3 × 105 U2OS cells were plated out in 100-mm2 dishes and the next day transfected using the calcium phosphate method. 3 days post-transfection low molecular weight DNA was extracted using the Hirt method. Briefly, cells were lysed in 800 μl of Hirt solution (0.6% SDS, 10 mm EDTA) and scraped into a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube. 200 μl of 5 m NaCl was added, and the samples were then left at 4 °C overnight. After centrifugation they were extracted once with phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol and precipitated with ethanol. After centrifugation the DNA pellet was washed with 70% ethanol and dried then resuspended in H2O. A quarter of the sample was digested with XmnI for 3 h. One-tenth of this digest was removed and the rest of the sample digested withDpnI. Both the single and double digested samples were separated by 1.0% agarose gel electrophoresis and analyzed by Southern blotting. Blots were probed using a 700-bp HPV16 Ori containing fragment released from p16ori-m by PvuII restriction digest and 32P radiolabeled using the Stratagene Prime-it II kit. Blots were hybridized using Quikhyb solution (Stratagene). The p16ori-m plasmid is a modified version of p16ori (22Sakai H. Yasugi T. Benson J.D. Dowhanick J.J. Howley P.M. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 1602-1611Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Using p16ori as a template and primers 5′-Oritaq (GTACGGATCCTGCACATGGGTGTGTGCAA) and 3′-Oritaq (GTACGAATTCTAACTTTCTGGGTCGCTCCTGTGATCCTG) anEcoRI-BamHI fragment was cloned into pSKII(−). This fragment represents nucleotides 7838–139 from the HPV16 genome and contains the minimal origin of replication. Additionally there is a point mutation of base 115 from C to A to create a DpnI restriction site so that this plasmid could be used in a Taqman real time PCR-based protocol to detect viral DNA replication. Quantification of single cut (input) and double cut (replicated) 3-kbp p16ori-m bands was carried out using a Storm 870 Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. Strength of replication was calculated by measuring the ratio of double cut to single cut bands. This method of measurement controls for variation in transfection efficiency. To identify cDNAs encoding cellular proteins that interact with the transcription/replication domain of E2 we carried out a yeast two-hybrid screen. Wild type E2 can activate transcription in yeast making a traditional two-hybrid screen impossible. To overcome this several point mutants of the HPV16 E2 activation domain were screened for their ability to activate transcription in yeast. These experiments identified a mutant of E2, glutamic acid at position 39 mutated to an alanine (E39A), which failed to activate the GAL1 promoter in yeast that was used in the two-hybrid screen (see “Experimental Procedures”) but retained the ability to activate transcription in mammalian cells (22Sakai H. Yasugi T. Benson J.D. Dowhanick J.J. Howley P.M. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 1602-1611Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This residue of E2 is on the outer face of the proposed structure of the E2 activation domain and is important for the interaction with the viral replication protein E1 in vitro (22Sakai H. Yasugi T. Benson J.D. Dowhanick J.J. Howley P.M. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 1602-1611Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 41Antson A.A. Burns J.E. Moroz O.V. Scott D.J. Sanders C.M. Bronstein I.B. Dodson G.G. Wilson K.S. Maitland N.J. Nature. 2000; 403: 805-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar); mutation of this residue abolishes the E2-E1 interaction and therefore abolishes viral replication mediated by E2 and E1. Using the E39A mutant we screened 5 × 106cDNAs from HeLa cells in a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify E2-interacting partners. Three of the clones isolated encoded the region of HPV18 E1 which would be predicted to interact with the wild type E2 activation domain (7Gillitzer E. Chen G. Stenlund A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3069-3079Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 8Berg M. Stenlund A. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 3853-3863Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Yasugi T. Benson J.D. Sakai H. Vidal M. Howley P.M. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 891-899Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HeLa cells are derived from a cervical carcinoma harboring HPV18 DNA, and the detection of the E1 protein therefore served as an excellent internal control to confirm that this screen was sensitive and able to identify biologically important E2-interacting partners. As stated above mutation of residue 39 from a glutamic acid to an alanine abolishes the interaction between E2 and E1 in vitro. Clearly the yeast two-hybrid screen is more sensitive at detecting the interaction between these two viral proteins than previously used methods (22Sakai H. Yasugi T. Benson J.D. Dowhanick J.J. Howley P.M. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 1602-1611Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Six of the other clones isolated in the screen encoded the carboxyl terminus of TopBP1 (Fig.1), a protein containing eight BRCT domains (23Yamane K. Kawabata M. Tsuruo T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 794-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). After the identification of interacting proteins in yeast it is important to confirm that these proteins can interact directlyin vitro. To do this a GST fusion protein was prepared which encoded the wild type transcription/replication domain of HPV16 E2. The carboxyl-terminal portion of TopBP1 which interacts with E2 in yeast was translated in vitro and labeled with [35S]methionine. These two molecules were used in a GST pull down assay, and as shown in Fig.2 a there was a specific interaction between the GST-E2 fusion protein and the carboxyl terminus of TopBP1 (lane 6). GST alone did not interact with TopBP1 (lane 3), and the unrelated transcriptional coactivator PC4 (36Ge H. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1994; 78: 513-523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar) did not interact with the E2 activation domain (lane 5). Another of the E2-interacting proteins isolated in the yeast two-hybrid screen, 2W. Boner and I. M. Morgan, in preparation. POMP (37Witt E. Zantopf D. Schmidt M. Kraft R. Kloetzel P.M. Kruger E. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), also had a specific interaction with E2 (lane 4 versus lane 1). The GST-E2 fusion protein used in these pull down assays encoded the wild type E2 activation domain, demonstrating that TopBP1 interacts with wild type E2 and is not an artifact of interacting with the E39A mutant. Deletion of the amino-terminal 25 amino acids from the E2 activation domain made no difference to the interaction with TopBP1 (lane 9), whereas removal of the amino-terminal 50 amino acids substantially reduced the interaction (lane 12). This indicates that the first 50 amino acids of E2 are important for the interaction between E2 and TopBP1. However, the loss of interaction may be caused by a conformational change of E2 after the deletion of the first 50 amino acids resulting in the collapse of the TopBP1 interaction domain. To our knowledge there are no cell lines that express detectable levels of E2 protein. Therefore, to demonstrate that E2 and TopBP1 interactin vivo protein extracts were prepared from cells transfected with an E2 expression vector, and these extracts were used in coimmunoprecipitation experiments (Fig. 2 b). TopBP1 antibodies immunoprecipitated TopBP1 and coimmunoprecipitated E2 (lanes 7 and 9). Using preimmune serum there is no immunoprecipitation of TopBP1 or coimmunoprecipitation of E2. The faint bands seen with the preimmune serum (lanes 8 and10) are the result of a nonspecific interaction. Several nonspecific antibodies showed this faint band in immunoprecipitation experiments (not shown). Taken together these results demonstrate that E2 and TopBP1 can interact in yeast in vitro and in vivo in mammalian cells. The ability of TopBP1 to modulate E2 transcription/replication properties was therefore tested. C33a cells are ideal for studying transcriptional activation by E2 because they are derived from a cervical carcinoma devoid of HPV sequences. Therefore there are no additional viral proteins (such as E1) expressed in these cells which might interfere with E2-mediated transcriptional regulation, and C33a cells were used to determine whether TopBP1 could reg"

Arrest during blood flow can be supported by tumor cell interaction with attached, activated platelets. This is mediated by tumor cell integrin αvβ3 and cross-linking plasma protein ligands. To analyze the mechanism of tumor cell ligand interactions under dynamic flow conditions, we used real-time video microscopy and tested human melanoma cell binding to fibrinogen, von Willebrand Factor, or fibronectin matrices in a buffer perfusion system. When perfused at venous flow, melanoma cells arrested abruptly and began to spread immediately. This was uniquely mediated by integrin αvβ3 on all tested ligands, and required αvβ3 activation and actin polymerization. Under static conditions, αvβ3 cooperated with αvβ1 and α5β1 in supporting melanoma cell adhesion to fibronectin. But even when activated, β1 integrins did not contribute to melanoma cell arrest during flow. Soluble ligand served as a cross-linker between attached and circulating tumor cells and enhanced melanoma cell arrest. Cohesion of activated melanoma cells was restricted to the matrix surface and did not occur in suspension. We conclude that the presence of αvβ3 in a functionally activated state provides a unique advantage for circulating tumor cells by promoting tumor cell arrest in the presence of flow-dependent shear forces.

This often involves the blood stream, where circulating tumor cells are exposed to flow-dependent shear forces that physically oppose tumor cell anchorage. Tumor cell arrest within the vasculature is required for intravascular growth and extravasation within target organs of metastasis (1Al Mehdi A.B. Tozawa K. Fisher A.B. Shientag L. Lee A. Muschel R.J. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 100-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar, 2Wong C.W. Lee A. Shientag L., Yu, J. Dong Y. Kao G., Al Mehdi A.B. Bernhard E.J. Muschel R.J.

Arrest at the vessel wall depends on specific adhesive mechanisms rather than passive entrapment, because tumor cell variants that differ in their adhesion receptor outfits have distinct metastatic activities, and blocking of specific adhesion receptors can inhibit metastasis (4Orr F.W.

We showed earlier that human melanoma and breast cancer cells use integrin αvβ3 to bind to platelet integrin αIIbβ3 via cross-linking plasma protein ligands (5Felding-Habermann B. Habermann R.

Support of tumor cell-platelet interaction requires activation of integrin αvβ3. Importantly, tumor cells that stably express activated αvβ3 metastasize very aggressively, in contrast to those expressing the non-activated receptor (6Felding-Habermann B. O'Toole T.E. Smith J.W. Fransvea E. Ruggeri Z.M. Ginsberg M.H. Hughes P.E. Pampori N. Shattil S.J. Saven A. Mueller B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1853-1858Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). Thus, the regulation of αvβ3expression in tumor cells and determinants that control the activation state of the receptor may directly affect the metastatic activity of circulating tumor cells. In leukocytes and platelets, the ability to arrest within the vasculature is tightly regulated and depends on integrin activation (11Van Kooyk Y. Figdor C.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 542-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 12Woodside D.G. Liu S. Ginsberg M.H. Thromb. Haemost. 2001; 86: 316-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 13Savage B. Cattaneo M. Ruggeri Z.M. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 2001; 8: 270-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Generally, integrin activation results in increased affinity for ligand and is accompanied by conformational changes within the α/β heterodimer (12Woodside D.G. Liu S. Ginsberg M.H. Thromb. Haemost. 2001; 86: 316-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In addition, the cellular avidity of the receptors can be enhanced by controlled lateral diffusion within the plasma membrane and by interaction with the cytoskeleton (11Van Kooyk Y. Figdor C.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 542-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Integrins with increased affinity and avidity promote arrest of blood-borne cells at matrices by supporting rapid and stable receptor-matrix interaction. It is possible that the functional state of tumor cell integrins is controlled in a similar manner and determines the ability of circulating metastatic cells to arrest within the vasculature. Analysis of adhesive tumor cell functions in a blood perfusion system allowed us to identify distinct functional states of tumor cell integrin αvβ3 (6Felding-Habermann B. O'Toole T.E. Smith J.W. Fransvea E. Ruggeri Z.M. Ginsberg M.H. Hughes P.E. Pampori N. Shattil S.J. Saven A. Mueller B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1853-1858Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). When blood containing tumor cells streams past reactive matrices, a multitude of complex cell-cell and cell-ligand interactions can occur, because blood cells and plasma proteins may affect the adhesive behavior of the tumor cells. Consequences of leukocyte and platelet activation during blood flow are difficult to control individually and add to the complexity of the experimental system. We therefore simplified the analytical conditions to investigate mechanisms of tumor cell ligand interaction in the presence of flow dependent shear forces. We chose a buffer perfusion system combined with real-time video microscopy and examined adhesive interactions of human melanoma cells with individual matrix proteins under a variety of defined flow conditions. We found that integrin αvβ3 has the unique ability to support melanoma cell arrest during flow on different matrix proteins. Other αv and β1 integrins participated in melanoma cell adhesion to the same ligand(s) under stationary conditions, but were unable to contribute to melanoma cell arrest, when the cells were in motion. To support melanoma cell arrest, integrin αvβ3 had to be activated. Rapid αvβ3-ligand interaction broke the flow of circulating melanoma cells, and the receptor immediately colocalized with polymerizing actin to promote cell spreading. Soluble ligand enhanced melanoma cell arrest during flow by supporting melanoma cell cohesion at the matrix surface. This did not occur in suspension and did not interfere with cell arrest at the matrix. These findings contribute to an understanding of specific adhesive functions that characterize tumor cells, which successfully metastasize from the circulation. Function blocking monoclonal antibodies (80–100 μg/ml) were used to analyze the contribution of individual integrins to melanoma cell adhesion: VNR1 27.1 (anti-αvβ3) (14Lam S.C. Plow E.F.

The peptide antagonist GRGDSPK and control peptide GRGESPK were from The Torrey Pines Institute of Molecular Studies (La Jolla, CA). Human fibrinogen was from Enzyme Research Laboratories Inc. (South Bend, IN). The integrity of the fibrinogen Aα, Bβ, and γ chains was verified by SDS-PAGE analysis.

The cells tested free from mycoplasma during this study (Mycoplasma Plus, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). In preparation for functional tests, the cells were starved in serum-free medium overnight, harvested with EDTA (0.02% in PBS1), and resuspended in Hepes/Tyrode's buffer, pH 7.4 (10 mm Hepes, 140 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 0.4 mmNaH2PO4 × H2O, 10 mmNaHCO3, 5 mm dextrose). As specified for each experiment, MnCl2 (0.2 mm) and/or CaCl2 (1 mm) were added directly before the adhesion or perfusion assays. Melanoma cell adhesion under static conditions was measured in 48-well plates (Costar, polystyrene, non-tissue culture treated). The plates were coated overnight at 4 °C with 5–10 μg/ml fibrinogen, von Willebrand Factor, or fibronectin, and then blocked with 2% BSA (1 h at room temperature). The plates were washed, and melanoma cell suspension was added (2 × 105 in 200 μl/well) with our without function blocking antibodies or peptides. When inhibitors were used, the cells were incubated with the inhibitors for 15 min at 22 °C before adding the cell suspension to the adhesion plates. The cells were allowed to attach for various time periods at 37 °C and 5% CO2. The incubation periods were stopped by aspirating the cell suspension and removing unattached cells by three gentle washings with 200 μl of PBS. Attached cells were quantified by measuring cellular phosphatase with para-nitrophenol phosphate (5 mg/ml in 50 mm sodium acetate, 1% Triton X-100, pH 5.2) as substrate. The reaction was stopped with NaOH, and the reaction product was measured at 405 nm in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate reader. Nonspecific cell adhesion was measured on BSA-coated wells (less than 5% of adhesion on specific substrates). Given values were corrected for nonspecific binding. Tumor cell arrest during flow was measured by real-time video epifluorescence microscopy as described previously (5Felding-Habermann B. Habermann R. Saldivar E. Ruggeri Z.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5892-5900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) but with specific modifications. The melanoma cells were stained with hydroethidine (Polysciences Inc., Warrington, PA) (20 μg/ml in Hepes/Tyrode's buffer at 37 °C for 30 min) and washed twice. Glass coverslips (24 × 50 mm) were used as the bottom of a parallel plate flow chamber and coated with a 200-μl solution of fibrinogen, fibronectin (100 μg/ml), or von Willebrand Factor (20 μg/ml) in PBS, pH 7.4, at 22 °C for 2 h in a humid atmosphere. Before assembling the flow chamber, the coverslips were rinsed with Hepes/Tyrode's, the chamber filled with this buffer and connected to a pump system (Harvard Apparatus Inc., Holliston, MA). The cell suspension was prewarmed to 37 °C and kept at this temperature throughout the perfusion experiments. During the initial period of the experiments (referred to as the “ON” phase in the videos; see Supplemental Material), cell suspensions (5 × 105/ml) were perfused at a constant wall shear rate of 50 s−1. After 10 min, the cell suspension was replaced by buffer (containing the same cation concentrations as the initial cell suspension), without interrupting the flow. After 1 min of continued perfusion at 50 s−1, the wall shear rate was stepwise increased every 2 min (250, 500, 1000, and 1500 s−1) by proportionally rising the flow rate (referred to as the “OFF” phase in the videos; see Supplemental Material). During the perfusion experiments, cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions were visualized and recorded at 543/590 nm (excitation/emission, red fluorescence of the hydroethidine-stained tumor cells). Cell adhesion was quantified by directing the automated stage of the microscope to predefined positions and by automatically capturing images at the same positions, each minute during the initial ON phase of the experiment, and every other minute during the OFF phase of the experiment. Thus, the area was monitored at the same positions after it had been exposed to an increased wall shear rate for 2 min. To quantify cell adhesion and to measure the size of attached particles (single cells, or multi-cell aggregates), the captured images were analyzed by image processing (MetaMorph, Universal Imaging Corp., Downingtown, PA). The given data represent the average number of arrested cells in 5 optical fields ± standard deviation. Each experiment was carried out at least twice with very similar results. The attached videos were generated with video editing software (Premiere 6.0, Adobe Systems Inc., San Jose, CA) on a Targa 3000 editing system (Pinnacle Systems, Mountain View, CA). Deconvolution microscopy was used to analyze the localization of integrin αvβ3 in relation to polymerizing actin filaments in melanoma cells just after arrest on a matrix during flow (20Yan B. Calderwood D.A. Yaspan B. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28164-28170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Unlabeled M21 melanoma cells were perfused at a venous wall shear rate of 50 s−1 over a fibrinogen or fibronectin matrix. Briefly after starting the perfusion, the flow chamber was disassembled while submersed in perfusion buffer to avoid unwanted increase in shear exposure. The coverslips were gently rinsed, cells fixed with 3.5% formaldehyde (20 min), permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 (10 min), blocked with 2% BSA (20 min), and stained with a combination of anti-β3 mAb AV-10 (10 μg/ml) and Alexa Fluor 546-phalloidin, followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-anti mouse and nuclear stain Hoechst 33342 (14 μg/ml) (all steps at 22 °C). The coverslips were mounted onto glass slides in Prolong AntiFade mounting medium and stored at −20 °C until analyzed on a Delta Vision Optical Sectioning Microscope Model 283. Images of optical sections were acquired along the z-axis of arrested cells in 0.5-μm increments. Three sets of images were acquired at eachx, y, z position with filters set to detect green, red, or bluefluorescence. The digitized images were processed with deconvolution software softWoRx version 2.5 to reduce out-of-focus fluorescence in the three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of the combined images. To analyze the subcellular localization of integrin αvβ3 and F-actin, the specific signals were assigned pseudo colors (green for αvβ3 and red for F-actin). The distribution of green and red signal was analyzed by image processing (MetaMorph). Overlap of green and red signals, indicating colocalization of αvβ3 and F-actin, was assigned a yellow color, and the relative distribution of green, red, and yellowsignals was determined and quantified. We previously demonstrated that human tumor cells can attach to adherent, activated platelets during blood flow, and that plasma proteins are required for this interaction (5Felding-Habermann B.

To analyze the mechanism of tumor cell ligand binding during flow, we chose a buffer perfusion system and individual matrix proteins to reduce the complexity of possible cell-cell and cell-ligand interactions that can occur, when tumor cells are suspended in blood and allowed to stream past reactive surfaces. When suspended in buffer and perfused over fibrinogen, von Willebrand Factor or fibronectin matrices at a venous wall shear rate of 50 s−1 (4 dynes/cm2), M21 human melanoma cells arrested at each of these matrices. An increasing number of cells was recruited to the surface as perfusion continued (Fig. 1). Melanoma cells that came in contact with the matrix arrested abruptly without previous rolling and began to spread immediately (see video of Fig. 1 in Supplemental Material). This initial period of the experiment is referred to as the ON phase in the videos in Figs. 2 and 8(see below). To test the stability of melanoma cell attachment during flow, the cell suspension was replaced by buffer without interrupting the flow, and the wall shear rate was stepwise increased every 2 min to 250, 500, 1000, and 1500 s−1, respectively. This period of the experiment is referred to as the OFF phase in the videos in Figs. 2and 8 (see Supplemental Material). Once established, melanoma cell attachment to each of the tested matrix proteins resisted increasing wall shear rates, including those at arterial levels (1500 s−1) (Fig. 1). This indicates that melanoma adhesion receptor(s) can rapidly engage in matrix interaction and break the flow of cells, which stream past the matrix under flow conditions as found in the venous circulation.FIG. 2Integrin αvβ3mediates M21 melanoma cell arrest during flow. M21 (αvβ3 +), M21-L (αvβ3 −), or M21-L4 (αvβ3 +) cells were perfused over fibrinogen (Fg), von Willebrand Factor (VWF), or fibronectin (FN) in Hepes/Tyrode's buffer containing 0.2 mm Mn2+ at a venous wall shear rate of 50 s−1. The top panel shows images acquired during flow after 1-, 5-, 10-, and 18-min perfusion of M21 or M21-L cells over fibronectin. After 10 min, the wall shear rate was stepwise increased and reached 1500 s−1 after 18 min. In the bottom panel, M21, M21-L, or M21-L4 cells were perfused at 50 s−1 in the presence or absence of function blocking anti-αvβ3 mAb VNR1 (80 μg/ml) or GRGDSPK peptide (100 μm). M21-L4 cells are variants of M21-L, in which αvβ3 expression was restored by transfection. The experimental set-up, image acquisition during flow, and evaluation are detailed under “Experimental Procedures.” This figure includes a video (see the Supplemental Material for the video demonstration). It shows in twice the original velocity that αvβ3 supports M21 cell arrest during flow on a fibronectin matrix during venous flow and that cell arrest is stable in the presence of increasing wall shear rates up to arterial levels. A split screen shows M21 cells (αvβ3+) in the top portion and M21-L cells (αvβ3−) in the bottom portion of the screen. The first half of the videoshows the ON phase of the experiment at various time points, where the cell suspensions are perfused at a wall shear rate of 50−1. The second half of the video shows theOFF phase, where the cell suspensions were replaced by buffer without interrupting the flow, and the wall shear rates were stepwise increased.

M21 (αvβ3+) cells were perfused over a fibrinogen matrix (in 0.2 mm Mn2+) at a venous wall shear rate of 50 s−1 in the presence or absence of 0.5 mg/ml soluble fibrinogen. After 10 min, the cell suspension was replaced by buffer without interrupting the flow, and the wall shear rate was stepwise increased every 2 min. Images were acquired during flow at identical x, y positions in 1- or 2-min intervals. The experimental set-up and image processing are detailed under “Experimental Procedures.” This figure includes a video (see the Supplemental Material for the video demonstration). It shows in twice the original velocity that soluble fibrinogen enhances M21 cell arrest at a fibrinogen matrix during venous flow by supporting cell-cell cohesion at the matrix surface. It also shows that cell-matrix, but not cell-cell interaction, is stable in the presence of increasing wall shear rates.

We previously showed that integrin αvβ3 can mediate tumor cell interaction with platelets during blood flow and thereby support tumor cell arrest. To test whether αvβ3 can directly support melanoma cell arrest at immobilized matrix proteins, we compared αvβ3-expressing M21 cells against their αv-integrin lacking variant M21-L (Fig. 2 and video from Fig. 2 in Supplemental Material). The αvβ3-positive M21 cells arrested efficiently on each of the tested matrix proteins, and the attachment was resistant to increasing wall shear rates. In contrast, αvβ3-lacking M21-L cells failed to attach to any of the tested matrix proteins. The ability to arrest during flow was fully restored in M21-L4 cells, which were transfected to restore αvβ3 expression. This indicates that integrin αvβ3 function is required for melanoma cell arrest under flow conditions. This was confirmed by blocking M21 cell arrest on each of the tested matrix proteins with a function blocking anti-αvβ3 antibody. Melanoma cell arrest was also abolished in the presence of GRGDSPK peptide, indicating that the RGD recognition motif within each of the tested ligands is necessary and sufficient to support αvβ3 mediated ligand binding and cell arrest during flow (Fig. 2). Melanoma cells, specifically M21 cells, contain more than one adhesion receptor that can support cell attachment to some of the tested matrix proteins (18Cheresh D.A. Spiro R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17703-17711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Felding-Habermann B. Mueller B.M. Romerdahl C.A. Cheresh D.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 2018-2022Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Fibrinogen is recognized by αvβ3 and αvβ1, von Willebrand Factor is recognized by αvβ3, and fibronectin is recognized by αvβ1 and α5β1in addition to αvβ3 (21Marshall J.F. Rutherford D.C. McCartney A.C. Mitjans F. Goodman S.L. Hart I.R. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1227-1238PubMed Google Scholar, 22Gailit J. Clark R.A. J. Invest Dermatol. 1996; 106: 102-108Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Under stationary conditions, M21 cells attached to fibrinogen and von Willebrand Factor in a strictly αv-integrin-dependent manner, because αv-lacking M21-L cells failed to attach to these matrix proteins within the measured time period (90 min) (Fig.3). On fibronectin, αvβ3 cooperated with other integrins to support melanoma cell adhesion under static conditions. The αvβ3-positive M21 cells and αvβ3-negative M21-L cells attached to fibronectin almost equally well. In M21 cells, which express αvβ3, αvβ5, αvβ1, and α5β1, adhesion to fibronectin could not be inhibited by individual function blocking antibodies to any of these receptors. But a combination of anti-β3 and anti-α5 reduced M21 cell adhesion to fibronectin by 30%, and a combination of anti-β3 and anti-β1 antibodies reduced adhesion by more than 80%. In contrast, in M21-L cells, which express α5β1 as their only fibronectin receptor, adhesion to this protein was abolished either by function blocking anti-α5 or anti-β1 antibody (Fig. 3). This indicates that integrin αvβ3 cooperates with other αv integrins and β1 integrins in supporting M21 melanoma cell adhesion to fibronectin under static conditions. Each of these adhesion receptors was capable of supporting static adhesion, when the other receptors were inhibited. In the absence of αv integrin expression, α5β1 alone efficiently supported melanoma cell adhesion to fibronectin during stasis. Thus, while cooperating with other integrins in supporting static melanoma cell adhesion, αvβ3 is the only receptor on M21 melanoma cells that supports cell arrest under dynamic flow conditions. During stasis, melanoma cell adhesion to fibronectin was only partially inhibited by RGD peptide (Fig. 3). Integrin activation is required for leukocyte and platelet attachment during blood flow (12Woodside D.G. Liu S. Ginsberg M.H. Thromb. Haemost. 2001; 86: 316-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 13Savage B. Cattaneo M. Ruggeri Z.M. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 2001; 8: 270-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). We found earlier that arrest of blood-borne tumor cells also depends on integrin activation (6Felding-Habermann B. O'Toole T.E. Smith J.W. Fransvea E. Ruggeri Z.M. Ginsberg M.H. Hughes P.E. Pampori N. Shattil S.J. Saven A. Mueller B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1853-1858Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). To analyze directly, whether the activation state of tumor cell integrin αvβ3 determines the ability of the receptor to support cell arrest on defined matrices, we allowed αvβ3-positive M21 melanoma cells to stream past immobilized fibrinogen, von Willebrand Factor or fibronectin in the presence of Mn2+ to activate the tumor cell integrins. Control perfusions were done in Ca2+. To test, whether a general activation of integrins with Mn2+ would promote melanoma cell arrest in the absence of integrin αvβ3, we analyzed αvβ3-lacking M21-L cells under the same conditions. When perfused at a venous wall shear rate of 50 s−1, melanoma cell arrest was measurable only with αvβ3-positive M21 cells in the presence of Mn2+. Mn2+-treated M21 cells arrested efficiently on each of the tested matrix proteins. But M21 cells were unable to interact with any tested matrix when perfused in Ca2+. M21-L cells lacking αvβ3could not attach to any of the tested matrices under dynamic flow conditions, regardless of the"

J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2000; 5: 2-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). In vitro it is possible to reconstitute Fe-S apoproteins by anaerobic incubation with iron, sulfide, and a suitable reducing agent. However, because of the cellular toxicity of free iron and sulfide, it is believed that Fe-S cluster biogenesis is mediated by specific protein-protein interactions rather than by spontaneous formation. Initial identification of essential Fe-S cluster maturation components was made within thenif1 operon of Azotobacter vinelandii. Disruption of eithernifS or nifU resulted in the loss of Fe-S coordination to nitrogenase (2Jacobson M.R. Cash V.L. Weiss M.C. Laird N.F. Newton W.E. Dean D.R. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 219: 45-57Crossref Scopus (247) Google Scholar). NifS has been shown to provide sulfur equivalents by catalytic cysteine desulfurization (3Zheng L. White R.H. Cash V.L. Jack R.F. Dean D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2754-2758Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar); however, the role of NifU has yet to be firmly established. NifU is a modular protein with three domains. The amino-terminal domain has three conserved Cys and binds a labile less stable [2Fe-2S] cluster, the central region contains four conserved Cys and coordinates a stable [2Fe-2S] cluster, and the carboxyl-terminal domain has an unknown function with two conserved Cys (4Agar J.N.

Of these domains the central region has been the most thoroughly characterized. Through DNA sequencing it has been observed that nif homologues are encoded within the genomes of most organisms. These homologues have been named isc (for iron sulfurcluster) and are usually clustered together, encoding IscS, IscU, IscA, heat shock proteins HscB and HscA, and a ferredoxin (7Zheng L. Cash V.L. Flint D.H. Dean D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13264-13272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). The NifU homologue, IscU, is only homologous to the amino terminus of NifU and analogously coordinates a reductively labile [2Fe-2S] cluster (6Hwang D.M. Dempsey A. Tan K.-T. Liew C.-C. J. Mol.

Sci. 2000; 25: 352-356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Results from genetic screens of A. vinelandii, in vitro characterization of NifU/IscU chemistry, and the high degree of conservation of NifU-like proteins from divergent species have led to the hypothesis that NifU/IscU proteins, in conjunction with NifS/IscS, deliver Fe-S cluster equivalents to target Fe-S apoproteins (4Agar J.N. Krebs C. Frazzon J. Huynh B.H. Dean D.R. Johnson M.K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7856-7862Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Thermatoga maritima is a hyperthermophilic bacterium. It represents one of the deepest and most slowly evolving eubacterial lineages (11Bocchetta M. Gribaldo S. Sanangelantoni A. Cammarano P. J. Mol. Evol. 2000; 50: 366-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), with an optimal growth temperature of 80 °C (12Stetter K.O. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 18: 149-158Crossref Google Scholar). The genomic sequence shows genes encoding both IscU (Tm IscU) and IscS located next to each other, although no other iscgenes are found clustered within this region. Located elsewhere in theT. maritima genome are heat shock proteins that are homologous to those identified in other organisms (13Michelini E.T. Flynn G.C. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 4237-4244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and several ferredoxins. Additionally, T. maritima expresses a second NifS-like protein that has been crystallographically characterized (14Kaiser J.T. Clausen T. Bourenkow G.P. Bartunik H.-D. Steinbacher S. Huber R. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 451-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Possibly, the functions of the missing Isc proteins are provided by other unidentified proteins involved in iron homeostasis, as has been identified in Escherichia coli (15Muller K. Matzanke B.F.

The holo form of the native protein proved to be relatively labile, but following prior precedent (8Foster M.W. Mansy S.S. Hwang J. Penner-Hahn J.E. Surerus K.K. Cowan J.A. J. Am. Chem.

Factors that promote stabilization through this substitution will be described elsewhere. Analysis of CD spectra over a wide temperature range demonstrate Tm IscU to possess significant secondary structure that is not dependent upon the coordination of an Fe-S cluster, whereas the dispersion of resonances in 1H-15N HSQC spectra indicate significant tertiary structure. Evidence for secondary and tertiary structure was absent for the human and yeast homologues that we have examined in our laboratory, and reasons for this variation are discussed. Furthermore, Tm IscU proves to be competent for Fe-S cluster transfer to human ferredoxin (Hs Fd), consistent with a conserved role in Fe-S cluster biogenesis. This result provides strong support for a common conserved recognition mechanism for both prokaryotic and eukaryotic IscU-type proteins. 57Fe was from Pennwood Chemicals. All restriction enzymes and the copper staining kit were from Invitrogen. Pfu DNA polymerase and BL21CodonPlus(DE3)-RIL were from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA); PCR purification kit and Ni-NTA resin were purchased from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). Protein expression vectors pET21, pET28, and BL21(DE3) pLysS were from Novagen (Madison, WI). Oligonucleotides were from Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. (Coralville, IA). CM-32 and DE-52 were from Whatman (Aston, PA). Homogenous-20 precast polyacrylamide gels and G-75 and Superose-12 resins were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. T. maritima genomic DNA was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC no. 43589D). DNA (50 ng), 0.2 μm amounts of each primer, 2.5 units of clonedPfu DNA polymerase, 1× cloned Pfu buffer, and 0.2 mm each dNTP were used to amplifyiscU (TIGR locus TM1372, www.tigr.org) via PCR. Primers were: 5′-GGGCCCGGCATATGGTTTTCAAGATGATG-3′ and 5′-CCGGCCGGATCCTTAAGGCCGTGAAATCTTTTTG-3′, where underlined regions denote NdeI and BamHI sites, respectively, and the bold position indicates a G to A substitution resulting in an amino-terminal Met rather than a Val for improved recombinant expression in E. coli. The thermocycle used was identical to that described in the Pfu DNA polymerase manual (Stratagene). PCR products were digested with NdeI and BamHI and ligated to similarly treated pET21 and pET28. Cloning into pET21 yielded a construct without a tag or additional residues (pTmIscU). Cloning into pET28 resulted in the addition of an amino-terminal His tag (pTmIscUHis). The QuikChange technique (Stratagene) was employed for the D40A point mutation. Reactions contained 50 ng of template (either pTmIscU or pTmIscUHis), 2.5 units of cloned Pfu DNA polymerase, 1× cloned Pfu buffer, 0.5 mm DTT, and 125 ng of each primer.

Cloning and mutagenesis results were confirmed by nucleotide sequencing at the Ohio State University Plant-Microbe Genomics Facility. BL21CodonPlus(DE3)-RIL was used for protein expression. A 100-ml Luria-Bertani culture (supplemented with either 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 35 μg/ml chloramphenicol for pTmIscU constructs or 50 μg/ml kanamycin and 35 μg/ml chloramphenicol for pTmIscUHis constructs) was grown overnight as a starter culture. The entire starter culture was used as an inoculum for a 10-liter fermentation at the Ohio State University fermentation facility and grown to anA600 ∼ 0.6 prior to induction with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Cells were pelleted 5 h after induction and stored at –80 °C for future use. Cell pellets were resuspended in five volumes of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 20 μg/ml DNase, and 5 μg/ml RNase and lysed by sonication. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm, 4 °C for 1 h. For His-tagged constructs, the cleared lysate was applied to a Ni-NTA column equilibrated with binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 5 mm imidazole, 500 mm NaCl). The column was then washed with five column volumes of binding buffer and five volumes of binding buffer + 15 mm imidazole, and the protein was subsequently eluted with binding buffer + 100 mm imidazole. His-tagged protein was exchanged with 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, via repeated ultrafiltration (Amicon). The cleared lysate containing non-His-tagged protein was loaded onto a cation exchange column (CM32) equilibrated with 50 mmsodium phosphate, pH 7.4, and washed with one cleared lysate volume of phosphate buffer. The flow-through and wash fractions were combined. NaCl was added to 50 mm, β-mercaptoethanol was added to 5 mm, and the solution was incubated at 85 °C for 0.5 h. The sample was then centrifuged at 15,000 rpm, 4 °C for 10 min and the supernatant loaded onto an anion exchange column (DE-52). The column was washed with three column volumes of 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4. The flow-through and wash fractions were combined and concentrated via ultrafiltration. Subsequently, protein solution was loaded onto a G-75 gel filtration column equilibrated with 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4. The fractions with a λmax at 278 nm were pooled and confirmed to be pure IscU via SDS-PAGE. All apoprotein samples were stored at either 4 or –80 °C.

Molecular mass determination for extinction coefficient calculation was determined by electrospray ionization (ESI) using a Micromass Q-TOF™ II (Micromass, Wythenshawe, UK) mass spectrometer equipped with an orthogonal electrospray source (Z-spray) operated in positive ion mode. Sodium iodide was used for mass calibration for a calibration range ofm/z 100–2500. Salt buffers from the protein samples were cleaned using manual syringe protein traps from Michrom BioResources (Auburn, CA). Proteins were prepared in a solution containing 50% acetonitrile, 50% water, 0.1% formic acid at a concentration of 50 pmol/μl and infused into the electrospray source at a rate of 5–10 μl min−1. Optimal ESI conditions were: capillary voltage of 3000 V, source temperature of 110 °C, and a cone voltage of 60 V. The ESI gas was nitrogen. Q1 was set to optimally pass ions from m/z 100–2000 and all ions transmitted into the pusher region of the time-of-flight analyzer were scanned over m/z 100–3000 with a 1-s integration time. Data were acquired in continuum mode until acceptable averaged data were obtained (10–15 min). ESI data were deconvoluted using MaxEnt I provided by Micromass. In-gel tryptic digests were performed on copper-stained protein bands (5, 10, and 20 μg of WT Tm IscU) separated on a 15% SDS-PAGE gel. Incised bands were washed with 50% methanol (HPLC-grade), 5% acetic acid (JT Baker UltrexII Ultrapure) and dried in HPLC-grade acetonitrile. Samples were then reduced with DTT (5 mg/ml in 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate) and alkylated with iodoacetamide (15 mg/ml in 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate). The protein band was dehydrated with acetonitrile, rehydrated with 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate, and dehydrated again with acetonitrile. Promega modified trypsin (20 ng/μl in 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate, total addition = 50 μl) was added to each gel piece and rehydrated on ice for 10 min. Samples were centrifuged and excess trypsin solution removed. Ammonium bicarbonate (50 mm) was added to 20 μl, vortexed and centrifuged briefly, and incubated at room temperature overnight. A solution of 50% acetonitrile, 5% formic acid (EM Science ACS 88%) was added to 30 μl, vortexed for 10 min, and centrifuged. The supernatant was isolated, and an additional 30 μl of 50% acetonitrile, 5% formic acid was added, vortexed for 10 min, and centrifuged. The supernatant was analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight performed on a Reflex III (Bruker, Bremen, Germany) mass spectrometer operated in linear, positive ion mode with a N2 laser. Laser power was used at the threshold level required to generate signal. Accelerating voltage was set to 28 kV. The instrument was calibrated with protein standards bracketing the molecular weights of the protein samples (typically mixtures of bradykinin fragment 1–5 and ACTH fragment 18–39 as appropriate). Salt buffers from the protein samples were cleaned using ZipTips (Millipore, Bedford, MA) according to manufacturer directions. α-Cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid was used as the matrix and prepared as a saturated solution in 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (in water). Allotments of 1 μl of matrix and 1 μl of sample were thoroughly mixed together; 0.5 μl of this was spotted on the target plate and allowed to dry. Protein identification based on peptide masses was performed via ProFound (proteometrics.com). Protein (0.5 mm) in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm DTT was repeatedly degassed and argon-purged for 1 h. Fresh FeCl3 and Na2S were then slowly added to 1 mm. The mixture was allowed to incubate anaerobically at room temperature for 0.5 h. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm, 4 °C for 5 min. The supernatant was desalted by a G-25 column equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, or 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, and the colored protein fraction was collected. His-tagged holoprotein was concentrated and stored at –80 °C until further use. Non-His-tagged holoprotein was then loaded onto a DE-52 column equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and washed with five column volumes of the same buffer. The holoprotein was eluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl. FPLC gel filtration using a Superose-12 column (HR 16/50) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min was used for aggregation state determination. The running buffer was 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl. A Gel Filtration Calibration Kit (Amersham Biosciences) was used to calibrate the column. The standards were RNase A (13,700 Da), chymotrypsinogen A (25,000 Da), ovalbumin (43,000 Da), and albumin (67,000 Da). Blue dextrin was used to determine the dead volume. Molecular sizes were determined by plotting log Mr of standardsversus Kav whereKav = (Ve −V0)/(Vt −V0), Ve = elution volume, V0 = dead volume, Vt = total column volume. UV-visible spectra were recorded on a Hewlett-Packard 8425A diode array spectrophotometer using the On-Line Instrument Systems (OLIS) 4300S operating system software. A 1.0-cm path-length cuvette was used for all measurements. All solutions used for extinction coefficient determination were prepared in Barnstead purified deionized water. Apo D40A Tm IscU was initially dialyzed extensively against a volatile buffer (100 mmammonium bicarbonate, pH 7.0) and then against unbuffered water. Finally, the protein was passed through a G-25 column equilibrated with water. After the absorption spectrum was collected, the sample was lyophilized and the mass of the protein sample determined. Using Beer's law and the molecular mass determined by ESI, the extinction coefficient of apo D40A Tm IscU was calculated. The concentration of protein used for holo D40A Tm IscU extinction coefficient calculation was determined by incubating holo D40A Tm IscU in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA at 60 °C for 0.5 h followed by desalting via a G-25 column. Total protein concentration was then determined from the 278-nm absorption of apo D40ATm IscU using the previously determined extinction coefficient. Holoprotein (30 μm) in 100 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl was repeatedly degassed and argon-purged in a stoppered cuvette while kept on ice. Absorption data at 412 nm was acquired on a Hewlett-Packard diode array spectrometer (HP 8453) with HP8453 Win system software. Temperature control was achieved with a Peltier temperature controller (HP 8909A). Absorption data at temperatures ranging from 20 °C to 86 °C was collected at 2 °C increments with a 0.5-min equilibration period at each temperature prior to measurement. Mössbauer spectra of 57Fe D40A Tm IscUHis was recorded on a constant acceleration spectrometer, model MS-1200D from Ranger Scientific, using a Janis SuperVaritemp cryostat (model 8DT), a Lakeshore temperature controller (model 340), and a 57Co source from Isotope Products Laboratory. The57Fe-reconstituted protein was prepared as described above (see Tm IscU cluster reconstitution) except that57Fe3+ was used instead of regular FeCl3. EPR signals were recorded with an X-band Bruker ESP 300 spectrometer equipped with an Oxford liquid helium cryostat at 15 K. Holo D40A Tm IscUHis concentrations were 0.9 mm for untreated samples, and 0.4 mm for ascorbate reduced samples. Holo D40A Tm IscUHis was reduced with 0.2 mm and 2 mm ascorbate and immediately frozen. 15N-Labeled apo D40A Tm IscU was expressed in minimal medium supplemented with15NH4Cl (22Agarwal A. Tan J. Eren M. Tevlev A. Lui S.M. Cowan J.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 197: 1357-1362Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). 15N-HSQC spectra were recorded on a Bruker 600 Avance DMX spectrometer operating at 600.13 MHz. The pulse sequence was as described previously (23Bodenhausen G. Ruben D.J. Chem. Phys. Lett. 1980; 69: 185Crossref Scopus (2430) Google Scholar). A total of four scans were collected. Iron content of holo D40A TmIscU was determined by atomic absorption using a PerkinElmer Zeeman 5000 graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometer. An iron standard solution (GFS Chemicals, Inc.) was used to construct a standard curve with a r2 > 0.999. Sample loading was automated (AS40), and all data were run in duplicate and averaged. Absorption was measured at 305.9 nm and integrated for 7 s. All solutions were in Barnstead purified deionized water and 2% nitric acid. Background iron concentrations of solutions were measured and found to be negligible. Circular dichroism spectra were measured on an Aviv model 202 circular dichroism spectrometer. Far-UV CD spectra were acquired with a 0.1-mm path-length cuvette. Experimental conditions were essentially as recommended by Johnson (24Johnson W.C.J. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1990; 7: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were 0.08 mm WT and D40A Tm IscU (based on monomeric protein) and 0.15 mmHs Fd in 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 10 mm NaCl, except for holo D40A Tm IscU (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 50 mm NaCl). Spectra acquired at 20 °C were determined per 0.2 nm in triplicate and averaged. At elevated temperatures spectra were only recorded once. Secondary structure quantitation was determined via the self-consistent method (25Sreerama N. Woody R.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 242: 497-501PubMed Google Scholar) with the Dicroprot V2.5 version 5.0 package (26Deleage G. Geourjon C. Comp. Appl. Biosci. 1993; 9: 197-199PubMed Google Scholar) obtained from www.ibcp.fr. Near-UV-visible CD spectra were recorded in a 3-mm path-length cuvette/1 nm. Protein concentrations were 40 μm in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0. Buffer spectra were always subtracted. Reactions were initiated by the addition of 0.1 mm holo D40A Tm IscUHis in 50 mmsodium phosphate, pH 7.4, to a solution containing 0.1 mmhuman apoferredoxin and 5 mm DTT in the same buffer. Reactions were incubated on ice, stopped by the addition of loading buffer, and immediately frozen at –80 °C. Reaction products were separated on a 7% native-PAGE and visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. Tm IscU expression was high for all constructs in BL21CodonPlus(DE3)-RIL, greater than that obtained from BL21(DE3), with typical yields of greater than 700 mg of pure protein from a 10-liter fermentation. BL21CodonPlus(DE3)-RIL provides tRNAs for the rarely used E. coli codons of Arg, Ile, and Leu. These codons are more common inT. maritima and are found within the iscUgene. Surprisingly, expressed WT Tm IscU and His-tagged WT Tm IscU (Tm IscUHis) were observed to run as two closely spaced bands during SDS-PAGE. These bands were found in a 1:1 ratio and persisted from the time of lysis through all purification steps (Fig. 1) and give rise to similar mass spectrometric patterns (see below). Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride had no effect on the appearance or ratio of the two bands, and so they do not seem to be a result of endoproteinase activity. D40A Tm IscU and D40A TmIscUHis only expressed as one band migrating at the same position as the lighter molecular mass band of the corresponding WT protein. Apo WT and D40A Tm IscU migrated as a monomer on an analytical gel filtration column, whereas holo WT and D40ATm IscU eluted as a dimer with apparent masses of 18 and 35 kDa, respectively (Fig. 2). No high molecular mass aggregates were observed to elute. ESI spectra of each of the two bands identified by SDS-PAGE for WT Tm IscU showed the same two major peaks corresponding to full-length protein and to protein lacking the amino-terminal Met in approximately a 1:1 ratio (16,070 and 15,940 Da, respectively), whereas D40A Tm IscU showed complete loss of the amino-terminal Met with a mass of 15,893 Da. These values are in close agreement with their predicted molecular masses of 16,071, 15,940, and 15,894 Da, respectively. In-gel tryptic digests of the two bands of WT Tm IscU yielded essentially identical matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight spectra for all three protein concentrations tested, i.e. peptide fragments with identical masses were observed for both SDS-PAGE bands without the appearance or disappearance of any signal. The search engine ProFound identified both bands as consisting of TmIscU, further confirming that neither of the bands was caused by an impurity. The bacterial pellets of induced cells were dark brown in color for all constructs. Following centrifugation to remove solids, His-tagged WT and D40A Tm IscU lysates yielded a red band that was bound by a Ni-NTA column. The non-His-tagged constructs had reddish-brown lysates, but no color survived the 85 °C purification step. These results suggest proper Fe-S cluster assembly in vivo in E. coli, and that the His tag does not interfere with Fe-S cluster coordination. Although a fraction of Tm IscU expressed as holoprotein, the overall holo concentration appeared to be quite low as judged by UV-visible spectroscopy. Therefore, attempts were made to reconstituteTm IscU. Simple anaerobic incubation of either apo D40ATm IscU or D40A Tm IscUHis with DTT and a 2-fold molar excess of iron and sulfide without the presence of denaturant resulted in a deep red protein with UV-visible spectra similar to [2Fe-2S]-containing proteins (Fig. 3). Increasing the iron and sulfide concentration only resulted in the appearance of adventitiously bound iron, as judged by Mössbauer analysis (data not shown). Holo D40A Tm IscU was further purified by anion exchange chromatography. Apo D40A Tm IscU did not bind to DE-52, whereas holo D40A Tm IscU was o"
https://openalex.org/W2122653076,"Integration of the orbit of asteroid (29075) 1950 DA, which is based on radar and optical measurements spanning 51 years, reveals a 20-minute interval in March 2880 when there could be a nonnegligible probability of the 1-kilometer object colliding with Earth. Trajectory knowledge remains accurate until then because of extensive astrometric data, an inclined orbit geometry that reduces in-plane perturbations, and an orbit uncertainty space modulated by gravitational resonance. The approach distance uncertainty in 2880 is determined primarily by uncertainty in the accelerations arising from thermal re-radiation of solar energy absorbed by the asteroid. Those accelerations depend on the spin axis, composition, and surface properties of the asteroid, so that refining the collision probability may require direct inspection by a spacecraft."
https://openalex.org/W2009808438,"The Hedgehog (Hh) signaling molecule is required for the development of numerous tissues in Drosophila. Within the cell, Hh signal transduction utilizes a large protein complex consisting of the Fused (Fu), Costal2 (Cos2), and Cubitis interruptus (Ci) proteins, but the functional interactions between these proteins are still largely uncharacterized. Using a baculovirus system, we demonstrate that the serine/threonine kinase Fu phosphorylates the kinesin-like protein Cos2 when coexpressed with Cos2. Coexpression of Cos2 and a kinase-inactive version of Fu eliminates the majority of Cos2 phosphorylation. We then show that the primary Fu-induced phosphorylation site of Cos2 is serine 572, whereas serine 931 is phosphorylated to a lesser extent. Mutation of serine 572 to alanine eliminates most, but not all, specific phosphopeptides of Cos2 when coexpressed with Fu. We also demonstrate that the phosphorylation pattern of Cos2 produced by baculovirus coexpression with kinase-dead Fu is almost identical to the phosphorylation pattern of Cos2 isolated from unstimulated S2 cells. Finally, the phosphorylation pattern of Cos2 produced by baculovirus coinfection with wild-type Fu is almost identical to that of Cos2 isolated from S2 cells stimulated by Hh, indicating that phosphorylation of serines 572 and 931 is a genuine Hh signaling event. This study clarifies the unique functions of Fu and Cos2 in Hh signal transduction and identifies only the second known phosphorylation site of a kinesin-like molecule.

Hence, elucidating the mechanism of Hh signal transduction is of interest not only in the context of development but also with respect to oncogenesis and disease. Studies have revealed that Hh utilizes very unusual signal propagation and transduction mechanisms. Hh is a secreted polypeptide that is thought to be bound to the cell surface via covalently attached cholesterol and palmitic acid moieties (4Lee J.J. von Kessler D.P. Parks S. Beachy P.A.

Hh binds to the product of the patched (ptc) gene, which encodes a multiple pass transmembrane protein, and this binding appears to limit the extent of Hh signaling (22Chen Y. Struhl G.

Nature. 1989; 341: 508-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Loss of ptccauses ectopic expression of Hh target genes, indicating thatptc is a negative regulator of the Hh signaling pathway (25Forbes A.J. Nakano Y. Taylor A.M. Ingham P.W. Dev.

Nature. 1991; 353: 184-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). The transmembrane protein encoded by thesmoothened (smo) locus is thought to be the positive transducer of the Hh signal, since loss of smocauses a loss of Hh target gene expression, regardless of the presence of Ptc (28Alcedo J. Ayzenzon M. Von Ohlen T. Noll M. Hooper J.E. Cell. 1996; 86: 221-232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar, 29van den Heuvel M. Ingham P.W. Nature. 1996; 382: 547-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Since Ptc is a negative regulator of the pathway that binds Hh, whereas Smo is a positive regulator, it is thought that Ptc inhibits Smo and that binding of Hh to Ptc inhibits Ptc and thus relieves its inhibition of Smo. How the Hh signal is transduced after Smo is activated to cause transcription is a question that is only now being clarified. The distal component of the Hh signaling pathway is Cubitis interruptus (Ci), a zinc finger transcription factor (30Alexandre C. Jacinto A. Ingham P.W.

In the absence of Hh stimulation, Ci is normally cleaved from its full-length 155-kDa form to a smaller N-terminal fragment called Ci75, or CiRep(35Aza-Blanc P. Ramirez-Weber F.A. Laget M.P. Schwartz C. Kornberg T.B. Cell. 1997; 89: 1043-1053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). Ci75 lacks the transcriptional activation domains that are found C-terminal to the cleavage region and is localized to the nucleus, where it represses transcription of Hh target genes (30Alexandre C.

Five cytoplasmic proteins in addition to Ci are known to play a role in transducing the Hh signal: Fused (Fu), Costal2 (Cos2), Suppressor of Fused (Su(fu)), supernumerary limbs (slimb), and Drosophilaprotein kinase A. Fu encodes a novel serine/threonine kinase with no particular homologies to other kinases (40Preat T. Therond P. Lamour-Isnard C. Limbourg-Bouchon B. Tricoire H. Erk I. Mariol M.C. Busson D.

Nature. 1998; 391: 493-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). In the absence of Hh stimulation, Fu and Cos2 are basally phosphorylated and, together with Ci, form a high molecular weight protein complex that binds to microtubules. In the presence of Hh stimulation, Fu and Cos2 are hyperphosphorylated, and the complex only weakly binds to microtubules (42Sisson J.C., Ho, K.S. Suyama K. Scott M.P.

A. 1996; 93: 4224-4228Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The kinase activity of Fu is required for Hh signal transduction, but the substrate(s) phosphorylated by Fused has not been identified (38Alves G. Limbourg-Bouchon B. Tricoire H. Brissard-Zahraoui J. Lamour-Isnard C. Busson D. Mech. Dev. 1998; 78: 17-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 39Ohlmeyer J.T. Kalderon D.

A. 1996; 93: 4224-4228Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). To ascertain the substrate of Fu, we have utilized a baculovirus coexpression system that recapitulates the binding of the intracellular components of the Hh signaling pathway (48Stegman M.A. Vallance J.E. Elangovan G. Sosinski J. Cheng Y. Robbins D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21809-21812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In this coinfection system, Fu kinase activity appears to be constitutive and does not require Hh stimulation to be activated. Using this system, we have identified the Cos2 protein as a substrate of the Fu kinase and found that serine 572 in Cos2 is the major Fu-induced phosphorylation site, whereas serine 931 is phosphorylated to a lesser extent. We have further shown that coinfection of a kinase-dead Fu with Cos2 prevents almost all Cos2 phosphorylation. Finally, we demonstrate that the phosphorylation pattern of Cos2 isolated from unstimulated S2 cells matches that of Cos2 produced by coinfection with a kinase-dead Fu. Conversely, the phosphorylation pattern of Cos2 isolated from S2 cells stimulated by Hh matches that of Cos2 obtained from a wild-type Fu coinfection in Sf21 cells. Hence, the hyperphosphorylation of Cos2 that occurs during Hh stimulation is principally due to serine 572 and 931 phosphorylation by Fu and further suggests that Cos2 phosphorylation is the cause of the reduced microtubule binding of the Fu-Cos2-Ci complex seen during Hh stimulation. This represents a unique use of both a kinase and a kinesin in a signal transduction pathway. A full-length Cos2 cDNA was the kind gift of J. Sisson, K. Ho, and M. Scott (Stanford University), and the D6 Fused cDNA was the gift of P. Therond. pKN5 was created as a shuttle vector by excising theKpnI/SacII fragment from pBluescript KS(−) (Stratagene) and inserting a new multiple cloning site with a central stop codon in frame with all restriction sites (details available upon request). BamHI/NotI-cleaved Cos2 was cloned into the BamHI/NotI sites of pKN5 to give a Cos2 with an in frame stop codon, pKNCos2. Mutagenesis of single and multiple residues of Fu and Cos2 was accomplished using PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis (usingPfu polymerase (Stratagene)) on the full-length Fu cDNA, D6, or, in the case of Cos2, pieces of the Cos2 cDNA encompassing the site to be mutated cloned into pKN5 or pBluescript KS(−) (Stratagene). FuM was made by mutating glycine 13 to valine as previously described (74Ascano M. Nybakken K.E. Sosinski J. Stegman M.A. Robbins D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1555-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The Cos2 mutants were made by mutating the appropriate serine(s) and/or threonine(s) to alanine. Minimal portions of the mutated regions of Fu or Cos2 were excised with the appropriate restriction enzymes and ligated into similarly cut D6 or pKNCos2, respectively, and confirmed by sequencing (details available upon request). Cells were lysed by the addition of 0.5 ml per 10-cm plate of Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm EGTA, 0.01 mmbenzamidine-HCl, 1 μg/ml phenanthroline, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml pepstatin A) and rocked occasionally at room temperature for 15 min. The lysate was collected and cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C.

The immunoprecipitates were then washed three times for 30 min each with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer plus 0.25 m NaCl and separated on 8% SDS-PAGE gels. Immunoblotting was conducted as previously described with Tris-buffered saline plus 5% milk (46Robbins D.J. Nybakken K.E. Kobayashi R. Sisson J.C. Bishop J.M. Therond P.P. Cell. 1997; 90: 225-234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Affinity-purified anti-Fu antiserum has been previously described (46Robbins D.J. Nybakken K.E.

Affinity-purified rat anti-Cos2 antiserum was a kind gift from Dr. J. Sisson and Dr. K. Ho in Dr. Matt Scott's laboratory (42Sisson J.C., Ho, K.S. Suyama K. Scott M.P. Cell. 1997; 90: 235-245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Rat and rabbit horseradish peroxidase secondary antisera were obtained from Santa Cruz biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Baculoviruses were produced using the Bac to Bac system, essentially as described by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). For the Fu and FuM baculoviruses, aEcoRI fragment containing the full-length wild type or mutant Fu cDNA was inserted into the EcoRI site of pFastBac1. For the Cos2 and Cos2 mutant baculoviruses, wild type or mutant Cos2 was excised from the pKN5 shuttle vector usingBamHI and SacII and inserted into theBamHI and SacII sites of pFastBac1 (Invitrogen). The Cos2-His6 was constructed by inserting theBamHI/NotI fragment of Cos2 into theBamHI/NotI sites of pFastBac HtB (Invitrogen). After the initial infection of Sf21 cells, viruses were amplified by infecting Sf21 cells at an multiplicity of infection of 0.1 and harvesting virally infested medium 4 days after infection. Infections were conducted by spinning down 12.5 × 106 cells per 10-cm plate, adding virally infested medium to an approximate multiplicity of infection of 3.5–4.0 for each virus, resuspending the cells, and incubating the cells at 28 °C for 1 h, shaking every 10 min. The infected cells and medium were then plated out on 10 plates, and 12 ml of Grace's medium was added. All baculoviruses were confirmed to be expressing the appropriate protein by immunoblotting. S2 cells, S2-Hh-N cells, and S2-Hh cells were cultured in supplemented Schneider cell medium as previously described (47Therond P.P. Knight J.D. Kornberg T.B. Bishop J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4224-4228Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Sf21 cells were cultured in spinner flasks in Grace's insect cells medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1× penicillin/streptomycin. S2 cell labeling was as previously described (46Robbins D.J. Nybakken K.E. Kobayashi R. Sisson J.C. Bishop J.M. Therond P.P. Cell. 1997; 90: 225-234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), with the exception that cells were lysed and immunoprecipitated as above. Each tryptic map represents the Cos2 immunoprecipitated from 12 10-cm plates. Sf21 cells were labeled by infecting 12.5 × 106 cells/10-cm tissue culture plate as above and then 24 h later washing the plates with 5 ml of phosphate free Grace's medium, followed by the addition of 5 ml of phosphate-free Grace's medium, supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum, 1× penicillin/streptomycin, and [32P]orthophosphate to 0.4 mCi/ml (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Plates were then incubated for 14 h at room temperature, followed by a 5-ml wash of phosphate-free Grace's medium. Lysis and immunoprecipitation were then conducted as above. Immunoprecipitates were run out on 8% SDS-PAGE gels and autoradiographed. Radiolabeled Cos2 proteins was excised from SDS-PAGE gels and cut into small pieces. Phosphoamino acid analysis was conducted as described (49Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1273) Google Scholar). For phosphotryptic peptide analysis, these fragments were placed in tubes and washed twice for 30 min each with 100 μl of 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.0, 50% acetonitrile. The gel fragments were dried overnight in a fume hood before the fragments were reduced by rehydration and incubation for 1 h at 55 °C in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate supplemented with 10 mm dithiothreitol. The dithiothreitol solution was removed, and the fragments were acylated by incubation for 45 min with 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate plus 55 mm iodoacetamide. The fragments were washed twice for 10 min each with 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate and then twice for 30 min each with 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate plus 50% acetonitrile and dried overnight in a fume hood. The samples were then digested by adding 200 μl of 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate plus 5 μg/ml modified trypsin (Promega) and incubating for 24–48 h at room temperature. Peptides were then eluted in two 300-μl washes of 60% acetonitrile plus 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in distilled H2O. Eluates were combined and dried down in a Speed-Vac (Savant). The peptides were washed and dried in a Speed-Vac twice with 500 μl of distilled H2O before resuspension in pH 1.9 buffer. The peptide solution was applied to thin layer chromatography plates, and phosphotryptic peptide analysis was carried out as described by Boyle et al. (49Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1273) Google Scholar), using pH 1.9 buffer for TLE in a HTLE-7000 apparatus (CBS Scientific) and isobutyric acid buffer for chromatography. Radiolabeled Cos2 protein was excised from 8% SDS-PAGE gels (either unfixed or fixed and Coomassie-stained), cut into pieces, and digested with trypsin or endoproteinase Lys-C as described (50Hellman U. Wernstedt C. Gonez J. Heldin C.H. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 224: 451-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar), The resultant peptides were then separated using reverse phase HPLC on a microbore C8 column (Vydac, Hesperia, CA), and an aliquot of each collected fraction was scintillation-counted. Individual radiolabeled fractions were subjected to covalent Edman degradation on Sequelon AA membranes (Perseptive Biosystems, Cambridge, MA) with a PerkinElmer Life Sciences model 492 protein sequencer. The anilinothiazolinone-amino acids were extracted from the membranes with undiluted trifluoroacetic acid and scintillationcounted. Edman degradation for sequence was conducted similarly as above, but the HPLC elution gradient was shallower to allow better separation of the peptides, and the anilinothiazolinone-amino acids were eluted using standard conditions instead of undiluted trifluoroacetic acid and sequenced on a PerkinElmer model 492 protein sequencer. Amino acids found at each position were then compared with the known Cos2 sequence, and candidate peptides were identified based on a the presence of at least three sequentially matching amino acids. We have previously shown that Fu and Cos2 are both phosphorylated in the absence of Hh stimulation and that both become hyperphosphorylated when S2 cells are stimulated by Hh (46Robbins D.J. Nybakken K.E. Kobayashi R. Sisson J.C. Bishop J.M. Therond P.P. Cell. 1997; 90: 225-234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). It has further been shown that Fu is hyperphosphorylated at ∼30 min after Hh stimulation (47Therond P.P. Knight J.D. Kornberg T.B. Bishop J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4224-4228Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), but the time course of Cos2 phosphorylation has not been characterized. Since Fu and Cos2 bind tightly to one another (46Robbins D.J. Nybakken K.E. Kobayashi R. Sisson J.C. Bishop J.M. Therond P.P. Cell. 1997; 90: 225-234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), Cos2 is an obvious candidate for a Fu substrate, but if Cos2 were phosphorylated prior to Fu, this might suggest that Fu was not responsible for the phosphorylation of Cos2. It therefore intrigued us when we found that Cos2 from S2 cells was phosphorylated between 30 and 45 minutes after treatment with Hh-N conditioned media, a profile temporally similar, but somewhat delayed, to that of Fu, which starts to become phosphorylated between 15 and 30 min after Hh-N treatment (Fig1 A) (47Therond P.P. Knight J.D. Kornberg T.B. Bishop J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4224-4228Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the slower migrating form of Cos2 found in cells treated with Hh-N conditioned medium for 45–60 min was intermediate in electrophoretic mobility between the non-Hh-stimulated form and the chronically Hh-stimulated form found in S2-Hh cells. This may be due to differential kinetics of phosphorylation of the two Fu-induced phosphorylation sites of Cos2 (see below). Phosphoamino acid analysis of radiolabeled Cos2 from S2 cells, S2 cells expressing Hh constitutively, and S2 cells constitutively expressing Hh-N, further demonstrated that Cos2 was predominantly phosphorylated on serine in all cases (Fig 1 B). The fact that Fu is a serine/threonine kinase and the observation that Cos2 appears to be phosphorylated very soon after Fu confirmed that Fu was a strong candidate for the Cos2 kinase and led us to attempt more directed assays of Fused's ability to phosphorylate Cos2. We first attempted to determine whether Fu phosphorylates Cos2 using radiolabeled Fu and Cos2 immunoprecipitated from S2 cells and embryos, but found that the degree of radiolabeling was insufficient for mapping (data not shown). In vitrokinase assays using immunoprecipitated or in vitrotranslated Fu and Cos2 were also not successful (data not shown). We therefore looked for an alternate system with which to ascertain if Cos2 is a Fu substrate and to identify the phosphorylation site(s) of Cos2. Baculovirus expression systems, in addition to allowing expression of large quantities of proteins, have been shown to recapitulate normal protein-protein interactions and catalytic events, such as phosphorylation, methylation, and glycosylation (51Bakker H.

We have determined the structure using synchrotron x-ray powder-diffraction and found that the expansion of the lattice mainly takes place in one dimension (triclinic b axis), leaving planes of C60 molecules on an approximately hexagonal, slightly expanded lattice. We have performed tight-binding band structure calculations for the surface layer. In spite of the slight expansion of the layers, for the range of dopings where a large Tc has been observed, the density of states at the Fermi energy is smaller for C60.2CHCl3 and C60.2CHBr3 than for C60. This suggests that the lattice expansion alone cannot explain the increase of Tc."

Inducible transcription factors often play a critical role in this process by responding to the cell's external signals. Here we demonstrate that the multifunctional transcription factor TFII-I is activated in response to extracellular signals, translocates into the nucleus, and thus links signal transduction events to transcription. Based on its unique interactions at both a core promoter element and upstream regulatory sites, TFII-I is postulated to be a novel transcription factor that facilitates communication between upstream regulatory proteins and the basal machinery (1Roy A.L., Du, H.

There are four alternatively spliced isoforms of TFII-I, all of which are characterized by the presence of six I repeats, R1−R6, each containing a potential helix-loop-helix motif implicated in protein-protein interactions (4Cheriyath V.

Recent genetic and biochemical data also indicate that TFII-I belongs to a family of protein characterized by the presence of I-repeat, first identified in TFII-I (6Roy A.L. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 274: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Besides its transcription functions, TFII-I is shown to be phosphorylated at both serine/threonine and tyrosine residues, and tyrosine phosphorylation is critical for its transcriptional activity (7Novina C.D. Cheriyath V. Roy A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33443-33448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been shown that a variety of growth-related signals lead to enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation and increased transcriptional activity of TFII-I (7Novina C.D. Cheriyath V. Roy A.L.

Thus, mutations impairing the association between TFII-I and Bruton's tyrosine kinase may result in improper TFII-I localization, activation, and diminished transcription, leading to defective B-cell function (9Novina C.D.

Whereas TFII-I appears to be localized largely in the cytoplasm of a variety of untransformed cells, it is constitutively localized in the nucleus of transformed cells. Moreover, the “basal” tyrosine phosphorylation (in the absence of extracellular signals) of TFII-I is comparatively higher in transformed cells than in primary cells, suggesting that both the tyrosine phosphorylation and nuclear localization of TFII-I may be deregulated during transformation. We demonstrate herein that in untransformed fibroblasts, the non-receptor tyrosine kinase c-Src controls both the tyrosine phosphorylation and the nuclear localization of TFII-I upon growth factor signaling. The major Src-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation sites of TFII-I are also required for its transcriptional activity. Tyrosine-phosphorylated nuclear TFII-I activates a chromosomally integrated c-Fos reporter gene in vivo. However, TFII-I is constitutively located in a non-tyrosine-phosphorylated form in the nucleus of cells lacking Src family kinases. Hence, TFII-I appears to be tethered to the cytoplasm of untransformed fibroblasts in a Src-dependent fashion. Consequently in the absence of Src, TFII-I is not tethered to the cytoplasm and found constitutively in the nucleus. We conclude that the tyrosine phosphorylation status, nuclear translocation, and the transcriptional activity of nuclear TFII-I are c-Src-dependent. NIH 3T3, COS7, HA-13 (11Alberts A.S. Geneste O.

Cell. 1998; 92: 475-487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), and SYF (American Type Culture Collection) cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% calf serum (Invitrogen), 50 units of penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen) at 37 °C under 5% CO2. The NIH 3T3 cell line stably integrated with dominant negative Src was grown in the above-mentioned media supplemented with G418 (600 μg/ml). The construction of pEBGII-I wild type and Y248F mutant has been described previously (7Novina C.D. Cheriyath V. Roy A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33443-33448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 12Cheriyath V. Novina C.D. Roy A.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4444-4454Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The expression plasmid encoding the wild-type or dominant negative c-Src has been described previously (13Gao J. Zoller K.E. Ginsberg M.H. Brugge J.S. Shattil S.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6414-6425Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). PCR-based mutagenesis was used to create an additional mutation at the Tyr611 residue (Y-F2). The antibodies used were as follows: anti-TFII-I antibody (12Cheriyath V. Novina C.D. Roy A.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4444-4454Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), anti-c-Src antibody (GD11 clone; Upstate Biotechnology), and anti-c-Src antibody (BC-12; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). An IgG-purified anti-TFII-I antibody was used in immunostaining (4Cheriyath V. Roy A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26300-26308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The anti-P-TFII-I antibody was raised against the phosphopeptide SEDPD[pY]YQYNI and subsequently affinity-purified (Research Genetics). The stable cell line expressing dominant negative Src was derived as described previously (13Gao J. Zoller K.E. Ginsberg M.H. Brugge J.S. Shattil S.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6414-6425Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), with the following modifications. One day before transfection, the 80–90% confluent cells were split 1:5 and transfected with 10 μg of the plasmid RC-CMV-Src containing dominant negative Src cDNA. Transfection was carried out with superfect reagent (Qiagen). Neo-integrated cells were selected against G418 and subcloned to establish stable clones expressing dominant negative Src. COS7 cells were transfected with 7.5 μg of wild-type or mutant TFII-I expression plasmids (pEBGII-I, pEBGII-I F1, and pEBGII-I Y-F2) with or without 7.5 μg of wild-type or dominant negative c-Src by lipofection (4Cheriyath V. Roy A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26300-26308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Epidermal growth factor (EGF)1 (25 ng/ml; Sigma) stimulation of the cells was carried out as described previously (4Cheriyath V. Roy A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26300-26308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). HA-13 cells were transfected with preimmune serum or specific antibodies using the CHARIOT reagent (Active Motif). Where indicated, the cells were stimulated with platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF; 25 ng/ml) and fixed at different time points. COS7 cells were transfected with 600 ng of c-fos-luciferase reporter plasmid with either pEBG vector, wild-type TFII-I, or its mutants (pEBGII-I, pEBGII-I Y-F1, and pEBGII-I Y-F2) in the absence or presence of c-Src (RC-CMV-Src) as described previously (5Cheriyath V. Roy A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8377-8383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). 24 h after transfection, the cells were serum-starved for 12 h and then stimulated with EGF for 4 h. The luciferase activities were then determined (Dual Luciferase Assay; Promega Corp). Whole cell extracts (200 μg) from COS7 cells transfected with wild-type or mutant TFII-I with or without c-Src were subjected to GST pull-down (35 μl; 1:1 slurry; Sigma) as described previously (4Cheriyath V. Roy A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26300-26308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The blots were probed with anti-TFII-I antibody (1:2500), anti-P-Tyr antibody (1:2000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or anti-P-TFII-I antibody (1:5000). For Western blot analysis, the primary anti-TFII-I (1:2500 dilution) and anti-c-Src (1:1000 dilution) antibodies and the secondary anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-linked (1:10,000 dilution) antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) were incubated in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20. All Western blots were developed using a Renaissance kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The cells were grown on coverslips, serum-starved for 18–20 h, and stimulated with PDGF (20 ng/ml). 10 min after stimulation, cells were washed three times with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and fixed in methanol at various time points. The cells were incubated with primary antibodies (anti-TFII-I, 1:1000; anti-P-TFII-I, 1:5000; or anti-HA (12CA5), 1:1000) and with secondary antibody (anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with Alexa 488 or with anti-rabbit IgG Alexa 594) at a dilution of 1:10,000 for 1 h. The cells were finally incubated with DAPI for 10 min to stain the nuclei and mounted by using mounting buffer (90% glycerol with 0.02% sodium azide). The presence of two consensus Src tyrosine phosphorylation sites (EDXDY at amino acid positions 244–248 and 273–277, respectively) prompted us to test whether TFII-I undergoes a Src-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation and whether that might control the transcriptional activity of TFII-I. In addition to these consensus tyrosine phosphorylation sites, two other YXXP motifs (amino acids 373–376 and 611–614) were also identified that are known to bind to Src homology 2 domains (14Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 373: 573-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (2223) Google Scholar). To test the functionality of these tyrosine residues, we generated several (tyrosine-phenylalanine) mutants of TFII-I. Of these, the Y-F277 and Y373 mutants did not show appreciable effects in any assays tested and were therefore not pursued (data not shown). Y-F248 (Y-F1) and the double mutant Y-F248 + Y-F611 (Y-F2) were tested for Src-dependent phosphorylation and transcriptional assays. Wild-type TFII-I or mutant TFII-I proteins were expressed in COS7 cells as GST fusion proteins in the absence or presence of ectopic c-Src, and their tyrosine phosphorylation status was tested (Fig. 1 A). Whereas the basal tyrosine phosphorylation of wild-type TFII-I in the absence of ectopic c-Src was barely detectable (Fig. 1 A, top panel), co-expression of c-Src significantly increased the tyrosine phosphorylation of TFII-I. In contrast, there was a marked decrease in the tyrosine phosphorylation of both Y-F1 and Y-F2 mutants. This experiment was repeated three times, and the results were plotted. The Y-F1 mutant showed nearly 60% reduction, whereas the Y-F2 mutant showed >80% reduction in tyrosine phosphorylation compared with wild-type TFII-I (Fig. 1 B). We previously showed enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of TFII-I in response to EGF treatment (8Kim D.-W. Cheriyath V. Roy A.L. Cochran B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3310-3320Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). It is also known that EGF stimulation leads to activation of Src (15Wilde A. Beattie E.C. Lem L. Riethof D.A. Liu S.H. Mobley W.C. Soriano P. Brodsky F.M. Cell. 1999; 96: 677-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Whereas EGF stimulation significantly increased tyrosine phosphorylation of wild-type TFII-I (Fig. 1 C), the Y-F1 mutant exhibited an 8-fold decrease in tyrosine phosphorylation, suggesting that EGF-dependent induction of tyrosine phosphorylation in TFII-I also occurs at Tyr248. The Y-F1 and Y-F2 mutants were further tested in transcription assays. Ectopic expression of c-Src alone did not significantly increase the c-fos promoter activity, but when it was expressed together with ectopic TFII-I, promoter activity was enhanced (Fig. 1 D). The transcriptional activity achieved under these conditions was comparable to that obtained upon EGF stimulation (data not shown). Most importantly, co-expression of Src and either the Y-F1 or Y-F2 mutant failed to significantly increase c-fos promoter activity over the basal levels. Whereas the basal level expression of Y-F1 (Fig. 1 D, lane 5) was lower than that of the wild type (lane 3), their levels of expression were very similar in the presence of Src (lane 4 versus lane 6). Hence, the Src-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation sites in TFII-I are functional and required for its c-fos-dependent transcription activity. Given that TFII-I undergoes Src-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation and that Src is a cytoplasmic kinase, we tested whether TFII-I is cytoplasmic in normal NIH 3T3 cells and, if so, whether the subcellular localization of endogenous TFII-I is altered upon stimulation in a Src-dependent fashion. Because expression of the EGF receptor is limited in NIH 3T3 cells (16Cohen B.D. Kiener P.A. Green J.M. Foy L. Fell P.H. Zhang K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30897-30903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), we used PDGF as the source of growth factor. In the absence of PDGF, the majority of endogenous TFII-I was extranuclear (with diffuse nuclear staining; Fig.2 A, − PDGF). In contrast, upon PDGF stimulation, the majority of TFII-I staining was observed in the nucleus (Fig. 2 A, + PDGF). To test Src dependence, cells were treated with either a Src-specific inhibitor, PP1, or with its noninhibitory analogue, PP3 (17Mariotti A. Kedeshian P.A. Dans M. Curatola A.M. Gagnoux L. Giancotti F.G. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 447-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Pretreatment of cells with PP1 significantly decreased signal-induced nuclear translocation of TFII-I (Fig. 2 A,+PDGF+PP1), whereas its analogue, PP3, had no effect (Fig.2 A, +PDGF+PP3). Thus, signal-induced nuclear translocation of TFII-I is likely a Src-dependent process. We then established an NIH 3T3 cell line that expresses a dominant negative c-Src and tested the localization of TFII-I in these cells and in SYF cells in which Src family kinase members Src, Yes, and Fyn were all genetically deleted (18Klinghoffer R.A. Sachsenmaier C. Cooper J.A. Soriano P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2459-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). The majority of TFII-I localized constitutively in the nucleus of cells expressing dominant negative c-Src and SYF cells (Fig. 2 A, NIH-3T3(dn) andSYF). TFII-I subcellular localization remained unchanged even in the presence of PDGF in dominant negative Src-expressing cells and SYF cells (data not shown), although it remains to be seen whether c-fos is activated in response to PDGF in these cells. In summary, we conclude that Src or a Src family kinase directly or indirectly tethers TFII-I to the cytoplasm, such that inactivating Src or genetically deleting Src family kinases leads to constitutive nuclear localization of TFII-I. Importantly, the nuclear translocation of TFII-I in normal NIH3T3 cells was reversible because withdrawal of PDGF led to significant reduction in nuclear TFII-I staining together with a concomitant increase in extranuclear TFII-I (Fig.2 B). To address the transcriptional consequences of signal-induced nuclear translocation of TFII-I, we used cell line SRE-Fos HA (clone 13), which contains a stably integrated c-fos gene tagged internally with HA under the SRE promoter. Because the ternary complex factors cannot associate with this promoter (11Alberts A.S. Geneste O. Treisman R. Cell. 1998; 92: 475-487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 19Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1159-1170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1205) Google Scholar), and TFII-I can bind to the sites overlapping the SRE (8Kim D.-W. Cheriyath V. Roy A.L. Cochran B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3310-3320Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 20Grueneberg D.A. Henry R.W. Brauer A. Novina C.D. Cheriyath V. Roy A.L. Gilman M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2482-2493Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), activation of such a promoter may reflect TFII-I dependence. Stimulation with PDGF led to significant nuclear translocation of TFII-I (Fig. 3, compareE, G, and H) and the concomitant appearance of nuclear HA-Fos (Fig. 3 F). Accumulation of nuclear TFII-I continued for an additional 30 min. Peak HA activity was observed between 10 and 20 min of PDGF withdrawal (compare Fig. 3,I−L with M−P). By 60 min, most of the TFII-I was extranuclear, with a simultaneous reduction of HA staining. Thus, a good correlation exists between the kinetics of nuclear localization of TFII-I and the expression of HA-Fos. To demonstrate a direct role of signal-induced nuclear TFII-I in the regulation of HA-Fos transcription, we transfected either preimmune sera or an anti-TFII-I antibody into HA-13 cells using a lipid-mediated method (21Morris M.C. Robert-Hebman V. Chaolin L. Mery J. Heitz F. Devaux C. Goody R.S. Divita G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24941-24946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The introduction of preimmune serum into these cells did not abolish HA expression, and maximum HA-Fos expression was observed between 10 and 20 min after PDGF withdrawal (Fig.4, J and N). Most significantly, transfection of either an anti-TFII-I antibody or an anti-Src antibody abrogated HA-Fos expression, suggesting that PDGF-induced activation of HA-Fos is dependent on both TFII-I and c-Src (Fig. 4, A′−X′). Using ectopically expressed TFII-I, we showed that Tyr248 exhibits enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation in response to growth factor stimulation and when co-expressed with ectopic Src. Moreover, we demonstrated that tyrosine phosphorylation of Tyr248 is critical for transcriptional activity of TFII-I. However, it was not known whether this site was also tyrosine-phosphorylated in endogenous TFII-I. To demonstrate that Tyr248 is tyrosine-phosphorylated in vivo, we generated a phospho-specific antibody against phosphorylated Tyr248. To ensure specificity, we first tested this antibody against ectopically expressed TFII-I and its mutants in COS7 cells (Fig. 5 A). The antibody recognized only the wild-type TFII-I in the presence of EGF (Fig.5 A, lane 2). This recognition was completely lost in the presence of the Src inhibitor PP2 (lane 4; PP2 was used instead of PP1 because PP1 interferes with the EGF receptor) or when Tyr248 was mutated as in Y-F1 (lane 6) and Y-F2 (lane 8). Moreover, this antibody stained predominantly nuclear TFII-I upon stimulation, although a diffuse staining could be observed at earlier time points (Fig. 5 B). Importantly, the time course of tyrosine phosphorylation correlated with the time course of nuclear translocation and HA-Fos expression (see Fig. 3). Moreover, tyrosine phosphorylation of TFII-I at Tyr248 was not observed in SYF cells, although TFII-I is constitutively present in the nucleus of these cells. Therefore, Tyr248 tyrosine phosphorylation of TFII-I is Src family kinase-dependent. Although it was reported recently that JAK2 phosphorylates TFII-I at Tyr248 (22Kim D.-W. Cochran B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3387-3397Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), in our hands, TFII-I is tyrosine-phosphorylated on Tyr248 and translocates to the nucleus in JAK2-null fibroblasts (23Parganas E. Wang D. Stravapodis D. Topham D.J. Marine J. Teglund S. Vanin E.F. Bodner S. Colamonici O.R. Ihle J.N. Cell. 1998; 93: 385-395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar), suggesting that these processes are JAK2-independent (data not shown). However, it is possible that under some conditions and using some assays, JAK2-dependent phosphorylation of TFII-I may be seen. Src family protein tyrosine kinases are activated following the engagement of diverse cellular receptors, thereby participating in altering various biological responses including cell proliferation, migration, differentiation, and survival (24Abram C.L. Courtneidge S.A. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 254: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Src is perhaps the best-studied non-receptor protein tyrosine kinase involved in regulating cellular responses to various extracellular stimuli (25Brown M.T. Cooper J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1287: 121-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar,26Thomas S.M. Brugge J.S. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 513-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (2161) Google Scholar). It is the first defined proto-oncogene, and the viral form of cellular Src (v-Src) encodes a constitutively active enzyme that can induce cellular transformation (27Brugge J.S. Erikson R.L. Nature. 1977; 269: 346-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). Triggering of growth factor receptors via their cognate ligands (e.g. PDGF and EGF) in fibroblasts leads to activation of c-Src through its autophosphorylation, and several reports, using biochemical evidence, suggest that Src family kinases are essential components of PDGF receptor signaling (28Twamley-Stein G.M. Pepperkok R. Ansorge W. Courtneidge S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7696-7700Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 29Roche S. Koegel M. Barone M.V. Roussel M.F. Courtneidge S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1102-1109Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Broome M.A. Hunter T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16798-16806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 31Erpel T. Alonso G. Roche S. Courtneidge S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16807-16812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 32Valius M. Kazlauskas A. Cell. 1993; 73: 321-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). However, PDGF receptor-mediated signaling and mitogenesis remain intact in fibroblasts derived from mice with targeted disruption of three Src family kinases (Src, Yes, and Fyn) (18Klinghoffer R.A. Sachsenmaier C. Cooper J.A. Soriano P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2459-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). One interpretation of these results is that activation of Src family protein tyrosine kinases is dispensable, at least in some instances and cell types, for PDGF-driven mitogenesis and that the SYF (Src, Yes, Fyn) triple mutant phenotype is not likely to be caused by abnormal PDGF receptor signaling (18Klinghoffer R.A. Sachsenmaier C. Cooper J.A. Soriano P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2459-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). Alternatively, it can be argued that PDGF receptors activate many parallel signaling events, each of which can lead to mitogenesis (32Valius M. Kazlauskas A. Cell. 1993; 73: 321-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). Hence, it is very likely that a requirement for Src family kinases in SYF cells is bypassed by activation of any of these PDGF receptor-mediated signaling pathways involving intermediates such as phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase or phospholipase C (18Klinghoffer R.A. Sachsenmaier C. Cooper J.A. Soriano P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2459-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). Numerous proteins interact with and are phosphorylated by c-Src (24Abram C.L. Courtneidge S.A. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 254: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar), but they do not provide mechanistic insight as to how activated Src might regulate growth factor-dependent gene expression (33Hakak Y. Martin G.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6953-6962Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar,34Karni R. Jove R. Levitzki A. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4654-4662Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Moreover, although the oncogenic form of Src activates signal transducers and activators of transcription, a direct physical link has not been established (35Yu C.L. Meyer D.J. Campbell G.S. Larner A.C. Carter-Su C. Schwartz J. Jove R. Science. 1995; 269: 81-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that integrin signaling through the Src family kinase Fyn leads to recruitment of the Shc adapter protein, resulting in activation of an artificial SRE-fos reporter via the Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (36Wary K.K. Mainiero F. Isakoff S.J. Marcantonio E.E. Giancotti F.G. Cell. 1996; 87: 733-743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). Adding to this complexity is the fact that knockouts of c-Src resulted in a minimal phenotype, presumably due to functional redundancy in the Src family kinases (37Soriano P. Montgomery C. Geske R. Bradley A. Cell. 1991; 64: 693-702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1797) Google Scholar). Consistent with this idea, double and triple knockout (SYF) mice exhibit a severe phenotype, including embryonic lethality (18Klinghoffer R.A. Sachsenmaier C. Cooper J.A. Soriano P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2459-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). In contrast, Src−/− mice exhibit osteopetrosis with decreased absorption of bone, resulting in bone overgrowth (37Soriano P. Montgomery C. Geske R. Bradley A. Cell. 1991; 64: 693-702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1797) Google Scholar, 38Boyce B.F. Yoneda T. Lowe C. Soriano P. Mundy G.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1622-1627Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). Furthermore, transgenic studies suggest that Src has a kinase-independent function, particularly in osteoclasts (38Boyce B.F. Yoneda T. Lowe C. Soriano P. Mundy G.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1622-1627Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). Although osteoclasts may represent a special cell type because the levels of Src expression in osteoclasts are unusually high, it is likely that Src may be important for regulating the localization of certain proteins or stabilizing signaling complexes that control cellular growth in other cell types as well (26Thomas S.M. Brugge J.S. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 513-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (2161) Google Scholar). Collectively, these data suggest that all Src-dependent signals are not transduced through a single pathway. Consistent with the notion of a novel Src-dependent pathway, we postulate that Src controls tyrosine phosphorylation and subsequent nuclear translocation of TFII-I, resulting in up-regulation of growth-promoting genes. However, the precise mechanism of how Src controls nuclear translocation and tyrosine phosphorylation of TFII-I remains to be determined. Currently, we cannot formally rule out the possibility that TFII-I may not be a direct substrate of Src. Moreover, Src is localized predominantly in the membrane, whereas extranuclear TFII-I is most likely in the soluble fraction. Although a fraction of TFII-I is constitutively associated with Src under normal conditions (data not shown), this may not be sufficient to physically tether the majority of cellular TFII-I to the cytoplasm. It is conceivable that other factors are involved in this pathway, and the identification of these factors may lead to a better understanding of how Src controls gene expression via TFII-I. Regardless of the exact mechanism of Src-mediated regulation of TFII-I, it is clear that upon signaling, TFII-I rapidly becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated and translocates to the nucleus to activate various signal-induced genes, a process that requires an active Src. This process is completely reversible, thus providing a rapid turn on/off mechanism that is a prerequisite for controlled signal-induced cellular growth. It is also particularly gratifying to observe that the kinetics of TFII-I tyrosine phosphorylation and its concomitant nuclear import match the kinetics of HA-Fos gene expression, lending further credence to the notion that TFII-I is required for HA-Fos transcription. However, other investigators using the same HA-Fos cell line that we used in our system have shown that regulated association of Src with Diaphanous-related formins (mDia1 and mDia2) controls HA-Fos via activation of SRF (39Tominaga T. Sahai E. Chardin P. McCormick F. Courtneidge S.A. Alberts A.S. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 13-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Our results are not incompatible with these observations and might suggest a coordinate regulation of HA-Fos via the activation of both TFII-I and SRF. In this regard, it is worth pointing out that the TFII-I binding site overlaps the SRF binding site (SRE), and the two proteins interact both on and off the DNA (8Kim D.-W. Cheriyath V. Roy A.L. Cochran B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3310-3320Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 20Grueneberg D.A. Henry R.W. Brauer A. Novina C.D. Cheriyath V. Roy A.L. Gilman M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2482-2493Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). We also wish to emphasize that the Src-TFII-I pathway may have broader implications beyond PDGF-mediated up-regulation of c-fos. This is especially true because TFII-I is a multifunctional transcription factor that likely controls a wide variety of genes (6Roy A.L. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 274: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it is important to note that this pathway may not be commonly utilized by all growth factors for their growth regulatory and transforming potentials. Could there be a correlation between the Src-mediated activation of TFII-I and neurodevelopmental disorders observed in Williams Beurens syndrome (WBS)? This is particularly tantalizing because the highest expression of TFII-I is found in the brain, and there appears to be a neuron-specific isoform of TFII-I (1Roy A.L., Du, H. Gregor P.D. Novina C.D. Martinez E. Roeder R.G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7091-7104Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 40Perez-Jurado L.A. Wang Y.-K. Peoples R. Coloma A. Cruces J. Francke U. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 325-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). WBS is a multisystem dysfunction manifested as mild to moderate mental retardation, cognitive defects, and supravalvar aortic stenosis (41Francke U. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 1947-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Although it is likely that the broad phenotypic spectrum associated with WBS is the consequence of multigene deletion, the haploinsufficiency of TFII-I and its related gene suggests a potential link between TFII-I function and one or more of the WBS phenotypes (40Perez-Jurado L.A. Wang Y.-K. Peoples R. Coloma A. Cruces J. Francke U. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 325-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Perhaps a mouse knockout model in the near future might address a potential connection between Src-mediated activation of TFII-I and cognitive defects associated with WBS.

https://openalex.org/W2085289731,"Retinoid-binding proteins play an important role in regulating transport, storage, and metabolism of vitamin A and its derivatives. The solution structure and backbone dynamics of rat cellular retinol-binding protein type I (CRBP) in the apo- and holo-form have been determined and compared using multidimensional high resolution NMR spectroscopy. The global fold of the protein is consistent with the common motif described for members of the intracellular lipid-binding protein family. The most relevant difference between the NMR structure ensembles of apo- and holoCRBP is the higher backbone disorder, in the ligand-free form, of some segments that frame the putative entrance to the ligand-binding site. These comprise α-helix II, the subsequent linker to β-strand B, the hairpin turn between β-strands C and D, and the βE-βF turn. The internal backbone dynamics, obtained from 15N relaxation data (T1, T2, and heteronuclear nuclear Overhauser effect) at two different fields, indicate several regions with significantly higher backbone mobility in the apoprotein, including the βC-βD and βE-βF turns. Although apoCRBP contains a binding cavity more shielded than that of any other retinoid carrier, conformational flexibility in the portal region may assist retinol uptake. The stiffening of the backbone in the holoprotein guarantees the stability of the complex during retinol transport and suggests that targeted retinol release requires a transiently open state that is likely to be promoted by the acceptor or the local environment.

Plasma transport of retinol to target cells and intracellular transport for either storage or metabolic conversion are performed by binding proteins that belong to the calycin superfamily. The cytosolic carriers are members of the intracellular lipid-binding protein (i-LBP)1 family, characterized by molecular masses of around 15 kDa. Their structure consists of a 10-stranded β-barrel, formed by two orthogonal β-sheets, and two short α-helices (2Banaszak L.J. Winter N.S., Xu, Z. Bernlohr D.A. Cowan S.W. Jones T.A. Adv. Protein Chem. 1994; 45: 89-151Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The two best known intracellular carriers of retinol are cellular retinol-binding protein type I (CRBP), widely distributed in various tissues (3Bashor M.M. Toft D.O. Chytil F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 3483-3487Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 4Ong D.E. Chytil F. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 828-832Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and cellular retinol-binding protein type II (CRBP-II), present in the enterocytes of the small intestine and in neonatal hepatocytes (5Ong D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 1476-1482Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Li E. Norris A.W. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1996; 16: 205-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The structures of rat apo- and holoCRBP-II have been solved both in the crystal (7Winter N.S. Bratt J.M. Banaszak L.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 1247-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and in solution (8Lu J. Lin C.L. Tang C. Ponder J.W. Kao J.L.F. Cistola D.P. Li E. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 1179-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 9Lu J. Lin C.L. Tang C. Ponder J.W. Kao J.L.F. Cistola D.P. Li E. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 619-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), whereas the only structure of CRBP available to date was that of the holoprotein in the crystal (10Cowan S.W. Newcomer M.E. Jones T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 1225-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). More recently, two other retinol carriers have been identified as follows: murine CRBP-III, expressed primarily in heart, muscle, and adipose tissue (11Vogel S. Mendelsohn C.L. Mertz J.R. Piantedosi R. Waldburger C. Gottesman M.E. Blaner W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1353-1360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar); and human CRBP-III, most abundant in liver and kidney, whose structure in the retinol-free form has been solved by x-ray crystallography (12Folli C. Calderone V. Ottonello S. Bolchi A. Zanotti G. Stoppini M. Berni R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3710-3715Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In the cell, the poorly water-soluble retinol is stored within membranes as a retinyl-ester derivative of long-chain fatty acids, whose CRBP-dependent synthesis is catalyzed by the microsomal enzyme lecithin:retinol acyltransferase (13Herr F.M. Ong D.E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 6748-6755Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The role of the carrier in efficient retinyl-ester synthesis has been confirmed by an in vivo study (14Ghyselinck N.B. Bavik C. Sapin V. Mark M. Bonnier D. Hindelang A.D. Nilsson C.B. Hakansson H. Sauvant P. Azais-Braesco V. Frasson M. Picaud S. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4903-4914Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). For the metabolic utilization of vitamin A, apoCRBP promotes retinyl-ester hydrolysis and binds the released retinol (15Ottonello S. Petrucco S. Maraini G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3975-3981Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CRBP-delivered retinol is converted to retinaldehyde by an enzyme located on the cytosolic side of endoplasmic reticulum, which was first isolated from the microsomal fraction of rat liver (16Posch K.C. Boerman M.H. Burns R.D. Napoli J.L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6224-6230Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 17Penzes P. Napoli J.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2088-2093Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Retinaldehyde can be further oxidized to retinoic acid, the biologically most active derivative of vitamin A (18Ross A.C. J. Nutr. 1993; 2: 346-350Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 19Napoli J.L. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1999; 63: 139-188Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The latter metabolite is specifically recognized by two other members of the i-LBP family, the cellular retinoic acid-binding proteins CRABP-I and CRABP-II (6Li E. Norris A.W. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1996; 16: 205-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 20Ong D.E. Newcomer M.E. Chytil F. Sporn M.B. Robert A.B. Goodman D.S. The Retinoids: Biology, Chemistry, and Medicine. 2nd Ed. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1994: 283-312Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of retinoid carriers accounts for their ligand specificity and affinity. CRBP forms the most stable complex with all-trans-retinol and a weaker one with retinaldehyde, whereas it does not bind retinoic acid (21Li E. Qian S.J. Winter N.S. d'Avignon A. Levin M.S. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3622-3629Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The crystal structure of holoCRBP shows that the internal binding cavity is lined by both polar and hydrophobic side chains. The bound all-trans-retinol has a planar conformation with its hydroxyl group innermost and hydrogen-bonded to the side chain of glutamine 108 (10Cowan S.W. Newcomer M.E. Jones T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 1225-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Ligand uptake and targeted release, besides transport, are the fundamental functional features of hydrophobic ligand carriers. Despite the wealth of structural information, neither process is well understood as yet. Crystallographic studies on various members of the i-LBP family have evidenced the general lack of an obvious route for the ligand to enter and exit from its binding site. Nevertheless, a possible “portal” has been identified in the region located between α-helix II and the two turns βC-βD and βE-βF. This hypothesis was initially based on the occurrence of a small opening on the surface of intestinal fatty acid-binding protein (I-FABP) (22Sacchettini J.C. Gordon J.I. Banaszak L.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 208: 327-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Further evidence was provided by the crystal structures of the oleate:adipocyte lipid-binding protein and the oleate:liver fatty acid-binding protein complexes, in which one end of the bound ligand is protruding into the surrounding solvent (23Xu Z. Bernlohr D.A. Banaszak L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7874-7884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Thompson J. Winter N. Terwey D. Bratt J. Banaszak L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7140-7150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). The crystal structures of most i-LBPs reveal only minimal differences between the apo- and the holo-form. This feature could in principle be attributed to lattice interactions that select the same protein conformation both in the presence and in the absence of the ligand, masking differences that possibly exist in solution. However, the NMR data confirm the structural similarities and suggest that a crucial role in ligand binding is likely to be played by the higher conformational flexibility of the portal region in the apo-form. According to the “dynamic portal hypothesis,” suggested by NMR studies on I-FABP (25Hodsdon M.E. Cistola D.P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1450-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 26Hodsdon M.E. Cistola D.P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2278-2290Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), some residues can undergo large movements that enable the opening or closing of the portal. The structures of the retinoid-binding proteins represent a somewhat different situation, because the apo-forms exhibit varying degrees of accessibility to the ligand-binding site. The solution structure of human apoCRABP-II shows that the binding cavity is readily accessible to retinoic acid, as a result of a concerted conformational change of α-helix II and the two turns βC-βD and βE-βF with respect to their position in the crystal structure of the holo-form (27Wang L., Li, Y. Abildgaard F. Markley J.L. Yan H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12727-12736Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 28Kleywegt G.J. Bergfors T. Senn H., Le Motte P. Gsell B. Shudo K. Jones T.A. Structure. 1994; 2: 1241-1258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Such a concerted displacement of three structural elements is unique to CRABP-II and appears to be partially suppressed by the R111M mutation, more so in solution (29Wang L. Yan H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13021-13032Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) than in the crystal (30Chen X. Tordova M. Gilliland G.L. Wang L., Li, Y. Yan H. Ji X. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 278: 641-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Murine apoCRABP-I in the crystalline state is a head-to-head dimer, forming a double β-barrel joined at the portal regions and thus creating a possible route for retinoic acid to enter the binding cavity (31Thompson J.R. Bratt J.M. Banaszak L.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 252: 433-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Although it is not known whether such a structure occurs in vivo, NMR studies on CRABP-I confirm that this protein self-associates (32Rizo J. Liu Z.P. Gierasch L.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 741-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The solution structure of apoCRBP-II, when compared with the holo-form, is characterized by the presence of a small aperture and higher local flexibility, two features that could facilitate the entry of retinol (8Lu J. Lin C.L. Tang C. Ponder J.W. Kao J.L.F. Cistola D.P. Li E. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 1179-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar); once bound, the ligand would induce the changes that close the entrance and stabilize the complex (9Lu J. Lin C.L. Tang C. Ponder J.W. Kao J.L.F. Cistola D.P. Li E. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 619-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, CRBP-II in the crystalline state displays nearly the same structure in the apo- as in the holo-form (7Winter N.S. Bratt J.M. Banaszak L.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 1247-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of holoCRBP (10Cowan S.W. Newcomer M.E. Jones T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 1225-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) shows that the retinol-binding site is fully shielded from the outside medium. This observation raised the question whether the structure of the ligand-free protein would indicate significant conformational differences. The present study on CRBP by multidimensional high-resolution NMR spectroscopy provides the first opportunity to compare structure and internal backbone dynamics of the protein in the apo- and the holo-form, and to verify whether it exhibits the characteristic differences that have been reported for its close homologue CRBP-II (8Lu J. Lin C.L. Tang C. Ponder J.W. Kao J.L.F. Cistola D.P. Li E. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 1179-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 9Lu J. Lin C.L. Tang C. Ponder J.W. Kao J.L.F. Cistola D.P. Li E. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 619-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The rat CRBP cDNA has been cloned into a pET-11b vector and transformed into theEscherichia coli strain BL21(DE3). For expression of the unlabeled recombinant protein, bacteria were grown at 37 °C in Luria broth medium containing carbenicillin (0.1 mg/ml) until the absorbance at 600 nm reached ∼0.6 OD. The expression of CRBP was induced by adding isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside up to 1 mm final concentration. After additional 5 h of growth, the bacterial cells were harvested by centrifugation at 9,000 × g for 10 min. The same procedure was used for the expression of uniformly 15N-enriched CRBP, except that the bacteria were grown in M9 minimal medium containing15NH4Cl (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Andover, MA) as the sole nitrogen source. The recombinant protein was purified to homogeneity as described elsewhere (33Malpeli G. Folli C. Cavazzini D. Sartori G. Berni R. Methods Mol. Biol. 1998; 89: 111-122PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the supernatant obtained from the bacterial lysate after setting the ammonium sulfate concentration to 50% saturation was first subjected to an Ultrogel AcA54 gel filtration chromatography and subsequently purified to homogeneity on a QMA anion-exchange fast protein liquid chromatography column, eluted with a linear NaCl gradient (0–400 mm) in 25 mmtris-(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane hydrochloride buffer, pH 7.3. The purity of the protein was estimated by SDS-PAGE with 15% polyacrylamide gels. Both the unlabeled and the 15N-enriched apoCRBP samples were at least 95% free of fatty acids and other potential ligands endogenous to E. coli, as shown by gas chromatography and mass spectrometric analysis (34Elviri L. Zagnoni I. Careri M. Cavazzini D. Rossi G.L. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 2001; 15: 2186-2192Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The protein concentration was estimated using an extinction coefficient of 28,800m−1 cm−1 at 280 nm (35Levin M.S., Li, E. Gordon J.L. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 189: 506-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). To obtain the holoCRBP samples, the apoprotein was saturated (5 min incubation in the dark) with 1.5 m excess of freshly prepared all-trans-retinol, delivered in dimethyl sulfoxide (maximum 1% v/v). The unbound retinol was removed by gel filtration chromatography (Econo-Pac 10DG column, packed with Bio-Gel P-6DG gel, Bio-Rad). The reconstituted holoCRBP complex exhibited anA350/A280 ratio of about 1.65, close to the best value reported for the natural protein from rat tissues (4Ong D.E. Chytil F. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 828-832Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For NMR measurements, 1.6 mm protein samples were prepared in potassium phosphate buffer (20 mm, pH 6.0; H2O/D2O = 90:10, v/v) containing 0.05% NaN3. All NMR experiments were carried out at 25 °C on Bruker DMX spectrometers operating at1H resonance frequencies of 499.87 and 600.13 MHz, both equipped with triple resonance (1H/13C/15N) XYZgradient probes. Homonuclear two-dimensional spectra (TOCSY and NOESY) as well as 15N-edited multidimensional spectra were acquired; the latter included HSQC, HTQC, TOCSY-HSQC, and NOESY-HSQC. The TOCSY experiments were performed with spin-lock times of either 80 or 5.5 ms (to obtain COSY-type information). For the NOESY experiments, mixing times (τm) of 150 and 200 ms were used. The homonuclear spectra were recorded in a phase-sensitive mode with time-proportional phase incrementation of the initial pulse. Quadrature detection was used in both dimensions with the carrier placed in the center of the spectrum on the water resonance. All three-dimensional experiments made use of pulsed field gradients for coherence selection and artifact suppression, as well as gradient sensitivity enhancement schemes wherever appropriate (36Kay L.E. Keifer P. Saarinen T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 10663-10665Crossref Scopus (2433) Google Scholar, 37Schleucher J. Sattler M. Griesinger C. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1993; 32: 1489-1491Crossref Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Quadrature detection in the indirectly detected dimensions was achieved by either the States-TPPI (38Marion D. Ikura M. Tschudin R. Bax A. J. Magn. Reson. 1989; 85: 393-399Google Scholar) or the echo/antiecho (37Schleucher J. Sattler M. Griesinger C. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1993; 32: 1489-1491Crossref Scopus (224) Google Scholar) method. Chemical shifts were referenced to external sodium 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Andover, MA) in order to ensure consistency among all spectra (39Wishart D.S. Bigam C.G. Yao J. Abildgaard F. Dyson H.J. Oldfield E. Markley J.L. Sykes B.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 135-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (2074) Google Scholar). The 15N relaxation experiments were recorded at two different fields (500 and 600 MHz). Standard sets of sensitivity-enhanced HSQC-type pulse sequences were used to carry out the NMR experiments for the determination of longitudinal (R1) and transverse (R2) relaxation rates as well as the heteronuclear NOE (40Peng J. Wagner G. J. Magn. Reson. 1992; 98: 308-332Google Scholar, 41Peng J. Wagner G. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8571-8586Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 42Cavanagh J. Fairbrother W.J. Palmer III., A.G. Skelton N.J. Protein NMR Spectroscopy: Principles and Practice. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1996: 243-300Google Scholar). Series of HSQC spectra were recorded in an interleaved mode, each using 9–12 relaxation periods between 8 and 1600 ms. The spectral widths were set to 15/15 ppm in the 1H dimension and 31/32 ppm in the15N dimension for apo- and holoCRBP, respectively. Echo/antiecho-type gradient selection was used for phase-sensitive detection in the ω1 dimension. 512t1 increments were recorded in the indirect dimension, and 1024 data points were recorded in thet2 dimension. The spectral data were processed on a Silicon Graphics O2 work station using the Bruker XWIN-NMR 1.3 software package. A 90° phase-shifted squared sine-bell function was used for apodization in all dimensions. In the three-dimensional spectra, forward linear prediction to extend the time domain data as well as zero-filling were applied in the indirectly detected dimensions. Polynomial base-line correction was applied to the processed spectra wherever necessary. The final matrices consisted of 2048 × 2048, 2048 × 1024, or 1024 × 128 × 256 real data points for homonuclear two-dimensional, heteronuclear two-dimensional and three-dimensional spectra, respectively. Peak picking and data analysis of the transformed spectra were performed using the AURELIA 2.5.9 (Bruker) and FELIX 97 (Molecular Simulation, Inc., San Diego, CA) software packages. For relaxation data analysis, following the measurement of individual signal intensities the relaxation rates were estimated through non-linear least squares optimization using the RMX program (Dr. J. Schmidt, National Institute for Medical Research, London, UK). The resulting relaxation rates R1 and R2 together with the heteronuclear NOE were analyzed by applying a Lipari-Szábo-type model-free formalism using the Modelfree 4.01 software package (43Mandel A.M. Akke M. Palmer A.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 144-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar, 44Palmer A.G. Rance M. Wright P.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 4371-4380Crossref Scopus (597) Google Scholar). The relaxation data were fitted for each residue to several models of internal dynamics assuming isotropic molecular motion. A grid search was performed using the entire set of experimental data in order to determine the molecular correlation time τm. The NOE-derived distance constraints were determined from homonuclear two-dimensional NOESY and three-dimensional 15N-edited NOESY-HSQC spectra. Automated assignments of the NOEs, based only on chemical shifts, were obtained with the program nmr2st (45Pristovšek P. Lücke C. Reincke B. Ludwig B. Rüterjans H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4205-4212Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). An internal calibration, based on the intensities of characteristic intra- and inter-strand NOEs for residues within the β-sheet structure as well as sequential and medium range NOEs for residues belonging to the α-helices, was used to set the upper distance limits. The integrated peak volumes were converted into approximate inter-proton distances by normalizing against the calibrated volumes. The upper distance bounds were subsequently set to different categories of 2.7, 3.5, 4.2, 5.0, and 6.0 Å; lower bounds were taken in all cases as the sum of the van der Waals radii (1.9 Å) of the interacting protons. The structures were calculated on a Silicon Graphics O2 work station with the program DYANA (46Güntert P. Mumenthaler C. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 283-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (2555) Google Scholar), which uses a simulated annealing algorithm combined with torsion angle dynamics. Starting ab initio, 100 conformers were calculated in 8000 annealing steps each. Initial structures were calculated by using only uniquely assigned distance constraints; subsequently, an iterative strategy was used for the structure refinement. In each round of structure refinement, the newly computed NMR structures were employed to assign ambiguous NOE cross-peaks, to correct erroneous assignments, and to loosen the NOE distance bounds if spectral overlap was deduced. A retinol template, derived from the x-ray coordinates of holoCRBP (10Cowan S.W. Newcomer M.E. Jones T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 1225-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), was introduced to the DYANA residue library. By using the standard procedure for DYANA calculations with several molecules, the ligand was attached to the protein via one PLQ and 39 LLQ pseudo-atom linkers of the DYANA library, spanning a maximal distance of ∼85 Å from the C terminus of the polypeptide chain to the C-1 atom of the retinol. The retinol was kept in an all-trans conformation, whereas the single bonds of the methyl groups (C-16, C-17, C-18, C-19, and C-20) and the C-15–OH bond were allowed to rotate. Stereospecific assignments were obtained for almost all prochiral methylene and isopropyl groups using the program GLOMSA (47Güntert P. Braun W. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 217: 517-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar). Pseudo-atom correction for magnetically equivalent protons was applied as proposed by Wüthrich et al. (48Wüthrich K. Billeter M. Braun W. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 169: 949-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). No hydrogen bond constraints were used in the structure calculation. In the analysis of the final structures, a purely geometrical criterion for the existence of a hydrogen bond was applied (dHO <2.3 Å, ΘNHO >135°). In the last run of calculation, the structures were computed using a total of 2409 and 2826 meaningful distance restraints for apo- and holoCRBP, respectively (Table I). Subsequent energy minimization in the presence of the NOE-derived distance restraints, carried out with the DISCOVER module of the INSIGHT 97 software package (Molecular Simulation, Inc.), was performed on the 20 best DYANA conformers. The consistent valence force field (49Dauber-Osguthorpe P. Roberts V.A. Osguthorpe D.J. Wolff D.J. Genest M. Hagler A.T. Proteins. 1988; 4: 31-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (1938) Google Scholar) was used with a dielectric constant equal to r (distance in Å).

Open table in a new tab The sequence-specific1H and 15N resonance assignments of both apo- and holoCRBP have been achieved by a combination of homonuclear and heteronuclear multidimensional NMR experiments. The sequential backbone connectivities were obtained by a combined analysis of the three-dimensional 15N-edited TOCSY-HSQC and NOESY-HSQC spectra. Residues Glu72, Asp73, Leu74, Thr75, Gly76, Asp79, and Arg80 could not be identified in the1H/15N-HSQC spectrum of apoCRBP (Fig.1). Because the amide protons of these residues also showed no detectable signals in any of the acquired TOCSY and NOESY spectra, the assignments of the corresponding backbone atom resonances are missing. We believe this is an indication of a high degree of conformational dispersion and/or mobility of the corresponding residues, rather than fast exchange with water. In fact, in the case of the holo-form we could obtain the complete resonance assignments for the entire protein sequence. A similar situation has been reported for other i-LBPs; very weak or missing resonance signals were described in the apo-forms, most of which became better observable upon ligand binding (25Hodsdon M.E. Cistola D.P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1450-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 27Wang L., Li, Y. Abildgaard F. Markley J.L. Yan H.

Multiple proteins likely serve roles as molecular chaperones to assist in folding, assembly with lipids, and regulation of the secretion of apolipoprotein B. In these studies, we developed a strategy to isolate proteins associated with apolipoprotein B in rat livers. The purification consisted of two stages: first, microsomes were prepared from rat liver and treated with chemical cross-linkers, and second, the solubilized proteins were co-immunoprecipitated with antibody against apolipoprotein B. We found that several proteins were cross-linked to apolipoprotein B. The proteins were digested with trypsin, and the released peptides were sequenced by tandem mass spectrometry. The sequences precisely matched 377 peptides in 99 unique proteins. We show that at least two of the identified proteins, ferritin heavy and light chains, can directly bind apolipoprotein B.

The secretion of cholesterol from the liver in humans is tied to the export of apoB into plasma. Hepatic regulation of apoB secretion is chiefly posttranslational (6Pullinger C.R. North J.D.

Lipid Res. 1989; 30: 1065-1077Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); secretion reflects the balance between assembly of this protein with lipids into a lipoprotein particle and intracellular degradation. Both of these competing processes appear to involve several other proteins. The biogenesis of this large (molecular mass greater than 500 kDa) (7Yang C.Y. Chen S.H. Gianturco S.H. Bradley W.A.

Evidence suggests that calnexin, calreticulin, BiP, Erp72, GRP94, and protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) all interact with apoB during its translocation and further biogenesis once it has entered the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (9Ou W.J.

However, the assembly of apoB with lipids into a lipoprotein particle necessitates additional proteins that may be particular to apoB. The lack of solubility of apoB in an aqueous environment, such as the lumen of the ER, necessitates its co-translational association with lipids (12Boren J. Graham L. Wettesten M. Scott J. White A. Olofsson S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9858-9867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This process is facilitated by microsomal triglyceride transport protein (MTP), which plays a crucial role in the initial assembly and regulation of secretion of apoB (13Gordon D.A. Jamil H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1486: 72-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 14Gordon D.A. Jamil H. Sharp D. Mullaney D. Yao Z. Gregg R.E. Wetterau J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In a second step that is sensitive to inhibition by brefeldin A, apoB is assembled with a full complement of lipids into a mature lipoprotein particle (16Rustaeus S. Lindberg K. Boren J.

Molecules of apoB that do not complete the assembly process due to insufficient lipids being available, misfolding, or inhibition of necessary chaperone proteins are targeted for intracellular degradation. Several groups have shown that apoB can be marked for degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway even during its translocation into the ER (18Yeung S.J. Chen S.H. Chan L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13843-13848Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 19Fisher E.A. Zhou M. Mitchell D.M., Wu, X. Omura S. Wang H. Goldberg A.L. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol.

Remarkably, some molecules of ubiquitin-conjugated apoB can be rescued from degradation and secreted when hepatocytes are treated with lipids (23Mitchell D.M. Zhou M. Pariyarath R. Wang H.

The variety of pathways of degradation and possibility of rescue implies that several types of proteins might play roles in determining the fate of molecules of apoB. To gain a more complete view of the assembly, degradation, and regulation of the secretion of apoB, we wished to identify proteins that contact apoB throughout its biogenesis in the hepatocyte. We employed a proteomic approach to isolate and identify all proteins that could be co-immunoprecipitated with apoB after treatment with a chemical cross-linker. We demonstrate that some of the novel proteins bind to apoB and therefore are candidates for roles in its biogenesis. Janet Sparks kindly provided us with a gift of polyclonal antibody against rat apoB; goat polyclonal antibody against human apoB was purchased from Chemicon. The monoclonal antibodies 1D1, Bsol1, and Bsol7 were kindly given by Yves Marcel. Protein G-agarose was purchased from Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories. Silver staining kits were obtained from BioRad. The chemical cross-linkers dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate) (DSP), disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS), and dimethyl 3,3′-dithiobispropionimidate-2 HCl (DTBP) were obtained from Pierce. Colloidal Blue staining kits were purchased from Novex. The plasmid TyB2, ER2566 bacteria, and chitin beads were purchased from New England Biolabs. A kit for generating capped mRNA using SP6 polymerase was purchased from Ambion. Rabbit reticulocyte lysate was from Promega, and [35S]methionine Tran35S-label (specific activity >1000 Ci/mmol) was purchased from ICN. Ultrafree MC 0.22 μm filter units were purchased from Millipore. Livers averaging 4 g each from adult Sprague-Dawley rats of various ages were excised shortly after euthanasia and transported in ice-cold homogenization buffer (HB: 50 mm sodium phosphate, 50 mmpotassium acetate, 1 mm EDTA, 0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.5). The livers were rinsed four times in HB, cut into very small pieces, and passed several times through a parsley grinder. The liver was homogenized in HB using a motorized Teflon-coated Dounce homogenizer at high speed. Tissue debris was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm at 4 °C for 15 min. The supernatant was transferred to a new tube and centrifuged again at 12,000 rpm at 4 °C for 15 min. The supernatant then was layered onto 4 ml of HB adjusted to 1.3m sucrose and centrifuged at 28,000 rpm at 4 °C for 3 h using an AH-629 rotor. After removing the supernatant, the jelly-like microsomal pellet was collected and gently dispersed in a small volume of HB using a hand-held Teflon-coated Dounce homogenizer. We used DSP and DTBP for cross-linking proteins in our samples. Both cross-linking reagents are cleavable, homobifunctional, have similarly sized spacer arms, and permeate membranes. However, unlike DSP, DTBP is readily soluble in aqueous solutions. DSP was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) and added to the sample at a final concentration of 25 mm. DTBP was added directly to the sample at a concentration of 10 mm. Chemical cross-linking was carried out in homogenization buffer. The reaction was incubated at room temperature for 30 min then stopped by adding Tris-HCl to 50 mm and incubating another 15 min. The cross-linked microsomes were collected by centrifugation at 90,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C in a Beckman TL-100 tabletop ultracentrifuge. For some experiments, antibodies were conjugated to either cyanogen bromide-activated beads or cross-linked to protein G-agarose. Cyanogen bromide-activated beads were washed with cold 1 mm HCl for 30 min, followed by brief washes with water and then buffer A (0.1m NaHCO3/0.5 m NaCl (pH 8.5)). Antibody was incubated with the beads for 2 h at room temperature. Unreacted groups were blocked with 1 m ethanolamine (pH 8.0) for 2 h at room temperature. The beads were washed extensively with buffer A followed by five washes with 0.1m acetate (pH 4.0)/0.5 M NaCl. Finally, the beads were washed with TXSWB (1% Triton X-100, 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and used for immunoprecipitation. Protein G-agarose was incubated with antibodies in 50 mmsodium borate (pH 8.2) overnight at 4 °C on a rotator. The beads were washed first with sodium borate buffer and then with 0.2m triethanolamine buffer (pH 8.2). The non-cleavable cross-linker DSS (10 mm) was added, and the reaction was incubated at room temperature for 1 h. After washing with triethanolamine buffer, the beads were incubated in 0.1 methanolamine (pH 8.2) for 10 min at room temperature. The beads were washed in 0.1 m glycine-HCl (pH 2.8) and then in sodium borate buffer. Finally, the washed beads were equilibrated in TXSWB and used for immunoprecipitation. Aliquots of microsomes were completely dissolved in TXSWB; no unsolubilized material remained. Antibody against apoB was added in the form of serum or conjugated to beads (as described above). After incubating the sample with antibody for 1 h at 4 °C, protein G-agarose beads were added to samples containing free antibody in solution, and the tubes were rotated overnight at 4 °C. Subsequently, the beads were washed three times with TXSWB and twice with Tris-NaCl (100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl). The immunoprecipitated proteins were released by boiling for 10 min in SDS loading buffer containing 0.5m dithiothreitol (DTT) and separated by SDS-PAGE. Total RNA was prepared from a confluent T75 flask of HepG2 cells using 2 ml of solution I (4 mguanidine thiocyanate, 20 mm sodium acetate, 0.5% Sarkosyl, and 0.1 mm DTT). The lysate was mixed by inversion with 0.2 ml of 2 m sodium acetate (pH 4), then 2 ml of water-saturated phenol, and finally 0.4 ml of chloroform. After mixing, the solution was kept on ice for 15 min and then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The aqueous phase was transferred to a new tube, and the RNA was precipitated with 2 ml of isopropanol by storing the solution at −20 °C for 30 min before centrifuging at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The RNA pellet was dissolved in 0.3 ml of solution I and precipitated again with 0.3 ml of isopropanol. The RNA pellet was resuspended in 75% ethanol at room temperature and spun at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The pellet was air-dried and resuspended in 100 μl of diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water. Poly(A)-containing mRNA was purified from this total RNA. Oligo dT cellulose was washed in 0.1 m sodium hydroxide, rinsed several times in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water until the pH value of the wash was neutral, and then resuspended in 0.5 mlithium chloride, 10 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1% SDS. The RNA solution was heated to 70 °C for 10 min, adjusted to 0.5 m lithium chloride, and incubated with the oligo dT cellulose on a rotator at room temperature for 1 h. The oligo dT cellulose was recovered by centrifugation in a microcentrifuge at maximum speed for 30 s. The oligo dT cellulose was washed twice with 0.15 m lithium chloride, 10 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.5), 1 mmEDTA, and 0.1% SDS. After the second wash, the resuspended cellulose was transferred to an Ultrafree MC 0.22 μm filter unit. The cellulose was washed three more times in the filter unit followed by centrifugation for 30 s in a microcentrifuge at maximum speed. After the final wash, the filter cup was transferred to a new tube, and the poly(A)-containing RNA was eluted using 2 mm EDTA/0.1% SDS. The poly(A)-containing RNA was used to synthesize cDNAs for the ferritin chains. First strand cDNA was synthesized using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cDNAs were used as templates to generate PCR products encoding ferritin heavy or light chains using primers corresponding to the amino- and carboxyl-terminal ends (R1Nde-FerritinH, GGAATTCCATATGACGACCGCGTCCACCTCG; KpnInt-FerritinH, GGGGTACCCTTGGCAAAGCAGCTTTCATTATCACTGTCTCCC; R1Nde-FerritinL, GGAATTCCATATGAGCTCCCAGATTCGTCAG; KpnInt-FerritinL, GGGGTACCCTTGGCAAAGCAGTCGTGCTTGAGAGTGA). The PCR products were inserted into the plasmid TyB2 at NdeI and KpnI recreating the amino acid residues in the intein so that no additional amino acid residues were encoded between ferritin and the intein. Individual plasmids were verified by sequencing. The plasmids encoding the ferritin fusion proteins and TyB2 itself were transfected into the ER2566 strain of Escherichia coli, and overnight cultures were prepared from single colonies. The next day, the culture was diluted 1:10, and after 1 h 0.2 mm isopropyl thiogalactopyranoside was added. After 5 h, the cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline and disrupted over the horn of a sonicator (Heat Systems-Ultrasonics, Inc.) for a total of 5 min using pulses of 1 min interrupted by cooling on ice. After sonication, the solution was brought to 1% Triton X-100 and mixed gently by inversion, and aliquots were spun in a microcentrifuge at maximum speed for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were pooled in a new tube and incubated with chitin beads on a rotator at room temperature for 7 min. The beads were collected by centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C and washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline. Aliquots of the fusion proteins bound to chitin beads were displayed by SDS-PAGE and quantitated by Coomassie staining. The plasmid pSPB29 encoding apoB29 (the amino-terminal 29% of apoB) downstream of the SP6 promoter was created by inserting a linker encoding a termination codon at the firstAccI site in the plasmid pSPB48 (pSP64 with the 5′-untranslated region of Xenopus globin and apoB48 coding region). This plasmid was used as a template for transcription by SP6 polymerase using a kit. Subsequently, the mRNA was translated into [35S]methionine-labeled protein using rabbit reticulocyte lysate. Two microliters of lysate containing the translation product was diluted in 250 μl of TXSWB and incubated with 6 μg of the fusion proteins bound to beads on a rotator at room temperature for 4 h. The beads were collected by centrifugation at maximum speed in a microcentrifuge and washed three times with 1 ml of TXSWB and two times with Tris-NaCl buffer. The washed beads were then incubated in SDS loading buffer with 0.5 m DTT for 30 min and then boiled for 10 min. The proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by Coomassie staining followed by autoradiography. Coomassie staining was performed to verify that equivalent amounts of fusion proteins were used in the binding assays. Our approach to isolate proteins bound to apoB involved two forms of purification (Fig. 1A). First, we separated intact microsomes containing nascent apoB and associated proteins from cytosolic, nuclear, plasma membrane, and other organellar compartments. Once microsomes were prepared, the proteins were cross-linked using cleavable, homobifunctional, chemical cross-linkers reactive toward amino groups. In the second purification step, apoB and cross-linked proteins were co-immunoprecipitated using polyclonal antibody against apoB. During preparation of the isolated proteins for SDS-PAGE, the samples were treated with 0.5 m DTT, which cleaves the disulfide bond in the chemical cross-linking agents. The co-immunoprecipitated proteins were then separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by staining (Fig. 1A). We anticipated needing a large quantity of antibodies for immunoprecipitating rat apoB. However, antibodies against rat apoB are not commercially available. Because apoB is such a large protein, it is likely that several epitopes are conserved in both rat and human apoB. Therefore, we screened commercially available antibodies raised against human apoB for reactivity against rat apoB. We specifically sought an antibody that would immunoprecipitate rat apoB as efficiently as an aliquot of antiserum raised against rat apoB that was kindly provided by Janet Sparks. Aliquots of rat liver homogenate were subjected to immunoprecipitation using some polyclonal and some monoclonal antibodies against human apoB. For comparison, the polyclonal antibody against rat apoB was used for immunoprecipitation of one aliquot. The immunoprecipitated apoB was visualized by Western blotting using the antibody against rat apoB (Fig. 1B). The monoclonal antibodies appear specific to epitopes in human apoB that are not present in rat apoB (Fig. 1B, lanes 2–4). The three commercial polyclonal antibodies against human apoB had varying efficacy in immunoprecipitating rat apoB (Fig. 1B, lanes 5–7). We found that polyclonal antibody against human apoB obtained from Chemicon International immunoprecipitated rat apoB48 and apoB100 as well as antibody raised against rat apoB (Fig.1B, compare lanes 1 and 7). We used antibody from the same lot from Chemicon for all subsequent experiments. In an effort to detect proteins that bind to apoB, we prepared microsomes, treated some aliquots with chemical cross-linkers, and subjected the solubilized proteins to immunoprecipitation with antibody against apoB. Uncross-linked samples showed a sharp band of apoB near the top of the gel and a few other bands of faster migration (Fig.2, lane 1). Two broad bands corresponding to the eluted heavy and light chains dominate each lane (Fig. 2). When the intact microsomes were treated with the cross-linker DSP, some new bands are visible (Fig. 2, lane 2;e.g. see the 18–29-kDa range). When cross-linking was carried out using DTBP, many new bands emerge (Fig. 2, lane 3). This pattern of bands was consistent despite variations in the concentration of microsomal protein during cross-linking (data not shown). Furthermore, we always detected more bands using DTBP compared with DSP (data not shown). We selected DTBP for further studies because a larger amount of proteins are cross-linked to apoB with this reagent (Fig. 2). Because the length of the spacer arm between the two reactive imidoester groups of DTBP is 11.9 Å, these bands correspond to proteins that contact or are within close proximity to apoB. The prominent bands corresponding to heavy and light chains posed two problems. First, the increased amount of antibody necessary for a larger scale preparation for protein sequencing would overload and distort the gel lane. Second, the broad bands obscure underlying and neighboring bands rendering them undetectable. Attempts to elute apoB from the polyclonal antibody while leaving antibody bound to the solid matrix were unsuccessful. Therefore, we cross-linked the antibodies to protein G-agarose and used the conjugated antibodies for immunoprecipitation. Antibodies were conjugated via coupling to cyanogen bromide-activated beads or by cross-linking antibodies on protein G-agarose using the non-cleavable agent DSS. Once conjugation was complete, the beads were washed several times to remove unbound antibodies. We verified that the conjugated heavy and light chain did not elute visibly from the beads despite boiling in SDS and DTT (data not shown). Using conjugated antibodies, we compared the proteins immunoprecipitated from aliquots of uncross-linked microsomes (Fig. 3, lane 1) with microsomes treated with DTBP (Fig. 3, lane 2). The conjugated antibody co-immunoprecipitated several proteins that are not readily evident in the uncross-linked sample. Furthermore, the conjugated antibody co-immunoprecipitated a very similar pattern of proteins from cross-linked microsomes as did unconjugated antibodies (free in solution) that were collected subsequently on protein G-agarose (Fig. 3, compare lanes 2and 3). The pattern and intensity of the bands is very similar regardless of whether the antibodies were conjugated. The lack of heavy and light chains from the conjugated antibody reveals other bands (Fig. 3, lane 2) and permits increasing the scale of the purification without overloading the gel with protein. Thus, conjugated antibody offers significant advantages without significantly altering the recovery of co-immunoprecipitated proteins. Using this approach to isolate proteins that co-immunoprecipitate with apoB, we purified sufficient masses of each band for protein sequencing by mass spectrometry. In the previous analytical scale experiments, silver staining was used to detect bands that in some cases were at the threshold of detection in the range of 1 ng. To ensure adequate recovery of peptides from the gel, we anticipated needing roughly 50–100 ng of each band. Microsomes were prepared from the livers of four adult rats, treated with DTBP, solubilized, and subjected to immunoprecipitation with conjugated antibody against apoB. After cleaving the cross-linker, the released proteins were separated in one lane by SDS-PAGE and visualized using a colloidal Coomassie stain. This staining kit has a reported sensitivity of 10 ng. The gel used for sequencing is shown in Fig. 4. In view of the cost of protein sequencing, we excised and pooled bands of similar migration into nine pools. The excised bands were given to the Harvard Microchemistry Facility for sequencing. After the proteins were digested with trypsin in the gel, the released peptides were sequenced by microcapillary reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography nano-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry on a Finnigan LCQ quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer. The peptide data was correlated with known sequences using the algorithm Sequest (24Eng J.K. McCormick A.L. Yates J.R.I. J. Am. Soc. Mass. Spectrom. 1994; 5: 976-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (5444) Google Scholar) and programs developed at the Harvard Microchemistry Facility (25Chittum H.S. Lane W.S. Carlson B.A. Roller P.P. Lung F.D. Lee B.J. Hatfield D.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10866-10870Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Finally, the peptide sequences were reviewed manually for fidelity and consensus with known proteins. A total of 377 peptides were matched to 120 known data base entries and 99 unique proteins. The proteins identified in each pool of bands is shown in Fig. 5. The peptides ranged in length from seven to 31 amino acid residues. On average, the median lengths were nearly 14 amino acid residues. The chance of an exact match of two peptide sequences over 14 amino acids is about 1:1.6 × 1018. This calculation lends considerable credence to the identity of the matched protein, and the presence of longer or multiple peptides corresponding to the same protein strengthens the identification further. Two contaminants did show up in our results. Despite an effort to handle the gel with washed gloves as little as possible, keratin was detected by this highly sensitive procedure in four of the nine pools of bands and accounted for 18 of the matches overall. This contamination also could have occurred during handling of the glass plates prior to pouring the gel. The other contaminant stems from the immunoglobulin chains that eluted from the beads probably in small amounts because they account for 22 of the 377 peptides. Thus, 40 of the 377 peptides could be the result of contamination. The rest of the matches appear to derive from the samples. Nearly all of the peptides correspond to proteins of molecular mass that match their group indicating that significant degradation did not occur. (Note that the range of apparent molecular masses of the matched proteins, estimated from where the bands were excised, is approximate especially for proteins of slower migration.) The principal exceptions are peptides from keratin at scattered places on the gel, uricase (also called urate oxidase), α and β globin, one peptide matching a cytochrome P450 enzyme, and two peptides that match PDI and BiP found in pool 3 (in the 20-kDa range). There were 40 unique ribosomal proteins identified. Presumably, these proteins were cross-linked to chains of apoB that had not finished elongation; the isolation of translation elongation factor α also supports this idea. Most of the remaining proteins are hepatic enzymes and not structural proteins, although two forms of actin did occur. Cytochrome P450 enzymes accounted for 12 matches. Of the 38 remaining proteins, some are known to contact apoB during its biogenesis such as PDI and BiP. We next investigated whether some of these newly identified proteins can bind apoB.FIG. 5Table of proteins cross-linked to apoB identified by sequencing. The pooled bands from Fig. 4 were sequenced by mass spectrometry (see “Purification and Sequencing of Proteins” for details). The size range of the pooled bands is only an estimate. Proteins that were identified by exact peptide matches are listed with their accession number in the National Center for Biotechnology Information protein data base. If peptides matched proteins from different species, the first match encountered in the data base is shown. The molecular mass for each full-length protein in the data base was calculated from its amino acid sequence; some of the matched data base entries are for fragments (denoted frag). The number of matching peptides and their median length are also shown. Within each pool, the proteins are listed in descending order based on the number of matching peptides. In pool 3, band 1a (10 kDa) was include"

However, due to the lack of a cell culture system supporting efficient HCV replication, it is very difficult to obtain relevant information on the functions of this glycoprotein oligomer. To get better insights into its biological and biochemical properties, HCV envelope glycoprotein heterodimer expressed by a vaccinia virus recombinant was purified by immunoaffinity. Purified E1E2 heterodimer was recognized by conformation-dependent monoclonal antibodies, showing that the proteins were properly folded. In addition, it interacted with human CD81, a putative HCV receptor, as well as with human low and very low density lipoproteins, which have been shown to be associated with infectious HCV particles isolated from patients. Purified E1E2 heterodimer was also reconstituted into liposomes. E1E2-liposomes were recognized by a conformation-dependent monoclonal antibody as well as by human CD81. Together, these data indicate that E1E2-liposomes are a valuable tool to study the molecular requirements for HCV binding to target cells."
https://openalex.org/W2093084247,"Although Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) has been shown to regulate the activity of NHE3, the potential reciprocal interaction of NHE3 to modulate the protein kinase A (PKA)-dependent regulation of CFTR in epithelial cells is still unknown. In the present work, we describe experiments to define the interactions between CFTR and NHE3 with the regulatory, scaffolding protein, NHERF that organize their PKA-dependent regulation in a renal epithelial cell line that expresses endogenous CFTR. The expression of rat NHE3 significantly decreased PKA-dependent activation of CFTR without altering CFTR expression, and this decrease was prevented by mutation of either of the two rat NHE3 PKA target serines to alanine (S552A or S605A). Inhibition of CFTR expression by antisense treatment resulted in an acute decrease in PKA-dependent regulation of NHE3 activity. CFTR, NHE3, and ezrin were recognized by NHERF-2 but not NHERF-1 in glutathione <i>S</i>-transferase pull-down experiments. Ezrin may function as a protein kinase A anchoring protein (AKAP) in this signaling complex, because blocking the binding of PKA to an AKAP by incubation with the S-Ht31 peptide inhibited the PKA-dependent regulation of CFTR in the absence of NHE3. In the A6-NHE3 cells S-Ht31 blocked the PKA regulation of NHE3 whereas it now failed to affect the regulation of CFTR. We conclude that CFTR and NHE3 reciprocally interact via a shared regulatory complex comprised of NHERF-2, ezrin, and PKA."

However, ablation of the calpain small subunit gene necessary for function of the conventional calpains did not result in decreased rate of proliferative growth of mouse stem cells under routine culture conditions. To address the reasons for this discrepancy, Chinese hamster ovary cell lines were established that overexpress the calpain inhibitor protein, calpastatin, under control of the ecdysone congener, ponasterone A.

Various members of the calpain protease family participate in signal transduction pathways as diverse as adaptation of yeast to an alkaline environment (3Denison S.H. Orejas M. Arst H.N., Jr. J.

The conventional calpains, m- and μ-calpain, are ubiquitously expressed, require calcium ion for activity, and are subject to regulation in most cells by an endogenous inhibitor protein, calpastatin. Very recently, a number of studies have shown that calpains are important regulators of cell-substratum interactions and cell motility (6Fukai F. Ohtani T. Ueki M. Katayama T. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1993; 30: 225-229PubMed Google Scholar, 7Huttenlocher A. Palecek S.P., Lu, Q. Zhang W. Mellgren R.L. Lauffenburger D.A. Ginsberg M.H. Horwitz A.F. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 685-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Rear cell detachment and migration of CHO1 cells was shown to be inhibited by cell permeable calpain inhibitors (7Huttenlocher A. Palecek S.P., Lu, Q. Zhang W. Mellgren R.L. Lauffenburger D.A. Ginsberg M.H. Horwitz A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32719-32722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). These studies indicated that calpains are required for remodeling or weakening of the cytoskeleton-integrin linkage to allow efficient rear detachment during migration. Other studies have suggested a role for calpains in integrin clustering necessary for T-cells to bind to ICAM-1 (intercellular adhesion molecule 1) (9Rock M.T. Dix A.R. Brooks W.H. Roszman T.L. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 261: 260-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Cell attachment to substratum and subsequent spreading may also require participation of calpains. The spreading of NIH-3T3 fibroblasts on culture plates was inhibited by calpeptin and several other calpain inhibitors (11Potter D.A. Tirnauer J.S. Janssen R. Croall D.E. Hughes C.N. Fiacco K.A. Mier J.W. Maki M. Herman I.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 647-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). It was also inhibited in cells transfected with calpastatin. Recently, EGF activation of m-calpain in rat kidney fibroblasts has been reported (8Glading A. Chang P. Lauffenburger D.A. Wells A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2390-2398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). IP-10 partially prevented calpain activation in response to EGF (12Shiraha H. Glading A. Gupta K. Wells A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 243-254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It also counteracted EGF's effect on fibroblast detachment from substrate and migration. Calpains may influence cell proliferation. Calpain inhibitors have potent anti-mitogenic effects (13March K.L. Wilensky R.L. Roeske R.W. Hathaway D.R. Circ. Res. 1993; 72: 413-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 14Zhang W., Lu, Q. Xie Z.J. Mellgren R.L. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 255-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and μ-calpain antisense oligonucleotides were shown to decrease growth of CHO cell colonies (15Zhang W. Lane R.D. Mellgren R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18825-18830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Calpains appear to be necessary for the clonal growth of pre-adipocytes that is required prior to adipocyte differentiation (16Patel Y.M. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1279-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar,17Patel Y.M. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17653-17660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). However, the involvement of calpains in cell proliferation is controversial. Many of the cell-permeable inhibitors used in previous studies are not absolutely specific for calpains. Moreover, mouseCapn4(−/−) stem cells, which do not express the small subunit present in m- and μ-calpain, grow at the same rate as Capn4(+/+) cells (18Arthur J.S. Elce J.S. Hegadorn C. Williams K. Greer P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4474-4481Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). In the present study, CHO cell lines that express calpastatin under control of the insect hormone, ponasterone A, were utilized to address the role of calpains in proliferative cell growth. We present evidence that calpains do contribute to proliferation of CHO cells and mouse fibroblasts, but only when the cells are growing in isolated colonies attached to a growth surface. EcR-CHO cells were obtained from Invitrogen.Capn4 homozygous knockout cells (Capn4−/−) and wild-type cells (Capn4+/+) were kindly supplied by Dr. John Elce (Queen's University, Canada).

A QIAquick PCR Purification kit, a QIAquick Gel Extraction kit, and a QIAprep Spin Miniprep kit were purchased from Qiagen. Electrophoresis supplies and nitrocellulose membranes used in immunoblotting were obtained from Bio-Rad. Alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG), 3-indolyl phosphate, and nitro blue tetrazolium were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. Human erythrocyte calpastatin was purified to near homogeneity by established procedures (19Mellgren R.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 150: 170-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Antibodies used for Western blotting were: mouse monoclonal antibody 5-8A, which was developed against human calpastatin and did not cross-react with hamster calpastatin, and mouse monoclonal antibody P-1, which recognizes the small subunit common to both μ- and m-calpain. EcR-CHO cells and derived transfected cell lines were cultured in HF-12 medium containing 10% FBS. The FLC-EcR-CHO cell lines were established by transfecting pIND (SP1)/V5-His vector containing human full-length calpastatin (FLC) cDNA into EcR-CHO cells by electroporation. Mock transfected control cells were obtained by transfecting the vector alone into EcR-CHO cells. FLC-EcR-CHO and mock transfected cells were cultured in selection medium containing 1.4 mg/ml Geneticin and 250 μg/ml Zeocin every four to five passages. Capn4(+/+) and Capn4 (−/−) cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10% FBS. Unless otherwise indicated, all cells were cultured as monolayers at 37 °C and 5% CO2. In some experiments, cells were cultured suspended in HF-12 medium plus 10% fetal calf serum containing 0.75% agar. Cells were trypsinized and washed twice with HBSS, and the cell number was determined using a Coulter cell counter. Approximately 80,000 cells were transferred to a new tube and centrifuged to form a pellet. The supernatant was removed by aspiration, and 80 μl of sterile H2O and 40 μl of SDS-PAGE sample prep buffer were added and mixed with the cell pellet by pipetting. The sample was heated at 100 °C for 5 min, and 40 μl was applied to 10% polyacrylamide gels. Protein concentrations in cell homogenate 10,000 × g supernatants were determined using the BCA method (20Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18713) Google Scholar) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were grown in T75 flasks to confluence, washed three times with 37 °C HBSS, and lysed with 0.4 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer I (pH 7.4): 50 mm imidazole-HCl, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 10 μm pepstatin A, 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1% Triton X-100. Cell lysates were scraped off the flasks and homogenized for ∼8 strokes. After removing the cell debris by centrifugation for 10 min at 10,000 ×g at 4 °C, 25 μl of supernatant was assayed for calpain activity, using 14C-methylated casein as the substrate (21Mellgren R.L. Repetti A. Muck T.C. Easly J. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7203-7209Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To partially purify calpastatin, cell pellets were homogenized in lysis buffer II (50 mm imidazole-HCl, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mmEGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1% Triton X-100, pH 7.4) by passage through pipette tips several times. Because calpastatin is known to be resistant to heat denaturation, it was partially purified by heat treatment of the homogenate at 100 °C for 10 min and centrifuging at 14,000 × g for 10 min to remove denatured proteins. Only the supernatant fraction contained calpastatin activity. Calpastatin activity was determined by its ability to inhibit a defined amount of purified human erythrocyte μ-calpain (1 ng/μl) in the standard 14C-caseinolytic assay. Proliferative cell growth was measured directly by counting suspended trypsinized cells from 6-well plates using a Coulter cell counter. At least two counts were taken for each sample, and the average was taken for calculating the cell number. In some experiments, cell growth was estimated by measurement of MTT reductase activity as described previously (22Mosmann T. J. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 65: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (46884) Google Scholar). Cells were trypsinized at confluence, washed with HF-12 medium once, and resuspended in fresh HF-12 medium containing 10% FBS. The cells were added at a concentration of 105 cells/ml to 6-well plates at 37 °C and then observed at 30, 60, and 120 min using inverted phase-contrast microscopy. Cell detachment was assessed (a) by measuring the detached cell number in the supernatant after 5 min of shaking (power level 5) of the culture plates on a Mini-Orbital Shaker (BellCo); and (b) by measuring the adherent cell number after successive PBS washes as described previously (23Harder K.H. Moller N.P.H. Peacock J.W. Jirik F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31890-31900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), with minor modifications. Briefly, cells were allowed to adhere and spread in serum-containing medium to 75–85% confluence. Medium was then carefully removed, and cells were gently washed three times with Ca2+- and Mg2+-free PBS for 5 min/wash. Wash solutions were then discarded and the cells remaining on the plate were trypsinized and counted. Percent detachment was calculated by comparison with control plates that were not washed. Cell migration was assessed by the ability of the cells to move into an adjacent area as described previously (24Shiraha H. Glading A. Gupta K. Wells A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 243-253Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were plated at high dilution on a 6-well plate and grown as isolated colonies in the presence or absence of ponasterone A. Colonies were scratched with a sterile pipette tip to produce cell-free zones. The plates were then incubated at 37 °C for observation of cell migration into the denuded zones. Photographs were taken at 0, 12, and 24 h. The Delta Differential Display kit (CLONTECH) was utilized for differential display analysis, using the manufacturer's directions throughout. The protocol is based on the original description of differential display analysis (25Liang P. Pardee A.B. Science. 1992; 257: 967-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (4707) Google Scholar). Purified total RNA fractions from the cell lines utilized were treated with DNase to remove traces of genomic DNA that might have interfered with the display assays. Briefly, RNA was isolated from FLC-EcR-CHO clone 83 and mock transfected EcR-CHO cells that were cultured in the absence or in the presence of ponasterone A, giving a total of four samples for differential display. After DNase treatment, first-strand cDNA synthesis was carried out, and differential display PCR was performed using 90 combinations of the 5′ and 3′ primers supplied with the kit. The 33P-labeled PCR bands were separated on a DNA sequencing gel, and autoradiograms were visually inspected for alterations in expression patterns in the four samples. Bands that were selectively enriched or depleted in the clone 83 plus ponasterone sample were selected for PCR amplification, 32P labeling, and use as probes in Northern blotting against poly(A)-RNA isolated from each of the four cell cultures. The Northern-verified positive band was extracted from the differential display gel, re-amplified by PCR using the same differential display primer set, and T/A-cloned into pT-Adv vector. TOP10F′ E. coliwere transformed with the vector, and two positive clones were selected and amplified for vector isolation and sequencing of the insert. Data were analyzed by unpaired Student's t test. Differences in means were considered to be statistically significant if p < 0.05. Error bars in the graphs represent standard deviation. Two EcR-CHO clones stably transfected with human full-length calpastatin were generated and isolated as described under “Methods.” These cell lines are designated FLC-EcR-CHO clone 83 (clone 83) and FLC-EcR-CHO clone 106 (clone 106). Both were capable of expressing human calpastatin when cultured in the presence of 5 μm ponasterone A (Fig.1A). Both of the clones also expressed small amounts of human calpastatin constitutively. Maximum calpastatin expression was observed after ∼3–4 days of exposure to ponasterone (Fig. 1B). In other studies not shown, the calpastatin was shown to be expressed almost entirely in soluble form. Because we wished to use the calpastatin-expressing clones to study the effects of calpain inhibition on cell growth, it was important to monitor calpain content upon calpastatin overexpression. Protein immunoblot analysis indicated that calpain small subunit expression was not substantially altered by induced overexpression of calpastatin (Fig. 1C). Although the experiment depicted in Fig. 1suggests a modest increase in calpain at the 96-h time point plus ponasterone, this was not reproducible in other experiments. Because both m- and μ-calpain depend on small subunit for activity, these results indicate that levels of functional calpain protein are not influenced by the degree of calpastatin overexpression achieved in our studies. Moreover, the content of μ-calpain large subunit did not change (data not shown), indicating that the balance of μ- and m-calpain was not altered. To determine if the expressed calpastatin was capable of inhibiting calpain, heat-treated cell lysate fractions were prepared and assayed for calpastatin as described under “Methods.” Both human calpastatin-expressing clones displayed increased calpastatin activity in response to ponasterone, whereas the mock transfected cells did not (Fig. 2). There was no apparent effect of calpastatin overexpression on the growth of cells plated at cell densities as low as 1.5 × 103 cells/cm2 (Fig.3A). These results agree with previous studies on growth of Capn4(−/−)embryonic mouse stem cells (20Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18713) Google Scholar) and do not support the notion that the conventional calpains are important for controlling cell proliferation. However, there are indications that calpain activity may be important for controlling clonal growth of cells (15Zhang W. Lane R.D. Mellgren R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18825-18830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 17Patel Y.M. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17653-17660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). To investigate this further, cells were plated at clonal densities (2–4 cells/cm2). Under these conditions, induction of calpastatin expression resulted in a significant decrease in growth of colonies (Fig. 3, B and C). Ponasterone A had no detectable effect on clonal growth of the mock transfected EcR-CHO cells. There was no apparent difference in plating efficiencies of the clone 83, clone 106, and mock transfected cells, which varied in different experiments between 40 and 50%. Clone 83 and 106 cells also grew more slowly than mock transfected cells in the absence of ponasterone (Fig. 3, B and C). It is tempting to speculate that this was the result of leakage of human calpastatin expression (Fig. 1A). However, in the absence of calpastatin overexpression, clones 83 and 106 contained nearly the same total calpastatin levels (i.e. human plus hamster) as the mock transfected cells (Fig. 2, compare minus ponasterone values in panels A and B with panel C). It may be that the splice form of human calpastatin utilized for transfection has unique growth inhibitory properties relative to endogenous hamster calpastatin forms. However, the slower basal growth rates could be intrinsic properties of the founder cells for clones 83 and 106. Further studies will be required to address this issue. Morphologically, the clonal growth of calpastatin-overexpressing cells was characterized by symmetrical round colonies, with few cells growing between (not shown). This growth pattern might have reflected a decreased ability of calpastatin-overexpressing cells to detach from colonies, or a decreased ability to re-attach and grow between the colonies. Alternatively, the cells may not have been able to migrate on the substratum to populate the inter-colony area. Either hypothesis is supported by the many recent studies indicating that calpains are important mediators of cell-substratum attachment and cell motility. To address these issues, experiments were carried out as described under “Methods,” to assess cell attachment, detachment, and mobility. Induction of calpastatin expression had no influence on attachment of trypsinized cells to culture dishes: clone 83 cells adhered to the surface within 30 min of plating and began to spread at 60 min, and ∼80% of cells were spread at 120 min, independent of calpastatin expression (data not shown). There was no apparent effect of calpastatin overexpression on cell detachment produced by washing with PBS (Fig. 4A) or agitation (Fig. 4B). Moreover, cell motility did not appear to be altered: Calpastatin overexpression had no apparent effect on the rate of migration of cells into scratch-denuded areas of colonies (Fig.5). Because attachment factors may influence calpain effects on cell migration (7Huttenlocher A. Palecek S.P., Lu, Q. Zhang W. Mellgren R.L. Lauffenburger D.A. Ginsberg M.H. Horwitz A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32719-32722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar), growth on culture dishes coated with 10 μg/ml fibronectin was studied. Under these conditions, ponasterone was still capable of decreasing clonal growth of clone 83 cells (data not shown).FIG. 5Calpastatin overexpression did not affect cell motility. Colonies of clone 83 and mock transfected cells were grown with or without ponasterone A. A sterile pipette tip was utilized to produce a scratch across the colony, and growth of cells into the denuded zone was monitored by light microscopy.Arrows denote the nearly filled scratch zones at 24 h.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) These experiments indicated that decreased clonal growth was not the result of an obvious defect in cell-substrate attachment or motility. Because the results of these studies brought to question the importance of attachment, the growth of calpastatin-overexpressing cells in suspension culture was investigated. The growth rate of clone 83 or clone 106 cells suspended in 0.75% agar was not significantly reduced by induction of calpastatin expression (Fig.6). Thus, attachment of cells to substratum is required for the signaling events that lead to decreased colony growth upon calpastatin overexpression. As discussed above, initial characterization of the cell biological properties of the calpastatin-overexpressing cells did not provide a mechanism for the decreased clonal growth observed. Moreover, in other studies it was not possible to detect differences in response to various growth factors or to identify a factor in clone 83-conditioned medium, which could account for the alteration of growth rate (data not shown). As another approach to understanding the mechanism for calpastatin's effect on growth, an evaluation of alteration of gene expression was initiated using the differential display assay, as described under “Methods.” Analysis of differential display gels utilizing 90 primer sets revealed a number of bands that differed in expression in the two different cell lines or were altered in both cell lines upon exposure to ponasterone A (not shown). Relatively few signals were specifically altered only in clone 83 cells exposed to ponasterone A, and of these only one was confirmed by Northern blot analysis (Fig.7). A single mRNA species at about 1 kb was detected. This differential display band was re-amplified by PCR and cloned into pT-Adv vector by T/A cloning as described under “Methods.” Northern blot analysis, using the insert from each of two clones as the probe, confirmed decreased expression specifically in ponasterone A-treated clone 83 cells (data not shown). The two independent clones contained the same 526-bp insert sequence, including a single coding sequence for a putative 100-residue protein, which we have named Csr for calpastatinrepressed (GenBankTM accession AF484417). Blastp and Blastx analysis (26Gish W. States D.J. Nat. Genet. 1993; 3: 266-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1388) Google Scholar) revealed the presence of a region in Csr that appeared in several other proteins (Fig.8). The greatest homology resided in a small mouse protein of unknown function (Fig. 8, B and C, line 2). Interestingly, the next closest homology was found in two apparent ubiquitin transferase enzymes, NEDD-4 E3 ubiquitin transferase, and a putative small E2 ubiquitin transferase. The other protein displaying significant homology was a putative nonspecific cation channel (27Suzuki M. Murata M. Ikeda M. Miyoshi T. Imai M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 242: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). While our studies were ongoing, Arthuret al. (18Arthur J.S. Elce J.S. Hegadorn C. Williams K. Greer P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4474-4481Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar) disrupted the gene for the small subunit common to both m- and μ-calpain (Capn4) in mice, by homologous recombination techniques. The homozygous knockout mice died in utero (18Arthur J.S. Elce J.S. Hegadorn C. Williams K. Greer P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4474-4481Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar); however, fibroblasts could be rescued from embryos, for cell culture studies. Capn4(−/−) cells did not appear to possess active conventional calpains (18Arthur J.S. Elce J.S. Hegadorn C. Williams K. Greer P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4474-4481Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar) and would be predicted to display a growth phenotype similar to the calpastatin overexpressing cells reported in this contribution. In fact, colony growth was slower for Capn4(−/−) fibroblasts, but at higher plating densities there was no detectable difference in growth rate compared with Capn4(+/+) fibroblasts (Fig.9). The calpastatin-overexpressing clones established in these studies should be a valuable tool for assessing the intracellular functions of the conventional calpains, m- and μ-calpain. Unfortunately, little is known about sensitivity of the other calpain family members to inhibition by calpastatin, because they are poorly characterized as proteins or enzymes. An eye lens-specific splice variant of Capn3 does not appear to be sensitive to calpastatin (28Nakamura Y. Fukiage C., Ma, H. Shih M. Azuma M. Shearer T.R. Exp. Eye Res. 1999; 69: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Importantly, calpastatin has never been shown to possess significant inhibitory potential against other important intracellular proteases, including caspases and the proteasome. The availability of these cell lines should complement studies carried out with cells derived from knockout genetics. In the latter, one can always posit alterations in developmental pathways secondary to gene ablation to account for phenotypes, or lack of phenotype, associated with the specific knockout. On the other hand, use of theCapn4(−/−) fibroblasts (Fig. 9) provides compelling evidence that it is calpastatin's ability to inhibit calpains, not some unrelated property of the inhibitor, that is important for its influence on clonal growth in our studies. The mechanism for calpain effects on cell proliferation in colonies has not been resolved by the studies so far. However, some important aspects of this phenomenon may prove useful in further investigations. The colony phenotype, with few cells interspersed between colonies, suggested that the defect of clonal growth secondary to calpastatin expression might be the result of ablation of established calpain effects on cell detachment, attachment, or motility. Cells growing in crowded colonies might require the ability to migrate to open areas of the culture vessel to grow at optimum rates. Cells plated at higher density would not reach conditions of “crowding” prior to becoming a confluent monolayer. Attachment to a solid support appeared to be important for the growth inhibitory properties of calpastatin expression, because clone 83 cells grown in suspension were not inhibited by induction of calpastatin (Fig. 6). Notwithstanding these considerations, no evidence for a defect in cell detachment, attachment, or motility was uncovered in the present studies. It may be that a more sophisticated analysis will reveal some degree of alteration in one or more of these properties. However, a dramatic change in cell-matrix interactions or motility seems an unlikely explanation in view of the results of our initial studies. Moreover, protein immunoblot analysis indicated that steady-state levels of spectrin, talin, and ezrin, proteins thought to be important targets for calpain effects on cytoskeletal-plasmalemma interactions during migration (11Potter D.A. Tirnauer J.S. Janssen R. Croall D.E. Hughes C.N. Fiacco K.A. Mier J.W. Maki M. Herman I.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 647-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), were not detectably altered by calpastatin overexpression (data not shown). Assessment of alterations in gene expression specifically associated with calpastatin-induced decrease of clonal growth rates might provide evidence for the molecular interactions or signaling pathways involved in this phenomenon. To initiate these efforts, differential display analysis was employed. After performing differential display reactions with 90 different primer sets, ∼3000 separate PCR products were detected on gel autoradiograms. Of these only one (Csr) was found to represent an mRNA specifically down-regulated in clone 83 cells following calpastatin induction. It is intriguing that a Csr-like sequence is found in two ubiquitin transferases. However, the small Csr protein does not contain a consensus ubiquitin transferase domain. Therefore, it is premature to suggest that down-regulation of the calpain system by overexpression of calpastatin may result in decreased ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. However, future studies may reveal such a relationship. For example, Csr might bind to a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme and regulate its activity. It is possible that additional genes are specifically induced or repressed following overexpression of calpastatin. However, it does not appear that the number will be great, given that one positive clone was isolated so far from ∼3000 differential display bands. Our experiments have an internal positive control: Differential display signals corresponding to human calpastatin mRNA should be detectable in ponasterone-induced clone 83 cell samples. Analysis will continue, utilizing additional differential display primer pairs, until several positive control signals have been obtained. Identification of the panel of genes underexpressed or overexpressed in response to increased calpastatin will allow further studies to determine if experimental alteration of their expression levels will restore wild-type colony growth to Capn4(−/−)fibroblasts, or upon calpastatin induction in clone 83. Lastly, it should be emphasized that identification of an effect of calpain on clonal growth has important implications for the potential therapeutic use of calpain inhibition in treatment of cancer. Calpains are currently thought to be important in muscle wasting (cachexia) in cancer (reviewed in Ref. 29Hasselgren P.O. Fischer J.E. Ann. Surg. 2001; 233: 9-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Several recent studies indicate that calpains are also involved in cell motility (7Huttenlocher A. Palecek S.P., Lu, Q. Zhang W.

If they are also important for colony growth, as the present results indicate, calpain-selective inhibitors may prove effective not only in suppressing migration of cancer cells but also in slowing clonal expansion of metastases.

The fusion peptide plays a crucial role in triggering this reaction. To clarify how the fusion peptide exerts this specific function, we carried out biophysical studies of three fusion peptide analogs of influenza virus hemagglutinin HA2, namely E5, G13L, and L17A. E5 exhibits an activity similar to the native fusion peptide, whereas G13L and L17A, which are two point mutants of the E5 analog, possess much less fusion activity. Our CD data showed that the conformations of these three analogs in SDS micelles are pH-dependent, with higher α-helical contents at acidic pH. Tryptophan fluorescence emission experiments indicated that these three analogs insert deeper into lipid bilayers at acidic pH. The three-dimensional structure of the E5 analog in SDS micelles at pH 4.0 revealed that two segments, Leu2–Glu11 and Trp14–Ile18, form amphipathic helical conformations, with Gly12-Gly13 forming a hinge. The hydrophobic residues in the N- and C-terminal helices form a hydrophobic cluster. At neutral pH, however, the C-terminal helix of Trp14–Ile18 reduces dramatically, and the hydrophobic core observed at acidic pH is severely disrupted. We suggest that the disruption of the C-terminal helix renders the E5 analog fusion-inactive at neutral pH. Furthermore, the decrease of the hinge and the reduction of fusion activity in G13L reveal the importance of the hinge in fusion activity. Also, the decrease in the C-terminal helix and the reduction of fusion activity in L17A demonstrates the importance of the C-terminal helix in fusion activity. Based on these biophysical studies, we propose a model that illustrates the structural change of the HA2 fusion peptide analog and explains how the analog interacts with the lipid bilayer at different pH values.

For example, infection by enveloped viruses involves fusion of viral and cellular membranes with subsequent transfer of viral genetic material into the cell. Hemagglutinin (HA)1 is a homotrimeric surface glycoprotein of the influenza virus with a relative molecular mass of 220 kDa. Each monomer of HA consists of the receptor-binding HA1 domain (328 residues) and the membrane-interacting HA2 domain (221 residues) linked by a single disulfide bond. The membrane fusion activity of HA has been measured both in vivo and in vitro by a variety of techniques, including hemolysis (1Skehel J.J. Bayley P.M. Brown E.B. Martin S.R.

Chem. 1995; 270: 27606-27614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The N-terminal 20 residues of the HA2 domain have been identified as the fusion peptide, which is capable of inserting into the target membrane and thereby plays a crucial role in triggering membrane fusion. The crystal structure of soluble trimers (BHA) at neutral pH, in which each HA2 chain after residue 175 is cleaved, revealed that the fusion peptide is buried inside the protein (9Wilson I.A. Skehel J.J. Wiley D.C. Nature. 1981; 289: 366-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (1972) Google Scholar). In the crystal structure study, TBHA2 was prepared by successive digestion with trypsin and thermolysin from BHA at pH 5.0. Each monomer of TBHA2 consists of residues 38–175 of the HA2 chain and residues 1–27 of the HA1 chain linked by a disulfide bridge, and the fusion peptide becomes exposed to the aqueous phase in the crystal structure of TBHA2 (10Bullough P.A. Hughson F.M. Skehel J.J. Wiley D.C. Nature. 1994; 371: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (1370) Google Scholar). The difference in the location of the fusion peptide between BHA and TBHA2 accounts for the membrane fusion induction between viral and endosomal membranes occurring at acidic pH for HA. A comparison of the fusion peptide sequences (20 amino acids) in various subtypes of influenza virus A strains (11Barker W.C. Garavelli J.S. Haft D.H. Hunt L.T. Marzec C.R. Orcutt B.C.

Chem. 1999; 79: 153-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) demonstrated that residues Gly1–Glu11, Gly13, Trp14, and Gly16 are conserved. Also, Gly20is rather conserved with only one exception of Val20 in the A/duck/Hong Kong/231/77 virus strain. Position 12 includes either Gly or Asn, position 17 includes either Met or Leu, and position 18 includes either Ile or Val. Thus, the native fusion peptide of the influenza HA2 is highly hydrophobic, extremely aggregative, and hardly soluble in aqueous solution. The fusion activities of several HA2 fusion peptide mutants have been extensively studied. For example, the fusion peptide without its C-terminal residues 17–20 was fusogenicity inactive (13Lear J.D. DeGrado W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6500-6505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Replacement of Glu11 with Pro11resulted in a marked decrease in α helical content, concomitant with an almost complete loss of fusogenicity (14Murata M. Takahashi S. Shirai Y. Kagiwada S. Hishida R. Ohnishi S. Biophys. J. 1993; 64: 724-734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Replacing the N-terminal Gly1 with Glu1 eliminated viral fusion activity (15Gething M.J. Doms R.W. York D. White J. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 11-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), but the fusion activity stayed the same with a Gly1→ Ala1 substitution (16Steinhauer D.A. Wharton S.A. Skehel J.J. Wiley D.C. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 6643-6651Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutational studies of the fusion activity for the two Ala residues in the N terminus showed that Ala5 tolerated a smaller (Gly) hydrophobic side chain and that Ala7 tolerated a larger (Val) hydrophobic side chain (17Han X. Steinhauer D.A. Wharton S.A. Tamm L.K. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15052-15059Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). A negatively charged E5 analog was found to possess fusion activity at acidic pH (14Murata M. Takahashi S. Shirai Y. Kagiwada S. Hishida R. Ohnishi S. Biophys. J. 1993; 64: 724-734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 18Murata M. Takahashi S. Kagiwada S. Suzuki A. Ohnishi S. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1986-1992Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), similar to that of the native fusion peptide. In addition to triggering fusion activity, the E5 analog has also been found to promote antisense the entrance of oligonucleotides into the cytosol of mammalian cells upon permeabilization of the plasma membrane (19Pichon C. Freulon I. Midoux P. Mayer R. Monsigny M. Roche A.C. Antisense Nucleic Acid Drug Dev. 1997; 7: 335-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The specific angle of insertion of the peptide into the membrane plane was observed to be an important characteristic for the fusion process for both intact and synthetic fusion peptides (8Luneberg J.

Burny A. Ruysschaert J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1029: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). To date, structural studies of the membrane-bound state of the HA2 fusion peptide and of its analogs have been performed using several biophysical techniques. Upon binding to synthetic liposomes or lipids, the native fusion peptide and its analogs possess higher α-helical contents (18Murata M. Takahashi S. Kagiwada S. Suzuki A. Ohnishi S.

The NMR solution structures of the native fusion peptide with a host-guest system of influenza hemagglutinin (22Han X. Bushweller J.H. Cafiso D.S. Tamm L.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 715-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar) and of the E5 peptide in dodecylphosphocholine (DPC) micelles (23Dubovskii P.V., Li, H. Takahashi S. Arseniev A.S. Akasaka K. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 786-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) have been determined. In the present study, we applied fluorescence, CD, and NMR methods to carry out biophysical studies in SDS micelles for the E5 analog and its two point mutants, G13L and L17A (Table I), both of which possess much less fusion activity than the E5 analog (12Matsumoto T. Biophys. Chem. 1999; 79: 153-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). We then developed a model that describes the structural change of the fusion peptide analog and how the analog interacts with the lipid bilayer at different pH values, on the basis of the determined three-dimensional structures and results from CD and fluorescence experiments. Comparison of our model with the two recently reported models (22Han X. Bushweller J.H. Cafiso D.S. Tamm L.K. Nat. Struct.

These synthetic peptides were cleaved from the resins with trifluoroacetic acid and purified by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography. The sequences of these peptides were ascertained by electrospray mass spectrometry and by amino acid analysis. Deuterated SDS was purchased from Cambridge Isotope (Woburn, MA). Unless otherwise specified, all of the reagents and solvents were obtained commercially of reagent grade and used without further purification. CD experiments were collected using an AVIV CD 202 spectrometer (AVIV, Lakewood, NJ) calibrated with (+)-10-camphorsulfonic acid at 25 °C. In general, a 2-mm path-length cuvette with 50 μm (or 20 μm) fusion peptide analog in 20 mm phosphate was used for CD experiments. The CD spectra of each analog at a molar ratio of 1:100 (peptide/SDS) at different pH values (pH 3.5–9.0) were recorded. Each of the CD data was obtained from an average of three scans with 1-nm bandwidth. The spectra were recorded from 180 to 260 nm at a scanning rate of 38 nm/min with a wavelength step of 0.5 nm and a time constant of 100 ms. After background subtraction and smoothing, all of the CD data were converted from CD signal (millidegree) into mean residue ellipticity (deg cm2 dmol−1). The secondary structure content of each peptide was estimated from the CD spectra according to the method of Sreerama and Woody (24Sreerama N. Woody R.W. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 209: 32-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar). Penetration of fusion peptides into membranes can be determined by monitoring changes in intrinsic fluorescence of aromatic amino-acids (Trp, Tyr, or Phe) contained in the peptide sequence. All of the fluorescence experiments were performed on a Hitachi F-4010 fluorescence spectrofluorometer at ambient temperature. An excitation wavelength of 280 nm was used to record spectra from 290 to 490 nm with a data interval of 1 nm. The response time was set at 2 s with a scan rate of 60 nm·min−1. Excitation and emission slits of 5 and 1.5 nm, respectively, were used for measurements in the presence and absence of SDS micelles. Acrylamide was used for tryptophan fluorescence quenching experiments. An incremental amount of acrylamide stock solution (1m) was added to the peptide (10 μm) solutions to make final concentrations of acrylamide up to 50 mm in the presence of SDS micelles at pH 4.3 and 7.3. The data were analyzed according to the following Stern-Volmer equation (25Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Press, New York1983Crossref Google Scholar). F0/F=1+KSV[Q]Equation 1 Where F 0 and F are the fluorescence intensities in the absence and the presence of quencher [Q], respectively. K SV, calculated as the slope of the Stern-Volmer plot, is the Stern-Volmer quenching constant and is a measure for the accessibility of the tryptophan to acrylamide. NMR measurements were carried out on a Bruker AMX-500 or an AVANCE-600 spectrometer. The samples for the NMR experiments contained about 0.35 ml of 2 mm peptide in SDS micelles (peptide/SDS 1:100) using 20 mm phosphate buffer to adjust pH values (pH 4.0–9.0). pH values were measured with a dissolved oxygen microelectronic pH vision model PHB-9901 pH meter equipped with a 4-mm electrode. All of the reported pH values were direct readings from the pH meter without correction for the isotope effect. To monitor the exchange rates of labile protons, the concentrated sample in H2O was lyophilized only once and redissolved in D2O (99.99% D). The NMR spectra were acquired immediately and thereafter at appropriate time intervals. All of the chemical shifts were externally referenced to the methyl resonance of 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate (0 ppm). Double quantum filtered scalar-correlated spectroscopy (26Rance M.

All spectra were recorded in time-proportioned phase increment mode (29Marion D. Wüthrich K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 113: 967-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (3519) Google Scholar). The titration experiments of the chemical shift versus pH were carried out using one- and two-dimensional NMR experiments at 310 K for E5 and G13L. The titration experiment was not performed for L17A, because of its severe precipitation at neutral pH. Low temperature studies employed a temperature-controlled stream of cooled air using a Bruker BCU refrigeration unit and a B-VT 2000 control unit. Water suppression was achieved by 1.4 s of presaturation at the water frequency or by the gradient method (30Piotto M. Saudek V. Sklenar V. J. Biomol. NMR. 1992; 2: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3506) Google Scholar). All spectra were collected with 6024.1- and 7788.16-Hz spectral widths for AMX-500 and AVANCE-600, respectively. The data were transferred to an SGI O2 work station (200 MHz R5000SC; Silicon Graphics, CA) for the processing and further analysis using Bruker XWINNMR and AURELIA software packages (Karlsruhe, Germany). All data sets acquired were zero-filled to equal points in both dimensions prior to further processing. A 60°-shifted skewed sine bell window function was applied in all NOESY and total correlation spectroscopy spectra, and a 20°- or 30°-shifted skewed sine bell function was used for all correlated spectroscopy spectra. To help resolve spectral overlap, the data were collected at different temperatures. Distance restraints of fusion peptide analogs were derived primarily from the 200-ms NOESY spectrum recorded in SDS micelles at 310 K, pH 4.0. Comparison was made to the 100-ms NOESY spectrum to assess possible contributions from spin diffusion. Peak intensities were classified as large, medium, small, and very small, corresponding to the upper bound interproton distance restraints of 2.5, 3.5, 4.5, and 6.0 Å, respectively. An additional correction of 1.0 Å was added for methylene and methyl groups. Backbone dihedral restraints were inferred from3JNH coupling constants, with φ restrained to −120 ± 30° for 3JNHα > 8Hz and −60 ± 30° on 3JNHα < 6Hz. Three-dimensional structures were generated using a simulated annealing and energy minimization protocol in the program X-PLOR 98 (31Brunger A.T. X-PLOR. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1998Google Scholar). Hydrogen bond restraints were included only in the final stage of refinement, and all of the peptide bonds were defined astrans. Average structures were calculated using the final set of refined structures and were further energy minimized to ensure correct local geometry. The INSIGHT II (Molecular Simulation Inc., San Diego, CA), MOLMOL (32Koradi R. Billeter M. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 29-32Crossref Scopus (6474) Google Scholar), and GRASP (33Nicholls A. Sharp K.A. Honig B. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1991; 11: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (5314) Google Scholar) software programs were used to visualize sets of structures and to calculate and draw the electrostatic surface potential of the final three-dimensional models. The convergence of the calculated structures was evaluated in terms of the structural parameters, that is, the root mean square deviation from the experimental distance and dihedral constraints, the values of the energy statistics (F noe,F tor, and F repel), and the root mean square deviation from the idealized geometry. The distributions of the backbone dihedral angles of the final converged structures were evaluated by the representation of the Ramachandran dihedral pattern, indicating the deviations from the sterically allowed (φ and ψ) angle limits using PROCHECK-NMR (34Laskowski R.A. Rullmannn J.A. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (4354) Google Scholar). CD spectroscopy was used to determine whether the peptides undergo a conformational change upon interaction with lipid micelles at different pH values. The CD spectra of three analogs at various pH values in SDS micelles all showed that the conformations of the analogs are pH-dependent (Fig. 1). The observations of 208- and 222-nm negative ellipticities and of isodichroic point at 203, 203, and 204 nm for E5, G13L, and L17A, respectively, revealed that a random coil and an α-helix are in equilibrium in these analogs. Based on the standard values of the mean residue molar ellipticity at 222 nm, 4000 deg cm2dmol−1 for the random coil and −38000 deg cm2dmol−1 for the α-helix (35Creighton T.E. Proteins. Freeman, New York1993: 190-191Google Scholar), we estimated the following α-helical content for each analog at pH 7.0 and 3.5, respectively: 48 and 72% for G13L; 43 and 62% for E5; and 24 and 43% for L17A. Clearly, G13L exhibits the highest content of α-helical structures, whereas L17A contains fewest α-helical structures at both neutral and fusogenic pH. At pH > 6.0, the negative ellipticity shifted to the value of ∼200 nm in L17A, indicating that L17A is mostly unstructured under this condition. Interestingly, the helical content of L17A at acidic pH is nearly the same as that of E5 at neutral pH. All three analogs contain a Trp residue at position 14. To verify the interaction of the fusion peptide analogs and the SDS micelles, the steady-state fluorescence emission spectra of these three analogs were measured. It is suggested that the observation of a blue shift upon interaction of the peptides with the negatively charged vesicles indicates that the tryptophan moiety has penetrated into the vesicle bilayer. As shown in Fig. 2 A, the E5 peptide at neutral pH without SDS micelles exhibited a emission maximum at 352 nm and reached a maximum of 336 nm in the presence of SDS micelles. This observation of a blue shift verifies the transfer of tryptophan to a more hydrophobic environment and verifies that there is an interaction between the E5 analog and micelles. At acidic pH, a further blue shift was observed, indicating a deeper insertion of tryptophan into lipid bilayers. Interestingly, G13L possesses characteristics in its fluorescence data very similar to those of the E5 peptide (Fig.2 B). The fluorescence spectra of L17A shown in Fig.2 C, however, revealed a different characteristic. The emission maximum of L17A remained at ∼352 nm in aqueous solution with or without micelles at neutral pH, revealing that at neutral pH it hardly interacts with micelles. At acidic pH the emission maximum shifted to 336 nm, the same as the maximum of E5 at neutral pH. The result of fluorescence emission experiments seems to indicate that the structure of E5 at neutral pH is quite similar to that of L17A at acidic pH. To further verify that tryptophan inserts deeper into lipid bilayers at acidic pH, we carried out acrylamide fluorescence quenching experiments. Fig. 3 A shows the Stern-Volmer plot for E5, G13L, and L17A peptides in SDS micelles at pH 4.3 and 7.3. A comparison of the Stern-Volmer quenching constants (m−1) among these peptides is shown in Fig.3 B. The three analogs at acidic pH all possess a smallerK SV value compared with that at neutral pH, indicating that the Trp residue inserts deeper into lipid bilayers at acidic pH. In addition, the K SV value of E5 peptide at neutral pH is nearly identical to that of L17A at acidic pH, in good agreement with the finding that the emission maximum of E5 at neutral pH is the same as that of L17A at acidic pH.Figure 3Trp fluorescence quenching experiments of HA2 fusion peptide analogs by acrylamide in the presence of SDS micelles are shown.

The total correlation spectroscopy and double quantum filtered scalar-correlated spectroscopy spectra were used to assign the spin systems, and the NOESY spectra were used to make sequential connections between spin systems. In addition, the NMR experiments obtained at different temperatures (285, 295, and 310 K) at both neutral and fusogenic pH values were used to assign the overlapping peaks. Fig.4 shows the representative regions of the NOESY spectra involving the backbone protons for E5, G13L, and L17A at pH 4.0, respectively. In general, the observations of weakerd αN(i, i+1) and strongerd αN(i, i) andd NN(i, i+1) connectivities, together withd αN(i, i+3),d αN(i, i+4), andd αβ(i, i+3) NOEs, suggest a stabilization of the α-helical structure. We observed a set of α-helical NOEs in the N-terminal segment of Ile2–Glu11 for all three analogs at acidic pH. In the C-terminal region, the absence of d αN(10Bullough P.A. Hughson F.M. Skehel J.J.

Herstatin binds to human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 and to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), blocking receptor oligomerization and tyrosine phosphorylation. In this study, we characterized several early steps in EGFR activation and investigated downstream signaling events induced by epidermal growth factor (EGF) and by transforming growth factor α (TGF-α) in NIH3T3 cell lines expressing EGFR with and without herstatin. Herstatin expression decreased EGF-induced EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation and delayed receptor down-regulation despite receptor occupancy by ligand with normal binding affinity. Akt stimulation by EGF and TGF-α, but not by fibroblast growth factor 2, was almost completely blocked in the presence of herstatin. Surprisingly, EGF and TGF-α induced full activation of MAPK in duration and intensity and stimulated association of the EGFR with Shc and Grb2. Although MAPK was fully stimulated, herstatin expression prevented TGF-α-induced DNA synthesis and EGF-induced proliferation. The herstatin-mediated uncoupling of MAPK from Akt activation was also observed in Chinese hamster ovary cells co-transfected with EGFR and herstatin. These findings show that herstatin expression alters EGF and TGF-α signaling profiles, culminating in inhibition of proliferation.

A. 1999; 96: 10869-10874Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). One of these, herstatin, is a secreted alternative product of the HER-2 gene containing ECD subdomains I and II followed by an intron-encoded 79-amino acid sequence (32Doherty J.K. Bond C. Jardim A. Adelman J.P. Clinton G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10869-10874Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Herstatin has been shown to bind to EGFR and HER-2 and to block homomeric and heteromeric receptor interactions (29Azios N.G. Romero F.J. Denton M.C. Doherty J.K. Clinton G.M. Oncogene. 2001; 20 (J.): 5199-5209LCrossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 32Doherty J.K. Bond C. Jardim A. Adelman J.P. Clinton G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10869-10874Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In contrast to dominant negative mutants, herstatin does not require a membrane anchor to achieve complex formation and trans inhibition, suggesting that its novel C-terminal domain may confer high affinity binding to the receptors. Indeed, the intron-encoded domain, expressed as a recombinant peptide, binds to HER-2 and the EGFR (29Azios N.G. Romero F.J. Denton M.C. Doherty J.K. Clinton G.M. Oncogene. 2001; 20 (J.): 5199-5209LCrossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 32Doherty J.K. Bond C. Jardim A. Adelman J.P. Clinton G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10869-10874Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Although herstatin inhibits the initial steps of receptor activation, its impact on ligand binding and intracellular signaling events has not been examined. In light of the novel structure and receptor binding properties of herstatin, determination of its effects on signaling is required to understand its mechanism of action and impact on the biology of the ErbB receptors.In this study, we demonstrate that herstatin selectively modulates signaling cascades triggered by EGF and TGF-α. These results suggest that this naturally occurring, alternative HER-2 product provides a novel mechanism for generating signaling diversity by EGFs.DISCUSSIONInvestigating the mechanisms employed by ErbB inhibitors and their impact on signaling is critical to understanding the biology of these receptors and to developing anti-receptor tyrosine kinase therapeutics. Whereas several inhibitors of the EGFR have been investigated, herstatin is distinguished by its novel structure, consisting of subdomains I and II of the HER-2 ECD and an intron encoded-C-terminal domain (32Doherty J.K. Bond C. Jardim A. Adelman J.P. Clinton G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10869-10874Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Furthermore, herstatin is the only naturally occurring inhibitor of the EGFR in mammalian cells that exerts its action on the initial events in receptor activation: dimerization and autophosphorylation (29Azios N.G. Romero F.J. Denton M.C. Doherty J.K. Clinton G.M. Oncogene. 2001; 20 (J.): 5199-5209LCrossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 32Doherty J.K. Bond C. Jardim A. Adelman J.P. Clinton G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10869-10874Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In this study, we show that herstatin selectively modulates the intracellular signaling pathways stimulated by EGFR ligands. EGF binds to its receptor with normal affinity in the presence of herstatin, yet receptor tyrosine phosphorylation and down-regulation are suppressed. Whereas herstatin allows full ligand stimulation of the MAPK pathway and its upstream effector, Shc, Akt phosphorylation is selectively blocked, resulting in suppression of cell growth.Herstatin is a secreted protein that binds to and inhibits the EGFR (29Azios N.G. Romero F.J. Denton M.C. Doherty J.K. Clinton G.M. Oncogene. 2001; 20 (J.): 5199-5209LCrossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Although the binding site has not been mapped, previous observations suggest that herstatin associates with the ECD of ErbB receptors (32Doherty J.K. Bond C. Jardim A. Adelman J.P. Clinton G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10869-10874Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). We therefore examined whether herstatin may interfere with binding of EGF. Our results demonstrate that neither the binding affinity nor the overall number of EGF binding sites was significantly altered in cells that expressed either low or very high levels of herstatin. Therefore, herstatin appears to inhibit EGFR that is occupied by growth factor. Two other classes of EGFR inhibitors compete with ligand binding, including the Drosophila ligand Argos (46Vinos J. Freeman M. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3560-3562Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 47Zhao D. Bownes M. Dev. Genet. 1999; 25: 375-386Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the EGFR monoclonal antibody C225 (48Mendelsohn J. Clin. Cancer Res. 1997; 3: 2703-2707PubMed Google Scholar). Because herstatin inhibits ligand-occupied receptor, it may be effective even when growth factors are overproduced by tumors (49Klapper L.N. Kirschbaum M.H. Sela M. Yarden Y. Adv. Cancer Res. 2000; 77: 25-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar).In this study, we demonstrate that herstatin uncouples intracellular signaling pathways triggered by EGF and TGF-α. Whereas EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation and Akt activation are inhibited, Shc and MAPK are fully activated. This is in contrast to the intracellular signaling effects of several other inhibitors of EGFR including the quinazoline inhibitors (12Busse D. Doughty R.S. Ramsey T.T. Russell W.E. Price J.O.

Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1913-1922Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), which suppress EGF-induced phosphorylation of both MAPK and Akt. Similar to herstatin, these inhibitors reduce EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation and cause prolonged retention of the EGFR at the cell surface.In agreement with previous studies (43Wennstrom S. Downward J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4279-4288Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), we also observed uncoupling of MAPK and Akt signaling cascades at very low concentrations of EGF (0.01 nm), suggesting that either limiting amounts of ligand or the presence of herstatin preferentially stimulated the MAPK cascade. The signaling effects of herstatin can not be explained by a reduction in the effective concentration of growth factor; the EGF binding affinity was unaffected by herstatin, and selective suppression of Akt signaling was observed at both subsaturating (0.1 nm) and very high ligand concentrations (100 nm).Because phosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues on activated receptors is responsible for the recruitment and activation of distinct intracellular signaling molecules (51Alroy I. Yarden Y. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar), inhibition of some, but not all, EGFR phosphorylation sites by herstatin may cause preferential recruitment of effector molecules (52Sweeney C. Carraway III., K.L. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5568-5573Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Evaluation of this possibility will require phosphopeptide mapping of the EGFR from the herstatin-expressing cells. However, even in the absence of EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation, either by kinase-impaired EGFR (39Campos-Gonzalez R. Glenney J.R., Jr. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14535-14538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Hack N. Sue A.Q.A. Mills G.B. Skorecki K.L. J. Biol.

Takenawa T. Yazaki Y. Shibuya M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 167-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), MAPK is activated, whereas Akt is not stimulated by EGF (16Walker F.

Growth Factors. 1998; 16: 53-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), as well as with herstatin, EGFR appears to be involved in activation of the MAPK cascade, as shown by its presence in a signaling complex containing tyrosine phosphorylated Shc and Grb2. An endogenous receptor tyrosine kinase or a cytoplasmic kinase such as src (56Olayioye M.A. Badache A. Daly J.M. Hynes N.E. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 267: 81-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) may also participate in MAPK activation by EGF. Endogenous HER-2, the preferred EGFR heteromeric partner, is unlikely to be responsible for MAPK activation because herstatin effectively disrupts HER-2 homomeric and heteromeric interactions (29Azios N.G. Romero F.J. Denton M.C. Doherty J.K. Clinton G.M. Oncogene. 2001; 20 (J.): 5199-5209LCrossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Although we were unable to detect HER-2 in the EGF-induced signaling complex, other endogenous tyrosine kinases may be involved in MAPK activation in herstatin-expressing cells.A major question in signaling through receptor tyrosine kinases concerns the mechanism by which growth factors can stimulate diverse cellular responses (52Sweeney C. Carraway III., K.L. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5568-5573Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 57Carraway III, K.L. Cantley L.C.

For the ErbB receptors, one level of diversity is achieved through generation of different ErbB dimer pairs that have been found to differentially stimulate intracellular signaling pathways (10Olayioye M.A. Neve R.M. Lane H.A. Hynes N.E. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3159-3167Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 51Alroy I. Yarden Y. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar, 52Sweeney C.

Cell. 1994; 78: 5-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). Alternatively, signaling by the same dimer pair may be altered in response to activation by different growth factors (8Riese D.J., II Stern D.F. Bioessays. 1998; 20: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar, 22Tzahar E. Pinkas-Kramarski R. Moyer J.D. Klapper L.N. Alroy I. Levkowitz G. Shelly M. Henis S. Eisenstein M. Ratzkin B.J.

Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5568-5573Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Additionally, EGF ligands have been shown to promote diverse cellular responses, depending on the cell type (59Yarden Y. Sliwkowski M.X. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (5538) Google Scholar). The results presented here point to a novel mechanism of generating diversity by which a single ligand, EGF, can achieve altered signal output within a given cell context. Our studies suggest that herstatin, a HER-2 receptor variant expressed in fetal kidney and liver cells, can selectively alter EGF signal output, resulting in growth arrest.The Ras/MAPK pathway was previously suggested to be the major mitogenic signaling pathway initiated by the EGFR (60Malumbres M. Pellicer A. Front. Biosci. 1998; 3: 887-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In the presence of herstatin, full stimulation of MAPK by TGF-α was insufficient to drive entry into S phase, as suggested by the suppression of DNA synthesis. Moreover, EGF stimulation of MAPK was insufficient to stimulate cell proliferation in the presence of herstatin. Because Akt activation was strongly inhibited, components of the PI3K signaling pathway that are required for growth factor-induced proliferation may not be activated in the presence of herstatin. This finding is in agreement with recent observations that interruption of the MAPK pathway by EGFR blockade with quinazoline inhibitors is not the cause of G1 arrest, but rather interruption of PI3K function is required (12Busse D. Doughty R.S. Ramsey T.T. Russell W.E. Price J.O. Flanagan W.M. Shawver L.K. Arteaga C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6987-6995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar).Signaling through the EGF receptor is often enhanced in human cancers through overexpression of the receptor and autocrine stimulation by ligands produced by the tumor (49Klapper L.N. Kirschbaum M.H. Sela M. Yarden Y. Adv. Cancer Res. 2000; 77: 25-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). Enhanced EGFR signaling in several carcinomas is directly coupled to inappropriate phospho-Akt survival signals, rendering many cancers resistant to apoptotic signals, including those activated by radiation and chemotherapies (12Busse D. Doughty R.S. Ramsey T.T. Russell W.E. Price J.O. Flanagan W.M. Shawver L.K. Arteaga C.L. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 17612-17618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). EGF stimulation of Akt kinase activity has been proposed as a major mechanism behind enhanced survival conferred by inappropriate EGF signaling. The activation of Akt appears to be both required and sufficient for the antiapoptotic function of EGF (19Gibson S., Tu, S. Oyer R. Anderson S.M. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17612-17618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Results presented here point to the effectiveness of herstatin in blockage of Akt activation and inhibition of proliferation stimulated by EGF. Previous studies also demonstrate the effectiveness of herstatin in blocking proliferation stimulated by HER-2 overexpression, which often occurs in the same tumor cells that have enhanced EGFR signaling. The results presented here further support the potential utility of herstatin in the development of therapeutics against cancers with ErbB receptor involvement. The ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases includes the prototypical EGFR, 1The abbreviations used are: EGFRepidermal growth factor receptorEGFepidermal growth factorTGF-αtransforming growth factor αMAPKmitogen-activated protein kinaseHERhuman epidermal growth factor receptorECDextracellular ligand binding domainPI3Kphosphatidylinositol 3-kinaseDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumFBSfetal bovine seru"

Recent evidence indicates that small G proteins (guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory proteins) control signaling pathways critical for such diverse cellular functions by activating multiple effector molecules. Bone metabolism in health and disease is based on a self-regulating cellular event. Osteoblasts play a central role in bone formation by synthesizing multiple bone matrix proteins and differentiating into bone cells and also regulate osteoclast maturation by producing bone-resorbing cytokines and by direct cell attachment, resulting in bone resorption (1Manolagas S.C.

Such diverse functions of osteoblasts are induced or regulated by multiple soluble factors including growth factors, hormones, and prostaglandins. Recent findings imply that many critical factors such as estrogen, parathyroid hormone, glucocorticoid, prostaglandins, tumor necrosis factor-α, and chemokines control osteoblast functions by binding to their cognate G-protein-coupled receptors and/or subsequent small G-proteins-mediated signaling (5Schwindinger W.F.

Among several small G-proteins, Ras has been characterized as a central molecule for the regulation of signal transduction pathways in various types of cells (10Marshall C.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar, 11Mercer J.A. Semin. Cell. Dev. Biol. 2000; 11: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 12Knall C. Johnson G.L. J.

Kataoka T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3117-3123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that Ras proteins both physically and functionally couple with multiple effectors including Raf-1/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK),1 Ral guanine nucleotide dissociation stimulator, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), protein tyrosine kinases, and small GTPases. Namely, Ras proteins are molecular switches similar to a “hub,” which radiates multiple signaling pathways critical for diverse cellular functions. This is a dynamic phenomenon involving an array of protein-protein interactions modulated by chemical modifications, structural rearrangements, and intracellular relocalizations. Thus, Ras proteins are activated by multiple extracellular stimuli and are involved in regulatory biological processes from the outside of the cell to its interior through a complex array of downstream effectors, thereby controlling a variety of cellular responses such as proliferation, apoptosis, adhesion, and cytokine/matrix production. However, the relevance of Ras to signaling and functions in osteoblasts remains unclear. We have previously reported that H-Ras plays a pivotal role in integrin-mediated adhesion and proliferation of lymphocytes (15Tanaka Y. Minami Y. Mine S. Hirano H. Fujimoto H. Fujii K. Saito K.

Here we have studied the relevance of H-Ras and its downstream effectors to functions of osteoblasts by shedding light upon the difference of Raf-1/MAPK and PI3K. The current report demonstrates that H-Ras/Raf-1/MAPK pathways might be involved in down-regulation of integrins and integrin-mediated adhesion to matrix proteins as well as induction of apoptosis presumably via Fas/Bcl-2 systems in human-purified osteoblasts. Osteoblast-like cells were purified from metaphyseal trabecular bone in the proximal femur of five osteoarthritis patients during total hip arthroplasty by the established procedures of Russell and colleagues (17Baresford J.N.

After removing pieces of cortical bone, articular cartilage, and soft connective tissue, the fragments were cut into small pieces and washed extensively. The bone explants were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (GIBCO, Grand Island, NY) containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) (GIBCO) in 25-cm2 culture flasks (Falcon, Lincoln Park, NJ) at a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. When cell monolayers were confluent after the 6–8-week culture, the explants were removed and the cells were replated and incubated, which resulted in new cellular outgrowth and eventually a confluent monolayer of cells. At confluence, the cells were trypsinized, passaged at a 1:3 split ratio, and recultured. The medium was changed twice each week, and the cells were used after 3–7 passages. The obtained cells showed a flattened polygonal shape with multiple spindlelegs and possessed characteristics of osteoblast-like phenotype including osteocalcin (OC), bone sialoprotein, type I collagen (COLL-I), and bone alkaline phosphatase (ALP) as described previously (18Tanaka Y.

The obtained oligonucleotides, a human active form of H-Ras expression plasmid pEF-BOS-HA-RasV12, a human Raf-1-binding/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) subfamily of MAPK-activating form of H-Ras expression plasmid pEF-BOS-HA-RasV12T35S, a human Raf-1-non-binding form of H-Ras expression plasmid pEF-BOS-HA-RasV12E37G, a human PI3K-binding/activating form of H-Ras expression plasmid pEF-BOS-HA-RasV12Y40C, and a human active form of Raf-1 expression plasmid pEF-BOS-HA-Raf-1 were introduced into osteoblasts using a cationic liposome-mediated transfection method (21Tamada M., Hu, C.

Oligonucleotides and plasmids were mixed with 5 μl of Lipofectin reagent (LipofectAMINE 2000, Invitrogen) and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. The oligonucleotide and liposome complex was added to osteoblasts plated in a 6-well culture dish (3 × 105cells/well, Falcon) and incubated in a 10% FCS containing DMEM for 24–72 h. The concentration of oligonucleotides in the conditioned medium was 2.2 μm, and the expression of each H-Ras was confirmed by staining with anti-HA Ab using flow cytometer. The transfection efficiency of pEF-BOS-HA-RasV12 into osteoblasts was 50–80% detected by anti-HA Ab and differed among donors. Marked difference of the transfection efficiency among all of the used mutants of H-Ras was not observed in COS cells (data not shown). Staining and flow cytometric analyses of osteoblasts with or without transfection of several plasmid as mentioned above were performed using a FACScan (BD PharMingen) and standard procedures as described previously (26Tanaka Y. Wake A. Horgan K.J. Murakami S. Aso M. Saito K. Oda S. Morimoto I. Uno H. Kikuchi H. Izumi Y. Eto S. J.

The cytoplasmic antigens of osteoblasts, which were pretreated with cell permeabilization kit (Caltag, Burlingame, CA), were stained by anti-Bcl-2 mAb, anti-OC mAb, anti-ALP mAb, or anti-IL-6 mAb in FACS medium for 30 min at 4 °C. After washing the cells three times with FACS medium, they were further incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG Ab, goat anti-rabbit IgG Ab, or rabbit anti-goat IgG Ab for 30 min at 4 °C. The staining of cells with mAbs was detected using FACScan. The quantification of cell surface antigens on single cells was calculated using standard beads QIFKIT (DAKO Japan, Kyoto, Japan) as already described (15Tanaka Y. Minami Y. Mine S. Hirano H.

The data were used for the construction of the calibration curve (mean fluorescence intensity) against antibody-binding capacity (ABC). The cell specimen was analyzed on the FACScan and ABC calculated by interpolation on the calibration curve. When green fluorescence laser detector was set at 450 level in the FACScan used, ABC = 414.45 × exponential (0.0092 × mean fluorescence intensity) (R2 = 0.9999). Subsequently, specific antibody-binding capacity was obtained after corrections for background, an apparent ABC of the negative control mAb thy-1.2. Specific antibody-binding capacity corresponds to the mean number of accessible antigenic sites per cell referred to as antigen density and expressed in sites per cell. Adhesion assay of osteoblasts to extracellular matrix glycoproteins was performed as described previously (15Tanaka Y. Minami Y. Mine S. Hirano H. Fujimoto H. Fujii K. Saito K.

After washing by phosphate-buffered saline three times, nonspecific proteins were blocked by 2% human serum albumin for 2 h at 37 °C. The plates were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline before the addition of osteoblasts. 2 × 105 osteoblasts were labeled with 51Cr (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in DMEM with 1% human serum albumin and were added to the plates in the absence or presence of adhesion-blocking anti-β1 mAb Lia1/2 (10 μg/ml). After a settling phase of 30 min at 4 °C, the plates were rapidly warmed to 37 °C for 30 min and then gently washed twice with DMEM at room temperature to completely remove non-adherent monocytes. The contents of each well containing adherent osteoblasts were lysed with 250 μl of 1% Triton X-100 (Sigma), and the emission of the contents of each well was measured using a γ-counter. Osteoblasts (1 × 104) were seeded and incubated on 96-well flat-bottomed microfilter plates (Costar) in DMEM and 10% FCS for 24–72 h at 37 °C. After cells were stained with TetraColor One kit including tetrazolium and electron carrier mixture (Seikagaku, Tokyo, Japan) for 1 h at 37 °C, the optical density value of each well was measured by a enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate reader at 450 nm. The quantitation of early apoptotic osteoblasts by the annexin-V and propidium iodide (PI) (Kamiya Biomedical, Seattle, WA) on osteoblasts, which were precultured for 24 h at 4 °C, were conducted by dual-color flow cytometry. After the cells were treated with RNase A (2 ng/ml, Sigma) for 15 min at 37 °C, PI and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated annexin-V were added to the cells and incubated for 2 min. The staining of cells was detected using FACScan. The quantitation of apoptotic cells by the TUNEL technique using ApopTag Direct (Intergen, Purchase, NY) and PI on cultured synovial cell subpopulations was conducted by dual-color flow cytometry. After the cells were fixed with 200 μl of 1% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at 4 °C and washed twice, the cells were resuspended in 70% ethanol and were kept at −20 °C. After washing twice, the cells were resuspended in 75 μl of equilibration buffer, were washed again, were resuspended in 25 μl of working strength Tdt enzyme, and were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. After adding 250 μl of working strength stop/wash buffer, the cells were washed and resuspended in 250 μl of working strength stop/wash buffer, and 50 μg/ml of PI was added to the cells. The obtained cells were assessed using FACScan. Initially, we assessed the ability of H-Ras and its mutants to regulate integrins on osteoblasts when expressed ectopically in the cells. Purified human osteoblastic cells (osteoblasts) spontaneously and highly expressed an integrin β1 as recognized by anti-conventional β1 (CD29) mAb MAB13 (Fig.1). However, the expression of β1 was decreased on osteoblasts expressing H-RasV12 but not on those expressing mock plasmid. β1 requires an active configuration to bind to its ligand, a process that can be induced by a variety of stimuli, and can be assessed by HUTS-21 mAb, which reacts with a ligand-induced binding site located on the β1 (20Gomez M. Luque A. del Pozo M. Hogg N. Sanchez M.F. Cabanas C. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 8-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Osteoblasts spontaneously expressed the ligand binding sites of β1 as recognized by HUTS-21 mAb, whereas osteoblasts bearing H-RasV12 but not mock plasmid expressed significantly lesser amounts of the sites on the cell surface. The expression of α subunits was also screened on osteoblasts. Osteoblasts expressed α3 (CD49c), a receptor for LM; α4 (CD49d), a receptor for FN and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1; α5 (CD49e), a receptor for FN; and α6 (CD49f), a receptor for LM. The expression of α4, α5, and α6 but not α3 was reduced on osteoblasts expressing H-RasV12, whereas these α chains on osteoblasts expressing mock plasmid was comparable with α chains on control osteoblasts. Because H-Ras exhibits its actions through binding to a set of effector proteins involved in Ras/Raf-1/MAPK and Ras/PI3K pathways (10Marshall C.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar, 11Mercer J.A. Semin. Cell. Dev. Biol. 2000; 11: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 12Knall C. Johnson G.L. J.

Kataoka T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3117-3123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), it important to determine which Ras effector is required to induce β1. It is noteworthy that osteoblasts expressing H-RasV12T35S mutant, which selectively binds to Raf-1 and activates Raf-1, reduce the expression of not only β1 but also an activated form of β1 (Fig.2). In contrast, the expression of both β1 and an activated form of β1 on the cells expressing a H-RasV12Y40C mutant that selectively binds to PI3K and a H-RasV12E37G mutant that does not bind to Raf-1 was comparable with their spontaneous expression on osteoblasts expressing a mock plasmid. Furthermore, osteoblasts expressing an active Raf-1 reduced the expression of β1 and an activated form of β1. These results imply that H-Ras signals, especially those mediated by Raf-1/ERK pathway, reduce the expression of β1 and an activated form of β1 on osteoblasts. We next assessed the ability of H-Ras and its mutants to regulate adhesion of osteoblasts to matrix proteins when expressed ectopically in the cells. Purified human osteoblasts spontaneously adhered to FN, LM, VN, and COLL-I (Fig.3). mAb-blocking studies indicated that osteoblast adhesion to FN, LM, and VN was integrin β1-dependent, whereas the adhesion to COLL-I was β1-independent. However, the adhesion of osteoblasts, transfected with the expression vector encoding H-RasV12T35S mutant, to FN, LM, and VN, but not COLL-I was markedly reduced to the levels that β1-mAb blocking studies showed. In contrast, the adhesion of the cells expressing H-RasV12Y40C was comparable with spontaneous adhesion of osteoblasts. These results imply that H-Ras signals, especially those mediated by Raf-1/ERK pathway, reduces β1-mediated adhesion of osteoblasts to matrix proteins such as FN, LM, and VN. The expression of intracellular ALP, OC, and IL-6 in osteoblasts was assessed. To this end, osteoblasts expressing H-RasV12, H-RasV12Y40C, or H-RasV12T35S were fixed by formaldehyde and permeabilized by saponin and subsequent staining, and flow cytometric analyses of the cells were performed with the indicated mAbs using FACScan. Control osteoblasts and osteoblasts transfected with the expression vectors encoding H-RasV12, H-RasV12Y40C, or H-RasV12T35S, respectively, exhibited similar levels of intracellular ALP, OC, and IL-6 (Fig.4). The secretion of IL-6 from osteoblasts expressing H-RasV12, H-RasV12Y40C, or H-RasV12T35S did not change (data not shown). These results suggest that not only the differentiation of osteoblasts but also the production of one bone-resorbing cytokine IL-6 is not affected by the expression of H-Ras or its mutants. The proliferation assay of control osteoblasts or osteoblasts transfected with the expression vectors encoding H-RasV12, H-RasV12Y40C, H-RasV12T35S, H-RasV12E37G, or active Raf-1 was performed next using TetraColor One including tetrazolium and electron carrier mixture for evaluating cell proliferation. Osteoblasts proliferated well at least up to 72 h (Fig. 5). However, the proliferation rate of osteoblasts transfected with H-RasV12was markedly reduced, and the proliferation rate of osteoblasts expressing H-RasV12T35S mutant was completely inhibited. The proliferation of osteoblasts expressing an active Raf-1 was also decreased within 24 h. The cell counts of osteoblasts expressing H-RasV12 and H-RasV12T35S were also down-regulated at 24 and 72 h compared with control osteoblasts (data not shown). In contrast, the proliferation of osteoblasts expressing H-RasV12Y40C or H-RasV12E37G was comparable with spontaneous proliferation of osteoblasts. These results imply that H-Ras signals, especially those followed by a Raf-1/ERK pathway, reduce the proliferation of osteoblasts. Fas is known to be involved in apoptosis, whereas Bcl-2 is essential to proliferative responses (28Reed J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (2389) Google Scholar). These molecules on osteoblasts expressing H-RasV12, H-RasV12Y40C, H-RasV12T35S, or active Raf-1 were observed with anti-Fas mAb DX2 or anti-Bcl-2 mAb Bcl-2/100 using FACScan. Control osteoblasts expressed both cell surface Fas and intracellular Bcl-2 (Fig.6). Of note, the expression of H-RasV12, H-RasV12T35S, or an active Raf-1 further augmented Fas expression on osteoblasts, whereas it completely inhibited intracellular Bcl-2. In contrast, the expression of H-RasV12Y40C did not change Fas and Bcl-2 levels in osteoblasts. Taken together, our observation of increased expression of Fas and reduced expression of Bcl-2 in osteoblasts expressing H-RasV12, H-RasV12T35S, or an active Raf-1 suggests that the cells might be apoptotic at least partially mediated by Fas. Accordingly, we assessed apoptotic features of control osteoblasts and osteoblasts expressing H-RasV12T35S. Annexin-V/PI-staining indicates that the majority of control osteoblasts were annexin-Vlow/PIlow by Dot-blot analysis using flow cytometer, whereas most of the osteoblasts expressing H-RasV12T35S were annexin-Vhigh/PIlow or annexin-Vhigh/PIhigh, namely early apoptotic after 24 h incubation (Fig. 7). The percentage of annexin-Vhigh/PIlow osteoblasts expressing an active Raf-1 was also significantly increased within 24 h (Table I). Furthermore, PI/TUNEL staining of the osteoblasts indicates that half of the osteoblasts expressing H-RasV12 and most of the osteoblasts expressing H-RasV12T35S were TUNELhigh/PIlow by Dot-blot analysis using ApopTag Direct kit and subsequent flow cytometer after 72-h incubation, whereas all of the control osteoblasts cells were TUNELlow (Fig. 8). These results imply that H-Ras signals, especially those followed by Raf-1/ERK pathway, reduce proliferation and induce apoptosis of osteoblasts.Table IEarly apoptosis of osteoblasts expressing H-RasV12T35SOsteoblastsAnnexin-Vhigh/PIlow cells%Without transfection15.7 ± 5.4With H-RasV1233.4 ± 8.2**With H-RasV12T35S41.2 ± 4.6**With active Raf-145.8 ± 16.2** Open table in a new tab FIG. 8Apoptosis of osteoblasts expressing H-RasV12T35S. The quantitation of apoptotic cells by the TUNEL and PI on control osteoblasts (A), osteoblasts expressing H-RasV12 (B), or H-RasV12T35S (C), which were cultured for 72 h, were conducted by dual-color flow cytometry.

The solid linerepresents the gate set to discriminate negative from positive stained cells as determined by control thy1.2 mAb.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The main findings obtained in this study are as follows. 1) Osteoblasts adhere to matrix protein such as FN, LM, and VN in a β1 integrin-dependent manner. However, the osteoblasts transfected with the expression vector encoding fully activated H-RasV12 mutant or H-RasV12T35S, which selectively binds to Raf-1 and activates Raf-1/MAPK, failed to adhere to them, whereas the expression of H-RasV12Y40C mutant, which selectively binds to PI3K, or H-RasV12E37G mutant, which does not bind to Raf-1, did not affect the adhesion. 2) The expression levels of cell surface β1, α4, α5, and α6 and of ligand-binding activation epitope of β1 were decreased on osteoblasts expressing H-RasV12, H-RasV12T35S, or an active Raf-1. 3) The expression of any of the H-Ras mutants did not affect on the intracellular expression of ALP, OC, and IL-6 in osteoblasts. 4) The osteoblasts expressing H-RasV12, H-RasV12T35S, or active Raf-1 failed to proliferate, whereas control osteoblasts and osteoblasts expressing H-RasV12Y40C or H-RasV12E37G proliferated well. 5) The up-regulation of Fas and down-regulation of Bcl-2 were observed in osteoblasts expressing H-RasV12 or H-RasV12T35S compared with control cells. 6) The osteoblasts expressing H-RasV12, H-RasV12T35S, or active Raf-1 were apoptotic, because most of them were annexin-Vhigh/PIhigh to low after 24-h incubation and TUNELhigh/PIlow after 72-h incubation. Thus, we propose that H-Ras signals, especially those followed by Raf-1/MAPK pathway but not by PI-3K, not only reduces β1-mediated adhesion of osteoblasts to matrix proteins but induces apoptosis via the Fas up-regulation and Bcl-2 down-regulation. Regeneration is a process common in keeping homeostasis of several tissues and is also essential to bone metabolism designated bone remodeling. During bone remodeling cycle, osteoblasts play a central role not only in bone formation by synthesizing multiple bone matrix proteins but also in bone resorption by regulating osteoclast maturation and activation (1Manolagas S.C.

Integrins are a superfamily of cell surface receptors involved in cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion. Functional osteoblasts, which adhere to matrix via integrins in the “formation” phase, are achieved by combining the ability to create mechanically functional adhesion to matrices or opposing cells and signal-transducing capabilities. Signals from matrices transduced by integrins play critical roles in regulating gene expression, tissue-specific differentiation, and survival of primary osteoblasts and fibroblasts (2Rodan G.A. J.

Bone (NY). 1999; 25: 95-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Such functions of osteoblasts during the remodeling cycle are determined by hormones, cytokines, prostaglandins, and growth factors, most of which transduce signals by binding to their cognate G-protein-coupled receptors and/or subsequent small G-proteins-mediated signaling (5Schwindinger W.F.

Among several small G-proteins, Ras has been characterized as a central molecule for the regulation of signal transduction pathways in various types of cells (10Marshall C.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar, 11Mercer J.A. Semin. Cell. Dev. Biol. 2000; 11: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 12Knall C. Johnson G.L. J.

We here observed that H-Ras signals, especially those followed by Raf-1/MAPK pathway but not by PI3K, reduces integrins β1, α4, α5, and α6 and also inhibits ligand-binding activation epitope of β1 on the surface of osteoblasts and subsequent β1-mediated adhesion of osteoblasts to matrix proteins without changing the synthesis of matrix proteins and IL-6. H-Ras/Raf-1 pathway appeared to be involved in osteoblast adhesion to FN, VN, and LM, although it did not mediate the adhesion to COLL-I, a major bone matrix compartment. Although further evidence is required, we suppose that the pathway could function well when osteoblasts encounter with the circumstance in which the ratio of FN, VN, or LM is increased in bone matrix rather than usual COLL-I-enriched matrix. It was also reported that the expression of an active form of H-Ras and its effector kinase, Raf-1, in CHO cells stably expressing an active chimeric integrin suppressed the function of the chimeric α6A, β1, and β3. The suppression of integrin function correlated with the activation of the Ras/Raf/MAPK kinase pathway (31Hughes P.E. Renshaw M.W. Pfaff M. Forsyth J. Keivens V.M. Schwartz M.A. Ginsberg M.H.

In contrast, we reported that H-RasV12Y40C mutant, which binds to PI3K in T cells, induce the activated form of leukocyte function-associated antigen (LFA)-1α (αLβ2) and LFA-1-dependent adhesion to ICAM-1 (intercellular adhesion molecule 1) and that activation of LFA-1 is inhibited by PI3K inhibitors (15Tanaka Y. Minami Y. Mine S. Hirano H. Fujimoto H. Fujii K. Saito K. Tsukada J. van Kooyk Y. Figdor C.G. Kataoka T. Eto S. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 6209-6216PubMed Google Scholar). We also found that the expression of active form of H-Ras induces the activation of the β1 in B cells (16Fujimoto H. Tanaka Y. Liu Z. Yagita H. Okumura K. Kosugi A. Morinobu A. Yamamura H. Minami Y. Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Accumulating evidence demonstrates that PI3K appears to play a central role in integrin triggering (27Tanaka Y. Mine S.

One plausible explanation for such discrepant and complex nature of H-Ras functions can be considered to be that second signals induced by H-Ras may be differently involved in “on and off switch” for integrin triggering. Ras is known to be a hub that radiates multiple signaling pathway including Raf-1/MAPK and PI3K (10Marshall C.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). From our findings and others, we propose that H-Ras-sensitive PI3K activation is involved in “on switch” for integrin functions, whereas the H-Ras/Raf-1/MAPK may function as an “off switch” for integrin functions. We also observed that H-Ras signals, especially those followed by Raf-1/MAPK pathway but not PI3K, inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis of osteoblasts presumably via the reciprocal regulation of Fas/Bcl-2 expression. Such a regulation of cell survival/apoptosis is an important determinant of the life span of cells in regenerating tissues including bone in which continuous bone remodeling keeps its homeostasis. More than half of the osteoblasts, which initially present at the remodeling sites and complete their bone-forming function, undergo apoptosis, and that the process can be modulated by growth factors and/or cytokines produced in the bone microenvironment and by exogenous administration of glucocorticoids (34Jilka R.L.

Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 274-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (1425) Google Scholar). Thus, apoptosis of osteoblasts is a fundamental regulatory event during bone tissue differentiation (36Clohisy D.R. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1999; 134: 190-191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Fas gene is known to be a target gene of p53 during apoptosis, and the p53 mediates down-regulation of Bcl-2 protein presumably by binding to acis-acting p53-negative response element located in the 5′-untranslated region of the bcl-2 gene (37Owen-Schaub L.B. Zhang W. Cusack J.C. Angelo L.S. Santee S.M. Fujiwara T. Roth J.A. Deisseroth A.B. Zhang W. Kruzel E. Radinsky R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3032-3040Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). In addition, anti-Fas antibody stimulates apoptosis of human osteoblastic MG-63 cells, and Bcl-2 prevents this change (34Jilka R.L. Weinstein R.S. Bellido T. Parfitt A.M. Manolagas S.C. J. Bone. Miner. Res. 1998; 13: 793-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Our observation of increased expression of Fas and reduced expression of Bcl-2 in osteoblasts expressing H-RasV12 or H-RasV12T35S implies that the cells might be apoptotic at least partially mediated by Fas. Furthermore, the adhesion of osteoblasts to FN is required for the survival of osteoblasts and subsequent bone formation (38Globus R.K. Doty S.B. Lull J.C. Holmuhamedov E. Humphries M.J. Damsky C.H. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1385-1393Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The reduced β1-mediated adhesion of osteoblasts to matrix proteins such as FN, which is induced by H-Ras/Raf-1/MAPK signals, might further augment apoptotic features of osteoblasts. The potential importance of the balance between survival and apoptosis of osteoblasts during bone remodeling is well accepted. Taken together, we propose that H-Ras signals, especially those followed by Raf-1/MAPK pathway but not PI3K, not only reduces the expression of functionally active β1 and β1-mediated adhesion of osteoblasts to matrix proteins but induces apoptosis presumably via the Fas up-regulation and Bcl-2 down-regulation, and that such a regulation of cell cycle arrest is an important determinant of the life span of cells in regenerating bone in which continuous remodeling keeps its homeostasis. As described, the functions of osteoblasts during the remodeling cycle are tightly regulated by hormones, cytokines, prostaglandins, and growth factors, most of which transduce small G-proteins-mediated signaling. Thus, the regulation of Ras-mediated signaling might also lead to novel pharmacotherapeutic strategies for osteoporosis and other pathologic conditions in which tissue mass diminution has compromised functional integrity."

In endothelial cells, NO (produced froml-arginine by nitric-oxide synthase) diffuses into smooth muscle cells where it stimulates sGC, which ultimately leads to vasodilation. It has been accepted by many that nitrovasodilators, including the organic nitrates like nitroglycerin (GTN), cause vasodilation by their biotransformation to NO. Although many pathways invoking a variety of enzymes and different intermediates have been proposed to be involved in the biotransformation of GTN to NO, none have conclusively described the mechanism of action of GTN (10Thatcher R.G.J. Weldon H. Chem. Soc. Rev. 1998; 27: 331-337Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 11Feelisch M. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 1998; 358: 113-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Even the evidence for NO production from GTN is confounded by assays not sufficiently specific for NO (12Schmidt K. Klatt P. Mayer B. Biochem.

Clearly the mechanism of action of the nitrovasodilators is not fully understood. The problem of nitrate tolerance provides an additional impetus for the ongoing study of GTN. Tolerance, first documented in 1867 (15Marsh N. Marsh A. Clin. Exp. Pharmacol. Physiol. 2000; 27: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), is a clinical condition associated with a serious impairment of nitrovasodilator function as a result of its continuous administration. Mechanisms proposed to account for the development of nitrate tolerance include the depletion of essential thiols (16Needleman P. Lang S. Johnson E.M., Jr. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1972; 181: 489-497PubMed Google Scholar), decreased biotransformation of GTN to NO (17Chung S.J. Fung H.L. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1993; 45: 157-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), desensitization of sGC (1Waldman S.A. Rapoport R.M. Ginsburg R. Murad F. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1986; 35: 3525-3531Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), enhanced phosphodiesterase activity (18Bohyn M. Berkenboom G. Fontaine J. Cardiovasc. Drugs Ther. 1991; 5: 457-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), and production of vascular superoxide (19Munzel T. Sayegh H. Freeman B.A. Tarpey M.M. Harrison D.G. J. Clin. Investig. 1995; 95: 187-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). Despite extensive research conducted on nitrate tolerance, debate about its origin persists (20Abrams J. Elkayam U. Thadani U. Fung H.L. Am. J. Cardiol. 1998; 81: 3A-14AAbstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 21Parker J.D. Parker J.O. N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 338: 520-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Certainly understanding the mechanism by which GTN leads to smooth muscle relaxation will help to elucidate the cause of nitrate tolerance. Herein we have examined the reactivity of GTN with purified sGC to understand the activation of sGC by GTN and gain valuable insights into the potential role of sGC in the mechanism of nitrate tolerance. Unless otherwise indicated, all reagents were purchased from Sigma. 2-(N,N-Diethylamino)-diazenenolate-2-oxide (DEA/NO) was purchased from Cayman Chemical Company, Ann Arbor, MI. GTN was synthesized according to the method of Dunstan (22Dunstan, I., Griffiths, J. V., and Harvey, S. A. (1965)J. Chem. Soc. 1319Google Scholar). GMPCPP was a gift from Jonathan Winger, University of California, Berkeley, CA. Heterodimeric sGC (rat α1β1) was expressed using the baculovirus/Sf9 expression system and purified according to previously described methods (23Zhao Y. Brandish P.E. DiValentin M. Schelvis J.P. Babcock G.T. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10848-10854Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) except that dithiothreitol was excluded from the final gel filtration column. End point assays were performed in triplicate in a final volume of 100 μl as described previously (24Brandish P.E. Buechler W. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16898-16907Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) except that the GTP-regenerating system (phosphocreatine and creatine kinase) and the phosphodiesterase inhibitor (isobutyl-3-methylxanthine) were omitted. The assay mixture was comprised of 50 mmHEPES, pH 7.4, 1.5 mm GTP, 5.0 mmMgCl2, 2.0 mm Cys (where indicated), and other components as described. Assays were incubated with either DEA/NO, GTN, or potassium ferricyanide (K3Fe(CN)6) for 1 min, then initiated with 0.2–0.4 μg of sGC, and quenched after 2 min with 400 μl of 125 mm Na2CO3 and 500 μl of 125 mmZn(CH3CO2)2. GTN was added in Me2SO up to a final maximal concentration of 4% (v/v) Me2SO, which was shown not to affect the enzyme activity. DEA/NO stocks were prepared in 10 mm NaOH. After centrifugation of the assay mixtures and appropriate dilution, cGMP was measured as directed using the cGMP enzyme immunoassay kit, format B (BioMol). All electronic absorbance spectra were collected using a Cary 3E spectrophotometer at 10 °C in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. Anaerobic samples were prepared on a gas train with 10 cycles of N2 and vacuum. X-band EPR spectra were recorded at 13 K on a Bruker ESP-300E spectrometer with a Bruker ST9234 cavity resonator. All spectra were measured using 2.0 milliwatts of microwave power and a modulation amplitude of 9.5 G. Each spectrum is the signal average of 16 scans with the buffer spectrum subtracted. The sample volumes may have been small enough that positioning of the sample in the EPR cavity was important. Therefore, the GTN and GTN/Cys reactions were normalized to the adventitious ferric iron signal at g = 4.3 to correct for potential variation in signal. This normalization is justified because these samples came from the same enzyme stock solution. The reaction with K3Fe(CN)6 was not normalized because of additional free ferric iron introduced by K3Fe(CN)6. Anaerobic samples were prepared in an anaerobic chamber (Coy Laboratory Products, Inc., Grass Lake, MI) at room temperature and frozen in liquid N2. The reactions were allowed to proceed at room temperature until complete as determined by the separate analysis of the change in the heme Soret maximum (∼5 min for the reactions with K3Fe(CN)6 and GTN and 10 min for the reaction of GTN/Cys). At 37 °C and pH 7.4, DEA/NO is known to have a half-life of ∼2 min releasing 1.5 eq of NO (25Keefer L.K. Nims R.W. Davies K.M. Wink D.A. Packer L. Nitric Oxide, Part A: Sources and Detection of NO; NO Synthase. 268. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1996: 281-293Google Scholar). Purified sGC was activated 313-fold by DEA/NO with a maximal specific activity of 13,763 ± 649 nmol/min/mg (Table I). The inclusion of 2.0 mm Cys in this assay did not affect the -fold activation (321-fold) or the maximal response of DEA/NO (14,081 ± 900 nmol/min/mg). sGC was activated 67-fold by GTN in the presence of 2.0 mm Cys with a maximal specific activity of 2927 ± 495 nmol/min/mg. The activity of sGC after treatment with GTN (up to 1.0 mm) and in the absence of Cys remained at approximately the basal activity (Table I). As has been previously shown (26Stone J.R. Sands R.H. Dunham W.R. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3258-3262Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), K3Fe(CN)6 oxidized sGC to the ferric oxidation state with activity not significantly different from the basal activity of the ferrous enzyme. Oxidation of sGC by K3Fe(CN)6 followed by removal of excess K3Fe(CN)6 and subsequent treatment with Cys resulted in basal level activity (data not shown). The added Cys eventually reduced the ferric heme to ferrous but again yielded the expected basal level activity (data not shown).Table IActivity of sGCTreatmentSpecific activity-Fold activationnmol/min/mgDEA/NO13,763 ± 649313DEA/NO + Cys14,081 ± 900320GTN68 ± 21.5GTN + Cys2,927 ± 4967K3Fe(CN)6 1-aThe K3Fe(CN)6activity measurement is from a separate sGC preparation with maximal DEA/NO-stimulated activity of 10,881 nmol/min/mg and a basal activity of 48 nmol/min/mg.25 ± 30.5None44 ± 11Activity of sGC was measured in 100-μl assays in 50 mmHEPES, pH 7.4, 1.5 mm GTP, 5.0 mmMgCl2, and 2.0 mm Cys at 37 °C.

After centrifugation of the assay mixtures and appropriate dilution, cGMP was measured as directed using a cGMP enzyme immunoassay kit. sGC was isolated in the ferrous oxidation state with a heme Soret at 431 nm (Fig. 1 C). A comparison of the electronic absorption spectra of sGC-NO and sGC + GTN/Cys is shown (Fig. 1 A). Upon addition of DEA/NO, the enzyme rapidly binds NO giving a heme Soret at 399 nm (4Stone J.R. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5636-5640Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). In contrast, the reaction of GTN/Cys with sGC caused a heme Soret shift of the ferrous enzyme from 431 to 393 nm. Even under anaerobic conditions, we observed no shift in the heme Soret to 399 nm upon addition of GTN/Cys to sGC. Cysteine alone had no effect on the spectrum of ferrous sGC (data not shown). When Cys was included with the reaction of DEA/NO and sGC, a decrease in the 399 nm heme Soret was observed over time, due to a decrease in the half-life of sGC-NO in the presence of thiol, in agreement with previously reported results (24Brandish P.E. Buechler W. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16898-16907Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The electronic absorption spectra of the reactions of GTN and K3Fe(CN)6 with sGC are shown in Fig. 1 B. Similar to the reaction with K3Fe(CN)6, GTN reacted with sGC shifting the heme Soret of the ferrous enzyme from 431 to 392 nm, indicative of ferric sGC. GMPCPP (a non-hydrolyzable analogue of GTP) is a competitive inhibitor of sGC. 2J. A. Winger and M. A. Marletta, unpublished results. The electronic absorption spectrum of sGC-NO was unaffected by the presence of GTP (or GMPCPP) and MgCl2 (data not shown). In contrast, in the presence of 1.0 mm GMPCPP and 5.0 mmMgCl2, the change in the ferrous heme Soret induced by GTN/Cys was slightly altered from that in their absence, shifting the heme Soret from 431 to 395 nm (Fig. 1 C). Similar results were seen using GTP (data not shown). sGC (10 μm) was treated anaerobically with 1.0 mm GTN and 2.0 mm Cys (Fig. 2 A), 1.0 mm GTN (Fig. 2 B), or 810 μmK3Fe(CN)6 (Fig. 2 C), and the 13 K EPR spectra of these reactions are shown. In each of the experiments, there are distinct rhombic signals indicative of ferric heme and consistent with earlier results with g = 6.36, 5.16, and 2.0 and line widths of 3.3, 4.1, and 3.3 mT (26Stone J.R. Sands R.H. Dunham W.R. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3258-3262Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The signals in each spectrum at g = 4.3 are due to adventitious free ferric iron. In Fig. 2 C, the large signal associated with K3Fe(CN)6 is clearly visible at g = 2.5. For the reaction of GTN/Cys (Fig. 2 A), where 67-fold activation was measured, the only signals observed are for ferric sGC. Interestingly there are no three-line signals, previously shown to be characteristic of five-coordinate ferrous nitrosyl complexes (g = 2.076, 2.029, and 2.005 and line widths of 5.5, 5.7, and 5.8 mT) and indicative of activated sGC (27Stone J.R. Sands R.H. Dunham W.R. Marletta M.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 207: 572-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The intensity of the high spin ferric heme signal for the reaction of GTN/Cys with sGC was less than that of GTN or K3Fe(CN)6 with sGC. This observation is consistent with less enzyme being in the ferric oxidation state for the GTN/Cys-treated samples. Support for this interpretation comes from our optical data that show a more pronounced long wavelength shoulder for the GTN/Cys-treated samples (Fig. 1, A and C, dashed lines) as compared with GTN- or K3Fe(CN)6-treated samples (Fig. 1 B). The results presented herein clearly support the conclusion that the reaction of GTN alone with sGC leads to the 1-electron oxidation of ferrous sGC as depicted in Scheme FS1. Potassium ferricyanide is known to oxidize sGC to the ferric oxidation state (26Stone J.R. Sands R.H. Dunham W.R. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3258-3262Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and our results with GTN and sGC are essentially the same as what was observed with K3Fe(CN)6. First, the electronic absorption spectra of the reactions of sGC with K3Fe(CN)6and with GTN are nearly identical. Slight differences in the signal intensities of the heme Soret maxima can be attributed to the subtraction of the relatively large background K3Fe(CN)6 signal in that reaction. Second, the EPR spectra of the reactions of sGC with GTN or K3Fe(CN)6 gave signals that were the same as those previously reported for ferric sGC. The slight differences in the ferric heme signal at g = 2.0 are still under investigation. Finally, as expected for a sGC oxidant, GTN alone did not activate the enzyme. Although these results support a 1-electron oxidation of the ferrous heme of sGC by GTN, the expected GTN radical anion (GTN⨪) co-product of sGC oxidation was not observed. Several approaches were taken to detect this radical. The temperature of the sample shown in Fig. 1 B was increased from 13 K to 80 and 120 K without observation of an organic radical by EPR. In another set of anaerobic EPR experiments, attempts to trap the GTN radical anion with either 100 μm N-benzylidene-tert-butylamine-N-oxide or 100 μm 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide were unsuccessful. Presumably the GTN radical anion intermediate must be short-lived; thus, rapid freeze-quench EPR experiments will be required to observe it. GTN alone did not activate sGC above basal levels as expected based on previous results with ferric sGC (26Stone J.R. Sands R.H. Dunham W.R. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3258-3262Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). However, in the presence of Cys, GTN activated sGC ∼67-fold over the basal activity. DEA/NO, which activates sGC via NO, stimulated the enzyme greater than 300-fold in agreement with previous studies (4Stone J.R. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5636-5640Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). The attenuated maximal response for GTN/Cys appears to be a result of sGC activation through a species other than sGC-NO. The spectroscopic evidence presented herein clearly supports this hypothesis. Upon addition of sGC to GTN/Cys under conditions where the enzyme has been shown to be activated, a 399 nm heme Soret was not observed in the electronic absorption spectrum. sGC is an excellent trap for NO, binding at a nearly diffusion-controlled rate (28Stone J.R. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1093-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 29Zhao Y. Brandish P.E. Ballou D.P. Marletta M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14753-14758Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). If GTN/Cys stimulate sGC via NO, then trapping NO at the ferrous heme of sGC should have been spectroscopically observable by a shift of the heme Soret to 399 nm (the Soret maximum for sGC-NO). More convincingly the EPR spectra show no ferrous nitrosyl species, which is well characterized for sGC. If sGC is activated by GTN/Cys through a sGC-NO mechanism, then a three-line signal with g values of 2.076, 2.029, and 2.005 and line widths of 5.5, 5.7, and 5.8 mT would be present in the EPR spectrum (27Stone J.R. Sands R.H. Dunham W.R. Marletta M.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 207: 572-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Close scrutiny of the electronic absorption spectra shows a Soret generated on reaction of GTN/Cys at 393 nm (or 395 nm when GMPCPP is bound) that could be interpreted as the result of a mixture of ferric sGC and sGC-NO species. However, the EPR spectra clearly show no evidence for formation of sGC-NO in the reaction of GTN/Cys with sGC. The possibility exists that the ferrous nitrosyl species in the EPR is not observed because the enzyme does not have substrate bound since it has been shown that the presence of GTP or cGMP affects the observed rate constants for NO dissociation from sGC-NO (30Kharitonov V.G. Russwurm M. Magde D. Sharma V.S. Koesling D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 284-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and the wavelength of the heme Soret of sGC-CO with YC-1 (31Kharitonov V.G. Sharma V.S. Magde D. Koesling D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10699-10706Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). However, reactions of GTN/Cys with 5.0 μm sGC carried out with substrate (1.5 mm GTP and 5.0 mm MgCl2) or a non-hydrolyzable substrate analogue (1.5 mm GMPCPP and 5.0 mmMgCl2) gave the same EPR spectra as those without substrate or analogue (data not shown). Since activation of sGC by GTN/Cys does not proceed by way of sGC-NO, then clearly an alternate mechanism of sGC stimulation must be possible. Although not directly related to what we have observed here, CO has been shown to activate the enzyme 4.8-fold over basal activity (32Stone J.R. Marletta M.A. Chem. Biol. 1998; 5: 255-261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), showing that it is possible to activate sGC in heme-dependent but NO-independent fashion. Previous work also supports a NO-independent pathway. Using rat aortic homogenate as a source of sGC, it was shown that the rate of NO release from GTN/Cys under physiologically relevant conditions is not fast enough to account for the observed activation of sGC by GTN/Cys (33Artz J.D. Toader V. Zavorin S.I. Bennett B.M. Thatcher G.R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9256-9264Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). An important observation is the lack of sGC activation by GTN in the absence of Cys. Addition of Cys to ferric sGC (where excess K3Fe(CN)6 has been removed) did not activate sGC (data not shown). Thus, oxidation of sGC with the subsequent addition of a thiol was not sufficient for sGC activation. To account for the activation of sGC by GTN/Cys, there must be an activated sGC species present that cannot be sGC-NO or the same sGC species as generated upon its oxidation by K3Fe(CN)6 or GTN alone. One possibility is that GTN/Cys-induced activation of sGC is through a ferrous sGC species not detected by conventional EPR at low temperatures. The active species could be either an EPR-silent, low spin Fe(II) heme or a high spin, S = 2, Fe(II) heme adduct. Experiments using parallel mode excitation at X-band and high frequency-high field EPR methods will help distinguish between these possibilities. A second possibility involves the reaction (or interaction) of GTN/Cys or GTN⨪/Cys with ferric sGC generating an sGC species that is indistinguishable by conventional EPR from the sGC reaction with K3Fe(CN)6 or GTN alone (Scheme FS1). The mechanism of activation by GTN/Cys remains unclear, but some important details presented herein have given insight to the species responsible for activation. Direct activation of sGC by an organic nitrate seems unlikely because of the necessity for specific thiols (34Chong S. Fung H.L. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1991; 42: 1433-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Cys (or possibly other thiols) are required for activation of the enzyme, so any proposed mechanism must account for their role. The two reasonable alternatives discussed include: 1) an EPR-silent, low spin Fe(II) heme or a high spin, S = 2, Fe(II) heme adduct generated by reaction of GTN/Cys with the sGC heme, and 2) a modified ferric sGC species derived from the reaction (or interaction) with GTN/Cys or GTN⨪/Cys. Further spectroscopic studies are underway to differentiate between these proposed sGC active species as well as to observe the GTN radical anion. Although the mechanism of sGC activation by GTN/Cys has not been determined, the oxidation of sGC by GTN provides an attractive explanation for a potential role of sGC in the development of nitrate tolerance. Nearly 30 years ago, tolerance to GTN was observed to be associated with a decrease in the concentration of tissue thiols. Thus, it was put forth that the oxidation of free thiols to disulfides was responsible for the development of nitrate tolerance (16Needleman P. Lang S. Johnson E.M., Jr. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1972; 181: 489-497PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with this, it has also been shown that addition of dithiothreitol could reverse tolerance and prevent the development of tolerance when added concurrently with GTN (34Chong S. Fung H.L. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1991; 42: 1433-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Interestingly no correlation between the concentration of free thiol and the state of tolerance was found (35Gruetter C.A. Lemke S.M. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1986; 64: 1395-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). This observation contradicts a theory of tolerance involving the oxidation of free thiol but is not contradictory to a hypothesis involving the oxidation of ferrous sGC. To show that oxidized sGC is responsible for nitrate tolerance, a means to observe the oxidized species in tolerant tissue would be necessary. Nitrate tolerance is clearly a complex phenomenon with many factors ultimately contributing to the clinical end point (21Parker J.D. Parker J.O. N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 338: 520-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). The results reported here are consistent with the direct effect of organic nitrates on sGC playing a role in the tolerance that develops from sustained nitrate therapy.

https://openalex.org/W2010556242,"The rat follitropin receptor (rFSHR) is an unusual G protein-coupled receptor in that agonist-induced activation leads to the phosphorylation of the first and third intracellular loops instead of the C-terminal tail. To determine regions of G protein-coupled receptors that affect internalization independently of phosphorylation we examined the effects of truncations of the C-terminal tail of the rFSHR on agonist-induced internalization. Our studies show that progressive truncations of a region flanked by residues 642 and 651 enhance the internalization of human follicle-stimulating hormone (hFSH). Further characterization of a mutant truncated at residue 649 (designated rFSHR-t649) and another mutant in which the 642–651 region was deleted in the context of the full-length rFSHR, designated rFSHR(Δ642–651), showed that both of them internalized hFSH at rates that were 2–3 times faster than rFSHR-wild type (wt). Like rFSHR-wt, however, the internalization of hFSH mediated by rFSHR-t649 and rFSHR(Δ642–651) can be inhibited with dominant-negative mutants of the non-visual arrestins or dynamin. Alanine-scanning mutagenesis of the 642–651 region suggests that the effects on internalization are not mediated by a single residue, however. In an attempt to understand the molecular basis of the enhanced internalization of hFSH mediated by these mutants we used an assay that can be readily used to assess the association of the rFSHR with the arrestin-3 in co-transfected cells. Using this assay we were able to show that, when compared with rFSHR-wt, rFSHR(Δ642–651) displays an ∼4-fold enhancement in binding affinity for arrestin-3 and an ∼1.7-fold reduction in maximal arrestin-3 binding capacity. We conclude that a short linear sequence present in the C-terminal tail of the rFSHR (642SATHNFHARK651) that is not phosphorylated limits internalization by lowering the affinity of the rFSHR for the endogenous non-visual arrestins.

G protein-coupled receptor G protein-coupled receptor kinase follicle-stimulating hormone follitropin receptor rat FSHR green fluorescent protein human FSH wild type A large number of studies performed during the past several years have established that the binary complex formed by GPCRs1 and the non-visual arrestins (arrestin-2 and arrestin-3, also known as β-arrestin-1 and β-arrestin-2, respectively) serves as a common molecular intermediate in the agonist-induced G protein uncoupling and internalization of these receptors and in the generation/propagation of G protein-independent signals. The formation of this complex is in turn facilitated by agonist-induced activation and/or by the G protein-coupled receptor kinase (GRK)-catalyzed phosphorylation of the GPCRs (reviewed in Refs. 1Ferguson S.S.G. Pharmacol. Rev. 2001; 53: 1-24PubMed Google Scholar and 2Pierce K.L. Lefkowitz R.J. Nat. Rev. Neuro. 2001; 2: 727-733Crossref Scopus (359) Google Scholar). The follitropin receptor (FSHR) is a large GPCR (∼700 amino acids) that binds a large and complex protein ligand (FSH, Mr ∼30,000) with nanomolar affinity (3Pierce J.G. Parsons T.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 465-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (1886) Google Scholar, 4Simoni M. Gromoll J. Nieschlag E. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 739-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar, 5Segaloff D.L. Ascoli M. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 324-347PubMed Google Scholar). The binding of hFSH to the rat FSHR (rFSHR) promotes the rapid internalization of the agonist-receptor complex (6Nakamura K. Hipkin R.W. Ascoli M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 580-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 7Nakamura K. Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Ascoli M. J. Biol.

Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 866-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Agonist-induced internalization of the rFSHR proceeds via a dynamin-dependent pathway, and it involves the GRK-catalyzed phosphorylation of the rFSHR in the first and third intracellular loops and the interaction of the activated/phosphorylated rFSHR with the non-visual arrestins (6Nakamura K. Hipkin R.W. Ascoli M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 580-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 7Nakamura K. Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Ascoli M. J. Biol.

The internalization of the rFSHR seems to be more dependent on receptor activation and non-visual arrestin binding than on receptor phosphorylation, however. Thus, co-transfection of cells with the clathrin-binding domains of arrestin-2 or -3 or with a dominant-negative mutant of dynamin induces a substantial inhibition of internalization, whereas mutation of the rFSHR phosphorylation sites or dominant-negative inhibitors of GRKs is generally less effective in inhibiting internalization (6Nakamura K. Hipkin R.W. Ascoli M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 580-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 7Nakamura K. Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Ascoli M. J. Biol.

Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 866-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Additional studies conducted with two signaling-impaired mutants of the rFSHR that retain the phosphorylation sites (designated rFSHR-D389N and rFSHR-Y530F) also underscored the importance of receptor activation on non-visual arrestin-mediated internalization (7Nakamura K. Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Ascoli M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24346-24354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). These two mutants display impairments in agonist-induced activation and phosphorylation and internalize the bound agonist at a slow rate. Co-transfection with GRK2 partially rescues the phosphorylation of both mutants but rescues only the internalization of rFSHR-D389N, while co-transfection with arrestin-3 rescues the internalization of both mutants (7Nakamura K. Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Ascoli M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24346-24354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). With this information in mind, we initiated a new series of experiments designed to define the structural features of the rFHSR that are important for internalization and for the binding of the non-visual arrestins. Because we are particularly interested in defining features that affect these processes without affecting phosphorylation, we concentrated on the C-terminal tail of the rFSHR because this region of the rFHSR is not phosphorylated upon agonist-induced activation (6Nakamura K. Hipkin R.W. Ascoli M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 580-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 7Nakamura K. Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Ascoli M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 26683-26689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). A full-length cDNA encoding the rFSHR in pcDNAI/Neo has been described (11Sprengel R. Braun T. Nikolics K. Segaloff D.L. Seeburg P.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 525-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Truncations of the C-terminal tail of the rFSHR were constructed using PCR strategies to introduce a stop codon in the position immediately following the new desired C terminus. The deletion of the 642–651 region from the rFSHR and the simultaneous mutation of these 10 residues to alanines were also accomplished using PCR strategies. The mutation of individual residues in the 642–651 region was accomplished using the Stratagene QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit. The rFSHR-wt, rFSHR-t649, rFSHR(Δ642–651), and the point and cluster mutations of the 642–651 region were epitope-tagged by introducing the Myc epitope between the predicted C terminus of the signal peptide and the predicted N terminus of the mature receptor as described earlier for the rat and human lutropin receptor (12Fabritz J. Ryan S. Ascoli M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 664-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 13Min L. Ascoli M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1797-1810Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). When tested for expression, internalization, and hFSH-stimulated cAMP accumulation the Myc-tagged versions of rFSHR-wt, rFSHR-t649, and rFSHR(Δ642–651) behaved similarly to the non-tagged versions (data not shown). The identity of all mutants was verified by automated DNA sequencing (performed by the DNA core of the Diabetes and Endocrinology Research Center of The University of Iowa). Expression vectors for arrestin-3, arrestin-3(284–409) and arrestin-3-GFP have been described (14Krupnick J.G. Santini F. Gagnon A.W. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L. J. Biol.

The arrestin-3 construct was tagged with the FLAG epitope at the N terminus and subcloned into pcDNA3.1 for expression as described elsewhere (16Min L. Galet C. Ascoli M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 702-710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). An expression vector for hemagglutinin-tagged dynamin K44A (17Damke H. Baba T. Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 915-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Dr. Sandra Schmid (The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA). Transient transfections of 293T cells were done using the calcium phosphate method of Chen and Okayama (18Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4799) Google Scholar). Cells were plated in gelatin-coated plasticware. Cells plated in 35-mm wells were used for binding assays, internalization assays, and regular Western blots. Cells plated in 100-mm dishes were used for β-arrestin binding assays. All cells were transfected when 70–80% confluent with the amounts of plasmid DNA indicated in the figure or table legends. After an overnight incubation the cells were washed and used 24 h later. Because the hFSH bound to intact cells at 37 °C is quickly internalized this condition cannot be used to measure equilibrium binding parameters (i.e. binding affinity and maximal binding capacity) as the reaction is not reversible. Conversely, measurements of hFSH binding to intact cells at 4 °C (a condition that prevents internalization, thus allowing for reversibility of the binding reaction) cannot be accurately analyzed because the binding affinity of hFSH is greatly reduced at this low temperature. We thus settled on measuring equilibrium binding parameters using binding assays to intact cells that had been co-transfected with dynamin-K44A (to prevent internalization) and incubated with hormone at room temperature (to further slow down internalization). Binding parameters for hFSH were measured during a 1-h incubation of intact cells (plated in 35-mm wells) with seven different concentrations of 125I-hFSH (3 × 10−10 to 1 × 10−7m) at room temperature. Binding reactions were conducted in 1 ml of assay medium (Waymouths MB752/1 without NaHCO3 but containing 20 mm Hepes, 50 μg/ml gentamicin, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4). At the end of the incubation the monolayers were washed two or three times (using 1-ml aliquots of cold Hanks' balanced salt solution supplemented with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). The cells were then dissolved in 100 μl of 1 n NaOH, collected with a cotton swab, and counted in a γ counter. Three wells were used for each concentration of 125I-hFSH. Two of them received 125I-hFSH only, but the third one also received 1 μg/ml equine FSH to correct for nonspecific binding. Equilibrium binding parameters were calculated from the binding data using the Prism® Software package. For cAMP assays the transfected cells (plated in 35-mm wells coated with gelatin) were incubated with five different concentrations of hFSH (3 × 10−12 to 3 × 10−8m) in 1 ml of assay medium supplemented with 0.5 mm isobutylmethylxanthine for 2 h at 37 °C. Total cAMP (i.e. cells + medium) was extracted and measured by radioimmunoassay as described elsewhere (19Segaloff D.L. Ascoli M. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11420-11423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Pereira M.E. Segaloff D.L. Ascoli M. Eckstein F. J. Biol.

Segaloff D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6674-6681Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The parameters that describe these dose responses (i.e. EC50 and maximal response) were calculated by fitting the data with the Prism Software package. For the inositol phosphate assays the transfected cells (plated in 35-mm wells coated with gelatin) were placed in inositol-free medium containing 2–4 μCi/ml [2-3H]myoinositol (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 18–24 h. The cells were then washed and placed in 1 ml of warm assay medium containing 20 mm LiCl. After a 15-min preincubation (at 37 °C) duplicate wells were incubated with increasing concentrations of hFSH for an additional 30 min at 37 °C as shown in Fig. 3. The medium was then aspirated, and the total inositol phosphates present in the cells were extracted and quantitated as described before (22Ascoli M. Pignataro O.P. Segaloff D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6674-6681Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The rates of internalization of 125I-hFSH were measured using an acid-stripping procedure as described elsewhere (6Nakamura K. Hipkin R.W. Ascoli M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 580-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 23Nakamura K. Liu X. Ascoli M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25426-25432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Some of the internalization data are expressed as an internalization index, which is defined as the ratio of the internalized to surface-bound hormone (24Wiley H.S. Cunningham D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4222-4229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This index is used because under the assay conditions used here plots of the internalization index against time are linear and can be used to calculate a rate constant and a half-time for internalization (23Nakamura K. Liu X. Ascoli M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25426-25432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). These were basically done as recently described for the human lutropin receptor (16Min L. Galet C. Ascoli M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 702-710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were co-transfected with the Myc-rFSHR-wt or Myc-rFSHR(Δ642–651), FLAG-arrestin-3, and dynamin-K44A as indicated in the figure legends. The cells were then incubated with or without a saturating concentration of hFSH (50 nm) at 37 °C as indicated in the figure legends, and then the receptor-arrestin-3 complex was stabilized by cross-linking with dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate), as described elsewhere (16Min L. Galet C. Ascoli M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 702-710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The methods used to lyse the cross-linked cells, immunoprecipitate the complexes, and immunoblot the immunoprecipitates have also been described (16Min L. Galet C. Ascoli M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 702-710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitates were resolved on polyacrylamide gels, and electrophoretic blots were prepared as described elsewhere (25Quintana J. Hipkin R.W. Ascoli M. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 2098-2104Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Blots of the immunoprecipitates were incubated with anti-FLAG (M2) or anti-Myc (9E10) monoclonal antibodies covalently coupled to horseradish peroxidase (final dilution of 1:500 or 1:1000, respectively) for 1 h at room temperature using the blocking and incubation conditions described elsewhere (25Quintana J. Hipkin R.W. Ascoli M. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 2098-2104Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The amount of arrestin-3 expressed was similarly determined using small aliquots of the whole cell lysate containing equivalent amounts of protein. Proteins were directly visualized and quantitated using a combination of the Super Signal West Femto Maximum Sensitivity system of detection (Pierce) and a Kodak digital imaging system. This image-capturing system is set up to alert us when image saturation occurs and to prevent us from measuring the intensity of such images. Apparent binding constants for the FLAG-arrestin-3/rFSHR interaction were measured using cells co-transfected with increasing amounts of the FLAG-arrestin-3 expression vector as shown in Fig. 6. The amount of FLAG-arrestin-3 present in the immunoprecipitates was corrected for the amount of receptor present in the immunoprecipitates, and the binding data were plotted against the amount of FLAG-arrestin-3 plasmid used for transfection. The binding data were then directly fitted to a hyperbola using the non-linear regression analysis included in the Prism Software package (the regression coefficients for the non-linear regressions were at least 0.98). Cells were plated in 8-chamber coverslip culture vessels coated with polylysine (BioCoat from BD PharMingen). They were co-transfected (in a total volume of 400 μl) with 400 ng of Myc-tagged rFSHR, 4 ng of arrestin-3-GFP, and 100 ng of dynamin-K44A using the methods described above. Two days after transfection the cells were incubated with or without hFSH for 20 min at 37 °C as described above for the arrestin-3 binding assays. The preparation of the cells was done as recently described (16Min L. Galet C. Ascoli M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 702-710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The rFSHR was visualized with the 9E10 monoclonal antibody followed by a secondary antibody labeled with rhodamine, and the arrestin-3-GFP were visualized with a BioRad confocal microscope at the Central Microscopy Facility of The University of Iowa. Human kidney 293T cells are a derivative of 293 cells that express the SV40T antigen (26Margolskee R. McHenry-Rinde B. Horn R.

Partially purified equine FSH was kindly donated by Dr. George Bousfield (Wichita State University).125I-hFSH was prepared as previously described (27Ascoli M. Puett D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 99-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The 9E10 and M2 monoclonal antibodies coupled to horseradish peroxidase were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals and Sigma, respectively. The 9E10 monoclonal antibody was prepared by the Hybridoma Facility of the Cancer Center of The University of Iowa. The secondary antibody coupled to rhodamine was from Sigma. Dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate) was purchased from Pierce. Cell culture supplies and reagents were obtained from Corning and Invitrogen, respectively. All other chemicals were obtained from commonly used suppliers. Fig. 1A shows the effect of 23 progressive truncations of the C-terminal tail of the rFSHR on the internalization of hFSH. Each truncated construct was transiently transfected in 293 cells, and internalization was measured during a 9-min incubation at 37 °C with a concentration of125I-hFSH equivalent to the Kd. The results are expressed as internalization index, which is defined as the ratio of internalized/surface-bound ligand (24Wiley H.S. Cunningham D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4222-4229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This index can be readily used to approximate the rate of internalization because a plot of the internalization index versus time is linear for at least 20 min and the slope of this plot gives the rate constant of internalization (see “Materials and Methods”). The results of these experiments (Fig. 1A) show that truncations of the C-terminal tail up to residue 652 have no effect on internalization and further truncations to residue 642 enhance the rate of internalization of 125I-hFSH, whereas even more severe truncations (starting at residue 640) inhibit internalization. The effect of truncations that enhance internalization was confirmed by deletion of the appropriate residues (i.e. the642SATHNFHARK651 region) from the full-length rFSHR. As shown in Fig. 1B, a mutant lacking this region, designated rFSHR(Δ642–651), also displayed and enhanced the rate of internalization of hFSH. Alanine scanning mutagenesis showed that mutation of the individual residues present in the 642–651 region does not enhance internalization (Fig. 2). In fact, the only effect on internalization detected with the alanine scanning mutagenesis was a slight decrease in internalization induced by mutation of Ser642 (Fig. 2). Because the only charged residues in the 642–651 region are four basic residues (His645, His648, Arg650, and Lys651) we also examined the importance of the charge of this region by analyzing an additional mutant in which these four basic residues were simultaneously mutated to alanine. The 9-min internalization index of this cluster mutant (0.45 ± 0.02, n = 3) was not statistically different from that of the rFSHR-wt (0.40 ± 0.02, n = 3). The molecular basis of the enhanced internalization was next examined using one of the shortest truncations that enhances internalization (i.e. rFSHR-t649 and rFSHR(Δ642–651)). Table I shows that the expression and the ligand binding affinity of rFSHR-t649 and rFSHR(Δ642–651) are comparable with those of rFSHR-wt. Because the rFSHR can stimulate cAMP and inositol phosphate accumulation (9Quintana J. Hipkin R.W. Sánchez-Yagüe J. Ascoli M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8772-8779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Hipkin R.W. Liu X. Ascoli M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26683-26689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), we measured the signaling properties of rFSHR-t649 and rFSHR(Δ642–651) using the activation of these two pathways as end points. Cells expressing rFSHR-t649 or rFSHR(Δ642–651) display basal levels of cAMP comparable with those of cells expressing rFSHR-wt, but their maximal cAMP response to hFSH is reduced by ∼50 and 20%, respectively (Table I). The EC50 for the hFSH-induced cAMP accumulation was also increased ∼1.6-fold in cells expressing rFSHR(Δ642–651) but was not changed in cells expressing rFSHR-t649 (Table I). The basal levels of inositol phosphates were similar in cells expressing rFSHR-wt, rFSHR-t649, or rFSHR(Δ642–651), but cells expressing either of these two mutants display a 60–70% reduction in the maximal hFSH-induced inositol phosphate response (Fig. 3).Table IHuman FSH binding and hFSH-induced cAMP response in 293T cells expressing the rFSHR-wt or mutants thereofReceptor125I-hFSH bindingcAMP responseKdMaximal bindingBasalEC50Maximal responsenmmolecules/cellpmol/106cellsnmpmol/106 cellsrFSHR-wt1.8 ± 0.2340,000 ± 30,00010.2 ± 0.30.15 ± 0.021075 ± 38rFSHR(t649)1.6 ± 0.1333,000 ± 54,00011.5 ± 1.50.16 ± 0.01560 ± 42*rFSHR(Δ642–651)2.0 ± 0.3390,000 ± 30,00010.7 ± 0.40.24 ± 0.03*886 ± 21* Open table in a new tab Together these results clearly show that rFSHR activation is impaired by the two mutations examined. These changes are unlikely to be responsible for the increased internalization of hFSH mediated by either of these two mutants, however, because impairments in rFSHR activation have been previously shown to inhibit the internalization of hFSH rather than to enhance it (7Nakamura K. Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Ascoli M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24346-24354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). It is also of interest to note that rFSHR-t635, a more extensive truncation that impairs internalization (cf. Fig. 1A), has no effect on hFSH binding affinity or receptor expression, but it enhances the maximal cAMP and inositol phosphate responses to hFSH (10Hipkin R.W. Liu X. Ascoli M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26683-26689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Because the rFSHR-wt is internalized by a pathway that depends on the non-visual arrestins and dynamin (7Nakamura K. Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Ascoli M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24346-24354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 8Lazari M.F.M. Liu X. Nakamura K. Benovic J.L. Ascoli M. Mol.

This was done by measuring the rates of internalization of hFSH in cells co-transfected with arrestin-3(284–409), a dominant-negative mutant of non-visual arrestin-mediated internalization (14Krupnick J.G.

Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 915-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar). Table II shows that, as expected, the half-time of internalization of hFSH mediated by these two mutants is shorter than that mediated by rFSHR-wt. More importantly, however, the results presented in Table II show that co-transfection of cells with arrestin-3(284–409) or dynamin-K44A inhibit the rate of internalization of hFSH mediated by both receptors. We conclude from these experiments that, like rFSHR-wt, rFSHR-t649 and rFSHR(Δ642–651) internalize hFSH by a pathway that depends on the non-visual arrestin and dynamin. The data presented in Table II also show that some internalization of hFSH still occurs in cells co-transfected with arrestin-3(284–409) or dynamin-K44A (Table II). Because pathways of internalization that are independent of dynamin and/or the non-visual arrestins have also been described (29Bünemann M. Hosey M.M. J. Physiol.

https://openalex.org/W2101389149,"Staphylococcal enterotoxins are superantigen exotoxins that mediate food poisoning and toxic shock syndrome in humans. Despite their structural and functional similarities, superantigens display subtle differences in biological properties and modes of receptor binding as a result of zinc atoms bound differently in their crystal structures. For example, the crystal structures of the staphylococcal enterotoxins in the type C serogroup (SECs) contain a zinc atom coordinated by one aspartate and two histidine residues from one molecule and another aspartate residue from the next molecule, thus forming a dimer. This type of zinc ligation and zinc-mediated dimerization occurs in several SECs, but not in most other staphylococcal enterotoxin serogroups. This prompted us to investigate the potential importance of zinc in SEC-mediated pathogenesis. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to replace SEC zinc binding ligands with alanine. SEC mutants unable to bind zinc did not have major conformational alterations although they failed to form dimers. Zinc binding was not essential for T cell stimulation, emesis, or lethality although in general the mutants were less pyrogenic. Thus the zinc atom in SECs might represent a non-functional heavy atom in an exotoxin group that has diverged from related bacterial toxins containing crucial zinc atoms.

Fast D.J Nelson R.D. Schlievert P.M. Crit. Rev. Microbiol. 1990; 17: 251-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). The SEs cause at least two human illnesses, staphylococcal food poisoning (SFP) and toxic shock syndrome (TSS) (1Bohach G.A. Fast D.J Nelson R.D. Schlievert P.M. Crit. Rev. Microbiol. 1990; 17: 251-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar, 2Jablonski L.M. Bohach G.A. Doyle M.P. Beuchat L.P. Montville T.J. Food Microbiology: Fundamentals and Frontiers. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1997: 353-375Google Scholar). Although the pathogenesis has not been completely elucidated for either disease, TSS results from the superantigen (SAg) activity of the SEs, toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1), or other pyrogenic toxins. SAgs are potent immune cell stimulators and induce the proliferation of T cells in a manner that depends on the Vβ sequences of the T cell receptor (TCR) (3White J. Herman A. Pullen A.M. Kubo R. Kappler J.W. Marrack P. Cell. 1989; 56: 27-35Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar, 4Monday S.R. Bohach G.A. Alouf J.E. Freer J.H. The Comprehensive Sourcebook of Bacterial Toxins. Academic Press, London1999: 589-610Google Scholar). This type of immunostimulation results from specific interaction of SAgs with the MHC class II molecules (MHCII) on antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in addition to TCR. Activation of large numbers of T cells and APCs causes massive release of cytokines, which contribute to the effects on the cardiovascular and other organ systems leading to TSS. Some studies have suggested that direct cytotoxicity to other cells contributes to the pathogenesis of TSS (5Kushnaryov V.M. Macdonald H.M. Reiser R.F. Bergdoll M.S. Rev. Infect. Dis. 1989; 11: S282-S287Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 6Lee P.K. Vercellotti G.M. Deringer J.R. Schlievert P.M. J. Infect. Dis. 1991; 164: 711-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Although TSS and staphylococcal food poisoning have overlapping symptoms, the pathogenesis of each is unique, and the biological activities responsible for both diseases are determined by separate regions of the SE molecules (7Alber G. Hammer D.K. Fleischer B. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 4501-4506PubMed Google Scholar, 8Harris T.O. Grossman D. Kappler J.W. Marrack P. Rich R.R. Betley M.J. Infect.

Microbiol. 1994; 13: 897-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The route of exposure also determines which disease will result. TSS requires systemic exposure to any pyrogenic toxin, whereas staphylococcal food poisoning results from SEs in the gastrointestinal tract following ingestion in food (2Jablonski L.M. Bohach G.A. Doyle M.P. Beuchat L.P. Montville T.J. Food Microbiology: Fundamentals and Frontiers. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1997: 353-375Google Scholar). The hallmark symptom, emesis, can be accompanied by other effects including diarrhea and abdominal cramping. Evidence suggests that SEs interact with receptors on mast cells, and further that neuropeptides generated contribute to the emetic response (10Scheuber P.H. Denzlinger C. Wilker D. Beck G.

Although the number of recognized SEs continues to grow, these classical SEs (SEA through SEH) can be divided into general subgroups based on the degree of sequence homology. SEA, SED, SEE, and SEH share higher sequence homology and form one subgroup, whereas SEB and SECs forms another subgroup. The SECs are a highly related heterogeneous group of serologically cross-reactive but distinct molecular variants produced by some staphylococcal species, particularly S. aureus and S. intermedius isolates from several animal hosts (13Edwards V.M. Deringer J.R. Callantine S.D. Deobald C.F. Berger P.H. Kapur V. Stauffacher C.V. Bohach G.A. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 2346-2352Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The amino acid sequences of the SEC molecular variants share more than 90% identity. One conserved property of the SECs is their ability to bind zinc (14Papageorgiou A.C. Acharya K.R. Shapiro R.

Although several SAgs bind zinc, their mechanisms for zinc ligation vary and are usually different from that of SECs (TableI). The SEC zinc binding mechanism is similar to that of metalloproteases such as thermolysin. Three residues in the SECs (His-118, Glu-119, and His-122) form a motif (HEXXH), which provides two of the zinc binding ligands. Interestingly, zinc was not found in the structure of SEB (16Swaminathan S. Furey W. Pletcher J. Sax M. Nature. 1992; 359: 801-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 17Papageorgiou A.C.

This diversity raises questions as to why the zinc atoms are found at different places in the structures of this otherwise related group of toxins. The goal of this present study was to determine the effect of zinc binding for the structure and function of the SEC group of toxins.

Native SEC3 was purified directly from theStaphylococcus sp. FRI-909 strain (23Marr J.C. Lyon J.D. Roberson J.R. Lupher M. Davis W.C. Bohach G.A. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 4254-4262Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Homogenous SEC3 protein preparations were crystallized into two crystal forms, both of which diffracted to atomic resolution (24Bohach G.A. Chi Y.-I. Stauffacher C.V. Proteins. 1992; 13: 152-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The structure presented in this present report was determined from the tetragonal crystal form (P4122) with unit cell dimensions of a = b = 43.7 Å andc = 280.5 Å, with one molecule in the asymmetric unit. The native data set to 2.6 Å was collected at room temperature with a Xentronics/Siemens multiwire area director coupled to an Elliot-20 rotating anode generator and processed using the XDS package (25Kabsch W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1988; 2: 916-924Crossref Scopus (1680) Google Scholar). A commercial kit (Altered Sites II in vitromutagenesis systems, Promega) was used to create site-specific mutations in sec MNDON, allowing the expression of mutant toxins containing alanine substitutions at one or more of the three positions in SEC1 occupied by zinc binding residues (Asp-83, His-118, His-122). Five different mutant genes were constructed; three encoding proteins with single alanine substitutions and two with double alanine substitutions. The mutant toxins expressed by these genes were designated SEC1(D83A), SEC1(H118A), SEC1(H122A), SEC1(D83A/H118A), and SEC1(D83A/H122A) based on the amino acid positions involved. For expression, each mutant gene or native sec MNDONwas subcloned into the chimeric shuttle vector pMIN164 and then transformed via protoplast transformation into the non-toxigenic background of S. aureus RN4220 as described previously (26Bohach G.A. Schlievert P.M. Infect. Immun. 1987; 55: 428-432Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,27Hovde C.J. Hackett S.P. Bohach G.A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1990; 220: 329-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Recombinant toxins were purified to apparent homogeneity from culture supernatants by preparative isoelectric focusing as described previously (26Bohach G.A. Schlievert P.M. Infect. Immun. 1987; 55: 428-432Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Size and purity of each toxin and mutant were assessed by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) (see below). SEC1 and various mutants (typically 1–10 μg) were resolved by denaturing, discontinuous, SDS-PAGE in 12.5% gels using established techniques (28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207478) Google Scholar), with the minor modification of adding 10% glycerol to the resolving gel. Proteins were visualized in the gels by staining with Coomassie Blue. Prestained size markers were used as standards. For native gel experiments, ∼5 μg of each toxin, SEC1 and SEC1(D83A/H122A), was loaded onto a continuous native, 12.5% polyacrylamide gel. The gel system used was equivalent to the denaturing gel system above except that SDS was omitted from both the gel and tank buffer, and the sample buffer contained no β−mercaptoethanol. Purified SEC1 or SEC1(D83A/H122A) (125 μg each) were loaded onto a Sephadex G-75 column equilibrated with 10 mm phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, and 10 mm ZnCl2. Monomer and dimer forms of the toxins were eluted and detected as a change in absorbance at 280 nm. Molecular weight markers were used to determine the size of eluted proteins. To assess the effect of each mutation on the ability of SEC1 to bind zinc, native SEC1 and each of the five mutant proteins were compared under identical conditions. After exhaustive washing of each protein with buffer (2 mmHEPES, pH 7.0) using a Centricon 10 filter (Amicon, Beverly, MA), the retentates were analyzed for zinc content by ICP MS (Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry) using an ISA/Jobin Yvon model JY24 with a high efficiency nebulizer (29Jarvis K.E. Gray A.L. Houk R.S. Handbook of Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry. Chapman & Hall, Glasgow and London1991Google Scholar). To determine the effect of zinc or zinc binding residues on the activity of SEC1 as a SAg, SEC1 or mutants were compared for their abilities to induce proliferation of human T cells. Incorporation of [3H]thymidine into cellular DNA during stimulation in culture was used as an index for lymphocyte proliferation (30Poindexter N.J. Schlievert P.M. J. Infect. Dis. 1985; 151: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Purified mutant toxins or native SEC1 were added to T-lymphocyte-enriched cultures in complete RPMI 1640 medium and incubated at 37 °C in 7% CO2 for 72 h. Cultures were pulsed (18–24 h) with 1.0 μCi of [3H]thymidine. Cellular DNA was harvested on glass fiber filters, and the level of radioactivity incorporated was quantitated by liquid scintillation counting. The rabbit model described by Kim and Watson (31Kim Y.B. Watson D.W. J. Exp. Med. 1970; 131: 611-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) was used to compare lethality and fever inducedin vivo by SEC1 and several selected mutants as an indication of their potential to induce fever and TSS. Each animal (adult New Zealand White rabbit) was given an initial intravenous injection containing SEC1 or a mutant (0.01–10 μg/kg) dissolved in 0.9% NaCl. After monitoring rectal temperature for 4 h, an intravenous injection of endotoxin (Difco) from Salmonella typhimurium was administered at a dose equal to one-fiftieth of its LD50 (10 μg/kg). Mortality was monitored for 48 h. Fisher exact probability test was used in the StarView statistical package (Version 4.57, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) to determine statistical significance between treatment groups. A modification (9Hovde C.J. Marr J.M. Hoffman M.L. Hackett S.P. Chi Y.-I. Crum K.K. Stevens D.L. Stauffacher C.V. Bohach G.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 13: 897-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) of the standard monkey feeding assay for SEs (32Bergdoll M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 165: 324-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) was used for comparing the emetic capability of SEC1 and several representative zinc binding mutants. Toxins (10 μg/ml) were administered in sterile saline to manually restrained young adult (5–10 kg) pigtail monkeys (Macaca nemestrina) through a nasogastric tube (infant feeding tube; BD PharMingen). Each animal received 1.0 ml of toxin solution per kg of body weight so that the dose received was 10 μg/kg. We had determined previously that this dose of native SEC1 is sufficient to induce emesis in 100% of animals tested using this technique (9Hovde C.J. Marr J.M. Hoffman M.L. Hackett S.P. Chi Y.-I. Crum K.K. Stevens D.L. Stauffacher C.V. Bohach G.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 13: 897-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Animals were returned to their cages following removal of the nasogastric tube and observed for 24 h. Purified preparations of SEC1 or mutants were incubated in the presence of trypsin or pepsin to assess the contribution of zinc binding residues toward overall conformation and potential stability of SEC1 in the gastrointestinal tract. The susceptibility to trypsin was assessed as follows. Each protein (100 μg/ml) was incubated at 37 °C with trypsin type XI (100 ng/ml) (Sigma Chemical Company) using standard reaction conditions (25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 20 mm CaCl2) as described previously (9Hovde C.J. Marr J.M. Hoffman M.L. Hackett S.P. Chi Y.-I. Crum K.K. Stevens D.L. Stauffacher C.V. Bohach G.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 13: 897-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). After incubation for desired periods of time, aliquots were removed, and the digestions were terminated by boiling (5 min) in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The extent of proteolysis was assessed by SDS-PAGE as described above. To assess the relative liability to pepsin, each toxin or mutant (100 μg/ml) was incubated (37 °C) with pepsin (50 μg/ml) in a final volume of 100 μl (100 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.5). At selected time points, aliquots (10 μl) of the digestion mixture were removed, and the proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE. Control lanes contained toxin or mutant proteins removed from reaction mixtures exposed to identical conditions in the absence of protease. The structure was solved by the molecular replacement method using the AMORE program (33Navaza J. Acta Crystrallogr. 1994; D50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5030) Google Scholar). Our previously determined SEC3 structure 2Y-I. Chi, G. A. Bohach, and C. V. Stauffacher, unpublished observations. from another (P1) crystal form was used as a search model. The refinement of the model was then continued with the group B factor refinement followed by the simulated-annealing protocols implemented in X-PLOR (34Brünger A.T. X-PLOR Manual Version 3.1. Yale University, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar). The rebuilding of the model including addition of solvent molecules and a zinc atom was done on the graphic program O (35Jones T.A. Zhou J.-Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. 1991; A47: 110-119Crossref Scopus (13014) Google Scholar). A substantial drop in the value of R free validated inclusion of individual atomic temperature factor refinement during the final stages. The program PROCHECK (36Laskowski R.A. Macarthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thorton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; A26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) was used to check the quality of the structure. At the end of the refinement, the crystallographic R-factor was 16.2% andR free was 23.3%. The detailed refinement statistics are shown in Table II.

Open table in a new tab The structural features of SEC3 are very similar to those found in other bacterial SAgs, characterized by two unequal sized domains. The small domain on the right (Fig. 1 A) has the fold of a Greek-key beta barrel capped by an α-helix at one end. This domain has the same topology and fold as the oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide binding (OB) fold (37Murzin A.G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 861-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar) and contains the disulfide loop. The larger domain on the left (Fig. 1 A) is an α/β sandwich or β-grasp motif made up of a five-strand mixed β-sheet wall over which a group of α-helices are laid. A zinc ligation complex was found in the structure of SEC3. This complex is located at the bottom of the cleft between the two domains of SEC3 (Figs. 1 and2). The zinc atom is coordinated by Asp-83 from a β-strand of the small domain and His-118/ His-122, both from the loop connecting the two domains (Figs. 1 and 2). Unlike the SEC3 structure in the P1 space group where a water molecule acts as the fourth ligand (results not shown), the fourth ligand in P4122 space group is provided by Asp-9 from the neighboring molecule, thus forming a dimer (Fig. 2). The zinc sits in the center of these residues ∼0.80 Å above the plane formed by any three liganding atoms. Standard metal-ligand distances taken from the structures refined at high resolution are 2.0–2.3 Å (38Vallee B.L. Auld D.S. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5647-5659Crossref PubMed Scopus (1534) Google Scholar). The distance between the zinc atom in SEC3 and OD1(Asp-83), ND1(His118), NE2(His122), and OD1(Asp9) is 2.17, 2.22, 2.20, and 2.22 Å, respectively, well within these standard distances. The two histidines also adopt different tautomeric conformations in binding the zinc in the toxin structure. His-118 in SEC3 binds to zinc through ND1 (syn) and His-122 through NE2 (anti). The formation of the dimer (Fig. 2) buries 590 Å2 of solvent-accessible surface per monomer, and the noticeable makeup of the dimer interface is the presence of two salt bridges between Lys-37, Lys-56 from one molecule and Asp-10, Glu-16 from a neighboring molecule, respectively. Because no divalent metal ions were added to the crystallization medium, this zinc atom is believed to be intrinsic, and the homodimerization does not appear to be an artifact of the crystal environment. The same zinc-mediated dimerization was observed in the SEC2 crystal structure (14Papageorgiou A.C. Acharya K.R. Shapiro R. Passalacqua E.F. Brehm R.D. Tranter H.S. Structure. 1995; 3: 769-779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) that was grown under different conditions. A similar zinc-induced homodimerization has been also observed in human growth hormone (39Cunningham B.C. Mulkerrin M.G. Wells J.A. Science. 1991; 253: 545-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Native SEC1 and each of the five mutant proteins were assessed for ability to bind zinc using ICP MS as described above. Similar to results reported for SEC2 (14Papageorgiou A.C. Acharya K.R. Shapiro R. Passalacqua E.F. Brehm R.D. Tranter H.S. Structure. 1995; 3: 769-779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) the molar ratio of zinc/SEC1 was less than 1.0. Specifically, a mean molar ratio of 0.42 was obtained from multiple replicate experiments, indicating that less than 50% of the SEC1 molecules contained a bound zinc atom (Fig.3). Analysis of the mutants showed that zinc binding required the presence of all three native residues at positions 83, 118, and 122. The amount of zinc in purified single or double site mutants was dramatically reduced and similar to background levels detected by ICP MS. SEs are able to cause either food poisoning or toxic shock syndrome, depending on the route of exposure to the toxins (1Bohach G.A. Fast D.J Nelson R.D. Schlievert P.M. Crit. Rev. Microbiol. 1990; 17: 251-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Mutants SEC1(D83A), SEC1(H118A), SEC1(H122A), SEC1(D83A/H118A), and SEC1(D83A/H122A) were tested for their ability to induce emesis in monkeys and to assess the potential requirement for zinc in inducing food poisoning. SEC1 or mutants were suspended in 0.9% NaCl and administered into the stomach of young adult pigtail monkeys using standard techniques (see above). Each mutant induced emesis in two animals when administered at a standard screening dose consisting of 10 μg/kg body weight. Demonstration of fever and lethality in a rabbit model is considered an indication of SE potential for inducing TSS (40Schlievert P.M. Infect. Immun. 1982; 36: 123-128Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several doses (0.01–10 μg/kg) of SEC1 toxin or mutant toxins were administered to New Zealand White rabbits via intravenous injection. After 4 h, during which their rectal temperatures were monitored, a sublethal dose (10 μg/kg) of S. typhimurium endotoxin was administered via the intravenous route, and the animals were monitored for 48 h. The results summarized in Fig. 4clearly indicate that zinc binding by the toxin is not required for induction of lethal shock by SEC1 in this assay. SEC1 and most of the mutants were lethal at doses as low as 0.1 μg/kg. One mutant SEC1(D83A) had potency identical to that of native SEC1 in this assay and induced lethality in 100% of the animals at a low dose of 0.1 μg/kg. SEC1(H122A) was slightly less potent than SEC1 in this assay. However, it is unlikely that this reduced toxicity was attributed directly to loss of zinc binding because the SEC1(D83A) mutant had no significant levels of bound zinc but had a toxicity similar to that of the native toxin. None of the mutants were lethal at the lowest dose tested (0.1 μg/kg) and were not statistically different from native SEC1 in this regard (p > 0.9999). Interestingly, alteration of the zinc binding residues dissociated lethality and fever induction. Every mutation generated a protein with a significantly reduced pyrogenic response compared with SEC1, despite having minimal or no effect on lethality. Even SEC1(D83A), which had a lethal potency identical to that of SEC1, induced a dramatically reduced fever response compared with SEC1 at all the doses t"

We found that overproduction ofSDT1 caused hyposensitivity to not only 6-azauracil but also 5-fluorouracil and 5-fluorocytosine.

Nakano A. Nomura K. Sekimizu K. Natori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13200-13204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and MPA, and now a number of transcription elongation-related factors and RNA polymerase II mutants are also known to be 6-AU-hypersensitive (2Brewster N.K. Johnston G.C. Singer R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3491-3502Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 3Costa P.J. Arndt K.M.

Chem. 1996; 271: 6866-6873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In yeast cells, 6-AU is transformed to 6-azaUMP, which inhibits both IMP dehydrogenase and orotidylic acid decarboxylase, key enzymes of the purine and pyrimidine nucleotide synthesis pathways, respectively, thereby lowering intracellular GTP and UTP levels and inhibiting transcription elongation (7Exinger F. Lacroute F. Curr. Genet. 1992; 22: 9-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). MPA specifically inhibits IMP dehydrogenase and lowers the intracellular GTP level (7Exinger F. Lacroute F. Curr. Genet. 1992; 22: 9-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The transcriptional stimulation and arrest relief activity of S-II are necessary to support cell proliferation in the presence of 6-AU (8Nakanishi T. Shimoaraiso M. Kubo T. Natori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8991-8995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). We have identified SDT1 (9Uptain S.M. Kane C.M. Chamberlin M.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 117-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar) (also known as SSM1 (10Shimoaraiso M. Nakanishi T. Kubo T. Natori S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29623-29627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar)) as a multicopy suppressor of the 6-AU hypersensitivity of an S-II null mutant (10Shimoaraiso M. Nakanishi T. Kubo T. Natori S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29623-29627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The SDT1 null mutant is hypersensitive to 6-AU but not to MPA, and SDT1 overexpression confers hyposensitivity to 6-AU but not to MPA (this study and Ref. 10Shimoaraiso M. Nakanishi T. Kubo T. Natori S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29623-29627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Thus, although SDT1 was identified by the screening for a functional substitute for S-II, it can support growth in the absence of S-II only partially if at all. The deduced amino acid sequence of SDT1 has 30–50% identity with S. cerevisiaeYER037w, Schizosaccharomyces pombe SPAC24B11, and a putative sugar starvation-induced protein of Arabidopsis thaliana(GenBankTM accession number AC006223). These genes share a haloacid dehalogenase-like hydrolase consensus sequence, but their biological functions are unknown. To elucidate the mechanism of 6-AU hypersensitivity suppression by SDT1 overexpression, we first tested the drug sensitivity of a SDT1 overproducer. The result suggested that drug resistance by SDT1 overexpression is specific to pyrimidine derivatives. Because SDT1 has a hydrolase consensus sequence, we assumed that SDT1 is a metabolic enzyme of pyrimidines and found that the UMPase activity in a yeast cell extract was proportional to the SDT1 gene dosage. We then expressed recombinant SDT1 protein inEscherichia coli, purified it, and showed that SDT1 protein specifically dephosphorylates 5′-UMP and 5′-CMP. These results suggested that SDT1 detoxifies 6-azaUMP by dephosphorylating it to 6-azauridine in 6-AU-challenged yeast cells, and by this means SDT1 overexpression confers suppression of 6-AU hypersensitivity of S-II null mutant. KpnI-NcoI 1.8-kilobase pair fragment of the SDT1 gene was inserted into the SmaI site of the multicopy shuttle vector pYO323 (11Ohya Y. Goebl M. Goodman L. Petersen-Bjorn S. Friesen J. Tamanoi F. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12356-12360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to obtain the SDT1-overproducing plasmid pH1275. pYO323 and pRS416 (12Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were introduced to BY4742 (Matα his3 leu2 lys2 ura3), which was purchased from Invitrogen, and used as wild type. pH1275 and pRS416 were introduced to BY4742 and used as an SDT1 overproducer. Drug sensitivity was determined by the microbroth dilution method. Approximately 2000 yeast cells/well were inoculated into 200 μl of synthetic medium (0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 2% glucose) containing 100 μg/ml lysine, 250 μg/ml leucine, drugs, and 1% Me2SO in 96-well plates. After 40 h of incubation at 30 °C, cell growth was monitored by measuring the optical density at 595 nm. Nucleotidase/phosphatase activity was determined as described previously (13Widnell C.C. Methods Enzymol. 1973; 32: 368-374Crossref Scopus (84) Google Scholar) with some modifications. The protein sample was incubated in a 0.1 mTris-HCl buffer, pH 8.5, containing 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and substrate nucleotide phosphate in a final volume of 60 μl at 30 °C for 10 min. 150 μl of developer (1.4% ascorbic acid, 0.36% ammonium molybdate, 0.86 n H2SO4) was then added to the reaction mixture and incubated at 45 °C for 20 min. Absorbance at 820 nm was measured, and the amount of released phosphate was calculated. KH2PO4 solution was used as a standard. One unit of UMPase activity is defined as 1 μmol of phosphate released/min from 5′-UMP. TheSDT1 gene was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction and inserted into pET21c(+) (Novagen) to obtain a His tag-fused recombinant protein. The resulting plasmid pH1171 was introduced to BL21-CodonPlus(DE3)-RIL (Stratagene). The transformant was incubated in LB medium, and recombinant SDT1 was induced by 0.4 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at 18 °C for 18 h. E. coli cells were lysed in extraction buffer (0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1 mmUMP, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.8 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 17 mm spermidine, 0.21 mg/ml lysozyme, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate) and then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h to obtain a clear supernatant. Recombinant SDT1 in the resulting cell lysate was adsorbed to a nickel-charged resin (His·Bind Resin, Novagen) and eluted in the elute buffer supplied in the Novagen kit supplemented with 1 mm UMP and 1 mm MgCl2. Imidazole in the adsorbed fraction was removed through a Hi-Prep 26/10 desalting gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) and then loaded onto a nickel-charged HiTrap chelating column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with buffer 1 (0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm UMP). Recombinant SDT1 was eluted by a 50–300 mm imidazole linear gradient in buffer 1. Active fractions were pooled and then concentrated with a Centricon YM-30 (Amicon). Purified recombinant SDT1, bovine serum albumin (molecular weight 67,000), β-lactoglobulin (molecular weight 35,000), and cytochrome c (molecular weight 12,400) were mixed and applied to a Superose 12 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with buffer 2 (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1 mm UMP, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.15 m NaCl). The concentration of SDT1 protein was 1 mg/ml, and the volume of protein mixture was 200 μl. Proteins were eluted in buffer 2, and elution peaks of each protein were plotted. Protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (14Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217450) Google Scholar). Imidazole concentration was determined by absorbance at 320 nm. SDT1 was isolated as a multicopy suppressor of the 6-AU sensitivity of an S-II null mutant (10Shimoaraiso M. Nakanishi T. Kubo T. Natori S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29623-29627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To characterize the suppression, we first tested whether the SDT1 overproducer was resistant to other anti-fungal pyrimidine derivatives. A representative result is shown in Fig.1 and summarized in Table I. The SDT1 overproducer showed hyperresistance to all pyrimidine derivatives tested. The SDT1 overproducer and wild-type cells were equally sensitive to non-pyrimidine drugs such as mycophenolic acid, amphotericin B, and fluconazole. These results suggested that SDT1 confers resistance specifically to pyrimidine derivatives.Table IDrug sensitivity of SDT1 overproducerIC506-AU5-FU5-FCMPAAMPBFCZμg/mlWild type160.204.73.60.5911SDT1 overproducer13001.2122.70.6012 Open table in a new tab Because SDT1 has a haloacid dehalogenase-like hydrolase consensus sequence, we assumed that SDT1 is a metabolic enzyme of pyrimidines. 6-AU is metabolized to 6-azaUMP by FUR1 protein (15Kern L. de Montigny J. Jund R. Lacroute F. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 88: 149-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), which inhibits IMP dehydrogenase and orotidylic acid decarboxylase (7Exinger F. Lacroute F. Curr. Genet. 1992; 22: 9-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Because 6-azauridine has no inhibitory activity to orotidylic acid decarboxylase (16Handschumacher R.E. Pasternak C.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1958; 30: 451-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), the cellular toxicity of 6-azaUMP could be inactivated by dephosphorylation to 6-azauridine. Phosphatases are included among the members of the hydrolase family. Therefore, we prepared cell extracts from the SDT1 overproducer, the SDT1 null mutant, and wild-type yeast cells and measured their UMPase activity. The SDT1 overproducer cell extract contained approximately twice as much UMPase activity as did the wild-type extract, whereas the SDT1 null mutant extract contained less than half of the amount of the wild-type extract (data not shown). Considering that SDT1 is a member of the hydrolase family, this result suggested that SDT1 itself was UMPase. To test whether SDT1 had UMPase activity, we expressed histidine tag-fused recombinant SDT1 in E. coli and purified it to near homogeneity (Fig. 2A). As shown in Fig. 2B, recombinant SDT1 protein and UMPase activity were co-eluted from the nickel-charged HiTrap chelating column by an imidazole linear gradient. This result showed that SDT1 has UMPase activity. As shown in Table II, the recovery of UMPase activity was 21%, and the specific activity increased 14-fold. The apparent Km value and the relative Vmax were determined from the Lineweaver-Burk plots (Fig. 3). The average Km values of two independent experiments for 5′-UMP and 5′-CMP were 1.2 and 2.3 mm, respectively.

As shown in Table III, SDT1 specifically dephosphorylated 5′-UMP and 5′-CMP. Purine nucleotides, 2′(3′)-UMP, deoxyribonucleoside monophosphates, nucleoside diphosphates and triphosphates, orp-nitrophenyl phosphate were dephosphorylated at less than one-tenth efficiency compared with 5′-UMP. This is the first description of a highly specific 5′-pyrimidine nucleotidase in S. cerevisiae. PN-I (pyrimidine 5′-nucleotidase type I) purified from human erythrocytes is the sole example of a pyrimidine-specific nucleotidase so far (17Amici A. Emanuelli M. Raffaelli N. Ruggieri S. Magni G. Nucleosides Nucleotides. 1999; 18: 853-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). PN-I dephosphorylates deoxyribonucleotide monophosphate, which is not dephosphorylated by SDT1. The other known 5′-nucleotidases have broader specificity and dephosphorylate both pyrimidine and purine nucleotides (18Hunsucker S.A. Spychala J. Mitchell B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10498-10504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 19Zimmermann H. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 345-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar). SDT1 shares no sequence similarity with the other nucleotidases reported. A BLAST search of the GenBankTM data base provided no nucleotidase as a similar protein. These results suggested that SDT1 is the sole known member of a novel nucleotidase family.Table IIISubstrate specificity of phosphatase activity of recombinant SDT1NucleotideRelative activity (5′-UMP = 100)NucleotideRelative activity (5′-UMP = 100)5′-UMP1005′-UTP5.05′-CMP875′-CTP7.65′-TMP0.835′-ATP4.95′-AMP0.335′-GTP105′-GMP0.155′-dUMP0.745′-IMP0.225′-dCMP0.232′(3′)-UMP0.085′-dAMP0.02′(3′)-AMP0.015′-dGMP0.175′-UDP115′-OMP5.35′-ADP1.3PNPP0.0 Open table in a new tab Several nucleotidases form oligomers (19Zimmermann H. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 345-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar). To see whether the SDT1 protein formed an oligomer, purified SDT1 was loaded onto a Superose 12 gel filtration column with molecular weight marker proteins. SDT1 was eluted just after β-macroglobulin (molecular weight 35,000), and its estimated native molecular weight was 33,000 (Fig. 4). Because the deduced molecular weight of SDT1 was 32,000, the result showed that SDT1 existed as a monomer in the solution. SDT1 was isolated as a multicopy suppressor of 6-AU sensitivity in an S-II null mutant (10Shimoaraiso M. Nakanishi T. Kubo T. Natori S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29623-29627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The SDT1 null mutant is 6-AU-sensitive, and SDT1 expression is regulated by S-II at the transcription level (10Shimoaraiso M. Nakanishi T. Kubo T. Natori S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29623-29627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To elucidate the 6-AU sensitivity suppression mechanism by SDT1, we first tested whether SDT1 overexpression caused multidrug resistance or whether its effect was limited to pyrimidine derivatives. Because the latter situation was the case as summarized in Table I and SDT1 has a hydrolase consensus sequence, we assumed that SDT1 might be a pyrimidine-metabolizing enzyme. We then found that there was a correlation between the SDT1 gene dosage and UMPase activity in a yeast cell extract. We next purified recombinant SDT1 from E. coli and showed that SDT1 was a 5′-UMP-specific and 5′-CMP-specific nucleotidase (Figs. 2 and 3 and Table III). SDT1 existed as a monomer (Fig. 4), whereas several nucleotidases existed as oligomers (19Zimmermann H. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 345-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar). Because 6-azaUMP is thought to be an active metabolite of 6-AU, these results suggested that SDT1 detoxifies 6-azaUMP by dephosphorylating it to 6-azauridine in 6-AU-challenged yeast cells, and therefore SDT1 overexpression suppresses 6-AU hypersensitivity. The reported cellular functions of nucleotidases are nucleotide level regulation, uridine formation for intercellular transport, and phosphate source generation (19Zimmermann H. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 345-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar). We propose here that nucleotidases can be scavengers of “ill-modified” nucleotide phosphates and be induced to destroy them. This idea is consistent with the report that SDT1 is induced in the presence of 6-AU or the DNA-alkylating agent methyl methanesulfonate (20Jelinsky S.A. Samson L.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1486-1491Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar) and is dispensable in general growth conditions. SDT1 may have higher affinity to such ill-modified nucleotide phosphates. Transcription elongation factor S-II up-regulates SDT1 expression (10Shimoaraiso M. Nakanishi T. Kubo T. Natori S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29623-29627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Both SDT1 null and S-II null mutants are 6-AU-sensitive, and SDT1 overexpression suppresses 6-AU sensitivity. Because S-II overexpression cannot suppress the 6-AU sensitivity of the SDT1 null mutant, SDT1 seems to function downstream of S-II in the suppression of 6-AU sensitivity. Hypersensitivity to 6-AU of other transcription elongation factors may be because of the failure of SDT1 up-regulation as well. Probably, S-II suppresses 6-AU sensitivity by up-regulating SDT1 and IMD2 to detoxify 6-AU and to increase the GTP level (21Shaw R.J. Reines D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7427-7437Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), respectively, and by stimulating transcription elongation of the genes whose transcriptions are arrested because of nucleoside triphosphate shortage. Moreover, the shortages of nucleoside triphosphate would cause nucleotide misincorporation to messenger RNA, and it may be one of the mechanisms whereby 6-AU stops yeast cell proliferation. S-II can help to proofread nucleotide misincorporation (22Thomas M.J. Platas A.A. Hawley D.K. Cell. 1998; 93: 627-637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). S-II seems to play key roles to support yeast cell growth very efficiently under low level nucleotide conditions by stimulating transcription elongation, proofreading, and induction of enzymes such as drug-metabolizing SDT1 and nucleotide-synthesizing IMD2. This paper suggests that UMP/CMPase SDT1 is involved in pyrimidine-derived anti-fungal drug resistance of yeast. It is possible that some of the pyrimidine-derived anti-fungal drug (e.g.5-fluorocytosine)-resistant fungi overproduce SDT1. It is also possible that there are pyrimidine nucleotidase-overproducing cancer cells in pyrimidine derivative (e.g. 5-fluorouracil)-resistant cancer. If this turns out to be the case, the SDT1 overproducer and recombinant SDT1 protein can be used to develop pyrimidine-nucleotidase-resistant anti-fungal or anti-cancer drugs. We thank Drs. S. Natori and M. Nakanishi- Matsui for critical reading of this paper, and Drs. N. Akimitsu, T. Ito, A. Kitamura, N. Adachi, and T. Ubukata for helpful discussion."

However, in vivo, the enzymes are extremely specific for their respective physiological substrates. Both TPL and Trpase react with substrates and inhibitors to form equilibrating mixtures of external aldimine and quinonoid complexes (5Faleev N. Ruvinov S.B. Demidkina T.V. Myagkikh I.V.

We have previously reported the x-ray crystallographic structure of TPL complexed with the substrate analog 3-(4′-hydroxyphenyl)propionic acid (15Sundararaju B. Antson A.A. Phillips R.S.

This complex resembles the Michaelis-Menten complex, because the analog lacks an amino group and is unable to form an external aldimine. We would like to obtain structures of quinonoid intermediates for both enzymes, because quinonoid intermediates are proposed to play a central role in the mechanisms of both enzymes (Scheme FS3). In previous studies with Trpase and tryptophan synthase (16Phillips R.S. Miles E.W. Cohen L.A. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 6228-6234Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 17Phillips R.S. Miles E.W. Cohen L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14665-14670Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we prepared inhibitors oxindolyl-l-alanine (SchemeFS4, I) and dihydro-l-tryptophan, which resemble the indolenine intermediate (Scheme FS3), a proposed intermediate in the reactions of both enzymes. Trpase and tryptophan synthase are inhibited by different diastereomers of dihydro-l-tryptophan, suggesting that the indolenine intermediates in the reactions of the two enzymes exhibit opposite chirality (17Phillips R.S. Miles E.W. Cohen L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14665-14670Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Oxindolyl-l-alanine was found previously to inhibit Escherichia coli Trpase with a Ki value of ∼2.5–6 μm (3Kiick D.M. Phillips R.S.

Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8608-8614Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and to form a prominent absorption band at 502 nm, demonstrating the predominant formation of a stable quinonoid intermediate. The Y71F mutant TPL was found to be inactive for the elimination of l-Tyr, but it binds l-Tyr andl-Phe tightly and forms stable quinonoid complexes with very strong absorption peaks at 502 nm (10Chen H. Demidkina T.V. Phillips R.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12276-12283Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Presently, there is only one structure reported of a quinonoid intermediate of a PLP-dependent enzyme (19Szebenyi D.M. Liu X. Kriksunov I.A. Stover P.J. Thiel D.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13313-13323Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), indicating difficulties in the isolation and predominant accumulation of this species. This is at least partly because of quinonoid intermediate instability as a result of high reactivity and photosensitivity (20Mozzarelli A. Peracchi A. Rovegno B. Dale G. Rossi G.L. Dunn M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6956-6962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). By exploiting the capability of single crystal-polarized absorption microspectrophotometry in the characterization of enzyme reactivity in the crystalline state (21Mozzarelli A. Rossi G.L. Annu. Rev.

We found that stable quinonoid intermediates can be formed by soaking crystals ofProteus vulgaris Trpase with oxindolyl-l-alanine and the wild-type and Y71F mutant of Citrobacter freundiiTPL with 3-fluoro-l-tyrosine (Scheme FS4, II),l-Met, and l-Phe. These results provide a background for the future determination of the structures of these quinonoid intermediates by x-ray crystallography.SCHEME 2Reaction of Trpase.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)SCHEME 3Mechanism of Trpase and TPL.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)SCHEME 4Structures of oxindolyl-l-alanine (I) and 3-F-Tyr (II).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)DISCUSSIONThe reaction mechanisms proposed for TPL and Trpase are very similar as shown in Scheme FS3. Both enzymes initially form an external aldimine structure with an absorption peak at 420–425 nm upon reaction with the substrate. The external aldimines are then deprotonated on the α-carbon to form quinonoid intermediates, which exhibit absorption maxima at ∼500–505 nm. The elimination of the aromatic leaving group takes place concomitant with or after tautomerization of the initial quinonoid intermediate (31Phillips R.S. Sundararju B. Faleev N.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 1008-1114Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The strict reaction specificity of these enzymes has been proposed to be controlled by the position of a second catalytically essential base (shown asB2 in Scheme FS3) in the substrate binding site, which controls the tautomerization (3Kiick D.M. Phillips R.S. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 7333-7338Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 4Kiick D.M. Phillips R.S. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 7339-7344Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 5Faleev N. Ruvinov S.B. Demidkina T.V. Myagkikh I.V. Gololobov M.Y. Bakhmutov V.I. Belikov V.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 177: 395-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Structural studies and kinetic analyses of R381A, R381I, and R381V TPL previously demonstrated that Arg-381 is required for the tyrosine substrate specificity of TPL (15Sundararaju B. Antson A.A. Phillips R.S. Demidkina T.V. Barbolina M.V. Gollnick P. Guy Dodson G.G. Wilson K.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6502-6510Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and thus it may be the proposed catalytic base. Recent studies ofE. coli H463F Trpase suggest that His-463 is important in Trp specificity; hence it might be the proposed catalytic base either directly or through a hydrogen-bonded network with other residues and/or active site water (33Phillips R.S. Johnson N. Kamath A.V. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4348-4357Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Both TPL and Trpase have an active site Tyr residue, which is essential for the elimination of the physiological substrates and which may serve as a general acid to transfer a proton to the leaving group (10Chen H. Demidkina T.V. Phillips R.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12276-12283Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 33Phillips R.S. Johnson N. Kamath A.V. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4348-4357Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Thus, to understand the molecular basis of the reaction specificity of these enzymes, it is critical to obtain three-dimensional structures of the quinonoid intermediates by x-ray crystallography.We found that oxindolyl-l-alanine (Scheme FS4, I), a potent inhibitor of Trpase, binds to P. vulgaris Trpase crystals and forms a quinonoid spectrum very similar to that seen in solution (Fig. 1). The spectral intensity remains constant for long periods, indicating that the quinonoid species is fairly stable. Furthermore, the crystals do not show any evidence of cracking. Therefore, the structural change responsible for the formation of the external aldimine and quinonoid intermediates is evidently not large enough to disrupt the crystal packing. A spectroscopic parameter particularly sensitive to crystal integrity is the polarization ratio (i.e. the ratio of absorbance at each wavelength along perpendicular directions of polarization). This parameter is related to the projection of the electronic transition dipole moments of the chromophore along the direction of the electric vectors of the linearly polarized light. A value of the polarization ratio close to unity indicates either an equal projection or a disordered crystal. For Trpase as well as TPL crystals, the internal aldimine exhibits values of polarization ratio slightly higher than unity, whereas external aldimine and quinonoid species exhibit values significantly higher and lower than unity (Table I). The binding of oxindolyl-l-alanine to the crystals is somewhat weaker (10-fold) than in solution (Table II). Slightly higher dissociation constants have been usually observed in protein crystals (21Mozzarelli A. Rossi G.L. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1996; 25: 343-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 23Mozzarelli A. Peracchi A. Rossi G.L. Ahmed A. Miles E. J. Biol.

Biol. 1998; 283: 135-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), probably because of constraints caused by lattice forces on protein flexibility. The case of the reaction ofO-acetyl-l-Ser sulfhydrylase crystals withO-acetyl-l-Ser to form an aminoacrylate species is a clear example of the extreme dependence of ligand binding on lattice effects (24Mozzarelli A. Bettati S. Pucci A.M. Burkhard P. Cook P.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 283: 135-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Three distinctO-acetyl-l-Ser sulfhydrylase crystal forms were grown under very similar experimental conditions. One form exhibits a dissociation constant that is ∼500-fold higher than in solution. A second form is almost unable to bindO-acetyl-l-Ser, whereas the third form binds the substrate with a concomitant crystal breakage. These findings suggest that binding and catalysis are associated to ligand-induced conformational changes, some of which are hindered by lattice forces.The reactivity of Trpase crystals toward l-Trp results in a steady-state mixture of external aldimine and quinonoid intermediates similar to that seen in solution (Fig. 2), and the addition of benzimidazole results in only a small decrease in the 505-nm absorbance. This finding is in contrast to solution in which benzimidazole causes the 505-nm band to decrease dramatically and form an α-aminoacrylate intermediate (13Sloan M.J. Phillips R.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16165-16173Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 14Phillips R.S. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5927-5934Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). This finding suggests that a conformational change associated with the aminoacrylate intermediate formation might be prevented by lattice forces. This conclusion is supported by the reactivity of l-Ser to Trpase crystals, showing the disappearance of the 420-nm peak with the concomitant formation of a 340-nm intermediate (Fig. 2). This intermediate could be either an α-aminoacrylate or gem-diamine structure. The addition of indole plus l-Ser did not result in much change in the 340-nm peak, suggesting that it is agem-diamine rather than an α-aminoacrylate structure. Thus, although the Trpase crystals seem to behave normally with respect to the formation of aldimine and quinonoid intermediates, they do not appear to readily form α-aminoacrylate intermediates. This finding suggests that there is a larger conformational change in the formation of the α-aminoacrylate intermediate than for the external aldimine and quinonoid intermediates. The data on the formation of the aminoacrylate intermediate in O-acetyl-l-Ser sulfhydrylase crystals as described above lead to a similar conclusion (21Mozzarelli A. Rossi G.L. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1996; 25: 343-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar).An intriguing finding is the different polarization ratios observed for the quinonoid intermediates formed upon reaction with OIA and withl-Trp or l-Ser (Table I). According to Vincentet al. (34Vincent M.G. Picot D. Eichele G. Jansonius J.N. Evangelopolous A.E. Chemical and Biological Aspects of Vitamin B6 Catalysis. Alan R. Liss, New York1984: 233-243Google Scholar), the direction of the transition dipole moments of quinonoid structures is rotated ∼45° clockwise with respect to the those of the internal and external aldimine. The observation that for the OIA-quinonoid complex, the polarization ratio is ∼3.5 and for the l-Trp and l-Ser-quinonoid complexes, the polarization ratio is ∼0.3 suggests that the PLP ring might have different orientations in distinct quinonoid species. Either crystallographic studies or spectra along the third direction of the crystal should allow solution of the uncertainty between ring rotation and distinct directions of transition dipole moments. Unfortunately, the crystal morphology prevented the collection of spectra in the third direction. Because oxindolyl-l-alanine is a potent transition-state analog inhibitor (3Kiick D.M. Phillips R.S. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 7333-7338Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 16Phillips R.S. Miles E.W. Cohen L.A. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 6228-6234Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 18Phillips R.S. Bender S.L. Brzovic P. Dunn M.F. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8608-8614Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), it is not unexpected that its quinonoid structure has a different conformation than the ground-state quinonoid complex of l-Trp orl-Ser. It is also interesting that the Trpase as isolated exhibits a low intensity quinonoid peak at 490 nm, which shows strong polarization (Fig. 1a). Torchinsky and co-workers (35Zakomirdina L.N. Sakharova I.S. Torchinsky Y.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 193: 243-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) observed a similar peak in native E. coli Trpase, which shows weak absorption but exhibits intense linear dichroism. This band was removed by the formation of the apoenzyme and reconstitution with PLP, so the absorption may be due to a ligand found in cell extracts that remains tightly bound through the isolation (35Zakomirdina L.N. Sakharova I.S. Torchinsky Y.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 193: 243-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar).An addition of either l-Phe or l-Met to crystals of wild-type TPL results in equilibrium mixtures of external aldimine and quinonoid intermediates (Fig. 3), similar to those seen previously in solution (5Faleev N. Ruvinov S.B. Demidkina T.V. Myagkikh I.V. Gololobov M.Y. Bakhmutov V.I. Belikov V.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 177: 395-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 10Chen H. Demidkina T.V.

The Kd of these amino acids is similar to that in solution (Table II) (5Faleev N. Ruvinov S.B. Demidkina T.V. Myagkikh I.V. Gololobov M.Y. Bakhmutov V.I. Belikov V.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 177: 395-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Y71F TPL has no detectable activity for the elimination of l-Tyr, but it forms quasi-stable quinonoid complexes with intense absorption peaks at 502 nm in the presence of l-Phe, l-Tyr, and 3-F-l-Tyr (10Chen H. Demidkina T.V. Phillips R.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12276-12283Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Soaking Y71F TPL crystals with 3-F-l-Tyr results in a similar intense absorption peak at 502 nm (Fig. 3, c and d). 3-F-l-Tyr was used in the titration experiments, because it has similar kinetic properties to l-Tyr with TPL (27Chen H. Gollnick P. Phillips R.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 540-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar); however, 3-F-l-Tyr has significantly higher solubility (>20 mm) in aqueous buffer solutions than l-Tyr (∼4 mm). The binding constant for 3-F-l-Tyr of 1 mm for the crystalline enzyme is ∼10-fold higher than that observed in solution for l-Tyr (Table II) (10Chen H. Demidkina T.V. Phillips R.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12276-12283Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). These results demonstrate that wild type and Y71F TPL crystals can readily form quinonoid complexes, once again suggesting that the conformational changes to form quinonoid structures do not disrupt the crystal packing of the enzyme. It should be noted that the polarization ratios for these spectra are close to those observed for thel-Trp and l-Ser quinonoid complexes of Trpase.The observation that the crystals of Trpase and Y71F TPL can form stable complexes simply by soaking with oxindolyl-l-alanine and 3-F-l-Tyr, respectively, which are mostly if not exclusively composed of quinonoid species, will facilitate the future determination of the structures of these complexes by x-ray crystallography. Although quinonoid intermediates are central to the proposed mechanisms of Trpase, TPL and many other PLP-dependent enzymes, they are frequently unstable and do not accumulate in large quantity in the crystalline state. Indeed, only one structure has been reported for a quinonoid intermediate in a PLP-dependent enzyme to date (19Szebenyi D.M. Liu X. Kriksunov I.A. Stover P.J. Thiel D.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13313-13323Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), and the structure of the quinonoid complex formed in the reaction of indoline andl-Ser catalyzed by tryptophan synthase is in progress. 4I. Schlichting, personal communication. Tyrosine phenol-lyase (TPL)1 (EC 4.1.99.2) and tryptophan indole-lyase (Trpase, EC 4.1.99.1) are pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzymes that catalyze β-elimination reactions to form phenol or indole and ammonium pyruvate from tyrosine and tryptophan, respectively (SchemesFS1 and FS2) (1Antson A.A.

However, in vivo, the enzymes are extremely specific for their respective physiological substrates. Both TPL and Trpase react with substrates and inhibitors to form equilibrating mixtures of external aldimine and quinonoid complexes (5Faleev N. Ruvinov S.B. Demidkina T.V. Myagkikh I.V.

https://openalex.org/W2149022242,"Retinoids are therapeutically effective in the treatment of various cancers, and some of the therapeutic action of retinoids can be ascribed to their potent inhibition of AP-1 activity that regulates transcription of genes associated with cell growth. We recently reported that the expression of orphan receptor chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter-transcription factor (COUP-TF) plays a role in mediating the growth inhibitory effect of trans-retinoic acid (trans-RA) in cancer cells. To gain insight into the molecular mechanism by which COUP-TF regulates trans-RA activity, we evaluated the effect of COUP-TF on antagonism of AP-1 activity by trans-RA. Our results demonstrated a positive correlation between COUP-TF expression and the ability oftrans-RA to inhibit AP-1 activity in various cancer cell lines. In transient transfection assay, expression of COUP-TF strongly inhibited tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-induced AP-1 transactivation activity and transactivation of c-Jun/c-Fos in both atrans-RA-dependent and –independent manner.In vitro studies demonstrated that the addition of COUP-TF inhibited c-Jun DNA binding through a direct protein-protein interaction that is mediated by the DNA binding domain of COUP-TF and the leucine zipper of c-Jun. Stable expression of COUP-TF in COUP-TF-negative MDA-MB231 breast cancer cells restored the ability oftrans-RA to inhibit 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-induced c-Jun expression. The effect of COUP-TF in enhancing thetrans-RA-induced antagonism of AP-1 activity required expression of retinoic acid receptors (RARs), since stable expression of COUP-TF in COUP-TF-negative HT-1376 bladder cancer cells, which do not express RARα and RARβ, failed to restoretrans-RA-induced AP-1 repression. Thus, COUP-TF, through its physical interaction with AP-1, promotes anticancer effects of retinoids by potentiating their anti-AP-1 activity.

The effects of retinoids are mainly mediated by two nuclear receptor classes, the retinoic acid receptor (RAR)1 and retinoid X receptor (RXR) (3Mangelsdorf D.J. Evans R.M.

Both are encoded by three different genes (α, β, and γ) and function as ligand-inducible transcription factorsin vivo mainly as RXR/RAR heterodimers.trans-Retinoic acid (trans-RA) binds RARs, whereas 9-cis-RA binds both RARs and RXRs. Binding of retinoids to their receptors induces receptor conformational changes that switch on transcription of genes containing RA response elements (RAREs) (3Mangelsdorf D.J. Evans R.M.

In addition to their positive regulation of RARE-containing genes, retinoid receptors, in response to their ligands, can inhibit effects induced by the tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) and the transcriptional activity of the proto-oncogenes c-Jun and c-Fos (6Pfahl M. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar), which are components of the AP-1 complex, which often has a role in cancer cell proliferation (7Angel P. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 129-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (3279) Google Scholar). The activation of AP-1-responsive genes by TPA or c-Jun/c-Fos through TPA response elements (TREs) is repressed by retinoid receptors in a ligand-dependent manner (8Yang-Yen H.F. Zhang X.K. Graupner G. Tzukerman M. Sakamoto B. Karin M. Pfahl M. New. Biol. 1991; 3: 1206-1219PubMed Google Scholar, 9Schule R. Rangarajan P. Yang N. Kliewer S. Ransone L.J. Bolado J. Verma I.M. Evans R.M.

EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4443-4454Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Conversely, AP-1 represses transactivation of retinoid receptors (8Yang-Yen H.F. Zhang X.K. Graupner G. Tzukerman M.

Rev. 1993; 14: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). For example, overexpression of c-Jun conferred retinoid resistance to breast cancer cells (11Yang L. Kim H.T. Munoz-Medellin D. Reddy P. Brown P.H.

Retinyl methyl ether, which effectively prevents mammary cancer in animals, strongly suppressed AP-1 activity in breast cancer cell (22Agadir A. Shealy Y.F. Hill D.L. Zhang X. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3444-3450PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, RARβ, a negative regulator of cancer cell growth (23Zhang X.K. Liu Y. Lee M.O. Mutat.

Zhang X. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3271-3280PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies demonstrate that retinoids that specifically inhibit AP-1 activity but antagonize RAR transactivation on RAREs inhibited the growth of many different types of cancer cells (25Fanjul A.

Thus, anti-AP-1 activity of retinoids contributes to their chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic effects, presumably by blocking the processes of tumor promotion and cell transformation. The mechanism by which retinoids inhibit AP-1 activity remains largely unclear. Unlike the effect of retinoid receptors on RAREs, inhibition of AP-1 activity by retinoid receptors is independent of retinoid receptor-RARE interaction (8Yang-Yen H.F. Zhang X.K. Graupner G. Tzukerman M. Sakamoto B. Karin M. Pfahl M. New. Biol. 1991; 3: 1206-1219PubMed Google Scholar, 9Schule R. Rangarajan P. Yang N. Kliewer S. Ransone L.J. Bolado J. Verma I.M. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl.

EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4443-4454Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Previous studies suggested several possible mechanisms for AP-1 inhibition by retinoid receptors. First, retinoid receptors are reported to physically interact with c-Jun and/or c-Fos (8Yang-Yen H.F. Zhang X.K. Graupner G. Tzukerman M. Sakamoto B. Karin M. Pfahl M. New. Biol. 1991; 3: 1206-1219PubMed Google Scholar, 9Schule R. Rangarajan P. Yang N. Kliewer S. Ransone L.J. Bolado J. Verma I.M. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6092-6096Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). This interaction results in the mutual inhibition of their DNA binding and transactivation functions and could explain the cross-talk occurring between AP-1 and retinoid signaling. However, a large excess of either retinoid receptor protein or c-Jun and c-Fos proteins was required to inhibit in vitro binding to the TRE or RARE, respectively (8Yang-Yen H.F. Zhang X.K. Graupner G. Tzukerman M. Sakamoto B. Karin M. Pfahl M. New. Biol. 1991; 3: 1206-1219PubMed Google Scholar, 9Schule R. Rangarajan P. Yang N. Kliewer S. Ransone L.J. Bolado J. Verma I.M. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6092-6096Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). Because the in vivo footprint assay for glucocorticoid receptor and AP-1 interaction did not reveal any effect on DNA binding (30Konig H. Ponta H. Rahmsdorf H.J. Herrlich P. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2241-2246Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), whether RAR and AP-1 directly interactin vivo remains to be established. Subsequently, it was suggested that blocking activation of the Jun N-terminal kinase signaling pathway that activates AP-1 might be responsible for AP-1 inhibition by retinoid and other nuclear receptors (31Caelles C. Gonzalez-Sancho J.M. Munoz A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3351-3364Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Although this mechanism may explain how retinoids inhibit AP-1 activity under some conditions, it does not address how mutual inhibition occurs. Recent results suggest that the molecular basis of receptor-mediated inhibition of AP-1 transcriptional activation might be due to competition for a common coactivator, such as the cAMP-response element-binding protein (CBP), which is required for transcriptional activation by both the AP-1 complex and RARs (32Kamei Y., Xu, L. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Kurokawa R. Gloss B. Lin S.C. Heyman R.A. Rose D.W. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 1996; 85: 403-414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1928) Google Scholar). However, a domain of RAR capable of inhibiting AP-1 activity, such as the DNA-binding domain (33DiSepio D. Sutter M. Johnson A.T. Chandraratna R.A. Nagpal S. Mol. Cell. Biol. Res. Commun. 1999; 1: 7-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), does not interact with CBP (32Kamei Y., Xu, L. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Kurokawa R. Gloss B. Lin S.C. Heyman R.A. Rose D.W. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 1996; 85: 403-414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1928) Google Scholar). The development of retinoids that specifically inhibit AP-1 activity without transactivating RARs (25Fanjul A. Dawson M.I. Hobbs P.D. Jong L. Cameron J.F. Harlev E. Graupner G., Lu, X.P. Pfahl M. Nature. 1994; 372: 107-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 26Chen J.Y. Penco S. Ostrowski J. Balaguer P. Pons M. Starrett J.E. Reczek P. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1187-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) also argues against the involvement of RAR coactivators in RARs-AP-1 cross-talk. Thus, the availability of CBP is unlikely to be the sole modulator of RAR and AP-1-signaling pathways, and other adapter proteins may be involved in the antagonism of AP-1 activity by RARs. Recent studies demonstrate that orphan receptor COUP-TF is involved in regulation retinoid responses (34Wu Q., Li, Y. Liu R. Agadir A. Lee M.O. Liu Y. Zhang X. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1656-1669Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 35Lin B. Chen G.Q. Xiao D. Kolluri S.K. Cao X., Su, H. Zhang X.K. Mol. Cell.

Pereira F.A. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1996; 56: 81-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). COUP-TF can modulate retinoid responses through either its high affinity binding to various RAREs or its heterodimerization with RXR (40Tran P. Zhang X.K. Salbert G. Hermann T. Lehmann J.M. Pfahl M.

We previously reported that COUP-TF expression was required for cancer cell growth inhibition by trans-RA (35Lin B. Chen G.Q. Xiao D. Kolluri S.K. Cao X., Su, H. Zhang X.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 957-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). We further demonstrated that the effect of COUP-TF is partly due to its induction of RARβ that mediates growth inhibition by retinoids in various cancer cells (35Lin B. Chen G.Q. Xiao D. Kolluri S.K. Cao X., Su, H. Zhang X.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 957-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). To further understand how COUP-TF is involved in the regulation oftrans-RA activity in cancer cells, we investigated the effect of COUP-TF on antagonism of AP-1 activity bytrans-RA. Our data demonstrate that COUP-TF expression in various cancer cell lines correlated with the ability oftrans-RA to suppress AP-1 transcriptional activity. In addition, we found that COUP-TF effectively suppressed AP-1 transcriptional activity by interacting with c-Jun to cause loss of c-Jun DNA binding. This interaction required COUP-TF DNA-binding domain and the c-Jun leucine-zipper domain. Although AP-1 inhibition by COUP-TF did not require trans-RA, COUP-TF strongly potentiated the AP-1 antagonism by trans-RA when RARs were expressed. Our results demonstrate that interaction between COUP-TF and AP-1 is involved in regulating anti-AP-1 activity of retinoids in cancer cells and suggest that COUP-TF plays a role in the cross-talk between retinoid and AP-1 signalings.

Chen G.Q. Xiao D. Kolluri S.K. Cao X., Su, H. Zhang X.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 957-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). pcDNA3-COUP-TFII N-terminal deletion mutants were constructed by cloning PCR products from COUP-TFII into pcDNA3 (Stratagene) using the following forward primers: TATAGGTACCATGGCGCCGCCCGTGCCC for pcDNA3-COUP-TFIIΔN25; ATATGGTACCATGACGCCAGCCCAGACG for pcDNA3-COUP-TFIIΔN50; AATTGGTACCATGCACATCGAGTGCGTG for pcDNA3-COUP-TFIIΔN75; and ATTAGGTACCATGCACCATCGCAACCAG for pcDNA3COUPTFIIΔN125. The oligonucleotide GTGGCAGTTGAGGGGATCC was used as the reverse primer for these mutants. HeLa cells (1 × 105 cells/well) were plated in 24-well plates for 16–24 h before transfection as described (34Wu Q., Li, Y. Liu R. Agadir A. Lee M.O. Liu Y. Zhang X.

A modified calcium phosphate precipitation procedure was used for transient transfections (34Wu Q., Li, Y. Liu R. Agadir A. Lee M.O. Liu Y. Zhang X. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1656-1669Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 35Lin B. Chen G.Q. Xiao D. Kolluri S.K. Cao X., Su, H. Zhang X.K. Mol. Cell.

Briefly, 200 ng of reporter plasmid, 100 ng of β-galactosidase of expression vector (pCH 110;Amersham Biosciences), and various amounts of each expression vector were mixed with carrier DNA (pBluescript) to give 1000 ng of total DNA/well. CAT activity was normalized for transfection efficiency to the responding β-Gal activity. For stable transfections, the pRC/CMV-COUP-TF recombinant was transfected into MDA-MB231 and HT-1376 cells by the calcium phosphate precipitation method, and the stable clones were screened with G418 (Invitrogen) as described (35Lin B. Chen G.Q. Xiao D. Kolluri S.K. Cao X., Su, H. Zhang X.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 957-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Integration and expression of transfected cDNA were determined by Southern blotting and Northern blotting, respectively. Receptor proteins for RARα, TR3, COUP-TF, and its mutants were synthesized byin vitro transcription-translation using rabbit reticulocyte lysates (Promega) as described previously (34Wu Q., Li, Y. Liu R. Agadir A. Lee M.O. Liu Y. Zhang X. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1656-1669Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Amounts of translated proteins were determined by [35S]methionine incorporation and SDS-PAGE with quantitation by incorporated radioactivity after normalization relative to methionine content. A fragment of the collagenase promoter region −73 to +63 containing one AP-1-binding site (TRE) was excised from a collagenase-CAT construct (8Yang-Yen H.F. Zhang X.K. Graupner G. Tzukerman M. Sakamoto B. Karin M. Pfahl M. New. Biol. 1991; 3: 1206-1219PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the AP-1 binding sequence 5′-GATCCGGATGAGTCACCA-3′ was synthesized. Two fragments were labeled with [32P]dCTP for use as probes for protein-DNA interaction. In vitro translated protein was incubated with the probe in a 20-μl reaction mixture containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 50 mm KCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, and 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) at 25 °C for 15 min. DNA-protein complexes were resolved on 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels, and then gels were dried and analyzed by autoradiography. To prepare glutathioneS-transferase (GST)–c-Jun or GST-c-Jun mutant fusion proteins, each c-Jun DNA or c-Jun mutant fragment was cloned in frame into the expression vector pGEX-3X (Amersham Biosciences). Fusion proteins were expressed in bacteria using the manufacturer's procedure and analyzed by gel retardation assays and Western blotting (data not shown). To determine the interaction between COUP-TF and c-Jun, the fusion proteins were immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads. The vector protein (GST), prepared under the same conditions as a control, was also immobilized. Beads were preincubated with bovine serum albumin (1 mg/ml) at room temperature for 5 min. 35S-labeledin vitro translated COUP-TF proteins (2–5 μl, depending on translation efficiency) were then added to the beads. The beads in 200 μl in EBC buffer (140 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 100 mm NaF, 200 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0) were rocked continuously for 1 h at 4 °C. After washing 5 times with NETN buffer (100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.5% Nonidet P-40), bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. For Northern analysis, total RNAs were prepared using an RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Total RNA (30 μg) from different cell lines treated with or withouttrans-RA (10−6 M) in the presence or absence of TPA (100 ng/ml) was analyzed by Northern blotting as described (46Li Y. Lin B. Agadir A. Liu R. Dawson M.I. Reed J.C. Fontana J.A. Bost F. Hobbs P.D. Zheng Y. Chen G.Q. Shroot B. Mercola D. Zhang X.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4719-4731Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). We recently reported that expression of COUP-TF is required for growth inhibition and apoptosis induction bytrans-RA in various cancer cells (35Lin B. Chen G.Q. Xiao D. Kolluri S.K. Cao X., Su, H. Zhang X.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 957-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Since inhibition of AP-1 activity by retinoids is known to contribute to their anticancer effects, we studied whether COUP-TF expression was involved in the process. The effect of trans-RA on inhibiting AP-1 activity (Fig. 1A) was evaluated in COUP-TF–positive T-47D and ZR-75–1 breast cancer and Calu-6 lung cancer cell lines and in COUP-TF–negative MDA-MB231 breast cancer, H292 lung cancer, and HT-1376 bladder cancer cell lines (35Lin B. Chen G.Q. Xiao D. Kolluri S.K. Cao X., Su, H. Zhang X.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 957-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). AP-1 activity induced by TPA was determined by transient transfection using the reporter −73Col-CAT, which contains a TRE that binds AP-1 (8Yang-Yen H.F. Zhang X.K. Graupner G. Tzukerman M. Sakamoto B. Karin M. Pfahl M. New. Biol. 1991; 3: 1206-1219PubMed Google Scholar). TPA-induced reporter activity was strongly inhibited in atrans-RA-dependent manner in the COUP-TF–positive ZR-75-1, T-47D, and Calu–6 cell lines. In contrast, trans-RA showed very little effect on TPA–induced −73Col-CAT activity in the COUP-TF–negative MDA-MB231, H292, and HT-1376 cell lines. Thus, COUP-TF expression correlates positively with the ability of trans-RA to inhibit AP-1 transcriptional activity. The positive association between COUP-TF expression and trans-RA-induced anti-AP-1 activity suggested that COUP-TF was required for trans-RA to inhibit AP-1 activity and that the absence of COUP-TF expression in MDA-MB231, H292, and HT-1376 cells might be responsible for the lack oftrans-RA activity. Therefore, we transiently transfected the COUP-TF expression vector and the −73Col-CAT reporter into the COUP-TF-negative cell lines, in which trans-RA did not inhibit AP-1 transcriptional activity (Fig. 1B). Upon COUP-TF transfection, trans-RA inhibited TPA-induced reporter activity in both MDA-MB231 and H292 cells in a COUP-TF concentration-dependent manner. Interestingly, COUP-TF transfection alone produced some inhibition of AP-1 act"

Subsequently, GMEB-1 was also found to bind to hsp27, to associate with the coactivator TIF2 in yeast cells, and to participate in Parvovirus replication. To understand these multiple activities of GMEB-1 at a molecular level, we have now determined which regions are associated with the various activities associated with the modulation of GR transactivation properties. These activities include, homooligomerization, heterooligomerization, DNA binding, binding to GR and the transcriptional cofactor CBP, and GR modulation. Complex activities such as DNA binding and GR modulation, are found to require the physical combination of those domains that would be predicted from the involved biochemical processes. We have previously documented that GMEB-1 possesses both GR modulatory and intrinsic transactivation activity. However, the domains for these two activities of GMEB-1 are found not to overlap. This separation of activities provides a structural basis for our prior biological observations that the modulation of the dose-response curve and partial agonist activity of GR complexes is independent of the total levels of gene activation by the same GR complexes.

These responses most commonly involve either the induction or repression of gene expression due to changes in transcription. The particular response of a given cell depends upon on a variety of tissue and developmental controls that dictate which genes are capable of regulation by receptor-steroid complexes (1Ben-Or S. Okret S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 331-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 2Zhang H., Li, Y.-C. Young A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Among those genes that are programmed to respond, many of the details of steroid hormone action have only recently emerged and include binding to specific DNA sequences called hormone response elements (HREs),1 reorganization of chromatin, recruitment of a burgeoning assortment of transcription cofactors, and interaction with components of the transcription complex (4Beato M.

Agonists unleash the full activity of the receptor to cause either induction or repression of expression of the responsive gene. In both cases, the dose-response curve defines the relationship between ligand concentration and biological response. Unless exogenous steroids are administered, the concentration of circulating steroid in the bloodstream is rarely high enough to saturate the binding capacity of the intracellular steroid receptors. Therefore, the expression levels of most genes are sub-maximal and reflect the changing percentages of the total amount of a given steroid receptor in target cells that is bound by the fluctuating levels of endogenous steroids. A theoretically useful concentration is the EC50, which is the concentration of steroid required for half the maximal response and also corresponds in theory to the equilibrium dissociation constant for steroid binding to the receptor. The levels of endogenous steroid are usually similar to the EC50. The value of the EC50 is determined experimentally by subtracting the basal level expression of a given gene from the activities induced by a variety of steroid treatments and then calculating what percentage of full induction is produced by each steroid concentration. Thus, the EC50 is independent of both the basal and fully induced levels. This independence has been documented upon numerous occasions (8Oshima H. Simons S.S., Jr. J. Biol.

To the extent that the antisteroid blocks only the target gene and retains agonist activity for all other responsive genes, one can minimize the side effects that result from an antisteroid indiscriminately preventing the expression of all responsive genes. However, it is not as much the absolute level of partial agonist activity that is important as the percentage of the maximal response elicited by an agonist steroid. In this respect, as for the EC50 of the dose-response, the partial agonist activity of an antisteroid is independent of the basal and fully induced levels of the responsive gene (8Oshima H.

The determinants of the dose-response curve and the EC50are still not known despite playing a central role in steroid hormone action. The EC50was initially thought to be determined by the affinity of steroid binding to cognate receptor (18Baxter J.D. Tomkins G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1971; 68: 932-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 19Rousseau G.G. Schmit J.-P. J. Steroid Biochem. 1977; 8: 911-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 20Munck A. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 820-831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, reports of different dose-response curves for various genes within a cell for the same receptor-steroid complex indicate the involvement of additional parameters (21Amara J.F. Itallie C.V. Dannies P.S. Endocrinology. 1987; 120: 264-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 22Evans M.I. O'Malley P.J. Krust A. Burch J.B.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Furthermore, the EC50 can even change for the same gene under different cellular conditions (28Oshima H. Simons S.S., Jr. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 2106-2112PubMed Google Scholar, 29Oshima H. Simons S.S., Jr. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 416-428PubMed Google Scholar). Although initially perplexing as to how such changes in EC50 might occur, this variability offers tremendous benefits to a cell or organism. Because the levels of endogenous steroid are similar to the value of the EC50, changes in the EC50 afford a simple mechanism for the differential control of gene expression during development, differentiation, homeostasis, and the endocrine treatment of disease states. Similarly, the partial agonist activity of antisteroids is known to depend upon numerous factors such as promoter, cell type, tissue, and growth conditions (26Wasner G. Oshima H. Thompson E.B. Simons S.S., Jr. Mol. Endocrinol. 1988; 2: 1009-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 28Oshima H. Simons S.S., Jr. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 2106-2112PubMed Google Scholar, 30Berry M.

Thus, a better understanding of these phenomena might allow one to harness these variations for clinical purposes. We have recently succeeded in identifying several factors that can modulate both the EC50 and dose-response curve of receptor-agonist complexes and the partial agonist activity of receptor-antagonist complexes. The first is a cis-acting element of the rat tyrosine aminotransferase gene, which we call a glucocorticoid modulatory element, or GME (8Oshima H. Simons S.S., Jr. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26858-26865Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Oshima H. Simons S.S., Jr. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 416-428PubMed Google Scholar, 35Collier C.D. Oshima H.

Interestingly, the precise effects of some of these modulators are quite different for GR and progesterone receptor, even within the same cell (13Song L.-N. Huse B. Rusconi S. Simons S.S., Jr. J.

Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 416-428PubMed Google Scholar) and binds two novel proteins called GMEB-1 and -2 (43Oshima H. Szapary D. Simons S.S., Jr. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21893-21910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). We have cloned GMEB-1 (44Kaul S. Blackford J.A., Jr. Chen J. Ogryzko V.V. Simons S.S., Jr. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1010-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), which is the larger of these two proteins. GMEB-1 is located on human chromosome 1 (45Zeng H. Kaul S. Simons S.S., Jr. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1819-1829Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and is a member of a new family of transcription factors called KDWK proteins (44Kaul S.

Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 626-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). GMEB-1 exists as a large, heterooligomeric complex (molecular mass of about 550 kDa) with GMEB-2 in intact cells (43Oshima H. Szapary D. Simons S.S., Jr. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21893-21910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). GMEB-1 also homooligomerizes, possesses intrinsic transactivation activity, and modifies the induction properties of GR-agonist and -antagonist complexes in a reversible manner (44Kaul S. Blackford J.A., Jr. Chen J. Ogryzko V.V. Simons S.S., Jr. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1010-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). GMEB-1 binds specifically to the GME sequence and interacts with GR and with CBP (44Kaul S. Blackford J.A., Jr. Chen J. Ogryzko V.V. Simons S.S., Jr. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1010-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Thus, GMEB-1 is a multi-functional protein. Interestingly, GMEB-1 has been identified in other contexts that are completely unrelated to the GME and modulation of GR transactivation activities. GMEB-1 has been cloned on the basis of its binding to hsp27 (49Theriault J.R. Charette S.J. Lambert H. Landry J. FEBS Lett. 1999; 452: 170-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), which is an antiapoptotic protein that acts in part by delaying the release of cytoplasmic cytochrome c (50Paul C. Manero F. Gonin S. Kretz-Remy C. Virot S. Arrigo A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 816-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar) and that increases the tumorigenic potential of rat colon carcinoma cells (51Garrido C. Fromentin A. Bonnotte B. Favre N. Moutet M. Arrigo A.P. Mehlen P. Solary E. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5495-5499PubMed Google Scholar). GMEB-1 was also isolated by its binding to the second activation domain (AD2) of the coactivator TIF2 (37Voegel J.J. Heine M.J.S. Zechel C. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3667-3675Crossref PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar) in a yeast two-hybrid assay, although this binding may be mediated by an adapter molecule in yeast (52Jimenez-Lara A.M. Heine M.J.S. Gronemeyer H. FEBS. 2000; 468: 203-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Finally, GMEB-1 is involved in Parvovirus replication and has been called PIF (Parvovirus initiation factor (53Christensen J. Cotmore S.F. Tattersall P. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 5733-5741Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,54Christensen J. Cotmore S.F. Tattersall P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7741-7750Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and activates the viral nickase NS1 (55Christensen J. Cotmore S.F. Tattersall P. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 7009-7017Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). GMEB-1 is present in highest abundance in fetal and reproductive tissues (45Zeng H. Kaul S. Simons S.S., Jr. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1819-1829Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), which suggests that it could be a developmentally important protein for many actions. GMEB-1 is found in puffer fish (GenBankTMaccession number AL300721) and mammals but not prokaryotes and, thus, appears to be an evolutionarily recent protein. In view of the many different processes involving GMEB-1, each of which may require specialized activities, we sought to determine which domains of GMEB-1 are relevant for the modulation of GR transactivation properties. Thus, we wanted to identify the sequences required for homo- and heterooligomerization, DNA binding, intrinsic transactivation, GR modulation, interacting with CBP, and binding to GR. We find that several of these activities require multiple domains, consistent with the presence of the GMEB-1 as a heterooligomer in intact cells (43Oshima H. Szapary D. Simons S.S., Jr. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21893-21910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). This represents a first step in understanding at a molecular level how GMEB-1 functions as a component of GME action. Unless otherwise indicated, all operations were performed at 0 °C.

All cDNAs of the protein to be expressed were cloned so that they were under the control of either the T7 or SP6 promoter. For each reaction, 1 μg of plasmid DNA was mixed with 2 μl of 1 mm methionine and 40 μl of TNT T7 (or SP6) master mix (Promega) and brought up to a total volume of 50 μl with H2O. The reaction was conducted at 30 °C for 2 h. For radiolabeling the protein, 2 μl of 1 mmmethionine was replaced with 2 μl of [35S]methionine (Amersham Biosciences). When in vitro translating GR, 1 μl of 50 μm Dex was added in the reaction mix to bind and thereby stabilize the newly translated GR. GST-GMEB1 constructs were transformed into BL21 bacteria (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's procedure. A single colony was selected, inoculated into 20 ml of LB broth with 100 mm ampicillin, and cultivated overnight at 37 °C in a shaking incubator. A portion (15 ml) of the overnight culture was inoculated into 150 ml of LB broth (with 100 μg/ml ampicillin), shaken at 37 °C for 3–4 h, and then induced with 2–3 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3–4 h. Cells were washed once with PBS, resuspended in 10 ml of PBS, sonicated for 30 cycles (1 cycle = 10 s on and 10 s off). Cell lysates were obtained by spinning the sonicated cells at 20,800 ×g for 15 min and collecting the supernatant. Glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (30 μl;Amersham Biosciences) was added to each tube and washed twice with 500 μl of PBS (spin at 6000 × g for 2 min). Bacterial lysates (500–1500 μl) containing GST with and without fused heterologous protein were mixed gently with the beads by rotation (12–15 rpm) for 1–2 h at 4 °C. The pellets were isolated by centrifugation (2 min at 6000 × g) with 2 washes of 500 μl of PBS containing 10 mm mercaptoethanol. Dex-bound35S-labeled GR (7–10 μl) was added and incubated at 4 °C overnight with rotation. The beads were washed twice with 500 μl of PBS (+10 mm mercaptoethanol) and then 5 times with PBS (+100 mm NaCl). Proteins were removed from the beads by heating at 90 °C for 10–15 min in 40 μl of 2× sample buffer (Quality Biological, Inc.). Aliquots (10–15 μl) of the supernatant were loaded on to 10% SDS-PAGE mini-gels (200 V for 45 min). One gel was dried for 25 min and then used to expose film or phosphorimaging screen. The other gel was analyzed by Western blotting with anti-GST antibody to detect the GST fusion proteins. SDS-PAGE gels were equilibrated in transfer buffer for 15 min at room temperature before electrophoretic transfer of proteins to nitrocellulose membranes in a Bio-Rad small (150–200-mA overnight) or large (350-mA overnight) Transblot apparatus. The nitrocellulose was stained in Ponceau S (0.02% Ponceau S and 0.04% glacial acetic acid in water) to localize the molecular weight markers, incubated with 5% Carnation nonfat dry milk in TBS for 30–45 min, and washed three times with TBS containing 0.2% Tween (0.1 TTBS) for 5 min. Primary antibody was diluted in 0.2 TTBS (1:10,000 for anti-VP16, 1:10,000 for anti-Gal, 1:10,000 for Xpress, and 1:5,000 for anti-GST) and added to the nitrocellulose for 1–2 h at room temperature. Biotinylated anti-rabbit secondary antibody and ABC reagents (each was diluted 1:5,000, except anti-goat, which was 1:50,000; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) were each added for sequential 30-min incubations at room temperature. After the incubation periods with primary antibody, secondary antibody, and ABC reagents, the nitrocellulose was washed 4 times for 5 min each with 0.1 TTBS. The signals were detected by enhanced"
https://openalex.org/W1603536212,"P. M. S. Blackett (1897-1974) entered Cambridge University and the Cavendish Laboratory as a young veteran of the first world war. His innovative research with the Wilson cloud chamber resulted in photographic evidence of nuclear transformation and the existence of the positron. In the 1950s and 1960s, he helped to pioneer the use of paleomagnetic evidence in support of the theory of continental drift. A leader of operational research during the second world war, Blackett became an outspoken critic in the postwar period of American atomic policy and British development of nuclear weapons, taking on a public role for which he was sometimes criticized."
