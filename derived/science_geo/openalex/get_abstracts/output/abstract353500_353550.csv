https://openalex.org/W1984708728,"The identification of untranslated regions, introns, and coding regions within an organism remains challenging. We developed a quantitative sequencing-based method called RNA-Seq for mapping transcribed regions, in which complementary DNA fragments are subjected to high-throughput sequencing and mapped to the genome. We applied RNA-Seq to generate a high-resolution transcriptome map of the yeast genome and demonstrated that most (74.5%) of the nonrepetitive sequence of the yeast genome is transcribed. We confirmed many known and predicted introns and demonstrated that others are not actively used. Alternative initiation codons and upstream open reading frames also were identified for many yeast genes. We also found unexpected 3′-end heterogeneity and the presence of many overlapping genes. These results indicate that the yeast transcriptome is more complex than previously appreciated."

https://openalex.org/W2157082398,"Networks have in recent years emerged as an invaluable tool for describing and quantifying complex systems in many branches of science. Recent studies suggest that networks often exhibit hierarchical organization, in which vertices divide into groups that further subdivide into groups of groups, and so forth over multiple scales. In many cases the groups are found to correspond to known functional units, such as ecological niches in food webs, modules in biochemical networks (protein interaction networks, metabolic networks or genetic regulatory networks) or communities in social networks. Here we present a general technique for inferring hierarchical structure from network data and show that the existence of hierarchy can simultaneously explain and quantitatively reproduce many commonly observed topological properties of networks, such as right-skewed degree distributions, high clustering coefficients and short path lengths. We further show that knowledge of hierarchical structure can be used to predict missing connections in partly known networks with high accuracy, and for more general network structures than competing techniques. Taken together, our results suggest that hierarchy is a central organizing principle of complex networks, capable of offering insight into many network phenomena."
https://openalex.org/W2035538295,"All metazoan cells carry transmembrane receptors of the integrin family, which couple the contractile force of the actomyosin cytoskeleton to the extracellular environment. In agreement with this principle, rapidly migrating leukocytes use integrin-mediated adhesion when moving over two-dimensional surfaces. As migration on two-dimensional substrates naturally overemphasizes the role of adhesion, the contribution of integrins during three-dimensional movement of leukocytes within tissues has remained controversial. We studied the interplay between adhesive, contractile and protrusive forces during interstitial leukocyte chemotaxis in vivo and in vitro. We ablated all integrin heterodimers from murine leukocytes, and show here that functional integrins do not contribute to migration in three-dimensional environments. Instead, these cells migrate by the sole force of actin-network expansion, which promotes protrusive flowing of the leading edge. Myosin II-dependent contraction is only required on passage through narrow gaps, where a squeezing contraction of the trailing edge propels the rigid nucleus. Leukocytes are remarkable in their ability to infiltrate any type of tissue almost anywhere in the body. On flat surfaces they migrate using transmembrane receptors of the integrin family — present in all metazoan cells — that couple the contractile force of the actomyosin cytoskeleton to the extracellular environment. But studies of cell migration on two-dimensional surfaces overemphasize the role of adhesion. The rapid movement and extreme flexibility of leukocytes in three dimensions is now shown — by genetic knockout — not to involve integrins. Instead, the cells migrate using an amoeba-like flowing and squeezing action, powered by actin network expansion alone. Leukocyte migration over two-dimensional surfaces is dependent on the integrin family of adhesion receptors, which couple the contractile force of the actomyosin cytoskeleton to the extracellular environment. In this study, all integrin heterodimers from mouse leukocytes were ablated and it is shown that integrins are not required for migration in 3D environments, in vitro and in vivo. Such non-adhesive migration renders leukocytes autonomous from the tissue environment."
https://openalex.org/W2084953314,Oxygen-poor waters occupy large volumes of the intermediate-depth eastern tropical oceans. Oxygen-poor conditions have far-reaching impacts on ecosystems because important mobile macroorganisms avoid or cannot survive in hypoxic zones. Climate models predict declines in oceanic dissolved oxygen produced by global warming. We constructed 50-year time series of dissolved-oxygen concentration for select tropical oceanic regions by augmenting a historical database with recent measurements. These time series reveal vertical expansion of the intermediate-depth low-oxygen zones in the eastern tropical Atlantic and the equatorial Pacific during the past 50 years. The oxygen decrease in the 300- to 700-m layer is 0.09 to 0.34 micromoles per kilogram per year. Reduced oxygen levels may have dramatic consequences for ecosystems and coastal economies.
https://openalex.org/W2162595238,"Trichoderma reesei is the main industrial source of cellulases and hemicellulases used to depolymerize biomass to simple sugars that are converted to chemical intermediates and biofuels, such as ethanol. We assembled 89 scaffolds (sets of ordered and oriented contigs) to generate 34 Mbp of nearly contiguous T. reesei genome sequence comprising 9,129 predicted gene models. Unexpectedly, considering the industrial utility and effectiveness of the carbohydrate-active enzymes of T. reesei, its genome encodes fewer cellulases and hemicellulases than any other sequenced fungus able to hydrolyze plant cell wall polysaccharides. Many T. reesei genes encoding carbohydrate-active enzymes are distributed nonrandomly in clusters that lie between regions of synteny with other Sordariomycetes. Numerous genes encoding biosynthetic pathways for secondary metabolites may promote survival of T. reesei in its competitive soil habitat, but genome analysis provided little mechanistic insight into its extraordinary capacity for protein secretion. Our analysis, coupled with the genome sequence data, provides a roadmap for constructing enhanced T. reesei strains for industrial applications such as biofuel production."
https://openalex.org/W2047242847,"Erythroid cells undergo enucleation and the removal of organelles during terminal differentiation. Although autophagy has been suggested to mediate the elimination of organelles for erythroid maturation, the molecular mechanisms underlying this process remain undefined. Here we report a role for a Bcl-2 family member, Nix (also called Bnip3L), in the regulation of erythroid maturation through mitochondrial autophagy. Nix(-/-) mice developed anaemia with reduced mature erythrocytes and compensatory expansion of erythroid precursors. Erythrocytes in the peripheral blood of Nix(-/-) mice exhibited mitochondrial retention and reduced lifespan in vivo. Although the clearance of ribosomes proceeded normally in the absence of Nix, the entry of mitochondria into autophagosomes for clearance was defective. Deficiency in Nix inhibited the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsi(m)), and treatment with uncoupling chemicals or a BH3 mimetic induced the loss of DeltaPsi(m) and restored the sequestration of mitochondria into autophagosomes in Nix(-/-) erythroid cells. These results suggest that Nix-dependent loss of DeltaPsi(m) is important for targeting the mitochondria into autophagosomes for clearance during erythroid maturation, and interference with this function impairs erythroid maturation and results in anaemia. Our study may also provide insights into molecular mechanisms underlying mitochondrial quality control involving mitochondrial autophagy."
https://openalex.org/W2099402486,"Glycans are attractive targets for molecular imaging but have been inaccessible because of their incompatibility with genetically encoded reporters. We demonstrated the noninvasive imaging of glycans in live developing zebrafish, using a chemical reporter strategy. Zebrafish embryos were treated with an unnatural sugar to metabolically label their cell-surface glycans with azides. Subsequently, the embryos were reacted with fluorophore conjugates by means of copper-free click chemistry, enabling the visualization of glycans in vivo at subcellular resolution during development. At 60 hours after fertilization, we observed an increase in de novo glycan biosynthesis in the jaw region, pectoral fins, and olfactory organs. Using a multicolor detection strategy, we performed a spatiotemporal analysis of glycan expression and trafficking and identified patterns that would be undetectable with conventional molecular imaging approaches."

https://openalex.org/W2167612725,"Fire is a global driver of carbon storage and converts a substantial proportion of plant biomass to black carbon (for example, charcoal), which remains in the soil for thousands of years. Black carbon is therefore often proposed as an important long-term sink of soil carbon. We ran a 10-year experiment in each of three boreal forest stands to show that fire-derived charcoal promotes loss of forest humus and that this is associated with enhancement of microbial activity by charcoal. This result shows that charcoal-induced losses of belowground carbon in forests can partially offset the benefits of charcoal as a long-term carbon sink."
https://openalex.org/W2108843246,"Hepcidin, a liver-derived protein that restricts enteric iron absorption, is the key regulator of body iron content. Several proteins induce expression of the hepcidin-encoding gene Hamp in response to infection or high levels of iron. However, mechanism(s) of Hamp suppression during iron depletion are poorly understood. We describe mask : a recessive, chemically induced mutant mouse phenotype, characterized by progressive loss of body (but not facial) hair and microcytic anemia. The mask phenotype results from reduced absorption of dietary iron caused by high levels of hepcidin and is due to a splicing defect in the transmembrane serine protease 6 gene Tmprss6 . Overexpression of normal TMPRSS6 protein suppresses activation of the Hamp promoter, and the TMPRSS6 cytoplasmic domain mediates Hamp suppression via proximal promoter element(s). TMPRSS6 is an essential component of a pathway that detects iron deficiency and blocks Hamp transcription, permitting enhanced dietary iron absorption."
https://openalex.org/W2020414709,"Hierarchical nanostructures of lead sulfide nanowires resembling pine trees were synthesized by chemical vapor deposition. Structural characterization revealed a screwlike dislocation in the nanowire trunks with helically rotating epitaxial branch nanowires. It is suggested that the screw component of an axial dislocation provides the self-perpetuating steps to enable one-dimensional crystal growth, in contrast to mechanisms that require metal catalysts. The rotating trunks and branches are the consequence of the Eshelby twist of screw dislocations with a dislocation Burgers vector along the 110 directions having an estimated magnitude of 6 +/- 2 angstroms for the screw component. The results confirm the Eshelby theory of dislocations, and the proposed nanowire growth mechanism could be general to many materials."
https://openalex.org/W2056907950,"Glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK3beta) is involved in metabolism, neurodegeneration, and cancer. Inhibition of GSK3beta activity is the primary mechanism that regulates this widely expressed active kinase. Although the protein kinase Akt inhibits GSK3beta by phosphorylation at the N terminus, preventing Akt-mediated phosphorylation does not affect the cell-survival pathway activated through the GSK3beta substrate beta-catenin. Here, we show that p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) also inactivates GSK3beta by direct phosphorylation at its C terminus, and this inactivation can lead to an accumulation of beta-catenin. p38 MAPK-mediated phosphorylation of GSK3beta occurs primarily in the brain and thymocytes. Activation of beta-catenin-mediated signaling through GSK3beta inhibition provides a potential mechanism for p38 MAPK-mediated survival in specific tissues."

https://openalex.org/W2122773073,"Processes within the lowest several hundred kilometers of Earth's rocky mantle play a critical role in the evolution of the planet. Understanding Earth's lower mantle requires putting recent seismic and mineral physics discoveries into a self-consistent, geodynamically feasible context. Two nearly antipodal large low-shear-velocity provinces in the deep mantle likely represent chemically distinct and denser material. High-resolution seismological studies have revealed laterally varying seismic velocity discontinuities in the deepest few hundred kilometers, consistent with a phase transition from perovskite to post-perovskite. In the deepest tens of kilometers of the mantle, isolated pockets of ultralow seismic velocities may denote Earth's deepest magma chamber."
https://openalex.org/W2048816884,"Unlike conventional lasers, diffusive random lasers (DRLs) have no resonator to trap light and no high-Q resonances to support lasing. Because of this lack of sharp resonances, the DRL has presented a challenge to conventional laser theory. We present a theory able to treat the DRL rigorously and provide results on the lasing spectra, internal fields, and output intensities of DRLs. Typically DRLs are highly multimode lasers, emitting light at a number of wavelengths. We show that the modal interactions through the gain medium in such lasers are extremely strong and lead to a uniformly spaced frequency spectrum, in agreement with recent experimental observations."
https://openalex.org/W2005373669,"Young animals engage in variable exploratory behaviors essential for the development of neural circuitry and adult motor control, yet the neural basis of these behaviors is largely unknown. Juvenile songbirds produce subsong—a succession of primitive vocalizations akin to human babbling. We found that subsong production in zebra finches does not require HVC (high vocal center), a key premotor area for singing in adult birds, but does require LMAN (lateral magnocellular nucleus of the nidopallium), a forebrain nucleus involved in learning but not in adult singing. During babbling, neurons in LMAN exhibited premotor correlations to vocal output on a fast time scale. Thus, juvenile singing is driven by a circuit distinct from that which produces the adult behavior—a separation possibly general to other developing motor systems."
https://openalex.org/W2027864149,"RNA localization is important for the establishment and maintenance of polarity in multiple cell types. Localized RNAs are usually transported along microtubules or actin filaments and become anchored at their destination to some underlying subcellular structure. Retention commonly involves actin or actin-associated proteins, although cytokeratin filaments and dynein anchor certain RNAs. RNA localization is important for diverse processes ranging from cell fate determination to synaptic plasticity; however, so far there have been few comprehensive studies of localized RNAs in mammalian cells. Here we have addressed this issue, focusing on migrating fibroblasts that polarize to form a leading edge and a tail in a process that involves asymmetric distribution of RNAs. We used a fractionation scheme combined with microarrays to identify, on a genome-wide scale, RNAs that localize in protruding pseudopodia of mouse fibroblasts in response to migratory stimuli. We find that a diverse group of RNAs accumulates in such pseudopodial protrusions. Through their 3' untranslated regions these transcripts are anchored in granules concentrated at the plus ends of detyrosinated microtubules. RNAs in the granules associate with the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) tumour suppressor and the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP). APC is required for the accumulation of transcripts in protrusions. Our results suggest a new type of RNA anchoring mechanism as well as a new, unanticipated function for APC in localizing RNAs."
https://openalex.org/W2023161358,"The in situ or authigenic formation of calcium phosphate minerals in marine sediments is a major sink for the vital nutrient phosphorus. However, because typical sediment chemistry is not kinetically conducive to the precipitation of these minerals, the mechanism behind their formation has remained a fundamental mystery. Here, we present evidence from high-sensitivity x-ray and electrodialysis techniques to describe a mechanism by which abundant diatom-derived polyphosphates play a critical role in the formation of calcium phosphate minerals in marine sediments. This mechanism can explain the puzzlingly dispersed distribution of calcium phosphate minerals observed in marine sediments worldwide."
https://openalex.org/W2096880956,"Several studies have shown that healthy individuals with fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels at the high end of the normal range have an increased risk of mortality. To identify genetic determinants that contribute to interindividual variation in FPG, we tested 392,935 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 654 normoglycemic participants for association with FPG, and we replicated the most strongly associated SNP (rs560887, P = 4 × 10 –7 ) in 9353 participants. SNP rs560887 maps to intron 3 of the G6PC2 gene, which encodes glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit–related protein (also known as IGRP), a protein selectively expressed in pancreatic islets. This SNP was associated with FPG (linear regression coefficient β = –0.06 millimoles per liter per A allele, combined P = 4 × 10 –23 ) and with pancreatic β cell function (Homa-B model, combined P = 3 × 10 –13 ) in three populations; however, it was not associated with type 2 diabetes risk. We speculate that G6PC2 regulates FPG by modulating the set point for glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in pancreatic β cells."
https://openalex.org/W2005366749,"Skeletal muscle fibrosis is a major pathological hallmark of chronic myopathies in which myofibers are replaced by progressive deposition of collagen and other extracellular matrix proteins produced by muscle fibroblasts. Recent studies have shown that in the absence of the endogenous muscle growth regulator myostatin, regeneration of muscle is enhanced, and muscle fibrosis is correspondingly reduced. We now demonstrate that myostatin not only regulates the growth of myocytes but also directly regulates muscle fibroblasts. Our results show that myostatin stimulates the proliferation of muscle fibroblasts and the production of extracellular matrix proteins both in vitro and in vivo. Further, muscle fibroblasts express myostatin and its putative receptor activin receptor IIB. Proliferation of muscle fibroblasts, induced by myostatin, involves the activation of Smad, p38 MAPK and Akt pathways. These results expand our understanding of the function of myostatin in muscle tissue and provide a potential target for anti-fibrotic therapies.

Fibroblasts play an important role in the repair response of tissues to injury by secreting extracellular matrix proteins including collagen and growth factors. However, in a variety of disease states, continued fibrosis contributes to the pathological process. In chronic myopathies and muscular dystrophies, fibrosis is considered to be associated with decreased strength and elasticity of muscle and may inhibit the diffusion of nutrients to myofibers (1Bischoff R. Engel A.G. Franzini-Armstrong C. Myology. 2nd Ed. McGraw-Hill, New York1994: 97-118Google Scholar, 2Huard J. Li Y. Fu F.H. J. Bone Joint Surg.

Identification of factors that regulate fibrosis is an important goal not only in understanding the pathogenesis of muscular dystrophies but also in developing novel therapies to treat these disorders. Several potential future therapies for the muscular dystrophies, including those involving gene and myoblast transfer, may be hampered by significant fibrosis.

Deletion of the myostatin gene (MSTN) in mice leads to muscle hypertrophy and hyperplasia with an approximate doubling of muscle mass (4McPherron A.C. Lawler A.M. Lee S.J. Nature. 1997; 387: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (3186) Google Scholar). This function of myostatin, as an endogenous inhibitor of muscle growth, is also conserved in humans, as demonstrated by the identification of a hypermuscular child with a loss-of-function mutation in the myostatin gene (5Schuelke M.

One mechanism by which myostatin regulates muscle growth in adult animals appears to be direct inhibition of the proliferation and differentiation of resident muscle precursor cells (6McCroskery S.

In the absence of myostatin, muscle regenerates more quickly and completely following acute and chronic injury (8Wagner K.R. Liu X. Chang X. Allen R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In the mdx mouse, a model of Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy, myostatin deletion, or postnatal inhibition increases muscle mass and strength (10Bogdanovich S. Krag T.O. Barton E.R. Morris L.D.

Reduced fibrosis has also been observed in mdx mice treated postnatally with a neutralizing antibody to myostatin (10Bogdanovich S. Krag T.O. Barton E.R. Morris L.D. Whittemore L.A. Ahima R.S.

Decreased fibrosis of limb muscle in myostatin null animals after acute injury with notexin has been reported (9McCroskery S. Thomas M. Platt L. Hennebry A. Nishimura T. McLeay L. Sharma M.

These studies in models of acute and chronic injury all support the emerging concept that myostatin is a negative regulator of muscle precursors and that inhibition of myostatin improves muscle growth and regeneration. However, it is unclear from these previous studies whether the observed reduction in fibrosis is secondary to increased myofiber regeneration or whether myostatin may have a direct effect on fibrosis. Growth Factors and Inhibitors—Recombinant mouse myostatin and follistatin were obtained from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Rapamycin was obtained from Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA). SB202190, SB203580, and Smad3-specific inhibitor (SIS3) were obtained from Sigma. Antibodies—Primary antibodies used in these studies included: mouse anti-proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA); goat anti-activin receptor IIB; mouse anti-cyclin D1; rabbit anti-human fibronectin; mouse anti-vimentin; and mouse anti-α-smooth muscle antigen (SMA) from Sigma. Mouse anti-HSP47 was obtained from Abcam (Cambridge, MA). Rabbit anti-phospho-Smad 2 (Ser465/467) was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Rabbit anti-phospho-Smad3 (Ser433/435) was obtained from EMD Chemicals Inc. (Darmstadt, Germany). Rabbit anti-Smad2; rabbit anti-Smad3; rabbit anti-phospho-Akt (Ser473); rabbit anti-Akt; rabbit anti-phospho-p38 MAPK; rabbit anti-p38 MAPK; rabbit anti-phospho-mTOR; rabbit anti-mTOR; and rabbit anti-α-tubulin antibodies were obtained from Cell Signaling. Mouse anti-MyoD was obtained from BD Biosciences (San Jose, CA). Rabbit anti-collagen I was obtained by Cell Sciences (Canto MA). Mouse anti-MF20 (developed by Donald A. Fischman), mouse anti-CD45 (by J. Thomas August and James E. K. Hildreth), and mouse anti-Pax 7 (by Atsushi Kawakami) were obtained from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank (Iowa City, IA). A polyclonal anti-myostatin antibody was raised in rabbits to a 15-amino acid peptide corresponding to an epitope in the C-terminal domain of myostatin (DFGLDCDEHSTESRC (Ahx)K-amide) and affinity-purified. This antibody specifically recognizes purified myostatin and a 12-kDa protein band in wild type but not myostatin null cell cultures (see supplemental Fig. S1). The secondary antibodies used in this study included: Alexa Fluor 488, 555, 594, and 647 (Invitrogen); donkey anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG peroxidase conjugate (Molecular Probes); and anti-goat IgG peroxidase conjugate (Sigma). Primary Muscle Fibroblast Culture and Treatments—All of the animal experiments were carried out in accordance with guidelines prescribed by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at The Johns Hopkins University, School of Medicine. Myostatin null mice (mstn–/–/C57BL/6) were generated by Se-Jin Lee (4McPherron A.C. Lawler A.M. Lee S.J. Nature. 1997; 387: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (3186) Google Scholar). Activin receptor type IIB null mice (ActRIIB–/–) were generated by En Li (14Oh S.P. Li E. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1812-1826Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). C57BL/6 and mdx/C57BL/6 mice were obtained from the Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). Hind limb skeletal muscles and diaphragm were harvested from 4–6-week-old mice. After removing fascia, fat, and other connective tissue, the muscles were washed several times in PBS and mechanically dissociated by mincing with scissors. Minced muscles were digested with 0.2% collagenase (Sigma) diluted in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) at 37 °C for 30 min. After filtering through a 40-μm Nylon cell strainer (BD Falcon), the digested muscles were centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 5 min. The cell pellets were resuspended in culture medium (10% fetal bovine serum with 1% penicillin/streptomycin in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium). The cells were incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2 to allow adherence to noncoated 10-cm culture dishes. As previously described, muscle fibroblasts adhere within minutes to noncoated plastic dishes, whereas myogenic cells require longer time periods (15Blau H.M. Webster C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 5623-5627Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 16Richler C. Yaffe D. Dev. Biol. 1970; 23: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Following 30 min of preplating, non-adherent cells were removed, and adherent cells were washed with PBS to further discard any potential remaining myogenic cells. The cultured cells were washed with PBS every day until cells became confluent. The adherent cells were shown to be exclusively fibroblasts by RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry (see supplemental Fig. S2). Before treatment with myostatin or other growth factor, the cells were grown in serum-free culture medium for 12 h. For transient transfections of primary muscle fibroblasts with pCMV-Smad3-FLAG or pCMV-empty, Lipofectamine® 2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen) was used as per the manufacturer's instructions. Immunocytochemistry—Primary muscle fibroblasts and C2C12 myoblasts (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were grown on microscope cover glasses (Fisherbrand) overnight. The cells or 10-μm cryosections of muscle were washed with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformadehyde for 10 min. After blocking with 5% goat serum with PBS at room temperature for 30 min, the cells were incubated with primary antibodies at 4 °C overnight and then with secondary antibodies at room temperature for 1 h. All of the primary antibodies were used at 1:200 except for anti-Pax 7, which was used at 1:5. Cell Proliferation Assays—For [3H]thymidine and [3H]proline incorporation assays, the fibroblasts were plated at a density of 105 cells/well in 96-well plates and cultured overnight. After the cells were cultured in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 12 h, a final concentration of 12–300 ng/ml recombinant myostatin or myostatin preincubated with equimolar amounts of follistatin was added to each well for an additional 12 h. The cells were pretreated with 10 nmol rapamycin (Cell Signaling) for 1 h prior to the addition of myostatin where indicated. 4 μCi/ml [3H]thymidine or [3H]proline was added to culture medium for an additional 24 h. Incorporation of tritium into cells was counted in triplicate wells using a liquid scintillation system (Beckman LS 5801). RT-PCR—Total cellular RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent as per the manufacturer's directions (Invitrogen). Full-length first strand cDNA was generated from 500 ng of total RNA (Amersham Biosciences). Primers included: Pax 7 (sense, GGTCCCCAGGATGATGAGA, and antisense, TTGATGAAGACCCCACCAAG); Desmin (sense, TCGCGGCTAAGAACATCTCT, and antisense, ACATCCAAGGCCATCTTCAC); HSP47(sense, CCTGAGGTCACCAAGGATGT, and antisense, CTGCAGCTTCTCCTTCTCGT); prolyl 4-hydroxylase (sense, CCGAAGATTTTTGGAGGTGA, and antisense, CGCCCCAACCAGTACTTTTA); and myostatin (sense, CTGGTCCTGGGAAGGTTACA, and antisense, ACGCTACCACGGAAACAATC). Either glyceraldhyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (sense, CAACTACATGGTTTACATGTTC, and antisense, GCCAGTGGACTCCACGAC) or β-actin (sense, GCTCGTCGTCGACAACGGCTC, and antisense, CAAACATGATCTGGGTCATCTTCTC) cDNA was used as an internal standard. For studies on myostatin expression, PCR products were excised, purified, and sequenced. p(CAGA)12 Luciferase Reporter Assay—A204 (human rhabdomyosarcoma) cells that were stably transfected with p(CAGA)12-MLP-Luc were a gift from Li-fang Liang (MetaMorphix Inc., Savage, MD) (17Thies R.S. Chen T. Daview M.V. Tomkinson K.N. Pearson A.A. Shakey Q.A. Wolfman N.M. Growth Factors. 2001; 18: 251-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Muscle fibroblasts isolated from wild-type mice and myostatin null mice were washed three times with PBS and then cultured in serum-free McCoy's 5A medium for 48 h. The conditioned culture medium was collected, centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 5 min, and heat-activated at 100 °C for 5 min. Transfected A204 cells were incubated with the conditioned medium for 24 h, and the activity of luciferase was measured using an Lmax II luminometer (Molecular Devices). Immunoblot Analysis—SDS-PAGE and Western blot transfer were performed on cell lysates using standard techniques. The primary antibodies were used as described above. The blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase secondary antibodies, and chemiluminescent reagent (Amersham Biosciences) was used to detect the secondary antibody on the membrane. The relative density of each band was determined by using Scio Image software (National Institutes of Health). Injection of Myostatin Beads into Skeletal Muscle in Vivo—Heparin acrylic beads, 125–250 μm in diameter (Sigma), were soaked in 100 μg/ml myostatin, myostatin plus equimolar follistatin, or PBS for 1 h at room temperature prior to injection. Following anesthesia, tibialis muscles of 4–6-week-old C57BL/6 mice were exposed, and ∼10 beads were injected into each muscle. The muscles were removed from euthanized mice 1 week after injection. Transverse sections (10 μm thick) were obtained at 500-μm intervals throughout the injected region. The sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin or Sirius red or used for immunohistochemistry as described above. A fibrosis index was calculated by averaging the area of fibrosis per area of beads in multiple sections per tibialis-injected muscle. Statistical Evaluation—All of the data are presented as the means and standard deviations. Student's t test is used for comparison of the means between groups. Myostatin Increases Proliferation of Muscle Fibroblasts in Vitro and in Vivo—To address the role of myostatin in the regulation of fibroblast proliferation, primary muscle fibroblasts were isolated and cultured from limb muscles of C57BL/6 mice. Primary muscle fibroblasts had a fibroblast-like morphology and expressed common antigenic markers of fibroblasts including vimentin, collagen I, HSP47, and α-SMA but did not express satellite cell or myogenic markers such as Pax 7, MyoD, desmin, or myosin heavy chain (supplemental Fig. S2, a and b). RT-PCR from mRNA isolated from cultures demonstrated expression of HSP47 and prolyl 4-hydroxylase but not Pax7 or desmin (supplemental Fig. S2, c and d), consistent with pure cultures of muscle fibroblasts devoid of myogenic cells. Cultured muscle fibroblasts were treated with recombinant myostatin at concentrations of 12–300 ng/ml for 24 h, and proliferation was assayed by various measures. Expression of PCNA and cyclin D1, subcellular markers of cell proliferation, increased in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1a). [3H]Thymidine incorporation, an assay of cellular DNA synthesis, and [3H]proline incorporation, a marker of collagen production, increased linearly with concentrations of myostatin from 12.5 to 50 ng/ml and reached a plateau at higher concentrations (Fig. 1, b and c). This proliferative effect of myostatin on muscle fibroblasts could be partially blocked with follistatin, an endogenous inhibitor of myostatin (18Amthor H. Nicholas G. McKinnell I. Kemp C.F. Sharma M. Kambadur R. Patel K. Dev. Biol. 2004; 270: 19-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 19Lee S.J. McPherron A.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9306-9311Crossref PubMed Scopus (1277) Google Scholar). Myostatin-induced expression of PCNA and cyclin D1, as well as fibroblast-associated proteins α-SMA, HSP47, fibronectin, and vimentin, were blocked or reduced by co-treatment of myostatin and equimolar concentrations of follistatin (Fig. 1d). [3H]Thymidine incorporation was significantly reduced (p < 0.001) with follistatin plus myostatin compared with myostatin alone (Fig. 1e). Similarly, incorporation of [3H]proline was blocked by co-treatment of follistatin with myostatin and was statistically indistinguishable from controls (Fig. 1f). Skeletal muscles, and particularly diaphragm, of the dystrophic mdx mouse model have enhanced interstitial fibrosis (20Stedman H.H. Sweeney H.L. Shrager J.B. Maguire H.C. Panettieri R.A. Petrof B. Narusawa M. Leferovich J.M. Sladky J.T. Kelly A.M. Nature. 1991; 352: 536-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). To determine whether fibroblasts from mdx muscle are also responsive to myostatin, primary fibroblasts were isolated from mdx and wild-type mouse hindlimb and diaphragm muscles. Myostatin induced PCNA expression in fibroblasts from mdx diaphragm in a dose-dependent fashion (supplemental Fig. S3a). Cyclin D1 immunoreactivity increased 2–3-fold following the addition of myostatin to the medium of cultured fibroblasts from mdx hindlimb or diaphragm muscle similar to the increases observed in wild-type muscle (supplemental Fig. S3b). To determine whether myostatin directly induces fibroblast proliferation and fibrosis in vivo, heparin acrylic beads preincubated with recombinant myostatin were injected into tibialis muscle of adult wild-type mice. Using a similar bead injection method, previous investigators have been able to demonstrate myostatin inhibition of myogenesis in chick embryos (18Amthor H. Nicholas G. McKinnell I. Kemp C.F. Sharma M. Kambadur R. Patel K. Dev. Biol. 2004; 270: 19-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Tibialis muscle was harvested 1 week following injection with beads coated with myostatin, equimolar concentrations of myostatin and follistatin, or PBS. Histochemistry of transverse sections demonstrated endomysial cellular infiltrates and collagen deposition around myostatin-coated beads (Fig. 2a). There were slight cellular infiltrates surrounding PBS-coated beads. The average area of fibrosis per area of beads (fibrosis index) was approximately five times greater for myostatin-coated than PBS-coated beads (p < 0.005) (Fig. 2b). Preincubation of myostatin with equimolar concentrations of follistatin abolished myostatin-induced fibrosis (Fig. 2a, middle panel), and the fibrosis index of beads coated with myostatin and follistatin was statistically indistinguishable from that of beads coated with PBS (Fig. 2b). Picro-Sirius Red staining of collagen and immunohistochemistry with antibodies to vimentin, fibronectin, HSP47, α-SMA, and collagen I confirmed the identity of the cellular infiltrates as predominantly fibroblasts with extracellular matrix protein production (Fig. 2c). Conversely, there was only a thin rim of inflammatory cells surrounding the myostatin-coated beads as seen by immunohistochemistry with antibodies to CD45, a marker of T and B cells (Fig. 2d). These results confirm that myostatin induces fibroblast proliferation and extracellular matrix protein production in vivo. Myostatin Is Produced by Fibroblasts—Myostatin mRNA and protein are predominantly detected in total skeletal muscle tissue and have been reported to be produced by myofibers and satellite cells (6McCroskery S. Thomas M. Maxwell L. Sharma M. Kambadur R. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 1135-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar, 21Ríos R. Carneiro I. Arce V.M. Devesa J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 561-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). To determine whether the fibroblasts included in total muscle homogenates also express myostatin, we examined the myostatin RNA and protein from isolated muscle fibroblasts. Myostatin mRNA was detected by RT-PCR of RNA isolated from primary muscle fibroblast cultures derived from C57/BL/6 mice as well as from a positive control of C2C12 myoblasts but not from cultures of muscle fibroblasts derived from myostatin null mice (Fig. 3a). Myostatin protein was detected using a polyclonal antibody developed to the C-terminal peptide of myostatin (see “Experimental Procedures”). This antibody recognized a 25-kDa protein band from muscle fibroblasts and C2C12 myoblasts on nonreducing condition gels and a 12-kDa protein band on reducing condition gels consistent with the molecular weights of the disulfide-bridged dimer and monomer, respectively, of active myostatin (Fig. 3b). Interestingly, myostatin expression in fibroblasts is not limited to muscle. Primary fibroblasts derived from a variety of organs produced low levels of myostatin transcript as determined by RT-PCR and a subset had detectable protein product as determined by immunoblot (supplemental Fig. S4). Myostatin produced from fibroblasts is biologically active as determined by a luciferase reporter assay. The p(CAGA)12-MLP-Luc reporter construct, containing 12 copies of the consensus SBE sequence CAGA, has been widely used as a TGF-β family member and myostatin-inducible promoter system (22Hill J.J.

Cytokine. 2004; 26: 262-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Heat-activated conditioned medium from primary wild-type muscle fibroblasts displayed luciferase activity severalfold greater than that from myostatin null fibroblasts (Fig. 3c). Muscle fibroblasts express the putative receptor for myostatin (ActRIIB) (Fig. 3d) (19Lee S.J. McPherron A.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9306-9311Crossref PubMed Scopus (1277) Google Scholar, 23Rebbapragada A. Benchabane H. Wrana J.L. Celeste A.J. Attisano L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7230-7242Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). ActRIIB is a likely fibroblast receptor for myostatin because myostatin does not induce expression of markers of cell proliferation in muscle fibroblasts cultured from skeletal muscle of mice with a targeted disruption of the ActRIIB gene (Fig. 3e) (14Oh S.P. Li E. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1812-1826Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest that muscle fibroblasts produce functional myostatin, which induces proliferation through the ActRIIB receptor. Myostatin Induces Early Activation of Smad Followed by Delayed Activation of p38 MAPK and PI3K-Akt Pathways in Muscle Fibroblasts—Myostatin inhibits myocyte proliferation and differentiation in part by stimulating phosphorylation of both Smad2 and Smad3 (19Lee S.J. McPherron A.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9306-9311Crossref PubMed Scopus (1277) Google Scholar, 23Rebbapragada A. Benchabane H. Wrana J.L. Celeste A.J. Attisano L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7230-7242Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). When muscle fibroblasts were treated with recombinant myostatin at concentrations from 12.5 to 300 ng/ml for 24 h, phosphorylation of both Smad2 and Smad3 increased in a dose-dependent manner, whereas the total levels of Smad2 and Smad3 were unchanged (Fig. 4a). Increased phospho-Smad2 and phospho-Smad3 could be detected at 15 min after the addition of myostatin (Fig. 4b). To determine whether the Smad signaling pathway was directly involved in myostatin-induced muscle fibroblast proliferation, we examined the effect of Smad3 on markers of proliferation. Previous reports have indicated that Smad3, but not Smad2, mediates TGF-β induced proliferation of nonmuscle fibroblasts (25Jinnin M. Ihn H. Tamaki K. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 69: 597-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 26Piek E. Ju W.J. Heyer J. Escalante-Alcalde D. Stewart C.L. Weinstein M. Deng C. Kucherlapati R. Bottinger E.P. Roberts A.B.

Chem. 2004; 279: 2632-2639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Muscle fibroblasts were transiently transfected with pCMV-Smad3-FLAG, resulting in a corresponding increase in phospho-Smad3, indicating that the overexpressed Smad3-FLAG was active (Fig. 4c). Smad3-FLAG-expressing fibroblasts had increased levels of proliferative markers PCNA and cyclin D1. Next, we examined the effect of inhibiting Smad3 on myostatin-treated muscle fibroblasts. Endogenous Smad3 activity was blocked with SIS3 in muscle fibroblasts. SIS3 is a potent and specific inhibitor of Smad3 that inhibits the phosphorylation of Smad3 and its interaction with Smad 4 but does not affect the phosphorylation of Smad2 (25Jinnin M. Ihn H. Tamaki K. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 69: 597-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis showed that treatment of muscle fibroblasts with 3 μm SIS3 blocked base-line levels of Smad3 phosphorylation, but total Smad3 remained unchanged (Fig. 4d). Phospho-Smad2 and total Smad2 were unaffected by SIS3 treatment. Pretreatment of fibroblasts with SIS3 led to inhibition of myostatin-mediated increases in phospho-Smad3 and PCNA. (Fig. 4d) Together, these results suggest that myostatin activates the canonical Smad signaling pathway in fibroblasts and that Smad3 phosphorylation induces fibroblast proliferation. Interestingly, we found that p38 MAPK and Akt phosphorylation were induced by myostatin and reduced by inhibition of Smad3 phosphorylation with SIS3 in cultured fibroblasts (Fig. 4d). This raised the possibility of activation of p38MAPK and PI3K/Akt pathways downstream of Smad signaling of myostatin. Phosphorylation of p38-MAPK and Akt, at amino acid 473, were respectively induced at 1 and 2 h after addition of myostatin, whereas total levels of p38-MAPK and Akt were unchanged (Fig. 5a). Myostatin-induced phosphorylation of Akt and induction of PCNA and cyclin D1 expression could be blocked by pretreating cells with p38-MAPK inhibitors SB202190 (Fig. 5b) or SB203580 (data not shown). Treatment of muscle fibroblasts with myostatin increased phosphorylation of mTOR, a target of Akt. Further, inhibition of mTOR phosphorylation by pretreatment with rapamycin reduced phospho-mTOR and PCNA to control levels (p < 0.005) (Fig. 5, c and d). Inhibition of Akt/mTOR signaling with rapamycin also blocked the proliferative effects of myostatin, measured by [3H]thymidine incorporation, and the production of collagen, measured by [3H]proline incorporation (Fig. 5, e and f). These results demonstrate that myostatin induces proliferation of muscle fibroblasts via stimulation of the Smad, p38-MAPK, and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways in a sequential time course (summarized in Fig. 6).FIGURE 6Sequential stimulation of Smad, p38 MAPK, and Akt pathways in the myostatin induction of fibroblast proliferation.

However, in studies of acute and chronic injury, reduced fibrosis has been observed in the absence of myostatin, suggesting that myostatin may have additional roles (8Wagner K.R. Liu X. Chang X. Allen R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 2519-2524Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 9McCroskery S. Thomas M. Platt L. Hennebry A. Nishimura T. McLeay L. Sharma M. Kambadur R.

In the current study, we have provided evidence that myostatin directly stimulates muscle fibroblast proliferation and expression of extracellular matrix proteins in vivo as well as in vitro. We have shown that muscle fibroblasts express functional myostatin, which induces proliferation through the ActRIIB receptor. We have also demonstrated that in muscle fibroblasts, myostatin stimulates the canonical Smad signaling pathway common to TGF-β family members, as well as delayed activation of the p38 MAPK and the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathways and that all contribute to mediating fibroblast proliferation. In fibroblasts, as reported for myoblasts (24Zhu X. Topouzis S. Liang L.F. Stotish R.L. Cytokine. 2004; 26: 262-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 29Langley B. Thomas M. Bishop A. Sharma M. Gilmour S. Kambadur R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49831-49840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar), we find that myostatin induces the phosphorylation and activation of canonical TGF-β signal transducers Smad2 and Smad3. We have shown that specifically, Smad3 overexpression induces muscle fibroblast proliferation and that SIS3, a specific inhibitor of Smad3, reduces myostatin-induced muscle fibroblast proliferation. These results differ from what has been described in fibroblasts isolated from tendons. In these cells, myostatin activates p38 MAPK and Smad2/3 signaling, but only p38 MAPK activation was found to be associated with proliferation (30Mendias C.L. Bakhurin K.I. Faulkner J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 388-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). We also found that myostatin has a strong delayed activation of the p38 MAPK as well as the PI3K/Akt pathways in fibroblasts. Further, phospho-AKT levels are blocked by both inhibitors of Smad3 and p38 MAPK and are required for myostatin-mediated fibroblast proliferation. In myoblasts, myostatin acts to inhibit cell proliferation, and myostatin treatment of C2C12 myoblasts leads to decreased phosphorylation of Akt and downstream elements to stimulate cyclin D1 degradation (31Yang W. Zhang Y. Li Y. Wu Z. Zhu D. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 3799-3808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Conversely, we find in muscle fibroblasts that myostatin increases Akt, and mTOR phosphorylation and inhibition of Akt activity with rapamycin block the effect of myostatin on fibroblast growth and extracellular matrix protein production. This stimulatory effect of myostatin on the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway has not been previously described to our knowledge but is congruous to the signaling of TGF-β1 inducing fibroblast proliferation via Akt activation in other cell types (27Runyan C.E. Schnaper H.W. Poncelet A.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2632-2639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 32Horowitz J.C. Rogers D.S. Sharma V. Vittal R. White E.S. Cui Z. Thannickal V.J. Cell Signal. 2007; 19: 761-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The results presented in the current paper suggest that myostatin, similar to TGF-β1 has cell-specific signaling and effects. TGF-β signaling is perhaps the most potent mediator of fibrogenesis in multiple organs including liver, lung, kidney, and heart (33Gressner A.M. Weiskirchen R. J. Cell Mol. Med. 2006; 10: 76-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar, 34Berk B.C. Fujiwara K. Lehoux S. J. Clin. Investig. 2007; 117: 568-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar, 35Gagliardini E.

Med. 2006; 12: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). TGF-β signaling also plays a significant role in muscle fibrosis. TGF-β1 expression parallels development of fibrosis and neutralizing antibodies to TGF-β1 reduce fibrosis in mdx diaphragms (37Andreetta F. Bernasconi P. Baggi F. Ferro P. Oliva L. Arnoldi E. Cornelio F. Mantegazza R. Confalonieri P. J. Neuroimmunol. 2006; 175: 77-86Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Similarly, TGF-β1 expression correlates with fibrosis in dystrophic patient muscle (38Bernasconi P. Torchiana E. Confalonieri P. Brugnoni R. Barresi R. Mora M. Cornelio F. Morandi L. Mantegazza R. J. Clin. Investig. 1995; 96: 1137-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). TGF-β1 is a ubiquitously distributed cytokine with prominent immunosuppressive, anti-inflammatory, and tumor-suppressive roles. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that mechanisms to sequester or block synthesis of TGF-β1 will have serious adverse effects in long term systemic treatment. Although myostatin is expressed in low levels in heart and fat (39Allen D.L. Cleary A.S. Speaker K.J. Lindsay S.F. Uyenishi J. Reed J.M. Madden M.C. Mehan R.S. Am. J.

Curr. Opin. Rheumatol. 2005; 17: 720-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Myostatin may therefore be a more selective therapeutic target than TGF-β1 for combating muscle fibrosis. Therapies that are currently being designed to decrease necrosis in muscle diseases may have little utility unless fibrosis is simultaneously addressed. For example, gene therapy to restore dystrophin to the sarcolemma for Duchenne muscular dystrophy may be inefficient in gene delivery or ineffective in producing increased muscle strength in the setting of significant endomysial fibrosis. Myostatin inhibitors have entered clinical trials in patients with muscle wasting and degenerative diseases. Such inhibitors have the potential of increasing muscle regeneration through the effects of myostatin on myoblasts and also of inhibiting fibrosis through its effects on fibroblasts presented in this paper.

We show that the three main models proposed so far fail to fully replicate the empirical data, and we develop a likelihood-based approach for the direct comparison of alternative models based on the full structure of the network.

https://openalex.org/W2007167713,"The protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei is lysed by apolipoprotein L-I, a component of human high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles that are also characterized by the presence of haptoglobin-related protein. We report that this process is mediated by a parasite glycoprotein receptor, which binds the haptoglobin-hemoglobin complex with high affinity for the uptake and incorporation of heme into intracellular hemoproteins. In mice, this receptor was required for optimal parasite growth and the resistance of parasites to the oxidative burst by host macrophages. In humans, the trypanosome receptor also recognized the complex between hemoglobin and haptoglobin-related protein, which explains its ability to capture trypanolytic HDLs. Thus, in humans the presence of haptoglobin-related protein has diverted the function of the trypanosome haptoglobin-hemoglobin receptor to elicit innate host immunity against the parasite."

Because bone tissue is the second most abundant source of Gla-containing proteins after the liver, we sought to identify Gla proteins secreted by bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs). We used a proteomics approach to screen the secretome of MSCs with a combination of two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and tandem mass spectrometry. The most abundant Gla-containing protein secreted by MSCs was identified as periostin, a previously unrecognized γ-carboxylated protein. In silico amino acid sequence analysis of periostin demonstrated the presence of four consensus γ-carboxylase recognition sites embedded within fasciclin-like protein domains. The carboxylation of periostin was confirmed by immunoprecipitation and purification of the recombinant protein. Carboxylation of periostin could be inhibited by warfarin in MSCs, demonstrating its dependence on the presence of vitamin K. We were able to demonstrate localization of carboxylated periostin to bone nodules formed by MSCs in vitro, suggesting a role in extracellular matrix mineralization. Our data also show that another fasciclin I-like protein, βig-h3, contains Gla.

Bone marrow stroma contains a population of adherent cells referred to as mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), 4The abbreviations used are: MSC, marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells; Gla, γ-carboxyglutamic acid; CM, conditioned medium; ECM, extracellular matrix; PN, periostin; OC, osteocalcin; MGP, matrix Gla protein; MS, mass spectrometry; BisTris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; CRS, carboxylase recognition site(s). which have the capacity to differentiate into many mesenchymal cell lineages, including osteoblasts, chondrocytes, and adipocytes (1Friedenstein A.J.

Science. 1999; 284: 143-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (18139) Google Scholar). To date, no single marker that is able to identify and localize MSCs in vivo has been described. MSCs are therefore identified in vitro based on their abilities to differentiate into mesenchymal lineage cells and express specific membrane-bound surface antigens that distinguish them from hematopoietic, endothelial, and fibroblastic cells (4Deans R.J.

It is widely accepted that one of the main biological functions of marrow MSCs is to provide the microenvironment necessary for support of hematopoiesis, but their role in development, maintenance, and repair of bone is also well established (6Prockop D.J. Science. 1997; 276: 71-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (4157) Google Scholar, 7Prockop D.J. Gregory C.A. Spees J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

It is also known that a subset of proteins post-translationally modified in a vitamin K-dependent manner with γ-carboxylated glutamic acid (Gla), such as osteocalcin (OC) and matrix Gla protein (MGP), play a pivotal role in normal bone development and repair (9Cranenburg E.C. Schurgers L.J. Vermeer C. Thromb. Haemost. 2007; 98: 120-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). OC is the most abundant noncollagenous protein in bone, suggesting an important role in bone homeostasis. The physiologic role of the Gla-containing proteins in mineralized tissues is still a matter of debate. MGP is recognized as a potent inhibitor of the calcification of soft tissues, whereas OC is involved in the homeostatic regulation of bone mass (10Luo G. Ducy P. McKee M.D. Pinero G.J. Loyer E. Behringer R.R. Karsenty G. Nature. 1997; 386: 78-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (1764) Google Scholar, 11Ducy P. Desbois C. Boyce B. Pinero G. Story B. Dunstan C. Smith E. Bonadio J. Goldstein S. Gundberg C. Bradley A. Karsenty G. Nature. 1996; 382: 448-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (1405) Google Scholar). There is, however, little doubt that γ-carboxylation of these proteins and possibly others is essential for normal bone development, as is exemplified by the well described congenital bone defects observed in warfarin embryopathy (warfarin being a vitamin K antagonist blocking γ-carboxylation of proteins) (12Hall J.G. Pauli R.M. Wilson K.M. Am. J. Med. 1980; 68: 122-140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar). Since MSCs give rise to all nonhematopoietic cell lineages in the bone (stromal fibroblasts, osteocytes, chondrocytes, and adipocytes) and are also known to support hematopoiesis, we sought to identify which Gla-containing proteins are produced by these cells. To identify the Gla-containing proteins secreted by MSCs, we used a proteomic approach, which permitted an unbiased screening of the entire secretome of MSCs. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) analysis unambiguously identified periostin (PN) as the most abundant Gla-containing protein secreted by MSCs. This was a surprising and unexpected finding, since periostin is not known as a Gla-containing protein. We further show that βig-h3, another fasciclin I-like protein highly homologous to periostin, is also carboxylated. Thus, periostin is a member of a new family of Gla-containing proteins characterized by tandem repeat fasciclin-like domains with canonical carboxylase recognition sites (CRS) embedded in them. Antibodies, Reagents, and Cell Lines—Antibodies used were as follows: mouse anti-Gla (American Diagnostica Inc.), goat anti-murine periostin (R&D Systems) (this antibody also reacts with human periostin), anti-His (clone H3; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), and rabbit anti-mouse heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (generously provided by William Rigby (Dartmouth Medical School, Hanover, NH). The following were from Invitrogen (Molecular Probes): donkey anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 633 and donkey anti-goat Alexa Fluor 594. All reagents used were from Sigma unless otherwise specified. 293 cells and A549 cells were obtained from the ATCC. Murine MSC Isolation and Characterization—MSCs from 4-week-old C57Bl/6 mice (Harlan) were isolated as previously described (13Eliopoulos N. Stagg J. Lejeune L. Pommey S. Galipeau J. Blood. 2005; 106: 4057-4065Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Adherent cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Wisent) plus antibiotics and allowed to expand for at least five passages to obtain a homogenous population before being immunophenotyped by fluorescence-activated cell sorting using the following antibodies: anti-mouse CD31, CD44, CD45, CD73, and CD90. Multipotentiality was determined as described (13Eliopoulos N. Stagg J. Lejeune L. Pommey S. Galipeau J. Blood. 2005; 106: 4057-4065Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Vitamin K1 (7 μg/ml) was added to the media when stimulation of γ-carboxylation was needed. To block carboxylation, the cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum, antibiotics, and sodium warfarin (50 μm). Human MSC Culture and Differentiation—Passage two human MSCs from two different donors were obtained from the Tulane Center for Gene Therapy, where they were immunophenotyped and assessed for multipotentiality. The cells were cultured and differentiated according to the Center's instructions. Secretome Analysis—Murine MSCs or A549 cells were grown on a T75 tissue culture flask (Flacon) and allowed to expand to 80% confluence in the presence of vitamin K. The cells were then washed extensively with phosphate-buffered saline, and serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium was added. Conditioned medium (CM) was harvested after 48 h. After being 50-fold concentrated on an Amicon ultrafiltration unit (molecular weight cut-off 10,000 kDa; Millipore), the samples were precipitated with 80% cold acetone overnight, washed once with 100% cold acetone, air-dried, and redissolved in DeStreak rehydration solution (Amersham Biosciences). Protein concentration was determined using the two-dimensional Quant kit (Amersham Biosciences). Two-dimensional SDS-PAGE and Isoelectric Focusing—50 μg of total protein samples in 155 μl of Destreak rehydration buffer supplemented with 1% IPG buffer (3–10NL; Amersham Biosciences) were placed in ZOOM IPGRunner cassette chambers (Invitrogen). ZOOM dry strips (7 cm, pH range 3–10NL; Invitrogen) were then placed in the chambers, sealed, and left for rehydration for 16 h. The cassette was inserted in ZOOM IPGRunner (Invitrogen), and a voltage gradient (200–2000 V) was applied, as recommended by the manufacturer. A total of 2000 V-h was applied. After isoelectric focusing, strips were equilibrated with SDS using NuPAGE LDS sample buffer (1×; Invitrogen), reduced with 2% dithiothreitol (Amersham Biosciences), and alkylated with iodacetamide (Sigma). The procedure was done at room temperature for 15 min with each component (dithiothreitol and iodacetamide). Reduced and alkylated strips were placed on 4–12% gradient BisTris precast minigels (Invitrogen) and immobilized with 1% agarose. Second dimension separation was performed using the XCell Sure-Lock (Invitrogen) module. After completion of the run, one of the gels was fixed overnight in 50% methanol, 10% acetic acid fixation solution and stained with silver nitrate by modified Shevchenko's protocol. Gel image was acquired on ImageScanner (Amersham Biosciences). Sample Preparation for MS Analysis, Chromatography, and Mass Spectrometry—Images of silver-stained gel and anti-Gla immunoblot were superimposed, and the spots giving positive signals were selected. The spots were cut manually from the gel and subjected to trypsin digestion on robotic MassPREP Station (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Sample injection and HPLC separation was done using an Agilent 1100 series system. 20 μl of digest solution was loaded onto a Zorbax 300SB-C18 5 × 0.3-mm trapping column and washed for 5 min at 15 μl/min with 3% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid. Nano-HPLC peptide separation was done using a Biobasic C18 10 × 0.075-mm picofrit analytical column (New Objective). The gradient was 10% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid to 95% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid in 15 min at 200 nl/min. The instrument used for mass spectrometry was a QTRAP 4000 (Sciex-Applied Biosystems). Information-dependent MS/MS analysis was done on the three most intense ions selected from each full scan MS with dynamic exclusion for 90 s. The survey scan used was an enhanced MS scan from 3500 to 1600 m/z at 4000 atomic mass units/s using Dynamic Fill time. MS/MS data were acquired for three scans from 70 to 1700 m/z, using a fixed 25 ms trap fill time and with Q0 trapping activated. MS Data Base Search and Protein Sequence Alignments—Peaklists were generated with mascot distiller 1.1 (Matrix-science). Searches of sequences from the NCBInr data base using a rodent taxonomy filter (157,986 sequences) were performed with Mascot 1.9, using trypsin as digestion enzyme, carboxyamidomethylation of cysteines as fixed modification, methionine oxidation as variable modification, and 1.5-Da precursor and 0.8 Da fragment search tolerances. Protein sequences were obtained from NCBI, and alignments were performed using the CLC Free Workbench version 3.1.2 (available on the World Wide Web). Immunoprecipitation—30 μl of protein G-Sepharose Fast Flow (Sigma) was coupled with anti-Gla antibody or an isotypic control for 2 h. Concentrated CM was incubated with unconjugated protein G-Sepharose beads for 1 h. The precleared samples were then diluted in radioimmune precipitation buffer (Sigma) and boiled for 5 min to denature the proteins and dissociate protein complexes. After cooling on ice, samples were added to conjugated beads and incubated for 1–2 h. Beads were then washed extensively with radioimmune precipitation buffer and then phosphate-buffered saline. Antigen was dissociated by boiling the beads in sample buffer, and the immunoprecipitate was analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting using the anti-periostin antibody. Generation of His-PN-overexpressing 293 Cells—The human periostin cDNA fused to a hexahistidine tag cloned in the pcDNA3.1 plasmid was a generous gift from Dr. Xiao-Fan Wang (Duke University) (14Bao S. Ouyang G. Bai X. Huang Z. Ma C. Liu M. Shao R. Anderson R.M. Rich J.N. Wang X.F. Cancer Cell. 2004; 5: 329-339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). 293 cells were transfected with the plasmid using Polyfect reagent (Qiagen), and stable transfectants (293PN) were selected for using G418 sulfate (Wisent) at 650 μg/ml. Recombinant Periostin Purification—293PN cells were grown in the presence of vitamin K, and conditioned medium was collected and concentrated as above. Purification of recombinant His-tagged periostin under native or denaturing conditions was done on an Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid column (Novagen), as specified by the manufacturer. Barium Sulfate Precipitation of Periostin—40 mg/ml BaSO4 was added to concentrated CM from 293PN cells and incubated for 60 min at room temperature. The BaSO4 crystals were centrifuged briefly, and the pellet was washed three times with large volumes of cold 0.5 m sodium acetate. Carboxylated periostin was eluted using 0.17 m sodium citrate. Analysis of Periostin Produced by Osteoblasts—MSCs were differentiated into osteoblasts as above. When mineralized nodules covered 50% of the tissue culture vessel, serum-free CM was prepared as above. After collecting the CM, the calcified ECM was dissolved using 0.5 m EDTA and incubated for 30 min at room temperature with gentle shaking. The soluble fraction was centrifuged to remove cells, debris, and insoluble material for Western blotting. Immunostaining and Laser-scanning Confocal Imaging Analysis—MSCs were grown and differentiated into osteoblasts on coverslips. The immunofluorescence staining has been described elsewhere (15Levesque K. Halvorsen M. Abrahamyan L. Chatel-Chaix L. Poupon V. Gordon H. DesGroseillers L. Gatignol A. Mouland A.J. Traffic. 2006; 7: 1177-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100, and blocked with 10% dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline before being incubated with the primary antibodies and appropriate secondary fluorophore-conjugated antibodies. Images were acquired using a Zeiss LSM 5 PASCAL laser-scanning confocal microscope. Alexa Fluor 633 and 594 antibodies were scanned using excitation wavelengths of 633 and 543 nm, and emission spectra were filtered with 650-nm long pass and 560–615-nm band pass filters, respectively and sequentially. Three-dimensional Structural Modeling of Human Periostin—The crystal structure of fasciclin I (Protein Data Bank entry 1o70), which contains two domains, was used as the template for FAS1 and FAS2 as well as for FAS3 and FAS4. Based on sequence alignment, the structural fragment from Ala459 to Ala474 in the fasciclin I crystal structure (1o70) was used as a template for the region connecting domains FAS2 and FAS3. Next, 100 structural models of periostin were generated using the MODELLER version 8 software (University of California at San Francisco) (16Marti-Renom M.A. Stuart A.C. Fiser A. Sanchez R. Melo F. Sali A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2000; 29: 291-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (2597) Google Scholar). The structural model with the lowest objective function was selected for further analysis. Both the stereochemical quality and packing quality of the human periostin model were evaluated as excellent using software WHAT IF version 4.99 (Radboud University Nijmegen, Netherlands) (17Vriend G. J. Mol. Graph. 1990; 8: 52-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (3377) Google Scholar). Identification of Gla-containing Proteins Secreted by MSCs—To identify the γ-carboxylated proteins secreted by murine MSCs, we used a two-dimensional gel electrophoresis approach, which allowed screening the entire secretome. We expanded murine MSCs in the presence of vitamin K to 80% confluence, and serum-free CM was collected. Two parallel gels were made using the CM (Fig. 1A); one of them was transferred to a membrane and probed by Western blotting using an anti-Gla antibody (left), whereas the other was silver-stained (right). The images from the Western blot film and the silver-stained gel were overlaid, and positive spots on the silver-stained gel were cut out and analyzed by MS/MS. The major carboxylated protein (Fig. 1A, spot 2) seen by Western blot as well as a minor species (Fig. 1A, spot 1) migrated at ∼90 kDa. MS/MS analysis and Mascot search of those two spots yielded periostin as a high confidence hit with probability-based Mowse scores above 40. As shown in Fig. 1B, total ion score for spot 1 was 592, and eight of the 11 ions identified had scores above 40 (not shown). Importantly, the peptides identified covered most of the protein's length, with 17% total coverage. This increased our confidence in the positive identification of periostin. Periostin was also found in spot 2 (Fig. 1C), with identified ions covering 6% of the protein's total length and a total ion score of 192. Because of the strong signal in the anti-Gla immunoblot, spot 2 was difficult to excise precisely, and contaminants were simultaneously excised. This accounts for the low score and poor coverage obtained. The presence of periostin at two different isoelectric points (pI) probably reflects heterogeneity in the extent of γ-carboxylation. Taken together, these results identified periostin, a previously unrecognized vitamin K-dependent protein, as the major γ-carboxylated protein secreted by murine MSCs. In Silico Primary Sequence Analysis of Periostin—According to Furie et al. (18Furie B. Bouchard B.A. Furie B.C. Blood. 1999; 93: 1798-1808Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the CRS is both necessary and sufficient to drive γ-carboxylation of adjacent glutamic acid residues in a protein. When the CRS of known Gla-containing proteins are aligned, four amino acid residues are highly conserved, and the first two (a phenylalanine and an alanine) are most highly conserved. Therefore, we analyzed the published primary sequence of periostin (accession number NM_015784) and found a sequence that contained, properly organized, all of the important amino acids found in the CRS of the other known Gla-containing proteins (Fig. 2A). This sequence was positioned at the N terminus of the first fasciclin-like domain and was repeated (with some variability) in all four fasciclin domains (Fig. 2B). The CRS from the third fasciclin-like domain is the least well conserved. The observed molecular weight of periostin matches its predicted molecular weight, suggesting that periostin does not contain a CRS propeptide that is cleaved during protein maturation. Furthermore, this suggests that all four fasciclin-like domains in periostin may be carboxylated independently through their own CRS. γ-Carboxylation of Periostin by MSCs—To further confirm the presence of Gla on periostin, we immunoprecipitated proteins secreted by MSCs with the anti-Gla antibody or an isotypic control antibody. To ensure that we were not precipitating a Gla-containing protein to which periostin binds, we boiled the samples in the presence of detergents (radioimmune precipitation buffer) in order to denature them and break down protein complexes in conditions still amenable to antibody binding. In this case, the SDS present in the buffer prevents the boiled proteins from refolding, but the low concentration of detergents does not impede binding to antibodies. The immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blotting using the anti-periostin antibody. As shown in Fig. 3A, periostin could be immunoprecipitated with the anti-Gla antibody but not with the isotypic control antibody. We next examined whether we could purify recombinant carboxylated periostin. To do this, we obtained the human periostin cDNA fused to a hexahistidine tag, and we stably transfected 293 cells with this construct. The secretion of γ-carboxylated, His-tagged periostin from these 293PN cells was analyzed by Western blotting (Fig. 3B). The results demonstrate that only transfected cells produced detectable levels of His-tagged periostin and that this protein was most likely carboxylated. To confirm the latter, we purified recombinant PN using immobilized metal affinity chromatography. We ran the CM from the 293PN cells on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid His-bind column under both native and denaturing conditions. Surprisingly, only under denaturing conditions could the carboxylated variant of periostin be purified (Fig. 3C). This result indicates that carboxylation of periostin most likely induces conformational changes in the protein, making the His tag inaccessible for binding to nickel. One of the main characteristics of Gla residues is their ability to bind divalent metal cations, such as calcium, magnesium, and barium. This feature has been historically used for the purification of plasma-derived Gla-containing proteins, such as coagulation factor IX. In this case, barium salt crystals are used to precipitate Gla-containing proteins as a first step in protein purification. We thus examined whether barium sulfate could be used to precipitate periostin. Fig. 3D shows that carboxylated periostin does bind BaSO4 crystals with sufficient affinity to allow for its precipitation and thus possesses an affinity for divalent metal ions similar to that of other Gla-containing proteins. Finally, to demonstrate that the carboxylation of periostin was dependent on the presence of vitamin K, we expanded murine MSCs in medium supplemented with charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum, which removes most of the vitamin K present in fetal bovine serum, and in the presence of the vitamin K antagonist sodium warfarin. The MSCs grown under these conditions produced similar levels of periostin, but the protein was only poorly carboxylated (Fig. 3E), demonstrating that the post-translational modification is vitamin K-dependent. Periostin Expression and Carboxylation by Human MSCs—We next determined whether the carboxylation of periostin was also operative in human MSCs and their differentiated progenies of mesenchymal lineages in vitro. Human MSCs were obtained from two different donors and grown to confluence in 6-well plates. The cells were then differentiated to either osteocytic, adipocytic, or chondrocytic lineages by using standard differentiation media supplemented with vitamin K. Histological assessment of differentiation was performed, and CM was sampled. Representative results from one of the donors are presented in Fig. 4. We observed that cultures of undifferentiated human MSC do secrete periostin as did cultures induced to differentiate into adipocytes and osteoblasts (left). However, in cultures where chondrogenic differentiation was induced, no periostin expression could be detected at the protein level. Interestingly, secreted periostin appeared carboxylated in all instances except when produced by osteoblasts (right), although the latter secreted similar amounts of the protein. It is known that carboxylated OC tightly binds the calcium-rich extracellular matrix in bones (19Price P.A. Urist M.R. Otawara Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 117: 765-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 20Vermeer C. Jie K.S. Knapen M.H. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1995; 15: 1-22Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); therefore, we hypothesized that carboxylated periostin produced by osteoblasts would be sequestered within the calcified matrix and would not be detectable in the CM of those cells. To test this hypothesis, we collected CM from MSC-derived osteoblasts and also decalcified the mineralized matrix using the calcium chelator EDTA. The proteins released from the ECM by this treatment were analyzed by Western blotting (Fig. 4F). This finding shows that osteoblasts are able to carboxylate periostin but that the protein is sequestered within the ECM in a calcium-dependent manner. To confirm the presence of periostin in the mineralized matrix produced by osteoblasts, we performed confocal microscopy analysis of bone nodule formation by MSCs. Although we could detect intracellular periostin in the endoplasmic reticulum of cells both outside and inside the nodules (not shown), our data demonstrate extensive deposition of periostin only in the mineralized matrix of bone nodules in vitro (Fig. 4G). The adjacent extracellular matrix outside the nodules did not stain for periostin (Fig. 4H). It can also be noted that osteocytic cells throughout the nodule are embedded in a compact extracellular matrix, which stains densely for periostin (Fig. 4, I (at 11.7 μm within the nodule) and J). The donut shape of the staining observed for periostin on the bone nodule is probably due to the incapacity of the antibody to penetrate the highly mineralized nodule, since nuclei within this nodule also failed to stain with the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 antibody. Therefore, whether periostin locates only near the surface of the nodule or also within it remains to be determined. Three-dimensional Structural Modeling of Human Periostin—In order to obtain structural information about periostin, we built a tridimensional model of human periostin based on its homology with the insect fasciclin I protein, for which a crystal structure is available. The best fit model is presented in Fig. 5, where the four fasciclin domains are shown in different colors. There is, however, one major limitation to the model. Although the stereochemical quality and packing quality were evaluated as excellent, we cannot exclude the possibility that calcium binding to the Gla residues on periostin induces profound conformational changes in the tertiary structure of the protein. The model is nevertheless still useful to analyze the spatial organization of the protein before its modification by the carboxylase enzyme. The predicted model shows that all four CRS present in human periostin have a similar secondary structure consisting of a helix-turn-helix motif (shown as red ribbons in Fig. 5). This helical secondary structure is consistent with the secondary structure of the prothrombin CRS as assessed by NMR (21Sanford D.G. Kanagy C. Sudmeier J.L. Furie B.C. Furie B. Bachovchin W.W. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9835-9841Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Moreover, the model predicts that all four CRS are solvent-exposed and can thus interact with the γ-glutamyl carboxylase. This is particularly important, since γ-carboxylation is known to be a post-translational modification as opposed to a co-translational one. In Gla-containing proteins, the CRS is believed to be the primary docking site of the carbo"
https://openalex.org/W2011229547,"Heparanase is an endo-β-d-glucuronidase that degrades heparan sulfate in the extracellular matrix and on the cell surface. Human proheparanase is produced as a latent protein of 543 amino acids whose activation involves excision of an internal linker segment (Ser110–Gln157), yielding the active heterodimer composed of 8- and 50-kDa subunits. Applying cathepsin L knock-out tissues and cultured fibroblasts, as well as cathepsin L gene silencing and overexpression strategies, we demonstrate, for the first time, that removal of the linker peptide and conversion of proheparanase into its active 8 + 50-kDa form is brought about predominantly by cathepsin L. Excision of a 10-amino acid peptide located at the C terminus of the linker segment between two functional cathepsin L cleavage sites (Y156Q and Y146Q) was critical for activation of proheparanase. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry demonstrates that the entire linker segment is susceptible to multiple endocleavages by cathepsin L, generating small peptides. Mass spectrometry demonstrated further that an active 8-kDa subunit can be generated by several alternative adjacent endocleavages, yielding the precise 8-kDa subunit and/or slightly elongated forms. Altogether, the mode of action presented here demonstrates that processing and activation of proheparanase can be brought about solely by cathepsin L. The critical involvement of cathepsin L in proheparanase processing and activation offers new strategies for inhibiting the prometastatic, proangiogenic, and proinflammatory activities of heparanase.

Mass spectrometry demonstrated further that an active 8-kDa subunit can be generated by several alternative adjacent endocleavages, yielding the precise 8-kDa subunit and/or slightly elongated forms. Altogether, the mode of action presented here demonstrates that processing and activation of proheparanase can be brought about solely by cathepsin L. The critical involvement of cathepsin L in proheparanase processing and activation offers new strategies for inhibiting the prometastatic, proangiogenic, and proinflammatory activities of heparanase. Heparanase is an endo-β-d-glucuronidase that degrades heparan sulfate side chains of heparan sulfate proteoglycans (1Parish C.R. Freeman C. Hulett M.D. Biochim. Biophys.

Heparanase activity has been traditionally correlated with cell invasion associated with cancer metastasis, a consequence of structural modifications that loosen the ECM barrier (5Nakajima M.

Cancer Res. 1983; 43: 2704-2711PubMed Google Scholar). This notion gained further support by employing siRNA and ribosome technologies, clearly demonstrating heparanase-mediated heparan sulfate cleavage and ECM remodeling as a critical prerequisite for cancer metastasis, angiogenesis, and inflammation (7Edovitsky E. Lerner I. Zcharia E. Peretz T. Vlodavsky I. Elkin M. Blood. 2006; 107: 3609-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar).

In many cases, heparanase induction correlates with increased tumor metastasis, tumor vascular density, and shorter postoperative survival of cancer patients, providing strong clinical support for the pro-metastatic and pro-angiogenic functions of the enzyme (3Ilan N.

Until now, the mode of processing and the fate of the internal linker segment (Ser110–Gln157) were only partially elucidated (13Abboud-Jarrous G. Rangini-Guetta Z. Aingorn H. Atzmon R. Elgavish S.

Mutagenesis at site 1 and its flanking sequences failed to identify critical residues for proteolytic cleavage, whereas processing at site 2 required a bulky hydrophobic amino acid (Tyr156) at position P2 of the cleavage site (13Abboud-Jarrous G.

The critical involvement of Tyr156 in accurate cleavage at site 2 and the inhibitory effect of a cell permeable inhibitor of cathepsin L implicate a cathepsin L-like proteolytic activity in the processing of proheparanase (13Abboud-Jarrous G.

Cathepsin L, a papain-like cysteine proteinase, is synthesized as a preproenzyme (17Nomura T. Fujisawa Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 230: 143-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The prepeptide is removed in the endoplasmic reticulum and the pro-enzyme undergoes autoactivation in the acidic environment of late endosomes and/or lysosomes. The mature form is stored within lysosomes where it functions as an endopeptidase (17Nomura T. Fujisawa Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 230: 143-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In addition to its role in terminal protein degradation inside lysosomes, cathepsin L is implicated in multiple physiological and pathological processes (18Turk B. Turk D. Turk V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1477: 98-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar), primarily by virtue of its involvement in pro-enzyme processing and protein maturation (19Britton C. Murray L. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 5133-5143Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). For example, in the thymic cortex, cathepsin L plays a key role in cleaving the CLIP peptide thereby allowing for antigen presentation in the context of major histocompatibility complex class II molecules (20Nakagawa T. Roth W. Wong P. Nelson A. Farr A. Deussing J. Villadangos J.A. Ploegh H. Peters C. Rudensky A.Y. Science. 1998; 280: 450-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). Cathepsin L within secretory vesicles is responsible for the generation of several peptide neurotransmitters and hormones, including enkephalin, β-endorphin, and ACTH (21Yasothornsrikul S. Aaron W.

Recently, a cathepsin L isoform that lacks a signal peptide was reported to function in processing of the CDP/Cux transcription factor and thereby in cell cycle regulation (24Goulet B. Baruch A.

Moreover, cathepsin L and other cysteine proteases have been implicated in tumor development and progression through degradation of protein constituents of the plasma membrane and the ECM (25Gocheva V.

It was recently shown that deletion of cathepsin L in the RIP1-Tag2 (RT2) mouse model of pancreatic islet cell tumorigenesis resulted in a profound reduction in tumor growth (average decrease of 88%), and a significant impairment in tumor invasion (25Gocheva V.

The present study was undertaken to characterize the mechanism of proheparanase processing. Applying cathepsin L knock-out fibroblasts and cathepsin L gene silencing and overexpression strategies, we demonstrate that conversion of proheparanase into its active form is brought about almost exclusively by cathepsin L. Furthermore, the precise mode of action of cathepsin L in proheparanase processing was elucidated in a cell-free system. Cell Culture—Human breast carcinoma MDA-MB-435 and MCF-7 cells (8Cohen I.

Antibodies—Polyclonal rabbit anti-human hepararanase antibody (pAb 1453) was raised against the full-length 65-kDa proheparanase and affinity purified, as described (33Zetser A. Bashenko Y. Miao H.Q.

Polyclonal antibody 810 (pAb 810) and anti-CKLE were raised in rabbit against synthetic peptides residing in the 8-kDa subunit (96GTKTDFLIFDPKK108) or the linker segment (127CKYGSIPPDVEEKLRLE143), respectively. Monoclonal antibody (CPLH-2D4) directed against procathepsin L was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (catalog number sc-32801, Santa Cruz, CA). Monoclonal antibodies directed against mature cathepsin L (clone 33/2, ascites fluid, catalog number C2970) and against α-tubulin (clone B-5-1-2, catalog number T6074) were purchased from Sigma. Preparation of Dishes Coated with ECM—Bovine corneal endothelial cells (second to fifth passage) were plated into 35-mm tissue culture dishes at an initial density of 2 × 105 cells/ml and cultured as described above, except that 4% dextran T-40 was included in the growth medium. Na 352SO4 (25 mCi/ml) (Amersham Biosciences, Buckinghamshire, UK) was added on days 2 and 5 after seeding and the cultures were incubated with the label without medium change. On day 12, the subendothelial ECM was exposed by dissolving the cell layer with PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and 20 mm NH4OH, followed by four washes with PBS (6Vlodavsky I. Fuks Z. Bar-Ner M.

The ECM remained intact, free of cellular debris and firmly attached to the entire area of the tissue culture dish. Heparanase Activity—Cells were lysed by three cycles of freezing and thawing in heparanase reaction solution (0.15 NaCl, 20 mm phosphate citrate buffer, pH 5.8, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm CaCl2). Cell lysates were incubated (24 h, 37 °C, pH 5.8) with 35S-labeled ECM. The medium was centrifuged and the supernatant containing sulfate-labeled degradation fragments was analyzed by gel filtration on Sepharose CL-6B column (0.9 × 30 cm).

Nearly intact heparan sulfate proteoglycans are eluted just after the V0 (Kav < 0.2, peak I) (6Vlodavsky I. Fuks Z. Bar-Ner M. Ariav Y. Schirrmacher V.

For detection of heparanase, samples containing up to 1 mg of total protein were first added to a mixture of 30 μl of heparin-agarose beads and 30 μl of concanavalin A-agarose beads (Sigma) and incubated with rotation for 2 h at room temperature, followed by overnight incubation at 4 °C. Beads were then washed twice with saline, boiled (7 min) in sample buffer, and the supernatants were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting, as described above. Generation of Heparanase Deletion Mutant—Deletion mutant of human heparanase cDNA was constructed according to site-specific mutagenesis by the overlap extension approach (13Abboud-Jarrous G.

Two fragments were amplified in two separate PCR using the full-length heparanase cDNA as a template. PCR 1 amplified the fragment that contains the deletion mutation together with the upstream sequence, utilizing a reverse primer containing the deletion mutation and a common forward primer containing the wild-type heparanase sequence (1UERI-hpa). PCR 2 amplified the DNA fragment that contains the deletion mutation together with downstream sequences, utilizing the forward primer containing the deletion mutation and a common reverse primer containing the wild-type heparanase sequence (4LHpa). The two PCR purified fragments (JETquick gel extraction spin kit, Genomed, Lohne, Germany) were mixed, denatured, annealed, and extended, and the product was amplified in a third PCR, using the 1UERIhpa and 4Lhpa primers. The PCR 3 product was subcloned into pcDNA3-Hepa (containing the full-length heparanase) digested with EcoRI and AflII using the TaKaRa DNA ligation kit II (Takara Bio Inc., Shiga, Japan).

MDA-MB-435 breast carcinoma or JAR choriocarcinoma cells were seeded into 6-well plates and grown in 2.5 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. After 24 h in culture, MDA-MB-435 (20–30% confluent) cells were transfected with 25 μl of 20 μm stock solution of siRNA duplexes (0.2 μm final concentration) using the GeneSilencer siRNA transfection reagent kit, according to the manufacturer's protocol (Genlantis, San Diego, CA). Forty-eight h later, the cells were re-transfected with another dose of siRNA and incubated for an additional 48 h. JAR cells were transfected with cathepsin L siRNA as described above and 24 h later were retransfected with siRNA plus pcDNA containing the full-length heparanase or empty vector. The cells were harvested by a rubber policeman, solubilized in lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors, and subjected to Western blot analysis and heparanase activity assay, as described above. Mass Spectrometry—Recombinant, full-length proheparanase, or linker-truncated 50 + 8-kDa linear heparanase (hepa-3GS), generated by replacing the linker segment with a spacer of three glycine-serine pairs (15Nardella C. Lahm A. Pallaoro M. Brunetti M. Vannini A. Steinkuhler C. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 1862-1873Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), were incubated in 100 mm Tris buffer, pH 6.8, supplemented with 8 mm EDTA and 4 mm DTT, for 80 min at 37 °C, with or without human liver-derived cathepsin L (Sigma). The reaction mixtures were purified on high performance liquid chromatography reverse-phase C18 column and subjected to matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass analysis. Masses of peptides (P1–P13) determined by MALDI-TOF corresponded to the calculated masses (±20 δ) of peptides derived from the linker segment and adjacent portions of the 8-kDa subunit, taking into account phosphorylation modifications on particular tyrosines, serines, and threonines. The peptides (P1–P13), their corresponding sequences and calculated masses (see Fig. 6) (including additional 80 δ for each phosphate group) were: P1, QD1... E110, 8246 δ; P2, QD1...

Knockdown of Cathepsin L Markedly Suppresses Proheparanase Processing—To investigate the role of cathepsin L in proheparanase processing, we utilized siRNA mediated silencing of cathepsin L (34Zheng X.

Enrichment occurs via mechanisms that include polarized secretion from recycling endosomes, but the Rabs and RabGAPs that regulate this are unknown. EPI64C (TBC1D10C) is an uncharacterized candidate RabGAP we identified by mass spectrometry as abundant in human peripheral blood T cells that is preferentially expressed in hematopoietic cells. EPI64C is a Rab35-GAP based both on in vitro Rab35-specific GAP activity and findings in transfection assays. EPI64C and Rab35 dominant negative (DN) constructs each impaired transferrin export from a recycling pathway in Jurkat T-cells and induced large vacuoles marked by transferrin receptor, TCR, and SNAREs implicated in TCR-polarized secretion. Rab35 localized to the plasma membrane and to intracellular vesicles where it substantially colocalized with TfR and with TCR. Rab35 was strongly recruited to the IS. Conjugate formation was impaired by transfection with Rab35-DN or EPI64C and by EPI64C knock down. TCR enrichment at the IS was impaired by Rab35-DN. Thus, EPI64C and Rab35 regulate a recycling pathway in T cells and contribute to IS formation, most likely by participating in TCR transport to the IS."

https://openalex.org/W2036713710,"Manipulation of quantum interference requires that the system under control remains coherent, avoiding (or at least postponing) the phase randomization that can ensue from coupling to an uncontrolled environment. We show that closed-loop coherent control can be used to mitigate the rate of quantum dephasing in a gas-phase ensemble of potassium dimers (K2), which acts as a model system for testing the general concepts of controlling decoherence. Specifically, we adaptively shaped the light pulse used to prepare a vibrational wave packet in electronically excited K2, with the amplitude of quantum beats in the fluorescence signal used as an easily measured surrogate for the purpose of optimizing coherence. The optimal pulse increased the beat amplitude from below the noise level to well above it, and thereby increased the coherence life time as compared with the beats produced by a transform-limited pulse. Closed-loop methods can thus effectively identify states that are robust against dephasing without any previous information about the system-environment interaction."

https://openalex.org/W1989773128,"Phase slips and dissipation in a clean and well characterized system (ultracold atoms trapped in an optical lattice) are studied. The results clarify the role of phase slips in superfluid systems and may be of relevance for understanding dissipation in other bosonic systems. Phase-slips control dissipation in many bosonic systems, determining the critical velocity of superfluid helium1 and the generation of resistance in thin superconducting wires2. Technological interest has been largely motivated by applications involving nanoscale superconducting circuit elements, such as standards based on quantum phase-slip junctions3. Although phase slips caused by thermal fluctuations at high temperatures are well understood4, controversy remains over the role of phase slips in small-scale superconductors5—in solids, problems such as uncontrolled noise sources and disorder complicate their study and application6. Here we show that phase slips can lead to dissipation in a clean and well-characterized Bose–Hubbard system, by experimentally studying the transport of ultracold atoms trapped in an optical lattice. In contrast to previous work, we explore a low-velocity regime described by the three-dimensional Bose–Hubbard model that is unaffected by instabilities, and we measure the effect of temperature on the dissipation strength. The damping rate of atomic motion (the analogue of electrical resistance in a solid) in the confining parabolic potential is well fitted by a model that includes finite damping at zero temperature. The low-temperature behaviour is consistent with the theory of quantum tunnelling of phase slips, whereas at higher temperatures a crossover consistent with a transition to thermal activation of phase slips is evident. Motion-induced features reminiscent of vortices and vortex rings associated with phase slips are also observed in time-of-flight imaging. These results clarify the role of phase slips in superfluid systems. They may also be of relevance in understanding the source of metallic phases observed in thin films7,8, or serve as a test bed for theories of bosonic dissipation based upon variants of the Bose–Hubbard model9."
https://openalex.org/W1989473569,"Polycomb group (PcG) proteins form two distinct complexes, PRC1 and PRC2, to regulate developmental target genes by maintaining the epigenetic state in cells. PRC2 methylates histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27), and PRC1 then recognizes methyl-H3K27 to form repressive chromatin. However, it remains unknown how PcG proteins maintain stable and plastic chromatin during cell division. Here we report that PcG-associated chromatin is reproduced in the G(1) phase in post-mitotic cells and is required for subsequent S phase progression. In dividing cells, H3K27 trimethylation (H3K27Me(3)) marked mitotic chromosome arms where PRC2 (Suz12 and Ezh2) co-existed, whereas PRC1 (Bmi1 and Pc2) appeared in distinct foci in the pericentromeric regions. As each PRC complex was increasingly assembled from mitosis to G(1) phase, PRC1 formed H3K27Me(3)-based chromatin intensively during middle and late G(1) phase; this chromatin was highly resistant to in situ nuclease treatment. Thus, the transition from mitosis to G(1) phase is crucial for PcG-mediated chromatin inheritance. Knockdown of Suz12 markedly reduced the amount of H3K27Me(3) on mitotic chromosomes, and as a consequence, PRC1 foci were not fully transmitted to post-mitotic daughter cells. S phase progression was markedly delayed in these Suz12-knockdown cells. The fact that PcG-associated chromatin is reproduced during post-mitotic G(1) phase suggests the possibility that PcG proteins enable their target chromatin to be remodeled in response to stimuli in the G(1) phase."

We tested the hypothesis that incorporation of local, sustained growth factor delivery could enhance and accelerate this effect. Tissue engineering scaffolds often use synthetic polymers to enable controlled release of proteins, but most synthetic delivery systems have major limitations, most notably hydrophobicity and inefficient protein loading. Here, we report the development of a novel alginate-based delivery system for vascular endothelial growth factor-A(165) (VEGF) that exhibits superior loading efficiency and physical properties to previous systems in vitro. In vivo, VEGF released from alginate microparticles within protein gels was biologically active and, when combined with EC transplantation, led to increased survival of transplanted cells at 28 days. The composite graft described also improved early (14 days) tissue perfusion and late (28 days) muscle myoglobin expression, a sign of recovery from ischemia, compared with EC transplantation and VEGF delivery separately. We conclude that our improved approach to sustained VEGF delivery in tissue engineering is useful in vivo and that the integration of high efficiency protein delivery enhances the therapeutic effect of protein gel-based EC transplantation."

https://openalex.org/W2023602510,"Syndecan 1 is the major proteoglycan produced by epithelial cells. It is strategically localized at the plasma membrane to participate in growth factor signaling and cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. Its expression may modulate the properties of epithelial lineage tumor cells in which it is generally down-regulated compared with nontumor progenitors. The present study examined the regulation of syndecan 1 in prostate epithelial cells by n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids. In prostate tissue of mice, syndecan 1 immunostaining was demonstrated in epithelial cells throughout each gland. In animals fed an n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid-enriched diet, syndecan 1 mRNA was increased in all prostate glands. In the human prostate cancer cell line, PC-3, delivery of exogenous n-3 (but not n-6) fatty acids resulted in up-regulation of syndecan 1 expression. This effect was mimicked by a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) gamma agonist, troglitazone, and inhibited in the presence of a PPARgamma antagonist and in cells transfected with dominant negative PPARgamma cDNA. Using a luciferase gene driven either by a PPAR response element or by a DR-1 site present in the syndecan 1 promoter, reporter activation was increased by n-3 low density lipoprotein, docosahexaenoic acid, and troglitazone, whereas activity of a luciferase gene placed downstream of a mutant DR-1 site was unresponsive. These findings indicate that syndecan 1 is up-regulated by n-3 fatty acids by a transcriptional pathway involving PPARgamma. This mechanism may contribute to the chemopreventive properties of n-3 fatty acids in prostate cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2083915058,"Type VII collagen (C7) is a major component of anchoring fibrils, structures that mediate epidermal-dermal adherence. Mutations in gene COL7A1 encoding for C7 cause dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (DEB), a genetic mechano-bullous disease. The biological consequences of specific COL7A1 mutations and the molecular mechanisms leading to DEB clinical phenotypes are unknown. In an attempt to establish genotype-phenotype relationships, we generated four individual substitution mutations that have been associated with recessive DEB, G2049E, R2063W, G2569R, and G2575R, and purified the recombinant mutant proteins. All mutant proteins were synthesized and secreted as a 290-kDa mutant C7 alpha chain at levels similar to wild type C7. The G2569R and G2575R glycine substitution mutations resulted in mutant C7 with increased sensitivity to protease degradation and decreased ability to form trimers. Limited proteolytic digestion of mutant G2049E and R2063W proteins yielded aberrant fragments and a triple helix with reduced stability. These two mutations next to the 39-amino acid helical interruption hinge region caused local destabilization of the triple-helix that exposed an additional highly sensitive proteolytic site within the region of the mutation. Our functional studies demonstrated that C7 is a potent pro-motility matrix for skin human keratinocyte migration and that this activity resides within the triple helical domain. Furthermore, G2049E and R2063W mutations reduced the ability of C7 to support fibroblast adhesion and keratinocyte migration. We conclude that known recessive DEB C7 mutations perturb critical functions of the C7 molecule and likely contribute to the clinical phenotypes of DEB patients."

The specific features of spermiogenesis include the formation of the tail, mitochondria, and acrosome, nuclear condensation, and the elimination of spermatid cytoplasm. To understand haploid germ cell differentiation fully, i.e. spermiogenesis, it is important to identify and characterize specific genes expressed during these developmental processes (1Nishimune Y.

Specifically, MCA protein is localized predominantly in the cytoplasm of cells throughout the stages of sperm development, i.e. from pachytene spermatocytes to round spermatids, as well as in the regions of metaphase chromosomes and spindles during both the first and second meiotic divisions (2Tsuchida J. Nishina Y. Wakabayashi N. Nozaki M. Sakai Y. Nishimune Y. Dev. Biol. 1998; 197: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar).

However, MCA consists of a hydrophilic amino acid region, whereas JPs have a C-terminal hydrophobic segment spanning the endoplasmic/sarcoplasmic reticulum and are expressed abundantly in a variety of tissues (3Takeshima H.

Here we demonstrated that MCA is expressed in cytoplasm spermatids and is dominantly localized in the outer dense fibers of the flagellum. In addition, mice deficient in MCA exhibit male infertility and azoospermia because of impaired sperm formation. We used single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) studies to identify two SNPs that induce amino acid substitutions in azoospermic or oligospermic infertile human males. It is possible that SNPs in MCA are related to human infertility. Animals—All mice were bred and maintained in our laboratory animal facilities and used in accordance with the guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals set forth by the Japanese Association for Laboratory Animal Science. The mice were kept under controlled temperature and lighting conditions throughout the experiments and were provided with food and water ad libitum. Northern Blots—Total RNA was isolated from various mouse tissues using RNA zolTM B (Invitrogen). Total RNA was extracted according to the manufacturer's instructions and was quantified using optical density measurements. RNA samples containing 2.2 m formaldehyde were electrophoresed in 1.1% agarose gels containing 0.66 m formaldehyde. The RNA was transferred to a nitrocellulose filter in 20× SSC and hybridized with 32P-labeled cDNA prepared using the BcaBest random primer kit (Takara, Shiga, Japan) at 65 °C for 2 h in a PerfectHyb (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan). Western Blots—Testes freshly removed from mice were homogenized on ice with TBS-T buffer (100 mmol/liter Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mmol/liter NaCl, 0.2% Tween 20). After centrifugation at 17,800 × g, the protein concentration of the supernatant was estimated using a Bradford protein assay (Nacalai, Kyoto, Japan). Following protein quantification, 50 μg of protein from each extract were subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by electroblotting to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk and washed for 15 min with TBS (100 mmol/liter Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mmol/liter NaCl). They were then incubated with each antibody overnight at 4 °C and washed in TBS once for 3 min and then three times for 5 min each. Finally, the membranes were incubated with peroxidaseconjugated anti-rat or anti-rabbit immunoglobulins (1:500; Amersham Biosciences) for 2 h at 25 °C. After further washing, the reactive bands were visualized on development with the POD staining kit (Wako, Osaka, Japan). Immunoprecipitation—Testicular fractions were lysed with RIPA (10 mmol/liter Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mmol/liter NaCl, 0.1% deoxycholic acid, 0.3% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.5 ml/liter protease inhibitor mixture; Nacalai). Each antibody was added to Dynabeads-protein G (Invitrogen), washed once with PBS, and then washed three times with PBS containing 0.01% Tween 20 as per the manufacturer's recommendations. The lysates were then centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. Glycerol was added to the supernatants at a concentration of 10%. The Dynabeads-protein G was treated with the lysates at 4 °C overnight and was then washed with PBS containing 10% glycerol and 0.1% Tween 20. SDS sample buffer was added to the Dynabeads-protein G, and each sample was subjected to Western blotting. Mouse Sperm Protein Fractionation—Sperm was collected from 10 mice using Percoll (9Bellve A.R. Zheng W. Martinova Y.S. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 225: 113-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and was fractionated according to a previously described adapted protocol (10Olson G.E. Hamilton D.W. Fawcett D.W. Biol. Reprod. 1976; 14: 517-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Briefly, sperm was washed from the epididymis and vas deferens and subjected to three sequential extractions at 4 °C in 500 μl of a solution containing 1% Triton X-100 and 2 mm dithiothreitol in 50 mm sodium borate buffer at pH 9.0 for 40 min each. After each extraction, the samples were centrifuged at 400 × g using a Tomy MRX-150 centrifuge (Tomy, Tokyo, Japan), and the supernatants were collected (membrane soluble fractions: M1, M2, and M3). The pellet was washed three times with 50 mm sodium borate buffer and suspended in 500 μl of a solution of 0.6 m potassium thiocyanate (KSCN), 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, for 2 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation at 800 × g, the supernatant was collected (central axoneme (Ax) fraction), and the pellet was extracted overnight at 4 °C in 500 μl of a solution containing 4 m urea, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 2 mm dithiothreitol. A final centrifugation at 17,800 × g was performed to separate the urea-extracted fraction (urea fraction, ODF). Finally, the resulting nonextracted pellet was washed in borate buffer three times, suspended in sperm extraction buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, and 5% mercaptoethanol), and sonicated on ice for 10 min (fibrous sheath/head fraction: FS/H). The protein concentration of each fraction (i.e. M1, M2, M3, Ax, ODF, and FS/H) was estimated using the Bradford protein assay (Nacalai). Fractions M3, Ax, and ODF were precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid. Approximately 20 μg of protein from each fraction was separated by SDS-PAGE in 10% polyacrylamide gels. Western blotting was performed as described above. Control antibodies for the membrane (anti-Izumo1) (11Inoue N. Ikawa M. Isotani A. Okabe M.

Immunohistochemistry of Sperm—Mouse sperm from the vas deferens and caudal epididymis suspended in PBS was filtered through a nylon mesh and centrifuged at 400 × g. The pellet was then washed in PBS, and a few drops were placed on glass slides and dried at 55 °C for 10 min. The slides were blocked with 10% blocking solution (Nacalai) whole serum in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. The drying and blocking conditions were kept the same for all immunohistochemical procedures. Blocked samples were incubated with anti-MCA antibodies (10μg/μl IgG) or preimmune serum IgG, both diluted in PBS (1000×), overnight at 4 °C. After one wash, the slides were treated with diluted (1000×) anti-rabbit IgG goat serum conjugated with rhodamine or fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) for 1 h at room temperature. The slides were then washed and examined under a fluorescence microscope. Triton X-100-and urea-treated sperm obtained from the fractionation of sperm proteins were also examined immunohistochemically using the same protocol. To visualize individual fibers of the ODF, mature sperm was treated for 1 h at room temperature with a solution containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, 30 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.05% cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), which is a cationic detergent that, under reducing conditions, extracts all tail structures except for the Odfs, which are released from the tight native form (14Vera J.C. Brito M. Zuvic T. Burzio L.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5970-5977Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Co-localization of MCA with Odf2 protein was accomplished by incubating intact and CTAB-treated sperm with anti-MCA antibodies that had been conjugated to rhodamine with an EZ-label rhodamine protein labeling kit (Pierce) for 1 h at room temperature. After a thorough wash in PBS, the samples were incubated with anti-Odf2 rabbit polyclonal antibodies for 2 h at room temperature, washed in PBS, and treated with FITC-conjugated diluted rabbit IgG antibody (2000×) for 1 h at room temperature. Generation of MCA Targeting Mouse—The MCA-targeting construct was created by PCR amplification of a homologous 4-kb 5′ arm and 1-kb 3′ arm using 129Sv genomic DNA as the template. Targeting at the MCA genomic locus resulted in the replacement of exons 1-3 with a neomycin cassette. Two amplified fragments were ligated sequentially into cloning sites on either side of the neomycin resistance gene in the targeting vector backbone. The targeting vector contained the neomycin resistance gene and a thymidine kinase gene, both under the control of the PGK promoter. The vector plasmid was linearized by NotI digestion before electroporation into W9.5 embryonic stem cells. Of 144 G418 gancyclovir-resistant clones that were screened for the targeting event, Southern blotting showed that two had undergone the correct homologous recombination. The two targeted cell lines were injected into C57BL/6J blastocysts, resulting in the birth of male chimeric mice. Highly chimeric males were mated with C57BL/6J wild-type females to generate F1 offspring, half of which were heterozygous for the targeted allele. The embryonic stem cell lines were injected and produced a high percentage of chimeras that entered the germ line. Heterozygous F1 males were then crossed with C57BL/6J females to obtain heterozygous F2 animals. Heterozygous F2 animals were bred to obtain homozygous mutants or to check the Mendelian inheritance. Eight mice older than 3 months were used to determine the fertility rate. The phenotypic variation was assessed, and biochemical analyses were conducted on samples from at least six individuals. Southern Blotting and PCR—Genomic DNA was extracted from mouse tails using standard protocols (15Sambrook J. Fritsch E. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 9.14-9.56Google Scholar). Southern blots were conducted to determine the site of the integration of the gene trap sequence in the MCA gene locus and to genotype the mice. A 700-bp probe for genomic Southern blotting was generated by PCR amplification from mouse genomic DNA. Genomic DNA samples (10 μg) were digested with ScaI and electrophoresed in 0.8% agarose gels. Southern hybridizations were carried out using standard protocols (15Sambrook J. Fritsch E. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 9.14-9.56Google Scholar). The mice were genotyped by PCR using two sets of primers (see supplemental Fig. S1) as follows: one set of primers (5′-GGAGTAGCAAGTGATGTCAGGTCC-3′ and 5′-GAGTAACCTGAGGCTATGGCAGG-3′) to amplify the Neo gene and one set of primers (5′-CTATCAAGCAGTTACCAGCCACCC-3′ and 5′-GCAGAGGGAGCGAGGCTCAGCACATGG-3′) for the MCA gene. Morphological and Immunohistochemical Observations—For the histochemical examination, fresh testis samples were embedded in O.T.C. compound embedding medium (Sakura Finetek, Tokyo, Japan) and frozen at -20 °C. Then 8-μm thick sections were prepared using a cryomicrotome (HM 500 OM; Microm, Walldorf, Germany) and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) at 4 °C for 10 min. Alternatively, testis samples were fixed in Bouin's solution for 24 h. After fixation, the samples were embedded in paraffin and sectioned at 8-μm thickness. Deparaffinized sections and frozen sections were incubated with the anti-MCA antibody (10 μg/μl IgG) or preimmune serum IgG, both diluted in PBS (1000×) overnight at 4 °C. After one wash, the slides were treated with diluted (1000×) anti-rabbit IgG goat serum conjugated with horseradish peroxidase for 1 h at room temperature. The slides were then washed and visualized by development with the POD immunostain kit (Wako, Osaka, Japan). Sections were treated with each antibody or stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Morphological identification of spermatogenic cells was based on the criteria of Russell et al. (16Russell L.D. Ettlin R.A. Sinha H.A.P. Clegg E.D. Histological and Histopathological Evaluation of the Testis, Cache River Press, Clearwater, FL1990: 120-162Google Scholar). The number of seminiferous tubules that sloughed spermatocytes or spermatids into the lumen was counted for 35 tubules of heterozygous or homozygous mutant mice. For electron microscopy, the testis was perfused with 3% glutaraldehyde in HEPES buffer (10 mm HEPES and 145 mm NaCl). After post-fixation with 1% osmium tetroxide, the testis was embedded in Epon. Selected areas were then sectioned and examined. Detection of Apoptosis—To identify apoptotic cells, we performed immunostaining with anti-active caspase 3 antibody (Promega, Madison, WI) and terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL) staining using an in situ apoptosis detection kit (Takara) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The number of TUNEL-positive signals was counted for 20 seminiferous tubules of heterozygous or homozygous mutant mice. To identify Sertoli cells, we used anti-GATA 4 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). For immunostaining by anti-active caspase 3 and GATA 4, sections of testis fixed in 4% PFA were treated with an antigen unmasking solution (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Immunostaining was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Testicular Sperm Extraction with Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection (TESE-ICSI)—Testis was placed in cold HEPES-CZB, and the tunica albuginea was removed. The bundles of seminiferous tubules were carefully separated using forceps. The separated tubules were examined under a dissecting microscope. Mature sperm was squeezed out from regions of the tubules that were darkened in the innermost part using forceps (17Kotaja N. Kimmins S. Brancorsini S. Hentsch D. Vonesch J.L. Davidson I. Parvinen M. Sassone-Corsi P. Nat. Methods. 2004; 1: 249-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 18Tohda A. Okuno T. Matsumiya K. Okabe M. Kishikawa H. Dohmae K. Okuyama A. Nishimune Y. Biol. Reprod. 2002; 66: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The sperm was suspended in 12% polyvinyl pyrrolidone in HEPES-CZB and injected into the cytoplasm of unfertilized eggs using a piezo-driven micromanipulator (Prime Tech, Ibaraki, Japan) within 1 h of preparation (19Kimura Y. Yanagimachi R. Biol. Reprod. 1995; 52: 709-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar, 20Ho Y. Wigglesworth K. Eppig J.J. Schultz R.M. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1995; 41: 232-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). The injected eggs were cultivated in kSOM (20Ho Y. Wigglesworth K. Eppig J.J. Schultz R.M. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1995; 41: 232-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar) overnight and then transferred to the oviducts of pseudopregnant females. Serum Testosterone—Serum testosterone was measured using an enzyme immunoassay (testosterone enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit, catalog number 1880, Alpha Diagnostics, San Antonio, TX). Identification of SNPs in the Open Reading Frame of MCA—Infertile patients (n = 245) were divided into subgroups according to the degree of defective spermatogenesis (21Tanaka H. Miyagawa Y. Tsujimura A. Matsumiya K. Okuyama A. Nishimune Y. Mol. Hum. Reprod. 2003; 9: 69-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Of these patients, 153 (68%) had nonobstructive azoospermia and 73 (32%) had severe oligospermia (<5 × 106 cells/ml). The control group of fertile males (n = 172) included men who had fathered children born at the maternity clinic. DNA samples were extracted from the blood leukocytes of the infertile and proven-fertile males. Genomic DNA was isolated from the blood samples using protease and phenol purification (15Sambrook J. Fritsch E. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 9.14-9.56Google Scholar). Eight PCR primer sets were designed to amplify the exons of MCA genes (see supplemental Tables S1 and S2 and supplemental Fig. S2). PCR was performed using Prime-STAR or EX Taq hot start (Takara) (see supplemental Table S2). The PCR-amplified fragments were purified using CleanSEQ (Beckman Coulter, Tokyo, Japan), and thermal cycle sequencing (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) was performed. The DNA sequences were determined using the same PCR primers. Statistical Analysis—Differences between the experimental and control conditions were compared using one-way analysis of variance with Fisher's protected least significant difference tests. Significant differences (p < 0.05) are discussed. MCA Homozygous Mutant Males Are Azoospermic—To investigate the physiological role of MCA, we generated homozygous MCA knock-out mice. We constructed the targeting vector (Fig. 1A), and homologous recombination was used to generate embryonic stem cell clones that were heterozygous for the MCA mutation. To produce chimeric mice, transgenic embryonic stem cells were injected into blastocysts that were subsequently implanted into pseudopregnant mice. We performed Southern blotting to confirm correct recombination (Fig. 1B). MCA mRNA was not detectable using Northern blots (Fig. 1C), and the 40-kDa MCA protein was not detectable using Western blots (Fig. 1D) of the testis of homozygous MCA mutant mice. Crosses of heterozygous mutant pairs produced the expected ratios of wild-type, heterozygous, and homozygous genotype offspring, according to classical Mendelian inheritance patterns. Homozygous mutant males had slightly smaller body masses than did wild-type males (Fig. 1E). Matings between homozygous MCA knock-out males and wild-type females did not produce any successful pregnancies during a period of more than 3 months of continuous cohabitation, although vaginal plugs were observed in the paired wild-type females (Table 1). The heterozygous male MCA mutant mice and the homozygous females were all fertile (Table 1). Female body mass (Fig. 1E), newborn pup growth rates (Fig. 1E), and the weights of various organs, including the testes and seminal vesicles of adult MCA homozygous mutant mice, did not differ significantly from those of wild-type mice (Table 2). The serum testosterone levels of adult MCA homozygous mutant mice were normal compared with those of wild-type mice (Table 2).TABLE 1Fertility rates of mutant miceGenotypeMale fertility (no. of fertile males/no. of vaginal plugs)Litter size (average no. of newborn pups)aValues are means ± S.E.Female fertility (no. of fertile females/no. of vaginal plugs)Litter size (average no. of newborn pups)aValues are means ± S.E.+/−10/108.2 ± 0.310/107.8 ± 0.3−/−0/2108/86.0 ± 0.4a Values are means ± S.E.

The anti-MCA polyclonal antibody stained some germ cells in testis preserved in Bouin's solution (Fig. 2A) (2Tsuchida J. Nishina Y. Wakabayashi N. Nozaki M. Sakai Y. Nishimune Y. Dev. Biol. 1998; 197: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The signal was detected in the spermatocytes and elongated spermatids (Fig. 2A), and these signals decreased gradually as morphogenesis proceeded, as reported by Tsuchida et al. (2Tsuchida J. Nishina Y. Wakabayashi N. Nozaki M. Sakai Y. Nishimune Y. Dev. Biol. 1998; 197: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The heat treatment during embedding with paraffin or chemical bonds with the fixative solutions may have altered the exposed sites of the proteins to which the antibodies bound and may have caused the difference in immune staining. To examine the expression of MCA precisely, we performed immunohistochemical analyses using cross-sections preserved in 4% PFA (Fig. 2B). The anti-MCA antibody predominantly stained flagella in sperm preserved in 4% PFA (Fig. 2B). In MCA homozygous mutant males, the signals from testis preserved in either Bouin's solution or 4% PFA disappeared (Fig. 2, C and D). Rabbit IgG antibody was used as a control (see supplemental Fig. S3). These results indicate that the signals with both types of fixation depend on the MCA gene products. In addition, MCA was expressed from the pachytene spermatocyte (stage V) to sperm stages. These observations are in agreement with previous expression profile analyses using Northern and Western blotting (2Tsuchida J. Nishina Y. Wakabayashi N. Nozaki M. Sakai Y. Nishimune Y. Dev. Biol. 1998; 197: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). MCA might change the conformation in each subcellular localization and play different roles in sperm flagella and the cytoplasm of spermatocytes and spermatids; thus, the difference in conformation might cause different signals for each fixation method. On microscopic examination, the diameter of the seminiferous tubules and number of cells within the testes of adult wild-type and MCA homozygous mutant mice did not differ significantly (Table 2). There were also no significant differences in testis mass between mutant and wild-type mice (Table 2). The spermatogonia, spermatocytes, and spermatids were arranged systematically in the seminiferous tubules in heterozygous mutant testes, just as in wild-type testes; the spermatogonia are located in the tubule walls, and the spermatids are located at the tubule centers, and spermatocy"

International comparisons of scores in mathematical and science tests are seen as showing that US science teaching is in crisis. Salzman and Lowell argue that this view is misleading.
