https://openalex.org/W2508798274,"The major barrier to research and development of effective interventions for human noroviruses (HuNoVs) has been the lack of a robust and reproducible in vitro cultivation system. HuNoVs are the leading cause of gastroenteritis worldwide. We report the successful cultivation of multiple HuNoV strains in enterocytes in stem cell-derived, nontransformed human intestinal enteroid monolayer cultures. Bile, a critical factor of the intestinal milieu, is required for strain-dependent HuNoV replication. Lack of appropriate histoblood group antigen expression in intestinal cells restricts virus replication, and infectivity is abrogated by inactivation (e.g., irradiation, heating) and serum neutralization. This culture system recapitulates the human intestinal epithelium, permits human host-pathogen studies of previously noncultivatable pathogens, and allows the assessment of methods to prevent and treat HuNoV infections."
https://openalex.org/W2508548606,"Body temperature homeostasis is critical for survival and requires precise regulation by the nervous system. The hypothalamus serves as the principal thermostat that detects and regulates internal temperature. We demonstrate that the ion channel TRPM2 [of the transient receptor potential (TRP) channel family] is a temperature sensor in a subpopulation of hypothalamic neurons. TRPM2 limits the fever response and may detect increased temperatures to prevent overheating. Furthermore, chemogenetic activation and inhibition of hypothalamic TRPM2-expressing neurons in vivo decreased and increased body temperature, respectively. Such manipulation may allow analysis of the beneficial effects of altered body temperature on diverse disease states. Identification of a functional role for TRP channels in monitoring internal body temperature should promote further analysis of molecular mechanisms governing thermoregulation and foster the genetic dissection of hypothalamic circuits involved with temperature homeostasis."

In reality, the light's electromagnetic field distorts the scaffold, a phenomenon that becomes increasingly evident with rising field intensity. Lucchini et al. studied a manifestation of this phenomenon, termed the dynamical Franz Keldysh effect, in diamond substrates exposed to sudden, moderately intense infrared fields. Using attosecond probe pulses and accompanying theoretical simulations, they resolved and accounted for the extremely rapid ensuing electron dynamics. Science , this issue p. 916"
https://openalex.org/W2507518506,"Activation of the serine-threonine kinase Akt promotes the survival and proliferation of various cancers. Hypoxia promotes the resistance of tumor cells to specific therapies. We therefore explored a possible link between hypoxia and Akt activity. We found that Akt was prolyl-hydroxylated by the oxygen-dependent hydroxylase EglN1. The von Hippel-Lindau protein (pVHL) bound directly to hydroxylated Akt and inhibited Akt activity. In cells lacking oxygen or functional pVHL, Akt was activated to promote cell survival and tumorigenesis. We also identified cancer-associated Akt mutations that impair Akt hydroxylation and subsequent recognition by pVHL, thus leading to Akt hyperactivation. Our results show that microenvironmental changes, such as hypoxia, can affect tumor behaviors by altering Akt activation, which has a critical role in tumor growth and therapeutic resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2518229206,"The activated spliceosome (Bact) is in a catalytically inactive state and is remodeled into a catalytically active machine by the RNA helicase Prp2, but the mechanism is unclear. Here, we describe a 3D electron cryomicroscopy structure of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Bact complex at 5.8-angstrom resolution. Our model reveals that in Bact, the catalytic U2/U6 RNA-Prp8 ribonucleoprotein core is already established, and the 5′ splice site (ss) is oriented for step 1 catalysis but occluded by protein. The first-step nucleophile—the branchsite adenosine—is sequestered within the Hsh155 HEAT domain and is held 50 angstroms away from the 5′ss. Our structure suggests that Prp2 adenosine triphosphatase–mediated remodeling leads to conformational changes in Hsh155’s HEAT domain that liberate the first-step reactants for catalysis."

Yet ecological time series can be relatively short, owing to practical limits on study duration. Ye and Sugihara introduce an analytical approach called multiview embedding, which harnesses the complexity of short, noisy time series that are common in ecology and other disciplines such as economics. Using examples from published data sets, they show how this approach enhances the tractability of complex data from multiple interacting components and offers a way forward in ecological forecasting.

https://openalex.org/W2512813967,"A window into the cell for vitamin A Vitamin A is an essential nutrient for mammals, and its metabolites affect diverse biological processes. It is carried in the bloodstream as retinol by retinol binding protein (RBP); a protein called STRA6 is implicated in facilitating retinol translocation across the cell membrane. Chen et al. determined the structure of zebrafish STRA6 to a resolution of 3.9 Å by electron microscopy. A lipophilic cleft is a likely binding site for RBP, and an opening in the cleft may allow retinol to diffuse into the membrane. Unexpectedly, the structure also includes bound calcium-modulated protein, but its function remains unclear. Science , this issue p. 887"

Chuang et al. report an efficient 15-step asymmetric synthesis of ryanodol from the structurally much simpler terpene pulegone (see the Perspective by Verdaguer). Key steps include a Pauson-Khand cyclization of a tethered alkene and alkyne with carbon monoxide to set the ring motifs, followed by an oxidation using selenium dioxide that delivers three different oxygen substituents in tandem.

Earthquakes are imperfect illuminators because they are clustered on plate boundaries, leaving much of the interior in the shadows. Using a seismic array in Japan, Nishida and Takagi detected seismic waves that they attribute to a severe and distant North Atlantic storm called a “weather bomb” (see the Perspective by Gerstoft and Bromirski). The seismic energy traveling from weather bombs through the Earth appears to be capable of illuminating the many dark patches of Earth's interior. Science , this issue p. 919 ; see also p. 869"

The choices brought to mind berkelium (Bk) and californium (Cf), the names chosen for elements 97 and 98 over half a century ago. Silver et al. now revisit the chemistry of Bk, which has proven fiercely challenging to study over the years on account of its vigorous radioactive decay. Synthetic crystallized Bk borate and dipicolinate compounds structurally resembled Cf analogs in the solid state but manifested distinct electronic and magnetic characteristics stemming from spin-orbit coupling effects.

https://openalex.org/W2508657825,"Odorant-binding proteins (OBPs) and chemosensory proteins (CSPs) of aphids are thought to be responsible for the initial molecular interactions during olfaction that mediate detection of chemical signals. Analysis of the diversity of proteins involved comprises critical basic research work that will facilitate the development of sustainable pest control strategies. To help us better understand differences in the olfactory system between winged and wingless grain aphids, we constructed an antennal transcriptome from winged and wingless Sitobion avenae (Fabricius), one of the most serious pests of cereal fields worldwide. Among the 133,331 unigenes in the antennal assembly, 13 OBP and 5 CSP putative transcripts were identified with 6 OBP and 3 CSP sequences representing new S. avenae annotations. We used qPCR to examine the expression profile of these genes sets across S. avenae development and in various tissues. We found 7 SaveOBPs and 1 SaveCSP were specifically or significantly elevated in antennae compared with other tissues, and that some transcripts (SaveOBP8, SaveCSP2 and SaveCSP5) were abundantly expressed in the legs of winged or wingless aphids. The expression levels of the SaveOBPs and SaveCSPs varied depending on the developmental stage. Possible physiological functions of these genes are discussed. Further molecular and functional studies of these olfactory related genes will explore their potential as novel targets for controlling S. avenae."

https://openalex.org/W2510509415,"MLL1 belongs to the SET1 family of histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) methyltransferases, composed of MLL1-4 and SETd1A/B. MLL1 translocations are present in acute leukemias, and mutations in several family members are associated with cancer and developmental disorders. MLL1 associates with a subcomplex containing WDR5, RbBP5, ASH2L, and DPY-30 (WRAD), forming the MLL1 core complex required for H3K4 mono- and dimethylation and transcriptional activation. Core complex assembly requires interaction of WDR5 with the MLL1 Win (WDR5 interaction) motif, which is conserved across the SET1 family. Agents that mimic the SET1 family Win motif inhibit the MLL1 core complex and have become an attractive approach for targeting MLL1 in cancers. Like MLL1, other SET1 family members interact with WRAD, but the roles of the Win motif in complex assembly and enzymatic activity remain unexplored. Here, we show that the Win motif is necessary for interaction of WDR5 with all members of the human SET1 family. Mutation of the Win motif-WDR5 interface severely disrupts assembly and activity of MLL1 and SETd1A complexes but only modestly disrupts MLL2/4 and SETd1B complexes without significantly altering enzymatic activity in vitro Notably, in the absence of WDR5, MLL3 interacts with RAD and shows enhanced activity. To further probe the role of the Win motif-WDR5 interaction, we designed a peptidomimetic that binds WDR5 (Kd ∼3 nm) and selectively inhibits activity of MLL1 and SETd1A core complexes within the SET1 family. Our results reveal that SET1 family complexes with the weakest Win motif-WDR5 interaction are more susceptible to Win motif-based inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W2517131074,"The prion protein (PrPC) has been suggested to operate as a scaffold/receptor protein in neurons, participating in both physiological and pathological associated events. PrPC, laminin, and metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) form a protein complex on the plasma membrane that can trigger signaling pathways involved in neuronal differentiation. PrPC and mGluR5 are co-receptors also for β-amyloid oligomers (AβOs) and have been shown to modulate toxicity and neuronal death in Alzheimer's disease. In the present work, we addressed the potential crosstalk between these two signaling pathways, laminin-PrPC-mGluR5 or AβO-PrPC-mGluR5, as well as their interplay. Herein, we demonstrated that an existing complex containing PrPC-mGluR5 has an important role in AβO binding and activity in neurons. A peptide mimicking the binding site of laminin onto PrPC (Ln-γ1) binds to PrPC and induces intracellular Ca2+ increase in neurons via the complex PrPC-mGluR5. Ln-γ1 promotes internalization of PrPC and mGluR5 and transiently decreases AβO biding to neurons; however, the peptide does not impact AβO toxicity. Given that mGluR5 is critical for toxic signaling by AβOs and in prion diseases, we tested whether mGlur5 knock-out mice would be susceptible to prion infection. Our results show mild, but significant, effects on disease progression, without affecting survival of mice after infection. These results suggest that PrPC-mGluR5 form a functional response unit by which multiple ligands can trigger signaling. We propose that trafficking of PrPC-mGluR5 may modulate signaling intensity by different PrPC ligands.

But poorer individuals, especially those in developing countries, might want and need a product yet be unable to pay for it with money. Dupas et al. demonstrate that a nonprice voucher mechanism can be used to deliver chlorine for water treatment to people in Kenya who are too poor to pay for it, but who use it when they get it (see the Perspective by Olken). Having to redeem the vouchers screens out people who would accept the free chlorine solution but not use it. Science , this issue p. 889 ; see also p. 864"
https://openalex.org/W2511423960,"Dengue is a major public health problem in tropical and subtropical areas worldwide. There is a lack of information on the risk factors for death due to severe dengue fever in developing countries, including Brazil where the state of Amazonas is located. This knowledge is important for decision making and the implementation of effective measures for patient care. This study aimed to identify factors associated with death among patients with severe dengue, in Amazonas from 2001 to 2013. We conducted a retrospective cohort study based on secondary data from the epidemiological surveillance of dengue provided by the Fundação de Vigilância em Saúde do Amazonas, FVS (Health Surveillance Foundation) of the Secretaria de Saúde do Amazonas, SUSAM (Health Secretariat of the State of Amazonas). Data on dengue cases were obtained from the SINAN (Notifiable Diseases Information System) and SIM (Mortality Information System) databases. We selected cases of severe dengue with laboratory confirmation, including dengue-related deaths of residents in the state of Amazonas from January 1, 2001, to December 31, 2013. The explanatory variables analyzed were sex, age, level of education, spontaneous hemorrhagic manifestations, plasma extravasation and platelet count. Patients who died due to severe dengue had more hematuria, gastrointestinal bleeding, and thrombocytopenia than the survivors. Considering the simultaneous effects of demographic and clinical characteristics with a multiple logistic regression model, it was observed that the factors associated with death were age >55 years (odds ratio [OR] 4.98), gastrointestinal bleeding (OR 10.26), hematuria (OR 5.07), and thrombocytopenia (OR 2.55). Gastrointestinal bleeding was the clinical sign most strongly associated with death, followed by hematuria and age >55 years. The study results showed that the best predictor of death from severe dengue is based on the characteristic of age >55 years, together with the clinical signs of gastrointestinal bleeding, hematuria, and low platelet count."
https://openalex.org/W2513588040,"The amyloid precursor protein (APP) is an ubiquitously expressed cell surface protein and a key molecule in the etiology of Alzheimer disease. Amyloidogenic processing of APP through secretases leads to the generation of toxic amyloid β (Aβ) peptides, which are regarded as the molecular cause of the disease. We report here an alternative processing pathway of APP through the mammalian intramembrane rhomboid protease RHBDL4. RHBDL4 efficiently cleaves APP inside the cell, thus bypassing APP from amyloidogenic processing, leading to reduced Aβ levels. RHBDL4 cleaves APP multiple times in the ectodomain, resulting in several N- and C-terminal fragments that are not further degraded by classical APP secretases. Knockdown of endogenous RHBDL4 results in decreased levels of C-terminal fragments derived from endogenous APP. Similarly, we found the APP family members APLP1 and APLP2 to be substrates of RHBDL4. We conclude that RHBDL4-mediated APP processing provides insight into APP and rhomboid physiology and qualifies for further investigations to elaborate its impact on Alzheimer disease pathology.

https://openalex.org/W2515073863,"Lysorophians are a group of early tetrapods with extremely elongate trunks, reduced limbs, and highly reduced skulls. Since the first discovery of this group, general similarities in outward appearance between lysorophians and some modern lissamphibian orders (specifically Urodela and Gymnophiona) have been recognized, and sometimes been the basis for hypotheses of lissamphibian origins. We studied the morphology of the skull, with particular emphasis on the neurocranium, of a partial growth series of the lysorophian Brachydectes newberryi using x-ray micro-computed tomography (μCT). Our study reveals similarities between the braincase of Brachydectes and brachystelechid recumbirostrans, corroborating prior work suggesting a close relationship between these taxa. We also describe the morphology of the epipterygoid, stapes, and quadrate in this taxon for the first time. Contra the proposals of some workers, we find no evidence of expected lissamphibian synapomorphies in the skull morphology in Brachydectes newberryi, and instead recognize a number of derived amniote characteristics within the braincase and suspensorium. Morphology previously considered indicative of taxonomic diversity within Lysorophia may reflect ontogenetic rather than taxonomic variation. The highly divergent morphology of lysorophians represents a refinement of morphological and functional trends within recumbirostrans, and is analogous to morphology observed in many modern fossorial reptiles."
https://openalex.org/W2510666890,"Purpose To investigate the clinicopathological features, survival and prognostic factors of primary intestinal extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type (PI-ENKTCL). Methods Clinical and histological characteristics of PI-ENKTCL cases were retrospectively evaluated. Immunohistochemical phenotype and status of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and T-cell receptor (TCR) gene rearrangement were examined. The overall survival and prognostic parameters were also analyzed. Results Fifty-five (2.7%) cases with PI-ENKTCL were identified out of 2017 archived ENKTCL cases, with a median age of 39 years and a male to female ratio of 2.1:1. The most common symptom was abdominal pain (90.9%), accompanied frequently with fever and less commonly with intestinal perforation or B symptoms. Small intestine (50.9%) was the most common site to be involved. 47.3% and 36.4% cases presented with stage I and II diseases, respectively. Histologically, most cases displayed characteristic morphologic changes of ENKTCL. Cytoplasmic CD3, TIA-1 and CD56 expression was found in 100%, 94.5% and 89.1% of cases, respectively. In situ hybridization detection for EBV demonstrated positive results in all cases. Monoclonal TCR gene rearrangement was found in 52.9% of tested cases. Chemotherapy with a DICE or L-asparaginase/peg-asparginase-containing regimen was most often employed. Both advanced tumor stage and B symptoms were independent inferior prognostic factors (p = 0.001 and p = 0.010). Noticeably, 6 cases demonstrated a CD4-positive phenotype. These cases featured a relatively older median age (58 years), predominance of small/medium-sized neoplastic cells, a higher rate of TCR rearrangement and slightly favorable outcome. Conclusion We reported by far the largest series of PI-ENKTCL, and demonstrated its heterogeneity, aggressive clinical behavior and unsatisfying response to the current therapeutic strategies. Those CD4-positive cases might represent a unique subtype of PI-ENKTCL or distinct entity. Further investigations are required for the better understanding and management of this unusual disease."
https://openalex.org/W2514623274,"Previous studies have indicated that carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and cancer antigen 15–3 (CA15-3) levels are both independent prognostic factors in breast cancer. However, the utility of CEA and CA15-3 levels as conventional cancer biomarkers in patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) remains controversial. The current study was performed to explore the predictive value of pre-therapeutic serum CEA and CA15-3 levels, and nomograms were developed including these serum cancer biomarkers to improve the prognostic evaluation of TNBC patients. Pre-therapeutic CA15-3 and CEA concentrations were measured in 247 patients with stage I–IV TNBC. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that TNBC patients with high levels of both CEA and CA15-3 had shorter overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) rates than those in the low-level groups (p<0.05). Multivariate analysis suggested that pre-therapeutic CA15-3 and CEA levels are independent predictive elements for OS (p = 0.022 and p = 0.040, respectively) and DFS (p = 0.023 and p = 0.028, respectively). In addition, novel nomograms were established and validated to provide personal forecasts of OS and DFS for patients with TNBC. These novel nomograms may help physicians to select the optimal treatment plans to ensure the best outcomes for TNBC patients."
https://openalex.org/W2517553951,"Different reproductive strategies and the transition to asexuality can be associated with microbial symbionts. Whether such a link exists within mollusks has never been evaluated. We took the first steps towards addressing this possibility by performing pyrosequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA genes associated with Potamopyrgus antipodarum, a New Zealand freshwater snail. A diverse set of 60 tissue collections from P. antipodarum that were genetically and geographically distinct and either obligately sexual or asexual were included, which allowed us to evaluate whether reproductive mode was associated with a particular bacterial community. 2624 unique operational taxonomic units (OTU, 97% DNA similarity) were detected, which were distributed across ~30 phyla. While alpha diversity metrics varied little among individual samples, significant differences in bacterial community composition and structure were detected between sexual and asexual snails, as well as among snails from different lakes and genetic backgrounds. The mean dissimilarity of the bacterial communities between the sexual and asexual P. antipodarum was 90%, largely driven by the presence of Rickettsiales in sexual snails and Rhodobacter in asexual snails. Our study suggests that there might be a link between reproductive mode and the bacterial microbiome of P. antipodarum, though a causal connection requires additional study."

https://openalex.org/W2509672118,"Polyadenosine RNA-binding proteins (Pabs) regulate multiple steps in gene expression. This protein family includes the well studied Pabs, PABPN1 and PABPC1, as well as the newly characterized Pab, zinc finger CCCH-type containing protein 14 (ZC3H14). Mutations in ZC3H14 are linked to a form of intellectual disability. To probe the function of ZC3H14, we performed a transcriptome-wide analysis of cells depleted of either ZC3H14 or the control Pab, PABPN1. Depletion of PABPN1 affected ∼17% of expressed transcripts, whereas ZC3H14 affected only ∼1% of expressed transcripts. To assess the function of ZC3H14 in modulating target mRNAs, we selected the gene encoding the ATP synthase F0 subunit C (ATP5G1) transcript. Knockdown of ZC3H14 significantly reduced ATP5G1 steady-state mRNA levels. Consistent with results suggesting that ATP5G1 turnover increases upon depletion of ZC3H14, double knockdown of ZC3H14 and the nonsense-mediated decay factor, UPF1, rescues ATP5G1 transcript levels. Furthermore, fractionation reveals an increase in the amount of ATP5G1 pre-mRNA that reaches the cytoplasm when ZC3H14 is depleted and that ZC3H14 binds to ATP5G1 pre-mRNA in the nucleus. These data support a role for ZC3H14 in ensuring proper nuclear processing and retention of ATP5G1 pre-mRNA. Consistent with the observation that ATP5G1 is a rate-limiting component for ATP synthase activity, knockdown of ZC3H14 decreases cellular ATP levels and causes mitochondrial fragmentation. These data suggest that ZC3H14 modulates pre-mRNA processing of select mRNA transcripts and plays a critical role in regulating cellular energy levels, observations that have broad implications for proper neuronal function."
https://openalex.org/W2515399241,"We provide evidence for the presence of cannabinoid CB2 receptors in some cellular types of the cochlea of the adult albino rat. Cannabinoids and their receptors are increasingly being studied because of their high potential for clinical use. As a hyperspecialized portion of the peripheral nervous system, study of the expression and function of cannabinoid receptors in the hearing organ is of high interest. Stria vascularis and inner hair cells express CB2 receptor, as well as neurites and cell bodies of the spiral ganglion. Cellular types such as supporting cells and outer hair cells, in which the expression of other types of functional receptors has been reported, do not significantly express CB2 receptors in this study. An up-regulation of CB2 gene expression was detected after an ototoxic event such as cisplatin treatment, probably due to pro-inflammatory events triggered by the drug. That fact suggests promising potential of CB2 receptor as a therapeutic target for new treatments to palliate cisplatin-induced hearing loss and other ototoxic events which triggers inflammatory pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2511615750,"The Yesso scallop Patinopecten yessoensis displays polymorphism in shell colors, which is of great interest for the scallop industry. To identify genes involved in the shell coloration, in the present study, we investigate the transcriptome differences by Illumina digital gene expression (DGE) analysis in two extreme color phenotypes, Red and White. Illumina sequencing yields a total of 62,715,364 clean sequence reads, and more than 85% reads are mapped into our previously sequenced transcriptome. There are 25 significantly differentially expressed genes between Red and White scallops. EPR (Electron paramagnetic resonance) analysis has identified EPR spectra of pheomelanin and eumelanin in the red shells, but not in the white shells. Compared to the Red scallops, the White scallops have relatively higher mRNA expression in tyrosinase genes, but lower expression in other melanogensis-associated genes. Meantime, the relatively lower tyrosinase protein and decreased tyrosinase activity in White scallops are suggested to be associated with the lack of melanin in the white shells. Our findings highlight the functional roles of melanogensis-associated genes in the melanization process of scallop shells, and shed new lights on the transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms in the regulation of tyrosinase activity during the process of melanin synthesis. The present results will assist our molecular understanding of melanin synthesis underlying shell color polymorphism in scallops, as well as other bivalves, and also help the color-based breeding in shellfish aquaculture."

Matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) and their tissue inhibitors (TIMP) are released early in inflammation. We aimed to assess levels of MMP-7, -8, -9 and TIMP-1 in acute pancreatitis (AP) and explore their ability to detect disease severity. Our second aim was to find an association between MMPs, TIMP and creatinine.We collected plasma samples for MMP-7, -8, -9 and TIMP-1 analyses from 176 patients presenting within 96 h from onset of acute pancreatitis (AP) symptoms. We used samples from 32 control subjects as comparison. The revised Atlanta Classification was utilised to assess severity of disease. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis and Spearman´s Rho-test were utilised for statistical calculations.Compared with controls, patients showed higher levels of all studied markers. MMP-8 was higher in moderately severe AP than in mild AP (p = 0.005) and MMP-8, -9 and TIMP-1 were higher in severe than in mild AP (p<0.001, p = 0.005 and p = 0.019). MMP-8 detected SAP with an AUC of 0.939 [95% CI 0.894-0.984], LR+ 9.03 [5.30-15.39]. MMP-8, -9 and TIMP-1 failed to discern moderately severe AP from SAP. MMP-7 was not different between patient groups. MMP-7 and TIMP-1 correlated weakly with creatinine (Rho = 0.221 and 0.243). MMP-8 might be a useful biomarker in early detection of SAP."

TMEM106B-induced death is mediated by the caspase-dependent mitochondrial cell death pathways and possibly by the lysosomal cell death pathway.

Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) 2The abbreviations used are: FTLD, frontotemporal lobar degeneration; ALS, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; MOI, multiplicity of infection; PCN, primary cultured cerebral cortical neuron; Boc-D-FMK, t-butoxycarbonyl-Asp(O-Me)-fluoromethyl ketone; HX, HisXpress; FL, full-length; NTF, N-terminal fragment; CTF, C-terminal fragment; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; VAPB, vesicle-associated membrane protein-associated protein B. is the second leading cause of presenile dementia, typically with an onset of disease before 65 years of age (1Rademakers R.

It is pathologically characterized by degeneration of the frontal and anterior temporal lobes of the cerebral cortices. Clinical characteristics include changes in personality and behavior and difficulties with language. Approximately 25–50% of FTLD cases are genetically inherited, and several genes, such as GRN (the gene encoding progranulin), MAPT, VCP, CHAMP2B, TARDBP, FUS, and C9ORF72, have been identified as FTLD-causative genes (3Pottier C.

FTLD has been recently recognized as a disease that has a common pathogenetic background with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) (4Ling S.C. Polymenidou M. Cleveland D.W.

An important pathological hallmark of FTLD and ALS is a cytoplasmic transactive response DNA-binding protein-43 (TDP-43) inclusion. TDP-43 is the major component of inclusions in ∼50% of FTLD patients (subtype FTLD-TDP) and the majority of ALS patients (9Arai T. Hasegawa M. Akiyama H. Ikeda K. Nonaka T. Mori H. Mann D.

However, currently, the pathogenetic mechanisms underlying these neurodegenerative diseases are not fully understood. A genome-wide association study and cohort studies have identified three SNPs (rs1990622, rs6966915, and rs1020004) in the transmembrane protein 106B (TMEM106B) gene region as genetic risk modifiers for FTLD-TDP (11Van Deerlin V.M.

In agreement with this, the expression level of the TMEM106B risk variant tends to be up-regulated, compared with that encoded by the non-risk TMEM106B variant in vitro (22Nicholson A.M. Finch N.A. Wojtas A. Baker M.C. Perkerson 3rd, R.B. Castanedes-Casey M. Rousseau L. Benussi L. Binetti G. Ghidoni R. Hsiung G.Y. Mackenzie I.R. Finger E. Boeve B.F. Ertekin-Taner N. et al.TMEM106B p.

These observations suggest that the up-regulation of TMEM106B expression is closely linked to the onset of FTLD-TDP. However, how the up-regulation of TMEM106B increases the risk for FTLD-TDP remains to be elucidated. In this study, we show that the overexpression of TMEM106B induces cell death, enhances oxidative stress-induced cytotoxicity, and causes the cleavage of TDP-43, a representative TDP-43 pathology observed in FTLD-TDP, using cell-based models. TMEM106B-induced cell death is mediated by the caspase-dependent mitochondrial cell death pathways and possibly by the lysosomal cell death pathway. These findings suggest that the up-regulation of TMEM106B increases the risk of FTLD by directly causing neurotoxicity. Following the transient overexpression of N-terminally HisXpress (HX)-tagged human TMEM106B-full length (FL) in HeLa cells, we detected its presence by immunofluorescence analysis and immunoblotting analysis using Xpress and TMEM106B antibodies (Fig. 1, A and B). Immunofluorescence analysis indicated that HX-TMEM106B-FL showed a cytoplasmic granular localization pattern (Fig. 1A), which has been shown to be a lysosomal localization pattern in previous reports (19Brady O.A.

Immunoblotting analysis indicated that multiple proteins were stained with the Xpress and the TMEM106B antibodies. They included smeared high molecular mass proteins, a 46-kDa protein, and a 20-kDa protein (Fig. 1B). Because the predicted molecular mass of TMEM106B is 31 kDa and it is a highly glycosylated protein (20Chen-Plotkin A.S. Unger T.L. Gallagher M.D. Bill E. Kwong L.K. Volpicelli-Daley L. Busch J.I.

Neurochem. 2013; 126: 781-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), the 46-kDa protein in Fig. 1B was thought to be TMEM106B-FL. Based on the finding that TMEM106B tends to be multimerized (24Stagi M. Klein Z.A. Gould T.J. Bewersdorf J. Strittmatter S.M. Lysosome size, motility and stress response regulated by fronto-temporal dementia modifier TMEM106B.Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2014; 61: 226-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), the smeared high molecular mass proteins may be TMEM106B multimers. The 20-kDa protein appears to correspond to the N-terminal fragment (NTF) of TMEM106B, as reported in a previous study (25Brady O.A. Zhou X. Hu F. Regulated intramembrane proteolysis of the frontotemporal lobar degeneration risk factor, TMEM106B, by signal peptide peptidase-like 2a (SPPL2a).J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 19670-19680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). We then examined whether the TMEM106B antibody is capable of detecting endogenous TMEM106B by immunoblotting analysis. To address whether the detected protein is TMEM106B, we also knocked down the endogenous TMEM106B using two types of specific siRNA against human TMEM106B before we conducted immunoblotting analysis. Because the TMEM106B protein has been reported to be very sensitive to heat and become undetectable by immunoblotting analysis after heat denaturation (20Chen-Plotkin A.S. Unger T.L. Gallagher M.D. Bill E. Kwong L.K. Volpicelli-Daley L. Busch J.I. Akle S. Grossman M. Van Deerlin V. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. TMEM106B, the risk gene for frontotemporal dementia, is regulated by the microRNA-132/212 cluster and affects progranulin pathways.J. Neurosci. 2012; 32: 11213-11227Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), cell lysates were either boiled (Fig. 1C, lanes 1–3) or left unboiled (Fig. 1C, lanes 4–6) in the SDS sample buffer, before the SDS-PAGE. A protein with a molecular mass of ∼40 kDa (indicated as FL and with an asterisk in Fig. 1C), migrating in a fashion nearly identical to exogenous TMEM106B-FL (Fig. 1C, Long exposure, lane 8), was detected in non-boiled cell lysates (Fig. 1C, Long exposure, lane 4). The intensity of the band was markedly reduced by two kinds of siRNA (Fig. 1C, Long exposure, lanes 5 and 6). As expected, the level of the protein with a molecular mass of ∼40 kDa was quite low in the boiled lysates (Fig. 1C, Long exposure, lanes 1–3). To further confirm that the protein is the endogenous TMEM106B-FL, we immunoprecipitated it from the cell lysates using the TMEM106B antibody, followed by immunoblotting analysis of the immunoprecipitates with the same antibody (Fig. 1D). We found that the antibody efficiently immunoprecipitated endogenous TMEM106B (Fig. 1D, lane 3). Thus, these experiments show that the TMEM106B antibody is capable of detecting endogenous TMEM106B-FL. The other proteins that were recognized by immunoblotting analysis by the TMEM106B antibody, such as the proteins with a approximate molecular mass of 70 or 17 kDa, were not greatly affected by boiling (Fig. 1C, Short exposure, cf. lanes 1 and 4) or not immunoprecipitated with the TMEM106B antibody (Fig. 1D, lane 3). These results suggest that they are nonspecific artifacts of the TMEM106B antibody. It has been reported that some uncharacterized lysosomal protease(s) and SPPL2a cleave TMEM106B at around the 127th and 106th amino acids from the N terminus, respectively, to generate two NTFs of TMEM106B (25Brady O.A. Zhou X. Hu F. Regulated intramembrane proteolysis of the frontotemporal lobar degeneration risk factor, TMEM106B, by signal peptide peptidase-like 2a (SPPL2a).J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 19670-19680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The precise cleavage sites have not been identified. In agreement with this, a considerable amount of protein with a molecular mass of ∼20 kDa was recognized by the Xpress antibody in the cell lysates from the cells overexpressing HX-TMEM106B-FL (Fig. 1B). To confirm that this protein is a cleaved derivative of TMEM106B, we overexpressed non-tagged TMEM106B-FL in HeLa cells and treated the cells with NH4Cl and (ZLL)2-ketone, inhibitors of the cleavage of TMEM106B (25Brady O.A. Zhou X. Hu F. Regulated intramembrane proteolysis of the frontotemporal lobar degeneration risk factor, TMEM106B, by signal peptide peptidase-like 2a (SPPL2a).J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 19670-19680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A). Again, the overexpression of non-tagged TMEM106B-FL resulted in the generation of two similar fragments with molecular masses of ∼17 and 13 kDa. Because they were recognized by the TMEM106B antibody, raised against the 14-amino acid peptide of the N-terminal region of TMEM106B (see “Experimental Procedures”), they were believed to be NTFs and were designated NTF17 and NTF13, respectively (Fig. 2A, lane 4). Based on the findings of a previous study (25Brady O.A. Zhou X. Hu F. Regulated intramembrane proteolysis of the frontotemporal lobar degeneration risk factor, TMEM106B, by signal peptide peptidase-like 2a (SPPL2a).J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 19670-19680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), we constructed vectors to express the two TMEM106B-NTFs corresponding to TMEM106B(1–127) and TMEM106B(1–106) as references. Immunoblotting analysis showed that the apparent SDS-PAGE migration distances of NTF17 and NTF13 were identical to those of TMEM106B(1–127) and TMEM106B(1–106), respectively (Fig. 2A, cf. lane 4 and lane 7 or 8). Furthermore, specific protease inhibitors, NH4Cl and (ZLL)2-ketone, partially inhibited the generation of NTF17 and NTF13 (Fig. 2A, cf. lanes 4–6). These data together led us to conclude that NTF17 and NTF13 correspond to TMEM106B(1–127) and TMEM106B(1–106), respectively. NTF17 was also generated in neuronal cells, NSC34 cells and Neuro2a cells that overexpress TMEM106B-FL (Fig. 2, B and C, lanes 2), whereas NTF13 was not detected in these cells, probably because of relatively low expression of TMEM106B-FL. We failed to identify the precise cleavage sites because a small deletion of TMEM106B made it quite unstable (data not shown). Treatment of the cells overexpressing TMEM106B-FL with lysosomal protease inhibitors leupeptin, pepstatin A, and E-64d partially inhibited the generation of NTF17 (Fig. 2D, cf. lanes 2 and 3–5). Leupeptin and E-64d, but not pepstatin A, also partially inhibited the generation of NTF13 (Fig. 2D, cf. lanes 2 and 3–5). These results suggest that lysosomal protease(s) are involved in the cleavage of TMEM106B. In contrast to the NTFs, generated from the exogenously expressed TMEM106B, endogenous NTFs were not clearly detected (Fig. 1, C and D, lane 3). Because the NTF17-like protein in the input lanes (Fig. 1D, Long exposure, lane 1) was not immunoprecipitated with the TMEM106B antibody (Fig. 1D, lane 3) that does immunoprecipitate exogenous TMEM106B(1–127) (data not shown), this was believed to be a background artifact unrelated to the NTFs of TMEM106B. These results suggest that the endogenous TMEM106B-NTFs are too unstable to be detected. To confirm this, HeLa cells overexpressing TMEM106B-FL, TMEM106B(1–127), or TMEM106B(1–106) were treated with cycloheximide for 8 or 24 h (Fig. 3A). As expected, TMEM106B(1–127) (lanes 7–9) and TMEM106B(1–106) (lanes 10–12) were more rapidly degraded than TMEM106B-FL (lanes 4–6). Immunocytochemistry analysis showed that TMEM106B(1–127) and TMEM106B(1–106) as well as TMEM106B-FL partially colocalized with the lysosomal markers, Lysotracker and LAMP1-EGFP (Fig. 3B), suggesting that lysosomal proteases are involved in the degradation of TMEM106B-NTFs. Lysosomal protease inhibitors leupeptin and E-64d, but not pepstatin A, and ubiquitin-proteasome inhibitor, MG132, inhibited their degradation (Fig. 3, C and D). These results suggest that TMEM106B-NTFs are degraded through the lysosome and ubiquitin-proteasome degradation pathways. It has been reported that levels of TMEM106B are up-regulated in the brains of FTLD-TDP patients, especially in those with GRN mutations (11Van Deerlin V.M. Sleiman P.M. Martinez-Lage M.

This finding suggests that the overexpression of TMEM106B is linked to pathogenesis in these patients. To investigate this, we first examined the direct effect of overexpression of TMEM106B-FL on the viability of HeLa cells and primary cortical neurons (PCNs). Cytotoxicity was evaluated by a lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release cell death assay or WST-8 cell viability assay. We found that the overexpression of TMEM106B-FL induced cell death in HeLa cells in an expression level-dependent manner (Fig. 4, A and B) and decreased cell viability in PCNs (Fig. 4, C and D). The cell death, induced by the overexpression of TMEM106B, was inhibited by overexpression of Bcl-xL (Fig. 4, E and F). These data indicated that increased expression of TMEM106B causes cell death that is mediated by the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. In contrast, the reduction in expression of TMEM106B, caused by specific siRNAs against TMEM106B, did not induce cell death (Fig. 4, G and H). The overexpression of TMEM106B resulted in the appearance of NTF17 and NTF13, in addition to TMEM106B-FL (Fig. 2). Therefore, it was not clear which forms of TMEM106B protein, TMEM106B-FL and/or cleaved fragments, were responsible for inducing cell death. To investigate this, we generated adenovirus vectors that express TMEM106B(1–127) and TMEM106B(1–106). These adenovirus vectors express each encoded protein m"

Both proteins interact with and regulate RhoGTPases and F-actin dynamics, yet their role in hematopoietic stem and precursor cells (HSPCs) remained unexplored. Here, the role of the SWEF proteins SWAP-70 and DEF6 in HSPCs was examined. Both SWEF proteins are expressed in HSCs. HSCs and different precursor populations were analyzed in mice deficient for SWAP-70, DEF6, SWAP-70 and DEF6 (double knockout, DKO), and wild-type controls. HSPCs isolated from these strains were used for competitive adoptive transfer into irradiated wild-type mice. Reconstitution of the myeloid and lymphoid lineages in the recipient mice was determined. The numbers of HSPCs in the bone marrow of Swap-70-/- and Swap-70-/-Def6-/- mice were >3-fold increased. When transplanted into lethally irradiated wild-type recipients, the reconstitution potential of Swap-70-/- HSPCs was intrinsically impaired in competing with wild-type HSPCs for contribution to hematopoiesis. Def6-/- HSPCs show wild type-like reconstitution potential under the same transplantation conditions. DKO HSPCs reconstituted to only 25% of wild-type levels, indicating a partial rescue by DEF6 deficiency in the Swap-70-/- background. Our study reveals the two SWEF proteins as important contributors to HSPC biology. Despite their similarity these two proteins regulate HSC/progenitor homeostasis, self-renewal, lineage contributions and repopulation in a distinct and mostly antagonistic manner."

https://openalex.org/W2511116188,"Defensins are frontline peptides of mucosal immunity in the animal kingdom, including birds. Their resistance to proteolysis and their ensuing ability to maintain antimicrobial potential remains questionable and was therefore investigated. We have shown by bottom-up mass spectrometry analysis of protein extracts that both avian beta-defensins AvBD2 and AvBD7 were ubiquitously distributed along the chicken gut. Cathepsin B was found by immunoblotting in jejunum, ileum, caecum, and caecal tonsils, while cathepsins K, L, and S were merely identified in caecal tonsils. Hydrolysis product of AvBD2 and AvBD7 incubated with a panel of proteases was analysed by RP-HPLC, mass spectrometry and antimicrobial assays. AvBD2 and AvBD7 were resistant to serine proteases and to cathepsins D and H. Conversely cysteine cathepsins B, K, L, and S degraded AvBD2 and abolished its antibacterial activity. Only cathepsin K cleaved AvBD7 and released Ile4-AvBD7, a N-terminal truncated natural peptidoform of AvBD7 that displayed antibacterial activity. Besides the 3-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet typical of beta-defensins, structural analysis of AvBD7 by two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy highlighted the restricted accessibility of the C-terminus embedded by the N-terminal region and gave a formal evidence of a salt bridge (Asp9-Arg12) that could account for proteolysis resistance. The differential susceptibility of avian defensins to proteolysis opens intriguing questions about a distinctive role in the mucosal immunity against pathogen invasion."
https://openalex.org/W2516869965,"Postglacial climate changes alter geographical distributions and diversity of species. Such ongoing changes often force species to migrate along the latitude/altitude. Altitudinal gradients represent assemblage of environmental, especially climatic, variable factors that influence the plant distributions. Global warming that triggered upward migrations has therefore impacted the alpine plants on an island. In this study, we examined the genetic structure of Juniperus morrisonicola, a dominant alpine species in Taiwan, and inferred historical, demographic dynamics based on multilocus analyses. Lower levels of genetic diversity in north indicated that populations at higher latitudes were vulnerable to climate change, possibly related to historical alpine glaciers. Neither organellar DNA nor nuclear genes displayed geographical subdivisions, indicating that populations were likely interconnected before migrating upward to isolated mountain peaks, providing low possibilities of seed/pollen dispersal across mountain ranges. Bayesian skyline plots suggested steady population growth of J. morrisonicola followed by recent demographic contraction. In contrast, most lower-elevation plants experienced recent demographic expansion as a result of global warming. The endemic alpine conifer may have experienced dramatic climate changes over the alternation of glacial and interglacial periods, as indicated by a trend showing decreasing genetic diversity with the altitudinal gradient, plus a fact of upward migration."

Albeit numerous applications exist that enable machines to read facial emotions and recognize the content of verbal messages, methods for speech emotion recognition are still in their infancy. Yet, fast and reliable applications for emotion recognition are the obvious advancement of present 'intelligent personal assistants', and may have countless applications in diagnostics, rehabilitation and research. Taking inspiration from the dynamics of human group decision-making, we devised a novel speech emotion recognition system that applies, for the first time, a semi-supervised prediction model based on consensus. Three tests were carried out to compare this algorithm with traditional approaches. Labeling performances relative to a public database of spontaneous speeches are reported. The novel system appears to be fast, robust and less computationally demanding than traditional methods, allowing for easier implementation in portable voice-analyzers (as used in rehabilitation, research, industry, etc.) and for applications in the research domain (such as real-time pairing of stimuli to participants' emotional state, selective/differential data collection based on emotional content, etc.)."

We used data from the Medical Research Council's National Survey of Health and Development-the 1946 British birth cohort. Multi-channel sequence analysis was used to create a typology of eight work-family life course types combining information on work, partnerships and parenthood between ages 16-51. Linear regression tested associations between work-family types and metabolic outcomes at age 53 on multiply imputed data (20 imputations) of >2,400 participants. Compared with men with strong ties to employment and early transitions to family life, men who made later transitions to parenthood and maintained strong ties to paid work had smaller waist circumferences (-2.16cm, 95% CI: -3.73, -0.59), lower triglycerides (9.78% lower, 95% CI: 0.81, 17.94) and lower blood pressure (systolic: -4.03mmHg, 95% CI: -6.93, -1.13; diastolic: -2.34mmHg, 95% CI: -4.15, -0.53).

https://openalex.org/W2513437488,"Telomeres are specific DNA-protein structures found at both ends of eukaryotic chromosomes that protect the genome from degradation and from being recognized as double-stranded breaks. In vertebrates, telomeres are composed of tandem repeats of the TTAGGG sequence that are bound by a six-subunit complex called shelterin. Molecular mechanisms of telomere functions remain unknown in large part due to lack of structural data on shelterins, shelterin complex, and its interaction with the telomeric DNA repeats. TRF1 is one of the best studied shelterin components; however, the molecular architecture of the full-length protein remains unknown. We have used single-particle electron microscopy to elucidate the structure of TRF1 and its interaction with telomeric DNA sequence. Our results demonstrate that full-length TRF1 presents a molecular architecture that assists its interaction with telometic DNA and at the same time makes TRFH domains accessible to other TRF1 binding partners. Furthermore, our studies suggest hypothetical models on how other proteins as TIN2 and tankyrase contribute to regulate TRF1 function."

https://openalex.org/W2274778109,"Microtubule structure and functions have been widely studied in vitro and in cells. Research has shown that cysteines on tubulin play a crucial role in the polymerization of microtubules. Here, we show that blocking sulfhydryl groups of cysteines in taxol-stabilized polymerized microtubules with a commonly used chemical crosslinker prevents temporal end-to-end annealing of microtubules in vitro. This can dramatically affect the length distribution of the microtubules. The crosslinker sulfosuccinimidyl 4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylate, sulfo-SMCC, consists of a maleimide and an N-hydroxysuccinimide ester group to bind to sulfhydryl groups and primary amines, respectively. Interestingly, addition of a maleimide dye alone does not show the same interference with annealing in stabilized microtubules. This study shows that the sulfhydryl groups of cysteines of tubulin that are vital for the polymerization are also important for the subsequent annealing of microtubules."

We therefore investigated the relevance of ELISA data for measuring low-affinity antibodies, such as anti-Aβ. We analysed the binding of different commercial Immunoglobulin G (IgG) preparations to Aβ, actin and tetanus toxoid in different binding assays to further investigate the possible cause for observed differences in binding to Aβ and actin between different IgG preparations. We show that the differences of commercial IgG preparations in binding to Aβ and actin in ELISA assays are artefactual and only evident in in vitro binding assays. In functional assays and in vivo animal studies the different IVIG preparations exhibited very similar potency. ELISA data alone are not appropriate to analyse and rank the binding capacity of low-affinity antibodies to Aβ or other endogenous self-antigens contained in IgG preparations. Additional analytical methods should be adopted to complement ELISA data."

There is a great potential to adapt this technology to inactivate pathogens in plasma and derivatives. To better evaluate the potential of this method, pathogen inoculated plasma samples were pressurized under different pressure application modes and temperatures. The inactivation efficacy of pathogens and activities of plasma proteins were monitored after treatment. The CFUs of E.coli was examined as the indicator of the inactivation efficiency. The factor V and VIII were chosen as the indicator of the plasma function. Preliminary experiments identified optimized treatment conditions: 200-250MPa, with 5×1 minute multi-pulsed high pressure at near 0°C (ice-water bath). Under this conditions, the inactivation efficacy of EMCV was >8.5log. The CFUs of E. coli were reduced by 7.5log, B. cereus were 8log. However, PPV and S. aureus cannot be inactivated efficiently.
