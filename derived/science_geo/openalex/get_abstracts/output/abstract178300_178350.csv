https://openalex.org/W1967543716,"We predict regulatory targets for 14 Arabidopsis microRNAs (miRNAs) by identifying mRNAs with near complementarity. Complementary sites within predicted targets are conserved in rice. Of the 49 predicted targets, 34 are members of transcription factor gene families involved in developmental patterning or cell differentiation. The near-perfect complementarity between plant miRNAs and their targets suggests that many plant miRNAs act similarly to small interfering RNAs and direct mRNA cleavage. The targeting of developmental transcription factors suggests that many plant miRNAs function during cellular differentiation to clear key regulatory transcripts from daughter cell lineages."
https://openalex.org/W2006765654,"A defining feature of HIV replication is integration of the proviral cDNA into human DNA. The selection of chromosomal targets for integration is crucial for efficient viral replication, but the mechanism is poorly understood. Here we describe mapping of 524 sites of HIV cDNA integration on the human genome sequence. Genes were found to be strongly favored as integration acceptor sites. Global analysis of cellular transcription indicated that active genes were preferential integration targets, particularly genes that were activated in cells after infection by HIV-1. Regional hotspots for integration were also found, including a 2.4 kb region containing 1% of sites. These data document unexpectedly strong biases in integration site selection and suggest how selective targeting promotes aggressive HIV replication."
https://openalex.org/W2146032033,"The adult brain is extremely vulnerable to various insults. The recent discovery of neural progenitors in adult mammals, however, raises the possibility of repairing damaged tissue by recruiting their latent regenerative potential. Here we show that activation of endogenous progenitors leads to massive regeneration of hippocampal pyramidal neurons after ischemic brain injury. Endogenous progenitors proliferate in response to ischemia and subsequently migrate into the hippocampus to regenerate new neurons. Intraventricular infusion of growth factors markedly augments these responses, thereby increasing the number of newborn neurons. Our studies suggest that regenerated neurons are integrated into the existing brain circuitry and contribute to ameliorating neurological deficits. These results expand the possibility of novel neuronal cell regeneration therapies for stroke and other neurological diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2005471059,"The heart responds to stress signals by hypertrophic growth, which is accompanied by activation of the MEF2 transcription factor and reprogramming of cardiac gene expression. We show here that class II histone deacetylases (HDACs), which repress MEF2 activity, are substrates for a stress-responsive kinase specific for conserved serines that regulate MEF2-HDAC interactions. Signal-resistant HDAC mutants lacking these phosphorylation sites are refractory to hypertrophic signaling and inhibit cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Conversely, mutant mice lacking the class II HDAC, HDAC9, are sensitized to hypertrophic signals and exhibit stress-dependent cardiomegaly. Thus, class II HDACs act as signal-responsive suppressors of the transcriptional program governing cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure."
https://openalex.org/W2097632838,"Using coimmunoprecipitation and tandem mass spectrometry, we identify INSIG-1 as an ER protein that binds the sterol-sensing domain of SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP) and facilitates retention of the SCAP/SREBP complex in the ER. In sterol-depleted cells, SCAP escorts SREBPs from ER to Golgi for proteolytic processing, thereby allowing SREBPs to stimulate cholesterol synthesis. Sterols induce binding of SCAP to INSIG-1, as determined by blue native-PAGE, and this is correlated with the inhibition of SCAP exit from the ER. Overexpression of INSIG-1 increases the sensitivity of cells to sterol-mediated inhibition of SREBP processing. Mutant SCAP(Y298C) fails to bind INSIG-1 and is resistant to sterol-mediated inhibition of ER exit. By facilitating sterol-dependent ER retention of SCAP, INSIG-1 plays a central role in cholesterol homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W1976990850,"The number of cells in an organism is determined by regulating both cell proliferation and cell death. Relatively few mechanisms have been identified that can modulate both of these processes. In a screen for Drosophila mutations that result in tissue overgrowth, we identified salvador (sav), a gene that promotes both cell cycle exit and cell death. Elevated Cyclin E and DIAP1 levels are found in mutant cells, resulting in delayed cell cycle exit and impaired apoptosis. Salvador contains two WW domains and binds to the Warts (or LATS) protein kinase. The human ortholog of salvador (hWW45) is mutated in three cancer cell lines. Thus, salvador restricts cell numbers in vivo by functioning as a dual regulator of cell proliferation and apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2136008443,"Recent studies show that AMPA receptor (-R) trafficking is important in synaptic plasticity. However, the signaling controlling this trafficking is poorly understood. Small GTPases have diverse neuronal functions and their perturbation is responsible for several mental disorders. Here, we examine the small GTPases Ras and Rap in the postsynaptic signaling underlying synaptic plasticity. We show that Ras relays the NMDA-R and CaMKII signaling that drives synaptic delivery of AMPA-Rs during long-term potentiation. In contrast, Rap mediates NMDA-R-dependent removal of synaptic AMPA-Rs that occurs during long-term depression. Ras and Rap exert their effects on AMPA-Rs that contain different subunit composition. Thus, Ras and Rap, whose activity can be controlled by postsynaptic enzymes, serve as independent regulators for potentiating and depressing central synapses."
https://openalex.org/W2139044529,"Puf proteins are developmental regulators that control mRNA stability and translation by binding sequences in the 3' untranslated regions of their target mRNAs. We have determined the structure of the RNA binding domain of the human Puf protein, Pumilio1, bound to a high-affinity RNA ligand. The RNA binds the concave surface of the molecule, where each of the protein's eight repeats makes contacts with a different RNA base via three amino acid side chains at conserved positions. We have mutated these three side chains in one repeat, thereby altering the sequence specificity of Pumilio1. Thus, the high affinity and specificity of the PUM-HD for RNA is achieved using multiple copies of a simple repeated motif."
https://openalex.org/W2150091300,"Axon growth across the Drosophila midline requires Comm to downregulate Robo, the receptor for the midline repellent Slit. We show here that comm is required in neurons, not in midline cells as previously thought, and that it is expressed specifically and transiently in commissural neurons. Comm acts as a sorting receptor for Robo, diverting it from the synthetic to the late endocytic pathway. A conserved cytoplasmic LPSY motif is required for endosomal sorting of Comm in vitro and for Comm to downregulate Robo and promote midline crossing in vivo. Axon traffic at the CNS midline is thus controlled by the intracellular trafficking of the Robo guidance receptor, which in turn depends on the precisely regulated expression of the Comm sorting receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2044412059,"Oxidative stress is created in aerobic organisms when molecular oxygen chemically oxidizes redox enzymes, forming superoxide (O 2⨪) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Prior work identified several flavoenzymes from Escherichia coli that tend to autoxidize. Of these, fumarate reductase (Frd) is notable both for its high turnover number and for its production of substantial O 2⨪ in addition to H2O2. We have sought to identify characteristics of Frd that predispose it to this behavior. The ability of excess succinate to block autoxidation and the inhibitory effect of lowering the flavin potential indicate that all detectable autoxidation occurs from its FAD site, rather than from iron-sulfur clusters or bound quinones. The flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) moiety of Frd is unusually solvent-exposed, as evidenced by its ability to bind sulfite, and this may make it more likely to react adventitiously with O2. The autoxidizing species is apparently fully reduced flavin rather than flavosemiquinone, since treatments that more fully reduce the enzyme do not slow its turnover number. They do, however, switch the major product from O 2⨪ to H2O2. A similar effect is achieved by lowering the potential of the proximal [2Fe-2S] cluster. These data suggest that Frd releases O 2⨪ into bulk solution if this cluster is available to sequester the semiquinone electron; otherwise, that electron is rapidly transferred to the nascent superoxide, and H2O2 is the product that leaves the active site. This model is supported by the behavior of “aspartate oxidase” (aspartate:fumarate oxidoreductase), an Frd homologue that lacks Fe-S clusters. Its dihydroflavin also reacts avidly with oxygen, and H2O2 is the predominant product. In contrast, succinate dehydrogenase, with high potential clusters, generates O 2⨪ exclusively. The identities of enzyme autoxidation products are significant because O 2⨪ and H2O2 damage cells in different ways.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13635-13640Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). In aerobic environments, mutant organisms that cannot scavenge endogenous O 2⨪ and H2O2typically grow poorly or die, indicating that these species are formed in potentially toxic doses inside living cells (12Carlioz A. Touati D. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 623-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar, 13Seaver L.C. Imlay J.A. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 7173-7181Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). Similar toxicity occurs in wild-type organisms when they are exposed to higher-than-usual levels of oxygen, evidently because these species are formed at elevated rates. Despite this progress, the mechanisms of O 2⨪ and H2O2 formation are less well understood. Molecular oxygen is a triplet species that can only accept electrons one at a time from potential donors (14Naqui A. Chance B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 137-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). This restriction ensures that oxygen does not spontaneously oxidize most reduced biomolecules, such as NAD(P)H, which are obligate two-electron donors. Instead, enzymes that are competent univalent electron donors are the most likely effectors of inadvertent oxygen reduction. Such enzymes are prominent in electron transport chains. Accordingly, studies in Escherichia coli determined that NADH dehydrogenase II, succinate dehydrogenase, sulfite reductase, and fumarate reductase each formed O 2⨪ and H2O2 when the reduced enzymes were exposed to oxygen (15Messner K.R. Imlay J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10119-10128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 16Imlay J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19767-19777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These autoxidizing enzymes contain flavins and either iron-sulfur clusters or quinones, all of which are competent at univalent redox reactions. However, in each case the flavin appeared to be the primary site of electron transfer to oxygen. This trend has been noted in other autoxidizing enzymes as well. This may be due to the solvent accessibility of the flavins, which are situated at the protein surface in order to interact with soluble substrates. In contrast, the iron-sulfur clusters are typically buried within polypeptide, and quinones may be sequestered in hydrophobic regions of the protein-membrane interface where O 2⨪ formation is disfavored. Interestingly, the rates at which flavoenzymes leak electrons to oxygen vary over several orders of magnitude (15Messner K.R. Imlay J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10119-10128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 17Massey V. Strickland S. Mayhew S.G. Howell L.G. Engel P.C. Matthews R.G. Schuman M. Sullivan P.A.

Yoshida L.S. Kakinuma K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18695-18701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that additional factors must govern turnover number. We are hopeful that some of these factors might be revealed by study of members of the succinate dehydrogenase/fumarate reductase family (Fig.1). These enzymes are structurally and functionally similar to one another (20Ackrell B.A.C. Johnson M.K. Gunsalus R.P. Cecchini G. Muller F. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Flavoproteins. 3.

Acta. 2002; 1553: 140-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), and each autoxidizes, albeit at different rates. Succinate dehydrogenase (Sdh),1 a primary respiratory dehydrogenase, catalyzes electron transfer from succinate to membrane-bound quinone. Fumarate reductase (Frd) catalyzes the opposite reaction in its service as a terminal oxidase during the anaerobic growth of some bacteria and eukarya. The physical structure of theE. coli fumarate reductase has been determined (23Iverson T.M. Luna-Chavez C. Cecchini G. Rees D.C. Science. 1999; 284: 1961-1966Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar), and the pathways of electron movement through both it and succinate dehydrogenase have been well studied (20Ackrell B.A.C. Johnson M.K. Gunsalus R.P. Cecchini G. Muller F. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Flavoproteins. 3. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1992: 229-297Google Scholar, 21Iverson T.M. Luna-Chavez C. Schroder I.

Acta. 2002; 1553: 140-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). A notable distinction between the enzymes is that the iron-sulfur clusters are poised at higher potentials in Sdh than in Frd. This arrangement favors electron flow away from the flavin and toward the quinone-binding site in Sdh, and toward the flavin in Frd, and is consonant with the physiological directions of the enzymes. However, Frd and Sdh are sufficiently similar that each can functionally substitute for the other in E. coli (24Guest J.R. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1981; 122: 171-179PubMed Google Scholar, 25Maklashina E. Berthold D.A. Cecchini G. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5989-5996Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Aspartate oxidase is a newly recognized member of the succinate:fumarate oxidoreductase family (26Mortarino M. Negri A. Tedeschi G. Simonic T. Duga S. Gassen H.G. Ronchi S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 418-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 27Tedeschi G. Negri A. Mortarino M. Ceciliani F. Simonic T. Faotto L. Ronchi S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 427-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). It catalyzes the first step in the nicotinamide biosynthetic pathway, oxidizing aspartate to iminoaspartate. Aspartate oxidase has a flavoprotein structure homologous to those of Frd and Sdh, but it lacks their iron-sulfur clusters and membrane attachment subunits (28Seifert J. Kunz N. Flachmann R. Laufer A. Jany K.-K. Gassen H.G. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1990; 371: 239-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 29Mattevi A. Tedeschi G. Bacchella L. Coda A. Negri A. Ronchi S. Structure. 1999; 7: 745-756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 30Bossi R.T. Negri A. Tedeschi G. Mattevi A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3018-3024Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). It has conventionally been considered to use oxygen as its natural electron acceptor, forming H2O2 as a stoichiometric product, but recent in vitro studies (27Tedeschi G. Negri A. Mortarino M. Ceciliani F. Simonic T. Faotto L. Ronchi S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 427-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) revealed that it can use fumarate as well. This observation raises the possibility that fumarate is its natural substrate in vivo and that the reported formation of H2O2 occurs in vitro because the enzyme adventitiously transfers electrons to oxygen, in the manner of Frd and Sdh. An earlier study (16Imlay J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19767-19777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) found that Frd adventitiously generates O 2⨪ at a higher rate in vitro than any other native metabolic enzyme yet characterized. Indeed, overproduction of Frd debilitated superoxide dismutase-deficient E. coli when it was exposed to oxygen, and lack of the enzyme was protective. In contrast, Sdh generated considerably less O 2⨪. It was speculated that the ability of the reduced flavins to react with oxygen might derive from partial flavosemiquinone character, which could be created when one electron from the reduced flavin delocalized onto the adjacent iron-sulfur clusters. Alternatively, it is also possible that a dihydroflavin is the autoxidizing species. The issue is of interest, because if the latter were true, then in principle many simple flavoproteins could contribute to the formation of endogenous O 2⨪. The degree and type of endogenous oxidative stress that a cell experiences depend upon the rates at which its enzymes autoxidize and upon whether O 2⨪ or H2O2 is the predominant product. This study examined the Frd/Sdh family to explore reasons that its members react so rapidly with oxygen. We also sought to identify the factors that govern whether O 2⨪ or H2O2 is formed. Most chemicals were purchased from Sigma or Fisher. Amplex Red was from Molecular Probes, and catalase was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. In vitro experiments used house-deionized water that was further purified with a Labconco Water Pro PS system. Membrane vesicles containing Frd were prepared from cells grown either in LB medium supplemented with 0.2% glucose or in minimal A medium (31Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 37-47Google Scholar) supplemented with 0.05% casamino acids and either 40 mm glucose, 40 mmglucose plus 40 mm fumarate, or 40 mm glycerol plus 40 mm fumarate. Standard antibiotic concentrations were used for plasmid maintenance and P1 transductions (31Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 37-47Google Scholar). Media for anaerobic cultures were degassed by autoclaving and then moved into a Coy anaerobic chamber (5% H2, 10% CO2, and 85% N2) and equilibrated for at least 36 h before inoculation. Sdh-containing membranes were prepared from strain KM5 (ΔfrdABCD ubiA420 menA401 katG14 pGS133 expressingsdhCDAB) grown on LB + 0.2% glucose. To allow robust growth of this quinone-deficient strain, the culture was grown for 4 generations anaerobically and then, to enhance expression of Sdh, aerated for a final generation of growth before harvesting atA 600 = 0.6. P1-mediated transduction and plasmid transformation were conducted by standard methods (31Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 37-47Google Scholar). For strains bearing the ubiA420 menA401 alleles, 1 mm p-hydroxybenzoic acid was added to the medium (16Imlay J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19767-19777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) during strain construction to prevent reversion. ThekatG17::Tn10 and katG14alleles were confirmed by the absence of the hydroperoxidase I/catalase band on an activity gel (32Gregory E.M. Fridovich I. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 58: 57-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). ThesdhC4::kan r allele was verified by loss of succinate:plumbagin oxidoreductase activity from the membranes of cells grown aerobically in LB medium. TheΔ(frdABCD)18 null allele was screened by loss of benzyl viologen:fumarate oxidoreductase activity in membranes of cells grown anaerobically on glucose/fumarate medium. The nadB gene encoding l-aspartate oxidase was amplified by PCR from a crude cell lysate of E. coli strain MG1655. The primers were 5′-GCTATCTAGACCAAACCATGTTTAGTA-3′ and 5′-AGGCCTCGAGTCTGTTTATGTAATGAT-3′. The PCR products were ligated into a Promega pGEM-T PCR vector, and the plasmid was transformed intoE. coli NK6042 (nadB::Tn10) to verify complementation of the nicotinic acid auxotrophy. AnXbaI-XhoI fragment containing the gene was then ligated into pET28a (Novagen). In strain BL21(DE3) (Novagen) this construct allowed expression of the full coding region of thenadB gene, followed at the C terminus by the amino acids Leu-Glu-His6. Cells expressing Frd or Sdh were lysed by French press, and membrane vesicles were isolated as described previously (16Imlay J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19767-19777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except that cells grown in minimal A media were generally harvested in early stationary phase (A 600 0.5–07) rather than in mid-exponential phase. For Frd purification, membranes were prepared from strain KM32 (sdhC4::kan r katE katG14, pH 3, encoding wild-type Frd) and prepared by Triton X-100 extraction (33Lemire B.D. Weiner J.H. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 126: 377-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE gel analysis indicated that these preparations were ∼95–98% pure (data not shown). Further purification by glycerol gradient (33Lemire B.D. Weiner J.H. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 126: 377-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) resulted in some depletion of the protein bands that correspond to FrdC and FrdD (see “Results”); therefore, Frd was prepared without this step. For purification of the His-tagged l-aspartate oxidase, BL21(DE3) + pETNADB was grown to an A 600 of 0.3 and then induced with 1.0 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Cells were harvested at an A 600 of 0.6, washed, and resuspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm imidazole buffer, pH 7.9, that contained 0.5 m NaCl and 20 μm FAD. The cells were lysed by two passages through a French press. The lysate (∼5 ml) was then eluted from a His-Bind column (2.5 ml, Novagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Fractions were collected and assayed for l-aspartate oxidase (27Tedeschi G. Negri A. Mortarino M. Ceciliani F. Simonic T. Faotto L. Ronchi S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 427-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Homogeneity of the protein was confirmed by SDS-PAGE (data not shown). Unless otherwise noted assays were conducted at 37 °C. Conversion of l-aspartate to oxaloacetate (l-aspartate oxidase activity) was performed as described by Tedeschi et al. (27Tedeschi G. Negri A. Mortarino M. Ceciliani F. Simonic T. Faotto L. Ronchi S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 427-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). One mml-aspartate was used unless otherwise indicated. Assays to be conducted in partially or fully anaerobic conditions were set up in the Coy anaerobic chamber. Aerobic buffer was brought into the chamber in air-tight syringes, and the amount needed to reach the desired oxygen concentration was mixed with anaerobic buffer and other reaction components in sealable cuvettes. After mixing and sealing, the cuvettes were removed from the chamber to the spectrophotometer. Time lapsed between the start of reactions and the first time point was 20 s or less. Superoxide generation was assayed by the standard cytochrome c reduction method (34McCord J.M. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 6049-6055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Imlay J.A. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6957-6965Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using 10 μm cytochrome c. Twenty units/ml CuZn-superoxide dismutase was added in a parallel reaction to quantify any superoxide-independent, direct electron transfer from the superoxide-generating enzyme to cytochrome c; this rate was subtracted from the overall rate to yield the rate of superoxide formation. For the enzyme systems considered in this paper, the amount of direct electron transfer to cytochrome c was always less than 50% of the total. Controls showed that the enzyme substrates used in this study did not interfere with detection of superoxide at the concentrations used. Unless otherwise noted, assays were conducted in air-saturated 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.8, buffer at 37 °C. Reaction time was generally 3–5 min. Horseradish peroxidase-based assays of hydrogen peroxide were employed with either the chromogenic substrate o-dianisidine (36Misra H.P. Fridovich I. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 79: 553-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) or the fluorogenic Amplex Red (37Zhou M. Diwu Z. Panchuk-Voloshina N. Haugland R.P. Anal.

The H2O2-generating reactions were run, and 1-ml samples were removed and added to 30 μl of 600 mmfumarate (unless already present) to halt autoxidation of the enzyme. In the o-dianisidine method, samples were then mixed with 100 μl of a mixture containing 150 μm o-dianisidine and 60 μg/ml type II horseradish peroxidase; after a 1-min incubation, the sample absorbance was read at 460 nm. For the Amplex Red method, after the addition of fumarate, the 1-ml samples were mixed with 0.5 ml of 45 μg/ml Amplex Red and 0.5 ml of 20 μg/ml horseradish peroxidase, and after 1 min fluorescence was read in a Shimadzu RF-mini 150 fluorometer using a 460 nm excitation filter and 520 nm emission filter. The absorbance and fluorescence values were converted into H2O2 content using standard curves. At the concentrations that were used, the enzyme substrates did not interfere with detection of H2O2. The sample chamber of the spectrophotometer was enclosed within a thermally controlled water jacket. Reaction components were heated or chilled to the reaction temperature before assembly of the reaction mixture. The reaction rateversus temperature curves were biphasic, with a slowly responsive component at lower temperatures and a highly responsive component at higher temperatures. Membrane phase effects (38Silvius J.R. McElhaney R.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 1255-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and oxaloacetate present in the enzyme preparations (39Ackrell B.A.C. Cochran B. Cecchini G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 268: 26-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) likely explain this behavior. The linear portion of this curve (generally between 25 and 50 °C) was used to determine the energy of activation using the Arrhenius equation. Three ml of solubilized Frd (12.5 μm) was placed in a cuvette and warmed to 20 °C, and an initial UV-visible spectrum was taken. Small additions (<1 μl) of 10–500 μm sulfite were made to the sample, and the sample was allowed to equilibrate until the spectrum remained constant (15–30 min). After scanning, further additions of sulfite were then made in the same manner, until no further spectroscopic response was apparent. The total time for the experiment was ∼5 h, during which time the Frd showed little (<5%) loss of activity. A binding constant was calculated (40Massey V. Muller F. Feldberg R. Schuman M. Sullivan P.A. Howell L.G. Mayhew S.G. Matthews R.G. Foust G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 3999-4006Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using the assumptions that the decrease in absorbance value at 460 nm (the wavelength with the strongest response to sulfite) was proportional to sulfite binding to the enzyme and that the absorbance value at 20 mmSO 32− represented a fully titrated enzyme. Covalent FAD attached to membrane-bound Frd and Sdh and to solubilized Frd was measured as described by Singer et al. (41Singer T.P. Salach J. Hemmerich P. Ehrenberg A. Methods Enzymol. 1971; 18: 416-427Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The histidyl-FAD cofactors in Frd and Sdh represent the only sources of covalent flavin in E. coli cell membranes; hence, insdh mutants the covalent flavin content of the membranes represents their Frd content and vice versa. Noncovalent FAD content was measured by fluorescence as described (42Blaut M. Whittaker K. Valdovinos A. Ackrell B.A.C. Gunsalus R.P. Cecchini G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13599-13604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A previous report (16Imlay J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19767-19777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that E. coli fumarate reductase generates abundant superoxide when the reduced enzyme is exposed to oxygen. It was assumed that the electron transfer was an adventitious event, since molecular oxygen is not present during the normal function of the enzyme as a terminal reductase in the anaerobic electron transport chain. To verify this, the rate of superoxide production was measured as a function of the concentration of dissolved oxygen (Fig. 2,circles). For these experiments, membrane vesicles were prepared from a strain with mutations that blocked the synthesis of succinate dehydrogenase, to avoid interference from this Frd homologue, and of respiratory quinones, so that electrons supplied by succinate could not move beyond Frd to other respiratory chain components. The first-order dependence upon oxygen concentration confirmed that superoxide formation is a chemical event and indicates that no long lived complex between the enzyme and oxygen is formed. This behavior resembles that of several other autoxidizing flavoenzymes (15Messner K.R. Imlay J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10119-10128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The turnover number that has been estimated for superoxide formation by Frd is much higher than those of most other enzymes, and it has been suggested that the electronic structure of this enzyme may predispose it to the formation of solvent-exposed flavosemiquinone. Because free flavosemiquinones transfer single electrons rapidly to molecular oxygen (43Muller F. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1987; 3: 215-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 44Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 36: 22459-22462Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar), this model would explain the high turnover number and would predict that superoxide, rather than hydrogen peroxide, would be the product that is released. Both superoxide and hydrogen peroxide formation were measured from membrane vesicles containing Frd. In initial experiments we observed that hydroperoxidase I/catalase either adhered to or was trapped within the membrane vesicles and prevented the recovery of H2O2; therefore, the structural gene for this enzyme was also eliminated. When Frd was reduced by succinate, both superoxide and hydrogen peroxide were generated steadily (Fig. 3). Hydrogen peroxide is formed as a result of dismutation of two molecules of superoxide, and so a corresponding amount of H2O2 detection was expected based on O 2⨪ generation. However, the H2O2 yield was significantly greater than could be accounted for by the spontaneous dismutation of superoxide, indicating that some H2O2 was formed directly by the enzyme. This result appeared to contradict the idea that flavosemiquinone was the sole autoxidizing species and prompted a more detailed examination of Frd behavior. We wished to determine whether the H2O2 was generated from the same enzyme site as was O 2⨪. The flavin has been proposed to be the site of O 2⨪ production, primarily because O 2⨪ formation is suppressed by excess substrate, which is presumed to bind opposite the FAD and thereby obstruct the access of oxygen to the reduced flavin (16Imlay J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19767-19777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4 A, high concentrations of succinate also blocked H2O2formation. Notably, maximal H2O2 formation required more succinate than did maximal O 2⨪ formation (see below). However, half-inhibition of overall enzyme oxidation occurred at 8.8 mm succinate (Fig. 4 A, solid line), consistent with a recent report (45Leger C. Heffron K. Pershad H.R. Maklashina E. Luna-Chavez C. Cecchini G. Ackrell B.A.C. Armstrong F.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11234-11245Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) that succinate binds to the reduced flavin of Frd with K D = 9 mm at pH 7.5. Malonate is an inhibitor of Frd that also binds at the flavin site. When 100 μm malonate was included in the reactions, the malonate inhibited both O 2⨪ and H2O2generation when succinate concentrations were low but had no detectable effect when succinate concentrations exceeded 5 mm (data not shown). This lack of further effect at high succinate concentrations affirms the idea that excess succinate inhibits autoxidation by occupying the flavin active site, making malonate addition redundant. To confirm that the flavin is the site of autoxidation, we examined the rate of superoxide production by a mutant Frd in which the electron density is shifted from FAD toward the iron-sulfur clusters. The flavin of the FrdA H44C mutant has a low reduction potential because it lacks the covalent histidyl linkage to FAD (42Blaut M. Whittaker K. Va"

It was independently identified as a transcriptional regulator of a fat cell-specific enhancer element (1Tontonoz P. Graves R.A. Budavari A.I. Erdjument-Bromage H. Lui M., Hu, E. Tempst P.

A key regulatory role for PPARγ in fat differentiation was demonstrated by gain of function experiments, which showed that ectopic expression and activation of this factor in fibroblasts or myoblasts promoted adipogenesis (3Tontonoz P., Hu, E.

PPARγ activity is regulated by the binding of ligands and by the subsequent docking of coactivators. Several natural occurring ligands of relatively low affinity have been identified, including various fatty acids and prostaglandins (9Kliewer S.A. Lenhard J.M. Willson T.M. Patel I. Morris D.C.

Synthetic ligands such as the antidiabetic thiazoledinediones (pioglitazone, rosiglitazone, and troglitazone) and certain tyrosine analogs are effective agonists and bind with K d values between 5 and 750 nm (11Lehmann J.M.

The binding of agonist ligands to nuclear receptors promotes the docking of coactivator proteins such as members of the p160/SRC family, p300/CBP, and p300/CBP-associated factor, all of which exhibit histone-acyltransferase activity (13Zhu Y., Qi, C. Calandra C. Rao M.S. Reddy J.K. Gene Expr. 1996; 6: 185-195PubMed Google Scholar). In addition PPARγ can also dock the tissue-selective coactivators PGC-1α and -β, although these docking events are not ligand-gated (14Puigserver P., Wu, Z. Park C.W. Graves R. Wright M. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1998; 92: 829-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3102) Google Scholar, 15Lin J. Puigserver P. Donovan J. Tarr P. Spiegelman B.M. J. Biol.

PPARγ also binds to PBP/DRIP205/TRAP220, initially identified as a PPARγ-binding protein and subsequently characterized as a component of the mediator-like coactivator complex DRIP/TRAP/ARC (16Zhu Y., Qi, C.

S. A. 1998; 95: 7939-7944Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). This protein complex is essentially devoid of histone-acyltransferase activity and is believed to associate directly with the general transcription factors of the preinitiation complex. Recent studies illustrate that PBP/TRAP220/DRIP205 is absolutely required for PPARγ-mediated adipogenesis (19Ge K. Guermah M. Yuan C.X. Ito M. Wallberg A.E. Spiegelman B.M. Roeder R.G. Nature. 2002; 417: 563-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). PPARγ is present in two isoforms, PPARγ1 and PPARγ2, generated by alternative promoter usage; PPARγ2 has an additional 30 N-terminal amino acids relative to PPARγ1. The expression of PPARγ2 is restricted mainly to fat, whereas PPARγ1 is expressed in fat and many other tissues. Our earlier report indicated that both PPARγ1 and PPARγ2 could stimulate adipogenesis when introduced into fibroblastic cells (3Tontonoz P., Hu, E. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1994; 79: 1147-1156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3132) Google Scholar). However, conclusions concerning the inherent adipogenic potential of these individual receptors are compromised by the fact that ectopic expression of PPARγ1 turns on endogenous PPARγ2 (3Tontonoz P., Hu, E. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1994; 79: 1147-1156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3132) Google Scholar). In an attempt to circumvent this problem, one recent report has utilized engineered artificial transcriptional suppressors of the endogenous PPARγ gene in combination with ectopic expression of the individual isoforms. This study concluded that PPARγ2 is adipogenic and PPARγ1 is not (20Ren D. Collingwood T.N. Rebar E.J. Wolffe A.P. Camp H.S. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). To avoid problems associated with these engineered suppressors and to investigate this key question in a more formal genetic way, we now make use of cells completely lacking a functional PPARγgene to reassess the adipogenic action of PPARγ1 and PPARγ2. Our studies clearly illustrate that both PPARγ isoforms can drive the differentiation of fully functional fat cells. However, under limiting levels of a PPARγ ligand, PPARγ2 has an enhanced ability to promote differentiation and to interact with PBP/DRIP205/TRAP220. PPARγ1 and PPARγ2 cDNAs were cloned into PMSCV-puro retroviral vector for infections. PPARγ1 and PPARγ2 baculovirus constructs were obtained by subcloning full-length PPARγ1 and PPARγ2 into pAcGHLT (Pharmingen). Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin in 5% CO2. For differentiation assays, cells were treated with 0.5 mm3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, 5 μg/ml insulin, and 1 μmdexamethasone for 2 days, and, subsequently, cells were kept in maintenance medium consisting of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum supplemented with penicillin/streptomycin and insulin (5 μg/ml). Oil red O staining of differentiated adipocytes was performed as described previously (3Tontonoz P., Hu, E. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1994; 79: 1147-1156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3132) Google Scholar). 95% confluent U2OS cells were transiently transfected with 25 ng of PPARγ1 or PPARγ2 retroviral constructs or empty vector, with 100 ng of DR1-luc, using FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to manufacturer's instructions. 24 h after transfection, cells were treated with various ligand concentrations, and 24 h later, the luciferase levels were measured. TRAP220−/− cells (19Ge K. Guermah M. Yuan C.X. Ito M. Wallberg A.E. Spiegelman B.M. Roeder R.G. Nature. 2002; 417: 563-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar) were cotransfected with 25 ng of PPARγ1 or PPARγ2 and 100 ng of DR1-luc in the absence or presence of 400 ng of TRAP220. After 24 h, cells were treated with 10 nm rosiglitazone, and 48 h after treatment, cells were harvested for luciferase measurements. For retrovirus preparation, the Bosc23 packaging cell lines were transfected with PMCV retroviral PPARγ1 and PPARγ2 constructs or vector, according to the protocols described previously (14Puigserver P., Wu, Z. Park C.W. Graves R. Wright M. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1998; 92: 829-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3102) Google Scholar). PPARγ knockout cells were plated the day before infection and infected with the viral supernatant at 70% confluence. After an 8–12-h incubation with virus and 8 μm/ml Polybrene, cells were split 1:3 and selected with 2 μm/ml puromycin for 1 week. RNA was extracted from cultured cells using Trizol (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. 10–15 μg of RNA were run on an agarose formaldehyde gel and transferred on nylon membrane (ICN) by Northern blotting using 10× SSC. Hybridizations were performed using Quickhyb (Stratagene) according to manufacturer's instructions. Whole cell extracts were obtained using phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 2 mm sodium vanadate, 100 mm sodium fluoride, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin and leupeptin. 100–150 μg of protein were used for Western blots using PPARγ antibody (E8) obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Cells were induced to differentiate with a differentiation mixture (as described under “Cell Culture”). At day 7 of differentiation, 90–95% of cells accumulated lipid droplets. Glucose uptake was measured after 24 h of starvation in low-glucose medium supplemented with 0.5% bovine serum albumin. For glucose uptake assays, cells were treated for 8 min with 100 nm insulin, and deoxyglucose uptake was measured as described previously (21Wu Z. Xie Y. Morrison R.F. Bucher N.L. Farmer S.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 22-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). For fatty acid uptake, radiolabeled oleic acid (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was added to fully differentiated adipocytes at time 0. After 0, 3, or 6 h, cells were sonicated, and lipids were extracted from cell homogenates in chloroform/methanol. Incorporation of radiolabeled oleic acid was measured through scintillation counting. RNA collected from fully differentiated PPARγ1 and PPARγ2 cells was labeled with [α-33P]dCTP. Transcriptional profiling experiments were performed on custom DNA arrays composed of ∼2,500 mouse cDNAs, half of which were from a mouse fat library (22Herman M.P. Sukhova G.K. Libby P. Gerdes N. Tang N. Horton D.B. Kilbride M. Breitbart R.E. Chun M. Schonbeck U. Circulation. 2001; 104: 1899-1904Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Duplicate filters per probe were used. The hybridization was done as described previously (22Herman M.P. Sukhova G.K. Libby P. Gerdes N. Tang N. Horton D.B. Kilbride M. Breitbart R.E. Chun M. Schonbeck U. Circulation. 2001; 104: 1899-1904Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). The data generated were analyzed using the SOM clustering program. Baculovirus-infected insect Sf21 cells were collected at day 2 after infection. GST PPARγ proteins were extracted using lysis buffer containing 400 mm KCl, 20 mmTris, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. After incubating the lysate with GST beads, PPARγ protein bound to the beads was quantified by Coomassie Blue staining. Ligand binding assays were performed with radiolabeled BRL, as described previously (23Sarraf P. Mueller E. Smith W.M. Wright H.M. Kum J.B. Aaltonen L.A. de la Chapelle A. Spiegelman B.M. Eng C. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 799-804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). The coactivator interaction assays were performed using 1 μg of baculovirus PPARγ protein with35S-labeled in vitro-translated coactivators. Briefly, GST-PPARγ beads were incubated with35S-labeled in vitro-translated coactivators (Promega) at 25 °C in the presence or absence of 10 nmrosiglitazone, according to a previously described protocol (14Puigserver P., Wu, Z. Park C.W. Graves R. Wright M. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1998; 92: 829-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3102) Google Scholar). After 1–2 h, beads were washed three times with 1 ml of binding buffer with or without 1 μm rosiglitazone and loaded on an 8% SDS gel. We investigated the adipogenic action of PPARγ isoforms utilizing PPARγ-deficient cells. We infected immortalized 3T3 fibroblasts null for PPARγ (24Rosen E.D. Hsu C.H. Wang X. Sakai S. Freeman M.W. Gonzalez F.J. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 22-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (1117) Google Scholar) with an empty retroviral vector or with vectors expressing murine PPARγ1 or PPARγ2. Both RNA and protein for the two PPARγ isoforms were present in undifferentiated cells at virtually identical levels after drug selection for stable viral integration (Fig. 1 A). These levels of PPARγ are approximately equal to those seen in differentiated adipocytes (data not shown). The cells were then stimulated to differentiate according to two different protocols. In the first set of experiments, strong induction stimuli were used: cells were treated for 2 days with a mixture commonly used to stimulate differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells, including dexamethasone, insulin, and isomethylbutylxanthine, plus the further addition of the PPARγ ligand rosiglitazone. At day 7 after induction, we observed extensive lipid accumulation in cell lines expressing either PPARγ1 or PPARγ2 (Fig.1 B). In addition to showing similar morphological changes, these cell lines also expressed similar levels of mRNA for molecular markers of white fat differentiation such as aP2and CD36 (Fig. 1 C). No induction of endogenous PPARγ2 protein was observed in differentiated PPARγ1 cells, confirming the total ablation of the PPARγ gene in these cells (data not shown). Similar effects on differentiation and gene expression were obtained when these cells were induced to differentiate with dexamethasone, insulin, and isomethylbutylxanthine in the absence of ligand (data not shown). The development of insulin-sensitive glucose uptake is a very important part of the adipose differentiation program. The results shown in Fig.2 A indicate that insulin-stimulated glucose uptake is similar in cells induced to differentiate by either PPARγ 1 or PPARγ2. We also measured the uptake of fatty acids in these cell lines and found that it is also similar in both cell lines (Fig. 2 B). To investigate whether PPARγ1 and PPARγ2 can regulate similar sets of genes, we performed global transcriptional profiling using mRNA isolated from cells differentiated through PPARγ1 and PPARγ2 expression and activation. As shown in TableI, most of the genes associated with adipogenic differentiation or lipid metabolism are induced similarly by both isoforms, indicating that both PPARγ1 and PPARγ2 are competent to activate an adipogenic gene program. Fig. 2 C illustrates that genes involved in the Krebs cycle, such as aconitase precursor and malate dehydrogenase, appear to be similarly induced in cells differentiated by the two different isoforms. However, a few genes appear to be regulated differently, at least quantitatively. For example, genes of the glycolytic pathway, such asphosphofructokinase and phosphoglycerate kinase, are induced to a greater extent in PPARγ1 cells, whereas certain other genes associated with differentiation, such asadipsin, are induced at higher levels in PPARγ2 cells.Table IGenes induced in PPARγ −/− cells after reexpression of PPARγ1 or PPARγ2Acc#G1-G2Pentose phosphate pathwayGlucokinaseM587550.9Hexokinase IIM689721.3Glucose-6-phosphate 1-dehydrogenase XQ006121.06-phosphogluconate dehydrogenaseP522091.1TransketolaseU908890.9GlycolysisPhosphofructokinaseP123822.2Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenaseM325991.8Phosphoglycerate kinaseP094112.8Lipid metabolismAcetyl-CoA carboxylaseP114971.2Glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenaseD504301.4Acyl-CoA desaturase 2P130112.3Lipoprotein lipase precursorP111520.8Fatty acid synthaseP190960.9Hormone-sensitive lipaseU400011.1DGATAF0787521.0CD36L231080.8β OxidationCarnitine O-acetyltransferaseP479341.0Acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, medium chain-specificP459520.7Acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, long chain-specificP511740.9Peroxisomal acyl-CoA oxidaseAF0066880.8AdipogenesisAdipsinP039530.5ACRP30U372220.9Glucose transporter type 4P193571.7Uncoupling protein 2P565000.9Caveolin-1P498170.8Transcription factorsC/EBP αP535661.0STAT5P422301.0Pyruvate metabolismNADP-dependent malic enzymeP068011.1Lactate dehydrogenase A-4M175161.7Pyruvate dehydrogenase protein X componentO003300.9Pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 component β subunitP494321.0Pyruvic carboxylaseP114981.0Krebs cycleAconitate hydrataseP162760.9Fumarate hydrataseP144080.9Mitochondrial dicarboxylate carrierAJ2233551.1Respiratory chainElectron transfer flavoprotein α subunitM220301.0Electron transfer flavoprotein-ubiquinone oxidoreductaseQ161340.8Ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase complex core protein IP318000.9ATP synthase β chainP564801.0ATP synthase lipid-binding protein P3P563841.0Mitochondrial trifunctional enzyme α subunitQ644280.9NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase chain 1P038880.8Carnitine metabolism4-trimethylaminobutyraldehyde dehydrogenaseAF1709190.8Amino acid metabolismNeutral amino acid transporter BP519120.7Alanine aminotransferaseP254090.9Excitatory amino acid transporter 1P565640.9Ketogenesis3-Hydroxyisobutyrate dehydrogenaseP292660.8Shown here is a list of genes involved in lipid and glucose metabolism and in adipogenesis, induced by PPARγ1 and PPARγ2 fully differentiated cells. For each gene, the accession number is indicated as Acc#, and the ratio between the expression values in PPARγ1 and PPARγ2 cells has been calculated (G1-G2). Open table in a new tab Shown here is a list of genes involved in lipid and glucose metabolism and in adipogenesis, induced by PPARγ1 and PPARγ2 fully differentiated cells. For each gene, the accession number is indicated as Acc#, and the ratio between the expression values in PPARγ1 and PPARγ2 cells has been calculated (G1-G2). Whereas the data presented above illustrate clearly that both PPARγ isoforms can drive adipogenesis, it is reasonable to suppose that the extracellular influences may not be as consistently pro-adipogenic as the conditions that we have used. We therefore stimulated cells more gently, using only insulin and a titration of the PPARγ ligand levels. Fig. 3 Ashows that PPARγ1 and PPARγ2 drive cells to differentiate to differing extents when the ligand concentrations are submaximal. Both lipid accumulation and expression of mRNA for the adipogenic markeraP2 are higher in PPARγ2 cells than in PPARγ1 cells in response to rosiglitazone at 10 and 50 nm (Fig.3 B); this difference is lost at 100 nm. Interestingly, more lipid accumulation and aP2 mRNA are also apparent in PPARγ2 cells when no ligand is added. To determine whether these differences in adipogenic action correlated with differences in transcriptional function of the two isoforms, their transcriptional activities were examined at low concentrations of rosiglitazone. As shown in Fig. 3 C, PPARγ2 can activate a multimerized PPAR response element linked to luciferase more effectively than PPARγ1, both in the absence of rosiglitazone and at low doses of rosiglitazone. This difference, which is 2–3-fold at 10 nm rosiglitazone, is <30% at 1 μmrosiglitazone. The differences in adipogenic and transcriptional activity between PPARγ1 and PPARγ2 observed at low ligand concentrations could be due to differential affinity for agonists or could reflect other aspects of receptor function. To investigate the molecular basis of these differences, we first produced both PPARγ isoforms as full-length proteins in insect cells using baculovirus vectors. These were subsequently purified and used to investigate ligand binding capacity. As shown in Fig.4 A and B, PPARγ1 and PPARγ2 bind rosiglitazone and 15d-Δ12,14PGJ2 with essentially identical affinities. Because nuclear receptors are known to activate transcription through docking of specific coactivator proteins, we assessed whether the quantitative differences in the ability of the two PPARγ isoforms to induce differentiation could reflect a difference in their ability to recruit known coactivators. We therefore performed in vitrointeraction assays in the presence or absence of a low concentration of ligand using baculovirus purified full-length proteins and coactivators produced as in vitro-translated proteins in reticulocyte lysates. As shown in Fig. 5 A,the interactions of the two PPARγ isoforms with both PGC-1α and SRC-1 are comparable in the presence or absence of rosiglitazone. In contrast, two members of the DRIP/TRAP complex, PBP/DRIP205/TRAP220 and DRIP150/TRAP170, appear to have a quantitative preference for PPARγ2 in both the absence and presence of added ligand. PPARγ docks DRIP150/TRAP170 independently of added ligand, consistent with the idea that this subunit of the DRIP/TRAP complex may bind to the N terminus of PPARγ, as shown previously for the glucorticoid receptor (25Hittelman A.B. Burakov D. Iniguez-Lluhi J.A. Freedman L.P. Garabedian M.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5380-5388Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). To critically analyze the role of the DRIP/TRAP complex in the differential effects of PPARγ1 and PPARγ2, we utilized fibroblasts lacking the DRIP205/TRAP220 subunit of the DRIP/TRAP complex. Mice lacking DRIP205/TRAP220 die embryonically at day 11.0, and a DRIP205/TRAP220 −/− cell line was obtained by immortalizing cells isolated from embryonic day 10.0 littermate embryos (19Ge K. Guermah M. Yuan C.X. Ito M. Wallberg A.E. Spiegelman B.M. Roeder R.G. Nature. 2002; 417: 563-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). We utilized this cell line to analyze first whether the differences in transcriptional activity between PPARγ1 and PPARγ2 are dependent on TRAP220. As shown in Fig. 5 B, in the absence of TRAP220, both PPARγ1 and PPARγ2 show an identical ability to transactivate the multimerized PPAR response element reporter gene in either the absence or presence of a low concentration (10 nm) of rosiglitazone. The addition of exogenous DRIP205/TRAP220 coactivator partially restores differential transcriptional activation observed between the two isoforms, with or without ligand addition. These data suggest a functional significance in the preferential interaction between DRIP205/TRAP220 and PPARγ2. A key question regarding the PPARγ isoforms is whether they can both stimulate fat cell differentiation in culture and in vivo. Whereas the latter cannot be answered with confidence, we provide definitive genetic evidence here that PPARγ1 and PPARγ2 can individually drive a full program of adipogenesis in culture. Both isoforms can stimulate lipid accumulation, the development of insulin-sensitive glucose uptake, and a pattern of gene expression that is very similar. Translating these results to an in vivosetting must be purely speculative. It is notable that a difference in relative adipogenic action of the two PPARγ isoforms becomes clear at lower ligand concentrations, with PPARγ2 more adipogenic at 10–50 nm rosiglitazone, approximating the K dof the receptor. If we assume that ligand levels are limiting in vivo, these results imply that the PPARγ2 isoform is quantitatively more adipogenic. This might provide a biological rationale for the adipose-selective expression of the PPARγ2 protein. These data are quite different from those of Ren et al.(20Ren D. Collingwood T.N. Rebar E.J. Wolffe A.P. Camp H.S. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar), who conclude that the PPARγ1 protein has no adipogenic action. Their experiments, like ours, used strong adipogenic conditions, including treating the cells with the mixture containing 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, insulin, and dexamethasone. The suppression of expression of the endogenous PPARγ gene in 3T3-L1 cells was achieved by using an engineered repressor and subsequently reexpressing each individual PPARγ protein for comparison. It is possible that the effects observed by Ren et al. (20Ren D. Collingwood T.N. Rebar E.J. Wolffe A.P. Camp H.S. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar) could be due to a differential level of expression of the PPARγ1 isoform relative to the PPARγ2 isoform apparent in their protein data. Alternatively, it is possible that some other nonspecific effects of their artificial repressor blocked the adipogenic action of PPARγ1 through unknown mechanisms. In our study, the greater adipogenic activity of PPARγ2 compared with PPARγ1 correlates with better binding to PBP/DRIP205/TRAP220 and DRIP150/TRAP170 and, presumably, the entire DRIP/TRAP/ARC complex. Furthermore, the higher transcriptional activity of PPARγ2 compared with PPARγ1 seems to be dependent on the presence of the DRIP205/TRAP220 subunit. Because recent data have indicated an absolute genetic requirement for DRIP205/TRAP220 for the adipogenic action of PPARγ, this may provide a mechanistic basis for the quantitatively greater adipogenic action of PPARγ2. At the present time, very little is known about the precise function of the N terminus of PPARγ or any nuclear receptor, for that matter. The present study, combined with earlier work showing that a substantial portion of adipogenic action of PPARγ is carried in the N terminus (26Castillo G. Brun R.P. Rosenfield J.K. Hauser S. Park C.W. Troy A.E. Wright M.E. Spiegelman B.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3676-3687Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), suggests a real need to determine how this part of PPARγ functions in mechanistic detail. We thank Dr. Leonard Freedman for kindly providing the DRIP205 and DRIP150 in vitro-translatable plasmids. We thank Drs. Ashim Anand, Christopher Walkey, and Jiandie Lin for helpful suggestions."

We have found previously that mice deleted in the Nth homologue still retain at least two residual glycosylase activities for thymine glycol. We report herein that in cell extracts from the mNth1 knock-out mouse there is a third thymine glycol glycosylase activity that is encoded by one of three mammalian proteins with sequence similarity to E. coli Fpg (MutM) and Nei (endonuclease VIII).

Recombinant NEIL1 can remove thymine glycol and 5-hydroxyuracil in double- and single-stranded DNA much more efficiently than 8-oxoguanine and can nick the strand by an associated (β-δ) apurinic/apyrimidinic lyase activity. In addition, the mouse NEIL1 has a unique DNA glycosylase/lyase activity toward mismatched uracil and thymine, especially in U:C and T:C mismatches.

Shigenaga M.K. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1992; 663: 85-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 2Beckman K.B. Ames B.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19633-19636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar). Major oxidative damage includes premutagenic lesions and lesions that block replicative DNA polymerases. A typical example of a premutagenic lesion is 8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG),1 which can form a base pair with adenine, as well as with cytosine, resulting in G:C to T:A transversion. In contrast to 8-oxoG, a major replication-blocking lesion generated by reactive oxygen species in vivo is thymine glycol (Tg). Therefore, both 8-oxoG and Tg are often used as biomarkers for oxidative stress and aging (3Ames B.N. Mutat. Res. 1989; 214: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 4Le X.C. Xing J.Z. Lee J. Leadon S.A. Weinfeld M. Science. 1998; 280: 1066-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Despite the importance of Tg, repair pathway of Tg in mammalian cells is not well understood. It has been well established that the most important repair pathway for the removal of mutagenic or toxic oxidative base damage is base excision repair (BER). The marked evolutionary conservation of BER enzymes from bacteria to mammals (5Memisoglu A. Samson L. Mutat. Res. 2000; 451: 39-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 6Nilsen H. Krokan H.E. Carcinogenesis. 2001; 22: 987-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) suggests the importance of BER for life and has enabled the identification of various mammalian homologues through database searches using the nucleotide sequences encoding well characterized Escherichia coli and yeast enzymes. Three mammalian genes for oxidative DNA repair glycosylases, OGG1, MYH, and NTH1, have been identified in this way. In addition, the growing amount of information provided by genome and cDNA sequencing projects has elucidated species-specific differences between enzymes involved in the conserved BER reaction. Prokaryotes employ Fpg glycosylase for repair of oxidized purines, whereas eukaryotes use OGG1, which has almost no amino acid sequence similarity with the bacterial Fpg protein. A homologue of OGG1 is also found in archaea (7Gogos A. Clarke N.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30447-30450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), whereas Arabidopsis thaliana has both Fpg and OGG1 (8Garcia-Ortiz M.V. Ariza R.R. Roldan-Arjona T. Plant Mol. Biol. 2001; 47: 795-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). E. coli possesses two DNA glycosylases for repair of oxidized pyrimidine, Nth and Nei, which are structurally unrelated but functional homologues. nth/nei double-deficient bacteria, but not the single mutant, show sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide and ionizing radiation (9Jiang D. Hatahet Z. Blaisdell J.O. Melamede R.J. Wallace S.S. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3773-3782Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Saito Y. Uraki F. Nakajima S. Asaeda A. Ono K. Kubo K. Yamamoto K. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3783-3785Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Nth is one of the most widespread DNA glycosylases in eukaryotes, as well as prokaryotes, whereas the Nei orthologs are rarely found in bacteria and are even absent in theSaccharomyces cerevisiae, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, and Drosophila melanogaster genomes. Although this distribution suggests that mammalian species may also lack Nei homologues, three Fpg/Nei DNA glycosylase-like sequences have recently been registered in a full-length cDNA database (NEDO human cDNA sequencing project; www.nedo.go.jp/bio/). We have characterized these Fpg Nei-Like genes and their repair activities in recombinant proteins. During preparation and submission of this manuscript, these clones have been reported (11Hazra T.K. Izumi T. Boldogh I. Imhoff B. Kow Y.W. Jaruga P. Dizdaroglu M. Mitra S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3523-3528Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar, 12Bandaru V. Sunkara S.

We have recently established Nth1 knock-out mice to investigate the biological consequences of oxidative pyrimidine repair deficiency (14Takao M. Kanno S. Shiromoto T. Hasegawa R. Ide H. Ikeda S. Sarker A.H. Seki S. Xing J.X., Le, C. Weinfeld M. Kobaashi K. Miyazaki J. Muijtjens M. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. van der Horst G. Yasui A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3486-3493Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the NTH1-deficient mice lack overt phenotypic abnormalities. Moreover, Tg produced in the mutant mouse liver DNA by X-irradiation disappeared with time, though more slowly than in the wild-type mouse. Biochemical analysis of NTH1-deficient mouse liver extracts showed that there are at least two Tg-DNA glycosylase back-up activities. One activity designated as TGG1 (thymine glycol glycosylase 1) is a monofunctional DNA glycosylase found mainly in the mitochondria, and the other TGG2 forms a Schiff base reaction intermediate, which is indicative of a nuclear AP lyase-associating enzyme. Because we found three human NEIL genes in the database, we analyzed the enzymatic activity of the proteins in vitro and in vivo and their relationships to residual glycosylase activities inmNth1 knock-out mice. Primers for the PCR were designed based on the cDNA sequences in GenBankTM(AK026055 for FLJ22402/hNEIL1, AK056206 for FLJ31644, AK001720 for FLJ10858, and AK013322 for mouse ortholog of FLJ22402/mNEIL1). The cDNA for human FLJ31644, FLJ10858, or mNEIL1 was amplified from a cDNA pool reverse-transcribed from mRNA from HeLa cells, keratinocytes, or NTH1-deficient mouse liver, respectively. The cDNA for hNEIL1 was amplified from a commercial human testis cDNA library (Invitrogen). The cDNA was synthesized with a kit using oligo(dT) primers (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The amplified fragment was subcloned in pSTBlue-1 (Novagen). Multiple clones obtained were sequenced extensively to exclude mutants generated by PCR. The sequence of any reamplified fragment was also verified. These sequence data have been submitted to the DDBJ/GenBankTM/EBI database under accession number AB079068 (human NEIL1), AB079069 (mouse NEIL1/FLJ22402), AB079070 (human NEIL2/FLJ31644), and AB079071 (human NEIL3/FLJ10858). The initial PCR mentioned above was made with a 5′-primer containing Kozak's sequence (ACC) in front of the initiation codon. The cDNA fragment was subcloned into a pSPUTK vector (Stratagene). In vitroexpression was performed with a Quick TNT system (Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine for the detection of protein production or cold methionine for activity screening. The translated products were analyzed on SDS-PAGE with a 10–20% gradient gel (Daiichi Pure Chemicals). Quantitative PCR was performed using a LightCycler (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) with a DNA Master SYBR Green I kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the system and kit instructions. A mouse multiple tissue cDNA panel was purchased from Clontech. Amplimers used were as follows: mouse glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene (Gapdh) primers, 5′-CCTTGGCTCCTGCATGTGCCCAAT and 5′-CATGTAGGCCATGAGGTCCACCAC; Nth1 primers, 5′-GCCACAGGCCCGTGAGACATCCACGGAGAA and 5′-GCACTTGCATCATAGCAGTGCTCG; Neil1 primers, 5′-CTGACCCTGAGCCAGAAGATCAA and 5′-CCCAGCTGTGTCTCCTGTGACTT. Standard curves were obtained by quantitative PCR with a known amount of linearized plasmid DNA containing the respective cDNA. Prior to quantification, the cDNA panel was re-equalized by PCR for Gapdh. Data were expressed relative to the expression of Gapdh. An epitope tag (FLAG sequence) was added to mNeil1 cDNA by PCR. The tagged cDNA was subcloned in a mammalian expression vector pTargeT (Promega). COS-7 cells were transfected with the construct using FuGENE6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The transiently expressed protein was detected by an anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma-Aldrich) and an Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated second antibody (Molecular Probes). The incision assay was made with a 30-mer oligonucleotide containing a single modified base indicated byX, 5′-CTCGTCAGCATCTXCATCATACAGTCAGTG-3′. Oligos containing Tg, 8-oxoG, and the tetrahydrofuran AP site (fAP) were generously provided by Dr. S. Iwai (Tokyo University). Oligos containing 5-hydroxyuracil (5-OHU) and uracil were synthesized and purified by Japan Bio-Service. The oligo was labeled using either T4-polynucleotide kinase (TaKaRa) with [γ-32P]ATP (5000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences) or terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (Invitrogen) with [α-32P]ddATP (5000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences). The incision reaction was performed in reaction buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin) containing 1 fmol/μl of either double-stranded DNA or single-stranded DNA at 30 °C for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by addition of an equal volume of 90% formamide loading dye solution. The samples were heated at 75 °C for 2 min and run on a 20% polyacrylamide gel containing 7m urea. The gel was exposed to an imaging plate and analyzed with a BAS2000 image analyzer (Fuji photo film). The densitometric analysis of the gel image was performed with NIH Image software. For the reaction with in vitro translated gene products, the reacted DNA was hydrolyzed with alkaline as described previously (15Takao M. Zhang Q.-M. Yonei S. Yasui A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3638-3644Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Briefly, the DNA was phenol/chloroform-extracted and ethanol-precipitated. The DNA was dissolved in 0.1 m NaOH and incubated at 95 °C for 5 min to convert the abasic DNA into the nicked form. In some experiments, we used T4 endonuclease V as “AP lyase” enzyme for detecting monofunctional DNA glycosylase, as well as for assays with crude extract (14Takao M. Kanno S. Shiromoto T. Hasegawa R. Ide H. Ikeda S. Sarker A.H. Seki S. Xing J.X., Le, C. Weinfeld M. Kobaashi K. Miyazaki J. Muijtjens M. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. van der Horst G. Yasui A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3486-3493Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). To characterize the terminal structure of the incision products, 3′-labeled or 5′-labeled DNA digests were treated with bacterial alkaline phosphatase (TaKaRa) or with T4 polynucleotide kinase in a buffer containing 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 6.0), 10 mmMgCl2, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, respectively (16Cameron V. Uhlenbeck O.C. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 5120-5126Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). A His6-tagged expression construct was made by subcloningmNeil1 into pET21 vector (Novagen). The E. coliBL21 codon plus (Stratagene) was transformed and cultured at 37 °C until A 600 reached 0.6. After induction with 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 25 °C for 6 h, Ni-NTA (Qiagen) column chromatography was performed under native conditions according to the manufacturer's instructions. The recombinant NEIL1 protein was eluted in a 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) containing 100 mm NaCl and 250 mm imidazole. The eluate was directly loaded onto HiTrap-SP (Amersham Biosciences), and the active fractions eluted in phosphate buffer containing 0.5–0.7 M NaCl were pooled. The purified NEIL1 protein was concentrated to 1 mg/ml and stored in 25 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmEDTA, and 50% glycerol at −20 °C. Because the activity gradually decreased, the quantitative and comparative experiments were made with the same purification lot within 2 days. For DNA trapping, the recombinant NEIL1 protein or column fraction of mouse cell extracts was mixed with 100 mm NaCNBH3 in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) containing 10 mm EDTA on ice. Labeled Tg-containing oligo (final concentration, 5 fmol/μl) was added and incubated at 30 °C for 60 min. The 50-μl reaction mix was applied on a Sephadex G-50 microcolumn (Amersham Biosciences) to remove the reductant. The enzyme-DNA complex was separated on a 10–20% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and autoradiographed. For limited proteolysis experiments, a portion of the G-50 gel-filtrated sample was digested further either by trypsin or chymotrypsin. Partial purification of Tg-DNA glycosylase activities from NTH1-deficient mouse liver nuclear extracts has been described in a previous paper (14Takao M. Kanno S. Shiromoto T. Hasegawa R. Ide H. Ikeda S. Sarker A.H. Seki S. Xing J.X., Le, C. Weinfeld M. Kobaashi K. Miyazaki J. Muijtjens M. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. van der Horst G. Yasui A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3486-3493Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In brief, nuclear proteins were extracted in Buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm dithiothreitol) with 0.3 mNaCl. The supernatant was dialyzed in Buffer B (50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mm dithiothreitol. 1 mmEDTA, 10% glycerol) with 0.1 m NaCl and applied to heparin-agarose and eluted with Buffer B containing 0.8 mNaCl. The fraction was dialyzed and applied to an UNO S-1 column in an HPLC system (Bio-Rad). Incision assays and trapping assays were conducted on the flow-through fraction, the fractions separated by a linear gradient of 0.1–0.6 m NaCl, and the fraction eluted by stepwise increase of NaCl from 0.6 to 1.0 m. A BLAST homology search of GenBankTM using theE. coli Nei sequence as query yielded three human sequences for hypothetical proteins (FLJ22402, FLJ31644, and FLJ10858) that exhibit significant similarity to E. coli Fpg and Nei (Fig.1). From this similarity we designate these Fpg-Nei-like proteins as follows (13Hazra T.K. Kow Y.W. Hatahet Z. Imhoff B. Boldogh I. Mokkapati S.K. Mitra S. Izumi T. J. Biol.

The human NEIL1, NEIL2, and NEIL3 genes map on chromosomes 15, 8, and 4, respectively. The respective cDNA structure and approximate positions of introns inferred from its genomic sequence are shown in Fig. 1 B. The crystal structures of Thermus thermophilus Fpg and Nei show a significant homology (17Sugahara M. Mikawa T. Kumasaka T. Yamamoto M. Kato R. Fukuyama K. Inoue Y. Kuramitsu S.

The structural analysis suggests further that a protein potentially belonging to the Fpg-Nei protein family has six conserved DNA-contacting elements in its sequence: the N-terminal active site, turn β3-β4, turn β5-β6, turn β8-β9, helix-two-turn-helix (H2TH) motif, and zinc-finger motif (numbering of the β-sheets refers to Tth-Fpg structure; see Ref. 17Sugahara M. Mikawa T. Kumasaka T. Yamamoto M. Kato R. Fukuyama K. Inoue Y. Kuramitsu S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3857-3869Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Indeed, these domains are highly conserved among the known and putative prokaryotic Fpg and Nei sequences in the database. To assess a possible DNA binding capacity of the human proteins, we searched for the DNA-contacting elements and re-aligned the NEIL sequences with Fpg or Nei (Fig. 1 A). All three proteins contain a H2TH motif, representing a helix-hairpin-helix motif widespread in DNA-binding proteins including many DNA glycosylases (19Shao X. Grishin N.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2643-2650Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The prototype helix-hairpin-helix motif has a consensus GhG (h is a hydrophobic residue) sequence between the two helices that is found in all three proteins. Moreover, the three NEIL proteins have absolutely conserved residues (Asp, Asn, and Glu) specific for the H2TH motif of the Fpg-Nei family. The NEIL1 and NEIL2 proteins contain the conserved N-terminal active site residues, Pro-2 and Glu-3, whereas in the NEIL3 protein the Schiff base-forming Pro-2 (18Zharkov D.O. Rieger R.A. Iden C.R.

The zinc-finger motif is conserved in NEIL3 and to a lesser extent in NEIL2, whereas both retain the invariable Arg and Gln at the appropriate positions. Interestingly, the NEIL1 protein does not show any homology to Fpg or Nei in the C-terminal region of the H2TH motif. Nevertheless, the NEIL1 sequence alone exhibits all the three DNA-contacting turns (β3-β4, β5-β6, and β8-β9) with great resemblance to Fpg or Nei. The relative position of these potential DNA-contacting elements is depicted schematically in the respective cDNA structure (Fig.1 B). To establish the function of these putative glycosylases, we first cloned the cDNAs for human NEIL1, NEIL2, and NEIL3, as well as the cDNA for mouse NEIL1 ortholog, by PCR. The NEIL3 protein appears to have an additional domain in the C-terminal half. This domain shows local homology to topoisomerase III (TOP3) and a C-terminal domain of APE2 (22Tsuchimoto D. Sakai Y. Sakumi K. Nishioka K. Sasaki M. Fujiwara T. Nakabeppu Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2349-2360Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), a protein having an AP-endonuclease-like sequence with unknown function. We used in vitro expressed proteins to screen for enzymatic activity. As shown in Fig. 1 C, we could produce full-length NEIL1 and NEIL2 proteins using the rabbit reticulocyte lysate. For NEIL3, we were unable to obtain a full-size product and thus examined a truncated protein, NEIL3 (1–289), that is encoded by exons from 1 to 6. This polypeptide lacks the C-terminal domain but covers the entire Fpg-Nei-like domain. The translation mixtures were incubated with 5′-labeled 30-mer DNA containing a single Tg at a defined position to detect the strand incision activity. The reaction was conducted by inducing a strand incision at an abasic site to follow up a monofunctional DNA glycosylase having no incision activity. As shown in Fig.1 D, the rabbit lysate itself showed a slight background incision activity, probably because of rabbit enzymes (luciferase-expressing lane as a negative control in Fig.1 D). The reactions for NEIL2 and NEIL3 (1–289) did not yield nicked products above the background signal. On the other hand, the reactions for human NEIL1 and its mouse ortholog resulted in an obvious incision, suggesting that NEIL1 is a Tg-nicking DNA glycosylase. Because we anticipated that the NEIL1 gene product could be a back-up enzyme for Tg removal found in Nth1−/− mice, the mouse NEIL1 protein was characterized intensively. We produced a recombinant mouse NEIL1 tagged with His6 at its C terminus in E. coli (Fig.2 A, arrow) and recovered the protein from the soluble fraction of the whole cell extracts. Mouse NEIL1 was purified to apparent homogeneity by affinity chromatography through a Ni-NTA column and a HiTrap-SP ion-exchange column (Fig. 2 A) and analyzed for Tg-DNA nicking activity (Fig. 2 B). The yield (6 mg/liter culture) and the apparent homogeneity ensured that the observed Tg-DNA nicking activity (Fig.2 B) was derived from the recombinant NEIL1, rather than from contaminating host cell enzymes. This recombinant NEIL1 enzyme was used to further optimize the reaction conditions. The enzyme did not require a divalent cation, was resistant to EDTA up to 20 mm, and displayed comparable activity between pH 6 and 9 (data not shown). The activity was reduced markedly under high salt conditions (Fig.2 C). Because the specific activity decreased during storage (t 1/2 at −20 °C for ∼2 weeks), all quantitative experiments were performed within 2 days after purification of each batch. Purified recombinant human His6-NEIL1 protein exhibited similar Tg-DNA nicking activity (data not shown), indicating that both human and mouse NEIL1 are functional DNA glycosylases to Tg. By analogy with E. coli Fpg and Nei (23Tchou J. Kasai H. Shibutani S. Chung M.H. Laval J. Grollman A.P. Nishimura S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4690-4694Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar, 24Jiang D. Hatahet Z. Melanmede R.J. Kow Y.W. Wallace S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32230-32239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), it can be expected that mammalian NEIL1 not only acts as DNA glycosylase but subsequently catalyzes β- and δ-elimination reactions that result in a strand nick with a one-nucleotide gap. We therefore examined the terminal structure of the 5′-incision and 3′-incision fragment at the position of the nick using 5′-labeled or 3′-labeled substrate, respectively. Analysis of the incision products in a high resolution gel revealed that the 5′-end of the 3′-incision fragment (Fig.3 A) or the 3′-end of the 5′-incision fragment (Fig. 3 B) had a phosphate group, which could be dephosphorylated by specific DNA phosphatases. From these data we concluded that the mammalian enzyme has (β-δ) AP lyase activity, as is the case with bacterial Fpg and Nei. Primary substrates for E. coli Nth and Nei are oxidized pyrimidines whereas Nei also shows 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase activity (25Blaisdell J.O. Hatahet Z. Wallace S.S. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6396-6402Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Hazra T.K. Izumi T. Venkataraman R. Kow Y.W. Dizdaroglu M. Mitra S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27762-27767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). To determine the substrate specificity of mammalian NEIL1, we prepared oligonucleotide substrates containing a modified base at a defined position in the same sequence context. DNA lesions tested include two oxidized pyrimidine lesions, Tg and 5-OHU; an oxidized purine lesion, 8-oxoG; and an AP lesion. Using an amount of enzyme that cleaved about 50% of the Tg:A substrate as a reference, the nicking efficiency toward the other substrates was evaluated (Fig.4 A). NEIL1 cleaved Tg and 5-OHU to a similar extent but cleaved 8-oxoG much less efficiently. A further increase in the amount of NEIL1 added to 8-oxoG:C or 8-oxoG:A substrates invoked only marginal incision (Fig. 4 C). The nicking of the AP substrate was a little more efficient than that of the Tg:A substrate (Fig. 4 C). Interestingly, NEIL1 was able to cleave a single-strand substrate containing Tg, 5-OHU, and AP (Fig.4 A, lanes ss). Also, nicking at the modified base occurred with weak preference for the opposite DNA base (Fig.4 D, C ≅ T ≅ G ≥ A). NEIL1 (with an excess amount) did not cleave an unmodified base opposite Tg and 5-OHU (Fig.4 B), which implies that the enzyme does not produce a double-strand break at the lesion. Taken together, the findings indicate that the primary substrates of NEIL1 are oxidized pyrimidines in double-stranded, as well as single-stranded, DNA in any opposite base context. While examining the substrate specificity for NEIL1 and other NEIL proteins, we noticed that NEIL1 showed some activity toward uracil. As shown in Fig. 5, Aand B, the recombinant mouse NEIL1 protein incised the uracil-containing substrate only when the uracil was mispaired (U:C > U:G ≅ U:T). The incision activity of NEIL1 to U:C substrate was much stronger than that to 8-oxoG substrates (Fig. 4). Activity toward a U:A substrate could not be detected, whereas nicking of U:G and U:T was less efficient than that of U:C, and the plot of the nicking of U:G and U:T as a function of protein amount showed a threshold (Fig. 5, arrowheads). Because we showed that NEIL1 activity toward oxidized pyrimidines does not depend on the opposite base, we assumed that a major determinant for the observed nicking activity would be a mismatched state rather than the uracil base structure. Therefore, we also examined substrates containing the following simple pyrimidine mismatch: T:G, T:C, T:T (Fig.5 C), and C:A, C:C, C:T (Fig. 5 D). We observed that NEIL1 preferentially incised T:C, as well as U:C (Fig.5 C). The incisions toward the other mismatches occurred to some extent but again showed a threshold effect in the enzyme amount. Matched duplex DNA and single-stranded, unmodified DNA were not incised in these experiments (data not shown). Taken together, these results suggest that NEIL1 recognizes and nicks uracil and thymine mismatches with a preference of cytosine as the opposite base. Both mouse and human NEIL1 protein sequences show potential nuclear localization signals near the C terminus (see Fig.8). Indeed, as expected for a DNA repair protein, FLAG-tagged NEIL1 protein localized in the nucleus when expressed in COS-7 cells (Fig.6 A).Figure 6Subcellular localization and tissue expression.

An equalized cDNA panel (Clontech) was used for real-time, quantitative PCR with amplimers for Neil1, Nth1, andGapdh (control).

Because NTH1 and NEIL1 target the same Tg substrate, this redundancy might also be reflected at the level of tissue-dependent expression. To address whether Neil1 expression is ubiquitous or specific in tissues, we performed a quantitative PCR assay using an equalized tissue mouse cDNA panel. Fig. 6 B shows the expression levels of Nth1 and Neil1 compared in various tissues, relative to the mouse glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Gapdh) used as a control. The highest expression levels of Nth1 are observed in oxygen-exposed lung, whereas the lowest Nth1 mRNA levels are detected in skeletal muscle (approximately 50 times lower than lung). For most tissues, expression of Neil1 is lower than that of Nth1. Exceptions are the spleen (comparable expression level toNeil1 and Nth1) and heart and skeletal muscle (Neil1 more abundantly"
https://openalex.org/W2097864691,"Hox proteins control morphological diversity along the anterior-posterior body axis of animals, but the cellular processes they directly regulate are poorly understood. We show that during early Drosophila development, the Hox protein Deformed (Dfd) maintains the boundary between the maxillary and mandibular head lobes by activating localized apoptosis. Dfd accomplishes this by directly activating the cell death promoting gene reaper (rpr). One other Hox gene, Abdominal-B (Abd-B), also regulates segment boundaries through the regional activation of apoptosis. Thus, one mechanism used by Drosophila Hox genes to modulate segmental morphology is to regulate programmed cell death, which literally sculpts segments into distinct shapes. This and other emerging evidence suggests that Hox proteins may often regulate the maintenance of segment boundaries."

It can exist in multiple phosphorylated states, enabling interaction with Mediator complex for regulation of transcription initiation, with Elongator complex for chromatin modification during RNA chain elongation, and with various enzymes for RNA capping, splicing, and cleavage/polyadenylation (3Myers L.C.

Interconversion between the multiple phosphorylated states of the CTD depends on a diverse set of kinases and phosphatases, revealed by biochemical studies of transcription in vitro and by genetic studies of CTD function in yeast in vivo (1Carlson M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 1-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 2Oelgeschlager T. J. Cell. Physiol. 2002; 190: 160-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The CTD is believed to be unphosphorylated during assembly of a transcription initiation complex (7Corden J.L. Curr. Opin. Genet.

It is then phosphorylated on Ser-5 of the consensus heptapeptide, Tyr-Ser-Pro-Thr-Ser-Pro-Ser, by a Cdk/cyclin pair of subunits (Kin28/Ccl1 in yeast, Cdk7/cyclin H in human cells) of the general transcription factor TFIIH (9Feaver W.J. Svejstrup J.Q. Henry N.L. Kornberg R.D. Cell. 1994; 79: 1103-1109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). During subsequent RNA chain elongation, the predominant site of CTD phosphorylation shifts to Ser-2, dependent upon Ctk1 in yeast, homologous to the Drosophila kinase P-TEFb and to human Cdk9 (10Komarnitsky P. Cho E.J. Buratowski S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2452-2460Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar). Distinct roles of Ser-2 and Ser-5 are also indicated by genetic evidence, showing different effects of partial substitution at these positions on yeast cell viability and differential responses to suppressor mutations (11Yuryev A. Corden J.L. Genetics. 1996; 143: 661-671Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Yet another Cdk/cyclin pair capable of CTD phosphorylation has been revealed by a genetic screen in yeast. Truncation of the yeast CTD from 27 to 10 repeats leads to conditional lethality (4Lee T.I. Young R.A. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2000; 34: 77-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). Suppressors of the truncation phenotype, termed Srbs, were isolated, and all but four were identified as components of the Mediator complex, which binds to the CTD in its unphosphorylated state. The four Srbs that did not copurify with Mediator, Srb proteins 8, 9, 10, and 11, are implicated by genetic evidence in repression of a subset of yeast genes (1Carlson M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

Here, we report on the isolation of a yeast Srb8/9/10/11 complex and its phosphorylation site specificity. We identify human homologs of the four yeast proteins, pointing to extensive conservation of the Mediator and associated complexes between yeast and human cells. A single colony of an Srb11-TAP-tagged yeast strain was grown in 1.5 liters of YPD (1% (w/v) yeast extract, 2% (w/v) Bacto-Peptone, 2% (w/v) glucose to stationary phase (18 h at 30 °C). This culture was used to inoculate a 200-liter fermentor, and cells were harvested in mid-log phase, suspended in an equal volume of 2× lysis buffer, and frozen in liquid nitrogen or used immediately for extract preparation. Lysis was by bead-beating, with 300 ml of cell suspension and 220 ml of glass beads in a stainless steel Hamilton beat-beater chamber immersed in a salt-ice bath (the ratio of cells to beads was crucial for efficient lysis). Following 40 cycles of bead-beating for 30 s and cooling for 90 s, the glass beads were removed by filtration and washed with one volume of 1× lysis buffer. (Glass beads are recycled by washing in a column with glass soap, extensive rinsing with water, washing with 70% ethanol, and drying at 80 °C). The combined cell lysate and wash were centrifuged in a Beckman JA10 rotor at 10,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was adjusted first to 200 mm ammonium sulfate and then 0.2% (w/v) polyethyleneimine, followed by stirring for 20 min. Centrifugation in a Beckman JA14 rotor at 15,000 rpm for 45 min at 4 °C pelleted bulk nucleic acids. The Srb8/9/10/11 complex was precipitated from the supernatant by the addition of ammonium sulfate to 50% of saturation, stirring for 30 min, and centrifugation in a Beckman JA14 rotor at 15,000 rpm for 45 min at 4 °C. The precipitate was stored overnight on ice or frozen at −80 °C, resuspended in buffer A, diluted with the same buffer to a conductivity of 100 mS (equivalent to 500 mm ammonium sulfate), and centrifuged in a Beckman JA20 rotor at 15,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was loaded on an IgG-agarose column (1 ml of beads for material from 150 g of cells) at three column volumes per hour at 4 °C. The column was washed with 30 volumes of buffer B and 10 volumes of buffer C. One column volume of TEV protease in buffer C (100 units of enzyme/200 μl of beads) was applied, the column was incubated for 1 h at room temperature, and Srb complex was eluted with one column volume of buffer C. 2× lysis buffer consisted of 300 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9 at 4 °C, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, 1 mm DTT (freshly added), and protease inhibitors (freshly added).

IgG beads bearing Srb complexes, prepared as described above, were additionally washed with high salt (1 m NaCl) and 0.5% Triton X-100. Reactions were performed with wild type or mutant Srb-IgG beads (1.5 μl/reaction, containing ∼30–50 ng of protein), or with 30 ng of yeast TFIIH, purified as described (25Svejstrup J.Q. Feaver W.J. LaPointe J. Kornberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28044-28048Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures (30 μl) contained 20 mmHEPES-KOH, pH 7.6, 7.5 mm magnesium acetate, 2 mm DTT, 100 mm potassium acetate, 5% glycerol, 50 mm NaF, and 40 mm β-glycerophosphate. For radioactive labeling of RNA polymerase II and GST-CTD proteins, reaction mixtures contained 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and 1 μm unlabeled ATP. For reactions with phosphorylated CTD peptides (15 ng), no unlabeled ATP was added. Reactions were stopped after 30 min of incubation at room temperature, and the products were analyzed by 5% SDS-PAGE. For immunoblot analysis, the kinase reaction was performed for 10 min, followed by 10% SDS-PAGE, transfer to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and detection with antibodies against CTD phosphorylated at Ser-2 and Ser-5 (antibodies H5 and H14 from Covance).

Comparisons of C. albicans and S. cerevisiaesequences to the S. pombe data base employed full-length protein sequences with matrix blosum 62. For comparison of human TRAP230 and TRAP240, matrix blosum 60 was used and the low complexity filter was on. For analysis of TRAP230, the C terminus was omitted, because it contains large stretches of glutamine repeats. The open reading frame number for S. pombe Srb8/TRAP230 is SPAC688.08; that for Srb9/TRAP240 is SPAC589.02C. Sequences were manually aligned with the Wisconsin Package (Wisconsin Package version 10.2, Genetics Computer Group, Madison, WI). Results were displayed with the program Macboxshade from the Institut Suisse de Recherche Experimentale sur le Cancer. Whereas homogeneous Mediator from yeast lacks Srb8, -9, -10, and -11 (27Myers L.C. Gustafsson C.M. Bushnell D.A. Lui M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Kornberg R.D. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), less rigorously purified preparation of Mediator-RNA polymerase II complexes include these additional proteins (12Liao S.M.

Nature. 2002; 415: 141-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (4008) Google Scholar). Preparations of mammalian Mediator complexes have been variously reported to include homologs of Srb10 (Cdk8) and Srb11 (cyclin C) as well (29Malik S. Roeder R.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 277-283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). To gain further insight into the native state of these Srb proteins, we introduced a TAP tag at the C terminus of Srb11 in yeast (20Rigaut G. Shevchenko A. Rutz B. Wilm M. Mann M. Seraphin B. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 1030-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (2286) Google Scholar). A whole cell extract from the tagged strain was fractionated by PEI precipitation, ammonium sulfate precipitation, and adsorption of tagged proteins on IgG-Sepharose. Elution was by cleavage of the TAP tag with TEV protease. SDS-PAGE revealed four major polypeptides in the eluate, present in roughly stoichiometric amounts, as well as a minor polypeptide and the TEV protease (Fig.1). Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization reflectron time-of-flight mass spectrometric analysis of in-gel digested protein identified the major polypeptides as Srb8, -9, -10, and -11, and the minor polypeptide as the heat shock protein Ssa1. The presence of Srb10 was also confirmed by immunoblotting with the use of anti-Srb10 antibodies. The purified Srb8/9/10/11 complex proved capable of phosphorylating both RNA polymerase II (Fig. 2 A) and a GST-CTD fusion protein (Fig. 2 B). This phosphorylation had no effect on the electrophoretic mobility of the protein, in contrast with phosphorylation by TFIIH, which produces a mobility shift from the starting (“IIa”) position to that characteristic of a hyperphosphorylated state (“IIo”). Evidently, the Srb8/9/10/11 complex phosphorylates the CTD on one or a small number of repeats, whereas TFIIH acts processively, phosphorylating most or all repeats. Phosphorylation by the Srb8/9/10/11 complex was not caused by a contaminant in the purified preparation, because it was abolished by a mutation of Srb10 known to eliminate kinase activity (D290A). In reactions with the GST-CTD fusion protein, analyzed by SDS-PAGE to reveal comparatively small proteins, an additional phosphorylated protein was observed, which could be attributed to phosphorylated Srb11, analogous to results obtained for the human homolog Cdk8 (15Ramanathan Y. Rajpara S.M. Reza S.M. Lees E. Shuman S. Mathews M.B. Pe'ery T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10913-10920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The site of CTD phosphorylation by the Srb8/9/10/11 complex was investigated with site-specific antibodies, site-directed CTD mutants, and phosphorylated CTD peptides. Both anti-Ser(P)-2 (H5) and anti-Ser(P)-5 (H14) antibodies recognized the product of RNA polymerase II phosphorylation by wild type Srb complex (Fig. 2 C). In contrast, only the anti-Ser(P)-5 (H14) antibody recognized the product of TFIIH phosphorylation, as expected (14Trigon S. Serizawa H. Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C. Jackson S.P. Morange M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6769-6775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 30Zhou M. Halanski M.A. Radonovich M.F. Kashanchi F. Peng J. Price D.H. Brady J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5077-5086Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Previous studies have employed mutant CTD peptides and mutant GST-CTD fusion proteins containing serine to alanine substitutions. These studies revealed selectivity of both Srb10 (Cdk8) and TFIIH kinases for Ser-5. In agreement with this work, we find that phosphorylation by the Srb8/9/10/11 complex is abolished when Ser-5 is replaced by alanine (Fig. 3 A). It was recently observed, however, that replacement of Ser-5 by alanine alters the conformation of the CTD, whereas replacement of Ser-2 has no effect (31Bienkiewicz E.A. Moon Woody A. Woody R.W. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 119-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated the replacement of serine residues in GST-CTD fusion proteins by glutamine rather than alanine. When Ser-5 was replaced by glutamine, phosphorylation by the Srb8/9/10/11 complex was undiminished (Fig. 3 A). When Ser-2 was replaced by glutamine, phosphorylation was substantially increased (∼16-fold). In contrast, replacement of Ser-5 by glutamine abolished TFIIH kinase activity, whereas replacement of Ser-2 had no effect (data not shown). These data indicate that the Srb complex phosphorylates both Ser-2 and Ser-5, previous reports notwithstanding. Finally, the Srb8/9/10/11 complex was capable of phosphorylating CTD peptides already phosphorylated on either Ser-2 and Ser-5 (Fig.3 C), in contrast with previous work of others on human Cdk8 (15Ramanathan Y. Rajpara S.M. Reza S.M. Lees E. Shuman S. Mathews M.B. Pe'ery T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10913-10920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). This discrepancy might reflect differences in experimental conditions (number of heptapeptide repeats or reaction time) or an actual difference between the yeast and human kinases. Whereas human homologs of Srb10 and Srb11 have already been identified (32Ito M. Yuan C.X. Malik S., Gu, W. Fondell J.D. Yamamura S., Fu, Z.Y. Zhang X. Qin J. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 361-370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar), the evolutionary conservation of Srb8 and Srb9 has not yet been established. Indeed, direct comparison reveals no homologs ofS. cerevisiae Srb8 and Srb9 in the human sequence data base. Comparisons with other fungal sequences proved, however, to lead to human homologs (Fig. 4 A). A Blast search with the S. cerevisiae Srb8 sequence (ScSrb8) and the S. pombe data base identified an S. pombehomolog (SpSrb8 = SPAC688.08) with high confidence (P(N) = 4.3−10), especially in the N-terminal region. For Srb9, the partial sequence of a C. albicans homolog was used to identify an S. pombehomolog (SpSrb9 = SPAC589.02C). A Blast search with TRAP230 or TRAP240 protein sequences against theS. pombe data base identified the same homologs (SpTRAP230/Srb8 = SPAC688.08; SpTRAP240/Srb9 = SPAC589.02C). The conservation of the N-terminal region of Srb8/TRAP230 was sufficient for manual alignment of the sequences from six organisms widely separated in evolution (Fig. 4 B). Our data are supported by the finding that SpSrb9/TRAP240 and SpSrb8/TRAP230 can be found associated with a form of the S. pombeMediator. 2V. Baraznenok, C. O. Samuelsen, H. Spahr, T. Kiesselbach, S. Holmberg, and C. M. Gustafsson, manuscript in preparation; C. M. Gustafsson, personal communication. The evidence reported here for the association of Srb proteins 8, 9, 10, and 11 in a discrete complex and for their evolutionary conservation is consonant with many previous biochemical and genetic results. Two types of human Mediator have been described: large complexes (TRAP/SMCC, ARC/DRIP, hMed, and NAT), which include hSrb8 (TRAP230), hSrb9 (TRAP240), hSrb10 (Cdk8), and hSrb11 (cyclin C); and smaller complexes (CRSP and PC2) from which these four subunits are absent (29Malik S. Roeder R.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 277-283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Thus, TRAP230, TRAP240, Cdk8, cyclin C, and their counterparts in yeast exhibit related association behavior in yeast and human systems. There is extensive genetic evidence for the involvement of Srb8, -9, -10, and -11 in transcriptional repression in yeast (1Carlson M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 1-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), and Srb10 and -11 have been shown to repress transcription in a cell-free system (13Hengartner C.J. Myer V.E. Liao S.M. Wilson C.J. Koh S.S. Young R.A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 43-53Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Moreover, Srb8, -9, -10, and -11 can be found in association with the CCR4-NOT complex, which is involved in general negative regulation of transcription (34Liu H.Y. Chiang Y.C. Pan J. Chen J. Salvadore C. Audino D.C. Badarinarayana V. Palaniswamy V. Anderson B. Denis C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7541-7548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Similarly, only the smaller human Mediator complex, lacking hSrb8, -9, -10, and -11, supports positive transcription control in vitro, whereas the larger human complex that includes these four proteins is inactive (17Sun X. Zhang Y. Cho H. Rickert P. Lees E. Lane W. Reinberg D. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 213-222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 35Taatjes D.J. Naar A.M. Andel III, F. Nogales E. Tjian R. Science. 2002; 295: 1058-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Finally, the Drosophila genes blind spot andkohtalo encode homologs of TRAP230/Srb8 and TRAP240/Srb9, and mutations in these genes interfere with identical processes in eye-antennal disc development (36Treisman J. Development. 2001; 128: 603-615PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that TRAP230 and TRAP240 interact in vivo. A large body of evidence therefore points to a complex of TRAP230/Srb8, TRAP240/Srb9, Cdk8/Srb10, and cyclin C/Srb11 that is involved in transcriptional repression in the entire range of eukaryotes from yeast to humans. Under the stringent conditions of isolation employed here, only the heat shock protein Ssa1 copurified with the Srb8/9/10/11 complex. The presence of Ssa1 could nonetheless be interpreted as an artifact, because the level of Ssa1 was significantly less than that of the Srb proteins, and further because Ssa1 is a frequent contaminant of other protein preparations. Under less stringent conditions (no ammonium sulfate precipitation), Srb8/9/10/11 was found in a larger complex with Mediator and RNA polymerase II (data not shown). These data are in agreement with two different forms of Mediator found in nuclear extracts (37Liu Y. Ranish J.A. Aebersold R. Hahn S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7169-7175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Quantitation of Srb8, -9, -10, and -11 indicated that they are present at one third the level of other Mediator proteins in yeast (data not shown); therefore, the Srb8/9/10/11 complex can be associated with some but not all Mediator complexes in yeast, a further point of similarity to the human system. It has been suggested that transcriptional repression by Srb10/11 is the result of premature phosphorylation of the CTD (13Hengartner C.J. Myer V.E. Liao S.M. Wilson C.J. Koh S.S. Young R.A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 43-53Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar), preventing the entry of RNA polymerase II in transcription initiation complexes. Our finding that the Srb8/9/10/11 complex phosphorylates the CTD at Ser-2, normally associated with elongation rather than initiation, might be viewed as supportive of this idea. On the other hand, we find that the Srb8/9/10/11 complex phosphorylates the CTD at only a limited number of sites, and with low site specificity. The possibility therefore arises that the physiologically relevant target is not the CTD but rather another transcriptional regulatory protein. Indeed, it has been reported that the yeast transcriptional activators Gcn4 and Msn2 are negatively regulated by Srb10/11 phosphorylation (38Chi Y. Huddleston M.J. Zhang X. Young R.A. Annan R.S. Carr S.A. Deshaies R.J. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1078-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), and mammalian Cdk8/cyclin C can phosphorylate the cyclin H subunit of TFIIH (33Akoulitchev S. Chuikov S. Reinberg D. Nature. 2000; 407: 102-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Further clarification of the mechanism of transcriptional repression by the Srb8/9/10/11 complex awaits the development of a fully reconstituted cell-free transcription system. Addendum While this manuscript was under review, more evidence for the extensive conservation of Mediator was published (Boube, M., Joulia, L., Cribbs, D. L., and Bourbon, H. M. (2002) Cell 110, 143–151). This work is in agreement with our data that TRAP230 and TRAP240 are the human homologs of yeast Srb8 and Srb9, respectively. We are indebted to Dr. L. Guethlein for help with the manual alignment in Fig. 4 B and Dr. D. Bushnell for help with the figures. We thank Dr. M. Carlson for pSK90, Dr. S. Hahn for anti-Srb10 antibodies, Dr. J. L.

We constructed mutant strains in which the levels of Hsp60 protein, compared with wild-type cells, were four times greater, and the addition of doxycycline gradually reduces them to 20% of wild-type. Under oxidative-stress conditions, the progressive decrease in Hsp60 levels in these mutants resulted in reduced cell viability and an increase in both cell peroxide species and protein carbonyl content. Protection of Fe/S-containing enzymes from oxidative inactivation was found to be dose-dependent with respect to Hsp60 levels. As these enzymes release their iron ions under oxidative-stress conditions, the intracellular labile iron pool, monitored with calcein, was higher in cells with reduced Hsp60 levels. Consistently, the iron chelator deferoxamine protected low Hsp60-expressing cells from both oxidant-induced death and protein oxidation. These results indicate that the role of Hsp60 in oxidative-stress defense is explained by protection of several Fe/S proteins, which prevent the release of iron ions and thereby avert further damage.

These results indicate that the role of Hsp60 in oxidative-stress defense is explained by protection of several Fe/S proteins, which prevent the release of iron ions and thereby avert further damage. Heat shock proteins (Hsps) 1The abbreviations used are: Hsp, heat shock protein; DFO, deferoxamine; SDS-PAGE, SDS-polyacrilamide gel electrophoresis; LIP, labile iron pool; YPD, yeast extract-peptone-dextrose medium; YPG, yeast extract-peptone-glycerol medium; ROS, reactive oxygen species are a family of proteins that act both under normal (where Hsps account for 5–10% of the total protein) and stress conditions (where they are overexpressed). Stress situations include heat shock, glucose deprivation, exposure to free radicals, infection by pathogens, and tissue injuries (1Parsell D.A. Lindquist S. Morimoto R.I. Tissieres A. Georgeopoulus C. The Biology of Heat Shock Proteins and Molecular Chaperones. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994: 457-494Google Scholar, 2Lindquist S. Craig E.A. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1988; 22: 631-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (4437) Google Scholar). A common aspect of these stress-inducing conditions is that they give rise to proteins with non-native conformations. All known stresses, when sufficiently intense, induce Hsp expression. Hsps are therefore also referred to as stress proteins and constitute an important part of the stress response. Hsps are highly conserved among species and carry out such essential functions as protein translocation, folding, and assembly under normal cellular conditions (3, 4Hendrick J.P. Hartl F.U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 349-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1477) Google Scholar). As a result, they have also been called “molecular chaperones.” Many members of the HSP60 family are constitutively expressed and are found in abundance in prokaryotes, chloroplast, and mitochondria. Hsp60 is an essential mitochondrial chaperone and promotes the folding of many proteins imported into the mitochondrial matrix. It also directs several proteins to the intermembrane space (5Reading D.S. Hallberg R.L. Myers A.M. Nature. 1989; 337: 655-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 6Cheng M.Y. Hart F. Martin J. Pollock R. Neupert W. Hallberg E.M. Halberg R.L. Horwich A.L. Nature. 1989; 337: 620-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar, 7Hallberg E.M. Shu Y. Hallberg R.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3050-3057Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). It is generally assumed that mitochondrial Hsp60 works according to a similar mechanism to its prokaryotic homologue, GroEL. GroEL is composed of 14 monomers arranged as a double ring, with a 7-mer in each. In its central cavity, substrate proteins can be transiently sequestered from the medium and allowed to mature in solitary confinement. The 10-kDa co-chaperonin (Hsp10 or GroES in bacteria) exists as a 7-mer ring-shaped oligomer. Newly imported proteins are released by an ATP-dependent reaction regulated by the co-chaperone Hsp10 (8Martin J. Mayhew M. Langer T. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1993; 366: 228-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 9Dubaquié Y. Looser R. Rospert S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9011-9016Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In short, unfolded proteins can be bound inside the central cavity of the large Hsp60. ATP binding and hydrolysis induces a large conformational shift, which changes the properties of the binding sites and opens the cavity. The substrate is eventually released in the folded conformation, possibly after several cycles of binding and release (10Sigler P.B., Xu, Z. Rye H.S. Burston S.G. Fenton W.A. Horwich A.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 581-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Hsp60 is essential for viability at all temperatures (this is consistent with its constitutive expression), and its concentration in the mitochondrial matrix is also increased 2- to 3-fold at 42 °C (6Cheng M.Y. Hart F. Martin J. Pollock R. Neupert W. Hallberg E.M. Halberg R.L. Horwich A.L. Nature. 1989; 337: 620-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). Such induction reflects an increased requirement for this chaperonin to protect preexisting proteins from denaturation and aggregation. Davidson et al. (11Davidson J.F. Whyte B. Bissinger P.H. Schiestl R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5116-5121Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 12Davidson J.F. Schiestl R.H. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 4580-4587Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) demonstrated that in yeast, anaerobic cells are several orders of magnitude more resistant to heat shock than aerobic cells. Aerobic heat stress also led to an increase in mitochondrial membrane damage, which was reduced 100-fold under anaerobic conditions. The authors showed that heat stress generates oxidative stress, supporting the idea that antioxidant enzymes play a major role in protection against heat-induced cell death in yeast. Mutants deleted for the antioxidant genes catalase, superoxide dismutase, and cytochrome c peroxidase were more sensitive to the lethal effect of heat shock than isogenic wild-type cells. Overexpression of catalase and superoxide dismutase genes caused an increase in thermotolerance (11Davidson J.F. Whyte B. Bissinger P.H. Schiestl R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5116-5121Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). A common signal has been proposed for heat stress and oxidative stress in cell culture, suggesting that exposure of the hydrophobic domains of proteins represents the most common early signal in the activation pathway of the heat shock factor (13Gosslau A. Ruoff P. Mohsenzadeh S. Hobohm U. Rensing L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1814-1821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Yeast can adapt to H2O2 and superoxide-generating drugs by inducing two distinct but overlapping stimulons (14Collison L.P. Dawes I.W. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1992; 138: 329-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 15Jamieson D.J. Rivers S.L. Stephen D.W.S. Microbiology. 1994; 140: 3277-3283Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The H2O2 stimulon includes the induction of many Hsps, with Hsp104 and Hsp12 being those most highly induced (14- and 10-fold, respectively) (16Godon C. Lagniel G. Lee J. Buhler J.M. Kieffer S. Perrot M. Boucherie H. Toledano M.B. Labarre J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22480-22489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). Some other Hsps have been directly related with conferring resistance against oxidative stress (1Parsell D.A. Lindquist S. Morimoto R.I. Tissieres A. Georgeopoulus C. The Biology of Heat Shock Proteins and Molecular Chaperones. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994: 457-494Google Scholar). These include the cytoplasmic Hsp70, which is highly inducible (17Jaattela M. Wissing D. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), and the newly described chaperone Hsp33 which plays an important role in the bacterial system toward oxidative stress. To date, Hsp33 is the only chaperone whose function is regulated by environmental redox conditions, and it is directly activated by disulfide bonds formation (18Jakob U. Muse W. Eser M. Bardwell J.C. Cell. 1999; 96: 341-352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). The non-ATP- dependent Hsps (such as Hsp33) have been referred to as “holdases,” in contrast to the ATP-dependent “foldases” (such as Hsp60 and Hsp70) (19Bohen S.P. Kralli A. Yamamoto K.R. Science. 1995; 268: 1303-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Holdases bind stably to folding intermediates and suppress lethal aggregation, and they also interact with foldases, allowing the efficient release of intermediates and their successful refolding to their native state when conditions return to normal. However, with the exception of Escherichia coli Hsp33, which has been shown to protect oxidatively damaged proteins from irreversible aggregation (18Jakob U. Muse W. Eser M. Bardwell J.C. Cell. 1999; 96: 341-352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar), very little is known about the mechanisms by which Hsps protect against oxidative stress. It is interesting to note that in previous work, we identified mitochondrial Hsp60 in yeast (20Cabiscol E. Piulats E. Echave P. Herrero E. Ros J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27393-27398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and DnaK (the bacterial Hsp70) inE. coli (21Tamarit J. Cabiscol E. Ros J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3027-3032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) as major oxidized proteins under oxidative stress. Although members of different Hsp families, this parallelism led us to study their physiological relevance both in E. coli and S. cerevisiae upon oxidative stress. Our group has also recently published a report on the protective role of DnaK of alcohol dehydrogenase E from oxidative damage (22Echave P. Esparza-Cerón M.A. Cabiscol E. Tamarit J. Ros J. Membrillo-Hernández J. Lin E.C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4626-4631Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In the present study, the expression of the HSP60 gene under atet promoter allowed us to demonstrate the importance of Hsp60 in protecting yeast cells against oxidative stress. We also propose a possible mechanism to explain this protection linking Hsp60, Fe/S cluster enzymes, mitochondrial iron homeostasis, and oxidative damage. Hydrogen peroxide (30% solution), doxycycline, bathophenanthroline sulfonate, menadione sodium bisulfite, 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine, mesylate derivative of deferoxamine (DFO), and dihydrorhodamine 123 were purchased from Sigma. Calcein-acetoxymethyl ester was from Molecular Probes. Acrylamide/bisacrilamide solution was supplied by Bio-Rad. Polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were from Millipore. The chemiluminescent detection kit was provided by Tropix. S. cerevisiae CML128 (MAT a, ura3-52, his4,leu2-3,112, trp1) was used as wild-type strain (23Gallego C. Garı́ E. Colomina N. Herrero E. Aldea M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7196-7206Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Overexpression of Hsp60 protein was obtained after integration ofBstEII-linearized pMM132 plasmid at the chromosomalLEU2 locus of CML128 cells. pMM132 is an integrative plasmid containing HSP60 under the doxycycline-regulatedtetO7 promoter and was derived from pCM190 (24Gari E. Piedrafita L. Aldea M. Herrero E. Yeast. 1997; 13: 837-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). The strain carrying the integrated pMM132 plasmid was labeled MML332 and also contained the wild-type HSP60 allele at its original chromosomal locus. Addition of the antibiotic repressed expression of the tet construction without affecting the wild-type gene, resulting in wild-type levels of Hsp60 expression. A conditional mutant in which HSP60 expression was exclusively doxycycline-regulated was further obtained from the MML332 strain by deletion of the wild-type HSP60 allele using thekanMX4 cassette (25Wach A Brachat A Pohlmann R. Philippsen P. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1793-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (2241) Google Scholar). The resulting strain, labeled MML336, was able to grow on glycerol in the absence of doxycycline (HSP60 expressed), but growth was finally arrested upon addition of the antibiotic (HSP60 transcription immediately repressed), confirming the need for Hsp60. Yeast cells were grown aerobically at 30 °C in YPD medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose) or in YPG medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 3% glycerol). Cells from CML128, MML332, and MML336 strains, growing exponentially under either fermenting (YPD) or respiring conditions (YPG), were diluted toA 600 = 0.002 and A 600 = 0.0009, respectively, in order to obtain cells with different Hsp60 levels. Doxycycline was added to 0, 2, and 4 μg/ml concentration, and growth was allowed for 12 h in YPD medium and 25 h in YPG medium, until approximately reaching to A600 = 0.5. Cells obtained as indicated in the previous paragraph (about 107 cells per ml) were challenged with hydrogen peroxide or menadione. These were directly added to the growth media under the conditions indicated for each experiment. Untreated cultures were incubated in parallel over the same periods. When indicated, the iron chelator DFO was added at 10 mm concentration 1 h prior to the stress. Viability was determined by colony counts on YPD plates after 3 days of incubation at 30 °C and was expressed as the percentage of the corresponding control cultures. Cell extracts were prepared as described (26Rodriguez-Manzaneque M.T. Ros J. Cabiscol E. Sorribas A. Herrero E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8180-8190Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method. For Western blot experiments with anti-DNP, protein carbonyl groups were derivatized with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine as published (27Levine R.L. Williams J.A. Statdman E.R. Shacter E. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 346-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (2283) Google Scholar) with minor variations. Crude extracts were clarified by treatment with 50% volume of chloroform, vortexed at maximum speed for 1 min, and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The upper buffer solution was then recovered. Protein concentration was adjusted to 4 mg/ml, SDS was added to the samples to a final concentration of 6%, and they were subsequently heated at 100 °C for 3 min. One volume of 10 mm 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine in 10% trifluoroacetic acid was added to 1 volume of the sample at 25 °C. The reaction was run for 10 min and was stopped by the addition of 1 volume of 2 m Tris, 10% glycerol, and 15% 2-mercaptoethanol. Samples were ready for loading on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). SDS-PAGE was performed according to Laemmli (28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207521) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibody anti-Hsp60 was purchased from Stress-Gen and used at 1:8,000 dilution. It was applied in conjunction with a rabbit anti-mouse conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (1:25,000 dilution, from Tropix) as a secondary antibody. Polyclonal anti-Aco1 aconitase (1:2,000 dilution, a kind gift of R. Lill, Marburg University) and anti-succinate dehydrogenase (1:1,000 dilution, from B. Lemire, University of Alberta) antibodies were also employed. Rabbit anti-dehydrolipoamide succinyltransferase (E2 subunit of α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase) antibodies were obtained after injection of a KLH-conjugated peptide (193KKEAAPKKEVTEPKKC208, from Fundacio Bosch i Gimpera, University of Barcelona) and applied at a dilution of 1:2,500. The anti-2, 4-dinitrophenol antibody (from DAKO) was used at a dilution of 1:4,000. A goat anti-rabbit antibody conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (1:25,000 dilution, from Tropix) was used as a secondary antibody. The oxidant-sensitive probe dihydrorhodamine 123 (Sigma D1054) was used to measure intracellular oxidation levels in yeast, as described in Madeoet al. (29Madeo F. Fröhlich E. Ligr M. Grey M. Sigrist S.J. Wolf D.H. Fröhlich K.U. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 757-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar). Dihydrorhodamine 123 is an uncharged, nonfluorescent product that passively diffuses across most cell membranes where it is oxidized to rhodamine 123, and locates in the mitochondria. Dihydrorhodamine was added to the cell culture at 2.5 μg/ml from a 2.5 mg/ml stock solution in ethanol, and cells were incubated for 1 h. Hydrogen peroxide (8 mm) was added as indicated, and an additional incubation of 1 h was performed. Cells were washed, resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (10 mm phosphate buffer, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.0), and viewed through a fluorescein optical filter (excitation, 465–495 nm; emission, 505), using a Nikon fluorescence microscope. Images were taken using a Sony camera system. Fluorescence intensity was measured within 15–30 min, from cells treated as described above, using a Shimadzu RF 5000 spectrofluorimeter (excitation, 490 nm; emission, 530 nm). The emission values were normalized by number of cells. Cell extracts were obtained using glass beads, and enzymatic activities were assayed as described in the respective references: malate dehydrogenase (30Robinson Jr., J.B. Brent L.G. Sumegi B. Srerre P.A. Darley-Usmar V.M. Rickwood D. Wilson M.T. Mitochondria: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford, U.K.1987: 153-179Google Scholar), succinate dehydrogenase (31Munujos P. Coll-Canti J. Gonzalez-Sastre F. Gella F.J. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 212: 506-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), and aconitase (32Fansler B. Lowenstein J.M. Methods Enzymol. 1969; 13: 26-30Crossref Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Activities were expressed as nmol·min−1·mg−1. The intracellular labile iron pool (LIP) was measured using calcein, a fluorescent metal-sensitive probe (33Breuer W. Epsztejn S. Cabantchik Z.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24209-24215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). In cell-free systems, calcein binds to both iron (II) and iron (III) with stability constants of 1014and 1024 M−1, respectively, which results in quenching its fluorescence (34Breuer W. Epsztejn S. Millgram P. Cabantchik Z.I. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After cellular uptake of calcein-acetoxymethyl ester, intracellular esterases convert the molecule into a nonpermeable acid-form of calcein. Because calcein is insensitive to calcium and magnesium ions up to 1 mm at physiological pH and because intracellular concentration of other calcein-binding molecules is very low, it is generally accepted that the observed decrease in calcein fluorescence is due to iron binding. Calcein-acetoxymethyl ester loading of S. cerevisiae cells was performed on exponential phase cell cultures untreated or treated in the presence of 8 mm for 1 h. Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in the same buffer at 107 cells/ml. Cells were loaded with calcein-acetoxymethyl ester at a final concentration of 5 μm (from a 10 mm stock solution in dimethyl sulfoxide). After a 2-h incubation at 30 °C, cells were washed twice to remove unincorporated dye, resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline, and viewed through a fluorescein optical filter (excitation, 465–495 nm; emission, 505 nm) using a Nikon fluorescence microscope. Images were taken as described previously. Fluorescence intensity was measured within 30 min, from cells treated as described above, using a Shimadzu RF 5000 spectrofluorimeter (excitation, 485 nm; emission, 525 nm). The emission value was normalized by the number of cells. Total cellular iron was determined under reducing conditions (35Fish W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 158: 357-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar), with bathophenanthroline sulfonate as chelator. In summary, 2 × 108 exponentially grown cells were washed twice in MilliQ water, resuspended in 500 μl of 3% nitric acid, and digested for 12 h at 98 °C. After removal of the precipitated material by centrifugation, 400 μl of supernatant was taken up and Fe3+ was reduced to Fe2+ with ascorbic acid (final concentration, 6 mg/ml). Ammonium acetate was added to obtain a final pH of 5.4. The difference between 535 nm and 680 nm absorbance was recorded before and after addition of bathophenanthroline sulfonate (final concentration, 34 μg/ml). Cell numbers and mean cell volumes were determined using a Coulter Z2 counter (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA). A blank sample containing all of the components except the cells was treated in parallel to measure nonspecific absorbance. Molar iron concentration was obtained from a standard curve prepared with ferrous ammonium sulfate. Given the defective growth phenotype of HSP60 null mutants, we constructed two conditional strain mutants in which the HSP60 gene under thetet promoter was doxycycline regulable (see Experimental Procedures). It is possible to obtain cells with different amounts of Hsp60 protein from these strains, by adjusting time and doxycycline concentration. To quantify these levels, crude extracts were obtained from CML128 (wild-type), MML332, and MML336 cells grown in YPD or YPG with different doxycycline concentrations. YPD-grown (Fig.1 A) and YPG-grown (Fig.1 B) cells showed repression of HSP60 gene expression by the antibiotic; similar results were recorded for both culture media. Control cells (no added doxycycline) displayed a 3.5- to 4-fold increase in Hsp60 expression in strain MML332 and a 2.5- to 3-fold increase in strain MML336 with respect to CML128 cells. Addition of 4 μg/ml doxycycline to the MML332 strain reduced the amount of Hsp60 to that of the wild-type. When the same dose was added to the MML336 strain, Hsp60 levels were reduced to 15–20% of those found in the wild-type. Neither Hsp60 overexpression nor underexpression affected growth in YPD at the indicated times and antibiotic concentrations: all cells showed similar growth curves (data not shown). However, Hsp60 overexpression did slightly increase duplication time for cells grown in YPG. In this medium, cells from strain MML332 duplicated in 260 min, but in only 240 min when doxycycline was added at 4 μg/ml (data not shown). Hsp60 underexpression, even at levels of around 20% did not affect viability in any media. All cells remained viable under these conditions (data not shown). It is well known that the absence of Hsp60 causes imported proteins to fold incorrectly and to aggregate into insoluble complexes (36Martin J. Horwich A.L. Hartl F.U. Science. 1992; 258: 995-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). We wanted to determine whether the mitochondria were still functioning properly under our conditions. Western blot detection of two enzymes reported to need Hsp60 for proper folding, α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (7Hallberg E.M. Shu Y. Hallberg R.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3050-3057Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and aconitase (37Dubaquié Y. Looser R. Fünfschilling U. Jenö P. Rospert S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5868-5876Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), showed no differences (Fig. 1,C and D). This indicated that even at below normal levels, no insoluble aggregates were produced and no degradation of these proteins took place. Strain MML336 arrested growth after about 18–22 h in YPD and 29–34 h in YPG, following the addition of 4 μg/ml doxycycline. However, even at this point, cells were still able to almost completely recover growth once doxycycline was removed from the medium (data not shown). The effect of Hsp60 in protection against heat stress was first described 10 years ago (36Martin J. Horwich A.L. Hartl F.U. Science. 1992; 258: 995-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), but much less is known about its effects upon oxidative stress. We used our doxycycline-regulable strains growing in YPG as a model system to investigate how varying the quantity of this chaperonin may affect viability against menadione (a superoxide-generator compound) and H2O2. As shown in TableI, greater viability was obtained from cells with higher levels of Hsp60, and resistance was dose-dependent. Differences were especially clear following menadione treatment. As a control, adding the antibiotic to wild-type strain (CML128) at the maximum concentration used (4 μg/ml) did not affect resistance to oxidative stress (data not shown).Table IEffect of Hsp60 levels on survival under oxidative stressStrainDoxycycline (μg/ml)SurvivalMenadioneMenadione + DFOH2O2H2O2 + DFOMML332013184243MML33240.261635MML336018234755MML33629202340MML33640.571023Cells grown in YPG were treated with doxycycline at the indicated concentrations for 25 h and challenged with 50 mmmenadione (60 min) or 10 mm H2O2 (120 min). DFO (10 mm) was added to the cultures 60 min before menadione or hydrogen peroxide. Cell viability is expressed as the percentage of the corresponding control cultures with an S.D. less than 15%. Open table in a new tab Cells grown in YPG were treated with doxycycline at the indicated concentrations for 25 h and challenged with 50 mmmenadione (60 min) or 10 mm H2O2 (120 min). DFO (10 mm) was added to the cultures 60 min before menadione or hydrogen peroxide. Cell viability is expressed as the percentage of the corresponding control cultures with an S.D. less than 15%. During the stationary phase, a general stress response is required to reduce steady-state levels of damaged cell components that cannot be diluted out through cell division (38Werner-Washburne M. Braun E.L. Crawford M.E. Peck V.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 1159-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). To investigate whether increasing concentrations of Hsp60 have a protective effect on the stationary phase, cells from strains MML332 and MML336 were grown in YPD medium for 10 days and then treated with 50 mmH2O2 for 2 h. Our results showed that whereas in strain MML332 5% of the cells remained viable, in strain MML336 only 0.5% remained viable. Carbonyl formation has been extensively used as a marker for protein oxidation (20Cabiscol E. Piulats E. Echave P. Herrero E. Ros J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27393-27398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Tamarit J. Cabiscol E. Ros J. J. Biol.

We used this methodology to analyze the effect of challenging YPG-grown cells (from MML332 and MML336 strains treated with different concentrations of doxycycline) with 10 mm menadione or 8 mmH2O2 for 1 h. Western-blot anti-DNP revealed an increased level of protein damage in cells with lower Hsp60 levels (Fig. 2 A). When menadione was used it was observed that two major proteins became targets for oxidative damage. As described in Cabiscol et al. (20Cabiscol E. Piulats E. Echave P. Herrero E. Ros J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27393-27398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) these were the mitochondrial enzymes dehydrolipoamide acetyltransferase (E2 subunit of pyruvate dehydrogenase) and dehydrolipoamide succinyltransferase (E2 subunit of α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase). Hsp60 appeared as a major oxidized band under H2O2stress. It is worth noting the strong oxidation of Hsp60 observed in the western pattern when its concentration declined (Fig 2 A, strain MML336 with 2 μg/ml doxycycline treated with H2O2). Similar results were obtained when cultures were grown in YPD medium (Fig. 2 C). The presence of the antibiotic, added to wild-type cells (CML128 strain), at the maximum concentration used, did not modify the oxidative pattern of damaged proteins under oxidative stress (data not shown). To further investigate the role of Hsp60 under oxidative stress situations, we tested levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by incubating the cells with dihydrorhodamine 123. This fluorescent probe has been extensively used to investigate oxidative bursts, as it reacts with H2O2 and other reactive oxygen intermediates (29Madeo F. Fröhlich E. Ligr M. Grey M. Sigrist S.J.

The purpose of the current study was to identify intracellular signaling mechanisms that mediate hypoxia-induced apoptosis and are regulated by glucose metabolism. Hypoxia-induced apoptosis in vascular smooth muscle cells and COS-7 cells was accompanied by a significant reduction in Akt and glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) phosphorylation resulting in increased GSK-3 activity. Morphologic features of apoptosis, as well as caspases 3 and 9 activation, were prevented by GSK-3 inhibition with either LiCl or SB216763. Phosphorylation of Akt and GSK-3 was enhanced by glucose metabolism or overexpression of the glucose transporter, GLUT1, and was prevented by glycolytic inhibition. These findings indicate that GSK-3 is an important mediator of hypoxia-induced apoptosis and that GSK-3-mediated apoptotic effects occur via activation of the mitochondrial death pathway. Moreover, the results suggest that prevention of hypoxia-mediated apoptosis by enhanced glucose transport and metabolism results, in part, from inhibition of GSK-3 activation.

In most cells, it appears that this type of programmed cell death takes place via activation of the mitochondrial death pathway, the so-called intrinsic pathway (1Strasser A. O'Connor L. Dixit V.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 217-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (1372) Google Scholar). For example, UV irradiation, growth factor withdrawal, hypoxia, and reactive oxygen species trigger release of cytochrome c and other mitochondrial factors into the cytoplasm, which then associate with and activate the complex of apaf1 and procaspase 9. Activated caspase 9 in turn cleaves and activates downstream caspases leading to apoptosis. We and others (2Malhotra R. Brosius III, F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12567-12575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 3Lin Z. Weinberg J.M. Malhotra R. Merritt S. Holzman L.B. Brosius III, F.C. Am. J.

Physiol. 2001; 281: C1596-C1603Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that hypoxia as well as hypoxia followed by reoxygenation can trigger cytochrome c release and apoptosis. Although release of cytochrome c and other proapoptotic factors could be due to generalized disruption of mitochondrial function and mitochondrial depolarization during hypoxia, our studies suggest that cytochromec release is regulated specifically and occurs before mitochondrial failure (4Malhotra R. Lin Z. Vincenz C. Brosius III, F.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: C1596-C1603Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Ekhterae D. Lin Z. Lundberg M.S. Crow M.T. Brosius III, F.C. Nunez G. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 70-77Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the specific upstream signaling mechanisms by which hypoxia causes cytochrome c release remain unidentified. Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3)1 has been shown to participate in apoptosis in several cell types and is known to be an upstream regulator of programmed cell death (6Bijur G.N. Jope R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37436-37442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). GSK-3 is a serine-threonine kinase ubiquitously expressed in most cell types. Two isoforms of GSK-3 have been identified, and these have a high degree of amino acid homology (7Woodgett J.R. Science's STKE. 2001; (http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/OC_sigtrans;2001/100/re12)PubMed Google Scholar, 8Cohen P. Frame S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 769-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar). The two isoforms appear to function in a similar manner in most cell systems, however, the β isoform appears to be the predominant isoform in adult cells. GSK-3 has been demonstrated to induce caspase 3 activation and activate the proapoptotic tumor suppressor gene, p53 (9Turenne G.A. Price B.D. BMC Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 1471-2121Crossref Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 10King T.D. Bijur G.N. Jope R.S. Brain Res. 2001; 919: 106-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). It also has been suggested that GSK-3 promotes activation and translocation of the proapoptotic Bcl-2 family member, Bax (11Somervaille T.C. Linch D.C. Khwaja A. Blood. 2001; 98: 1374-1381Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 12Yamaguchi H. Wang H.G. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 7779-7786Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar), which, upon aggregation and mitochondrial localization, induces cytochrome crelease. Phosphorylation at serine 21/9 (α/β isoforms, respectively) of GSK-3 inhibits its activity and reduces apoptosis (13Li M. Wang X. Meintzer M.K. Laessig T. Birnbaum M.J. Heidenreich K.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; : 9356-9363Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Akt is one of the critical regulators of GSK-3, and phosphorylation and inactivation of GSK-3 may mediate some of the antiapoptotic effects of Akt. Enhanced glucose transport and metabolism are known to prevent hypoxia-induced apoptosis in a variety of cell types, including cardiac myocytes and vascular smooth muscle cells, through their effects on the mitochondrial pathway. Glucose uptake and glycolysis as well as overexpression of the facilitative glucose transporter, GLUT1, have been shown to inhibit cytochrome c release and downstream caspase activation during hypoxia (2Malhotra R. Brosius III, F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12567-12575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 3Lin Z. Weinberg J.M. Malhotra R. Merritt S. Holzman L.B. Brosius III, F.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: E958-E966Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similar studies have suggested that glucose metabolism is critical for the prevention of apoptosis due to other causes, such as growth factor withdrawal. For example, Thompson's laboratory (14Rathmell J.C. Vander Heiden M.G. Harris M.H. Frauwirth K.A. Thompson C.B. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 683-692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar) has found that withdrawal of lymphocyte growth and survival factors leads to cellular atrophy and apoptosis accompanied by reduction in GLUT1 expression, glucose uptake, ATP levels, and mitochondrial potential. In this system, apoptosis could be accelerated by glucose depletion (14Rathmell J.C. Vander Heiden M.G. Harris M.H. Frauwirth K.A. Thompson C.B. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 683-692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar) and could be prevented via Akt-stimulated increases in glucose uptake, GLUT1 expression and glucose metabolism (15Plas D.R. Talapatra S. Edinger A.L. Rathmell J.C. Thompson C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12041-12048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Finally, Hall et al. (16Hall J.L. Chatham J.C. Eldar-Finkelman H. Gibbons G.H. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 1171-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) demonstrated that GSK3β-induced apoptosis could be attenuated by GLUT1 overexpression in cultured vascular smooth muscle cells. For the current studies, we hypothesized that hypoxia induces apoptosis through down-regulation of the PI3K/Akt pathway releasing the inhibition of GSK-3 and promoting apoptosis via a mitochondrial pathway. We further hypothesized that glucose prevents apoptosis through mechanisms involving the inhibition of GSK-3 and promotion of Akt activity. The results presented here demonstrate that activation of GSK-3β mediates hypoxia-induced apoptosis and that the protective effect of glucose attenuates the activation of GSK-3β and promotes phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase (PI3K)/Akt-mediated cell survival. Polyclonal antibodies for phospho AktSer-473, phospho GSK-3α/βSer-9/21, and total Akt were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). The antibody for total GSK-3α/β, phosphoglycogen synthase peptide-2 substrate and caspase 9 activity substrate were from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). The antibody for GLUT1 was a gift from Dr. Christin Carter-Su (University of Michigan). SB216763 was obtained from GlaxoSmithKline (Research Triangle Park, NC). LY294002 and caspase 3 activity substrate were obtained from Calbiochem. Oxyrase was purchased from Oxyrase, Inc. (Ashland, OH). All other reagents were from Sigma. A7r5 cells (ATCC CRL-1444) or COS-7 cells were grown in 60-mm Falcon culture dishes (Fisher Scientific) to 80% confluence. Cells were washed twice with serum- and glucose-free media and placed in serum-free medium with or without glucose (5 mm). Cells were subjected to hypoxia in a Plexiglas chamber superfused with 95% N2, 5% CO2 at 37 °C as reported previously (2Malhotra R. Brosius III, F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12567-12575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 3Lin Z. Weinberg J.M. Malhotra R. Merritt S. Holzman L.B. Brosius III, F.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: E958-E966Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Oxyrase (6% v/v), a mixture of bacterial monooxygenases and dioxygenases, was added to the media of hypoxia samples to reduce the oxygen tension to <5 mm Hg. Normoxic samples were placed in serum-free medium in a conventional incubator with 95% air, 5% CO2 at 37 °C for equivalent periods of time. After hypoxia, cells were placed on ice and rinsed twice with ice-cold PBS. Cell lysis buffer (Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 (10 mm), NaCl (150 mm), Triton X-100 (1%), sodium dodecyl sulfate (0.1%), sodium orthovanadate (1 mm), sodium fluoride (50 mm), phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (1 mm), leupeptin (10 μg/ml), aprotonin (10 μg/ml), pepstatin A (10 μg/ml), okadaic acid (1 μm)) was added to each dish, and whole cell lysates were collected by cell scraping. Lysates were incubated on ice for 15 min followed by sonication for 5 s at 40% duty cycle (Sonicator Vibracell, Sonics and Materials) and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C to clear cellular debris. Protein concentrations were determined using a BCA Protein Assay Kit (Pierce). Whole cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membranes were blocked with TBS-Tween 20 and 5% milk for 1 h and placed in primary antibody in TBS-T, 5% milk overnight at 4 °C. After three 10-min washes in TBS-T, the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibody was then added in TBS-T, 5% milk and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. Membranes were then washed three times (10 min each) in TBS-T, subjected to enhanced chemiluminescence reaction, and exposed to autoradiography. A7r5 cells were collected by cell scraping into an activity buffer comprising HEPES, pH 7.5 (50 mm), EGTA (1 mm), EDTA (1 mm) β-glycerophosphate (10 mm), sodium pyrophosphate (5 mm), potassium chloride (100 mm), Triton X-100 (0.5%), benzamidine (1 mm), phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (0.1 mm), aprotonin (10 μg/ml), vanadate (0.5 mm), and dithiothreitol (1 mm). Whole cell homogenates were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were transferred to fresh microcentrifuge tubes. Protein concentrations were determined by BCA protein assay (Pierce), and 10-μg samples were added to 5 μl of 5× reaction buffer (HEPES (250 mm), MgCl2 (50 mm), and 2.5 mg/ml phosphoglycogen synthase peptide-2 substrate (Upstate Biotechnology) and preincubated for 2 min at 30 °C. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 250 μm ATP and 2 μCi/10 μl of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences) and was incubated at 30 °C for 15 min. The addition of 200 mm EDTA + 5 mm ATP terminated the reaction, and samples were transferred to Whatman P81 filter paper and washed three times in 100 mm phosphoric acid followed by a final rinse in 95% ETOH. Filter paper was allowed to air dry, and radioactivity was assessed by scintillation counting. Morphologic analysis of VSMC and COS-7 cell apoptosis was performed using propidium iodide staining. Apoptotic cells were identified based on nuclear condensation and/or fragmentation as reported previously (3Lin Z. Weinberg J.M. Malhotra R. Merritt S. Holzman L.B. Brosius III, F.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: E958-E966Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Malhotra R. Lin Z. Vincenz C. Brosius III, F.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: C1596-C1603Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Ekhterae D. Lin Z. Lundberg M.S. Crow M.T. Brosius III, F.C. Nunez G. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 70-77Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown in 60-mm culture dishes and subjected to hypoxia (6 h) in the presence of specified chemical agents. After hypoxic treatment, cells were washed with PBS, permeabilized with 30% methanol in PBS (v/v), and stained with propidium iodide (100 nm) in PBS. Apoptotic and nonapoptotic cells were counted in multiple randomly selected fields, and data were presented as percent apoptotic cells. Caspases 3 and 9 activities were assessed via a colorimetric assay utilizing specific substrates. After treatment, the cells were washed once with ice-cold PBS and collected by trypsinization followed by centrifugation. The cellular pellet was resuspended in cell lysis buffer and incubated on ice for 10 min. Lysates were centrifuged for 5 min at 13,000 rpm, and the supernatants were transferred to microcentrifuge tubes containing caspase activity assay buffer (HEPES, pH 7.4 (50 mm), NaCl (100 mm), CHAPS (0.1%), dithiothreitol (10 mm), EDTA (0.1 mm), glycerol (10%)). Dithiothreitol (10 mm) was added immediately prior to using the assay buffer. Caspase substrate (2 mm) was added to each sample and incubated for 60 min at 37 °C. Samples were read at 405 nm in an EL-312e Bio-Kinetics microplate reader from Bio-Tek Instruments. Data were expressed as mean ± S.E. unless otherwise indicated in the figure legends. Analysis of variance followed by Bonferroni's post-hoc analysis was used, and differences were regarded as statistically significant at ap value of <0.05. To confirm that hypoxia causes apoptosis in COS-7 cells, we subjected these cells to 6 h of hypoxia without reoxygenation. Typical morphological features of apoptosis were found in 13.0 ± 1.1% of hypoxic COS-7 cells as compared with 1.65 ± 0.2% of normoxic cells (p < 0.01). Moreover, hypoxia was found to induce caspases 3 and 9 activities in these cells (see Fig. 3, Band D, respectively). These findings are similar to those reported previously in vascular smooth muscle cells and cardiac myocytes exposed to hypoxia (2Malhotra R. Brosius III, F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12567-12575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 3Lin Z. Weinberg J.M. Malhotra R. Merritt S. Holzman L.B. Brosius III, F.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: E958-E966Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To test the hypothesis that hypoxia-induced apoptosis is mediated in part via activation of GSK-3, A7r5 and COS-7 cells were subjected to 6 h of hypoxia in serum- and glucose-free medium. Hypoxia caused a significant decrease in phosphorylation of both Akt Ser-473 (Fig. 5, A and B) and GSK-3β Ser-9 (normoxia, 115 ± 13.8 arbitrary units; hypoxia, 18.73 ± 4.9 arbitrary units) (Fig.1, A and B). In accordance with the known inhibition of GSK-3β by phosphorylation, hypoxia caused an increase in GSK-3 activity (normoxia, 100%; hypoxia, 153 ± 19.4%) as measured by an in vitro kinase activity assay (Fig. 1 C).Figure 1Hypoxia increases GSK-3 activity. A7r5 cells were subjected to 6 h of hypoxia in the absence of serum and glucose and assessed for GSK-3 activity. A, total cell lysates (40 μg/lane) were analyzed via immunoblot analysis for GSK-3β Ser-9 phosphorylation. B, quantification of GSK-3β phosphorylation was performed with NIH ImageJ software, and data were expressed in densitometric units (±S.E.). C, total cell lysates were subjected to an in vitro GSK-3 activity assay using pGS2, a pseudosubstrate for GSK-3, expressed as percent of normoxic controls. *, p < 0.05versus control samples.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Preincubation with either of two specific inhibitors of GSK-3 reduced hypoxia-induced apoptosis in A7r5 VSMCs (Fig. 2, A and B) and in COS-7 cells (not shown) by more than 50%. In addition, the selective GSK-3 inhibitor, SB216763, reduced caspase 3 and caspase 9 activities in hypoxic cells to levels similar to those in normoxic cells (Fig. 3, A andB) The effect of GSK-3 inhibition on caspase 9 activity suggests that GSK-3 mediates its proapoptotic effects during hypoxia via a mitochondrial death pathway. To determine whether glucose metabolism affects GSK-3 activity, we supplemented the medium of A7r5 cells with 5 mm glucose during hypoxia. The presence of glucose completely prevented the hypoxia-associated reduction in GSK-3β Ser-9 phosphorylation (Fig. 4, A andB), consistent with prevention of the associated increase in GSK-3 activity. The presence of glucose also completely prevented the hypoxia-induced decline in AktSer-473 phosphorylation. (Fig. 5, A and B) Similar effects of glucose on GSK-3 and Akt phosphorylation were observed in COS-7 cells. (Fig. 4, C and D, and Fig. 5, C and D). The effects of glucose on GSK-3 phosphorylation were very similar to those seen with insulin. In normoxic A7r5 cells, exposure to 100 nm insulin for 15 min induced a 3.5 ± 0.13-fold increase in GSK-3 phosphorylation (data not shown). Given the parallel changes in GSK-3β and Akt phosphorylation in hypoxia, it appears likely that hypoxia and glucose affect signaling to Akt and GSK-3β via a PI3K-dependent pathway. Therefore, VSMCs were preincubated with LY294002, a PI3K inhibitor, and GSK-3β and Akt phosphorylation during hypoxia in the presence and absence of glucose were determined. Preincubation with LY294002 (2 μm) reversed the effects of glucose on GSK-3 phosphorylation (Fig 6, A andB), confirming that glucose restores PI3K/Akt signaling during hypoxia. We have previously demonstrated that glucose-mediated prevention of apoptosis is dependent on glycolytic metabolism (2Malhotra R. Brosius III, F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12567-12575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 3Lin Z. Weinberg J.M. Malhotra R. Merritt S. Holzman L.B. Brosius III, F.C. Am. J.

To determine whether the effects on GSK-3β and Akt were similarly dependent on glycolysis, A7r5 VSMCs were exposed to either of the glycolytic inhibitors, 2-deoxyglucose or 5-thio-glucose in the presence of 5 mm glucose during hypoxia. Glycolytic inhibition prevented the glucose-mediated effects on GSK-3β and Akt phosphorylation (Fig.7). In contrast to glucose, none of the alternate energy substrates, pyruvate (5 mm), lactate (4 mm), or propionate (4 mm), prevented hypoxia-induced reduction in GSK-3β phosphorylation (Fig.8).Figure 8Alternative energy substrates do not affect GSK-3 phosphorylation in hypoxia.

GLUT1-overexpressing cells had enhanced GSK-3β and Akt phosphorylation during normoxia when compared with control cells in the presence of 5 mm glucose. In addition, GLUT1 overexpression completely prevented the hypoxia-induced reduction in GSK-3β and Akt phosphorylation (Fig.9). GSK-3 is an ubiquitously expressed enzyme that participates in the regulation of many fundamental cellular processes including Wnt signaling during development, carbohydrate metabolism throughout the life of the cell, and apoptosis (7Woodgett J.R. Science's STKE. 2001; (http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/OC_sigtrans;2001/100/re12)PubMed Google Scholar). Only over the past few years has the role of GSK-3 in apoptosis been appreciated. Several recent reports have suggested that increased GSK-3 activity promotes apoptosis via activation of the mitochondrial cell death pathway (11Somervaille T.C. Linch D.C. Khwaja A. Blood. 2001; 98: 1374-1381Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 17Bijur G.N., De Sarno P. Jope R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7583-7590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Our studies have extended and clarified the role and regulation of GSK-3 in hypoxia-induced apoptosis. We have shown that inhibition of GSK-3 with either LiCl or SB216763 markedly attenuates hypoxia-induced apoptosis. This inhibition of GSK-3 during hypoxia prevents caspase 9 activation, indicating that GSK-3 exerts its effects at the mitochondrion or more proximally. In addition, we have shown that glucose-mediated prevention of apoptosis during hypoxia appears to be due, at least in part, to the inhibition of GSK-3 by Akt, the activity of which is enhanced by glucose metabolism. Finally, we have demonstrated that overexpression of the facilitative glucose transporter, GLUT1, enhances these effects of glucose uptake and metabolism, confirming the critical role of plasma membrane expression of these transporters in preventing hypoxia-induced apoptosis. We have found that GSK-3 mediates apoptosis in both vascular smooth muscle cells and COS-7 cells during hypoxia. Other investigators have demonstrated that GSK-3 is critical for the progression of apoptosis in a broad range of cell types due to a variety of cellular stresses including growth factor withdrawal, PI3K inhibition, inhibitors of mitochondrial electron transport, heat shock, and staurosporine (6Bijur G.N.

Thus, GSK-3 appears to mediate or potentiate apoptosis due to many stimuli that activate the mitochondrial cell death pathway. In contrast, apoptosis triggered by death receptors, the so-called extrinsic pathway, is not promoted by GSK-3 and, indeed, may be inhibited by GSK-3 activation (21Hoeflich K.P. Luo J. Rubie E.A. Tsao M.S. Jin O. Woodgett J.R. Nature. 2000; 406: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1211) Google Scholar, 22Schwabe R.F. Brenner D.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: G204-G211Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). We have previously determined that glucose uptake and metabolism and GLUT1 overexpression result in attenuation of hypoxia-induced apoptosis (2Malhotra R. Brosius III, F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12567-12575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 3Lin Z. Weinberg J.M. Malhotra R. Merritt S. Holzman L.B. Brosius III, F.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: E958-E966Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although glucose metabolism clearly inhibits the mitochondrial cell death pathway, the mechanism by which glucose metabolism prevents activation of this pathway during hypoxia has not previously been determined. Recently, Hall et al. (16Hall J.L. Chatham J.C. Eldar-Finkelman H. Gibbons G.H. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 1171-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) confirmed that GLUT1 overexpression attenuates vascular smooth muscle cell apoptosis and results in reduced GSK-3 phosphorylation. They also found that increased apoptosis due to overexpression of GSK-3 was markedly reduced in GLUT1-overexpressing cells (16Hall J.L. Chatham J.C. Eldar-Finkelman H. Gibbons G.H. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 1171-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). We have confirmed and extended these findings in hypoxia-induced apoptosis. We have found that GSK-3 is activated during hypoxia and that its inhibition prevents caspase 9 activation and activation of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. We have also shown that glucose metabolism, but not that of other substrates, prevents hypoxia-induced apoptosis and that most, but not all, of the glucose protective effect during hypoxia appears to be mediated by its inhibition of GSK-3. In addition we have shown that this effect of glucose metabolism or GLUT1 overexpression during hypoxia is via stimulation of the PI3K/Akt pathway, as inhibition of PI3K dramatically reduces the GSK-3 phosphorylation found in cells with enhanced glucose metabolism. Finally, we have found that GLUT1 overexpression enhances PI3K/Akt signaling and maintains GSK-3 in its inactive, phosphorylated state in both normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Although not yet fully assessed, it seems likely that insulin will behave very similarly to glucose in terms of its effects on GSK-3 activity and perhaps on apoptosis during hypoxia. We have shown in our system, as others have shown in other systems, that insulin induces GSK-3 phosphorylation and inactivation. However, we have not yet tested the effects of insulin during hypoxia. In any case, however, it is certain that the effects of glucose on both GSK-3 phosphorylation and apoptosis can be independent of insulin, because all of our experiments were performed in serum-free conditions and in the absence of insulin. The antiapoptotic effects of glucose metabolism and GLUT1 expression occur in a wide variety of cells and conditions besides those already cited. For example, Moley et al. (23Moley K.H. Chi M.M. Knudson C.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Mueckler M.M. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1421-1424Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar) have found that elevated extracellular glucose levels led to decreased GLUT1 expression, which resulted in diminished glucose uptake and intraembryonic free glucose levels despite extracellular elevation of glucose levels. These embryos underwent apoptosis at a 4-fold greater rate and showed increased Bax expression and apoptosis (23Moley K.H. Chi M.M. Knudson C.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Mueckler M.M. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1421-1424Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). More recently, Moley's group (23Moley K.H. Chi M.M. Knudson C.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Mueckler M.M. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1421-1424Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar) has found that antisense-GLUT1 expression in murine blastocysts augmented apoptosis in murine blastocysts incubated in normal glucose concentrations. The investigators also found that apoptosis was blocked in Bax −/− mice but not in Bax +/+ and +/− mice. These findings suggest that hyperglycemia, by decreasing glucose transport, acts as a cell death signal to trigger a mitochondrial apoptotic pathway in murine blastocysts (24Chi M.M. Pingsterhaus J. Carayannopoulos M. Moley K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40252-40257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Finally, Thompson's group (14Rathmell J.C. Vander Heiden M.G. Harris M.H. Frauwirth K.A. Thompson C.B. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 683-692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar) has found that withdrawal of lymphocyte growth and survival factors leads to cellular atrophy and apoptosis accompanied by reduction in GLUT1 expression, glucose uptake, ATP levels, and mitochondrial potential. These investigators also showed that apoptosis could be accelerated by glucose depletion (14Rathmell J.C. Vander Heiden M.G. Harris M.H. Frauwirth K.A. Thompson C.B. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 683-692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar) and could be prevented via Akt-stimulated increases in glucose uptake, GLUT1 expression, and glucose metabolism (15Plas D.R. Talapatra S. Edinger A.L. Rathmell J.C. Thompson C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12041-12048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). These latter studies and our own work suggest an important positive feedback mechanism connecting PI3K/Akt signaling with GLUT1 expression and glucose uptake. Akt enhances glucose uptake and GLUT1 expression but, conversely, increased GLUT1 expression and the resultant glucose uptake and metabolism enhance PI3K/Akt signaling, maintaining GSK-3 phosphorylation and keeping GSK-3 inactive. This self-reinforcing, antiapoptotic system maintains cellular integrity and metabolism. However, in cases of severe cellular stress or withdrawal of critical growth factors, PI3K/Akt signaling is inhibited, leading to a reduction in glucose uptake and GLUT1 expression, both of which can rapidly lead to programmed cell death. The mechanisms of the inhibition of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway during hypoxia and its restoration with glucose are unknown. It is possible that this represents a generic effect of ATP depletion during hypoxia in the absence of glucose and normalization of ATP levels with glucose, thus providing substrate for phosphorylation. However, because GSK-3 inhibition protects cells against apoptosis during hypoxia, it is likely that GSK-3, at least, has residual kinase activity despite hypoxia and the absence of glucose. Moreover, the fact that GLUT1 overexpression induces activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway during normoxia suggests that increased glucose flux stimulates PI3K/Akt activity directly even in the presence of normal ATP levels. It is possible that glucose uptake and metabolism specifically induce activation of the insulin receptor, insulin receptor substrate 1, or PI3K. However, there are no published data to support such an effect. Mechanistic understanding of the interactions of glucose transport and metabolism with cellular signaling pathways should further help to elucidate the regulatory role of glucose metabolism in apoptosis as well as during normal cell function."

Systematic analyses of OPNpromoter-luciferase reporter constructs identify a CCTCATGAC motif at nucleotides −80 to −72 relative to the initiation site that supports OPN transcription in VSMCs. The region −83 to −45 encompassing this motif confers basal and glucose- and 2-DG-dependent transcription on an unresponsive promoter.

Medial calcification occurs via a mineralization process that does not form cartilage, with calcium deposition occurring in the collagenous extracellular matrix associated with matrix vesicles adjacent to arterial VSMCs 1The abbreviations used are: VSMC, vascular smooth muscle cells; AP1, activator protein 1; BMP2, bone morphogenetic proteins 2; CMV, cytomegalovirus immediate early promoter; 2-DG, 2-deoxyglucose; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; FCS, fetal calf serum; Gal4RE, Gal4 response element; GAPD, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; G4DBD, Gal4 DNA-binding domain; LDLR, low density lipoprotein receptor; LUC, luciferase gene; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MEK, MAPK/ERK kinase; MMP1, matrix metalloproteinase 1; MUT, duplex oligodeoxynucleotide mutant; oligo, oligonucleotide; 3-OMG, 3-O-methylglucose; OPN, osteopontin; pFRLUC, Gal4-responsive LUC reporter plasmid; RSK2, ribosomal subunit kinase 2; USF, upstream stimulatory factor; RSV, Rous sarcoma virus; RT, reverse transcription (5Tanimura A.

Initially thought to be benign, medial calcification has emerged as one predictor of cardiovascular mortality (2Niskanen L. Siitonen O. Suhonen M. Uusitupa M.I.

The mechanism whereby medial calcification conveys excess mortality are unknown, but vascular stiffening prevents the compensatory vasodilatation that decreases afterload and myocardial oxygen consumption with exertion, thus exacerbating myocardial ischemia from concomitant atherosclerotic coronary disease (6Hickler R.B.

Feeding LDLR −/− mice high fat diets induces insulin-resistant diabetes and dyslipidemia, with associated mineral deposition in the fibrosa of the valve leaflets and the arterial wall. As initially proposed by Demer and colleagues (12Bostrom K. Watson K.E. Horn S. Wortham C. Herman I.M. Demer L.L. J. Clin.

Aortic expression of the bone matrix protein osteopontin (OPN) is up-regulated and is detected in several aortic cell types including activated macrophages of atheroma, vascular smooth muscle cells of the tunica media, and adventitial and valvular fibrosal cells (11Towler D.A.

OPN is a multifunctional protein produced by osteoblasts during skeletal development and in VSMCs, monocytes, and T-cells in response to biological stressors (14Denhardt D.T. Noda M. O'Regan A.W.

Via signaling functions dependent upon phosphorylation, OPN inhibits mineral deposition (17Wada T. McKee M.D. Steitz S. Giachelli C.M. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 166-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). OPN also functions as a proinflammatory cytokine produced by stimulated monocytes and T-cells (14Denhardt D.T. Noda M. O'Regan A.W.

Very recently, Mori and co-workers (19Takemoto M. Yokote K. Yamazaki M. Ridall A.L. Butler W.T. Matsumoto T. Tamura K. Saito Y. Mori S. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

They identified that immunoreactive OPN was in fact up-regulated in medial vascular smooth muscles cells in arteries of diabetic patients (19Takemoto M. Yokote K. Yamazaki M. Ridall A.L. Butler W.T.

Harrington S. Edwards W.D. Oberg A.L. Fitzpatrick L.A. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 87: 1062-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), Thompson and co-workers (21Li G. Chen Y.F. Kelpke S.S. Oparil S. Thompson J.A. Circulation. 2000; 101: 2949-2955Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that the adventitial mesenchymal cell population is migratory, moving into the tunica media and neointima in response to biomechanical injury. A role is thus proposed for OPN in the migration of VSMCs and adventitial mesenchymal progenitors in the diseased aorta. Therefore, the enhanced expression of OPN in the arterial vasculature in response to diabetes is likely to participate in disease progression, regulating macrophage functions, adventitial cell migration, and calcium deposition (17Wada T. McKee M.D. Steitz S. Giachelli C.M. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 166-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). The goal of this study was to characterize transcription factor complexes that confer basal and regulated OPN gene expression in aortic VSMCs relevant to the pathobiology of diabetic calcific vasculopathy. We have identified that OPN gene expression is differentially regulated by glucose and 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) in cultured primary aortic mesenchymal cells that express VSMC α-actin. We cloned the 2-kb mouse OPN promoter (−1976 to +78, numbered relative to the start site of transcription) (22Miyazaki Y. Setoguchi M. Yoshida S. Higuchi Y. Akizuki S. Yamamoto S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14432-14438Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and evaluated the activity in A7r5 rat aortic VSMCs, a rodent cell line that faithfully reproduces the gene expression protein elicited by aortic VSMCs in vivo (23Solway J. Seltzer J. Samaha F.F. Kim S. Alger L.E. Niu Q. Morrisey E.E., Ip, H.S. Parmacek M.S. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 17206-17212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Glucose (≥5 mm) selectively up-regulates activity of the OPN promoter. By contrast, mannitol, an osmotic control, and 3-O-methyl glucose, a nonmetabolized glucose an analog, have no effect. We identified that nucleotides −83 to −46 relative to the transcription initiation site encompass information necessary and sufficient for high level transcriptional activity in VSMCs. This 38-bp fragment of theOPN promoter confers basal and glucose metabolism-dependent transcription onto an unresponsive heterologous minimal promoter. A CCTCATGAC motif at −80 to −72 that is recognized by USF1, USF2, c-Fos, and c-Jun supports OPNpromoter activity in VSMCs. These complexes are regulated by glucose. Both USF1 binding and protein accumulation are reciprocally regulated during the manipulation of cellular glucose metabolism with glucose and 2-DG. Co-transfection studies demonstrate that USF (USF1:USF2) and AP1 (cFos:cJun) support OPN transcription and that the transactivation functions of c-Fos and USF1 are specifically enhanced by glucose. Thus, basal and regulated protein-DNA interactions at the CCTCATGAC motif at −80 to −72 participate in OPN gene expression responses in VSMC during glucose-dependent initiation of diabetic vasculopathy. USF and AP1 contribute to the glucose-dependent regulation of arterial VSMC OPN expression in diabetes. Tissue culture supplies and custom synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides were obtained from Invitrogen. Reagents for protein preparation were obtained from Pierce, Sigma, and Fisher. Radionucleotides were obtained fromAmersham Biosciences. A7r5 cells (ATCC CRL-1444) were maintained as described previously (25Kimes B.W. Brandt B.L. Exp. Cell Res. 1976; 98: 349-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 26Newberry E.P. Willis D. Latifi T. Boudreaux J.M. Towler D.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1129-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Primary aortic adventitial mesenchymal cells were obtained from aortic explants essentially as detailed previously (27Diglio C.A. Grammas P. Giacomelli F. Wiener J. Lab. Invest. 1989; 60: 523-531PubMed Google Scholar) but using C57Bl/6 mice in lieu of rats. Cultures were passaged in DMEM with 4.5 g/liter glucose, 4 mm glutamine, and 10% fetal calf serum (and penicillin-streptomycin) to maintain the phenotype (25Kimes B.W. Brandt B.L. Exp. Cell Res. 1976; 98: 349-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). About 16 confluent 10-cm-diameter tissue culture dishes were obtained/eight 2-cm segments of murine aortae. Antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; specific antibodies include USF1 (sc-8983 or sc-229), USF2 (sc-861), c-Fos (sc-253 or sc-52), FosB (sc-7203), Fra1 (sc-183), Fra2 (sc-171), c-Jun (sc-44 or sc-45), phospho-c-Jun (sc-822), JunD (sc-74), Smad 1/5 (sc-6031), Oct1 (sc-232), Oct2 (sc-233), Oct4 (sc-9081), Gli1 (sc-6152 or sc-6153), and CTCF (sc-5916) or BTEB2 (sc-12998). A7r5 aortic VSMCs were maintained with DMEM containing 1 g/liter (5.5 mm) glucose. Treatment of A7r5 cells with either glucose or mannitol was performed in glucose-free DMEM, 10% glucose-free FCS (dialyzed against glucose-free DMEM) supplemented with either sterile water (0.1% v/v, vehicle; 0 mm glucose) or carbohydrates (5 mm glucose or mannitol, 50 mm glucose or mannitol, 100 mmglucose or mannitol as indicated). The nonmetabolized derivative of glucose, 3-O-methylglucose (3-OMG) was added as a control. Unlike A7r5 cells, primary aortic VSMCs do not adapt well to ex vivo culture under completely glucose-free conditions even with 4 mm glutamine provided as an alternative carbon source (25Kimes B.W. Brandt B.L. Exp. Cell Res. 1976; 98: 349-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar,28Hall J.L. Matter C.M. Wang X. Gibbons G.H. Circ.

Therefore, to permit a direct comparison of OPN mRNA accumulation between A7r5 and primary aortic cell cultures, cohorts were cultured in the presence of 2-DG, a competitive inhibitor of cellular glucose uptake and intracellular glucose metabolism (29Mueller W.M. Gregoire F.M. Stanhope K.L. Mobbs C.V. Mizuno T.M. Warden C.H. Stern J.S. Havel P.J. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 551-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar), in the presence of glucose-free DMEM with undialyzed FCS (final glucose concentration ∼0.5 mm glucose) to pharmacologically induce acute and reproducible extremes in cellular glucose tone. Experiments designed to examine the reversibility of 2-DG actions by glucose were carried out in the presence or absence of 2 mm 2-DG. Primary aortic mesenchymal cells obtained from wild type adult C57Bl/6 mice were passaged once and then plated at 80% confluence in 10-cm tissue culture dishes. Subsequently, cells were treated for 24 h in 10% undialyzed FCS with glucose-free DMEM (∼0.5 mm residual glucose from the FCS) or in media supplemented with 2 mm2-deoxyglucose, 4 mm 2-deoxyglucose, 30 mmglucose, or 30 mm glucose + 2 mm2-deoxyglucose. At the end of the treatment period, total RNA was extracted as described previously (30Towler D.A. Rutledge S.J. Rodan G.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1484-1493Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). An Applied Biosystems GeneAmp 5700 sequence detection system using Sybr Green dye binding to PCR product was used to quantify osteogenic mRNA accumulation via fluorescence RT-PCR (31Bustin S.A. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 25: 169-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (3059) Google Scholar). Primer Express 1.0 software was used to design amplimers from murine OPN and Msx2cDNA sequences. Amplimers for OPN are: 5′-GTA TTG CTT TTG CCT GTT TGG-3′ and 5′-TGA GCT GCC AGA ATC AGT CAC T-3′. Amplimers for murineMsx2 are: 5′-TCC CAG CTT CTA GCC TTG GA-3′ and 5′-CAG CCC GCT CTG CTAT GG-3′. Commercially available primers from Applied Biosystems were used to quantify GAPD expression for normalization in RT-PCR (TaqMan Rodent GAPDH Control Reagent, PE Biosytems, Palo Alto, CA). Standard curves were generated usingOPN and Msx2 DNA standards. Data are presented as the mean ± S.D. results from three independent replications of two independent experiments. Total cellular RNA was isolated from VSMCs and Northern blot analysis carried out as described previously (30Towler D.A. Rutledge S.J. Rodan G.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1484-1493Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar,32Newberry E.P. Latifi T. Towler D.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10678-10690Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Cultures of mouse aortic adventitial cells and A7r5 rat aortic VSMCs were evaluated for expression of OPN and VSMC α-actin by immunohistochemistry using the streptavidin-biotin-immunoperoxidase method (33Mark M.P. Prince C.W. Gay S. Austin R.L. Bhown M. Finkelman R.D. Butler W.T. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1987; 2: 337-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). A mouse monoclonal antibody to human VMSC α-actin was obtained from a commercial source (product code CBL 171, clone asm-1, Cymbus Biotechnology). The osteopontin antibody utilized was MPIIIB10 (1Niskanen L.K. Suhonen M. Siitonen O. Lehtinen J.M. Uusitupa M.I. Atherosclerosis. 1990; 84: 61-71Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), which has been used previously to localize vascular OPN expression in calcified aortic specimens (34Bini A. Mann K.G. Kudryk B.J. Schoen F.J. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 1852-1861Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). This mouse monoclonal was developed by Michael Solursh and Ahnders Franzen (Dept. of Biological Sciences, University of Iowa, Iowa City) and was obtained from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank developed under the auspices of the NICHD, National Institutes of Health, and maintained by the Department of Biological Sciences, University of Iowa. Immunostaining of cultured cells was performed using the DAKO Animal Research Kit with peroxidase histochemistry (DAKO Corp., Carpinteria, CA) as per the manufacturer's protocol, using diaminobenzidine with H2O2 as the chromagen substrate. Microscopic images of immunohistochemically stained cells were captured with a Nikon Coolpix 990 3.3 megapixel digital camera mounted to a Nikon Eclipse TS100 inverted microscope (Melville, NY). Mouse USF1 cDNA was obtained by PCR amplification (which also introduced convenient 5′- and 3′ linkers) from commercially available murine heart cDNA (Clontech Marathon-Ready cDNA; Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) and subcloned into theKpnI/BamHI sites of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). In addition, coupled in vitro transcription/translation (Promega, Madison, WI) was used to verify protein production using techniques detailed previously (35Newberry E.P. Latifi T. Battaile J.T. Towler D.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10451-10462Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The same techniques were used to develop the eukaryotic expression constructs for c-Fos and c-Jun in pcDNA3. The expression vector for USF2 (kindly provided by Dr. M. Sawadogo) has been described previously (36Luo X. Sawadogo M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1367-1375Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). PATHDETECT vectors for eukaryotic expression of Gal4DBD fusion proteins (pFACMV) and the Gal4RE-LUC reporter (pFRLUC) were purchased from Stratagene. pFACMV was used to assemble the eukaryotic expression plasmid for Gal4DBD-USF1. The synthesis of 1976 OPNLUC (mouse OPN promoter fragment −1976 to +78 in pGL2 Basic; numbering as per Yamamoto and colleagues (22Miyazaki Y. Setoguchi M. Yoshida S. Higuchi Y. Akizuki S. Yamamoto S.

OPN promoter deletions, point mutants, and heterologous promoter constructs were generated using methods as detailed (38Boudreaux J.M. Towler D.A. J. Biol.

All constructs were sequenced to verify fidelity (Applied Biosystems Prism Dye Terminator Kit, Foster City, CA). A7r5 aortic VSMCs were transfected using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen). CMV β-galactosidase (300 ng) was included as an internal control for transfection efficiency. One day after transfection, cultures were rinsed with glucose-free DMEM and then fed with glucose-free DMEM, 10% dialyzed FCS serum supplemented with glucose, mannitol, 3-OMG, or 2-DG as indicated. After 3 days, cellular luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were measured as detailed previously (38Boudreaux J.M. Towler D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7508-7515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 40Newberry E.P. Boudreaux J.M. Towler D.A. J. Biol.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7549-7554Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Crude extracts for gel shift analyses were prepared from control, glucose, and/or 2-DG treated cells (see above) as detailed previously (26Newberry E.P. Willis D. Latifi T. Boudreaux J.M. Towler D.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1129-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The radiolabeledOPN promoter duplex oligo fragments (see Fig. 4) were used to detect DNA-protein interactions by gel shift and supershift as described. Western blots were carried out with chemiluminescent immunodetection (Tropix, Bedford, MA) as described previously (26Newberry E.P. Willis D. Latifi T. Boudreaux J.M. Towler D.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1129-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar,41Bidder M. Loewy A.P. Latifi T. Newberry E.P. Ferguson G. Willis D.M. Towler D.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8917-8928Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Previously, we identified that OPN gene expression is up-regulated in aortic VSMCs, adventitial cells, and macrophages of LDLR−/− mice fed diabetogenic diets. In situ hybridization studies revealed that aortic mesenchymal OPN expression overlaps the pattern of VSMC α-actin in adventitial cells, mural VSMCs, and valvular fibrosal cells (11Towler D.A. Bidder M. Latifi T. Coleman T. Semenkovich C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30427-30434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). We wished to establish a cell culture model for studying OPN transcription in aortic mesenchymal cells. Therefore, we studied the expression and regulation of OPN in primary aortic mesenchymal cell cultures and the A7r5 aortic VSMC line, a rat aortic VSMC line that faithfully recapitulates the transcriptional regulatory features of arterial smooth muscle cells (23Solway J. Seltzer J. Samaha F.F. Kim S. Alger L.E. Niu Q. Morrisey E.E., Ip, H.S. Parmacek M.S. J. Biol.

As in A7r5 VSMCs (Fig.1 A), immunohistochemical analysis of primary aortic mesenchymal cells (Fig.1 D) demonstrates robust staining of >80% of cells with VSMC-specific α-actin, indicative of smooth muscle phenotype (42Halayko A.J. Solway J. J. Appl. Physiol. 2001; 90: 358-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar,43Walsh K. Takahashi A. Z. Kardiol. 2001; 90 Suppl 3: 12-16PubMed Google Scholar). Immunohistochemistry further identified the expression of OPN in both A7r5 cells and primary murine aortic cells; in A7r5 cells, the prominent perinuclear Golgi staining described by others (33Mark M.P. Prince C.W. Gay S. Austin R.L. Bhown M. Finkelman R.D. Butler W.T. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1987; 2: 337-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) was readily apparent. Northern blot and RT-PCR analyses confirmed expression of OPN mRNA in these cells and identified response to alterations in glucose treatment and metabolism. As shown in Fig. 2 A, treatment of primary cultures of aortic mesenchymal VSMCs up-regulatedOPN mRNA accumulation by ∼2-fold. By contrast, treatment with 2-DG dose dependently and selectively down-regulatedOPN mRNA accumulation by 80% (Fig. 2 B;GAPD normalized) as quantified by fluorescence RT-PCR analyses. The Msx2 gene was regulated in culture in a completely different manner; glucose suppressed Msx2mRNA accumulation, and 2-DG actually augmented Msx2expression 3-fold (Fig. 2 B), demonstrating that the acute exposure to 2-DG is not toxic to primary aortic cells. Although expressed at much higher levels, OPN mRNA accumulation was similarly regulated by 2-DG and glucose in A7r5 cells (Fig.2 C; and see below), and 5–50 mm mannitol did not regulate OPN in this VSMC line (data not shown, and see below).

In a search for new β-catenin-Tcf target genes, we analyzed β-catenin-induced alterations of gene expression in primary human hepatocytes, after transduction of either dominant stable β-catenin or its truncated, transactivation-deficient counterpart by means of a lentiviral vector. cDNA microarray analysis revealed a limited set of up-regulated genes, including known Wnt targets such as matrilysin and keratin-1. In this screen, we identified the CXC chemokine interleukin 8 (IL-8) as a direct target of β-catenin-Tcf4. IL-8 is constitutively expressed in various cancers, and it has been implicated in tumor progression through its mitogenic, motogenic, and angiogenic activities. The IL-8 promoter contains a unique consensus Tcf/Lef site that is critical for IL-8 activation by β-catenin. We show here that the p300 coactivator was required for efficient transactivation of β-catenin on this promoter. Ectopic expression of β-catenin in hepatoma cells promoted IL-8 secretion, which stimulated endothelial cell migration. These data define IL-8 as a Wnt target and suggest that IL-8 induction by β-catenin might be implicated in developmental and tumorigenic processes.

These effects are achieved through the stabilization of β-catenin and its translocation to the nucleus as a coactivator for high mobility group-box proteins of the Tcf/Lef family (3Behrens J. von Kries J.P.

In the absence of Wnt, a multiprotein complex including the protein kinase GSK3β, adenomatous polyposis coli, and Axin induces phosphorylation of β-catenin at N-terminal serine and threonine residues, and phosphorylated β-catenin is directed toward proteasome-mediated degradation (5Rubinfeld B.

Activation of Wnt abrogates the degradation pathway, leading to elevated levels of transcriptionally active β-catenin (7Staal F.J. van Noort M. Strous G.J. Clevers H.C. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 63-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar).

The selective activation of distinct Wnt target genes in proper context is strictly controlled by the interplay of positive and negative regulatory signals on Wnt-responsive promoters (13Hecht A.

Aberrant activation of Wnt signaling is also implicated as a major step in the development of various forms of human cancer (15Polakis P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1837-1851Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). De-regulation of β-catenin in cancer results mainly from genetic defects in the N-terminal region of the β-catenin gene itself or in adenomatous polyposis coli or Axin genes. The role of β-catenin is predominant at early steps of colon carcinogenesis, in which truncating mutations of adenomatous polyposis coli leading to elevated levels of β-catenin account for about 80% of cases, whereas stable dominant β-catenin mutants are present in one-half of the remaining cases (16Morin P.J. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 1021-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). Activation of Wnt signaling in hepatocellular carcinoma is mainly associated with missense mutations of the β-catenin gene in about 20% of cases and loss-of-function mutations of the Axin-1 gene in another 8% (17de La Coste A.

However, although most candidate β-catenin target genes were found to be up-regulated in colon cancer (32Wong N.A. Pignatelli M. Am. J. Pathol. 2002; 160: 389-401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar), their implication in other tumor types has rarely been investigated and remains to be determined. To better understand the role of activated β-catenin in liver tumorigenesis, we sought to identify genes that are deregulated by overexpression of a dominant stable β-catenin mutant in primary human hepatocytes. These genes were identified by analysis of expression profiles on cDNA arrays, in cells infected with a lentiviral vector that allows expression of transduced genes with high efficiency in nondividing cells (33Zennou V. Petit C. Guetard D. Nerhbass U. Montagnier L. Charneau P. Cell. 2000; 101: 173-185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). The set of differentially expressed genes included previously described targets of β-catenin, as well as known genes not previously linked to the Wnt pathway. The current study demonstrates that the CXC chemokine interleukin-8 (IL-8)1 is a novel transcriptional target of the β-catenin-Tcf complex. IL-8 activities on cell growth, motility, and angiogenesis strongly suggest that this chemokine might represent an important downstream effector of the Wnt pathway during developmental and oncogenic processes. A dominant stable β-catenin carrying a mutation at residue 41 (threonine → alanine; T41A β-cat) was generated by site-directed mutagenesis of full-length, myc-tagged β-catenin cDNA (a gift of J. Hulsken) and cloned into pcDNA3 as described previously (34Wei Y. Fabre M. Branchereau S. Gauthier F. Perilongo G. Buendia M.A. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 498-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). A truncated, transactivation-deficient mutant of β-catenin (ΔNΔCβ-cat) was constructed by amplification of the arm repeat domain (residues 130–680) by PCR with appropriate primers providing an initiation codon and a stop codon and was cloned into pcDNA3. The reporter plasmids pTOP-FLASH and pFOP-FLASH and expression vectors for Tcf4 and myc-tagged dominant negative ΔNTcf4 (4Korinek V. Barker N. Morin P.J. van Wichen D. de Weger R. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Clevers H. Science. 1997; 275: 1784-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2937) Google Scholar) were kindly provided by H. Clevers. The expression vector for p300 was a gift of Y. Nakatani. IL-8 promoter fragments of different sizes were amplified from human genomic DNA with appropriate sets of primers (available upon request). Mutations of the consensus Tcf/Lef binding site that abolished Tcf binding (AAGATCAAAG → AAGGCCAAAG) were introduced in the forward primer of the −193 IL-8 promoter construct. PCR products were cloned into the pCRII-TOPO vector (Invitrogen), andKpnI-XhoI fragments were subcloned into the promoterless luciferase vector pGL3-Basic (Promega). All constructs were verified by sequencing. Hepatocytes were prepared from resected normal human livers adjacent to hepatoblastoma or to intrahepatic metastases of breast or colon cancer or from residual graft donor liver fragments. All experimental procedures were conducted in conformity with French laws and regulations and with informed consent of the patients. Hepatocytes were isolated by two-step collagenase perfusion as described previously (35Gugen-Guillouzo C. Campion J.P. Brissot P. Glaise D. Launois B. Bourel M. Guillouzo A. Cell Biol. Intern. Rep. 1982; 6: 625-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Briefly, after perfusion with calcium-free HEPES buffer, pH 7.7, and liver tissue digestion with HEPES containing 1 mg/ml collagenase D (Sigma) and 5 mm CaCl2, the cell suspension was filtered through a 70-μm mesh cell strainer (BD Biosciences). Cell debris and nonparenchymal cells were partly eliminated by centrifugation at 700 rpm for 1.5 min, and cell viability was assessed by a trypan blue exclusion test. The hepatocyte-enriched fraction was seeded in William's medium on collagen I-coated plates at 7 × 104 cells per cm2, in William's medium supplemented with 10 nm insulin, 100 mm triiodothyronine, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. All constructs were generated using the lentiviral vector pTRIPΔU3 (36Sirven A. Ravet E. Charneau P. Zennou V. Coulombel L. Guéraed D. Pflumio F. Dubart-Kupperschmitt A. Mol. Ther. 2001; 3: 438-447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The pTRIP-β-cat and the pTRIP-ΔNΔCβ-cat constructs were generated by cloning the BamHI-SalI fragment containing full-length T41A β-catenin cDNA and theBglII-XhoI fragment containing the truncated β-catenin mutant ΔNΔCβ-cat downstream of the cytomegalovirus promoter in the BamHI-XhoI sites of pTRIP. The pTRIP-Tcf4 and pTRIP-ΔNTcf4 constructs were generated by cloningBglII-XhoI fragments of Tcf4 and ΔNTcf4 cDNAs in the BamHI-XhoI sites of pTRIP. To obtain pTRIP-TOP and pTRIP-FOP, a 3130-bp PvuII fragment was excised from pTOP-FLASH and pFOP-FLASH and cloned into bluntedMluI-XhoI sites of the lentiviral vector. Virions were produced by transient calcium phosphate cotransfection of 293T cells as described previously (33Zennou V. Petit C. Guetard D. Nerhbass U. Montagnier L. Charneau P. Cell. 2000; 101: 173-185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). At 48 h post-transfection, supernatants were treated with DNase and ultracentrifuged, and viral stocks were frozen at −80 °C. The concentration of virion particles was normalized by measuring the p24 capsid protein by ELISA (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Cells were incubated for 2 h with virions at a concentration of 800 ng of viral p24/ml in one-tenth of the usual volume of William's medium. Fresh medium was then added, and cell were further incubated for 48 h. Total RNA was extracted from primary cells and cell lines using the RNA-PLUS extraction solution (Quantum Biotechnologies). For hybridization of Atlas Plastic Human 8K microarrays (Clontech),33P-labeled probes were generated by reverse transcription of 20 μg of total RNA according to the manufacturer's instructions. After hybridization, filters were scanned at 50-μm resolution using a Fuji BAS-5000 phosphorimager. Data were processed using Clontech AtlasImage 2.01 software. Intensities were adjusted through a median normalization, and differential expression was considered significant when signal ratio for the same spot was ≥2. For Northern blotting, 10 μg of total RNA was analyzed by alkaline blot as described previously (37Renard C.A. Fourel G. Bralet M.P. Degott C., De la Coste A. Perret C. Tiollais P. Buendia M.A. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2678-2686Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). For RT-PCR, up to 2 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed using Superscript II RT RNase H-Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) and oligo(dT) primers. Amplifications were carried out in PCR exponential phase (20–35 cycles) to allow comparison among cDNAs synthesized from identical reactions. PCR products were analyzed in 1.5% agarose gels. The housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was amplified as control. Primer sequences are as follows: Keratin-F, 5′-gagtaccaggaggtgatgaactcc-3′; Keratin-R, 5′-AACACAGATCAAGAGCAG-3′; MMP7-F, 5′-GCAGCTATGCGACTCACCG-3′; MMP7-R, 5′-CTGCCTGAAGTTTCTATTTC-3′; IL-8-F, 5′-CATGACTTCCAAGCTGGCCG-3′; IL-8-R, 5′-TTTATGAATTCTCAGCCCTC-3′; GAPDH-F, 5′-ACCACAGTCCATGCCATCAC-3′; GAPDH-R, 5′-TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA-3′. The human kidney cell line 293, the hepatoma cell lines Huh7 and HepG2, and the immortalized human hepatocytes LO2 (38Liao C. Zhao M. Song H. Uchida K. Yokoyama K.K. Li T. Hepatology. 2000; 32: 721-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) (a kind gift of P. Pineau), were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. For reporter assays, semi-confluent cells in 6-well plates were transiently transfected by calcium phosphate precipitation with expression vectors for β-catenin, Tcf4, ΔNTcf4, or p300, and 0.1 μg of different pIL-8-LUC constructs. Luciferase activity was determined 48 h later. All experiments were performed in duplicate and repeated at least three times. A thymidine kinase-β-galactosidase plasmid was cotransfected to normalize luciferase activity for transfection efficiency. However, because p300 was found to activate transcription of this reporter, it could not be used for normalization, and results were confirmed by multiple independent assays. The total amount of transfected DNA was kept constant by adding pcDNA3. Cells were lysed in chilled lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm NaF) supplemented with protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Whole cell extracts were resolved in 8–16% Tris-HCl polyacrylamide gels (Novex) and transferred to Hybond-C extra membranes (Amersham Biosciences). Western blots were probed with a monoclonal anti-β-catenin antibody (Transduction Laboratories) or a polyclonal anti-IL-8 antibody (BIOSOURCE), followed by secondary antibodies. Immunoreactive proteins were visualized using protocols and reagents of the Western CDP-star kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). LO2 cells were plated at 104cells/ml, infected with different lentivirus vectors as indicated, and supernatants were collected at different times and frozen immediately. IL-8 ELISA was performed on 1-ml aliquots as described previously (39Marty C. Misset B. Tamion F. Fitting C. Carlet J. Cavaillon J.M. Crit. Care Med. 1994; 22: 673-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), using a monoclonal anti-human IL-8 antibody provided by J-C. Mazié (Hybridolab, Institut Pasteur) and a rabbit polyclonal anti-IL-8 antibody kindly provided by Dr. N. Vita (Sanofi Recherche, Labège, France). Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) (Clonetics; BioWhittaker) were propagated through passage 6 in MCDB131 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 2 mm Glutamax (Invitrogen), 12% fetal calf serum, 10 units/ml porcine heparin (Sigma), 10 ng/ml hu-EGF (Peprotech Inc.), 35 μg/ml endothelial cell growth supplement (BD Biosciences), and 1 μg/ml hydrocortisone (Sigma). Subconfluent HUVECs were starved for 2–3 h in M199 medium containing 2% fetal calf serum and 1 μm Calcein-AM (Molecular Probes) for cell labeling. Cells were trypsinized, pelleted, and resuspended in M199 medium containing 0.1% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (I. D. Bio, Limoges, France). Cells (5 × 104 per well) were placed in the upper chambers of 8-μm cell culture inserts (Falcon HTS Fluoroblock; BD Biosciences) coated with 50 μg/ml collagen I. The lower wells contained conditioned medium from LO2 cells infected with different pTRIP constructs as indicated. For control, we used either M199 with 0.1% bovine serum albumin (background control) or MCDB 131 containing 8% fetal calf serum and 30% conditioned medium from differentiating primary human erythroblasts (control chemoattractant medium) (40Tordjman R. Delaire S. Plouet J. Ting S. Gaulard P. Fichelson S. Romeo P.H. Lemarchandel V. Blood. 2001; 97: 1968-1974Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). IL-8-neutralizing antibody or control goat IgG (1 μg/well) was included in lower wells 30 min before migration was monitored. After incubation for 2 h at 37 °C, cells on the upper side of the filters were washed off, and cells that had migrated through the filters were fixed in formalin, stained with propidium iodide (2 μg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline, overnight at 4 °C), and counted under a fluorescent microscope. At least ten random fields per well at 32× magnification were counted for each experiment. To identify genes whose expression is regulated by β-catenin-Tcf in the liver context, we analyzed differentially expressed genes by microarray profiling in primary human hepatocytes after β-catenin gene transfer. Human hepatocytes at 24 h post-plating were infected with the lentiviral vector pTRIPΔU3 (36Sirven A. Ravet E. Charneau P. Zennou V. Coulombel L. Guéraed D. Pflumio F. Dubart-Kupperschmitt A. Mol. Ther. 2001; 3: 438-447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) or with a recombinant vector (pTRIP-β-cat) expressing the stable dominant T41A β-catenin under control of the cytomegalovirus promoter. The TRIP vector was chosen, because it allows high transduction efficiency in differentiated, nondividing cells (33Zennou V. Petit C. Guetard D. Nerhbass U. Montagnier L. Charneau P. Cell. 2000; 101: 173-185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). Our preliminary experiments with pTRIP-β-cat indicated that over 90% of hepatocytes abundantly expressed β-catenin in the nucleus. Moreover, co-infections with pTRIP-β-cat and vectors expressing the luciferase reporter under control of consensus Tcf binding motifs (pTRIP-TOP) or its mutated, unresponsive version (pTRIP-FOP) indicated that activation of Tcf-mediated transcription reached maximal values at 48 h (data not shown). This time was therefore selected in microarray experiments. To discriminate direct transcriptional targets of the β-catenin-Tcf complex among deregulated genes, we also infected hepatocytes with an expression vector for truncated β-catenin retaining the central arm repeat region and devoid of transactivation activity (pTRIP-ΔNΔCβ-cat). As shown in Fig.1 A, both full-length and truncated β-catenin were highly expressed in infected hepatocytes. cDNA probes were generated from the RNA of primary human hepatocytes infected with pTRIP-β-cat, pTRIP-ΔNΔCβ-cat, and empty vector. These probes were used for differential hybridization with a cDNA array (Atlas 8K; Clontech) containing 8,000 sequence-verified, known human genes. Around 1,200 genes were detectably expressed in cultured hepatocytes, including liver markers such as hepatic arginase and hepatic lipase, consistent with the observed persistence of hepatocyte-like morphology during short term culture. We have compared the expression profiles between hepatocytes infected with pTRIP-β-cat and the empty vector and identified 200 genes that were differentially expressed by 2-fold or higher, including 57 genes that were up-regulated. In a second step, expression profiles were compared between cells expressing T41A β-catenin and those expressing the transactivation-deficient ΔNΔC β-catenin. Forty-two of the 57 genes were still expressed differentially, suggesting that their up-regulation was dependent upon β-catenin transactivation activity. Among these genes, we noted known Wnt-responsive genes such as matrilysin (MMP7) and basic keratin-1 genes, as well as a member of the WISP family, the connective tissue growth factor (Table I), whereas cyclin D1 expression remained undetectable in all settings.Table ISelected genes differentially expressed in cDNA array screensGenesRatiosGenBank™ Accession No.β-Cat/Emptyβ-Cat/ΔNΔCβ-catMMP732Z11887Keratin-1 basic6.26.2NM_002281CTGF2.753.3NM_001901Interleukin-84.62.6Y00787β-Catenin1515Z19054Expression profiles were compared between hepatocytes infected with pTRIP-β-cat or the empty vector and between hepatocytes infected with pTRIP vectors expressing dominant stable β-catenin or the truncated, inactive ΔNΔCβ-catenin.

Open table in a new tab Expression profiles were compared between hepatocytes infected with pTRIP-β-cat or the empty vector and between hepatocytes infected with pTRIP vectors expressing dominant stable β-catenin or the truncated, inactive ΔNΔCβ-catenin. The ratios of signal intensities obtained for four genes up-regulated by β-catenin are shown. β-Catenin data are presented as control. Note that ΔNΔCβ-catenin did not hybridize with C-terminal β-catenin cDNA sequences spotted on the array. Search for consensus Tcf binding sites in the promoters of candidate genes revealed the presence of AAGATCAAAG sequences at position −186 to −177 in the IL-8 promoter. IL-8 mRNA was enhanced 4.6-fold by β-catenin in the first cDNA array screen and was still higher in the second screen when cells expressing transcriptionally active β-catenin were compared with those expressing transcription-defective β-catenin (Table I). Differential expression of IL-8 in β-catenin-expressing cells was confirmed by semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis in two independent primary hepatocyte cultures, as also found for MMP7 and keratin-1 genes (Fig. 1 B). Furthermore, IL-8 mRNA levels were higher in hepatocytes expressing constitutively active β-catenin than in those expressing ΔNΔC β-catenin. To assess whether IL-8 transcriptional activation was Tcf4-dependent, we performed co-infections with pTRIP-β-cat and vectors expressing either wild type Tcf4 (pTRIP-Tcf4) or a dominant negative mutant devoid of β-catenin binding domain (pTRIP-ΔNTcf4). Efficient expression of wild type and mutant Tcf4 in hepatocytes was verified by Northern blotting (Fig. 1 A). The ΔNTcf4 mutant strongly inhibited β-catenin-induced IL-8 expression (Fig. 1 B). Similar data were obtained in the well differentiated hepatic cell lines Huh7 and LO2, in which the β-catenin pathway is not activated constitutively (Fig.1 C). Up-regulation of IL-8 was also evidenced, both at mRNA and protein levels, in LO2 cells after treatment with LiCl 20 mm (Fig.2). LiCl is an inhibitor of GSK3β that induces strong accumulation of dephosphorylated β-catenin and increased activity of the synthetic Tcf-dependent luciferase reporter TOPFLASH (7Staal F.J. van Noort M. Strous G.J. Clevers H.C. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 63-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). In our experiments, IL-8 mRNA was induced at 24 h of LiCl treatment, when the levels of β-catenin were increased markedly, whereas IL-8 protein was detectable at 48 h, strongly suggesting direct activation of IL-8 expression by β-catenin (Fig. 2). By contrast, we repeatedly failed to detect any change in IL-8 mRNA levels after transduction of β-catenin into primary human fibroblasts, although efficient expression of β-catenin from the pTRIP vector in these cells was verified by Northern blotting (data not shown). This suggests that β-catenin-driven induction of IL-8 expression might be dependent on cellular context. The presence of a consensus Tcf/Lef binding motif in the IL-8 promoter (Fig. 3 A) prompted us to examine the effects of β-catenin and Tcf4 expression on IL-8 promoter activity. Two hepatoma cell lines were used, Huh7, in which normal β-catenin is localized to the cell membrane, and HepG2, which exhibits nuclear accumulation of N-terminally deleted β-catenin (17de La Coste A. Romagnolo B. Billuart P. Renard C.A. Buendia M.A. Soubrane O. Fabre M. Chelly J. Beldjord C. Kahn A. Perret C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A 1.4-kb IL-8 promoter-luciferase construct (1400-IL-8-LUC) was transfected into Huh7 and HepG2 cells, along with different β-catenin and Tcf4 expression vectors. In HepG2 cells, transfection of increasing amounts of Tcf4 further stimulated the basal IL-8 promoter activity up to 3-fold, whereas ΔNTcf4 reduced the basal activity up to 9-fold in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3 B). In Huh7 cells, the IL-8 promoter was activated 2-fold by cotransfection with β-catenin, and ΔNTcf4 inhibited β-catenin-driven transactivation (Fig. 3 C). Because interaction of the cAMP-response element-binding protein-binding protein and p300 coactivators with β-catenin has been shown to potent"

Here we show that transformed cells that express constitutively active pp60c-Src (Src) express HIF-1α protein under normoxia, which results in the expression of multiple HIF-1α target genes. We show that this occurrence is due to an enhanced rate of HIF-1α protein synthesis and not due to reduced HIF-1α degradation.

Cell. 2001; 107: 1-3Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that pp60c-Src (Src) mediates the hypoxic induction of VEGF expression (2Mukhopadhyay D. Tsiokas L. Zhou X.M. Foster D. Brugge J.S. Sukhatme V.P. Nature. 1995; 375: 577-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar) and that the expression of v-Src enhances the expression of HIF-1α (3Jiang B.H. Agani F. Passaniti A. Semenza G.L. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 5328-5335PubMed Google Scholar) which, in turn, up-regulates HIF-1 target genes. In view of the presence of activated Src in many malignant tumors, such as colon (4Mao W. Irby R. Coppola D., Fu, L. Wloch M. Turner J., Yu, H. Garcia R. Jove R. Yeatman T.J. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 3083-3090Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), breast (5Verbeek B.S. Vroom T.M.

Linnekin D. Litz J. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4660-4666PubMed Google Scholar) cancers and in light of the observation that many of these tumors also express high levels of HIF-1α protein under normoxia, we examined the proposition that Src up-regulates HIF-1α and explored the molecular mechanism(s) by which Src may affect HIF-1α protein levels. Earlier reports have already pointed to a correlation between HIF-1α expression and Src activity. Studies have revealed hypoxia-induced activation of Src kinases (7Seko Y. Tobe K. Takahashi N. Kaburagi Y. Kadowaki T. Yazaki Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 226: 530-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and increased levels of HIF-1α in v-Src transformed cells (3Jiang B.H. Agani F. Passaniti A. Semenza G.L. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 5328-5335PubMed Google Scholar). It has also been shown that inhibition of c-Src expression by antisense expression reduces VEGF expression (8Ellis L.M. Staley C.A. Liu W. Fleming R.Y. Parikh N.U. Bucana C.D. Gallick G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1052-1057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), although it has been argued that c-Src is not involved in inducing hypoxic-regulated genes (9Gleadle J.M. Ratcliffe P.J. Blood. 1997; 89: 503-509Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The well documented mechanism for HIF-1α regulation is by its stabilization under hypoxia and its rapid degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway under normoxia (10Salceda S. Caro J. J. Biol.

Here we report that HIF-1α protein accumulates due to elevated translation and not due to elevated mRNA levels or extended protein half-life. We show that the Src-induced increase in protein synthesis is not a HIF-1α-specific phenomenon, but is due to a general increase in cap-dependent translation. CSH12 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. HT29 and Saos-2 cells were grown in McCoy-5A medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. All media were supplemented with penicillin and streptomycin. Saos-2 clones containing empty plasmid (pUSE(−), wild type c-Src (pUSE-WT Src), kinase-dead Src (K297R) (pUSE-KD Src) and active Src (Y529F) (pUSE-Active Src) were obtained by transfection of the above constructs (Upstate Biochemistry) into Saos-2 cells using FuGENE 6 (according to the manufacturer's instructions) and selection with 500 μg/ml G418. HeLa cells expressing HA-eIF4E were generated by transfection of HeLa cells with pCDNA-HA-eIF4E (a gift of Dr. Nahum Sonenberg, McGill University) and were grown in the presence of 500 μg/ml G418. PP1, PP2 and PP3 were synthesized by Dr. Aviv Gazit as described (34Schindler T. Sicheri F. Pico A. Gazit A. Levitzki A. Kuriyan J. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 639-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Transient transfections were performed with FuGENE 6 (according to the manufacturer's instructions) or polyethyleneimine (35Xing X. Wang S.C. Xia W. Zou Y. Shao R. Kwong K.Y., Yu, Z. Zhang S. Miller S. Huang L. Hung M.C. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 189-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) Transcription from the HRE was measured using plasmid p-tkp-luc, which contains five HRE sequences (17Zelzer E. Levy Y. Kahana C. Shilo B.Z. Rubinstein M. Cohen B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5085-5094Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Cells were seeded and 24 h later were transfected. Total DNA for transfection was 2.5 μg per well, comprising 1 μg of luciferase reporter constructs, 0.5 μg of β-galactosidase internal control vector and 1 μg of the Src construct, as indicated under “Results.” In the experiments utilizing the Src inhibitor PP1, cells were transfected only with p-tkp-luc and CMV-lac-Z plasmids; 24 h after transfection the medium was replaced with medium containing inhibitor for an additional 24 h, using PP1 concentrations as indicated in the results. In all the experiments cells were lysed 48 h after transfection with reporter lysis buffer (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and luciferase activity was measured and normalized to β-galactosidase activity. The reporter encoding secreted alkaline phosphatase and containing HIF-1α 5′-UTR was constructed by inserting 289 bp of HIF-1α 5′-UTR into plasmid pBKC/S in HindIII andXhoI sites. HIF-1α 5′-UTR was amplified using primers HIFI-5-R: 5′-GGTGAATCGGTCCCCGCGATG-3′ and HIFI-5-F: 5′-GTGCTGCCTCGTCTGAGGGGACA-3′. Cells were washed three times with PBS, then lysed with sample buffer (10% glycerol, 0.2 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 3% SDS) and boiled for 5 min. The whole cell lysate was then subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. The membranes were blocked in TBST (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Triton X-100) containing 5% low fat (1%) milk for 30 min, followed by incubation for 1.5 h with primary antibody (as indicated in the figure legends). Membranes were then washed extensively with TBST, and immunoreactive proteins were detected by incubation with either horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch 1:10000) for detection of monoclonal antibodies or horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-goat IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch 1:10000) for detection of polyclonal antibodies. Proteins were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence. Cells were grown on 10-cm dishes and treated with PP1 for 2 h or 24 h as indicated in the results. RNA was prepared using Trizol reagent (Sigma), and 10 μg of total RNA were denatured and loaded on a 1% agarose gel containing 8% formaldehyde. Following capillary blotting onto a nylon membrane, the RNA was UV-cross-linked (1200 j/m2), and the membrane stained with 0.1% methylene blue to verify equal loading and transfer. The blot was then hybridized overnight at 42 °C with 32P-labeled DNA probe, prepared with the Rediprime kit (Amersham Biosciences). After two washes at 60 °C with 2× SSC, 1% SDS the blot was exposed to a MS-sensitive film (Kodak) or a phosphorimaging plate (Fuji). 106 (HT29) or 5 × 105 (Saos-2) cells were seeded on 60-mm dishes, and 24 h later 100 μm cycloheximide was added for the length of time indicated in the results. Cells were then lysed with sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. The blots were probed with anti-HIF-1α (1:250 Transduction Laboratories), anti-actin (1:2000 Santa Cruz), and anti-c-Src (mAb 327) antibodies as indicated in the figure legends. 4 × 105 (HT29) and 2 × 105 (Saos-2) cells were seeded on 6-well plates and 24 h later were treated with PP1 (20 μm), PP2 (20 μm), PP3 (20 μm), LY294002 (20 μm, Calbiochem), PD98059 (50 μm,Calbiochem) wortmannin (200 nm, Sigma), and rapamycin (50 nm, Calbiochem) for 30 min. The medium was then replaced with medium containing ALLN (200 μm, Calbiochem) as well as the inhibitors mentioned above for an additional 2 h. Cells were then lysed with sample buffer. For labeling of HA-HIF-1α, CSH12 cells were grown on 10-cm dishes (1 × 106 cells/dish) and were transfected with 0.5 μg of HA-HIF-1α expression plasmid, together with 5 μg of pUSE(−), (Upstate Biochemistry) using FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 24 h later cells were starved for methionine and cysteine for 1 h in the presence of the inhibitors indicated. Cells were then labeled with [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine Promix (Amersham Biosciences), 100 μCi/ml for 45 min in the presence of 200 μm ALLN and the inhibitors. Cells were then washed with PBS and lysed with RIPA buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 125 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 5 mm NaF, 100 μm NaVO3, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin and 5 μg/ml leupeptin). After Bradford protein quantification, HA-HIF-1α was immunoprecipitated from lysates containing 0.8 mg of total protein, using anti-HA antibody mAb 12CA5 produced from hybridoma cells or Rat mAb 3F10 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). 40 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads (AmershamBiosciences) per sample were incubated with the anti-HA antibodies for 1.5 h and after washes were incubated with lysates for 2 h. After additional washes the beads were mixed with 2× sample buffer and boiled for 5 min. After Western blotting and blocking, membranes were exposed to a phosphorimaging device (Fuji) or to film. For detection of HA-HIF-1α protein levels, membranes were probed with anti-HIF-1α antibody (Transduction Laboratories). For labeling of total protein, Saos-2 cells (3 × 105 cells/well) and HT29 cells (5 × 105 cells/well) were seeded on six-well plates (Nunc). 24 h later, cells were washed with PBS, and the medium was replaced with methionine- and cysteine-deficient medium containing the indicated inhibitors for 1 h. Medium was then replaced with medium containing 50 μCi/ml [35S]Met/Cys Promix (AmershamBiosciences) and the indicated inhibitors. Cells were labeled for 10 min at 37 °C. Cells were then washed with PBS and lysed with sample buffer. Identical amounts of protein from the lysates of Saos-2 cells were run on 10% SDS-PAGE and exposed to film. To measure synthesis rates, lysates were loaded on Whatman No. 3MM paper squares. Paper squares were stained with Coomassie, and washed five times for 6 min with destain solution (20% methanol 7% acetic acid). Then the paper squares were dried, and radioactivity was counted with scintillation solution in a β-counter. In parallel, in another set of same samples, staining extracted from papers with 3% SDS and protein amounts were determined using a bovine serum albumin calibration curve, reading the absorbance at 590 nm. In the cell line CSH12 (NIH3T3 overexpressing the chimeric receptor, EGFR-HER-2 (13Lee J. Dull T.J. Lax I. Schlessinger J. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar)) Src is constitutively active (14Osherov N. Levitzki A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 1047-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). We found that hypoxia-regulated genes such as PGK-1 and VEGF were more highly expressed under normoxia in CSH12 than in parental NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 1 A). We also observed high levels of expression of these genes in cancer cell lines such as the colon cancer cell line HT29 (Fig. 1 B) (15Li S., Ke, S. Budde R.J. Cell Biol. Int. 1996; 20: 723-729PubMed Google Scholar), and Saos-2 cells (data not shown), that possess high Src activity. Inhibition of Src kinase activity by the Src family kinase inhibitor, PP1 (16Hanke J.H. Gardner J.P. Dow R.L. Changelian P.S. Brissette W.H. Weringer E.J. Pollok B.A. Connelly P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 695-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1790) Google Scholar), resulted in a dose-dependent reduction in the mRNA levels of these hypoxia-regulated genes (Fig. 1 B). The mRNA levels of HIF-1α, the transcription factor that regulates the expression of these genes, remained unchanged upon PP1 treatment (Fig. 1 B). To further investigate the regulation of hypoxia-regulated gene by Src, we utilized a luciferase reporter-gene driven by a minimal promoter including five HIF-1-responsive elements (HRE) derived from the erythropoietin promoter (17Zelzer E. Levy Y. Kahana C. Shilo B.Z. Rubinstein M. Cohen B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5085-5094Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). We found that the Src kinase inhibitor, PP1, inhibited the expression of the luciferase gene in HT29 and CSH12 cells (Fig. 1, C and E). When activated Src (Y529F) or wild type c-Src were co-transfected with the reporter, expression of the luciferase gene was induced under normoxic conditions, whereas kinase-dead (KD) Src (K297R) inhibited its expression (Fig. 1, D and F). Because the effect of the Src kinase inhibitor, PP1, may not be absolutely selective, we examined the effect of c-Src mutants on HIF-1α expression. We examined the levels of HIF-1α expression in Saos-2 cells stably expressing activated Src, wild type Src, or KD Src. As shown in Fig. 2 A, Saos-2 cells expressing activated or overexpressing wild type Src robustly express high HIF-1α protein levels as compared with cells expressing empty plasmid or KD Src. Differences in protein levels were not due to different mRNA levels since they remained constant (Fig.2 B). The established mechanisms for HIF-1α regulation are stabilization under hypoxia and degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway under normoxia (10Salceda S. Caro J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22642-22647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1417) Google Scholar). We therefore compared the half-life of HIF-1α protein in Saos-2 cells expressing the various forms of Src and in the presence or absence of Src inhibitor PP1 in HT29 cells. As shown in Fig. 2, C and D, the half-life of HIF-1α is similar in all clones and in the presence or absence of PP1 and is very short (t 1/2 ∼5 min), confirming earlier findings (11Maxwell P.H. Wiesener M.S. Chang G.W. Clifford S.C. Vaux E.C. Cockman M.E. Wykoff C.C. Pugh C.W. Maher E.R. Ratcliffe P.J. Nature. 1999; 399: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (4179) Google Scholar). To further investigate whether Src kinase inhibition affects HIF-1α degradation or synthesis and to examine the contribution of the Ras/MAPK and the PI3K/mTOR pathways downstream of Src, we blocked the proteasomal degradation of HIF-1α in HT29 cells using the proteasome inhibitors PI-1 or ALLN (Fig.3 A). Inhibition of the proteasome degradative pathway resulted in the accumulation of the HIF-1α protein. This accumulation was completely blocked in the presence of PP1. HIF-1α accumulation was prevented also by the MEK1 inhibitor PD98059, the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 and wortmannin, and to a lesser degree by the inhibitor of mTOR, rapamycin, in Saos-2 cells (Fig. 3, B and C). PP2, a Src kinase inhibitor that is very similar to PP1, inhibited the accumulation of HIF-1α in a similar fashion to PP1, while PP3, that is similar in structure but does not inhibit Src kinases (18Sanna P.P. Berton F. Cammalleri M. Tallent M.K. Siggins G.R. Bloom F.E. Francesconi W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8653-8657Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), did not prevent HIF-1α accumulation (Fig. 3 C). These results suggest that Src signaling is required to up-regulate HIF-1α protein synthesis in a manner independent of protein stabilization. In corroboration of these findings we observed that the accumulation of HA-HIF-1α in the presence of proteasome inhibitors in CSH12 cells was also blocked by co-transfected KD Src, but not by WT Src, active Src, or empty plasmid (Fig. 3 D). Because Src did not affect the mRNA levels or the half-life of HIF-1α, (Figs. 1 and 2), although inhibition of Src by PP1 or KD Src blocked the accumulation of HIF-1α, we concluded that Src affected the synthesis of HIF-1α. We next measured the incorporation of [35S]methionine into transfected HA-HIF-1α in CSH12 cells. We found that PP1 and LY294002 had strong inhibitory effects, whereas PD98059 had no effect on HIF-1α synthesis in CSH12 cells (Fig. 4 A). Because both the PI3K pathway and the ERK pathway are involved in cap-dependent translation initiation (19Gingras A.C. Raught B. Sonenberg N. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 807-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (1188) Google Scholar, 20Gingras A.C. Gygi S.P. Raught B. Polakiewicz R.D. Abraham R.T. Hoekstra M.F. Aebersold R. Sonenberg N. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1422-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (1017) Google Scholar, 21Raught B. Gingras A.C. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 43-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) and both are downstream to activated Src, we examined the effects of active Src, KD Src, and PP1 on cap-dependent translation initiation activity. We utilized a bi-cistronic construct composed of a luciferase reporter gene followed by an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) sequence with secreted alkaline phosphatase (SeAP) as a reporter (Fig.4 B). We measured effects on luciferase activity (cap-dependent translation) relative to effects on SeAP activity (IRES-dependent translation). We found that active Src increased cap-dependent translation, whereas kinase-dead Src and PP1 inhibited cap-dependent translation (Fig. 4 B). The two reporter genes were also co-transfected as mono-cistronic constructs, namely as single reporters subject to cap-dependent initiation (Fig. 4 B). Active Src and KD Src affected the cap-SeAP and cap-luc in a similar fashion, thus the ratio of luc to SeAP activities remained the same (Fig.4 B), confirming that the effects of Src constructs on translation initiation were independent of the nature of the reporter used. Because it was asserted recently that the 5′-untranslated region (5′-UTR) of HIF-1α affects its synthesis (22Laughner E. Taghavi P. Chiles K. Mahon P.C. Semenza G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3995-4004Crossref PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar), we cloned the 5′-UTR of HIF-1α (+1 to +284) upstream of the SeAP reporter gene and measured the effects of Src on the reporter activity, as depicted in Fig. 4 C. We found no significant effect on the reporter activity by the different Src constructs. To examine whether the Src effect on protein synthesis is HIF-1α-specific or whether it affects global protein synthesis, we measured the incorporation of [35S]methionine into Saos-2 and HT29 cells in the absence or presence of Src kinase inhibitors and inhibitors of its downstream signaling pathways. PP1 and PP2 inhibited protein synthesis in Saos-2 and HT29 cells, while PP3, which is similar in structure but does not inhibit Src (18Sanna P.P. Berton F. Cammalleri M. Tallent M.K. Siggins G.R. Bloom F.E. Francesconi W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8653-8657Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), did not (Fig. 5,A and B). Inhibition of PI3K by LY294002 and wortmannin or inhibition of its downstream target mTOR by rapamycin also inhibited protein synthesis, and so did the MEK1 inhibitor PD98059. Because the availability of the cap-binding protein eIF4E is the rate-limiting step in the machinery of cap-dependent translation (23Gingras A.C. Raught B. Sonenberg N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 913-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (1766) Google Scholar), we expressed eIF4E in HeLa cells and examined its effect on the levels of HIF-1α protein. As seen in Fig.5 C, expression of eIF4E elevated the levels of HIF-1α. One of the hallmarks of advanced human tumors is their capacity to conduct efficient glycolysis in the presence of oxygen, nullifying the Pasteur effect and converting pyruvate to lactate by means of lactate dehydrogenase A (24Dang C.V. Semenza G.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 68-72Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar, 25Seagroves T.N. Ryan H.E., Lu, H. Wouters B.G. Knapp M. Thibault P. Laderoute K. Johnson R.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3436-3444Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar), which is under the transcriptional control of HIF-1α. We show that lactate accumulation was markedly reduced in the presence of Src, PI3K, MEK1, and mTOR inhibitors (PP1, LY294002, PD98059, and rapamycin, respectively), and 100 μm cycloheximide (Fig.6 A). Moreover, the rate of production of lactic acid was higher in CSH12 than in parental NIH3T3 cells, which most probably reflects the differences in glycolytic enzyme mRNA levels (Fig. 1 A). Expression of several oncogenes has previously been found to increase activation of the HIF-1α pathway, but no molecular mechanism has been reported. H-Ras transformation has been reported to increase the level of HIF-1α protein and to induce expression of HIF-1α target genes in both normoxia and hypoxia via PI3K (26Mazure N.M. Chen E.Y. Laderoute K.R. Giaccia A.J. Blood. 1997; 90: 3322-3331Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Chen C. Pore N. Behrooz A. Ismail-Beigi F. Maity A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9519-9525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). Similarly, expression of v-Src increases HIF-1α protein levels and target gene activation. It has been claimed that the effect of v-Src is transcriptional, thus involving the increase in HIF-1α mRNA (3Jiang B.H. Agani F. Passaniti A. Semenza G.L. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 5328-5335PubMed Google Scholar). p42/p44 mitogen-activated protein kinase (ErkMAPK) has been implicated in HIF-1α phosphorylation, and activation of ErkMAPK has been shown to promote transcriptional activation by HIF-1α (28Conrad P.W. Freeman T.L. Beitner-Johnson D. Millhorn D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33709-33713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 29Richard D.E. Berra E. Gothie E. Roux D. Pouyssegur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32631-32637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). In these studies, as in our own (Figs.2 and 3), the activation of HIF-1α did not appear to involve increased protein stability. We find that active Src induces the synthesis of the HIF-1α protein (Fig. 4) and as a consequence, of its target genes (Fig. 1), with no effect on HIF-1α mRNA levels (Figs. 1 and 2). In this study we show that the elevated levels of HIF-1α under normoxia, in cells which possess persistently active Src, results from enhanced cap-dependent protein translation (Fig.4 B and Fig. 5), mediated by the PI3K-mTOR pathway and, depending on the cell line, also by the ErkMAPK pathway (Figs. Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5). It is likely that HIF-1α expression is up-regulated by a similar mechanism in other tissues where the activity of protein tyrosine kinases other than Src are enhanced (17Zelzer E. Levy Y. Kahana C. Shilo B.Z. Rubinstein M. Cohen B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5085-5094Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar, 22Laughner E. Taghavi P. Chiles K. Mahon P.C. Semenza G.L. Mol. Cell.

Thus, the elevation in the protein level of HIF-1α that occurs at normal oxygen levels is the outcome of an elevated rate of global protein synthesis rather than reduced rates of HIF-1α degradation (Figs.Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5). Interestingly, 23 years ago Carroll et al. (32Carroll R.C. Ash J.F. Vogt P.K. Singer S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 5015-5019Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) demonstrated that in chicken cells infected with temperature-sensitive v-Src, the v-Src induces aerobic glycolysis (the “Warburg effect”) at permissive temperatures, while the cells revert to normal metabolism upon shift to the non-permissive temperatures. Our study provides a biochemical mechanism for this classic observation. Moreover, inhibition of protein synthesis in chicken cells resulted in the reversal of the Warburg effect in a fashion similar to our study, which shows that inhibition of Src activity or inhibition of protein synthesis leads to reduced lactate production (Fig.6 A). Taken together, our results suggest that Src activation brings about the up-regulation of cap-dependent translation, dramatically affecting the level of HIF-1α. The translational control of HIF-1α was also implicated in a recent study by Laughner et al. (22Laughner E. Taghavi P. Chiles K. Mahon P.C. Semenza G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3995-4004Crossref PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar) who offered a different molecular explanation. These authors showed that HER-2/neu activation elevates HIF-1α levels by enhancing HIF-1α translation through the PI3K-PKB-mTOR pathway. Laughner et al. claimed that the enhancement was HIF-1α-specific and was achieved through the structure of the 5′-UTR of HIF-1α mRNA (22Laughner E. Taghavi P. Chiles K. Mahon P.C. Semenza G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3995-4004Crossref PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar). The discrepancy between our study and the study of Laughner et al. may be due to different experimental conditions. The exogenous Heregulin added by Laughneret al. might have affected other signaling pathways. In that study Src activity was not measured. We expressed Src mutants in cells and thus measured only the direct effect of Src. We also used a slightly different 5′-UTR sequence (containing only the 5′-UTR from +1 to +284 without any sequence from the promoter of HIF-1α), which could lead to differences in the response of the reporter. Our experiments clearly show that the HIF-1α 5′-UTR is not involved in the enhancement of translation by Src (Fig. 4 C) and that the enhancement of HIF-1α translation results from Src-induced up-regulation of the cap-dependent translational machinery (Figs. 4 B and Fig. 5). In support of this assertion, we show that the expression of the central component of the cap-dependent translation machinery, namely the cap-binding protein eIF4E, elevated the levels of HIF-1α in HeLa cells (Fig.5 C). Moreover, as seen in Fig. 5, A andB, inhibition of Src kinase and its downstream pathways (i.e. PI3K-mTOR and MEK1-ERK) resulted in the inhibition of total protein synthesis in Saos-2 and HT29 cells. Furthermore, Src activity affects levels and synthesis of other short-lived proteins by the same mechanism as for HIF-1α. 2R. Karni, Y. Dor, E. Keshet, O. Meyuhas, and A. Levitzki, manuscript in preparation. Our results also provide a biochemical mechanism for the similar HIF-1α up-regulation by other PTKs (17Zelzer E. Levy Y. Kahana C. Shilo B.Z. Rubinstein M. Cohen B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5085-5094Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar, 22Laughner E. Taghavi P. Chiles K. Mahon P.C. Semenza G.L. Mol. Cell.

In summary, we suggest that the enhanced translation of HIF-1α should lead to a metabolic shift to aerobic glycolysis (Fig. 6 B) (25Seagroves T.N. Ryan H.E., Lu, H. Wouters B.G. Knapp M. Thibault P. Laderoute K. Johnson R.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3436-3444Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism we describe most probably accounts for the strong expression of HIF-1α in many advanced tumors under normoxia (33Zhong H., De Marzo A.M. Laughner E. Lim M. Hilton D.A. Zagzag D. Buechler P. Isaacs W.B. Semenza G.L. Simons J.W. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5830-5835PubMed Google Scholar) and leads to the onset of the Warburg effect, which is a hallmark of advanced cancers (Fig. 6 B).

Genetic and biochemical approaches have led to the discovery of multiple protein complexes that are thought to activate or repress transcription by targeting histones or nucleosomes (reviewed in Refs. 1Muchardt C.

A recent explosion of research in yeast, fruit flies, and mammals has uncovered at least two classes of complexes, those that enzymatically modify histones and those that remodel nucleosomes in an ATP- dependent manner. Cells contain multiple distinct chromatin remodeling complexes, each of which includes a central ATPase subunit. The yeast SWI/SNF complex was the first such complex characterized (reviewed in Refs. 6Winston F. Carlson M. Trends Genet. 1992; 8: 387-391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar and 7Peterson C.L. Workman J.L. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Homologous complexes have since been identified in Drosophila and mammals (8Varga-Weisz P.D. Becker P.B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 346-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). At least two distinct ATPase subunits, termed hBRM and BRG1, have been identified in mammalian SWI/SNF- related complexes and are homologous to the yeast SWI2/SNF2 and Drosophila Brahma (Brm) proteins (9Tamkun J.W.

Mammalian cells appear to contain multiple SWI/SNF-related complexes (13Kwon H. Imbalzano A.N. Khavari P.A. Kingston R.E. Green M.R. Nature. 1994; 370: 477-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar) and immunoprecipitation experiments using antibodies specific for hBRM or BRG1 suggest that these subunits are present in distinct complexes (14Wang W. Cote J. Xue Y. Zhou S. Khavari P.A. Biggar S.R. Muchardt C. Kalpana G.V. Goff S.P. Yaniv M. Workman J.L. Crabtree G.R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5370-5382Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar, 15Sif S. Saurin A.J. Imbalzano A.N. Kingston R.E. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 603-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Purification and characterization of these separate complexes demonstrate differences in activity and subunit composition, implying distinct regulatory roles (15Sif S. Saurin A.J. Imbalzano A.N. Kingston R.E. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 603-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 16Lemon B. Inouye C. King D.S. Tjian R. Nature. 2001; 414: 924-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Indeed, recent in vitro transcription studies have shown that PBAF (SWI/SNF-B) is selectively required for activated transcription from target genes in the context of chromatin, whereas human SWI/SNF-A and ACF failed to activate transcription from the same templates (16Lemon B. Inouye C. King D.S. Tjian R. Nature. 2001; 414: 924-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Consistent with the notion that each complex confers unique gene regulatory activity, targeted disruption of the Brg1 gene in the mouse resulted in homozygotes that died during the preimplantation stage, whereas Brm mutant homozygotes were viable and fertile (17Bultman S.

Taken together, these results suggest that different chromatin remodeling complexes have distinct functions during mammalian development. Many studies have focused on the mechanisms by which the SWI/SNF-related complexes alter nucleosomes, as well as how the complexes are targeted to specific genes for remodeling. Biochemical changes in the nucleosomes that occur during remodeling have provided mechanistic insights into the functions of SWI/SNF-related complexes (reviewed in Refs. 5Narlikar G.J. Fan H.Y. Kingston R.E. Cell. 2002; 108: 475-487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1256) Google Scholar and 7Peterson C.L. Workman J.L. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Studies suggest that these complexes reposition nucleosomes by sliding of the DNA or triggering conformational changes in the nucleosomes to expose DNA. In certain promoter contexts, SWI/SNF may be recruited directly by gene-specific transcriptional regulators. This is supported by the findings that some activators interact functionally and physically with SWI/SNF complexes (19Natarajan K. Jackson B.M. Zhou H. Winston F. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol.

Zak N.B. Verrijzer C.P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1058-1071PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, recruitment of SWI/SNF to the HOendonuclease promoter in vivo requires binding of the site-specific SWI5 activator (24Cosma M.P. Tanaka T. Nasmyth K. Cell. 1999; 97: 299-311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar, 25Krebs J.E. Kuo M.H. Allis C.D. Peterson C.L. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1412-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). At least two SWI/SNF subunits possess a DNA binding domain: the ARID domain (AT-rich interactingdomain) present in yeast SWI1 and Drosophila Osa (26Kortschak R.D. Tucker P.W. Saint R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 294-299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), and the HMG domain in BAF57, a subunit unique to metazoans (27Wang W. Chi T. Xue Y. Zhou S. Kuo A. Crabtree G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 492-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Whether these DNA binding domains play a direct role in chromatin remodeling or in the recruitment of SWI/SNF to specific genes remains to be established. We previously reported that the protein product of theDrosophila gene osa (28Treisman J.E. Luk A. Rubin G.M. Heberlein U. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1949-1962Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) is a homologue of yeast SWI1 and component of the Drosophila Brahma (SWI/SNF) complex (29Collins R.T. Furukawa T. Tanese N. Treisman J.E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 7029-7040Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Osa is required for proper photoreceptor differentiation and embryonic segmentation in Drosophila, and it is thought to function as a transcription factor that antagonizes the Wingless signaling pathway (28Treisman J.E. Luk A. Rubin G.M. Heberlein U. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1949-1962Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). osa was previously identified in a screen for the trithorax (trx) group of genes required for the expression of Drosophila homeotic genes (30Vazquez M. Moore L. Kennison J.A. Development. 1999; 126: 733-742Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Osa has been shown to regulate the expression of theAntennapedia gene and to interact genetically withbrahma (brm). Osa possesses an ARID DNA binding domain found in yeast SWI1 and shared by many other transcription factors (26Kortschak R.D. Tucker P.W. Saint R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 294-299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 31Gregory S.L. Kortschak R.D. Kalionis B. Saint R. Mol. Cell.

Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 3067-3082Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). It is possible that Osa binds to AT-rich regions of DNA to help target the Brahma complex; however, the ARID domain of Osa appears to bind DNA without sequence specificity (29Collins R.T. Furukawa T. Tanese N. Treisman J.E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 7029-7040Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). To identify the human homologues of Osa, we used defined probes from two related but distinct human EST sequences homologous to osa (28Treisman J.E. Luk A. Rubin G.M. Heberlein U. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1949-1962Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and isolated cDNA clones encoding two human proteins we named human hOsa1 and hOsa2. We found that both hOsa proteins stimulate transcriptional activation by the steroid hormone receptors glucocorticoid receptor (GR),1 estrogen receptor (ER), and androgen receptor (AR). HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone), l-glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin and cultured in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2. HeLa Tet-Off cells (Clontech) were grown in medium containing 30 ng/ml doxycycline. To induce the expression of tetracycline-regulated constructs, doxycycline was removed from the medium. T47D and C33A cells were maintained using the same conditions as described above. The cytomegalovirus enhancer/promoter constructs expressing rat GR, human ER, and AR as well as the luciferase reporter plasmids were gifts of M. Garabedian (NYU School of Medicine). Human BRG1 and hBRM constructs in a cytomegalovirus expression vector were gifts of S. Goff (Columbia University). The plasmid encoding KIAA1235 (GenBankTM accession number AB033061) was a gift of T. Nagase (Kazusa DNA Research Institute). hOsa derivatives were subcloned into a cytomegalovirus-based mammalian expression construct, pCGT, that added a T7 epitope tag at the N terminus (33Wilson A.C. Freiman R.N. Goto H. Nishimoto T. Herr W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6139-6146Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) (a gift of A. Wilson, NYU School of Medicine) or subcloned into pcDNA (Invitrogen) that added an HA epitope tag at the N terminus. The NTera2D1 line of human teratocarcinoma cDNA library (34Skowronski J. Fanning T.G. Singer M.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 1385-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar) was screened with EST clones M85358 and AA243104 encoding a portion of hOsa1 and hOsa2, respectively. Fragments derived from the 5′-end of the initial cDNA isolate were used to extend the 5′-end of hOsa2. To isolate hOsa2 cDNA fragments contiguous with clone 18A and 16e, two sets of primers were used in PCRs using a cDNA library from human liver (Clontech). The first reaction used primer 18A F1 (5′-GGCATGGGCTTGGGCAA-3′) and 16e R1 (5′-ATGCTGGAGAGATGAGG-3′), and the second reaction used primer 18A F2 (5′-GGCAAGGACAGATGAGG-3′) and 16e R2 (5′-GTTGCTCTGATCCCCTT-3′). The 5′-end primers were derived from 18A-specific sequence, and the 3′-end primers were derived from regions specific to 16e. Fragments of expected size and sequence were obtained from these reactions, confirming the presence of hOsa2 cDNA containing the sequence of both 18A and 16e. Human multiple tissue and cancer cell line Northern blots (CLONTECH) were probed with a 400-bp fragment from the 5′-end of hOsa1 and three separate fragments corresponding to the 18A-specific region, a region overlapping between 18A and 16e, and the 16e/4AT-specific region of hOsa2. 18A-specific P1 probe was created by PCR using primers 18A-5 (5′-CCGACATGGAGCAGCCG-3′) and 18A-3 (5′-TGTAGCCCGGATAATGG-3′). AnEcoRI-BglII fragment of 16e was used as the P3 probe for the overlapping region, and anEcoRI-BamHI fragment of 4AT was used as the P5 probe for the 16e/4AT-specific region of hOsa2. Probes used for BRG1 and hBRM were 540- and 550-bp fragment, respectively, derived from the 5′-end of the coding sequence. The blot was stripped and exposed to film between hybridization with different probes. DNA fragments generated by PCR using primers that introduced a BamHI site at the 5′-end and a stop codon followed by an EcoRI site at the 3′-end were subcloned into pGEX2T (Amersham Biosciences) and pRSET-A (Invitrogen), digested with BamHI and EcoRI to create GST and polyhistidine-tagged fusions, respectively. hOsa1 DNA was amplified with 5′-primer (5′-GGATCCGTGAGGACGGAGCCTGGAA-3′) and 3′-primer (5′-GAATTC ACATGTTTTGCTGGGCATTGGT-3′), where introduced restriction sites are underlined and the stop codon indicated in boldface type. To amplify the corresponding region of hOsa2 DNA, 5′ primer (5′-GGATCCAGGCATGAACCTTATGGGCA-3′) and 3′-primer (5′-GAATTC AGATTCCGTGTGTCTGGATCT-3′) were used. The GST fusion proteins expressed in Escherichia coli were purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B resin (AmershamBiosciences) and injected into rabbits for polyclonal antibody production (Cocalico Biologicals, Inc.). The same DNA fragment of hOsa1 and hOsa2 subcloned into pRSET-A vector was used to produce polyhistidine- and T7-tagged fusion proteins in E. coli. The crude and purified antisera were tested for reactivity using the polyhistidine-tagged fusion protein. To eliminate the antibodies against GST and those that potentially cross-reacted with hOsa2, the antiserum raised against GST-hOsa1 was first incubated with GST immobilized on a resin followed by a resin cross-linked with GST-hOsa2. Similar treatments were carried out with the antiserum raised against hOsa2. In some cases, antibodies were affinity-purified using resins with the cross-linked antigen. Purification of SWI/SNF and PBAF from HeLa nuclear extract was described (16Lemon B. Inouye C. King D.S. Tjian R. Nature. 2001; 414: 924-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), and mass spectrometry was performed as described (16Lemon B. Inouye C. King D.S. Tjian R. Nature. 2001; 414: 924-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). C33A cells grown to 70–80% confluence in 100-mm plates were transfected with 10 μg each of plasmid DNA by the calcium phosphate precipitation method. Mininuclear extracts were prepared as described (35Lee K.A. Bindereif A. Green M.R. Gene Anal. Techn. 1988; 5: 22-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar), and immunoprecipitations were carried out with α-HA (Babco), α-T7 (Novagen), α-hBRM (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), or α-BRG1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibody. Immunoprecipitated products were separated by SDS-PAGE, subjected to immunoblotting with the indicated antibody, and detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). GST fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli strain BL21LysS and purified from cell lysates using glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) in HEMG buffer (25 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.9), 0.1 mm EDTA, 12.5 mm MgCl2, 20% glycerol) containing 0.1m KCl and 0.1% Nonidet P-40. Approximately 1 μg of purified recombinant GST protein was used in each binding reaction.In vitro translated [35S]methionine-labeled proteins were synthesized using the TNT-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) as per the manufacturer's instructions. DNA fragments for in vitro translation were generated by PCR with a 5′ primer that included a T7 RNA polymerase promoter and rabbit β-globin translation initiation sequence as described (33Wilson A.C. Freiman R.N. Goto H. Nishimoto T. Herr W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6139-6146Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). 7.5 μl of radiolabeled reticulocyte lysate was added to each binding reaction in 75 μl of HEMG buffer containing 0.1 m KCl and 0.1% Nonidet P-40. Binding reactions were performed at 4 °C for 2–3 h with nutation. After five 1-ml washes with the same buffer, 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer was added, and bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by autoradiography. T47D cells seeded at a density of 7 × 105 cells/35-mm plate were transfected the next day using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Invitrogen). Typically, 0.1 μg of RSV-lacZ plasmid and 0.05 μg of luciferase reporter plasmid (XG46TL (36Rogatsky I. Hittelman A.B. Pearce D. Garabedian M.J. Mol. Cell.

Appropriate ligand at the indicated final concentration was added 24 h following transfection (100 nm dexamethasone, 100 nm 17β-estradiol, or 10 nm R1881), and the cells were lysed after 20 h by the addition of lysis buffer (Promega). Luciferase assays were carried out as described using a Lumat LB 9509 luminometer (EG&G Berthold) (38Saluja D. Vassallo M.F. Tanese N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5734-5743Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Data shown are from a representative experiment carried out a minimum of three times. We isolated cDNA clones for hOsa1 and hOsa2 from the NTera2D1 human teratocarcinoma cDNA library (34Skowronski J. Fanning T.G. Singer M.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 1385-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar) utilizing human EST clones with sequence similarity to Drosophila osa (28Treisman J.E. Luk A. Rubin G.M. Heberlein U. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1949-1962Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Comparison of the published Drosophila Osa (28Treisman J.E. Luk A. Rubin G.M. Heberlein U. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1949-1962Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and the predicted human hOsa1 and hOsa2 amino acid sequence revealed three highly conserved regions: the ARID DNA binding domain and homology regions I and II (Fig. 1, A andB). There is 48% amino acid identity between Drosophila and human Osa in these regions, whereas sequences flanking the conserved regions are quite dissimilar. hOsa1 and hOsa2 proteins are ∼60% identical. hOsa1 is nearly identical but 286 residues shorter than the recently reported BAF250 (39Nie Z. Xue Y. Yang D. Zhou S. Deroo B.J. Archer T.K. Wang W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8879-8888Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). This difference is reflected by immunoblot experiments that compare recombinant hOsa1 with the endogenous hOsa1 protein (Fig.3 B). Previously reported p270 is a partial clone of BAF250/hOsa1 (40Dallas P.B. Cheney I.W. Liao D.W. Bowrin V. Byam W. Pacchione S. Kobayashi R. Yaciuk P. Moran E. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 2000; 20: 3137-3146Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), and a partial human cDNA sequence representing a spliced form of BAF250/hOsa1 has also been reported (42Kozmik Z. Machon O. Kralova J. Kreslova J. Paces J. Vlcek C. Genomics. 2001; 73: 140-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar).Figure 1Comparison of hOsa1 and hOsa2 cDNAs. A, an alignment of the amino acid sequences predicted from the cDNA clones isolated for hOsa1 (1999 residues) and hOsa2 (clone 16e+18A; 2165 residues). The BestFit program of the SeqWeb sequence analysis software and the ClustalW sequence analysis program of MacVector were used. Identical residues (vertical bars) and similar residues (represented by one or two dots) were determined by the criteria of Henikoff and Henikoff (50Henikoff S. Henikoff J.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10915-10919Crossref PubMed Scopus (4363) Google Scholar). For hOsa2, the additional 98 amino acids at the N terminus predicted from the contiguous sequences deposited in GenBankTM data base are indicated initalic type (schematically shown inC). Within this N-terminal extension, three methionines areunderlined. The first methionine is in-frame with an upstream stop codon; however, the DNA sequences surrounding the second and third methionine show better fit with the consensus translational start sequence (51Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 857-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (2383) Google Scholar). hOsa2 also contains a portion of the previously reported KIAA1235 sequence (AB033061) with the exception of 53 amino acids present in KIAA1235 but missing from hOsa2 (indicated by a triangle after lysine 961 of hOsa2). hOsa1 isolated in this study is nearly identical to previously reported p270 (AF265208) and BAF250 (AF231056). Although hOsa1 extends the predicted amino acid sequence reported for p270, it lacks the N-terminal 286 residues reported for BAF250. Within these N-terminal residues (thin underline in the figure) lie two blocks of sequence similarity with the predicted N terminus of hOsa2. hOsa1 and hOsa2 sequences are divergent in the N terminus; however, six linear blocks of sequence similarity are evident (see boxed residues and schematic in B). The entire cDNA sequence of hOsa1 differs in several places with that reported for BAF250 but agrees with overlapping p270 sequences. Nearly three-quarters of hOsa1 and hOsa2 show sequence similarity (boxed); present within these sequences are those that are homologous with the Drosophila Osa protein (indicated by athick underline). They correspond to ARID, homology region I, and homology region II (shown schematically inB). Seven LXXLL motifs, many of which are conserved between the two hOsa isoforms, are indicated by anasterisk. Of these, motifs 1, 2, 5, and 6 are also conserved between human and fly proteins. 10 proline-tyrosine dipeptide sequences were found within less than 200 residues of the glutamine-rich N-terminal region of hOsa1 (two were found in hOsa2, indicated inboldface type). B, a schematic comparison of hOsa1, hOsa2, and Drosophila Osa(Eld) (AF053091). ARID homology regions I and II that are conserved among the three proteins are indicated. Additional sequences conserved between hOsa1 and hOsa2 corresponding to the boxed regions in A are shaded. Numerical ratios represent percentage of identity/percentage of similarity within defined DNA segments according to the sequence analysis software. The EST sequence used for the initial screening of the cDNA library is indicated by a thick bar (GenBankTMnumber M85358 for hOsa1 and number AA243104 for hOsa2). The N-terminal 98 residues predicted from contiguous sequences in the data base are represented as a dotted box in hOsa2. The N-terminal 286 residues of BAF250 lacking in hOsa1 are shown as thedotted N-terminal extension of hOsa1. The sequences of hOsa1 and hOsa2 used as polypeptide antigens to raise hOsa-specific antibodies are indicated by a thick bar labeledAb. Clones 16e and 4AT of hOsa2 encode the C-terminal 1747 residues (419–2165) and 1250 residues (916–2165), respectively.C, a schematic representation of the cDNA clones isolated for hOsa2. A probe derived from the most 5′-end of the longest hOsa2 cDNA clone 16e resulted in the isolation of clone 18A, which contained 534 identical nucleotides to the 5′-end of clone 16e but differed in the 3′-end, suggesting that the two products could be produced by differential splicing. The C terminus of clone 18A terminates after 10 residues and thus represents a much smaller protein. Although we were unable to isolate cDNA clones containing a sequence contiguous with clone 18A and clone 16e, we have successfully PCR-amplified cDNA fragments that contained both sequences using the indicated primers P2 and P4. Because clone 18A shares sequence similarities with the hOsa1 N terminus, we think that clone 18A represents the N terminus of hOsa2. Our α-hOsa2 antibody detects endogenous proteins of 250 and 210 kDa (Fig. 4); the smaller protein may be encoded by clone 16e. Peptides corresponding to the N-terminal sequences in clone 18A were also identified by mass spectrometry of the 250-kDa band. The 5′-end of clone 18A is identical to the previously reported DAN15 cDNA (52Imbert G. Saudou F. Yvert G. Devys D. Trottier Y. Garnier J.M. Weber C. Mandel J.L. Cancel G. Abbas N. Durr A.

Chem. 1998; 273: 30466-30471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The positions of these sequences with respect to clone 18A are shown. The N-terminal 98 amino acid residues of hOsa2 in A were predicted from the translation of DAN15 cDNA and the open reading frame of Clone E7 (assuming the sequence lies within an exon contiguous with DAN15 cDNA).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 3Endogenous and recombinant hOsa1 and hOsa2 proteins. A, the specificity of antibodies directed against hOsa1 and hOsa2. Polypeptide sequences chosen as antigens to raise antibodies to hOsa1 or hOsa2 were tagged with polyhistidine (His), expressed, and purified from E. coli. Immunoblotting of His:hOsa1 and His:hOsa2 with α-His antibody (left), α-hOsa1 antibody (middle), and α-hOsa2 antibody (right) indicates that the antibody against each form of the hOsa protein is highly specific. The immunoblots shown here were prepared from separate gels; thus, the position of His:hOsa2 differs slightly between lanes 1 and 5. A similar analysis to demonstrate antibody specificity was carried out with recombinant hOsa proteins expressed in mammalian cells (data not shown). B, nuclear extracts were prepared from HeLa Tet-Off cells (Clontech) mock-transfected (lane 1) or transfected with a plasmid expressing the longest cDNA clone encoding hOsa1 tagged with a FLAG tag (lane 2).

https://openalex.org/W1988399136,"We have investigated the role of the BH3-only pro-death Bcl-2 family protein, Bid, in ischemic neuronal death in a murine focal cerebral ischemia model. Wild-type andbid-deficient mice of inbred C57BL/6 background were subjected to 90-min ischemia induced by left middle cerebral artery occlusion followed by 72-h reperfusion. The volume of ischemic infarct was significantly smaller in the bid-deficient brains than in the wild-type brains, suggesting that Bid participated in the ischemic neuronal death. Indeed, following the ischemic treatment there was a significant reduction of apoptosis in the ischemic areas, particularly in the inner infarct border zone (the penumbra), of thebid-deficient brains. In addition, activation of Bid in the wild-type brains could be readily detected at ∼3 h after ischemia, as evidenced by its proteolytic cleavage and translocation to the mitochondria as determined using Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence staining. Correspondingly, mitochondrial release of cytochrome c could be detected around the same time Bid was cleaved in the wild-type brains. However, no significant cytochromec release was detected in the bid-deficient brains until 24 h later. This suggests that, although the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway might be activated by multiple mechanisms during focal cerebral ischemia, Bid is critical to its early activation. This notion was further supported by the finding that caspase-3 activation was severely impaired in thebid-deficient brains, whereas activation of caspase-8 was much less affected. Taken together, these data suggest that Bid is activated early in neuronal ischemia in a caspase-8-dependent fashion and that Bid is perhaps one of the earliest and most potent activators of the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. Thus, the role of Bid in the induction of ischemic neuronal death may render this molecule an attractive target for future therapeutic intervention.

Vascular occlusion or disruption leads to brain ischemia and hypoxia that can result in serious neuronal injury. Although damaged neurons often die from necrosis, a significant amount of neurons may die from apoptosis. Most of the evidence for the role of apoptosis in ischemic neuronal death is obtained with the use of rodent models of global or focal ischemia.The connection between ischemic neuronal death and caspase activity has been well established. Increased levels of either expression or activities of effector caspase-3 can be detected in ischemic neurons (1Chen J. Nagayama T. Jin K. Stetler R.A. Zhu R.L. Graham S.H. Simon R.P. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 4914-4928Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Ni B., Wu, X., Su, Y. Stephenson D. Smalstig E.B. Clemens J. Paul S.M. J. Cereb.

A strong correlation has been found among caspase-3 activity, TUNEL staining, and appearance of apoptotic neurons (1Chen J. Nagayama T. Jin K. Stetler R.A. Zhu R.L. Graham S.H. Simon R.P. J.

Neurosci. 2001; 21: 4678-4690Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, administration of caspase inhibitors during the induction of ischemia suppresses the activity of effector caspases and decreases the number of TUNEL-positive cells and apoptotic bodies (1Chen J.

Simon R.P. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 4914-4928Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).One key question is how the apoptotic cell death mechanism is activated during neuronal ischemia. In non-neuronal systems, two apoptotic pathways have been defined (14Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5112) Google Scholar, 15Green D.R. Reed J.C.

Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1899-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (3238) Google Scholar): the extrinsic pathway, mediated by the death receptor family proteins; and the intrinsic pathway, mediated by the mitochondria. Current evidence suggests that, in neuronal ischemic death, both pathways may be activated.A key step in the intrinsic pathway, mitochondrial release of cytochrome c, has been reported in ischemic neurons after global or focal ischemia (17Fujimura M. Morita-Fujimura Y. Murakami K. Kawase M. Chan P.H. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 1998; 18: 1239-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 18Fujimura M. Morita-Fujimura Y. Kawase M. Copin J.C.

Caspase-9 has been reported to be present in mitochondria and is released concurrently with cytochrome c (19Susin S.A. Lorenzo H.K. Zamzami N. Marzo I. Brenner C. Larochette N. Prevost M.C.

More importantly, focal ischemia-induced infarction is greatly reduced in mice expressing mutated nonfunctional Fas (Faslpr mice) (26Rosenbaum D.M. Gupta G. D'Amore J. Singh M. Weidenheim K. Zhang H.

Correspondingly, the initiator caspase-8 downstream of the death receptor was found to be activated in ischemic neurons (28Velier J.J. Ellison J.A. Kikly K.K. Spera P.A. Barone F.C. Feuerstein G.Z.

The p15 truncated Bid (tBid) is able to translocate to mitochondria and induces cytochrome c release. Bid thus has the capability to communicate death signals from the extrinsic pathway to the intrinsic pathway. The significance of this communication has been demonstrated in a murine model of hepatocyte apoptosis triggered by receptor activation (33Yin X.M. Wang K. Gross A. Zhao Y. Zinkel S. Klocke B.

Bid may accomplish this by relaying death receptor signals to mitochondria, where it induces cytochrome c release, which then activates downstream effector caspases, leading to apoptosis. This hypothesis is tested in the current study. We found that, in a murine focal ischemia model created by middle cerebral artery occlusion, Bid was cleaved and translocated to mitochondria through caspase-8 activation. In the absence of Bid, cytochrome c release in the cortex neurons was reduced and the activation of effector caspase-3 was delayed and reduced. Furthermore, bid-deficient mice demonstrated significant resistance to ischemic neuronal death, as evidenced by minor infarction and reduced apoptosis in the cortex. Thus, our study clearly indicates that Bid is activated and contributes prominently to the development of ischemic neuronal apoptosis.DISCUSSIONMost of the evidence supporting a role of apoptosis in neuronal cell death comes from studies using animal models of global or focal cerebral ischemia. In the focal ischemia models, which create a condition relevant to human stroke, a transient ischemia followed by reperfusion is often associated with massive induction of apoptosis-like cell death (46Du C., Hu, R. Csernansky C.A. Hsu C.Y. Choi D.W. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 1996; 16: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar, 47Snider B.J. Gottron F.J. Choi D.W. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 893: 243-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In the current study, we demonstrated that a pro-death Bcl-2 family protein, Bid, prominently participated in the development of focal ischemic brain injury, whereas deletion of this molecule by gene targeting provided significant neural protection. At the gross level, bid-deficient mice had a 30% reduction in infarct size. Consistent with this gross protection was the reduction in the amounts of apoptotic cells, particularly in the penumbral region, in the ischemic bid-deficient brains. Furthermore, mice deficient in bid showed significantly attenuated cytochrome c release and caspase-3 activation in response to ischemia. Taken together, these results support our hypothesis that Bid is an important mediator of ischemic neuronal death in the brain, which may function to activate the mitochondria apoptosis signaling pathway in degenerating neurons.The marked difference between the bid-deficient mice and their wild-type littermates in susceptibility to ischemic injury is likely attributable to the deletion of the Bid-mediated death signaling pathway per se, rather than the potential difference in cerebrovascular anatomy. The bid-deficient mice and their wild-type littermates used in this study were virtually of the same genetic background. These mice had been back-crossed to C57BL/6 for 12 generations, which would likely eliminate any strain differences in response to ischemic injury as previously noted in rodents (45Maeda K. Hata R. Hossmann K.A. Neuroreport. 1998; 9: 1317-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 48Fujii M. Hara H. Meng W. Vonsattel J.P. Huang Z. Moskowitz M.A. Stroke. 1997; 28: 1805-1811Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Indeed, we quantitatively evaluated the distribution of anastomoses and the plasticity of PcomA in the brain and found no significant difference between the two types of mice (Table I). Furthermore, thebid-deficient mice and their wild-type littermates showed the same changes in regional cerebral blood flow during and after ischemia (Table II). These observations demonstrate that the neuroprotective effect by the bid gene deletion is independent of changes in cerebral blood flow or other physiological parameters.Table IIThere are no differences between wild-type and bid-null mice in hemodynamics during and after the transient ischemia treatment through the middle cerebral artery occlusionTimeaMeasurements were taken during and after MCA occlusion.rCBFBPpHpO2pCO2Wild-typeDuring12.1 (5.2)87.1 (11.3)7.32 (0.05)129.6 (22.7)40.3 (3.6)After79.9 (17.4)83.9 (9.2)7.36 (0.05)120.1 (19.5)42.9 (5.2)bid-nullDuring14.1 (4.8)85.9 (12.9)7.32 (0.09)133.8 (19.3)39.5 (7.3)After81.5 (13.5)83.3 (10.3)7.31 (0.08)128.5 (20.4)41.4 (4.6)Hemodynamic parameters measured are: rCBF (percentage of base-line level); BP (blood pressure; mmHg); pO2 (artery O2pressure; mmHg); pCO2 (artery CO2 pressure; mmHg).

Data are mean (S.D.) from 8 wild-type mice and 7 bid-null mice.a Measurements were taken during and after MCA occlusion. Open table in a new tab The data presented here are in concert with a recently published report (49Plesnila N. Zinkel S., Le, D.A. Amin-Hanjani S., Wu, Y. Qiu J. Chiarugi A. Thomas S.S. Kohane D.S. Korsmeyer S.J. Moskowitz M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 15318-15323Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), which showed that neuronal cultures derived frombid-deficient mice were resistant to apoptosis induced by oxygen/glucose deprivation, an in vitro experimental condition simulating ischemia. In addition, in the same study, an up to 67% reduction in infarct size was observed in bid-deficient mice subjected to transient focal cerebral ischemia, as compared with the wild-type controls (49Plesnila N. Zinkel S., Le, D.A. Amin-Hanjani S., Wu, Y. Qiu J. Chiarugi A. Thomas S.S. Kohane D.S. Korsmeyer S.J. Moskowitz M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 15318-15323Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). This level of protection was substantially greater than what we observed in our model system (30% reduction in infarction). This difference could be in part attributed to some minor differences in the genetic background of the bid-deficient mice used in the two different studies, with mice being back-crossed to C57BL/6 for 12 generations (inbred level) in our colony, but only for 7–8 generations in the colony used by the other study. Alternatively, the differences in the severity of ischemic insults employed by the two studies could be a major contributing factor that accounts for the different levels of neuroprotection. Although we employed a standard injury paradigm (90 min of ischemia and 72 h of reperfusion) that resulted in infarction of nearly the entire middle cerebral artery territory, a milder injury paradigm (30 min of ischemia and 48 h of reperfusion) that produced much smaller infarction was adopted by the other study. Indeed, the discrepancy in the level of protection shown in the two independent studies is consistent with the notion that the apoptotic mechanism may play a larger role in neuronal death after a milder ischemic insult than after a severe (or prolonged) ischemic insult (see Ref. 50Lipton P. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1431-1568Crossref PubMed Scopus (2561) Google Scholar for review). In severe ischemic injury, in which necrosis is prominent, the contributions from Bid and the apoptosis execution machinery to the ultimate outcome of injured tissues may be overwhelmed by other mechanisms of cell death, such as oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and energy failure. Nevertheless, the two studies clearly demonstrate that Bid activation is an early event in ischemic brain injury and complementarily support a role for Bid in mediating ischemic neuronal death.The precise mechanism through which Bid is proteolytically activated in neurons after ischemia is unclear at the present time. Several intracellular molecules have been proposed to be the activators of Bid, including caspase-8, granzyme B, or caspase-3 (30Li H. Zhu H., Xu, C.J. Yuan J.

The Fas/FADD/caspase-8 pathway appears to be the most efficient mechanism for Bid cleavage in various cell types and could be the major pathway for Bid cleavage in the ischemic brain. There is abundant evidence that the expression of the Fas receptor is remarkably increased and that its interacting protein FADD is activated in the brain after cerebral ischemia (22Park C.

Stroke. 2001; 32: 2356-2361Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) have also provided evidence that caspase-8 is activated during the early phase of ischemic brain injury. Furthermore, in Faslpr mice expressing dysfunctional Fas, ischemic infarction is markedly decreased as compared with wild-type mice (26Rosenbaum D.M. Gupta G. D'Amore J. Singh M. Weidenheim K. Zhang H. Kessler J.A. J. Neurosci. Res. 2000; 61: 686-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 27Martin-Villalba A. Herr I. Jeremias I. Hahne M. Brandt R. Vogel J. Schenkel J. Herdegen T. Debatin K.-M. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 3809-3817Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the above studies did not characterize the changes in caspase-8 and Bid activation in the Faslpr mice in response to ischemia, it may be speculated that Fas deficiency would lead to the failure of caspase-8 and Bid activation in neurons; this warrants further study for verification.Among the other mechanisms that potentially induce Bid activation, the proteolysis of Bid by caspase-3 may be an important feedback loop for the amplification of mitochondrial cytochrome c release (55Slee E.A. Keogh S.A. Martin S.J. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 556-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Because cytochrome c release and activation of caspase-3 are prominent in ischemic neuronal death, a role for caspase-3 as a direct activator of Bid in ischemic neurons should be considered. However, in a separate study, we found that inhibition of caspase-3/7 activities attenuated the production of the 15-kDa tBid in the brain at a later time point of 24 h, but not at the early time point of 6–12 h, after focal ischemia (data not shown), suggesting that caspase-3 is not responsible for the activation of Bid during the early stage of ischemic injury. The finding that ischemia-induced activation of caspase-3, but not caspase-8, was significantly decreased in bid-deficient mice at 6 h after ischemia indicates that the activation of Bid is downstream of the caspase-8 activity but upstream of the caspase-3 activity.Consistent with the prominent role of Bid in inducing cytochromec release upon its translocation to the mitochondria, the data from this study show that ischemia-induced cytochrome crelease was markedly attenuated in bid-deficient mice as compared with their wild-type littermates (Fig. 5). Notably, however, neither the inhibition of cytochrome c release nor the neuroprotection against the ischemic infarction was complete in the brain at the later stage of the injury development. These results suggest that mechanisms independent of the actions of Bid must be involved in the neurodegenerating processes after ischemia. Indeed, it has been suggested that several other pro-death events, such as Bax activation (44Cao G. Minami M. Pei W. Yan C. Chen D. O'Horo C. Graham S.H. Chen J. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 2001; 21: 321-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) and mitochondrial overproduction of ROS (18Fujimura M. Morita-Fujimura Y. Kawase M. Copin J.C. Calagui B. Epstein C.J. Chan P.H. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 3414-3422Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), may also be important triggers of cytochrome c release in ischemic neuronal death. These death signals could operate synergistically with the activated Bid in activating the death execution machinery.As suggested by the temporal profile of Bid activation in ischemic brains, the Bid-dependent signaling pathway and its downstream cell death execution events seem to contribute to neuronal injury at the reperfusion phase, rather than at the ischemic phase, after MCA occlusion. Bid cleavage and its mitochondrial translocation, cytochrome c release, and caspase-3 activation were readily detectable ∼3–6 h after the initiation of reperfusion (Figs. 3, 5, and 6), but none of these changes were observed at the end of MCA occlusion (0 min of reperfusion) or 30 min into the reperfusion (data not shown). These observations are consistent with many previous studies showing that the induction of neuronal apoptosis is generally a delayed event after the ischemia/reperfusion type of brain injury (see Ref. 50Lipton P. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1431-1568Crossref PubMed Scopus (2561) Google Scholar for review). This delay in apoptosis induction after cerebral ischemia has been attributable to several factors, including the restoration of cellular energy levels during the reperfusion phase, which may be essential for the energy-requiring steps in the execution of the apoptotic program (56Ankarcrona M.

DGKδ (type II isozyme) contains a pleckstrin homology domain at the N terminus and a sterile α motif domain at the C terminus. We identified another DGKδ isoform (DGKδ2, 135 kDa) that shared the same sequence with DGKδ previously cloned (DGKδ1, 130 kDa) except for the 52 residues N-terminally extended. Analysis of panels of human normal and tumor tissue cDNAs revealed that DGKδ2 was ubiquitously expressed in all normal and tumor tissues examined, whereas the transcript of DGKδ1 was detected only in ovary and spleen, and in a limited set of tumor-derived cells. The expression of DGKδ2 was induced by treating cells with epidermal growth factor and tumor-promoting phorbol ester. In contrast, the levels of mRNA and protein of DGKδ1 were suppressed by phorbol ester treatment. It thus becomes clear that the two DGKδ isoforms are expressed under distinct regulatory mechanisms. DGKδ1 was translocated through its pleckstrin homology domain from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane in response to phorbol ester stimulation, whereas DGKδ2 remained in the cytoplasm even after stimulation. Further experiments showed that the δ2-specific N-terminal sequence blocks the phorbol ester-dependent translocation of this isoform. Co-immunoprecipitation analysis of differently tagged DGKδ1 and DGKδ2 proteins showed that they were able to form homo- as well as hetero-oligomers. Taken together, alternative splicing of the human DGKδ gene generates at least two isoforms, differing in their expressions and regulatory functions.

The roles of diacylglycerol and PA as lipid second messengers have been attracting much attention. Diacylglycerol is known to be an activator of conventional and novel protein kinase Cs, chimerins, Unc-13, and Ras guanyl nucleotide-releasing protein (2Nishizuka Y.

Because the cellular concentrations of these signaling lipids must be strictly regulated, DGK is thought to be one of the key enzymes involved in the cellular signal transduction. It is now recognized that DGK represents a large gene family of isozymes differing remarkably in their structures, in the modes of tissue expression, and in the enzymological properties (7Sakane F.

In contrast to mammals, only a few DGK isozymes have been identified in organisms such asCaenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, and Arabidopsis thaliana (8Topham M.K. Prescott S.M. J. Biol.

Moreover, it is noteworthy that DGK gene has not yet been detected in yeast. It is therefore likely that DGK is needed to control functions unique to multicellular organisms, and that many mammalian DGK isozymes have essential roles in biological processes specific to higher vertebrates, such as development/differentiation, neural networking, the immune system, and tumorigenesis. However, our knowledge of specific functions of the individual DGK isozymes is still limited at present. Interestingly, the occurrence of alternative splicing was recently identified for three mammalian DGK genes, i.e. γ (14Kai M. Sakane F. Imai S. Wada I. Kanoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18492-18498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), ζ (23Ding L. Bunting M. Topham M.K. McIntyre T.M. Zimmerman G.A. Prescott S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The occurrence of alternative splicing in multiple DGK genes further supplements the complexity of the DGK gene family members, and apparently contributes to fine-tuning the action of DGKs regulating a wide range of cellular functions. Indeed, in the case of DGKβ, the control of the alternative splicing of this gene is hypothesized to be involved in the pathogenesis of human mood disorders (24Caricasole A. Bettini E. Sala C. Roncarati R. Kobayashi N. Caldara F. Goto K. Terstappen G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4790-4796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). We previously cloned a cDNA encoding DGKδ (type II isozyme) having a calculated molecular mass of 130 kDa (17Sakane F. Imai S. Kai M. Wada I. Kanoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8394-8401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). When the cloned DGKδ cDNA was expressed in COS-7 cells, indeed, a 130-kDa protein band was observed by Western blot analysis using anti-DGKδ antibody (17Sakane F. Imai S. Kai M. Wada I. Kanoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8394-8401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). However, we noted in subsequent experiments using HepG2 cell homogenates that, in addition to the 130-kDa band expected, an endogenous 140-kDa band strongly reacted with the anti-DGKδ antibody (see Fig. 2 A). 2F. Sakane and H. Kanoh, unpublished observation. This observation has suggested the existence of a splice variant of DGKδ gene with a larger molecular size. In the present study, we identified the occurrence of alternative splicing yielding a novel DGKδ isoform with distinct structural and functional properties. COS-7 and human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells were maintained in DMEM (Sigma-Aldrich, Tokyo, Japan) containing 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in an atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Cells were transiently transfected with cDNAs using Effectene transfection reagent according to the instructions from the manufacturer (Qiagen, Tokyo, Japan). After 2 days, cells were used for further analysis. RACE was performed to extend the 5′ end of human DGKδ cDNA using Marathon-Ready cDNA of human brain (Clontech, Tokyo, Japan) as templates. cDNA was synthesized with an adaptor primer 1 provided by the manufacturer and an antisense gene-specific primer (nucleotide positions 743–770, 5′-TGAACCATGGCCTTGCACCAGAGGCAGC-3′ (Ref. 17Sakane F. Imai S. Kai M. Wada I. Kanoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8394-8401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar)). The longest cDNA clone amplified (DKD2-10) was selected for sequence analysis. Total RNA was isolated from HepG2, HL-60, or HEK293 cells using Isogen (Nippon Gene, Tokyo, Japan) according to the instructions from the manufacturer. Reverse transcription into cDNA was achieved using the SuperScript preamplification system (Invitrogen, Tokyo, Japan) according to the protocol from the manufacturer. cDNAs from human normal tissues and tumor-derived cells were purchased from Clontech. PCR amplification was performed with Takara Ex Taq (Takara Biomedicals, Tokyo, Japan) using gene-specific oligonucleotide primers as follows: a DGKδ1 forward primer (nucleotide positions −22 to +3, 5′-GGGCACCTTGAAAACGCAAGTTTATG-3′), a DGKδ2 forward primer (nucleotide positions 132–156, 5′-CACGTCGGGTCAGATCCGACAGAAG-3′), and a common reverse primer (nucleotide positions 411–435 and 543–567 in DGKδ1 and DGKδ2, respectively; 5′-CATCCCTGAGAAGTGGTCCATGCTG-3′). PCR conditions were as follows: 94 °C for 4 min; 35 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 68 °C for 2 min; and 68 °C for 7 min. For normalization, human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) mRNA was simultaneously amplified (25 cycles). PCR products amplified were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, stained with ethidium bromide, and subjected to densitometric analysis. One μg each of pSRE-DGKδ1, pSRE-DGKδ2, or pSRE vector alone was transfected into COS-7 cells (60-mm dish) using Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen) as described by the manufacturer. After 2 days, the cells were harvested and lysed by sonication in lysis buffer (0.5 ml/60-mm dish) containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, Complete Protease Inhibitor Mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Tokyo, Japan) and Phosphatase Inhibitor Mixture II (Sigma-Aldrich). After a low speed centrifugation (550 × g for 10 min), the resultant supernatant was used as enzyme source. The octyl glucoside mixed micellar assay using diolein as substrate was done as described (17Sakane F. Imai S. Kai M. Wada I. Kanoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8394-8401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). COS-7 cells (∼1 × 107 cells, 60-mm dish) co-expressing 3×FLAG-tagged DGKδ2 and GFP-DGKδ1 or GFP-DGKδ2 were harvested in lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, Complete Protease Inhibitor Mixture, and Phosphatase Inhibitor Mixture II. The mixture was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C to give cell lysates. Cell lysates (400 μl) were precleared with Protein A/G PLUS-agarose (10 μl, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-GFP (2 μl, Living Colors full-length A.v. polyclonal antibody, Clontech) was added to the precleared lysates to immunoprecipitate GFP-fusion proteins. After 1 h at 4 °C, Protein A/G PLUS-agarose beads (5 μl) were added and further incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. After the agarose beads were washed five times with wash buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.6 m KCl), immunoprecipitated proteins were extracted with 50 μl of SDS sample buffer and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE. GFP alone, DGKδ-PH-GFP, or DGKδ-S2+PH-GFP (see Fig. 6 for DGKδ constructs) was transfected into HEK293 cells (60-mm dish) using Effectene transfection reagent. After 24 h, the cells were washed four times with PBS and then cultured in DMEM plus 0.1% BSA. After 3 h, the medium was exchanged with DMEM plus 0.1% BSA containing 1 μm TPA, and cells were cultured for another 1 h. The cells were then harvested and lysed by sonication in lysis buffer (0.3 ml) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, Complete Protease Inhibitor Mixture, and Phosphatase Inhibitor Mixture II. After a low speed centrifugation (550 ×g for 10 min), the homogenate was separated into the soluble and particulate fractions by a centrifugation at 100,000 ×g for 30 min. The particulate fraction was suspended in the original volume (0.3 ml) of the lysis buffer. The aliquots (20 μl) of these fractions were subjected to immunoblot analysis using anti-GFP antibody. Cell lysates and immunoprecipitates were separated on SDS-PAGE (7.5 or 15%). The separated proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad, Tokyo, Japan) and blocked with Block Ace (Dainippon Pharmaceutical, Tokyo, Japan). The membrane was incubated with anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody or anti-GFP monoclonal antibody (B-2, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in Block Ace for 1 h. The immunoreactive bands were visualized using peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or mouse IgG antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) and ECL (Amersham Biosciences, Tokyo, Japan). HEK293 cells were grown on poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips and transiently transfected with expression plasmids containing DGKδ cDNAs N- or C-terminally fused with GFP. After 24 h, HEK293 cells were washed four times with PBS and then cultured in DMEM plus 0.1% BSA. After 3 h, the medium was exchanged with DMEM plus 0.1% BSA containing 1 μm TPA, and cells were cultured for another 1 h. The cells were then fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min and washed five times with PBS at room temperature. The coverslips were mounted using Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Cells were examined using an inverted confocal laser scanning microscopy (Zeiss LSM 510). Images were processed using Adobe Photoshop 6.0 (Adobe Systems, San Jose, CA). To clone an alternative splicing product of the DGKδ gene, we performed 5′-RACE using a human brain cDNA as template. Sequencing of 14 clones amplified showed that all of them shared a 5′ sequence that was lacking in the DGKδ cDNA previously isolated from HepG2 cell cDNA library (17Sakane F. Imai S. Kai M. Wada I. Kanoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8394-8401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The longest clone (DKD2-10) had a 168-bp-long (open reading frame, 156 bp) 5′ sequence that was different from the 104-bp-long (open reading frame, 24 bp) 5′ sequence of DGKδ cDNA previously cloned (17Sakane F. Imai S. Kai M. Wada I. Kanoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8394-8401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 A). We tentatively designated the original (from HepG2 cells) and new (from human brain) DGKδ clones as DGKδ1 and DGKδ2, respectively. DGKδ2 had a predicted translation initiation site (nucleotide positions 1–3) different from that of DGKδ1 (Fig. 1, A and B), whose flanking sequence conformed well to the Kozak consensus sequence (CC(A/G)CCATG(A/G)). Analysis of a genomic clone (accession no.AC013726) deposited in DNA data base showed that the exon/intron boundaries fulfill the GT/AG rule and that DGKδ1 uses the second exon of DGKδ2 as the first exon (Fig. 1, A and B). The open reading frames of DGKδ1 and DGKδ2 encode 1170- and 1214-aa proteins with calculated molecular masses of 130 and 135 kDa, respectively (Fig. 1 C). The unique N-terminal 52-aa residues of DGKδ2 contain Pro-rich and Glu/Asp-rich sequences, and the C-terminal half of this region shows significant homology to the N-terminal part of hamster DGKη (18Klauck T.M., Xu, X. Mousseau B. Jaken S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19781-19788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 D). In an attempt to characterize the properties of the two DGKδ isoforms, we subcloned each of the cDNAs into an expression vector and transfected them into COS-7 cells. Proteins with apparent molecular masses of 130 and 140 kDa were recognized by antibody against the C-terminal part of DGKδ (17Sakane F. Imai S. Kai M. Wada I. Kanoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8394-8401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) in the cells transfected with DGKδ1 and DGKδ2 cDNAs, respectively (Fig.2 A). The apparent molecular masses of DGKδ1 and DGKδ2 expressed from the cDNAs corresponded with the 130- and 140-kDa bands of DGKδ endogenously present in HepG2 cells, respectively (Fig. 2 A). We found that HepG2 cells contained 2–5-fold more DGKδ2 than DGKδ1 isozyme. To address whether the novel DGKδ2 cDNA encodes a functional enzyme, homogenates from cells transfected with the DGKδ2 cDNA or vector alone were assayed for DGK activity. In this case, Western blot analysis showed that the proteins of DGKδ1 and DGKδ2 were expressed to a comparable extent in COS-7 cells (Fig. 2 A). As shown in Fig. 2 B, DGKδ1 and DGKδ2 displayed comparable DGK activities when assayed in vitro, confirming that both of the splice variants are active enzymes. To investigate the expression patterns of DGKδ isoforms, panels of cDNAs synthesized from human normal and tumor tissues and cell lines were analyzed by RT-PCR. As shown in Fig.3 (A–C), the DGKδ2 transcript was detectable in all normal and tumor tissues and cell lines examined and was expressed predominantly in testis, peripheral blood leukocytes, lung carcinomas (GI-117 and LX-1), colon adenocarcinomas (CX-1 and GI-112), a prostatic adenocarcinoma (PC3), HepG2, HL-60, and HEK293 cells. On the other hand, the DGKδ1 transcript was detected only in ovary, and to a lesser extent in spleen. The expression of DGKδ1 in human tumor tissues and cell lines was also much more limited and was detected in HepG2, HL-60 cells, LX-1, CX-1, and several other tumor tissues. Thus, DGKδ2 showed a much broader tissue distribution, whereas the expression of DGKδ1 was highly tissue-specific. Although it is difficult to compare the relative amounts of PCR products generated using different primers, we noted that the expression level of DGKδ2 was generally higher than that of DGKδ1 except for ovary. To confirm these results obtained using RT-PCR, we examined the protein levels of the DGKδ isoforms in several human normal tissues (kidney, testis, and ovary) and cell lines (HepG2, HL-60, and HEK293 cells) by Western blotting. As shown in Fig.3 D, the protein levels of the DGKδ isoforms were consistent with the corresponding mRNA levels. Although further work is required, it seems likely that the expression of DGKδ1 is relatively tissue-specific, and that DGKδ2 is the major product of DGKδ gene in most tissues and cells except for ovary. Differential tissue distribution patterns of DGKδ1 and DGKδ2 mRNAs suggested that the expression of the isoforms is regulated under distinct mechanisms. Because Klauck et al. (18Klauck T.M., Xu, X. Mousseau B. Jaken S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19781-19788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) reported that glucocorticoid, triamcinolone acetonide (TAA), increased the expression level of other type II isozyme, DGKη, we first tested the effect of TAA. When HepG2 cells, known to express glucocorticoid receptors (25Raddatz D. Henneken M. Armbrust T. Ramadori G. Hepatology. 1996; 24: 928-933Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), were treated with 10 nm TAA for 72 h, the protein levels of DGKδ1 and DGKδ2 remained almost unchanged (Fig. 4 A), although we confirmed in the same experiment that the level of DGKη mRNA was markedly increased as described by Klauck et al.(18Klauck T.M., Xu, X. Mousseau B. Jaken S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19781-19788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). 3M. Murakami, F. Sakane, S. Imai, and H. Kanoh, unpublished observation. Because the DGKδ2 transcript was expressed in a wide range of tumor-derived cells, we next tested the effects of a tumor-promoting phorbol ester (TPA) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) on the expression levels of DGKδ isoforms. When HepG2 cells were cultured for 24 h in the presence of TPA (100 nm), the DGKδ2 protein level detected as a 140-kDa band was markedly (2.8-fold) increased (Fig. 4 B). In contrast, the DGKδ1 protein was decreased almost to an undetectable level. To ask whether these changes of protein levels were caused by transcriptional regulation, we measured the levels of the transcripts of the isoforms by RT-PCR. Consistent to the changes of enzyme proteins, the DGKδ2 transcript was increased (2.0-fold) by TPA stimulation, whereas that of DGKδ1 was decreased to an undetectable level (Fig. 4 C). We next examined the effect of EGF on the expression of cellular DGKδ enzymes. For this purpose, we used HEK293 cells because HepG2 cells failed to respond to EGF. When HEK293 cells were incubated for 48 h in the presence of EGF (10 ng/ml), the DGKδ2 protein was substantially (2.3-fold) increased (Fig.4 D). However, DGKδ1 protein was not detectable both in the absence and presence of EGF. We confirmed that the DGKδ2 transcript was increased (2.3-fold) by EGF stimulation, whereas that of DGKδ1 remained undetectable (Fig. 4 E). These results indicate that the protein levels of DGKδ1 and DGKδ2 are regulated, at least in part, at the transcriptional stage and that, although derived from a single gene, the transcription of the two forms of DGKδ is regulated under distinct regulatory mechanisms. We have recently found TPA-induced translocation of DGKδ1 from cytoplasmic vesicles to the plasma membrane in HEK293 cells (26Imai S. Sakane F. Kanoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35323-35332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Therefore, we intended to see the intracellular localization of DGKδ2 with a unique N-terminal sequence and also to see whether DGKδ2 was translocated by TPA stimulation similarly as observed for DGKδ1. Although cytoplasmic/nucleoplasmic localization of GFP alone was not affected by TPA stimulation, DGKδ1 was confirmed to be translocated from cytoplasmic vesicles to the plasma membrane in TPA-stimulated cells (Fig. 5) as previously reported (26Imai S. Sakane F. Kanoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35323-35332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In contrast, DGKδ2 localized at cytoplasmic vesicles in resting cells failed to be significantly translocated in TPA-stimulated cells. The results indicate that, in TPA-stimulated cells, the two DGK isoforms can be spatially segregated, reflecting their distinct roles in the regulation of cellular functions As shown in Fig. 6 A, DGKδ1 and DGKδ2 share most of the C-terminal sequence (as many as 1162 aa residues), differing from each other only in the short stretches of the N-terminal sequences. It is therefore reasonable to assume that the N-terminal sequence unique to each of the two enzymes is responsible for their discrepant responses to TPA stimulation. In the experiments using HEK293 cells, we first examined the intracellular localization of an N-terminally truncated mutant, DGKδ lacking both the PH domain and the DGKδ1- or DGKδ2-specific sequence (GFP-DGKδ-ΔS1,2ΔPH). As shown in Fig. 6 B, this mutant lost the ability of the TPA-dependent translocation. The result indicates that the PH domain and/or the DGKδ1-specific sequence is necessary for the translocation of DGKδ1. Thus, we next asked whether the DGKδ PH domain alone (DGKδ-PH-GFP) is sufficient for the translocation. As observed with wild-type DGKδ1, DGKδ-PH-GFP showed the TPA-dependent translocation from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane (Fig. 6 B). To determine the functions of the DGKδ1- and DGKδ2-specific sequences, the localization of the PH domain containing one of these sequences (DGKδ-S1+PH-GFP or DGKδ-S2+PH-GFP) was analyzed. DGKδ-S1+PH-GFP showed the TPA-dependent translocation like DGKδ-PH-GFP, whereas DGKδ-S2+PH-GFP did not (Fig. 6 B). To confirm the translocation detected by microscopic observation, we performed an alternative approach: cell fractionation by a centrifugation at 100,000 × g. The extract from HEK293 cells expressing DGKδ-PH-GFP or DGKδ-S2+PH-GFP was fractionated, and the contents of the GFP fusion proteins in each fraction were determined by Western blot analysis using anti-GFP antibody (Fig. 6 C). The amount of DGKδ-PH-GFP in the particulate (membrane) fraction increased markedly after TPA stimulation, although a predominant amount of DGKδ-PH-GFP remained still cytosolic. However, DGKδ-S2+PH-GFP and GFP alone were completely recovered in the cytosolic fraction without detectable membrane association. Taken together, the DGKδ PH domain is necessary and sufficient for the TPA-dependent enzyme translocation and the DGKδ2-specific sequence is likely to have inhibitory effect(s) on the translocation. We previously reported that TPA-dependent phosph"
https://openalex.org/W2111662566,"At several E. coli promoters, initiation of transcription is repressed by a tight nucleoprotein complex formed by the assembly of the H-NS protein. In order to characterize the relationship between the structure of H-NS oligomers in solution and on relevant DNA fragments, we have compared wild-type H-NS and several transdominant H-NS mutants using gel shift assays, DNase I footprinting, analytical ultracentrifugation, and reactivity toward a cross-linking reagent. In solution, oligomerization occurs through two protein interfaces, one necessary to construct a dimeric core (and involving residues 1–64) and the other required for subsequent assembly of these dimers. We show that, as well as region 64–95, residues present in the NH2-terminal coiled coil domain also participate in this second interface. Our results support the view that the same interacting interfaces are also involved on the DNA. We propose that the dimeric core recognizes specific motifs, with the second interface being critical for their correct head to tail assembly. The COOH-terminal domain of the protein contains the DNA binding motif essential for the discrimination of this specific functional assembly over competitive nonspecific H-NS polymers."

Selectivity of IRP1 and IRP2 binding depends on bulge or bulge/loop structure in the IRE helix. The large helix distortion created by the internal loop/bulge, unique to ferritin IRE, contributes to greater IRP2 binding relative to weak interaction of the protein with C-bulge IREs (32Ke Y.

In the TfR mRNA stability element, high conservation of all five IREs (14Koeller D.M. Casey J.L. Hentze M.W. Gerhardt E.M. Chan L.N. Klausner R.D. Harford J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 3763-3771Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) suggests that all of them are essential for function. Many studies of IRP interaction with different IREs, including the TfR-IREs, have used a single IRE (14,16,32–34,36–38) or a 3xIRE construct (IREb, IREc, and IREd) with truncated linking sequences and the less selective binding protein, IRP1 (11Binder R.

To understand the conservation of five C-bulge IREs in the TfR mRNA stability element, the interactions of the full length element (5xIRE) with IRP1 and with the more selective IRP2 were examined in vitro and compared with fragments containing only 3 or 2 IREs (Fig. 1). The results showed that in the context of the full length TfR stability element, all 5 IREs appear to be available for IRP binding and that IRP2 binding to multiple-IRE RNA, was comparable with IRP1 binding, i.e. enhanced relative to a single TfR-IRE binding by IRP2. As the IRE copy number decreased from 5, to 3 or 2, the IRP-mediated nuclease resistance of the RNA decreased. Enhanced IRP2 binding to TfR-IREs in the context of 5xIRE was correlated with distortion in the IRE helices, detected by Cu-(phen)2 binding/cleavage, which coincides with similar structure in the ferritin IRE that is related to high IRP2 binding, as previously observed (33Ke Y., Wu, J.

The change in TfR-IRE structures within the context of multiple-IRE RNA, and the variations we observed in cell and developmental expression of IRP1 and IRP2, with IRP2 mRNA predominating, would enable TfR synthesis and iron uptake for growth in IRP1-deficient cell types. Thus, cell-specific variations in IRP and IRP1/IRP2 expression will have a smaller impact on TfR mRNA (multiple IRE) or ferritin mRNA (distinctive IRE) relative to other IRE containing mRNAs, increasing cell specificity and the range of IRE-mRNA response for NO, iron, and oxidative stress signals. A 662-bp cDNA sequence coding for a part of TfR-3′-UTR responsible for iron regulation of TfR mRNA (13Casey J.L. Hentze M.W. Koeller D.M. Caughman S.W. Rouault T.A. Klausner R.D. Harford J.B.

This sequence (5xIRE), which included all five TfR-IREs (IREs a–e) and the native linking sequences (Fig. 1), served as a template for PCR amplification of fragments with only 2 or 3 IREs:3xIRE, a 518-bp fragment including TfR-IREb, IREc, and IREd and the linking sequences a/b, b/c, and c/d, which was amplified with the primers: sense, 5′-AATAGAATATAATTATCGGAAGCAGTG-3′; antisense, 5′-CCCTTAGTGTAACATATGGAGATCA-3′. 2xIRE, a 477-bp fragment including TfR-IREb and TfR-IREc and the linking sequences a/b, b/c, and c/d was amplified with the primers: sense, 5′-AATAGAATATAATTATCGGAAGCAGTG-3′; antisense, 5′-CACTGTGGTAGGTAAAAACTACCTTG-3′. PCR products were subcloned into pCR®II-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) and confirmed by sequencing. Cloning and expression requirements added 102 nt (69 nt at the 5′ end and 36 nt at the 3′ end) of vector sequences to the 5xIRE, 3xIRE, and 2xIRE transcripts. TfR-IREb (chemically synthesized by Dharmacon Research, Inc.) was selected to represent a single TfR-IRE RNA form (1xIRE) because of its relatively high affinity to IRPs (14Koeller D.M. Casey J.L. Hentze M.W. Gerhardt E.M. Chan L.N. Klausner R.D. Harford J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3574-3578Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) and because IREb is one of three TfR-IREs in TRS-1, a minimal TfR-3′-UTR sequence that displays iron-dependent regulation of TfR expression (42Casey J.L. Koeller D.M. Ramin V.C. Klausner R.D. Harford J.B. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3693-3699Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Confirmed TfR-3′-UTR clones were linearized with SpeI (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and served as templates for in vitro transcription of uniformly 32P-labeled T7 transcripts with MEGAscript™ kit (Ambion) in the presence of 7.5 mm each ATP, CTP, and GTP, 3.25 mm UTP, 20 μCi [α-32P]UTP (AmershamBiosciences) and 0.75–1.5 μg of DNA template, for 2–3 h at 37 °C. After enzymatic removal of DNA template by an additional 10-min incubation of in vitro transcription reaction with 2 units of DNase (Ambion), unincorporated NTPs were removed by gel filtration (ProbeQuant™ G-50 Micro columns; Amersham Biosciences). Samples were quantified by UV spectroscopy. Synthesis and integrity of full length transcripts were confirmed by denaturing gel electrophoresis of the uniformly labeled RNA (4% acrylamide/8m urea) calibrated with RNA Century™ Marker Plus template set (Ambion). RNA transcripts were melted in water (5 min at 85 °C) and annealed in the presence of Na+ or Mg2+while slowly cooling to room temperature. Annealing at increased ionic strength (50 mm Na+ or 5 mmMg2+) eliminated a slower electrophoretically migrating RNA species observed with all three TfR-RNA constructs (2xIRE, 3xIRE, and 5xIRE). A faster migrating, compactly folded conformation, which was unaffected by higher ionic concentration or by the IRP binding solution (see below) was routinely obtained with 50 mm NaCl, aliquoted, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. The annealed RNA was used to analyze IRP binding, nuclease resistance, and Cu-(phen)2 cleavage. When single TfR-IREb RNA and DNA oligomers were used, they were labeled at the 5′ end with [γ-32P]ATP (3000 or 6000 Ci/mmol, respectively;Amersham Biosciences) and bacteriophage T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega) and purified by gel filtration (ProbeQuant™ G-50 Micro columns; Amersham Biosciences). Secondary structure modeling of the RNA was performed with RNAstructure version 3.71 (D.H. Mathews, M. Zuker, and D.H. Turner). IRP clones were kindly provided by W. E. Walden (rabbit IRP1) and E. A. Leibold (rat IRP2) to use with the human TfR-3′-UTR RNA sequences. Phylogenetic sequence conservation of the IRPs is >90%, although IRP1 and IRP2 are only ∼60% identical (14Koeller D.M. Casey J.L. Hentze M.W. Gerhardt E.M. Chan L.N. Klausner R.D. Harford J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3574-3578Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 19Samaniego F. Chin J. Iwai K.

The His-tagged IRPs were purified from the cytosol ofSaccharomyces cerevisiae as previously described (33Ke Y., Wu, J. Leibold E.A. Walden W.E. Theil E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23637-23640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) with His-Bind Resin and Buffer kit (Novagen). Purified proteins were stored as small aliquots at −80 °C and used within 4–6 months. 0.01–0.1 pmol of uniformly32P-labeled 5xIRE transcript, pre-annealed in 50 mm NaCl, was incubated with various amounts of recombinant IRP (0.01–8 pmol) for 30 min at 4 °C. The binding reaction mixture comprised 24 mm Hepes pH 7.2, 60 mm KCl, 5% glycerol, 2% β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.004 units/μl RNasin (Promega) in a final volume of 25 μl. Protein-RNA complexes were resolved from unbound RNA by non-denaturing gel electrophoresis as follows. Glycerol-based loading buffer was added to the sample and loaded onto 4% or 6% acrylamide gel (acrylamide: Bis = 19:1). Gels were run in 1× Tris borate-EDTA buffer for 3–7 h at 4 °C and 5–8 V/cm. Images of dried gels were visualized with a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Comparison to single TfR-IRE binding used a single, chemically synthesized TfR-IREb (1xIRE) at the same IRP and IRE concentration (2 nm IRE) and binding conditions. Binding to nitrocellulose filters (36Kaldy P. Menotti E. Moret R. Kuhn L.C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6073-6083Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) was used for quantitative analysis of IRP interactions with TfR-3′-UTR RNA. To compare RNA with different IRE copy numbers, equal IRE concentrations (2 nm) but different concentrations of total RNA (5xIRE, 0.4 nm; 3xIRE, 0.67 nm; and 2xIRE, 1.0 nm) were used with IRP concentrations of 0.4–120 nm. Binding conditions used for the EMSA assay as described above were scaled up to a final volume of 50 μl for the nuclease resistance/filter binding analysis. Retention of RNA by nitrocellulose membranes (type BA79, 0.1 μm; Schleicher and Schull) in a slot-blot apparatus, with or without RNase T1 digestion (Roche Molecular Biochemicals or Ambion; 10 min with 3–196 units of nuclease) was analyzed after washing filters with 5 volumes of 50 mmKCl and vacuum drying (15 min). Under conditions of 100–200 units of RNase T1/ng RNA, defined by us as the “limit digest,” >95% of the unbound RNA was digested to fragments shorter then 35 nt (detected by denaturing gel electrophoresis). RNase T1 was selected to assess IRP-dependent nuclease protection of the RNAs because 1) G residues, targeted by the enzyme, are scattered throughout the TfR-3′-UTR IREs and linking sequences; 2) at the salt concentration used (<100 mm NaCl), RNase T1 cleavage of RNA is relatively nonspecific (both single- or double-stranded G residues) (44Ausubel F.N. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Ausubel F.N. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 1st edition. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 2001Crossref Google Scholar); and 3) RNase T1 was active under the standard IRP binding conditions. Retained radioactivity was quantified with a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences) and ImageQuant 5.0 software (AmershamBiosciences). Retention of free RNA (background values) was 1–2% of total applied radioactivity after RNase T1 digestion and 4–6% before digestion. Maximum filter-binding results were normalized to 100% binding for each IRP (60–80% of total applied radioactivity with all RNA constructs). To analyze IRP protection of the linkers, filter binding was performed as described above with unlabeled in vitro transcribed 5xIRE RNA and saturating amounts of IRPs, as confirmed by filter-binding assay and total shift of the RNA in a non-denaturing gel. IRP·RNA complexes were fully digested with 196 units of RNase T1 (limit digest). Mixtures were filtered through a nitrocellulose filter as described above, and retained RNA was UV cross-linked to the membranes (StrataLinker; Stratagene). Membranes were hybridized with ExpressHyb® hybridization solution according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Clontech) to 10 pmol of 32P-end labeled antisense DNA oligomers (Invitrogen), specifically targeted to linker sequences between IREa and IREb, IRE b and IREc, and IRE c and IRCd (Fig. 1): bc1, nt 3513–3531; bc2, nt 3602–3621; bc3, nt 3682–3701; bc4, nt 3822–3841; bc5, nt 3864–3883; cd1, 3915–3932; cd2, 3933–3950 (numbering according to Ref. 41Schneider C. Owen M.J. Banville O.D. Williams J.G. Nature. 1984; 311: 675-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). No significant sequence similarity was found between the different probes. No hybridization signal was detected with an unrelated DNA oligomer probe. In vitro-transcribed TfR-3′-UTR RNA (5xIRE) in a final concentration of 50 nm was reacted with 18 μm Cu-(phen)2 as previously described (32Ke Y. Sierzputowska-Gracz H. Gdaniec Z. Theil E.C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6235-6242Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The RNA cleavage products were used as templates for32P-labeled cDNA synthesis with the primer 5′-CACTGTGGTAGGTAAAAACTACCTTG-3′, which bound 38 nt downstream of TfR-IREc, and the primer 5′-CAAGCTTTGAAGATGTCATTGC-3′, which bound 32 nt downstream of TfR-IREe. The cDNAs were resolved on 8% acrylamide/8 m urea gels, calibrated by dideoxynucleotide sequencing of TfR-3′-UTR with reverse transcriptase, as previously described (45Wang Y.H. Sczekan S.R. Theil E.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 4463-4468Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Radioactivity was located and quantified with ImageQuant 5.0 software (Amersham Biosciences). Significant cleavage was determined as a signal which was threefold different than background values, i.e. cleavage in the absence of Cu-(phen)2 (45Wang Y.H. Sczekan S.R. Theil E.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 4463-4468Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Expression of IRP1, IRP2, and TfR was examined using poly(A)+ from a variety of human tissues and cell lines in the multiple tissue expression array filter (MTETM array; Clontech). Probes were prepared by PCR filter amplification of HeLa-cell cDNA (Clontech) with specific primers for IRP1 (sense, 5′-CAAGCAGGCACCACAGACTA-3′; antisense, 5′-ACCCTCAGTGCTCACTTGCT-3′) and IRP2 (sense, 5′-GAATGCACCAAATCCTGGAG3-′; antisense, 5′-GAGAAACTGGCACAAGC-3′). Probes were designed based on alignment results of the nucleotide sequences of IRP1 (accession number AF261088) and IRP2 (accession number M58511) to yield PCR products from non-homologous regions: IRP1, 599 bp (2411–3009) and IRP2, 515 bp (420–934); this fragment of IRP2 included the coding region for the unique IRP2 73-amino acid insert (19Samaniego F.

Following purification (PCR purification kit; Qiagen), PCR products were confirmed by electrophoresis in agarose gels calibrated with molecular weight markers and stained with ethidium bromide. 200 ng of the DNA were labeled with [32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol;Amersham Biosciences) and Klenow Random Priming labeling kit (Bio-Rad). Unincorporated NTPs were removed by gel filtration (ProbeQuant™ G-50 Micro columns; Amersham Biosciences). Hybridization (ExpressHyb® hybridization solution) and washing and stripping of the multiple tissue expression membrane were performed according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Clontech). No hybridization signals were detected with the yeast RNA or Escherichia coli RNA or DNA controls, confirming the specificity of the probes. Bound radioactivity was analyzed with a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences) and quantified with ImageQuant 5.0. Radioactivity on each filter was normalized to constant specific activity (cpm/A 260) to allow comparisons among the different cDNA probes in different tissues. The IRE structure (∼ 30 nt) is the site of IRP binding (46Harrell C.M. McKenzie A.R. Patino M.M. Walden W.E. Theil E.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4166-4170Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Single IREs from a variety of mRNAs showed differential IRP1 and IRP2 binding, associating differences in IRE helix structure with different ranges of signal response (12Eisenstein R.S. Annu. Rev.

For a multiple-IRE regulatory structure such as the TfR-3′-UTR mRNA, the simplest model is independent binding of IRPs by each IRE (11Binder R. Horowitz J.A. Basilion J.P. Koeller D.M. Klausner R.D.

The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the contributions of five TfR-IRE elements, in the context of the natural linking sequences, to the interaction with IRP1 and IRP2. A set of three RNAs with different IRE copy numbers was synthesized by in vitrotranscription of DNA cloned from HeLa-cell cDNA as illustrated in Fig. 1. The native, full length TfR mRNA 3′-UTR regulatory element (5xIRE), with all five IREs and the wild-type linking sequences, was employed for IRP-binding experiments and for chemical cleavage by Cu-(phen)2. Truncated RNA constructs of the TfR mRNA 3′-UTR, with only 3 or 2 IREs (3xIRE and 2xIRE) were used to study the effect of IRE copy number on IRP-dependent nuclease resistance of TfR-3′-UTR.

https://openalex.org/W2163457900,"The major protein component of the cornified cell envelope barrier structure of the epidermis is loricrin, and it is expressed late during terminal differentiation in epidermal keratinocytes. We have previously shown that an AP1 site located in the proximal promoter region (position −55) is essential for human loricrin promoter activity (Rossi, A., Jang, S-I., Ceci, R., Steinert, P. M., and Markova, N. G. (1998) J. Invest. Dermatol. 110, 34–40). In this study we show that its regulation requires complex cooperative and competitive interactions between multiple transcription factors in keratinocytes located in different compartments of the epidermis. We show that as few as 154 base pairs of 5′-upstream sequences from the cap site can direct the keratinocyte-specific expression in cultured keratinocytes. Mutation and DNA-protein analyses show that Sp1, c-Jun, an unidentified regulator, and the co-activator p300/CREB-binding protein up-regulate whereas Sp3, CREB-1/CREMα/ATF-1, Jun B, and an AP2-like protein (termed the keratinocyte-specific repressor-1 (KSR-1)) suppress loricrin promoter activity. We show that CREB protein can compete with c-Jun for the AP1 site and repress loricrin promoter activity. We show here that the protein kinase A pathway can activate loricrin expression by manipulation of the Sp1, Sp3, and KSR-1 levels in the nucleus. Thus, in undifferentiated cells, loricrin expression is suppressed by Jun B, Sp3, and KSR-1 proteins. But in advanced differentiated cells, levels of Sp3, KSR-1, and CREB proteins are lower; the unidentified regulator protein can bind; Sp1 and c-Jun are increased; and then p300/CBP is recruited. Together, these events allow loricrin transcription to proceed. Indeed, the synergistic effects of the Sp1, c-Jun, and p300 factors indicate that p300/CBP might act as bridge to form an active transcription complex.

As a stratified squamous epithelium, some inner basal cells become committed to terminal differentiation and move outward to form spinous, granular, and eventually fully differentiated, dead cornified layers. During this migration and differentiation program, unique sets of biochemical markers including specific structural proteins, such as keratins, their associated proteins, and processing enzymes, are synthesized (1Watt F.M.

Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 123-153Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Another characteristic feature is the formation of the cornified cell envelope (CE),1 which is crucial for barrier function of the epidermis (4Roop D.R. Science. 1995; 267: 474-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The CE is a highly insoluble structure and contains a complex mixture of specific proteins such as involucrin, loricrin, small proline-rich proteins, XP-5 family members, cystatin A, elafin, S100 family members, and lipids that are covalently cross-linked by transglutaminases (5Rice R.H.

The quantitatively major CE protein in normal epidermis is loricrin (6Steinert P.M. Marekov L.N. J. Biol.

However, the loricrin-deficient mouse model shows only minor defects in barrier function (11Koch P. de Viragh P.A. Scharer E. Bundman D. Longley M.A. Bickenbach J. Kawachi Y. Suga Y. Zhou Z. Huber M. Hohl D. Kartasova T. Jarnik M. Steven A.C. Roop D.R. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 389-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), probably because other CE proteins such as small proline-rich proteins, XP-5 proteins, and repetin are up-regulated late during fetal development and apparently compensate for the loss of loricrin (12Marshall D. Hardman M.J. Nield K.M. Byrne C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3031-13036Google Scholar). The expression of loricrin is strictly linked to keratinocyte terminal differentiation both in vivo and in vitro (13Hohl D. Am. J. Dermatophthol. 1993; 15: 20-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar,14Hohl D. Lichti U. Bretkreutz D. Steinert P.M. Roop D.R. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1991; 96: 414-418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The loricrin transcripts are localized in the granular layers of the epidermis and some related orthokeratinizing epithelia (15Mehrel T. Hohl D. Rothnagel J.A. Longley M.A. Bundman D. Cheng C. Lichti U. Bisher M.E. Steven A.C. Steinert P.M. Yuspa S.H. Roop D.R. Cell. 1990; 61: 1103-1112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 16Hohl D. Mehrel T. Lichti U. Turner M.L. Roop D.R. Steinert P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6626-6636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Also, it has been demonstrated that loricrin transcription can be up-regulated when cultured keratinocytes are induced to differentiate by calcium (14Hohl D. Lichti U. Bretkreutz D. Steinert P.M. Roop D.R. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1991; 96: 414-418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the tissue and differentiation specificity of loricrin expression make it an excellent model to study the sequences and transcription factors involved in the control of keratinocyte- and differentiation-specific gene expression. It has been reported that 6.5 kbp of sequences upstream of the cap site are required for the epithelium-specific expression of the mouse loricrin gene (17DiSepio D. Jones A. Longley M.A. Bundman D. Rothnagel J.A. Roop D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10792-10799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Further study showed that a total of 14-kbp sequences are required to direct the differentiation-specific expression of mouse loricrin in transgenic mice (18DiSepio D. Bickenbach J. Longley M.A. Bundman D. Rothnagel J.A. Roop D.R. Differentiation. 1995; 64: 225-235Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that the regulation of epidermal gene expression appears to be controlled primarily at the transcription level. Several ubiquitously expressed transcription factors such as Sp1, NF-κB, AP2, AP1, Ets, and POU domain proteins, together with some unidentified factors (for example AP2-like factors), are involved in the specificity of epidermal gene expression. It is thought that the control of specificity of gene expression can be achieved through various arrangements of binding sites and the complex combinatory interplay between these regulators (19Ohtsuki M. Flanagan S. Freedberg I. Blumenberg M. Gene Expr. 1993; 3: 201-213PubMed Google Scholar, 20Byrne C. Fuchs E. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 1996; 271: 4561-4568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The transcriptional regulation of the human loricrin gene expression is poorly understood. In our previous study, we reported that a functional AP1 motif (located 55 bp upstream of the cap site) is indispensable for human loricrin promoter activity, and c-Jun/c-Fos heterodimers activate whereas Jun B suppresses promoter activity (25Rossi A. Jang S-I. Ceci R. Steinert P.M. Markova N.G. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1998; 110: 34-40Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The aim of the present work is to further characterize the regulatory elements and the transcriptional control of the human loricrin promoter in cultured NHEK cells. Our study shows that, unlike the mouse loricrin gene, as few as 154 bp upstream of the transcription initiation site are sufficient for keratinocyte-specific expression. However, the calcium-responsiveness elements are not located within the first 1.3 kbp of the promoter region. Our data demonstrate that the regulation of loricrin gene expression requires interactions among multiple transcription factors, a fine balance of the availability of these proteins, and recruitment of the co-activator p300/CBP. Together, these allow maximal loricrin promoter activity in NHEK cells. To construct the pCAT(−1370/+9) plasmid, the following primers were used (PstI andXbaI restriction sites used for cloning are shown in lowercase): forward, 5′-AActgcagCTGTCATTTCAAAACATAACTGGGC-3′; reverse, 5′-GctctagaAGATGCTGGCAATGTGAGGAC-3′. These were used for amplification by PCR using a human loricrin genomic clone (26Yoneda K. Hohl D. McBride O.W. Wang M. Cehrs K.U. Idler W.W. Steinert P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18060-18066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The PCR product was digested with PstI and XbaI and cloned into the pCAT-Basic vector, which contains the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene but does not have any eukaryotic regulatory elements (Promega, Madison, WI). To obtain a series of deletion constructs, the pCAT(−1370/+9) construct was subjected to the following digestion:HindIII digestion, which eliminated a 415-bp fragment and generated the pCAT (−955/+9) construct. This construct was further digested with HindIII/BglII,HindIII/BspHI, orHindIII/SacI to generate the CAT constructs containing fragments spanning the region of −370/+9, −154/+9, and −45/+9, respectively. The pCAT(−112/+9) construct was obtained by PCR using 5′-AActgcagACAGCCACGGGTCACGT-3′ paired with the same reverse primer used above. For the pCAT (−67/+9) construct, the pCAT (−154/+9) was digested with both EcoRII andHindIII, blunt-ended, and cloned into the pCAT-Basic vector. All constructs were purified by 2× CsCl2 banding and confirmed by DNA sequencing. All experiments were performed using at least two different batches of plasmid preparation. Mutations of functional elements in the loricrin promoter were made in the pCAT (−150/+9) construct using the QuikChange method (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Mutations of desired sequences (underlined) are as follows: Sp1 site (GGGATAAGGGGC), AP2-like site (GCCGACATTTACG), and AP1 site (ATTTGTCAG). To construct the pCAT (−150/+9)-Gal4 plasmid, the sequences between −130 and −110 were replaced with a Gal4 binding site, 5′-GCGGAGTACTGTCCTCCGA-3′ (27Sadovsky Y. Webb P. Lopez G. Baxter J.D. Fitzpatrick P.M. Gizang-Ginsburg E. Cavilles V. Parker M.G. Kushner P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1554-1563Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For this substitution, the QuikChange protocol was modified as follows. The first two PCR cycles of synthesis were performed in two separate tubes containing either the plus or minus strand of an oligonucleotide carrying Gal4 binding sequences, together with the template andPfu polymerase. Both reactions were then mixed together, and PCR was continued for another 25 cycles before DpnI digestion as suggested by manufacturer. All of the mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Cryopreserved NHEK cells and primary normal human fibroblasts (NHF) were purchased from Clonetics (San Diego, CA). NHEK cells were seeded in calf skin collagen (Sigma)-coated dishes, and the cultures were maintained in serum-free keratinocyte growth medium (KGM-2; Clonetics) with 0.05 mm calcium. NHF cells were grown and maintained in FGM-2 medium (Clonetics) supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum. The third passage of NHEK and NHF cultures were used for transfection experiments and preparation of cellular and nuclear extracts. HEK-293, A431, COS-7, HeLa, and NIH-3T3 cells were purchased from American Tissue Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and were grown and maintained using the recommended procedures. HaCaT cells were a gift from Dr. Norbert E. Fusening and were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 4.5 g/liter glucose, 10% fetal bovine serum, and nonessential amino acids (Invitrogen). Cells were seeded on six-well plates 24 h prior to transfection. Transient transfections were performed in duplicate using FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for NHEK, NHF, HaCaT, HeLa, A-431, cells, or LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen) for HEK-293, COS-7, and NIH-3T3 cells as recommended by the manufacturers. Typically, transfections were done when cultures reached 60–70% confluence. For NHEK and NHF transfections, cell cultures were washed once at 37 °C with warm phosphate-buffered saline and then were preincubated at 37 °C for 30 min with either Keratinocyte-SFM (Invitrogen) for NHEK, HaCaT, and NHF cells or Opti-MEM I medium (Invitrogen) for A-431, HeLa, HEK-293, COS-7, and NIH-3T3 cells. For each well, 1.0 μg of reporter plasmids and 0.5 μg of tk-β-gal plasmid were mixed with 6 μg of either FuGENE 6 or LipofectAMINE Plus in Keratinocyte-SFM and incubated for 20 min at 23 °C. The lipid/DNA mixture was then added into each well and incubated for 16–18 h in the case of the NHEK, NHF, or HaCaT cells or 4–6 h for other cell types. At the end of the transfection period, the medium was replaced with the fresh medium in which the cells normally grow. For NHEK cells, unless indicated, all cultures were maintained in KGM-2 medium containing 1.2 mm calcium. Forskolin (10 μm; Calbiochem) was dissolved in Me2SO and added into cultures after the transfection was terminated. The control samples were treated with Me2SO (<0.1%, v/v) alone. Cells were harvested 48 h post-transfection. Cellular extracts were prepared as described by Pothier et al. (28Pothier F. Ouellet M. Julien J.-P. Guerin S. DNA Cell Biol. 1992; 11: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). CAT assay, β-galactosidase assay, and total protein measurements were performed as previously described (23Jang S.-I. Steinert P.M. Markova N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24105-24114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The values for CAT were normalized by protein content and the β-galactosidase activity. Unless indicated, all of the data are the averages of at least three independent experiments with duplicated samples. For co-transfection experiments, typically 1 μg of loricrin CAT constructs were co-transfected with 0.5 μg of expression vector as indicated. The corresponding parent vectors were used to ensure the same total amount of plasmid in each sample. All expression vectors employed in this study include pRSV-c-Jun (from Dr. M. Karin) and c-Jun TAM under the control of cytomegalovirus promoter (a gift from Dr. M. Birrer). The Gal4/Sp1 expression vectors used were generously provided by Dr. R. Tjian (University of California, Berkeley, CA) and are pSG424 (parent vector), pSG-Sp1Wt (containing Sp1 amino acid residues 83–778, which include domains A–D), pSG-Sp1N (containing domains A–C, amino acid residues 83–621), pSG-Sp1A&B (containing domains A and B, amino acid residues 83–542), and pSG-Sp1B (containing domain B, amino acid residues 263–542). All of these vectors contain cDNA encoding the Gal4 binding domain, amino acids 1–147 of the Gal4 protein, which were driven by an SV40 promoter (29Gill G. Pascal E. Tseng Z.H. Tjian R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 192-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). The pCMV-Sp3 and pCMV-Sp3/DBD, in which the 168 C-terminal codons of Sp3 were removed, were gifts generously provided by Dr. G. Suske. The pCMVβp300-CHA was kindly provided by Dr. S. Grossman and contains a p300 cDNA insert from nucleotides 1134–8329 with a C-terminal HA tag cloned into the pCI vector. The expression plasmids of pRc/RSV-CBP.HA.RK, pRc/RSV-mCREB-341, pRc/RSV-CREMα, and pRc/RSV-KCREB were kindly provided by Dr. R. Goodman. The pSKG4 plasmid was a gift from Dr. S. K. Hanks and contains the cDNA of the human protein kinase A (PKA) type α catalytic subunit driven by the CMV promoter. The pECE/ATF-1 expression plasmids under control of the SV40 promoter and enhancer were obtained from Dr. M. Green. The expression vector pRSV-AP2α was kindly provided by Dr. R. Tjian. The pRSV-AP2β and pRSV-AP2γ were gifts from Dr. H. C. Hurst. Nuclear extracts from NHEK, NHF, and HeLa cells were prepared as previously described (23Jang S.-I. Steinert P.M. Markova N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24105-24114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The cytosolic fractions were obtained after the cells were homogenized with a tightly fitting glass homogenizer and centrifuged at 3000 ×g in a refrigerated microcentrifuge for 10 min. Supernatants were used for gel shift assays. Forskolin-treated NHEK cells were grown in high calcium KGM-2 medium for 4 days and treated with forskolin (50 μm) for 6 h before harvesting. All buffers also contained phosphatase inhibitors: sodium vanadate (200 μm), sodium fluoride (10 mm), and okadaic acid (2 nm). The double-stranded oligonucleotide probes were end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP and then purified on 6% TBE gels (Invitrogen). Mobility shift experiments were performed as previously described (24Lee J.-H. Jang S.-I. Yang J.-M. Markova N.G. Steinert P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4561-4568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). For supershift experiments, the nuclear extracts were first incubated with 2 μg of the corresponding commercially available antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) for 2 h at 4 °C and then treated with the probe for another 30 min. The complexes were resolved on nondenaturing 6% polyacrylamide gels in 0.5× TBE for 1 h at 14 V/cm. The gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film (Bio-Max MR, Eastman Kodak Co.) with an intensifying screen at −80 °C overnight. For Western immunoblot analysis on the expression of pCMV-Sp3, 10 μg of nuclear extracts from the transfected NHEK were fractionated on 4–12% gradient Tris-glycine gels and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Invitrogen). After transfer, the membranes were washed once in 1× Tris-buffered saline (TBS), pH 7.5, and then incubated in blocking buffer (1× TBS, 0.1% Tween 20, 5% nonfat dry milk) for 1 h at 23 °C. The membranes were washed three times for 5 min each with 1× TBS/T (1× TBS, 0.1% Tween 20) and then incubated with a 1:1000 dilution of either c-Jun or Sp3 polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in blocking buffer for 1 h at 23 °C. Membranes were then washed three times with 1× TBS/T and incubated with a 1:2000 dilution of the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Bio-Rad) in blocking buffer for 1 h at 23 °C. Following three washes with 1× TBS/T, signals were detected by using the SuperSignal West Pico Luminol/Enhancer kit (Pierce) and the manufacturer's protocol prior to exposure to x-ray film. In a previous study, we reported that an AP1 motif located 55 bp upstream of the cap site (position −55) is essential for the activity of the loricrin promoter in NHEK cells (25Rossi A. Jang S-I. Ceci R. Steinert P.M. Markova N.G. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1998; 110: 34-40Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Using cultured keratinocytes (18DiSepio D. Bickenbach J. Longley M.A. Bundman D. Rothnagel J.A. Roop D.R. Differentiation. 1995; 64: 225-235Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and a transgenic mouse approach, DiSepio et al. (17DiSepio D. Jones A. Longley M.A. Bundman D. Rothnagel J.A. Roop D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10792-10799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) showed that an AP1 site situated in the proximal promoter region is likewise critical for the expression of the mouse loricrin gene. However, it is highly unlikely that the tight control of the loricrin transcription is determined solely by interactions over the AP1 motif. Thus, the aim of the present study is to further elucidate the recognition sequences and their cognate binding factors that modulate the AP1-dependent activity of the human loricrin promoter. A series of fragments spanning increasing lengths of the 5′ regulatory region were cloned into the pCAT-Basic vector and their activities assessed after transfection into NHEK cells (Fig.1). The highest activity was detected with construct −67/+9, which encompasses the loricrin TATA box and the AP1 site. In accordance with our previous results (25Rossi A. Jang S-I. Ceci R. Steinert P.M. Markova N.G. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1998; 110: 34-40Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), deletion of the AP1 site caused a 10-fold reduction of expression. The addition of 45 bp of upstream sequences (−112/+9) reduced the CAT expression by 40%, 87 bp (construct −154/+9) reduced by 70%, and more sequences out to −450 reduced the expression to the level of the basal promoter (construct −45/+9, which encompasses only the TATA box). Such reductions of promoter activity could not be overcome by extension of the regulatory region to −1370. The loricrin constructs tested in this study gave similar results when NHEK cells were maintained under high calcium conditions (data not shown). Thus, this region does not encompass presumed calcium-responsive regulatory elements. To assess whether these sequences functioned in a cell type-specific mode, the constructs were transfected into a variety of cells (TableI). The promoter activity of construct −45/+9 was comparable in all cell types (data not shown) and was about 15–20% of the level of the pCAT-Promoter construct containing the SV-40 early promoter (23Jang S.-I. Steinert P.M. Markova N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24105-24114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Inclusion of the AP1 site (construct −67/+9) resulted in a 9-fold enhancement in NHEK and HaCaT cells and about 5-fold enhancement in HeLa cells, which, although transformed, have preserved some features of their squamous cell origin (30Blumenberg M. Connolly D.M. Freedberg I.M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1992; 98: S42-S49Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In contrast, this construct showed only basal promoter activity in simple epithelial and nonepithelial cells, consistent with the notion that the AP1 site is involved in cell type specificity of loricrin expression. Interestingly, mutation of the AP2-like site (keratinocyte-specific silencer element (KSSE); see below) showed a 3-fold increase over that of construct −154/+9 for both NHEK and HaCaT cells but not in HeLa or other cell types. This suggests that the KSSE site is involved in keratinocyte-specific repression of the loricrin promoter. These results also indicate that as few as 67 bp upstream of the transcription initiation site may be sufficient to restrict the activity of the human loricrin promoter to stratified squamous epithelial cells. Elements residing between −67 and −450 participate in the regulation of loricrin promoter activity and are further studied in detail here.Table IExpression of the loricrin constructs in different cell typesCell typeLoricrin constructs−450/+9−154/+9−154/+9(KSSE)−67/+9Keratinocyte cellsNHEKaData from NHEK cells under high calcium condition (1.2 mm) are shown.1.2 ± 0.14.2 ± 0.414.5 ± 1.28.8 ± 0.4HaCaT1.5 ± 0.24.0 ± 0.313.2 ± 0.89.0 ± 0.5Stratified squamous epithelial cellsHeLa1.1 ± 0.12.2 ± 0.32.0 ± 0.35.0 ± 0.7A4311.2 ± 0.22.0 ± 0.42.2 ± 0.21.8 ± 0.2Epithelial cellsHEK-2930.8 ± 0.12.0 ± 0.33.1 ± 0.21.1 ± 0.3COS-71.5 ± 0.12.1 ± 0.22.5 ± 0.32.0 ± 0.4Nonepithelial cellsNHF1.1 ± 0.11.2 ± 0.12.8 ± 0.41.2 ± 0.2NIH 3T31.2 ± 0.22.1 ± 0.13.0 ± 0.21.2 ± 0.1The relative CAT expression of the five loricrin constructs were normalized with the activity of tk-β-gal construct and are expressed as -fold change over the basal promoter activity of the loricrin construct −45/+9, which was comparable in all cell types studied.a Data from NHEK cells under high calcium condition (1.2 mm) are shown.

Initially, we focused our studies on the region between −67 and −154, which was responsible for a 2-fold repression of the loricrin proximal promoter. Comparison of these sequences with transcription factor databases (31Heinemeyer T. Wingender E. Reuter I. Hermjakob H. Kel A.E. Kel O.V. Ignatieva E.V. Ananko E.A. Podkolodnaya O.A. Kolpakov F.A.

Therefore, we first explored the ability of these motifs to interact with nuclear proteins using gel shift experiments. The specificity of the interaction was verified in competition experiments with unlabeled oligonucleotides carrying wild type or mutated sequences from this region or with dI/dC oligomers. A double-stranded oligonucleotide (−132/−90) encompassing the potential Sp1, AP2-like, and CRE-like sites (Fig.2 A) was labeled and incubated with nuclear extracts from NHEK cells. Four specific DNA-protein complexes (Fig. 2 B, lane 1) were observed. Specific competition with unlabeled probe abolished complexes A, B, and D and reduced the intensity of complex C (Fig. 2 B,lane 2). The origin of complexes A–D was determined in competition experiments with an array of oligomers in which three bp mutations had been created within the putative Sp1, AP2-like, and CRE-like recognition motifs. Mutant B1 competed out complexes A and B (lane 3). Mutants B2, B3, and B4, which affected the Sp1 motif, failed to interfere with the formation of complexes A and B (lanes 4–6). Mutants of the putative AP2-like motif (B4–B7) did not interfere with complex C (lanes 6–9). The competition for complex D was prevented by the mutants B1, B2, B4, B5, B6, and B11, where the CRE-like site was located (lanes 3,4, 6, 7, 8, and13). Taken together, these results demonstrate that complexes A and B originate from interactions"

In the yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae, heat stress has been shown to activate de novo biosynthesis of sphingolipids, whereas in mammalian cells the sphingolipid ceramide has been implicated in the heat shock responses. In the current study, we found an increase in the ceramide mass of Molt-4 cells in response to heat shock, corroborating findings in HL-60 cells. Increased ceramide was determined to be fromde novo biosynthesis by two major lines of evidence. First, the accumulation of ceramide was dependent upon the activities of both ceramide synthase and serine palmitoyltransferase. Second, pulse labeling studies demonstrated increased production of ceramide through the de novo biosynthetic pathway. Significantly, thede novo sphingolipid biosynthetic pathway was acutely induced upon heat shock, which resulted in a 2-fold increased flux in newly made ceramides within 1–2 min of exposure to 42.5 °C. Functionally, heat shock induced the dephosphorylation of the SR proteins, and this effect was demonstrated to be dependent upon the accumulation of de novo-produced ceramides.

Cells respond to heat shock in a variety of ways; most prominent is the change in their pattern of gene expression resulting in the production of a specific subset of proteins termed heat shock proteins (1Lindquist S. Craig E.A. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1988; 22: 631-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (4420) Google Scholar). Many of the heat shock proteins produced upon heat shock function as chaperon proteins acting in the transport, assembly, and proper folding of proteins that ultimately affect survival of the cell (2Georgopoulos C. Welch W.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 601-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar). However, prolonged exposure to heat shock conditions will result in either apoptosis or necrosis of mammalian cells (3Pirkkala L. Nykanen P. Sistonen L. FASEB. J. 2001; 15: 1118-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar). Sphingolipids have been implicated as bioactive molecules in mammalian cells; specifically, ceramide has been shown to have roles in differentiation (4Tanaka H. Abe E. Miyaura C. Kuribayashi T.

Science. 1996; 274: 1855-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1498) Google Scholar). The accumulation of ceramide has been shown in response to heat shock in HL-60 (8Kondo T. Matsuda T. Kitano T. Takahashi A.

A. 1995; 92: 12275-12279Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In NIH WT-3T3 cellsN-acetylsphingosine (C2-ceramide) was proposed as an inducer of αB-crystallin transcription, possibly mirroring the effect of heat shock-produced ceramides in vivo (10Chang Y. Abe A. Shayman J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12275-12279Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Furthermore, C2-ceramide was shown to suppress heat-induced heat shock protein 70 production in HL-60 cells (9Kondo T. Matsuda T. Tashima M. Umehara H. Domae N. Yokoyama K. Uchiyama T. Okazaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8872-8879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Also in HL-60 cells, the production of endogenous ceramide was shown to have a role in expression of c-jun/c-fos and activation of caspase-3, resulting in apoptosis of these cells upon heat shock. The source of the ceramide upon heat shock of HL-60 was proposed to derive from the hydrolysis of sphingomyelin through heat shock activation of the sphingomyelin cycle (8Kondo T. Matsuda T. Kitano T. Takahashi A. Tashima M. Ishikura H. Umehara H. Domae N. Uchiyama T. Okazaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7668-7676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In contrast to the sphingomyelin-derived production of ceramide is the yeast heat stress model. Production of phytoceramide and dihydroceramide in yeast heat stress has been determined to arise primarily through de novo biosynthesis (11Jenkins G.M. Richards A. Wahl T. Mao C. Obeid L. Hannun Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32566-32572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 12Wells G.B. Dickson R.C. Lester R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7235-7243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). De novo biosynthesis starts with the activity of serine palmitoyltransferase, which condenses palmitoyl-CoA and serine to form keto-dihydrosphingosine. The keto-dihydrosphingosine is subsequently converted into dihydrosphingosine. The dihydrosphingosine is then acted upon by a (dihydro) ceramide synthase, catalyzing the addition of a fatty acid to the free amine of the sphingoid base. Moreover, the accumulation of ceramide in response to etoposide has been described to arise through de novo biosynthesis in Molt-4 leukemic lymphocytes (13Perry D.K. Carton J. Shah A.K. Meredith F. Uhlinger D.J. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9078-9084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Other examples of de novobiosynthesis of ceramides have been shown to occur in response to receptor cross-linking in B cells (14Kroesen B.J. Pettus B. Luberto C. Busman M. Sietsma H. de Leij L.

Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 5102-5105PubMed Google Scholar) among others. Furthermore, a recent link has also been made between the Fas-induced de novobiosynthesis of ceramide and the dephosphorylation of SR proteins, which form a family of proteins containing serine/arginine domains that regulate mRNA splicing (17Chalfant C.E. Ogretmen B. Galadari S.H. Kroesen Bj B. Pettus B.J. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44848-44855Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In light of the yeast heat stress findings, we investigated heat-shocked Molt-4 cells for an increase in ceramide and the possible role of de novo biosynthesis. The results of the current study show an accumulation of ceramide in Molt-4 cells with heat shock before the cells die or commit to apoptosis. The increased ceramide was found to arise primarily from an acute activation of de novobiosynthesis. Furthermore, heat shock-induced dephosphorylation of the SR proteins and the de novo production of ceramide was required for this dephosphorylation. These results demonstrate an evolutionary conservation of regulation of the acute activation of thede novo sphingolipid pathway between yeast and human cells in response to heat shock. Moreover, the studies corroborate a specific role for this pathway in regulation of SR proteins. Molt-4 acute leukemic lymphocytes and mAb104 (phospho-SR protein antibody) hybridoma cells were from ATCC (Manassas, VA). Myriocin was from Sigma. Fumonisin B1 was from Alexis Corp. Tritiated palmitate (9,10-3H) was from ARC. ENHANCE was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. PARP1 antibody was from Santa Cruz Biochem. Trypan blue was from BioWhittaker. Human Molt-4 acute leukemic lymphocyte cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Experimental studies were performed by diluting exponentially growing cells to 5 × 105 cells/ml in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. Samples rested for 2 h before treatment. Inhibitor studies were done with a 1-h preincubation of inhibitor after resting for 2 h. Samples were then split into controls (37 °C) and heat-shocked samples (42.5 °C). Cells were taken at the indicated time points from cultures at 37 and 42.5 °C and diluted into trypan blue solution. Both trypan blue negative and positive cells were counted, and the percent of alive cells was determined. Cells (2.5 × 106) were collected by centrifugation (500 ×g). The resultant pelleted cells were lysed in chloroform:methanol (1:2), and lipids were extracted by the method of Bligh and Dyer (18Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42913) Google Scholar). The organic lipid extract was split into three equal aliquots. One aliquot was used to determine the organic phosphate of each sample, and the result was used to normalize the ceramide measurements. Another aliquot was used in the ceramide mass measurement previously described (19Liu B. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16281-16287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar) using diacylglycerol kinase assay and thin layer chromatography (TLC) separation. For quantification, the plates were subsequently exposed to a phosphorimaging screen, scanned, and subsequently analyzed using ImageQuant. The other third of lipid was used for mass spectrometric analysis of ceramides by normal phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled to atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (14Kroesen B.J. Pettus B. Luberto C. Busman M. Sietsma H. de Leij L. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13606-13614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Briefly, separations were conducted using Iatrobead (Iatron Laboratories, Tokyo, Japan)-beaded silica columns utilized in a normal phase of operation. All mass spectrometric analyses were conducted on a Finnigan (Foster City, CA) LCQ ion trap mass spectrometer. For atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI)-mass spectrometry, the entire flow from the HPLC column was directed to the APCI source. Adjustments were made to allow for identification of ceramide and dihydroceramide subspecies by combination of mass, intensity ratios in the mass spectrometry fragmentation pattern, and column retention. Additionally, no ion-suppressive matrix effects were observed. Calibration curves with synthetic standards showed equal ionization and thermal fragmentation of ceramide species from 40 fmol to 3500 pmol, regardless of fatty acid length. Cells (5 × 106) were collected by centrifugation (500 ×g). Lipids were extracted as above and split into two aliquots, one-third for phosphate measurement and two-thirds for sphingoid base measurement. The measurement of sphingoid bases was performed as previously described (11Jenkins G.M. Richards A. Wahl T. Mao C. Obeid L. Hannun Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32566-32572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 20Merrill Jr., A.H. Wang E. Mullins R.E. Jamison W.C. Nimkar S. Liotta D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 171: 373-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) Samples were compared by use of the nonendogenous sphingoid basel-threo-dihydrosphingosine as an internal standard added before lipid extraction and normalized to total organic phosphate. Samples were seeded as noted in tissue culture, and then after the indicated pretreatments, they were labeled with 1 μCi/ml tritiated palmitate and incubated at either 37 or 42.5 °C for the given length of time. Cells (2.5 × 106) were collected by centrifugation (500 ×g) and washed once with water. Lipids were extracted as above and split into two aliquots, one- third for lipid phosphate measurement and two-thirds for sphingolipid analysis. Mild alkaline hydrolysis was performed on the aliquot for sphingolipid analysis. Lipids were then re-extracted as previously described (20Merrill Jr., A.H. Wang E. Mullins R.E. Jamison W.C. Nimkar S. Liotta D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 171: 373-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Base-hydrolyzed lipids were then resuspended in chloroform:methanol:water (1:2:0.1) and spotted on a TLC plate. Lipids were developed in a solvent system of chloroform, methanol, 2n NH4OH (4:1:0.1). Plates were dried, sprayed with ENHANCE, and exposed to film for 3 days. Where indicated bands of ceramide were scraped and analyzed by scintillation counting to obtain data for the percent of time-matched controls. Microsomes were prepared by sonication of cell pellets from Molt-4 cells in 25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride containing 20 μg/ml chymotrypsin, leupeptin, antipain, and pepstatin. The preparation was centrifuged at 1000 ×g, and the resulting supernatant was then ultracentrifuged at 100,000 × g. The resultant pellet was suspended by homogenization in 25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, buffer containing 30% glycerol to form microsomes for the assays. Protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad dye binding reagents with a standard curve of bovine serum albumin. Serine palmitoyltransferase activity was determined using microsome fractions isolated from heat-shocked and control cells essentially as described (21Dickson R.C. Lester R.L. Nagiec M.M. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 311: 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In brief, 100 μg of microsomal protein was incubated at 37 °C with shaking in 100 mm HEPES, pH 8.3, containing 5 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μmpyridoxal-5′-phosphate, 5 mm [3H]serine (30,000 cpm/nmol), and 200 μm palmitoyl CoA in a total volume of 200 μl. After 20 min, reactions were stopped by the addition of 1.5 ml of CHCl3:CH3OH (1:2). Unlabeled sphingosine was added as carrier, and a phase separation was induced by the addition of 1 ml of CHCl3 and 2 ml of 0.5n NH4OH. The aqueous phase was removed, and the organic phase was washed two times with water. The resultant organic phase was dried under N2, and the extract was counted by liquid scintillation. Control experiments were performed to confirm the protein and palmitoyl CoA dependence of the reactions as well as to establish conditions showing linearity with time and protein concentration. Furthermore, the in vitro serine palmitoyltransferase activities were inhibitable by addition of myriocin to the assay. Ceramide synthase activity was also determined for the microsome fractions essentially as described (22Wang E. Merrill Jr., A.H. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 311: 15-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In short, 200 μg of microsomal protein was incubated in 25 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, containing 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 200 μm palmitoyl CoA, and 100 μm [3H]sphingosine (50–100,000 cpm/nmol) delivered in phosphatidylcholine vesicles prepared by sonication. Incubations were performed for 20 min at 37 °C and were stopped by the addition of 1 ml of CH3OH and vortexing followed by the addition of 1.5 ml of CHCl3, 50 μg of cold ceramide as carrier, and 3 ml of water. Samples were vortexed and centrifuged to separate the phases. The aqueous phase was removed, and the organic phase was washed 2 times with 3 ml of slightly basic water, passed over an anhydrous sodium sulfate column prepared in a Pasteur pipette, and dried under N2. Analysis was done by dissolving samples in a small volume of CHCl3:CH3OH (2:1) and spotting onto silica TLC plates. Sphingosine and ceramide were spotted as standards. TLC plates were developed in CHCl3, CH3OH, 4 nNH4OH (40:10:0.1), and cold standards were visualized by iodine exposure. Plates were sprayed with ENHANCE and exposed to film. The areas corresponding to the cold ceramide and sphingosine spots were scraped and counted by liquid scintillation. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (500 × g) and washed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Proteins were extracted by direct lysis using Laemmli buffer (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207286) Google Scholar) then were separated on 7.5% gels by SDS-PAGE and electrophoretically transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (24Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44929) Google Scholar). Blots were blocked with 5% dried milk in 1× phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 and then incubated with anti-PARP antibody at 1:1000. Bands were developed using the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECLAmersham Biosciences) detection system. The SR proteins were separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred as above to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were treated as described (17Chalfant C.E. Ogretmen B. Galadari S.H. Kroesen Bj B. Pettus B.J. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44848-44855Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Molt-4 cells were exposed to heat shock of 42.5 °C and compared with time-matched controls grown at the normal temperature of 37 °C in the trypan blue exclusion assay. Heat shock for 4.5 h caused only 7.6% of the Molt-4 cells to die as compared with 5% of control cells. By 8.5 h of treatment, 20% of cells were dead. To determine whether the cells were already committed for the apoptotic program at earlier time points, PARP cleavage was determined by Western blotting. PARP is considered an early marker for the activation of the execution caspases, especially caspase 3. A small amount of the cleaved fragment could be discerned beginning at the 1-h time point and extending to the 4-h time point as compared with time-matched controls (Fig. 1). These results corroborate the previous finding that short term exposure of SKT6 mouse erythroleukemia cells to 42 °C for up to 6 h resulted in minimal caspase-3 activation, no DNA fragmentation, and little cell death (28Nagata Y. Todokoro K. Blood. 1999; 94: 853-863Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The total ceramide mass of heat-shocked cells was measured over a time course of up to 4 h and compared with time-matched controls. Total ceramide mass showed a small increase at 30 min (120.6 ± 10.8%), rising to a 2-fold increase at 2 h (199.5 ± 38.8%), and then to ∼2.5-fold by 4 h (261.3 ± 40.1%) (Fig.2 A). Therefore, heat shock increased the total ceramide mass in a time-dependent manner. Total ceramides, as measured by the diacylglycerol kinase assay, are composed of a number of specific molecular species of both ceramide and dihydroceramide. The specificity of ceramide molecular species accounting for the heat-increased mass was determined using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis. The dihydroceramide species showed little or no increases upon heat shock for 2 h (Fig.2 B). The ceramide species showed increases with C18:0, C22:0, and C24:1 showing modest changes; however, the predominant form of ceramide at both temperatures was the C16:0 form (Fig. 2 C), which increased nearly 2-fold upon heat shock for 2 h. These data indicate that a heterogeneous mixture of ceramide molecular species are increased upon heat shock and that the C16:0 ceramide accounted for the majority of the increased ceramide mass observed in heat-shocked Molt-4 cells. We next investigated the source of increased ceramide mass in response to heat shock. The previous finding of the de novo production of ceramide upon heat stress in yeast and the accumulation of C16:0 ceramide as the predominant species increased with heat shock, raised the possibility of activation of thede novo pathway. Therefore, we determined if the ceramide synthase inhibitor, fumonisin B1, could block the mass accumulation. Preincubation of Molt-4 cells with 100 μm fumonisin B1 for 1 h completely inhibited the >2-fold increase of total ceramide mass (Fig. 3 A) at 2 h. These results led us to consider if the accumulation of ceramides required serine palmitoyltransferase activity. Preincubation of Molt-4 cells with the serine palmitoyltransferase inhibitor, myriocin, at 50 nm for 1 h also completely inhibited the increased mass of total cellular ceramide (Fig. 3 A). Analysis of the molecular species of total ceramides was performed to elucidate if only one particular species was produced through the activity of ceramide synthase and/or serine palmitoyltransferase. Fig.3 B shows that both pretreatment with myriocin or fumonisin B1 blocked the increases seen in C16:0, C18:0, C22:0, and C24:1 ceramides. Taken together these data indicate that the aforementioned increased levels of ceramide derive initially through serine palmitoyltransferase activity and subsequent fatty acid addition by ceramide synthase. The findings are thus consistent with the production of ceramide via de novo biosynthesis. Due to de novobiosynthesis activation, the mass of the endogenous sphingoid bases, sphingosine and dihydrosphingosine, was determined upon heat shock of Molt-4 cells. Overall, neither sphingosine nor dihydrosphingosine levels showed accumulation or loss during the 15-min to 2-h time course evaluated (data not shown). To directly assess the role of de novo sphingolipid biosynthesis in cells, Molt-4 cells were pulse-labeled with tritiated palmitate. A portion of the palmitate is converted to palmitoyl-CoAin vivo and may be condensed with serine to form keto-dihydrosphingosine through the activity of serine palmitoyltransferase. Alternatively, palmitoyl-CoA may be directlyN-linked onto a sphingoid base as the fatty acid attached by ceramide synthase forming C16:0 ceramide. The bands labeled in Fig. 4 A were identified using the following criteria. First, the total lipid extract was subjected to mild alkaline hydrolysis to which most glycerolipids are susceptible, whereas the sphingolipids are resistant. Next, each identified band co-migrated with known standards of the indicated compound. Finally, fumonisin B1 and myriocin pretreatment blocked the incorporation of tritiated palmitate into complex sphingolipids such as ceramide, cerebrosides, sphingomyelin, and gangliosides (Fig.5).Figure 5Regulation and involvement of de novo ceramides upon heat shock. A, effects of fumonisin B1 on accumulation of ceramide. Molt-4 cells were preincubated with either 0, 50, or 100 μm fumonisin B1 (FB1) 1 h before treatment at 37 °C (Control) or 42.5 °C (HS) for 2 h. Immediately before incubation at 37 °C or 42.5 °C, cells were pulse-labeled with 1 μCi/ml tritiated palmitate (9,10-3H). Organic lipids were extracted, base-hydrolyzed, and separated on TLC. Plates were sprayed with ENHANCE and then exposed to film. Band designations were determined as noted in the text (under “Results”). Data are representative of more then three experiments. B, effects of myriocin on accumulation of ceramide. Molt-4 cells were preincubated with or without 50 nm myriocin (Myr) 1 h before treatment at 37 °C (Cont) or 42.5 °C (HS). Extraction and analysis were done as above. C, determination ofin vitro serine palmitoyltransferase activity. Membrane proteins were isolated from heat-shocked Molt-4 cells at the times given. 100 μg of extracted membrane protein was used to determine thein vitro serine palmitoyltransferase activity using [3H]serine as the label. Reactions were run for 20 min, and product was extracted, washed, and counted. Data presented are the averages of four separate experiments. keto-dhsph, keto-dihydrosphingosine. The standard error is shown for each time point. D, determination of in vitro ceramide synthase activity. 200 μg of extracted membrane protein was used to determine the in vitro ceramide synthase activity. The conversion of [3H]sphingosine to ceramide was determined as the percent of precursor converted. Data presented are the average of 4 separate experiments, except the 30-min time point isn = 3. The S.E. is shown for each time point.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The initial labeling product accumulated with palmitate labeling was ceramide (Fig. 4 A). The possible intermediates of keto-dihydrosphingosine and dihydrosphingosine were not detected in the control or treated cells, correlating with the lack of accumulation of sphingoid bases. The incorporation of palmitate into ceramide continued to increase from 10 to 120 min (Fig. 4 A) with no changes in the amount of palmitate taken up by heat-shocked cells as compared with controls. Expectedly, the de novo-produced ceramides in control cells were further incorporated into cerebrosides, sphingomyelin, and gangliosides starting at the 30-min time point and increasing through the time course. Somewhat unexpectedly, heat shock resulted in the augmentation of incorporation of palmitate into the complex sphingolipids, suggesting that heat shock induced an increase in the flux throughout the de novo pathway. The finding of significant accumulation of newly made ceramides at the 10-min time point led us to investigate the rapidity of the up-regulation of production of de novo ceramides upon heat shock. Therefore, cells were labeled and immediately immersed into a heated water bath for 1, 2, or 5 min and compared with cells left at 37 °C. Within 1 min of heat shock there was an increased incorporation of palmitate label into ceramide (175%) that continued to increase at 2-min (260%) and 5-min (285%) time points as compared with controls (Fig. 4 B). To delineate the source of the labeled ceramide produced upon heat shock, the inhibitors of ceramide synthase and serine palmitoyltransferase were used in the palmitate-labeling studies. Pretreatment of 1 h with 100 μm fumonisin B1 caused a nearly complete inhibition of the newly synthesized ceramide along with the complex sphingolipids (Fig. 5 A). These data show that accumulation of ceramide with the palmitate label proceeds through the fumonisin B1-inhibitable ceramide synthase(s). Pretreatment of Molt-4 cells with 50 nm myriocin blocked most of the incorporation of the palmitate into ceramide formed upon heat shock (Fig. 5 B). Comparable with fumonisin B1 inhibition, myriocin inhibition also blocked the incorporation of palmitate label into the complex sphingolipids. Thus, heat shock induces the production of de novo ceramide, requiring both ceramide synthase and serine palmitoyltransferase activity. The finding of the production of newly made ceramides upon heat shock led to the determination of the in vitro enzymatic activities for serine palmitoyltransferase and ceramide synthase. Measurement of serine palmitoyltransferase activity (Fig.5 C) showed essentially no increased activity for microsomal protein harvested after 2.5 min (5.95 ± 0.69 pmol of keto-dihydrosphingosine/min/mg of protein), 5 min (5.32 ± 1.03 pmol of keto-dihydrosphingosine/min/mg of protein), and 10 min (4.65 ± 1.06 pmol of keto-dihydrosphingosine/min/mg of protein) of heat shock as compared with the 0-min control (5.18 ± 0.71 pmol of keto-dihydrosphingosine/min/mg of protein). The in vitro ceramide synthase activity (Fig. 5 D) for the microsomes was determined to be 224 ± 31 pmol of ceramide/min/mg of protein for the 0-min control. Protein extracted from heat-shocked cells at the 10 (246 ± 14 pmol of ceramide/min/mg of protein)-, 30 (298 ± 68 pmol of ceramide/min/mg of protein)-, and 60 (225 ± 61 pmol of ceramide/min/mg protein)-min time points displayed essentially no increase of the in vitro ceramide synthase activity. Both sets of data showed no increased activity for the extracted proteins in the in vitro assays, ruling out induction of the proteins or post-translational modification as mechanisms of activation. Given the lack of significant cell death in this model system, we concentrated on specific downstream effects that could be mediated by ceramide. The accumulation of newly made ceramides was recently shown to result in the dephosphorylation of SR proteins (17Chalfant C.E. Ogretmen B. Galadari S.H. Kroesen Bj B. Pettus B.J. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44848-44855Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), and this effect was evaluated in our system. The proteins SR75p, SR55p, and Tra2p were dephosphorylated by 1 h of exposure to 42.5 °C (Fig. 6), coinciding with the initial ceramide mass accumulation (Fig.2 A). The SR proteins continued to be in their dephosphorylated state at the 2-h time point (Fig. 6 A). Pretreatment with 50 nm myriocin inhibited the dephosphorylation of the SR proteins at both 1 and 2 h of heat shock (Fig. 6 A). Furthermore, SR protein dephosphorylation was also inhibited by fumonisin B1 pretreatment (Fig. 6 B) at the 2-h time point. These data show that the induction of de novo ceramides mediated the dephosphorylation of the SR proteins in heat-shocked Molt-4 cells. Heat shock induced an increase in total ceramide mass, and two major lines of evidence from this study strongly suggest that the bulk of the increased levels of ceramides was produced through the de novo biosynthetic pathway. First, the activities of both ceramide synthase and serine palmitoyltransferase were required for ceramide accumulation. If only the ceramide synthase inhibitor fumonisin B1 had inhibited the increased mass of ceramide, these data would have indicated blocking of the recycling/salvage pathway, which could have been consistent with the breakdown of sphingomyelin. However, the inhibition observed with fumonisin B1 and myriocin demonstratedde novo biosynthesis, since myriocin inhibits serine palmitoyltransferase activity. Second, heat shock induced an acute activation of the production of de novo ceramides as determined by pulse labeling studies (Fig. 4). Indeed, the exposure of Molt-4 cells to 42.5 °C exerted an almost immediate induction of the sphingolipid biosynthetic pathway. The induction observed at 1 min is the most acute that has been described to date in relation to enzymes of sphingolipid metabolism, especially those involved in de novo biosynthesis. The heat shock-induced mechanisms regulating the flux through the sphingolipid biosynthetic pathway remain to be determined. The dephosphorylation of SR proteins has been recently shown as a downstream effect of an accumulation of de novo ceramides through protein phosphatase 1 in response to Fas stimulation (17Chalfant C.E. Ogretmen B. Galadari S.H. Kroesen Bj B. Pettus B.J. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44848-44855Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Heat shock was found to induce dephosphorylation of the SR proteins, and this effect was dependent upon biosynthesis of ceramides (Fig. 6). In light of the combination of these findings, SR dephosphorylation is emerging as a specific downstream effect of de novo ceramide accumulation. The heat-induced accumulation of ceramide observed in this study provides insight into sphingolipid metabolism while illustrating the complexity of this metabolism. An intriguing finding from the heat-induced ceramide mass accumulation was that myriocin and fumonisin B1 inhibited the increases seen in all the species of ceramide. These data indicate that the cells produce C16:0, C18:0, C22:0, and C24:1 species through de novo biosynthesis (Fig. 3 B), suggesting that either ceramide synthase incorporates all of these fatty acyl species into ceramide and/or remodeling occurs soon after the formation of C16:0 ceramide. Furthermore, the de novo accumulation of ceramides and not dihydroceramides was somewhat surprising, indicating a rapid conversion of newly made dihydroceramides into ceramides by dihydroceramide desaturase activity. This effect was not observed in other cell types with different inducers of de novo ceramide production; instead, both ceramide and dihydroceramide species increased. 2B. Kroesen, B. Pettus, and Y. Hannun, unpublished data. The current findings raise the possibility that the desaturase may be particularly enriched in Molt-4 cells or activated by heat shock. The labeling studies provide insight into the rate of synthesis of ceramide and regulation of this pathway. Interestingly, the first point of accumulation in the pulse-labeling experiments was at the ceramide level. Also to be noted was the increased production of sphingomyelin and glucosylceramides incorporating the labeled palmitate. These data indicate that although the clearance of ceramide by these enzymes was increased, it was not sufficient to overcome the de novoceramide produced in response to heat shock, creating a bottleneck. Furthermore, the lack of keto-dihydrosphingosine or dihydrosphingosine accumulation in the palmitate pulse labeling indicates a short life for these intermediates in the biosynthetic pathway. Another metabolic implication of the labeling studies was the lack of accumulation of sphingoid bases or sphingoid base phosphates with fumonisin B1 pretreatment, indicating an active sphingoid base phosphate lyase in the Molt-4 cells. The lack of increased in vitro serine palmitoyltransferase and ceramide synthase activities indicates that there was no increase in the protein content of these enzymes upon heat shock of Molt-4 cells. The results also rule out stable post-translational modifications as a mechanism for activation. However, the results do not rule out activation via an allosteric interaction or the driving of the enzymatic pathway by an increased availability of either serine or palmitate. The acuteness of activation and lack of in vitroeffects may point to novel regulatory mechanisms for sphingolipid biosynthesis. These considerations are under investigation. The total ceramide mass is composed of all cellular ceramides including newly made ceramides, ceramides from the breakdown of sphingomyelin and glucosylceramides, ceramide produced from the recycling/salvage pathway, and possibly pools of static (long-lived) ceramides. The activation of de novo sphingolipid biosynthesis required 2 h to achieve a 2-fold increase in the total mass of cellular ceramide, whereas this fold change in the flux in newly made ceramide was achieved within 2 min and was increased to 5-fold by 2 h. Thus, prolonged increase in flux is required to effect substantial changes in the mass of ceramide. This suggests at a first approximation that the half-life of ceramide is on the order of a few hours. Overall, the Molt-4 heat shock model could yield key information pertaining to the regulation of many sphingolipid metabolic enzymes. The emergence of roles for sphingolipids in both the mammalian and yeast heat responses is beginning to define evolutionary-conserved sphingolipid signaling pathways. Both heat shock of Molt-4 cells and heat stress in yeast result in an acute activation of the de novo biosynthetic pathway of ceramide production (11Jenkins G.M. Richards A. Wahl T. Mao C. Obeid L.

Chem. 1998; 273: 7235-7243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). However, the yeast heat stress response involves a transient accumulation in the sphingoid bases that was not detected in Molt-4 cells. Furthermore, the transient accumulation of sphingoid bases upon heat stress of yeast cells was linked to trehalose accumulation (25Dickson R.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 27-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), a transient G0/G1 cell cycle arrest (26Jenkins G.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8574-8581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), and activation of a ubiquitin-dependent pathway leading to degradation of nutrient permeases (27Chung N. Jenkins G. Hannun Y.A. Heitman J. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17229-17232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). However, biological functions for the increased ceramides observed with yeast heat stress have yet to be determined. In contrast, the current study of Molt-4 cells defines a role for heat-induced de novo ceramides in SR dephosphorylation. Interestingly, the changes in sphingolipids in yeast exert a positive effect on their ability to survive and grow under heat-stressed conditions. In contrast, ceramide has been implicated in activation of c-jun/c-fos, leading to activation of caspases and subsequent apoptosis in heat-shocked HL-60 mammalian cells (8Kondo T. Matsuda T. Kitano T. Takahashi A. Tashima M. Ishikura H. Umehara H. Domae N. Uchiyama T. Okazaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7668-7676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). However, the results from this study show that the changes in ceramide precede cell death and may not necessarily lead to cell death since these cells remain viable if removed from heat shock (data not shown). Therefore, sphingolipids may play a positive defensive role in responding to heat shock. Perhaps only when the damage is extensive (i.e. due to prolonged heat shock) do cells undergo apoptosis, a process that is still considered an overall protective mechanism in multicellular organisms. Thus, the yeast heat stress model and the Molt-4 heat shock model are very complementary, and their study may lead to elucidation of fundamental mechanisms of heat-shock responses. In conclusion, the acute response of eukaryotic organisms to increased temperatures may emerge as a key model to understanding sphingolipid metabolism and function in stress responses.

(2002)J. Biol. Chem. 277, 15629–15637). The mechanism of SIK-mediated gene regulation has been further explored. Here we show that SIK changes its subcellular location after the addition of ACTH. The immunocytochemical and fluorocytochemical analyses showed that SIK was present both in the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments of resting cells; when the cells were stimulated with ACTH the nuclear SIK moved into the cytoplasm within 15 min; the level of SIK in the nuclear compartment gradually returned to the initial level after 12 h. SIK translocation was blocked by pretreatment with leptomycin B. A mutant SIK whose Ser-577, the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA)-dependent phosphorylation site, was replaced with Ala could not move out of the nucleus under stimulation by ACTH. As expected, the degree of repression exerted by SIK on CRE reporter activity was weak as long as SIK was present in the cytoplasmic compartment. The same was true for the SIK-mediated repression of a steroidogenic acute regulatory (StAR) protein-gene promoter, which contained a CRE-like sequence at −95 to −85 bp. These results suggest that in the ACTH-stimulated Y1 cells the nuclear SIK was PKA-dependently phosphorylated, and the phosphorylated SIK was then translocated out of the nuclei. This intracellular translocation of SIK, a CRE-repressor, may account for the time-dependent change in the level of ACTH-activated expression of the StAR protein gene.

Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 1769-1777Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) have also been implicated in regulating steroidogenesis, indicating that the steroidogenic cells are equipped with finely tuned signal transducing systems. However, the precise mechanism underlying the acute regulation of steroidogenic gene expression, including the molecular events occurring during the initiation, maintenance, and termination of the steroidogenic gene transcription, is as yet not well understood. Salt-inducible kinase (SIK) was identified as a serine/threonine protein kinase induced in the adrenal glands of high-salt diet-fed rats (33Halder S.K. Takemori H. Hatano O. Nonaka Y. Wada A. Okamoto M. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 3316-3328Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 34Wang Z. Takemori H. Halder S.K. Nonaka Y. Okamoto M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 453: 135-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). When Y1 mouse adrenocortical tumor cells were incubated with ACTH, the cellular levels of mRNA, protein, and kinase activity of SIK were elevated within 1 h through the cAMP/PKA signaling mechanism, and then after a few hours the levels declined (35Lin X. Takemori H. Katoh Y. Doi J. Horike N. Makino A. Nonaka Y. Okamoto M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1264-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In contrast, the transcription of StAR andCYP11A genes begin later, at a time coinciding with the decline of the SIK level. A finding that the ACTH-induced transcription of the CYP11A gene failed to occur in SIK-overexpressing cells (35Lin X. Takemori H. Katoh Y. Doi J. Horike N. Makino A. Nonaka Y. Okamoto M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1264-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) prompted us to explore further the mechanism of action of SIK. Subsequent studies (36Doi J. Takemori H. Lin X.-z. Horike N.

The suppression of ACTH-induced transcription of the StARgene in SIK-overexpressing cells was also noted, but the time course of its manifestation seemed different from that of the CYP11Agene. Thus, 2 h after the addition of ACTH, the level of StAR mRNA in the SIK-overexpressing cells was elevated to a similar level as that in the control cells, but the level was markedly suppressed after 12 h (35Lin X.

This may imply that the time course ofStAR gene expression during ACTH activation might be divided into two consecutive phases; the first in which SIK was not capable of exerting a repressive effect on the StAR gene, and the second in which SIK exerted repressive activity. During the course of this study to explore the mechanism underlying SIK-mediated steroidogenic gene regulation, we noticed that SIK changed its subcellular location during ACTH stimulation. Before stimulation it was present both in the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments; however, within 5 min after ACTH treatment, the nuclear SIK moved into the cytoplasmic compartment. The level of SIK in the nuclei was not recovered until 6 h post-ACTH treatment. The nuclear export of SIK occurred concomitantly with PKA-dependent phosphorylation at Ser-577 of SIK. When the phosphorylation was inhibited, SIK was retained in the nuclei. During SIK's absence from the nuclear compartment the SIK-mediated repression of CRE-reporter activity was not obvious. Experiments conducted on the human StAR gene promoter suggested that SIK repressed the StAR promoter via CREs coupled with a cAMP-responsive SF-1 site. The two consecutive phases found in the time course of StAR gene expression in SIK-overexpressing Y1 cells could be explained by SIK intracellular translocation during ACTH stimulation. StAR promoter reporter plasmids, pGL2-hStAR (37Sugawara T. Holt J.A. Kiriakidou M. Strauss 3rd., J.F.

The following reagents were obtained from commercial sources: 8-bromo-cyclic AMP (8-Br-cAMP), fetal calf serum, dithiothreitol, leptomycin B (LMB), and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride from Sigma, LipofectAMINE 2000 and trypsin-EDTA from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA) and ACTH (Cortrosyn) from Daiichi Seiyaku Co. (Tokyo, Japan). DNA fragments containing 150 and 84 bp of the human StARpromoter were prepared from pGL2 by digesting withKpnI/HindIII and ligating into theKpnI/HindIII site of pGL3. A StARpromoter fragment (−2.0 to −1.3 kbp) was amplified by PCR using the −2.0F primer (5′-AAAGGTACCGTGGTGGCAGGACACAGAACT) and the −1.3R primer (5′-GGGGTCTTGGTATGTGCAGAA) (the sequences from GenBankTMaccession no. AP000065), digested withKpnI/HindIII and ligated into theKpnI/HindIII site of pGL3. The DNA fragment of 1.3 kbp upstream of the transcriptional start site was prepared from pGL2 by HindIII digestion and introduced into theHindIII site of pGL3 reporter with the −2.0 to −1.3-kbp fragment. To prepare a −1.8-kbp StAR promoter construct, a −2.0 to −1.8-kbp fragment was removed from the −2.0-kbpStAR promoter construct by KpnI/AatI digestion. The mutant StAR promoter (−150 bp) with a non-functional SF-1/CRE site at −95 to −85 bp was created by site-directed mutagenesis with a mutagenic primer (5′-GAGGCAATCGCTCTATCTAGAACCCCTTCCTTTGC) using a site-directed mutagenesis kit, GeneEditor (Promega). To prepare the expression vectors for GFP-SIK fusion proteins (GFPs fused to the NH2 termini of SIKs), pEGFP-C plasmid was constructed as follows. First, pEGFP-N1 plasmid was digested withBglII/BamHI (in the multicloning site) and self-ligated, and the resultant EcoRI and BamHI sites were eliminated. Second, oligonucleotides (5′-GTACGGATCCCTGCGGCCGCTGAATTCTAA and 5′-GGCCTTAGAATTCAGCGGCCGCAGGGATCC) were annealed and ligated into theBsrGI/NotI site of the above vector, and thus a new BamHI-NotI-EcoRI site with a stop codon in the 3′-end of the EGFP-coding region was created. cDNA fragments of full-length SIK and its mutants were cloned into theBamHI/EcoRI site of the pEGFP-C plasmid. Mutant SIK cDNAs were created by site-directed mutagenesis using a template, pT7-SIK (35Lin X. Takemori H. Katoh Y. Doi J. Horike N. Makino A. Nonaka Y. Okamoto M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1264-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides used for preparing the mutants were as follows: (T268A, 5′-CCCGCCAAGCGCATCGCCATTGCCCAGATCCGC; T478A, 5′-GCACTGGCCGGAGGCATGCACTGGCTGAAGTTTCCACC; S577A, 5′-GGAGGGACGGAGAGCGGCGGATACGTCTCTCACTCAAGG; R574A, 5′- GTCAGCTTCCAGGAGGGAGCGAGAGCGTCGGATACGTCTCTCACTC; R575A, 5′- GTCAGCTTCCAGGAGGGACGGGCAGCGTCGGATACGTCTCTCACTC; RR574/575AA, 5′- GTCAGCTTCCAGGAGGGAGCGGCAGCGTCGGATACGTCTCTCACTC). An overexpression vector for hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged SIK protein was prepared by modification of the pSVL vector (Amersham Biosciences). Oligonucleotides corresponding to a coding sequence of the HA tag linked to BamHI-EcoRI sites (5′- TCGAATGGCTTACCCATACGACGTCCCAGACTACGCGGGATCCCTCGAGGAATTC and 5′- GATCGAATTCCTCGAGGGATCCCGCGTAGTGTGGGACGTCGTATGGGTAAGCCTA) were ligated into the XhoI/BamHI site of pSVL, and the resultant plasmid was named pSVL(HA). SIK cDNAs were inserted into the BamHI-EcoRI site of pSVL(HA). Plasmids for expression of glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion SIK peptide (573–581 amino acid residues), and its mutant peptides were prepared by introducing oligonucleotides into theBamHI/EcoRI site of pGEX-6P3. The nucleotide sequences of oligonucleotides were: wild type, 5′-GATCCGGTCGTCGTGCGTCGGATACGTCTCTCG and 5′-AATTCGAGAGACGTATCCGACGCACGACGACCG; S577A, 5′- GATCCGGTCGTCGTGCGGCGGATACGTCTCTCG and 5′- AATTCGAGAGACGTATCCGCCGCACGACGACCG; R574A, 5′- GATCCGGTCGTCGTGCGTCGGATACGTCTCTCG and 5′- AATTCGAGAGACGTATCCGACGCACGCGCACCG; R575A, 5′- GATCCGGTCGTGCGGCGTCGGATACGTCTCTCG and 5′- AATTCGAGAGACGTATCCGACGCCGCACGACCG; RR574/575AA, 5′- GATCCGGTGCGGCAGCGTCGGATACGTCTCTCG and 5′- AATTCGAGAGACGTATCCGACGCT- GCCGCACCG. To construct mammalian expression vectors (pEBG-SIK peptides) of GST-fused SIK peptides, the DNA fragments encoding the SIK peptides were prepared from the Escherichia coli GST expression vector, pGEX-6P3, by BamHI/NotI digestion followed by ligation into the BamHI/NotI of pEBG. To create CREB-bZIP expression vector, a cDNA fragment encoding the CREB bZIP domain, similar to an inhibitory CRE modulator (CREM) isoform ICRE, was amplified by RT-PCR using primers (5′-GGGAATTCATGGCTTCCTCCCCAGCACT and 5′-GGGATCCATTTTCCACCTTAACAGGTGA) and pM-CREB(F) plasmid as a template, and it was digested withEcoRI/BamHI and ligated into theEcoRI/BamHI of pIRES1neo vector. Y1 and COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) containing 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics at 37 C under an atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% air. The method of reporter assays was described previously (35Lin X. Takemori H. Katoh Y. Doi J. Horike N. Makino A. Nonaka Y. Okamoto M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1264-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). To introduce DNAs into cells, LipofectAMINE 2000 was used in this study. For fluorescent microscopical observation, cells were cultured on poly-l-lysine coated coverslips (18-mm) (Matsunami Co. LTD, Tokyo, Japan) using a 12-well dish. Cells were fixed with 1 ml of 4% paraformaldehyde dissolved in PBS and washed with PBS three times. For immunostaining, cells were incubated with 1 ml of 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 30 min at room temperature and then reacted with anti-SIK antibody (1:1000 dilution) (35Lin X. Takemori H.

After the cells were washed with PBS four times, the antigen-antibody complexes were reacted with anti-rabbit IgG-Cy2 conjugate IgG (1:300 dilution) (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at 4 C. Cells on the coverslip were embedded onto a slide glass using 50% glycerol. These analytical methods were described previously (35Lin X. Takemori H. Katoh Y. Doi J. Horike N. Makino A. Nonaka Y. Okamoto M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1264-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 300 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm NaVO4, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 14 μg/ml aprotinin) and 3× SDS sample buffer (150 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 6% SDS, 30% glycerol, and 0.1% bromphenol blue) were used in this study. The expression plasmids for GST-SIK peptide (pGEX-6P3-SIK (573–581)) and its mutant peptides were transformed into bacterial strain BL21 (codon plus) (Stratagene). The resultant transformants were grown in 300 ml of Terrific Broth (Sigma) containing 8% glycerol and 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.4) at 28 °C. When the optical density at 600 nm of the culture solution reached 1.0, recombinant proteins were induced by the addition of 0.2 mm iso-1-thio-β-d-galactoside. The bacteria were harvested by centrifugation 3 h after the induction, and the cell pellet was suspended in 50 ml of sonication buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The cells were broken by sonication, and the resultant cell suspension was mixed with Triton X-100 (final 1%), incubated at 4 C for 30 min, and subjected to centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 45 min. The GST-SIK peptides were recovered in the supernatant. For purification of the peptides, glutathione-Sepharose and HiTrap Q column chromatography (Amersham Biosciences) were performed as described in Ref. 35Lin X. Takemori H. Katoh Y. Doi J. Horike N.

To purify GST-SIK peptide, a glutathione column (MicroSpinTM GST Purification Module,Amersham Biosciences) was used. The catalytic subunit of PKA from bovine heart was purchased from Sigma. PKA (0.5 units) was mixed with 0.5 μCi (18.5 kBq) of [γ-32P]ATP and substrates (5 μg of GST or GST-SIK peptides) in 20 μl of PKA-reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 5 mm MgCl2). Reactions were performed at 30 °C for 10 min and stopped by the addition of 10 μl of 3× SDS sample buffer. The reaction mixture was boiled for 5 min, and proteins in 10-μl aliquots were subjected to SDS-PAGE in a 15% gel. The gel was dried and exposed to an x-ray film at room temperature for 10 min. To examine the kinase activity of immunopurified HA-tagged SIK, 30 μl of the samples were mixed with 10 μl of 4× SIK-reaction buffer (200 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 4 mm dithiothreitol, and 40 mm MnCl2) containing 20 μg of GST-Syntide2 and 1.0 μCi (37 kBq) [γ-32P]ATP, and the mixture was incubated at 30 °C for 1 h. After the addition of 20 μl of 3× SDS sample buffer, the reaction mixture was heated at 100 °C for 5 min, and an aliquot (10 μl) was subjected to SDS-PAGE (15%) followed by autoradiography as described above. Phospho-SIK peptides (CQEGRRApSDTSLT, the 571–582-residue peptide with an extra Cys at the NH2terminus: pS indicates phosphoserine), conjugated with keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) or biotin utilizing the NH2-terminal Cys, were obtained from Sigma Genosys Co. LTD. 0.4 mg of KLH-phospho-SIK peptide was emulsified with one volume of TiterMax Gold (TiterMax USA Inc., Norcross, GA) and used to immunize Japanese white rabbits (females, 2.0 kg-body-weight). To purify the specific immunoglobulin G (IgG), 0.5 mg of biotin-linked phospho-SIK peptide was loaded onto a 1-ml streptavidin column (HiTrap-streptoavidine, Amersham Biosciences), and the column was washed with 10 ml of PBS containing 1 m NaCl and then equilibrated with 5 ml of PBS. The antiserum (5 ml) was diluted with 5 ml of PBS, filtered with a disk filter (0.45 μm), and applied onto the phospho-SIK peptide column. The column was washed with 5 ml of PBS, 5 ml of PBS containing 1 m NaCl, and the antiphospho-Ser-577 (anti-pS577) IgG was eluted with 5 ml of 150 mm glycine-HCl (pH 2.5). Almost 80% of IgG was eluted in the first 1-ml fraction; this fraction neutralized with 0.15 ml of 1m Tris-HCl (pH 9.5). To detect SIK protein or peptide with pS577, the samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE (10 or 15% gel, respectively) and immunoblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, as described in Ref. 35Lin X. Takemori H. Katoh Y. Doi J. Horike N. Makino A. Nonaka Y. Okamoto M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1264-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar. The membrane was first incubated with 1% bovine serum albumin for 30 min, and then incubated with the anti-pS577 antibody (diluted at 1:1000 with 4 ml of PBS) for 1 h. The antigen-antibody complexes on the membranes were reacted with goat anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Cappel, Durham, NC). The peroxidase conjugate was visualized with a Konica immunostaining kit (Konica, Tokyo, Japan). By using an anti-SIK antibody we examined the subcellular location of SIK in resting and ACTH-stimulated Y1 cells. In the resting cells a weak signal for the presence of SIK (stained green) was found in both the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments (Fig.1 A). After ACTH treatment the cells looked circular and had an intense signal only in the cytoplasmic compartment. No significant staining occurred with preimmune serum (data not shown). Because ACTH enhanced the biosynthesis of SIK protein in Y1 cells (35Lin X. Takemori H. Katoh Y. Doi J. Horike N. Makino A. Nonaka Y. Okamoto M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1264-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), the immunochemically stained signal after the stimulation must have resulted from the sum total of the SIK present before ACTH treatment and that newly synthesized in the cytoplasm after the treatment. Therefore, when the intracellular translocation of SIK is considered, the immunocytochemical approach may cause difficulty in the interpretation of the results. To overcome this difficulty, GFP-tagged SIK protein was expressed in Y1 cells, and the subcellular translocation of green fluorescence signal was followed after the addition of ACTH. As shown in Fig. 1 B, the fluorescence signal was present in both the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments of resting cells. The nuclear signal formed speckles, the size of respective speckle appearing to be negatively correlated with the number of speckles in a nucleus (data not shown). When the cells were treated with ACTH, the green fluorescence signal seemed to move out of the nuclei and was diffusely distributed in the cytoplasm. When the cells were pretreated with LMB, an inhibitor of CRM1-dependent nuclear export (39Fukuda M. Asano S. Nakamura T. Adachi M. Yoshida M. Yanagida M. Nishida E.

When GFP tag alone was introduced into Y1 cells, the fluorescence signal did not localize at any specific subcellular area, and its distribution did not change after the ACTH addition (data not shown). To answer whether the cAMP/PKA signaling was involved in the intracellular redistribution of SIK, Y1 cells and PKA-less mutant Y1, Kin-7, cells (38Wong M. Krolczyk A.J. Schimmer B.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1614-1624PubMed Google Scholar) were treated with 8-Br-cAMP (Fig. 1 D). cAMP-stimulated the nuclear export of GFP-SIK in Y1, but not in Kin-7, cells. Moreover, in PKA-overexpressing Kin-7 cells GFP-SIK was exclusively present in the cytoplasm. These results indicated that ACTH induced the nuclear export of SIK through the activation of cAMP/PKA signaling. There are three consensus PKA-dependent phosphorylation motifs (R/K)(R/K)X(S/T) in SIK protein;"

A high degree of evolutionary conservation in regions of the 3′-UTR suggests important, conserved elements. In particular, we are interested in those elements involved in regulation of 3′ end formation. In addition to canonical sequence elements, auxiliary sequences likely play an important role in determining the polyadenylation efficiency of mammalian pre-mRNAs. We identified highly conserved sequence elements upstream of the AAUAAA in three human collagen genes, COL1A1, COL1A2, and COL2A1, and demonstrate that these upstream sequence elements (USEs) influence polyadenylation efficiency. Mutation of the USEs decreases polyadenylation efficiency both in vitro and in vivo, and inclusion of competitor oligoribonucleotides representing the USEs specifically inhibit polyadenylation. We have also shown that insertion of a USE into a weak polyadenylation signal can enhance 3′ end formation.

The second step involves polymerization of an adenosine tail to an average length of ∼200 residues. These steps are tightly coupled processes since reaction intermediates are not detectable under normal conditions. The vast majority of eukaryotic polyadenylation signals contain the consensus sequence AAUAAA between 10 and 35 nucleotides upstream of the actual cleavage and polyadenylation site. In addition, sequences 10–30 nucleotides downstream of the cleavage site are known to be involved in directing polyadenylation (Refs. 11Chen F. MacDonald C.C. Wilusz J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2614-2620Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 12Chou Z.F. Chen F. Wilusz J.

These two sequence elements recruit cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF) and cleavage stimulatory factor (CstF), respectively, to define the cleavage site; therefore, mutations within these sequences abolish polyadenylation. The intricate nature of this process implies that polyadenylation might be a useful mechanism to regulate gene expression. The efficiency of 3′ end processing is a level at which regulation can occur. Because most pre-mRNAs in the cell are not efficiently processed, even small changes in the overall processing efficiency of a particular pre-mRNA may have a substantial effect on gene expression. Experimental evidence has demonstrated that poly(A) signal strength directly influences the amount of mature, exported mRNA (14Denome R.M. Cole C.N. Mol. Cell.

Poly(A) signal strength is also directly correlated with the rapid assembly of the polyadenylation machinery on the nascent transcript (16Chao L.C. Jamil A. Kim S.J. Huang L. Martinson H.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5588-5600Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and with transcription termination efficiency (17Osheim Y.N. Proudfoot N.J. Beyer A.L. Mol.

Spacing between the AAUAAA and the USEs plays a significant role in that the USEs closest to the AAUAAA are most important (21Schek N. Cooke C. Alwine J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5386-5393Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Studies on human immunodeficiency virus suggest that definition of the polyadenylation site involves the recognition of multiple sequence elements, including the USE, in the context of the AAUAAA (27Gilmartin G.M. Fleming E.S. Oetjen J. Gravely B.R. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 72-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Comparisons between the polyadenylation signals of the SV40 late mRNA and other cellular mRNAs revealed that three human collagen genes, COL1A1, COL1A2, and COL2A1, each possess elements similar in sequence (USE consensus UAU2–5GUNA) and position relative to the AAUAAA to the SV40 late USEs (21Schek N. Cooke C. Alwine J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5386-5393Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar)). 2C. S. Lutz, unpublished data. Collagens are extracellular proteins that are responsible for the strength and flexibility of connective tissue. They account for 25–30% of all proteins present in animals and are the major fibrous element of skin, bone, tendon, cartilage, blood vessels, and teeth (see Ref. 35Persikov A.V. Brodsky B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1101-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar and references therein). In addition to their structural role, collagens have a directive role in tissue development. The basic structural unit of collagen consists of three polypeptide chains that are extensively covalently cross-linked to each other. The composition of the chains depends on the type of collagen. Type I collagen consists of two COL1A1 chains and one COL1A2 chain, whereas type II collagen consists of three COL2A1 chains. Interestingly, COL1A1, COL1A2, and COL2A1 each possess 3′-UTRs that are extremely conserved between human and other vertebrates, including mice, cows, chickens, and puffer fish (Refs. 36de Wet W.

For example, human COL1A1 has a 3′-UTR ∼1.5 kilobases in length with 2 polyadenylation signals. The first ∼500 bases, containing the first polyadenylation signal, are 86.5% identical in mouse, followed by a ∼600-base block of little conservation, and the final ∼400 bases, including the second polyadenylation signal, are 71.1% identical (44Maatta A. Bornstein P. Penttinen R.P.K. FEBS Lett. 1991; 279: 9-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This high degree of evolutionary conservation suggests important regulatory functions of the collagen 3′-UTRs. It is important to note that the use of one polyadenylation signal over another will shorten the 3′-UTR, and this shortening could potentially remove important regulatory elements. When the sequences surrounding the polyadenylation signal are carefully examined, the percent identity is even higher, especially in the case of the final polyadenylation signal (see TableI). Mechanisms for alternative polyadenylation have been extensively studied for the calcitonin and IgM genes (45Lou H. Neugebauer K.M. Gagel R.F. Berget S.M. Mol. Cell.

Up-regulation of collagen gene expression takes place in a variety of diseases, including osteoarthritis and scleroderma, but it is unclear how this regulation of expression is accomplished (48Jimenez S.A.

Res. 2002; 20: 535-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Some studies suggest in scleroderma that collagen production may be up-regulated by increased mRNA transcription (47Martincic K. Campbell R. Edwalds-Gilbert G. Souan L. Lotze M.T. Milcarek C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11095-11100Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 52Tasanen K Palatsi R. Oikarinen A. Br. J. Dermatol. 1998; 139: 23-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), but the altered expression may not be fully explainable by changes in transcription rates and may additionally be accomplished by regulated post-transcriptional mechanisms, such as polyadenylation. This study examines the regulation of 3′ end formation in human collagen genes. The strong evolutionary conservation of the 3′-UTRs, particularly around polyadenylation signals, led us to believe that these regions contained key regulatory elements. We asked whethercis-acting USEs function as auxiliary elements to influence polyadenylation of the collagen mRNAs, whether these elements acted in a similar fashion to other defined USEs, and how these elements affect utilization of overlapping polyadenylation signals. We determined that the USEs present in these collagen genes do influence 3′ end formation efficiency in these genes. Furthermore, the organization of alternative poly(A) signals in the COL1A2 gene suggests that assembly of 3′ end processing factors on the distal signal prohibits assembly of the processing complex on the proximal signal. This suggests that protein-RNA interactions between core polyadenylation signal elements may represent a novel method of down-regulating polyadenylation signal usage. RNA transcripts for in vitro polyadenylation and cleavage reactions were synthesized by use of SP6 RNA polymerase according to the supplier (Promega) in the presence of 50 μCi of [32P]UTP (Amersham Biosciences or PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Transcription of COL1A2 yielded a 311-base RNA, transcription of COL2A1 yielded a 323-base RNA, and transcription of COL1A1 yielded a 274-base RNA. RNAs were gel-purified from 5% polyacrylamide, 8 m urea gels by overnight crush elution in high salt buffer (0.4 m NaCl, 50 mm Tris at pH 8.0, 0.1% SDS) before use in reactions. Eluted RNAs were ethanol-precipitated and resuspended in water. HeLa cell nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (53Moore C.L. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 181: 49-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In vitro polyadenylation reactions contained a final concentration of 58% v/v HeLa nuclear extract, 16 mm phosphocreatine (Sigma), 0.8 mm ATP (Amersham Biosciences), 2.6% polyvinyl alcohol, and 1 × 105 cpm of 32P-labeled substrate RNA (∼50 fmol) in a reaction volume of 12.5 μl (54Lutz C.S.

Reaction products were then extracted with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol, precipitated with ethanol, and analyzed on (19:1) 5% polyacrylamide gels containing 8 m urea. Typical in vitro cleavage reactions contained a final concentration of 58% v/v HeLa nuclear extract, 1 mm cordycepin (Sigma), 0.5 mm ATP, 20 mm phosphocreatine, 2.6% polyvinyl alcohol, and 1 × 105 cpm of 32P-labeled substrate RNA in a reaction volume of 12.5 μl (56Lutz C.S.

Products were then processed and analyzed as described for polyadenylation products. Competition reactions were performed by adding increased concentrations of specific or nonspecific oligoribonucleotides as indicated into the typical polyadenylation reaction mixtures and were allowed to proceed as described above. Reactions were quantitated using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software. Oligonucleotides were synthesized on the Applied Biosystems 392 and 394 DNA/RNA synthesizers in the New Jersey Medical School Molecular Resource Facility (Newark, NJ). A list of the primers used in PCR reactions and cloning is found in Table II. An oligoribonucleotide representing the putative USE motifs of COL1A2 had the sequence AUUAAAUUGUACCUAUUUUG.

Cells were seeded in 100-mm plates ∼12 h before transfection. When cells reached 80% confluency, they were transfected using the Quantum Prep Cytofectene reagent (Bio-Rad). Plasmid DNA (8.4 μg) was diluted in 700 μl of serum-free medium to which 40 μl of Cytofectene was added, and the mixture was incubated at room temperature for 20 min. After the addition of 6.3 ml of medium (plus fetal bovine serum) to the mixture, the medium on the cells was removed and replaced with the entire transfection mixture. The Cytofectene-DNA mixture was removed 6 h after transfection and replaced with fresh medium. After 24 h, cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were scraped and collected into 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and transferred into microcentrifuge tubes. Cells were then centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 5 min. The phosphate-buffered saline was aspirated, and pellets were stored at −80 °C for no more than 2 days. Total RNA was extracted from the cell pellet using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's spin protocol for isolation of total RNA from animal cells. Probe RNA was prepared as described above using T7 polymerase and generating the antisense of the pCβS-COL1A2 construct. The reporter RNA levels were determined by RNase protection using the RPAIII kit (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX) for 1 h at 37 °C. DNA templates were then removed by DNase I digestion, and the RNA was phenol-extracted, ethanol-precipitated, and analyzed on 5% polyacrylamide 8 m urea gels as described above. COL1A2, COL2A1, and COL1A1 inserts were generated by PCR using complementary primers (Table II). The COL2A1 and COL1A1 primers contained BamHI (forward) and HindIII (reverse) recognition sites to allow insertion into appropriately digested vectors, whereas the COL1A2 primers contained BamHI (forward) and PstI (reverse) recognition sites. Gel-purified and appropriately digested PCR fragments were ligated into appropriately digested pGEM4 with T4 DNA ligase (Invitrogen) at 17 °C overnight. The constructs were then transformed intoEscherichia coli XL1-Blue cells. Positive clones were both sequenced and assayed for expression of appropriately sized clones. Sequencing was completed by the New Jersey Medical School Molecular Resource Facility using the Applied Biosystems 373 DNA Sequencer, and the resulting sequences were analyzed by BLAST computer programs for accuracy. Amplification reactions were performed using platinumTaq polymerase (Invitrogen) in a total volume of 50 μl using standard reaction mixtures for 35 cycles of 95 °C (1 min), 55 °C (30 s), and 72 °C (45 s) with an initial denaturation step of 95 °C (5 min). PCR products were purified on a 1% agarose gel before use. Primers used in individual PCR reactions are referred to in Table II. The COL1A2 double mutant 1,2 and the triple mutant 1,2,3 were prepared via the Stratagene QuikChange kit. Amplification reactions usingPfu polymerase were for 20 cycles of 95 °C (30 s), 55 °C (1 min), and 68 °C (8 min) with a 95 °C (5 min) initial denaturation step. To remove the remaining template after amplification, a DpnI digestion was performed for 90 min at 37 °C. The PCR product was then transformed into E. coliXL-1 Blue cells. Positive clones were isolated and sequenced to determine correct expression before use in polyadenylation reactions. The PA2-G mutant COL1A2, the single USE mutants, and the double mutant 1,3 were created by the use of the megaprimer method of PCR mutagenesis as described previously (57Aiyar A. Leis J. Biotechniques. 1993; 14: 366-369PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, a mutant PCR product was generated using an internal upstream primer containing the mutant, such as the PA2-G mutant COL1A2, and the wild-type COL1A2 downstream primer. This product containing the mutant sequence was then gel-purified and used as the downstream megaprimer for the second PCR. The COL1A2 wild type upstream primer was used for the second PCR. A third PCR was then performed using the gel-purified second PCR product as the template and COL1A2 wild type upstream and downstream primers. This final PCR amplified the inefficient product resulting from the second PCR. This final product was gel-purified, cloned into pGEM4, and transformed intoE. coli XL-1 Blue cells. The construction of pIVA2 was described in Wilusz et al. (58Wilusz J. Feig D.I. Shenk T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4477-4483Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Briefly, the 155-base BamHI toPvuII fragment of pAd5-E1B (which contains adenovirus type 5 sequences from 3943 to 4122) was cloned into pGem4 at theHincII and BamHI sites. Linearization withBglI yields a 158-base RNA containing the IVA2poly(A) signal. The DNA template to generate IVA2-USE RNA, which contains a USE 5′ of the AAUAAA, was constructed by a two-step PCR reaction using the megaprimer approach (57Aiyar A. Leis J. Biotechniques. 1993; 14: 366-369PubMed Google Scholar). The first PCR reaction used a standard SP6 primer and 5′-TATTTAGGGGTTTTGCGGGTTACAAATAAAGCCGCGCGGTAGGCCGG to generate a megaprimer that contained a USE insertion 13 bases upstream of the AAUAAA element. The second PCR reaction contained the megaprimer and the primer 5′-AGCTTGCATGCCTGCAGGTCGACTC. The product of this PCR reaction was then cut with BglII and used as a template to generate IVA2-USE RNA using SP6 RNA polymerase. For transfection assays, all COL1A2 constructs were cloned into theBamHI-PstI sites of vector pCβS (a gift of David Fritz, UMDNJ) downstream of a cytomegalovirus promoter and upstream of a bovine growth hormone polyadenylation (BGH) signal. This vector also includes intron 1 of the rabbit β-globin gene accompanied by the splice donor and acceptor sites. Constructs were verified by sequencing. Previously, auxiliary polyadenylation elements known as upstream efficiency elements (USEs) have been described and characterized in the SV40 late polyadenylation signal (21Schek N. Cooke C. Alwine J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5386-5393Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). It was determined that these elements functioned as efficiency elements in the SV40 system since their disruption resulted in reduced polyadenylation function (21Schek N. Cooke C. Alwine J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5386-5393Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that a USE from the SV40 signal can replace the human immunodeficiency virus USE in mediating efficient 3′ end formation in transient transfection assays (23Valsamakis A. Zeichner S. Carswell S. Alwine J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2108-2112Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Both SV40 and human immunodeficiency virus have very strong polyadenylation signals. However, it has not previously been determined if USEs could be added to a weak polyadenylation signal, such as the adenovirus IVA2 polyadenylation signal, to enhance 3′ processing efficiency. A USE motif from SV40 having the sequence GCUUUAUUUGUAACC was inserted upstream of the AAUAAA in the IVA2 polyadenylation signal to create IVA2-USE, substrate RNAs were prepared from both pIVA2 and pIVA2-USE, and the RNAs were added to in vitropolyadenylation reactions.

Bouzamondo E. Heinrich C. Legname G. Prusiner S.B. Hood L. Westaway D. DeArmond S.J. Tremblay P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 694-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Prnd is located 16 kb downstream fromPrnp, the gene encoding the cellular prion protein (PrPc), and is thought to result from the ancestral duplication of this gene. For this reason, the corresponding protein was named Dpl, an acronym derived from downstreamprion protein-like gene. Despite this relationship, PrPc and Dpl present numerous differences and have specific features. PrPc is a ubiquitous glycoprotein produced in large amounts in neurons (6Kretzschmar H.A. Prusiner S.B. Stowring L.E. DeArmond S.J. Am. J. Pathol. 1986; 122: 1-5PubMed Google Scholar). The mature protein is ∼210 amino acids long, binds copper with high affinity via its N-terminal octapeptides, and may be involved in the regulation of oxidative stress (7Brown D.R. Qin K. Herms J.W. Madlung A. Manson J. Strome R. Fraser P.E. Kruck T. von Bohlen A. Schulz-Schaeffer W. Giese A. Westaway D. Kretzschmar H. Nature. 1997; 390: 684-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). It has also been shown to prevent neuronal death in vitro (8Milhavet O. McMahon H.E. Rachidi W. Nishida N. Katamine S. Mange A. Arlotto M. Casanova D. Riondel J. Favier A. Lehmann S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3937-3942Crossref Scopus (190) Google Scholar), suggesting that it may play a role in cell death and/or apoptosis and that it may also be involved in cell signaling (9Kuwahara C. Takeuchi A.M. Nishimura T. Haraguchi K. Kubosaki A. Matsumoto Y. Saeki K. Matsumoto Y. Yokoyama T. Itohara S. Onodera T.

Science. 2000; 289: 1925-1928Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). More importantly, a change in the conformation of PrPc to generate an abnormal isoform, named PrPSc, is the molecular basis of the prion diseases, a group of fatal transmissible neurodegenerative diseases, including Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans. The mature Dpl protein is ∼125 amino acids residues long and presents no region with a sequence similar to the octarepeat region of PrPc. In contrast to what has been shown for PrPc, Dpl does not seem to be required for prion disease progression or for the generation of PrPSc (11Behrens A. Brandner S. Genoud N. Aguzzi A. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 347-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 12Tuzi N.L. Gall E. Melton D. Manson J.C. J. Gen. Virol. 2002; 83: 705-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Whereas PrPc is ubiquitous (13Bendheim P.E. Brown H.R. Rudelli R.D. Scala L.J. Goller N.L. Wen G.Y. Kascsak R.J. Cashman N.R. Bolton D.C. Neurology. 1992; 42: 49-56Crossref Google Scholar), Dpl seems to be tissue-specific in mice, sheep, and cattle (2Moore R.C. Lee I.Y. Silverman G.L. Harrison P.M. Strome R. Heinrich C. Karunaratne A. Pasternak S.H. Chishti M.A. Liang Y. Mastrangelo P. Wang K. Smit A.F. Katamine S,. Carlson G.A. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Melton D.W. Tremblay P. Hood L.E. Westaway D. J. Mol.

Genome. 2001; 12: 376-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Unlike PrPc, Dpl gene transcripts are present only in very small amounts in the brains of wild-type adult mice and are principally found in the heart and testis (2Moore R.C. Lee I.Y. Silverman G.L. Harrison P.M. Strome R. Heinrich C. Karunaratne A. Pasternak S.H. Chishti M.A. Liang Y. Mastrangelo P. Wang K. Smit A.F. Katamine S,. Carlson G.A. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Melton D.W. Tremblay P. Hood L.E. Westaway D. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 797-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). Although these differences indicate that the two proteins have different fates, Dpl and PrPc have retained a number of important features in common, probably due to their common origin. Both are cell-surface proteins and present a 25% sequence homology, mainly in the C-terminal domain, resulting in similar patterns of folding (2Moore R.C. Lee I.Y. Silverman G.L. Harrison P.M. Strome R. Heinrich C. Karunaratne A. Pasternak S.H. Chishti M.A. Liang Y. Mastrangelo P. Wang K. Smit A.F. Katamine S,. Carlson G.A. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Melton D.W. Tremblay P. Hood L.E.

The most intriguing observation to date remains the correction of the ataxic phenotype following the introduction of a wild-type PrP transgene in some Prnp 0/0 mice overexpressing Prnd in the central nervous system (4Moore R.C. Mastrangelo P. Bouzamondo E. Heinrich C. Legname G. Prusiner S.B. Hood L. Westaway D. DeArmond S.J. Tremblay P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This correction suggests that there is a direct or indirect interaction between Dpl and PrPc. No precise physiological role has yet been attributed to either PrPc or Dpl. Most recent studies have focused on murine Dpl, and few data are available concerning human Dpl (HuDpl). Lu et al. (17Lu K. Wang W. Xie Z. Wong B.S., Li, R. Petersen R.B., Sy, M.S. Chen S.G. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13575-13583Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) produced a recombinant putative mature HuDpl (residues 24–152) and showed that HuDpl contains two disulfide bonds between residues 94 and 145 and between residues 108 and 140 and has a high α-helix content (40%). The apparent molecular mass of the mature protein is 14.9 kDa, corresponding to the predicted molecular mass. Three polymorphisms affecting residues 26 (T26M), 56 (P56L), and 174 (T174M) of the coding sequence of the human Dpl gene, PRND, have been described. No association has been established between these polymorphisms and the development of human prion diseases (18Peoc'h K. Guerin C. Brandel J.P. Launay J.-M. Laplanche J.-L. Neurosci. Lett. 2000; 286: 144-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 19Mead S. Beck J. Dickinson A. Fisher E.M. Collinge J. Neurosci. Lett. 2000; 286: 117-120Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar). However, the specific positions of these polymorphisms raise questions concerning their possible effects on the processing of the protein (18Peoc'h K. Guerin C. Brandel J.P. Launay J.-M. Laplanche J.-L. Neurosci. Lett. 2000; 286: 144-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated the cellular distribution and biochemical properties of HuDpl in various tissues, focusing on the male reproductive system and on cells transiently transfected with various HuDpl DNA constructs. We also studied the structure of PrPcand its distribution in the male reproductive system, with the aim of investigating possible PrPc/Dpl interactions under physiological conditions. We found that HuDpl was present on both Sertoli cells and mature spermatozoa. These findings concerning the distribution of the protein and further characterization of the protein may provide new insight into the function of Dpl in human reproduction. McCoy's medium, trypsin, fetal calf serum, antibiotics, glutamine, bovine serum albumin (BSA), diaminobenzidine, Tween 20, Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC), and normal goat serum were obtained from Sigma (Saint-Quentin Fallavier, France). FuGENE 6 reagent and Mini-Complete protease inhibitor tablets were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Meylan, France). Peptide N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) and restriction enzymes BamHI and HindIII were purchased from New England Biolabs Inc. (Hitchin, United Kingdom). The glycoprotein deglycosylation kit containing PNGase F, endo-α-N-acetylgalactose aminidase, α2–3,6,8,9-neuraminidase, β1,4-galactosidase, and β-N-acetylglucose aminidase was supplied by Calbiochem. Anti-fading solution was obtained from Dako Corp. (Trappes, France). We obtained pcDNA3 from Invitrogen (Cergy Pontoise, France). DDC39 is a polyclonal rabbit antiserum directed against a synthetic peptide encompassing amino acids 68–88 of HuDpl (Neosystem SA, Strasbourg, France). Dop151 is a monoclonal antibody obtained by immunizing mice with recombinant HuDpl (amino acids 28–152) produced in Escherichia coli. Recombinant HuDpl was generously provided by Dr. Sorgato (Dipartimento di Chimica Biologica, University of Padova). Dop151 specificity was verified by Western blotting on the recombinant HuDpl protein. SAF32, SAF70, and Pri917 are monoclonal antibodies directed against the PrPc protein. SAF32 and SAF70 were elicited in knockout mice immunized with denatured scrapie-associated fibrils from the brain of an infected hamster. SAF32 recognizes the N-terminal octarepeat region of HuPrPc(amino acids 59–89), and SAF70 recognizes the region encompassing residues 156–162 (18Peoc'h K. Guerin C. Brandel J.P. Launay J.-M. Laplanche J.-L. Neurosci. Lett. 2000; 286: 144-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Pri917 was raised in Biozzi mice by immunization with a synthetic peptide (20Demart S. Fournier J.G. Créminon C. Frobert Y. Lamoury F. Marcé D. Lasmézas C. Dormont D. Grassi J. Deslys J.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 265: 652-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and binds to the C-terminal part of HuPrPc (amino acids 216–221). Monoclonal antibody 3F4 recognizes residues 109–112 of HuPrPc (Senetek, Napa, CA). Secondary antibodies were obtained from Southern Biotechnologies (peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody; Montrouge, France), Dako Corp. (peroxidase- and FITC-conjugated anti-mouse antibodies), and Sigma (FITC-conjugated antibody). The PRND sequence encoding Thr26/Pro56/Thr174 HuDpl (considered the wild-type form) or its variants (T26M, P56L, and T174M) was inserted into the expression vector pcDNA3 as follows. The previously described PRND coding sequences from four control individuals (18Peoc'h K. Guerin C. Brandel J.P. Launay J.-M. Laplanche J.-L. Neurosci. Lett. 2000; 286: 144-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) were amplified under standard conditions with the following primers, introducing restriction sites forHindIII (forward) and BamHI (reverse): forward, 5′-GATCAGAAGCTTAATGAGGAAGCACCTGAGCTGG3-′; and reverse, 5′-CTGATCGGATCCTCATTATTTCACCGTGAGCCAGAT3-′. The PCR products were cleaved with the appropriate restriction enzyme and inserted into pcDNA3. Each DNA construct was verified by sequencing. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were cultured in McCoy's medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, 1% glutamine, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air and transiently transfected using FuGENE 6 reagent as recommended by the manufacturer. Cell viability was assessed by the trypan blue exclusion test 24 h after transfection. To obtain cell lysates, cells were washed three times with PBS, suspended in lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5) at 4 °C to which a protease inhibitor tablet had been added, and incubated for 30 min on ice. The resulting cell lysates were centrifuged at 4000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was stored at −80 °C until used. Human tissues were removed post-mortem from two adult individuals (one male and one female) free of human prion diseases. Human organs were homogenized at 4 °C in lysis buffer in an automated crusher (Ultraturax, Staufen, Germany). The homogenates were centrifuged, and the supernatants were frozen at −80 °C until used. Protein concentrations were determined by the BCA technique (Bio-Rad, Marne-la-Coquette, France). Human testicular tissue were obtained from infertile patients in whom a surgical recovery of testicular or epididymal spermatozoa was attempted for assisted reproduction. Testicular samples with normal spermatogenesis and normal structure of interstitial tissue were obtained from three men with obstructive azoospermia. Three testicular samples from men with secretory azoospermia and high follicle-stimulating hormone levels were also analyzed. Two had Sertoli-cell-only syndrome, characterized by a lack of germinal cells in all seminiferous tubule sections analyzed; and in one sample, a complete spermatogenesis could be observed only in some tubule sections (hypospermatogenesis). Blood was obtained from healthy voluntary donors. Human spermatozoa were obtained from healthy voluntary donors with normal sperm characteristics according to the World Health Organization criteria (21World Health Organization WHO Laboratory Manual for the Examination of Human Semen and Semen-Cervical Mucus Interaction. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, United Kingdom1992Google Scholar). After collection, semen samples were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C for liquefaction and layered onto a two-phase Percoll gradient (47.5 and 95%). The Percoll gradient was centrifuged for 20 min at 300 × g, and the overlying seminal plasma was recovered and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. Protease inhibitors were added to the supernatant depleted of spermatozoa, which was then frozen at −80 °C until used. In the lower fraction (95% Percoll), the pellet of motile spermatozoa was washed twice and resuspended in human tubule fluid supplemented with 1% BSA. The cells were either used immediately or incubated for 18 h in human tubule fluid supplemented with 1% BSA under 5% CO2 in air to allow the completion of capacitation. Testicular spermatozoa were obtained by dissecting fresh human testicular biopsy samples in Ferticult medium to extrude germ cells. In one patient with excretory azoospermia, spermatozoa were collected from the epididymis for diagnostic assessment and smeared onto a slide. All samples were obtained after the patients had given written informed consent. Where indicated, cell lysates or tissue homogenates were treated with 10,000 IU/ml PNGase F for 3 h at 37 °C to generate N-deglycosylated HuDpl and HuPrPc proteins. In some experiments, samples were incubated for 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, and 120 min at 37 °C with 100 IU/ml PNGase F. Lysates were also treated with PNGase F andO-deglycosidase enzymes for 3 h at 37 °C to generate N- and O-deglycosylated HuDpl, respectively. Alternatively, lysates were treated with 0.2 IU/ml neuraminidase together with PNGase F. Cell lysates or tissue homogenates were loaded onto 12 or 15% SDS/glycine-polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were electroblotted onto Immobilon P membranes (Millipore, Saint-Quentin en Yvelines, France), and HuDpl or HuPrPc was detected with the antibodies indicated and a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibody. The blots were developed using an enhanced chemiluminescence protocol (Pierce). For microsequencing, HuDpl was immunoprecipitated from a testicular homogenate using Dop151 conjugated to Sepharose beads. Briefly, the antibody was incubated with protein A-conjugated Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences, Saclay, Paris) in 150 mm HEPES and 5% BSA for 2 h at 4 °C. Precleared crude testicular lysates were then incubated overnight with the beads. After three washings in PBS the beads were heated for 10 min at 100 °C in Laemmli buffer, and the supernatant was subjected to two-dimensional electrophoresis. Protein spots were electroeluted and sequenced by Edman degradation. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometric analysis of digested peptides was performed on a Biflex mass spectrometer equipped with a gridless delayed extraction operating in the reflector mode. A list of the masses of peptides was obtained for the protein digests. This peptide mass fingerprint was then submitted to the Swiss Protein Database 2Available at www.expasy.org/tools/findmod. to identify the protein. To identify the sugars, the mass strategy developed by Carr et al. (22Carr S.A. Huddleston M.J. Bean M.F. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 183-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) was used. N-terminal sequencing and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometric analysis were performed in the Roche Pharma Research Department (Basel, Switzerland). Detergent insolubility was assayed as previously described (23Lehmann S. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24589-24597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), with slight modifications. We incubated 500 μl of cell-free seminal plasma at 4 °C for 20 min with 1% Triton X-114 in PBS supplemented with protease inhibitors. This mixture was centrifuged at 3000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was incubated for 10 min at 37 °C and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 60 s. The aqueous phase was then collected and submitted to methanol precipitation (A1), and the detergent phase was removed and placed on ice. We added 500 μl of PBS and split the resulting mixture into two aliquots. One aliquot was incubated with 5 IU/ml PI-PLC for 2 h at 4 °C. Both aliquots were then incubated for 10 min at 37 °C and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 60 s. Both the aqueous (A2) and detergent phases were collected and subjected to methanol precipitation, followed by Western blotting. Human testicular biopsy samples were fixed in 4% formaldehyde and embedded in paraffin. Sections (4 μm) were cut, cleared by incubation in alcohol, and rehydrated. Endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked by incubation with 3% H2O2 for 30 min. Sections were incubated with 1.5% normal goat serum in 1% BSA and 0.05% Tween in PBS for 1 h and then with primary antibodies for an additional hour at room temperature. Sections were washed with PBS, incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse antibody for 1 h, and washed three times. The sections were finally treated with diaminobenzidine for 10 min in the dark. Washed sections were rapidly counterstained with Hemalum. For PrPc detection, the sections were first dipped in boiling citrate buffer (0.1 m sodium citrate and 0.1 m citric acid, pH 6.0) for 10 min and then allowed to cool before peroxidase inhibition. Negative controls were performed by incubating sections with the secondary antibody alone. Capacitated spermatozoa (2 × 106 cells/ml) were washed twice with PBS, deposited in the wells of a microscope slide, and air-dried. For PrPcdetection, slides were dipped in boiling citrate buffer for 10 min and cooled. Slides were incubated for 30 min at room temperature with 3% BSA in PBS and then treated for 1 h with primary antibodies in 1% BSA in PBS. Spermatozoa were washed three times and incubated for 1 h with FITC-conjugated anti-mouse antibody in 1% BSA in PBS. The slides were washed, mounted into anti-fading solution, and examined by fluorescence microscopy. Negative controls were performed using either a mouse IgG isotype control or PBS instead of the primary antibody. The smears of testicular and epididymal spermatozoa were treated for immunofluorescence as described above for ejaculated spermatozoa. For transfected cells, Dop151 was incubated with living cells on coverslips for 1 h at 4 °C, fixed by incubation with cold methanol for 30 min, and detected with FITC-conjugated anti-mouse antibody. The coverslips were mounted in anti-fading solution, and the cells were observed by fluorescence microscopy. Spermatozoa were washed twice with PBS, incubated in 10% normal goat serum in PBS to avoid nonspecific binding, and then incubated for 1 h with either Dop151 or SAF70 in 3% normal goat serum in PBS. They were rinsed and incubated for 1 h with FITC-conjugated anti-mouse antibody. The cells were washed, fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS, and analyzed by flow cytometry with CELL-Quest software (BD Biosciences). In some experiments, cells were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with PI-PLC (5 IU/ml), rinsed, and stained as described above. Various human organs and tissues were subjected to immunoblotting to test for the presence of HuDpl. We used a polyclonal antibody directed against the N-terminal part of HuDpl, which recognized a large heterodisperse band in human testis with an apparent molecular mass of 29–40 kDa (Fig. 1). No HuDpl was detected in the brain, heart, or liver (Fig. 1) or in the spleen, lung, lymph nodes, ovary, leukocytes, erythrocytes, or serum (data not shown). Edman degradation and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometric analysis of the protein immunoprecipitated from the testis confirmed that this protein was indeed HuDpl, with the N-terminal sequence TRGIKHRIKWN, indicating that the mature HuDpl protein begins at the polymorphic residue 26. Two potential N-glycosylation sites were identified in the HuDpl sequence at Asn98 (NVT) and Asn110 (NAT); we therefore analyzed testicular lysates after deglycosylation with PNGase F (Fig. 2 A). The kinetics of deglycosylation indicated that both sites were occupied. We detected one intermediate deglycosylation step giving rise to a band migrating at 27–28 kDa (Fig. 2 A). Prolonged incubation with an excess of PNGase F resulted in the detection of two bands, a minor band migrating at 14–15 kDa (probably corresponding to unglycosylated HuDpl) and a second band of 16–22 kDa, suggesting the existence of additional post- or co-translational modifications insensitive to PNGase F. Indeed, assays combining N- andO-deglycosylation resulted in the detection of a single band of ∼14–15 kDa, probably corresponding to the mature unglycosylated full-length protein (Fig. 2 B). Digestion of theN-deglycosylated extract of HuDpl with neuraminidase alone led to a detectable shift in the apparent molecular mass of the protein, indicating the presence of sialic acid in the oligosaccharide residues in the side chains of the glycoprotein (Fig. 2 B). MALDI-TOF analysis of HuDpl confirmed that a mucin-typeO-glycosylation occurred at Thr43, with the carbohydrate moiety GalNAc branching from the first residue (data not shown). HuDpl was also detected in both ejaculated sperm extracts and seminal plasma as a large heterodisperse band of 29–35 kDa (Fig. 1). After PNGase F treatment, HuDpl from spermatozoa and seminal plasma displayed the same pattern of migration as seen for the testis (data not shown), indicating N- and O-glycosylation. Flow cytometric analyses of HuDpl staining were performed on mature spermatozoa with or without preliminary incubation with PI-PLC. PI-PLC treatment led to a marked decrease in the fluorescence intensity resulting from HuDpl staining (Fig.3 A), indicating GPI anchoring of the protein. HuDpl from seminal plasma was shown to partition into the Triton X-114 hydrophobic fraction (Fig. 3 B). PI-PLC treatment resulted in the partitioning of HuDpl into the aqueous phase, demonstrating that HuDpl has an intact PI-PLC-sensitive GPI anchor in seminal plasma. As Dpl seemed to be present only in the male reproductive system in humans, we characterized in more detail its distribution in the testis and at the surface of spermatozoa. Immunohistochemistry experiments in which Dop151 was incubated with normal biopsy sections showed that HuDpl was present mostly in the seminiferous tubules, at the location of the Sertoli cells (Fig. 4, a–c). In testicular biopsy sections from patients suffering from hypospermatogenesis or Sertoli-cell-only syndrome, in which Sertoli cells are more easily visible due to the partial or total absence of germinal cells, this reactivity was confirmed; a markedly higher staining was observed on the adluminal side of the cells (Fig. 4,i, j, m, and n). To determine the location of HuDpl on spermatozoa, we carried out indirect immunofluorescence experiments with Dop151 and spermatozoa collected at three different points in their maturation: from the testis, epididymis, and semen. No fluorescence was observed on testicular spermatozoa, whereas faint staining was observed on the flagella of epididymal spermatozoa (Fig.5 c), and more intense staining was observed on the flagella of mature ejaculated spermatozoa (Fig. 5,e and f). HuPrPc was detected by Western blotting in testicular extracts and seminal plasma as a heterodisperse band with an apparent molecular mass of 27–35 kDa, similar to that obtained with brain extracts (Fig. 6, A andB). PNGase F treatment of testicular homogenates generated three isoforms with apparent molecular masses of 27–30, 21–22, and 18 kDa (Fig. 6 A). These isoforms, also present in the brain (24Chen S.G.

HuPrPc from seminal plasma partitioned into the Triton X-114 detergent phase, suggesting that the GPI anchor is conserved. On"

Our data indicated that, in the presence of complexin, the neuronal SNARE proteins assemble directly into a complex in which the transmembrane regions interact.

Neuron. 2002; 33: 397-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). EPR and CD spectroscopy experiments revealed that there are no major structural changes in the cytoplasmic domain of SNARE complex upon complexin binding (21Pabst S. Margittai M. Vainius D. Langen R. Jahn R. Fasshauer D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7838-7848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), whereas an NMR study suggested that complexin stabilizes the C-terminal part of the SNARE complex (22Chen X.

Although complexin was proposed to promote assembly and oligomerization of SNARE complex (17Tokumaru H. Umayahara K. Pellegrini L.L. Ishizuka T. Saisu H. Betz H. Augustine G.J. Abe T.

Also, complexin was thought to block binding of SNAPs to SNARE complex (13McMahon H.T. Missler M., Li, C. Sudhof T.C.

Cell. 2001; 104: 421-432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), but NSF/SNAP-driven disassembly of SNARE complex proceeds whether or not complexin is bound (20Pabst S.

Chem. 2000; 275: 19808-19818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar).Thus, although the physiological importance of complexin has been established in vivo (16Reim K.

Machius M. Sudhof T.C. Rizo J. Neuron. 2002; 33: 397-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar), the molecular link between the binding of complexin and its positive physiological action remains to be established. Here, by using purified full-length and truncated SNARE proteins, we show that the presence of SNARE TMRs dramatically affects the properties of SNARE complex. By taking advantage of this, we provide the first evidence that complexin actively promotes the interaction between the complementary SNARE TMRs implicated in membrane fusion. This novel mechanism readily accounts for the positive role played by complexin in synaptic vesicle exocytosis, as demonstrated in electrophysiological experiments, and is also in good agreement with structural, biophysical, and biochemical studies.RESULTSBecause SNARE complex is thermodynamically stable and, once formed, is not disrupted by SDS, its assembly has been widely studied by electrophoretic techniques (5Hayashi T. McMahon H. Yamasaki S. Binz T. Hata Y. Sudhof T.C. Niemann H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5051-5061Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar, 21Pabst S. Margittai M. Vainius D. Langen R. Jahn R. Fasshauer D.

Hanson P.I. Jahn R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6197-6201Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). SNAREs lacking TMRs assembled into a SNARE complex that migrated as a single band (Fig.1 A). Assembly using full-length SNARE proteins unexpectedly gave rise to an additional, slow-migrating form of the complex (Fig. 1 A). Because of the important role of the TMRs for SNARE function, we decided to investigate this behavior of the full-length SNAREs in detail. To analyze which SNARE TMR is responsible for the additional form of SNARE complex, syntaxin and synaptobrevin with or without TMRs were mixed with brain-purified SNAP-25, and complex was allowed to form for 30 min. When SNARE complex was assembled with either full-length syntaxin or full-length synaptobrevin, there was a small shift of several kDa in keeping with the addition of a single transmembrane region of ∼25 amino acids. Only when both syntaxin and synaptobrevin TMRs were present did the slow-migrating form of the complex suddenly appear (Fig. 1 B). Of note, the calculated molecular mass of the two TMRs is only ∼5 kDa, but the observed difference in apparent molecular mass between the two forms is ∼100 kDa. Because interaction of the TMRs from syntaxin and synaptobrevin is SDS-resistant (27Margittai M. Otto H. Jahn R. FEBS Lett. 1999; 446: 40-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), the likeliest explanation for the dramatic difference in the mobility of the SNARE complexes is that the slow-migrating form represents complex in which the complementary syntaxin and synaptobrevin TMRs have interacted.Next, we used the appearance of slow-migrating SNARE complex as a simple assay of syntaxin and synaptobrevin TMR-TMR interaction to investigate the action of complexin. This was a natural step because complexin has been shown to bind to syntaxin and synaptobrevin helices close to the transmembrane part of the SNARE complex (22Chen X. Tomchick D.R. Kovrigin E. Arac D. Machius M. Sudhof T.C. Rizo J. Neuron. 2002; 33: 397-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). SNARE complex was prepared by incubating full-length synaptobrevin with SNAP-25 and either syntaxin-(1–265) lacking TMR or full-length syntaxin. After 30 min, complexin was added, and the reaction was allowed to proceed for a further 20 min. Complexin did not cause any changes in SNARE complex when syntaxin was lacking its TMR (Fig.2 A). But, strikingly, when the complementary syntaxin and synaptobrevin TMRs were present, complexin promoted complete transition of preassembled SNARE complex into its slow-migrating form (Fig. 2 B).Figure 2Effect of complexin on pre-assembled SNARE complex. A, complexin does not affect migration of SNARE complex lacking one transmembrane region. 6 pmol of syntaxin without transmembrane region (1–265), full-length SNAP-25, and full-length synaptobrevin were incubated for 30 min at room temperature, and then complexin was added in the indicated amounts. After a 20-min incubation with complexin, SNARE complex was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western immunoblotting using anti-synaptobrevin antibody (upper panel) or anti-complexin antibody (lower panel). B, complexin promotes transition of full-length SNARE complex into its slow-migrating form. Reactions as inA were repeated using full-length syntaxin (with its TMR) instead of truncated syntaxin-(1–265). Samples were analyzed as in A using anti-synaptobrevin antibody. Complexin induced transition of SNARE complex into the slow-migrating form.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To determine whether native complexin, even in the presence of the other neuronal proteins, binds SNARE complex and promotes the slow-migrating form, we purified SNARE complex from bovine brain cortex. A Triton X-100 brain extract was loaded on an anti-SNARE immunoaffinity column, made using an anti-SNAP-25 antibody, clone SMI 81. This monoclonal antibody is highly specific for SNAP-25, can bind SNAP-25 containing complexes, and does not cross-react with complexin (data not shown). A typical chromatography round yielded ∼1 mg of SNARE proteins per 2 g of brain cortex, co-purifying with stoichiometric amounts of complexin (Fig.3 A). Because the interaction of complexin with SNAREs is sensitive to SDS, the co-purifying complexin migrated in its monomeric position in both boiled and non-boiled samples. Eluted SNARE complex migrated as a major band (Fig.3 A) corresponding to the slow-migrating form identified in our SNARE re-assembly reactions (Fig. 1). When boiled in sample buffer, the slow-migrating complex is disrupted into monomeric syntaxin, SNAP-25, and synaptobrevin (Fig. 3 A), as expected. The anti-SNAP-25 immunoaffinity column also pulled down monomeric SNAP-25, as expected (Fig. 3 A).Figure 3Complexin is the major binding partner of SNARE complex in brain. A, SNARE complex extraction from bovine brain by anti-SNAP-25 immunoaffinity chromatography. Equal aliquots of loading material (Load), flow-through (FT), and pH 2.5 eluate after neutralization were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and protein was visualized by Coomassie staining. Neuronal SNARE complex, co-purifying with stoichiometric amounts of complexin, is represented by its slow-migrating form. B, demonstration of total extraction of SNARE complex from brain on anti-SNAP-25 column. Western immunoblot of equal aliquots of the flow-through (FT) and the loading material (Load), using anti-syntaxin, anti-SNAP-25, anti-synaptobrevin, and anti-complexin antibodies. All samples were boiled prior to SDS-PAGE and thus represent total amounts of SNARE proteins. SNAP-25 immunoreactivity is absent in the flow-through material indicating that the anti-SNAP-25 column extracts all SNAP-25 and thus all ternary complex. Complexin immunoreactivity in the flow-through sample does not dramatically change despite stoichiometric binding to SNARE complex. C, selective binding of complexin to SNARE complex. GST-complexin immobilized on glutathione beads was incubated with monomeric SNAP-25, SNARE complex, or control buffer for 30 min. After washing, protein was eluted by addition of sample buffer. Samples were boiled to disrupt SNARE complex prior to analysis by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining. Theasterisk indicates a breakdown product of the GST fusion protein.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To ensure that we had extracted all available forms of SNARE complex and thus excluded the possibility of selective isolation of the slow-migrating complex, we tested the efficiency of the isolation procedure. We compared equal aliquots of the flow-through and the original loading material, both samples being boiled before electrophoresis to ensure that SNARE complex was disrupted and SNAREs were being compared in their monomeric state. Fig. 3 B shows that the affinity column completely removed SNAP-25 (and thus all SNAP-25-containing ternary SNARE complexes) from the loaded brain detergent extract. Interestingly, complexin concentration in the flow-through material did not change significantly, showing that complexin amounts exceed maximal SNARE complex quantities in brain.Because the eluate contained SNAP-25 in its monomeric state (Fig.3 A), we tested whether complexin was purified strictly with the ternary SNARE complex rather than with SNAP-25. We immobilized GST-complexin on glutathione beads and tested SNAP-25 and the SNARE complex for binding. Fig. 3 C shows that the immobilized complexin did not bind monomeric SNAP-25 but stoichiometrically interacted with complex composed of syntaxin, SNAP-25, and synaptobrevin.SNAREs are likely to assemble in vivo in the presence of cytosolic complexin. Therefore, we analyzed the behavior of SNARE complex when made to assemble in the presence of complexin. Notably, it was the slow-migrating complex that appeared (Fig.4), indicating that the three SNARE proteins were assembling directly into the form in which complementary TMRs interact. Thus complexin not only binds rapidly (21Pabst S. Margittai M. Vainius D. Langen R. Jahn R. Fasshauer D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7838-7848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) but also exerts its function promptly on the assembling SNARE complex. In other words, it is SNARE complex assembly, rather than complexin function, that is the rate-limiting step in this reaction.Figure 4SNARE proteins assemble directly into the slow-migrating form of the SNARE complex in the presence of complexin. Full-length SNARE proteins were mixed in the presence or absence of complexin, and at indicated times the reaction was stopped by the addition of sample buffer. SNARE complex formation was detected by Western immunoblotting using monoclonal anti-synaptobrevin antibody, clone 69.1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)DISCUSSIONThe TMRs of SNARE proteins play a critical role in membrane fusion, which requires directed movement of two membranes by proteins under conditions of high membrane tension and curvature (28Monck J.R. Fernandez J.M. Neuron. 1994; 12: 707-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). It is thought that assembly of the cytoplasmic part of the SNARE complex exerts force on the transmembrane anchors, thereby generating inward and lateral movement in both membranes (2Jahn R. Sudhof T.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 863-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar, 9Sutton R.B. Fasshauer D. Jahn R. Brunger A.T. Nature. 1998; 395: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1900) Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been shown that syntaxin and synaptobrevin transmembrane regions actually interact via coiled-coil interactions (27Margittai M. Otto H. Jahn R. FEBS Lett. 1999; 446: 40-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 29Laage R. Rohde J. Brosig B. Langosch D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17481-17487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Zippering of the four-helix SNARE bundles is thought to be followed by interaction of the transmembrane parts of syntaxin and synaptobrevin leading to membrane fusion (29Laage R. Rohde J. Brosig B. Langosch D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17481-17487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Indeed, in a liposome fusion system, insertion of a linker between the transmembrane domain and the cytoplasmic part of syntaxin decreased fusion efficiency (30McNew J.A. Weber T. Engelman D.M. Sollner T.H. Rothman J.E. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 415-421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Furthermore, replacing the membrane anchors of syntaxin and synaptobrevin with short phospholipids that do not span the bilayer prevented lipid mixing (31McNew J.A. Weber T. Parlati F. Johnston R.J. Melia T.J. Sollner T.H. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 105-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). In the present study, we were able to utilize highly purified full-length SNAREs and a gel shift assay to follow interactions between complementary SNARE TMRs and thus to address the function of complexin.A recent structural analysis of complexin bound to the truncated SNARE complex showed that complexin seals the C-terminal interface between synaptobrevin and syntaxin (22Chen X. Tomchick D.R. Kovrigin E. Arac D. Machius M. Sudhof T.C. Rizo J. Neuron. 2002; 33: 397-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). By using NMR spectroscopy, Rizo and colleagues (22Chen X. Tomchick D.R. Kovrigin E. Arac D. Machius M. Sudhof T.C. Rizo J. Neuron. 2002; 33: 397-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar) further demonstrated that this action of complexin extends beyond the interacting region toward the C terminus where the membrane anchors would normally be located. By taking advantage of full-length SNARE proteins, we now provide the first evidence that complexin promotes interaction of the transmembrane regions of syntaxin and synaptobrevin. This function of complexin takes place after SNARE complex assembly (Fig. 2 B), consistent with binding studies (20Pabst S. Hazzard J.W. Antonin W. Sudhof T.C. Jahn R. Rizo J. Fasshauer D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19808-19818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 21Pabst S. Margittai M. Vainius D. Langen R. Jahn R. Fasshauer D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7838-7848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) and in vivo results that showed that complexin acts at the last step of exocytosis (16Reim K. Mansour M. Varoqueaux F. McMahon H.T. Sudhof T.C. Brose N. Rosenmund C. Cell. 2001; 104: 71-81Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). In the presence of complexin, the full-length SNARE proteins actually assemble directly into the slow-migrating complex (Fig. 4), which is the major form observed in bovine brain (Fig. 3 A). Importantly, our experiments suggest that interaction between complementary SNARE TMRs can take place in the absence of complexin, but complexin potently stabilizes SNARE complex in the form in which TMRs interact (Figs. 1and 2). Indeed, whereas complexin is not obligatory for synaptic vesicle exocytosis, it does increase evoked neurotransmitter release by 60–70% as demonstrated by complexin gene knockout in mice (16Reim K. Mansour M. Varoqueaux F. McMahon H.T. Sudhof T.C. Brose N. Rosenmund C. Cell. 2001; 104: 71-81Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar).Our experimental results are consistent with the findings of an independent study (21Pabst S. Margittai M. Vainius D. Langen R. Jahn R. Fasshauer D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7838-7848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) that questioned the recent proposal that complexin causes two contiguous SNAP-25 helices to oligomerize SNARE complex (17Tokumaru H. Umayahara K. Pellegrini L.L. Ishizuka T. Saisu H. Betz H. Augustine G.J. Abe T. Cell. 2001; 104: 421-432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). First, we do not observe any effect of complexin with full-length SNAP-25 and the truncated versions of syntaxin and synaptobrevin (Fig. 2 A). Second, because complexin acts after SNARE complex has entered its thermodynamically stable state (Fig. 2 B), a complexin-driven disassembly of SNARE complexes would have to take place to enable SNAP-25 to act as a cross-linker. Clearly, only NSF has been shown to disassemble SNARE complex (11Whiteheart S.W. Schraw T. Matveeva E.A. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2001; 207: 71-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 32Sollner T. Bennett M.K. Whiteheart S.W. Scheller R.H. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1993; 75: 409-418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1573) Google Scholar). Pabst et al. (21Pabst S. Margittai M. Vainius D. Langen R. Jahn R. Fasshauer D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7838-7848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) did not detect complexin-driven formation of slow-migrating SNARE complex, likely representing a TMR-mediated dimer of the ternary SNARE complex, possibly because SNARE proteins without TMRs were used, as shown here in Fig. 2. Indeed, one of our principal findings is that complexin promotes formation of the slow-migrating complex only when both syntaxin and synaptobrevin TMRs are present.In our study SNARE complex, assembled using syntaxin and synaptobrevin lacking TMRs, migrates as a single band. However, the original studies of the SDS-resistant properties of SNARE complex by Hayashi et al. (5Hayashi T. McMahon H. Yamasaki S. Binz T. Hata Y. Sudhof T.C. Niemann H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5051-5061Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar) reported that SNARE complexes assembled using truncated syntaxin and synaptobrevin, and bacterially expressed full-length SNAP-25 migrates as a number of bands. The difference is probably because of the fact that the recombinant full-length SNAP-25, used previously, contains exposed cysteine residues that can be cross-linked via disulfide bonds, causing artifactual aggregation of SNARE complexes. Full disruption of disulfide bonds in a protein sample requires boiling of the sample with β-mercaptoethanol; this boiling procedure cannot be used in studies of SNARE complex as it also disrupts the complex (5Hayashi T. McMahon H. Yamasaki S. Binz T. Hata Y. Sudhof T.C. Niemann H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5051-5061Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). In contrast, we used SNAP-25 purified from brain where cysteine residues are likely to be post-translationally palmitoylated (33Veit M. Sollner T.H. Rothman J.E.

Interestingly, we have found that APE1 can also inhibit the activities of both enzymes on substrates with a tetrahydrofuran (THF) residue on the 5′-downstream primer of a nick, simulating a reduced abasic site. However once the THF residue was displaced at least a single nucleotide, stimulation of FEN1 activity by APE1 resumes. Stimulation of DNA ligase I required the traditional nicked substrate. Furthermore, APE1 was able to enhance overall product formation in reconstitution of BER steps involving FEN1 cleavage followed by ligation. Overall, APE1 both stimulated downstream components of BER and prevented a futile cleavage and ligation cycle, indicating a far-reaching role in BER.

If not efficiently repaired, this damage can disrupt critical cellular processes such as DNA replication or transcription. The pathway responsible for repairing the most frequent types of DNA damage, which cause chemical alteration of nucleotide bases, is base excision repair (BER).1 Repair is initiated by the action of a damage-specific DNA N-glycosylase that is responsible for the recognition and removal of an altered base through cleavage of the N-glycosylic bond (1Krokan H.E.

FEBS Lett. 2000; 476: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Removal generates an apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) site, a non-coding DNA lesion that is both cytotoxic and mutagenic. The abasic site is the substrate for an AP endonuclease. APE1 (also called HAP1/REF1/APE) is a multifunctional enzyme that hydrolyzes the phosphodiester bond 5′ to an abasic site and is the predominant AP endonuclease in mammalian cells (3Kane C.M. Linn S.

The resulting 5′ terminus contains a deoxyribose phosphate residue (dRP), which must be removed and replaced in order to complete repair.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1477-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). A DNA ligase then seals the nick to complete repair. This generates a repair product wherein only the damaged nucleotide is replaced.In vivo, a portion of the AP sites become oxidized or reduced prior to repair (13Dianov G. Bischoff C. Piotrowski J.

This necessitates the removal of the damage through long patch BER. It has recently been shown that DNA polymerase β initiates polymerization in long patch BER by synthesizing a single nucleotide. Polymerase β is proposed then to dissociate and be replaced by DNA polymerase δ/ε for strand displacement synthesis of up to an additional 10 nucleotides, generating a single-stranded flap (18Podlutsky A.J.

The nick is then sealed by DNA ligase I to complete repair (20Tomkinson A.E. Lasko D.D. Daly G. Lindahl T. J. Biol.

In addition to its role in stimulating DNA polymerase δ, PCNA has been shown to directly interact with both FEN1 and DNA ligase I and stimulate their activities (32Li X., Li, J. Harrington J.

Chem. 2001; 276: 24817-24825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The mechanism underlying PCNA-directed stimulation of each of these components has been investigated thoroughly, and shown to be mediated through an increase in enzyme-substrate binding (36Tom S.

Chem. 2001; 276: 24817-24825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Moreover, PCNA is believed to provide a DNA-targeting function for both replication and repair protein complexes in which it coordinates sequential protein-protein interactions in order to facilitate enzymatic activity. RPA has been shown to enhance ligation by a unique mechanism involving the direct stimulation of DNA ligase I activity (38Ranalli T.A. DeMott M.S. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1719-1727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar).We have recently shown that the addition of the damage inducible cellular factor p21Cip1,Waf1,Sdi1 prevents PCNA-dependent enhancement of long patch BER in vitro (39Tom S. Ranalli T.A. Podust V.N. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48781-48789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The p21 protein has been shown to bind tightly to PCNA precluding interaction with polymerase δ/ε, FEN1, or DNA ligase I. While this is necessary for complete inhibition of DNA replication activity during periods of DNA damage, the long patch repair process is needed during such periods. We have proposed that BER can tolerate the loss of PCNA because APE1 can stimulate and coordinate the activities of the BER protein components.A systematic approach to determining the role of APE1 in the facilitation of BER is to examine its effect upon individual enzymatic steps downstream of the 5′-incision event. Interactions between APE1 and DNA polymerase β have been previously analyzed (17Bennett R.A. Wilson 3rd, D.M. Wong D. Demple B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7166-7169Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). APE1 was found to facilitate loading of polymerase β onto an incised substrate. Furthermore, during short patch repair APE1 enhanced removal of the dRP residue by polymerase β without altering polymerization activity. The role of APE1 in long patch BER is still being determined. APE1 was initially shown to directly interact with FEN1 and facilitate FEN1 cleavage in the presence of DNA polymerase β (40Dianova II Bohr V.A. Dianov G.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12639-12644Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar); however, the mechanism of stimulation was not determined. We report here that APE1 interacts with both FEN1 and DNA ligase I to stimulate their activities. Furthermore, APE1 coordinates the activities of the nuclease and ligase so that they are most effective on the appropriate substrates for correct stepwise progression through the repair pathway.DISCUSSIONLong patch base excision repair provides cells with the means to remove and replace damaged nucleotide bases. A characteristic of this repair pathway is that it employs many of the same proteins as lagging strand DNA replication (22DeMott M.S. Shen B. Park M.S. Bambara R.A. Zigman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30068-30076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 23Bambara R.A. Murante R.S. Henricksen L.A. J. Biol.

Bioessays. 1997; 19: 893-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 25Kim K. Biade S. Matsumoto Y. J. Biol.

In mammals, these include DNA polymerase δ/ε, RPA, FEN1, and DNA ligase I. Maximum efficiency of long patch base excision repair reactions carried out both in cell extracts and using purified proteins requires the participation of the PCNA toroid. PCNA is a homotrimer that encircles double-stranded DNA (46Kuriyan J. O'Donnell M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 915-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). It was first characterized as a “sliding clamp” for the DNA polymerase δ/ε complex to allow for processive DNA synthesis by tethering the polymerase to DNA. Subsequent studies of interactions with other replication proteins have suggested that PCNA tethers DNA replication and repair proteins to the DNA substrate in order to increase the efficiency of the reaction (36Tom S. Henricksen L.A. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10498-10505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 37Tom S. Henricksen L.A. Park M.S. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24817-24825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar).In mammals, the cellular response to DNA damage includes the expression of p21, which binds to and inactivates PCNA. Addition of p21 was also shown to inhibit long patch BER reconstituted using purified proteins (39Tom S. Ranalli T.A. Podust V.N. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48781-48789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The presence of the BER component APE1 was shown to stimulate steps in long patch BER occurring after APE1 incision of the abasic site. APE1 allowed an efficient completion of repair even in the absence of PCNA. This result led us to propose that aside from its role as a nuclease, APE1 has evolved to facilitate the steps of BER in a way that can partially compensate for the lack of PCNA (39Tom S. Ranalli T.A. Podust V.N. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48781-48789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar).A more complex role for APE1 is suggested from other results. Aside from its primary role in the recognition and 5′-cleavage of abasic sites, APE1 has been shown to actively displace the DNA glycosylase from a damage site (47Waters T.R. Gallinari P. Jiricny J. Swann P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 67-74Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 48Parikh S.S. Mol C.D. Slupphaug G. Bharati S. Krokan H.E. Tainer J.A.

Biol. 1999; 9: 37-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Additionally, APE1 is able to facilitate the loading of DNA polymerase β onto the incised substrate and to enhance polymerase β dRPase activity (17Bennett R.A. Wilson 3rd, D.M. Wong D. Demple B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7166-7169Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). It has also recently been shown that APE1 is able to interact with PCNA (40Dianova II Bohr V.A. Dianov G.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12639-12644Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). This interaction, which has no functional consequence on APE1 activity, may be a way to directly recruit the long patch BER components to sites of APE1 bound to damaged DNA (40Dianova II Bohr V.A. Dianov G.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12639-12644Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The significance of APE1 is also highlighted by results showing that a knock-out of APE1 in mice is lethal (50Wilson 3rd, D.M. Takeshita M. Demple B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 933-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar).Here we have explored the influence of APE1 on the final two steps of long patch BER, flap cleavage by FEN1 and joining of the strands by DNA ligase I. Our results show that both reactions are stimulated by the presence of APE1. FEN1 has also been previously shown to directly interact with APE1 in vitro (40Dianova II Bohr V.A. Dianov G.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12639-12644Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar).Examining the FEN1 cleavage reaction first, we found that APE1 displayed a similar level of stimulation for both the endo- and exonucleolytic activities of FEN1. Also, the sequence of the substrate did not influence the stimulation. Since APE1 binding of the substrate induces a bend, we considered that it may have effected stimulation by altering the nick substrate structure to create a double flap. However, when such a structure was preformed on the substrate, stimulation was still observed. Natural substrates have equilibrating double flaps. APE1 also stimulated cleavage on these structures. Overall these results indicate that the stimulatory process is not dependent on either the flap configuration or length.Cleavage of a double flap structure, the natural substrate of FEN1, produces a nick that is a substrate for DNA ligase. DNA ligase I, thought to conduct the final ligation step in long patch BER, was also stimulated by the presence of APE1. DNA ligase I has a high affinity for a nick site, making it unlikely that APE1 would be able to effectively compete with ligase for that binding site. It is therefore unlikely that DNA ligase I was held on at the nick by APE1. We hypothesize that the stimulation was a result of a direct interaction of APE1 with the ligase.The interplay of proteins becomes more complex on THF substrates that represent repair intermediates expected in vivo. A nick substrate with a THF at the 5′-side of the nick represents a natural intermediate of repair formed just after APE1 cleavage of an abasic site. THF represents a nucleotide that has been stripped of its base and reduced. The THF structure is not recognizable to FEN1 as a nucleotide. Although the THF does not prevent FEN1 cleavage from occurring, it does alter the way in which FEN1 deals with the substrate. FEN1 cannot cleave between the THF and the adjacent nucleotide residue and must instead cleave between the next recognizable nucleotides (22DeMott M.S. Shen B. Park M.S. Bambara R.A. Zigman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30068-30076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Inability to cleave off the THF does not present a problem in long patch BER since polymerization displaces the THF into a flap. The flap then reconfigures to a double flap. FEN1 cleaves at the base of the 5′-flap to produce a nick, which is subsequently ligated.The presence of APE1, which is normally stimulatory, was strongly inhibitory to both FEN1 and DNA ligase I on the nick-THF substrate. Since it is unnecessary for FEN1 to cleave this substrate, the inhibitory effect would not influence BER. Significantly, DNA ligase I is capable of resealing the THF nick, reversing the initial APE1 cleavage. This highly undesirable reaction creates a futile cleavage and ligation cycle that would short circuit the repair process. APE1-directed inhibition of the ligation reaction coordinates steps in the repair process to ensure that the THF lesion is removed before ligation can occur. Once the THF is displaced into a flap, APE1 stimulation of FEN1 activity is restored. FEN1 can then create a lesion-free nick for ligation.The final experiment examined the effect of APE1 on the last two steps of long patch BER beginning with a THF-terminated flap. With just FEN1, an enhancement of cleavage was seen. When the reaction contained both FEN1 and DNA ligase I, both cleavage and ligation were enhanced. Increase in final product formation was not as great as would be expected from the amounts of stimulation of the FEN1 and the DNA ligase I reactions when measured alone. This may be because the mechanism of FEN1 stimulation involves higher affinity binding of the nuclease to the substrate. Thus, FEN1 binds the substrate in addition to the nick product, better in the presence of APE1. Because of the enhanced binding of FEN1 to the nick product, it may not cycle off quickly to allow DNA ligase binding. However, the overall effect of APE1 is to stimulate the rate of final repaired DNA product formation.In summary, APE1 does not act merely as a component of the long patch BER pathway, but also as a facilitator and coordinator of most of the steps. It was previously found to displace the DNA glycosylase from the abasic site prior to cleavage (47Waters T.R. Gallinari P. Jiricny J. Swann P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 67-74Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 48Parikh S.S. Mol C.D. Slupphaug G. Bharati S. Krokan H.E. Tainer J.A.

A. 1997; 94: 7166-7169Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). We show here that it blocks re-ligation of a damaged site but promotes later flap cleavage and ligation of an unmodified nick. The exact mechanisms by which APE1 stimulates both FEN1 and DNA ligase I are still under investigation. Chromosomal DNA is regularly damaged by reactive oxygen species generated during cellular metabolism and exposure to damaging environmental agents such as ultraviolet light or ionizing radiation. If not efficiently repaired, this damage can disrupt critical cellular processes such as DNA replication or transcription. The pathway responsible for repairing the most frequent types of DNA damage, which cause chemical alteration of nucleotide bases, is base excision repair (BER).1 Repair is initiated by the action of a damage-specific DNA N-glycosylase that is responsible for the recognition and removal of an altered base through cleavage of the N-glycosylic bond (1Krokan H.E. Standal R. Slupphaug G. Biochemical Journal. 1997; 325: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar, 2Krokan H.E. Nilsen H. Skorpen F. Otterlei M. Slupphaug G. FEBS Lett. 2000; 476: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Removal generates an apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) site, a non-coding DNA lesion that is both cytotoxic and mutagenic. The abasic site is the substrate for an AP endonuclease. APE1 (also called HAP1/REF1/APE) is a multifunctional enzyme that hydrolyzes the phosphodiester bond 5′ to an abasic site and is the predominant AP endonuclease in mammalian cells (3Kane C.M. Linn S.

The resulting 5′ terminus contains a deoxyribose phosphate residue (dRP), which must be removed and replaced in order to complete repair. Following APE1 cleavage, BER can then proceed via two pathways, designated short or long patch repair (2Krokan H.E. Nilsen H. Skorpen F. Otterlei M. Slupphaug G.

In the short patch repair pathway DNA polymerase β adds a single nucleotide and also cleaves the 5′-deoxyribose phosphate residue using an intrinsic deoxyribosephosphate lyase (dRP lyase) activity (16Matsumoto Y.

This generates a repair product wherein only the damaged nucleotide is replaced. In vivo, a portion of the AP sites become oxidized or reduced prior to repair (13Dianov G. Bischoff C. Piotrowski J.

Knockout experiments of this gene have been described in budding yeast, fission yeast, and chicken cells, but no study has been reported on human Scc1 thus far. In this study, we found that an N-terminally truncated human Scc1 shows a dominant-negative effect, and we examined the phenotypes of human cells defective in Scc1 function. Scc1 defects led to failure of sister chromatid cohesion in both interphase and mitotic cells. Interestingly, four chromatids derived from two homologues occupied four distinct territories in the nucleus in chromosome painting experiments. In mitotic Scc1-defective cells, chromatids were disjoined with normal condensation, and the spindle-assembly checkpoint was activated. We also found that, although the disjoined kinetochore (half-kinetochore) in Scc1-defective cells contains CENP-A, -B, -C, and -E normally, it apparently does not establish the kinetochore-microtubule association.

This sister chromatid cohesion ensures that the two daughter cells inherit an identical set of genetic information. It is well established that the sister chromatid cohesion is accomplished by a phylogenetically conserved protein complex called cohesin (reviewed in Ref. 1Nasmyth K. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2001; 35: 673-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). Cohesin was identified genetically for the first time in budding yeast and contains at least four components: Scc1/Mcd1, Scc3, Smc1, and Smc3 (2Guacci V. Koshland D. Strunnikov A. Hogan E.

Specifically, Scc1 dissociates from chromosomes in a single step of the metaphase-to-anaphase transition in budding yeast, mediated by its proteolysis by a protease called Esp1 or separase (9Uhlmann F. Lottspeich F. Nasmyth K. Nature. 1999; 400: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar). In contrast, the dissociation occurs in two steps in vertebrates, from the arm regions in prophase and from the centromeric region in the metaphase-to-anaphase transition (5Losada A. Hirano M. Hirano T. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1986-1997Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar, 10Waizenegger I.C. Hauf S. Meinke A. Peters J.M.

Chem. 2001; 276: 5059-5067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The bulk Scc1 dissociation in prophase occurs independently of separase, and is regulated by Polo-like kinase in Xenopus (12Sumara I. Vorlaufer E. Stukenberg P.T. Kelm O. Redemann N. Nigg E.A. Peters J.M. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 515-525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar), whereas the Scc1 dissociation from kinetochores at the metaphase-to-anaphase transition in human cells is achieved by the proteolysis of Scc1 by Esp1 (13Hauf S. Waizenegger I.C. Peters J.M. Science. 2001; 293: 1320-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Scc1 also plays an important role in kinetochore function. In budding yeast, it was reported that kinetochore-microtubule association can be established, but sister kinetochores frequently associate with monopoles (14Tanaka T. Fuchs J. Loidl J. Nasmyth K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 492-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). It was therefore concluded that Scc1 is important for the bipolar attachment of the sister kinetochores. A similar observation was reported in Scc1-depleted chicken DT40 cells, albeit the number of sister chromatids showing monopolar attachment was small (8Sonoda E. Matsusaka T. Morrison C. Vagnarelli P. Hoshi O. Ushiki T. Nojima K. Fukagawa T. Waizenegger I.C. Peters J.M. Earnshaw W.C. Takeda S. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 759-770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Because the centromeres in higher eukaryotes have a much larger size and are much more complex than those in budding yeast, it is possible that Scc1 plays different roles in kinetochore function in higher eukaryotes. In this study, we found that the N-terminally truncated hScc1 (human Scc1) shows a dominant-negative effect in human cells. By exploiting this allele, we examined the phenotypes of Scc1-defective human cells. The full-length hScc1 cDNA and the deletion mutants, hScc1ΔN (287–631 aa)1 and hScc1ΔC (1–415 aa), were subcloned into pEGFP expression vectors (Clontech) and pMX-puro retroviral expression vector (15Kitamura T. Onishi M. Kinoshita S. Shibuya A. Miyajima A. Nolan G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9146-9150Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The retrovirus vectors were transfected into φNX amphotropic packaging cells (a gift from Dr. G. P. Nolan), and allowed to produce infectious retroviruses. HT1080 Tet-On cells, which constitutively express thetet-responsive trans-activator, were originally established and kindly provided by Dr. Y. Ishizaka (International Medical Center, Tokyo, Japan) (16Shimura M. Tanaka Y. Nakamura S. Minemoto Y. Yamashita K. Hatake K. Takaku F. Ishizaka Y. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 621-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). An effector plasmid, pTO/hScc1ΔN, was constructed by inserting hScc1ΔN (287–631 aa) to pTO that possesses the tet-responsive DNA element and the hygromycin selection marker gene (16Shimura M. Tanaka Y. Nakamura S. Minemoto Y. Yamashita K. Hatake K. Takaku F. Ishizaka Y. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 621-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). HT1080 Tet-On cells were transfected with pTO/hScc1ΔN and pTO-mock. Cells were cultured in the presence of G418 (400 μg/ml) and hygromycin (50 μg/ml). Twenty clones showing resistance to both drugs were selected and analyzed for inducible expression of hScc1ΔN after incubation with 1 μg/ml doxycycline for 48 h. One clone that showed the lowest background expression without induction and the highest expression with induction was used in this study. Western blotting was performed according to Ref. 11Hoque M.T. Ishikawa F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5059-5067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar. In all IF analyses, cells were grown in chamber slide glasses (Falcon). Cells were fixed with 100% methanol for 20 min at −20 °C and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min. Fixed cells were pre-incubated in blocking solution (0.1% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% skim milk in PBS), followed by incubation with primary antibodies for 1 h at 37 °C in the blocking solution. Cells were then washed three times with shaking in PBS, and incubated with secondary antibodies for 1 h at 37 °C. The cells that were washed with PBS three times were mounted in the mounting solution containing 0.25 μg/ml propidium iodide (PI) or TOTO3, and examined by laser confocal microscopy (Zeiss). IF analysis for 3F3/2 antigen was performed according to Ref. 17Gorbsky G.J. Chen R.H. Murray A.W. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1193-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar. Two cosmid clones, cCI12–156 and pBR12, specific for chromosome 12 short arm telomere and the chromosome 12 centromere, respectively, were kindly provided by Dr. K. Okumura (Mie University, Mie, Japan) (18Nogami M. Nogami O. Kagotani K. Okumura M. Taguchi H. Ikemura T. Okumura K. Chromosoma. 2000; 108: 514-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). FISH experiments were performed using samples fixed with methanol:acetic acid essentially as described in Ref. 19Lichter P. Cremer T. Tang C.J. Watkins P.C. Manuelidis L. Ward D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 9664-9668Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar with slight modifications. Slides were taken from −20 °C storage and dried at room temperature for 30 min. Nuclei were treated with 1 mg/ml pepsin (Sigma) in 10 mm HCl solution. Cells were washed with PBS and dehydrated gradually by rinsing them in succession with 70, 85, and 100% ethanol. Cellular DNA was denatured at 80 °C in 50% formamide in 2× SSC solution and dehydrated in succession with 70, 85, and 100% ice-cold ethanol. cCI12–156 and pBR12 probes were labeled with biotin-16-dUTP by the nick-translation method according to the supplier's protocol (BMY). Biotin-labeled probes were precipitated in presence of carrier salmon sperm DNA (Sigma) and competitor human Cot-1 DNA (BMY). Probes were then dissolved in hybridization solution (50% formamide (v/v), 10% dextran sulfate in 2× SSC), and denatured at 75 °C for 10 min. Denatured probes were pre-annealed at 37 °C for 30 min. Then, they were added to denatured nuclei and hybridized at 37 °C for 16 h in a humidified chamber. After hybridization, the slides were washed with 50% formamide in 2× SSC solution at 42 °C (three times, 5 min each) and with 2× SSC solution at 62 °C (three times, 5 min each). The biotinylated probe was detected using fluorescein-labeled avidin Fab fragment (Vector Laboratories), and finally nuclei were washed three times with 0.1% Tween 20 in 4× SSC solution at 42 °C. The nuclei were counterstained with PI and maintained in anti-fade medium (Vector Laboratories). The images were examined by laser confocal microscopy (Zeiss). Cells were fixed with methanol:acetic acid and denatured in 50% deionized formamide in 2× SSC solution for 2 min at 70 °C. Slides were transferred quickly to a coplin jar containing 70% ice-cold ethanol and incubated for 5 min. Then, the slides were incubated in succession with 85 and 100% ice-cold ethanol, each for 5 min, and finally air-dried. An aliquot of the digoxigenin-labeled whole chromosome 12 painting probe (BMY) was denatured for 10 min at 75 °C and pre-annealed at 37 °C for 30 min. The probe was added to the denatured nuclei, covered with a cover glass, and sealed with rubber cement. The slides were then transferred to a humidified chamber and incubated therein at 37 °C for 16 h. Then, the slides were washed twice with 50% formamide in 2× SSC solution for 15 min in a shaking water bath at 42 °C, followed by washing two times with 0.1% Tween 20 in 2× SSC solution at room temperature. Anti-digoxigenin-rhodamine Fab fragment (BMY) was diluted with PBS/bovine serum albumin solution and incubated with nuclei for 60 min in a humidified chamber at 37 °C. Slides were washed twice with 0.1% Tween 20 in 2× SSC solution, and DNA was counterstained with 0.1 μg/ml PI in PBS solution. The images were examined by laser confocal microscopy (Zeiss). Because Scc1 functions by forming a complex with Scc3, Smc1, and Smc3, it was expected that some deletion mutants of Scc1 might show a dominant-negative effect. Accordingly, we transfected the hScc1 cDNA encoding full-length, N-terminally or C-terminally truncated Scc1 (deleted for aa 1–286 or 416–631, respectively; Fig.1 A) fused with the N-terminal EGFP into 293T cells (EGFP-hScc1, EGFP-hScc1ΔN, or EGFP-hScc1ΔC, respectively). Scc1 contains a proline-rich region and a glutamate-rich region at the C-terminal half, which are absent in hScc1ΔC and retained in hScc1ΔN. The two truncated Scc1 proteins contain the putative nuclear localization sequence at their centers. Consistently, all EGFP-fused hScc1 proteins localized in the nuclei, where endogenous Scc1 is present (11Hoque M.T. Ishikawa F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5059-5067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), whereas EGFP-mock protein found in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1 B). We next analyzed the cell cycle profiles of these transfectants. Cells at 48 h after the transfection were fixed, stained with PI, and analyzed by FACScan. To examine specifically the cells expressing the recombinant proteins, we first sorted the EGFP-positive cells and then analyzed the cell cycle profile of this population. Although overexpressing EGFP-hScc1 and EGFP-hScc1ΔC as well as EGFP-mock did not change the cell cycle profile, a significant decrease of the G1 fraction and an increase of the G2+M fraction were observed in EGFP-hScc1ΔN-overexpressing 293T cells (Fig. 1 C). The fraction of G2+M cells in EGFP-hScc1ΔN-overexpressing 293T cells was ∼40%, which is more than twice of those observed in the other transfectants. These results suggest that overexpressing hScc1ΔN interferes with the normal cell cycle progression, leading to cell cycle arrest at G2/M. The above results suggested that hScc1ΔN has a dominant effect on endogenous hScc1 protein. To investigate this possibility, we examined the sister chromatid cohesion in hScc1ΔN-expressing normal human fibroblast MRC-5 cells. Cells were infected with retroviral expression vector encoding FLAG-tagged wild-type hScc1 (wt-hScc1), hScc1ΔN, or hScc1ΔC mutant protein. The infected cells were analyzed at the indicated time after the completion of infection without drug selection (0 h). In a parallel control experiment, the transfection efficiency was estimated to be ∼40%. First, we monitored the proliferation rates. The wt-hScc1- and hScc1ΔC-expressing MRC-5 cells grew as well as the mock-infected cells (Fig. 2 A). In contrast, the hScc1ΔN-expressing MRC-5 cells grew less efficiently, which was evident at 72 h. We speculated that the impaired cell growth was a result of the cohesion defect. To test this possibility, asynchronously growing infected MRC-5 cells at 48 h were examined by FISH experiments using pBR12, a probe specific for the chromosome 12 centromere (referred to as 12CEN probe) (18Nogami M. Nogami O. Kagotani K. Okumura M. Taguchi H. Ikemura T. Okumura K. Chromosoma. 2000; 108: 514-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). We found that the 12CEN signals in the wt-hScc1- and hScc1ΔC-expressing populations showed either one of the following three patterns: two separate spots, one spot and one set of twin spots, and two sets of twin spots. These three patterns were interpreted as two 12CENs unreplicated, one 12CEN replicated and the other unreplicated, and both 12CENs replicated, respectively. Fig. 2 B (a) shows one representative wt-hScc1-expressing cell that remained to replicate two homologous 12CENs. In contrast, we found that a significant fraction of the hScc1ΔN-expressing populations showed three or four separately located FISH spots, suggesting failure of cohesion at the chromosome 12 centromere most possibly in G2 cells (Fig. 2 B, b). We next examined the spread chromosomes in mitotic cells. In mitotic cells in wt-hScc1-expressing populations, two 12CEN-positive chromosomes were observed in all cases examined (Fig. 2 B,c), suggesting that the ectopic expression of wt-hScc1 does not interfere with the normal chromatid cohesion in mitosis. However, in hScc1ΔN-expressing populations, the number of condensed chromosomes was frequently larger than those found in the parental MRC-5 cells and wt-hScc1-expressing populations (Fig. 2 B,d–f). Most importantly, four 12CEN-positive chromosomes were frequently observed separately in hScc1ΔN-expressing populations. It was often observed that one of the 12CEN-positive chromosomes was completely separated from others (for example,d and f). However, it was unlikely that the four FISH signals represented four pairs of chromatids in tetraploid cells, because we did not find any significant increase in the number of hScc1ΔN-expressing cells with hyperploidy (data not shown). These observations indicate that two pairs of sister chromatids are disjoined in hScc1ΔN-expressing cells. We also noticed that the chromosomes in hScc1ΔN-expressing populations were condensed normally as in parent MRC-5 cells. To determine the fate of these cells, we monitored the later time points after retrovirus infection. When DNA and actin were stained with PI and anti-actin antibodies, respectively, we found that a significant number of cells in hScc1ΔN-expressing populations contained multiple nuclei in a single cell after 72 h of infection (Fig.2 C). In contrast, neither wt-hScc1- nor hScc1ΔC-expressing populations displayed such phenotypes (data not shown). The amounts of DNA in these nuclei varied. These results suggest that cohesin-defective cells show defects in chromosome segregation and form multiple nuclei in a single cell. To investigate the effect of hScc1ΔN in greater detail, we used an inducible expression system in human fibrosarcoma HT1080 cells that we confirmed to contain near-diploid chromosomes (data not shown). Using this approach, we were able to induce hScc1ΔN expression by the addition of doxycycline to the culture medium (hScc1ΔN-HT1080 cells; see “Materials and Methods”). hScc1ΔN was endowed with a C-terminal FLAG epitope that allowed its detection by FLAG-monoclonal antibodies. No detectable hScc1ΔN was expressed in the absence of doxycycline; in contrast, hScc1ΔN was induced upon the addition of doxycycline, which reached a plateau 2–3 days after the addition (Fig.3 A). By immunostaining with anti-FLAG antibody, we found that the hScc1ΔN protein was localized in the hScc1ΔN-HT1080 cell nuclei (data not shown). The uninduced hScc1ΔN-HT1080 cells, as well as mock-treated HT1080 cells with or without doxycycline addition, proliferated at a similar rate (data not shown). However, as expected, hScc1ΔN-HT1080 cells that had been induced to express hScc1ΔN protein showed a significantly reduced growth rate (data not shown). In the following experiments, hScc1ΔN-HT1080 cells grown in the presence or absence of doxycycline for 48 h were analyzed. Sister chromatid cohesion in these cells was examined by FISH experiment using cosmid clones cCI12–156 (Fig. 3 B) and pBR12 (Fig. 3 C), which recognize the telomere at the short arm of chromosome 12 and the centromere of the same chromosome, respectively. The cell cycle stage was determined by using a laser scanning cytometer (reviewed in Ref. 20Darzynkiewicz Z. Bedner E., Li, X. Gorczyca W. Melamed M.R. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 249: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). This apparatus scans and records the two-dimensional position and the PI intensity, thereby determining the cell cycle stage for individual cells in a population on a slide glass. After the recording, cells of interest can be recalled and analyzed for a second chromo-probe. In both experiments using cCI12–156 or pBR12, two single spots and two sets of twin spots were observed in the uninduced hScc1ΔN-HT1080 cells at G1and G2 phases, respectively (Fig. 3 B,a and b; data not shown). In contrast, four completely separated FISH spots were frequently observed in induced G2 cells (Fig. 3 B, c). These four spots were not derived from four homologous chromosomes in tetraploid cells, because no significant fraction of tetraploid cells was detected. As for the pBR12 probe specific for the chromosome 12 centromere, four FISH spots were observed in 25% of the total population of the induced hScc1ΔN-HT1080 cells and in 3% of the uninduced cells (Fig. 3 C). We therefore concluded that the expression of hScc1ΔN also caused premature sister chromatid separation in this system. The four spots did not show any tendency of clustering into two groups; rather, they appeared to distribute randomly. The average distances between one FISH spot to the nearest one in the induced cells with four spots were 10.87 and 10.84 μm for cCI12–156 and pBR12 probes, respectively (data not shown). We noticed that the areas occupied by nuclei on the glass slide were larger in the induced G2 cells with four FISH spots (504.85 μm2) than in the uninduced G2 cells with two set of twin spots (346.14 μm2) (Fig. 3 D). No significant difference in nuclear area was observed between the induced and uninduced G1 cells, suggesting that the increase in nuclear area was related to the failure of sister chromatid cohesion. It was interesting to know if the entire chromatids of chromosome 12 were disjoined in the hScc1ΔN-expressing cells. To address this question, a similar analysis was conducted using a chromosome 12 painting probe. The uninduced G2 cells showed two separate chromosome 12 territories (Fig. 3 E, a). In contrast, four distinct territories were observed in a significant fraction of the induced G2 cells (Fig. 3 E,b). These results demonstrate that the four sister chromatids of two chromosomes 12 are separated in the G2phase. The four chromatids appeared to be randomly positioned in nuclei. There was no recognizable DNA connection between these remote chromatin masses, suggesting that the chromatids were completely separated without major DNA tangling. Next, we analyzed the M phase of the induced hScc1ΔN-HT1080 cells. Because it was not possible to synchronize HT1080 cells, we examined asynchronous cells by PI staining and immunostaining with anti-α-tubulin and anti-γ-tubulin antibodies (Fig.4 A). In uninduced cells, we observed normal metaphase and anaphase cells (Fig.4 A, a, d, and e). In contrast, we frequently observed abnormal anaphase-like configurations (hereafter referred to as pseudo-anaphase) in induced cells (Fig.4 A, b, c, and f). Despite the fact that the bipolar spindle was evident in IF experiments using anti-α- and anti-γ-tubulin antibodies, the chromosome DNA was excluded from the area occupied by the spindle. Indeed, it appeared that there was no kinetochore-microtubule association, and that the chromosome mass was mechanistically divided into two or three groups by the spindle. Moreover, the orientation of the polar spindle was perpendicular instead of parallel to the splitting orientation of chromosome masses. To interpret these results quantitatively, we measured the relative frequencies of cells showing the metaphase, anaphase, or pseudo-anaphase configurations in induced and uninduced populations. The pseudo-anaphase was defined by the appearance that the orientation of interpolar microtubules (when stained with anti-α-tubulin) or the interpolar axis (when stained with anti-γ-tubulin) was perpendicular to the splitting orientation of chromosomes. When more than 500 cells that appeared in metaphase, anaphase, or pseudo-anaphase were scored, 18% of induced cells, in contrast to 3∼4% of uninduced cells, showed the pseudo-anaphase configuration (Fig. 4 B). We therefore concluded that pseudo-anaphase cells were specifically observed in cells expressing hScc1ΔN. To examine kinetochore microtubule association in the induced hScc1ΔN-HT1080 cells in greater detail, we double-stained the cells with anti-CENP-C and anti-α-tubulin antibodies along with the DNA dye TOTO3 (Fig. 4 C). CENP-C is a protein that associates with functional kinetochores (21Pluta A.F. Mackay A.M. Ainsztein A.M. Goldberg I.G. Earnshaw W.C. Science. 1995; 270: 1591-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). In uninduced cells in metaphase and anaphase (Fig. 4 C, a and b, respectively), most kinetochores were found to associate with microtubules. In contrast, many kinetochores, if not all, appeared to associate with no microtubule in induced pseudo-anaphase cells (Fig.4 C, c). It was also noted that few kinetochores were positioned closely to monopoles, and that most kinetochores were excluded from the spindle periphery. These results strongly suggest that the kinetochores cannot establish microtubule association. We further examined the existence of other centromere-binding proteins CENP-A, -B, and -E at the kinetochores in the induced hScc1ΔN-HT1080 cells. CENP-E is a kinesin-like protein that functions as a kinetochore motor (22Wood K.W. Sakowicz R. Goldstein L.S. Cleveland D.W. Cell. 1997; 91: 357-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). All of these proteins were detected at the kinetochores in induced pseudo-anaphase cells. Therefore, we suggest that at least some aspects of the structural integrity of the kinetochores are maintained. Because the induced hScc1ΔN-HT1080 cells did not enter normal anaphase, and appeared defective in establishing microtubule-kinetochore connection, we were interested in whether the spindle-assembly checkpoint was activated in these cells or not. To address this question, we investigated the localization of the key spindle-assembly checkpoint proteins Mad2 and 3F3/2 in these cells. As shown previously (for review see Refs. 23Rieder C.L. Salmon E.D. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 310-318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar and 24Maney T. Ginkel L.M. Hunter A.W. Wordeman L. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2000; 194: 67-131Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), both the mitotic checkpoint proteins Mad2 and 3F3/2 phosphoepitope are accumulated on kinetochores until they establish stable bipolar microtubule attachment. When the chromosomes are aligned on the metaphase plate by equal tensions applied by bipolar spindles, these proteins disappear from the kinetochores (25Gorbsky G.J. Ricketts W.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1311-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 26Waters J.C. Chen R.H. Murray A.W. Salmon E.D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1181-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). When the uninduced hScc1ΔN-HT1080 cells were examined for human Mad2 (hMad2) and 3F3/2 localizations by using specific antibodies, these proteins were found to localize at the kinetochores until metaphase and to disappear at anaphase, as expected (Fig. 5, A (a andb) and B (a–c)). In contrast, the kinetochores of the induced pseudo-anaphase cells were positive for these proteins (Fig. 5, A (c) and B(d)). If the spindle-assembly checkpoint was indeed activated in these induced cells in the M phase, it was expected that these cells would still maintain a high level of cyclin B1, because of the failure of anaphase-promoting complex activation (27Holloway S.L. Glotzer M. King R.W. Murray A.W. Waters J.C. Chen R.H. Salmon E.D. Cell. 1993; 73: 1393-1402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar, 28King R.W. Peters J.M. Tugendreich S. Rolfe M. Hieter P. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1995; 81: 279-288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar). Indeed, we found a high level of cyclin B1 in the induced pseudo-anaphase cells (Fig. 5 C, c), but not in the uninduced anaphase cells (Fig. 5 C, a and b). To confirm these results, we measured the frequencies of hMad2-, 3F3/2-, and cyclin-B1-positive cells in different stages of cell cycle (Fig. 5 D). More than 250 cells each showing metaphase, anaphase, or pseudo-anaphase in the hScc1ΔN-expressing HT1080 population were examined by IF analyses for hMad2, 3F3/2, and cyclin B1, and the frequency of IF-positive cells was deduced. We found that 56, 4.5, and 92% of metaphase cells were positive for hMad2, 3F3/2, and cyclin B1, respectively. This result is consistent with previous studies showing that hMad2 remains to associate with kinetochores until later metaphase stages than the 3F3/2 epitope does (25Gorbsky G.J. Ricketts W.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1311-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 26Waters J.C. Chen R.H. Murray A.W. Salmon E.D. J.

https://openalex.org/W1989931191,"Insulators are sequences that uncouple adjacent chromosome domains. Here we have shown that Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rap1p and Abf1p proteins are endowed with a potent insulating capacity. Insulating domains in Rap1p coincide with previously described transcription activation domains, whereas four adjacent subdomains spanning the whole of the Abf1p C terminus (440–731) were found to display autonomous insulating capacity. That both Rap1p and Abf1p silencing domains either contain or largely overlap with an insulating domain suggests that insulation conveys some undefined chromosome organization capacity that also contributes a function in silencing. Together with Reb1p and Tbf1p, previously involved in the activity of Saccharomyces cerevisiaesubtelomeric insulators, insulating potential emerges as a supplementary common property of General Regulatory Factors (GRFs). Thus GRFs, which bind to sites scattered throughout the genome within promoters, would not only play a key role in regulating gene expression but also partition the genome in functionally independent domains."

Methylated DNA is generally associated with transcriptionally inactive heterochromatin (1Bird A.P. Trends Genet. 1987; 3: 342-347Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (649) Google Scholar). In contrast, actively expressed genes are generally hypo-methylated and found in an open euchromatin configuration. Appropriate cytosine methylation is essential for normal mammalian development. For example, individual disruption of the genes encoding the methyltransferases Dnmt1, Dnmt3a, or Dnmt3b result in an embryonic lethal phenotype in mice (2Li E. Bestor T.H. Jaenisch R. Cell. 1992; 69: 915-926Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3246) Google Scholar, 3Okano M. Bell D.W. Haber D.A. Li E. Cell. 1999; 99: 247-257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4574) Google Scholar), and overexpression of Dnmt1 leads to hyper-methylation of DNA, loss of genomic imprinting, and embryonic lethality (4Biniszkiewicz D. Gribnau J. Ramsahoye B. Gaudet F. Eggan K. Humpherys D. Mastrangelo M.-A. Jun Z. Walter J. Jaenisch R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2124-2135Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). More subtle mutations within human Dnmt3b result in ICF (immunodeficiency, centromere instability, and facial anomalies) syndrome (5Xu G.-L. Besteor T.H. Bourc'his D. Hsieh C.-L. Tommerup N. Bugge M. Hulten M., Qu, X. Russso J.J. Viegas-Pequignot E. Nature. 1999; 402: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar), and mutations of methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2)1 lead to Rett syndrome, a progressive neurodegenerative disorder (6Amir R.E. Van den Veyver I.B. Wan M. Tran C.Q. Francke U. Zoghbi H.Y. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 185-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (3859) Google Scholar). In addition, hyper-methylation of tumor suppressor genes is commonly observed in cancer cells (7Baylin S.B. Herman J.G. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 168-173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1408) Google Scholar). Despite the importance of appropriate cytosine methylation patterns for normal mammalian development, little is known regarding the regulation of this process. Several DNA-binding proteins have been described that interact specifically with methylated CpG motifs. These include MeCP2, methyl CpG-binding domain (MBD) protein 1, MBD2, and MBD4 (8Hendrich B. Bird A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6538-6547Crossref PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar). In addition, MBD3 is a component of the Mi-2 histone deacetylase and nucleosome remodeling complex (9Wade P.A. Gegonne A. Jones P.L. Ballestar E. Aubry F. Wolffe A.P. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 62-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). Similarly, MBD2 is a component of the MeCP1 histone deacetylase complex (10Ng H.-H. Zhang Y. Hendrich B. Johnson C.A. Turner B.M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Teinberg D. Bird A. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 58-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar), thus linking cytosine methylation with histone acetylation and providing a unifying framework for the control of chromatin structure and gene regulation. CpG-binding protein (CGBP) is a recently described DNA-binding protein that exhibits a novel binding affinity for DNA sequences containing unmethylated CpG motifs (11Voo K.S. Carlone D.L. Jacobsen B.M. Flodin A. Skalnik D.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2108-2121Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Consistent with this binding specificity, CGBP acts as a trans-activator of transcription in co-transfection experiments. Interestingly, the single DNA-binding domain of CGBP is composed of a cysteine-rich CXXC domain (12Lee J.-H. Voo K.S. Skalnik D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44669-44676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The CXXC domain is only found in a few other proteins, including Dnmt1, MBD1, human trithorax (HRX/MLL/ALL-1), and MLL-2 (11Voo K.S. Carlone D.L. Jacobsen B.M. Flodin A. Skalnik D.G. Mol. Cell.

Reciprocal chromosomal translocations involving the HRX gene are commonly observed in acute leukemia. Little is known regarding the function of the related MLL-2 gene, although it is amplified in some cancer cell lines (15Tkachuk D.C. Kohler S. Cleary M.L. Cell. 1992; 71: 691-700Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar, 16Gu Y. Nakamura T. Alder H. Prasad R. Canaani O. Cimino G. Croce C.M. Canaani E. Cell. 1992; 71: 701-708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar). In contrast to CGBP, these other CXXC domain proteins contain additional distinct DNA-binding domains, and the role of the CXXC domain within these factors is unclear. However, recent studies (17Birke M. Schreiner S. Garcia-Cuellar M.-P. Mahr K. Titgemeyer F. Slany R.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 958-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 18Fujita N.

Ligand selection of high affinity binding sites from a pool of degenerate double-stranded oligonucleotides reveals a consensus binding site for CGBP of (A/C)CpG(A/C) (12Lee J.-H. Voo K.S. Skalnik D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44669-44676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Individual mutation of highly conserved cysteine residues within the CXXC domain of CGBP completely abrogates DNA binding activity, and this domain requires the presence of zinc for efficient DNA binding activity (12Lee J.-H. Voo K.S. Skalnik D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44669-44676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In addition, CGBP contains two copies of the plant homeodomain (PHD), a motif found in several dozen proteins implicated in modulation of chromatin structure and gene regulation (11Voo K.S. Carlone D.L. Jacobsen B.M. Flodin A. Skalnik D.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2108-2121Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 19Aasland R. Gibson T.J. Stewart F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 56-59Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). Recently, the PHD finger of the polycomb-like protein was found to mediate direct interaction with the protein “enhancer of zeste” (20O'Connell S. Wang L. Robert S. Jones C.A. Saint R. Jones R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43065-43073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), and a PHD domain within the chromatin-associated KAP-1 protein cooperates with a bromodomain to recruit a chromatin-remodeling complex (21Schultz D.C. Friedman J.R. Raushcer F.J. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 428-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the PHD finger within CREB-binding protein contributes to the acetyltransferase activity of this factor (22Kalkhoven E. Teunissen H. Houweling A. Verrijzer C.P. Zantema A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1961-1970Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Importantly, we have recently reported that CGBP-null mice exhibit a peri-implantation lethal phenotype (23Carlone D.L. Skalnik D.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7601-7606Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), thus demonstrating the requirement of CGBP for normal mammalian development. Although the molecular basis for this phenotype is still under investigation, it is intriguing that CGBP-null embryos die at a developmental stage during which global changes of cytosine methylation occur (24Monk M. Boubelik M. Lehnert S. Development. 1987; 99: 371-382Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Kafri T. Ariel M. Brandeis M. Shemer R. Urven L. McCarrey J. Cedar H. Razin A. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 705-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). Given the DNA binding specificity of CGBP and its structural similarity to other proteins involved in the regulation and function of cytosine methylation and chromatin structure, it is tempting to speculate that CGBP-null embryos die from dysregulated gene expression, at least partially as a consequence of altered chromatin structure. In an effort to better understand the global function of CGBP, and its possible role in modulating chromatin structure, experiments were performed to determine the subcellular localization of CGBP and define the protein domains required to direct this distribution. HEK-293 (human embryonic kidney) and NIH-3T3 (mouse embryonic fibroblast) cells were grown as monolayers in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (HyClone, Logan, UT) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. For subcellular localization and immunofluorescence experiments, cells were cultured on a coverslip in a 24-well dish and transfected with 1–2 μg of DNA by calcium-phosphate co-precipitation (26Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 274-2752Google Scholar). Following transfection, cells were grown in fresh media for 24 h, and fixed with cold methanol or 4% paraformaldehyde. For co-transfection assays, cells at ∼60% confluency were transfected with 10–20 μg of DNA by calcium phosphate co-precipitation. Following transfection, cells were grown in fresh media for 24–48 h prior to analysis. Trans-activation assays were performed by co-transfecting HEK-293 cells with a fixed amount (2.5 μg) of CMV-based pEGFP reporter vector and various amounts of pcDNA3 FLAG-CGBP expression vector. The total amount of DNA in each sample was equalized by adding pcDNA3 plasmid. Cells were harvested and analyzed by Western blot as described above. Sequential nuclear extraction was performed as described (27Reyes J.C. Muchardt C. Yaniv M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 263-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Cells were transfected with 5–10 μg of DNA by calcium-phosphate co-precipitation. Following transfection, cells were grown in fresh media for 48 h and used for analysis. Cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and extracted with cytoskeleton buffer (CSK) containing 10 mm Pipes (pH 6.8), 100 mm NaCl, 300 mm sucrose, 3 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, supplemented with the protease inhibitors leupeptin, aprotinin, and pepstatin (1 μg/ml each), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100. After extraction for 5 min on ice, the proteins solubilized in CSK buffer were recovered following separation from the insoluble fraction by centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 3 min. Chromatin was solubilized by digestion with 30 units of DNase I (RNase-free) in CSK buffer containing protease inhibitors for 20 min at 37 °C. The chromatin fraction was extracted for 5 min on ice by adding 1 mammonium sulfate in CSK buffer to a final concentration of 0.25m and centrifuging as above. The pellet was further extracted with 2 m NaCl in CSK buffer for 5 min on ice. The remaining pellet was solubilized with sodium phosphate buffer containing 8 m urea, which was considered the nuclear matrix fraction. Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford assay. For Western blot analysis, an equivalent proportion of each fraction was solubilized in Laemmli sample buffer (28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Following electrophoresis on a 6–12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane (MSI, Westborough, MA). The membrane was then incubated with either anti-CGBP antibody (11Voo K.S. Carlone D.L. Jacobsen B.M. Flodin A. Skalnik D.G. Mol. Cell.

Deletion mutations of CGBP were prepared using a combination of restriction enzyme digestions and PCR amplification usingPfu polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and subcloned into pEGFP and/or pcDNA3-FLAG vectors. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed on the CXXC domain of CGBP using primers that mutate cysteine residues to alanine using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, CA) in accordance with the protocol provided by the manufacturer. Mutagenesis oligonucleotides include C169A (mutates cysteine 169 to alanine), 5′-cggtcagcccgcatggctggtgagtgtgaggcatg-3′, and C208A (mutates cysteine 208 to alanine), 5′-gccggctgcgccaggcccagctgcgggccc-3′. Each mutation was subcloned into the pFLAG-CMV (Sigma) and pEGFP vectors. The nucleotide sequences of truncated and mutated CGBP constructs were confirmed by automated DNA sequencing. Cells were seeded onto a cover glass at 2–5 × 104cells/well in a 24-well dish and transfected as described above.

Appropriate secondary antibody labeled with Texas Red (2 μg/ml in blocking solution) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were washed three times with PBS containing 0.2% Tween 20 for 5 min. Nuclear counterstaining was performed with 0.1 μg/ml DAPI in PBS for 5 min followed by washing with PBS. Cells were mounted with 10 μl of Fluoromount G (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Birmingham, AL) and observed using a fluorescence microscope or were scanned with a Zeiss LSM 510 laser scanning confocal microscope. Bromouridine triphosphate was used forin situ detection of RNA synthesis in permeabilized cells using immunodetection with antibody directed against bromouridine (Harlan Sera-lab, Indianapolis, IN) as described previously (32Zhang S. Herrmann C. Grosse F. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2693-2703PubMed Google Scholar). Confocal immunofluorescence was performed on HEK-293 and NIH-3T3 cells using antisera directed against CGBP. The endogenous CGBP protein was localized to the nucleus in both cell lines and exhibits a punctate or speckled distribution (Fig.1 A). Transfection of these cells with a vector expressing GFP-tagged full-length human CGBP results in a similarly speckled nuclear distribution of the GFP-CGBP fusion protein (Fig. 1 A). These speckles are concentrated in areas of DAPI light staining, consistent with localization of CGBP to euchromatic regions of the nucleus (Fig. 1 B). Co-localization experiments were conducted to better characterize the nature of the nuclear speckles containing CGBP. Cells were co-transfected with vectors expressing epitope-tagged (GFP or FLAG) CGBP or an epitope-tagged marker protein. The results presented in Fig.2 indicate that CGBP exhibits a subnuclear distribution that is entirely distinct from that of MBD1, MeCP2, and HP1α, each of which has been found to localize within regions of heterochromatin (8Hendrich B.

In contrast, a small fraction of CGBP-containing speckles co-localize with the RNA splicing factor SC-35 and with actively transcribed regions of the genome. However, CGBP exhibits significant co-localization with acetylated histone H3 and acetylated histone H4, which are markers for areas of euchromatin. Importantly, the set of nuclear speckles that contain CGBP is identical to that detected as containing the amino terminus (amino acids 1–1436) of HRX, which has previously been reported to localize within a novel class of nuclear speckles and to associate with the nuclear matrix (35Caslini C.

A. 1997; 94: 7286-7291Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Further microscopy studies were performed to examine the localization of CGBP in metaphase cells. As reported previously (18Fujita N. Takebayashi S.-I. Okumura K. Kudo S. Chiba T. Saya H. Nakao M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6415-6426Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), MBD1 is found tightly associated with heterochromatic condensed chromosomes at metaphase (Fig. 3, bottom row). In contrast, GFP-CGBP exhibits a highly diffuse distribution during this phase of the cell cycle (Fig. 3, top row). It is excluded from the condensed chromosomes and does not exhibit a punctate distribution during metaphase. Finally, biochemical fractionation experiments were utilized as an independent method to further assess the subcellular localization of CGBP. HEK-293 and NIH-3T3 cells were successively extracted to recover soluble, chromatin-associated, and nuclear matrix-associated protein fractions. Western blot analyses demonstrate that endogenous CGBP is nearly exclusively associated with the nuclear matrix fraction (Fig.4). Western blots were also performed with antisera directed against NuMA and acetylated histone H3 as controls for the integrity and purity of the nuclear matrix and chromatin-associated protein fractions, respectively (38Zeng C., He, D. Brinkley B.R. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1994; 29: 167-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 39Berube N.G. Smeenk C.A. Picketts D.J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 539-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). We conclude that CGBP associates with the nuclear matrix, consistent with the previously reported nuclear matrix association of the co-localizing protein HRX (35Caslini C. Serna Alarcon A. Hess J.L. Tanaka R. Murti K.G. Biondi A. Leukemia (Baltimore). 2000; 14: 1898-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Experiments were performed to identify the signals required for CGBP association with the nuclear matrix and nuclear speckles. For example, the DNA binding activity of Ikaros has been found to be essential for its localization to heterochromatin speckles (40Cobb B.S. Morales-Alcelay S. Kleiger G. Brown K.E. Fisher A.G. Smale S.T. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2146-2160Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Experiments were conducted to determine whether the DNA binding activity of CGBP is similarly required for the observed subcellular distribution. Mutations of conserved cysteine residues within the CXXC domain that ablate DNA binding activity (12Lee J.-H. Voo K.S. Skalnik D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44669-44676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) were introduced into GFP-CGBP fusion proteins. The subcellular localization of these DNA-binding deficient forms of CGBP was assessed in both NIH-3T3 and HEK-293 cells. Confocal microscopy and biochemical fractionation reveals that both of these mutated constructs co-localize with wild type full-length CGBP FLAG-tagged protein (Fig.5 A) and associate with the nuclear matrix (Fig. 5 B). Hence, DNA binding activity was not required for targeting of CGBP to nuclear speckles. Rather, this localization was presumably mediated via protein/protein interactions. We have demonstrated previously (11Voo K.S. Carlone D.L. Jacobsen B.M. Flodin A. Skalnik D.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2108-2121Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) that CGBP strongly trans-activates the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter, which contains numerous CpG motifs. As expected, the DNA-binding deficient CGBP constructs fail to trans-activate a co-transfected reporter gene vector composed of the CMV promoter/enhancer driving expression of GFP (Fig. 5 C). Note that wild type CGBP additionally auto-activates expression of the CGBP expression vector, which also contains the CMV promoter (Fig.5 C,top panel). In order to define the nuclear localization signals within CGBP, a series of truncated versions of CGBP (Fig.6 A) was generated and expressed in NIH-3T3 cells as GFP fusion proteins (Fig. 6 B). Successive truncations from the carboxyl terminus of CGBP reveals that a fragment as short as amino acids 1–122 is localized to the nucleus (Fig. 6). However, truncation to amino acids 1–103 results in a cytoplasmic localization. Hence, a nuclear localization signal resides within amino acids 104–122 of CGBP. Inspection of the amino acid sequence of this domain (DEGGGRKRPVPDPDLQRRA) (11Voo K.S. Carlone D.L. Jacobsen B.M. Flodin A. Skalnik D.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2108-2121Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) reveals a cluster of basic residues (in boldface) consistent with a consensus bipartite nuclear localization signal (RKRX 8RR) (41Jans D.A. Hubner S. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 651-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Importantly, the 302–656 amino acid fragment of CGBP is also partially localized to the nucleus, indicating the presence of at least one additional nuclear localization signal in the carboxyl half of the CGBP protein. Expression of the basic domain of CGBP (amino acids 318–367) as a GFP fusion protein is sufficient to direct efficient nuclear localization, thus defining a second nuclear localization signal. This 40-amino acid fragment contains 65% histidine, arginine, or lysine residues. The GFP fusion protein containing CGBP amino acids 361–481 is evenly distributed between the nucleus and cytoplasm, suggesting a nonspecific diffusion of this small peptide throughout the cell. The downstream fragment of CGBP containing amino acids 483–656 is excluded from the nucleus, indicating the absence of nuclear localization signals downstream of the coiled-coil domain. It is surprising that the isolated basic domain localized to the nucleus more efficiently than a longer fragment (amino acids 302–656), which also contains the basic domain. Presumably elements within the downstream sequence act to mask the nuclear localization signal located within the basic domain when expressed in this fashion. Addition of the upstream CGBP nuclear localization signal (amino acids 109–121) to the 302–656 construct results in efficient nuclear localization (Fig. 6 B). Additional truncated versions of GFP-CGBP fusion proteins were expressed in NIH-3T3 cells to identify protein domains required to target CGBP to nuclear speckles. A fragment of CGBP (amino acids 1–481) lacking the PHD2 domain exhibits a speckled nuclear distribution (Fig. 6 B). However, additional truncation to amino acid 367 (amino acids 1–367), which deletes the coiled-coil domain, results in a partially speckled pattern with much of the GFP fusion protein distributed diffusely throughout the nucleus. Further truncation to amino acid 320 (amino acids 1–320), which additionally deletes the basic domain, results in a complete loss of nuclear speckling and a diffuse nuclear distribution. Hence, signals encoded within the basic and coiled-coil domains are required for directing a punctate distribution of CGBP. Truncation of the amino terminus of the protein reveals that amino acids 1–301, including the PHD1 domain, CXXC DNA-binding domain, and a portion of the acidic domain, are not required for directing a punctate distribution, as the CGBP fragment containing amino acids 302–656 exhibits a speckled nuclear distribution (Fig.6 B). The CGBP fragment containing amino acids 103–481 also exhibits a punctate nuclear distribution, similar to the pattern produced by expression of full-length GFP- or FLAG-CGBP (Fig. 6,B and C). Similar to the results described above, removal of the coiled-coil domain from the carboxyl-t"

To analyze the function of these receptors, we have developed a transactivation assay based on the transcriptional stimulation of a retinoic acid receptor-related receptor response element (RORE)-linked promoter-reporter construct. Co-transfection of aBombyx cell line with a BmHR3A expression construct results in constitutive activation of the reporter, whereas expression of BmE75 has no measurable effects on reporter expression. However, when the BmE75 receptors are co-introduced with BmHR3A into the cells, the BmHR3A-mediated transactivation is repressed. Repression of BmHR3A by BmE75 occurs by two distinct mechanisms. Increasing doses of BmE75 efficiently displace BmHR3A bound to the RORE target site in gel retardation assays, indicating that both receptors compete for common DNA target sites. However, analysis of the function of deletion mutants of BmE75 in the transactivation assay indicates that repression can also occur in the absence of the DNA-binding domain and that the C-terminal F domain is sufficient for repression. In gel retardation assays, the two receptor types form a ternary complex on a single RORE, suggesting that repression is also mediated by protein interactions on the DNA target site. Yeast two-hybrid assays show that BmHR3A interacts with BmE75 and that this interaction is dependent on the C terminus of BmHR3A and the F domain of BmE75. Because the C terminus of BmHR3A contains a strong activation domain, we predict that BmE75 blocks activation by BmHR3A through competition for co-activator binding sites located at the C terminus of BmHR3A. Our data also indicate that the transcriptional activities of BmHR3A and BmE75 are integrated in such a way that activation of RORE-linked target genes depends on the relative expression levels of the two receptor types.

Brown N.E. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 25: 881-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The mRNA of E75 is typically induced within 30 min of hormone treatment, and the induction also occurs in the presence of protein synthesis inhibitors, suggesting a direct control of E75 gene transcription by the hormone-bound ecdysone receptor complex (2Segraves W.A. Hogness D.S. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 204-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 3Palli S.R. Ladd T.R. Ricci A.R. Sohi S.S. Retnakaran A. Dev.

Biol. 1998; 193: 127-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The accumulation of HR3 mRNA, on the other hand, occurs more slowly (starting 2–3 h after hormone exposure) and requires synthesis of additional factors for maximal expression (5Palli S.R. Hiruma K. Riddiford L.M. Dev. Biol. 1992; 150: 306-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 6Horner M.A. Chen T. Thummel C.S. Dev.

Ecdysone-induced E75 and HR3 proteins are subsequently thought to function as transcription factors and play essential roles in the implementation of the 20E-induced gene expression cascade (8Thummel C.S. Bioessays. 1997; 19: 669-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The ovary of the silk moth Bombyx mori is a target of 20E during early pupation (9Tsuchida K. Nagata M. Suzuki A. Arch. Insect Biochem. Biophysiol. 1987; 5: 167-177Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 10Swevers L. Iatrou K. Mech. Dev. 1998; 72: 3-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Administration of 20E to developmentally arrested abdomens causes abrupt induction of BmE75 and BmHR3, the silk moth homologs of the E75 and HR3 nuclear receptors, with kinetics similar to those observed in target tissues of other insects (11Eystathioy T. Swevers L. Iatrou K. Mech. Dev. 2001; 103: 107-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 12Swevers L. Eystathioy T. Iatrou K. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2002; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, however, different isoforms for both types of receptors, characterized by unique N-terminal regions, exist in the silk moth ovary and differ in their hormone induction patterns. Among the BmE75 isoforms, BmE75A and BmE75C mRNAs are induced within 30 min by the hormone, but the decline of the BmE75C mRNA occurs much faster than that for the mRNA of BmE75A (12Swevers L. Eystathioy T. Iatrou K. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2002; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, among the BmHR3 isoforms, BmHR3B and BmHR3C mRNAs are induced after 2–3 h, in contrast with the mRNA of the BmHR3A isoform, which accumulates in ovarian tissue 2 days after hormone administration (11Eystathioy T. Swevers L. Iatrou K. Mech. Dev. 2001; 103: 107-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In addition to the hormonal induction in the immature ovary at the beginning of pupation, the expression of HR3 and E75 isoforms in the silk moth ovary is also regulated in a hormone-independent fashion during pharate adult development and can be correlated with specific stages of oogenesis. Thus, the expression of BmHR3A coincides with vitellogenesis (11Eystathioy T. Swevers L. Iatrou K. Mech. Dev. 2001; 103: 107-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), whereas BmE75C is only expressed during a brief period at the transition from vitellogenesis to choriogenesis (12Swevers L. Eystathioy T. Iatrou K. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2002; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). BmE75A, on the other hand, has a more ubiquitous expression pattern and is present in both previtellogenic and vitellogenic follicles. The expression at specific stages of oogenesis suggests a role for BmE75 and BmHR3 in the implementation of the developmental program of follicle differentiation in the ovary. The E75 and HR3 nuclear receptors were previously shown to bind as monomers to similar extended nuclear hormone receptor DNA half-sites consisting of the core motif AGGTCA preceded by an A/T-rich extension (6Horner M.A. Chen T. Thummel C.S. Dev. Biol. 1995; 168: 490-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 11Eystathioy T. Swevers L. Iatrou K. Mech.

Biol. 1996; 26: 485-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Such extended half-sites are known as retinoic acid receptor-related receptor response elements (ROREs) because they were originally identified as the binding sites for the ROR receptors, the mammalian homologs of the insect HR3 receptors (16Giguère V. Tini M. Flock G. Ong E. Evans R.M. Otulakowski G. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 538-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). The ability of E75 and HR3 to bind to similar DNA target sites, combined with the simultaneous expression of both receptors in tissues that are challenged by hormone, raises questions regarding whether the receptors will compete for common target sites in the DNA and the effects this competition will have on the transcriptional activation of target genes. In this study, we tested the capacity of several Bombyx E75 and HR3 receptors for binding to a consensus RORE in gel retardation assays and activation of a minimal promoter-reporter construct harboring four copies of a RORE motif in its upstream region in transient expression assays using B. mori tissue culture cells. BmHR3A was found to bind efficiently to the RORE in vitro and was identified as a strong constitutive activator in tissue culture cells. The BmE75 nuclear receptors (A and C isoforms) (12Swevers L. Eystathioy T. Iatrou K. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2002; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar) also bind the RORE motif, but their overexpression in transient expression assays does not result in measurable effects on reporter gene activity. However, BmE75 is identified as an important cofactor for BmHR3A function because it efficiently represses transcriptional activation by BmHR3A. We therefore propose that the transcriptional status of BmHR3A target genes in silk moth cells is determined by the relative levels of expression of BmHR3A and its silencing partners BmE75A and BmE75C. One clear mechanism of inhibition of BmHR3A by BmE75 is predicted to occur by competition for common DNA target sites. However, unexpectedly, it was also found that repression of the function of BmHR3A can occur in the absence of the DNA-binding domain (DBD) of BmE75 and that BmE75 is recruited to RORE-containing promoters through protein-protein interactions that involve the F domain of BmE75 and the C terminus of BmHR3A. Because the C terminus of BmHR3A harbors determinants that are essential for transactivation, a model is proposed in which BmE75 blocks the function of BmHR3 by preventing, through its F domain, the recruitment of co-activators to the C terminus of BmHR3. Recombinant derivatives of the Bluescript plasmid (pBS/SK+; Stratagene) containing the complete open reading frames (ORFs) of BmHR3A, BmE75A, and BmE75C (11Eystathioy T. Swevers L. Iatrou K. Mech.

Biol. 2002; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar) were linearized with SalI or BamHI and transcribed in vitro with T3 RNA polymerase (Amersham Biosciences). The transcribed RNA was translated in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega) using the manufacturer's protocol. Gel mobility shift assays were carried out as described previously (17Swevers L. Cherbas L. Cherbas P. Iatrou K. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1996; 26: 217-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The double-stranded oligonucleotide probe ROREdro, which was derived from theDrosophila FTZ-F1 promoter and used in the bandshift assays, has been described previously (11Eystathioy T. Swevers L. Iatrou K. Mech. Dev. 2001; 103: 107-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Competition assays were carried out in the presence of a 10-fold molar excess of unlabeled oligonucleotides or pBS/SK+ DNA. All procedures for transfection, cell harvest, protein extraction, CAT assays, and dot blot hybridizations were as described previously (18Johnson R. Meidinger R.G. Iatrou K. Virology. 1992; 190: 815-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). For each condition, one million cells were transfected with 0.5 μg of cat gene reporter construct in the presence or absence of 0.5 μg of each nuclear receptor expression vector and additional pBS/SK+ (to a total amount of 1.5 μg) in 0.5 ml of basal IPL-41 medium (Invitrogen) containing 15 μl of Lipofectin (Invitrogen). Quantification of cat gene activity was carried out by PhosphorImager analysis (AmershamBiosciences). The probe used in dot blot hybridizations was a 0.9-kbBamHI fragment containing the CAT ORF. The cat gene reporter construct pBmbA/ROREdro.cat consisted of the basal actin promoter harboring four copies of the ROREdro element in its upstream region (11Eystathioy T. Swevers L. Iatrou K. Mech. Dev. 2001; 103: 107-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The expression plasmids for BmHR3A, BmE75A, and BmE75C (as well as their deletion mutants; see below), i.e. pEA.hr3a, pEA.e75a, and pEA.e75c, respectively, were based on plasmid p13315 (19Lu M. Farrell P. Johnson R. Iatrou K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30724-30728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), which contains a viral enhancer sequence inserted upstream of the actin promoter in pBmA (18Johnson R. Meidinger R.G. Iatrou K. Virology. 1992; 190: 815-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The construction of plasmid pEA.hr3a has been described previously (11Eystathioy T. Swevers L. Iatrou K. Mech. Dev. 2001; 103: 107-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Plasmids pEA.e75a and pEA.e75c were obtained after cloning a 2.4-kbNotI fragment encompassing the complete ORF of BmE75A and a 2.6-kb NotI fragment encompassing the complete ORF of BmE75C, respectively, into the NotI site of the polylinker of p13315 (12Swevers L. Eystathioy T. Iatrou K. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2002; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Gal4 activation domain/cDNA fusion (prey) plasmid libraries were screened for proteins that interact with BmE75C using the MATCHMAKER Two Hybrid System (Clontech). A Gal4 DBD/BmE75C protein hybrid (bait) plasmid was constructed by cloning the 2.6-kb BmE75C ORF and 3′-untranslated region into the BamHI/NotI site of the pGBT9 plasmid (Clontech) in-frame with Gal4-DBD. Two “prey” plasmid libraries were constructed by directional cloning of cDNAs prepared from follicular epithelial cells of B. mori follicles into the pGAD424 plasmid (Clontech). One library contained cDNAs (insert lengths ≥ 0.5 kb) prepared from previtellogenic and vitellogenic follicles, whereas the other library contained cDNAs prepared from choriogenic follicles (insert lengths ≥ 1 kb). The two libraries, each consisting of 1.6 × 107 and 1 × 107 primary clones, respectively, were mixed before screening. An initial screening of 107 transformants performed in the absence of 3-aminotriazole (Sigma) yielded a large number of colonies (>20,000). The cells of these colonies were pooled and used for a second screening in the presence of 20 mm3-aminotriazole. From the second screening, 31 true positive clones were isolated that produced significant levels of β-galactosidase only in the presence of the bait plasmid. Fresh overnight cultures of Saccharomyces cerevisiae HF7c strain (Clontech) harboring both pGBT9 and pGAD424 bait and prey plasmids (Clontech), respectively, or their fusion derivatives, were prepared in 1 ml of synthetic dropout medium (Clontech) containing 20 μg/mll-histidine (Sigma). The cultures were diluted 5-fold with water to yield turbidity of 0.25–0.35 at 600 nm. Diluted cell suspensions (1.5 ml) were centrifuged at 5000 × g for 5 min, and cell pellets were resuspended in 200 μl of zymolase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mmMgCl2, and 1 m sorbitol) containing 30 mm dithiothreitol. After a 15-min incubation at room temperature, the suspensions were recentrifuged for 5 min at 2000 × g, and the pellets were resuspended in 100 μl of zymolase buffer containing 1 mm dithiothreitol. After the addition of 25 units of lyticase (Sigma), samples were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min under continuous shaking. The samples were centrifuged for 5 min at 1500 × g, and the cell pellets were lysed by vortexing in 840 μl of Z buffer (100 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7, 10 mm KCl, and 1 mm MgSO4) containing 40 mmβ-mercaptoethanol. O-Nitrophenyl β-d-galactoside (Sigma; 160 μl of a 4 mg/ml solution) was added, and samples were incubated at room temperature. After 90 min, the reactions were quenched by the addition of 600 μl of 1m Na2CO3. β-Galactosidase activities were measured as optical densities at 420 nm, and the obtained values were corrected for differences in turbidity of the cultures at 600 nm. Relative activities were expressed as percentages of the activity observed for the control sample monitoring the interaction between p53 and SV40 large T-antigen (pVA3 and pTD1 plasmids; Clontech). To obtain the N-terminal deletion mutant of BmHR3A, a 0.4-kb PCR fragment was generated by combining the forward primer TTGGGCCCAACATGGCCCAAATCGAGATAATACC that consists of the translation start site (in italic, containing anApaI site; nt 270–281 in Ref. 11Eystathioy T. Swevers L. Iatrou K. Mech. Dev. 2001; 103: 107-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) fused to the start of the common region (nt 381–400) with the reverse primer CGAAGACAACGGCGACCCG (nt 809–791). The resultant PCR fragment was digested with ApaI and XhoI and used to replace a 0.5-kb ApaI/XhoI-fragment encompassing the N terminus of full-length BmHR3A. To obtain the C-terminal deletion mutant of BmHR3A, a 0.1-kb PCR fragment was generated using forward primer TCCTGGCCAAGATACCCACT (nt 1600–1619) and reverse primer AAGCGGCCGCTTAATGCGGATGCGTCGCTTT that consists of aNotI site, a stop codon (both in italic), and sequences of the ligand-binding domain (nt 1682–1665). The resultant PCR fragment was digested with BglII and NotI and used to replace a 0.3-kb BglII/NotI fragment containing the C terminus and 3′-untranslated region of BmHR3A. BmHR3A deletion mutants were cloned as ApaI/NotI fragments into the SmaI/NotI sites of the polylinker of p13315 to generate plasmids pEA.hr3aΔN, pEA.hr3aΔC, and pEA.hr3aΔN/C (Fig. 1 B). To obtain N-terminal deletion mutants of BmE75, 0.6- and 0.4-kb PCR fragments were generated using one of the forward primers (AAGCGGCCGCGACTATGGAATTTGACGGTACCACG and AAGCGGCCGCGACTATGAGCAGAGATGCTGTG) that consist of aNotI site, the translation start of BmE75C (both initalic; translation start corresponds to nt 225–231 of the sequence of BmE75C; Ref. 12Swevers L. Eystathioy T. Iatrou K. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2002; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar), and either the start of the common region of BmE75 (first primer, nt 499–522 of BmE75C) or the start of the hinge region (second primer, nt 724–738) combined with the common reverse primer GAAGCCAGGGATGAGGCCGG (nt 1080–1061). The PCR fragments were digested with NotI and MluI and used to replace a 0.8-kb NotI/MluI fragment encompassing the N terminus of BmE75C. To obtain the expression plasmid for the F domain of BmE75, the cDNA clone of BmE75C in pBS/SK+ was digested withHincII (nt 1558, in the first codon of the F domain) andXhoI (polylinker of pBS/SK+) to release the sequences upstream of the F domain of BmE75. A double-stranded oligonucleotide that contains a XhoI 5′ overhang, aNotI site, the translation start of BmE75C (the latter two in italic), the last codon of the ligand-binding domain, and the first base of the F domain with the sequence 5′-TCGAGCGGCCGCGACTATGCGTC-3′ 3′-CGCCGGCGCTGATACGCAG-5′ was subsequently ligated upstream of the F domain between the HincII and XhoI sites. To obtain C-terminal deletion mutants of BmE75, a 0.2-kb PCR fragment was generated by combining forward primer CGGCCTGGCCTGCGAAAC (nt 1351–1368 in BmE75C) with reverse primer AAGCGGCCGCTCAACGCAATAACTCCTTATGTTC that consists of aNotI site, a stop codon (both in italic), and sequences at the end of the ligand-binding domain (nt 1558–1537). The PCR fragment was digested with NruI and NotI and used to replace a 1.6-kb NruI/NotI fragment encompassing the C terminus (F domain) and 3′-untranslated region of BmE75. To obtain the expression plasmid for the DNA-binding domain/hinge region of E75, the pBS/SK+ clone that contains the N-terminal-deleted mutant of BmE75 was digested completely withMluI (nt 901 in BmE75C) and partially with NotI (polylinker) to remove the F domain, the ligand-binding domain, and 26 bp at the 3′ end of the hinge region. A double-stranded oligonucleotide containing a MluI 5′ overhang (italic), the seven C-terminal codons of the hinge region, a stop codon, and aNotI 5′ overhang (the latter two in italic) with the sequence 5′ CGCGTGATCGCGTCGCTTCCATGCGATGAGC 3′ 3′ACTAGCGCAGCGAAGGTACGCTACTCGCCGG 5′ was subsequently ligated downstream of the DNA-binding domain/hinge region using theMluI and NotI sites. BmE75 deletion mutants were cloned as NotI fragments in plasmid p13315 to generate the expression vectors pEA.e75ΔN, pEA.e75ΔN/DBD, pEA.e75aΔF, pEA.e75cΔF, pEA.e75ΔN/F, pEA.e75ΔN/DBD/F, pEA.e75(F), and pEA.e75(DBD-H) (Fig.3 A). A 1.6-kb ApaI/NotI fragment encompassing the complete ORF of BmHR3A was ligated to theBamHI/SalI site of the pGAD424 vector in-frame with the Gal4 activation domain through aBamHI/ApaI adaptor at the 5′ end and anNotI/SalI adaptor at the 3′ end to generate plasmid Prey/HR3A. A 1.4-kb ApaI/NotI fragment containing BmHR3A with the last 26 C-terminal amino acids (aa) deleted (described above) was cloned in similar fashion to generate plasmid Prey/HR3AΔC. To obtain plasmid Prey/HR3(LBD), PCR was employed using the primers 5′-GGAGGGTGACATTAGCAAGG-3′ and 5′-TCCGTGCGTGTAATCTAAAAC-3′ to generate a fragment that contained the LBD and its surrounding regions (22 aa of the hinge region and 10 aa of the F domain). The fragment was subsequently cloned into theSmaI site of pGAD424 in-frame with the Gal4 activation domain. To generate pGBT9 derivatives that produce Gal4-DBD/E75 fusion proteins, a BamHI restriction site (italic, see below) was introduced at the translation start of BmE75A, BmE75C, and BmE75D by PCR. PCR fragments were produced using the forward primer 5′-GTTGGATCCTGATGTCTCCGGATAGT-3′ for BmE75A or 5′-GTTGGATCCCTATGCAGTGTTATCCG-3′ for BmE75C and the reverse primer 5′-GTTGTCGACCGTGGTACCGTCAAATTC-3′ for BmE75A or 5′-GACGGTTCTTCGAATGATGG-3′ for BmE75C. The PCR fragments were digested with BamHI and KpnI (A isoform) orBamHI and ApaI (C isoform) and used to replace the N termini of the different BmE75 isoforms. BmE75 isoforms with aBamHI site introduced at their N terminus were subsequently digested with BamHI and NotI and cloned, through the use of a NotI/SalI adaptor, intoBamHI-SalI-digested pGBT9 vector in-frame with the DBD of Gal4 to generate plasmids Bait/E75A and Bait/E75C. To generate plasmids Bait/E75ΔN and Bait/E75ΔN/DBD/H, plasmid Bait/E75C was digested with BamHI/KpnI orBamHI/MluI, respectively, to release N-terminal sequences and was self-ligated with the help of suitable adaptors to ensure the continuity of the ORF with the Gal4 DBD. To obtain plasmid Bait/E75ΔN/F, a 1.05-kbBamHI/HincII fragment of Bait/E75ΔN was cloned into the BamHI/PstI site of pGBT9 after blunt-ending of the PstI site by T4 DNA polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). To obtain plasmid Bait/E75ΔN/LBD/F, plasmid Bait/E75ΔN was digested with MluI and NotI, blunt-ended with T4 DNA polymerase, and self-ligated. Plasmid Bait/E75(F) was generated by subcloning a 1.3-kbHincII/NotI fragment of BmE75C into theBamHI/NotI site of pGBT9 through the use of aBamHI/HincII adaptor. To examine whether BmHR3A is capable of recognizing RORE DNA target sites, bandshift experiments were carried out using BmHR3A produced byin vitro transcription/translation. The RORE selected for the gel retardation assay was derived from the DrosophilaFTZ-F1 promoter (the “A” element; Ref. 13Lam G. Jiang C. Thummel C.S. Development. 1997; 124: 1757-1769PubMed Google Scholar) and corresponded to a perfect match to the consensus vertebrate RORE (6Horner M.A. Chen T. Thummel C.S. Dev. Biol. 1995; 168: 490-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 A, BmHR3A binds FTZ-F1 RORE in a specific manner. To investigate whether BmHR3A is capable of activating RORE-linked reporter genes, transient expression experiments were carried out. In these experiments, a BmHR3A expression vector (pEA.hr3a) was transfected into silk moth tissue culture cells (Bm5 cells) together with a reporter construct containing four copies of the FTZ-F1 RORE linked to a basal promoter (pBmAb/ROREdro). As demonstrated previously (11Eystathioy T. Swevers L. Iatrou K. Mech. Dev. 2001; 103: 107-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), BmHR3A activates the RORE-linked promoter by ∼75-fold (76.1 ± 1.3, n = 9; Fig.1 C). Most nuclear receptors contain two distinct regions that are involved in the activation of transcription: a ligand-independent activation function 1 (AF-1) residing in the N terminus, and a ligand-dependent activation function 2 (AF-2) residing in the ligand-binding domain (20Mangelsdorf D.J. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 841-850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2805) Google Scholar). Whereas different subregions in the ligand-binding domain contribute to AF-2, the integrity of an amphipathic α-helix at the C terminus of the ligand-binding domain (helix 12 in the conserved structure of the ligand-binding domain of nuclear receptors) (21Wurtz J.-M. Bourguet W. Renaud J.-P. Vivat V. Chambon P. Moras D. Gronemeyer H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar) was shown to be indispensable for ligand-dependent activation. A similar amphipathic α-helix, characterized by the conserved motif ΦΦXEΦΦ (Φ being a hydrophobic amino acid andX being a nonconserved amino acid) (20Mangelsdorf D.J. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 841-850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2805) Google Scholar), is also present at the C terminus of the ligand-binding domain of BmHR3A (LYKELF; aa residues 474–479 in Ref. 11Eystathioy T. Swevers L. Iatrou K. Mech. Dev. 2001; 103: 107-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). To determine whether similar activation functions exist in BmHR3A, mutant BmHR3A receptors encompassing a deletion of the isoform-specific region at the N terminus and/or a deletion of the 22 C-terminal amino acids that included the short F domain and the LYKELF motif at the end of the ligand-binding domain (BmHR3AΔN, BmHR3AΔC and BmHR3AΔN/C; Fig. 1 B) were tested in the transactivation assay for their capacity to stimulate transcription from the RORE-coupled promoter construct. Whereas the N terminus deletion mutant was capable of stimulating transcription of the reporter construct as efficiently as full-length BmHR3A (72.6 ± 1.1, n = 3), only very minor stimulation of transcription was observed for the C-terminal deletion mutants (stimulation by 3.1 ± 0.8 (n = 3) for BmHR3AΔC and 2.9 ± 1.1 (n = 3) for BmHR3AΔN/C). These results suggest that the activation functions of BmHR3A reside in its C terminus (AF-2) and that its N terminus is not involved in transcriptional activation in any significant manner. To deduce whether the BmE75 nuclear receptors interact as avidly as BmHR3A with the consensus RORE, we performed bandshift assays using the FTZ-F1 RORE element as probe together within vitro-transcribed/translated BmE75A and BmE75C. The results shown in Fig. 2 Ademonstrate that BmE75A and BmE75C specifically bind the RORE sequence. The amount of shifted complex in these experiments was less than that seen for BmHR3A, presumably because of the lower amount of protein produced by the in vitro transcription/translation mixtures (Fig. 2 A, lanes 2–7; compare with Fig. 2,lane 8 and Fig. 1 A, lanes 2–4). To investigate whether binding of BmE75 to the RORE can interfere with the binding of BmHR3A, a small amount of BmHR3A (1 μl of translation mixture) was incubated with a limiting concentration of RORE probe and increasing concentrations of BmE75C protein (1–10 μl of translation mixture). As shown in Fig. 2 B, the complex corresponding to BmHR3A was gradually displaced by the BmE75 complex at increasing doses, indicating that both proteins can compete with each other for binding the RORE motif (Fig. 2 B). However, weak supershifted activity could also be observed when high doses of BmE75 were added to BmHR3A (arrow in Fig. 2 B), suggesting the formation of ternary complexes. When higher amounts of BmHR3A translation mixtures (5 μl) were used in the gel retardation assay together with high amounts of BmE75 (5 μl), a new complex of slower mobility was indeed clearly observed, indicating th"

Alterations in gene expression underlying a particular developmental event can be investigated either by selecting individual genes or by global screening approaches that do not require preselection of the genes to be analyzed. In general, mRNA-based screens depend on differential expression techniques such as subtractive hybridization, cDNA microarrays or oligonucleotide chips. Although undoubtedly powerful, these techniques are not necessarily comprehensive in the context of gene expression at the protein level. Interpretation may be hindered by poor correlation between mRNA and protein abundance because of post-transcriptional control. In yeast, abundance of some proteins varies by as much as 20-fold at apparently equivalent mRNA concentrations (1Gygi S.P. Rochon Y. Franza B.R. Aebersold R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1720-1730Crossref PubMed Scopus (3193) Google Scholar). In mammalian systems, similarly imprecise correlation has been described for proteins in rat bladder (2Vizzard M.A., Wu, K.H. Jewett I.T. Brain Res. Dev. Brain Res. 2000; 119: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 3Awad M.M. Gruppuso P.A. Cell Growth & Differ. 2000; 11: 325-334PubMed Google Scholar) and human liver (4Anderson L. Seilhamer J. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 533-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (1073) Google Scholar). A further limitation of mRNA-based approaches is the inability to detect proteolytic processing or post-translational modifications that may determine protein activity. An alternative approach is direct screening of the protein profile, or proteome, of a sample using two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry (MS)1 to separate and identify proteins (5Pandey A. Mann M. Nature. 2000; 405: 837-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (1962) Google Scholar). Detection of post-translational modifications provides a further level of sensitivity, in terms of regulatory or signaling events. In recent years, technical advances in two-dimensional electrophoresis have increased the utility of this approach as applied to complex protein mixtures. In particular, immobilized pH gradient (IPG) strips provide increased reproducibility, resolution and sample loading capacity compared with synthetic carrier ampholyte approaches used previously (6Gorg A. Obermaier C. Boguth G. Harder A. Scheibe B. Wildgruber R. Weiss W. Electrophoresis. 2000; 21: 1037-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (1647) Google Scholar). A significant step forward in proteomics has also been the development of MS methodology for identification of separated proteins, or even the components of protein mixtures (5Pandey A. Mann M. Nature. 2000; 405: 837-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (1962) Google Scholar). In mouse embryogenesis the period from embryonic day (E) 8.5 to 10.5 encompasses a series of major developmental events. These include formation of the neural tube, the primordium of the central nervous system, which initiates at the cervical-hindbrain boundary at E8.5 and is completed at E10.5 following closure of the posterior neuropore. Other events during this interval include axial rotation, formation of differentiated somites, and extensive remodeling of the heart with onset of regular contractions. Although many studies have examined the expression and function of specific genes during this period of embryonic development, there have been only a few proteomic studies. Previously, [35S]methionine labeling was used to examine the pattern of protein synthesis in mouse embryos (7Wilkinson D.G. Bailes J.A. Champion J.E. McMahon A.P. Development. 1987; 99: 493-500PubMed Google Scholar, 8Murach K.-F. Frei M. Gerhäuser D. Illmensee K. J. Cell. Biochem. 1990; 44: 19-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 9Latham K.E. Beddington R.S.P. Solter D. Garrels J.I. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1993; 35: 140-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In one study (7Wilkinson D.G. Bailes J.A. Champion J.E. McMahon A.P. Development. 1987; 99: 493-500PubMed Google Scholar), 600–800 protein species were resolved by two-dimensional electrophoresis but only one spot differed in intensity at E8, 9, and 10. This spot was predicted to be a globin protein, based on similar migration by an erythrocyte protein, and differential expression of globins in a concomitant cDNA expression study. Murach et al., (8Murach K.-F. Frei M. Gerhäuser D. Illmensee K. J. Cell. Biochem. 1990; 44: 19-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) detected around 500 proteins on two-dimensional gels of dissected embryos at E7–9, and selected 54 spots or groups of spots for analysis. Among these, 11 spots differed in level in embryonic tissues at E7–9, although the identity of these proteins was not determined. A potential drawback of these studies (7Wilkinson D.G. Bailes J.A. Champion J.E. McMahon A.P. Development. 1987; 99: 493-500PubMed Google Scholar, 8Murach K.-F. Frei M. Gerhäuser D. Illmensee K. J. Cell.

Copp A.J. Cockroft D.L. Postimplantation Mammalian Embryos: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1990: 15-40Google Scholar). Labeling proteins under non-physiological conditions introduces the potential for spurious results that do not reflect in vivodevelopment. In view of the advances in two-dimensional electrophoresis technology over the past decade, a re-evaluation of the potential application of proteomic methodology to embryological systems seems timely and appropriate. In this study, we used IPG-based two-dimensional electrophoresis followed by silver staining and direct identification of proteins by MS, to monitor changes in the protein profile of mouse embryos over the period E8.5–10.5. CD1 mice (Charles River) were mated overnight and females checked for copulation plugs the following morning, designated E0.5. At E8.5, E9.5, or E10.5 mice were killed and the uterus explanted into Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Embryos were dissected free of extra-embryonic membranes, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, rinsed in distilled water, and immediately frozen on dry ice. Samples containing pools of four embryos at E8.5, two embryos at E9.5 or single embryos at E10.5, were stored at −70 °C. Initial analysis was based on comparison of three independent samples for each stage and a further two samples for each stage were used for confirmation of results (fifteen samples in total). Embryos were resuspended in 200 μl of lysis buffer containing 9.5m urea, 2% CHAPS, 0.8% pharmalyte pH 3–10, 1% dithiothreitol, with 1× protease inhibitor mixture and phosphatase inhibitor mixture (Sigma) and homogenized by sonication. Protein concentrations were determined as described (11Leung K.Y. Wait R. Welson S.Y. Yan J.X. Abraham D.J. Black C.M. Pearson J.D. Dunn M.J. Proteomics. 2001; 1: 787-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Analytical gel loadings, for sample comparison, were 100 μg. Preparative gel loadings, for protein identification, were 400 μg. For isoelectric focusing, samples were applied to pH 3–10, 18-cm non-linear IPG strips (Amersham Biosciences) and two-dimensional electrophoresis was performed, using 12% second dimension gels, as described (11Leung K.Y. Wait R. Welson S.Y. Yan J.X. Abraham D.J. Black C.M. Pearson J.D. Dunn M.J. Proteomics. 2001; 1: 787-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Analytical and preparative gels were silver stained and scanned as described (11Leung K.Y. Wait R. Welson S.Y. Yan J.X. Abraham D.J. Black C.M. Pearson J.D. Dunn M.J. Proteomics. 2001; 1: 787-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Protein patterns were analyzed using PDQUEST software (version 6.2, Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA). Qualitative and quantitative comparisons were made between replicate groups, comprising the three gels for each stage. Quantitation is based on the peak intensity and area of Gaussian-fitted spots, allowing more accurate quantitation than summation of pixel intensities. Any differential spots that were not present or absent in all three gels within a replicate group were excluded. To evaluate the potential for spurious differences that are not stage-specific, we also compared replicate groups in which gels were arbitrarily assigned to one of three groups, each containing one gel from each stage. No differences were detected between these groups, suggesting that the differentially represented spots are genuinely stage-specific. Differences that were identified in the initial nine gels were confirmed on a further two gels for each stage. In-gel digestion with trypsin and MALDI MS were performed as described (11Leung K.Y. Wait R. Welson S.Y. Yan J.X. Abraham D.J. Black C.M. Pearson J.D. Dunn M.J. Proteomics. 2001; 1: 787-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Samples were also analyzed by tandem electrospray mass spectromtery (ESI MS/MS). Spectra were recorded using a Q-Tof spectrometer (Micromass, Manchester, UK) interfaced to a Micromass CapLC capillary chromatograph. Samples were dissolved in 0.1% formic acid, and aliquots were injected onto a 300 μm × 15 mm Pepmap C18 column (LC Packings, Amsterdam, NL) and eluted with an acetonitrile/0.1% formic acid gradient. Capillary voltage was 3500 V and data-dependent MS/MS acquisitions were performed on precursors with charge states of 2, 3, or 4 over a survey mass range 540–1000. The collision gas was argon, and the collision voltage was 18–45 V depending on the precursor charge state and mass. Proteins were identified by correlation of uninterpreted spectra to entries in SwissProt and TREMBL using ProteinLynx Global Server (v 1.0, Micromass). Pools of embryos (six at E8.5, three at E9.5, and one at E10.5) were homogenized by sonication in 100 μl of dH2O. Protein content was assayed using the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay reagent (Pierce). Five micrograms of total protein lysate was resolved on SDS-PAGE, with Rainbow molecular weight markers (Amersham Biosciences), and transferred to Hybond-P (Amersham Biosciences). Blots were incubated with antibodies to calreticulin (1:1000), α-fetoprotein (AFP) (1:1000), GRP78 (1:500), or β-tubulin (1:500) (all primary antibodies from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). Proteins were detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (DAKO), followed by development with ECL+plus Western blotting Detection System (Amersham Biosciences). Blots were repeated at least three times for each protein. Total RNA was purified from pools of embryos at E8.5 and E10.5 using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen Life Technologies). First strand cDNA was generated using the Superscript First-Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen Life Technologies). One microliter of cDNA was subjected to PCR using gene-specific primers that were designed to cross introns such that any products from amplification of genomic DNA contamination in the sample would be distinguishable. Primer sequences were as follows: HPRT (5′-AAGGACCTCTCGAAGTGTTG; 5′-CCTTCTTACAGATACAATCTCA), α-fetoprotein (5′-GAACAAGCAGCCATGAAGTG; 5′-CCAGCAGACACTGATGTCTT), GRP78 (5′-TCATCGGACGCACTTGGAAT; 5′-TAGTGAGAACCATGGCAGAA), Zeta-Globin (5′-TGAGTGCACTCAACTCCAGC; 5′-ACACGCAGGATGTAGGCAT). Samples were amplified for 28 cycles (shown in preliminary tests to be in the linear range), and products were separated on agarose gels. Band intensity was determined using AlphaEase software (v4.0, Alpha Innotech Corporation) and normalized to the band intensity for HPRT. The experiment was repeated in triplicate, and the ratio of abundance at E10.5 compared with E8.5 was calculated. Despite the proliferation of proteomic studies, the embryo has been somewhat neglected in favor of samples, principally cell lines, in which availability of material is not a limiting factor. Here, we demonstrate the feasibility of functional proteome analysis in the mouse embryo and identify a number of proteins that are developmentally regulated during the period E8.5–10.5. At E8.5, CD1 embryos had 5–7 somites with closure of the neural tube having recently been initiated. Embryos at E9.5 had 17–19 somites, axial rotation was complete, and the neural tube was closed in the cranial region. At E10.5, embryos had 32–33 somites and had completed primary neural tube closure. In this study, two-dimensional electrophoresis resolved up to 1200 protein spots (Fig. 1), the majority of which are apparently conserved between stages. In previous two-dimensional electrophoresis-based studies of postimplantation mouse embryos, the identity of protein spots of interest was determined in a few cases by indirect methods, such as comigration with known protein samples, that require deduction of possible protein identity (7Wilkinson D.G. Bailes J.A. Champion J.E. McMahon A.P. Development. 1987; 99: 493-500PubMed Google Scholar, 12Copp A.J. Estibeiro J.P. Brook F.A. Downs K.M. Dev. Biol. 1992; 153: 312-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). This approach is not suitable for novel proteins and not readily applicable to high throughput analysis. Protein elution and chemical sequencing provides the opportunity to obtain peptide sequence but requires relatively large amounts of sample, a major drawback in analysis of embryonic systems. Therefore, we used MS to directly identify embryonic protein species separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis. In addition, we used Western blot analysis to confirm the expression profile of selected proteins identified by two-dimensional electrophoresis (Fig.2).Figure 2Stage-specific abundance of individual proteins on two-dimensional electrophoresis correlates with abundance as determined by Western blot. a, Western blot of calreticulin (the two-dimensional electrophoresis profile is shown in Fig. 4). b–d, representative two-dimensional electrophoresis profiles are shown with the corresponding Western blot beneath for β-tubulin (b), α-fetoprotein (c), and GRP78 (d). On Western blots, band sizes of approximately 55 kDa (a), 50 kDa (b), 76 kDa (upper band), and 74 kDa (c), and 72 kDa (d) were as expected. In each case the abundance on two-dimensional electrophoresis and Western blot closely matches. Hence, calreticulin (a) and β-tubulin (b) are equally abundant at each stage whereas the abundance of GRP78 (d) dramatically increases from E8.5–10.5. Similarly, four spots identified as α-fetoprotein (c) increase in abundance on two-dimensional electrophoresis from E8.5–10.5 (position of absent spots at E8.5 indicated by arrowheads) corresponding to the increase in intensity of the 74-kDa band on Western blot (arrow inc) that is not detected at E8.5.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Initially, 21 of the most abundant conserved spots, whose staining intensity did not change appreciably between E8.5 and E10.5, were selected for MS analysis. The identity of 18 of these spots was determined, with 16 corresponding to known proteins (TableI). Peptide sequence of the remaining two spots corresponds to known cDNA sequences for which the predicted proteins do not appear in protein databases. These spots provide a reference framework for comparison of the molecular weight and pI observed on gel migration and the theoretical values calculated from amino acid sequence. In most cases the theoretical and observed values were very similar (Table I). Calreticulin (spot 1) ran at a higher molecular weight than predicted, in agreement with Mouse Kidney and Human MRC-5 Fibroblast databases (accessible at biobase.dk/cgi-bin/celis). Western blot analysis of calreticulin (spot 1) and β-tubulin (spot 7) correlated with the observations made using two-dimensional electrophoresis, in that neither of these proteins altered in abundance at the stages examined (Fig. 2).Table IIdentities of abundant unvarying proteins represented on two-dimensional gels of CD1 mouse embryos at E8.5–10.5Spot no.Protein nameAccession numberObserved M r/pITheoretical M r/pI1Calreticulin precursor (Calregulin)P1421171.2 /4.2847.98 /4.32Translationally controlled transcript (21kDa)NP_03345557.9 /5.3119.46 /4.83Encoded by day 13 embryo liver cDNAQ9CY1350.8 /4.832.84 /4.9460s Acidic Ribosomal protein P0 (L10E)P1486937.4 /5.2934.20 /6.25Translation initiation factor 3, IF3gi ‖12833012‖56.4 /5.437.98 /5.56Heat Shock cognate 71kDa proteinP0810973.1 /5.4470.85 /5.47Tubulin Beta-5 chainP0521841.1 /5.4749.65 /4.88Malate dehydrogenase, cytoplasmicP1415239.6 /6.0536.33 /6.59T-complex protein 1, Alpha subunit BP1198366.2 /5.8960.45 /6.110Calcium-independent phospholipase A2NP_03147928.7 /6.4824.83 /6.311Guanine monophosphate synthase (human)NP_00386673.7 /6.976.72 /6.812Peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase AP1774217.8 /8.317.82 /8.313GTP-binding nuclear protein RAN (TC4)P2874627.6 /7.8524.41 /7.614Transcription factor BTF3Q6415220.9 /7.9321.54 /9.815Cofilin, non-muscle isoformP1876018.7 /8.7718.54 /8.516L-lactate dehydrogenase, MchainP0615139.6 /8.0936.50 /8.017Guanine nucleotide binding protein, β subunit-likeI4970035.2 /8.1135.02 /8.318Pyruvate kinase, M2 isozymeP5248064.8 /8.1357.89 /7.7Proteins were identified by MS.

Comparison of stage-specific groups of gels revealed a number of changes in the protein pattern at successive embryonic days (Fig. 3). At E10.5, a total of 79 spots were increased in intensity by 5-fold or more relative to E8.5. These spots could be broadly grouped into three developmental profiles (Fig.3). Some spots were up-regulated by E9.5 (profile A) while others were up-regulated at E10.5 compared with both earlier stages examined (profile C). The remainder showed intermediate intensity at E9.5 (profile B). A few spots were present at higher intensity at E10.5 than at E9.5 but not E8.5 (profile D), suggesting that these species were down-regulated between E8.5 and E9.5 and then dramatically up-regulated at E10.5. A further 22 spots decreased in intensity by 5-fold or more at E10.5 relative to E8.5 (Fig. 3). Among these, 10 showed a relative change of 10-fold or greater. At E9.5, these spots were either present at an intermediate intensity (profile E) or showed a similar degree of down-regulation as at E10.5 (profile F). Five of the spots in this group are located in a chain of increasing pI that includes spot 1, calreticulin (Fig. 4 a), which had previously been identified as one of the conserved spots, present at all stages (Table I). The five differentially expressed calreticulin spots are predicted to correspond to different phosphorylated forms, although the overall abundance of the calreticulin protein does not change significantly (Fig. 2 a). In support of this idea, calreticulin is known to be a substrate for protein kinase C, with at least six potential phosphorylation sites (13Rendon-Huerta E. Mendoza-Hernandez G. Robles-Flores M. Biochem. J. 1999; 344 (Pt 2): 469-475Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Calreticulin is one of several stress proteins that are differentially regulated at these stages (see below). Comparison of E10.5 and E8.5 protein profiles revealed 55 spots that were most dramatically up-regulated at E10.5, exhibiting increases in intensity of 10-fold or more (Fig. 3). Forty of these were located on preparative gels and isolated for MS analysis. Identities were obtained for 24 spots, corresponding to 14 different proteins (Table II). Among the up-regulated proteins, a number could be broadly classified into functionally related groups that may be associated with particular developmental events.Table IIIdentities of proteins that are upregulated during the developmental period E8.5–10.5Spot no.Protein nameAccession numberDev.

Open table in a new tab One of the most abundant up-regulated proteins was identified as zeta globin (Fig. 4 b, spot 42). The appearance of this embryonic globin correlates with the establishment, by E9.5, of an extensive embryonic and yolk sac circulation following heart looping and the onset of regular cardiac contractions. There is a corresponding dramatic increase in the number of erythrocytes by E9.5. At this stage the major site of hemopoiesis is the yolk sac (14Kovach J.S. Marks P.A. Russell E.S. Epler H. J. Mol. Biol. 1967; 25: 131-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), although intra-embryonic hemopoiesis begins at around E9.5 (15De Bruijn M.F.T.R. Speck N.A. Peeters M.C.E. Dzierzak E. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2465-2474Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). In this study the yolk sac was removed, suggesting that the globin detected on two-dimensional gels is principally derived from erythrocytes either in transit or generated within the embryonic vasculature. Interestingly, the detection of increased abundance of an embryonic globin reproduces a previous finding (7Wilkinson D.G. Bailes J.A. Champion J.E. McMahon A.P. Development. 1987; 99: 493-500PubMed Google Scholar), although in that study it was the only protein change detected between E8 and E10. AFP, the principal serum protein during embryogenesis, was also up-regulated at successive stages. In fact, 5 separate spots (numbers 28, 36, 37, 38, 40) were identified as AFP, 4 of which ran at slightly higher molecular weight than predicted (Table II). As AFP is a glycoprotein, these probably correspond to different post-translationally modified forms. In mice, AFP is initially synthesized in the yolk sac endoderm (16Dziadek M. J. Embryol. Exp. Morphol. 1978; 46: 135-146PubMed Google Scholar) and then in the liver with mRNA expression being detectable at E9.5 in the hepatic bud and endoderm of the midgut and hindgut (17Jones E.A. Clement-Jones M. James O.F.W. Wilson D.I. J. Anat. 2001; 198: 555-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Using two-dimensional electrophoresis we confirm that embryonic expression also increases at the protein level from E9.5 (Fig. 2 c). Similarly, on Western blots a band of ∼74 kDa is present at E9.5 and very abundant at E10.5, but is not detected at E8.5 (Fig. 2 c). However, at E8.5 a band of ∼76 kDa is detected by the anti-AFP antibody that is not present at either E9.5 or E10.5. The first eighteen amino acids of AFP constitute a putative signal peptide that equates to 2.01 kDa. We suggest, therefore, that the band detected at E8.5 corresponds to the full-length α-fetoprotein precursor polypeptide and that the band detected at E9.5 and E10.5 is the mature protein, following cleavage of the signal peptide. Presumably, the immature polypeptide is not detected at E9.5–10.5 owing to rapid post-translational cleavage. Therefore, Western blotting not only provided confirmation of the increased abundance of species detected by two-dimensional electrophoresis, but also indicated an additional level of stage-specific regulation suggesting that this is a useful complementary technique. Proteins with cytoskeletal function make up another class of differentially expressed proteins. α-Tubulin (spots 22, 23, 26, 33) is a major component of microtubules. Three of the spots ran at slightly higher molecular weight and pI than theoretically predicted, suggesting that they represent post-translationally modified forms, rather than degradation products. F-actin capping protein (spot 24) binds to the ends of actin filaments, preventing filament growth and facilitating regulation of localized actin assembly at the free ends (18Cooper J.A. Schafer D.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 97-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Up-regulation of vimentin (spot 21), a component of intermediate filaments, was also detected at E9.5 and E10.5. This correlates with previous immunofluorescence studies in which vimentin was first detected at late E8 in the mesoderm, and at E9 in the neural tube with significantly increased levels at E10 (19Jackson B.W. Grund C. Winter S. Franke W.W. Illmensee K. Differentiation. 1981; 20: 203-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 20Houle J. Fedoroff S. Brain Res. 1983; 285: 189-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Therefore, components of all three principal cytoskeletal systems, comprising the actin microfilament network, tubulin-containing microtubules and the intermediate filament network (21Herrmann H. Aebi U. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 79-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar), were up-regulated at E8.5–10.5. Together these data suggest that the processes occurring at this stage require significant synthesis and remodeling of cytoskeletal components. In addition to altered regulation of calreticulin (see previous), we detected up-regulation of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70; spots 34, 35), a closely related glucose-regulated protein, GRP78 (spot 29, Fig. 2), and APG-2 (spot 30), a member of the heat shock protein 110 family not previously reported in the embryo (Table II). In contrast, a heat shock cognate 70 related protein, HSC71, was an abundant species (spot 6), which did not vary in inte"

We explored the roles of the cyclin kinase inhibitors p21 and p27 in maintaining hepatocyte quiescence. p27 is expressed throughout the wild-type liver, but the related protein p21 was not detected. However, p21 was detected in livers of p27-deficient mice. Increased p21 protein levels did not result from an increase in p21 mRNA expression, indicating that p21 expression is regulated post-transcriptionally. p21 protein levels increased in cultured primary hepatocytes treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 and cycloheximide, indicating that p21 expression is regulated at the level of protein stability in liver cells. Although increased expression of cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) 4, Cdk2, and proliferating cell nuclear antigen was detected in p27-deficient livers, increased hepatocyte proliferation was detected only in livers of mice deficient for both p21 and p27. In p27-deficient livers, p21 was found in complexes with Cdk2 and CdK4 and can compensate for the absence of p27. Our data indicate that cyclin kinase inhibitor activity is important for maintaining hepatocyte quiescence in the adult liver.

Tyner A.L. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 951-961PubMed Google Scholar, 31Albrecht J.H. Meyer A.H. Hu M.Y. Hepatology. 1997; 25: 557-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 32Albrecht J.H.

However, a functional role for these cyclin kinase inhibitors in maintaining quiescence of the mature hepatocyte has not been demonstrated. We examined the expression and functions of p21 and p27 in quiescent hepatocytes in the adult rodent liver, and we detected aberrant hepatocyte proliferation in livers of mice deficient for both p21 and p27. Our data indicate that cyclin kinase inhibitors are required for maintaining hepatocyte quiescence even in the absence of mitogenic signals associated with liver injury and tissue loss. Wild-type, p21−/−, p27−/−, and p21/p27−/− male littermates at 8–10 weeks of age were generally used for all experiments except where noted under “Results.” Generation of p21−/− and p27−/− mice was described previously (11Brugarolas J.

To obtain mice deficient for both p21 and p27, p21−/− female and p27−/−male mice were crossed, resulting in offspring that were double heterozygotes, p21+/−/p27+/−. Subsequent intercross matings between double-heterozygous male and female mice produced offspring with the p21/p27−/− genotype. p21−/−/p27+/− male mice were crossed with p21−/−/p27+/− female mice to generate additional p21/p27−/− offspring. Genomic DNA isolation and PCR were used to confirm the genotypes of the mice. Mice were fed a commercial diet and water ad libitum and were sacrificed in the morning. The left lobe of the liver was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and paraffin-embedded for sectioning. Other portions of liver were frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at −70 °C for preparation of protein lysates and total RNA. Mice were injected intraperitoneally with 50 μg of 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd; Sigma) per g of body weight 2 h before sacrifice for hepatocyte proliferation studies. In general, 50 μg of total liver protein was separated on 12 or 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). All membranes were stained with Ponceau S to confirm equal loading and transfer of protein. Immunoblotting was performed using the following primary antibodies obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA): p21 (SC-397), p27 (SC-528), Cdk2 (SC-163), Cdk4 (SC-260), Cdk6 (SC-177), cyclin A (SC-596), cyclin E (SC-481), and PCNA (SC-56). Other antibodies used included cyclin D1 (MS-210; NeoMarkers, Fremont, CA) and β-actin (A-5441; Sigma). Immunoreactive bands were detected using the SuperSignal substrate (Pierce). Immunoprecipitations were performed using the SeizeTMprimary immunoprecipitation kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 25 μg of anti-p21 antibody (PC55; Oncogene Research Products, San Diego, CA) or anti-p27 antibody (SC-528; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used for antibody coupling for each column. Rabbit IgG was used as a control. Primary hepatocytes from adult male and female mice (8–10 weeks old) were isolated by a two-step in situ collagenase perfusion procedure as described previously (33Hatano E. Bradham C.A. Stark A. Iimuro Y. Lemasters J.J. Brenner D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11814-11823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Cell viability was >90% as determined by trypan blue exclusion. After attachment, cells were maintained in hormonally defined Williams E medium (34Viollet B. Yaniv M. Pontoglio M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3662-3670Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). One day after plating, cells were treated with 20 μm MG132 (BIOMOL Research Laboratories, Plymouth Meeting, PA) and/or 0.5 μg/ml cycloheximide (Sigma). The vehicle Me2SO was added to the medium of untreated control cells. After 5.5 h, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, collected in a lysis buffer, incubated for 20 min with agitation at 4 °C, and centrifuged for 10 min to collect total cell lysates. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were prepared and cultured as described previously (35Tsutsui T. Hesabi B. Moons D.S. Pandolfi P.P. Hansel K.S. Koff A. Kiyokawa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7011-7019Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). MEFs were serum-starved for 72 h and then restimulated with 10% fetal bovine serum for 24 h. Total liver RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and cDNA was synthesized using 2 μg of total RNA with the SuperScript preamplification system (Invitrogen) as described previously (18Serfas M.S. Goufman E. Feuerman M.H. Gartel A.L. Tyner A.L. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 951-961PubMed Google Scholar). For amplification of cDNA, primers for mouse p21 (upstream primer, AGTGTGCCGTTGTCTCTTCG; downstream primer, ACACCAGAGTGCAAGACAGC; annealing temperature 62 °C, 30 cycles; product, 311 bp) were used. Expression of mouse S16 ribosomal protein was examined as an internal control as described previously (18Serfas M.S. Goufman E. Feuerman M.H. Gartel A.L. Tyner A.L. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 951-961PubMed Google Scholar). For each combination of primers, the kinetics of PCR amplification were studied, the number of cycles corresponding to plateau was determined, and PCR was performed within the exponential range. Amplified products were separated on a 2% agarose gel and visualized with ethidium bromide staining. Quantitation was performed using Kodak 1D image analysis software (Eastman Kodak). Liver sections were pretreated for antigen recovery and accessibility. For the p21 and p27 antibodies, slides were pretreated by a 5-min incubation in pepsin solution (AutoZyme; Vector, Burlingame, CA). For BrdUrd, the best signal was obtained after microwave heating. The PerkinElmer Life Sciences tyramide signal amplification kit was used to amplify antibody staining. Primary antibody sources and dilutions were anti-p21, PC55 (Oncogene Research Products), 1:150; p27, SC-528 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), 1:300; BrdUrd, 347583 (BD Biosciences), 1:100. Expression of p21 and p27 protein was examined in livers of wild-type, p21−/−, and p27−/− male mice. Total proteins were isolated from four or five individuals of each genotype and subjected to immunoblotting with antibodies against p21, p27, or β-actin. Although p27 protein expression was easily detected in the wild-type liver (Fig.1 A), no p21 protein could be detected, even after long exposures (Fig. 1 B). However, p21 protein was detected in liver lysates prepared from p27-deficient mice (Fig. 1 B). These data were confirmed using immunohistochemistry. p27 protein was detected in nuclei throughout the wild-type liver lobule and in bile duct epithelial cells, whereas no p21 expression was detected in wild-type liver samples (Fig.2). In the p27-deficient liver, p21 protein expression was detected in hepatocyte nuclei, with highest levels near the central veins (Fig. 2).Figure 2p27 and p21 protein expression and localization in the adult mouse liver. Tyramide-amplified indirect immunostaining was used to examine p27 and p21 expression in livers of adult male mice. Left panel, p27 positive hepatocyte nuclei were detected throughout the wild-type liver lobule and in bile duct epithelium. Middle panel, p21 protein was not detected in the wild-type liver. Right panel, p21 protein was detected in hepatocyte nuclei in p27−/− livers. P, portal vein; C, central vein. Scale bar, 50 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) p21 expression is frequently regulated at the transcriptional level (9Gartel A.L. Tyner A.L. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 246: 280-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar), so we examined levels of p21 mRNA expressed in the wild-type and p27-deficient livers used in the immunoblotting experiments above (Fig. 1 B) using semiquantitative reverse transcription-PCR. No increase in p21 mRNA levels was detected in RNA samples from the p27-deficient animals, compared with the wild-type animals. Expression of the mouse S16 ribosomal protein gene was examined as a control (Fig.1, C and D). The lack of a significant change in p21 mRNA levels suggests that increased p21 protein expression in the p27-deficient mouse liver is regulated at a post-transcriptional level. To examine possible mechanisms regulating p21 protein expression in the wild-type liver, primary hepatocytes from male and female mice were placed into culture and treated with MG132, an inhibitor of proteasome-dependent proteolysis. It has been shown that MG132 treatment leads to stabilization of p21 protein (36Sheaff R.J. Singer J.D. Swanger J. Smitherman M. Roberts J.M. Clurman B.E. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 403-410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar) but not to an increase in p21 mRNA levels (37Klibanov S.A. O'Hagan H.M. Ljungman M. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1867-1873Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An increase in p21 protein levels was detected after treatment of hepatocytes with MG132, suggesting that p21 protein levels are regulated by proteasome-mediated degradation in wild-type hepatocytes (Fig.3 A). To determine whether translation of p21 transcripts contributed to the increase in p21 protein levels detected after MG132 treatment, hepatocytes were cultured with MG132 and cycloheximide, an inhibitor of protein synthesis. Increased p21 protein was detected in the presence of MG132 and cycloheximide providing additional support that p21 is regulated at the level of protein stability in hepatocytes (Fig. 3, B andC). An increase in p21 expression has not been previously reported for p27−/− tissues or cells. We examined p21 protein levels in serum-starved and stimulated p27−/− MEFs (Fig.4 A). We could not detect increased p21 expression as observed in the liver, suggesting that increased p21 expression in the absence of p27 might be liver-specific. However, when we compared p21 protein levels in a variety of differentiated tissues from mature (8–19 weeks of age) wild-type and p27-deficient mice, we discovered higher levels of p21 protein in multiple tissues of p27-deficient mice (Fig. 4 B). Thus, increased accumulation of p21 may be important for cell cycle control in multiple tissues of the p27-deficient mouse. We compared baseline expression levels of a number of cell cycle regulatory proteins including Cdk2, Cdk4, Cdk6, cyclin A, cyclin D1, cyclin E, and PCNA in four mice of each genotype (wild-type, p21−/−, p27−/−, and p21/p27−/−) (Fig. 5). β-Actin expression levels were examined as a control for protein loading. Increased expression of cyclin A was detected in all animals deficient for either p21 or p27. Increases in Cdk2 and PCNA expression were also apparent in livers of p27−/− and p21/p27−/− mice. Increased expression of proliferation-associated proteins suggested that there might be an increase in hepatic proliferation in mice lacking p27. To determine whether the increase in proliferation-associated protein expression leads to increased cell proliferation in the normally quiescent liver, animals were injected with BrdUrd and then sacrificed after 2 h (Fig. 6). Significant numbers of BrdUrd-labeled hepatocytes were detected only in livers of mice deficient for both p21 and p27 (Fig. 6 A). Although rare proliferating cells could be detected in livers of untreated wild-type mice and mice deficient for either p21 or p27, the majority of these rare cells were not hepatocytes. The total number of BrdUrd-labeled cells was counted in 30 random fields in liver sections from each of the four genotypes (Fig.6 B). In p21/p27−/− untreated livers most fields contained two or three BrdUrd-labeled nuclei. In comparison, most fields were negative in the other three genotypes. Similar results were obtained in separate experiments in which untreated mice were injected with [3H]thymidine 1 h before sacrifice (data not shown). The few fields from p27−/− liver sections containing more than four labeled cells contained arteries and veins, and the majority of the labeled cells were not hepatocytes. The increase in the number of sporadically proliferating hepatocytes in the untreated livers of mice lacking both p21 and p27 suggests that the increase in p21 expression detected in the untreated p27−/− liver can compensate for the absence of p27 and inhibit sporadic proliferation. Expression of cyclins and Cdks was detected in the wild-type mouse liver (Fig. 4), but hepatocyte proliferation was detected only in the absence of both p21 and p27. We were unable to detect consistent increases in Cdk2 activity in the whole-tissue extracts from p21/p27-deficient livers, probably in part because the number of proliferating cells represented only a small fraction of the total cells (data not shown). In addition, evidence suggests that p21 and p27 are also positive regulators of cyclin/Cdk complexes, facilitating their assembly (reviewed in Refs. 3Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5107) Google Scholar and 4Sherr C.J. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3689-3695PubMed Google Scholar). We detected p27 in complexes with Cdk2 and Cdk4 in the livers of wild-type and p21-deficient animals using immunoprecipitation followed by immunoblotting (Fig. 7). In p27-deficient mice, a significant increase in p21 protein levels was detected, and p21 was found in complexes containing Cdk2 and Cdk4 in extracts from p27-deficient liver. Cyclin E was also detected associated with p21 in coimmunoprecipitation experiments (data not shown). Although p21 and p27 have been shown to play a positive role in the assembly of cyclin D-Cdk4 complexes, association of these CKIs with Cdk2 complexes is inhibitory and p21/p27-deficient MEFs have been shown to contain increased levels of Cdk2 activity (6Cheng M. Olivier P. Diehl J.A. Fero M. Roussel M.F. Roberts J.M. Sherr C.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1571-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that increased levels of p21 protein in the p27-deficient liver inhibit proliferation by inhibiting Cdk2. Adult hepatocytes are quiescent and rarely divide under normal conditions. We detected p27 in the nuclei of hepatocytes throughout the adult mouse liver. We determined that p27 expression in quiescent hepatocytes is at least partially responsible for the lack of hepatocyte replication, although disruption of the p27 gene alone did not lead to a significant increase in hepatocyte proliferation. This was because p27-deficient hepatocytes express the related CKI p21, which was undetectable in the wild-type liver. Many sporadically proliferating hepatocytes were detected in animals lacking both p21 and p27, indicating that at least one of these CKIs was required for the maintenance of mature hepatocyte quiescence. An increase in p21 was detected in multiple tissues of mature p27-deficient mice and may represent a general mechanism by which tissues maintain cell cycle control in the absence of p27. We detected p21 protein in Cdk2 and Cdk4 complexes in p27-deficient livers, where it can play an active role in the inhibition of cell cycle progression. A number of recent reports have emphasized the importance of regulation of p21 protein stability in growth control (38Oh H. Mammucari C. Nenci A. Cabodi S. Cohen S.N. Dotto G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Expression of p21 can be regulated by both ubiquitin-dependent and -independent proteasomal mediated degradation (36Sheaff R.J. Singer J.D. Swanger J. Smitherman M. Roberts J.M. Clurman B.E. Mol.

We determined that absence of p21 in wild-type liver may be attributed to proteasomal mediated degradation in liver cells, because p21 levels increased in hepatocytes treated with MG132 and cycloheximide. We examined several possible mechanisms that could contribute to changes in p21 protein turnover in the liver, including association of p21 with CCAAT/enhancer binding protein α, and AKT activity (data not shown). CCAAT/enhancer binding protein α can bind and regulate levels of p21 protein and is expressed at high levels in quiescent hepatocytes (45Timchenko N.A. Harris T.E. Wilde M. Bilyeu T.A. Burgess-Beusse B.L. Finegold M.J. Darlington G.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7353-7361Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, we were unable to detect differences in the expression of CCAAT/enhancer binding protein α or association of p21 with CCAAT/enhancer binding protein α between wild-type and p27−/− animals. Recent reports indicate that AKT activity may regulate p21 protein turnover (41Rossig L. Badorff C. Holzmann Y. Zeiher A.M. Dimmeler S. J. Biol.

Cooperation between CKIs has been demonstrated in various tissues. p27 and p57 have been shown to act together to control proliferation in lens fiber cells and placental trophoblasts (48Zhang P. Wong C. DePinho R.A. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3162-3167Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), whereas p21 and p57 play redundant functions in regulating differentiation of skeletal muscle and lung alveoli (49Zhang P. Wong C. Liu D. Finegold M. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 213-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). p19Ink4d and p27 cooperate to maintain quiescence of differentiated neurons (50Zindy F. Cunningham J.J. Sherr C.J. Jogal S. Smeyne R.J. Roussel M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13462Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Functional collaboration between p18Ink4C and either p27 or p21 has also been demonstrated in vivo (51Franklin D.S. Godfrey V.L. O'Brien D.A. Deng C. Xiong Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6147-6158Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). p21 has been reported to be important for maintaining hematopoietic stem cell quiescence (15Cheng T. Rodrigues N. Shen H. Yang Y. Dombkowski D. Sykes M. Scadden D.T. Science. 2000; 287: 1804-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar), although p27 is important for regulating hematopoietic progenitor cell proliferation (52Cheng T. Rodrigues N. Dombkowski D. Stier S. Scadden D.T. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 1235-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Here, we have shown that increased p21 expression can compensate for the lack of p27 to maintain quiescence of mature hepatocytes. Recently, p27-deficient hepatocytes were shown to more efficiently repopulate diseased mouse livers in transplantation studies, and it has been suggested that p27-deficient hepatocytes may prove to be beneficial for the treatment of human liver diseases (53Karnezis A.N. Dorokhov M. Grompe M. Zhu L. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 383-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 54Lee L.A. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 367-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Our findings indicate that p27 is important for preventing hepatocyte proliferation in the physiological environment of the uninjured liver and that p21 accumulates in its absence to assume its role. As attempts are made to generate cells useful for human hepatocyte transplantation, it will be important to recognize that either p27 or p21 should be expressed in hepatocytes to prevent aberrant proliferation after repopulation of diseased liver has occurred. Although rarely mutated in cancers, reduced expression of p27 has been correlated with poor survival among patients with breast, prostate, or colorectal carcinomas (reviewed in Refs. 27Philipp-Staheli J. Payne S.R. Kemp C.J. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 264: 148-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar and 28Slingerland J. Pagano M. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 183: 10-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). Decreased expression of p27 protein has also been associated with poor prognosis in hepatocellular carcinomas (55Hui A.M. Sun L. Kanai Y. Sakamoto M. Hirohashi S. Cancer Lett. 1998; 132: 67-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 56Ito Y. Matsuura N. Sakon M. Miyoshi E. Noda K. Takeda T. Umeshita K. Nagano H. Nakamori S.

In mouse liver, the natural compensatory induction of p21 expression in the liver is sufficient to keep aberrant proliferation in check. Modulation of p27 and/or p21 expression in hepatocytes could have potential therapeutic benefits for patients with liver cancer. We are indebted to Dr. Andrei Gartel for helpful discussions and Dr. Tyler Jacks for providing the p21-deficient mice."

The rate-limiting CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase is an amphitropic protein that exists in an inactive soluble form that requires translocation to membranes to become active, and this translocation event is believed to be the main form of regulation of this enzyme (9Cornell R.B.

The PE methylation pathway for the synthesis of PC is found in mammalian hepatocytes and yeast cells (13Cui Z. Vance J.E. Chen M.H. Voelker D.E. Vance D.E. J. Biol.

Genetics. 1989; 122: 317-330Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and PC is synthesized through this route by three successive methylations of the ethanolamine head group of PE (encoded by the CHO2 and OPI3genes in yeast). The CHO2 gene product methylates PE once, and the OPI3 gene product transfers the final two methyl groups to form PC (15Kodaki T. Yamashita S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15428-15435Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16McGraw P. Henry S.A. Genetics. 1989; 122: 317-330Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The contribution of the two pathways to PC synthesis in yeast is dependent on exogenous choline concentration with higher levels of choline favoring synthesis through the CDP-choline pathway (8McMaster C.R. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14776-14783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As the major component of biological membranes, PC would be predicted to participate in organellar and cellular biogenesis as well as the formation of vesicles for the transport of proteins and lipids within cells. A role for PC in vesicle transport has been established through work on the Saccharomyces cerevisiae PC/phosphatidylinositol transfer protein Sec14p. Loss of function of Sec14p results in cell death through cessation of Golgi-derived vesicle transport. Inactivation of PC synthesis through the CDP-choline pathway completely rescues cell growth and vesicle transport defects in the absence of functional Sec14p (17Cleves A.E. McGee T.P. Whitters E.A.

When bound to PC, Sec14p is an effective inhibitor of Pct1p (Fig. 1) and is believed to act as a PC sensor with Sec14p-mediated adjustment of the rate of PC synthesis and turnover as a requirement for the regulation of vesicle transport from the Golgi (21Skinner H.B. McGee T.P. McMaster C.R. Fry M.R. Bell R.M. Bankaitis V.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 112-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In this study, we constructed a yeast strain with an inactivated PE methylation pathway and a conditional temperature-sensitive allele ofPCT1. This allowed us to simultaneously inactivate both routes for PC either by removing choline from the medium or by shifting cells to the nonpermissive temperature for function of thePCT1 temperature-sensitive allele, to address the role of decreased PC synthesis on cell growth and viability. Yeast and E. coli media were from Difco. Restriction enzymes and T4 DNA ligase were purchased from New England Biolabs. AdvanTaq polymerase was a product of CLONTECH. Oligonucleotides were from Invitrogen. Lipids were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids. [14C]Choline, [3H]methionine, and phosphorus-32 were purchased from American Radiolabeled Chemicals. S. cerevisiae strain D319–8A (α leu2 his4 pct1 ts) (22Tsukagoshi Y. Nikawa J. Yamashita S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 169: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) was mated with strain CTY410 (a his3–200 leu2–9 cho2::LEU2), and diploids were sporulated. Haploid strains that grew poorly on medium lacking choline at 25 °C and did not grow at 37 °C were isolated and mated twice with strain W303-1A (a ura3–1 his3–11 leu2–3,112 trp1–1 ade2–1) to make strain CMY134 (αura his3 leu2 trp1 ade2 cho2::LEU2 pct1 ts). CMY134 was used to assess the role of PC in cell growth and viability. Strain CTY471 (α ura his3 leu2 trp1 ade2 pct1::URA3) was used for expression of wild type and tagged derivatives of PCT1 for metabolic and biochemical analyses. Yeasts were grown on rich yeast peptone dextrose (YPD) medium, or synthetic dextrose minimal medium supplemented as required for plasmid maintenance (23Kaiser C. Michaelis S. Mitchell A. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994Google Scholar). The PCT1 gene was amplified from isolated W303-1A yeast genomic DNA using AdvanTaq polymerase and TA cloned into pCR2.1 Topo (Invitrogen). ThePCT1 gene was subsequently subcloned into the yeast low copy CEN/ARS shuttle vector pRS413 (24Christianson T.W. Sikorski R.S. Dante M. Shero J.H. Hieter P. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 110: 112-119Crossref Scopus (1418) Google Scholar) to create plasmid pMM4. The pMM4 plasmid was digested with BlpI to liberate the majority of the PCT1 open reading frame, and the linearized plasmid DNA was transformed into W303-1A yeast to allow for gap repair of thePCT1 open reading frame from yeast genomic DNA to create plasmid pMM5. Plasmid pMM5 was isolated from yeast, amplified in DH5αE. coli, and sequenced in its entirety to ensure polymerase and gap repair fidelity. An AgeI site was inserted at the most 3′-end of thePCT1 open reading frame using the Morph site-directed mutagenesis kit (5 Prime → 3 Prime, Inc., Boulder, CO), and a 3-fold repeat of the HA epitope tag was inserted into this site by PCR amplification of the 3-fold hemagglutinin epitope repeat from plasmid pGTEP. The wild type and HA-tagged versions of PCT1 were subcloned into pRS413. The potential temperature-sensitive allele of PCT1(pct1 ts) was recovered from yeast strain CMY134 genomic DNA by digesting pRS413 containing the PCT1 gene with Blp1 to liberate the majority of the PCT1 open reading frame from the plasmid. The linearized plasmid DNA was transformed into CMY134 yeast to allow for gap repair of the PCT1 open reading frame from yeast genomic DNA into the plasmid. To ensure that the temperature-sensitive mutation was carried within thePCT1 gene isolated from strain CMY134, the PCT1gene was recovered from strain CMY134 by gap repair and resubcloned into pRS413. Total yeast cell membranes were prepared from midlog phase yeast as described (25Williams J.G. McMaster C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13482-13487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). CTY471 (pct1::URA) containing pMM7 (Myc-taggedPCT1 under control of the inducible GAL1promoter) or pESC-TRP vector control was grown in selective medium with galactose to log phase. Cultures were fixed by adding formaldehyde to the medium to a final concentration of 3.7% and incubating at room temperature for 2 h. Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and the cell wall was digested with zymolyase. The resulting spheroplasts were mounted on slides treated with polylysine and incubated successively in ice-cold methanol, ice-cold acetone and then rehydrated with room temperature phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were incubated in blocking buffer (phosphate buffered saline plus 3% bovine serum albumin) in a humid chamber for 30 min. Mouse anti-c-Myc antibody (1:250 dilution in blocking buffer) was added in a humid chamber for 1 h. Slides were washed three times with blocking buffer and incubated with goat anti-mouse Texas Red-conjugated antibody (1:5000 dilution in blocking buffer) for 1 h in a humid chamber in the dark and then washed three times with blocking buffer. DAPI (1 μg/ml) was added to slides for 1 min, slides were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, and 20 μl of 90% glycerol, 10% phosphate-buffered saline was placed on the slides. Coverslips were added and sealed. Fluorescence microscopy was performed using a Zeiss axiophot microscope. Texas Red was visualized with Zeiss filter number 15, which excites at 546/560 nm and emits at 590 nm, whereas the UV filter was used to visualize DAPI-stained cells. For actin staining, cultures were incubated with 0.66 μmAlexaFluor 568 Phalloidin (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h in the dark. Cells were washed four times with phosphate-buffered saline and mounted on polylysine-treated slides in 90% glycerol, 10% phosphate-buffered saline and visualized with Zeiss filter number 15. Logarithmic phase yeast cells were grown in synthetic minimal medium and labeled with [14C]choline or [3H]methionine for 1 h, or phosphorus-32 for 18 h. Lipids were extracted, lipid and lipid precursors were separated by thin layer chromatography, and radiolabel was quantitated by scintillation counting as described (25Williams J.G. McMaster C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13482-13487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). All of the epitope-tagged versions of Pct1p used in this study were capable of reconstituting PC synthesis to levels similar to those observed for nontagged Pct1p as assessed by the rate of [14C]choline labeling of PC in a yeast strain containing a genetically inactivatedPCT1 gene (CTY471 α ura his3 leu2 trp1 ade2 pct1::URA3). Exponential cultures of cells growing at 25 °C in supplemented minimal medium lacking methionine and cysteine were concentrated and resuspended in fresh medium and incubated at 25 °C for 1 h. Cells were then pulse-labeled for 10 min with [35S]methionine/cysteine (Expre35S35S protein labeling mix; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and then chased with the subsequent addition of methionine and cysteine at a final concentration of 0.5% each at 37 °C. Aliquots of cells (A 600 = 3) were taken at different times and transferred to tubes containing ice-cold 10 mm NaF/NaN3 in 1 m sorbitol. Cells were disrupted, CPY was immunoprecipitated as described (28Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), proteins were resolved using 8% SDS-PAGE, and the gel was exposed to x-ray film for subsequent development. To measure invertase secretion, yeast cells were grown to midlog phase at 25 °C in rich (YPD) medium containing the normal level of 2% glucose and centrifuged at 750 rpm for 5 min to pellet the cells. Pellets were washed twice with 5 ml of sterile water and resuspended in 5 ml of YPD containing only 0.1% glucose to induce invertase. These cultures were grown at 37 °C for 2 h, and invertase secretion was measured using the method described (26Goldstein A. Lampen J.O. Methods Enzymol. 1975; 42: 504-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 27Cleves A.E. Novick P.J. Bankaitis V.A. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2939-2950Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The invertase secretion index of each sample was determined by dividing external invertase (−) by total invertase (+). Protein was measured by the method of Lowry et al. (28Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Lipid phosphorus was determined using the method of Ames and Dubin (29Ames B.N. Dubin D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 769-775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and diacylglycerol mass was determined by the method of Priess et al. (30Preiss J. Loomis C.R. Bishop W.R. Stein R. Niedel J.E. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8597-8600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Yeast strain CMY134 (cho2::LEU2 pct1 ts) or wild type yeast were maintained at 25 °C and while in log phase were labeled with [14C]choline for 1 h at 25 or 37 °C. As has been recently observed (31Dowd S.R. Bier M.E. Patton-Vogt J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3756-3763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), there was an increase in PC synthesis upon shifting the wild type yeast to 37 °C; however, PC labeling was reduced to less than 5% of wild type in thepct1 ts-containing cells. Analysis of the metabolites of the CDP-choline pathway indicated a large rise in the labeling of phosphocholine accompanied the decrease in PC synthesis consistent with a block at the Pct1p step (Fig. 2). To ensure that the temperature sensitivity observed at the Pct1p step was due to a mutation within the PCT1 structural gene within strain CMY134 (and not a regulator of Pct1p), the PCT1 gene was recovered from CMY134 genomic DNA by allele rescue through transformation of CMY134 yeast with a BlpI digest of a CEN/ARS plasmid containing the wild type PCT1 gene. This digestion liberates the majority of the PCT1 open reading frame, and the linearized plasmid DNA was isolated by gel electrophoresis and transformed into CMY134 yeast to allow for allele rescue of the PCT1 open reading frame from yeast genomic DNA. The PCT1 gene recovered from CMY134 by allele rescue was subcloned into the low copy yeast vector pRS413 and transformed into the yeast CTY471 (pct1::URA3). The CTY471 strain is wild type except for genetic inactivation of its chromosomalPCT1 gene, and thus the ability of the PCT1allele recovered from strain CMY134 can be compared with the wild type gene by monitoring the ability to synthesize PC from radiolabeled choline. The CTY471 yeasts were maintained at 25 °C, and the synthesis of PC from radiolabeled choline was monitored in CTY471 containing the PCT1 gene recovered from the genome of CMY134 or the wild type PCT1 gene for 1 h after a shift in the growth temperature from 25 to 37 °C. Upon shifting the yeast to 37 °C, the rate of PC synthesis in the cells containing thePCT1 allele rescued from the CMY134 genome was less than 2% that of the same yeast strain containing the wild type gene (Fig.3 A). This proves that it is the PCT1 gene in strain CMY134 that contains a mutation that renders the Pct1p enzyme activity temperature-sensitive. To ensure that the cho2::LEU2 gene inactivation was preventing PC synthesis through the PE methylation pathway, CMY134 yeasts were labeled with [3H]methionine for 1 h and compared with wild type yeast. As expected, PC synthesis was reduced to 5% of wild type upon inactivation of theCHO2 gene (Fig. 3 B). The levels of yeast phospholipids were determined by labeling CMY134 cells, inoculated at the same stage of early log phase growth, to steady state with 32 phosphorous for 18 h. The relative levels of total phospholipid were drastically different depending on the growth temperature, the presence or absence of choline, and the presence or absence of a functional PCT1 gene (Fig.4 A). Cells grown at 25 °C in the presence of choline contained similar amounts of total phospholipid regardless of the presence of the plasmid-derivedPCT1 gene due to the pct1 ts allele being functional at this temperature. The removal of choline from the medium at 25 °C reduced total recoverable phospholipid to approximately one-third that of cells grown in the presence of choline, indicating that cell growth, phospholipid synthesis, or the amount of phospholipid per cell was dramatically reduced. At the pct1 tsnonpermissive temperature of 37 °C, cells containing plasmid-derivedPCT1 contained 40% of the level of phospholipid as the same strain grown at 25 °C, once again implying cell growth, phospholipid synthesis, or the amount of phospholipid per cell was dramatically reduced. The removal of choline at 37 °C reduced phospholipid levels in the PCT1-containing yeast a further 4-fold. Cells grown at 37 °C without a functional PCT1gene resulted in the recovery of barely detectable levels of lipid phosphorus, implying that there were very few viable cells. Identical dpm from each of the strains from which phosphorus-32-labeled phospholipid was efficiently recovered were separated by two-dimensional thin layer chromatography to determine the relative levels of each phospholipid class. In each case, 40–45% of phospholipid was composed of PC when choline was present in the medium; however, upon the removal of choline, there was a total loss of PC (Fig. 4, B and C). Upon the removal of choline, the bulk of the phospholipid mass of PC was by in large replaced by two phospholipids, with PE increasing from 19–22% total phospholipid to 30–35% and phosphatidylserine increasing from 12–15 to 28–32%. Increases in the proportion of other phospholipids were observed in the absence of PC, with phosphatidylglycerol increasing slightly from 7–10 to 12–15% and phosphatidylinositol increasing from 5–10 to 15–18%. The glycerol backbone and fatty acyl chains required for the synthesis of PC through the CDP-choline pathway are obtained from diacylglycerol. We measured the mass of diacylglycerol in cells that could no longer consume this lipid due to inactivation of the CDP-choline pathway through choline deprivation, growth at the nonpermissive temperature for the pct1 ts allele, or both. At 2 h, there was very little change in the level of diacylglycerol mass under any of the growth conditions; however, after 18 h, the proportion of diacylglycerol compared with total phospholipid increased 3–4-fold at 37 °C but only when PC could not be made (due to choline deprivation and/or growth at the nonpermissive temperature for thepct1 ts allele) (Fig.5). This increase in diacylglycerol mass was not observed when PC synthesis was prevented at 25 °C. CMY134 (cho2::LEU2 pct1 ts) yeasts carrying the wild type yeast PCT1 gene on a low copy plasmid or empty vector were grown at 25 °C in the presence of choline to early log phase and then grown with or without choline at either 25 or 37 °C, and the cell growth rate was monitored (Fig.6 A). In the presence of choline, the cells containing the vector control ceased growth within 5 h, whereas the cells containing the PCT1 plasmid continued to grow through to early stationary phase at a rate similar to cells grown at 25 °C (the permissive temperature for thepct1 ts allele). Cells grown without choline did not continue to grow at either 25 or 37 °C with a more pronounced cessation of cell growth for cells grown at 37 °C regardless of the presence or absence of a functional Pct1p. The cessation of cell growth in the absence of choline was similar to that observed for cells grown in the presence of choline but without a functional Pct1p when grown at the nonpermissive temperature for the pct1 tsallele. We then tested whether cell growth inhibition in cells unable to synthesize PC was due to growth cessation or resulted in a loss of cell viability. Equivalent numbers of cells from CMY134 yeast containing thePCT1 gene or empty vector were serial diluted 8 or 23 h after with or without choline and/or growth at either 25 or 37 °C and then tested for growth on solid medium at 25 °C that was replete with choline. Cells maintained viability up to ∼8 h, regardless of the choline content or growth temperature. However, at longer time points, cells that were unable to synthesize PC through the CDP-choline pathway due to genetic inactivation of the pct1 tsallele or choline deprivation resulted in a dramatic loss of cell viability but only for cells grown at 37 °C (Fig. 6 B). Cells grown at 25 °C remained viable upon the removal of choline from the medium, although their PC mass was dramatically reduced and their growth rates had dropped to levels almost as low as those observed for cells grown at 37 °C. Microscopic visualization of the above cells after 23 h under the indicated growth conditions resulted in the observation that the cells that were compromised for their ability to synthesize PC tended to contain a much larger proportion of small to medium size buds compared with cells that could readily synthesize PC (Fig.7). In addition, the cells that were grown at 37 °C that were unable to restore growth upon return to the permissive temperature contained fewer cells, and those that were visible appeared to possess abnormal internal membranes. Staining these cells with DAPI or phalloidin did not reveal any gross differences in the localization of chromosomal DNA or cortical actin, respectively, when compared with cells that were able to restore cell growth upon return to choline-replete medium at the permissive growth temperature (data not shown). The appearance of what appear to be odd membrane configurations in the cells unable to synthesize PC, with the end result being cell death, implied that there might be alterations in cellular membrane transport. PC synthesis through the CDP-choline pathway is intimately associated with the regulation of vesicle transport through the action of Sec14p. Sec14p is a PC/phosphatidylinositol transfer protein whose essential cell growth and Golgi-derived vesicle transport defects can be rescued if the CDP-choline pathway for PC synthesis is inactivated (17Cleves A.E.

Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 273-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been observed that the PC-bound form of Sec14p inhibits the CDP-choline pathway by inhibiting Pct1p activity, although the precise mechanism for this inhibition has yet to be established (21Skinner H.B. McGee T.P. McMaster C.R. Fry M.R. Bell R.M. Bankaitis V.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 112-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). It is currently hypothesized that Sec14p acts as a sensor for the rate of PC synthesis through the CDP-choline pathway with increasing PC synthesis resulting in increased PC bound Sec14p and a titrating down of the rate of PC synthesis through Sec14p inhibition of Pct1p (32Xie Z. Fang M. Bankaitis V.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1117-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 33Henneberry A.L. Lagace T.A. Ridgway N.D. McMaster C.R. Mol. Biol.

Nature. 1997; 387: 101-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The decreased PC synthesis results in less PC-bound Sec14p and thereby relieves the inhibition of PC synthesis (Fig. 1). Alterations in the rate of PC synthesis and turnover are believed to be major mechanisms regulating Sec14p-dependent Golgi-derived vesicle transport. Our observation that the inhibition of PC synthesis resulted in rapid cell growth cessation and that this was coupled to the appearance of odd membranous structures in cells destined to die implied that decreased PC synthesis might alter membrane transport from the sites of PC synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi t"

Consequently, abnormality of the Pit-1 gene results in combined pituitary hormone deficiency (CPHD). In this study, we analyzed the function of Pit-1 with a mutation (proline to leucine at codon 24) in the transactivation domain, P24L, which has a normal POU domain important for binding to DNA, because this mutation had been reported in a patient with CPHD. We found that codon 24 proline in the transactivation domain as well as the POU domain of Pit-1 was crucial to recruit coactivator CREB-binding protein (CBP) in the cultured cells. P24L completely lost the responsiveness to cAMP to stimulate the expression of the Pit-1-targeted genes. Furthermore, CBP and Pit-1, but not P24L, markedly enhanced the expression of the Pit-1-targeted gene to cAMP, and adenovirus E1a that binds to CBP and abrogates its function blocked the induction by cAMP of Pit-1-stimulated gene transcription in the pituitary-derived GH3 cells. These results suggest that CBP and proline at codon 24 in the transactivation domain of Pit-1 are important for the cAMP-induced activation of Pit-1-targeted genes. However, P24L maintained basal transcriptional activity, suggesting that CBP is unlikely to be an essential coactivator for Pit-1.

It is involved in the development of the three pituitary cell types, somatotrophs, lactotrophs, and thyrotrophs, as well as the gene expression of growth hormone (GH), 1The abbreviations used are: GH, growth hormone; GHRH-R, growth hormone-releasing hormone receptor; TSH β, thyrotropin β subunit; CPHD, combined pituitary hormone deficiency; CBP, CREB-binding protein; CREB, cAMP-response element-binding protein; CMV, cytomegalovirus; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EGFP, epidermal growth factor protein; HA, hemagglutinin; RSV, Rous sarcoma virus; CPT, chlorophenylthio. prolactin (PRL), GH-releasing hormone receptor (GHRH-R), thyrotropin β subunit (TSH β), and Pit-1 itself by binding to the specific DNA elements of these genes (3Dolle P.

Therefore, abnormalities of the Pit-1 gene result in GH, PRL, and TSH deficiencies. To date, at least 16 different mutations of the human Pit-1gene related to combined pituitary hormone deficiency (CPHD) have been reported (11–24). Most mutations are seen in the POU domain of Pit-1, which is important for its ability to dimerize and bind to DNA (25Sock E. Enderich J. Rosenfeld M.G. Wegner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17512-17518Google Scholar). However, two mutations located in the transactivation domain have also been reported in patients with CPHD. One is a C to T mutation in codon 14 of the Pit-1 gene, resulting in an amino acid change from proline (P) to leucine (L) (P14L) (19Fofanova O.V. Takamura N. Kinoshita E. Yoshimoto M. Tsuji Y. Peterkova V.A. Evgrafov O.V. Dedov I.I. Goncharov N.P. Yamashita S. Am. J. Med. 1998; 77: 360-365Google Scholar) and the other is a Cys to Thr mutation in codon 24 leading to a corresponding change from Pro to Leu (P24L) (20Ohta K. Nobukuni Y. Mitsubuchi H. Fujimoto S. Matsuo N. Inagaki H. Endo F. Matsuda I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 851-855Google Scholar). Because the patients with these mutations were both heterozygous for the mutation, it is believed that P14L and P24L may dominantly inhibit the transcriptional activity of the wild type Pit-1 (21Tatsumi K. Amino N. Growth Horm. IGF Res. 1999; 9: 18-23Google Scholar, 22Parks J.S. Abdul-Latif H. Kinoshita E. Meacham L.R. Pfaffle R.W. Brown M.R. Horm. Res. 1993; 40: 54-61Google Scholar, 23Pfaffle R. Kim C. Otten B. Wit J.M. Eiholzer U. Heimann G. Parks J. Horm. Res. 1996; 45: 25-28Google Scholar). However, the precise mechanism causing CPHD in patients with these mutations has not been clarified. In the study presented here, we showed that P14L exerts its transcriptional effect to a similar extent to the wild type. This suggests that P14L may not be responsible for CPHD. On the other hand, P24L showed reduced transcriptional activity and could be a cause of CPHD. In addition, P24L could not recruit its coactivator, CREB-binding protein (CBP) into the complex containing Pit-1 in the cultured cells. Furthermore, although P24L did not lose its transcriptional activity completely, it did not respond to stimulation by cAMP. Although it remains possible that non-CBP proteins are responsible for this phenomenon, CBP as well as Pit-1 appears to be involved in cAMP-mediated enhancement of the gene expression via Pit-1- binding DNA elements. Fetal calf serum and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium were obtained from Invitrogen (Tokyo, Japan). COS7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% (v/v) calf serum. All culture medium contained penicillin G (100 units/ml) and kanamycin (100 μg/ml). Human Pit-1 cDNA was subcloned into an expression vector (pcDNA3.1), which was named pcDNA3.1-wild type-Pit-1. The mutant forms of Pit-1 (P14L, P24L, and E250X) expression vectors were constructed with a site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase was used to react 50 ng of template DNA (pcDNA3.1-wild type-Pit-1) with mutant sense primer (5′-GATACCTTTATACTTCTGAATTCTG-3′) and mutant antisense primer (5′-CAGAATTCAGAAGTATAAAGGTATC-3′) for P14L, with mutant sense primer (5′-CTGCAACTCTGCTTCTGATAATGC-3′) and mutant antisense primer (5′-GCATTATCAGAAGCAGAGTTGCAG-3′) for P24L, and with mutant sense primer (5′-GGATGGCTGAATAACTGAATCTGG-3′) and mutant antisense primer (5′-CCAGATTCAGTTATTCAGCCATCC-3′) for E250X. This reaction involved 30 s of denaturation at 95 °C and 15 cycles consisting of 30 s of denaturation at 95 °C, 1 min of annealing at 55 °C, and 5 min of extension at 68 °C. After digestion of the nonmutated parental DNA template with DpnI, the mutant forms of Pit-1 expression vectors (named pcDNA3.1-P14L, pcDNA3.1-P24L, and pcDNA3.1-E250X) were successfully transformed. The correct sequence was confirmed by DNA sequencing. E250X is a previously reported mutant form of Pit-1 that has completely lost its transcriptional activity because of the defect in the binding activity to DNA (16Irie Y. Tatsumi K. Ogawa M. Kamijo T. Preeyasombat C. Suprasongsin C. Amino N. Endocr. J. 1995; 42: 351-354Google Scholar). The 1.8-kb rat GH and 0.6-kb ratPRL 5′-flanking regions were inserted upstream of the luciferase reporter gene and these plasmids were named GH-Luc and PRL-Luc, respectively. cDNAs for wild type Pit-1, P14L, P24L, the transactivation domain containing the codons from the first to the 128th, and the POU domain containing the codons from the 129th to the terminal codon of the wild type Pit-1 were inserted in-frame into theXhoI-KpnI sites in the multiple cloning site of pEGFPC3 (Clontech Laboratories, Inc. Palo Alto, CA) and named wild type pPit-1-EGFP, pP14L-EGFP, pP24L-EGFP, pTRANS-EGFP, and pPOU-EGFP, respectively. Wild type Pit-1, P14L, and P24L cDNA were inserted in-frame into BglII-KpnI sites in the multiple cloning site of the pFLAG-CMVTM-6a expression vector (Sigma) and these plasmids were named wild type pPit-1-FLAG, pP14L-FLAG, and pP24L-FLAG, respectively. DNA fragments encoding the transactivation domain and the POU domain were inserted in-frame into the BglII-KpnI sites in the multiple cloning site of the pFLAG-CMVTM-6a expression vector to produce pTRANS-FLAG and pPOU-FLAG, respectively. Expression vectors for adenovirus E1a, which binds with CBP and abrogates its function (pcDNA3.1-E1a), and the mutant form of E1a, which cannot bind with CBP (pcDNA3.1-Δ-E1a), were constructed by inserting DNA fragments of E1a and Δ2–36 E1a to pcDNA.3.1, respectively. In all the transient expression experiments using luciferase assay, plasmid was transfected to cells in 35-mm dishes, unless otherwise indicated, using LipofectAce (Invitrogen). First, 2 μg of GH-Luc or PRL-Luc were transfected into COS7 cells with 0.3 μg of pcDNA3.1, pcDNA3.1-wild type-Pit-1, pcDNA3.1-P14L, pcDNA3.1-P24L, or pcDNA3.1-E250X to evaluate the transcriptional activity of P14L and P24L. To clarify whether P14L and P24L have a dominant negative effect, 0.3 μg of pcDNA3.1-wild type-Pit-1, pcDNA3.1-P14L, or pcDNA3.1-P24L were transfected with 0.3 μg of pcDNA3.1-wild type-Pit-1 and 2 μg of PRL-Luc. In the experiment for dose dependent activation of PRL-Luc by Pit-1, varying amounts (0–0.3 μg) of wild type Pit-1 or mutant forms of Pit-1 (P14L and P24L) were used. To compare the function of P24L to activate Pit-1-targeted genes in response to cAMP with that of wild type Pit-1, 2 μg of PRL-Luc or 1P-Luc, which contains seven Pit-1-responsive elements derived from a Pit-1-binding DNA element, 1P, of the rat PRL gene, was transfected into the COS7 cells with 0.3 μg of empty expression vector (pcDNA3.1), pcDNA3.1-wild type-Pit-1, or pcDNA3.1-P24L. Twenty-four hours after transfection, 1.0 mm CPT-cAMP was added to the medium of the transfected cells. To assess the effect of exogenous CBP on Pit-1-targeted gene expression, 2 μg of 1P-Luc with or without 0.5 μg of CBP expression vector was transfected into the COS7 cells with 20 ng of empty expression vector (pcDNA3.1), pcDNA3.1-wild type-Pit-1, or pcDNA3.1-P24L. We used a minimal dose of Pit-1 expression vectors to assess the effect of CBP more clearly. Twenty-four hours after transfection, 1.0 mm CPT-cAMP was added to the medium of the transfected cells. To clarify the effect of endogenous CBP on the Pit-1-targeted gene expression, 2 μg of 1P-Luc was transfected with 1 μg of pcDNA3.1, pcDNA3.1-E1a, or pcDNA3.1-Δ-E1a into the GH3 cells in 35-mm dishes. Twenty-four hours after transfection, 1.0 mm CPT-cAMP was added to the medium of the transfected cells. In all the experiments, 20 ng of pRL-CMV containing the cDNA encoding Renilla luciferase (Promega, Tokyo, Japan) was co-transfected in each transfection to normalize the luciferase activity. In each of the experiments, cells were harvested 48 h after transfection, and luciferase activities were measured with a Turner design luminometer TD-20/20 using the dual luciferase assay system (Promega). Values are expressed as multiples of induction relative to the basic luciferase activity when only an empty expression vector was co-transfected and they represent the mean ± S.E. of at least three determinations. Three μg of pcDNA3.1-wild type-Pit-1, pcDNA3.1-P14L, or pcDNA3.1-P24L were introduced into COS7 cells in 100-mm dishes using LipofectAce with or without 3 μg of pcDNA3.1-wild type-Pit-1. An empty expression vector (pcDNA3.1) was also co-transfected to fix the total amount of these plasmids at 6 μg. Forty-eight hours after transfection, proteins were extracted from the cells and immunoprecipitated with anti-Pit-1 polyclonal antibody, Pit-1 (X-7) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). These samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and anti-Pit-1 antibody was used for Western blotting. As a negative control, 6 μg of pcDNA3.1 alone was transfected and analyzed. One μg of pEGFPC3, pPit-1-EGFP, pP14L-EGFP, pP24L-EGFP, pTRANS-EGFP, or pPOU-EGFP was introduced into COS7 cells in 35-mm dishes with the aid of LipofectAce. Forty-eight hours after transfection, fluorescence images were examined. Ten μg of pcDNA3.1-wild type-Pit-1 or pcDNA3.1-P24L were introduced into COS7 cells in 100-mm dishes with 20 μg of PRL-Luc and 10 μg of RSV-HA-CBP (hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged CBP expression vector). Forty-eight hours after transfection, proteins were extracted from the cells, and divided into two equal parts, one part for immunoprecipitation with anti-HA antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and the other part for immunoprecipitation with anti-Pit-1 antibody. These samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and anti-Pit-1 antibody was used for Western blotting. Furthermore, whether the transactivation domain alone or the POU domain alone can recruit CBP was examined. Ten μg of PRL-Luc and 5 μg of RSV-HA-CBP were introduced into COS7 cells in 100-mm dishes with 5 μg of wild type pPit-1-FLAG, pP14L-FLAG, pP24L-FLAG, pTRANS-FLAG, or pPOU-FLAG using LipofectAce. In the experiment to assess whether P24L blocks the interaction of wild type Pit-1 with CBP, 10 μg of PRL-Luc and 5 μg of RSV-HA-CBP were introduced into COS7 cells in 100-mm dishes with 5 μg of wild type pPit-1-FLAG, 5 μg of pP24L-FLAG, 5 μg of pPit-1-FLAG + 5 μg of pP24L-FLAG, or 10 μg of pPit-1-FLAG. pFLAG-CMVTM-6a was used to fix the total amounts of plasmids transfected. In both experiments, proteins were extracted from the cells 48 h after transfection and each sample was divided into two equal parts, one for immunoprecipitation with anti-HA antibody and the other for immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma). These samples were then resolved by SDS-PAGE and anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody was used for Western blotting. Expression vectors for fusion protein of Pit-1 or Pit-1 domains with the GAL4 DNA binding domain, pGAL4-Pit-1, pGAL4-TRANS, pGAL4-POU, and pGAL4-P24L were constructed by inserting wild type Pit-1, the transactivation domain of wild type Pit-1, the POU domain of wild type Pit-1, and P24L cDNA in-frame into BamHI-XbaI sites in the multiple cloning site of the pCMV-BD vector (Stratagene), respectively. Expression vectors for the fusion protein of CBP with the NF-κB transactivation domain, pAD-CBP, pAD-CBP-(1–319), pAD-CBP-(320–420), pAD-CBP-(421–1457), pAD-CBP-(1458–1891), and pAD-CBP-(1892–2441), were constructed by inserting cDNAs coding full-length CBP, CBP-(1–319), CBP-(320–420), CBP-(421–1457), CBP-(1458–1891), and CBP-(1892–2441) in-frame into BamHI-HindIII sites in the multiple cloning site of the pCMV-AD vector (Stratagene), respectively. Two μg of reporter plasmid, pFR-Luc (Stratagene), which contains GAL4-responsive elements and 1 μg of pGAL4-Pit-1 were transfected into the COS7 cells in 35-mm dishes with 1 μg of pCMV-AD, pAD-CBP, pAD-CBP-(1–319), pAD-CBP-(320–420), pAD-CBP-(421–1457), pAD-CBP-(1458–1891), or pAD-CBP-(1892–2441). Furthermore, 2 μg of pFR-Luc and 1 μg of pAD-CBP were transfected into the COS7 cells in 35-mm dishes with 1 μg of pGAL4-TRANS, pGAL4-POU, or pGAL4-P24L. In all the experiments, 20 ng of pRL-CMV was co-transfected to normalize the luciferase activity. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection and values are expressed as multiples of induction relative to the basic luciferase activity when pFR-Luc was transfected with pGAL4-Pit-1 and pCMV-AD. Transcriptional activity of P14L and P24L for the expression of GH and PRL genes was investigated in COS7 cells (Pit-1 deficient). P24L activated GH-Luc containing the 1.8-kb rat GH 5′-flanking region and PRL-Luc containing the 0.6-kb rat PRL 5′-flanking region up to only 69 and 56%, respectively, of activation by wild type Pit-1. On the other hand, P14L activated GH-Luc and PRL-Luc up to a similar level to wild type Pit-1 (Fig. 1, A andB). Furthermore, whereas P14L showed a similar dose-dependent enhancement of its power as a transcription factor to the wild type Pit-1, the dose-dependent enhancement of that of P24L was obviously weak (Fig. 1 C). However, whereas one mutant form of Pit-1, E250X, which cannot bind to DNA, completely lost its transcriptional activity (16Irie Y. Tatsumi K. Ogawa M. Kamijo T. Preeyasombat C. Suprasongsin C. Amino N. Endocr. J. 1995; 42: 351-354Google Scholar), P24L did not completely lose it (Fig. 1, A–C). Because both of the probands with P14L or P24L were found to be heterozygous for these mutations (19Fofanova O.V. Takamura N. Kinoshita E. Yoshimoto M. Tsuji Y. Peterkova V.A. Evgrafov O.V. Dedov I.I. Goncharov N.P. Yamashita S. Am. J. Med. 1998; 77: 360-365Google Scholar,20Ohta K. Nobukuni Y. Mitsubuchi H. Fujimoto S. Matsuo N. Inagaki H. Endo F. Matsuda I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 851-855Google Scholar), it has been hypothesized that P14L and P24L might inhibit the activity of the wild type Pit-1 (21Tatsumi K. Amino N. Growth Horm. IGF Res. 1999; 9: 18-23Google Scholar, 22Parks J.S. Abdul-Latif H. Kinoshita E. Meacham L.R. Pfaffle R.W. Brown M.R. Horm. Res. 1993; 40: 54-61Google Scholar, 23Pfaffle R. Kim C. Otten B. Wit J.M. Eiholzer U. Heimann G. Parks J. Horm. Res. 1996; 45: 25-28Google Scholar). To test the ability of these mutants to interfere with the transactivation of Pit-1-targeted gene expression by wild type Pit-1, the expression vector for P14L or P24L was transfected into COS7 cells together with the PRL-Luc and wild type Pit-1 expression vector. Whereas P14L, like wild type Pit-1, enhanced the transcriptional effect of the wild type in an additive manner, the effect of P24L on the activity of the wild type Pit-1 was very weak. However, neither P14L nor P24L dominantly inhibited the activity of the wild type Pit-1 (Fig. 2 A). To rule out the possibility that the differences in expression levels of wild type Pit-1 and mutant forms of Pit-1 (P14L and P24L) could explain the minor effect of P24L on basal transcription rates and the absence of a dominant negative effect of P14L and P24L on wild type Pit-1, we examined protein levels of wild type Pit-1 and mutant forms of Pit-1 using Western blot analysis. The Pit-1 protein levels were similar to each other whether 3 μg of wild type Pit-1, P14L, or P24L expression vector was transfected (Fig. 2 B, lanes 1–3). Furthermore, the levels of Pit-1 protein were similar to each other whether 3 μg of wild type Pit-1, P14L, or P24L expression vector was co-transfected with 3 μg of wild type Pit-1 expression vector (Fig.2 B, lanes 4–6). These results suggested that the reduced activity of P24L and the absence of a dominant negative effect of P14L and P24L were not explained by the difference in the levels of wild type and mutant forms of Pit-1 protein. Chimera constructs of GFP with wild type Pit-1, P14L, P24L, the transactivation domain alone, or the POU domain alone of the wild type Pit-1 (pPit-1-EGFP, pP14L-EGFP, pP24L-EGFP, pTRANS-EGFP, and pPOU-EGFP) were produced. These constructs were transiently transfected into COS7 cells, and the fluorescence image of the expressed fusion proteins were analyzed. Cells transfected with only the GFP expression vector were also analyzed as a control. In the control cells, GFP was distributed homogeneously in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus (Fig. 3 A). On the other hand, nuclear accumulation of wild type-Pit-1-GFP, P14L-GFP, and P24L-GFP was observed in all the cells analyzed (Fig. 3,B–D). Furthermore, nuclear accumulation of POU-GFP was observed in all the cells analyzed (Fig. 3 F). On the other hand, TRANS-GFP was distributed homogeneously in both the cytoplasm and nucleus (Fig. 3 E), suggesting that the POU domain but not the transactivation domain is involved in nuclear localization. A basic cluster RKRKRR is present in the POU homodomain, one of the subdomains of the POU domain. Because the basic cluster RKRKRR, which is highly conserved in POU proteins, has been identified as NLS in Tst-1/Oct6, a member of POU protein family (25Sock E. Enderich J. Rosenfeld M.G. Wegner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17512-17518Google Scholar), it appears to work as NLS in Pit-1 as well as in Tst-1/Oct6. Because P24L showed normal nuclear translocation and contained normal POU domain that is important for dimerization and DNA binding (26Jacobson E.M. Li P. Leon-del-Rio A. Rosenfeld M.G. Aggarwal A.K. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 198-212Google Scholar), we assumed that some transcriptional cofactors may be related with the reduced activity of P24L. Because CBP is involved in the activities of many transcription factors including Pit-1 (28Xu L. Lavinsky R.M. Dasen J.S. Flynn S.E. Mclerney E.M. Mullen T.M. Heinzel T. Szeto D. Korzus E.

Science. 1997; 275: 523-527Google Scholar), we investigated whether the impaired function of P24L is linked to the inability to recruit CBP. The whole cell extract prepared from COS7 cells, which had been transfected with the expression vector for wild type Pit-1 or P24L in addition to the expression vector for HA-tagged CBP (RSV-HA-CBP) and PRL-Luc, was immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody. Whether or not CBP is present in the complex containing wild type Pit-1 or P24L was analyzed by Western blotting with anti-Pit-1 antibody (Fig.4 A, lanes 1 and2). Although wild type Pit-1 was co-immunoprecipitated with CBP, P24L was not co-immunoprecipitated with CBP, suggesting that the ability to recruit CBP was decreased by the substitution of Leu for Pro at the 24th amino acid of Pit-1. Furthermore, whether or not the transactivation domain alone or the POU domain alone could recruit CBP was tested. The whole cell extract prepared from COS7 cells, which had been transfected with RSV-HA-CBP and PRL-Luc in addition to the FLAG-tagged expression vectors, pPit-1-FLAG, pP14L-FLAG, pP24L-FLAG, pTRANS-FLAG, or pPOU-FLAG, was divided into two equal parts. One part was used for immunoprecipitation with anti-HA antibody and the other for immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibody and both were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 4 B). pPit-1-FLAG, pP14L-FLAG, pP24L-FLAG, pTRANS-FLAG, or pPOU-FLAG appeared to be equally transfected (Fig. 4B, lanes 6–10; immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody and Western blotted with anti-FLAG antibody). However, neither P24L, the transactivation domain, nor the POU domain were detected in the complex containing CBP (Fig.4 B, lanes 1–5; immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody and Western blotted with anti-FLAG antibody). Therefore, the transactivation domain, especially proline at codon 24 of Pit-1 seemed to be important to make a complex containing CBP in the cultured cells (Fig. 4 B, lanes 3 and 8). Furthermore, in contrast to the result of a previous study (28Xu L. Lavinsky R.M. Dasen J.S. Flynn S.E. Mclerney E.M. Mullen T.M. Heinzel T. Szeto D. Korzus E. Kurosawa R. Aggarwal A.K. Rose D.W. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1998; 395: 301-306Google Scholar), the POU domain was not able to recruit CBP (Fig. 4 B, lanes 5 and10). It was surprising because a previous report (28Xu L. Lavinsky R.M. Dasen J.S. Flynn S.E. Mclerney E.M. Mullen T.M. Heinzel T. Szeto D. Korzus E. Kurosawa R. Aggarwal A.K. Rose D.W. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1998; 395: 301-306Google Scholar) suggested that the POU domain was sufficient to make a complex with the CBP fragment, although the binding activity appeared to be weak. Our result suggested that the transactivation domain alone or the POU domain alone are insufficient to make a high affinity complex that contains CBP in vivo cell culture. In addition, whether or not P24L blocks the interaction of wild type Pit-1 with CBP was also examined (Fig. 4 C). The whole cell extract prepared from COS7 cells, which had been transfected with RSV-HA-CBP and PRL-Luc in addition to expression vectors for FLAG-tagged wild type Pit-1, FLAG-tagged P24L, or both of them, was divided into two equal parts. One part was used for immunoprecipitation with anti-HA antibody and the other for immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibody and both were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-FLAG antibody (Fig.4 C). Although P24L could not make a complex containing CBP in the cultured cells, it did not block the interaction of wild type Pit-1 with CBP (Fig. 4 C, lanes 2 and3, immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody and Western blotted with anti-FLAG antibody). It is possible that loss of the nuclear localization is responsible for the disturbed interaction of the transactivation domain and CBP in the co-immunoprecipitation experiment. Therefore, we performed mammalian two-hybrid assays. When pGAL4-Pit-1-producing fusion protein of the GAL4 DNA binding domain with Pit-1 and the pAD-CBP coding NF-κB activation domain and CBP were co-transfected into the COS7 cells, the pFR-Luc that contains the GAL4-binding elements was activated (Fig.5). However, when pAD-CBP was co-transfected with pGAL4-P24L, pGAL4-TRANS producing a fusion protein of GAL4 and the transactivation domain, pGAL4-POU producing a fusion protein of GAL4 and the POU domain, pFR-Luc was not activated (Fig. 5). This result indicated that the transactivation domain alone could not interact with CBP, and was in accordance with the result from immunoprecipitation. On the other hand, pAD-CBP- (1–319), pAD-CBP-(320–420), pAD-CBP-(421–1457), pAD-CBP-(1458–1891), or pAD-CBP-(1892–2441) were co-transfected with pGAL4-Pit-1 and pFR-Luc to identify domains in CBP that interact with Pit-1. In accordance with the previous reports using the glutathione S-transferase pull-down assay (27Lill N.L. Grossman S.R. Ginsberg D. DeCaprio J. Livingston D.M. Nature. 1997; 387: 823-827Google Scholar, 34Cohen L.E. Hahimoto Y. Zanger K. Wondisford F. Radovick S. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 1123-1128Google Scholar, 35Zanger K. Cohen L.E. Hashimoto K. Radovick S. Wondisford F.E. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 268-275Google Scholar), the regions containing the CH1 or CH3 domains seemed to be important for CBP to interact with Pit-1, because pAD-CBP-(320–420) and pAD-CBP-(1458–1891) could activate pFR-Luc (Fig. 5). CBP has been reported to be involved in cAMP-regulated gene expression via Pit-1-binding DNA elements (28Xu L. Lavinsky R.M. Dasen J.S. Flynn S.E. Mclerney E.M. Mullen T.M. Heinzel T. Szeto D. Korzus E. Kurosawa R. Aggarwal A.K. Rose D.W. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1998; 395: 301-306Google Scholar, 34Cohen L.E. Hahimoto Y. Zanger K. Wondisford F. Radovick S. J. Clin.

Therefore, we examined whether wild type Pit-1 and the mutant form (P24L) Pit-1 differ in their activation of the target genes after cAMP stimulation. Whereas cAMP stimulated the transcription of thePRL gene by wild type Pit-1, it did not affect the transcription by P24L (Fig.6 A). In addition, 1P-Luc containing seven Pit-1-responsive elements derived from a Pit-1 binding DNA element, 1P, of the rat PRL gene was also used because there were reports that the proximal region of the PRL gene contains a cAMP responsive element-like DNA element as well as Pit-1 binding sites (36Liang J. Kim K.E. Schoderbek W.E. Maurer R.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 885-892Google Scholar, 37Peers B. Monget P. Nalda M.A. Voz M.L. Berwaer M. Belayew A. Martial J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18127-18134Google Scholar). cAMP stimulated the transcription of 1P-Luc by wild type Pit-1, but it did not affect the transcription by P24L (Fig.6 B). These results suggest that for Pit-1 making a complex containing CBP is associated with the cAMP-mediated signal pathway that stimulates the expression of the targeted genes. Besides, co-expression study revealed that CBP and cAMP enhanced the gene transcription by wild type Pit-1, but did not enhance the transcription by P24L (Fig.7 A). Furthermore, in the pituitary-derived GH3 cells, co-expression study revealed that adenovirus E1a, which binds with CBP and abrogates its function, suppressed the basal and cAMP-induced expression of 1P-Luc, whereas Δ-E1a that cannot bind to CBP did not (Fig. 7 B).Figure 7CBP is a mediator in the cAMP signal transduction pathway to activate Pit-1-targeted gene transcription. A, 2 μg of 1P-Luc containing seven Pit-1-binding elements was transfected into the COS7 cells in 35-mm dishes with or without 0.5 μg of CBP expression vector, in addition to 20 ng of empty expression vector (pcDNA3.1), pcDNA3.1-wild type-Pit-1, or pcDNA3.1-P24L. A minimal dose of Pit-1 expression vector was used to assess the effect of CBP more clearly. Empty expression vectors were used to fix the total amount of plasmids transfected. Twenty-four hours after transfection, 1.0 mmCPT-cAMP was added to the medium of the transfected cells. CBP and cAMP enhanced the gene transcription by wild type Pit-1, but did not enhance the transcription by P24L. B, 2 μg of 1P-Luc with 1 μg of pcDNA3.1, pcDNA3.1-E1a, or pcDNA3.1-Δ-E1a was transfected into the GH3 cells in 35-mm dishes. Twenty-four hours after transfection, 1.0 mm CPT-cAMP was added to the medium of the transfected cells. Wild type E1a, which binds to CBP and abrogates its function, suppressed the basal and cAMP-induced expression of 1P-Luc, whereas Δ-E1a, which is unable to bind to CBP did not. Experiments were performed in triplicate and data show the mean ± S.E. stimulation of the reporter construct. Twenty ng of pRL-CMV was also co-transfected to normalize the luciferase activity.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) This is the first functional analysis of Pit-1 with mutations in the transactivation domain found in patients with CPHD (19Fofanova O.V. Takamura N. Kinoshita E. Yoshimoto M. Tsuji Y. Peterkova V.A. Evgrafov O.V. Dedov I.I. Goncharov N.P. Yamashita S. Am. J. Med. 1998; 77: 360-365Google Scholar, 20Ohta K. Nobukuni Y. Mitsubuchi H. Fujimoto S. Matsuo N. Inagaki H. Endo F. Matsuda I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 851-855Google Scholar). The case reported by Fofanova et al. (19Fofanova O.V. Takamura N. Kinoshita E. Yoshimoto M. Tsuji Y. Peterkova V.A. Evgrafov O.V. Dedov I.I. Goncharov N.P. Yamashita S. Am. J. Med. 1998; 77: 360-365Google Scholar) was a 3-year-old girl who showed total GH/PRL and partial TSH deficiency without mental retardation. All six exons of the Pit-1 gene and its promoter region were directly sequenced by the authors and it was found that the patient was heterozygous for a mutation at codon 14 of exon 1 (CCT to CTT) resulting in the substitution of Leu for Pro. However, her mother, her maternal aunt, and grandmother were phenotypically normal, although they had the same heterozygous mutation. The need to thoroughly assess genomic imprinting was emphasized by the authors. The patient presented by Ohta et al. (20Ohta K. Nobukuni Y. Mitsubuchi H. Fujimoto S. Matsuo N. Inagaki H. Endo F. Matsuda I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 851-855Google Scholar) was a 5-year-old boy of short stature without mental retardation. Both of the plasma GH and PRL levels were undetectable either before or after the provocative stimulation tests. The basal TSH level was also low. TRH caused a weak TSH response. DNA sequence of the Pit-1 gene showed that the patient had a heterozygous mutation at codon 24 in exon 1 (CCT to CTT) resulting in substitution of Leu for Pro. Neither phenotype nor genotype of the family was described. As mentioned above, because both of the patients had only one mutant allele, it had been predicted that P14L and P24L were likely to possess the dominant negative effect (21Tatsumi K. Amino N. Growth Horm. IGF Res. 1999; 9: 18-23Google Scholar, 22Parks J.S. Abdul-Latif H. Kinoshita E. Meacham L.R. Pfaffle R.W. Brown M.R. Horm. Res. 1993; 40: 54-61Google Scholar, 23Pfaffle R. Kim C. Otten B. Wit J.M. Eiholzer U. Heimann G. Parks J. Horm. Res. 1996; 45: 25-28Google Scholar). However, neither of these mutations is likely to show dominant negative activity judging from our data. Especially, P14L showed normal transcriptional activity and therefore P14L did not seem to be responsible for CPHD, although it remains possible that this mutant lead to CPHD through an unknown mechanism in vivo. On the other hand, P24L could be a cause of CPHD in view of a previous report of monoallelic expression of thePit-1 gene (38Okamoto N. Wada Y. Ida S. Koga R. Ozono K. Chiyo H. Hayashi A. Tatsumi K. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1994; 3: 1565-1568Google Scholar). It was possible that only the mutant allele was expressed in this patient through a genomic imprinting mechanism rather than some other genomic or nongenomic etiology. Because CBP is associated with so many different transcription factors, mutations in the gene encoding CBP cause developmental disorder (known as the Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome) comprised of multiple abnormalities, broad thumbs and halluces, mental retardation, growth retardation, developmental delay, microcephaly, and craniofacial abnormalities (39Rubinstein J.H. Am. J. Med. Genet. 1990; 6: 3-16Google Scholar,40Petrij F. Giles R.H. Dauwerse H.G. Saris J.J. Hennekam R.C. Masuno M. Tommerup N. von Ommen G.J. Goodman R.H. Peters D.J. Breuning M.H. Nature. 1995; 376: 348-351Google Scholar). Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome is believed to be a haploinsufficient disorder (41Goodman R.H. Smolik S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1553-1577Crossref Google Scholar) and homozygous pathological mutation of CBP is lethal (42Oike Y. Takakura N. Hara A. Kaname T. Akizuki M. Yamaguchi Y. Yasue H. Araki K. Yamamura K. Suda T. Blood. 1999; 93: 2771-2779Google Scholar). On the other hand, CBP appears to be haplosufficient for GH, PRL, and TSH gene expression, because there have been no reports of Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome with deficiencies of these hormones (43Olson D.P. Koenig R.J. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1997; 82: 3264-3266Google Scholar). However, it is possible that if only the mutant form of Pit-1, which cannot recruit CBP, is expressed, not only the expression of the Pit-1-targeted genes, but also the development of somatotrophs, lactotrophs, and thyrotrophs might be impaired. Previously, we showed that Pit-1-binding DNA elements mediate the transcriptional response to cAMP through a mechanism that does not require inducible phosphorylation of Pit-1 (44Okimura Y. Howard P.W. Maurer R.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1559-1565Google Scholar). Although major phosphorylation sites of Pit-1 are serine 115 and threonine 220 (45Kapiloff M.S. Farkash Y. Wegner M. Rosenfeld M.G. Science. 1991; 253: 786-789Google Scholar), the mutations of those amino acids did not affect the transcriptional function in response to cAMP (44Okimura Y. Howard P.W. Maurer R.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1559-1565Google Scholar). This finding suggested the cAMP effects on the Pit-1- dependent gene expression might involve other proteins that associate with Pit-1 (44Okimura Y. Howard P.W. Maurer R.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1559-1565Google Scholar). Because the present study demonstrated that mutation of Pro at codon 24 of Pit-1 completely disrupted the transcriptional response to cAMP, and that adenovirus E1a that binds to CBP and abrogates its function blocked the stimulatory effect of cAMP on Pit-1-dependent gene transcription in the pituitary-derived GH3 cells, we speculated that the inability of the mutant form of Pit-1 (P24L) to recruit CBP is involved in the phenomenon (Fig. 8). However, how CBP is associated with the cAMP-mediated activation of Pit-1-targeted genes still remains to be clarified (28Xu L. Lavinsky R.M. Dasen J.S. Flynn S.E. Mclerney E.M. Mullen T.M. Heinzel T. Szeto D. Korzus E. Kurosawa R. Aggarwal A.K. Rose D.W. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1998; 395: 301-306Google Scholar, 35Zanger K. Cohen L.E. Hashimoto K. Radovick S. Wondisford F.E. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 268-275Google Scholar, 41Goodman R.H. Smolik S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1553-1577Crossref Google Scholar). It was very interesting that the basal activity of P24L as a transcription factor was not disrupted completely. This suggests that other coactivators for Pit-1 that function independently of CBP may exist. This functional analysis of the naturally occurring mutation in the transactivation domain of Pit-1 provided an interesting insight into the mechanism by which Pit-1 stimulates gene expression. However, the structure and function of the transactivation domain of Pit-1 remains to be clarified, although those of the POU domain have been extensively studied using NMR, crystallographic methods, and mutational analysis (26Jacobson E.M. Li P. Leon-del-Rio A. Rosenfeld M.G. Aggarwal A.K. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 198-212Google Scholar, 46Liang J. Moye-Rowley S. Maurer R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25520-25525Google Scholar, 47Andersen B. Rosenfeld R.G. Endocr. Rev. 2001; 22: 2-35Google Scholar). In conclusion, it was shown first that the transactivation domain, especially Pro at codon 24 of Pit-1 is important to recruit CBP in the cultured cells. Second, CBP is a mediator in the cAMP signal transduction pathway to activate Pit-1-targeted gene transcription. And third, CBP does not appear to be an essential coactivator for Pit-1 to maintain basal transcription, suggesting that some other unknown coactivators functioning independently of CBP may exist.

In summary, the formation of one equivalent of riboflavin requires one equivalent of compound1 and two equivalents of compound 3. The biosynthesis of riboflavin in Archaea has not been studied in detail. An in vivo study with Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum using [U-13C2]acetate and [1-13C1]pyruvate as tracers indicated that the xylene ring of the vitamin is assembled from two 4-carbon units (29Eisenreich W. Schwarzkopf B. Bacher A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9622-9631Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was also shown that compound 2 serves as an intermediate in the biosynthetic pathways of riboflavin as well as the 5-deazaflavin (compound 7) derivative, coenzyme F420 (30Reuke B. Korn S. Eisenreich W. Bacher A. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 4042-4049Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Only one enzyme from the archaeal riboflavin pathway, i.e.riboflavin synthase from M. thermoautotrophicum, has been reported (31Eberhardt S. Korn S. Lottspeich F. Bacher A. J.

The final PCR product (651 bp) was digested with EcoRI andBamHI and was ligated into the plasmid pNCO113 (18Richter G. Fischer M. Krieger C. Eberhardt S. Lüttgen H. Gerstenschläger I. Bacher A. J.

Open table in a new tab Sequencing was performed using the Sanger dideoxy chain termination method (39Sanger F. Nucklen N. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52771) Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA was isolated from cultures (5 ml) of XL1-Blue strains grown overnight in LB medium containing ampicillin (170 mg/l) using QIAprep spin columns from Qiagen. Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed by previously published procedures (40Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar). Non-denaturating polyacrylamide gels contained 200 mm phosphate, pH 7.2, 4% acrylamide, 0.11% bisacrylamide, and 0.1% tetramethylethylenediamine. Polymerization was started by the addition of 0.05% ammonium peroxodisulfate. Sequence determination was performed by the automated Edman method using a 471 A Protein Sequencer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Recombinant E. coli strains XL1-pNCO-MJ-MUT (wild type or mutated) were grown in LB medium containing ampicillin (170 mg liter−1) at 37 °C. After incubation for 18 h, the cells were harvested by centrifugation (Sorvall GS3 rotor, 5,000 rpm, 15 min, 4 °C). They were washed twice with 0.9% NaCl and frozen at −20 °C. Frozen cell mass (5 g) was thawed in 40 ml of 30 mmpotassium phosphate, pH 7.0. The suspension was cooled on ice and exposed to 60 pulses of a Branson-Sonifier B-12A (Branson Sonic Power Company, Danbury, CT) set to level 5. The suspension was centrifuged (Sorvall SS34 rotor, 15,000 rpm, 15 min, 4 °C). Ammonium sulfate was added to the supernatant to a final concentration of 2 m. After centrifugation (15,000 rpm, 15 min, 4 °C), the protein solution was placed on top of a phenyl-Sepharose SP column (40 ml,Amersham Biosciences), which had been equilibrated with 30 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, containing 1 mammonium sulfate. The column was developed with 30 mmpotassium phosphate, pH 7.0. Fractions were combined, concentrated by ultrafiltration (Ultrafree-15 centrifugal filter device, Millipore, Eschborn, Germany), and placed on top of a hydroxy apatite column (40 ml, Amersham Biosciences), which had been equilibrated with 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0. The column was developed with a linear gradient of 0–1 m potassium phosphate. Fractions were combined and concentrated by ultrafiltration. Assay mixtures contained 100 mm Tris hydrochloride, pH 7.7, 10 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm [U-13C5]ribulose 5-phosphate in 10% D2O. The reaction was initiated by the addition of protein and was monitored by 13C NMR spectroscopy at 37 °C. Assay mixtures contained 100 mmTris hydrochloride, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm ribose 5-phosphate, 100 μg of 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine synthase of E. coli, and 5 units of pentose phosphate isomerase in a total volume of 200 μl. The mixtures were incubated for 5 min at 37 °C to generate ribulose 5-phosphate. A mixture (200 μl) containing 0.75 mmfreshly prepared 5-amino-6-ribitylamino-2,4(1H,3H)-pyrimidinedione and protein was added. The solution was incubated at 37 °C, and absorbance was monitored at 410 nm. An absorbance coefficient of 12,100m−1 cm−1 at 410 nm for 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine was used for calculation. Experiments were performed as described elsewhere (41Mann M. Wilm M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 219-224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were performed with an analytical ultracentrifuge Optima XL-I from Beckman Instruments equipped with absorbance optics. Aluminum double sector cells equipped with quartz windows were used throughout. Protein concentration was monitored photometrically at 280 nm. Protein samples were dialyzed against 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0. The partial specific volume was estimated from the amino acid composition, affording a value of 0.732 ml g −1 (42Laue T.M. Shah B.D. Ridgeway T.M. Pelletier S.L. Harding S.E. Rowe A.J. Horton J.C. Analytical Ultracentrifugation in Biochemistry and Polymer Science.

A hypothetical protein specified by the open reading frame MJ0055 of M. jannaschii shows similarity to 3,4-dihydroxy-2-butanone-4-phosphate synthase of E. coli. Because open reading frame MJ0055 contained numerous codons, which are poorly translated in E. coli, we designed a synthetic gene that was optimized for the codon usage of E. coli. Approximately 21% (49 of 228) of the codons were replaced, and 10 singular restriction sites spaced at intervals of 10–200 bp were introduced. The DNA sequence was assembled from 16 synthetic oligonucleotides by a sequence of eight PCR steps as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The synthetic gene was ligated into the plasmid pNCO113 where it was under the control of a T5 promoter andlac operator. The sequence of the synthetic gene was verified by DNA sequencing in both directions and has been deposited in the GenBankTM data base (accession number AF490554). It was transcribed efficiently in a recombinant E. coli strain, affording ∼30% of cellular protein. The recombinant protein obtained by heterologous expression of the synthetic gene was purified by the chromatographic procedures described “Experimental Procedures” and was obtained in apparently pure form as judged by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide electrophoresis (Fig. 2). The N-terminal sequence of the recombinant protein was verified by partial Edman degradation affording the sequence MNNVEKAIEALKKGE. A relative mass of 25,799 Da was observed by electrospray mass spectrometry in good agreement with the calculated mass of 25,796 Da. Sedimentation equilibrium centrifugation of the recombinant M. jannaschii protein afforded a molecular mass of 54 kDa, which indicates a homodimer structure in parallel with the homodimer structure of the E. coli enzyme that has been established by analytical ultracentrifugation and by x-ray crystallography (43Richter G.

The reaction catalyzed by the recombinant protein was observed by13C NMR spectrometry in real time using [U-13C5]ribulose 5-phosphate as substrate. The singlet at 170.9 ppm reflects the formate obtained by fragmentation of the substrate. The other four signals are complex multiplets because of 13C13C and 13C31P coupling. Specifically, the doublet of doublets at 25.7 ppm reflects the methyl group of the enzyme product 3,4-dihydroxy-2-butanone 4-phosphate, which is coupled to the position 2 carbonyl group with a coupling constant of 40.9 Hz and C-3 with a coupling constant of 13.1 Hz. The carbonyl group of 4 resonates at 211.7 ppm and appears as a pseudotriplet because of coupling to C-1 and C-3. The signal of C-3 is a complex multiplet reflecting13C13C coupling to C-2 and C-4 with coupling constants of 41 and 40 Hz, to C-1 with a coupling constant of 13.1 Hz, and to phosphorus with a coupling constant of 7.5 Hz. C-4 of the product also appears as a multiplet because of coupling to C-3 and to phosphorus. The 13C spectrum shown in Fig.3 A unequivocally identifies the enzyme product as 3,4-dihydroxy-2-butanone 4-phosphate.

The signals of C-3 and C-4 show13C31P coupling. The use of the13C-labeled substrate results in an ∼90-fold sensitivity enhancement for the detection of formate, which was crucial for the detection of residual catalytic activity in certain mutant proteins described below. The spectrum in Fig. 3 B was obtained in an enzyme experiment using a mixture of [U-13C5]ribulose 5-phosphate and unlabeled ribulose 5-phosphate proffered at a ratio of 1:25. The spectrum of the product represents a superposition of the spectra in Fig. 3, A and C. This is specifically demonstrated for C-3 in Fig. 4 by the help of spectral simulation, which accounts rigorously for all observed lines. The enzyme-catalyzed reaction involves breaking of the bonds connecting C-3 and C-5 to C-4 and the formation of a novel bond between C-3 and C-5 of the substrate. Intermolecular recombination of fragments from labeled and unlabeled substrate would be conducive to partially13C-labeled products, more specifically, to [1,2,3-13C3]compound 4 and [4-13C1]compound 4 as shown in Fig. 4, which shows simulated spectra for C-3 of different isotopomers. The 13C spectrum of compound 4obtained from a mixture of [U-13C5]ribulose 5-phosphate and unlabeled ribulose 5-phosphate is virtually identical with the superposition of spectra for compound 4 obtained from unlabeled ribulose 5-phosphate and [U-13C5]ribulose 5-phosphate. It follows that the reaction proceeds by a strictly intramolecular mechanism. Because it is known that both enantiomers of 3,4-dihydroxy-2-butanone 4-phosphate can serve as substrates for 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine synthase of Bacillus subtilis (25Kis K. Volk R. Bacher A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2883-2892Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), we determined the configuration of the product of M. jannaschii3,4-dihydroxy-2-butanone-4-phosphate synthase. The CD spectrum shown in Fig. 5 is that expected for thel-isomer (23Volk R. Bacher A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19479-19485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, the M. jannaschii protein converts ribulose 5-phosphate into a mixture of formate andl-3,4-dihydroxy-2-butanone 4-phosphate. It follows that archaea and eubacteria use the same intermediate as precursor for the xylene ring of riboflavin. Sequence comparison showed that 17 polar amino acids were absolutely conserved in putative orthologs of the 3,4-dihydroxybutanone-4-phosphate synthase from microorganisms and plants. Most notably, a short stretch of charged amino acids extending from position 21 to 30 showed a high degree of overall conservation (Fig. 6). The hypothetical reaction mechanism (Fig.7) suggests a crucial role for acid/base catalysis, and polar ligands are probably involved in the interaction of the protein with the essential divalent metal ion (Mg2+or Mn2+). Preliminary NMR studies on enzyme-substrate complexes had also suggested that the conserved amino acid residues Thr-112, Thr-115, Asp-118, Arg-119, and Thr-122 interact with the substrate (45Kelly M.J.S. Ball L.J. Krieger C., Yu, Y. Fischer M. Schiffmann S. Schmieder P. Kühne R. Bermel W. Bacher A. Richter G. Oschkinat H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13025-13030Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The x-ray structure of 3,4-dihydroxy-2-butanone-4-phosphate synthase of E. coli in complex with glycerol, which is believed to bind at the active site as a fortuitous substrate analog, is also in line with the hypothesis that the loop comprising the conserved cluster of acidic residues is directly involved in catalysis (46Liao D.I. Zheng Y.-J. Viitanen P.V. Jordan D.B. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1795-1806Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The synthetic gene specifying 3,4-dihydroxy-2-butanone 4-phosphate ofM. jannaschii could be mutagenized conveniently using various experimental techniques. A total of 33 mutant genes could be expressed efficiently in E. coli. The recombinant proteins were isolated as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and their steady-state kinetic parameters were initially determined by a coupled photometric assay using 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine synthase as reporter enzyme (Table III). The replacement of glutamate 26, 28, or 185, aspartate 21 or 30, histidine 164, or arginine 25 afforded proteins with relative activities in most cases of <0.7%. Mutants obtained by the replacement of arginine 119 or 161, threonine 165, or glutamate 166 retained significant enzyme activity, but theirK m values were increased ∼10-fold. The sensitivity of the photometric assay monitoring the formation of 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine is limited by the stability of 3,4-dihydroxy-2-butanone 4-phosphate and 5-amino-6-ribitylamino-2,4(1H,3H)-pyrimidinedione. The relatively large K m and the relatively low catalytic rate of the auxiliary enzyme, 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine synthase, limit the accuracy of the assay still further, particularly in the case of mutants with low residual activity. Formate, the second product of 3,4-dihydroxy-2-butanone-4-phosphate synthase, has the advantage of virtually unlimited stability. For this reason, we measured the enzyme-catalyzed formation of formate by13C NMR spectroscopy in real time. To increase the sensitivity of NMR detection, we used [U-13C5]ribulose 5-phosphate as substrate. With the wild type enzyme, this assay recorded an activity of 174 nmol mg−1 min−1 as compared with 148 nmol mg−1 min−1 determined with the photometric assay. Energies of activation were 61 and 55 kJ mol−1, respectively, as calculated from the Arrhenius plot (290–330 K) for the NMR and the photometric assay. The two assays also gave similar values with mutant proteins, which display relatively high activities (Table III). Mutant proteins that had little or no enzyme activity according to the photometric assay were reanalyzed by the NMR assay. To maximize the sensitivity, the assay mixture contained protein in the millimolar range. Operating thus under single turnover conditions, the detection limit was 40 pmol mg−1 min−1. That value is equivalent to one molecule of product formed per subunit during a period of 16 h. Even at that level of assay sensitivity, the formation of formate could not be detected with following mutants: D21E, D21N, E26D, E26Q, E28D, D30E, H164N, and E185D. The data reported in this paper show that the formation of the riboflavin precursor, 3,4-dihydroxy-2-butanone 4-phosphate, from ribulose 5-phosphate proceeds similarly in eubacteria, fungi, plants, and archaea. An intramolecular rearrangement precedes the elimination of formate. The synthetic gene for the expression of the M. jannaschiienzyme enabled the production of the protein in high yield inE. coli. Because the synthetic gene comprises a closely spaced set of unique restriction sites, it is also ideally suited for mutagenesis by the replacement of short cassettes. This enabled the rapid construction of a large set of mutants addressing all conserved polar amino acid residues, which may be essential for catalysis. The published assay of 3,4-dihydroxy-2-butanone 4-phosphate activity (47Richter G. Krieger C. Volk R. Kis K. Ritz H. Götze E. Bacher A. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 280: 374-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) uses an auxiliary enzyme, 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine synthase, to monitor 3,4-dihydroxybutanone 4-phosphate. This assay is suitable for samples with a relatively high catalytic activity but becomes error-prone in the case of mutant proteins with minimum activity. A novel assay reported in this paper detects the formate formed by 3,4-dihydroxy-2-butanone 4-phosphate by 13C NMR spectroscopy. Formate has the advantage of virtually unlimited stability under the experimental conditions. To enhance the sensitivity of the method, we used [U-13C5]ribulose 5-phosphate as substrate that can be easily obtained from [U-13C6]glucose (24Volk R. Bacher A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20610-20618Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Using this assay, relative activities of 0.02% as compared with the wild type could be detected. 3,4-Dihydroxy-2-butanone-4-phosphate synthases have a characteristic motif of polar amino acids extending from residue 21 to 30 in case of the M. jannaschii enzyme (Fig. 6). Replacement of aspartate 21 or 30 or glutamate 26 or 28 reduces the enzyme activity in most cases to levels of <0.02% as compared with the wild type enzyme. Outside the patch of charged amino acids, the replacement of threonine 112, histidine 164, or glutamate 185 resulted in the reduction of enzyme activity by at least three orders of magnitude. The hypothetical reaction sequence in Fig. 7 suggests a large number of proton transfer reactions (around a dozen). Therefore, it is not surprising that charged amino acids could play a major role in such a complex reaction trajectory. We thank A. Werner for help with the preparation of the paper."
https://openalex.org/W2014983172,"The ILRE (interleukin response element) contained within the promoter of the interleukin-6 (IL-6) gene is defined as the site recognized by the p65 NF-kappaB transcriptional activator and is crucial for activation of the IL-6 gene. The region of the promoter containing the ILRE is complex containing a CCAAT enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) site immediately upstream of the ILRE, which is required for optimal activation of the IL-6 gene. Additionally, the ILRE overlaps a site that is recognized by the mammalian transcriptional repressor RBP (CBF-1), and RBP binding within the ILRE region represses activated IL-6 expression. In this study, the complexity of this region is further revealed by the identification of a second nested C/EBP site, which overlaps that of RBP and therefore also the ILRE. Optimal activation requires both the upstream and newly identified C/EBP sites in conjunction with the p65 NF-kappaB binding site. We previously reported that RBP represses IL-6 activation but does not target p65. We extend these analyses here to show that RBP binding does not occlude p65 from binding but instead directly overlaps the newly identified downstream C/EBP site, thereby impeding p65-C/EBP-mediated co-activation. This result suggests a role for RBP in the repression of other genes containing a C/EBP site that exhibits sequence overlap with the RBP site."

The selectivity of this process is determined by lysine-based phosphorylation signals shared by lysosomal enzymes of diverse structure and function. By introducing new glycosylation sites at several locations on the surface of mouse procathepsin L and modeling oligosaccharide conformations for sites that are phosphorylated, it was shown that the inherent flexibility of N-linked oligosaccharides can account for the specificity of the transferase for oligosaccharides at different locations on the protein. By using this approach, the physical relationship between the lysine-based signal and the site of phosphorylation of mannose residues was determined. The analysis also revealed the existence of additional independent lysine-based phosphorylation signals on procathepsin L, which account for the low level of phosphorylation observed when the primary Lys-54/Lys-99 signal is ablated. Mutagenesis of residues that surround Lys-54 and Lys-99 and demonstration of mannose phosphorylation of a glycosylated derivative of green fluorescent protein provide strong evidence that the cathepsin L phosphorylation signal is a simple structure composed of as few as two well placed lysine residues.

Booth J.L. Elmendorf B.J. Canfield W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31437-31445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The α subunit was shown to have nucleotide sugar binding activity, and on the basis of previous genetic data, it was known that the catalytic and protein recognition activities are likely to be located on separate subunits (7Bao M. Elmendorf B.J. Booth J.L. Drake R.R. Canfield W.M. J Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31446-31451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). This has since been verified by analysis of the transferase in cells from patients with mucolipidosis IIIC or variant pseudo-Hurler polydystrophy. GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase from these patients is defective in the γ subunit, which prevents phosphorylation of lysosomal enzymes, yet transferase activity on synthetic substrates is retained (8Raas-Rothschild A. Cormier-Daire V. Bao M. Genin E. Salomon R. Brewer K. Zeigler M. Mandel H. Toth S. Roe B. Munnich A. Canfield W.M. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 673-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar).Although the molecular basis for recognition of lysosomal hydrolases by the transferase has been studied quite extensively, a complete understanding of the nature of the recognition has remained elusive.

We have shown that lysine residues alone can account for most if not all of the energy of interaction between the transferase and mouse cathepsin L and that lysine residues are the major determinants for mannose phosphorylation of a wide range of lysosomal proteins (13Cuozzo J.W. Sahagian G.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14490-14496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequently, we identified two lysine residues, Lys-54 and Lys-99, as the ones involved in cathepsin L phosphorylation (14Cuozzo J.W. Tao K., Wu, Q.L. Young W. Sahagian G.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15611-15619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). On the basis of these results, a relatively simple model involving lysine residues was proposed as a general phosphorylation signal for lysosomal proteins. Similar involvement of lysine residues (15Nishikawa A. Gregory W. Frenz J. Cacia J. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19408-19412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 16Tikkanen R. Peltola M. Oinonen C. Rouvinen J. Peltonen L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6684-6693Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) has since been demonstrated for other proteins, and it is now widely accepted that lysine residues are the primary determinants for mannose phosphorylation of a wide range of proteins by the transferase.Our recent studies have focused on determination of the molecular dimensions of the phosphorylation signal and its relationship to the oligosaccharides that are phosphorylated. With this information, it will be possible to identify substrates for the transferase from information in structural data bases and to engineer phosphorylation signals on macromolecules for therapeutic purposes. In our previous study (17Cuozzo J.W. Tao K. Cygler M. Mort J.S. Sahagian G.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21067-21076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), we compared lysine-based signals that were identified for cathepsin L and cathepsin D, and we found that critical lysine residues were separated by a similar distance (∼34 Å) in the two proteins. In this study, we further define the cathepsin L signal by determining its relationship to the site of oligosaccharide phosphorylation. We also examine the involvement of residues in the vicinity of critical lysine residues and provide additional evidence for the simplicity and generality of the signal.DISCUSSIONFinding a common structural motif for recognition of protein substrates by GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase has been a long-standing goal in the field of lysosomal protein trafficking. Because the motif is three-dimensional in nature and is found on proteins of diverse origin and structure, it has been difficult to identify. Several studies have been carried out to determine which amino acid residues are necessary for mannose phosphorylation of individual proteins. Here, we provide evidence that the inherent flexibility of N-linked oligosaccharides enables these structures to be placed in a large although limited area on a lysosomal protein and still have access to the catalytic domain of the transferase. By placing oligosaccharides throughout the surface of cathepsin L, it was possible to identify a region in three-dimensional space where mannose residues are likely to be phosphorylated and the spatial relationship of this site to lysine residues Lys-54 and Lys-99 of the phosphorylation signal in the protein. Knowing the placement of the oligosaccharide in reference to the signal is necessary for identifying or constructing a signal that not only allows interaction of the transferase with its substrate protein but also provides access to its N-linked oligosaccharides and phosphorylation of one or more mannose residues.Findings of this study concerning the relationship of critical components of the cathepsin L phosphorylation signal to theN-linked oligosaccharide of the protein are summarized in Fig. 9. The distance of ∼34 Å between α-carbon atoms of critical lysine residues appears to be a general feature of the phosphorylation signal. This distance was demonstrated in our earlier study (17Cuozzo J.W. Tao K. Cygler M. Mort J.S. Sahagian G.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21067-21076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) for cathepsin D as well as cathepsin L (14Cuozzo J.W. Tao K., Wu, Q.L. Young W. Sahagian G.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15611-15619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and is consistent with results obtained for two other proteins, DNase I (15Nishikawa A. Gregory W.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6684-6693Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In the case of aspartylglucosaminidase, mutation of two lysine residues, Lys-183 in the α subunit and Lys-214 in the β subunit, was found to inhibit mannose phosphorylation by 96%. Because aspartylglucosaminidase is expressed as a α2β2 heterotetramer with a phosphorylated oligosaccharide in each subunit, these residues could be used in one or more of a variety of configurations for phosphorylation. Given this caveat, Lys-183 and Lys-214 are separated by 32.71 Å, consistent with distances of 33.75 and 33.63 Å for cathepsin L and cathepsin D, respectively (14Cuozzo J.W. Tao K., Wu, Q.L. Young W. Sahagian G.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15611-15619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 17Cuozzo J.W. Tao K. Cygler M. Mort J.S. Sahagian G.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21067-21076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Bovine DNase I has two oligosaccharides and requires four lysine residues, Lys-27, Lys-50, Lys-74, and Lys-124 for efficient mannose phosphorylation. Lys-27 and Lys-74 have substantial effects on phosphorylation but do not appear to belong to the same phosphorylation signal since they affect different oligosaccharides. The two others residues, Lys-50 and Lys-124, are located 34.31 Å apart, again consistent with the 34 Å inter-lysine distance. The site of mannose phosphorylation for procathepsin L, which was identified by determining the overlap of oligosaccharide clouds of highly phosphorylated glycosylation sites, is also shown in Fig. 9. The center of this region was calculated to be 26.83 Å from the closest critical lysine, Lys-99. The relationship of the site of mannose phosphorylation to the phosphorylation signal represents an intrinsic property of GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase and should apply to other transferase substrates.The results of this study suggest that the cathepsin L phosphorylation signal is polarized with one lysine residue (Lys-99) proximal to the site of mannose phosphorylation and the other lysine residue (Lys-54) distal. If the binding properties of these residues were equivalent, two regions of mannose phosphorylation corresponding to two transferase-binding orientations would be expected. Mutation of residues in the vicinity of critical lysine residues did not reveal involvement of other residues that would distinguish interaction of the two lysine residues with the transferase. However, it is possible that residues other than those tested could serve such a role. It is also possible that, because of the overall shape of procathepsin L, binding of the transferase to the cathepsin is sterically restricted to a single orientation or that binding in one orientation is nonproductive.The existence of additional minor or cryptic lysine-based phosphorylation signals on cathepsin L is consistent with data gathered on other mannose-phosphorylated proteins. The chimeric studies of cathepsin D, as the authors note, can be interpreted by having two independent phosphorylation signals, instead of having a single extended signal (9Baranski T.J. Cantor A.B. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23342-23348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The existence of two or more signals on cathepsin D explains why mutation of individual lysine residues affects phosphorylation of the two cathepsin D oligosaccharides differently and why localized phosphorylation of engineered glycosylation sites was not observed for this protein (12Cantor A.B. Baranski T.J. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23349-23356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Nishikawa A. Gregory W. Frenz J. Cacia J. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19408-19412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar).A previously unresolved issue concerning the nature of the phosphorylation signal is its level of complexity. Is the signal a complex, highly evolved structure that interacts with the transferase over an extended surface (29Nishikawa A. Nanda A. Gregory W. Frenz J. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19309-19315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) or is it a relatively simple structure composed of a few well placed residues (17Cuozzo J.W. Tao K. Cygler M. Mort J.S. Sahagian G.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21067-21076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar)? Two findings presented in this study address this issue. First, mutation of residues surrounding critical lysine residues to alanine had little if any effect on phosphorylation of cathepsin L. This supports our previous finding that lysine residues account for most if not all of the energy of interaction between the transferase and the cathepsin L phosphorylation signal (13Cuozzo J.W. Sahagian G.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14490-14496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Cuozzo J.W. Tao K., Wu, Q.L. Young W. Sahagian G.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15611-15619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that phosphorylation signals may actually be quite simple requiring as few as two well placed lysine residues as a minimal structure (14Cuozzo J.W. Tao K., Wu, Q.L. Young W. Sahagian G.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15611-15619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 17Cuozzo J.W. Tao K. Cygler M. Mort J.S. Sahagian G.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21067-21076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). This does not mean that additional protein factors are not important in selected cases. Arginine has been shown to partially substitute for lysine in some contexts (15Nishikawa A. Gregory W. Frenz J. Cacia J. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19408-19412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 16Tikkanen R. Peltola M. Oinonen C. Rouvinen J. Peltonen L.

Chem. 1998; 273: 21067-21076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Other residues in the vicinity of critical lysine residues may affect the accessibility or properties of the lysine residues. Effects such as this may explain the apparent involvement of tyrosine residues in phosphorylation of aspartylglucosaminidase and DNase I (16Tikkanen R. Peltola M. Oinonen C. Rouvinen J. Peltonen L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6684-6693Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 29Nishikawa A. Nanda A. Gregory W. Frenz J. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19309-19315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In theory, any residue in contact with the transferase when it is bound to the protein could affect the rate and efficiency of phosphorylation. The issue of complexity is also addressed by the finding that glyco-GFP is susceptible to mannose phosphorylation. Given the origin, subcellular location, and structure of GFP, there is no logical explanation for how a complex mannose phosphorylation signal could have evolved on this protein. On the other hand, phosphorylation of this protein is completely compatible with a simple phosphorylation signal composed of a few well placed lysine residues.Finally, a simple phosphorylation signal is compatible with what is known about the evolution of the mannose 6-phosphate recognition system. Utilization of the mannose 6-phosphate recognition system for lysosomal targeting was a relatively late event in evolution probably occurring sometime during early vertebrate evolution. Evolution of the system would have required a genetic mechanism for generating mannose phosphorylation signals on a structurally diverse set of lysosomal hydrolases. Generation of a complex structure on a diverse set of proteins would have required extensive remodeling of the proteins. If such alterations had occurred, one would expect to observe manifestations of these changes when comparing hydrolase sequences from species that utilize the mannose 6-phosphate recognition system and those that do not. Such manifestations have not been observed. A simple phosphorylation signal, such as the one described, would allow generation of phosphorylation signals on proteins of diverse structure through one or two point mutations and would be fully compatible with evolution of the system. The mammalian lysosomal protein targeting system has the capability of recognizing and modifying lysosomal hydrolases and growth factors from a wide range of protein families with high specificity. The molecular basis for this selectivity is due to the activity of the UDP-GlcNAc:lysosomal enzymeN-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase (GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase), which phosphorylates N-linked oligosaccharides of these proteins by the addition of GlcNAc-1-P (1Reitman M.L.

In the Golgi apparatus the phosphorylated proteins are bound to mannose 6-phosphate receptors, which mediate the delivery of the proteins to lysosomes. GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase has been purified as a 540-kDa complex composed of disulfide-linked homodimers of α and β subunits and two identical, noncovalently associated γ subunits (6Bao M. Booth J.L. Elmendorf B.J. Canfield W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31437-31445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The α subunit was shown to have nucleotide sugar binding activity, and on the basis of previous genetic data, it was known that the catalytic and protein recognition activities are likely to be located on separate subunits (7Bao M.

This has since been verified by analysis of the transferase in cells from patients with mucolipidosis IIIC or variant pseudo-Hurler polydystrophy. GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase from these patients is defective in the γ subunit, which prevents phosphorylation of lysosomal enzymes, yet transferase activity on synthetic substrates is retained (8Raas-Rothschild A.

In this study, we further define the cathepsin L signal by determining its relationship to the site of oligosaccharide phosphorylation. We also examine the involvement of residues in the vicinity of critical lysine residues and provide additional evidence for the simplicity and generality of the signal. DISCUSSIONFinding a common structural motif for recognition of protein substrates by GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase has been a long-standing goal in the field of lysosomal protein trafficking.

This supports our previous finding that lysine residues account for most if not all of the energy of interaction between the transferase and the cathepsin L phosphorylation signal (13Cuozzo J.W.

These findings suggest that phosphorylation signals may actually be quite simple requiring as few as two well placed lysine residues as a minimal structure (14Cuozzo J.W. Tao K., Wu, Q.L. Young W.

Arginine has been shown to partially substitute for lysine in some contexts (15Nishikawa A. Gregory W. Frenz J. Cacia J. Kornfeld S. J. Biol.

Other residues in the vicinity of critical lysine residues may affect the accessibility or properties of the lysine residues. Effects such as this may explain the apparent involvement of tyrosine residues in phosphorylation of aspartylglucosaminidase and DNase I (16Tikkanen R. Peltola M. Oinonen C. Rouvinen J. Peltonen L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6684-6693Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 29Nishikawa A. Nanda A. Gregory W. Frenz J. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19309-19315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In theory, any residue in contact with the transferase when it is bound to the protein could affect the rate and efficiency of phosphorylation. The issue of complexity is also addressed by the finding that glyco-GFP is susceptible to mannose phosphorylation. Given the origin, subcellular location, and structure of GFP, there is no logical explanation for how a complex mannose phosphorylation signal could have evolved on this protein. On the other hand, phosphorylation of this protein is completely compatible with a simple phosphorylation signal composed of a few well placed lysine residues.Finally, a simple phosphorylation signal is compatible with what is known about the evolution of the mannose 6-phosphate recognition system. Utilization of the mannose 6-phosphate recognition system for lysosomal targeting was a relatively late event in evolution probably occurring sometime during early vertebrate evolution. Evolution of the system would have required a genetic mechanism for generating mannose phosphorylation signals on a structurally diverse set of lysosomal hydrolases. Generation of a complex structure on a diverse set of proteins would have required extensive remodeling of the proteins. If such alterations had occurred, one would expect to observe manifestations of these changes when comparing hydrolase sequences from species that utilize the mannose 6-phosphate recognition system and those that do not. Such manifestations have not been observed. A simple phosphorylation signal, such as the one described, would allow generation of phosphorylation signals on proteins of diverse structure through one or two point mutations and would be fully compatible with evolution of the system. Finding a common structural motif for recognition of protein substrates by GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase has been a long-standing goal in the field of lysosomal protein trafficking. Because the motif is three-dimensional in nature and is found on proteins of diverse origin and structure, it has been difficult to identify. Several studies have been carried out to determine which amino acid residues are necessary for mannose phosphorylation of individual proteins. Here, we provide evidence that the inherent flexibility of N-linked oligosaccharides enables these structures to be placed in a large although limited area on a lysosomal protein and still have access to the catalytic domain of the transferase. By placing oligosaccharides throughout the surface of cathepsin L, it was possible to identify a region in three-dimensional space where mannose residues are likely to be phosphorylated and the spatial relationship of this site to lysine residues Lys-54 and Lys-99 of the phosphorylation signal in the protein. Knowing the placement of the oligosaccharide in reference to the signal is necessary for identifying or constructing a signal that not only allows interaction of the transferase with its substrate protein but also provides access to its N-linked oligosaccharides and phosphorylation of one or more mannose residues. Findings of this study concerning the relationship of critical components of the cathepsin L phosphorylation signal to theN-linked oligosaccharide of the protein are summarized in Fig. 9. The distance of ∼34 Å between α-carbon atoms of critical lysine residues appears to be a general feature of the phosphorylation signal. This distance was demonstrated in our earlier study (17Cuozzo J.W. Tao K. Cygler M. Mort J.S. Sahagian G.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21067-21076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) for cathepsin D as well as cathepsin L (14Cuozzo J.W. Tao K., Wu, Q.L. Young W. Sahagian G.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15611-15619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and is consistent with results obtained for two other proteins, DNase I (15Nishikawa A. Gregory W.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6684-6693Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In the case of aspartylglucosaminidase, mutation of two lysine residues, Lys-183 in the α subunit and Lys-214 in the β subunit, was found to inhibit mannose phosphorylation by 96%. Because aspartylglucosaminidase is expressed as a α2β2 heterotetramer with a phosphorylated oligosaccharide in each subunit, these residues could be used in one or more of a variety of configurations for phosphorylation. Given this caveat, Lys-183 and Lys-214 are separated by 32.71 Å, consistent with distances of 33.75 and 33.63 Å for cathepsin L and cathepsin D, respectively (14Cuozzo J.W. Tao K., Wu, Q.L. Young W. Sahagian G.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15611-15619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 17Cuozzo J.W. Tao K. Cygler M. Mort J.S. Sahagian G.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21067-21076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Bovine DNase I has two oligosaccharides and requires four lysine residues, Lys-27, Lys-50, Lys-74, and Lys-124 for efficient mannose phosphorylation. Lys-27 and Lys-74 have substantial effects on phosphorylation but do not appear to belong to the same phosphorylation signal since they affect different oligosaccharides. The two others residues, Lys-50 and Lys-124, are located 34.31 Å apart, again consistent with the 34 Å inter-lysine distance. The site of mannose phosphorylation for procathepsin L, which was identified by determining the overlap of oligosaccharide clouds of highly phosphorylated glycosylation sites, is also shown in Fig. 9. The center of this region was calculated to be 26.83 Å from the closest critical lysine, Lys-99. The relationship of the site of mannose phosphorylation to the phosphorylation signal represents an intrinsic property of GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase and should apply to other transferase substrates. The results of this study suggest that the cathepsin L phosphorylation signal is polarized with one lysine residue (Lys-99) proximal to the site of mannose phosphorylation and the other lysine residue (Lys-54) distal. If the binding properties of these residues were equivalent, two regions of mannose phosphorylation corresponding to two transferase-binding orientations would be expected. Mutation of residues in the vicinity of critical lysine residues did not reveal involvement of other residues that would distinguish interaction of the two lysine residues with the transferase. However, it is possible that residues other than those tested could serve such a role. It is also possible that, because of the overall shape of procathepsin L, binding of the transferase to the cathepsin is sterically restricted to a single orientation or that binding in one orientation is nonproductive. The existence of additional minor or cryptic lysine-based phosphorylation signals on cathepsin L is consistent with data gathered on other mannose-phosphorylated proteins. The chimeric studies of cathepsin D, as the authors note, can be interpreted by having two independent phosphorylation signals, instead of having a single extended signal (9Baranski T.J. Cantor A.B. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23342-23348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The existence of two or more signals on cathepsin D explains why mutation of individual lysine residues affects phosphorylation of the two cathepsin D oligosaccharides differently and why localized phosphorylation of engineered glycosylation sites was not observed for this protein (12Cantor A.B.

A previously unresolved issue concerning the nature of the phosphorylation signal is its level of complexity. Is the signal a complex, highly evolved structure that interacts with the transferase over an extended surface (29Nishikawa A. Nanda A. Gregory W. Frenz J. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19309-19315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) or is it a relatively simple structure composed of a few well placed residues (17Cuozzo J.W. Tao K.

The γ-chain, initially described as a component of the FcεRI signaling complex, is able to form multichain complexes with the ligand-binding α-chain of several Fc receptors (1Kinet J.P. Annu. Rev.

The FcγRIa (CD64), FcγRIIIa (CD16A), FcαRI (CD89), and FcεRI α-chains associate with the γ-chain as a common molecule in signal transduction. The stoichiometry of the assembly of the receptor complex is generally αγ2, except in mast cells, which may have FcεRI and FcγRIIIa complexes where there is, in addition, a β chain (αβγ2) (4Kurosaki T.

Expression of the FcγRIa α-chain in the presence or absence of the γ-chain has allowed an assessment of the functional capacity of each chain. For example, the γ-chain is necessary for FcγRIa-mediated phagocytosis and FcγRIa-induced activation of tyrosine kinase activity (7Lowry M.B. Duchemin A.M. Robinson J.M. Anderson C.L. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 161-176Google Scholar, 8Indik Z.K. Hunter S. Huang M.M. Pan X.Q. Chien P. Kelly C. Levinson A.I. Kimberly R.P. Schreiber A.D. Exp. Hematol. 1994; 22: 599-606Google Scholar, 9Davis W. Harrison P.T. Hutchinson M.J. Allen J.M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 432-441Google Scholar). However, the α-chain is sufficient for endocytosis (7Lowry M.B. Duchemin A.M. Robinson J.M. Anderson C.L. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 161-176Google Scholar, 9Davis W. Harrison P.T. Hutchinson M.J. Allen J.M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 432-441Google Scholar). Whereas expression of the FcγRIa α-chain without a CY domain can also induce pseudopod extension and endocytosis, recent data from our group and others have provided the first evidence that the α-chain of FcγRIa can alter receptor function downstream of IgG binding (21van Vugt M.J.

Expression of an FcγRIa α-chain lacking the CY domain in a murine macrophage cell line results in quantitative differences in the phagocytic and endocytic capacity of the αγ2 receptor complexes compared with wild-type FcγRI. Lack of the CY domain also changes the Ca2+ dependence of receptor-specific phagocytosis and abolishes the receptor-elicited IL-6 response. Expression of a similar receptor mutant in B cells results in alterations in the intracellular cycling of the internalized receptor (21van Vugt M.J. Kleijmeer M.J. Keler T. Zeelenberg I. van Dijk M.A. Leusen J.H. Geuze H.J. van de Winkel J.G. Blood. 1999; 94: 808-817Google Scholar). These data suggest a role for the α-chain CY domain in the regulation of FcγRI function. We have begun to dissect the molecular basis for the α-chain involvement in FcγRI signaling and cell activation. We now show that the CY domain of FcγRIa is constitutively phosphorylated and that receptor engagement and cross-linking result in a time dependent dephosphorylation. Inhibition of the dephosphorylation with okadaic acid, an inhibitor of type 1 protein serine/threonine phosphatase and type 2A protein serine/threonine phosphatase, blocks wild-type receptor-mediated phagocytosis and reduces tyrosine phosphorylation of the γ-chain. In contrast, both truncation and mutation of CY serines to alanine abrogate the effect of OA on phagocytosis and γ-chain tyrosine phosphorylation. These data suggest that serine phosphorylation of the FcγRIa α-chain inhibits early receptor-initiated tyrosine phosphorylation events. Furthermore, the selective reduction in IL6 production with truncation, but not with serine to alanine mutation, indicates that cytokine production is likely influenced by other elements engaged by the FcγRIa α-chain. The murine macrophage cell line P388D1 (obtained from American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) was stably transfected with a cDNA encoding human FcγRIa (WT) or a mutant form of FcγRIa containing a stop codon after the first amino acid of the cytoplasmic domain (Lys315→Stop 315) (CY−) as we have described previously (8Indik Z.K.

FcγRIa constructs encoding serine to alanine mutations (S328A/S331A, S339A/S340A, and S328A/S331A/S339A/S340A (S4→A4)) were prepared by overlap PCR and stably transfected as described previously (22Edberg J.C.

The protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein was obtained from Invitrogen. The type 1/2A protein serine/threonine phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid was obtained from Calbiochem. An okadaic acid analog, 1-Nor-okadaone, that does not possess protein phosphatase inhibitory activity (25Nishiwaki S. Fujiki H. Suganuma M. Furuya-Suguri H. Matsushima R. Iida Y. Ojika M. Yamada K. Uemura D. Yasumoto T. et al.Carcinogenesis. 1990; 11: 1837-1841Google Scholar) was obtained from Alexis Biochemicals (San Diego, CA). F(ab′)2 fragments of the anti-FcγRIa mAb 22.2 and Fab fragments of the anti-FcγRIIa mAb IV.3 were obtained from Medarex (Annandale, NJ). Mouse F(ab′)2 fragments and F(ab′)2 goat anti-mouse IgG (GAM) were obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, PA). Mouse IgG was obtained from Sigma. All other reagents were from Sigma. Quantitative huFcγRI expression was matched for cells expressing the WT and the cytoplasmic domain deletion mutant by fluorescence-activated cell sorting using anti-FcγRI mAb 22.2-fluorescein isothiocyanate (Medarex). Polyclonal anti-γ-chain Abs prepared in rabbits immunized with a C-terminal peptide sequence that is shared by both human and murine γ-chain were used for immunoprecipitations and blotting as we have described previously (22Edberg J.C. Yee A.M. Rakshit D.S. Chang D.J. Gokhale J.A. Indik Z.K. Schreiber A.D. Kimberly R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30328-30333Google Scholar). A polyclonal rabbit antiserum raised against the C-terminal 11 amino acids of the cytoplasmic domain of FcγRIa was prepared. Anti-phosphotyrosine mAb 4G10 was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). A rabbit polyclonal anti-phosphoserine Ab, soluble phosphoserine, and epidermal growth factor-stimulated A431 cell lysate (used as a positive control) were obtained from Zymed Laboratories Inc. FcγRI was immunoprecipitated from the transfected cell lines or U937 cells using either mAb 22.2 or mAb 197 (kindly provided by Dr. Paul Guyre, Dartmouth University Medical School) (26Guyre P.M. Graziano R.F. Vance B.A. Morganelli P.M. Fanger M.W. J. Immunol. 1989; 143: 1650-1655Google Scholar) prebound to protein G-agarose (Pharmacia Corp.). γ-Chain from transfected cells was immunoprecipitated by polyclonal rabbit anti-γ-chain Abs bound to protein G-agarose. Cells (10–20 × 106 cells/ml) were lysed in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Nonidet P-40 (Sigma) and protease inhibitors (EDTA/pepstatin/aprotinin/sodium orthovanadate/pefabloc). Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. For immunoblotting analysis, protein immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (22Edberg J.C. Yee A.M. Rakshit D.S. Chang D.J. Gokhale J.A. Indik Z.K.

Membranes were blocked with 10% nonfat milk or 3% bovine serum albumin followed by incubation with the blotting Ab/mAb. Blots were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline-0.1% Tween 20 and probed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG or anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Biosciences or Jackson ImmunoResearch). After three more washes, bound horseradish peroxidase-conjugated Ab was detected using ECL (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's directions. Membranes were stripped by incubation with Tris-HCl, pH 2.3, for 30 min at room temperature and then reprobed as described above. Phagocytosis by transfected P388D1 cells was determined in an adherent assay system (22Edberg J.C. Yee A.M. Rakshit D.S. Chang D.J. Gokhale J.A. Indik Z.K. Schreiber A.D. Kimberly R.P. J. Biol.

Biotinylated mAb 22.2 F(ab′)2, mAb IV.3 Fab, and biotinylated bovine erythrocytes were prepared as described previously (22Edberg J.C. Yee A.M. Rakshit D.S. Chang D.J. Gokhale J.A. Indik Z.K.

Biotinylated bovine erythrocytes were saturated with streptavidin and washed. The resulting bovine erythrocytes were coated with biotinylated mAb, and the level of mAb binding was verified by flow cytometry. P388D1 cells, adhered to round glass coverslips at 5 × 105 cells/ml, were incubated with anti-FcγRIa mAb 22.2 F(ab′)2-coated bovine erythrocytes (E-22.2) or anti-FcγRIIa mAb IV.3 Fab-coated bovine erythrocytes (E-IV.3) in RPMI 1640 medium/20% fetal calf serum (50 μl at 5 × 107bovine erythrocytes/ml) for 1 h at 37 °C. Noninternalized bovine erythrocytes were lysed by brief immersion of the coverslip in distilled H2O followed by immersion in buffer. Phagocytosis was quantitated by light microscopy and expressed as the phagocytic index (number of bovine erythrocytes internalized per 100 P388D1 cells). Treatment of cells with genistein (100 nm) to block protein tyrosine kinase or with okadaic acid (1 μm) to block protein type 1 and 2A protein serine/threonine phosphatase activity was performed by preincubating the coverslip-adherent cells for 30 min or 10 min, respectively, at 37 °C followed by addition of E-22.2 or E-IV.3 in RPMI 1640 medium/20% fetal calf serum as described above. Controls included loading cells with 0.1–1% Me2SO (depending on the concentration of inhibitor) for the same period of time. Cells were stimulated in 96-well tissue culture plates (Corning) with either phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, surface-absorbed rabbit IgG, or surface-adsorbed F(ab′)2GAM + mAb 22.2 F(ab′)2. Wells were coated with adsorbed protein (20 μg/ml rabbit IgG or F(ab′)2 GAM) for 2 h at 37 °C. For anti-FcγRI stimulation, mAb 22.2 F(ab′)2at 20 μg/ml was added to a suspension of cells for 30 min at 4 °C followed by two washes to remove unbound mAb. Cells (1–2.5 × 105 cells/ml) were added to the wells and cultured for varying periods of time. The level of murine IL-1β or IL-6 in diluted culture supernatants was quantitated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. For IL-1β determination, recombinant standard, capture Ab (polyclonal rabbit Ab) and biotinylated detection and neutralization mAb (clone 1400.24.17) were obtained from Endogen (Woburn, MA). For IL-6 determination, recombinant standard, capture mAb (clone MP5-2-F3) and biotinylated detection mAb (clone MP5-32C11) were obtained from Pharmingen. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (Jackson ImmunoResearch) and then 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine substrate were added, and the A 450 was determined. Aliquots of cells at 5 × 106 cell/ml were incubated with saturating concentrations of primary mAb for 30 min at 4 °C followed by two washes. For indirect immunofluorescence, the cells were then incubated with saturating concentrations of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG F(ab′)2 at 4 °C for another 30 min. After washing, the cells were analyzed immediately for immunofluorescence using a FACScan (BD Biosciences). Analysis of flow cytometry listmode data was performed using CellQuest (BD Biosciences). Statistical comparisons were performed with the paired t test. A probability of 0.05 was used to reject the null hypothesis that there is no difference between the samples. The cytoplasmic domain of the ligand binding α-chain of the human FcγRIa receptor complex (αγ2) exerts a quantitative influence on receptor-specific phagocytosis (22Edberg J.C. Yee A.M. Rakshit D.S. Chang D.J. Gokhale J.A. Indik Z.K. Schreiber A.D. Kimberly R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30328-30333Google Scholar). The quantitative phagocytic capacity of a cytoplasmic domain-lacking mutant of huFcγRIa is lower than that of wild-type huFcγRIa expressed in the murine macrophage cell line P388D1. Likewise, the kinetics of phagocytosis are slower in the tail minus mutant form of huFcγRIa compared with WT huFcγRIa in these cells. To explore possible mechanisms for this effect, we quantitated huFcγRIa-specific phagocytosis in these cell lines in the presence of several kinase and phosphatase inhibitors. Previous work has demonstrated that FcγR-mediated phagocytosis is dependent on tyrosine kinase activation. For FcγRIa, phagocytosis is dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation of the γ-chain. In P388D1 cell lines stably expressing either WT huFcγRIa or the cytoplasmic tail minus mutant form of huFcγRIa (CY−), phagocytosis was completely inhibited by pretreatment of the cells with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein (Fig. 1 A). Cell viability was unaffected by genistein during the time course of these studies, establishing a clear role for tyrosine phosphorylation in FcγRI phagocytosis. Receptor-specific phagocytosis was reestablished to normal levels in the WT cells during the 60-min time course of the phagocytosis assay if genistein was removed after the initial incubation period (Fig. 1 A). Interestingly, only 70% of the phagocytic capacity of the tail minus mutant was restored during the same time period. This observation was highly reproducible (p < 0.017, n = 9 pairs). Although the CY domain of huFcγRIa lacks tyrosine residues, it does contain four serine residues. We hypothesized that alteration in the phosphorylation status of the CY domain of huFcγRI might be important in regulation of receptor complex (αγ2) function. The type 1 and 2A protein serine/threonine phosphatase inhibitor OA significantly blocked WT huFcγRIa-specific phagocytosis (treatedversus untreated cells, p < 0.001,n = 15 pairs). In contrast, OA had no effect on phagocytosis mediated by mutant huFcγRIa lacking the CY domain (treated versus untreated cells, p > 0.05,n = 15 pairs) (Fig. 1 A). The addition of OA to the cells did not alter cell viability of either cell line during the 1-h phagocytic assay. Furthermore, pretreatment of the WT FcγRIa-expressing cell line with the OA analog 1-Nor-okadaone, which is structurally similar to OA but does not inhibit type 1 and 2A protein serine/threonine phosphatase (25Nishiwaki S. Fujiki H. Suganuma M. Furuya-Suguri H. Matsushima R. Iida Y. Ojika M. Yamada K. Uemura D. Yasumoto T. et al.Carcinogenesis. 1990; 11: 1837-1841Google Scholar), did not alter the phagocytic response. As an additional control for the OA treatment, we incubated P388D1 cells expressing human FcγRIIa with OA, and no inhibition of FcγRIIa-specific phagocytosis was observed (Fig. 1 A). These results strongly suggest that OA does not have nonspecific effects on the cells over the time course of these experiments and that serine dephosphorylation is important in regulation of huFcγRIa-specific phagocytosis in the presence of an intact FcγRIa cytoplasmic domain. We considered the possibility that engagement of the ligand-binding site of FcγRIa, which can augment receptor function (28Pfefferkorn L.C. van de Winkel J.G. Swink S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8164-8171Google Scholar), might alter the sensitivity of phagocytic to OA. However, saturation of the transfected P388D1 with murine IgG2a (22Edberg J.C. Yee A.M. Rakshit D.S. Chang D.J. Gokhale J.A. Indik Z.K. Schreiber A.D. Kimberly R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30328-30333Google Scholar) did not change the sensitivity of WT huFcγRIa to OA, nor did it change the lack of inhibition of CY− huFcγRIa phagocytosis (Fig. 1 B). To directly assess serine phosphorylation of the CY domain of the α-chain of FcγRIa, we examined anti-phosphoserine mAb binding to huFcγRIa immunoprecipitates from transfected P388D1 cells. Constitutive serine phosphorylation of huFcγRIa was clearly apparent in the murine P388D1 cells (Fig.2 A). The specificity of the anti-phosphoserine Ab was confirmed by the ability of soluble phosphoserine to completely block the reactivity of the Ab with FcγRIa (data not shown). As additional controls for the specificity of the anti-phosphoserine Ab, human FcγRIa in which all four cytoplasmic serine residues were mutated to alanine (stably transfected into P388D1 cells, see below) and the mutant FcγRIa lacking a cytoplasmic domain were immunoprecipitated and were nonreactive with this blotting Ab. Reprobing of the membrane with a blotting anti-human FcγRIa Ab confirmed loading of the serine-mutated form of the receptor (Fig. 2 A). Upon receptor-specific cross-linking, the level of phosphoserine decreased over a 5-min time period (Fig. 2 B). Reprobing of the membranes with a polyclonal rabbit anti-huFcγRI Ab confirmed equivalent levels of immunoprecipitated FcγRIa at each time point (Fig. 2 B). To verify the results of the anti-phosphoserine mAb, we also preloaded U937 cells with 32Pi and examined the level of phosphorylation of immunoprecipitated huFcγRI. Again, constitutive levels of 32P-labeled FcγRIa were detectable in resting cells, and, in agreement with the immunoblotting studies, cross-linking of the receptor resulted in a decrease in the level of 32P-labeled FcγRI immunoprecipitate (Fig.2 C). Treatment of the cells with OA before receptor cross-linking resulted in the preservation of FcγRI phosphorylation, demonstrating that the OA is acting, at least in part, at the level of the FcγRI α-chain. To directly demonstrate that dephosphorylation of the CY domain of FcγRIa is important in receptor function, we prepared three different constructs of huFcγRIa in which we mutated 1) the two membrane proximal serines to alanine (S328A/S331A), 2) the two membrane distal serines to alanine (S339A/S340A), and 3) all four cytoplasmic domain serines to alanine (S4→A4). These three variant forms of huFcγRI were stably expressed in P388D1 cells (Fig. 3 A), and all three receptors were functional, as demonstrated by their ability to mediate receptor-specific phagocytosis (Table I). For comparison, expression of the WT and CY− mutant FcγRIa is shown in Fig. 3 B. To determine whether dephosphorylation of any of the specific serine residues (or of some combination of serine residues) is required for receptor function, we examined the OA sensitivity of phagocytosis by each of these variant receptors. Like the CY domain truncation construct, receptor-specific phagocytosis mediated by each of the three serine mutant receptor forms was resistant to OA treatment (Table I). As expected, pretreatment of all lines with genistein resulted in complete inhibition of receptor-specific phagocytosis. These results, taken together, demonstrate a role for dephosphorylation of serine residues in the CY domain in FcγRIa-mediated phagocytosis.Table IFcγRIa-specific phagocytic index in P388D1 cellsBaseline phagocytic indexPhagocytic index (% control)aResults are reported as the percentage of control of number of internalized E-22 per 100 transfected P388D1 cells in the genistein (n = 3)- or okadaic acid (n = 8–10)-treated cells relative to control Me2SO-treated cells (n = 3 pairs for genistein, n = 8–10 pairs for OA).+Genistein (100 nm)+Okadaic acid (1 μm)WT FcγRIa168.6 ± 18.28.5 ± 2.1bTreatment versuscontrol: p < 0.005.20.9 ± 14.9bTreatment versuscontrol: p < 0.005.S328A/S331A-FcγRIa94.2 ± 16.47.6 ± 5.2bTreatment versuscontrol: p < 0.005.98.1 ± 11.5S339A/S340A-FcγRIa62.2 ± 13.19.1 ± 4.2bTreatment versuscontrol: p < 0.005.87.5 ± 25.8S4→A4-FcγRIa75.0 ± 9.86.0 ± 3.5bTreatment versuscontrol: p < 0.005.94.0 ± 24.1a Results are reported as the percentage of control of number of internalized E-22 per 100 transfected P388D1 cells in the genistein (n = 3)- or okadaic acid (n = 8–10)-treated cells relative to control Me2SO-treated cells (n = 3 pairs for genistein, n = 8–10 pairs for OA).b Treatment versuscontrol: p < 0.005. Open table in a new tab We demonstrated previously that the CY domain of FcγRIa is required for early FcγRIa-induced IL-6 secretion (22Edberg J.C. Yee A.M. Rakshit D.S. Chang D.J. Gokhale J.A. Indik Z.K. Schreiber A.D. Kimberly R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30328-30333Google Scholar). In contrast to the CY domain truncation form of FcγRIa, which did not elicit IL-6 secretion, receptor-specific cross-linking of the S328A/S331A, S339A/S340A, and S4→A4 mutants resulted in both IL-1β and IL-6 secretion 8 h after stimulation (TableII). We attempted to determine the sensitivity of FcγRIa-induced IL-1β and IL-6 secretion to OA, but the incubation of cells with OA for the time periods necessary for cytokine production was toxic to the cells and thereby precluded measurement of cytokine release. These results are consistent with a model of FcγRIa function that requires dephosphorylation of the FcγRIa CY domain for receptor-mediated cell activation.Table IIFcγRIa-specific IL-1β and IL-6 production by P388D1 cellsFcγRIa-induced secretion ofaResults are reported as ng/ml (average ± S.D., n = 3 independent experimental determinations) of cytokine above mock-stimulated cells (GAM-coated wells).IL-1βIL-6ng/mlng/mlWT FcγRIa546.7 ± 118.7301.3 ± 49.3CY− FcγRIa537.0 ± 112.622.7 ± 9.0bCY− FcγRIaversus WT FcγRIa: p < 0.001.S328A/S331A-FcγRIa519.0 ± 148.1326.7 ± 55.1S339A/S340A-FcγRIa577.0 ± 117.5287.0 ± 29.5S4→A4-FcγRIa554.3 ± 115.0332.7 ± 21.8a Results are reported as ng/ml (average ± S.D., n = 3 independent experimental determinations) of cytokine above mock-stimulated cells (GAM-coated wells).b CY− FcγRIaversus WT FcγRIa: p < 0.001. Open table in a new tab Among the earliest signaling events that occur after cross-linking of FcγRIa are the activation of Src family tyrosine kinases such as Hck and tyrosine phosphorylation of the γ-chain (29Cambier J.C. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 3281-3285Google Scholar, 30Wang A.V. Scholl P.R. Geha R.S. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 1165-1170Google Scholar, 31Durden D.L. Kim H.M. Calore B. Liu Y. J.

Given the importance of serine dephosphorylation for FcγRIa phagocytosis and the dependence of phagocytosis on the tyrosine phosphorylation of the γ-chain, we reasoned that OA pretreatment might alter the tyrosine phosphorylation of the γ-chain. Indeed, pretreatment of WT FcγRI-expressing cells with OA resulted in a dramatic decrease in the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of the γ-chain (Fig. 4 A). Comparable loading of γ-chain in all lanes was confirmed by sequential analysis of the same blots with the anti-γ-chain Ab. In contrast to the WT FcγRI-expressing cells, incubation of the tail minus mutant FcγRIa or the S4→A4 mutant FcγRIa expressing P388D1 cells with OA showed no demonstrable effect on receptor-specific activation-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of the γ-chain (Fig. 4 B). These results support the model that OA maintains serine phosphorylation of the CY domain of FcγRIa which in turn reduces WT FcγRIa mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of the γ-chain. The cytoplasmic domain of the FcγRIa α-chain can modulate the kinetics of both receptor-mediated endocytosis and phagocytosis (22Edberg J.C. Yee A.M. Rakshit D.S. Chang D.J. Gokhale J.A. Indik Z.K. Schreiber A.D. Kimberly R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30328-30333Google Scholar) and make receptor-specific phagocytosis insensitive to changes in [Ca2+]i (22Edberg J.C. Yee A.M. Rakshit D.S. Chang D.J. Gokhale J.A. Indik Z.K. Schreiber A.D. Kimberly R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30328-30333Google Scholar, 24Edberg J.C. Lin C.T. Lau D. Unkeless J.C. Kimberly R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22301-22307Google Scholar). These observations suggest that the FcγRIa α-chain interacts with intracellular molecules that can modulate receptor signaling elements and function. Previous work has shown that murine FcγRIa is constitutively phosphorylated on serine (33Quilliam A.L. Osman N. McKenzie I.F. Hogarth P.M. Immunology. 1993; 78: 358-363Google Scholar), and we now show that the serine residues in the CY domain of human FcγRIa are actively phosphorylated and dephosphorylated in relation to receptor cross-linking and that this phosphorylation is important in regulation of FcγRIa function. The constitutive phosphorylation of the huFcγRIa α-chain was observed both in transfected murine macrophages and in the human myelomonocytic cell line U937. Upon activation, the receptor is transiently dephosphorylated. Inhibition of serine dephosphorylation with the type 1 and 2A protein serine/threonine phosphatase inhibitor, okadaic acid, results in a marked decrease in receptor function, including both phagocytosis and tyrosine phosphorylation of the γ-chain. Mutagenesis of the four cytoplasmic domain serine residues suggests that at least several of these serines are involved in this modulation of FcγRIa α-chain function. Okadaic acid likely alters the phosphorylation of multiple intracellular targets, and we considered the possibility that OA might mediate its effects on phagocytosis by altering serine and threonine phosphorylation of the γ-chain. Indeed, the γ-chain is constitutively phosphorylated on threonine and upon receptor activation becomes phosphorylated on serine and tyrosine (34Durden D.L. Rosen H. Cooper J.A. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 569-577Google Scholar, 35Paolini R. Jouvin M.H. Kinet J.P. Nature. 1991; 353: 855-858Google Scholar). It is unlikely, however, that the inhibitory effect of OA on receptor-specific phagocytosis is due to alterations in γ-chain phosphorylation. OA does not alter phagocytosis in either the tail minus mutant form of FcγRIa or the FcγRIa serine to alanine mutants. Furthermore, OA does not alter FcγRIIa-specific phagocytosis. Taken together with the observation that OA alters the phosphorylation state of the FcγRIa α-chain, these data indicate a direct effect of OA on the phosphorylation state of the FcγRIa α-chain and suggest that this effect is responsible for OA altering FcγRIa-specific phagocytosis. The kinase(s) responsible for phosphorylation of the CY domain is currently unknown. Although protein kinase C activity is required for FcγR phagocytosis (36Karimi K. Gemmill T.R. Lennartz M.R. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1999; 65: 854-862Google Scholar, 37Larsen E.C. DiGennaro J.A. Saito N. Mehta S. Loegering D.J. Mazurkiewicz J.E. Lennartz M.R. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 2809-2817Google Scholar), it is unlikely that protein kinase C isoforms are directly involved in modulating the phosphorylation of the CY domain of FcγRIa during receptor activation. Notably, the receptor is dephosphorylated upon cross-linking, and analysis of the sequence of the CY domain using ProfileScan of the Prosite data base (www.isrec.isb-sib.ch/software/PFSCAN_form.html) does not reveal any potential protein kinase C consensus sites. Of course, it is possible that there are protein kinase C sites not identified by such analysis, but the observations that the classical protein kinase C α isoform is important in the FcγR-induced respiratory burst and that the novel isoforms protein kinase C δ and/or protein kinase C ε are involved in FcγR phagocytosis (37Larsen E.C. DiGennaro J.A. Saito N. Mehta S. Loegering D.J. Mazurkiewicz J.E. Lennartz M.R. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 2809-2817Google Scholar) suggest that protein kinase C family members play a role downstream of the receptor per se. Interestingly, motif analysis does indicate two consensus sites for casein kinase II, a kinase implicated in CD5 signaling (38Raman C. Kuo A. Deshane J. Litchfield D.W. Kimberly R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19183-19189Google Scholar). However, analysis of the FcγRIa CY domain and casein kinase II constructs using the yeast two-hybrid system has not shown any evidence of interaction between FcγRIa and either the α- or β-subunits of casein kinase II. Future studies will be required to determine the nature of the kinase responsible for constitutive phosphorylation of FcγRIa. The identity of the phosphatase(s) responsible for activation-induced dephosphorylation is also unknown. Our data with the protein phosphatase 1/2A inhibitor, okadaic acid, strongly implicate these phosphatases. Screens of two human leukocyte cDNA libraries for binding partners to the FcγRIa CY domain have not identified candidate phosphatases, but these serine/threonine phosphatases may be targeted to a signaling complex rather than the phosphorylated target itself (39Barford D. Das A.K. Egloff M.P. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1998; 27: 133-164Google Scholar, 40Pawson T. Scott J.D. Science. 1997; 278: 2075-2080Google Scholar). Perhaps the known interaction between FcγRIa and non-muscle filamin-280 (actin-binding protein ABP-280) regulates the localization of FcγRIa in the membrane (41Ohta Y. Stossel T.P. Hartwig J.H. Cell. 1991; 67: 275-282Google Scholar). The dissociation of this protein upon receptor engagement may change the relationship of FcγRIa with the actin cytoskeleton. As with other receptor systems, associations with cytoskeletal elements may be important in allowing localization of the receptor with a phosphatase(s) and other signaling elements activated by FcγR (42Tridandapani S.

Although the specific kinase(s) and phosphatase(s) targeting the FcγRIa α-chain remain unclear, our data indicate that the previous model suggesting that the γ-chain is both necessary and sufficient for FcγRIa function requires revision. We propose a model in which constitutive serine phosphorylation of the CY domain of FcγRIa regulates the ability of the receptor to initiate the tyrosine kinase-based signaling cascade necessary for receptor function. Upon serine dephosphorylation, the tyrosine-based signaling cascade is fully engaged, and receptor-induced cell activation proceeds normally. In the FcγRIa CY truncation mutant, the inhibitory influence of the phosphorylated tail is removed, allowing receptor function to proceed. However, the functional differences between this mutant form of the receptor and the wild-type receptor also suggest that the CY domain of FcγRIa facilitates signaling and is required for full receptor function, including the induction of IL-6 secretion (22Edberg J.C. Yee A.M. Rakshit D.S. Chang D.J. Gokhale J.A. Indik Z.K. Schreiber A.D. Kimberly R.P. J. Biol.

Geuze H.J. van de Winkel J.G. Blood. 1999; 94: 808-817Google Scholar). Thus, in addition to facilitating association with cytoskeletal components, the FcγRIa CY domain may serve as a scaffold for the binding of signaling elements critical for full receptor function. Our data also emphasize the potential for genetic variants of the CY domain to influence receptor function. Polymorphic variants of the extracellular domains of FcγRIIA, FcγRIIIA, and FcγRIIIB alter ligand binding and impact upon autoimmune disease susceptibility and severity (49Wu J. Edberg J.C.

Arthritis Rheum. 1995; 38: 306-314Google Scholar). In contrast, the CY domain of FcγRIIA, which contains a tyrosine activation motif, is invariate (54Edberg J.C. Wainstein E., Wu, J. Csernok E. Sneller M.C. Hoffman G.S. Keystone E.C. Gross W.L. Kimberly R.P. Exp. Clin. Immunogenet. 1997; 14: 183-195Google Scholar), and little attention has been focused on the CY domain of the γ-chain-associated receptors. We have recently reported two single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the CY domain of FcγRIa (55Gibson A.W., Wu, J. Edberg J.C. Kimberly R.P. Kammer G.M. Tsokos G.C. Lupus: Molecular and Cellular Pathogenesis. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1999: 557-573Google Scholar). By their proximity to the serines at 339 and 340, we can now speculate that these single-nucleotide polymorphisms may alter quantitative phosphorylation and resultant receptor function. An understanding of the biology of these single-nucleotide polymorphisms will no doubt provide insights into the molecular mechanisms of FcγRIa signaling and also into genetic susceptibility factors for altered immune function. Nonetheless, they provide evidence for the potential clinical significance of our current observations on the role of the FcγRIa cytoplasmic domain and its serine residues on receptor function.

https://openalex.org/W1977682255,"To examine the concept of polymerase active site tightness as a criteria for DNA polymerase fidelity, we performed pre-steady-state single nucleotide incorporation kinetic analyses with sugar modified thymidine 5′-triphosphate (TTP) analogues and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) reverse transcriptase (RT). The employed TTP analogues (TRTP) are modified at the 4′-position of the sugar moiety with alkyl groups, gradually expanding their steric demand. Introduction of a methyl group reduces the maximum rate of nucleotide incorporation by about 200-fold for RTWT and about 400-fold for RTM184V. Interestingly, the affinity of RT for the modified nucleotide is only marginally affected. Increasing the size to an ethyl group leads to further reduction of the rate of incorporation and first effects on binding affinities are observed. Finally, substitution for an isopropyl group results not only in a further reduction of incorporation rates but also in a dramatic loss of binding affinity for the nucleotide analogue. By increasing the steric demand the effects on RTM184V in comparison with RTWT become progressively more pronounced. Misincorporation of either TTP or TMeTP opposite a template G causes additional decline in incorporation rates accompanied by a drastic decrease in binding affinities. This results in relative incorporation efficiencies [(k pol/K d)incorrect/(k pol/K d)TTPcorrect] of 4.1 × 10−5 for TTP and 3.4 × 10−6 for TMeTP in case of RTWT and 1.4 × 10−5 for TTP and 2.9 × 10−8for TMeTP in case of RTM184V.

The intrinsic error frequencies of DNA polymerases are typically in the range of 10−3 to 10−5 per base replicated (1Loeb L.A. Kunkel T.A. Annu. Rev.

Most eukaryotic DNA polymerases show higher fidelity, whereas virally encoded polymerases are more error-prone. Recently, a new class of so called bypass polymerases have been discovered (4Friedberg E.C. Feaver W.J. Gerlach V.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

These polymerases are thought to have certain functions in DNA repair rather than replication and show error rates as high as 1 per 22 bases (9Matsuda T. Bebenek K. Masutani C. Hanaoka F. Kunkel T.A. Nature. 2000; 404: 1011-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Thus, depending on their function, polymerases show different degrees of selectivity for the nucleotide substrate. For example, it is conceivable that a viral polymerase has lower fidelity than a cellular polymerase, enabling the virus to escape the host immune system response by an increased mutation rate. Although our knowledge about polymerases has grown substantially in the past few years, the mechanistic details for this varied substrate selectivity are not fully understood (10Ellenberger T. Silvian L.F. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 827-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 11Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. Nat. Struct.

It is generally accepted that Watson-Crick hydrogen bonding by itself does not account for the observed selectivity. Several additional factors have been discussed to be involved in correct nucleotide recognition (2Echols H. Goodman M.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 477-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar, 13Goodman M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10493-10495Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 14Moran S.

Ed. 2000; 39: 990-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Among these factors are exclusion of water from the active site of the enzyme, base stacking, solvation, minor groove scanning, and steric constraints within the nucleotide binding pocket (16Kool E.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 191-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). It remains to be determined to what extent these factors contribute to polymerase fidelity.Here we used the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 1The abbreviations used are: HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; RT, reverse transcriptase; TRTP, thymidine 5′-triphosphate (R = -H, -CH3, -CH2CH3, and -CH(CH3)2); WT, wild type; p/t, primer/template; dNTP, deoxynucleoside triphosphate 1The abbreviations used are: HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; RT, reverse transcriptase; TRTP, thymidine 5′-triphosphate (R = -H, -CH3, -CH2CH3, and -CH(CH3)2); WT, wild type; p/t, primer/template; dNTP, deoxynucleoside triphosphatereverse transcriptase (RT) as a model system to examine the concept of active site tightness and substrate fit as a major determinant of nucleotide selectivity. The HIV-1 enzyme shows a moderate fidelity of about 10−4 (17Preston B.D. Poiesz B.J. Loeb L.A. Science. 1988; 242: 1168-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar,18Roberts J.D. Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Science. 1988; 242: 1171-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the mutation M184V, which provides high level resistance to the drug Lamivudine (3TC), has been shown to result in increased fidelity (19Pandey V.N. Kaushik N. Rege N. Sarafianos S.G. Yadav P.N. Modak M.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2168-2179Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 20Wainberg M.A. Drosopoulos W.C. Salomon H. Hsu M. Borkow G. Parniak M., Gu, Z. Song Q. Manne J.

Structural investigations indicate that a β-methyl side chain present in valine contacts the sugar ring of the incoming triphosphate, leading to steric hindrance (23Huang H. Chopra R. Verdine G.L. Harrison S.C. Science. 1998; 282: 1669-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (1353) Google Scholar, 24Sarafianos S.G. Das K. Clark Jr., A.D. Ding J. Boyer P.L. Hughes S.H. Arnold E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 2000; 300: 403-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). This might indicate that small changes of the geometry of the nucleotide binding pocket indeed affect fidelity. If this is the case, modifications of the nucleotide at this position should be felt by the enzyme leading to enhanced discrimination. As a steric probe, we used sugar modified thymidine 5′-triphosphate (TTP) analogues (26Summerer D. Marx A. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2001; 40: 3693-3695Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In these TTP analogues (TRTP) the 4′-hydrogen position of the sugar is substituted with alkyl groups (-CH3, -CH2CH3, and -CH(CH3)2), gradually expanding their steric demand.Recently, we demonstrated that these compounds are well tolerated by the Klenow fragment of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I. Their added size apparently increased selectivity, strongly supporting the steric model (26Summerer D. Marx A. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2001; 40: 3693-3695Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 27Strerath M. Summerer D. Marx A. ChemBioChem. 2002; 3: 578-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we reported on functional investigations of HIV-1 RT employing these size-augmented analogues TRTP (28Strerath M. Cramer J. Restle T. Marx A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 11230-11231Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Performing steady-state kinetic analyses, we found little difference between both enzymes when promoting “correct” incorporation of the different TRTPs. However, in misincorporation events the two enzymes behave differently. While 4′-methylation had little effect on the selectivity of HIV-1 RT, significant effects were observed for the Klenow fragment. Thus, these results may be a first evidence in support of the concept of active site tightness as a causative effect of differential fidelities among DNA polymerases.While steady-state kinetic analysis provides useful insights into the process of polymerase fidelity (29Creighton S. Bloom L.B. Goodman M.F. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 232-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 30Fygenson D.K. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27931-27935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), this method only detects the rate-limiting step of the overall polymerase cycle, which is the dissociation of RT from the extended p/t. Accordingly, this technique is not capable of elucidating protein/nucleotide interactions at the active site during nucleotide incorporation. DNA synthesis by RT follows an ordered reaction pathway (31Kati W.M. Johnson K.A. Jerva L.F. Anderson K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25988-25997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Johnson K.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 685-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar, 33Wöhrl B.M. Krebs R. Goody R.S. Restle T. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 333-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The first step is the binding of the nucleic acid substrate resulting in the formation of a tight RT·p/t complex in the low nanomolar range. Now the deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) enters the active site and binds in a two-step process (34Rittinger K. Divita G. Goody R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8046-8049Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). In a fist step a loose complex is formed. This is followed by a conformational change in the enzyme (e.g.closure of the fingers domain), leading to the formation of a tight ternary complex. The second step in dNTP binding represents the rate-limiting step for nucleotide incorporation and has been proposed to be responsible for the correct positioning of the dNTP within the binding pocket and accordingly determines specificity (35Kool E.T. Biopolymers. 1998; 48: 3-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The ternary complex then catalyzes the nucleophilic attack of the 3′-hydroxyl of primer on the α-phosphate of the dNTP resulting in nucleotide incorporation. Subsequently, pyrophosphate is released, and the enzyme either dissociates from the p/t (distributive mode) or translocates along the template to incorporate the next nucleotide (processive mode). The incorporation of the dNTP is thus defined by three kinetic steps: initial loose nucleotide binding, the rate-limiting induced fit, and the actual rapid chemical step.In this study we report about pre-steady-state kinetic measurements analyzing the correct and incorrect incorporation of 4′-modified nucleotides in comparison with the natural counterpart by HIV-1 RT wild-type and mutant M184V. This enables us to differentiate between certain steps during the polymerase pathway. Our data clearly show that the induced fit leading to a tight ternary complex is the main determinant of nucleotide selectivity. In addition, binding effects come into play when the steric distortion reaches a certain limit. Thus, our results support the idea that steric constraints within the nucleotide binding pocket are of major importance for polymerase fidelity.DISCUSSIONIn this study we have examined the effect of steric nucleotide probes (TRTP) on DNA polymerase fidelity of HIV-1 RT. If the concept of active site tightness being a major factor for polymerase selectivity holds true, such probes should have marked effects on incorporation fidelity. The underlying principle of this approach is rather straightforward. By increasing the size of a given nucleotide by 4′-alkylation, it will less likely be accepted by the polymerase due to steric constraints within the nucleotide binding pocket. In addition, analyzing RT carrying the M184V mutation, which has been proposed to cause steric hindrance within the active site, this effect should be even more pronounced.We found that incorporation of THTP by both enzymes, RTWT and RTM184V, showed very similar incorporation kinetics as well as binding affinities for the nucleotide. This finding was not surprising and has been reported earlier (21Feng J.Y. Anderson K.S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9440-9448Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 37Krebs R. Immendorfer U. Thrall S.H. Wöhrl B.M. Goody R.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10292-10300Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Additionally, this proves that the M184V mutation has no effect on the DNA polymerase activity of RT. On the other hand, RTM184V has been reported to confer enhanced fidelity (19Pandey V.N. Kaushik N. Rege N. Sarafianos S.G. Yadav P.N. Modak M.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2168-2179Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 20Wainberg M.A. Drosopoulos W.C. Salomon H. Hsu M. Borkow G. Parniak M., Gu, Z. Song Q. Manne J. Islam S. Castriota G. Prasad V.R. Science. 1996; 271: 1282-1285Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 21Feng J.Y. Anderson K.S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9440-9448Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 22Morales J.C. Kool E.T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 1001-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). This has been attributed due to steric constraints of the β-methyl side chain present in valine that is believed to contact the sugar ring of the incoming triphosphate (23Huang H. Chopra R. Verdine G.L. Harrison S.C. Science. 1998; 282: 1669-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (1353) Google Scholar, 24Sarafianos S.G. Das K. Clark Jr., A.D. Ding J. Boyer P.L. Hughes S.H. Arnold E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10027-10032Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 25Gao H.Q. Boyer P.L. Sarafianos S.G. Arnold E. Hughes S.H. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 403-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). To our surprise, introduction of a rather small methyl group at the 4′-position of the sugar ring, led to an ∼200-fold reduction of the pre-steady-state RTWT nucleotide incorporation rate, without affecting binding affinities. For the RTM184V this effect is even more pronounced, yielding an ∼400-fold reduction. This suggests that the rate-limiting step for nucleotide incorporation, the induced fit (e.g. closure of the fingers), is affected. Exchanging methyl for ethyl at the 4′-position results in further reduction of the incorporation rate combined with a slight decrease in binding affinity in case of the mutant enzyme. Finally, the TiPrTP analogue shows the most dramatic effect with incorporation as well as binding being affected. It seems that the initial nucleotide binding step tolerates modifications up to the size of an ethyl group, and selection takes place during the second step of nucleotide binding. In all cases the mutant enzyme incorporates the TRTP analogues with significant lower efficiency. There is a 4-fold decrease in RTM184V efficiency compared with RTWT for TMeTP, 13-fold for TEtTP, and 41-fold for TiPrTP (see Table I for details). This finding clearly supports the idea that the valine instead of the methionine within the polymerase active site causes steric hindrance, thus monitoring the size augmentation of the nucleotide probe. As a result incorporation efficiency decreases. In addition, this verifies that the sugar is also an important element of the substrate recognition process (40Joyce C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1619-1622Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar).Analyzing misincorporation of either THTP or TMeTP opposite template G, the observed effects were even more striking. In this situation the binding affinities as well as the incorporation rates are affected. We interpret this as both nucleotide binding steps (initial loose binding and the induced fit) being involved in substrate selection, thus leading to increased selectivity as compared with correct incorporation. Interestingly, RTM184V only shows a 2.9-fold lower probability to misincorporate THTP than RTWT. This result is in good agreement with findings reported recently (21Feng J.Y. Anderson K.S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9440-9448Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). However, when it comes to misincorporation of TMeTP the mutant enzyme shows >117-fold higher fidelity. It should be mentioned that this number must be considered as lower limit, since due to substrate inhibition the K d for “incorrect” TMeTP binding to RTM184V could not be determined accurately (see Table I for details). Thus, we could only determine a lower limit of 5 mm for thisK d. As it can be expected from the results shown for TMeTP, the K d values of the two other nucleotides (TEtTP and TiPrTP) are most likely too low to be determined experimentally. Thus, we excluded them from this particular experiment. Taken together, these results show remarkable differences between the two enzymes regarding misincorporation of the steric substrate probe, further supporting, along the lines discussed above, the steric model for DNA polymerase selectivity.Recently, we presented a detailed steady-state kinetic analysis performing essentially the same kind of experiments as described here (28Strerath M. Cramer J. Restle T. Marx A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 11230-11231Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). As discussed above, the limitation of steady-state kinetic analysis, however, is that only the rate-limiting step of the overall polymerase cycle can be detected. In our case this is dissociation of the enzyme·p/t complex. As long as nucleotide incorporation is faster than dissociation, differences in nucleotide incorporation rates can not be determined applying this approach. In other words, the incorporation rate (k pol) is masked by the rate-limiting step of RT·p/t dissociation. For this reason, we did not observe any differences in nucleotide incorporation rates (given asV max in that study; Ref. 28Strerath M. Cramer J. Restle T. Marx A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 11230-11231Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) for the different TRTP substrates performing steady-state measurements. In contrast, as outlined above, performing pre-steady-state kinetic analysis, we observe striking differences for the incorporation rates. Since both sets of experiments, the one described by Strerath et al. (28Strerath M. Cramer J. Restle T. Marx A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 11230-11231Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and the present one, were performed with identical substrates and enzyme batches, they are directly comparable. We therefore believe this is an excellent example showing the benefits of pre-steady-state kinetic measurements to gain insight into complex enzyme mechanisms. Nevertheless, both studies come to the same conclusion, albeit the effects in the steady-state analysis are less apparent compared with the present study.In conclusion, of the several proposed mechanisms for polymerase fidelity, our data highlight the importance of tight fitting of the nucleotide substrate within the polymerase active site. The presented data provide experimental evidence that minute chances of the overall shape and size of the substrate impose significant effects on nucleotide selection. This also holds true for alterations of the nucleotide binding pocket around the nascent base pair. Depending on the severity of the structural distortion, both steps of the nucleotide binding pathway, initial binding and induced fit, are involved in discrimination against noncanonical base pairing. The intrinsic error frequencies of DNA polymerases are typically in the range of 10−3 to 10−5 per base replicated (1Loeb L.A. Kunkel T.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1982; 51: 429-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 2Echols H. Goodman M.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 477-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar, 3Kunkel T.A.

For example, it is conceivable that a viral polymerase has lower fidelity than a cellular polymerase, enabling the virus to escape the host immune system response by an increased mutation rate. Although our knowledge about polymerases has grown substantially in the past few years, the mechanistic details for this varied substrate selectivity are not fully understood (10Ellenberger T. Silvian L.F. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 827-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 11Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 915-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 12Patel P.H. Loeb L.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 656-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). It is generally accepted that Watson-Crick hydrogen bonding by itself does not account for the observed selectivity. Several additional factors have been discussed to be involved in correct nucleotide recognition (2Echols H. Goodman M.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 477-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar, 13Goodman M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10493-10495Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 14Moran S.

Ed. 2000; 39: 990-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Among these factors are exclusion of water from the active site of the enzyme, base stacking, solvation, minor groove scanning, and steric constraints within the nucleotide binding pocket (16Kool E.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 191-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). It remains to be determined to what extent these factors contribute to polymerase fidelity. Here we used the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 1The abbreviations used are: HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; RT, reverse transcriptase; TRTP, thymidine 5′-triphosphate (R = -H, -CH3, -CH2CH3, and -CH(CH3)2); WT, wild type; p/t, primer/template; dNTP, deoxynucleoside triphosphate 1The abbreviations used are: HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; RT, reverse transcriptase; TRTP, thymidine 5′-triphosphate (R = -H, -CH3, -CH2CH3, and -CH(CH3)2); WT, wild type; p/t, primer/template; dNTP, deoxynucleoside triphosphatereverse transcriptase (RT) as a model system to examine the concept of active site tightness and substrate fit as a major determinant of nucleotide selectivity. The HIV-1 enzyme shows a moderate fidelity of about 10−4 (17Preston B.D. Poiesz B.J. Loeb L.A. Science. 1988; 242: 1168-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar,18Roberts J.D. Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Science. 1988; 242: 1171-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the mutation M184V, which provides high level resistance to the drug Lamivudine (3TC), has been shown to result in increased fidelity (19Pandey V.N. Kaushik N. Rege N. Sarafianos S.G. Yadav P.N. Modak M.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2168-2179Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 20Wainberg M.A. Drosopoulos W.C. Salomon H. Hsu M. Borkow G. Parniak M., Gu, Z. Song Q. Manne J.

Structural investigations indicate that a β-methyl side chain present in valine contacts the sugar ring of the incoming triphosphate, leading to steric hindrance (23Huang H. Chopra R. Verdine G.L. Harrison S.C. Science. 1998; 282: 1669-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (1353) Google Scholar, 24Sarafianos S.G. Das K. Clark Jr., A.D. Ding J. Boyer P.L. Hughes S.H. Arnold E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 2000; 300: 403-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). This might indicate that small changes of the geometry of the nucleotide binding pocket indeed affect fidelity. If this is the case, modifications of the nucleotide at this position should be felt by the enzyme leading to enhanced discrimination. As a steric probe, we used sugar modified thymidine 5′-triphosphate (TTP) analogues (26Summerer D. Marx A. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2001; 40: 3693-3695Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In these TTP analogues (TRTP) the 4′-hydrogen position of the sugar is substituted with alkyl groups (-CH3, -CH2CH3, and -CH(CH3)2), gradually expanding their steric demand. Recently, we demonstrated that these compounds are well tolerated by the Klenow fragment of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I. Their added size apparently increased selectivity, strongly supporting the steric model (26Summerer D. Marx A. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2001; 40: 3693-3695Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 27Strerath M. Summerer D. Marx A. ChemBioChem. 2002; 3: 578-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we reported on functional investigations of HIV-1 RT employing these size-augmented analogues TRTP (28Strerath M. Cramer J. Restle T. Marx A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 11230-11231Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Performing steady-state kinetic analyses, we found little difference between both enzymes when promoting “correct” incorporation of the different TRTPs. However, in misincorporation events the two enzymes behave differently. While 4′-methylation had little effect on the selectivity of HIV-1 RT, significant effects were observed for the Klenow fragment. Thus, these results may be a first evidence in support of the concept of active site tightness as a causative effect of differential fidelities among DNA polymerases. While steady-state kinetic analysis provides useful insights into the process of polymerase fidelity (29Creighton S. Bloom L.B. Goodman M.F. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 232-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 30Fygenson D.K. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27931-27935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), this method only detects the rate-limiting step of the overall polymerase cycle, which is the dissociation of RT from the extended p/t. Accordingly, this technique is not capable of elucidating protein/nucleotide interactions at the active site during nucleotide incorporation. DNA synthesis by RT follows an ordered reaction pathway (31Kati W.M. Johnson K.A. Jerva L.F. Anderson K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25988-25997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Johnson K.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 685-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar, 33Wöhrl B.M. Krebs R. Goody R.S. Restle T. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 333-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The first step is the binding of the nucleic acid substrate resulting in the formation of a tight RT·p/t complex in the low nanomolar range. Now the deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) enters the active site and binds in a two-step process (34Rittinger K. Divita G. Goody R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8046-8049Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). In a fist step a loose complex is formed. This is followed by a conformational change in the enzyme (e.g.closure of the fingers domain), leading to the formation of a tight ternary complex. The second step in dNTP binding represents the rate-limiting step for nucleotide incorporation and has been proposed to be responsible for the correct positioning of the dNTP within the binding pocket and accordingly determines specificity (35Kool E.T. Biopolymers. 1998; 48: 3-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The ternary complex then catalyzes the nucleophilic attack of the 3′-hydroxyl of primer on the α-phosphate of the dNTP resulting in nucleotide incorporation. Subsequently, pyrophosphate is released, and the enzyme either dissociates from the p/t (distributive mode) or translocates along the template to incorporate the next nucleotide (processive mode). The incorporation of the dNTP is thus defined by three kinetic steps: initial loose nucleotide binding, the rate-limiting induced fit, and the actual rapid chemical step. In this study we report about pre-steady-state kinetic measurements analyzing the correct and incorrect incorporation of 4′-modified nucleotides in comparison with the natural counterpart by HIV-1 RT wild-type and mutant M184V. This enables us to differentiate between certain steps during the polymerase pathway. Our data clearly show that the induced fit leading to a tight ternary complex is the main determinant of nucleotide selectivity. In addition, binding effects come into play when the steric distortion reaches a certain limit. Thus, our results support the idea that steric constraints within the nucleotide binding pocket are of major importance for polymerase fidelity. DISCUSSIONIn this study we have examined the effect of steric nucleotide probes (TRTP) on DNA polymerase fidelity of HIV-1 RT. If the concept of active site tightness being a major factor for polymerase selectivity holds true, such probes should have marked effects on incorporation fidelity. The underlying principle of this approach is rather straightforward. By increasing the size of a given nucleotide by 4′-alkylation, it will less likely be accepted by the polymerase due to steric constraints within the nucleotide binding pocket. In addition, analyzing RT carrying the M184V mutation, which has been proposed to cause steric hindrance within the active site, this effect should be even more pronounced.We found that incorporation of THTP by both enzymes, RTWT and RTM184V, showed very similar incorporation kinetics as well as binding affinities for the nucleotide. This finding was not surprising and has been reported earlier (21Feng J.Y. Anderson K.S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9440-9448Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 37Krebs R. Immendorfer U. Thrall S.H. Wöhrl B.M. Goody R.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10292-10300Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Additionally, this proves that the M184V mutation has no effect on the DNA polymerase activity of RT. On the other hand, RTM184V has been reported to confer enhanced fidelity (19Pandey V.N. Kaushik N. Rege N. Sarafianos S.G. Yadav P.N. Modak M.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2168-2179Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 20Wainberg M.A. Drosopoulos W.C. Salomon H. Hsu M. Borkow G. Parniak M., Gu, Z. Song Q. Manne J. Islam S. Castriota G. Prasad V.R. Science. 1996; 271: 1282-1285Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 21Feng J.Y. Anderson K.S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9440-9448Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 22Morales J.C. Kool E.T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 1001-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). This has been attributed due to steric constraints of the β-methyl side chain present in valine that is believed to contact the sugar ring of the incoming triphosphate (23Huang H. Chopra R. Verdine G.L. Harrison S.C. Science. 1998; 282: 1669-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (1353) Google Scholar, 24Sarafianos S.G. Das K. Clark Jr., A.D. Ding J. Boyer P.L. Hughes S.H. Arnold E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10027-10032Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 25Gao H.Q. Boyer P.L. Sarafianos S.G. Arnold E. Hughes S.H. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 403-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). To our surprise, introduction of a rather small methyl group at the 4′-position of the sugar ring, led to an ∼200-fold reduction of the pre-steady-state RTWT nucleotide incorporation rate, without affecting binding affinities. For the RTM184V this effect is even more pronounced, yielding an ∼400-fold reduction. This suggests that the rate-limiting step for nucleotide incorporation, the induced fit (e.g. closure of the fingers), is affected. Exchanging methyl for ethyl at the 4′-position results in further reduction of the incorporation rate combined with a slight decrease in binding affinity in case of the mutant enzyme. Finally, the TiPrTP analogue shows the most dramatic effect with incorporation as well as binding being affected. It seems that the initial nucleotide binding step tolerates modifications up to the size of an ethyl group, and selection takes place during the second step of nucleotide binding. In all cases the mutant enzyme incorporates the TRTP analogues with significant lower efficiency. There is a 4-fold decrease in RTM184V efficiency compared with RTWT for TMeTP, 13-fold for TEtTP, and 41-fold for TiPrTP (see Table I for details). This finding clearly supports the idea that the valine instead of the methionine within the polymerase active site causes steric hindrance, thus monitoring the size augmentation of the nucleotide probe. As a result incorporation efficiency decreases. In addition, this verifies that the sugar is also an important element of the substrate recognition process (40Joyce C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1619-1622Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar).Analyzing misincorporation of either THTP or TMeTP opposite template G, the observed effects were even more striking. In this situation the binding affinities as well as the incorporation rates are affected. We interpret this as both nucleotide binding steps (initial loose binding and the induced fit) being involved in substrate selection, thus leading to increased selectivity as compared with correct incorporation. Interestingly, RTM184V only shows a 2.9-fold lower probability to misincorporate THTP than RTWT. This result is in good agreement with findings reported recently (21Feng J.Y. Anderson K.S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9440-9448Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). However, when it comes to misincorporation of TMeTP the mutant enzyme shows >117-fold higher fidelity. It should be mentioned that this number must be considered as lower limit, since due to substrate inhibition the K d for “incorrect” TMeTP binding to RTM184V could not be determined accurately (see Table I for details). Thus, we could only determine a lower limit of 5 mm for thisK d. As it can be expected from the results shown for TMeTP, the K d values of the two other nucleotides (TEtTP and TiPrTP) are most likely too low to be determined experimentally. Thus, we excluded them from this particular experiment. Taken together, these results show remarkable differences between the two enzymes regarding misincorporation of the steric substrate probe, further supporting, along the lines discussed above, the steric model for DNA polymerase selectivity.Recently, we presented a detailed steady-state kinetic analysis performing essentially the same kind of experiments as described here (28Strerath M. Cramer J. Restle T. Marx A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 11230-11231Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). As discussed above, the limitation of steady-state kinetic analysis, however, is that only the rate-limiting step of the overall polymerase cycle can be detected. In our case this is dissociation of the enzyme·p/t complex. As long as nucleotide incorporation is faster than dissociation, differences in nucleotide incorporation rates can not be determined applying this approach. In other words, the incorporation rate (k pol) is masked by the rate-limiting step of RT·p/t dissociation. For this reason, we did not observe any differences in nucleotide incorporation rates (given asV max in that study; Ref. 28Strerath M. Cramer J. Restle T. Marx A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 11230-11231Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) for the different TRTP substrates performing steady-state measurements. In contrast, as outlined above, performing pre-steady-state kinetic analysis, we observe striking differences for the incorporation rates. Since both sets of experiments, the one described by Strerath et al. (28Strerath M. Cramer J. Restle T. Marx A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 11230-11231Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and the present one, were performed with identical substrates and enzyme batches, they are directly comparable. We therefore believe this is an excellent example showing the benefits of pre-steady-state kinetic measurements to gain insight into complex enzyme mechanisms. Nevertheless, both studies come to the same conclusion, albeit the effects in the steady-state analysis are less apparent compared with the present study.In conclusion, of the several proposed mechanisms for polymerase fidelity, our data highlight the importance of tight fitting of the nucleotide substrate within the polymerase active site. The presented data provide experimental evidence that minute chances of the overall shape and size of the substrate impose significant effects on nucleotide selection. This also holds true for alterations of the nucleotide binding pocket around the nascent base pair. Depending on the severity of the structural distortion, both steps of the nucleotide binding pathway, initial binding and induced fit, are involved in discrimination against noncanonical base pairing.

https://openalex.org/W1988734678,"The muscarinic cholinergic receptor (mAChR) subtypes share high sequence similarity except in their third intracellular loop and COOH terminus, domains thought to be involved in signal transduction. Subtypes M1, M3, and M5 couple mainly through Gαq/11, and M2 and M4 couple mainly through Gαi/o. Whether subtypes within each of these two groups differ in their signaling pathways remains to be resolved. This study focused on nuclear signaling pathways leading to activation of the transcription factor, serum response factor (SRF). Genes encoding M1, M2, and M3 were co-expressed in Jurkat T lymphocytes with a reporter gene driven by a mutant serum response element, SRE.L, which responds to SRF activation. We show that only M1 mAChR activated SRF through a pathway involving the small GTPase RhoA, with no response observed for M2 and M3. Transfection of GTPase-deficient Gα subunits (GαQL; constitutively active form) demonstrated that SRF was activated by Gα13QL but only marginally by GαqQL and Gα12QL in Jurkat cells. Yet transfection of regulator of G protein-signaling protein, RGS2 and RGS4, which inhibit Gαq/11 activity, indicated that Gαq/11 and Ca2+ mobilization were required for SRF activation by M1. Calmodulin inhibitors suppressed the M1 and the Gα13QL pathways, acting both upstream and downstream of RhoA. However, calcineurin inhibitors and the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein selectively suppressed SRF activation by M1, but not by Gα13QL, indicating the presence of separate pathways. The calmodulin-dependent tyrosine kinase Pyk2 was also activated by M1 but not M3, and Pyk2 appears also to play a role in M1-SRF activation, as judged by experiments with two dominant-negative Pyk2 mutants. These results reveal a novel calmodulin-dependent RhoA-SRF signaling pathway unique to the M1 mAChR subtype.

However, calcineurin inhibitors and the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein selectively suppressed SRF activation by M1, but not by Gα13QL, indicating the presence of separate pathways. The calmodulin-dependent tyrosine kinase Pyk2 was also activated by M1 but not M3, and Pyk2 appears also to play a role in M1-SRF activation, as judged by experiments with two dominant-negative Pyk2 mutants. These results reveal a novel calmodulin-dependent RhoA-SRF signaling pathway unique to the M1 mAChR subtype. Activation of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) 1The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; SRF, serum response factor; SRE, serum response element; mAChR, muscarinic cholinergic receptor; CaM, calmodulin; RGS, regulator of G protein signaling; Pyk2, Ca2+/CaM-dependent tyrosine kinase; RBD, Rho binding domain; i3 loop, third intracellular loop; IEG, immediate early gene; Cain, calcineurin inhibitor; C3 toxin, C. botulinum C3 ADP-ribotransferase; GST, glutathione S-transferase. 1The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; SRF, serum response factor; SRE, serum response element; mAChR, muscarinic cholinergic receptor; CaM, calmodulin; RGS, regulator of G protein signaling; Pyk2, Ca2+/CaM-dependent tyrosine kinase; RBD, Rho binding domain; i3 loop, third intracellular loop; IEG, immediate early gene; Cain, calcineurin inhibitor; C3 toxin, C. botulinum C3 ADP-ribotransferase; GST, glutathione S-transferase. leads to rapid changes in second messengers such as cAMP, Ca2+, inositol phosphates, or diacylglycerol. Long term GPCR effects on the other hand depend on changes in gene expression (1Marinissen M.J. Chiariello M. Pallante M. Gutkind J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4289-4301Google Scholar) via multiple pathways involving the Ras (2DellaRocca G.J. vanBiesen T. Daaka Y. Luttrell D.K. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19125-19132Google Scholar) and Rho families of small GTPases (3Post G.R. Brown J.H. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 741-749Google Scholar). Several mechanisms by which GPCRs and heterotrimeric G proteins couple to these pathways have been proposed (4Mao J.H. Yuan H.D. Xie W. Simon M.I. Wu D.Q. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27118-27123Google Scholar), including calmodulin-dependent transactivation of tyrosine kinase receptors (5Murasawa S. Mori Y. Nozawa Y. Gotoh N. Shibuya M. Masaki H. Maruyama K.

Moreover, receptor activation of Gα12and Gα13 was shown to activate Rho via Rho-GEF (guanine-nucleotide exchange factor) proteins, which enhance both the GTPase activity of Gα proteins and the GDP/GTP exchange rate of Rho (8Hall A. Science. 1998; 280: 2074-2075Google Scholar), or via tyrosine kinases such as Pyk2 (9Shi C.S. Sinnarajah S. Cho H. Kozasa T. Kehrl J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24470-24476Google Scholar). Nuclear signaling pathways may vary for each GPCR and in each tissue and, therefore, often remain unresolved. Muscarinic cholinergic receptors (mAChR) also affect gene expression such as transcription of the immediate early genes (IEG), c-fos and c-jun in neuronal cells (10Larsson C. Gustavsson L. Simonsson P. Bergman O. Alling C. Eur. J. Pharmacol. Mol. Pharmacol. Sec. 1994; 268: 19-28Google Scholar, 11Chou H. Ogawa N. Asanuma M. Hirata H. Mori A. J. Neural Transm. 1992; 90: 171-181Google Scholar, 12Ding W.Q. Larsson C. Alling C. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 1722-1729Google Scholar, 13Cohen R.I. MolinaHolgado E. Almazan G. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 43: 193-201Google Scholar, 14Tsiokas L. Watson M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 42: 272-282Google Scholar). Multiple mechanisms appear to contribute to nuclear signaling pathways of mAChR (10Larsson C. Gustavsson L. Simonsson P. Bergman O. Alling C. Eur. J. Pharmacol. Mol. Pharmacol. Sec. 1994; 268: 19-28Google Scholar, 12Ding W.Q. Larsson C. Alling C. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 1722-1729Google Scholar, 15Guo F.F. Kumahara E. Saffen D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25568-25581Google Scholar). The mAChR subtypes M1–5 share high sequence similarity with each other except in their large third intracellular (i3) loop and the COOH terminus. Subtypes M1, M3, and M5 form a group of receptors mainly coupled through Gαq/11, whereas M2 and M4 couple mainly through Gαi/o (16Wess J. Crit. Rev. Neurobiol. 1996; 10: 69-99Google Scholar). However, each GPCR subtype typically interacts with multiple G proteins (17Burford N.T. Wang D. Sadee W. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 531-537Google Scholar). Patterns of signaling pathways for the M1, M3, M5, and the M2, M4 subtypes are thought to be similar within each group even though the i3 loops and COOH termini of each receptor subtype, the main domains involved in receptor signaling, differ substantially (16Wess J. Crit. Rev. Neurobiol. 1996; 10: 69-99Google Scholar). Moreover, i3 loops and COOH termini are highly conserved for each mAChR subtype across species, suggesting distinct conserved functions for each subtype. Recent results with M1 receptor knock-out mice suggest differences in signaling between M1 and other mAChR subtypes coupled to Gαq/11 (18Hamilton S.E. Nathanson N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15850-15853Google Scholar). Whereas mAChR-dependent Gαq/11 coupling in brain tissue was reduced by only ∼50% in the M1 knock-out mice compared with the wild type, suggesting the presence of residual activity by M3 and M5, activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway was abolished (18Hamilton S.E. Nathanson N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15850-15853Google Scholar). Because M1 receptors represent a major target for Alzheimer's therapy (19Fisher A. Brandeis R. Chapman S. Pittel Z. Michaelson D.M. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 1991-1997Google Scholar), it is important to identify signaling pathways unique to the M1 subtype. The present work focuses on the transcriptional regulation of IEGs mediated by mAChRs in an attempt to identify novel pathways that differ among mAChR subtypes. IEGs regulate the expression of a variety of proteins involved in mitogenesis and neuronal differentiation (20Burstein E.S. Hesterberg D.J. Gutkind J.S. Brann M.R. Currier E.A. Messier T.L. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1617-1623Google Scholar, 21Hill C.S. Marais R. John S. Wynne J. Dalton S. Treisman R. Cell. 1993; 73: 395-406Google Scholar). Serum response factor (SRF), a key regulator of IEG transcription acting at serum response elements (SRE) (22Spencer J.A. Misra R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16535-16543Google Scholar), is a ubiquitous transcription factor that mediates serum- and growth factor-induced activation of IEGs via mitogen-activated protein kinases Ras and Raf (23Treisman R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 96-101Google Scholar). Another SRF activation pathway involves GTPases of the Rho family (24Gineitis D. Treisman R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24531-24539Google Scholar), which also affects cytoskeletal dynamics and converges on Ras/Raf (25Treisman R. Alberts A.S. Sahai E. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1998; 63: 643-651Google Scholar). Recent evidence indicates that heterotrimeric G proteins (Gαq/11, Gα12, Gα13) can mediate SRF activation through RhoA (7Gohla A. Harhammer R. Schultz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4653-4659Google Scholar, 9Shi C.S. Sinnarajah S. Cho H. Kozasa T. Kehrl J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24470-24476Google Scholar, 26Gutkind J.S. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1331-1342Google Scholar, 27Yamauchi J. Tsujimoto G. Kaziro Y. Itoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23362-23372Google Scholar). mAChRs were also found to activate RhoA via several mechanisms (4Mao J.H. Yuan H.D. Xie W. Simon M.I. Wu D.Q. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27118-27123Google Scholar, 9Shi C.S. Sinnarajah S. Cho H. Kozasa T. Kehrl J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24470-24476Google Scholar). In this study, lymphocyte Jurkat T cells were transfected with genes encoding M1, M2, and M3 mAChR to dissect the signaling pathways from receptor to SRF using a luciferase reporter assay. We show that in this cell line only M1 mAChR, but not M2 and M3, activates SRF-mediated gene transcription via a novel Rho pathway involving calmodulin and calcineurin and the calmodulin-dependent tyrosine kinase Pyk2. These findings demonstrate significant signaling differences between the closely related M1 and M3 receptor subtypes and, moreover, the M2 subtype in a pathway known to affect cytoskeleton dynamics and cell survival. Jurkat leukemic T cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin in 5% CO2incubator at 37 °C. Transfections were performed using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's instructions. Jurkat T cells (1 × 107) were co-transfected with 0.5 μg of SRE.L-luciferase reporter gene plasmid and 2 μg of either empty pSG5 vector or mAChRs cDNA in pSG5 vector. The transfection was stopped after 4 h by adding medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum. Gαq and Gα12cDNA constructs (in pCDNAI vector) and Gα13constructs (in pCEV29 vector) were kindly provided by Drs. Ethan Burstein and Mark Brann (Acadia Pharmaceuticals, San Diego, CA). Other human Gα protein constructs, Gα11, Gα14, Gα15, and their QL mutants as well as human RGS2, RGS4, and RhoA constructs (all in pCDNA3 vector) were from Guthrie cDNA Resource Center (Guthrie Research Institute, Sayre, PA). Rat RGS12 cDNA in pCMV5 vector was from Dr. Canhe Chen (National University of Singapore, Singapore). Rat calcineurin inhibitor (Cain) (28Lai M.M. Burnett P.E. Wolosker H. Blackshaw S. Snyder S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18325-18331Google Scholar) COOH-terminal fragment (CainC, Cain2078–2173) in pRK5 vector was from Dr. Michael Lai (John Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland). SRE.L-luciferase reporter plasmid (29Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5421-5432Google Scholar) andClostridium botulinum C3 ADP-ribotransferase (C3 toxin) were provided by Dr. Songzhu An, University of California, San Francisco, California. Myc-tagged rat Pyk2 cDNA in pcDNA3 vector was kindly provided by Dr. H. S. Earp (University of North Carolina) (30Yu H., Li, X. Marchetto G.S., Dy, R. Hunter D. Calvo B. Dawson T.L. Wilm M. Anderegg R.J. Graves L.M. Earp H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29993-29998Google Scholar). The dominant negative mutants of Pyk2, K457A-Pyk2 and Y402F-Pyk2 (31Frank G.D. Saito S. Motley E.D. Sasaki T. Ohba M. Kuroki T. Inagami T. Eguchi S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 367-377Google Scholar), were constructed by using the QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Holla, CA) and sequenced. Rho binding domain of mouse rhotekin (amino acids −8 to 89) (32Reid T. Furayashiki T. Ishizaki T. Watanabe G. Watanabe N. Fujisawa K. Morii N. Madaule P. Narumiya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13556-13560Google Scholar) in pGEX-3X vector was generously provided by Dr. S. Narumiya (Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan). The genes encoding the human mAChR subtypes (M1, M2, and M3) in pSG5 vector were obtained from a human placental genomic library as previously described (33Maeda S. Lameh J. Mallet W.G. Philip M. Ramachandran J. Sadee W. FEBS Lett. 1990; 269: 386-388Google Scholar, 34Moro O. Lameh J. Sadee W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6862-6865Google Scholar). The gene encoding Gαi/qchimera (Gαiq5) was constructed by exchanging of the COOH termini between Gαi and Gαq, which switches the specificity of Gαi-coupled receptor to Gαq (35Kostenis E. Zeng F.Y. Wess J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17886-17892Google Scholar) (obtained from Dr. Bruce Conklin, University of California, San Francisco, California). Eighteen hours after transfection, cells were replated in 96-well plates and stimulated with or without the mAChR agonist carbachol at 37 °C for 4 h as indicated. Cells were then lysed by reporter lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, WI), and luciferase activities were measured with a luminometer (EG&G). For inhibitor experiments, cells were preincubated with inhibitors for 30 min before adding carbachol. The Dual-Luciferase® reporter assay system (Promega) was used to normalize the transfection efficiency where indicated. pRL-CMV vector yielding constitutive expression of Renilla luciferase was co-transfected with the SRE.L reporter gene vector, and dual luciferase activities were measured according to the manufacturer's protocol. Expression of M1, M2, and M3 mAChR receptors was determined by measuring the binding ofN-[3H]methylscopolamine on the surface of intact cells as previously described (36Lameh J. Philip M. Sharma Y.K. Moro O. Ramachandran J. Sadee W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13406-13412Google Scholar). Briefly, transfected cells were incubated with 1.5–2.0 nm N-[3H]methylscopolamine in phosphate-buffered saline at 12 °C for 90 min. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 10 μm atropine. After labeling, cells were placed on ice, filtered, and rinsed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline three times (S&S No. 32 glass fiber filter). The radioactivity on the filters was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Measurement of free intracellular calcium was determined as described (37Lin K.D. Sadee W. Quillan J.M. Biotechniques. 1999; 26 (322, 324–326): 318-320Google Scholar). Briefly, 18 h after transfection, cells were washed with Krebs-HEPES buffer and loaded with 3 μm Oregon Green 488 fluorescent dye at room temperature for 30 min. After loading, cells were washed 3 times with Krebs-HEPES buffer containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin, diluted to ∼2 × 106 cells/ml, and distributed evenly (3 × 105 cells/well) into an opaque white 96-well plate (Corning Costar, Cambridge, MA). Buffer control (4 samples/data point) or buffer containing test compounds (4 samples/data point measured immediately before the 4 control samples) was injected sequentially into separate wells, and the fluorescence intensity was monitored at 1-s intervals using an excitation wavelength of 485 nm and emission of 538 nm. The pull-down assay for GTP-Rho was performed as previously reported (38Kimura K. Tsuji T. Takada Y. Miki T. Narumiya S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17233-17236Google Scholar). Bacterially expressed GST-rhotekin Rho binding domain (GST-RBD)was purified from isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (0.5 mm)-induced BL21 cells previously transformed with mouse rhotekin (amino acids −8 to 89 in pGEX-3x vector) according to the instruction manual provided by the supplier of the pGEX vector (Amersham Biosciences). GST-RBD bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads was used immediately after preparation. 2 × 107Jurkat cells were transfected with 4 μg of hM1-pSG5 or hM3-pSG5 plasmids or 2 μg of Gα13QL or Pyk2 plasmids. 24 h after transfection, cells were collected and resuspended in 0.3 ml of Hanks' solution (0.4 g/liter KCl, 0.06 g/liter KH2PO4, 8 g/liter NaCl, 0.09 g/liter Na2HPO4·7H2O, 0.35 g/liter NaHCO3, and 1 g/liter glucose). After incubation at 37 °C for 30 min, cells were treated as indicated and then lysed with 0.3 ml 2× lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1 m NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 20 μg/ml each leupeptin and aprotinin). Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min, and equal amounts of proteins (500 μg) were incubated with GST-RBD (∼30 μg) beads at 4 °C for 90 min. Then the beads were washed 4 times with washing buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mmNaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 μg/ml each leupeptin and aprotinin, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Bound Rho protein was detected by Western blotting using a monoclonal antibody against RhoA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology,California). 107 Jurkat cells were transfected with 2 μg of hM1-pGS5 or hM3-pSG5 together with 0.5 μg of Pyk2 plasmid. 24 h after transfection, cells were washed with serum-free medium then resuspended in 0.3 ml of Hanks' solution and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. After treatment with different reagents, cells were placed on ice, and 0.3 ml of 2× lysis buffer was added (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm NaF, 2% Nonidet P-40, 10 mmNaVO3, 20 μg/ml each of leupeptin and aprotinin). After incubation on ice for 10 min, cell lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. A suspension of 60 μl of 50% protein G-Sepharose beads was added to the supernatants (Amersham Biosciences) and incubated at 4 °C for 30 min with rotation. The beads were centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 2 min. The precleared lysates were incubated with anti-Pyk2 monoclonal antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) at 4 °C for 24 h. Then 60 μl of 50% protein G beads was added and incubated for another 2 h at 4 °C with rotation. The beads were washed 3 times with 1× lysis buffer, and bound proteins were eluted with 30 μl of sample loading buffer. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and phosphorylated Pyk2 was detected by anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody (4G10) (Upstate, Lake Placid, NY). Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism, version 2.0 (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA). We tested the ability of transfected M1, M2, and M3 mAChRs to regulate SRF-mediated gene transcription using a luciferase reporter gene. The reporter construct used, SRE.L, is a derivative of c-Fos SRE, which is activated by SRF acting alone and does not require formation of tertiary complex (29Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5421-5432Google Scholar). The plasmids expressing different mAChRs were co-transfected with the SRE.L-luciferase reporter gene into Jurkat cells. Treatment with the mAChR agonist carbachol (1 mm) increased SRF activity only in M1 mAChR-transfected cells (Fig.1 a) even though all three transfected cell lines expressed comparable levels of receptor on the surface, measured with the membrane-impermeable tracerN-[3H]methylscopolamine (300–400 fmol receptor/mg of protein). SRF activation induced by M1 mAChR was antagonized by 1 μm atropine (Fig. 1 a), indicating that activation was a mAChR-mediated process. SRF-mediated gene transcription was activated in M1-transfected cells within 1 h and reached a maximum after 4 h of carbachol treatment. Thus, 4 h of treatment was used in all follow-up experiments. SRF was activated in a dose-dependent manner, with a carbachol EC50 of 10 μm, which is comparable with the EC50 values obtained for inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate production and Ca2+ release by M1. M1 mAChR has been shown to activate SRF in several cell lines via multiple heterotrimeric G proteins, including Gαq/11 and Gα12/13 (4Mao J.H. Yuan H.D. Xie W. Simon M.I. Wu D.Q. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27118-27123Google Scholar, 39Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1839-1842Google Scholar). In contrast to the results with M1, the closely related Gαq/11-coupled M3 failed to activate SRF upon stimulation with carbachol in Jurkat T cells. To determine whether M1 and M3 mAChR couple efficiently to G proteins in Jurkat cells, intracellular Ca2+ release by carbachol was measured. Both receptors independently elicited Ca2+ mobilization (Fig.2, a and b) with similar intensity and duration, indicating effective coupling to Gαq/11 in this system. To test whether differences in receptor expression could have contributed to the discrepancy in SRF activation between M1 and M3 mAChR, experiments were carried out with different amounts of DNA (ranging from 1 to 10 μg of DNA) used for transfection. This did not affect SRF activation by M1, whereas M3 mAChR was inactive under all conditions tested (data not shown). To test whether Gαi/o proteins are involved in M1-mediated SRF activation, we treated Jurkat cells with pertussis toxin to inactivate Gαi/o. Shown in Fig. 1 b, pertussis toxin had no significant effect on M1-mediated SRF activation. The Gαi/o-coupled M2 receptor alone also did not mobilize Ca2+ nor SRF activation in Jurkat T cells (Fig. 1 a and 2 c). To further test the involvement of Gαq/11 signaling in SRF activation, a Gαi/Gαq chimeric construct (Gαiq5) was transfected together with M2 receptor. Substituting the COOH terminus of Gαq with that of Gαi, Gαiq5 confers Gαq/11-coupling specificity to Gαi-coupled receptors (35Kostenis E. Zeng F.Y. Wess J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17886-17892Google Scholar). After co-transfection of M2 receptor with Gαiq5, carbachol stimulated a robust Ca2+release in M2 mAChR-expressing cells comparable with M1-transfected cells (Fig. 2 c). However, the same pool of cells failed to stimulate SRF activation (Fig. 1 a). This result suggests the hypothesis that Gαq/11 itself is either not required or insufficient for SRF activation by M1 in Jurkat T cells. Gαiq5 transfection alone had no detectable effect on SRF activation. The ability of various Gα protein subunits to regulate SRF gene transcription was determined by co-transfecting Jurkat cells with the reporter gene plasmid and cDNA encoding various Gα subunits and their constitutively active mutants, GαqQ209L, Gα11Q209L, Gα12Q231L, Gα13Q226L, Gα14Q205L, and Gα15Q212L. To account for differences in expression efficiency, we normalized the data using a dual luciferase plasmid strategy (Promega). Our results showed a similar pattern with or without normalization. Cells overexpressing normal Gα subunits (Gαq, Gα11, Gα12, Gα13, Gα14, and Gα15) did not activate SRF nor did co-transfection of these Gα subunits enable M3 to activate SRF or enhance M1-mediated SRF activation (data not shown). This result suggests that the inability of M3 to activate SRF does not appear to result from a lack of these Gα subunits. Of the constitutively active Gα subunit tested, only Gα13QL strongly activated SRF (Fig.3 a), whereas GαqQL and Gα12QL were less effective and in some experiments did not exceed 10–20% of the level achieved with Gα13QL. Other constructs had no significant effects on SRF activation (Fig. 3 a). Regulators of G protein signaling (RGS) are GTPase-activating proteins capable of attenuating heterotrimeric G protein signaling. RGS2 and RGS4 proteins function as GTPase-activating proteins for Gαq/11 (40Xu X. Zeng W.H. Popov S. Berman D.M. Davignon I., Yu, K. Yowe D. Offermanns S. Muallem S. Wilkie T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3549-3556Google Scholar), and RGS4 functions additionally for Gαi/o (41Huang C.F. Hepler J.R. Gilman A.G. Mumby S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6159-6163Google Scholar) but not for Gα12/13 (4Mao J.H. Yuan H.D. Xie W. Simon M.I. Wu D.Q. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27118-27123Google Scholar). In contrast, RGS12 is a selective inhibitor of Gα12/13signaling (4Mao J.H. Yuan H.D. Xie W. Simon M.I. Wu D.Q. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27118-27123Google Scholar, 40Xu X. Zeng W.H. Popov S. Berman D.M. Davignon I., Yu, K. Yowe D. Offermanns S. Muallem S. Wilkie T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3549-3556Google Scholar). To test the involvement of Gαq/11 and Gα12/13 in M1-mediated SRF activation, we co-transfected cells with cDNAs encoding M1, the reporter gene, and RGS2, RGS4, or RGS12. Shown in Fig. 3 b, RGS2 and RGS4 proteins blocked M1-mediated SRF activation. This result suggests that Gαq/11 does play a role in M1-mediated SRF activation. In contrast, RGS12 had little effect on M1-stimulated SRF activation (Fig.3 b). This result is in contrast to a previous report that RGS12 inhibited M1-mediated SRF activation in NIH 3T3 cells (4Mao J.H. Yuan H.D. Xie W. Simon M.I. Wu D.Q. J. Biol.

Small GTPases such as RhoA and Cdc42 are involved in SRF activation. In the present study, two different approaches were utilized to test the involvement RhoA in SRF activation. First, C3 toxin (C. botulinum C3 transferase), which specifically inhibits RhoA by ADP-ribosylation (42Quilliam L.A. Lacal J.C. Bokoch G.M. FEBS Lett. 1989; 247: 221-226Google Scholar), was expressed along with M1 mAChR. Second, the dominant negative RhoA construct T19N-RhoA, which acts to block the upstream activation of endogenous Rho, was used. In this transfection system, both C3 and dominant negative Rho (Fig. 3 c) blocked SRF activation. Multiple signaling proteins can regulate the SRF pathway. To test the involvement of kinases and phosphatases in SRF activation, a panel of inhibitors was used in M1-transfected Jurkat cells. Inhibitors of mitogen-activated protein kinase (PD98059), protein kinase C (K252a), calmodulin kinase (KN62), and protein kinase A (H89) had no effect on SRF activation by M1 at concentrations selected for activity against the respective target enzymes (Fig.4 a). In contrast, the calmodulin (CaM) inhibitor W7 and the calcineurin inhibitor cyclosporin A dose-dependently inhibited SRF-dependent gene transcription mediated by M1 (Fig. 4, a and b). Higher concentrations of W7 additionally lowered basal SRF activity, observed in the absence of carbachol. The calcineurin inhibitor failed to fully inhibit M1-mediated SRF activation in numerous experiments, suggesting the presence of a minor, calcineurin-independent pathway. M1-mediated SRF activation was also inhibited by the intracellular calcium chelator BAPTA/AM (Fig. 4 a), consistent with a Ca2+-dependent pathway. Moreover, M1-mediated SRF activation was inhibited by the general tyrosine kinase inhibitor, genistein, but not by the epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor AG1478 (Fig. 4 a). To further test the involvement of CaM and calcineurin in SRF activation mediated by M1, we used another potent CaM inhibitor, ophiobolin A, and a plasmid encoding endogenous calcineurin inhibitor (CainC; Cain 2078–2173), which contains a calcineurin binding domain (28Lai M.M. Burnett P.E. Wolosker H. Blackshaw S. Snyder S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18325-18331Google Scholar). Shown in Fig. 4, b and c, ophiobolin A and CainC inhibited carbachol-induced SRF activation in M1-transfected cells. These results further support the involvement of Ca2+/CaM/calcineurin in M1-mediated SRF activation. Gα13QL- mediated SRF activation was also insensitive to inhibitors of mitogen-activated protein kinase, protein kinase A, protein kinase C, and calmodulin kinases (data not shown) but was inhibited by the CaM inhibitor W7 and by BAPTA/AM (Fig.5 a). However, in contrast to carbachol/M1-induced SRF activation, Gα13QL-mediated SRF activation was not inhibited by cyclosporin A and genistein (Fig.5 a). T"

TGF-β treatment of early passage finite lifespan human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs) led to an accumulation of p27Kip1 in cyclin E1-Cdk2 complexes and kinase inhibition. The requirement for p27 in the G1 arrest by TGF-β was assessed by transfection of antisense p27 (ASp27) oligonucleotides into TGF-β-treated HMECs. Despite a reduction in total and cyclin E-Cdk2 bound p27 after ASp27 transfection, HMECs remained arrested in the G1 phase. Maintenance of the G1 arrest was accompanied by increased association of the Cdk inhibitor p21WAF-1/Cip-1 and the retinoblastoma family member p130Rb2 in cyclin E1-Cdk2 complexes along with kinase inhibition. In contrast to the findings in HMECs, p27 was essential for G1 arrest by TGF-β in two tumor-derived lines. ASp27 transfection into two TGF-β-responsive, cancer-derived lines was not associated with increased compensatory binding of p21 and p130 to cyclin E1-Cdk2, and these cell lines failed to maintain G1 arrest despite the continued presence of TGF-β. Progressive cell cycle deregulation leading to impaired checkpoint controls during malignant tumor progression may alter the role of p27 from a redundant to an essential inhibitor of G1-to-S phase progression."

Murre C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 429-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1373) Google Scholar). These transcription factors homo- or heterodimerize and bind cognate promoter DNA sequences (known as E-boxes) upstream of target genes to enhance or repress transcription. The ubiquitously expressed HLH protein E12 is an alternative splice product of the E2A gene, and was first identified as an important transcriptional regulator of immunoglobulin genes (2Murre C. McCaw P.S. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 56: 777-783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1847) Google Scholar). This was later verified by targeted deletion studies, which demonstrated a requirement for E12 for the proper development of B- and T-lymphocytes (3Bain G. Maandag E.C. Izon D.J. Amsen D. Kruisbeek A.M. Weintraub B.C. Krop I. Schlissel M.S. Feeney A.J. van Roon M. van der Valk M. te Riele H.P.J. Berns A. Murre C.

Although expression studies show thatE2A is expressed in many organs in the developing embryo, including the developing nervous system (6Roberts V.J. Steenbergen R. Murre C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7583-7587Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), mice lacking theE2A gene appear only to exhibit defects in the hematopoietic compartment. Strikingly, although E2A is expressed in proliferating cells of developing forebrain, the knock-out mice exhibit no observable brain phenotype. Studies of the Drosophilaorthologue daughterless demonstrate a contribution to the proper generation of neuronal precursors, although the acquisition of neuronal fates per se appears to be dependent upon other mechanisms (7Vaessin H. Brand M. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Development. 1994; 120: 935-945PubMed Google Scholar). Although a conservation of function betweendaughterless and E12 is not implied, the true role of E12 in neurogenesis may not be observed inE2A null mice, because paralogues such as E2–2(8Zhuang Y. Cheng P. Weintraub H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2898-2905Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar) and HEB (9Zhuang Y. Barndt R.J. Pan L. Kelley R. Dai M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3340-3349Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) could contribute to functional redundancy through compensatory mechanisms. In the mammalian cortex, additional clues are available to suggest a vital role for E12during development of this organ. The gene is expressed in the proliferative neuroepithelium from the earliest stages of cortical neuron generation (at embryonic day 13 in the rat) and its binding partners (such as Mash1,neurogenin, Math2, and Id2) are known to be present (see Refs. 10Lee J.E. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1997; 7: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar and 11Neuman T. Keen A. Zuber M.X. Kristjansson G.I. Gruss P. Nornes H.O. Dev.

However, other additional partners, still to be discovered, may also interact with E12to provide additional switches for regulating stem cell production, fate determination and neuronal identity. Taking advantage of the fact that E12 function is largely dependent upon its HLH dimerizing activity, we have undertaken a screen for novel binding partners that are expressed in the developing mouse neocortex. We have identified a novel binding partner of E12 expressed in embryonic day 11.5 forebrains. This paper describes the cloning and characterization of GRIPE (GAP-related interactingprotein to E12), a novel protein with a predicted GTPase-activating protein (GAP) domain. Deletion analysis shows that GRIPE binds to the HLH region of E12, whereas immunoprecipitation confirms the interaction identified in the yeast two-hybrid assay. Cell localization experiments reveal thatGRIPE is delivered to the nucleus through its association with E12 and may be an important transcriptional regulator of downstream target genes under the control of E12. Northern analysis shows that GRIPE is expressed as an ∼8-kb mRNA, and its expression decreases during development, but persists in the adult brain. Furthermore, its expression coincides with expression of E12 mRNA during embryogenesis. Finally, studies of P19 embryocarcinoma cells induced to differentiate into neurons show an associative up-regulation of GRIPE gene expression. All animal procedures were carried out in compliance with institutional guidelines. C57BL/6 mice from an inbred colony were used for the experiments. The day of the vaginal plug was considered as embryonic day 0.5. For RNA isolation to construct the prey library, forebrain tissues (comprising telencephalon and underlying diencephalon) were dissected from embryonic day 11.5 embryos kept cold in PBS ice slurry. Full-length cDNA mouse E12(accession no. AK017617) was provided by RIKEN (Yokohama Institute, Yokohama, Japan). The plasmid pBKSII-A1(A7)HLH (accession no.D29919) encoding for amino acids 491–651 of mouse E12 gene was kindly provided by Dr. Yoshitaka Kajimoto (Osaka University School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan). The pBD-muE12 bait plasmid was cloned by ligating mouse E12 cDNA sequence (encodes amino acids 505–651) pBD-Gal4–2.1 (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Bait plasmids that encoded truncations of the E12 cDNA were cloned as follows. The plasmid pBD-muE12ΔHLH lacks the HLH domain and was cloned by inserting DNA sequence encoding for amino acids 505–571. The bait construct pBD-muE12ΔCterm was generated using a similar strategy, and contains amino acids 505–600. For expression of an N-terminal FLAG epitope, an oligonucleotide duplex was cloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 using two primers: 5′-GCCACCATGGCGCGCCAGGACTACAAGGACGACGATGACAAG-3′ and 5′-GATCCTTGTCATCGTCGTCCTTGTAGTCCTGGCGCGCCATGGTGGCGTAC-3′. This plasmid was then defined as “pcDNAFlag.” Next, a E12cDNA encoding amino acids 505–651 was amplified by PCR and cloned to produce the mammalian expression vector pcDNAFlag-muE12505–651, which expresses an N-terminal Flag-tagged E12 fusion protein product. The two-hybrid prey plasmid pAD-GRIPE comprises 3768 nucleotides of GRIPEcDNA and encodes an in-frame fusion product of 785 amino acids. The plasmid pEGFP-GRIPE701–1485 was constructed by ligating the BamHI fragment of GRIPE cDNA downstream of EGFP in the mammalian expression plasmid pEGFP-C1 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA), producing a C-terminal EGFP-GRIPE701–1485 fusion protein. Full-length E12 protein was cloned into pcDNAF, generating FLAG-E121–651, a Flag-tagged protein of 651 amino acids. All mammalian expression constructs were sequence-verified and evaluated by Western blotting. A directional two-hybrid prey cDNA library was constructed from embryonic day 11.5 forebrain mRNA, and using a Stratagene HybriZAP II cDNA/Gigapack cloning kit according to the instructions from the manufacturer. The cDNA library has a primary complexity of 4 × 106 independent clones, 85% of which contain cDNA inserts. Yeast two-hybrid interaction screens were performed with the yeast strain PJ69–4A harboring HIS3, ADE2, andβ-gal as reporter genes (12James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Library transformation experiments were carried out as follows; 40 μg of prey library plasmid was introduced into 200 ml of yeast cells, which harbor the bait plasmid pBD-muE12 (see above for cloning details), using the lithium acetate method. Liquid β-galactosidase assays were performed using standard procedures. COS-7 and HEK293T cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were plated onto 6- or 12-well plates and allowed to adhere before plasmid transfection using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) according to the instructions from the manufacturer. Briefly, 700 ng of each plasmid was incubated with 200 μl of serum-free DMEM and 12 μl of LipofectAMINE for 30 min at room temperature. Existing medium was then removed, and the plasmid/LipofectAMINE mix was applied to the cells, along with 800 μl of serum-free DMEM. The cells were incubated for 5 h at 37 °C, and then 1 ml of complete DMEM (containing fetal bovine serum,l-glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin) was gently added to each well. The cells were allowed to recover for 48 h before harvesting for protein extraction. P19 cells were differentiated with all-trans-retinoic acid as described (13Rudnicki M.A. McBurney M.W. Robertson E.J. Teratocarcinomas and Embryonic Stem Cells, a Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1987: 19-50Google Scholar) with the following modifications. After differentiation with retinoic acid for 4 days, cells were plated in tissue culture-grade dishes and maintained for 24 h. The next day, fresh medium containing 5 μg/ml cytosine arabinoside was added to the cultures and replaced every 48 h. Cells were harvested after 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 days of culture. Cells were harvested and washed in PBS at room temperature, then resuspended in 3 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (PBS containing phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, leupeptin, and pepstatin). All steps were performed at 4 °C. The cells were gently lysed and incubated for 10 min on a rotating wheel. The lysate was then cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 30 min, and the cleared supernatant incubated with 15 μl of a 50:50 slurry of protein A-Sepharose (Sigma-Aldrich Chemicals, Australia) in PBS for 1 h on a rotating wheel. Samples were then centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 1 min, and the supernatant was transferred to fresh tubes containing 1 μl of anti-FLAG antibody, 15 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads and incubated for 2 h on a rotating wheel. The beads were then washed four times with ice-cold PBS; bound complexes were harvested and separated by SDS-PAGE before electroblotting and immunodetection using the methods described below. Protein samples were fractionated on 12.5% SDS-PAGE gels and electroblotted onto Hybond C extra nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham plc, Buckinghamshire, UK). The blots were rinsed briefly in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 and incubated overnight at 4 °C in blocking buffer containing 5% dry milk powder in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 . Membranes were incubated with the appropriate primary antibodies (polyclonal anti-E12, 1:200 dilution, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA; monoclonal anti-Flag, 1:1000 dilution, Sigma Australia; anti-EGFP, 1:200 dilution, Clontech) for 1 h at room temperature. Following three washes, membranes were incubated with secondary antibodies (1:4000 dilution; horseradish peroxidase-conjugated, Silenus Australia) for 1 h at room temperature. Finally, protein bands were visualized by chemiluminescence using ECL Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Cells were washed with cold PBS and then fixed with PBS containing 2% paraformaldehyde and 0.1% Triton-X for 30 min on ice. Following three washes with ice-cold PBS (5 min for each wash), a blocking step consisting of 5% normal horse serum (in PBS) was added to the cells and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were then washed three times with cold PBS and incubated with a mouse anti-FLAG antibody (1:1000 dilution in PBS) for 1 h at room temperature. Following three washes in PBS containing 1 mm calcium chloride, a donkey anti-mouse Cy3-conjugated antibody was added for 1 h at room temperature. Following three washes with PBS, the cells were briefly incubated with a solution of bisbenzimide (1 mg/ml in PBS) to reveal cell nuclei, and then subjected a final wash before mounting and examination under fluorescence optics. Assays were performed in triplicate using transiently transfected HEK293T cells. The reporter construct, p(μE5 + μE2)6-Luc+, encodes for a luciferase reporter gene under the control of six copies of the E-box (μE5 + μE2) region of the IgH enhancer (14Ruezinsky D. Beckmann H. Kadesch T. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), upstream of a liver/bone/kidney alkaline phosphatase minimal promoter (a gift from Dr. Cornelis Murre). Transfections were performed as follows; each transfection preparation comprised 2.2 μg of DNA (made up with pcDNA3 vector) and 6 μl of LipofectAMINE. Similar (200 ng) amounts of plasmid DNA encoding full-length FLAG-E121–651, as well as p(μE5 + μE2)6-Luc+ reporter vector, were added to prescribed samples. Increasing amounts of EGFP-GRIPE701–1485 or EGFP were added as prescribed. A β-galactosidase plasmid (200 ng) was also included in all samples to control for transfection efficiency. Following transfection, cells were lysed with GloLysis buffer (Promega, Madison, WI) and diluted before addition of an equal volume of Bright-Glo luciferase assay reagent (Promega). Chemiluminescence was measured through use of a Topcount scintillation counter (Packard Instrument Co., Meriden, CT), whereas β-galactosidase activity was measured in a liquid O-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside assay. Representative samples from each preparation were subjected to Western analysis to detect FLAG-E121–651, as well as EGFP-GRIPE701–1485or EGFP proteins in the lysate. These Western blots were stained with Ponceau red to confirm equal loading. All luciferase activity measurements are represented as a ratio of β-galactosidase activity;error bars in figures represent S.E. of triplicate experiments. Total RNAs were extracted using standard methods (15Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63088) Google Scholar), and poly(A)+ RNA was prepared by using the MESSAGEMAKER mRNA isolation system (Invitrogen). Northern analysis was performed using standard protocols. Complementary DNA probes were labeled with [32P]dCTP using a standard random-prime labeling method. Quantitation of mRNA signals was carried out as follows. Signals were normalized with 18 S rRNA and multiplied by 100.In situ hybridization experiments were performed on fresh-frozen 10-μm sections with digoxigenin-conjugated RNA probes. The digoxigenin signals were detected using Fabs coupled to alkaline phosphatase and nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany). Το isolate the 5′ DNA sequence of GRIPE, rapid amplification o f cDNA ends PCR was carried out, using total RNA template prepared from day 11.5 embryonic heads and the 5′/3′ rapid amplification o f cDNA ends kit according to the instructions from the manufacturer. To clarify the role of ubiquitously expressed HLH proteins in neurogenesis, a yeast two-hybrid interaction screen was employed to identify binding partners to the HLH protein E12. To do this, a cDNA fragment encoding amino acids 505–651 of mouse E12 (which encompasses the entire HLH domain) was used as a bait. Screening of 2.8 × 106 primary transformants from an embryonic day 11.5 forebrain library resulted in the cloning of genes known to be binding partners of E12, including Mash1 (16Guillemot F. Joyner A.L. Mech. Dev. 1993; 42: 171-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar),Id2 (17Christy B.A. Sanders L.K. Lau L.F. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The recovery of these cognate binding partners indicates biochemical functionality of theE12 bait, and that dimerization of these proteins may play physiological roles as early as embryonic day 11.5 in the forebrain. Control experiments were also conducted to exclude autoactivation of reporter genes (using SV40 prey, a non-dimerizing partner of the HLH domain) (Table I, row 1).Table ICloning of binding partners to E12 using a yeast two-hybrid interaction screenBaitPrey−his, −adeβ-Galactosidase activity1muE12SV40−−2muE12Mash1+++++3muE12Ubc9++4muE12Id2++5muE12GRIPE++++++6p53GRIPE−−Control experiments, using the spurious binding partner SV40, indicate that the E12 bait construct per se does not activate the reporter genes (row 1).

GRIPE (row 5) is a novel 3.8-kb cDNA that interacts with E12 and does not spuriously activate the yeast reporter genes in the presence of a spurious bait such as p53 (row 6). Open table in a new tab Control experiments, using the spurious binding partner SV40, indicate that the E12 bait construct per se does not activate the reporter genes (row 1). Binding partners to E12 include Mash1 (row 2), Id2 (row 3), and Ubc9 (row 4). GRIPE (row 5) is a novel 3.8-kb cDNA that interacts with E12 and does not spuriously activate the yeast reporter genes in the presence of a spurious bait such as p53 (row 6). In addition, a novel 3.8-kb cDNA, which we call GRIPE, was also recovered from the screen (Table I, row 5). This cDNA encodes a 785-amino acid protein, which requires the E12 bait construct for the survival of these double-transfected yeast in selection media, as well as the expression of the lacZ reporter gene (TableI, row 5). Control experiments using the GRIPE prey plasmid alone (with a p53 bait) did not cause activation of the yeast reporter genes, confirming a requirement by GRIPE for E12 binding (Table I, row 6). The entire coding sequence for GRIPE spans 5.8 kb, and encodes a 1485-amino acid polypeptide, shown in Fig.1 A. Interrogation of the Conserved Domain Data Base (20Wheeler D.L. Church D.M. Lash A.E. Leipe D.D. Madden T.L. Pontius J.U. Schuler G.D. Schriml L.M. Tatusova T.A. Wagner L. Rapp B.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 11-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) with the protein sequence forGRIPE revealed a putative leucine zipper (boxed), as well as a Rap/Ran GAP domain in its C terminus (shaded gray). Although its true GTPase activating potential remains to be tested, amino acid sequences for putative arginine fingers of the GAP domain are in good correspondence with those observed in other known GAP proteins such as RapGAP (accession no. P47736), mouse tuberin (accession no. AAA86901), and SPA-1 (accession no. BAA22197). These arginine fingers are important features for the proper orientation and binding of small G-proteins to facilitate their hydrolysis of bound GTP (21Scheffzek K. Ahmadian M.R. Wittinghofer A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 257-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Orthologues of tuberin, RapGAP, and SPA-1 from all recorded species have been assigned to the conserved domain pfam02145, and GRIPE may be a new member of this family of proteins which influence G-protein signaling (Fig. 1 B). Nucleotide homology searches using BLASTN (22Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (69707) Google Scholar) also indicated that GRIPE is highly homologous to two rat cDNA fragments called Tulip-1(AAB97075) and Tulip-2 (AAB97076). Tulip-1 and -2 differ only by 140 nt in their 3′ ends and represent partially cloned DNA sequences that overlap with the 3′ region (beginning at nt 3961) of GRIPE. To investigate the possibility that multiple isoforms of GRIPE may also exist in the mouse, a reverse transcriptase-PCR experiment was designed to generate clearly defined products. Results of this experiment indicated that GRIPE is the only transcript found in all mice tissues surveyed (data not shown). GRIPE is located on chromosome 12 in the mouse. The association ofGRIPE with E12 was further investigated using the yeast two-hybrid interaction assay. Deletion constructs ofE12 and GRIPE were generated to fine-map their interacting domains. As shown in TableII, although the E12505–651 binds GRIPE701–1485 (row 1), the C-terminal domain adjacent to the helix-loop-helix region is dispensable for this interaction (row 2). More significantly, disruption of the second helix of the HLH domain of E12 prevents binding (row 3). This region is important for the stability of heterodimers of E12 to other HLH proteins such as MyoD (23Shirakata M. Friedman F.K. Wei Q. Paterson B.M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2456-2470Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 24Shirakata M. Paterson B.M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1766-1772Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and strongly suggests that GRIPE may disrupt HLH dimer formation of E12 with other proteins. Next, truncated mutants of the GRIPEprey were evaluated for interaction with E12505–651 bait. All mutants of GRIPE, however, failed to demonstrate binding; an N-terminal deletion mutant GRIPE933–1485 (row 4) failed to activate reporter genes in the presence of the E12505–651 bait. Similarly, the C-terminal mutant GRIPE701–932 (row 5) demonstrated a lack of reporter gene expression. To rule out the possibility that GRIPE may bind E12 within a domain that was disrupted in these two preys, a mutant GRIPE701–1458 was constructed, which encoded a small 27-amino acid deletion in the C terminus. This prey construct, however, also failed to bind E12 (row 6). In light of these observations, it is concluded that, within the context of the yeast two-hybrid assay, GRIPE701–1485 comprises the minimal domain that binds E12.Table IIGRIPE701–1485 binds to the helix-loop-helix domain of E12, as demonstrated using a yeast two-hybrid interaction assay (row 1)Truncated E12 baits were prepared as described in the methods section under “plasmid constructions.” The letter “b” denotes the basic amino acid region responsible for contacting DNA, while H1 (helix 1), L (loop), and H2 (helix 2) denote the helix-loop-helix domain of E12. Although the C terminus ofE12 is dispensible for bindingGRIPE 701–1485 (row 2), an intact helix 2 and loop is required (row 3). All deletion constructs of GRIPE prey failed to bind E12 505–651 (row 4–6). Open table in a new tab Truncated E12 baits were prepared as described in the methods section under “plasmid constructions.” The letter “b” denotes the basic amino acid region responsible for contacting DNA, while H1 (helix 1), L (loop), and H2 (helix 2) denote the helix-loop-helix domain of E12. Although the C terminus ofE12 is dispensible for bindingGRIPE 701–1485 (row 2), an intact helix 2 and loop is required (row 3). All deletion constructs of GRIPE prey failed to bind E12 505–651 (row 4–6). To confirm the interaction between E12 and GRIPE observed in the yeast two-hybrid interaction assay, a co-immunoprecipitation experiment was conducted. Because a native antibody to GRIPE was not available, these experiments were carried out using C-terminal fusion of GRIPE protein to EGFP. Similarly, a Flag epitope-tagged E12505–651 was constructed for this purpose. As shown in Fig. 2 A, E12505–651 protein is immunoprecipitated with the EGFP-GRIPE701–1485 fusion protein (lane 1), but not with EGFP protein alone (lane 2). To rule out the possibility that band intensities are caused by differences in protein loading, Western blots were also performed using antibodies to Flag and EGFP epitopes (Fig. 2,B and C). The results confirmed expression of all proteins tested (Fig. 2, B (arrowhead) andC (arrowhead and arrow)). Taken together, these results indicate that GRIPE is a bona fidebinding partner to E12. To further demonstrate an interaction betweenGRIPE and E12, experiments were devised to observe the cellular localization of expressed full-length E121–651 and EGFP-GRIPE701–1485 in HEK293T cells. Cells transfected with EGFP alone showed widespread expression in both cytoplasm and nucleus (Fig.3 A, arrow). When a EGFP-GRIPE701–1485 expression plasmid was introduced, the distribution of the fusion protein, revealed by EGFP fluorescence, was predominantly in the cytoplasmic compartment (Fig. 3 B,arrow), with few cells (<1%) exhibiting pancellular distribution (Fig. 3 B, arrowhead). Correspondingly, introduction of full-length E12 alone into these cells resulted in the expected nuclear localization of this protein (Fig.3 C, arrows). Double transfection of EGFP-GRIPE701–1485 and E121–651 (with EGFP and Flag epitopes, respectively) revealed co-localization of both proteins in cell nuclei (Fig. 3, D–F). These results suggest that EGFP-GRIPE701–1485, which is normally found in the cytoplasm, has the capability to be imported into the nucleus upon binding to full-length E12. Further, it implies thatGRIPE may affect E12 signaling in the nucleus. Following from the observations that E121–651 could be a molecular chaperone for GRIPE, it remains to be tested whether or notGRIPE might interfere with the transcriptional activity ofE12 following upon nuclear entry. To test this, an expression assay was designed to report on the effect of GRIPE onE12-dependent luciferase activity. The promoter element of this luciferase plasmid, p(μE5 + μE2)6-Luc+, encodes for six tandem repeats of the (μE5 + μE2) region of the IgH promoter (14Ruezinsky D. Beckmann H. Kadesch T. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). This region contains several E-boxes and is recognized and bound by E12 to up-regulate target gene expression (14Ruezinsky D. Beckmann H. Kadesch T. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Insignificant luciferase activity was detectable in cells transfected with p(μE5 + μE2)6-Luc+ alone (Fig.4, lane 1), and co-transfection of EGFP 701–1485 orEGFP with this construct did not affect reporter gene expression (data not shown). However, transfection of E12with p(μE5 + μE2)6-Luc+ resulted in high levels of luciferase activity (lane 2). Introduction of increasing amounts of EGFP-GRIPE701–1485 resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in luciferase gene expression byE12 (lanes 3–6). This reduction is not attributable to differences in E12 protein expression in each preparation, as detected by Western analysis. To control for the possibility that EGFP may be responsible for this reduction in luciferase activity, parallel experiments with increasing amounts of EGFP were performed and the results showed a negligible affect on E12-dependent luciferase expression (lanes 6 and 7). Taken together, these observations indicate that GRIPE can behave as a negative regulator of E12- dependent target gene transcription. Northern analysis r"
https://openalex.org/W1978992130,"GAGA factor is involved in many nuclear transactions, notably in transcription as an activator inDrosophila. The genomic region corresponding to theTrl promoter has been obtained, and a minimal version of a fully active Trl promoter has been defined using transient transfection assays in S2 cells. DNase I footprinting analysis has shown that this region contains multiple GAGA binding sites, suggesting a potential regulatory role of GAGA on its own promoter. The study shows that GAGA down-regulates Trl expression. The repression does not depend on the GAGA isoform, but binding to DNA is absolutely required. A fragment of the Trl promoter can mediate repression to a heterologous promoter only upon GAGA overexpression in transiently transfected S2 cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis of S2 cells confirmed that GAGA factors are bound to the Trl promoter over a region of 1.4 kbp. Using a double-stranded RNA interference approach, we show that endogenous GAGA factors limit Trl expression in S2 cells. Our results open the possibility of observing similar GAGA repressive effects on other promoters.

Gausz J. Galloni M. Reuter G. Gyurkovics H. Karch F. Nature. 1994; 371: 806-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). At least two isoforms, GAGA519 and GAGA581, are known to be produced by alternative splicing (2Benyajati C. Mueller L., Xu, N. Pappano M. Gao J. Mosammaparast M. Conklin D. Granok H. Craig C. Elgin S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3345-3353Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), and both the sequence of the isoforms and their splicing patterns are highly conserved between Drosophila melanogaster and the distant species Drosophila virilis (3Linterman K.-G. Roth G.E. King-Jones K. Korge G. Lehmann M. Dev. Genes Evol. 1998; 208: 447-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The GAGA factors present an overall modular structure that is formed by an N-terminal BTB/POZ domain involved in protein oligomerization (4Espinás M.L. Jiménez-Garcı́a E. Vaquero A. Canudas S.

Bernuês, submitted for publication. There is some evidence that the Q-domain may also be involved in GAGA aggregation (12Agianian B. Leonard K. Bonte E. Van der Zandt H. Becker P.B. Tucker P.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 527-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 13Wilkins R.C. Lis J.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 515-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Between the POZ/BTB domain and the DNA-binding domain there is a fourth domain, that will be referred to here as the X-domain, about 200 amino acids long and of unknown structure and properties. To date, both isoforms have been found to be rather equivalent, and have largely overlapping functions in transgenic flies although some differences have been noticed (11Greenberg A.J. Schedl P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8565-8574Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). GAGA binds to DNA sequences with a consensus (GAGAG) (7Omichinski J.G. Pedone P.V. Felsenfeld G. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 122-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), but neither a strict consensus nor a single site is efficient enough for GAGA binding. In fact, a GAG or CTC trinucleotide sequence has been described as being sufficient for specific binding (8Wilkins R.C. Lis J.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2672-2678Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). However, as noted by others (14Soeller W.C., Oh, C.E. Kornberg T.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7961-7970Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), GAGA binding sites on natural promoters show a clear tendency to cluster and give rise to strong composite GAGA binding sites. This is in agreement with the finding that GAGA is oligomeric and can interact with specific sequences that are variably spaced by other irrelevant DNA sequences that are neither recognized nor bound (4Espinás M.L.

Hajibagueri Verrijzer C.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 698-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The need for the clustering of GAGA binding sites apparently arises from the fact that GAGA activation is very weak (if not negligible) when only single or double sites are present (4Espinás M.L. Jiménez-Garcı́a E. Vaquero A. Canudas S. Bernués J. Azorı́n F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16461-16469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Since its discovery, GAGA was counted as a transcription activation factor because, upon binding to (GA)n-rich sequences, it stimulated transcription of genes such as Ultrabithorax (Ubx) and engrailed (en) (15Biggin M.D. Tjian R. Cell. 1988; 53: 699-711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 16Soeller W.C. Poole S.J. Kornberg T. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 68-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). This role has frequently been reported for many other promoters, either in vitro and/orin vivo, including actin 5C, krüppel, fushi-tarazu (ftz), etc. (recapitulated in Ref. 17Wilkins R.C. Lis J.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3963-3968Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, several early observations suggested that GAGA was a complex nuclear factor. For instance, unexpectedly, during mitosis GAGA remains bound to chromatin, whereas transcription factors are usually displaced (18Raff J.W. Kellum R. Alberts B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5977-5983Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar,19Platero J.S. Csink A.K. Quintanilla A. Henikoff S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 140: 1297-1306Crossref Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Also, at metaphase GAGA is redirected from its interphasic locations on the promoters (20Granok H. Leibovitch B.A. Shaffer C.D. Elgin S.C.R. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 238-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 21Espinás M.L. Canudas S. Fanti L. Pimpinelli S. Casanova J. Azorı́n F. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 253-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 22Tsukiyama T. Becker P.B. Wu C. Nature. 1994; 367: 525-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar) to heterochromatic GA-rich regions located in the vicinity of Drosophila centromeres (18Raff J.W. Kellum R. Alberts B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5977-5983Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 19Platero J.S. Csink A.K. Quintanilla A. Henikoff S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 140: 1297-1306Crossref Scopus (120) Google Scholar). These features appear to be common to both GAGA isoforms (2Benyajati C. Mueller L., Xu, N. Pappano M. Gao J. Mosammaparast M. Conklin D. Granok H. Craig C. Elgin S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3345-3353Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 11Greenberg A.J. Schedl P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8565-8574Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). This mitotic location might explain the phenotypes observed for the hypomorphic mutant (Trl13C), which include serious defects on the synchrony in cleavage cycles, failure in chromosome condensation, abnormal chromosome segregation, and chromosome fragmentation (23Bhat K.M. Farkas G. Karch F. Gyurkovics H. Gausz J. Schedl P. Development. 1996; 122: 1113-1124Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Other explanations invoke the evidence that GAGA co-operates with chromatin remodeling machines like NURF2 to open several promoters (22Tsukiyama T. Becker P.B. Wu C. Nature. 1994; 367: 525-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar, 24Okada M. Hirose S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2455-2461Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Also GAGA and ISWI, the catalytic subunit shared by several chromatin remodeling complexes, present some limited co-localization at some loci on polytenic chromosomes but do not co-localize at all on mitotic chromosomes (25Deuring R. Fanti L. Armstrong J.A. Sarte M. Papoulas O. Prestel M. Daubresse G. Verardo M. Moseley S.L. Berloco M. Tsukiyama T., Wu, C. Pimpinelli S. Tamkun J.W. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 355-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Recently, a direct interaction has been observed between GAGA and the largest NURF subunit, NURF301. The interaction involves two regions in NURF301 and a GAGA region around the DNA binding domain. On the other hand, the chromatin remodeling activity and the stimulatory activity of GAGA have been shown to be independent in transgenic flies (26Pile L.A. Cartwright I.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1398-1404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The existence of GAGA binding sites on several Polycomb-responsive elements (PRE) and its co-localization with some proteins of the Polycomb group also indicates a connection of GAGA with gene silencing (27Strutt H. Cavalli G. Paro R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3621-3632Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 28Horard B. Tatout C. Poux S. Pirrotta V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3187-3197Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The interaction of GAGA with SAP18, a Sin3-associated polypeptide, and the presence of GAGA in a complex containing the RPD3 deacetylase and the Polycomb group factors, polyhomeotic and posterior sex combs, indirectly suggested a connection with repression too (21Espinás M.L. Canudas S. Fanti L. Pimpinelli S. Casanova J. Azorı́n F. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 253-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 29Poux S. Melfi R. Pirrotta V. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). A functional requirement for both GAGA and pleiohomeotic has been established to account for the silencing activity of the iab-7 PRE and the MCP silencer of Abdominal-B (30Busturia A. Lloyd A. Bejarano F. Zavortink M. Sakonju S. Development. 2001; 128: 2163-2173PubMed Google Scholar, 31Mishra R.K. Mihaly J. Barges S. Spierer A. Karch F. Hagstrom K. Schweinsberg S.E. Schedl P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1311-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Here, we have analyzed the Trl promoter and provide direct evidence that both GAGA isoforms can mediate repression of its own promoter. Repression is promoter-specific and requires GAGA DNA binding activity, whereas transactivation and oligomerization domains are dispensable. The sequences corresponding to the 5′ upstream region to the Trl coding sequence and released in Flybase before the whole Drosophila genome was available were used to isolate the sequences putatively corresponding to theTrl promoter. An ∼4.3 kbp fragment was PCR-amplified from P1 clone ds01921 (kindly provided by the European DrosophilaGenome Project) using 5′-TAC ATG GAT AAG ATT CTG ACG G-3′ and 5′-GGG AGG CGG CGC ACA GG-3′ as primers and cloned into pGEM-T (Promega). This fragment comprised about 3.5 kbp of putative promoter region, the three 5′ end sequences of the cDNAs reported previously (2Benyajati C. Mueller L., Xu, N. Pappano M. Gao J. Mosammaparast M. Conklin D. Granok H. Craig C. Elgin S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3345-3353Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), and the first 168 bp of the GAGA coding sequence. Automated sequencing exactly confirmed the genomic sequence deposited later on by Celera Genomics. For transfection assays, subclones were generated using PCR in a way that coding sequences were omitted while leaving intact a long 5′-UTR. Promoter deletions were introduced either by restriction at unique sites whenever possible or by PCR with specific primers. All of them were inserted between MluI and HindIII sites in pGL3 vector (Promega). The eve-luciferase reporter was obtained by inserting a 1.8-kbp fragment of the eve promoter that directs the embryonic expression of stripe 2 in the embryo (from position −1759 to +102; kindly provided by Dr. M. Levine, University of California, Berkeley) into pGL3 vector (Promega). Constructs for expressing GAGA isoforms and mutants in S2 cells were all prepared using Act5PPA vector. Constructs for GAGA519, GAGAΔQ, GAGAΔQ-VP16, and GAL4BD have already been described (9Vaquero A. Espinás M.L. Azorı́n F. Bernués J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19461-19468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The expression construct for GAGA581 was generated by PCR cloning the C terminus of GAGA581 and replacing the C-terminal region of GAGA519 construct. The expression construct for GAGAΔPOZ was generated by subcloning the previously prepared ΔPOZ122 construct into Act5PPA vector (4Espinás M.L. Jiménez-Garcı́a E. Vaquero A. Canudas S. Bernués J. Azorı́n F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16461-16469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The construct expressing the mutated DNA binding domain (GAGA519H361P) was generated by PCR across the DNA binding domain using appropriate primers that introduced a His-361→Pro change at the zinc-finger. This mutant was initially prepared in a bacterial expression vector (pET14b) and then subcloned into Act5PPA for expression in S2 cells. Constructs containing the CMV promoter and a luciferase reporter gene were fused to fragments FI, FII, FII+FIII, FIII, FIV, and FV derived from the Trl promoter using either an MluI site, located upstream of the CMV promoter, for the FI to FIII fragments or aHindIII site, located downstream of the CMV promoter, for fragments FIV and FV, in an attempt to mimic as much as possible the relative location of the Trl-derived fragments with respect to the transcription start sites. S2 cells were grown and transfected as described (9Vaquero A. Espinás M.L. Azorı́n F. Bernués J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19461-19468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Each transfection included 3 μg of CMV-β-galactosidase, variable amounts of reporter constructs fused to the luciferase gene and expression vectors driven by the actin 5C promoter of Drosophila, and 7 μg of pGL3 vector (Promega). The final amount of DNA was adjusted to 20 μg by the addition of Act5PPA empty vector. After 48 h of incubation with the DNA, cell lysates were prepared according to manufacturer's instructions. Luciferase and β-galactosidase activities to correct for transfection efficiency were determined using commercial kits (Promega and Roche Molecular Biochemicals, respectively). Results for each condition represent the average of three to five independent experiments, each performed in duplicate. The portion of theTrl promoter to be studied was divided into five different regions and subcloned into pBS(−) (Stratagene). These five regions contained sequences between positions −679/−462, −462/−204, −204/−49, −49/+347, and +347/+737, respectively, according to the numbering system indicated in Fig. 3 A. These fragments were end-labeled and purified on native polyacrylamide gels following standard protocols. Recombinant GAGA factor used in these experiments corresponded to GAGA519 and was expressed and purified in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) as described (32Tsukiyama T. Wu C. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 274: 291-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). DNase I footprinting reactions were carried out as described (33Jiménez-Garcı́a E. Vaquero A. Espinás M.L. Soliva R. Orozco M. Bernués J. Azorı́n F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24640-24648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). An RNase protection analysis was performed using the Direct Protect Lysate RPA kit following the manufacturer's instructions (Ambion). Total RNA was isolated from 4 × 107 Drosophila S2 cells, and for analysis of Trl transcripts, 25–65 μg of total RNA was mixed with 1 × 104 cpm of 32P-labeled antisense riboprobes. Protected RNAs were analyzed on denaturing 5% polyacrylamide gels containing 8 m urea. Gels were dried, exposed at −80 °C for 24 h with intensifier screens, and developed. Uniformly radiolabeled RNA probes R1 (from position −49 to +347) and R2 (from position +347 to +737) were generated by in vitro transcription using either T3 (for R1) or T7 (for R2) RNA polymerases from the respective plasmids bearing these sequences in pBS(−). Riboprobes were purified on polyacrylamide gels. Drosophila Schneider S2 cells were cross-linked and chromatin-immunoprecipitated as described (34Orlando V. Strutt H. Paro R. Methods: A Companion to Methods in Enzymology. 1997; 11: 205-214Crossref Scopus (512) Google Scholar) with the modification in the PCR amplification protocol subsequently described (35Cavalli G. Orlando V. Paro R. Bickmore W.A. Chromosome Structural Analysis: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1999: 20-37Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibody raised in rabbits against bacterial expressed GAGA519 isoform was affinity-purified using standard protocols. DNA amplified from immunoprecipitations was analyzed by slot-blot hybridization. Radiolabeled DNA probes corresponding to regions −679/−462 (FI), −462/−204 (FII), −204/−49 (FIII), −49/+347 (FIV), and +347/+737 (FV) were prepared using the Ready-to-Go labeling kit (Amersham Biosciences). Hybridizations were carried out following standard protocols. Blots were exposed at −80 °C, and films were quantified using a laser microdensitometer (Amersham Biosciences). All of the results were verified to be in the linear response range as indicated by comparison with corresponding sets of dilution input standards (not shown). To generate the dsRNA anEcoRI-BamHI fragment of GAGA (718 bp long) encoding a protein sequence common to both isoforms of GAGA and including most of the POZ/BTB domain and part of the adjacent sequence was subcloned into pBS(−). The RNAs were prepared by in vitro transcription as described above and resuspended in water. To prepare dsRNAs equimolar amounts of sense and antisense RNAs were mixed, heated for 5 min at 90 °C, cooled down slowly to room temperature, and stored at −20 °C until use. For transient transfection assays, dsRNA (0.5 μg to 5 μg) was added to the transfection mix and the assays proceeded as described. Luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were assayed after 48 or 72 h as described above. A control dsRNA for the β-galactosidase mRNA was similarly prepared from a lacZSstI-PvuII fragment about 0.7 kbp long cloned into pBS(−). A 4.2-kbp DNA fragment was obtained by PCR amplification from P1 clone ds01921 (obtained from the European Drosophila Genome Project) using primers specific for the Trl gene. The complete sequence was fully consistent with the sequence deposited by Celera Genomics in the Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project Database. The data available suggested the existence of at least three different transcription start sites according to the different 5′ ends of the cDNAs isolated so far (2Benyajati C. Mueller L., Xu, N. Pappano M. Gao J. Mosammaparast M. Conklin D. Granok H. Craig C. Elgin S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3345-3353Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Here, we assigned position +1 to the hypothetical start site the most upstream from the coding sequence. Our clone obtained contained about 0.73 kbp of the 5′-UTR sequence of theTrl gene and ∼3.4 kbp of the upstream sequence. The study of the Trl promoter elements included transient transfection in Schneider's S2 cell line. As a first step,Trl transcription start sites used in S2 cells were mapped. RNase protection assays (RPA) with total RNA from S2 cells revealed at least three start sites (Fig.1 B). From their positions with respect to the coding sequence, the start sites were named, distal, intermediate, and proximal. These three sites reasonably correspond to the three 5′ cDNA ends already described (2Benyajati C. Mueller L., Xu, N. Pappano M. Gao J. Mosammaparast M. Conklin D. Granok H. Craig C. Elgin S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3345-3353Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Other start sites may exist, because an intense band appeared in the RPA analysis a few nucleotides upstream of the position of the proximal start site (*1, Fig. 1, A and B, left panel). Also, another band appeared some 50 nucleotides upstream of the distal site (*2, Fig. 1, A andB, right panel), which is clearly different from the undigested R1 probe. From the previously reported results, the proximal start site accounts for most of the GAGA519isoform and the distal start site for the GAGA581 isoform in embryos (2Benyajati C. Mueller L., Xu, N. Pappano M. Gao J. Mosammaparast M. Conklin D. Granok H. Craig C. Elgin S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3345-3353Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In S2 cells, because the RPA technique is quantitative, we observed that the proximal start site is also the most frequently used, as indicated by the high intensity of the protected band. The Trl promoter fragment described above was linked to a luciferase reporter gene and studied in S2 cells. Transcriptional activity from this construct reached values above 2600-fold with respect to empty pGL3 vector and was taken as 100% of Trlpromoter activity in our analysis (not shown). A deletion analysis of the Trl promoter showed that nearly full activity could be observed in serial 5′ deletions from position −3470 down to position −345 (Fig. 2). Deletion to position −270 resulted in a drop of about 50% of the promoter activity. Deletion to position −204 could only support about 20% of total activity, and activity was lost completely by deletion to position −49. Deletion of 400 bp at the 3′ end of the fragment resulted in about 50% of total activity. Because this deletion removed the proximal start site, it is reasonable to assume that the two other sites were functional and accounting for reasonable levels of mRNAs. We concluded that the Trl promoter in S2 cells is small and extends to about position −345. Computer analysis of the promoter sequence highlighted several potential GAGA factor sites and some potential binding sites for other regulatory proteins (not shown). Because GAGA binds to sequences showing a considerable degree of heterogeneity and a good binding site has been shown to have composite nature rather than a single linear sequence (4Espinás M.L.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2672-2678Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), a DNase I footprinting analysis using recombinant GAGA519 factor was performed. Because full promoter activity in S2 cells was confined to position −345, we limited our assay to a slightly larger fragment (up to position −680) and included the 737 bp of the 5′-UTR. Because the region to be analyzed was rather long (∼1.4 kbp), it was subdivided by convenience into five fragments (denoted as FI to FV, Fig. 3 A) covering the entire length of the region studied. Fig. 3 Bshows that a large number of GAGA sites were present on theTrl promoter (see Fig. 3 A for a general scheme and summary of results). Especially rich in GAGA binding sites were regions FII, FIV, and FV with 5, 8, and 8 sites, whereas regions FI and FIII showed only 2 and 3 sites, respectively. The relative affinities of the binding sites were not identical, and some showed a high affinity (e.g. FIII no. 1, FIV nos. 6 and 7, and FV nos. 6, 7, and 8), whereas others were of low affinity (e.g. FII no.1, FIV nos. 1 and 2, FV nos. 1 and 3, and results not shown). These differences suggest that the relative occupancies of the sites could be different in vivo. Some hypersensitive sites that might suggest a stressed DNA conformation upon GAGA binding were also noted (indicated by an asterisk in Fig. 3 B). GAGA factor has always been regarded as an activator because in the fly it stimulates the transcriptional activity of genes under its control (e.g. ftz, en, Ubx, etc.) (1Farkas G. Gausz J. Galloni M. Reuter G. Gyurkovics H. Karch F. Nature. 1994; 371: 806-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 11Greenberg A.J. Schedl P. Mol. Cell.

GAGA also stimulates transcription of many reporter genes when assayed using transient transfection in Drosophila cell lines (2Benyajati C. Mueller L., Xu, N. Pappano M. Gao J. Mosammaparast M.

Chem. 2000; 275: 1398-1404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). From our results, an appealing possibility was that GAGA could regulate the expression of its own promoter. This prospect was studied by performing transient transfection experiments in which GAGA factors were overexpressed and their activity on the Trl promoter analyzed. Unexpectedly, overexpression of either GAGA519 or GAGA581resulted in a strong repression of the Trl promoter. Repression was efficient and dose-dependent (Fig.4 A), reaching a minimal level of activity at about 15% with respect to controls without GAGA overexpression. Overexpression of larger amounts of GAGA factor did not result in further repression (results not shown). On the contrary, expression of increasing amounts of GAGA519 stimulated transcription of the eve stripe 2 promoter up to ∼15-fold in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4 B). Overexpression of an unrelated factor, the yeast GAL4BD, showed no effect on the activity of either promoter at any dose (Fig.5 and results not shown).Figure 5The repressive effect of GAGA onTrl is dependent on its DNA binding activity.Several GAGA mutants (4 μg each) as outlined in the lower panel were tested for their activity on the long promoter fragment of Trl (−3470 to +737). Full activity (100%) was assigned to the reporter under no overexpression of any protein.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) RNA interference assays were performed to assess that the stimulation of eve and the repression of Trl were due to GAGA overexpression. Both repression of Trl (Fig. 3,light gray columns) as well as stimulation of eve(dark gray columns) were efficiently abolished by co-transfection of constructs and specific RNAiGAGA at low doses (Fig. 4 C). At the highest dose, Trlexpression was stimulated ∼2-fold above the starting level, clearly suggesting a GAGA-mediated down-regulation of Trl promoter even in the absence of expressed GAGA (Fig. 4 C, compare columns at 0 and 5 μg of RNAiGAGA; see also Fig.7 B). As expected, β-galactosidase activity was not affected by co-transfection of RNAiGAGA, and vice versa, co-transfection of the RNAiβ-gal did not affect luciferase levels"
https://openalex.org/W2082683386,"To ensure fidelity in genome duplication, eukaryotes restrict DNA synthesis to once every cell division by a cascade of regulated steps. Central to this cascade is the periodic assembly of the hexameric MCM2–7 complex at replication origins. However, in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, only a fraction of each MCM protein is able to assemble into hexamers and associate with replication origins during M phase, suggesting that MCM complex assembly and recruitment may be regulated post-translationally. Here we show that a small fraction of Mcm3p is polyubiquitinated at the onset of MCM complex assembly. Reducing the rate of ubiquitination by<i>uba1-165</i>, a suppressor of <i>mcm3-10</i>, restored the interaction of Mcm3-10p with subunits of the MCM complex and its recruitment to the replication origin. Possible roles for ubiquitinated Mcm3p in the assembly of the MCM complex at replication origins are discussed."

To determine the role of the highly conserved C-terminal acidic residues glutamate 487 (Glu487) and glutamate 500 (Glu500) on catalytic activity in rat liver CPTII, we separately mutated these residues to alanine, aspartate, or lysine, and the effect of the mutations on CPTII activity was determined in theEscherichia coli-expressed mutants. Substitution of Glu487 with alanine, aspartate, or lysine resulted in almost complete loss in CPTII activity. Because a conservative substitution mutation of this residue, Glu487 with aspartate (E487D), resulted in a 97% loss in activity, we predicted that Glu487 would be at the active-site pocket of CPTII. The substantial loss in CPTII activity observed with the E487K mutant, along with the previously reported loss in activity observed in a child with a CPTII deficiency disease, establishes that Glu487 is crucial for maintaining the configuration of the liver isoform of the CPTII active site. Substitution of the conserved Glu500 in CPTII with alanine or aspartate reduced theV max for both substrates, suggesting that Glu500 may be important in stabilization of the enzyme-substrate complex. A conservative substitution of Glu500 to aspartate resulted in a significant decrease in the V max for the substrates. Thus, Glu500 may play a role in substrate binding and catalysis.

Mammalian mitochondrial membranes express two active but distinct carnitine palmitoyltransferases (CPTI and CPTII), a malonyl CoA-sensitive, detergent-labile CPTI, and a malonyl-CoA-insensitive, detergent-stable CPTII. CPTI is an integral membrane enzyme located on the outer mitochondrial membrane, and CPTII is a membrane-associated enzyme loosely bound to the matrix side of the inner mitochondrial membrane. A current model for the membrane topology of CPTI predicts exposure of the N- and C-terminal domains crucial for activity and malonyl-CoA sensitivity on the cytosolic side of the outer mitochondrial membrane (3Fraser F. Corstorphine C.G. Zammit V.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 711-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). As an enzyme that catalyzes the rate-limiting step in fatty acid oxidation, CPTI is tightly regulated by its physiologic inhibitor, malonyl-CoA, the first intermediate in fatty acid synthesis (1Bieber L.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 261-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar, 2McGarry J.D. Brown N.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (1354) Google Scholar). This is an important regulatory mechanism in fatty acid metabolism and suggests coordinated control of fatty acid oxidation and synthesis.

The cDNA sequences predicted proteins of 658 amino acid residues (71 kDa) that had 82 and 85% identity at the amino acid and nucleotide levels, respectively. Because the size of the mRNA in different rat tissues was identical, CPTII appears to be the product of a single gene that is expressed uniformly in every tissue examined thus far (2McGarry J.D. Brown N.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (1354) Google Scholar).

With the S. cerevisiae-expressed CPTII, mutations of the conserved residues His372, Asp376, and Asp464 to alanine resulted in complete loss of CPTII activity, suggesting that these residues may be required for catalysis (14Brown N.F.

We and others hypothesize that the reaction catalyzed by CPTI and CPTII in the direction of palmitoylcarnitine formation at the active site pocket involves deprotonation of the hydroxyl group of carnitine by a catalytic base (α-proton abstraction by His, Glu, or Gln) and attack by the resultant oxyanion at the carbonyl of the thioester of palmitoyl-CoA to generate palmitoylcarnitine and free CoA (14Brown N.F.

Carnitine palmitoyltransferase deficiencies are common disorders of mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation. Rare human genetic defects in fatty acid oxidation specifically ascribed to CPTI, CPTII, and the carnitine translocase have been reported (19Bonnefont J.P. Demaugre F. Prip-Buus C. Saudubray J.M.

Recently, an E487K missense mutation in conjunction with S113L was reported in a child with CPTII deficiency characterized by recurrent episodes of myalgia and myoglobinuria triggered by fever (26Bruno C.

A comprehensive structure-function study of the CPTII enzyme is necessary for a better understanding of the pathogenesis of human CPTII deficiency diseases and for diagnosis and therapy. In this report, site-directed mutagenesis studies of conserved glutamate residues in the C-terminal domain of a liver isoform of CPTII demonstrate for the first time that the conserved glutamate residue Glu487 is important for catalysis. Mutants were constructed using the overlap extension PCR procedure (27Tao B.Y. Lee K.C.P. Griffin H.G. Griffin A.M. PCR Technology: Current Innovations.

Transformants obtained upon transformation of the competent E. coli BL21 cells by the mutant DNAs were screened for the ability to productively serve as templates for PCR using forward primers with 3′ ends specific to each of the above mutations. For example, the E500A mutant was screened for with the following primer: E500ACK 5′-CAAGCACGGCCGCACAGC-3′. The mutation-specific 3′ nucleotides are indicated in bold above and in Table I. The other primers used for screening were E500DCK, E487ACK, E487KCK, and E487DCK. The mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The transformants are designated as EC-CPTII, EC-PPROEX, EC-E487A, EC-E487D, EC-E487K, EC-E500A, and EC-E500D. A single colony of EC-CPTII, EC-PPROEX, EC-E500A, EC-E500D, EC-E487A, EC-E487D, or EC-E487K was inoculated into a 2-ml LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and incubated at 37 °C overnight with shaking (280 rpm). The culture was then transferred to 200 ml of the 2-ml LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and incubated at 37 °C with shaking until the A 600 reached 0.5–0.8 unit. 200 μl of 1 misopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was then added to each culture, and the incubation was continued at 37 °C with shaking for 5 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 20 min, washed by resuspension in 20 ml of PBS, and finally suspended in 4 ml of PBS. The cells were then lysed by French press at 1500 p.s.i. Whole-cell extracts were obtained after centrifugation of the cell lysates at 12,000 ×g for 20 min. Protein was determined using the protein assay kit (Bio-Rad), and the cell extracts were stored at −80 °C. CPT activity was assayed by the forward exchange method using l-[3H]carnitine (8Shi J.

The K m for carnitine was determined by varying the carnitine concentration from 11.1 to 471.7 μm at a fixed 111.1 μm palmitoyl-CoA. Proteins in whole-cell extracts were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in a 10% gel and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Immunoblots were developed by incubation with the anti-His tag antibodies (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) as described previously (8Shi J. Zhu H. Arvidson D.N. Woldegiorgis G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9421-9426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). For wild-type and mutant CPTII protein determination in the whole-cell extracts, a quantitative Western blot analysis was employed with a His6 protein ladder (Qiagen). The fluorescence intensity was measured using the Scion Image software (Scion Corp.). Sources of other materials and procedures were as described in our previous publication (8Shi J. Zhu H.

We have previously cloned the full-length rat liver CPTI and CPTII cDNA, separately expressed the genes in the yeast P. pastoris, and demonstrated for the first time that CPTI and CPTII are distinct catalytically active enzymes (15de Vries Y.

Construction of plasmids carrying the wild-type and mutant CPTIIs was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing (Table I). E. coli was chosen as an expression system for the wild-type and mutant CPTIIs because it has no endogenous CPTII activity, and the E. coli-expressed CPTII is catalytically active (13Brown N.F. Sen A. Soltis D.A. Jones B. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 79-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). We expressed the full-length rat liver CPTII cDNA in E. coli and demonstrated that, unlike CPTI, the expressed CPTII is catalytically active (Table II). Furthermore, no CPTII activity was found in the control E. coli strain with the vector but without the CPTII cDNA insert.Table IICPT activity in E. coli strains expressing wild-type and mutant CPTIIsStrainsActivitynmol/mg·min%Wild-type CPTII122.4 ± 0.48100EC-E487A4.9 ± 0.094.0EC-E487K1.2 ± 0.051.0EC-E487D4.0 ± 0.073.3EC-E500A70.6 ± 0.3357.6EC-E500D30.6 ± 0.0525.0Whole-cell extract containing 3.6 μg of CPTIIs of each strain were assayed for CPT activity as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The results are the means ± S.D. of at least three independent experiments with different protein preparations.

Numbers in parentheses represent percent of CPT activity in the mutants compared with the wild type (100%). Separate substitution of the highly conserved glutamate residue at position 487 (Glu487) (Fig. 1) with alanine (E487A), lysine (E487K), or aspartate (E487D) resulted in 96, 99, and 97% losses in CPTII activity, respectively, compared with the activity observed in the wild-type CPTII. A change of the conserved glutamate 500 (Glu500) to alanine (E500A) or aspartate (E500D) resulted in losses of 42 and 75% in CPTII activity, respectively, compared with the wild-type CPTII activity (TableII). Western blot analysis of the extract from the E. coli strain expressing the wild-type and mutant CPTIIs using an anti-His tag antibody showed the presence of a 71-kDa protein corresponding to CPTII (Fig. 2). For the wild-type and mutant CPTIIs, proteins of the predicted size were expressed at similar steady-state levels as determined by quantitative immunoblot using a pure His6 protein as the standard. The quantitative Western blot and the densitometry analysis for the His6 protein are shown in Fig. 2, B and C. Based on the quantitative immunoblot of the standard protein, the wild-type and mutant CPTII proteins were estimated to contain 7 pmol (0.49 μg) of CPTII in 20 μg of whole-cell extract protein. Because of the extremely low activity in mutants E487A, E487D, and E487K, it was not possible to determine the K m orV max values for the carnitine or palmitoyl-CoA substrates. Mutants E500A and E500D exhibited normal saturation kinetics when the carnitine concentration was varied relative to a constant second substrate, palmitoyl-CoA (Fig.3 A), a property identical to the wild-type CPTII. For the E500A and E500D, the calculatedK m values for carnitine were ∼2-fold higher than the value for the wild-type CPTII, as shown in TableIII, and the V maxvalues were 26 and 60% lower than the wild type, respectively, indicating a major effect of the E500D mutation on catalytic activity. The catalytic efficiency as calculated by theV max/K m for the E500A and E500D was decreased by 55 and 76%, respectively. With respect to the second substrate, palmitoyl-CoA, mutants E500A and E500D exhibited normal saturation kinetics similar to the wild type (Fig.3 B) when the molar ratio of palmitoyl-CoA to albumin was fixed at 6.1:1. The calculated K m values for palmitoyl-CoA for mutants E500A and E500D were 76 and 89% lower, respectively, than the wild type. The V maxvalues for mutants E500A and E500D were 13 and 29% of the wild-type values (Table III), and the catalytic efficiency was similar to the wild type for both mutants E500A and E500D. Thus, substitution of the conserved Glu500 residue with either alanine or aspartate resulted in substantial loss in catalytic activity, but substitution of the highly conserved Glu487 with alanine, lysine, or aspartate resulted in nearly complete loss in CPTII activity (TableII).Table IIIKinetic characteristics of E. coli-expressed wild-type and mutant CPTIIsStrainsCarnitinePalmitoyl-CoAK mV maxK mV maxμmnmol/mg · minμmnmol/mg · minWild-type CPTII63.7187.681.9395.7EC-E500A105.6138.719.9114.2EC-E500D111.477.58.853.0Whole-cell extract containing 3.6 μg of CPTIIs of wild-type and mutant CPTIIs were assayed for CPT activity in the presence of increasing concentrations of carnitine or palmitoyl-CoA. Values are the average of at least two independent experiments with different protein preparations. Open table in a new tab Whole-cell extract containing 3.6 μg of CPTIIs of wild-type and mutant CPTIIs were assayed for CPT activity in the presence of increasing concentrations of carnitine or palmitoyl-CoA. Values are the average of at least two independent experiments with different protein preparations. The site-directed mutagenesis study described here is aimed at elucidating the function of highly conserved acidic residues found at the proximity of the active site of CPTII. Two glutamate residues, Glu487 and Glu500 in rat liver CPTII, and the corresponding residues Glu590 and Glu603 in a liver isoform of CPTI, are conserved throughout the family of acyltransferases with known primary sequences. Specifically, Glu487 in CPTII and Glu590 in CPTI are highly conserved within the family of acyltransferases, but Glu500in CPTII and Glu603 in CPTI are conserved residues within the family of CPT enzymes, whereas other acyltransferases have aspartate at this position (Fig. 1). To determine the role of the conserved Glu487 and Glu500 residues in CPTII in catalysis, we separately changed the highly conserved glutamate residue (Glu487) to alanine (E487A), aspartate (E487D), and lysine (E487K), and the second conserved glutamate residue (Glu500) in CPTII to alanine (E500A) and aspartate (E500D), and we determined the effect of the mutations on CPTII activity in the E. coli-expressed mutant enzyme. Substitution of Glu487 with alanine, lysine, or aspartate resulted in loss of >96% CPTII activity. Thus, the presence of this highly conserved Glu487 residue is probably crucial for maintaining the configuration of the CPTII active site. Mutation of the corresponding highly conserved residue in a liver isoform of CPTI, Glu590, to alanine resulted in a 50% loss in CPTI activity (data not shown). The substantial loss in CPTII activity (99%) observed with our E487K mutant along with the loss observed in the child with the CPTII deficiency disease (26Bruno C. Bado M. Minetti C. Cordone G. DiMauro S. J. Child Neurol. 2000; 15: 390-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) establishes that Glu487 is probably crucial for maintaining the configuration of the liver isoform of CPTII active site. All of the Glu487 mutants had insufficient activity to allow measurement of K m or V max for either carnitine or palmitoyl-CoA. Because a conservative substitution of Glu487 with aspartate (E467D), a negatively charged amino acid that has only one less methyl group than the glutamate residue in the wild-type enzyme, resulted in 97% loss in activity, we suggest that Glu487 is at the active-site pocket of CPTII. As the terminal enzyme that transports long chain fatty acids from the cytosol to the mitochondrial matrix, CPTII in the presence of CoA-SH reversibly catalyzes the conversion of long chain acylcarnitines to long chain acyl-CoAs. Similar to other acyltransferases, CPTII contains a general acid/base, His372, a highly conserved residue that may form a hydrogen-bonding network or a salt bridge to a nearby conserved glutamate residue such as Glu487 or Glu500. Substitution of Glu487 with alanine, lysine, or aspartate resulted in an inactive enzyme. Glu487may thus be involved in facilitating catalysis by orienting the imidazole ring of His372 for optimum productive interaction with the substrate (12Barycki J.J. O'Brien L.K. Strauss A.W. Banaszak L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36718-36726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We hypothesize that the Glu487 to alanine or lysine substitution may disrupt a hydrogen-bonding network or a salt bridge, perhaps to a residue like His372 at the active site of CPTII. However, a change of Glu487 to aspartate may result in the carboxylate being outside the hydrogen bond distance of His372, the predicted general acid/base at the active site (12Barycki J.J. O'Brien L.K. Strauss A.W. Banaszak L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36718-36726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The characterization of E487K, E487A, and E487D described here is consistent with previously reported studies of a child with a novel CPTII deficiency disease that exhibited clinical episodes of myalgia and myoglobinuria induced by intercurrent febrile illnesses (26Bruno C. Bado M. Minetti C. Cordone G. DiMauro S. J. Child Neurol. 2000; 15: 390-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The patient was heterozygous for a G-to-A substitution at codon 487, changing the highly conserved Glu487 to lysine (E487K), whereas the other allele carried the common benign S113L missense mutation. However, for the rat liver CPTII, a single substitution mutation of Glu487 to lysine resulted in almost complete loss (99%) in activity, and even a single conservative change of Glu487 to aspartate (E487D) or alanine (E487A) caused >96% loss in catalytic activity, further supporting a pathogenic role for a mutation of this residue. Thus, substitution mutation of the highly conserved negatively charged Glu487residue located in the C-terminal region inactivates CPTII, suggesting a critical role of this residue in catalysis. CPTII deficiency, inherited as an autosomal recessive trait, is the most common disorder of lipid metabolism affecting muscle and is the most frequent cause of hereditary myoglobinuria in adults that is triggered by prolonged exercise or fasting (or both) and by cold, stress, or fever, conditions associated with increased dependence of muscle on lipid metabolism (19Bonnefont J.P.

Metab. 2000; 70: 134-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). A hepatic form of CPTII deficiency associated with hypoketotic hypoglycemia, hepatopathy, cardiopathy, and sudden death has also been reported in infants (19Bonnefont J.P. Demaugre F. Prip-Buus C. Saudubray J.M. Brivet M. Abadi N. Thuillier L. Mol. Genet. Metab. 1999; 68: 424-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). To investigate the role of the second conserved glutamate residue in CPTII (Glu500) on catalytic function, Glu500was changed to alanine and aspartate and the mutant enzyme was characterized. Substitution of the conserved Glu500 with alanine and aspartate resulted in partial loss of activity and a decrease in the V max for both substrates. In addition, a change of the conserved Glu500 to aspartate caused a significant decrease in the V max for both substrates with a 2-fold increase in the K m for carnitine. For both substrates, a lower but similar decrease in theV max and a 2-fold increase in theK m for carnitine was observed with the E500A mutant, suggesting that the main effect of the mutations was to decrease the stability of the enzyme-substrate complex. However, the mutations could lead to misfolding in 90% of the molecules, producing a lowerK cat and unchanged K m values. Because the E500A and E500D mutations caused a substantial decrease in the V max, this could be related to the alteration of intrinsic CPTII stability. Furthermore, Glu500 appears to be critical for the structural stability of CPTII. A conservative substitution of Glu500 to aspartate resulted in >7- and 2.5-fold decreases in theV max for the substrates palmitoyl-CoA and carnitine, respectively, with a relatively minor change in carnitine binding but a significant increase in the affinity for palmitoyl-CoA. It is suggested that the Glu500 mutation exists within a region containing a possible adenine binding loop, because the affinity of the enzyme for palmitoyl-CoA that has an adenine group is greatly increased, but additional experimental evidence is needed to substantiate this hypothesis. Hence, Glu500 may help orient the loop containing the active site residue by hydrogen bonding of a backbone residue and may play a role in substrate binding and catalysis (12Barycki J.J. O'Brien L.K. Strauss A.W. Banaszak L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36718-36726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Sequence alignment of various acyltransferases shows the presence of highly conserved histidine and glutamate residues in CPTII. Mutation of the conserved His372 residue in CPTII and the corresponding residue in CPTI, His473 to alanine, inactivates both enzymes (14Brown N.F. Anderson R.C. Caplan S.L. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D.

In this report, we have demonstrated that the conserved Glu487 of rat liver CPTII is required for catalysis. Despite its similar negative charge and potential for hydrogen bonding, an aspartate residue cannot fulfill this requirement, suggesting that the extra methyl group in glutamate is needed for optimal catalysis and maintenance of active site integrity. A change of Glu487 to lysine or alanine also resulted in an inactive enzyme. The loss in activity observed with the E487K is consistent with previously reported studies of a child with a novel CPTII deficiency disease (26Bruno C. Bado M. Minetti C. Cordone G. DiMauro S. J. Child Neurol. 2000; 15: 390-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Substitution of the conserved Glu500 in CPTII with alanine or aspartate reduced the catalytic efficiency, suggesting that this residue may be important in stabilization of the enzyme-substrate complex."
