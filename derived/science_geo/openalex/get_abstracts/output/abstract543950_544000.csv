https://openalex.org/W1838945435,"The organization of a cell emerges from the interactions in protein networks. The interactome is critically dependent on the strengths of interactions and the cellular abundances of the connected proteins, both of which span orders of magnitude. However, these aspects have not yet been analyzed globally. Here, we have generated a library of HeLa cell lines expressing 1,125 GFP-tagged proteins under near-endogenous control, which we used as input for a next-generation interaction survey. Using quantitative proteomics, we detect specific interactions, estimate interaction stoichiometries, and measure cellular abundances of interacting proteins. These three quantitative dimensions reveal that the protein network is dominated by weak, substoichiometric interactions that play a pivotal role in defining network topology. The minority of stable complexes can be identified by their unique stoichiometry signature. This study provides a rich interaction dataset connecting thousands of proteins and introduces a framework for quantitative network analysis."

Herein the functional adaptations to cold of brown and beige adipose depots are examined using quantitative mitochondrial proteomics. We identify arginine/creatine metabolism as a beige adipose signature and demonstrate that creatine enhances respiration in beige-fat mitochondria when ADP is limiting. In murine beige fat, cold exposure stimulates mitochondrial creatine kinase activity and induces coordinated expression of genes associated with creatine metabolism. Pharmacological reduction of creatine levels decreases whole-body energy expenditure after administration of a β3-agonist and reduces beige and brown adipose metabolic rate. Genes of creatine metabolism are compensatorily induced when UCP1-dependent thermogenesis is ablated, and creatine reduction in Ucp1-deficient mice reduces core body temperature. These findings link a futile cycle of creatine metabolism to adipose tissue energy expenditure and thermal homeostasis. PAPERCLIP."

Ethylene is a gaseous phytohormone produced by plants in response to various internal and environmental stimuli, which triggers a wide range of physiological and morphological responses (Johnson and Ecker, 1998Johnson P.R. Ecker J.R. The ethylene gas signal transduction pathway: a molecular perspective.Annu. Rev. Genet. 1998; 32: 227-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). During the past decades, a relatively linear ethylene signaling pathway has been established through the application of molecular and genetic approaches (Guo and Ecker, 2004Guo H. Ecker J.R. The ethylene signaling pathway: new insights.Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2004; 7: 40-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). In Arabidopsis, ethylene is perceived by a group of ER-located receptors (Chang and Stadler, 2001Chang C. Stadler R. Ethylene hormone receptor action in Arabidopsis.BioEssays. 2001; 23: 619-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In the absence of ethylene signal, the hormone-free receptors activate a Raf-like protein kinase CONSTITUTIVE TRIPLE RESPONSE 1 (CTR1) (Gao et al., 2003Gao Z. Chen Y.F. Randlett M.D. Zhao X.C. Findell J.L. Kieber J.J. Schaller G.E. Localization of the Raf-like kinase CTR1 to the endoplasmic reticulum of Arabidopsis through participation in ethylene receptor signaling complexes.J. Biol.

Activated CTR1 and the receptors cooperatively inhibit an ER-located membrane protein ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE 2 (EIN2) through physical interaction and protein phosphorylation (Alonso et al., 1999Alonso J.M.

USA. 2012; 109: 19486-19491Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). EIN2 is a key component in ethylene signaling pathway, evidenced by completely ethylene-insensitive phenotypes of the ein2 null mutants (Ji and Guo, 2013Ji Y. Guo H. From endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to nucleus: EIN2 bridges the gap in ethylene signaling.Mol. Plant. 2013; 6: 11-14Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). It is encoded by a single-copy gene in Arabidopsis, and is conserved from charophyte green algae to land plants (Ju et al., 2015Ju C. Van de Poel B. Cooper E.D. Thierer J.H. Gibbons T.R. Delwiche C.F. Chang C. Conservation of ethylene as a plant hormone over 450 million years of evolution.Nature Plants. 2015; 1: 14004Crossref Scopus (150) Google Scholar). While the function of its N-terminal membrane-spanning domain is not clear, the C-terminal end of EIN2 (CEND) is thought to participate in signaling output, as ectopic expression of this domain alone can partially activate ethylene responses (Alonso et al., 1999Alonso J.M. Hirayama T. Roman G. Nourizadeh S. Ecker J.R.

Activation of ethylene signaling is mediated by nuclear translocation of the cleaved EIN2 carboxyl terminus.Cell Res. 2012; 22: 1613-1616Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Recent studies reported that CEND can be phosphorylated by the receptors-activated CTR1 in the absence of ethylene (Ju et al., 2012Ju C. Yoon G.M. Shemansky J.M. Lin D.Y. Ying Z.I. Chang J. Garrett W.M. Kessenbrock M. Groth G. Tucker M.L. et al.CTR1 phosphorylates the central regulator EIN2 to control ethylene hormone signaling from the ER membrane to the nucleus in Arabidopsis.Proc.

Processing and subcellular trafficking of ER-tethered EIN2 control response to ethylene gas.Science. 2012; 338: 390-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Upon ethylene application, inactivation of the receptors and CTR1 abolishes the phosphorylation state of CEND, leading to its proteolysis from the ER-tethered N terminus, followed by shuttling into the nucleus (Ju et al., 2012Ju C. Yoon G.M. Shemansky J.M. Lin D.Y. Ying Z.I. Chang J. Garrett W.M. Kessenbrock M. Groth G. Tucker M.L. et al.CTR1 phosphorylates the central regulator EIN2 to control ethylene hormone signaling from the ER membrane to the nucleus in Arabidopsis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Activation of ethylene signaling is mediated by nuclear translocation of the cleaved EIN2 carboxyl terminus.Cell Res. 2012; 22: 1613-1616Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). However, this “cleave and shuttle” mode might represent part of the EIN2 actions, as induced nuclear localization of CEND only partially activates ethylene signaling (Ji and Guo, 2013Ji Y. Guo H.

Activation of ethylene signaling is mediated by nuclear translocation of the cleaved EIN2 carboxyl terminus.Cell Res. 2012; 22: 1613-1616Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Meanwhile, ethylene also induces CEND to form discrete and prominent foci in the cytoplasm (Qiao et al., 2012Qiao H. Shen Z. Huang S.S. Schmitz R.J. Urich M.A. Briggs S.P. Ecker J.R. Processing and subcellular trafficking of ER-tethered EIN2 control response to ethylene gas.Science. 2012; 338: 390-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, Wen et al., 2012Wen X. Zhang C.

Activation of ethylene signaling is mediated by nuclear translocation of the cleaved EIN2 carboxyl terminus.Cell Res. 2012; 22: 1613-1616Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), but the function of such cytoplasmic portion remains unexplored. In the nucleus, components working downstream of EIN2 are two master transcription factors ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE 3 (EIN3) and its homolog EIN3-LIKE 1 (EIL1), which regulate the vast majority of ethylene-directed gene expression (Chang et al., 2013Chang K.N. Zhong S. Weirauch M.T. Hon G. Pelizzola M. Li H. Huang S.S. Schmitz R.J.

One of the key regulatory mechanisms of ethylene signaling is the stabilization of EIN3/EIL1 proteins, wherein ethylene acts to repress the proteasomal degradation of EIN3/EIL1 mediated by two F-box proteins, EIN3-BINDING F-BOX 1 (EBF1) and EBF2, in an EIN2-dependent manner (An et al., 2010An F.

However, the molecular mechanism of how ethylene or EIN2 represses the function of EBF1/2 is still elusive. ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE 5 (EIN5), encoding a cytoplasmic 5′-3′ exoribonuclease (AtXRN4), is another component positively modulating ethylene responses (Olmedo et al., 2006Olmedo G. Guo H. Gregory B.D. Nourizadeh S.D. Aguilar-Henonin L. Li H. An F. Guzman P. Ecker J.R. ETHYLENE-INSENSITIVE5 encodes a 5′-->3′ exoribonuclease required for regulation of the EIN3-targeting F-box proteins EBF1/2.Proc.

The exoribonuclease XRN4 is a component of the ethylene response pathway in Arabidopsis.Plant Cell. 2006; 18: 3047-3057Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Currently, little is known about how EIN5 modulates ethylene signaling, except for the genetic evidence suggesting its participation in the regulation of EBF1/2 function (Olmedo et al., 2006Olmedo G. Guo H. Gregory B.D. Nourizadeh S.D. Aguilar-Henonin L. Li H. An F. Guzman P. Ecker J.R.

The exoribonuclease XRN4 is a component of the ethylene response pathway in Arabidopsis.Plant Cell. 2006; 18: 3047-3057Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Notably, small RNA fragments corresponding to EBF1 and EBF2 mRNA 3′ UTR were processed and accumulated in ein5 (Olmedo et al., 2006Olmedo G. Guo H. Gregory B.D. Nourizadeh S.D. Aguilar-Henonin L. Li H. An F. Guzman P. Ecker J.R. ETHYLENE-INSENSITIVE5 encodes a 5′-->3′ exoribonuclease required for regulation of the EIN3-targeting F-box proteins EBF1/2.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Cell. 2004; 15: 173-183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Our recent work uncovered that EIN5, in combination with 3′-5′ RNA decay pathway, is responsible for the removal of many defective coding transcripts as well as the cleavage fragments of miRNA targets, including 3′ UTRs, which are otherwise subjected to posttranscriptional gene silencing (Zhang et al., 2015Zhang X. Zhu Y. Liu X. Hong X. Xu Y. Zhu P. Shen Y. Wu H. Ji Y. Wen X. et al.Suppression of endogenous gene silencing by bidirectional cytoplasmic RNA decay in Arabidopsis.Science. 2015; 348: 120-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). However, genetic evidence disfavored the possibility that 3′ UTR fragments of EBF1/2 mRNA are processed and targeted to small RNA-mediated gene silencing pathway (Potuschak et al., 2006Potuschak T. Vansiri A. Binder B.M. Lechner E. Vierstra R.D. Genschik P. The exoribonuclease XRN4 is a component of the ethylene response pathway in Arabidopsis.Plant Cell. 2006; 18: 3047-3057Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Interestingly, ectopic expression of a 3′ UTR-truncated EBF2 gene resulted in a stronger ethylene insensitive phenotype than that of the EBF2 full-length gene (Konishi and Yanagisawa, 2008Konishi M. Yanagisawa S. Two different mechanisms control ethylene sensitivity in Arabidopsis via the regulation of EBF2 expression.Plant Signal. Behav. 2008; 3: 749-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), implying a negative role of 3′ UTR on the EBF2 function. In this study, we sought to investigate the regulatory mechanisms of how ethylene signal is relayed from cytoplasm to nucleus, and how EIN2 and EIN5 participate in this signaling process. Strikingly, we found that ectopic expression of either EBF1 or EBF2 3′ UTR fragments confers strong ethylene-insensitivity phenotypes through promoting the translation of endogenous EBF1/2 mRNAs. Furthermore, we found that ethylene induces EIN2 to target EBF1 3′ UTR to cytoplasmic processing-body (P-body) through interacting with EIN5 and other P-body factors to repress EBF1/2 translation. Our study uncovers another branch of ethylene signaling pathway mediated by cytoplasmic EIN2 in translational control. Previous studies revealed that the ein5 mutant accumulated EBF1/2 mRNA 3′ UTR fragments (Olmedo et al., 2006Olmedo G. Guo H. Gregory B.D. Nourizadeh S.D. Aguilar-Henonin L. Li H. An F. Guzman P. Ecker J.R. ETHYLENE-INSENSITIVE5 encodes a 5′-->3′ exoribonuclease required for regulation of the EIN3-targeting F-box proteins EBF1/2.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 13286-13293Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, Potuschak et al., 2006Potuschak T. Vansiri A. Binder B.M. Lechner E. Vierstra R.D. Genschik P. The exoribonuclease XRN4 is a component of the ethylene response pathway in Arabidopsis.Plant Cell. 2006; 18: 3047-3057Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, Souret et al., 2004Souret F.F.

Cell. 2004; 15: 173-183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). We thus speculated that the over-accumulated 3′ UTR fragments could contribute to the ethylene insensitivity of ein5. To test this speculation, we overexpressed the EBF1 3′ UTR region (1U) in wild-type Col-0 plants (Figures 1A and 1B ). The so-called “triple response” phenotype is commonly used as an ethylene-specific growth response in Arabidopsis, which refers to exaggerated apical hooks, shortened hypocotyls and roots of dark-grown seedlings exposed to ethylene or treated with ethylene precursor 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) (Bleecker et al., 1988Bleecker A.B. Estelle M.A. Somerville C. Kende H. Insensitivity to ethylene conferred by a dominant mutation in Arabidopsis thaliana.Science. 1988; 241: 1086-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar, Ecker, 1995Ecker J.R. The ethylene signal transduction pathway in plants.Science. 1995; 268: 667-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). Overexpression of 1U conferred significant attenuation of triple response phenotypes to Col-0, resulting in elongated hypocotyls and roots compared with control seedlings (Figures 1C and 1D). Consistently, we found that the levels of EIN3 protein were lower in 1U transgenic plants than that in Col-0 (Figure 1E). Furthermore, we fused 1U to the MYC tag and GFP coding sequence (referred to as M1U and G1U), respectively (Figures 1F and 1H), and overexpressed these fusion genes in wild-type Col-0 (Figures S1A–S1C and S1F–S1H). Similar to 1U-overexpressing seedlings, M1U- and G1U-overexpressing plants displayed reduced ethylene sensitivity and impaired EIN3 protein accumulation compared with control plants (Figures 1G, 1I, S1D, S1E, S1I, and S1J). Together, these results demonstrate that overexpression of 1U, alone or in fusion with unrelated transcripts, reduces ethylene sensitivity. Interestingly, we found that ethylene hyposensitivity resulting from 1U-overexpression was partially restored by a defect in either EBF1 or EBF2 (Figure 2A). Due to the fatal effect of over-accumulated EIN3 in ebf1 ebf2 double mutant, we next overexpressed M1U in β-estradiol-inducible EIN3-Flag/ein3 eil1 ebf1 ebf2 (iEIN3/qm) (An et al., 2010An F. Zhao Q. Ji Y. Li W. Jiang Z. Yu X. Zhang C. Han Y. He W. Liu Y. et al.Ethylene-induced stabilization of ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE3 and EIN3-LIKE1 is mediated by proteasomal degradation of EIN3 binding F-box 1 and 2 that requires EIN2 in Arabidopsis.Plant Cell. 2010; 22: 2384-2401Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar), which was used as a substitution of the lethal ebf1 ebf2 double mutant (Figure S2A). We found that M1U no longer affected the triple response phenotypes (Figure 2B), and the abundance of EIN3 protein was comparable between iEIN3/qm and M1U iEIN3/qm (Figure S2B). Together, these results demonstrate that the presence of EBF1/2 is required for the 1U-overexpression-induced repression of ethylene responses, implying that exogenous 3′ UTR expression modulates the function of EBF1/2.Figure S2EIN3-Flag Protein Accumulation and EBF1/2 mRNA Levels in M1U Transgenic Plants, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) qRT-PCR analysis of the levels of the 3′UTR transcripts in 3-day-old etiolated seedlings supplemented with 10 μM ACC and β-estradiol. iEIN3/qm stands for the ein3 eil1 ebf1 ebf2 quadruple mutant expressing the β-estradiol inducible EIN3-Flag transgene (An et al., 2010An F.

Total proteins were stained with Coomassie brilliant blue (CBB) as loading controls. (C) qRT-PCR analysis of EBF1 and EBF2 mRNA levels in MYC and M1U seedlings shown in Figure 1G. We found that the levels of both EBF1 and EBF2 transcripts were not evidently affected by 1U overexpression (Figure S2C), excluding the modulation of EBF1/2 at the level of transcription or RNA decay. We next examined whether the translation of EBF1/2 mRNAs is under the regulation. Without good antibody against EBF1 or EBF2 available, two experiments were conducted for this purpose. Using polysome profiling assays, we found that the translation of EBF1 and EBF2 mRNAs was repressed by ethylene, as the portion of high-density polysome-associated EBF1/2 mRNAs was decreased upon ethylene application (Figure 2C). Notably, 1U overexpression recovered the drop of the portion of polysome-associated EBF1/2 mRNAs (Figure 2C). Therefore, 1U overexpression augments the translation of endogenous EBF1/2 mRNAs, which is subjected to repression by ethylene. Furthermore, we constructed transgenic plants harboring GFP-EBF1 followed by 1U or not (G1F and G1C, respectively) (Figure 2D), and expressed an inducible 1U (iEBF1U) in these plants to examine the effect of exogenous 1U expression on G1F or G1C translation. We found that, while GFP-EBF1 mRNA levels were comparable, GFP-EBF1 protein levels were downregulated by ethylene and upregulated by 1U overexpression in G1F plants (Figures 2E and 2F). By contrast, in G1C plants, the GFP-EBF1 protein levels were virtually unchanged upon 1U expression regardless of ethylene application (Figures 2E and 2F). Collectively, these results suggest that the over-accumulation of 1U transcripts boosts the function of EBF1/2 by enhancing their translation. Based on these observations, we propose a translational interference model, in which ectopically expressed 1U transcripts interferes with the endogenous EBF1/2 3′ UTRs that supposedly exert a repressive role on the translation of EBF1/2 mRNAs. Such translational interference could arise from the competition and/or titration of translational repressors binding to the endogenous 3′ UTR regions (Figure 2G). We next tested the translational interference model (Figure 2G) by examining the effect of EBF1 3′ UTR on GFP mRNA translation (Figures 1H, 1I, and S1F–S1J). We found that, with the comparable transcript levels (Figure S1G), seedlings expressing G1U accumulated much lower GFP fluorescence or protein abundance than those expressing GFP alone, particularly when treated with ACC (Figures 3A–3D). Ethylene caused over 80% of decrease in the translational efficiency of G1U whereas had no effect on GFP alone (Figures 3C and 3D). The ACC-promoted reduction in GFP protein abundance was restored by the application of ethylene inhibitor silver ions (Ag+) (Figure 3E). Taken together, these results indicate that EBF1 3′ UTR confers translational repression to its fusion mRNA in response to ethylene. Next, we determined the biological significance of the EBF1 mRNA 3′ UTR–mediated translational repression in ethylene signal transduction. We constitutively expressed M1C (MYC-EBF1, MYC tag fused with the EBF1 coding sequence) and M1F (MYC fused with the EBF1 full-length transcript including coding sequence and 3′ UTR) (Figure 3F). Compared with control plants, M1F expression resulted in reduced ethylene sensitivity, whereas M1C expression conferred nearly complete ethylene insensitivity (Figure 3G). In agreement with the triple response phenotype, the amount of MYC-EBF1 protein was nearly constant in M1C but progressively decreased in M1F upon treatment with increasing doses of ACC (Figure 3H). Given the comparable mRNA abundance between M1F and M1C (Figures S3A and S3B), we concluded that translational repression of EBF1 mRNA via its 3′ UTR is critical for EBF1 function in ethylene signaling. We further found that the overexpression of EBF2 3′ UTR (2U) also led to reduced ethylene sensitivity in GFP-EBF2 3′ UTR (G2U) transgenic plants (Figures S3C and S3D). Like EBF1 3′ UTR, EBF2 3′ UTR also conferred translational repression to the GFP mRNA fused with it (Figure S3E). Thus, the 3′ UTRs of both EBF1 and EBF2 act similarly to impose translational repression to their respective mRNAs in response to the ethylene signal. We next investigated the role of key ethylene signaling components in 3′-UTR-mediated translational regulation. The ethylene-induced repression of G1U mRNA translation, manifested by reduced GFP fluorescence, was similarly observed in Col-0 and ein3 eil1, but not in ein2 and a receptor mutant etr1 (Figures 4A and S4A), suggesting that the upstream signaling components including the receptors and EIN2 are required for 3′-UTR-mediated translational repression, whereas EIN3/EIL1 are not. Expression of a β-estradiol-inducible version of EIN2 was sufficient to restore such translation inhibition in ein2, and the removal of β-estradiol led to the efficient translation of G1U again (Figures 4B and 4C). A similar scenario was observed with transiently expressed β-estradiol-inducible EIN2 and G1U in tobacco (Figure S4B), supporting that EIN2 is essential for EBF1 3′ UTR-directed translational repression.Figure S4The Levels of G1U and MYC Transcripts and Translational Repression of G1U by EIN2, Related to Figure 4Show full caption(A) qRT-PCR analysis showing comparable levels of the G1U (GFP-EBF1 3′UTR) transcripts in seedlings corresponding to Figure 4A.(B) Immunoblot assays to detect the protein levels of GFP (top) and EIN2-HA (bottom) in tobacco leaves transfected with iEIN2-HA (β-estradiol inducible EIN2-HA) and G1U (or GFP as a negative control).

https://openalex.org/W2136785377,"The central role of translation in modulating gene activity has long been recognized, yet the systematic exploration of quantitative changes in translation at a genome-wide scale in response to a specific stimulus has only recently become technically feasible. Using the well-characterized signaling pathway of the phytohormone ethylene and plant-optimized genome-wide ribosome footprinting, we have uncovered a molecular mechanism linking this hormone’s perception to the activation of a gene-specific translational control mechanism. Characterization of one of the targets of this translation regulatory machinery, the ethylene signaling component EBF2, indicates that the signaling molecule EIN2 and the nonsense-mediated decay proteins UPFs play a central role in this ethylene-induced translational response. Furthermore, the 3′UTR of EBF2 is sufficient to confer translational regulation and required for the proper activation of ethylene responses. These findings represent a mechanistic paradigm of gene-specific regulation of translation in response to a key growth regulator."
https://openalex.org/W2169699730,"Suicide is a leading cause of death worldwide. Although research has made strides in better defining suicidal behaviors, there has been less focus on accurate measurement. Currently, the widespread use of self-report, single-item questions to assess suicide ideation, plans and attempts may contribute to measurement problems and misclassification. We examined the validity of single-item measurement and the potential for statistical errors. Over 1,500 participants completed an online survey containing single-item questions regarding a history of suicidal behaviors, followed by questions with more precise language, multiple response options and narrative responses to examine the validity of single-item questions. We also conducted simulations to test whether common statistical tests are robust against the degree of misclassification produced by the use of single-items. We found that 11.3% of participants that endorsed a single-item suicide attempt measure engaged in behavior that would not meet the standard definition of a suicide attempt. Similarly, 8.8% of those who endorsed a single-item measure of suicide ideation endorsed thoughts that would not meet standard definitions of suicide ideation. Statistical simulations revealed that this level of misclassification substantially decreases statistical power and increases the likelihood of false conclusions from statistical tests. Providing a wider range of response options for each item reduced the misclassification rate by approximately half. Overall, the use of single-item, self-report questions to assess the presence of suicidal behaviors leads to misclassification, increasing the likelihood of statistical decision errors. Improving the measurement of suicidal behaviors is critical to increase understanding and prevention of suicide."
https://openalex.org/W2103534177,"Most human transcripts are alternatively spliced, and many disease-causing mutations affect RNA splicing. Toward better modeling the sequence determinants of alternative splicing, we measured the splicing patterns of over two million (M) synthetic mini-genes, which include degenerate subsequences totaling over 100 M bases of variation. The massive size of these training data allowed us to improve upon current models of splicing, as well as to gain new mechanistic insights. Our results show that the vast majority of hexamer sequence motifs measurably influence splice site selection when positioned within alternative exons, with multiple motifs acting additively rather than cooperatively. Intriguingly, motifs that enhance (suppress) exon inclusion in alternative 5' splicing also enhance (suppress) exon inclusion in alternative 3' or cassette exon splicing, suggesting a universal mechanism for alternative exon recognition. Finally, our empirically trained models are highly predictive of the effects of naturally occurring variants on alternative splicing in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2101731216,"LINE-1 retrotransposons are fast-evolving mobile genetic entities that play roles in gene regulation, pathological conditions, and evolution. Here, we show that the primate LINE-1 5'UTR contains a primate-specific open reading frame (ORF) in the antisense orientation that we named ORF0. The gene product of this ORF localizes to promyelocytic leukemia-adjacent nuclear bodies. ORF0 is present in more than 3,000 loci across human and chimpanzee genomes and has a promoter and a conserved strong Kozak sequence that supports translation. By virtue of containing two splice donor sites, ORF0 can also form fusion proteins with proximal exons. ORF0 transcripts are readily detected in induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells from both primate species. Capped and polyadenylated ORF0 mRNAs are present in the cytoplasm, and endogenous ORF0 peptides are identified upon proteomic analysis. Finally, ORF0 enhances LINE-1 mobility. Taken together, these results suggest a role for ORF0 in retrotransposon-mediated diversity."
https://openalex.org/W2257905227,"Adhesion GPCRs (aGPCRs) form the second largest, yet most enigmatic class of the GPCR superfamily. Although the physiologic importance of aGPCRs was demonstrated in several studies, the majority of these receptors is still orphan with respect to their agonists and signal transduction. Recent studies reported that aGPCRs are activated through a tethered peptide agonist, coined the Stachel sequence. The Stachel sequence is the most C-terminal part of the highly conserved GPCR autoproteolysis-inducing domain. Here, we used cell culture-based assays to investigate 2 natural splice variants within the Stachel sequence of the orphan Gs coupling aGPCR GPR114/ADGRG5. There is 1 variant constitutively active in cAMP assays (∼25-fold over empty vector) and sensitive to mechano-activation. The other variant has low basal activity in cAMP assays (6-fold over empty vector) and is insensitive to mechano-activation. In-depth mutagenesis studies of these functional differences revealed that the N-terminal half of the Stachel sequence confers the agonistic activity, whereas the C-terminal part orientates the agonistic core sequence to the transmembrane domain. Sequence comparison and functional testing suggest that the proposed mechanism of Stachel-mediated activation is relevant not only to GPR114 but to aGPCRs in general."

We demonstrate that a single amino-acid substitution in a banana lectin, replacing histidine 84 with a threonine, significantly reduces its mitogenicity, while preserving its broad-spectrum antiviral potency. X-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy, and glycocluster assays reveal that loss of mitogenicity is strongly correlated with loss of pi-pi stacking between aromatic amino acids H84 and Y83, which removes a wall separating two carbohydrate binding sites, thus diminishing multivalent interactions. On the other hand, monovalent interactions and antiviral activity are preserved by retaining other wild-type conformational features and possibly through unique contacts involving the T84 side chain.

Protein-carbohydrate interactions play essential roles in many biological processes, including adhesion and growth regulation, infection, and tumor pathogenesis (Gabius, 2015Gabius H.-J.

These carbohydrate-binding proteins are widely found in nature, have been put to considerable use in many aspects of glycobiology (André et al., 2015André S. Kaltner H. Manning J.C. Murphy P.V.

By specifically binding to mannosides of the glycans of glycoproteins on the surface of a virus, they can block viral attachment and/or fusion to cells. Possible clinical applications of lectins suffer from a major drawback, the potential for side effects mediated by lectin-induced mitogenicity (Borrebaeck and Carlsson, 1989Borrebaeck C.A.K. Carlsson R. Lectins as mitogens.Adv. Lectin Res. 1989; 2: 1-27Google Scholar). If a mitogenic lectin were used topically in an anti-HIV microbicide, it could lead to uncomfortable inflammation, an increase in viral transmission, and even greater HIV replication because of its ability to activate T cells. Given parenterally, a mitogenic lectin could lead to systemic inflammation (Huskens et al., 2008Huskens D. Vermeire K. Vandemeulebroucke E. Balzarini J. Schols D. Safety concerns for the potential use of cyanovirin-N as a microbicidal anti-HIV agent.Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2008; 40: 2802-2814Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). To date, it has remained entirely unclear whether mitogenicity and antiviral activity are dissectible in a given lectin. We set out to rationally engineer a plant lectin isolated from the fruit of bananas (Musa acuminata, BanLec) (Singh et al., 2014Singh S.S. Devi S.K. Ng T.B. Banana lectin: a brief review.Molecules. 2014; 19: 18817-18827Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), so as to eliminate its mitogenicity, while retaining its potent antiviral activity. BanLec is a member of the mannose-specific jacalin-related lectin (mJRL) group that functions as a potent T cell mitogen (Singh et al., 2014Singh S.S. Devi S.K. Ng T.B. Banana lectin: a brief review.Molecules. 2014; 19: 18817-18827Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). It forms a dimer with two carbohydrate-binding sites (CBS I and CBS II) in each protein subunit (Meagher et al., 2005Meagher J.L. Winter H.C. Ezell P. Goldstein I.J. Stuckey J.A.

BanLec avidly associates with high-mannose-type N-glycans on the HIV-1 envelope and can thus block viral entry into cells (Swanson et al., 2010Swanson M.D. Winter H.C. Goldstein I.J. Markovitz D.M.

Synergistic in vitro anti-HIV type 1 activity of tenofovir with carbohydrate-binding agents (CBAs).Antiviral Res. 2011; 90: 200-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Here, we show that a mutation within the sugar-binding site in BanLec makes it possible to significantly decrease mitogenic activity without compromising antiviral activity against HIV, hepatitis C virus (HCV), and influenza virus, all of which have high-mannose-type N-glycans on their surfaces. This new form of BanLec thus has the potential to be used as a broad-spectrum antiviral agent, something that is presently not available in the clinic. Further, we detail the molecular basis for separating these two distinct activities of the lectin. Our results provide proof of the feasibility of re-engineering target specificity and activity of a lectin, an approach that will greatly help to clarify how lectins read and transmit information through the Sugar Code, the biochemical platform that turns complex, sugar-encoded information into a broad spectrum of biological activities (Gabius et al., 2011Gabius H.-J.

The BanLec cDNA was cloned, and the recombinant protein containing a 6x His-tag, with the sequence LEHHHHHH, expressed in Escherichia coli. Unless stated otherwise, all of the BanLec proteins utilized in this study are recombinant versions containing a His-tag. The recombinant His-tagged version of BanLec maintains mannose-binding properties as measured by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) (see discussion below) and anti-HIV activity (Figure S1). Natural BanLec is a mitogen (Gavrovic-Jankulovic et al., 2008Gavrovic-Jankulovic M. Poulsen K. Brckalo T. Bobic S. Lindner B. Petersen A.

See also Figure S1. To pinpoint potentially promising sites for mutational engineering, we examined crystal structures of the β-prism I structure, which is characteristic for the JRL family (Meagher et al., 2005Meagher J.L. Winter H.C. Ezell P. Goldstein I.J. Stuckey J.A.

This fold consists of three Greek key structures composed of β strands; distinct loops found in the Greek keys play a role in carbohydrate binding. The first and second Greek keys include the JRL consensus motif GXXXD for sugar binding, and when mutations were introduced into these Greek keys, they abolished the mitogenic activity (as seen with the D133G mutant shown in Figure 1A), but also resulted in a loss of almost all anti-HIV activity (data not shown). The third Greek key varies among JRL members in length and sequence and is thought to play a role in binding glycan structures beyond simple saccharides (Nakamura-Tsuruta et al., 2008Nakamura-Tsuruta S. Uchiyama N. Peumans W.J. Van Damme E.J.M. Totani K. Ito Y. Hirabayashi J.

H84 is part of this third loop, known to be involved in binding the second sugar moiety in α1,6-dimannosides (Singh et al., 2005Singh D.D. Saikrishnan K. Kumar P. Surolia A. Sekar K. Vijayan M. Unusual sugar specificity of banana lectin from Musa paradisiaca and its probable evolutionary origin. Crystallographic and modelling studies.Glycobiology. 2005; 15: 1025-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Therefore, we reasoned that altering this amino acid might result in a change in binding characteristics that would affect the lectin’s mitogenic and antiviral activities differentially. Several H84 BanLec mutants were constructed (see further discussion below), and one variant, H84T, in which the histidine is replaced by a threonine, was found to not stimulate the proliferation of lymphocytes at concentrations up to 1 μM (Figure 1A). While increased cell-surface expression of the activation marker CD69 was observed for BanLec-treated CD4+ peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), the H84T variant induced very little stimulation of this same marker (Figure 1B). Moreover, wild-type (WT) BanLec consistently caused a large increase in the induction of cytokines from the PBMCs of multiple individual donors, whereas the response to H84T was markedly reduced (Figure 1C). Thus, H84T, unlike naturally occurring and WT recombinant BanLec, is minimally mitogenic when tested by three independent methods on the peripheral blood cells of multiple different donors. In contrast to its loss of mitogenicity, the H84T variant had an IC50 value against HIV in the low nanomolar range and was equally effective at inhibiting a wide range of HIV isolates as was WT BanLec, including multiple clinical isolates from different clades of group M, a group O clinical isolate, and a clinical isolate of HIV-2 (Table 1). Of note, a number of the isolates that were susceptible to H84T at low nanomolar concentrations required higher concentrations of the anti-HIV lectin Microvirin and/or were very difficult to inhibit with 2G12, a classic neutralizing anti-HIV monoclonal antibody (Table 1). Recombinant H84T without the His-tag showed very similar anti-HIV activity (data not shown).Table 1Anti-HIV Activity Profile of BanLec, H84T BanLec, Microvirin, and the 2G12 Monoclonal Antibody in PBMCsHIV-1HIV-2Lab StrainGroup MGroup ONL4.3BaLBCFGHUS2DJ259BZ163BCF-DIOUMBCF-KITABCF-06BV-5061W(X4)(R5)(R5)(R5)(R5)(R5)(R5)(X4)(X4)MVNa50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) in nanomolars required to inhibit viral p24 (for HIV-1) or p27 (for HIV-2) production by 50% in PBMCs.8222167ndndnd>350>350BanLeca50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) in nanomolars required to inhibit viral p24 (for HIV-1) or p27 (for HIV-2) production by 50% in PBMCs.0.870.871.12.22.56.53.6143.7H84T BanLeca50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) in nanomolars required to inhibit viral p24 (for HIV-1) or p27 (for HIV-2) production by 50% in PBMCs.2.10.931.50.473.14.11.20.730.332G12 mAbbAntibody concentration in nanograms per milliliter required to inhibit viral p24 (for HIV-1) or p27 (for HIV-2) production by 50% in PBMCs.1403,71040>50,000>20,000>20,000>20,000>20,000>20,000Viral co-receptor usage (R5 or X4) is determined in U87.CD4.CCR5 and U87.CD4.CXCR4 cells and indicated in parentheses.

Human breast milk and antiretrovirals dramatically reduce oral HIV-1 transmission in BLT humanized mice.PLoS Pathog. 2012; 8: e1002732Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). H84T or PBS (the carrier) was topically applied to the vagina prior to challenge with HIV-1JR-CSF. A total of 50% of the mice treated vaginally with PBS became infected, as determined by the presence of viral RNA in the plasma. In contrast, none of the mice treated topically with H84T showed detectable levels of viral RNA in the plasma during the course of the experiment (p = 0.0359; Figure 2A). The antiviral efficacy of H84T was further evaluated against another important pathogenic virus that presents oligomannoside chains on its surface proteins, hepatitis C virus (HCV; Goffard et al., 2005Goffard A. Callens N. Bartosch B. Wychowski C. Cosset F.L. Montpellier C. Dubuisson J. Role of N-linked glycans in the functions of hepatitis C virus envelope glycoproteins.J. Virol. 2005; 79: 8400-8409Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). An intergenotypic HCVcc reporter virus, i.e., BiGluc-Con1/Jc1, was tested in Huh-7.5 cells (Figure S2) (Reyes-del Valle et al., 2012Reyes-del Valle J. de la Fuente C. Turner M.A. Springfeld C. Apte-Sengupta S. Frenzke M.E. Forest A. Whidby J. Marcotrigiano J. Rice C.M. Cattaneo R. Broadly neutralizing immune responses against hepatitis C virus induced by vectored measles viruses and a recombinant envelope protein booster.J. Virol. 2012; 86: 11558-11566Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The addition of H84T to the inoculum decreased HCV in a dose-dependent manner and to levels comparable to inhibition by CD81 antibody, a positive control that blocks the cellular receptor for HCV (Figure S2A; data not shown). Co-incubation of virus inoculum with the BanLec derivative D133G/38A, which, similar to the D133G mutant (Figure 1A), is inactive, was found to not decrease viral replication (Figure S2B). At the EC90 concentration (determined in Huh-7.5 cells), H84T also reduced HCV replication to levels similar to neutralizing E2 antibody in a primary human fetal liver culture (data not shown). Finally, to determine if the H84T-specific reduction of HCV was due to inhibition of viral RNA replication, the effect of H84T BanLec was monitored in Huh-7.5 CD81 knockdown cells (CD81lo; Figure S2C). In this single-cycle assay, H84T decreased HCV replication over time in the control cell background only, further supporting the hypothesis that H84T inhibits viral replication at entry (receptor binding, membrane fusion), consistent with what we previously observed with WT BanLec against HIV (Swanson et al., 2010Swanson M.D. Winter H.C. Goldstein I.J. Markovitz D.M. A lectin isolated from bananas is a potent inhibitor of HIV replication.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 8646-8655Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Glycosylation sites on the HCV E1 and E2 envelope proteins are highly conserved across genotypes (Goffard et al., 2005Goffard A. Callens N. Bartosch B. Wychowski C. Cosset F.L. Montpellier C. Dubuisson J. Role of N-linked glycans in the functions of hepatitis C virus envelope glycoproteins.J. Virol. 2005; 79: 8400-8409Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Utilizing a panel of chimeric Gaussia luciferase reporter viruses, in which the structural region (core-NS2) was encoded by differing genotypes, H84T was observed to decrease HCV replication in a dose-dependent manner (Figures 2B–2J; Table S1). H84T BanLec thus appears to be a pan-genotypic inhibitor of HCV infection. The hemagglutinin of influenza A viruses bears high-mannose-type N-glycans that are susceptible to host lectins (Ng et al., 2012Ng W.C. Tate M.D. Brooks A.G. Reading P.C. Soluble host defense lectins in innate immunity to influenza virus.J. Biomed. Biotechnol. 2012; 2012: 732191Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In studies employing a retroviral core pseudotyped with the hemagglutinins of the 1918 H1N1 and the H5N1 avian pandemic influenza viruses, WT and H84T BanLec were both very active and equally inhibitory (Figures 2K and 2L). Next, we found that H84T BanLec is very active against multiple WT strains of influenza A tested in MDCK cells in tissue culture. Significant activity was seen against A/California/04/2009 (H1N1 pandemic strain), California/07/2009 (H1N1 pandemic strain), A/New York/18/2009 (H1N1 pandemic strain), and Perth/16/2009 (H3N2) with EC50 values of 1–4 μg/ml versus H1N1 virus and 0.06–0.1 versus H3N2 virus. A mutant form of BanLec that does not bind mannose, D133G/D38A, had no activity, excluding carbohydrate-independent effects. Importantly, significant activity was also seen with H84T against the Duck/MN/1525/81 H5N1 avian strain (EC50 of 5–11 μg/ml), confirming our results obtained with pseudotyped virus (Figure 2L). Finally, as some mouse-adapted strains of influenza lack mannose on their hemagglutinin (Smee et al., 2008Smee D.F. Bailey K.W. Wong M.H. O’Keefe B.R. Gustafson K.R. Mishin V.P. Gubareva L.V. Treatment of influenza A (H1N1) virus infections in mice and ferrets with cyanovirin-N.Antiviral Res. 2008; 80: 266-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), we tested an H1N1 (A/WSN/1933) isolate previously shown to be inhibited by mannose-binding proteins for its sensitivity to our new agent. H84T was indeed quite active against this H1N1 strain, which causes disease in mice. Most importantly, we found that intranasal (IN) H84T BanLec, first given 4 hr after IN viral challenge, effectively blocks influenza infection in the mouse model (Figure 2M). Taken together, studies with pseudotyped virus, WT virus in tissue culture, and a mouse model of influenza demonstrate significant activity of H84T against multiple strains of influenza. To begin to delineate the basis for the H84T mutant protein’s markedly decreased mitogenic and pro-inflammatory activity, while yet maintaining its potent antiviral capacity, binding properties of H84T and WT BanLec to monovalent sugars in solution were compared. The association constants (Ka) measured using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) for binding to methyl α-d-mannopyranoside were similar for recombinant His-tagged WT (383 mM−1) and H84T (353 mM−1) and were consistent with previous measurements for naturally occurring BanLec (333 mM−1) (Mo et al., 2001Mo H. Winter H.C. van Damme E.J. Peumans W.J. Misaki A. Goldstein I.J. Carbohydrate binding properties of banana (Musa acuminata) lectin I. Novel recognition of internal α1,3-linked glucosyl residues.Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2609-2615Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, Winter et al., 2005Winter H.C. Oscarson S. Slättegård R. Tian M. Goldstein I.J. Banana lectin is unique in its recognition of the reducing unit of 3-O-β-glucosyl/mannosyl disaccharides: a calorimetric study.Glycobiology. 2005; 15: 1043-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Interestingly, slightly weaker affinities were observed for H84T as compared to WT when analyzing binding to dimannoside (300 versus 227 mM−1 for WT and H84T, respectively) (Table S2). As mitogenicity involves cross-linking of distinct counterreceptors on cell surfaces that trigger outside-in signaling, the loss of mitogenicity seen with H84T and its slightly diminished binding affinity for disaccharides compared to monosaccharides suggested that the biological differences between the two proteins might arise due to the differences in their binding properties to more complex glycans. A simple assay that provides insight into binding to cell-surface glycans and cross-linking activity (here in trans, that is, between cells) is measuring lectin-induced aggregate formation of erythrocytes. The minimal concentrations for agglutination were found to be significantly different, i.e., at 3 and 437 μg/ml for WT and H84T, respectively (Table S2). This result reveals a marked disparity in building stable aggregates based on more than monovalent interactions with cell-surface mannosides. Synthetic glycoclusters are excellent tools that range in size from bivalent compounds to glycodendrimersomes (Murphy et al., 2013Murphy P.V. André S. Gabius H.-J. The third dimension of reading the sugar code by lectins: design of glycoclusters with cyclic scaffolds as tools with the aim to define correlations between spatial presentation and activity.Molecules. 2013; 18: 4026-4053Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, Solís et al., 2015Solís D.

Biophys. Acta. 2015; 1850: 186-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), so their locally increased density of ligands will trace a change in the interaction/association profile when testing WT and variant proteins under identical conditions. The association of a lectin with a ligand-bearing surface is sensitive to the presence of haptenic sugar, and its presentation in local clusters can enhance its inhibitory capacity. Mimicking the natural display of high-affinity ligands, synthetic glycoconjugates (carbohydrates attached to a scaffold enabling oligo- to polyvalency) thus are able to interfere with lectin binding to ligand-presenting surfaces in quantitative terms. The design of glycoclusters and the determination of their inhibitory activity on lectin binding (to glycoproteins or to a cell), measured as the inhibitory concentration (IC) at which the extent of lectin binding to a glycoligand is reduced by 50% (IC50 value), provide a measure of the avidity of a lectin for multivalent associations. In total, we tested a panel of 11 bi- to dodecavalent glycoclusters systematically in titrations in two types of assay, one biochemical and one cellular. In both cases, the mannose-specific lectin concanavalin A was used as positive control, and lectin binding to the glycan-presenting matrix was ascertained to be saturable and dependent on carbohydrate presence. First, we established a surface rich in presentation of mannose residues. A neoglycoprotein (a conjugate of albumin and mannose derivatives) was adsorbed to the plastic surface of microtiter plate wells, building the matrix for letting the biotinylated lectins dock. The surface-associated label was then quantitatively assessed spectrophotometrically. Titrations of the extent of binding with increasing amounts of inhibitor were performed to determine the IC50 value; the glycoclusters (Figure 3A) were individually tested. As demonstrated by the example shown in Figure 3B, these experiments allowed us to determine IC50 values as a measure for sensitivity of lectin binding in the presence of inhibitors. Binding of the H84T mutant was found to be much more susceptible to glycocluster inhibition than was surface contact formation of the WT BanLec, consistent with the lower cross-linking capacity in hema"
https://openalex.org/W2135307246,"Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) have been implicated in diverse biological roles including gene regulation and genomic imprinting. Identifying lncRNA in bovine across many differing tissue would contribute to the current repertoire of bovine lncRNA, and help further improve our understanding of the evolutionary importance and constraints of these transcripts. Additionally, it could aid in identifying sites in the genome outside of protein coding genes where mutations could contribute to variation in complex traits. This is particularly important in bovine as genomic predictions are increasingly used in genetic improvement for milk and meat production. Our aim was to identify and annotate novel long non coding RNA transcripts in the bovine genome captured from RNA Sequencing (RNA-Seq) data across 18 tissues, sampled in triplicate from a single cow. To address the main challenge in identifying lncRNA, namely distinguishing lncRNA transcripts from unannotated genes and protein coding genes, a lncRNA identification pipeline with a number of filtering steps was developed. A total of 9,778 transcripts passed the filtering pipeline. The bovine lncRNA catalogue includes MALAT1 and HOTAIR, both of which have been well described in human and mouse genomes. We attempted to validate the lncRNA in libraries from three additional cows. 726 (87.47%) liver and 1,668 (55.27%) blood class 3 lncRNA were validated with stranded liver and blood libraries respectively. Additionally, this study identified a large number of novel unknown transcripts in the bovine genome with high protein coding potential, illustrating a clear need for better annotations of protein coding genes."
https://openalex.org/W2217117822,"Primary Open Angle Glaucoma (POAG) is a common neurodegenerative disease characterized by the selective and gradual loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). Aging and increased intraocular pressure (IOP) are glaucoma risk factors; nevertheless patients deteriorate at all levels of IOP, implying other causative factors. Recent evidence presents mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complex-I impairments in POAG. Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON) patients suffer specific and rapid loss of RGCs, predominantly in young adult males, due to complex-I mutations in the mitochondrial genome. This study directly compares the degree of OXPHOS impairment in POAG and LHON patients, testing the hypothesis that the milder clinical disease in POAG is due to a milder complex-I impairment. To assess overall mitochondrial capacity, cells can be forced to produce ATP primarily from mitochondrial OXPHOS by switching the media carbon source to galactose. Under these conditions POAG lymphoblasts grew 1.47 times slower than controls, whilst LHON lymphoblasts demonstrated a greater degree of growth impairment (2.35 times slower). Complex-I enzyme specific activity was reduced by 18% in POAG lymphoblasts and by 29% in LHON lymphoblasts. We also assessed complex-I ATP synthesis, which was 19% decreased in POAG patients and 17% decreased in LHON patients. This study demonstrates both POAG and LHON lymphoblasts have impaired complex-I, and in the majority of aspects the functional defects in POAG were milder than LHON, which could reflect the milder disease development of POAG. This new evidence places POAG in the spectrum of mitochondrial optic neuropathies and raises the possibility for new therapeutic targets aimed at improving mitochondrial function."

Our findings suggest a therapeutic opportunity to stabilize this transition-state structure pharmacologically in ΔF508-CFTR to correct its opening defect, an essential step toward restoring CFTR function. The cystic fibrosis (CF) transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is the chloride ion channel mutated in patients suffering from CF, a devastating multiorgan disease (O’Sullivan and Freedman, 2009O’Sullivan B.P. Freedman S.D. Cystic fibrosis.Lancet. 2009; 373: 1891-1904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar). The majority (∼90%) of CF patients carry at least one allele with a deletion of phenylalanine 508 (ΔF508). The ΔF508 mutation severely impairs both surface expression (Cheng et al., 1990Cheng S.H.

Chem. 2010; 285: 19967-19975Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) of CFTR. Even if efforts to promote trafficking to the surface prove successful, understanding the molecular mechanism of the functional defect in ΔF508 CFTR will still be essential for its correction in CF patients. CFTR belongs to the family of ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporters (Riordan et al., 1989Riordan J.R. Rommens J.M. Kerem B. Alon N. Rozmahel R. Grzelczak Z. Zielenski J. Lok S. Plavsic N. Chou J.L. et al.Identification of the cystic fibrosis gene: cloning and characterization of complementary DNA.Science. 1989; 245: 1066-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (5925) Google Scholar), which are built from two homologous halves, each comprising a transmembrane domain (TMD) (Figures 1A and 1B , gray) followed by a cytosolic nucleotide binding domain (NBD) (Figures 1A and 1B, green and blue). In CFTR, these two halves (TMD1-NBD1 and TMD2-NBD2) are linked by the unique cytosolic regulatory (R) domain (Figure 1A, top, magenta), a target for phosphorylation by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) (Riordan et al., 1989Riordan J.R. Rommens J.M. Kerem B. Alon N. Rozmahel R. Grzelczak Z. Zielenski J. Lok S. Plavsic N. Chou J.L. et al.Identification of the cystic fibrosis gene: cloning and characterization of complementary DNA.Science. 1989; 245: 1066-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (5925) Google Scholar); R-domain phosphorylation is a prerequisite for CFTR chloride channel activity (Tabcharani et al., 1991Tabcharani J.A. Chang X.B. Riordan J.R. Hanrahan J.W. Phosphorylation-regulated Cl- channel in CHO cells stably expressing the cystic fibrosis gene.Nature. 1991; 352: 628-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Opening and closing (gating) of the CFTR chloride ion pore, formed by its TMDs, is coupled to a conserved ATP binding/hydrolysis cycle at the NBDs (Figure 1B). In ABC proteins, ATP binding triggers association of the two NBDs into a stable head-to-tail dimer that occludes two molecules of ATP (Figure 1B, yellow circles) at the interface (Smith et al., 2002Smith P.C. Karpowich N. Millen L. Moody J.E. Rosen J. Thomas P.J. Hunt J.F. ATP binding to the motor domain from an ABC transporter drives formation of a nucleotide sandwich dimer.Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 139-149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). By forming strong interactions with conserved residues of both the Walker motifs in the head of one NBD and the signature sequence in the tail of the opposing NBD, these ATP molecules act as molecular glue that ties the NBDs together: prompt dimer disruption therefore requires ATP hydrolysis (Moody et al., 2002Moody J.E. Millen L. Binns D. Hunt J.F. Thomas P.J. Cooperative, ATP-dependent association of the nucleotide binding cassettes during the catalytic cycle of ATP-binding cassette transporters.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21111-21114Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). In CFTR, only the composite binding site formed by Walker A and B motifs of NBD2 and the signature sequence of NBD1 (site 2; Figure 1B, upper site) is catalytically active; the other interfacial binding site (site 1; Figure 1B, lower site) is degenerate and keeps ATP bound and unhydrolyzed throughout several NBD dimerization cycles (Aleksandrov et al., 2002Aleksandrov L.

Physiol. 2003; 122: 333-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In ABC exporters, NBD dimer formation flips the TMDs to an outward-facing orientation, while dimer disruption following ATP hydrolysis and substrate release resets them to inward-facing; NBD-to-TMD signal transmission is mediated by an interface that includes four short “coupling helices” (CH1–4) (Locher, 2009Locher K.P. Review. Structure and mechanism of ATP-binding cassette transporters.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2009; 364: 239-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar) in TMD intracellular loops (Figure 1A, violet loops). In CFTR, NBD dimer formation initiates a burst of pore openings interrupted by brief closures, while dimer dissociation terminates the burst and returns the TMDs into a long-lasting nonconducting (interburst) state (Vergani et al., 2005Vergani P.

Functional studies confirm that in the bursting (“open”) state CFTR’s TMDs resemble the outward-facing, whereas in the interburst (“closed”) state they resemble the inward-facing conformation of ABC exporter TMDs (Bai et al., 2011Bai Y.

Chem. 2014; 289: 30364-30378Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). For wild-type (WT) CFTR gating is a unidirectional cycle: most openings are terminated by ATP hydrolysis (Figure 1B; step O1 → O2) rather than by far slower non-hydrolytic closure (Figure 1B; step O1 → C1; rate kOC) (Csanády et al., 2010Csanády L.

USA. 2010; 107: 1241-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The major functional defect of ΔF508 CFTR is a >40-fold reduction in opening rate (Miki et al., 2010Miki H. Zhou Z. Li M.

Fibros. 2014; 13: 508-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), which reflects destabilization—relative to the closed state—of the transition state for channel opening (step C1 → O1; Figure 1B; rate kCO). Insight into the dynamics of this opening conformational change and the structure of its transition state would be a key step forward in understanding the molecular mechanism of the ΔF508 gating defect. Transition states, which determine the rates of functionally relevant conformational movements, are the highest-energy, shortest-lived conformations of proteins. For instance, for ion channels closed ↔ open conformational transitions are so fast that they appear as single steps even in the highest time-resolution recordings, implying that the time the channel protein spends in the transition state itself is on the sub-microsecond scale—in contrast to the long (milliseconds-seconds) intervals spent in comparatively stable open and closed ground states observable in single-channel recordings (Figures 2A, 3A , 4A , and 5A ). Intractable by standard structural biological approaches, transition-state structures can be studied using rate-equilibrium free-energy relationship (REFER) analysis, which reports on the relative timing of movements in selected protein regions during a conformational transition, such as a channel opening step (Zhou et al., 2005Zhou Y.

Physiol. 2007; 130: 543-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Structural perturbations (typically point mutations) in a given channel region often change channel open probability (Po) by affecting the open-closed free-energy difference, but the extent to which the free energy of the barrier that must be traversed in opening or closing the channel is affected depends on how early or late that region moves. A region that moves early during opening will have already approached its open-state conformation in the overall transition state: a perturbation here thus affects the stability of the transition state to an extent similar to that of the open state and so impacts only opening, but not closing, rate. In contrast, a region that moves late during opening is still near its closed-state conformation in the transition state: a perturbation here that affects open-state stability thus does not affect transition-state stability and so impacts only closing, but not opening, rate. This relative timing of motion of a given region of the channel protein is reported by its Φ value, the slope of a log-log plot of opening rate (kCO) versus equilibrium constant (Keq = Po/(1 − Po)) for a series of structural perturbations (Brønsted plot): a large Φ value (close to 1) indicates early movement, and a small Φ value (close to 0) indicates late movement.Figure 3Timing of Motion at Position 275 of the NBD2-TMD InterfaceShow full caption(A) Inward single-channel currents of the cut-ΔR(D1370N) CFTR background construct (top trace) and of channels bearing mutations Y275F, Y275E, Y275K, Y275L, and Y275S, respectively, in the same background.

Here, we exploit a catalytic site mutation that abolishes ATP hydrolysis and so truncates the CFTR gating cycle to an equilibrium process. In this non-hydrolytic background, we employ the REFER technique to address the relative timing of movements within the sub-microsecond process of pore opening in three spatially distant positions distributed along the longitudinal axis (cytoplasmic to extracellular) of the CFTR protein. Our results identify a conformation-change wave with clear directionality and provide direct measurements that outline the global structure of the CFTR opening transition state.

To make CFTR gate at equilibrium, we introduced the NBD2 Walker-B mutation D1370N (Figure 1A, bottom, red star) because, among several hydrolysis-disrupting mutations tested, D1370N only slightly reduces the apparent affinity for ATP, and does not prolong open bursts to an extent incompatible with single-channel gating analysis (Csanády et al., 2010Csanády L.

USA. 2010; 107: 1241-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). PKA- and ATP-dependent regulation of CFTR gating are intertwined, and the mechanism of R-domain action is poorly understood: evidence exists for its direct interaction with both NBDs and TMDs (Wang et al., 2002Wang W. He Z. O’Shaughnessy T.J. Rux J. Reenstra W.W. Domain-domain associations in cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator.Am. J. Physiol.

USA. 2013; 110: E4427-E4436Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Thus, changes in gating kinetics caused by perturbations of a target position might potentially reflect altered R-domain/target position interactions, rather than energetic effects on ATP-dependent conformational transitions. Such confounding effects are absent in channels lacking the R domain: cut-ΔR channels, obtained by coexpression of TMD1-NBD1 (residues 1–633) and TMD2-NBD2 (residues 837–1480), do not require phosphorylation to be active, while ATP-dependent gating remains similar to WT (Csanády et al., 2000Csanády L.

Thus, ATP-dependence of Po reflects ATP-dependence of its mean interburst duration (τib). Importantly, in saturating (10 mM) ATP τib is minimal, and bursting of this background construct is reduced to a simple equilibrium (C1 ↔ O1; Figure 1B, red box; see histograms of burst and interburst durations in Figure S3) suitable for study by the REFER approach.Figure S2Time Constants of Macroscopic Current Relaxation following ATP Removal Corroborate Steady-State Single-Channel Estimates of τb, Related to Figures 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5Show full caption(A and D–G) Inward macroscopic currents of cut-ΔR(D1370N) CFTR (A), and of the same background construct harboring mutation T1246A (D), Y275F (E), M348K (F), or M348E (G), elicited by exposure to 10 mM MgATP (green bars).(B and C) Inward macroscopic currents of cut-ΔR(D1370N) CFTR evoked by repetitive exposures to 10 mM ATP in the alternating presence of various bath anions (gray/light-blue bars; chloride (Cl-), bromide (Br-), nitrate (Nt-), formate (Fm-)).

https://openalex.org/W2147511428,"Versatile peroxidase (VP) from the white-rot fungus Pleurotus eryngii is a high redox potential peroxidase of biotechnological interest able to oxidize a wide range of recalcitrant substrates including lignin, phenolic and non-phenolic aromatic compounds and dyes. However, the relatively low stability towards pH of this and other fungal peroxidases is a drawback for their industrial application. A strategy based on the comparative analysis of the crystal structures of VP and the highly pH-stable manganese peroxidase (MnP4) from Pleurotus ostreatus was followed to improve the VP pH stability. Several interactions, including hydrogen bonds and salt bridges, and charged residues exposed to the solvent were identified as putatively contributing to the pH stability of MnP4. The eight amino acid residues responsible for these interactions and seven surface basic residues were introduced into VP by directed mutagenesis. Furthermore, two cysteines were also included to explore the effect of an extra disulfide bond stabilizing the distal Ca2+ region. Three of the four designed variants were crystallized and new interactions were confirmed, being correlated with the observed improvement in pH stability. The extra hydrogen bonds and salt bridges stabilized the heme pocket at acidic and neutral pH as revealed by UV-visible spectroscopy. They led to a VP variant that retained a significant percentage of the initial activity at both pH 3.5 (61% after 24 h) and pH 7 (55% after 120 h) compared with the native enzyme, which was almost completely inactivated. The introduction of extra solvent-exposed basic residues and an additional disulfide bond into the above variant further improved the stability at acidic pH (85% residual activity at pH 3.5 after 24 h when introduced separately, and 64% at pH 3 when introduced together). The analysis of the results provides a rational explanation to the pH stability improvement achieved."
https://openalex.org/W1902139402,"Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS), a cancer characterized by features of skeletal muscle histogenesis, is the most common soft tissue sarcoma of childhood and adolescence. Survival for high-risk groups is less than 30% at 5 years. RMS also occurs during adulthood, with a lower incidence but higher mortality. Recently, mutational profiling has revealed a correlation between activating Ras mutations in the embryonal (eRMS) and pleomorphic (pRMS) histologic variants of RMS, and a poorer outcome for those patients. Independently, the YAP transcriptional coactivator, an oncoprotein kept in check by the Hippo tumor suppressor pathway, is upregulated in eRMS. Here we show that YAP promotes cell proliferation and antagonizes apoptosis and myogenic differentiation of human RMS cells bearing oncogenic Ras mutations in cell culture studies in vitro and in murine xenografts in vivo. Pharmacologic inhibition of YAP by the benzoporphyrin derivative verteporfin decreased cell proliferation and tumor growth in vivo. To interrogate the temporal contribution of YAP in eRMS tumorigenesis, we used a primary human cell-based genetic model of Ras-driven RMS. Constitutively active YAP functioned as an early genetic lesion, permitting bypass of senescence and priming myoblasts to tolerate subsequent expression of hTERT and oncogenic Ras, which were necessary and sufficient to generate murine xenograft tumors mimicking RMS in vivo. This work provides evidence for cooperation between YAP and oncogenic Ras in RMS tumorigenesis, laying the foundation for preclinical co-targeting of these pathways."

However, we currently have little understanding of the accuracy of such models, developed using limited data, of varying resolution. The aim of this study was to investigate the performance of predictive models constructed using non-simulated (real world) data of different resolution. Predicted distribution maps for three deep-sea habitats were constructed using MaxEnt modelling methods using high resolution multibeam bathymetric data and associated terrain derived variables as predictors. Model performance was evaluated using repeated 75/25 training/test data partitions using AUC and threshold-dependent assessment methods. The overall extent and distribution of each habitat, and the percentage contained within an existing MPA network were quantified and compared to results from low resolution GEBCO models. Predicted spatial extent for scleractinian coral reef and Syringammina fragilissima aggregations decreased with an increase in model resolution, whereas Pheronema carpenteri total suitable area increased. Distinct differences in predicted habitat distribution were observed for all three habitats. Estimates of habitat extent contained within the MPA network all increased when modelled at fine scale. High resolution models performed better than low resolution models according to threshold-dependent evaluation. We recommend the use of high resolution multibeam bathymetry data over low resolution bathymetry data for use in modelling approaches. We do not recommend the use of predictive models to produce absolute values of habitat extent, but likely areas of suitable habitat. Assessments of MPA network effectiveness based on calculations of percentage area protection (policy driven conservation targets) from low resolution models are likely to be fit for purpose."

Little is known about BPA in relation to thyroid volume and structure.We examined the association of BPA with thyroid volume and thyroid nodules using data from 718 Chinese children living in the East Coast of China in 2012. First morning urine samples were collected for the determination of urinary BPA, creatinine, and urinary iodine concentrations (UIC). Thyroid volume (TV) and nodules were assessed by thyroid ultrasonography.The median of TV was 3.14ml. 459(63.9%) children took iodized salt at home and the median of UIC was 159μg/l. BPA was detected in 99.9% of the urine samples and the medians for boys and girls were 2.64 and 2.35μg/g creatinine, respectively. Of all participants 14.0% had thyroid nodules. Urinary BPA concentration was inversely associated with thyroid volume (β = -0.033, 95% CI: -0.053, -0.013) and the risk for multiple nodules (OR = 0.78; 95% CI: 0.63, 0.97). The associations above were similar for children who consumed iodized salt and those consumed non-iodized salt.The data suggest that BPA may be one of the influencing factors for TV and thyroid nodules and its effects are independent of iodine nutrition status in children."
https://openalex.org/W2122750665,"Forkhead box L2 (FOXL2) is a member of the forkhead nuclear factor 3 gene family and plays an essential role in ovarian growth and maturation in mammals. However, its potential effects and regulative mechanism in development of chicken ovarian prehierarchical follicles remain unexplored. In this study, the cooperative effects of FOXL2 with activin A, growth differentiation factor-9 (GDF9) and follistatin, three members of the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) superfamily that were previously suggested to exert a critical role in follicle development was investigated. We demonstrated herein, using in-situ hybridization, Northern blot and immunohistochemical analyses of oocytes and granulosa cells in various sizes of prehierarchical follicles that both FOXL2 transcripts and FOXL2 proteins are predominantly expressed in a highly similar expression pattern to that of GDF9 gene. In addition, the FOXL2 transcript was found at lower levels in theca cells in the absence of GDF9. Furthermore, culture of granulosa cells (GCs) from the prehierarchical follicles (6-8 mm) in conditioned medium revealed that in the pcDNA3.0-FOXL2 transfected GCs, there was a more dramatic increase in FSHR mRNA expression after treatment with activin A (10 ng/ml) or GDF9 (100 ng/ml) for 24 h which caused a stimulatory effect on the GC proliferation. In contrast, a significant decrease of FSHR mRNA was detected after treatment with follistatin (50 ng/ml) and resulted in an inhibitory effect on the cell proliferation. The results of this suggested that FOXL2 plays a bidirectional modulating role involved in the intracellular FSHR transcription and GC proliferation via an autocrine regulatory mechanism in a positive or negative manner through cooperation with activin A and/or GDF9, and follistatin in the hen follicle development. This cooperative action may be mediated by the examined Smad signals and simultaneously implicated in modulation of the StAR, CCND2, and CYP11A1 expression."
https://openalex.org/W2161876355,"RNA silencing controls endogenous gene expression and drives defensive reactions against invasive nucleic acids like viruses. In plants, it has been demonstrated that RNA silencing can be transmitted through grafting between scions and silenced rootstocks to attenuate virus and viroid accumulation in the scions. This has been obtained mostly using transgenic plants, which may be a drawback in current agriculture. In the present study, we examined the dynamics of infection of a resistance-breaking strain of Tomato spotted wilt virus (RB-TSWV) through the graft between an old Apulian (southern Italy) tomato variety, denoted Sl-Ma, used as a rootstock and commercial tomato varieties used as scions. In tests with non-grafted plants, Sl-Ma showed resistance to the RB-TSWV infection as viral RNA accumulated at low levels and plants recovered from disease symptoms by 21 days post inoculation. The resistance trait was transmitted to the otherwise highly susceptible tomato genotypes grafted onto Sl-Ma. The results from the analysis of small RNAs hallmark genes involved in RNA silencing and virus-induced gene silencing suggest that RNA silencing is involved in the resistance showed by Sl-Ma against RB-TSWV and in scions grafted on this rootstock. The results from self-grafted susceptible tomato varieties suggest also that RNA silencing is enhanced by the graft itself. We can foresee interesting practical implications of the approach described in this paper."

We find conformational selection and thus dynamic contributions to be a key player in biomolecular recognition. Arising entropic contributions complement chemical intuition primarily reflecting enthalpic interaction patterns.

We evaluated lung functional impairment and persistent respiratory symptoms in those with prior pulmonary TB and those with prior pulmonary TB with no residual sequelae on CXR, and determined risk factors for airflow obstruction. Methods We used data from adults aged ≥ 40 years from the annual Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys conducted between 2008 and 2012. P values for comparisons were adjusted for age, sex, and smoking status. Results In total of 14,967 adults, 822 subjects (5.5%) had diagnosed and treated pulmonary TB (mean 29.0 years ago). The FVC% (84.9 vs. 92.6), FEV1% (83.4 vs. 92.4), and FEV1/FVC% (73.4 vs. 77.9) were significantly decreased in subjects with prior pulmonary TB compared to those without (p < 0.001, each). In 12,885 subjects with no sequalae on CXR, those with prior pulmonary TB (296, 2.3%) had significantly lower FEV1% (90.9 vs. 93.4, p = 0.001) and FEV1/FVC% (76.6 vs. 78.4, p < 0.001) than those without. Subjects with prior pulmonary TB as well as subjects with no sequalae on CXR were more likely to experience cough and physical activity limitations due to pulmonary symptoms than those without prior pulmonary TB (p < 0.001, each). In total subjects, prior pulmonary TB (OR, 2.314; 95% CI, 1.922–2.785), along with age, male, asthma, and smoking mount was risk factor for airflow obstruction. In subjects with prior pulmonary tuberculosis, inactive TB lesion on chest x-ray (OR, 2.300; 95% CI, 1.606–3.294) were risk factors of airflow obstruction. Conclusion In addition to subjects with inactive TB lesion on CXR, subjects with no sequelae on CXR can show impaired pulmonary function and respiratory symptoms. Prior TB is a risk factor for airflow obstruction and that the risk is more important when they have inactive lesions on chest X-ray. Hence, the patients with treated TB should need to have regular follow-up of lung function and stop smoking for early detection and prevention of the chronic airway disease."
https://openalex.org/W1832975556,"The packaging of DNA into nucleosomes and the organisation into higher order structures of chromatin limits the access of sequence specific DNA binding factors to DNA. In cells, DNA methylation is preferentially occuring in the linker region of nucleosomes, suggesting a structural impact of chromatin on DNA methylation. These observations raise the question whether DNA methyltransferases are capable to recognize the nucleosomal substrates and to modify the packaged DNA. Here, we performed a detailed analysis of nucleosome binding and nucleosomal DNA methylation by the maintenance DNA methyltransferase Dnmt1. Our binding studies show that Dnmt1 has a DNA length sensing activity, binding cooperatively to DNA, and requiring a minimal DNA length of 20 bp. Dnmt1 needs linker DNA to bind to nucleosomes and most efficiently recognizes nucleosomes with symmetric DNA linkers. Footprinting experiments reveal that Dnmt1 binds to both DNA linkers exiting the nucleosome core. The binding pattern correlates with the efficient methylation of DNA linkers. However, the enzyme lacks the ability to methylate nucleosomal CpG sites on mononucleosomes and nucleosomal arrays, unless chromatin remodeling enzymes create a dynamic chromatin state. In addition, our results show that Dnmt1 functionally interacts with specific chromatin remodeling enzymes to enable complete methylation of hemi-methylated DNA in chromatin."
https://openalex.org/W2104771393,"Visual scanning of faces in individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) has been intensively studied using eye-tracking technology. However, most of studies have relied on the same analytic approach based on the quantification of fixation time, which may have failed to reveal some important features of the scanning strategies employed by individuals with ASD. In the present study, we examined the scanning of faces in a group of 20 preschoolers with ASD and their typically developing (TD) peers, using both classical fixation time approach and a new developed approach based on transition matrices and network analysis. We found between group differences in the eye region in terms of fixation time, with increased right eye fixation time for the ASD group and increased left eye fixation time for the TD group. Our complementary network approach revealed that the left eye might play the role of an anchor in the scanning strategies of TD children but not in that of children with ASD.

Our study highlights the importance of developing innovative measures that bear the potential of revealing new properties of the scanning strategies employed by individuals with ASD."
https://openalex.org/W2248944914,"Interleukin 17-producing helper T (Th17) cells have been widely defined by the lineage transcription factor retinoid-related orphan receptor (ROR)γt. Pathophysiologically, these cells play a crucial role in autoimmune diseases and have been linked to dysregulated germinal center (GC) reactions and autoantibody production. In this study, we used gene expression and flow cytometric analyses for the characterization of Rorγt(-/-) and Rorγt(-/-)Il21(RFP/+) mice to demonstrate a previously unknown transcriptional flexibility in the development of IL-17-producing Th-cell subsets. We found an accumulation of follicular Th (Tfh) cells by 5.2-fold, spontaneous 13-fold higher GC formation, decreased frequency of follicular Foxp3(+) T-regulatory (Treg) cells (50%), and a 3.4-fold increase in the number of proliferating follicular B cells in RORγt-deficient vs. wild-type mice. Dysregulated B-cell responses were associated with enhanced production of IL-17 (6.4-fold), IL-21 (2.2-fold), and B-cell-activating factor (BAFF) (2-fold) and were partially rescued by adoptive transfer of Treg cells. In an unexpected finding, we detected RORγt-independent IL-17 expression in ICOS(+)CXCR5(+)Tfh and in ICOS(+)CXCR5(-)Th cells. Based on the observed high Irf4 and Batf gene expression, we suggest that CD4(+) T-cell transcription factors other than RORγt can cooperatively induce differentiation of IL-17-producing Th cells, including Th17-like Tfh-cell subsets. We conclude that the occurrence of aberrant Tfh and follicular Treg cells support spontaneous GC formation and dysregulated B-cell responses in RORγt-deficient mice."
https://openalex.org/W2103136667,"Allele-specific gene expression associated with genetic variation in regulatory regions can play an important role in the development of complex traits. We hypothesized that polymorphisms in microRNA (miRNA) response elements (MRE-SNPs) that either disrupt a miRNA binding site or create a new miRNA binding site can affect the allele-specific expression of target genes. By integrating public expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) data, miRNA binding site predictions, small RNA sequencing, and Argonaute crosslinking immunoprecipitation (AGO-CLIP) datasets, we identified genetic variants that can affect gene expression by modulating miRNA binding efficiency. We also identified MRE-SNPs located in regions associated with complex traits, indicating possible causative mechanisms associated with these loci. The results of this study expand the current understanding of gene expression regulation and help to interpret the mechanisms underlying eQTL effects."
https://openalex.org/W1872996651,"Acinetobacter baumannii is becoming an increasing menace in health care settings especially in the intensive care units due to its ability to withstand adverse environmental conditions and exhibit innate resistance to different classes of antibiotics. Here we describe the biological contributions of abeD, a novel membrane transporter in bacterial stress response and antimicrobial resistance in A. baumannii.The abeD mutant displayed ~ 3.37 fold decreased survival and >5-fold reduced growth in hostile osmotic (0.25 M; NaCl) and oxidative (2.631 μM-6.574 μM; H2O2) stress conditions respectively. The abeD inactivated cells displayed increased susceptibility to ceftriaxone, gentamicin, rifampicin and tobramycin (~ 4.0 fold). The mutant displayed increased sensitivity to the hospital-based disinfectant benzalkonium chloride (~3.18-fold). In Caenorhabditis elegans model, the abeD mutant exhibited (P<0.01) lower virulence capability. Binding of SoxR on the regulatory fragments of abeD provide strong evidence for the involvement of SoxR system in regulating the expression of abeD in A. baumannii.This study demonstrates the contributions of membrane transporter AbeD in bacterial physiology, stress response and antimicrobial resistance in A. baumannii for the first time."
https://openalex.org/W2099357515,"Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a fatal, rapidly progressive neurodegenerative disease with (oligodendro-)glial cytoplasmic α-synuclein (α-syn) inclusions (GCIs). Peripheral neuropathies have been reported in up to 40% of MSA patients, the cause remaining unclear. In a transgenic MSA mouse model featuring GCI-like inclusion pathology based on PLP-promoter driven overexpression of human α-syn in oligodendroglia motor and non-motor deficits are associated with MSA-like neurodegeneration. Since α-syn is also expressed in Schwann cells we aimed to investigate whether peripheral nerves are anatomically and functionally affected in the PLP-α-syn MSA mouse model.To this end, heat/cold as well as mechanical sensitivity tests were performed. Furthermore, in vivo and ex vivo nerve conduction and the G-ratios of the sciatic nerve were analyzed, and thermosensitive ion channel mRNA expression in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) was assessed. The presence of human α-syn in Schwann cells was associated with subtle behavioral impairments. The G-ratio of the sciatic nerve, the conduction velocity of myelinated and unmyelinated primary afferents and the expression of thermosensitive ion channels in the sensory neurons, however, were similar to wildtype mice.Our results suggest that the PNS appears to be affected by Schwann cell α-syn deposits in the PLP-α-syn MSA mouse model. However, there was no consistent evidence for functional PNS perturbations resulting from such α-syn aggregates suggesting a more central cause of the observed behavioral abnormalities. Nonetheless, our results do not exclude a causal role of α-syn in the pathogenesis of MSA associated peripheral neuropathy."
https://openalex.org/W2111746953,"The recently declared Australian Commonwealth Marine Reserve (CMR) Network covers a total of 3.1 million km2 of continental shelf, slope, and abyssal habitat. Managing and conserving the biodiversity values within this network requires knowledge of the physical and biological assets that lie within its boundaries. Unfortunately very little is known about the habitats and biological assemblages of the continental shelf within the network, where diversity is richest and anthropogenic pressures are greatest. Effective management of the CMR estate into the future requires this knowledge gap to be filled efficiently and quantitatively. The challenge is particularly great for the shelf as multibeam echosounder (MBES) mapping, a key tool for identifying and quantifying habitat distribution, is time consuming in shallow depths, so full coverage mapping of the CMR shelf assets is unrealistic in the medium-term. Here we report on the results of a study undertaken in the Flinders Commonwealth Marine Reserve (southeast Australia) designed to test the benefits of two approaches to characterising shelf habitats: (i) MBES mapping of a continuous (~30 km2) area selected on the basis of its potential to include a range of seabed habitats that are potentially representative of the wider area, versus; (ii) a novel approach that uses targeted mapping of a greater number of smaller, but spatially balanced, locations using a Generalized Random Tessellation Stratified sample design. We present the first quantitative estimates of habitat type and sessile biological communities on the shelf of the Flinders reserve, the former based on three MBES analysis techniques. We contrast the quality of information that both survey approaches offer in combination with the three MBES analysis methods. The GRTS approach enables design based estimates of habitat types and sessile communities and also identifies potential biodiversity hotspots in the northwest corner of the reserve’s IUCN zone IV, and in locations close to shelf incising canyon heads. Design based estimates of habitats, however, vary substantially depending on the MBES analysis technique, highlighting the challenging nature of the reserve’s low profile reefs, and improvements that are needed when acquiring MBES data for small GRTS locations. We conclude that the two survey approaches are complementary and both have their place in a successful and flexible monitoring strategy; the emphasis on one method over the other should be considered on a case by case basis, taking into account the survey objectives and limitations imposed by the type of vessel, time available, size and location of the region where knowledge is required."
https://openalex.org/W2149605575,"Pain-related anxiety and fear are associated with increased difficulties in attention, increased awareness of pain, impaired disengagement from pain, and can moderate the effects of attentional coping attempts. Accurately assessing the direct impact of pain-related anxiety and fear on pain behavior has proved difficult. Studies have demonstrated no or limited influence of pain-related fear and anxiety on behavior but this may be due to inherent problems with the scales used. Neuroimaging has improved the understanding of neural processes underlying the factors that influence pain perception. This study aimed to establish if a Picture and Imagination Task (PIT), largely developed from the Photographs of Daily Activity (PHODA) assessment tool, could help explore how people living with chronic pain process information about daily activities. Blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to compare brain responses in patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain (CMSKP) (n = 15) and healthy controls (n = 15). Subjects were asked to imagine how they would feel mentally and physically if asked to perform daily activities illustrated in PIT. The results found that a number of regions involved in pain processing saw increased BOLD activation in patients compared with controls when undertaking the task and included the insula, anterior cingulate cortex, thalamus and inferior and superior parietal cortices. Similarly, increased BOLD responses in patients compared to controls in the frontal pole, paracingulate and the supplementary motor cortex may be suggestive of a memory component to the responses The amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex, substantia nigra/ventral tegmentum, putamen, thalamus, pallidum, inferior parietal (supramarginal and angular gyrus) and cingulate cortex were also seen to have greater differences in BOLD signal changes in patients compared with controls and many of these regions are also associated with general phobic responses. Therefore, we suggest that PIT is a useful task to explore pain- and movement-related anxiety and fear in fMRI studies. Regions in the Default Mode Network remained active or were less deactivated during the PIT task in patients with CMSKP compared to healthy controls supporting the contention that the DMN is abnormal in patients with CMSKP."
https://openalex.org/W2125331749,"Non-thermal plasma (NTP) has been introduced over the last few years as a promising after- treatment system for nitrogen oxides and particulate matter removal from diesel exhaust. NTP technology has not been commercialised as yet, due to its high rate of energy consumption. Therefore, it is important to seek out new methods to improve NTP performance. Residence time is a crucial parameter in engine exhaust emissions treatment. In this paper, different electrode shapes are analysed and the corresponding residence time and NOx removal efficiency are studied. An axisymmetric laminar model is used for obtaining residence time distribution numerically using FLUENT software. If the mean residence time in a NTP plasma reactor increases, there will be a corresponding increase in the reaction time and consequently the pollutant removal efficiency increases. Three different screw thread electrodes and a rod electrode are examined. The results show the advantage of screw thread electrodes in comparison with the rod electrode. Furthermore, between the screw thread electrodes, the electrode with the thread width of 1 mm has the highest NOx removal due to higher residence time and a greater number of micro-discharges. The results show that the residence time of the screw thread electrode with a thread width of 1 mm is 21% more than for the rod electrode."
https://openalex.org/W1869033358,"The phylogeny of symbiotic genes of Astragalus glycyphyllos L. (liquorice milkvetch) nodule isolates was studied by comparative sequence analysis of nodA, nodC, nodH and nifH loci. In all these genes phylograms, liquorice milkvetch rhizobia (closely related to bacteria of three species, i.e. Mesorhizobium amorphae, Mesorhizobium septentrionale and Mesorhizobium ciceri) formed one clearly separate cluster suggesting the horizontal transfer of symbiotic genes from a single ancestor to the bacteria being studied. The high sequence similarity of the symbiotic genes of A. glycyphyllos rhizobia (99-100% in the case of nodAC and nifH genes, and 98-99% in the case of nodH one) points to the relatively recent (in evolutionary scale) lateral transfer of these genes. In the nodACH and nifH phylograms, A. glycyphyllos nodule isolates were grouped together with the genus Mesorhizobium species in one monophyletic clade, close to M. ciceri, Mesorhizobium opportunistum and Mesorhizobium australicum symbiovar biserrulae bacteria, which correlates with the close relationship of these rhizobia host plants. Plant tests revealed the narrow host range of A. glycyphyllos rhizobia. They formed effective symbiotic interactions with their native host (A. glycyphyllos) and Amorpha fruticosa but not with 11 other fabacean species. The nodules induced on A. glycyphyllos roots were indeterminate with apical, persistent meristem, an age gradient of nodule tissues and cortical vascular bundles. To reflect the symbiosis-adaptive phenotype of rhizobia, specific for A. glycyphyllos, we propose for these bacteria the new symbiovar ""glycyphyllae"", based on nodA and nodC genes sequences."
https://openalex.org/W2102677772,"Microblogging as a kind of social network has become more and more important in our daily lives. Enormous amounts of information are produced and shared on a daily basis. Detecting hot topics in the mountains of information can help people get to the essential information more quickly. However, due to short and sparse features, a large number of meaningless tweets and other characteristics of microblogs, traditional topic detection methods are often ineffective in detecting hot topics. In this paper, we propose a new topic model named multi-attribute latent dirichlet allocation (MA-LDA), in which the time and hashtag attributes of microblogs are incorporated into LDA model. By introducing time attribute, MA-LDA model can decide whether a word should appear in hot topics or not. Meanwhile, compared with the traditional LDA model, applying hashtag attribute in MA-LDA model gives the core words an artificially high ranking in results meaning the expressiveness of outcomes can be improved. Empirical evaluations on real data sets demonstrate that our method is able to detect hot topics more accurately and efficiently compared with several baselines. Our method provides strong evidence of the importance of the temporal factor in extracting hot topics."

Soil physical and chemical properties in various sizes and development stages were studied in C. kawakamii natural forest gaps. The results showed that forest gaps in various sizes and development stages could improve soil pore space structure and water characteristics, which may effectively promote the water absorbing capacity for plant root growth and play an important role in forest regeneration. Soil pore space structure and water characteristics in small gaps showed more obvious improvements, followed by the medium and large gaps. Soil pore space structure and water characteristics in the later development stage of forest gaps demonstrated more obvious improvements, followed by the early and medium development stages. The contents of hydrolysable N and available K in various sizes and development stages of forest gaps were higher than those of non-gaps, whereas the contents of total N, total P, available P, organic matter, and organic carbon were lower. The contents of total N, hydrolysable N, available K, organic matter, and organic carbon in medium gaps were higher than those of large and small gaps. The disturbance of forest gaps could improve the soils' physical and chemical properties and increase the population species' richness, which would provide an ecological basis for the species coexistence in C. kawakamii natural forest."
https://openalex.org/W2131928539,"Objective The present study aims to investigate whether a newly developed fast fMRI called MREG (magnetic resonance encephalography) measures metabolic changes related to interictal epileptic discharges (IED). For this purpose BOLD changes are correlated with the IED distribution and variability. Methods Patients with focal epilepsy underwent EEG-MREG using a 64 channel cap. IED voltage maps were generated using 32 and 64 channels and compared regarding their correspondence to the BOLD response. The extents of IEDs (defined as number of channels with >50% of maximum IED negativity) were correlated with the extents of positive and negative BOLD responses. Differences in inter-spike variability were investigated between interictal epileptic discharges (IED) sets with and without concordant positive or negative BOLD responses. Results 17 patients showed 32 separate IED types. In 50% of IED types the BOLD changes could be confirmed by another independent imaging method. The IED extent significantly correlated with the positive BOLD extent (p = 0.04). In 6 patients the 64-channel EEG voltage maps better reflected the positive or negative BOLD response than the 32-channel EEG; in all others no difference was seen. Inter-spike variability was significantly lower in IED sets with than without concordant positive or negative BOLD responses (with p = 0.04). Significance Higher density EEG and fast fMRI seem to improve the value of EEG-fMRI in epilepsy. The correlation of positive BOLD and IED extent could suggest that widespread BOLD responses reflect the IED network. Inter-spike variability influences the likelihood to find IED concordant positive or negative BOLD responses, which is why single IED analysis may be promising."
https://openalex.org/W2132386892,"2'-Methoxy-6-methylflavone (2'MeO6MF) is an anxiolytic flavonoid which has been shown to display GABAA receptor (GABAAR) β2/3-subunit selectivity, a pharmacological profile similar to that of the general anaesthetic etomidate. Electrophysiological studies suggest that the full agonist action of 2'MeO6MF at α2β3γ2L GABAARs may mediate the flavonoid's in vivo effects. However, we found variations in the relative efficacy of 2'MeO6MF (2'MeO6MF-elicited current responses normalised to the maximal GABA response) at α2β3γ2L GABAARs due to the presence of mixed receptor populations. To understand which receptor subpopulation(s) underlie the variations observed, we conducted a systematic investigation of 2'MeO6MF activity at all receptor combinations that could theoretically form (α2, β3, γ2L, α2β3, α2γ2L, β3γ2L and α2β3γ2L) in Xenopus oocytes using the two-electrode voltage clamp technique. We found that 2'MeO6MF activated non-α-containing β3γ2L receptors. In an attempt to establish the optimal conditions to express a uniform population of these receptors, we found that varying the relative amounts of β3:γ2L subunit mRNAs resulted in differences in the level of constitutive activity, the GABA concentration-response relationships, and the relative efficacy of 2'MeO6MF activation. Like 2'MeO6MF, general anaesthetics such as etomidate and propofol also showed distinct levels of relative efficacy across different injection ratios. Based on these results, we infer that β3γ2L receptors may form with different subunit stoichiometries, resulting in the complex pharmacology observed across different injection ratios. Moreover, the discovery that GABA and etomidate have direct actions at the α-lacking β3γ2L receptors raises questions about the structural requirements for their respective binding sites at GABAARs."
https://openalex.org/W1884807551,"Many studies show large differences in life expectancy across the range of education, intelligence, and socio-economic status. As educational attainment, intelligence, and socio-economic status are highly interrelated, appropriate methods are required to disentangle their separate effects. The aim of this paper is to present a novel method to estimate gains in life expectancy specifically associated with increased education. Our analysis is based on a structural model in which education level, IQ at age 18 and mortality all depend on (latent) intelligence. The model allows for (selective) educational choices based on observed factors and on an unobserved factor capturing intelligence. Our estimates are based on information from health examinations of military conscripts born in 1944-1947 in The Netherlands and their vital status through age 66 (n = 39,798).Our empirical results show that men with higher education have lower mortality. Using structural models to account for education choice, the estimated gain in life expectancy for men moving up one educational level ranges from 0.3 to 2 years. The estimated gain in months alive over the observational period ranges from -1.2 to 5.7 months. The selection effect is positive and amounts to a gain of one to two months. Decomposition of the selection effect shows that the gain from selection on (latent) intelligence is larger than the gain from selection on observed factors and amounts to 1.0 to 1.7 additional months alive.Our findings confirm the strong selection into education based on socio-economic status and intelligence. They also show significant higher life expectancy among individuals with higher education after the selectivity of education choice has been taken into account. Based on these estimates, it is plausible therefore that increases in education could lead to increases in life expectancy."
https://openalex.org/W2149974028,"Infantile hemangioma (IH) is the most common tumor of the pediatric age group, affecting up to 4% of newborns ranging from inconsequential blemishes, to highly aggressive tumors. Following well defined growth phases (proliferative, plateau involutional) IH usually regress into a fibro-fatty residuum. Despite the high prevalence of IH, little is known regarding the pathogenesis of disease. A reported six fold decrease in IGF2 expression (correlating with transformation of proliferative to involuted lesions) prompted us to study the IGF-2 axis further. We demonstrate that IGF2 expression in IH is strongly related to the expression of a cancer testes and suspected oncogene BORIS (paralog of CTCF), placing IH in the unique category of being the first known benign BORIS positive tumor. IGF2 expression was strongly and positively related to BORIS transcript expression. Furthermore, a stronger association was made when comparing BORIS levels against the expression of CTCF via either a percentage or difference between the two. A common C/T polymorphism at CTCF BS6 appeared to modify the correlation between CTCF/BORIS and IGF2 expression in a parent of origin specific manner. Moreover, these effects may have phenotypic consequences as tumor growth also correlates with the genotype at CTCF BS6. This may provide a framework for explaining the clinical variability seen in IH and suggests new insights regarding CTCF and BORIS related functionality in both normal and malignant states."

The present manuscript analyses the epidemiological and laboratory characteristics of this outbreak, identifies its main causes and suggests potential future preventive measures. Sera of 133 patients were tested for mumps-specific antibodies by ELISA and 15 nose/throat swabs were investigated for mumps virus RNA by RT-PCR. IgG antibodies were found in 127 patients (95.5%). Mumps infection was laboratory-confirmed in 53 patients, including 44 IgM and 9 PCR positive cases. All other 282 cases were classified as epidemiologically-confirmed. More than half of the patients (n = 181, 54%) were 20–29 years old, followed by the 15–19 age bracket (n = 95, 28.4%). Twice as many males as females were affected (67% versus 33%). Disease complications were reported in 13 cases (3.9%), including 9 patients with orchitis and 4 with pancreatitis. According to medical records or anamnestic data, 190 patients (56.7%) were immunized with two doses and 35 (10.4%) with one dose of mumps-containing vaccine. The Serbian sequences corresponded to a minor genotype G variant detected during the 2011/2012 mumps outbreak in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Vaccine failures, the initial one-dose immunization policy and a vaccine shortage between 1999 and 2002 contributed to the outbreak. Additional vaccination opportunities should be offered to young adults during transition periods in their life trajectories."

A nonlinear and multi-objective optimization model is proposed and tackled using a particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO). It is found that the network becomes more robust and economical when less capacity is left on the heavily loaded nodes and the optimized network performs better resisting noise. Our work is helpful in designing a robust economical network."
https://openalex.org/W2224469214,"In this paper, we present a systematic transition scheme for a large class of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) into Boolean networks. Our transition scheme can be applied to any system of ODEs whose right hand sides can be written as sums and products of monotone functions. It performs an Euler-like step which uses the signs of the right hand sides to obtain the Boolean update functions for every variable of the corresponding discrete model. The discrete model can, on one hand, be considered as another representation of the biological system or, alternatively, it can be used to further the analysis of the original ODE model. Since the generic transformation method does not guarantee any property conservation, a subsequent validation step is required. Depending on the purpose of the model this step can be based on experimental data or ODE simulations and characteristics. Analysis of the resulting Boolean model, both on its own and in comparison with the ODE model, then allows to investigate system properties not accessible in a purely continuous setting. The method is exemplarily applied to a previously published model of the bovine estrous cycle, which leads to new insights regarding the regulation among the components, and also indicates strongly that the system is tailored to generate stable oscillations."

Our proposal clarifies the relationship between economic and psychological definitions of rationality and rationalizes several behaviors heretofore judged irrational by behavioral economists."
https://openalex.org/W2234736434,"During neural circuit development, attractive or repulsive guidance cue molecules direct growth cones (GCs) to their targets by eliciting cytoskeletal remodeling, which is reflected in their morphology. The experimental power of in vitro neuronal cultures to assay this process and its molecular mechanisms is well established, however, a method to rapidly find and quantify multiple morphological aspects of GCs is lacking. To this end, we have developed a free, easy to use, and fully automated Fiji macro, Conographer, which accurately identifies and measures many morphological parameters of GCs in 2D explant culture images. These measurements are then subjected to principle component analysis and k-means clustering to mathematically classify the GCs as ""collapsed"" or ""extended"". The morphological parameters measured for each GC are found to be significantly different between collapsed and extended GCs, and are sufficient to classify GCs as such with the same level of accuracy as human observers. Application of a known collapse-inducing ligand results in significant changes in all parameters, resulting in an increase in 'collapsed' GCs determined by k-means clustering, as expected. Our strategy provides a powerful tool for exploring the relationship between GC morphology and guidance cue signaling, which in particular will greatly facilitate high-throughput studies of the effects of drugs, gene silencing or overexpression, or any other experimental manipulation in the context of an in vitro axon guidance assay."
https://openalex.org/W2221711244,"Mannuronan C-5 epimerases are a family of enzymes that catalyze epimerization of alginates at the polymer level. This group of enzymes thus enables the tailor-making of various alginate residue sequences to attain various functional properties, e.g. viscosity, gelation and ion binding. Here, the interactions between epimerases AlgE4 and AlgE6 and alginate substrates as well as epimerization products were determined. The interactions of the various epimerase-polysaccharide pairs were determined over an extended range of force loading rates by the combined use of optical tweezers and atomic force microscopy. When studying systems that in nature are not subjected to external forces the access to observations obtained at low loading rates, as provided by optical tweezers, is a great advantage since the low loading rate region for these systems reflect the properties of the rate limiting energy barrier. The AlgE epimerases have a modular structure comprising both A and R modules, and the role of each of these modules in the epimerization process were examined through studies of the A- module of AlgE6, AlgE6A. Dynamic strength spectra obtained through combination of atomic force microscopy and the optical tweezers revealed the existence of two energy barriers in the alginate-epimerase complexes, of which one was not revealed in previous AFM based studies of these complexes. Furthermore, based on these spectra estimates of the locations of energy transition states (xβ), lifetimes in the absence of external perturbation (τ0) and free energies (ΔG#) were determined for the different epimerase-alginate complexes. This is the first determination of ΔG# for these complexes. The values determined were up to 8 kBT for the outer barrier, and smaller values for the inner barriers. The size of the free energies determined are consistent with the interpretation that the enzyme and substrate are thus not tightly locked at all times but are able to relocate. Together with the observed different affinities determined for AlgE4-polymannuronic acid (poly-M) and AlgE4-polyalternating alginate (poly-MG) macromolecular pairs these data give important contribution to the growing understanding of the mechanisms underlying the processive mode of these enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W2253222328,"Background It is observed that combined liver and colon surgery especially when this includes major liver resection with Pringle maneuver (PM) performance does not have a favorable outcome. Aim of our experimental study is to investigate the impact of portal triad occlusion on the large bowel and intra-abdominal inflammation and potent protective effects of the variants of (PM) in the combined surgical cases. Materials and Methods Forty-four rats were divided into four groups. In group A (control group), 1cm of the left partial colon was resected and then an end-to-end anastomosis was performed. In group B, a continuous PM for 30 minutes was performed followed by resection of 1cm of the left colon and an end-to-end anastomosis. In group C, the left colonic resection and anastomosis was performed after intermittent PM (IPM), which was 10 minutes PM followed by 5 minutes reperfusion repeated for three circles. In group D, an ischemic preconditioning for 10 minutes was initially performed followed by 5 minutes reperfusion and then continuous PM for 30 minutes. Finally the rats in group D underwent a 1cm left colonic resection and an end-to-end anastomosis. Results The percentage of colitis was higher in the B group (P = 0,19). The percentage of inflammation was not significantly higher even when we compared all “occlusion” groups (B+C+D) with the sham group. No evidence of pancreatitis was found in the sham group whereas amylase and lipase levels were higher in Groups B, C and D together (P = 0,0267). The comparison of group A to group B showed a significant difference (P = 0,0014) caused by continuous PM for 30 minutes, but there was no such result after IPM. Conclusions Major liver resections are performed with PM in order to minimize intra-operative blood loss. In the combined cases of colon surgery and major liver resections where PM is needed our results showed that IPM presents with better outcome and could be preferred compared with the other PM variants."
https://openalex.org/W1841943867,"Magnetic biosensors detect magnetic beads that, mediated by a target, have bound to a functionalized area. This area is often larger than the area of the sensor. Both the sign and magnitude of the average magnetic field experienced by the sensor from a magnetic bead depends on the location of the bead relative to the sensor. Consequently, the signal from multiple beads also depends on their locations. Thus, a given coverage of the functionalized area with magnetic beads does not result in a given detector response, except on the average, over many realizations of the same coverage. We present a systematic theoretical analysis of how this location-dependence affects the sensor response. The analysis is done for beads magnetized by a homogeneous in-plane magnetic field. We determine the expected value and standard deviation of the sensor response for a given coverage, as well as the accuracy and precision with which the coverage can be determined from a single sensor measurement. We show that statistical fluctuations between samples may reduce the sensitivity and dynamic range of a sensor significantly when the functionalized area is larger than the sensor area. Hence, the statistics of sampling is essential to sensor design. For illustration, we analyze three important published cases for which statistical fluctuations are dominant, significant, and insignificant, respectively."

https://openalex.org/W2142481657,"Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is frequently lethal and has no effective pharmaceutical treatment, posing a great threat to human health. Previous bioinformatics studies of the mechanisms underlying AAA relied largely on the detection of direct protein-protein interactions (level-1 PPI) between the products of reported AAA-related genes. Thus, some proteins not suspected to be directly linked to previously reported genes of pivotal importance to AAA might have been missed. In this study, we constructed an indirect protein-protein interaction (level-2 PPI) network based on common interacting proteins encoded by known AAA-related genes and successfully predicted previously unreported AAA-related genes using this network. We used four methods to test and verify the performance of this level-2 PPI network: cross validation, human AAA mRNA chip array comparison, literature mining, and verification in a mouse CaPO4 AAA model. We confirmed that the new level-2 PPI network is superior to the original level-1 PPI network and proved that the top 100 candidate genes predicted by the level-2 PPI network shared similar GO functions and KEGG pathways compared with positive genes."
https://openalex.org/W2259991773,"Two cellular factors are currently known to modulate lentiviral infection specifically in myeloid cells: SAMHD1 and APOBEC3A (A3A). SAMHD1 is a deoxynucleoside triphosphohydrolase that interferes with viral infection mostly by limiting the intracellular concentrations of dNTPs, while A3A is a cytidine deaminase that has been described to edit incoming vDNA. The restrictive phenotype of myeloid cells can be alleviated through the direct degradation of SAMHD1 by the HIV-2/SIVSM Vpx protein or else, at least in the case of HIV-1, by the exogenous supplementation of nucleosides that artificially overcome the catabolic activity of SAMHD1 on dNTPs. Here, we have used Vpx and dNs to explore the relationship existing between vDNA cytidine deamination and SAMHD1 during HIV-1 or SIVMAC infection of primary dendritic cells. Our results reveal an interesting inverse correlation between conditions that promote efficient infection of DCs and the extent of vDNA editing that may reflect the different susceptibility of vDNA to cytoplasmic effectors during the infection of myeloid cells."
