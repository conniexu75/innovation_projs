https://openalex.org/W2083217812,"Study of the neurobiology of learning and memory is in a most exciting phase. Behavioral studies in animals are characterizing the categories and properties of learning and memory; essential memory trace circuits in the brain are being defined and localized in mammalian models; work on human memory and the brain is identifying neuronal systems involved in memory; the neuronal, neurochemical, molecular, and biophysical substrates of memory are beginning to be understood in both invertebrate and vertebrate systems; and theoretical and mathematical analysis of basic associative learning and of neuronal networks in proceeding apace. Likely applications of this new understanding of the neural bases of learning and memory range from education to the treatment of learning disabilities to the design of new artificial intelligence systems."
https://openalex.org/W2076248870,"The symbiotic interaction of Rhizobium meliloti and alfalfa results in the formation of nitrogen-fixing root nodules. Rhizobium meliloti nodABC genes are required for the early host responses of cortical cell divisions and root hair curling. The induction of nodABC expression by alfalfa exudates demonstrates host-symbiont signaling at an early stage in nodule development. The inducer molecule for nodABC expression was isolated from plant exudate by constructing a nodABC-lacZ fusion to monitor the inducing activity. From ultraviolet-visible absorption spectra, proton nuclear magnetic resonance, and mass spectrometry, the inducer was determined to be 3',4', 5,7-tetrahydroxyflavone (luteolin). Luteolin is a normal secondary plant metabolite found throughout the plant kingdom that may serve to control nodABC expression during nodule development. This regulatory role for a flavone contrasts with the function of some flavonoids as defense compounds."
https://openalex.org/W2129972061,"Human glucocorticoid receptor (hGR) produced in CV-1 cells via transfection of an hGR expression vector functions as a necessary and sufficient factor for the transcriptional activation of the MTV-CAT fusion gene. The magnitude of the induction (500-1000 fold) reveals that the hGR may act as a transcriptional ""switch,"" converting a silent promoter containing a glucocorticoid response element to an activated state. Stimulation of transcription of the MTV-CAT gene fusion by hGR is not dependent on transcriptional factors that are limiting in CV-1 cells. Characterization of 27 insertional mutants of the hGR allowed the location of at least four functional domains, two of which correspond to the predicted DNA- and steroid-binding domains. The other two domains are referred to as tau (tau) for their potent effects on transcription. This raises the possibility that other regions in the receptor are necessary for full transcriptional activation but are not specifically involved in steroid or DNA binding."
https://openalex.org/W2017720269,"During inflammatory reactions, activated leukocytes are thought to produce a variety of small proteins (cytokines) that influence the behaviour of other cells (including other leukocytes). Of these substances, which include the interleukins, interferons and tumour necrosis factors (TNFs), interleukin-1 (IL-1) has been considered potentially a most important inflammatory mediator because of its wide range of effects (reviewed in refs 1, 2). In vivo it is pyrogenic and promotes the acute phase response; in vitro it activates lymphocytes3 and stimulates resorption of cartilage4 and bone5,6. Cartilage resorption is a major feature of inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, and IL-1 is the only cytokine hitherto known to promote it. TNFs are characterized by their effects on tumours and cytotoxicity to transformed cells7–9, but share some actions with IL-1.1 report here that recombinant human TNFα stimulates resorption and inhibits synthesis of proteoglycan in explants of cartilage. Its action is similar to and additive with IL-1, and it is a second macrophage-derived cytokine whose production in rheumatoid arthritis, or inflammation generally, could contribute to tissue destruction."

https://openalex.org/W2057217877,"Growth cones are specialized structures that form the distal tips of growing axons. During both normal development of the nervous system and regeneration of injured nerves, growth cones are essential for elongation and guidance of growing axons. Developmental and regenerative axon growth is frequently accompanied by elevated synthesis of a protein designated GAP-43. GAP-43 has now been found to be a major component of growth-cone membranes in developing rat brains. Relative to total protein, GAP-43 is approximately 12 times as abundant in growth-cone membranes as in synaptic membranes from adult brains. Immunohistochemical localization of GAP-43 in frozen sections of developing brain indicates that the protein is specifically associated with neuropil areas containing growth cones and immature synaptic terminals. The results support the proposal that GAP-43 plays a role in axon growth."

https://openalex.org/W1966915471,"The B19 parvovirus is responsible for at least three human diseases. The virus was successfully propagated in suspension cultures of human erythroid bone marrow from patients with hemolytic anemias; release of newly synthesized virus into the supernatants of infected cultures was observed. This culture system allowed study at a molecular level of events associated with the B19 life cycle. The B19 parvovirus replicated through high molecular weight intermediate forms, linked through a terminal hairpin structure. B19 replication in vitro was highly dependent on the erythropoietic content of cultures and on addition of the hormone erythropoietin."

https://openalex.org/W1559877912,"Endothelial cells are known to release the two major forms of plasminogen activator, tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) and urokinase. We have previously demonstrated that plasminogen (PLG) immobilized on various surfaces forms a substrate for efficient conversion to plasmin by TPA (Silverstein, R. L., Nachman, R. L., Leung, L. L. K., and Harpel, P. C. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 10346-10352). We now report the binding of human PLG to cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) monolayers, utilizing a newly devised cell monolayer enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay system. PLG binding to HUVEC was concentration dependent and saturable at physiologic PLG concentration (2 microM). Binding of PLG was 70-80% inhibited by 10 mM epsilon-aminocaproic acid, suggesting that it is largely mediated by the lysine-binding sites of PLG. PLG bound at an intermediate level to human fibroblasts, poorly to human smooth muscle cells, and not at all to bovine smooth muscle or bovine endothelial cells; unrelated proteins such as human albumin and IgG failed to bind HUVEC. PLG binding to HUVEC was rapid, reaching a steady state within 20 min, and quickly reversible. 125I-PLG bound to HUVEC with an estimated Kd of 310 +/- 235 nM (S.E.); each cell contained 1,400,000 +/- 1,000,000 (S.E.) binding sites. Functional studies demonstrated that HUVEC-bound PLG is activatable by TPA according to Michaelis-Menten kinetics (Km, 5.9 nM). Importantly, surface-bound PLG was activated with a 12.7-fold greater catalytic efficiency than fluid phase PLG. These results indicate that PLG binds to HUVEC in a specific and functional manner. Binding of PLG to endothelial cells may play a pivotal role in modulating thrombotic events at the vessel surface."
https://openalex.org/W2006569526,"Kinetoplast DNA minicircles from the trypanosomatid Crithidia fasciculata contain a segment of ∼200 bp which is probably more highly bent than any other DNA previously studied. Electron microscopy (EM) of relaxed minicircles (2.5 kb) revealed 200–300 bp loops within the larger circles, and the loops could also be detected on full-length linear molecules. Examination by EM of a 219 bp cloned fragment which contains the bent helix revealed that up to 70% of the molecules appeared circular whether or not the ends were cohesive. In contrast, a 207 bp fragment from pBR322 showed no circles and the fragments in general appeared much straighter than the kinetoplast fragments. Treatment of the 219 bp bent kinetoplast fragment with the drug distamycin caused a striking reduction in curvature."
https://openalex.org/W1972434605,"The mechanism that guides neuronal growth cones to their targets in vertebrate embryos has been difficult to study primarily because of the complexity and large number of neurons found in many vertebrate nervous systems. The spinal cord of a simple vertebrate, the fish embryo, is used to analyze pathfinding mechanisms. The early embryonic spinal cord consists of a relatively small number of identifiable neurons. From the beginning of axonal outgrowth the growth cones of these identified neurons extend along stereotyped and precise pathways in the spinal cord. Laser ablation experiments (i) support the hypothesis that early growth cones that pioneer specific spinal tracts appear to recognize cues on subsets of longitudinally arrayed neuroepithelial cells and (ii) demonstrate that later growth cones that selectively fasciculate in these spinal tracts appear to recognize cues on specific subsets of axons."
https://openalex.org/W1572573094,"The binding of Artocarpus integrifolia lectin to N-dansylgalactosamine (where dansyl is 5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl) leads to a 100\% increase in dansyl fluorescence with a concomitant blue shift in the emission maximum by 10 nm. This binding is carbohydrate-specific and has an association constant of 1.74 \times $10^4 M^{-1}$ at $20^oC$. The lectin has two binding sites for N-dansylgalactosamine. The values of -\Delta H and -\Delta S for the bindinogf N-dansylgalactosamine are in the range of values reported for severa lectin monosaccharide interactions, indicating an absence of non-polar interaction of the dansylmoiety of the sugar with the combining region of the protein. Dissociation of the bound N-dansylgalactosamine from its complex with the lectin and cosequent change in its fluorescence on addition of nonfluorescent sugars allowed evaluation of the association constant for competing ligands. The thermodynamic parameters for the binding of monosaccharides suggest that the OH groups at C-2, C-3, C-4, and C-6 in the D-galactose configuration are important loci for interaction with the lectin. The acetamido group at C-2 of 2-acetamido-2-deoxygalactopyranose and a methoxyl group at C-1 of methyl-\gamma -Dgalactopyranoside are presumably also involved in binding through nonpolar and van der Waals' interactions. The T-antigenic disaccharide Gal\beta 1\rightarrow 3GalNAc binds very strongly to the lectinw hen compared with methyl-\beta -D-galactopyranoside, the \beta ( 1\rightarrow 3)-linked disaccharides such as Gal\beta 1\rightarrow 3GalNAc, and the \beta (1\rightarrow 4)- linked disaccharides, N-acetyllactosamine andla ctose. The major stabilizing force for the avid binding of Tantigenic disaccharide appears to be a favorable enthalpic contribution. The combining site of the lectin is, therefore, extended. These data takent ogether suggest that the Artocarpus lectin is specific toward the Thomsen-Friedenreich (T) antigen. There are subtle differences in the overaltlo pography of its combining site when compared with that of peanut (Arachis hypogaea)agglutinin.The results of stopped flow spectrometry for the binding of N-dansylgalactosamine to the Artocarpus lectin are consistent with a simple single-step bimolecular association and unimolecular dissociation rate processes. The value of $K_{+1}$ and $K_{-1}$, at $21 ^oC$ are 8.1 X $10^5 M^{-1} s^{-1}$ and 50 $s^{-1}$, respectively. The activation parameters indicate an enthalpy-controlled association process."
https://openalex.org/W1560568906,"An unknown deaminated sialic acid has been isolated from Salmo gairdneri (rainbow trout) egg polysialoglycoprotein. A combination of structural methods including gas-liquid chromatography, chemical and enzymatic analyses, mass spectrometry, and 400-MHz 1H NMR spectroscopy was used to determine the structure as 2-keto-3-deoxy-D-glycero-D-galacto-nononic acid (= 3-deoxy-D-glycero-D-galacto-nonulosonic acid; KDN). This structure has been confirmed by comparison with a chemically synthesized authentic sample of KDN. The natural occurrence of deaminated sialic acid in biological material has not been previously reported. A series of KDN-containing oligosialic acids were isolated from the polysialoglycoprotein after pH 4.7-catalyzed hydrolysis. Structural studies including methylation analysis, mass spectrometry, 1H NMR spectroscopy, and chemical reactivity were also used to confirm the structures of the sialyloligosaccharides as KDN alpha 2[8NeuGc alpha 2-]n (n = 1-7). The exclusive location of KDN at the nonreducing termini in polysialoglycoproteins protects oligo(poly)sialyl chains from exosialidases. Terminal capping of these chains may be important in egg activation in salmonid fishes."

https://openalex.org/W2034250568,"Male eastern red-spotted newts (Notophthalmus viridescens) under controlled laboratory conditions exhibit unimodal magnetic compass orientation either in a trained compass direction or in the direction of their home pond. If the vertical component of the magnetic field is inverted, newts exhibiting the simple-compass response undergo a 180 degree reversal in orientation, whereas newts orienting in the home direction are unaffected by this treatment. These results indicate that newts use an axial compass mechanism for simple-compass orientation similar to that found in migrating birds. However, a distinct magnetoreception pathway with polar response properties is involved in homing and is possibly linked in some way to the navigational map."
https://openalex.org/W1668568781,"Chemical degradation and antipeptide antibodies were used to study alterations in the structure and function of the human placental insulin receptor following autophosphorylation in vitro. Antibodies elicited to residues 1143-1162 (P2) of the human insulin proreceptor immunoprecipitated the native, phosphorylated receptor but not the unphosphorylated receptor. Since this antibody recognizes both forms of the receptor on immunoblots, it was concluded that the accessibility of the P2 domain to the antibody is increased by in vitro autophosphorylation. Chemical cleavage at either tryptophan or methionine residues followed by immunoprecipitation with antipeptide antibodies was used to map the in vitro autophosphorylation sites of the beta subunit of the insulin receptor. Two phosphorylated fragments were resolved. One, recognized by antibody elicited to amino acid residues 1328-1343 (P5), is derived from the carboxyl terminus of the beta subunit and includes tyrosine 1316. The other, recognized by antibody to P2, is located in a domain that includes tyrosine 1150. The rate of phosphorylation of this latter site correlates with the rate of activation of the insulin receptor kinase during in vitro autophosphorylation. The results support the following conclusions: autophosphorylation alters the conformation of the beta subunit of the insulin receptor; autophosphorylation in vitro leads to phosphorylation of tyrosine residues near the carboxyl terminus of the protein and in the P2 domain that includes tyrosine 1150; activation of the insulin receptor kinase correlates with autophosphorylation of the domain containing tyrosine 1150."
https://openalex.org/W1484768876,"The conversion of the membrane-form variant surface glycoprotein (mfVSG) of the unicellular parasitic flagellate Trypanosoma brucei to soluble variant surface glycoprotein and sn-1,2-dimyristoyl glycerol is catalyzed by an endogeneous, membrane bound phospholipase C-like hydrolase. Using a monoclonal antibody against the enzyme the hydrolase was purified 3,000-fold with a yield of 32%. The enzyme has a molecular weight of 39,000 as determined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. The rate with which mfVSG hydrolase cleaves phosphatidylinositol is 170 times lower than the cleavage rate for mfVSG, whereas phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, and phosphatidylcholine cannot serve as substrates. Reconstitution experiments into phospholipid vesicles show that the enzyme can hydrolyze mfVSG when present in the same phospholipid bilayer but not when present in separate bilayers."
https://openalex.org/W2084468006,"Can animal mating systems result in the choice of mates carrying genotypes that are otherwise favored by natural selection? This question is addressed by studying, in natural populations of Colias butterflies, how the phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI) enzyme genotype of males mating Colias females varies with degree of female mate discrimination. Certain PGI genotypes (as predicted from their biochemical properties) have been found previously to have an advantage in diverse fitness-related properties: flight capacity, survivorship, and overall mating success. It is shown here that males of these same genotypes have even greater advantage in remating older, more discriminating females than they do in mating previously unmated, less discriminating females. Assortative mating is not found and thus cannot explain this effect. The mating system of these insects does, at least in this case, result in active female choice of generally favorable male genotypes as mates."
https://openalex.org/W1973420209,"Insect juvenile hormones are metabolized in numerous species of caterpillars by low abundance, highly specific esterases. Because of their role in regulating and possibly disrupting juvenile hormone titer and thus insect metamorphosis, they are of interest to developmental biologists as well as scientists interested in selective insect control. However, the enzymes have defied attempts to purify and characterize them. Juvenile hormone esterase activity can be inhibited by a variety of 3-substituted 1,1,1-trifluoropropanone sulfides. These apparent transition state analogs were used as ligands and eluting agents to purify juvenile hormone esterase from four insect species from 500-fold to over 1000-fold in high yield. After elution from the affinity column, the enzymes were radiolabeled with paraoxon and analyzed by electrophoresis, and the results demonstrate a high degree of purity. Transition state analogs may be useful for the affinity purification of other enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1635203761,"A protein termed endozepine (EP) which inhibits the binding of benzodiazepines to synaptosomal membranes (Ki approximately 5 microM) has been purified to electrophoretic homogeneity from bovine and human brain using acidic ethanol/chloroform extraction, Bio-Sil TSK-250 gel permeation chromatography, and reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatographies. Bovine and human EP are single-chain polypeptides and have molecular weights of approximately 10,000. Both proteins are very hydrophilic and contain an abundance of lysine, glutamic, and aspartic residues. Antisera prepared against bovine EP have been used to develop a sensitive radioimmunoassay for the detection of EP in tissue and body fluids. EP immunoreactivity is widely distributed in mammalian tissues, body fluids, and various cell lines. Substantial variation in the concentrations of EP is observed in different regions of the brain."
https://openalex.org/W2061948085,"Y-chromosomal DNA is present in the genomes of most human XX males. In these cases, maleness is probably due to the presence of the Y-encoded testis-determining factor (TDF). By means of in situ hybridization of a probe (pDP105) detecting Y-specific DNA to metaphases from three XX males, it was demonstrated that the Y DNA is located on the tip of the short arm of an X chromosome. This finding supports the hypothesis that XX maleness is frequently the result of transfer of Y DNA, including TDF, to a paternally derived X chromosome."
https://openalex.org/W1524323459,"The debrisoquine/sparteine-type polymorphism of drug oxidation presumably is caused by the absence or deficiency of cytochrome P-450 (P-450) isozyme(s). Using bufuralol 1'-hydroxylation as a prototype reaction of this polymorphism, two functionally distinct forms, P-450 buf I and P-450 buf II, with identical apparent Mr of 50,000 were purified from liver microsomes of three different human livers. P-450 buf I exhibited a marked selectivity for the (+)-enantiomer of bufuralol ((-)/(+) ratio = 0.15), P-450 buf II was nonstereoselective((-)/(+) ratio = 1.03). The Km values for (-)- and (+)-bufuralol were 31 and 54 microM with P-450 buf I and 314 and 245 microM with P-450 buf II. P-450 buf II generated two other metabolites in addition to 1'-OH-bufuralol which were not observed with P-450 buf I. Using the inhibitor quinidine, a Ki of 0.06 microM was observed with P-450 buf I as opposed to 80 microM with P-450 buf II for bufuralol 1'-hydroxylation. A strong immunochemical relatedness of P-450 buf I and P-450 buf II was found since polyclonal antibodies against either form recognized the heterologous antigen to the same extent as the homologous antigen on Western blots and in immunoinhibition and in immunoprecipitation experiments. Cross-reactivity of these antibodies with a microsomal nonheme protein of unknown function (apparent Mr 50,000) also was noted. Western blots of microsomes of in vivo and in vitro phenotyped extensive and poor metabolizer individuals revealed no correlation of in vivo-determined metabolic ratio, microsomal activity, and amount of immunoreactive material. Antibodies against P-450 buf I and P-450 buf II inhibited bufuralol 1'-hydroxylation in microsomes of in vivo and in vitro phenotyped poor metabolizer individuals demonstrating that the residual activities are immunochemically related to the activities in extensive metabolizers."
https://openalex.org/W2035852270,"Mitotic gene conversion and reciprocal recombination have recently been shown to be efficiently initiated by double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs) in both Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe. We tested whether DSBs could also initiate meiotic recombination at the mat1 locus in S. pombe. The mat1 switching-mechanism-generated DSB found in mitotically growing cells can be repaired without mat1 switching, since strains deleted for both donor loci (mat2-P and mat3-M) have the break but do not produce inviable cells. A (mat1-P X mat1-M) cross produced a high frequency (20%) of 3:1 gene conversions of mat1 in meiotic tetrads. Gene conversion events were associated with the recombination of flanking markers. Strains lacking the DSB failed to convert. Thus, the DSB at mat1 promotes efficient meiotic recombination in fission yeast."
https://openalex.org/W1604619319,"A polycation-dependent protein kinase was found to be associated with purified phytochrome preparations from etiolated Avena seedlings. This kinase and three mammalian protein kinases, the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase, cGMP-dependent protein kinase, and a Ca2+-activated phospholipid-dependent protein kinase, were used to probe light-induced conformational changes in 124-kilodalton Avena phytochrome in vitro. The red absorbing form of phytochrome (Pr) was found to be a substrate for all four protein kinases. Although the far-red absorbing form of phytochrome (Pfr) was as good a substrate as Pr with the cAMP-dependent protein kinase, the Pfr form was poorly phosphorylated by the other three protein kinases. Serine is the major amino acid residue phosphorylated on phytochrome regardless of the form of phytochrome used as substrate. Peptide mapping revealed that the sites of phosphorylation catalyzed by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase differ for Pr and Pfr forms of phytochrome. For the Pr form, the preferred site(s) of phosphorylation was near the amino terminus of the 124-kilodalton subunit. Upon photo-conversion to Pfr, this site can no longer be phosphorylated easily and a new phosphorylation site in the COOH-terminal nonchromophore domain of the molecule becomes accessible to the cAMP-dependent protein kinase. These studies of the phosphorylation of phytochrome provide a new means to study the effect of light absorption by phytochrome on the molecular conformation of the protein. The potential physiological implications of differential phosphorylation of Pr and Pfr await elucidation."
https://openalex.org/W1542851806,"The quantities of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors measured by alpha-bungarotoxin binding on the surface of mouse skeletal muscle C2 cells increase by approximately 10- to 100-fold during their terminal differentiation in culture. By northern blot analysis, we have determined that the steady-state levels of the AChR alpha and delta subunit mRNAs increase by approximately 15-fold during differentiation of C2 cells. To determine if the differences in message levels during myogenesis are due to changes in transcriptional rates of these genes, nuclear run-on experiments were done using nuclei from 3-day-old undifferentiated cells and 7-day-old differentiated cells. The rates of transcription for both the alpha and delta subunit genes changed from levels that could not be detected over background in nuclei from undifferentiated cells to levels that were at least 8-fold over background in differentiated nuclei. As internal controls, we measured the rates of transcription of mouse actin and histone genes. The signals obtained from both undifferentiated and differentiated nuclei were approximately 50-fold over background for both genes, indicating that the absence of detectable transcription of receptor subunit genes in undifferentiated C2 is specific."
https://openalex.org/W1509094286,"The values of the thermodynamic parameters characterizing the association of the subunits of reduced ricin have been determined from equilibrium studies in the analytical ultracentrifuge. van't Hoff analysis indicates that the Gibbs free energy change for subunit association is predominantly of entropic origin. The positive values for the entropy and enthalpy changes suggest that hydrophobic forces may play a dominant role in the association. The association is characterized by values of Ka of 1.72 X 10(6) M-1 at 22 degrees C and 5.66 X 10(6) M-1 at 37 degrees C. The association was not affected by the presence of 20 mM lactose. Toxicity studies demonstrated that reduced ricin at a concentration where it was 52% associated had a toxicity equal to that of native ricin at that same concentration. At higher concentrations, reduced ricin was even more toxic than native ricin. Diethyl maleate, which reduces intracellular glutathione levels, blocked the toxicity of ricin but not the toxicity of reduced ricin. The disulfide bond linking the A and B subunits appears to play no role in toxicity other than to hold the two subunits together at low concentrations."

https://openalex.org/W1527996291,"Ligand binding characteristics of rat liver microsomal type I iodothyronine deiodinase were evaluated by measuring dose-response inhibition and apparent Michaelis-Menten or inhibitor constants of iodothyronine analogues to compete as substrates or inhibitors for the natural substrate L-thyroxine. These data show strong correlations with the binding requirements of hormone analogues to serum thyroxine-binding prealbumin since iodothyronine analogues with a negatively charged side chain, a negative charge or hydrogen bonding function in the 4'-position, tetraiodo ring substitution, and a skewed hormone conformation are structural features shared in common which markedly affect enzyme activity and protein binding affinity. 3,3',5'-Triiodo-L-thyronine is the most potent natural substrate (IC50 = 0.3 microM) and tetraiodothyroacetic acid is the most potent inhibitor (IC50 = 0.2 microM). Both thyroxine (T4)-5'- and T4-5-deiodination pathways are inhibited by these potent analogues, providing further evidence for a single enzyme catalyzing the rat liver microsomal deiodination reactions. These data also show that L-hormone analogues are preferentially deiodinated via the T4-5'-deiodination pathway, whereas D-analogues produce products via the T4-5-deiodination pathway. The thyroxine-binding prealbumin complex was used to model the interaction of thyroid hormones with the deiodinase active site. Computer graphic modeling of the prealbumin complex showed that only those analogues which are potent deiodinase inhibitors or substrates can be accommodated in the hormone binding site. This model suggests the design of functionally specific ligands which can modulate peripheral thyroid hormone metabolism and act as antithyroidal drugs."
https://openalex.org/W1604884879,"The effects of acidification of the cytosol and of electrical depolarization on the entry of diphtheria toxin were studied. Entry of the toxin from the cell surface was induced by low pH, and the presence of the toxin in the cytosol was monitored as toxin-induced inhibition of protein synthesis. To reduce the membrane potential the cells were incubated in a buffer containing a high concentration of potassium. The cytosol was acidified either by incubating the cells with acetic acid, by incubating them with ammonium chloride which was subsequently removed in the presence of amiloride to prevent pH regulation by the Na+/H+ exchanger, or by incubating the cells in isotonic KCl in the presence of nigericin and valinomycin. The results showed that when the cytosol was acidified by either method toxin entry was inhibited, while a reduction in the membrane potential did not strongly interfere with the entry. A pH gradient across the membrane of at least 1 pH unit was required for entry. Possibly this gradient acts as a driving force for diphtheria toxin entry."
https://openalex.org/W1906957210,"Thromboxane synthase has been purified 620-fold from porcine lung microsomes by a three-step purification procedure including Lubrol-PX solubilization, reactive blue-agarose chromatography, and immunoaffinity chromatography. The purified enzyme exhibited a single protein band (53,000 daltons) on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Rabbit antiserum raised against the purified enzyme immunoprecipitated thromboxane synthase activity from crude enzyme preparations of porcine lung, cow lung, and human platelets, indicating the existence of structural homology of the enzyme in these species. Immunoblotting experiment identified the same polypeptide (53,000 daltons) in porcine lung and a polypeptide of 50,000 daltons in human platelets, confirming the identity of the enzyme and the specificity of the antiserum. Purified thromboxane synthase is a hemoprotein with a Soret-like absorption peak at 418 nm. The enzyme reaction has a Km for 15-hydroxy-9 alpha, 11 alpha-peroxidoprosta-5, 13-dienoic acid of 12 microM, an optimal pH of 7.5, and an optimal temperature of reaction at 30 degrees C. Purified thromboxane synthase catalyzed the formation of both thromboxane B2 and 12-hydroxy-5,8,10-heptadecatrienoic acid (HHT). The ratios of HHT to thromboxane B2 varied from 1.6 to 2.1 dependent on the reaction conditions. Except that HHT was formed at a greater rate, the formation of HHT and that of thromboxane responded identically to pH, temperature, substrate concentration, kinetics of formation, metal ions, and inhibitors suggesting that the two products are probably formed at the same active site via a common intermediate. Thromboxane synthase was irreversibly inactivated by 15-hydroxy-9 alpha, 11 alpha-peroxidoprosta-5,13-dienoic acid during catalysis and by treatment of 15-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid. The irreversible inactivation, however, could be protected by reversible inhibitors such as sodium (E)-3-[4-(1-imidazolylmethyl)phenyl]-2-propenoate and 15-hydroxy-11 alpha,9 alpha-(epoxymethano)-prosta-5,13-dienoic acid, suggesting that the inactivation occurred at the active site of the enzyme. The catalytic inactivation of thromboxane synthase and the greater rate of formation of HHT in thromboxane-synthesizing system may probably play important regulatory roles in the control of thromboxane synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1584482857,"Mammalian protein carboxyl methyltransferases have recently been proposed to recognize atypical configurations of aspartic acid and may possibly function in the metabolism of covalently altered cellular proteins. Consistent with this proposal, the tetrapeptide tetragastrin, containing a single L-aspartyl residue (L-Trp-L-Met-L-Asp-L-Phe-NH2) was found here not to be an in vitro substrate for erythrocyte carboxyl methyltransferase activity. However, chemical treatment of tetragastrin by methyl esterification and then de-esterification of the aspartic acid residue yielded a mixture of peptide products, the major one of which could now be enzymatically methylated. We show here that this new peptide species is the isomeric beta-aspartyl form of tetragastrin (L-iso-tetragastrin; L-Trp-L-Met-L-Asp-L-Phe-NH2), and it appears that isomerization proceeds via an intramolecular succinimide intermediate during the de-esterification procedure. L-iso-Tetragastrin is stoichiometrically methylated (up to 90% in these experiments) with a Km for the enzyme of 5.0 microM. Similar chemical treatment of several other L-aspartyl peptides also resulted in the formation of new methyltransferase substrates. This general method for converting normal aspartyl peptides to isoaspartyl peptides may have application in the reverse process as well."
https://openalex.org/W1596112430,"Protoplasts derived from developing soybean cotyledons were used to study substrate recognition by a sucrose transporting protein in plant membranes. When used as alternate substrate inhibitors of [14C] sucrose influx, five different fructosyl-substituted sucrose derivatives, phenyl-alpha-D-glucopyranoside, and phenyl-alpha-D-thioglucopyranoside proved to bind effectively to the sucrose carrier-active site. These results are interpreted to indicate that a large portion of substrate recognition by this carrier may arise from the interaction of a relatively hydrophobic portion of the sucrose molecule and a hydrophobic region of the carrier protein binding site. Binding of phenyl-alpha-D-thioglucopyranosides in which various substitutions were made for the glucosyl hydroxyls shows that the glucosyl hydroxyls at positions 3, 4, and 6 are involved in substrate recognition by the carrier protein."
https://openalex.org/W1497110563,"Oligodendrocytes can be maintained in two states: nonattached; we call these cells B3.f; morphologically they resemble freshly isolated cells; attached; we refer to the latter as B3.fA. Profound morphological, ultrastructural, and biochemical changes take place upon adhesion to a competent surface (Szuchet, S., Yim, S. H., and Monsma, S. (1983) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 80, 7019-7023). Here we present evidence that the transition from B3.f to B3.fA has important consequences for the expression of myelinogenic properties by these cells. We have examined the incorporation of [3H]leucine, [35S]methionine, and [35S]cysteine into polypeptide chains by B3.f and B3.fA cells from 3 days after isolation up to 8 weeks in culture. Specific antisera against myelin and cytoskeletal proteins were used to identify the newly synthesized proteins. Our results indicate that: overall incorporation expressed as cpm/mg of protein remains essentially constant and independent of the state of adhesion or time in culture; B3.f cells keep a low profile in the synthesis of the major myelin proteins but have a high uptake of precursors into 2',3'-cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase, actin, and tubulin; adhesion of oligodendrocytes to a polylysine substratum activates the synthesis and phosphorylation of myelin basic protein, and the synthesis and acylation of proteolipid protein and DM-20; over time in culture there is an increased synthesis and accumulation of these proteins and of myelin-associated glycoprotein. We conclude that B3.f cells exhibit a behavior that is distinct from that of B3.fA cells. Our results are consistent with the notion that upon adhesion to a substratum, oligodendrocytes undergo a transition from myelin-maintaining cells (B3.f) to that of myelin-forming cells (B3.fA). This conclusion is substantiated by the finding of myelin membranes in these cultures."
https://openalex.org/W1524481917,"The fatty acyl (lipid) p-nitrophenyl esters p-nitrophenyl caprylate, p-nitrophenyl laurate and p-nitrophenyl palmitate that are incorporated at a few mol % into mixed micelles with Triton X-100 are substrates for bovine milk lipoprotein lipase. When the concentration of components of the mixed micelles is approximately equal to or greater than the critical micelle concentration, time courses for lipoprotein lipase-catalyzed hydrolysis of the esters are described by the integrated form of the Michaelis-Menten equation. Least square fitting to the integrated equation therefore allows calculation of the interfacial kinetic parameters Km and Vmax from single runs. The computational methodology used to determine the interfacial kinetic parameters is described in this paper and is used to determine the intrinsic substrate fatty acyl specificity of lipoprotein lipase catalysis, which is reflected in the magnitude of kcat/Km and kcat. The results for interfacial lipoprotein lipase catalysis, along with previously determined kinetic parameters for the water-soluble esters p-nitrophenyl acetate and p-nitrophenyl butyrate, indicate that lipoprotein lipase has highest specificity for the substrates that have fatty acyl chains of intermediate length (i.e. p-nitrophenyl butyrate and p-nitrophenyl caprylate). The fatty acid products do not cause product inhibition during lipoprotein lipase-catalyzed hydrolysis of lipid p-nitrophenyl esters that are contained in Triton X-100 micelles. The effects of the nucleophiles hydroxylamine, hydrazine, and ethylenediamine on Km and Vmax for lipoprotein lipase catalyzed hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl laurate are consistent with trapping of a lauryl-lipoprotein lipase intermediate. This mechanism is confirmed by analysis of the product lauryl hydroxamate when hydroxylamine is the nucleophile. Hence, lipoprotein lipase-catalyzed hydrolysis of lipid p-nitrophenyl esters that are contained in Triton X-100 micelles occurs via an interfacial acyl-lipoprotein lipase mechanism that is rate-limited by hydrolysis of the acyl-enzyme intermediate."
https://openalex.org/W1663036315,"Heavy sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles loaded with 5 mM CaCl2 in the presence of protease inhibitors were phosphorylated by addition of MgATP in the presence or absence of calmodulin. The major site of phosphorylation was a 60-kDa protein. In the absence of added calmodulin, phosphorylation of the 60-kDa protein reached its maximal value (8 pmol of P/mg of membrane protein) at 1 min. In the presence of 1 microM calmodulin, a 2-fold higher level of phosphorylation (16.1 pmol of P/mg of sarcoplasmic reticulum) was reached within a shorter time (10 s). The phosphoprotein was then spontaneously dephosphorylated. The initial rate of Ca2+ release, which was induced by a Ca2+ jump and determined by stopped-flow fluorometry using chlorotetracycline, decreased upon phosphorylation, whereas it was restored upon dephosphorylation. There was good correlation between the amount of P incorporation into the 60-kDa protein and the extent of inhibition of Ca2+ release. In the presence of added calmodulin the protein kinase activity sharply increased in the [Ca2+] range of 0.2-2 microM with a concentration for half-maximal activation at 0.6 microM. On the other hand, the protein phosphatase activity was virtually independent of calmodulin and [Ca2+] in the [Ca2+] range in which protein kinase was activated. The results suggest that the calmodulin-dependent phosphorylation of the 60-kDa protein plays an important role in the regulation of Ca2+ release from sarcoplasmic reticulum."
https://openalex.org/W1556046887,"A series of four cell lines resistant to the toxic effect of copper were developed from Morris rat hepatoma cells by gradually increasing the concentration of copper in the growth medium. The EC50, that concentration of copper that kills and/or inhibits the growth of 50% of the cells after 72 h, increased 4-fold over that for wild type cells in the most resistant cell line. These cells were also resistant to zinc, cadmium, and mercury toxicity, but not to nickel or cobalt. The amount of copper in the soluble protein pool of the resistant cells increased proportionally with the concentration of copper in the medium in which they were maintained. Associated with copper accumulation was the production of an 18-kDa cysteine-rich protein which complexes a significant amount of the metal. It is suggested that resistance to copper toxicity is due to sequestration of the metal by this protein. When resistant cells were removed from the copper-enriched environment, cellular copper levels rapidly fell to that observed for wild type cells, but no reduction in either the EC50 or the level of the cysteine-rich protein was noted. This suggests that a permanent change responsible for copper resistance had occurred which is maintained in the absence of the metal."
https://openalex.org/W1634238805,"Five major polypeptides are found in immunoaffinity-purified calf thymus DNA polymerase-DNA primase complex: 185, 160, 68, 55, and 48 kDa. Individual polypeptides purified by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were used to produce antibodies in rabbits to aid in identifying the relationships between these polypeptides by immunoblotting and enzyme neutralization procedures. Immunoblot analyses showed that the 160-kDa peptide is derived from the 185-kDa peptide and the 48-kDa peptide is derived from the 68-kDa peptide while antibodies to the 55-kDa peptide do not cross-react with other peptides found in the complex. Direct enzyme neutralization studies demonstrated that antibodies to 185- and 160-kDa peptides inhibit DNA polymerase activity in the complex, confirming earlier suggestions that these peptides are the catalytic peptides for DNA polymerase. DNA primase activity in the complex is inhibited by antibodies to 68-, 55-, and 48-kDa peptides and to a lesser extent by antibodies to the 160-kDa peptide. Free DNA primase isolated from the complex was estimated to have a native molecular weight of about 110,000. The 55- and 48-kDa peptides are found to be associated with the free primase activity. Rabbit antibodies to both 55- and 48-kDa peptides are inhibitory to this primase activity. From these results we suggest that the native calf thymus DNA polymerase-DNA primase complex contains only three unique peptides with the 185-kDa peptide as the catalytic peptide of DNA polymerase and the 55- and 68-kDa peptides constituting the primase peptides. A model illustrating the roles of these peptides in initiation and replication of DNA is presented."
https://openalex.org/W1528465632,"The ability of polypeptide components of eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4F to bind to the m7G cap of an mRNA, to be released from that mRNA, and then to rebind to the cap of a second mRNA has been investigated. The release and rebinding steps have been termed recycling. It was found that eIF-4B stimulates the recycling of the 24-26 kDa (p24) component of eIF-4F, and perhaps of other components as well. By contrast, eIF-4A seemed to have little or no effect on the recycling of eIF-4F components, either in the presence or absence of eIF-4B. The recycled p24 is capable of cross-linking to oxidized cap structures. The recycled factor is also able to stimulate the cross-linking of added eIF-4A, which cross-links poorly in the absence of eIF-4F. By these criteria it seems likely that the recycled eIF-4F components are active for a second round of translational initiation."
https://openalex.org/W1484786674,"Following removal of most of the telopeptide regions with pepsin, bovine dermal collagen gelled more slowly to form fibrils with a weak banding pattern. The reduction in gelling rate reflected an increase in the length of the nucleation phase and a lower rate of turbidity increase during the growth phase; the activation energy of both phases was increased. Lanthanide ions, phosphate, or, to a lesser degree, Ca2+ restored higher gelling rates to pepsin-treated collagen, but were unable to improve the banding pattern. Only lanthanide ions were able to accelerate the polymerization of intact collagen, lowering the activation energies of both the nucleation and growth phases. Lanthanide ions and phosphate also improved the banding characteristics of fibrils formed from intact collagen, without changing their width. Luminescence studies confirmed the direct binding of Tb3+ to collagen and suggested that the lanthanide ions may mediate their effects on fibrillogenesis by attaching to the helical part of the molecule. Quantitative considerations indicate that five or less lanthanide ion-binding sites per collagen molecule may be involved in the promotion of fibril formation."
https://openalex.org/W1556605011,"N-Carbamoylsarcosine amidohydrolase, a novel enzyme involved in the microbial degradation of creatinine in Pseudomonas putida 77, was purified 27-fold to homogeneity with a 63% overall recovery through simple purification procedures including successive ammonium sulfate fractionation, DEAE-cellulose chromatography, and crystallization. The relative molecular mass of the native enzyme estimated by the ultracentrifugal equilibrium method is 102,000 +/- 5000, and the subunit Mr is 27,000. The Km and Vm values for N-carbamoylsarcosine are 3.2 mM and 1.75 units/mg protein, respectively. Ammonia, carbon dioxide, and sarcosine were formed stoichiometrically from N-carbamoylsarcosine through the action of the purified enzyme preparation. N-Carbamoyl amino acids with a methyl group or hydrogen atom on the amino-N atom and possessing glycine, D-alanine, or one of their derivatives as an amino acid moiety served well as substrates for N-carbamoylsarcosine amidohydrolase. N-Carbamoylsarcosine, N-methyl-N-carbamoyl-D-alanine, N-carbamoylglycine, and N-carbamoyl-D-alanine were hydrolyzed at relative rates of 100, 12.8, 9.8, and 7.3, respectively, by the enzyme. N-Carbamoyl derivatives of D-tryptophan, D-phenylalanine, and those of some other amino acids including D-phenylglycine and p-hydroxy-D-phenylglycine were also hydrolyzed by the enzyme. For the L-isomers of all N-carbamoyl amino acids tested there was no production of ammonia, carbon dioxide, or the corresponding amino acids due to the action of the enzyme. Cupric, mercuric, and silver ions inhibited the enzyme strongly, and some thiol reagents were also found to be inhibitory."
https://openalex.org/W1662351267,"Surface sialoglycoproteins of HeLa cells were labeled by NaB[3H]4 reduction after oxidation with NaIO4, yielding seven major radioactive bands as visualized by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. When labeled cells are reincubated in growth medium, all of these major classes of glycoproteins are internalized and all but one (105 kDa) are recycled, i.e. subsequently reappear on the surface. The surface-labeling patterns over time remain qualitatively similar, but changes in relative specific activity of the bands suggest some preferential degradation of individual glycoproteins. Analytical fractionation at various time points after labeling suggests that the surface molecules pass through the lysosomal compartment and subsequently accumulate in the Golgi and Golgi-related compartments before returning to the surface. Inhibition of lysosomal function with chloroquine or NH4Cl prevents the accumulation and subsequent recycling. The pathway is confirmed with preparative fractionation into surface membrane, prelysosomal, lysosomal, Golgi, and Golgi-related compartments. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis demonstrates a degree of preferential handling of the glycoproteins on this pathway, e.g. the 180-kDa band is relatively reduced at the endocytic/prelysosomal stage and the 105-kDa band appears to be degraded in its first passage through the lysosomes. The other bands recycle 10-20 times before being degraded."
https://openalex.org/W2161342390,"Bacterial 5-oxoprolinase is composed of two protein components: Component A, which catalyzes 5-oxoproline-dependent ATP-hydrolysis and Component B, which couples the hydrolysis of ATP with the decyclization of 5-oxoproline to form glutamate (Seddon, A. P., Li, L., and Meister, A. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 8091-8094). Studies on this unusual enzyme system have led to evidence that an intermediate is formed by Component A. Application of the isotope-trapping method demonstrated an activated 5-oxoproline intermediate, whose formation requires ATP, Mg2+, and Component A. The amount of ATP-dependent trapping was close to the number of enzyme active sites. The intermediate formed by Component A was shown to be reducible by potassium borohydride to proline in low yield; when Component B was added, the formation of proline was abolished. Treatment of reaction mixtures containing Component A, 5-oxoproline, and [gamma-32P] ATP with diazomethane led to appearance of a 32P-labeled compound (found on thin layer chromatography), whose formation was significantly reduced when Component B was present. The new compound, which is labile, breaks down to form dimethyl[32P]phosphate. The total amount of dimethyl[32P]phosphate formed after breakdown is close to the number of active sites of Component A. The data are consistent with the conclusion that a phosphorylated form of 5-oxoproline is formed by Component A and suggest that Component B is required for conversion of this intermediate to glutamate."
https://openalex.org/W1531411228,"H2(18)O isotope exchange into specifically 13C-labeled substrate was used to obtain information on the rate-limiting step in the action of the phospholipase A2 from the venom of the Indian cobra (Naja naja naja). Incorporation of 18O was detected by the effect of 18O on 13C chemical shifts in 13C NMR. The enzymatic hydrolysis of a micellar phosphatidylcholine analogue of platelet-activating factor 1-alkyl-2-[1-13C]lauroyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylcholine proceeds by an O-acyl cleavage of the sn-2 ester bond. The reaction was examined for simultaneous 18O incorporation into the substrate. No exchange was found, suggesting that the hydrolytic step is not followed by a higher energy transition state and that it or a step before it appears to be rate-limiting. Previous experiments on phosphatidylethanolamine activation indicate that kcat is altered but that the km remains the same upon activation, suggesting that the binding steps occurring before the hydrolytic step are not affected. This strongly suggests that the hydrolytic step is in fact the rate-limiting step under these conditions. The 13C, 18O NMR technique should be generally applicable to mechanistic questions of this type."

Although previously reported not to be capable of C-terminal amidation, this report demonstrates that Xenopus oocytes do indeed have an amidating enzyme. The amidating activity from Xenopus ovaries is compared to the known amidating activity found in porcine pituitaries. The demonstration of C-terminal amidation by Xenopus oocytes extends their usefulness in studying post-translational events."
https://openalex.org/W1606960670,"In the teleost fish Fundulus heteroclitus, there are three NADP-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase isozymes. IDH-B2 is the only cytoplasmic isozyme, and IDH-C2 dominates the mitochondria of all tissues other than liver, where IDH-A2 is expressed. Since fish are ectotherms, their intracellular temperature and pH change directly with environmental temperature. In order to evaluate the influence of these environmental parameters on a model fish NADP-isocitrate dehydrogenase system, the major cytoplasmic (IDH-B2) and mitochondrial (IDH-C2) isozymes were kinetically evaluated as a function of pH and temperature. Whereas Vfmax and KmISOCm (where ISOC is isocitrate) were pH-independent, the Km for NADP was pH-dependent for both isozymes. The cytoplasmic isozyme (IDH-B2) had smaller KmNADP values between pH 7.0 and pH 8.0 than the mitochondrial form (IDH-C2). Vfmax and Km for substrate and coenzyme were temperature-dependent. Energy of activation for IDH-B2 and IDH-C2 was 10.6 and 12.8 kcal/mol, respectively. Both proteins had delta G not equal to values of about 15.8 kcal/mol, with significantly different distributions between delta H not equal to and delta S not equal to. The cytoplasmic isozyme (IDH-B2) appears to have a greater rate of catalysis than the mitochondrial enzyme (IDH-C2) at temperatures less than 30 degrees C. Moreover, the IDH-B2 isozyme had lower KmNADP values than the IDH-C2 isozyme at all temperatures, whereas the KmISOC values for the two isozymes were indistinguishable. Our data suggest that the two major NADP-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase isozymes have unique physiological and metabolic functions that are adapted to the tissues and cellular compartments in which they are expressed."

https://openalex.org/W1558143833,"The archaebacterium Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum was grown at 65 degrees C in H2- and Pi-limited chemostat cultures at dilution rates corresponding to 3- and 4-h doubling times, respectively. Under these conditions the steady state concentration of cyclic 2,3-diphosphoglycerate was 44 mM in the H2-limited cells and 13 mM in the cells grown under Pi limitation. Flux of Pi into the cyclic pyrophosphate pool was estimated by two 32P-labeling procedures: approach to isotopic equilibrium and replacement of prelabeled cyclic diphosphoglycerate with unlabeled compound. The results unequivocally demonstrate turnover of the phosphoryl groups; either both phosphoryl groups of the cyclic pyrophosphate leave together or the second leaves at a faster rate. The half-life of the rate-determining step for loss of the phosphoryl groups was approximately equal to the culture doubling time. The Pi flowing into the cyclic diphosphoglycerate pool accounted for 19% of the total Pi flux into Pi-limited cells and 43% of the total for H2-limited cells. The high phosphate flux through the large cyclic diphosphoglycerate pool suggests that this molecule plays an important role in the phosphorus metabolism of this methanogen."
