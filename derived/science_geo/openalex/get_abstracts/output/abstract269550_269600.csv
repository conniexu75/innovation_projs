https://openalex.org/W2025682368,"Mercury contamination of remote lakes has been attributed to increasing deposition of atmospheric mercury, yet historic deposition rates and inputs from terrestrial sources are essentially unknown. Sediments of seven headwater lakes in Minnesota and Wisconsin were used to reconstruct regional modern and preindustrial deposition rates of mercury. Whole-basin mercury fluxes, determined from lake-wide arrays of dated cores, indicate that the annual deposition of atmospheric mercury has increased from 3.7 to 12.5 micrograms per square meter since 1850 and that 25 percent of atmospheric mercury deposition to the terrestrial catchment is exported to the lake. The deposition increase is similar among sites, implying regional or global sources for the mercury entering these lakes."
https://openalex.org/W2014677115,"Fluid mixing is a successful application of chaos. Theory anticipates the coexistence of order and disorder-symmetry and chaos-as well as self-similarity and multifractality arising from repeated stretching and folding. Experiments and computations, in turn, provide a point of confluence and a visual analog for chaotic behavior, multiplicative processes, and scaling behavior. All these concepts have conceptual engineering counterparts: examples arise in the context of flow classification, design of mixing devices, enhancement of transport processes, and controlled structure formation in two-phase systems."
https://openalex.org/W1979317399,"Annular moats and outer rises around large Venus coronae such as Artemis, Latona, and Eithinoha are similar in arcuate planform and topography to the trenches and outer rises of terrestrial subduction zones. On Earth, trenches and outer rises are modeled as the flexural response of a thin elastic lithosphere to the bending moment of the subducted slab; this lithospheric flexure model also accounts for the trenches and outer rises outboard of the major coronae on Venus. Accordingly, it is proposed that retrograde lithospheric subduction may be occurring on the margins of the large Venus coronae while compensating back-arc extension is occurring in the expanding coronae interiors. Similar processes may be taking place at other deep arcuate trenches or chasmata on Venus such as those in the Dali-Diana chasmata area of eastern Aphrodite Terra."

https://openalex.org/W2033155629,"Observations with the Goldstone-Haystack radio interferometer of the quasars 3C 279 and 3C 273 have disclosed the presence of fine structure in their radio emissions. Although the interpretation is not unique, the fringe-amplitude data for quasar 3C 279 are quite consistent with emissions from two points, each contributing equally to the correlated flux. The separation of the two points is estimated to be (1.55 +/- 0.05) x 10(-3) arc second, or about 20 light years at the distance of 3 x 10(9) light years inferred from optical red-shift data. The formal uncertainty in the right-ascension component of the separation is about 6 x 10(-6) arc second; differential proper motion in this direction at half the speed of light could be discerned within a year. The fringe-amplitude data of quasar 3C 273 allow similar, but less definitive, interpretations."
https://openalex.org/W2031177847,"It appears that there is evidence for two main types of climatic fluctuations that have occurred during the Last Glaciation on two different time scales, one of the order of 40,000 years and another of the order of 3500 years. The Last Glaciation embraces at least two of the long periods (Fig. 1) upon which are superimposed oscillations of the short period (Table 1). Apparent contradictions in radiocarbon dates (19) are at least in part the result of miscorrelations between events on these two different time scales (20)."
https://openalex.org/W2021598334,"Because of their short dynamical lifetimes, the population of near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) must be resupplied. Two sources have been hypothesized: main-belt asteroids and extinct comet nuclei. The difficulty of making physical measurements for similar sized (diameter D less than 5 kilometers) main-belt asteroids and comet nuclei has limited comparative tests for distinguishing between these alternatives. A new survey of physical properties for D < 5 kilometers main-belt asteroids reveals that their spin rate and shape distributions are similar to those of NEAs, as is fully consistent with a main-belt origin for most NEAs. Physical data on comet nuclei are limited. If the existing sample is representative of the comet population, analysis of the asteroid and comet samples constrains the fraction of comet nuclei to between 0 and 40 percent of the total NEA population."

https://openalex.org/W1965140609,"Mansfield's Section 203 has triggered a searching review by DOD of its research. Using the general budget constraints of the past few years as an effective springboard, Mansfield went on to question and then challenge all of the federal government's policies for R & D. The entire post-World War II institutional machinery and rhetoric for R & D are now in some disarray and, thus, are open to imaginative, constructive change. Mission-oriented R & D, still central to progress toward our national goals, must be comprehensively rethought in order to restore the public confidence necessary for adequate support of science and technology."

The unusual gathering focused not on research results but on new techniques and instruments, particularly for biomedical science. As seen in the stories below, some of the most eye-catching innovations emerged at the intersection of physics and biology."
