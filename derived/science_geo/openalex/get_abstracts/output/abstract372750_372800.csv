https://openalex.org/W2100303404,"Tumors are characterized by extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling and stiffening. The importance of ECM remodeling to cancer is appreciated; the relevance of stiffening is less clear. We found that breast tumorigenesis is accompanied by collagen crosslinking, ECM stiffening, and increased focal adhesions. Induction of collagen crosslinking stiffened the ECM, promoted focal adhesions, enhanced PI3 kinase (PI3K) activity, and induced the invasion of an oncogene-initiated epithelium. Inhibition of integrin signaling repressed the invasion of a premalignant epithelium into a stiffened, crosslinked ECM and forced integrin clustering promoted focal adhesions, enhanced PI3K signaling, and induced the invasion of a premalignant epithelium. Consistently, reduction of lysyl oxidase-mediated collagen crosslinking prevented MMTV-Neu-induced fibrosis, decreased focal adhesions and PI3K activity, impeded malignancy, and lowered tumor incidence. These data show how collagen crosslinking can modulate tissue fibrosis and stiffness to force focal adhesions, growth factor signaling and breast malignancy."

Moscou and Bogdanove (p. 1501 , published online 29 October: see the cover) and Boch et al. (p. 1509 , published online 29 October) have now discovered how the similar but not identical repeats in the TAL proteins encode the specificity needed for the proteins to find their targets. Each repeat is specific for one DNA base pair, a specificity encoded by hypervariable amino acid positions. Combining several repeats with different amino acids in the hypervariable positions allowed the production of new effectors that targeted new DNA sites."

https://openalex.org/W2103706312,"Biofuel Backfire For compelling economical, geopolitical, and environmental reasons, biofuels are considered an attractive alternative to fossil fuels for meeting future global energy demands. Melillo et al. (p. 1397 , published online 22 October), however, suggest that a few serious drawbacks related to land use need to be considered. Based on a combined biogeochemistry and economic model, indirect land use (for example, clearing forested land for food crops to compensate for increased biofuel crop production on current farmlands) is predicted to generate more soil carbon loss than directly harvesting biofuel crops. Furthermore, increased fertilizer use for biofuels will add large amounts of nitrous oxide—a more effective heat-trapping molecule than carbon dioxide—to the atmosphere. Policy decisions regarding land and crop management thus need to consider the long-term implications of increased biofuel production."
https://openalex.org/W2096177579,"Background Countries worldwide recommend women planning pregnancy to use daily 400 µg of synthetic folic acid in the periconceptional period to prevent birth defects in children. The underlying mechanisms of this preventive effect are not clear, however, epigenetic modulation of growth processes by folic acid is hypothesized. Here, we investigated whether periconceptional maternal folic acid use and markers of global DNA methylation potential (S-adenosylmethionine and S-adenosylhomocysteine blood levels) in mothers and children affect methylation of the insulin-like growth factor 2 gene differentially methylation region (IGF2 DMR) in the child. Moreover, we tested whether the methylation of the IGF2 DMR was independently associated with birth weight. Methodology/Principal Findings IGF2 DMR methylation in 120 children aged 17 months (SD 0.3) of whom 86 mothers had used and 34 had not used folic acid periconceptionally were studied. Methylation was measured of 5 CpG dinucleotides covering the DMR using a mass spectrometry-based method. Children of mother who used folic acid had a 4.5% higher methylation of the IGF2 DMR than children who were not exposed to folic acid (49.5% vs. 47.4%; p = 0.014). IGF2 DMR methylation of the children also was associated with the S-adenosylmethionine blood level of the mother but not of the child (+1.7% methylation per SD S-adenosylmethionine; p = 0.037). Finally, we observed an inverse independent association between IGF2 DMR methylation and birth weight (−1.7% methylation per SD birthweight; p = 0.034). Conclusions Periconceptional folic acid use is associated with epigenetic changes in IGF2 in the child that may affect intrauterine programming of growth and development with consequences for health and disease throughout life. These results indicate plasticity of IGF2 methylation by periconceptional folic acid use."

In the face of such stresses, the plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) triggers adaptive physiological responses. Nishimura et al. (p. 1373 , published online 22 October; see the Perspective by Sussman and Phillips ) have now analyzed the crystal structure of one member of the ABA receptor family, PYR1 (pyrabactin resistance 1). The ABA molecule binds within an internal pocket of PYR1, where it probably induces a conformational change."

https://openalex.org/W1999169459,"Plasmonic Probing of Catalysis An understanding of catalytic reactions on surfaces, such as those used in industrial processes, often requires some measure of reactant concentration on the surface. Often this is expressed as the surface coverage of metal particles that are dispersed on oxide supports. Although optical probes of surface coverage would be convenient, they usually lack sufficient sensitivity to detect the small number of molecules on the surface. Larsson et al. (p. 1091 , published online 22 October) have used shifts in plasmon resonances to measure surface coverages. They grow oxide coatings, decorated with metal catalyst particles, on a nanoscale gold disk, and find that these model catalysts are within the region of plasmon sensitivity. Reactions such as CO oxidation on platinum can be followed for different ratios of reactant gases with a sensitivity of 0.1 monolayer of surface coverage."
https://openalex.org/W2102726935,"Detection of critical cancer gene mutations in clinical tumor specimens may predict patient outcomes and inform treatment options; however, high-throughput mutation profiling remains underdeveloped as a diagnostic approach. We report the implementation of a genotyping and validation algorithm that enables robust tumor mutation profiling in the clinical setting.We developed and implemented an optimized mutation profiling platform (""OncoMap"") to interrogate approximately 400 mutations in 33 known oncogenes and tumor suppressors, many of which are known to predict response or resistance to targeted therapies. The performance of OncoMap was analyzed using DNA derived from both frozen and FFPE clinical material in a diverse set of cancer types. A subsequent in-depth analysis was conducted on histologically and clinically annotated pediatric gliomas. The sensitivity and specificity of OncoMap were 93.8% and 100% in fresh frozen tissue; and 89.3% and 99.4% in FFPE-derived DNA. We detected known mutations at the expected frequencies in common cancers, as well as novel mutations in adult and pediatric cancers that are likely to predict heightened response or resistance to existing or developmental cancer therapies. OncoMap profiles also support a new molecular stratification of pediatric low-grade gliomas based on BRAF mutations that may have immediate clinical impact.Our results demonstrate the clinical feasibility of high-throughput mutation profiling to query a large panel of ""actionable"" cancer gene mutations. In the future, this type of approach may be incorporated into both cancer epidemiologic studies and clinical decision making to specify the use of many targeted anticancer agents."

https://openalex.org/W2005313354,"The quantitative analysis of Plasmodium development in the liver in laboratory animals in cultured cells is hampered by low parasite infection rates and the complicated methods required to monitor intracellular development. As a consequence, this important phase of the parasite's life cycle has been poorly studied compared to blood stages, for example in screening anti-malarial drugs. Here we report the use of a transgenic P. berghei parasite, PbGFP-Luc(con), expressing the bioluminescent reporter protein luciferase to visualize and quantify parasite development in liver cells both in culture and in live mice using real-time luminescence imaging. The reporter-parasite based quantification in cultured hepatocytes by real-time imaging or using a microplate reader correlates very well with established quantitative RT-PCR methods. For the first time the liver stage of Plasmodium is visualized in whole bodies of live mice and we were able to discriminate as few as 1-5 infected hepatocytes per liver in mice using 2D-imaging and to identify individual infected hepatocytes by 3D-imaging. The analysis of liver infections by whole body imaging shows a good correlation with quantitative RT-PCR analysis of extracted livers. The luminescence-based analysis of the effects of various drugs on in vitro hepatocyte infection shows that this method can effectively be used for in vitro screening of compounds targeting Plasmodium liver stages. Furthermore, by analysing the effect of primaquine and tafenoquine in vivo we demonstrate the applicability of real time imaging to assess parasite drug sensitivity in the liver. The simplicity and speed of quantitative analysis of liver-stage development by real-time imaging compared to the PCR methodologies, as well as the possibility to analyse liver development in live mice without surgery, opens up new possibilities for research on Plasmodium liver infections and for validating the effect of drugs and vaccines on the liver stage of Plasmodium."
https://openalex.org/W2138743768,"Hedgehog, Flatworms, and Regeneration The Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway plays pivotal roles during embryonic development, post-embryonic tissue maintenance, and disease. In spite of having at its core a collection of highly conserved components, the Hh pathway displays unusual differences in signal transduction mechanisms among flies, fish, and mammals. Using planarians (nonparasitic flatworms), Rink et al. (p. 1406 , published online 22 October) report a key role for Hh signaling during adult regeneration and provide evidence that the perplexing diversity of transduction mechanisms may have arisen from animal-specific losses of an ancestral association between cilia and Hh signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2066142707,"Understanding Hybrid Sterility The onset of reproductive barriers, or hybrid sterility, is a means of reinforcing genetic incompatibilities between isolated populations, leading to speciation. A handful of genes that underlie hybrid sterility have been discovered, but their molecular mechanism is generally unclear. Bayes and Malik (p. 1538 , published online 22 October) reveal that the hybrid sterility gene Odysseus-site Homeobox (OdsH) , which encodes a satellite-DNA binding protein, shows differential DNA binding patterns between the species Drosophila mauritiana and D. simulans ; OdsH derived from D. mauritiana localizes to the D. simulans Y chromosome, whereas OdsH derived from D. simulans does not. The incorrect expression, localization, and endurance of the OdsH protein appear to affect spermatogenesis in hybrid males, explaining the mechanism underlying hybrid sterility between these species. Thus, genetic incompatibilities between satellite-DNA and their binding proteins may represent a general basis for hybrid sterility in animals."
https://openalex.org/W1977286650,"Background Genome-wide scans of hundreds of thousands of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have resulted in the identification of new susceptibility variants to common diseases and are providing new insights into the genetic structure and relationships of human populations. Moreover, genome-wide data can be used to search for signals of recent positive selection, thereby providing new insights into the genetic adaptations that occurred as modern humans spread out of Africa and around the world. Methodology We genotyped approximately 500,000 SNPs in 255 individuals (5 individuals from each of 51 worldwide populations) from the Human Genome Diversity Panel (HGDP-CEPH). When merged with non-overlapping SNPs typed previously in 250 of these same individuals, the resulting data consist of over 950,000 SNPs. We then analyzed the genetic relationships and ancestry of individuals without assigning them to populations, and we also identified candidate regions of recent positive selection at both the population and regional (continental) level. Conclusions Our analyses both confirm and extend previous studies; in particular, we highlight the impact of various dispersals, and the role of substructure in Africa, on human genetic diversity. We also identified several novel candidate regions for recent positive selection, and a gene ontology (GO) analysis identified several GO groups that were significantly enriched for such candidate genes, including immunity and defense related genes, sensory perception genes, membrane proteins, signal receptors, lipid binding/metabolism genes, and genes involved in the nervous system. Among the novel candidate genes identified are two genes involved in the thyroid hormone pathway that show signals of selection in African Pygmies that may be related to their short stature."
https://openalex.org/W2108794048,"Background Preimplantation development is a crucial step in early human development. However, the molecular basis of human preimplantation development is not well known. Methodology By applying microarray on 397 human oocytes and embryos at six developmental stages, we studied the transcription dynamics during human preimplantation development. Principal Findings We found that the preimplantation development consisted of two main transitions: from metaphase-II oocyte to 4-cell embryo where mainly the maternal genes were expressed, and from 8-cell embryo to blastocyst with down-regulation of the maternal genes and up-regulation of embryonic genes. Human preimplantation development proved relatively autonomous. Genes predominantly expressed in oocytes and embryos are well conserved during evolution. Significance Our database and findings provide fundamental resources for understanding the genetic network controlling early human development."
https://openalex.org/W2000604066,"A clinically-related animal model of Parkinson's disease (PD) may enable the elucidation of the etiology of the disease and assist the development of medications. However, none of the current neurotoxin-based models recapitulates the main clinical features of the disease or the pathological hallmarks, such as dopamine (DA) neuron specificity of degeneration and Lewy body formation, which limits the use of these models in PD research. To overcome these limitations, we developed a rat model by stereotaxically (ST) infusing small doses of the mitochondrial complex-I inhibitor, rotenone, into two brain sites: the right ventral tegmental area and the substantia nigra. Four weeks after ST rotenone administration, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunoreactivity in the infusion side decreased by 43.7%, in contrast to a 75.8% decrease observed in rats treated systemically with rotenone (SYS). The rotenone infusion also reduced the DA content, the glutathione and superoxide dismutase activities, and induced alpha-synuclein expression, when compared to the contralateral side. This ST model displays neither peripheral toxicity or mortality and has a high success rate. This rotenone-based ST model thus recapitulates the slow and specific loss of DA neurons and better mimics the clinical features of idiopathic PD, representing a reliable and more clinically-related model for PD research."
https://openalex.org/W2087787271,"Anandamide (AEA) and other bioactive N-acylethanolamines (NAEs) are primarily inactivated by the enzyme fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH). Recently, FAAH-2 was discovered in humans, suggesting an additional enzyme can mediate NAE inactivation in higher mammals. Here, we performed a biochemical characterization of FAAH-2 and explored its capacity to hydrolyze NAEs in cells. In homogenate activity assays, FAAH-2 hydrolyzed AEA and palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) with activities ∼6 and ∼20% those of FAAH, respectively. In contrast, FAAH-2 hydrolyzed AEA and PEA in intact cells with rates ∼30–40% those of FAAH, highlighting a potentially greater contribution toward NAE catabolism in vivo than previously appreciated. In contrast to endoplasmic reticulum-localized FAAH, immunofluorescence revealed FAAH-2 was localized on lipid droplets. Supporting this distribution pattern, the putative N-terminal hydrophobic region of FAAH-2 was identified as a functional lipid droplet localization sequence. Lipid droplet localization was essential for FAAH-2 activity as chimeras excluded from lipid droplets lacked activity and/or were poorly expressed. Lipid droplets represent novel sites of NAE inactivation. Therefore, we examined substrate delivery to these organelles. AEA was readily trafficked to lipid droplets, confirming that lipid droplets constitute functional sites of NAE inactivation. Collectively, these results establish FAAH-2 as a bone fide NAE-catabolizing enzyme and suggest that NAE inactivation is spatially separated in cells of higher mammals.

In contrast, FAAH-2 but not FAAH is expressed in heart and ovary, suggesting that these enzymes may regulate overlapping yet distinct NAE pools in vivo. In this study, we examined the contribution of FAAH-2 toward NAE hydrolysis in intact cells and explored how its subcellular localization affects its activity. COS-7 and HeLa cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). DMEM, streptomycin, penicillin, sodium pyruvate, and fetal bovine serum were from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). AEA and PEA were from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI). [14C]AEA (ethanolamine-1-14C, 53 mCi/mmol) and [14C]PEA (ethanolamine-1-14C, 53 mCi/mmol) were from the National Institute on Drug Abuse Drug Supply Program. Fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (BSA) was from Sigma. BODIPY 493/503 was from molecular probes (Carlsbad, CA). FAAH-2 cDNA was kindly provided by Benjamin F. Cravatt (The Scripps Research Institute). The sequence of the FAAH-2 cDNA provided to us slightly differed from the published mRNA sequence (NM_174912) through the following alterations: T99C, C822T, and G1077A. These changes did not alter the corresponding amino acid sequence. To generate FLAG-tagged FAAH-2, a FLAG epitope was incorporated into the C terminus of FAAH-2 by PCR and was inserted into pcDNA4. To generate Myc-tagged FAAH-2, the FAAH-2 cDNA lacking a stop codon was inserted into the pcDNA4/Myc-His plasmid (Clontech). To generate ER lumen-localized FAAH-2 (CAL-ΔTMFAAH2-FLAG), the putative N-terminal transmembrane region (TM) of FAAH-2 (residues 1–28) was replaced with the signal sequence (1–26) from mouse calreticulin. CAL-ΔTMFAAH-FLAG was generated by fusion of the calreticulin signal sequence to ΔTMFAAH-FLAG (residues 30–579). In CAL-ΔTMFAAH(N/Q)-FLAG, asparagine 334 in the consensus sequence for N-linked glycosylation was mutated to glutamine. FAAH(N)-ΔTMFAAH2-FLAG contains the N terminus of human FAAH (residues 1–32). ΔTMFAAH2-FLAG contains residues 35–532 of FAAH-2 and an N-terminal methionine. FAAH2(N)-RFP and FAAH2(N)-rΔTMFAAH-FLAG contain the N terminus of FAAH-2 (residues 1–35) fused to the N termini of DsRed2 or rat ΔTMFAAH-FLAG (residues 30–579), respectively. See Fig. 4A for a schematic of the above-mentioned constructs. The adipose differentiation-related protein (ADRP) expression plasmid has been previously described (12Listenberger L.L.

All constructs were confirmed by sequencing. Twenty-four hours following transfection with the indicated plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), the cells were plated at ∼90% confluency in 35-mm dishes. The cells were washed twice in DMEM and subsequently incubated for 5 min, 1 min, or 3 s with 750 μl of [14C]AEA (100 nm) or [14C]PEA (100 nm or 1 μm) that were respectively pre-equilibrated for 75 or 90 min in medium containing 0.15% defatted BSA as previously described (13Kaczocha M. Glaser S.T. Deutsch D.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 6375-6380Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Following the incubation, 750 μl of ice-cold DMEM plus 0.15% BSA was added to the plates, the media separated from cells, which were then washed with DMEM plus 0.15% BSA to remove non-specifically bound AEA or PEA. The cells were scraped three times with 400 μl of ice-cold 2 mm EDTA in PBS and two volumes of chloroform:methanol (1:1) added to the media and cells, and the phases were separated by centrifugation. The resulting aqueous (containing [14C]ethanolamine) and organic (containing intact [14C]AEA/PEA) phases were counted by liquid scintillation counting. [14C]AEA/PEA uptake was determined by summing the production of [14C]ethanolamine in the media and cells with intact cellular [14C]AEA/PEA. Hydrolysis of [14C]AEA/PEA was quantified by production of [14C]ethanolamine in the media and cells. Statistical significance was determined between transfected cells and FAAH-transfected controls. Immunolocalization experiments were performed essentially as described (14Glaser S.T. Abumrad N.A. Fatade F. Kaczocha M. Studholme K.M. Deutsch D.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Briefly, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min, permeabilized on ice with 0.2% Triton X-100 in 5% goat serum for 5 min, and incubated for 1 h with primary antibodies as follows: rabbit anti-calreticulin (1:200, Affinity Bioreagents, Golden, CO), mouse anti-FLAG M2 (1:500, Sigma), or mouse anti-Myc (1:500, from Jen-Chih Hsieh, Stony Brook University). To visualize neutral lipids, COS-7 or HeLa cells were respectively treated with 1 or 2 μg/ml BODIPY 493/503 during secondary antibody incubations. All images were acquired using a Zeiss LSM 510 META NLO two-photon laser scanning microscope. Proteins in cell homogenates were resolved by SDS-PAGE as described (13Kaczocha M. Glaser S.T.

Following transfer to a nitrocellulose membrane at 100 V for 25 min, the blots were blocked for 1 h in 5% nonfat dry milk in PBS Tween (PBST). The blots were probed with mouse anti-FLAG M2 (1:2,000), mouse anti-β-actin (1:20,000, Abcam, Cambridge, MA), or mouse anti-Myc (1:5,000) antibodies for 1 h with shaking. The blots were rinsed three times with PBST and incubated with goat anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 1 h. The blots were rinsed three times with PBST, developed using the Immun-star horseradish peroxidase substrate (Bio-Rad), and exposed to film. COS-7 or HeLa cells transiently transfected with the indicated proteins were pelleted and resuspended in buffer containing 10 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm EDTA, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, and 250 mm sucrose, and homogenized by passage through a 26-gauge needle. Unbroken cells and nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 10 min, and the resulting supernatants were subjected to centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C. The membrane pellets were resuspended in buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 8, 3 mm CaCl2, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 100 mm NaCl, 250 mm sucrose and treated with 500 μg/ml proteinase K for 30 min at 37 °C in the presence or absence of 1% Triton X-100, or left untreated. The reactions were quenched by the addition of 20 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by immunoblotting with anti-FLAG (1:2,000) or anti-calreticulin (1:2,000) antibodies. FAAH activity assays were performed as previously described with modifications (14Glaser S.T. Abumrad N.A. Fatade F. Kaczocha M. Studholme K.M. Deutsch D.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 4269-4274Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell homogenates were incubated with 100 μm AEA or PEA plus 0.1 μCi of [14C]AEA/PEA in Tris-HCl (pH 9) containing 0.1% BSA. For kinetic analyses (apparent Km and Vmax), time and protein concentrations were determined to maintain substrate conversion at ∼10% while varying substrate concentrations from 0.1 to 100 μm. Reactions were stopped by the addition of two volumes of 1:1 chloroform:methanol, and the phases were separated by centrifugation. The methanol phase (containing [14C]ethanolamine) was sampled and quantified using a Beckman LS 6500 scintillation counter. HeLa cells grown in 10-cm dishes were co-transfected with ADRP and the indicated plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000. Five hours later, the media were replaced with DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 400 μm oleic acid complexed to defatted BSA (oleic acid to BSA ratio of 6.6:1) and incubated overnight as described (12Listenberger L.L. Ostermeyer-Fay A.G. Goldberg E.B. Brown W.J. Brown D.A. J. Lipid Res. 2007; 48: 2751-2761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Cells fed overnight with oleic acid accumulate neutral lipids and possess enlarged lipid droplets. Three plates of FAAH2-FLAG-, one plate of FAAH-FLAG-, and three plates of FAAH2(N)-rΔTMFAAH-FLAG-transfected cells were homogenized in 10 mm Hepes/5 mm EDTA containing 10% sucrose and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), and then centrifuged at 1,000 × g to pellet unbroken cells. The resulting supernatant (700 μl) was overlaid with ∼ 4.3 ml of 10 mm Hepes/5 mm EDTA and spun in a Beckman L8–55 centrifuge at 280,000 × g for 3 h at 4 °C. Fractions (∼700 μl) were collected from the top, and the pellets were resuspended in Hepes buffer. Following acetone precipitation, the samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with rabbit anti-calnexin (1:5,000, Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO), mouse anti-FLAG (1:2,000), or guinea pig anti-ADRP antibodies (1:400, RDI Division of Fitzgerald Industries, Concord, MA). The blots were subsequently incubated with goat anti-mouse, goat anti-rabbit, or rabbit anti-guinea pig IgG horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies (1:8,000, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and visualized on film. HeLa cells transfected with FAAH-FLAG, FAAH2(N)-rΔTMFAAH-FLAG, or CAL-ΔTMFAAH-FLAG were homogenized, and membrane fractions were generated as described above. A small pool (∼5 μg) of the cytosolic fraction (expressing β-actin) was added to the membranes (40 μg) prior to PNGase F treatment. The membranes were subsequently boiled for 10 min at 100 °C and incubated in the presence or absence of PNGase F (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) for 60 min at 37 °C. The samples were then separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by immunoblotting with anti-FLAG (1:2,000) or anti-β-actin (1:20,000) antibodies. All results represent means ± S.E. of at least three independent experiments. Statistical analyses were performed using two-tailed unpaired Student’s t tests with GraphPad Prism. FAAH-2 displayed optimal in vitro activity at pH 9 (data not shown), confirming previous results (11Wei B.Q. Mikkelsen T.S. McKinney M.K. Lander E.S. Cravatt B.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 36569-36578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Enzyme kinetics of FAAH-2 were analyzed in homogenates of FAAH-2-transfected HeLa cells using AEA and PEA as substrates. FAAH-2 hydrolyzed AEA with rates that were ∼6% those of FAAH (Fig. 1A). PEA hydrolysis by FAAH-2 was ∼20% that of FAAH. The apparent Vmax and Km values of FAAH-2 for AEA were 0.71 ± 0.04 nmol/mg/min and 7.9 ± 1.5 μm, respectively (Fig. 1B). For PEA, the apparent Vmax and Km values were 1.21 ± 0.1 nmol/mg/min and 4.3 ± 1.4 μm, respectively (Fig. 1C). The contributions of FAAH and FAAH-2 toward NAE hydrolysis were examined in transiently transfected HeLa cells using an established protocol and physiological (100 nm to 1 μm) substrate concentrations (13Kaczocha M. Glaser S.T. Deutsch D.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 6375-6380Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 15Kaczocha M. Hermann A. Glaser S.T. Bojesen I.N. Deutsch D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9066-9075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). A time course of [14C]AEA (100 nm) uptake and hydrolysis revealed that HeLa cells expressing FAAH hydrolyzed ∼74% of the [14C]AEA taken up by cells at 1 min and ∼85% at 5 min (Fig. 2A). FAAH-2 expressing cells hydrolyzed ∼29% of the [14C]AEA taken up by cells at 1 min and ∼61% at 5 min. Therefore, FAAH-2-transfected cells hydrolyzed [14C]AEA with moderately lower efficiency (p < 0.05) compared with cells expressing FAAH (Fig. 2A), but at a rate ∼5-fold higher than in the homogenate activity assay. Because AEA uptake is coupled to its hydrolysis (16Day T.A. Rakhshan F. Deutsch D.G. Barker E.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 1369-1375Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 17Deutsch D.G. Glaser S.T. Howell J.M. Kunz J.S. Puffenbarger R.A. Hillard C.J. Abumrad N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6967-6973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), FAAH-2-transfected cells internalized less [14C]AEA compared with FAAH-transfected controls at 5 min due to reduced AEA hydrolysis. Mock transfected cells hydrolyzed ∼7 and ∼8% of the AEA taken up by cells at 1 and 5 min, respectively. AEA hydrolysis was also examined using the physiologically more relevant time point of 3 s. Similar to the results above, intracellular [14C]AEA hydrolysis in FAAH-2-expressing cells was moderately lower (p < 0.05) compared with FAAH-transfected cells (Fig. 2C). Following subtraction of mock transfected controls, the data revealed that FAAH-2 hydrolyzed AEA with a rate ∼30% that of FAAH. Similar results were observed in COS-7 cells (data not shown). PEA inactivation followed a similar trend. FAAH hydrolyzed ∼60 and ∼77% of the [14C]PEA (100 nm) taken up by cells at 1 and 5 min, respectively (Fig. 2B). [14C]PEA metabolism was lower in cells transfected with FAAH-2, with ∼29 and ∼59% hydrolysis at 1 and 5 min, respectively. [14C]PEA hydrolysis in mock transfected cells reached ∼7 and 11% at 1 and 5 min, respectively. Similar results were obtained with 1 μm PEA (data not shown). It is noteworthy that, in contrast to AEA, PEA uptake does not appear to be coupled to its hydrolysis by FAAH (18Jacobsson S.O. Fowler C.J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 132: 1743-1754Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained in this study (Fig. 2B). This may result from intracellularly sequestered PEA that is not in equilibrium with extracellular PEA. Similar to AEA, [14C]PEA hydrolysis at 3 s was lower (p < 0.05) in cells expressing FAAH-2 compared with FAAH (Fig. 2C). Following subtraction of [14C]PEA metabolism in mock transfected controls, FAAH-2 hydrolyzed [14C]PEA with a rate ∼40% that of FAAH. Collectively, these data provide evidence that FAAH-2 is an efficient NAE-hydrolyzing enzyme in intact cells. Because the efficiency of enzyme activity is related to substrate delivery, the subcellular localization of FAAH-2 was compared with FAAH. FAAH-2 constructs containing FLAG or Myc epitope tags were employed for the immunolocalization studies. Immunofluorescence revealed that, in transfected COS-7 and HeLa cells, FAAH2-FLAG localized to ring-like, hollow cytoplasmic structures that did not overlap with the ER marker calreticulin (Fig. 3A). In addition to these structures, a minor pool of ER-localized FAAH-2 was typically observed in COS-7 cells (in ∼60% of cells) and less frequently in HeLa cells (<10% of cells). These cytoplasmic structures are morphologically similar to lipid droplets/adiposomes (19Smirnova E. Goldberg E.B. Makarova K.S. Lin L. Brown W.J. Jackson C.L. EMBO Rep. 2006; 7: 106-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Lipid droplets are composed of a neutral lipid core surrounded by a phospholipid monolayer and serve as sites of triglyceride and cholesteryl ester storage and mobilization (20Thiele C. Spandl J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2008; 20: 378-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The neutral lipid/lipid droplet-specific dye BODIPY 493/503 was employed to determine whether FAAH-2 localized to lipid droplets (12Listenberger L.L. Ostermeyer-Fay A.G. Goldberg E.B. Brown W.J. Brown D.A. J. Lipid Res. 2007; 48: 2751-2761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). In COS-7 and HeLa cells, FLAG- and Myc-tagged FAAH-2 co-localized with BODIPY 493/503 (Fig. 3B). These results confirmed that FAAH-2 is present on lipid droplets and that its subcellular distribution is independent of the epitope tag and cell-type used. FAAH-2 was present solely on the phospholipid surface of lipid droplets and was excluded from BODIPY493/503-positive neutral lipid cores (Fig. 3C) (21Tauchi-Sato K. Ozeki S. Houjou T. Taguchi R. Fujimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44507-44512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). In contrast to FAAH-2, FAAH did not localize to lipid droplets (Fig. 3D). Our next goal was to confirm the localization of FAAH-2 to lipid droplets by subcellular fractionation. To facilitate isolation of lipid droplets by gradient centrifugation, we needed to enlarge lipid droplets by overnight incubation with oleic acid. For this reason, we first verified that oleic acid incubation did not affect the localization of FAAH-2 as judged by fluorescence microscopy. Indeed, incubation of cells in oleic acid did not alter the localization of FAAH-2, although a minor pool of FAAH appeared to have redistributed to lipid droplets (Fig. 3E). HeLa cells were co-transfected with the lipid droplet-resident protein ADRP and either FAAH-FLAG or FAAH2-FLAG, cultured overnight in media supplemented with oleic acid, and subsequently fractionated by ultracentrifugation as previously described (12Listenberger L.L. Ostermeyer-Fay A.G. Goldberg E.B. Brown W.J. Brown D.A. J. Lipid Res. 2007; 48: 2751-2761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Following ultracentrifugation, fractions were collected from the top to isolate lipid droplets. The separation of lipid droplets from ER membranes was confirmed by the distribution of ADRP to fraction 1 and the ER marker calnexin to fraction 7 and the pellet (Fig. 3F). FAAH2-FLAG was present solely in the ADRP-positive fraction 1 and was excluded from calnexin-positive fractions. As expected, FAAH-FLAG distributed solely to the calnexin-positive fraction and was excluded from lipid droplets. Lastly, we used proteinase K protection analysis of post-nuclear supernatants of FAAH-2-expressing cells to verify that FAAH-2 is a cytoplasmically oriented enzyme, as predicted by its lipid droplet localization. This was necessary, because FAAH-2 was proposed to reside in luminal membrane compartments (11Wei B.Q. Mikkelsen T.S. McKinney M.K. Lander E.S. Cravatt B.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 36569-36578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). FAAH-2 was efficiently degraded by proteinase K, showing that little or none of the protein was present in the lumen of the ER or other organelles (Fig. 3G). As expected, the cytoplasmically oriented FAAH (11Wei B.Q. Mikkelsen T.S. McKinney M.K. Lander E.S. Cravatt B.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 36569-36578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 13Kaczocha M. Glaser S.T. Deutsch D.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 6375-6380Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) was also completely degraded by proteinase K. Taken together, the fractionation, immunofluorescence, and protease protection results confirm the lipid droplet localization of FAAH-2. We next sought to determine the functional significance of lipid droplet localization upon FAAH-2 activity. Toward this end, we attempted to generate FAAH-2 variants that were excluded from lipid droplets (Fig. 4A). We first decided to target FAAH-2 to the cytoplasmic face of the ER by replacing its putative N-terminal TM region (residues 1–34) with the analogous domain of FAAH (residues 1–32). The resulting construct, FAAH(N)-ΔTMFAAH2-FLAG, was expressed at a comparable level to FAAH-2 (Fig. 4B). Protease protection analysis revealed that FAAH(N)-ΔTMFAAH2-FLAG was localized to the cytoplasmic face of membranes (Fig. 5A). Immunofluorescence analysis showed that the protein did not co-localize with BODIPY 493/503, confirming its exclusion from lipid droplets (Fig. 5B). Unexpectedly, enzymatic analysis revealed that FAAH(N)-ΔTMFAAH2-FLAG was catalytically inactive (Fig. 4C). We next made a second FAAH-2 variant, ΔTMFAAH2-FLAG, by deleting the N-terminal hydrophobic domain from FAAH-2 (Fig. 4A). We predicted that, similar to ΔTM-FAAH (7Arreaza G. Deutsch D.G. FEBS Lett. 1999; 454: 57-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 22Patricelli M.P. Lashuel H.A. Giang D.K. Kelly J.W. Cravatt B.F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15177-15187Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), this protein would localize to the cytoplasmic face of the ER. Unexpectedly, the expression of this construct was significantly reduced compared with FAAH-2 (Fig. 4B). This suggested that FAAH-2, unlike FAAH (7Arreaza G. Deutsch D.G. FEBS Lett. 1999; 454: 57-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 22Patricelli M.P. Lashuel H.A. Giang D.K. Kelly J.W. Cravatt B.F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15177-15187Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), requires an N-terminal hydrophobic region for stable expression. Nevertheless, ΔTMFAAH2-FLAG behaved in a similar manner to FAAH(N)-ΔTMFAAH2-FLAG: it localized to the cytoplasmic face of membranes (Fig. 5A) and was enzymatically inactive (Fig. 4C). FAAH-2 was previously suggested to reside in the ER lumen (11Wei B.Q. Mikkelsen T.S. McKinney M.K. Lander E.S. Cravatt B.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 36569-36578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Therefore, we sought to determine whether a FAAH-2 variant that was re-localized to the ER lumen would retain its activity. A luminally oriented FAAH-2 chimera was generated by replacing the hydrophobic N terminus of FAAH2 with the signal sequence of mouse calreticulin (residues 1–26) (Fig. 4A). CAL-ΔTMFAAH2-FLAG was protected from protease digestion unless membranes were dissolved with Triton X-100, consistent with translocation into the ER lumen (Fig. 5A). Unexpectedly, though, its expression was extremely low (Fig. 4B). The reduced expression of CAL-ΔTMFAAH2-FLAG may have resulted from instability of the protein following cleavage of the calreticulin signal sequence within the ER lumen. Therefore, we engineered a luminally oriented fusion protein that would retain the N terminus of FAAH-2 following signal sequence cleavage. However, similar to CAL-ΔTMFAAH2-FLAG, this chimera was also poorly expressed (data not shown). These proteins were not detected in the media, ruling out secretion as a cause for the apparent low protein expression (data not shown). Similar to the cytoplasmically oriented FAAH-2 variants, the luminally oriented CAL-ΔTMFAAH2-FLAG was also catalytically inactive (Fig. 4C). To determine whether the lack of FAAH-2 expression in the ER lumen was intrinsic to this enzyme, a luminally oriented FAAH construct was prepared (Fig. 4A). Similar to its FAAH-2 counterpart, CAL-ΔTMFAAH-FLAG localized to the luminal face of ER membranes (Fig. 5, A and B). However, despite a reduction in expression, CAL-ΔTMFAAH-FLAG retained its enzymatic activity (Fig. 4, B and C). These results suggest that FAAH is a versatile enzyme capable of functioning in both reducing (cytosol) and oxidizing (ER) environments. In contrast, FAAH-2 is an enzyme adapted to enzymatic activity on the lipid droplet surface. We next sought to identify the lipid droplet-targeting sequence of FAAH-2. Our efforts focused upon the N-terminal hydrophobic region of FAAH-2, because its removal abrogated the activity and lipid droplet localization of the enzyme (Figs. 4C"
https://openalex.org/W1967145414,"Background Hepcidin is a major regulator of iron metabolism and plays a key role in anemia of chronic disease, reducing intestinal iron uptake and release from body iron stores. Hypoxia and chemical stabilizers of the hypoxia-inducible transcription factor (HIF) have been shown to suppress hepcidin expression. We therefore investigated the role of HIF in hepcidin regulation. Methodology/Principal Findings Hepcidin mRNA was down-regulated in hepatoma cells by chemical HIF stabilizers and iron chelators, respectively. In contrast, the response to hypoxia was variable. The decrease in hepcidin mRNA was not reversed by HIF-1α or HIF-2α knock-down or by depletion of the HIF and iron regulatory protein (IRP) target transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1). However, the response of hepcidin to hypoxia and chemical HIF inducers paralleled the regulation of transferrin receptor 2 (TfR2), one of the genes critical to hepcidin expression. Hepcidin expression was also markedly and rapidly decreased by serum deprivation, independent of transferrin-bound iron, and by the phosphatidylinositol 3 (PI3) kinase inhibitor LY294002, indicating that growth factors are required for hepcidin expression in vitro. Hepcidin promoter constructs mirrored the response of mRNA levels to interleukin-6 and bone morphogenetic proteins, but not consistently to hypoxia or HIF stabilizers, and deletion of the putative HIF binding motifs did not alter the response to different hypoxic stimuli. In mice exposed to carbon monoxide, hypoxia or the chemical HIF inducer N-oxalylglycine, liver hepcidin 1 mRNA was elevated rather than decreased. Conclusions/Significance Taken together, these data indicate that hepcidin is neither a direct target of HIF, nor indirectly regulated by HIF through induction of TfR1 expression. Hepcidin mRNA expression in vitro is highly sensitive to the presence of serum factors and PI3 kinase inhibition and parallels TfR2 expression."
https://openalex.org/W2061878472,"It is well known that mechanical forces are crucial in regulating functions of every tissue and organ in a human body. However, it remains unclear how mechanical forces are transduced into biochemical activities and biological responses at the cellular and molecular level. Using the magnetic twisting cytometry technique, we applied local mechanical stresses to living human airway smooth muscle cells with a magnetic bead bound to the cell surface via transmembrane adhesion molecule integrins. The temporal and spatial activation of Rac, a small guanosine triphosphatase, was quantified using a fluorescent resonance energy transfer (FRET) method that measures changes in Rac activity in response to mechanical stresses by quantifying intensity ratios of ECFP (enhanced cyan fluorescent protein as a donor) and YPet (a variant yellow fluorescent protein as an acceptor) of the Rac biosensor. The applied stress induced rapid activation (less than 300 ms) of Rac at the cell periphery. In contrast, platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) induced Rac activation at a much later time (>30 sec). There was no stress-induced Rac activation when a mutant form of the Rac biosensor (RacN17) was transfected or when the magnetic bead was coated with transferrin or with poly-L-lysine. It is known that PDGF-induced Rac activation depends on Src activity. Surprisingly, pre-treatment of the cells with specific Src inhibitor PP1 or knocking-out Src gene had no effects on stress-induced Rac activation. In addition, eliminating lipid rafts through extraction of cholesterol from the plasma membrane did not prevent stress-induced Rac activation, suggesting a raft-independent mechanism in governing the Rac activation upon mechanical stimulation. Further evidence indicates that Rac activation by stress depends on the magnitudes of the applied stress and cytoskeletal integrity. Our results suggest that Rac activation by mechanical forces is rapid, direct and does not depend on Src activation. These findings suggest that signaling pathways of mechanical forces via integrins might be fundamentally different from those of growth factors."

https://openalex.org/W2048330056,"Background Presenilin 1(PS1) is the catalytic subunit of γ-secretase, the enzyme responsible for the Aβ C-terminal cleavage site, which results in the production of Aβ peptides of various lengths. Production of longer forms of the Aβ peptide occur in patients with autosomal dominant Alzheimer disease (AD) due to mutations in presenilin. Many modulators of γ-secretase function have been described. We hypothesize that these modulators act by a common mechanism by allosterically modifying the structure of presenilin. Methodology/Principal Findings To test this hypothesis we generated a genetically encoded GFP-PS1-RFP (G-PS1-R) FRET probe that allows monitoring of the conformation of the PS1 molecule in its native environment in live cells. We show that G-PS1-R can be incorporated into the γ-secretase complex, reconstituting its activity in PS1/2 deficient cells. Using Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based approaches we show that various pharmacological and genetic manipulations that target either γ-secretase components (PS1, Pen2, Aph1) or γ-secretase substrate (amyloid precursor protein, APP) and are known to change Aβ42 production are associated with a consistent conformational change in PS1. Conclusions/Significance These results strongly support the hypothesis that allosteric changes in PS1 conformation underlie changes in the Aβ42/40 ratio. Direct measurement of physiological and pathological changes in the conformation of PS1/γ-secretase may provide insight into molecular mechanism of Aβ42 generation, which could be exploited therapeutically."
https://openalex.org/W2067898673,"Background It has been shown that selenium-binding protein 1 (SBP1) is significantly downregulated in different human cancers. Its regulation and function have not yet been established. Methodology and Principal Findings We show that the SBP1 promoter is hypermethylated in colon cancer tissues and human colon cancer cells. Treatment with 5′-Aza-2′-deoxycytidine leads to demethylation of the SBP1 promoter and to an increase of SBP1 promoter activity, rescues SBP1 mRNA and protein expression in human colon cancer cells. Additionally, overexpression of SBP1 sensitizes colon cancer cells to H2O2-induced apoptosis, inhibits cancer cell migration in vitro and inhibits tumor growth in nude mice. Conclusion and Significance These data demonstrate that SBP1 has tumor suppressor functions that are inhibited in colorectal cancer through epigenetic silencing."
https://openalex.org/W2010153447,"Determining the structure of ectoparasite-host networks will enable disease ecologists to better understand and predict the spread of vector-borne diseases. If these networks have consistent properties, then studying the structure of well-understood networks could lead to extrapolation of these properties to others, including those that support emerging pathogens. Borrowing a quantitative measure of network structure from studies of mutualistic relationships between plants and their pollinators, we analyzed 29 ectoparasite-vertebrate host networks--including three derived from molecular bloodmeal analysis of mosquito feeding patterns--using measures of nestedness to identify non-random interactions among species. We found significant nestedness in ectoparasite-vertebrate host lists for habitats ranging from tropical rainforests to polar environments. These networks showed non-random patterns of nesting, and did not differ significantly from published estimates of nestedness from mutualistic networks. Mutualistic and antagonistic networks appear to be organized similarly, with generalized ectoparasites interacting with hosts that attract many ectoparasites and more specialized ectoparasites usually interacting with these same ""generalized"" hosts. This finding has implications for understanding the network dynamics of vector-born pathogens. We suggest that nestedness (rather than random ectoparasite-host associations) can allow rapid transfer of pathogens throughout a network, and expand upon such concepts as the dilution effect, bridge vectors, and host switching in the context of nested ectoparasite-vertebrate host networks."
https://openalex.org/W1979486115,"The emergence in 2009 of a swine-origin H1N1 influenza virus as the first pandemic of the 21st Century is a timely reminder of the international public health impact of influenza viruses, even those associated with mild disease. The widespread distribution of highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza virus in the avian population has spawned concern that it may give rise to a human influenza pandemic. The mortality rate associated with occasional human infection by H5N1 virus approximates 60%, suggesting that an H5N1 pandemic would be devastating to global health and economy. To date, the H5N1 virus has not acquired the propensity to transmit efficiently between humans. The reasons behind this are unclear, especially given the high mutation rate associated with influenza virus replication. Here we used a panel of recombinant H5 hemagglutinin (HA) variants to demonstrate the potential for H5 HA to bind human airway epithelium, the predominant target tissue for influenza virus infection and spread. While parental H5 HA exhibited limited binding to human tracheal epithelium, introduction of selected mutations converted the binding profile to that of a current human influenza strain HA. Strikingly, these amino-acid changes required multiple simultaneous mutations in the genomes of naturally occurring H5 isolates. Moreover, H5 HAs bearing intermediate sequences failed to bind airway tissues and likely represent mutations that are an evolutionary ""dead end."" We conclude that, although genetic changes that adapt H5 to human airways can be demonstrated, they may not readily arise during natural virus replication. This genetic barrier limits the likelihood that current H5 viruses will originate a human pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W2029384396,"NOD-like receptors (NLRs) are a group of cytoplasmic molecules that recognize microbial invasion or 'danger signals'. Activation of NLRs can induce rapid caspase-1 dependent cell death termed pyroptosis, or a caspase-1 independent cell death termed pyronecrosis. Bacillus anthracis lethal toxin (LT), is recognized by a subset of alleles of the NLR protein Nlrp1b, resulting in pyroptotic cell death of macrophages and dendritic cells. Here we show that LT induces lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP). The presentation of LMP requires expression of an LT-responsive allele of Nlrp1b, and is blocked by proteasome inhibitors and heat shock, both of which prevent LT-mediated pyroptosis. Further the lysosomal protease cathepsin B is released into the cell cytosol and cathepsin inhibitors block LT-mediated cell death. These data reveal a role for lysosomal membrane permeabilization in the cellular response to bacterial pathogens and demonstrate a shared requirement for cytosolic relocalization of cathepsins in pyroptosis and pyronecrosis."
https://openalex.org/W2131765789,"Background Formation of blood vessels requires the concerted regulation of an unknown number of genes in a spatial-, time- and dosage-dependent manner. Determining genes, which drive vascular maturation is crucial for the identification of new therapeutic targets against pathological angiogenesis. Methology/Principal Findings We accessed global gene regulation throughout maturation of the chick chorio-allantoic membrane (CAM), a highly vascularized tissue, using pan genomic microarrays. Seven percent of analyzed genes showed a significant change in expression (>2-fold, FDR<5%) with a peak occurring from E7 to E10, when key morphogenetic and angiogenic genes such as BMP4, SMO, HOXA3, EPAS1 and FGFR2 were upregulated, reflecting the state of an activated endothelium. At later stages, a general decrease in gene expression occurs, including genes encoding mitotic factors or angiogenic mediators such as CYR61, EPAS1, MDK and MYC. We identified putative human orthologs for 77% of significantly regulated genes and determined endothelial cell enrichment for 20% of the orthologs in silico. Vascular expression of several genes including ENC1, FSTL1, JAM2, LDB2, LIMS1, PARVB, PDE3A, PRCP, PTRF and ST6GAL1 was demonstrated by in situ hybridization. Up to 9% of the CAM genes were also overexpressed in human organs with related functions, such as placenta and lung or the thyroid. 21–66% of CAM genes enriched in endothelial cells were deregulated in several human cancer types (P<.0001). Interfering with PARVB (encoding parvin, beta) function profoundly changed human endothelial cell shape, motility and tubulogenesis, suggesting an important role of this gene in the angiogenic process. Conclusions/Significance Our study underlines the complexity of gene regulation in a highly vascularized organ during development. We identified a restricted number of novel genes enriched in the endothelium of different species and tissues, which may play crucial roles in normal and pathological angiogenesis."

The outward rectification and time dependence of IClC-3 closely resemble an endogenous HEK293 cell acid-activated Cl− current (IClacid) seen at extracellular pH ≤ 5.5. IClacid was present in smooth muscle cells from wild-type but not ClC-3 null mice. We therefore sought to determine whether these currents were related. IClacid was larger in cells expressing Ad-ClC-3. Protons shifted the reversal potential (Erev) of IClC-3 between pH 8.2 and 6.2, but not pH 6.2 and 5.2, suggesting that Cl− and H+ transport become uncoupled at low pH. At pH 4.0 Erev was completely Cl− dependent (55.8 ± 2.3 mV/decade). Several findings linked ClC-3 with native IClacid; 1) RNA interference directed at ClC-3 message reduced native IClacid; 2) removal of the extracellular “fast gate” (E224A) produced large currents that were pH-insensitive; and 3) wild-type IClC-3 and IClacid were both inhibited by (2-sulfonatoethyl)methanethiosulfonate (MTSES; 10–500 μm)-induced alkanethiolation at exposed cysteine residues. However, a ClC-3 mutant lacking four extracellular cysteine residues (C103_P130del) was completely resistant to MTSES. C103_P130del currents were still acid-activated, but could be distinguished from wild-type IClC-3 and from native IClacid by a much slower response to low pH. Thus, ClC-3 currents are activated by protons and ClC-3 protein may account for native IClacid. Low pH uncouples Cl−/H+ transport so that at pH 4.0 ClC-3 behaves as an anion-selective channel. These findings have important implications for the biology of Cl−/H+ antiporters and perhaps for pH regulation in highly acidic intracellular compartments.

https://openalex.org/W2068164341,"The vitamin D receptor (VDR) pathway is important in the prevention and potentially in the treatment of many cancers. One important mechanism of VDR action is related to its interaction with the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway. Agonist-bound VDR inhibits the oncogenic Wnt/beta-catenin/TCF pathway by interacting directly with beta-catenin and in some cells by increasing cadherin expression which, in turn, recruits beta-catenin to the membrane. Here we identify TCF-4, a transcriptional regulator and beta-catenin binding partner as an indirect target of the VDR pathway.In this work, we show that TCF-4 (gene name TCF7L2) is decreased in the mammary gland of the VDR knockout mouse as compared to the wild-type mouse. Furthermore, we show 1,25(OH)2D3 increases TCF-4 at the RNA and protein levels in several human colorectal cancer cell lines, the effect of which is completely dependent on the VDR. In silico analysis of the human and mouse TCF7L2 promoters identified several putative VDR binding elements. Although TCF7L2 promoter reporters responded to exogenous VDR, and 1,25(OH)2D3, mutation analysis and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, showed that the increase in TCF7L2 did not require recruitment of the VDR to the identified elements and indicates that the regulation by VDR is indirect. This is further confirmed by the requirement of de novo protein synthesis for this up-regulation.Although it is generally assumed that binding of beta-catenin to members of the TCF/LEF family is cancer-promoting, recent studies have indicated that TCF-4 functions instead as a transcriptional repressor that restricts breast and colorectal cancer cell growth. Consequently, we conclude that the 1,25(OH)2D3/VDR-mediated increase in TCF-4 may have a protective role in colon cancer as well as diabetes and Crohn's disease."
https://openalex.org/W2090850868,"Objective RTS,S, a candidate vaccine for malaria, is a recombinant protein expressed in yeast containing part of the circumsporozoite protein (CSP) sequence of 3D7 strain of Plasmodium falciparum linked to the hepatitis B surface antigen in a hybrid protein. The RTS,S antigen is formulated with GSK Biologicals' proprietary Adjuvant Systems AS02A or AS01B. A recent trial of the RTS,S/AS02A and RTS,S/AS01B vaccines evaluated safety, immunogenicity and impact on the development of parasitemia of the two formulations. Parasite isolates from this study were used to determine the molecular impact of RTS,S/AS02A and RTS,S/AS01B on the multiplicity of infection (MOI) and the csp allelic characteristics of subsequent parasitemias. Design The distribution of csp sequences and the MOI of the infecting strains were examined at baseline and in break-through infections from vaccinated individuals and from those receiving a non-malarial vaccine. Setting The study was conducted in Kombewa District, western Kenya. Participants Semi-immune adults from the three study arms provided isolates at baseline and during break-through infections. Outcome Parasite isolates used for determining MOI and divergence of csp T cell–epitopes were 191 at baseline and 87 from break-through infections. Results Grouping recipients of RTS,S/AS01A and RTS,S/AS02B together, vaccine recipients identified as parasite-positive by microscopy contained significantly fewer parasite genotypes than recipients of the rabies vaccine comparator (median in pooled RTS,S groups: 3 versus 4 in controls, P = 0.0313). When analyzed separately, parasitaemic individuals in the RTS,S/AS01B group, but not the RTS,S/AS02A group, were found to have significantly fewer genotypes than the comparator group. Two individual amino acids found in the vaccine construct (Q339 in Th2R and D371 in Th3R) were observed to differ in incidence between vaccine and comparator groups but in different directions; parasites harboring Q339 were less common among pooled RTS,S/AS vaccine recipients than among recipients of rabies vaccine, whereas parasites with D371 were more common among the RTS,S/AS groups. Conclusions It is concluded that both RTS,S/AS vaccines reduce multiplicity of infection. Our results do not support the hypothesis that RTS,S/AS vaccines elicit preferential effects against pfcsp alleles with sequence similarity to the 3D7 pfcsp sequence employed in the vaccine construct."
https://openalex.org/W2035980050,"Bulk solution assays have shown that the isolated CARMIL homology 3 (CAH3) domain from mouse and Acanthamoeba CARMIL rapidly and potently restores actin polymerization when added to actin filaments previously capped with capping protein (CP). To demonstrate this putative uncapping activity directly, we used total internal reflection microscopy to observe single, CP-capped actin filaments before and after the addition of the CAH3 domain from mouse CARMIL-1 (mCAH3). The addition of mCAH3 rapidly restored the polymerization of individual capped filaments, consistent with uncapping. To verify uncapping, filaments were capped with recombinant mouse CP tagged with monomeric green fluorescent protein (mGFP-CP). Restoration of polymerization upon the addition of mCAH3 was immediately preceded by the complete dissociation of mGFP-CP from the filament end, confirming the CAH3-driven uncapping mechanism. Quantitative analyses showed that the percentage of capped filaments that uncapped increased as the concentration of mCAH3 was increased, reaching a maximum of ∼90% at ∼250 nm mCAH3. Moreover, the time interval between mCAH3 addition and uncapping decreased as the concentration of mCAH3 increased, with the half-time of CP at the barbed end decreasing from ∼30 min without mCAH3 to ∼10 s with a saturating amount of mCAH3.

Biol. 2008; 267: 183-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). CP accomplishes this task by binding with high affinity (Kd ∼ 0.1 nm) to the barbed end of the actin filament, thereby blocking the further association (and dissociation) of actin monomers at the fast growing end. CP is one of five proteins that are required for the reconstitution of actin polymerization-driven motility in vitro (3Loisel T.P. Boujemaa R. Pantaloni D. Carlier M.F. Nature. 1999; 401: 613-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar) Moreover, biochemical, cell biological, and modeling studies all suggest that rapid filament capping by CP in vivo is required in order to generate an Arp2/3-dependent dendritic actin network at the leading edge that is sufficiently branched to push the cell forward (4Pollard T.D.

Cell. 1995; 81: 591-600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Together, these observations highlight the necessity of identifying physiological regulators of CP function. A second compelling reason to search for such regulators stems from the very long half-time of CP at the barbed end in vitro (∼30 min for vertebrate CP) (13Kuhn J.R. Pollard T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 28014-28024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 14Schafer D.A. Jennings P.B. Cooper J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 169-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar), because this half-time seems incompatible with the dynamics of actin in vivo, where large regions of F-actin can form and disassemble in seconds. Indeed, one recent study (15Miyoshi T. Tsuji T. Higashida C. Hertzog M. Fujita A. Narumiya S. Scita G. Watanabe N. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 175: 947-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) estimated the average lifetime of CP on the barbed end in vivo to be ∼1 s, or ∼1,800-fold shorter than its in vitro half-time. These observations and considerations point to the possible existence within cells of a CP regulator(s) that dramatically accelerates the dissociation of CP from the barbed end. capping protein CARMIL homology domain 1–3, respectively glutathione S-transferase mouse CARMIL-1 mouse CAH3 phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate total internal reflection dithiothreitol tetramethylrhodamine 5-maleimide 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid ultra-high fidelity tobacco etch virus nitrilotriacetic acid green fluorescent protein enhanced green fluorescent protein monomeric green fluorescent protein isothermal titration calorimetry. One possible cellular regulator of CP function is CARMIL. CARMIL proteins comprise a recently identified family of molecules whose two most conspicuous features are a central, leucine-rich repeat domain and a C-terminal proline-rich domain (16Xu P.

Cell. 2005; 9: 209-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The first CARMIL protein to be identified was Acan125 (16Xu P. Mitchelhill K.I. Kobe B. Kemp B.E. Zot H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 3685-3690Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This 125-kDa Acanthamoeba protein was discovered based on its ability to bind to the isolated Src homology 3 domain of Acanthamoeba myosin-IC, a monomeric unconventional myosin. Using a similar approach, Jung et al. (17Jung G. Remmert K. Wu X. Volosky J.M. Hammer 3rd, J.A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1479-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) subsequently identified p116, the Dictyostelium homologue of Acan125. Importantly, the eluates of their myosin I Src homology 3 domain affinity columns contained not only p116 but also CP and the Arp2/3 complex. Immunoprecipitation reactions and other experiments provided evidence that p116 forms a complex with CP, Arp2/3, and myosin I in vivo and that p116 serves as the scaffold for assembly of this complex by binding CP, Arp2/3, and myosin I at independent sites. Given its central role in forming the complex, Jung et al. (17Jung G. Remmert K. Wu X. Volosky J.M. Hammer 3rd, J.A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1479-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) gave p116 the name CARMIL (for capping protein, Arp2/3, myosin I linker). Subsequent efforts to purify Acanthamoeba CARMIL provided evidence that CARMIL interacts very tightly with CP (22Remmert K. Olszewski T.E. Bowers M.B. Dimitrova M. Ginsburg A. Hammer 3rd, J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3068-3077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Specifically, CARMIL and CP were found to co-purify through a lengthy purification procedure that included ammonium sulfate fractionation, hydrophobic interaction chromatography, affinity chromatography, and anion exchange chromatography. Moreover, the mixture of CARMIL and CP that was obtained from these steps was minimally resolved by size exclusion chromatography despite the fact that these two proteins differ enormously in Stokes radius. Consistent with these observations, a GST fusion protein containing the C-terminal ∼200 residues of Acanthamoeba CARMIL was found to bind CP with an affinity of ∼10 nm (23Uruno T. Remmert K. Hammer 3rd, J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 10635-10650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Sequence alignments identify three regions of strong similarity within CARMIL family proteins that we refer to as CARMIL homology domains 1–3 (CAH1–CAH3) (23Uruno T. Remmert K. Hammer 3rd, J.A. J.

Wear M.A. Huang M. Cooper J.A. Svitkina T.M. Zigmond S.H. Dev. Cell. 2005; 9: 209-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) have established that the CAH3 domain forms the core of the CARMIL CP binding site. In the case of Acanthamoeba CARMIL, the ∼30-residue CAH3 domain falls very near the protein’s C terminus, and the isolated C-terminal 51 residues of Acanthamoeba CARMIL, which contains the protein’s entire CAH3 domain sequence, binds CP very tightly (Kd ∼10 nm by pull-down assay) (23Uruno T. Remmert K. Hammer 3rd, J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 10635-10650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In the case of mouse CARMIL-1, mapping studies localized its CP binding site to an internal 123-residue fragment that encompasses the protein’s CAH3 domain (21Yang C. Pring M. Wear M.A. Huang M. Cooper J.A. Svitkina T.M. Zigmond S.H. Dev. Cell. 2005; 9: 209-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). This fragment, which is referred to as C1, was estimated by kinetic modeling to bind CP with an affinity of ∼1.5 nm (21Yang C. Pring M. Wear M.A. Huang M. Cooper J.A. Svitkina T.M. Zigmond S.H. Dev. Cell. 2005; 9: 209-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Consistent with this estimate, our version of the minimal mCARMIL-1 CP binding site, which comprises essentially the N-terminal 74 residues of C1 (including all of the CAH3 domain) and which we refer to here as mCAH3, binds CP with an affinity of ∼1 nm as determined by ITC. 3T. Uruno, G. Piszczek, and J. A. Hammer III, manuscript in preparation. For all of these active CARMIL fragments, conversion of a highly conserved arginine residue present in the center of the CAH3 sequence to a glutamate residue essentially abrogates their interaction with CP (21Yang C.

Remmert K. Hammer 3rd, J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 10635-10650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and mouse CARMIL-1 (21Yang C. Pring M. Wear M.A. Huang M. Cooper J.A. Svitkina T.M. Zigmond S.H. Dev. Cell. 2005; 9: 209-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) argue strongly that this domain potently antagonizes CP function in two ways. First, assays in which CAH3 and CP are mixed together and then added to actin assembly assays indicate that the binding of CAH3 to CP dramatically reduces the affinity of CP for the barbed end. For the protozoan CAH3 domain, the complex of CAH3 and CP was estimated to bind the barbed end with an affinity of ∼150 nm, down ∼1,000-fold relative to CP alone (23Uruno T. Remmert K. Hammer 3rd, J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 10635-10650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). For the mouse CAH3 domain, the complex of C1 and CP was estimated to bind the barbed end with an affinity of ∼15 nm, down ∼100-fold relative to CP alone (21Yang C. Pring M. Wear M.A. Huang M. Cooper J.A. Svitkina T.M. Zigmond S.H. Dev. Cell. 2005; 9: 209-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) (note that although the inhibition of CP capping activity by CAH3 is profound, the complex of CAH3 and CP still retains some capping activity; for this reason, we do not refer to this aspect of CAH3 behavior as sequestering, which should be restricted to situations in which regulator-CP interaction completely blocks CP capping activity (e.g. V-1·CP complex (24Bhattacharya N. Ghosh S. Sept D. Cooper J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 31021-31030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar)). Second, assays in which the CAH3 domain is added to actin filaments previously capped with CP are consistent with the CAH3 domain-catalyzed removal of CP from the barbed end (i.e. with CAH3-driven uncapping). Importantly, the rapidity of this effect (in the case of the protozoan CAH3 domain, the addition of a 10-fold molar excess of CAH3 over CP resulted in a restoration in the rate of polymerization of previously capped actin filaments to near the seed-only rate in less than 10 s) argues strongly that the CAH3-dependent acceleration of the dissociation of CP from the barbed end is due to the binding of CAH3 to CP at the barbed end, which results in a rapid and large decrease in CP affinity for the filament end (as opposed to a mechanism in which free CAH3 in the assay serves merely as a sink for the slow, spontaneous dissociation of CP from the barbed end) (21Yang C. Pring M. Wear M.A. Huang M. Cooper J.A. Svitkina T.M. Zigmond S.H. Dev. Cell. 2005; 9: 209-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 23Uruno T. Remmert K. Hammer 3rd, J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 10635-10650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This type of uncapping mechanism, where the binding of CAH3 to CP on the barbed end results in a large increase in the off-rate of CP from the end, would be completely consistent with the fact that the preformed complex of CP and CAH3 still binds the barbed end but very weakly. Bulk solution assays performed previously are also consistent with the idea that micelles of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), like the CARMIL CAH3 domain, inhibit the capping activity of free CP and catalyze the removal of CP from capped filament ends (14Schafer D.A.

Chem. 2007; 282: 5871-5879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Using total internal reflection (TIRF) microscopy to visualize the capping and uncapping of single actin filaments in vitro, Kuhn and Pollard (13Kuhn J.R. Pollard T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 28014-28024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) recently confirmed that PIP2 micelles antagonize the capping activity of free CP. Moreover, they obtained association and dissociation rate constants for mouse CP and the barbed end using these single molecule measurements that are in excellent agreement with rates measured previously using bulk solution assays. Importantly, however, they found no evidence in their TIRF-based assays that PIP2 micelles accelerate the dissociation of CP from the barbed end of filaments previously capped with CP. The authors reconciled this result with the results of solution-based assays, which are consistent with PIP2-driven uncapping, by showing that the generation of free barbed ends resulting from the shearing/severing of actin filament that occurs during the performance of solution-based assays, coupled with the sequestration of the free CP in the assay by PIP2 micelles (so that the free ends generated by filament breakage are not capped), results in an increase in actin polymerization upon the addition of PIP2 to capped filaments that gives the appearance of PIP2-driven uncapping. Given their results, the authors suggested that the apparent uncapping activity of CARMIL, as observed in bulk solution assays (21Yang C. Pring M. Wear M.A. Huang M. Cooper J.A. Svitkina T.M.

This important suggestion spawned the experiments described in this paper. Actin was purified from rabbit skeletal muscle as described previously (26Kuhn J.R. Pollard T.D. Biophys. J. 2005; 88: 1387-1402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Only the trailing fractions of G-actin from the S-300 gel filtration column, which lack oligomers that nucleate polymerization, were used. G-actin was stored in G-buffer (0.2 mm ATP, 1 mm NaN2, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm DTT, and 2 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0)). Mg-actin in KMEI buffer (50 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm imidazole (pH 7.0)) was labeled with tetramethylrhodamine 5-maleimide (TMR) (Invitrogen) and purified by centrifugation, dialysis, and gel filtration as described elsewhere (27Fujiwara I. Takahashi S. Tadakuma H. Funatsu T. Ishiwata S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 666-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The concentrations of actin and TMR were estimated using the extinction coefficients A290 = 26,600 m−1 cm−1 and A550 = 96,900 m−1 cm−1, respectively (28Houk Jr., T.W. Ue K. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 62: 66-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). The concentration of labeled actin was determined by subtracting 0.208 times the A550 value from the A290 value. TIRF experiments were performed using 20% labeled actin prepared by mixing equal concentrations of TMR-labeled actin and unlabeled actin at a volume ratio of 1:4. G-actin was labeled with pyrene, purified, and stored at −80 °C as described previously (29Cooper J.A. Walker S.B. Pollard T.D. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1983; 4: 253-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). The concentration of pyrene-labeled actin was determined by subtracting 0.127 times the A344 value from the A290 value. The concentration of pyrene was determined using A344 = 22,000 m−1 cm−1 (30Kouyama T. Mihashi K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 105: 279-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Solution assays were performed using 10% pyrene-labeled actin. Rabbit skeletal muscle myosin was prepared as described previously (31Kielly W.W. Harrington W.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1960; 41: 401-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The myosin was dialyzed into myosin buffer (0.5 m KCl and 10 mm MOPS (pH 7.0)), adjusted to a concentration of 4 μm, and inactivated by incubation at room temperature for 40 min with N-ethylmaleimide (Sigma) at a final concentration of 5 mm. DTT was added to a final concentration of 25 mm to stop the reaction. To collect the inactivated myosin, 10 volumes of distilled water were added to cause the myosin to assemble into filaments. The resulting myosin polymers were collected by centrifugation for 10 min at 5,000 × g. Following three washes of the pellet with distilled water, the myosin was solubilized in myosin buffer (0.5 m KCl, 1 mm DTT, and 10 mm MOPS (pH 7.0)), dialyzed into myosin storage buffer (myosin buffer supplemented with 50% glycerol), and stored at −20 °C. The concentration of the myosin was estimated using the extinction coefficient A280 = 260,000 m−1 cm−1 (13Kuhn J.R. Pollard T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 28014-28024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). mCAH3, the minimal CAH3 domain fragment from mCARMIL-1 (GenBankTM AAR96060) used in this study, corresponds to residues 965–1038 of mCARMIL-1 or essentially the N-terminal 74 residues of C-1 (residues 962–1084), the 123-residue, CAH3 domain-containing mCARMIL-1 fragment used previously by Yang et al. (21Yang C. Pring M. Wear M.A. Huang M. Cooper J.A. Svitkina T.M. Zigmond S.H. Dev. Cell. 2005; 9: 209-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The experiments that led to the choice of residues 965–1038 for mCAH3, which span what we term the a and b subdomains of the mCARMIL1 CAH3 domain, will be described elsewhere.3 In terms of the overall strategy to generate the mCAH3 protein, we placed the coding sequence for mCAH3 downstream of GST and upstream from a His6 tag to allow dual purification of the peptide. We also added a trytophan residue immediately before the first residue of mCAH3 to allow the determination of protein concentration by absorbance. This cassette was then cloned into a GST plasmid containing a TEV protease cleavage site just 5′ of the tryptophan residue to allow removal of the GST moiety (see below). The sequence of the final mCAH3 protein used in this study is shown in Fig. 1D. To create the mCAH3 expression plasmid, we used ultra-high fidelity (UHF) Pfu polymerase (Stratagene), a full-length cDNA for mCARMIL-1, as the template and the following primers: 5′-CGGGGATCCGTCCGGCAAGAGAAGCGAAGCTCGGGG-3′ and 5′-AAGCGAATTCTACACCTTCTTGGTGAAAAACTCATCTAC-3′. The amplified fragment was then purified using a QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen), digested with BamHI and EcoRI, repurified, and cloned into the GST vector pGEX-TEV-Parallel 1. The insert in the final plasmid was verified by DNA sequencing. Site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange, Stratagene) was used to convert the arginine residue at position 993 that is critical for interaction with CP (21Yang C. Pring M. Wear M.A. Huang M. Cooper J.A.

Chem. 2006; 281: 10635-10650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) to a glutamate residue. The presence of the mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The large scale expression of GST- and histidine-tagged mCAH3 and its initial purification on glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) were performed exactly as described recently for an earlier version of GST-tagged mCAH3 lacking the TEV cleavage site and the C-terminal histidine tag (32Remmert K. Uruno T. Hammer J.A. Protein Expr. Purif. 2009; 67: 113-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Although some control experiments were performed using the resulting GST-tagged protein (see supplemental Fig. S1E), most experiments were performed using the protein following the removal of the GST moiety and a second purification step using the remaining histidine tag. To obtain such GST-free mCAH3, 1 ml of glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads charged with ∼6 mg of GST-mCAH3 was washed five times with phosphate-buffered saline and two times with TEV digestion buffer (150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0)) (10 ml/wash), resuspended in 1 ml of TEV digestion buffer, and digested for 2 h at room temperature with gentle rotation using 4 μl (40 units) of AcTEV protease (Invitrogen). Separate experiments determined that this amount of TEV protease was sufficient to digest >80% of the bound fusion protein in 2 h. The liberated fusion protein was collected as a flow-through by washing the resin in a small column using 2 ml of Ni2+-NTA binding buffer (300 mm NaCl, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm imidazole (pH 8.0), and 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 8.0)). This material was then immediately added to 1 ml of Ni2+-NTA beads (Qiagen) suspended in 5 ml of Ni2+-NTA binding buffer and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. After washing the beads three times (15 ml each) with Ni2+-NTA washing buffer (same as binding buffer except containing 20 mm imidazole (pH 8.0)), GST-free mCAH3 was eluted using Ni2+-NTA elution buffer (same as binding buffer except containing 160 mm imidazole (pH 8.0)). To separate mCAH3 from TEV protease, which is also present in the nickel column eluate because it also possesses a histidine tag, the eluate was rapidly dialyzed into Mono Q running buffer (50 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, and 25 mm MOPS (pH 7.2)), loaded onto a 1-ml Mono Q column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with Mono Q running buffer, and the column was washed with running buffer. This was sufficient to separate mCAH3 from the protease, because only the protease bound to the resin. The column flow-through was then concentrated using a Centricon concentrator and dialyzed against storage buffer (50 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm DTT, and 10 mm imidazole (pH 7.0)). The GST-tagged version of mCAH3 used in a few experiments was treated similarly. Protein concentrations were estimated using the following extinction coefficients: A280 = 49,850 m−1 cm−1 for GST-mCAH3 and A280 = 5,500 m−1 cm−1 for mCAH3. Densitometry of 4–20% SDS-polyacrylamide gels stained with Coomassie Blue indicated that GST-mCAH3 and mCAH3 were ∼93 and ∼96% pure, respectively. Both proteins were kept on ice and used for less than 2 weeks. To generate a version of mCAH3 protein possessing a GFP tag for visualization in TIRF imaging, the coding sequence for the monomeric version of EGFP (mGFP), together with a His6 tag at its N terminus for the purpose of purifying the chimeric protein, was fused to the N terminus of the coding sequence of mCAH3. To create this chimera, the coding sequence for mCAH3 flanked by XhoI and EcoRI sites was amplified using UHF Pfu polymerase and the following primers: 5′-ATAGTCCTCGAGGATCAGTCCGGCAAGAGAAGCGAAGC-3′ and 5′-TGAGAATTCTCACACCTTCTTGGTGAAAAACTCATCTACCCCTTCATCC-3′. The purified PCR product was then digested with XhoI and EcoRI and cloned into mEGFP-C1 (a monomeric version of EGFP-C1; gift of George Patterson (NICHD, National Institutes of Health)). A sequence-verified clone was then used as a template to amplify using UHF Pfu polymeras"
https://openalex.org/W1980624722,"Neurons undergo long term, activity dependent changes that are mediated by activation of second messenger cascades. In particular, calcium-dependent activation of the cyclic-AMP/Protein kinase A signaling cascade has been implicated in several developmental processes including cell survival, axonal outgrowth, and axonal refinement. The biochemical link between calcium influx and the activation of the cAMP/PKA pathway is primarily mediated through adenylate cyclases. Here, dual imaging of intracellular calcium concentration and PKA activity was used to assay the role of different classes of calcium-dependent adenylate cyclases (ACs) in the activation of the cAMP/PKA pathway in retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). Surprisingly, depolarization-induced calcium-dependent PKA transients persist in barrelless mice lacking AC1, the predominant calcium-dependent adenylate cyclase in RGCs, as well as in double knockout mice lacking both AC1 and AC8. Furthermore, in a subset of RGCs, depolarization-induced PKA transients persist during the inhibition of all transmembrane adenylate cyclases. These results are consistent with the existence of a soluble adenylate cyclase that plays a role in calcium-dependent activation of the cAMP/PKA cascade in neurons."
https://openalex.org/W1996529632,"Toll-Like Receptors (TLR) are critical elements of the innate arm of the vertebrate immune system. They constitute a multigenic family of receptors which collectively bind a diverse array of--exogeneous as well as endogeneous--ligands. An exponential burst of knowledge has defined their biological role in fight against infections and generation/modulation of auto-immune disorders. Hence, they could at least be conceptually recognized--despite being structurally unrelated - as innate counterparts to Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) molecules--equally recognizing antigenic ligands (albeit structurally more homogeneous i.e., peptides), again derived from self and/or non-self sources--preeminent this time in adaptive immunity. Our great disparities in face of infections and/or susceptibility to auto-immune diseases have provoked an intense search for genetic explanations, in part satisfied by the extraordinary MHC allelic repertoire. An equally in-depth and systematic analysis of TLR diversity is lacking despite numerous independent reports of a growing number of SNPs within these loci. The work described here aims at providing a preliminary picture of the allelic repertoire--and not purely SNPs--of all 10 human TLR coding sequences (with exception of TLR3) within a single cohort of up to 100 individuals. It appears from our work that TLR are unequally polymorphic: TLR2 (DNA alleles: 7/protein alleles: 3), 4 (4/3), 7 (6/3), 8 (9/2) and 9 (8/3) being comparatively least diverse whereas TLR1 (11/10), 5 (14/12), 6 (10/8) and 10 (15/10) show a substantial number of alleles. In addition to allelic assignment of a large number of SNPs, 10 new polymorphic positions were hereby identified. Hence this work depicts a first overview of the diversity of almost all human TLR genes, a prelude for large-scale population genetics as well as genetic association studies."
https://openalex.org/W2170060106,"We have developed a method that predicts Protein-Protein Interactions (PPIs) based on the similarity of the context in which proteins appear in literature. This method outperforms previously developed PPI prediction algorithms that rely on the conjunction of two protein names in MEDLINE abstracts. We show significant increases in coverage (76% versus 32%) and sensitivity (66% versus 41% at a specificity of 95%) for the prediction of PPIs currently archived in 6 PPI databases. A retrospective analysis shows that PPIs can efficiently be predicted before they enter PPI databases and before their interaction is explicitly described in the literature. The practical value of the method for discovery of novel PPIs is illustrated by the experimental confirmation of the inferred physical interaction between CAPN3 and PARVB, which was based on frequent co-occurrence of both proteins with concepts like Z-disc, dysferlin, and alpha-actinin. The relationships between proteins predicted by our method are broader than PPIs, and include proteins in the same complex or pathway. Dependent on the type of relationships deemed useful, the precision of our method can be as high as 90%. The full set of predicted interactions is available in a downloadable matrix and through the webtool Nermal, which lists the most likely interaction partners for a given protein. Our framework can be used for prioritizing potential interaction partners, hitherto undiscovered, for follow-up studies and to aid the generation of accurate protein interaction maps."

Our study elucidates how one of these effectors, YopO, blocks phagocytosis. We demonstrate using different phagocytic models that YopO specifically blocks Rac-dependent Fcγ receptor internalization pathway but not complement receptor 3-dependent uptake, which is controlled by Rho activity. We show that YopO prevents Rac activation but does not affect Rac accumulation at the phagocytic cup. In addition, we show that plasma membrane localization and the guanine-nucleotide dissociation inhibitor (GDI)-like domain of YopO cooperate for maximal anti-phagocytosis. Although YopO has the same affinity for Rac1, Rac2, and RhoA in vitro, it selectively interacts with Rac isoforms in cells. This is due to the differential localization of the Rho family G proteins in resting cells; Rac isoforms partially exist as a GDI-free pool at the membrane of resting cells, whereas RhoA is trapped in the cytosol by RhoGDIα. We propose that YopO exploits this basic difference in localization and availability to selectively inhibit Rac-dependent phagocytosis.

https://openalex.org/W1964948851,"Foxp3, a 47-kDa transcription factor, is necessary for the function of CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells (Tregs), with an essential role in the control of self-reactive T cells and in preventing autoimmunity. Activation of Tregs by TCR engagement results in upregulation of Foxp3 expression, followed by its rapid nuclear transport and binding to chromatin. Here, we identify three distinct Foxp3 domains that contribute to nuclear transport. The first domain (Domain 1) comprises the C-terminal 12 amino acids. The second domain (Domain 2) is located immediately N-terminal to the forkhead domain (FHD), recently reported to be a binding site for the runt-related transcription factor 1/acute myeloid leukemia 1 (Runx1/AML1). The third domain (Domain 3) is located within the N-terminal first 51 amino acids. Unlike the known nuclear localization signals (NLSs), none of these three regions are rich in basic residues and do not bear any similarity to known monopartite or bipartite NLSs that have one or more clusters of basic amino acids. The basic arginine-lysine-lysine-arginine (RKKR) sequence, located 12-aa from the C-terminal end of Foxp3 was previously reported to be a nuclear localization signal (NLS) for several proteins, including for a GFP-Foxp3 hybrid. Evidence is provided here that in the full-length native Foxp3 RKKR does not function as an NLS. The data reported in this study indicates that Foxp3 achieves nuclear transport by binding to other nuclear factors and co-transporting with them to the nucleus."
https://openalex.org/W2092593065,"Invasion through the extracellular matrix (ECM) is important for wound healing, immunological responses and metastasis. We established an invasion-based cell motility screen using Boyden chambers overlaid with Matrigel to select for pro-invasive genes. By this method we identified antisense to MARCKS related protein (MRP), whose family member MARCKS is a target of miR-21, a microRNA involved in tumor growth, invasion and metastasis in multiple human cancers. We confirmed that targeted knockdown of MRP, in both EpRas mammary epithelial cells and PC3 prostate cancer cells, promoted in vitro cell migration that was blocked by trifluoperazine. Additionally, we observed increased immunofluoresence of E-cadherin, beta-catenin and APC at sites of cell-cell contact in EpRas cells with MRP knockdown suggesting formation of adherens junctions. By wound healing assay we observed that reduced MRP supported collective cell migration, a type of cell movement where adherens junctions are maintained. However, destabilized adherens junctions, like those seen in EpRas cells, are frequently important for oncogenic signaling. Consequently, knockdown of MRP in EpRas caused loss of tumorigenesis in vivo, and reduced Wnt3a induced TCF reporter signaling in vitro. Together our data suggest that reducing MRP expression promotes formation of adherens junctions in EpRas cells, allowing collective cell migration, but interferes with oncogenic beta-catenin signaling and tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1968388880,"The amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide, widely known as the causative molecule of Alzheimer disease (AD), is generated by the sequential cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by the aspartyl proteases BACE1/beta-secretase and presenilin/gamma-secretase. Inhibition of BACE1, therefore, is a promising strategy for preventing the progression of AD. However, beta-secretase inhibitors (BSIs) exhibit unexpectedly low potency in cells expressing ""Swedish mutant"" APP (APPswe) and in the transgenic mouse Tg2576, an AD model overexpressing APPswe. The Swedish mutation dramatically accelerates beta-cleavage of APP and hence the generation of Abeta; this acceleration has been assumed to underlie the poor inhibitory activity of BSI against APPswe processing. Here, we studied the mechanism by which the Swedish mutation causes this BSI potency decrease. Surprisingly, decreased BSI potency was not observed in an in vitro assay using purified BACE1 and substrates, indicating that the accelerated beta-cleavage resulting from the Swedish mutation is not its underlying cause. By focusing on differences between the cell-based and in vitro assays, we have demonstrated here that the potency decrease is caused by the aberrant subcellular localization of APPswe processing and not by accelerated beta-cleavage or the accumulation of the C-terminal fragment of beta-cleaved APP. Because most patients with sporadic AD express wild type APP, our findings suggest that the wild type mouse is superior to the Tg2576 mouse as a model for determining the effective dose of BSI for AD patients. This work provides novel insights into the potency decrease of BSI and valuable suggestions for its development as a disease-modifying agent."
https://openalex.org/W1997240698,"Mutations in the integral membrane protein 2B, also known as BRI(2), a type II trans-membrane domain protein cause two autosomal dominant neurodegenerative diseases, Familial British and Danish Dementia. In these conditions, accumulation of a C-terminal peptide (ABri and ADan) cleaved off from the mutated precursor protein by the pro-protein convertase furin, leads to amyloid deposition in the walls of blood vessels and parenchyma of the brain. Recent advances in the understanding of the generation of amyloid in Alzheimer's disease has lead to the finding that BRI(2) interacts with the Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP), decreasing the efficiency of APP processing to generate Abeta. The interaction between the two precursors, APP and BRI(2), and possibly between Abeta and ABri or ADan, could be important in influencing the rate of amyloid production or the tendency of these peptides to aggregate.We have generated the first BRI(2) Danish Knock-In (FDD(KI)) murine model of FDD, expressing the pathogenic decamer duplication in exon 6 of the BRI(2) gene. FDD(KI) mice do not show any evident abnormal phenotype, with normal brain histology and no detectable amyloid deposition in blood vessel walls or parenchyma.This new murine mouse model will be important to further understand the interaction between APP and BRI(2), and to provide insights into the molecular basis of FDD."
https://openalex.org/W2113050244,"Determining the correct number of positive immune cells in immunohistological sections of colorectal cancer and other tumor entities is emerging as an important clinical predictor and therapy selector for an individual patient. This task is usually obstructed by cell conglomerates of various sizes. We here show that at least in colorectal cancer the inclusion of immune cell conglomerates is indispensable for estimating reliable patient cell counts. Integrating virtual microscopy and image processing principally allows the high-throughput evaluation of complete tissue slides.For such large-scale systems we demonstrate a robust quantitative image processing algorithm for the reproducible quantification of cell conglomerates on CD3 positive T cells in colorectal cancer. While isolated cells (28 to 80 microm(2)) are counted directly, the number of cells contained in a conglomerate is estimated by dividing the area of the conglomerate in thin tissues sections (< or =6 microm) by the median area covered by an isolated T cell which we determined as 58 microm(2). We applied our algorithm to large numbers of CD3 positive T cell conglomerates and compared the results to cell counts obtained manually by two independent observers. While especially for high cell counts, the manual counting showed a deviation of up to 400 cells/mm(2) (41% variation), algorithm-determined T cell numbers generally lay in between the manually observed cell numbers but with perfect reproducibility.In summary, we recommend our approach as an objective and robust strategy for quantifying immune cell densities in immunohistological sections which can be directly implemented into automated full slide image processing systems."
https://openalex.org/W2022856969,"Rhesus (Rh) glycoproteins are a family of membrane proteins capable of transporting ammonia. We isolated the full-length cDNA of a novel Rh glycoprotein, Rhp2, from a kidney cDNA library from the banded hound shark, Triakis scyllium. Molecular cloning and characterization indicated that Rhp2 consists of 476 amino acid residues and has 12 putative transmembrane spans, consistent with the structure of other family members. The shark Rhp2 gene was found to consist of only one coding exon. Northern blotting and in situ hybridization revealed that Rhp2 mRNA is exclusively expressed in the renal tubules of the sinus zone but not in the bundle zone and renal corpuscles. Immunohistochemical staining with a specific antiserum showed that Rhp2 is localized in the basolateral membranes of renal tubule cells. Double fluorescence labeling with phalloidin or labeling of the Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase further narrowed the location to the second and fourth loops in the sinus zone. Vacuolar type H(+)-ATPase was localized in apical membranes of the Rhp2-expressing tubule cells. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis and Western blotting showed that expression of Rhp2 was increased in response to elevation of environmental salinity. Functional analysis using the Xenopus oocyte expression system showed that Rhp2 has transport activity for methylammonium, an analog of ammonia. This transport activity was inhibited by NH(4)Cl but not trimethylamine-N-oxide and urea. These results suggested that Rhp2 is involved in ammonia reabsorption in the kidney of the elasmobranch group of cartilaginous fish comprising the sharks and rays."
https://openalex.org/W1999997800,"Background Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) leads to progressive accumulation of lymphocytes in the blood, bone marrow, and lymphatic tissues. Previous findings have suggested that the mtDNA could play an important role in CLL. Methodology/Principal Findings The mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control-region was analyzed in lymphocyte cell DNA extracts and compared with their granulocyte counterpart extract of 146 patients suffering from B-Cell CLL; B-CLL (all recruited from the Basque country). Major efforts were undertaken to rule out methodological artefacts that would render a high false positive rate for mtDNA instabilities and thus lead to erroneous interpretation of sequence instabilities. Only twenty instabilities were finally confirmed, most of them affecting the homopolymeric stretch located in the second hypervariable segment (HVS-II) around position 310, which is well known to constitute an extreme mutational hotspot of length polymorphism, as these mutations are frequently observed in the general human population. A critical revision of the findings in previous studies indicates a lack of proper methodological standards, which eventually led to an overinterpretation of the role of the mtDNA in CLL tumorigenesis. Conclusions/Significance Our results suggest that mtDNA instability is not the primary causal factor in B-CLL. A secondary role of mtDNA mutations cannot be fully ruled out under the hypothesis that the progressive accumulation of mtDNA instabilities could finally contribute to the tumoral process. Recommendations are given that would help to minimize erroneous interpretation of sequencing results in mtDNA studies in tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2035315697,"Plant cell wall degrading enzymes (PCWDEs) of plant pathogens are receiving increasing interest for their potential to trigger plant defense reactions. In an antagonistic co-evolutionary arms race between host and pathogen, PCWDEs could be under strong selection. Here, we tested the hypothesis that PCWDEs in the fungal wheat pathogen Mycosphaerella graminicola have been positively selected by analyzing ratios of non-synonymous and synonymous nucleotide changes in the genes encoding these enzymes. Analyses of five PCWDEs demonstrated that one (beta-xylosidase) has been under strong positive selection and experienced an accelerated rate of evolution. In contrast, PCWDEs in the closest relatives of M. graminicola collected from wild grasses did not show evidence for selection or deviation from a molecular clock. Since the genealogical divergence of M. graminicola from these latter species coincided with the onset of agriculture, we hypothesize that the recent domestication of the host plant and/or agricultural practices triggered positive selection in beta-xylosidase and that this enzyme played a key role in the emergence of a host-specialized pathogen."
https://openalex.org/W2146374304,"The differentiation and senescence programs of metazoans play key roles in regulating normal development and preventing aberrant cell proliferation, such as cancer. These programs are intimately associated with both the mitotic and apoptotic pathways. Caspase-8 is an apical apoptotic initiator that has recently been appreciated to coordinate non-apoptotic roles in the cell. Most of these functions are attributed to the catalytic domain, however, the amino-terminal death effector domains (DED)s, which belong to the death domain superfamily of proteins, can also play key roles during development. Here we describe a novel role for caspase-8 DEDs in regulating cell differentiation and senescence. Caspase-8 DEDs accumulate during terminal differentiation and senescence of epithelial, endothelial and myeloid cells; genetic deletion or shRNA suppression of caspase-8 disrupts cell differentiation, while re-expression of DEDs rescues this phenotype. Among caspase-8 deficient neuroblastoma cells, DED expression attenuated tumor growth in vivo and proliferation in vitro via disruption of mitosis and cytokinesis, resulting in upregulation of p53 and induction of differentiation markers. These events occur independent of caspase-8 catalytic activity, but require a critical lysine (K156) in a microtubule-binding motif in the second DED domain. The results demonstrate a new function for the DEDs of caspase-8, and describe an unexpected mechanism that contributes to cell differentiation and senescence."
https://openalex.org/W1980678517,"Molecular techniques have revealed that avian mating systems are more diverse and complex than previously thought. We used microsatellite markers to determine genetic parentage, the prevalence of extrapair paternity and quasi-parasitism (i.e. situations where a male's extrapair mate lay in his nest) in a socially monogamous population of three-toed woodpeckers (Picoides tridactylus) in southern Finland. A total of 129 adults and nestlings, representing 5-9 families annually from 2004-2007, were genotyped at up to ten microsatellite loci. The results of genetic assignment tests confirmed that monogamous parentage characterized the majority (84.6%, 22/26) of broods, and that most (93.8%, 75/80) nestlings were the offspring of their social parents. Two of 80 nestlings (2.5%) in two of 26 broods (7.7%) were sired by extrapair males and quasi-parasitism occurred in 3.8% (3/80) of nestlings and 7.7% (2/26) of broods. Hence, the levels of extrapair parentage were low, possibly because both genetic polygyny and polyandry are constrained by the high paternal effort required for parental care. The co-occurrence of low levels of extrapair paternity and quasi-parasitism are discussed in light of ecological and behavioural factors characterizing the species biology."
https://openalex.org/W2033517386,"Normal-pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) is a neurodegenerative disorder that usually occurs late in adult life. Clinically, the cardinal features include gait disturbances, urinary incontinence, and cognitive decline.Herein we report the characterization of a novel mouse model of NPH (designated p23-ST1), created by N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU)-induced mutagenesis. The ventricular size in the brain was measured by 3-dimensional micro-magnetic resonance imaging (3D-MRI) and was found to be enlarged. Intracranial pressure was measured and was found to fall within a normal range. A histological assessment and tracer flow study revealed that the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) pathway of p23-ST1 mice was normal without obstruction. Motor functions were assessed using a rotarod apparatus and a CatWalk gait automatic analyzer. Mutant mice showed poor rotarod performance and gait disturbances. Cognitive function was evaluated using auditory fear-conditioned responses with the mutant displaying both short- and long-term memory deficits. With an increase in urination frequency and volume, the mutant showed features of incontinence. Nissl substance staining and cell-type-specific markers were used to examine the brain pathology. These studies revealed concurrent glial activation and neuronal loss in the periventricular regions of mutant animals. In particular, chronically activated microglia were found in septal areas at a relatively young age, implying that microglial activation might contribute to the pathogenesis of NPH. These defects were transmitted in an autosomal dominant mode with reduced penetrance. Using a whole-genome scan employing 287 single-nucleotide polymorphic (SNP) markers and further refinement using six additional SNP markers and four microsatellite markers, the causative mutation was mapped to a 5.3-cM region on chromosome 4.Our results collectively demonstrate that the p23-ST1 mouse is a novel mouse model of human NPH. Clinical observations suggest that dysfunctions and alterations in the brains of patients with NPH might occur much earlier than the appearance of clinical signs. p23-ST1 mice provide a unique opportunity to characterize molecular changes and the pathogenic mechanism of NPH."
https://openalex.org/W1996551417,"An ability to measure the biochemical parameters and structures of protein complexes at defined locations within the cellular environment would improve our understanding of cellular function. We describe widely applicable, calibrated Förster resonance energy transfer methods that quantify structural and biochemical parameters for interaction of the human estrogen receptor alpha-isoform (ER alpha) with the receptor interacting domains (RIDs) of three cofactors (SRC1, SRC2, SRC3) in living cells. The interactions of ER alpha with all three SRC-RIDs, measured throughout the cell nucleus, transitioned from structurally similar, high affinity complexes containing two ER alphas at low free SRC-RID concentrations (<2 nm) to lower affinity complexes with an ER alpha monomer at higher SRC-RID concentrations (approximately 10 nm). The methods also showed that only a subpopulation of ER alpha was available to form complexes with the SRC-RIDs in the cell. These methods represent a template for extracting unprecedented details of the biochemistry and structure of any complex that is capable of being measured by Förster resonance energy transfer in the cellular environment."
https://openalex.org/W2093343058,"The solute carrier transmembrane protein prestin (SLC26A5) drives an active electromechanical transduction process in cochlear outer hair cells that increases hearing sensitivity and frequency discrimination in mammals. A large intramembraneous charge movement, the nonlinear capacitance (NLC), is the electrical signature of prestin function. The transmembrane domain (TMD) helices and residues involved in the intramembrane charge displacement remain unknown. We have performed cysteine-scanning mutagenesis with serine or valine replacement to investigate the importance of cysteine residues to prestin structure and function. The distribution of oligomeric states and membrane abundance of prestin was also probed to investigate whether cysteine residues participate in prestin oligomerization and/or NLC. Our results reveal that 1) Cys-196 (TMD 4) and Cys-415 (TMD 10) do not tolerate serine replacement, and thus maintaining hydrophobicity at these locations is important for the mechanism of charge movement; 2) Cys-260 (TMD 6) and Cys-381 (TMD 9) tolerate serine replacement and are probably water-exposed; and 3) if disulfide bonds are present, they do not serve a functional role as measured via NLC. These novel findings are consistent with a recent structural model, which proposes that prestin contains an occluded aqueous pore, and we posit that the orientations of transmembrane domain helices 4 and 10 are essential for proper prestin function."
https://openalex.org/W2065273403,"Background Purity, yield, speed and cost are important considerations in plasmid purification, but it is difficult to achieve all of these at the same time. Currently, there are many protocols and kits for DNA purification, however none maximize all four considerations. Methodology/Principal Findings We now describe a fast, efficient and economic in-house protocol for plasmid preparation using glass syringe filters. Plasmid yield and quality as determined by enzyme digestion and transfection efficiency were equivalent to the expensive commercial kits. Importantly, the time required for purification was much less than that required using a commercial kit. Conclusions/Significance This method provides DNA yield and quality similar to that obtained with commercial kits, but is more rapid and less costly."
https://openalex.org/W1986308801,"Our recognition of the mitochondria as being important sites of fatty acid biosynthesis is continuously unfolding, especially in light of new data becoming available on compromised fatty acid synthase type 2 (FASII) in mammals. For example, perturbed regulation of murine 17β-HSD8 encoding a component of the mitochondrial FASII enzyme 3-oxoacyl-thioester reductase is implicated in polycystic kidney disease. In addition, over-expression in mice of the Mecr gene coding for 2-trans-enoyl-thioester reductase, also of mitochondrial FASII, leads to impaired heart function. However, mouse knockouts for mitochondrial FASII have hitherto not been reported and, hence, there is a need to develop alternate metazoan models such as nematodes or fruit flies. Here, the identification of Caenorhabditis elegans W09H1.5/MECR-1 as a 2-trans-enoyl-thioester reductase of mitochondrial FASII is reported. To identify MECR-1, Saccharomyces cerevisiae etr1Δ mutant cells were employed that are devoid of mitochondrial 2-trans-enoyl-thioester reductase Etr1p. These yeast mutants fail to synthesize sufficient levels of lipoic acid or form cytochrome complexes, and cannot respire or grow on non-fermentable carbon sources. A mutant yeast strain ectopically expressing nematode mecr-1 was shown to contain reductase activity and resemble the self-complemented mutant strain for these phenotype characteristics. Since MECR-1 was not intentionally targeted for compartmentalization using a yeast mitochondrial leader sequence, this inferred that the protein represented a physiologically functional mitochondrial 2-trans-enoyl-thioester reductase. In accordance with published findings, RNAi-mediated knockdown of mecr-1 in C. elegans resulted in life span extension, presumably due to mitochondrial dysfunction. Moreover, old mecr-1(RNAi) worms had better internal organ appearance and were more mobile than control worms, indicating a reduced physiological age. This is the first report on RNAi work dedicated specifically to curtailing mitochondrial FASII in metazoans. The availability of affected survivors will help to position C. elegans as an excellent model for future pursuits in the emerging field of mitochondrial FASII research."
